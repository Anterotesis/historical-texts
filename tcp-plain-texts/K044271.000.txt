 THE School for LOVERS A COMEDY  As it is Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL in  DruryLane  By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD  Esq  POET LAUREAT  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  and Sold by J HINXMAN in  Paternosterrow  MDCCLXII  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following Comedy is formed on a plan of Monsieur de Fontenelle's never intended for the stage and printed in the eighth volume of his works under the title of Le Testament  The scene of that piece is laid in Greece and the embarrassing circumstances depend on some peculiarities in the customs of that coun∣try Slaves likewise as is usual in the Grecian Comedy act as confidantes to the principal personages The Author therefore hopes he may be excused for having made the story English and his own for having introduced a new character and endeavoured to heighten those he found already sketched out The delicacy of the sentiments in Philonoe and Eudamidas he has inviolably adhered to wherever he could insert them properly in his Caelia and Sir John Dorilant and would willingly flatter himself that he has made great and not contemptible additions to their characters as well as to the others  Those who will give themselves the trouble to read both pieces will see where the Author is or is not indebted to that elegant French Writer  TO THE MEMORY OF MONSIEUR DE FONTENELLE THIS COMEDY IS INSCRIBED BY A LOVER OF SIMPLICITY  THE AUTHOR  PROLOGUE As it was intended to have been SPOKEN  SUCCESS makes people vainThe maxim's true  We all confess it and not over new  The veriest clown who stumps along the streets  And doffs his hat to each grave cit he meets  Some twelvemonths hence bedaub'd with livery lace  Shall thrust his saucy flambeau in your face  Not so our Bard tho' twice your kind applause  Has on this fickle spot espous'd his cause  He owns with gratitude th' obliging debt  Has twice been favour'd and is modest yet  Plain Tragedy his first adventurous care  Spoke to your hearts and found an echo there  Plain Comedy tonight with strokes refin'd  Would catch the coyest features of the mind  Would play politely with your hopes and fears  And sometimes smiles provoke and sometimes tears  Your giant wits like those of old may climb  Olympus high and step o'er space and time  May stride with sevenleagu'd boots from shore to shore  And nobly by transgressing charm you more  Alas our Author dares not laugh at schools  Plain sense confines his humbler Muse to rules  Form'd on the classic scale his structures rise  He shifts no scenes to dazzle and surprize  In one poor garden's solitary grove  Like the primaeval pair his lovers rove  And in due time will each transaction pass  Unless some hasty critic shakes the glass  PROLOGUE As it is spoken by Mr GARRICK  SUCCESS makes people vainThe maxim's true  We all confess it and not over new  The veriest clown who stumps along the streets  And doffs his hat to each grave cit he meets  Some twelvemonths hence bedaub'd with livery lace  Shall thrust his saucy flambeau in your face  Not so our Bardthough twice your kind applause  Has on this fickle spot espous'd his cause  He owns with gratitude th' obliging debt  Has twice been favour'd and is modest yet  Your giant wits like those of old may climb  Olympus high and step o'er space and time  May stride with sevenleagu'd boots from shore to shore  And nobly by transgressing charm ye more  Alas our Author dares not laugh at schools  Plain sense confines his humbler Muse to rules  He shifts no scenesBut here I stop'd him short  Not change your scenes said I I'm sorry for't  My constant friends above around below  Have English tastes and love both change and show▪  Without such aids even Shakespear would be flat  Our crouded Pantomimes are proofs of that  What eager transport stares from every eye  When pullies rattle and our Genii fly  When tin cascades like falling waters gleam  Or through the canvasbursts the real stream  While thirsty Islington laments in vain  Half her NewRiver roll'd to DruryLane  Lord Sir said I for gallery boxes pit  I'll back my Harlequin against your wit  Yet still the Author anxious for his play  Shook his wise headWhat will the critics say  As usual Sirabuse you all they can  And what the ladiesHe's a charming man  A charming pieceOne scarce knows what it means  But that's no matterwhere there's such sweet scenes  Still he persistsand let him  entre nous    I know your tastes and will indulge 'em too  Change you shall have so set your hearts at ease  Write as  he  will we'll act it as  you  please  PERSONS Represented  Sir JOHN DORILANT a Man of nice Honour Guardian to Caelia Mr GARRICK  MODELY Men of the Town Mr PALMER  BELMOUR Men of the Town Mr OBRIEN  An old Steward to Sir John Dorilant Mr CASTLE  Footman to Sir John Dorilant Mr FOX  Lady BEVERLEY a Widow Lady Mother to Caelia Mrs CLIVE  CAELIA Daughter to Lady Beverley and Ward to Sir John Mrs CIBBER  ARAMINTA Sister to Sir John Do∣rilant Mrs YATES  SCENE a Garden belonging to Sir John Dorilant's House in the Country with an Arbour Garden Chairs c  THE School for LOVERS  ACT I  SCENE  the Garden  Enter  ARAMINTA  with an affected Careless∣ness and knotting  MODELY  following  MODELY  BUT madam  ARAMINTA  But Sir what can possibly have alarmed you thus You see me quite unconcerned I only tell you in a plain simple narrative manner this plaguy thread and merely by way of conver∣sation that you are in love with Caelia and where is the mighty harm in all this  MODELY  The harm in it madam have I not told you a  thousand and a thousand times that you were the only woman who could possibly make me happy  ARAMINTA  Why aye to be sure you have and sworn a thousand and a thousand oaths to confirm that as∣sertion  MODELY  And am not I here now expressly to marry you  ARAMINTA  Why that  too  is truebutyou are in love with Caelia  MODELY  Bless me madam what can I say to you If it had not been for my attendance upon you I had never known Caelia or her mother either though they are both my relations The mother has since indeed put some kind of confidence in me she is a widow you know  ARAMINTA  And wants consolation The poor orphan too her daughter Well charity is an excellent virtue I never considered it in that light before You are vastly charitable Mr Modely  MODELY  It is impossible to talk with youIf you will not do me justice do it to yourself at least Is there any comparison betwixt you and Caelia Could any man of sense hesitate a moment She has yet no character One does not know what she is or what she will be a chit a green girl of fourteen or fifteen  ARAMINTA  Seventeen at leastI cannot undo this knot  MODELY  Well let her be seventeen Would any man of  judgment attach himself to a girl of that age O' my soul if one was to make love to her she would hardly understand what one meant  ARAMINTA  Girls are not quite so ignorant as you may ima∣gine Mr Modely Caelia will understand you take my word for it and does understand you As to your men of judgment and sense here is my brother now I take him to be full as reasonable as yourself and somewhat older and yet with all his philosophy he has brought himself to a de∣termination at last to fulfill the father's will and marry this green girl I am sorry to tell you so Mr Modely but he will certainly marry her  MODELY  Let him marry her I should perhaps do it my∣self if I was in his place He was an intimate friend of her father's She is a great fortune and was given to him by will But do you imagine my dear Araminta that if he was left to his own choice without any bias he would not rather have a woman nearer his own years He might al∣most be her father  ARAMINTA  That is true But you will find it difficult to persuade me that youth in a woman is so insur∣mountable an objection I fancy Mr Modely it may be got over Suppose I leave you to think of itI cannot get this right  Going  MODELY  Stay dear Araminta why will you plague me thus Your own charms my earnestness might prove to you  ARAMINTA  I tell you I don't want proofs  MODELY  Well well you shall have none then But give me leave to hope since you have done me the honour to be a little uneasy on my account  ARAMINTA  UneasyI uneasy What does the man mean I was a little concerned indeed to give you uneasiness by informing you of my brother's in∣tended marriage with Caelia Butthis shuttle bends so abominably  MODELY  Thou perplexing tyrant Nay you shall not goMay I continue to adore you you must not forbid me that  ARAMINTA  For my part I neither command nor forbid any thing Only this I would have you remember I have quick eyes Your servantI wish this knotting had never come in fashion  Exit Araminta  MODELY  Quick eyes indeed I thought my cunning here had been a master piece The girl cannot have told sure and the mother is entirely on my side They certainly were those inquisitive eyes she speaks of which have found out this secret Well I must be more cautious for the future and act the lover to Araminta ten times stronger than ever One would not give her up till one was sure of suc∣ceeding in the other place  Enter  BELMOUR  from behind with a Book in his Hand  BELMOUR  Ha ha ha well said Modely  MODELY  starting  Belmour how the duce came you here  BELMOUR  How came I here How came you here if you come to that A man can't retire from the noise and bustle of the world to admire the beauties of the spring and read pastoral in an arbour but impertinent lovers must disturb his meditations Thou art the errantest hypocrite Modely  Throwing away the book  MODELY  HypocriteMy dear friend we men of gal∣lantry must be soBut have a care we may have other listeners for aught I know who may not be so proper for confidantes  Looking about  BELMOUR  You may be easy on that head We have the garden to ourselves The widow and her daughter are just gone in and Sir John is busy with his steward  MODELY  The widow and her daughter Why were they in the garden  BELMOUR  They just came into it but upon seeing you and Araminta together they turned back again  MODELY  On seeing me and Araminta I hope I have no jealousies there too However I am glad Caelia knows I am in the garden because it may probably induce her to fall in my way by chance you know and give me an opportunity of talking to her  BELMOUR  Do you think she likes you  MODELY  She does not know what she does  BELMOUR  Do you like her  MODELY  Why faith I think I do  BELMOUR  Why then do you pursue your affair with Ara∣minta and not find some honourable means of breaking off with her  MODELY  That might not be quite so expedient I think Araminta the finest woman and Caelia the prettiest girl I know Now they are both good fortunes and one of them I am resolved to have but which  BELMOUR  Your great wisdom has not yet determined Thou art undoubtedly the vainest fellow living I thought you brought me down here now to your wedding  MODELY  'Egad I thought so too but this plaguy little rustic has disconcerted all my schemes Sir John you know by her father's will may marry her if he pleases and she forfeits her estate if she marries any one else Now I am contriving to bring it about that I may get her and her fortune too  BELMOUR  A very likely business truly So you modestly expect that Sir John Dorilant should give up his mistress and then throw her fortune into the bat∣gain as an additional reward to the obliging man who has seduced her from him  MODELY  Hum why I don't expect quite that But you know Belmour he is a man of honour and would not force her inclinations tho' he loved her to dis∣traction Come come he is quite a different creature from what you and I are  BELMOUR  Speak for yourself good Sir yet why should you imagine that her inclinations are not as likely to fix upon him as you He has a good person and is scarce older than yourself  MODELY  That shews your ignorance I am ten years younger than he is My dress and the company I keep give a youth and vivacity to me which he must always want An't I a man of the town O that town Belmour Could I but have met these ladies there I had done the business  BELMOUR  Were they never there  MODELY  NeverSir Harry Beverley the father of this girl lived always in the country and divided his time between his books and his hounds His wife and daughter seldom mixed with people of their own rank but at a horserace or a rural visit And see the effects The girl tho' she is naturally genteel has an air of simplicity  BELMOUR  But does not want sense  MODELY  No noShe has a devilish deal of that kind of sense which is acquired by early reading I have heard her talk occasionally like a queen in a tragedy or at least like a sentimental lady in a comedy  much above your misses of thirty in town I assure youAs to the motherBut she is a charac∣ter and explains herself  BELMOUR  Yes yes I have read her But pray how came it to pass that the father who was of a different way of thinking in regard to party should have left Sir John guardian to his daughter with the addi∣tional clause too of her being obliged to marry him  MODELY  Why that is somewhat surprizing But the truth of the case was they were thoroughly acquainted and each considered party as the foible of the other Sir Harry thought a good husband his daughter's best security for happiness and he knew it was im∣possible Sir John Dorilant should prove a bad one  BELMOUR  And yet this prospect of happiness would you destroy  MODELY  No no I only see farther than Sir Harry did and would increase that happiness by giving her a better husband  BELMOUR  O your humble servant Sir  MODELY  Besides the mother is entirely in my interest and by the by has a hankering after Sir John herself  He is a sober man and should have a woman of discretion for his wife not a hoydening girl  'Egad Belmour suppose you attacked the widow The woman is young enough and has an excellent jointure  BELMOUR  And so became your fatherinlaw  MODELY  You will have an admirable opportunity to∣night we are to have the fiddles you know and you may dance with her  When musick softens and when dancing fires Eh Belmour  BELMOUR  You are vastly kind to Sir John and would ease him I find of both his mistresses But suppose this man of honour should be fool enough to resign his mistress may not another kind of honour oblige him to run you through the body for deserting his sister  MODELY  Why faith it may However it is not the first duel I have fought on such an occasion so I am his man Not that it is impossible but he may have scruples there too  BELMOUR  You don't think him a coward  MODELY  I know he is not But your reasoning men have strange distinctions They are quite different crea∣tures as I told you from you and I  BELMOUR  You are pleased to compliment But suppose now as irrational as you think me I should find out a means to make this whole affair easy to you  MODELY  How do you mean  BELMOUR  Not by attacking the widow but by making my addresses in good earnest to Araminta  MODELY  I forbid that absolutely  BELMOUR  What do you think it possible I should suc∣ceed after the accomplished Mr Modely  MODELY  Why faith between you and I I think not but I don't chuse to hazard it  BELMOUR  Then you love her still  MODELY  I confess it  BELMOUR  And it is nothing upon earth but that insati∣able vanity of yours with a little tincture of ava∣rice that leads you a gadding thus  MODELY  I plead guilty But be it as it will I am deter∣mined to pursue my point And see where the little rogue comes most opportunely I told you she would be here Go go Belmour you must not listen to all my love scenes  Exit Belmour  Now for a serious face a little upon the tragic young girls are mighty fond of despairing lovers  Enter  CAELIA  CAELIA  with an affected surprize  Mr Modelyare you hereI am come to meet my mamaI did not think to find you here  MODELY  Are you sorry to find me here madam  CAELIA  Why should I be sorry Mr Modely  MODELY  May I hope you are pleased with it  CAELIA  I have no dislike to company  MODELY  But is all company alike Surely one would chuse one's companions Would it have been the same thing to you if you had met Sir John Dorilant here  CAELIA  I should be very ungrateful if I did not like Sir John Dorilant's company I am sure I have all the obligations in the world to him and so had my poor papa  Sighing  MODELY  Whatever were your papa's obligations his gratitude I am sure was unboundedO that I had been his friend  CAELIA  Why should you wish that Mr Modely You would have had a great loss in him  MODELY  I believe I should But I might likewise have had a consolation for that loss which would have contained in it all earthly happiness  CAELIA  I don't understand you  MODELY  He might have left his Caelia to me  CAELIA  Dear how you talk  MODELY  Talk madam O I could talk for ever would you but listen to my heart's soft language nor cruelly affect to disbelieve when I declare I love you  CAELIA  Love  me  Mr ModelyAre not you in love with Araminta  MODELY  I once thought I was  CAELIA  And do lovers ever change  MODELY  Not those who feel a real passion But there are false alarms in love which the unpractised heart sometimes mistakes for true ones  CAELIA  And were yours such for Araminta  MODELY  Alas I feel they were  Looking earnestly at her  CAELIA  You don't intend to marry her then I hope  MODELY  Do you hope I should not marry her  CAELIA  To be sure I do I would not have the poor lady deceived and I would willingly have a better opinion of Mr Modely than to believe him ca∣pable of making false protestations  MODELY  To you he never could  CAELIA  To meI am out of the questionBut I am sorry for Araminta for I believe she loves you  MODELY  If you can pity those who love in vain why am not I an object of compassion  CAELIA  Dear Mr Modely why will you talk thus My hand you know is destined to Sir John Do∣rilant  and my duty there does not even permit me to think of other lovers  MODELY  Happy happy man Yet give me leave to ask one question madamI dread to do it tho' my last glimpse of happiness depends upon your answer  CAELIA  What questionNay pray speak I intreat it of you  MODELY  Then tell me lovely Caelia sincerely tell me were your choice left free and did it depend upon you only to determine who should be the master of your affections might I expect one favourable thought  CAELIA  after some hesitation  Itit does not depend upon me  MODELY  I know it does not but if it did  CAELIA  Come come Mr Modely I cannot talk upon this subject Impossibilities are impossibilities But I hope you will acquaint Araminta instantly with this change in your inclinations  MODELY  I would do it but I dare not  CAELIA  You should break it first to Sir John  MODELY  My difficulty does not lie in the breaking it but if I confess my passion at an end I must no longer expect admittance into this family and I could still wish to talk to Caelia as a friend  CAELIA  Indeed Mr Modely I should be loth myself to lose your acquaintance but O here comes my mama she may put you in a method  Enter  LADY BEVERLEY  LADY  In any method my dear which decency and reserve will permit Your servant cousin Modely What you are talking strangely to this girl now O you men  MODELY  Your ladyship knows the sincerity of my passion here  CAELIA  with surprize  Knows your sincerity  LADY  Well well what signifies what I know You was mentioning some method I was to put you in  CAELIA  Mr Modely madam has been confessing to me that he no longer loves Araminta  LADY  Humwhy such things may happen child We are not all able to govern our affections But I hope if he breaks off with her he will do it with decency  MODELY  That madam is the difficulty  LADY  WhatIs it a difficulty to be decent Fie fie Mr Modely  MODELY  Far be it from me even to think so madam before a person of your ladyship's reserved beha∣viour But considering how far I have gone in the affair  LADY  Well well if that be all I may perhaps help you out and break it to Sir John myselfNot that I approve of roving affections I assure you  MODELY  You bind me ever to youBut there is ano∣ther cause which you alone can promote and on which my eternal happiness  LADY  Leave usleave us cousin Modely I must not hear you talk in this extravagant manner  Pushing him towards the scene and then aside to him  I shall bring it about better in your absence Go go man go  Exit Modely  A pretty kind of a fellow reallyNow Caelia come nearer child I have something of impor∣tance to say to youWhat do you think of that gentleman  CAELIA  Of Mr Modely madam  LADY  Ay Mr Modely my cousin Modely  CAELIA  Think of him madam  LADY  Ay think of him child you are old enough to think sure after the education I have given you Well what answer do you make  CAELIA  I really don't understand your Ladyship's ques∣tion  LADY  Not understand me child Why I ask you how you like Mr Modely What should you think of him as a husband  CAELIA  Mr Modely as a husband Why surely madam Sir John  LADY  Fiddle faddle Sir John Sir John knows better things than to plague himself with a wife in lead∣ing strings  CAELIA  Is your ladyship sure of that  LADY  O ho would you be glad to have me sure of it  CAELIA  I don't know what I should be glad of I would not give Sir John a moment's pain to be mistress of the whole world  LADY  But if it should be brought about without giv∣ing him pain Hey Caelia  Patting her cheek with her fan  CAELIA  I should be sorry for it  LADY  Hey day  CAELIA  For then he must think lightly of me  LADY  What does the girl mean Come come I must enter roundly into this affair Here here sit down and tell me plainly and honestly without equivoca∣tion or reservation is Modely indifferent to you Nay naylook me in the face turn your eyes to∣wards me One judges greatly by the eyes espe∣cially in a woman Your poor papa used to say that my eyes reasoned better than my tongue Well and now tell me without blushing is Modely indifferent to you  CAELIA  I fear he is not madam and it is that which perplexes me  LADY  How do you feel when you meet him  CAELIA  Fluttered  LADY  Hum While you are with him  CAELIA  Fluttered  LADY  Hum When you leave him  CAELIA  Fluttered still  LADY  Strong symptoms truly  CAELIA  When Sir John Dorilant talks to me my heart is softened but not perplexed My esteem my gratitude overflows towards him I consider him as a kinder father with all the tenderness without the authority  LADY  But when Mr Modely talks  CAELIA  My tranquility of mind is gone I am pleased with hearing what I doubt is flattery and when he grasps my hand  LADY  Well well I know all thatBe decent child You need say no more Mr Modely is the man  Rising  CAELIA  But dear Madam there are a thousand obstacles I am afraid Sir John loves me I am sure he esteems me and I would not forfeit his esteem for the universe I am certain I can make him an af∣fectionate and an humble wife and I think I can forget Mr Modely  LADY  Forget a fiddle Don't talk to me of forgetting I order you on your duty not to forget Mr Modely is and shall be the man You may trust my prudence for bringing it about I will talk with Sir John instantlyI know what you are going to say but I will not hear a word of it Can you imagine Caelia that I shall do any thing but with the utmost decency and decorum  CAELIA  I know you will not madam but there are de∣licacies  LADY  With which I am unacquainted to be sure and my daughter must instruct me in them Pray Caelia where did you learn this nicety of sentiments Who was it that inspired them  CAELIA  But the maxims of the world  LADY  Are altered I suppose since I was of your age Poor thing what world hast thou seen Notwith∣standing your delicacies and your maxims Sir John perhaps may be wiser than you imagine and chuse a wife of somewhat more experience  CAELIA  May he be happy wherever he chusesBut dear madam  LADY  Again don't make me angry I will positively not be instructed Ay you may well blush Nay no tearsCome come Caelia I forgive you I had idle delicacies myself once Lard I remember when your poor papa he he he but we have no time for old stories What would you say now if Sir John himself should propose it and persuade the match and yet continue as much your friend as ever nay become more so a nearer friend  CAELIA  In such a case madam  LADY  I understand you and will about it instantly B'ye Caelia O how its little heart flutters  Exit Lady  CAELIA  It does indeed A nearer friend I hardly know whether I should wish her success or not Sir John is so affectionate Would I had never seen Mr Modely Araminta too what will she say O I see a thousand bad consequences I must follow her and prevent them  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  continues  LADY BEVERLEY  and  MODELY  LADY  PRITHEE don't teize me so I vow cousin Modely you are almost as peremptory as my daughter She truly was teaching me decorum just now and plaguing me with her delicacies and her stuff I tell you Sir John will be in the gar∣den immediately this is always his hour of walk∣ing and when he comes I shall lay the whole affair before him with all its concatenation of cir∣cumstances and I warrant you bring it about  MODELY  I have no doubt madam of the transcendency of your ladyship's rhetorick it is on that I entirely rely But I must beg leave to hint that Araminta already suspects my passion and should it be openly declared would undoubtedly prevail that instant with her brother to forbid me the house  LADY  Why that might be  MODELY  And tho' I told your daughter I did not care how soon it came to an eclaircisment yet a woman of your ladyship's penetration and knowledge of  the world must see the necessity of concealing it at least for a time I beg pardon for offering what may have even the distant appearance of instruction But it is Sir John's delicacy which must be princi∣pally alarmed with apprehensions of her disregard for him and I am sure your ladyship's manner of doing it will shew him where he might much better place his affections and with an undoubted prospect of happiness  LADY  Ay now you talk to the purposeBut stay is not that Sir John coming this wayIt is I vow and Araminta with him We'll turn down this walk and reason the affair a little more and then I will come round the garden upon him  Modely takes her hand to lead her out  You are very gallant cousin Modely  Exeunt  Enter  SIR JOHN DORILANT  and  ARAMINTA  ARAMINTA  What do you drag me into the garden for We were private enough where we wereand I hate walking  SIR JOHN  Forgive me my dear sister I am restless every where my head and heart are full of nothing but this lovely girl  ARAMINTA  My dear dear brother you are enough to spoil any woman in the universe I tell you again and again the girl is a good girl an excellent girl and will make an admirable wife You may trust one woman in her commendations of another we are  not apt to be too favourable in our judgments especially when there is beauty in the case  SIR JOHN  You charm me when you talk thus If she is really all this how happy must the man be who can engage her affections But alas Araminta in every thing which regards me it is duty not love which actuates her behaviour She steals away my very soul by her attentions but never once expresses that heartfelt tenderness those sym∣pathetic feelings  ARAMINTA  Haha haO my stars Sympathetic feelingsWhy would you have a girl of her age have those sympathetic feelings as you call them If she had take my word for it she would coquet it with half the fellows in town before she had been married a twelvemonth Besides Sir John you don't consider that you was her father's friend she has been accustomed from her infancy to respect you in that light and our fathers friends you know are always old people grey beards philoso∣phers enemies to youth and the destruction of gayety  SIR JOHN  But I was never such  ARAMINTA  You may imagine so but you always had a grave turn I hated you once myself  SIR JOHN  Dear Araminta  ARAMINTA  I did as I hope to live for many a time has your aversion to dancing hindered me from having a fiddleBy the by remember we are to have the fiddles  tonightBut let that pass As the case now stands if I was not already so near akin to you you have the temper in the world which I should chuse in a husband  SIR JOHN  That is obliging however  ARAMINTA  Not so very obliging perhaps neither It would be merely for my own sake for then would I have the appearance of the most obedient sympathetic wife in the universe and yet be as despotic in my govern∣ment as an eastern monarch And when I grew tired as I probably should do of a want of contradiction why I should find an easy remedy for that too I could break your heart in about a month  SIR JOHN  Don't trifle with me 'tis your serious advice I want give it me honestly as a friend and ten∣derly as a sister  ARAMINTA  Why I have done it fifty times What can I say more If you will have it again you must This then it is in plain termsBut you are sure you are heartily in love with her  SIR JOHN  Pshaw  ARAMINTA  Well then that we will take for granted and now you want to know what is right and proper for you to do in the case Why was I in your place I should make but short work with it She knows the circumstances of her father's will therefore would I go immediately to her tell her how my heart stood inclined and hope she had no objections to comply with what it is not in her power to refuse  SIR JOHN  You would not have me talk thus abruptly to her  ARAMINTA  Indeed I would It will save a world of trouble She will blush perhaps at first and look a little aukward and by the by so will you too but if she is the girl I take her for after a little irresolute gesture and about five minutes conversation she will drop you a curtesy with the demure humility of a Vestal and tell you it shall be as you and her mama pleases  SIR JOHN  O that it were come to that  ARAMINTA  And pray what hinders it Nothing upon earth but your consummate prudence and discretion  SIR JOHN  I cannot think of marrying her till I am sure she loves me  ARAMINTA  Lud Ludwhy what does that signify If she consents is not that enough  SIR JOHN  Her gratitude may induce her to consent rather than make me unhappy  ARAMINTA  You would absolutely make a woman mad  SIR JOHN  Why could you think of marrying a man who had no regard for you  ARAMINTA  The case is widely different my good casuistical brother and perhaps I could not unless I was very much in love with him  SIR JOHN  And could you then  ARAMINTA  Yes I couldto tell you the truth I believe I shall  SIR JOHN  What do you mean  ARAMINTA  I shall not tell youYou have business enough of your own upon your hands  SIR JOHN  Have you any doubts of Modely  ARAMINTA  I shall keep them to myself if I have For you are a wretched counsellor in a love case  SIR JOHN  But dear Araminta  ARAMINTA  But dear Sir John Dorilant you may make your∣self perfectly easy for you shall positively know no∣thing of my affairs As to your own if you do not instantly resolve to speak to Caelia I will go and talk to her myself  SIR JOHN  Stay lady Beverley is coming towards us  ARAMINTA  And has left my swain yonder by himself  SIR JOHN  Suppose I break it to her  ARAMINTA  It is not a method which I should advise but do as you pleaseI know that horrid woman's sen∣timents very exactly and I shall be glad to have her teized a little  Aside  I'll give you an op∣portunity  by leaving you and so adieu my dear sentimental brother  We'll change partners if you please madam  To lady Beverley as she enters And then exit to Modely  LADY BEVERLEY  Poor mistaken creature how fond the thing is  Aside and looking after Araminta  Your servant Sir John  SIR JOHN  Your ladyship's most obedient  After some irresolute gesture on both sides lady Beverley speaks  LADY  I I have wanted an opportunity of speaking to you Sir John a great while  SIR JOHN  And I madam have long had an affair of conse∣quence to propose to your ladyship  LADY  An affair of consequence to me O Lud you will please to speak Sir  SIR JOHN  Not till I have heard your ladyship's com∣mands  LADY  What must women speak first Fie Sir John  looking languishingly  Well then the matter in short is this I have been long thinking how to dis∣pose of my girl properly She is grown a woman you see and tho' I who am her mother say it has her allurements  SIR JOHN  Uncommon ones indeed  LADY  Now I would willingly consult with you how to get her well married before she is tainted with the indecorums of the world  SIR JOHN  It was the very subject which I proposed speak∣ing to you upon I am sorry to put your lady∣ship in mind of a near and dear lossBut you re∣member Sir Harry's will  LADY  Yes yes I remember it very well Poor man it was undoubtedly the only weak thing he was ever guilty of  SIR JOHN  Madam  LADY  I say Sir John we must pardon the sailings of our deceased friends Indeed his affection for his child excuses it  SIR JOHN  Excuses it  LADY  Yes indeed does it His fondness for her might naturally make him wish to place her with a person of your known excellence of character for my own part had I died I should have wished it myselfI don't believe you have your equal in the world Nay dear Sir John 'tis no complimentThis I say might make him not attend to the impropriety of the thing and the reluctance a gentleman of your good sense and judgment must undoubtedly have to accede to so unsuitable a treaty Especially as he could not but know there were women of discre∣tion in the world who would be proud of an al∣liance where the prospect of felicity was so inviting and unquestionable  SIR JOHN who had appeared uneasy all the time she was speaking  What women madam I know of none  LADY  Sir JohnThat is not quite so complaisant me∣thinksto our sex I mean  SIR JOHN  I beg your pardon madam I hardly know what I say Your ladyship has disconcerted every thing I was going to propose to you  LADY  Bless me Sir JohnI disconcerted every thing How pray I have been only talking to you in an open friendly manner with regard to my daughter our daughter indeed I might call her for you have been a father to her The girl herself always speaks of you as such  SIR JOHN  Speaks of me as a father  LADY  Why more unlikely things have happened Sir John  SIR JOHN  Than what madam  LADY  Dear Sir JohnYou put such peremptory ques∣tions you might easily understand what one meant methinks  SIR JOHN  I find madam I must speak plain at once Know then my heart my soul my every thought of happiness is fixed upon that lovely girl  LADY  O astonishing Well miracles are not ceased that's certain But every body they say must do a foolish  thing once in their livesAnd can you really and seriously think of putting Sir Harry's will in execution  SIR JOHN  Would I could  LADY  To be sure the girl has a fine fortune  SIR JOHN  Fortune I despise it I would give it with all my soul to any one who could engage me her af∣fectionsFortune dirt  LADY  I am thunderstruck  SIR JOHN  Turning eagerly to her  O madam tell me sincerely tell me what me∣thod can I possibly pursue to make her think fa∣vourably of me You know her inmost soul you know the tender moments of address the easy avenues to her unpractised heart Be kind and point them out  Grasping her hand  LADY  I vow Sir John I don't know what to say to you Let go my hand You talked of my disconcerting you just now I am sure you dis∣concert me with a witness  Aside  I did not think the man had so much rapture in him He squeezed my hand with such an emphasis I may gain him perhaps at last  SIR JOHN  Why will you not speak madam Can you see me on the brink of desperation and not lend a friend∣ly hand to my assistance  LADY  I have it  Aside  Alas Sir John what  signifies what I can do Can I answer for the incli∣nations of a giddy girl  SIR JOHN  You know she is not such her innocent mind is yet untainted with the follies of her sex And if a life devoted to her service without a wish but what regards her happiness can win her to be mine  LADY  Why that might go a great way with an unpre∣judiced mind But when a first passion has taken place  SIR JOHN  With amazement  What do you mean  LADY  To tell you the truth I am afraid the girl is not so untainted as you imagine  SIR JOHN  You distract me Howwhen whom can she have seen  LADY  Undoubtedly there is a man  SIR JOHN  Tell me who that I may No that I may give her to him and make her happy whatever be∣comes of me  LADY  That is generous indeedSo so  Aside  SIR JOHN  But 'tis impossible I have observed all her mo∣tions all her attentions with a lover's eye incapa∣ble of erringYet stay has any body written to her  LADY  There are no occasion for letters when people are in the same house together  SIR JOHN  Confusion  LADY  I was going to offer some proposals to you but your strange declaration stopped me short  SIR JOHN  You proposals YouAre you her a better in the affair O madam what un∣pardonable crime have I committed against you that you should thus conspire my ruin Have not I always behaved to you like a friend a brother I will not call you ungrateful  LADY  Mercy on us The man raves How could it possibly enter into my head or the girl's either that you had any serious thoughts of marrying her But I see you are too much discomposed at present to admit of calm reasoning So I shall take some other opportunityFriendBrother Un∣gratefulMarry come up I hope at least you will not think of forcing the poor girl's inclinations Ungrateful indeed  Exit in a passion  SIR JOHN  Not for the universeStay madamShe is gone But it is no matter I am but little dis∣posed for altercation now Heigh ho Good heaven can so slight an intercourse have effected all this I have scarce ever seen them together O that I had been born with Belmour's happy ta∣lents of address Address 'tis absolute ma∣gick 'tis fascination Alas 'tis the rapidity of real passion Why did Modely bring him hither to his wedding Every thing has conspired against me He brought him and the delay of the lawyers has kept him here Had I taken Araminta's advice a poor fortnight ago it had not been in the power of fate to have undone me And yet she might  have seen him afterwards which would at least have made her duty uneasy to herHeigh ho  Enter  ARAMINTA  and  MODELY  ARAMINTA  Entering  I tell you I heard them very loud and I will see what is the matter O here is my brother alone  SIR JOHN  Taking her tenderly by the hand  O AramintaI am lost beyond redemption  ARAMINTA  Dear brother what can have happened to you  SIR JOHN  Turning to Modely  Mr Modely you could not intend it but you have ruined me  MODELY  Alarmed  I Sir John  SIR JOHN  You have brought a friend with you who has pierced me to the very soul  MODELY  Belmour  SIR JOHN  He has stolen my Caelia's affections from me  ARAMINTA  Looking slyly at Modely  Belmour  MODELY  This must he a mistake but I'll humour it  Aside  It cannot be who can have told you so  SIR JOHN  Her mother has been this instant with me to make proposals on the subject  MODELY  For Belmour  SIR JOHN  She did not absolutely mention his name but I  could not mistake it For she told me the favoured lover was under the same roof with us  MODELY  A little disconcerted  I could not have believed it of him  ARAMINTA  Nor do I yet  Looking slyly again at Modely  MODELY  There must certainly be some mistake in it at the worst I am sure I can prevail so far with Bel∣mour as to make him drop his pretensions  SIR JOHN  You cannot make her cease to love him  Sighing  MODELY  Time may easily get the better of so young a passion  SIR JOHN  Never never she is too sincere too delicately sensible  MODELY  Come come you must not think so it is not yet gone so far but that it may be totally forgotten Now for a masterstroke to clench the whole  Aside  In the mean time Sir John I have the satisfaction of acquainting you that my affair with Araminta's leave draws very near a conclusion The lawyers have finished their papers and I only now wait for your perusal of them  ARAMINTA  Aside  Well said  MODELY  I ordered the writings to be laid upon your table  ARAMINTA  Aside  What does he mean  SIR JOHN  Dear Mr Modely you shall not wait a moment for me I will dispatch them instantly I feel the  want of happiness too severely myself to postpone it in others I leave you with my sister when she names the day you may depend upon my concur∣rence  Exit Sir John  MODELY and ARAMINTA look at one ano∣ther for some time then he speaks  I hope madam you are now convinced of my sincerity  ARAMINTA  I am absolutely struck dumb with your assurance  MODELY  With an affected surprize  Madam  ARAMINTA  You cannot mean all this  MODELY  Why not madam  ARAMINTA  Why don't you know that I know  MODELY  I cannot help a lady's knowledge or imagina∣tions All I know is that it is in your power to make me either the happiest or most miserable man in the whole creation  ARAMINTA  Well this is astonishing  MODELY  I am sorry madam that any unguarded behavi∣our of mine any little playful gallantries should have occasioned surmises which  ARAMINTA  Serious as I hope to live  MODELY  Is it not enough to make one serious when the woman one has pursued for years almost with ado∣ration is induced by mere appearances to doubt  the honourableness of one's intentions Have you not heard me this moment apply to your brother even in the midst of his uneasinessI little ex∣pected where the difficulty would lie  ARAMINTA  Well well poor thing I won't teize it any lon∣ger here there take my hand  MODELY  Duped by Jupiter  Aside  O my ever∣lasting treasure And when and when shall I be happy  ARAMINTA  It shall depend upon yourself  MODELY  Tomorrow then my angel be the day O Araminta I cannot speak my transportAnd did you really think that I was in love with Caelia  ARAMINTA  Why as a proof of my future sincerity I must confess I did  MODELY  I wonder how you could  ARAMINTA  Come come there were grounds enough for a woman in love to go upon  MODELY  taking her by the hand  But you are now perfectly easy  ARAMINTA  pulling her hand from him  Why yes I think I amBut what can my brother mean about Belmour  MODELY  It is some trick of the widow's  ARAMINTA  I dare say she meant you  MODELY  Possibly she might you know her motives  ARAMINTA  Yes yes her passion for my brother is pretty no∣torious But the wretch will be mistakenTo∣morrow you say  MODELY  Tomorrow my adorable  ARAMINTA  It shall be as you pleaseBut my situation is so terribly aukward that I must break from you Adieu  Exit Araminta  MODELY  Upon my soul she is a fine woman and loves me to distraction and what is still more I most un∣doubtedly love herI have a good mind to take herYet not to have it in my power to suc∣ceed in the other place would call my parts in questionNo no I must not disparage my parts neitherIn order to be a great character one should go as near being a rogue as possible I have a philosopher's opinion on my side in that and the practice of half the heroes and politicians in Europe  END of the SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE  continues  BELMOUR  alone  CAELIA in love with me Egad the thing is not impossible my friend Modely may have been a little mistaken Sir John was very serious when he told me of it and though I protested to him that I had never made the least advances he still persisted in his opinionThe girl must have have told him so herselfLet me recollect a little She is always extremely civil to me but that indeed she is to every bodyI do not remember any thing particular in her looks but I shall watch them more narrowly the next time I see herShe is very handsome and yet in my opi∣nion notwithstanding Modely's infidelity Ara∣minta is much the finer womanSuppose No that will not do  Enter  MODELY  MODELY  So so Mr Belmour I imagined I should find you here this is the lover's corner We have all had our reveries in it But why don't you talk louder man You ought at least to give me my revenge in that My soliloquies you know are easily overheard  BELMOUR  I never designedly overheard them Mr Modely nor did I make any improper use of the accident  MODELY  Grave very grave and perfectly moral And so this is all I am to have for the loss of my mis∣tressHeigh ho  Then I must be content to see her bless  Yon happier youth  BELMOUR  Your raillery is a little unseasonable Mr Mode∣ly for to speak plainly I begin to suspect that this is some trick of yours to dupe me as well as Sir John Dorilant  MODELY  Upon my honour no if we must be serious it may be a mistake but not intended on my side I can assure you Come come if the girl really likes you take her If I should prove the happy man give me joy and there's an end of it  BELMOUR  I fancy you are used to disappointments in love they sit so easy upon you Or rather I should sup∣pose in this case you are pretty sure of your ground  MODELY  Neither upon my soul but a certain  Je ne scai quoy  a  Gayete de Coeur  which carries me above misfortunes some people call it vanity  BELMOUR  And are not absolutely mistaken But what becomes of Araminta all this while  MODELY  yawning  I shall marry her I believe tomorrow  BELMOUR  Marry her  MODELY  Yes Sir John is at this very moment looking over the settlements  BELMOUR  I don't understand you  MODELY  And yet it is pretty plain methinks I tell you I am to be married tomorrow Was it not time to make sure of one mistress when you was running away with the other  BELMOUR  You know I have no such intentionsBut are you really serious Have you laid aside your designs upon Caelia  MODELY  Not so neither  BELMOUR  What do you mean then by your marriage with Araminta Why won't you unriddle this affair to me  MODELY  Because it is at present a riddle to myself and I expect lady Beverley here every moment to resolve the enigma  BELMOUR  Was it a scheme of her's  MODLEY  Certainly and I partly guess it but will not un∣bosom till I know it fullyCome come with all that gravity of countenance and curiosity you must leave me instantly the lady will be here and the plot unravelled and then  BELMOUR  I shall expect to be satisfied  Exit  MODELY  Ha ha ha or else you fight me I suppose Why so you may and so may Sir John Dorilant too and faith with some colour of reason But my comfort is that I have experience on my side and if I survive the rencounter I shall be a greater hero than ever amongst the ladies and be esteemed in all companies as much a man of honour as the best of you  Enter  LADY BEVERLEY  LADY  Dear cousin Modely I am all over in an agita∣tion we shall certainly be discovered that devil Araminta  MODELY  What of her madam  LADY  Is now with her brother talking so eagerly Oh I saw the villainous changes in her counte∣nance I would have given the world to have over∣heard their conversationCome come you must advise me instantly  MODELY  Your ladyship must first let me into the secret I am absolutely in a wood with regard to the whole affair What is all this of Caelia and Belmour  LADY  Nothing nothing at all an errant dilemma of the foolish man's own making which his imper∣tinent sister will immediately clear up to him and then all must out  MODELY  But how came Belmour ever to be mentioned in the case  LADY  Dear dear he never was mentioned I must confess that I was so provoked with Sir John's un∣natural behaviour that I could not help telling him that Caelia had a lover and in the house too Your situation with regard to Araminta made him never dream of you and consequently all his suspicions turned on Belmour  MODELY  But you did not say that that lover had made his addresses to Caelia  LADY  I don't know what I might say for he used me like a Turk But whatever I said I can unsay it again  MODELY  Why if I might venture to advice a person of your lady's sagacity  LADY  O ay with all my heart cousin Modely For though I may say it without vanity that nobody has a more clear apprehension of things when the mental faculty is totally undisturbed yet when I am in a trepidation nobody upon earth can be more glad of advice  MODELY  Why then madam to speak with reverence I should hope your ladyship would see the necessity of keeping me as concealed as possible It is the young lady's passion not mine which must have the principal influence Sir John Dorilant's pecu∣liarity of temper is such  LADY  Yes yes he has peculiarity enough that's cer∣tain  MODELY  And it is there madam as the weakest part that our attack will be the surest If she confesses an inclination for me not both the Indies added to her fortune could induce him to marry her  LADY  That is honourable however cousin Modely But he is a horrid creature notwithstanding  MODELY  I grant it madam but a failure in an improper pursuit may recal his reason and as he does not want understanding teach him to search for hap∣piness where only it is to be expected  LADY  He he I am so angry with him at present that I really believe I should refuse him  MODELY  Your ladyship must not be too cruel  LADY  Why I confess it is not in my nature but bless me here they comeLet us run down this walk directly for they must not see us to∣gether  Exeunt  Enter  ARAMINTA  and  SIR JOHN DORILANT  ARAMINTA  Come along I say you dragged me into the garden just now and I will command in my turn Talk to her you must and shall The girl has sense and spirit when she is disengaged from that  horrid mother of her's and I have told her you wanted her and in this very spot  SIR JOHN  You cannot feel Araminta what you make me suffer But sooner or later it must come to this and therefore I will assume a resolution and be rid of all my doubts at once  ARAMINTA  I tell you this nonsense about Belmour is merely a phantom of her mother's raising to sound your intentions and promote her own  SIR JOHN  Thus far is certain that Belmour disclaims all knowledge of the affair and with an appearance of sincerity but even that is doubtful Besides they are not his but her inclinations which give me any concern It is the heart I require The life∣less form beauteous as it is would only elude my grasp the shadow of a joy not the reality  ARAMINTA  Dear dear that men had but a little common sense or that one could venture to tell them what one knows of one's own sex I have a good mind to be honestAs I live the girl is coming I'll speed her on the way Courage brother Voila  Exit  SIR JOHN  How shall I begin with herWhat ideots are men when they have a real passion ridiculous beneath contempt  Walks about the stage  Suppose I will not suppose the honest heart shall speak its faithful dictates and if it fails why let it  Enter  CAELIA  CAELIA  with timidity  Araminta tells me Sir that you had something to say to me  SIR JOHN  I have madamCome forward Miss Be∣verleyWould you chuse to sit  They sit down    After some irresolute gesture  You are not afraid of catching cold  CAELIA  Not in the least Sir  SIR JOHN  I know sitting in the open air has that effect upon some peoplebut your youth and con∣stitution Did my sister say any thing concern∣ing the subject I would speak to you upon  CAELIA  She only told me Sir that it was of moment  SIR JOHN  It is of moment indeed CaeliaBut you must not think that I am angry  CAELIA  Angry Sir  SIR JOHN  I don't mean angryI am a little confused but I shall recover myself presently  Rises and Caelia rises too  Nay pray sit Miss Beverley Whatever I feel myself I would not disturb you  Returns to his seat then after a pause goes on  The affair I would speak to you upon is thisYou remember your father perfectly  CAELIA  And ever shall  SIR JOHN  Indeed he was a good man Miss Beverley a virtuous man and felt tenderly for your happi∣ness Those tears become you and yet me∣thinks I would not provoke them When he died he left you to my care  CAELIA  Which alone made his loss supportable  SIR JOHN  Are you sincere in what you say  CAELIA  I should be ungrateful indeed if I was not  SIR JOHN  turning towards her  Nay you are sincerity itselfO Caelia  Taking her by the hand  But I beg your pardon I am assuming a liberty I have no right to take till you allow it  CAELIA  Sir  SIR JOHN  I see I have alarmed youRetire Miss Be∣verleyI'll speak to you some other time  She is going  Caelia Miss Beverley pray come back my dearI am afraid my behaviour is rather too abruptPerhaps too it may dis∣please you  CAELIA  I can be displeased with nothing from you Sir and am ready to obey you be your commands what they will  SIR JOHN  Command Caelia that's a hard word  CAELIA  I am sorry it offends you  SIR JOHN  You know best Caelia whether it ought to of∣fend mewould I could read the sentiments of your heart Mine are but too apparentIn short my dear you know the purport of your father's will dare you fulfil it  CAELIA  To the minutest circumstanceIt is my duty  SIR JOHN  Ah Caelia that word  duty  destroys the obliga∣tion  CAELIA  Sir  SIR JOHN  I don't know how it is but I am afraid to ask you the only question which sincerely answered could make me happyor miserable  Half aside  CAELIA  Let me beg of you sir to ask it freely  SIR JOHN  Well then is your heart your own  O Caelia that hesitation confirms my fears You cannot answer in the affirmative and have too much humanity for what I feel to add to my torments Good God and is it possible that an acquaint∣ance of a few days should entirely obliterate the at∣tentive assiduity the tender anxieties which I have shewn for yearsBut I understand it all too well Mine were the aweful though heartfelt attentions of a parent his the sprightly address of a presum∣ing lover His easy assurance has won upon your affections and what I thought  my  greatest merit has undone me  CAELIA  You were so good sir a little while ago to pity  my confusion pity it now and whilst I lay my heart open before you be again that kind that ge∣nerous friend which I have always found you  SIR JOHN  Go on  CAELIA  It is in vain for me to dissemble an ignorance of your meaning nor would I if I could I own I have been too much pleased with Mr Modely's conver∣sation  SIR JOHN  Modely's  CAELIA  Let me go onHis intended marriage with Araminta gave him a freedom in this family which it was not my business to restrain His attentions to my mother and the friendly manner in which he executed some commissions of consequence to her gave him frequent opportunities of talking to me I will confess too that his appearance and his man∣ner struck me But I was so convinced of his real passion for Araminta that I never dreamt of the least attachment to me till  SIR JOHN  Till what when ModelyWhy he is to be married to my sister tomorrow or next day  CAELIA  I know it was so intended but his behaviour this morning and the intercessions of my mother had I own won upon me strangely and induced me to believe that I only was the object of his pursuits  SIR JOHN  I am thunderstruck  CAELIA  My mother made me clearly perceive that the  completion of his marriage would be an injury to Araminta She told me too sir that you yourself would be my adviser in the affair and even per∣suad me to accept it  SIR JOHN  O the malicious woman  CAELIA  In that indeed I perceive she greatly erred And I only mean this as a confession of what is past and of what is now at an end for everFor the fu∣ture I give myself to your guidance alone and am what you direct  Giving her hand to him  SIR JOHN  Thou amiable softness No Caelia how∣ever miserable I may be myself I will not make you so it was your heart not your hand I aspired to As the former has been seduced from me it would be an injustice to us both to accept of the latter As to Mr Modely and Lady Beverley I have not deserved this treachery from them and they shall both feel my resentment  CAELIA  Sir  SIR JOHN  She told me indeed there was a favoured lover and my suspicions fell very naturally upon Belmour Nay even now nothing but that lovely sincerity which undoes mecould make me credit this vil∣lainy of ModelyO Caelia what a heart have I lost  CAELIA  You cannot shall not lose it worthless as it is 'tis yours and only yours my father guardian lover husband  Hangs upon him weeping  Enter  ARAMINTA  ARAMINTA  Hey day what a scene is here What is the matter with ye both  SIR JOHN  O sister that angel goodness that mirror of her sex has ruined me  ARAMINTA  Ruined you how  SIR JOHN  Nay I am not the only sufferer Modely is as false to you as her mother is to all of us  ARAMINTA  I don't understand you  SIR JOHN  You will too soon My suspicions of Belmour were all a chimaera it is your impious Modely who has possession of her heartTo me she is lost ir∣recoverably  Going  ARAMINTA  Stay brother  SIR JOHN  I cannot my soul's too full  Exit  ARAMINTA  Pray miss Beverley what is the meaning of all this  CAELIA  I cannot speak  Throwing herself into a chair  ARAMINTA  I'll be hang'd if this fellow Modely has not talk∣ed you into an opinion that he is in love with you indeed my dear your youth and inexperience may lead you into strange scrapes and that mother of  yours is enough to turn any girl's head in the uni∣verse Come come unriddle this affair to me  CAELIA  Alas madam▪ all I know is that the only man I ever did or ever can esteem despises me and I fear hates me  ARAMINTA  Hates you he doats upon you to distraction But pray did Modely ever make any serious ad∣dresses to you  CAELIA  Alas but too often  ARAMINTA  The hypocrite but I'll be even with him And your mother I suppose encouraged him An infamous woman But I know her drift well enough  Enter  LADY BEVERLEY  LADY  Where is my poor girl I met Sir John Dori∣lant in such a furious way that he seems to have lost all common civility What have they done to you child  ARAMINTA  Done to her What has your ladyship done to her I knew your little artifices long ago but  LADY  My artifices Mrs Araminta  ARAMINTA  Your artifices lady Beverley but they are all to no purpose the girl has too good an understand∣ing to be imposed upon any longer and your boast∣ed  machinations are as vain and empty in their ef∣fect as in their contrivance  LADY  What does the woman mean But the loss of a lover I suppose is an excuse for illbreeding Poor creature if the petulancy of thy temper would let me I could almost pity thee The loss of a lover is no agreeable thing but women at our time of life Mrs Araminta must not expect a lasting pas∣sion  ARAMINTA  Scarce any at all I believe if they go a wooing themselves For my part I have had the satisfac∣tion of being sollicited however And I am afraid my rustic brother never gave your ladyship's sollici∣tations even the slightest encouragement How was it Did you find him quite hardhearted No bowels of compassion for so accomplished a damsel  CAELIA  interposing  Dear madam dear Araminta  LADY  Stand away child Desert madam is not al∣ways attended with success nor confidence neither There are some women so assured of their conquest as even to disgust a lover on the very day of marriage  ARAMINTA  Was my behaviour ever such  LADY  I really cannot say Mrs Araminta but the world you know is censorious enough when a match is broken off so near its conclusion as gene∣rally to charge the inconstancy of the lover on some defect in his mistress  ARAMINTA  I defy him to produce any  LADY  And yet he has certainly left you  Never ah never to return  ARAMINTA  Insolent  CAELIA  interposing again  Dear Araminta  ARAMINTA  But your ladyship may be mistaken even in that too I may find him at his sollicitations again and if I do  LADY  You'll take him  ARAMINTA  Take him Daggers and poison sooner  LADY  Poor creatureCome Caelia words do but ag∣gravate her misfortune We only disturb her You see my dear what are the effects of too vio∣lent a passion It may be a lesson for your future conduct  ARAMINTA  Look you lady Beverley don't provoke me  LADY  Why what will you do  CAELIA  interposing  For heaven's sake madam  LADY  I fancy Mrs Araminta instead of quarrelling we had better join forces If we could but get this girl out of the way we might both succeed  ARAMINTA  You are a wicked woman  LADY  Poor creature shall I say any thing to my cousin Modely for you You know I have weight with him  ARAMINTA  Yes madam you may tell him that his connec∣tions with you have rendered him ridiculous and that the revenge of an injured woman is never con∣temptible  Exit Araminta  LADY  leading off Caelia on the other side  Poor creatureCome along child  END of the THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE  continues  SIR JOHN DORILANT  alone  THIS fatal spot which draws me to it almost involuntarily must be the scene of another interviewThank heaven I have recovered my∣self Nor shall any misery which I may suffer much less any prospect of a mean revenge make me act unbecoming my character  Enter  ARAMINTA  ARAMINTA  Well brother I hope you are resolved to marry this girl  SIR JOHN  Marry her my dear Araminta Can you think it possible that I should have so preposterous a thought No my behaviour shall deserve her but not overrule her inclinations Were I to seize the tender opportunity of her present disposition the world would ascribe it to her fortune and I am sure my deceased and valuable friend however kindly he meant to me in the affair never intend∣ed that I should make his daughter unhappy  ARAMINTA  But I tell you she loves you and you must and shall marry her  SIR JOHN  Ah sister you are willing to dispose of her any way That worthless lover of yours still hangs about your heart and I have avoided seeing him on your account as well as Caelia's  ARAMINTA  To shew how mistaken you are in all this I have given him up totally I despise and hate him nay I am upon the brink of a resolution to give myself to another  Sir John shakes his head  I am I assure you his friend Mr Belmour is by no means indifferent on my subject  SIR JOHN  And is this revenge on yourself a proof of your want of passion for himAh AramintaCome come my dear I own I think him unworthy of you and would resent his usage to the utmost did not I clearly perceive that it would appear mercenary in myself and give real pain both to you and Caelia  ARAMINTHA  I actually don't know what to say to you  SIR JOHN  You had better say nothing Your spirits at present are too much alarmedI have sent for Caelia hither a short hour may determine the fates of all of us I know my honourable intentions will give her great uneasiness But it is my duty which exacts them from meYou had better take a turn or two in some other part of the garden I see my steward coming this wayI may want your assistance but too soon  Exit Araminta  Enter  STEWARD  Have you brought those papers I bad you look out  STEWARD  Yes Sir But there is the gentleman within to wait upon your honour concerning the estate you intended to purchase It seems a mighty good bargain  SIR JOHN  I cannot speak to him now  STEWARD  Your honour always used to be punctual  SIR JOHN  Alas Jonathan I may be punctual again to∣morrowGive me the papers Did Miss Beverley say she would come to me  STEWARD  Immediately Sir But I wish your honour would consider such bargains as these do not offer every day  SIR JOHN  Heigh ho  STEWARD  It joins so conveniently too to your honour's own estate within a hedge as I may say  SIR JOHN  Prithee don't plague me  STEWARD  Nay 'tis not my interest but your honour's Tho' that indeed I may call my interest for I am sure I love your honour  SIR JOHN  I know thou dost Jonathan and I am too hasty  but leave me nowIf the gentleman will do me the favour of staying all night I may satisfy him in the morning My head and heart are too full now for any business which concerns my fortune  STEWARD  Something goes very wrong with my poor mas∣ter Some love nonsense or other I suppose I wish all the women were in the bottom of the sea for my part  Exit Steward  Enter  LADY BEVERLEY  and  CAELIA  LADY  I thought it requisite Sir John as I heard you had something of importance to transact with my daughter to wait upon you with her  SIR JOHN  Was that necessary madamI begged the fa∣vour of Miss Beverley's company only  LADY  But a mother you know Sir John who has a tender concern for her child  SIR JOHN  Should shew it upon every occasion  LADY  I find Sir John there is some misunderstanding at present which a woman of prudence and expe∣rience might be much better consulted upon than a poor young thing whose  SIR JOHN  Not at all madam Caelia has all the prudence I require and our present conversation will soon be over  LADY  Nay Sir John to be sure I am not afraid of trust∣ing my daughter alone with you A man of your discretion will undoubtedly be guilty of no impro∣priety But a third person sometimes where the parties concerned are a little too much influenced by their passions has occasioned very substantial and very useful effects I have known several in∣stances of it in the course of my experience  SIR JOHN  This madam will not be one of themHow teizing  Walking aside  LADY  I find Sir John that you are determined to have your own way and therefore I shall shew you by my behaviour that I know what good manners re∣quire tho' I do not always meet with the same treatment from other people  Exit Lady  SIR JOHN  Now Caelia we are alone and I have many excuses to make to you for the impassioned sallies of our late conversation which I do most sincere∣lyCan you pardon them  CAELIA  Alas Sir 'tis I who ought to intreat for pardon  SIR JOHN  Not in the least madam I have no blame to cast upon you for any part of your conduct Your youth and inexperience joined to the goodness of your heart are sufficient apologies for any shadow of indiscretion which might appear in your behavi∣our I am afraid mine was not so irreproachable However Caelia I shall endeavour to make you all the amends in my power and to shew you that  it is your happiness not my own which is the ob∣ject of my anxiety  Your father's will is but too clear in its inten∣tions But the purity of his heart never meant to promote my felicity at the expence of yours You are therefore madam entirely at liberty from this moment to make your choice where you please This paper will entitle you to that authority and this will enable you to bestow your fortune where you bestow your handTake them my dear Why are you so disturbedAlas Caelia I see too plainly the cause of these emotions You only wish the happy man to whom you have given your heart loved you as I do  But I beg pardon and will only add one cau∣tion which my duty demands of me as your guardian your protector and your father's friend You have been a witness of Modely's transacti∣ons with my sister Have a care therefore Caelia be sure of his firm attachment before you let your own hurry you into a compliance These papers give you up all power on my part but as an ad∣viser I shall be always ready to be consulted  CAELIA  My tears and my confusion have hitherto hin∣dered me from answering not the invidious sug∣gestion which you have so cruelly charged me with What friend what lover have I to engross my at∣tentions I never had but one and he has cast me off for everO Sir give me the papers and let me return them where my soul longs to place them  SIR JOHN  No Caelia to accept them again would im∣peach the justice of my whole proceeding It  would make it look like the mean artifice of a mercenary villain who attempted to gain by stra∣tagem what his merits did not entitle him to I blush to think of itI have performed my office Be mistress of yourself and let me fly from a com∣bat to which I find myself unequal  Exit Sir John  CAELIA sits down leaning her head upon her hand

passes without being taken notice of then speaks  If it is not an interruption madam when I find you thus alone  CAELIA  rising  I would chuse to be alone  MODELY  Madam  CAELIA  after a little pause  In short Mr Modely your behaviour to me of late is what I can by no means approve of It is unbecoming your character as a man of honour and would be a stain to the ingenuous modesty of my sex for me to suffer it  MODELY  You surprize me madam Can the adoration of an humble love the timid advances of a man  whom you beauty has undone be such unpardonable offences  CAELIA looks with indignation at him and is going off  MODELY  catching hold of her and falling upon his knees  Nay madam you must not leave me  CAELIA  Rise Sir or I am gone this momentI thought of flying from you but my soul disdains it Know then Sir that I am mistress of myself mistress of my fortune and may bestow my hand wherever my heart directs it  MODELY  My angel  Coming eagerly up to her  CAELIA  What do you mean  MODELY  That you make the most sincere of lovers the happiest of mankind The addition of your for∣tune will add splendor to our felicity and the frowns of disappointed love only heighten our en∣joyments  CAELIA  Oh thou vile oneHow does that cruel generous man who has rejected me rise on the comparison  MODELY  Rejected youSir John Dorilant  CAELIA  Yes Mr Modely that triumph at least is yours I have offered myself and been refused My hand and fortune equally disdained But may perpetual happiness attend him where'er his honest honest heart shall fix  MODELY  O madam your inexperience deceives you He knows the integrity of your mind and trusts to that for recompence His seeming disinterested∣ness is but the surer method of compleating his utmost wishes  CAELIA  Blasphemer stop thy tongue The purity of his intentions is as much above thy malice as thy imi∣tation  She walks to one side of the stage and Modely stands disconcerted on the other  Enter  LADY BEVERLEY  LADY  Well child what has the man said to thee Cousin Modely your servant you find our plot would not take they were too quick upon us Hey day what has been doing here  MODELY  O madam you are my only refuge a wretch on the brink of despair flies to you for protection That amiable creature is in full possession of herself and fortune and yet rejects my tenderest solli∣citations  LADY  ReallyWhat is all this Tell me Caelia has the man actually given up all right and title to thee real and personal Come come I must be a principal actress I find in this affairDecency and decorum require itTell me child is it so  CAELIA  Sir John Dorilant madam with a generosity peculiar to himself cruel generosity has cancelled every obligation which could confine my choice  These papers confirm the freedom he has given me and rob me of all future comfort  LADY  Indeed I did not expect this of him but I am heartily glad of it Give  me  the papers child  CAELIA  No madamUseless as they are they are yet my own  LADY  UselessWhat do you mean Has the base man laid any other embargo on thee child  CAELIA  I cannot bear madam even from you to hear Sir John Dorilant treated with disrespect Useless Yes they shall be useless Thus thus I tear them into atoms and disdain a liberty which but too justly reproaches  my  conduct Your ad∣vice madam has already made me miserable but it shall not make me ungrateful or unjust  Exit Caelia  LADY  I am astonished I never saw the girl in such a way before Why this is errant disobedience cousin Modely I must after her and know the bottom of itDon't despair  Exit Lady  BELMOUR  coming out of the arbour  Come See Overcome O poor Caesar  MODELY  humming a tune  You think I am disconcerted now  BELMOUR  Why really I should think something of that kind  MODELY  You never were more mistaken in your life Egad 'tis a spirited girl She and Sir John Dori∣lant were certainly born for one another I have a  good mind to take compassion of them and let them come together They must and shall be man and wife and I will e'en go back to Ara∣minta  BELMOUR  Thou hast a most astonishing assurance  MODELY  Hushshe is coming this wayget into your hole again and be dumb Now you shall see a scene of triumph indeed  BELMOUR  Have a care Caesar you have the Britons to deal with  Retires  Enter  ARAMINTA  ARAMINTA  What are they gone and my wretch here by himselfO that I could dissemble a littleI will if my heart bursts for itO Mr Modely I am half ashamed to see youbut my brother has signed those odious writings  MODELY  Then thus I seize my charmer  ARAMINTA  Agreeable rascalBe quiet can't you you think one so forward now  MODELY  I cannot will not be restrained when the dear object of my wishes meets me with kind compli∣ance in her eyes and voiceTomorrow 'Tis an age why should we wait for that To∣night my angel tonight may make us one and the fair prospect of our halcyon days even from this hour begin  ARAMINTA  Who would not think this fellow with his blank verse now was in earnest But I know him tho∣roughlyIndeed Mr Modely you are too pres∣sing marriage is a serious thing Besides you know this idle bustle betwixt my brother and Caelia which you seem to think me ignorant of and which you in some measure tho' undesignedly I dare say have occasioned may obstruct us a little  MODELY  Not at all my dear an amusement  en passant  the meer raillery of gallantry on my side to oblige her impertinent mother who you know has a  penchant  for Sir John herself was the whole in∣significant business Perhaps indeed I was some∣thing blameable in it  ARAMINTA  Why really I think so in your situation But are you sure it went no farther nothing else passed between you  MODELY  Nothing in nature  ARAMINTA  Dear me how mistaken people are I cannot say that I believed it but they told me that you had actually proposed to marry her that the girl was near consenting and that the mother was your friend in the affair  MODELY  The mere malice and invention of lady Bever∣ley  ARAMINTA  And there is not a word of truth in it then  MODELY  Not a syllableYou know my soul is yours  ARAMINTA  O thou villainI thought to have kept my temper and to have treated you with the contempt you deserve but this insolence is intolerable Can you imagine that I am a stranger to your proceed∣ings a deaf blind ideotO I could tear this foolish heart which cheated by its passion has encouraged such an insultHow how have I deserved this treatment  Bursting into tears  MODELY  greatly alarmed  By holy faithby every power above you and you only are the passion of my soulMay every curse  ARAMINTA  Away deceiverthese tears are the tears of re∣sentment My resolution melts not in my eyes 'Tis fixed unalterable You might imagine from the gayety of my temper that it had its levity too But know Sir that a woman who has once been duped defies all future machinations  MODELY  Hear me madam nay you shall hear me  ARAMINTA  Shallinsufferable insolenceGo Sir for any thing which regards me you are free as air free as your licentious principles Nor shall a thought of what I once esteemed you disturb my future quiet There are men who think me not con∣temptible and under whose protection I may shel∣ter my disgrace Unhand methis is the last time I shall probably ever see you and I may tell you in parting that you have used me cruelly and that Caelia knows you as perfectly as I do  Exit Araminta  MODELY stands confounded  Enter  BELMOUR  BELMOUR  Caesar ashamedand well he may i'faith Why man what is the matter with you Quite dumb quite confounded Did not I always tell you that you loved her  MODELY  I feel it sensibly  BELMOUR  And I can tell you another secret  MODELY  What's that  BELMOUR  That she loves you  MODELY  O that she did  BELMOUR  DidEvery word every motion of passion through her whole conversation betrayed it invo∣luntarily I wish it had been otherwise  MODELY  Why  BELMOUR  Because I had some thoughts of circumventing you But I find it will be in vain Therefore pursue her properly and she is yours  MODELY  O never Belmour neverI have sinned beyond a possibility of pardon That she did love me I have had a thousand proofs which like a brain∣less  ideot I wantonly trifled with What a piti∣ful rascal have I made myself  BELMOUR  Why in that I agree with you but don't de∣spair man you may still be happier than you de∣serve  MODELY  With what face can I approach her Every cir∣cumstance of her former affection now rises in judgment against me O Belmour she has taught me to blush  BELMOUR  And I assure you it becomes you mightily  MODELY  Where can I applyHow can I address her All that I can possibly do will only look like a mean artificial method of patching up my other disappointment  BELMOUR  More miracles still She has not only taught you to blush but has absolutely made a man of honour of you  MODELY  Raillery is out of season  Enter a  SERVANT  SERVANT  Mrs Araminta Sir desires to speak with you  MODELY  eagerly  With me  SERVANT  No Sir with Mr Belmour  BELMOUR  With me  SERVANT  Yes Sir  BELMOUR  Where is she  SERVANT  In the close walk by the house Sir  BELMOUR  And alone  SERVANT  Entirely Sir  BELMOUR  I wait upon her this instant  Exit Servant  MODELY  Belmour you shall not stir  BELMOUR  By my faith but I will Sir  MODELY  She said there were men to whom she could fly for protection By my soul she intends to propose herself to you  BELMOUR  And if she does I shall certainly accept her offer  MODELY  I'll cut your thtoat if you do  BELMOUR  And do you think to fright me by that I fancy I can cut throats as well as other people Your servant If I cannot succeed for myself I'll speak a good word for you  Exit Belmour  MODELY  What can this meanI am upon thorns till I know the event I must watch them No that is dishonest Dishonest How virtuous does a real passion make oneHeigh ho  Walks about in disorder  He seems in great haste to go to her He has  turned into the walk alreadyThat abominable old fashioned cradle work makes the hedges so thick there is no seeing through themAn open lawn has ten thousand times the beauty and is kept at by less expence by halfThese cursed unnatural chairs are always in the way too  Stumbling against one of the garden chairs  What a miserable dog am I I would give an arm to know what they are talking about We talk of female coquettes By my soul we beat them at their own weaponsStayone stratagem I may yet put in practice and it is an honest oneThe thought was luckyI will about it instantly Poor ModelyHow has thy vanity reduced thee  END of the FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE  continues  ARAMINTA  and  BELMOUR  ARAMINTA  YOU find Mr Belmour that I have seen your partialities and like a woman of ho∣nour I have confessed my own Your behaviour to your friend is generous beyond comparison and I could almost join in the little stratagem you pro∣pose merely to see if he deserves it  BELMOUR  Indeed madam you mistake him utterly Vanity is his ruling vice an idle affectation of suc∣cess among the ladies which makes fools admire and boys envy him is the master passion of his giddy heart The severe checks he has met with today have sufficiently opened his understanding and the real possession of one valuable woman whom he dreads to lose will soon convince him how de∣spicable his folly has made him  ARAMINTA  I am afraid Mr Belmour a man who has half his life been pursuing bubbles without perceiving their insignificance will be easily tempted to re∣sume  the chace The possession of one reality will hardly convince him that the rest were shadows And a woman must be an ideot indeed who thinks of fixing a man to herself after marriage whom she could not secure before it To begin with in∣sensibility O fie Mr Modely  BELMOUR  You need not fear it madam his heart  ARAMINTA  Is as idle as our conversation on the subject I beg your pardon for the comparison as I do for having sent for you in this manner But I thought it necessary that both you and Mr Modely should know my real sentiments undisguised by passion  BELMOUR  And may I hope you will concur in my proposal  ARAMINTA  I don't know what to say to it it is a piece of mummery which I am ill suited for at present But if an opportunity should offer I must confess I have enough of the woman in me not to be insen∣sible to the charms of an innocent revengeBut this other intricate business if you can assist me in that you will oblige me beyond measure There are two hearts Mr Belmour worthy to be united Had my brother a little less honour and she a little less sensibilityBut I know not what to think of it  BELMOUR  In that madam I can certainly assist you  ARAMINTA  How dear Mr Belmour  BELMOUR  I have been a witness unknown to Caelia to such a conversation as will clear up every doubt Sir John can possibly have entertained  ARAMINTA  You charm me when you say soAs I live here comes my brother Stay is not that wretch Modely with him He is actually What can his assurance be plotting nowCome this way Mr Belmour we will watch them at a dis∣tance that no harm may happen between them and talk to the girl first The monster  Exeunt  Enter  SIR JOHN DORILANT  and  MODELY  MODELY  Entering and looking after Araminta and Belmour  They are together still  But let me resume my nobler self  SIR JOHN  Why will you follow me Mr Modely I have purposely avoided youMy heart swells with in∣dignationI know not what may be the con∣sequence  MODELY  Upon my honour Sir John  SIR JOHN  Honour Mr Modely 'tis a sacred word You ought to shudder when you pronounce it Honour has no existence but in the breast of truth 'Tis the harmonious result of every virtue combined You have sense you have knowledge but I can as∣sure you Mr Modely tho' parts and knowledge without the dictates of justice or the feelings of hu∣manity may make a bold and mischievous member of society even courted by the world they only in my eye make him more contemptible  MODELY  This I can bear Sir John because I have deserved it  SIR JOHN  You may think perhaps it is only an idle af∣fair with a lady what half mankind are guilty of and what the conceited wits of your acquaintance will treat with raillery Faith with a woman ri∣diculous But let me tell you Mr Modely the man who even slightly deceives a believing and a trusting woman can never be a man of honour  MODELY  I own the truth of your assertions I feel the aweful superiority of your real virtue Nor should any thing have dragged me into your presence so much I dreaded it but the sincerest hope of making you happy  SIR JOHN  Making me happy Mr Modely You have put it out of your own power  Walks from him then turns to him again  You mean I suppose by a resignation of Caelia to me  MODELY  Not of Caelia only but her affections  SIR JOHN  Vain and impotent proposal  MODELY  Sir John 'tis not a time for altercation By all my hopes of bliss here and hereafter you are the real passion of her soulLook not so unbelieving by heaven 'tis true and nothing but an artful insinuation of your never intending to marry her and even concurring in our affair could ever have made her listen one moment to me  SIR JOHN  Why do I hear you O Mr Modely you touch my weakest part  MODELY  Cherish the tender feelings and be happy  SIR JOHN  Is it possible that amiable creature can think and talk tenderly of me I know her generosity but generosity is not the point  MODELY  Believe me Sir 'tis more 'tis real unaffected passion Her innocent soul speaks through her eyes the honest dictates of her heart In our last conference notwithstanding her mother's com∣mands notwithstanding what I blush to own my utmost ardent solicitations to the contrary she persisted in her integrity tore the papers which left her choice free and treated us with an indig∣nation which added charms to virtue  SIR JOHN  O these flattering soundsWould I could believe them  MODELY  Belmour as well as myself and lady Beverley was a witness of the truth of them I thought it my duty to inform you as I know your delicacy with regard to her And indeed I would in some measure endeavour to repair the injuries I have offered to your family before I leave it for ever O Sir John let not an illjudged nicety debar you from a happiness which stands with open arms to receive you Think what my folly has lost in Araminta and when your indignation at the affront is a little respited be blest yourself and pity me  As he goes out he still looks after Araminta and Belmour  They are together still but I will go round that way to the house  Exit  Modely  SIR JOHN  What can this mean He cannot intend to deceive me he seems too sincerely affected I must I will believe him The mind which sus∣pects injustice is half guilty of it itselfTalks tenderly of me Tore the parpers Treated them with indignation Heavens what a flow of ten∣der joy comes over me Shall Caelia then be mine How my heart dances O I could be wondrous foolishWell Jonathan  Enter  STEWARD  STEWARD  The gentleman Sir  SIR JOHN  What of the gentleman I am ready for any thing  STEWARD  Will wait upon your honour tomorrow as you are not at leisure  SIR JOHN  With all my heart Now or then whenever he pleases  STEWARD  I am glad to see your honour in spirits  SIR JOHN  Spirits Jonathan I am light as airMake a thousand excuses to him but let it be to∣morrow however for I see lady Beverley coming this way  STEWARD  Heaven bless his good soul I love to see him merry  Exit  Enter  LADY BEVERLEY  LADY  If I don't interrupt you Sir John  SIR JOHN  Interrupt me madam 'tis impossible  LADY  For I would not be guilty of an indecorum even to you  SIR JOHN  Come come lady Beverley these little bicker∣ings must be laid aside Give me your hand lady Now we are friends  Kissing it  How does your lovely daughter  LADY  You are in mighty good humour Sir John perhaps every body may not be so  SIR JOHN  Every body must be so madam where I come I am joy itself  "The jolly god that leads the jocund hours"  LADY  What is come to the man Whatever it is I shall damp it presently  Aside  Do you chuse to hear what I have to say Sir John  SIR JOHN  You can say nothing madam but that you con∣sent and Caelia is my own Yes you your∣self have been a witness to her integrity Come indulge me lady Beverley Declare it all and let me listen to my happiness  LADY  I shall declare nothing Sir John on that sub∣ject what I have to say is of a very different im∣port In short without circumlocution or  any unnecessary embarrassment to entangle the af∣fair I and my daughter are of an opinion that it is by no means proper for us to continue any longer in your family  SIR JOHN  Madam  LADY  This is what I had to declare Sir John  SIR JOHN  Does Caelia madam desire to leave me  LADY  It was a proposal of her own  SIR JOHN  Confusion  LADY  And a very sensible one too in my opinion For when people are not so easy together as might be expected I know no better remedy than parting  SIR JOHN  Aside  Sure this is no trick of Modely's to get her away from meHe talked too himself of leav∣ing my family immediatelyI shall relapse again  LADY  I find Sir John you are somewhat disconcert∣ed but for my part  SIR JOHN  O torture  LADY  I say for my part Sir John it might have been altogether as well perhaps if we had never met  SIR JOHN  I am sorry madam my behaviour has offended you but  Enter  ARAMINTA CAELIA  and  BELMOUR  ARAMINTA  to Caelia as she enters  Leave the house indeed Come come you shall speak to him What is all this disorder for Pray brother has any thing new happened That wretch has been beforehand with us  Aside to Belmour  LADY  Nothing at all Mrs Araminta I have only made a very reasonable proposal to him which he is pleased to treat with his and your usual in∣civility  SIR JOHN  You wrong us madam with the imputation  After a pause and some irresolution he goes up to Caelia  I thought Miss Beverley I had al∣ready given up my authority and that you were perfectly at liberty to follow your own inclinations I could have wished indeed to have still assisted you with my advice and I flattered myself that my presence would have been no restraint upon your conduct But I find it is otherwise My very roof is grown irksome to you and the inno∣cent pleasure I received in observing your growing virtues is no longer to be indulged to me  CAELIA  O Sir put not so hard a construction upon what I thought a blameless proceeding Can it be won∣dered at that I should fly from him who has twice rejected me with disdain  SIR JOHN  With disdain Caelia  CAELIA  Who has withdrawn from me even his parental tenderness and driven me to the hard necessity of avoiding him lest I should offend him farther  I know how much my inexperience wants a faithful guide I know what cruel censures a ma∣licious world will pass upon my conduct but I must bear them all For he who might protect me from myself protect me from the insults of li∣centious tongues abandons me to fortune  SIR JOHN  O Caeliahave I have I abandoned thee Heaven knows my inmost soul how it did rejoice but a few moments ago when Modely told me that your heart was mine  ARAMINTA  ModelyDid Modely tell you so Do you hear that Mr Belmour  SIR JOHN  He did my sister with every circumstance which could increase his own guilt and her in∣tegrity  ARAMINTA  That was honest however  SIR JOHN  I thought it so and respected him accordingly O he breathed comfort to a despairing wretch but now a thousand thousand doubts crowd in up∣on me He leaves my house this instant nay may be gone already Caelia too is flying from meperhaps to join him and with her hap∣pier lover smile at my undoing  Leans on Araminta  CAELIA  I burst with indignationCan I be suspected  of such treachery Can you Sir who know my every thought harbour such a suspicionO ma∣dam this contempt have you brought upon me A want of deceit was all the little negative praise I had to boast of and that is now denied me  Leans on Lady Beverley  LADY  Come away child  CAELIA  No madam I have a harder task still to per∣form  Comes up to Sir John  To offer you my hand again under these circum∣stances thus despicable as you have made me may seem an insult But I mean it not as suchO Sir if you ever loved my father in pity to my orphan state let me not leave you Shield me from the world shield me from the worst of misfortunes your own unkind suspicions  ARAMINTA  What fooling is here Help me Mr Belmour There take her hand And now let it go if you can  SIR JOHN  grasping her hand  O Caelia may I believe Modely Is your heart mine  CAELIA  It is and ever shall be  SIR JOHN  Transporting extacy  Turning to Caelia  LADY  I should think Sir John a mother's consent tho' Mrs Araminta I see has been so very good to take that office upon herself  SIR JOHN  I beg your pardon madam my thoughts were too much engaged But may I hope for your concurrence  LADY  I don't know what to say to you I think you have bewitch'd the girl amongst you  ARAMINTA  Indeed lady Beverley this is quite preposterous HaHe here againProtect me Mr Belmour  Enter  MODELY  MODELY  Madam you need fly no where for protection you have no insolence to fear from me I am humbled sufficiently and the postchaise is now at the door to banish me for ever My sole business here is to unite that virtuous man with the most worthy of her sex  ARAMINTA  half aside  Thank you for the complimentNow Mr Belmour  LADY  You may spare yourself that trouble cousin Mode∣ly the girl is irrecoverably gone already  MODELY  May all the happiness they deserve attend them  Going then looks back at Araminta  I cannot leave her  SIR JOHN  Mr Modely is there nobody here besides whom you ought to take leave of  MODELY  I own my parting from that lady  to Araminta  should not be in silence but a conviction of my guilt stops my tongue from utterance  ARAMINTA  I cannot say I quite believe that but as our af∣fair may make some noise in the world for the sake of my own character I must beg of you to declare before this company whether any part of my conduct has given even a shadow of excuse for the insult I have received If it has be honest and proclaim it  MODELY  None by heaven the crime was all my own and I suffer for it justly and severelywith shame I speak it notwithstanding the appearances to the contrary my heart was ever yours and ever will be  ARAMINTA  I am satisfied and will honestly confess the sole reason of my present appeal was this that where I had destined my hand my conduct might ap∣pear unblemished  Gives her hand to Belmour  MODELY  Confusionthen my suspicions were just  SIR JOHN  Sister  CAELIA  Araminta  ARAMINTA  What do ye mean What are ye surprized at The insinuating Mr Modely can never want mistresses any where Can he Mr Belmour You know him perfectly  MODELY  DistractionKnows me Yes he does know me The villain though he triumphs in my sufferings knows what I feelYou madam are just in your severity from you I have deserved every thing the anguish the despair which must attend my future life comes from you like heaven's avenging ministerBut for him  Sir John interposes  O for a sword But I shall find a time and a severe oneLet me go Sir John  ARAMINTA  I'll carry on the farce no longerRash incon∣siderate madman The sword which pierces Mr Belmour's breast would rob you of the best of friendsThis pretended marriage for it is no more was merely contrived by him to con∣vince me of your sincerityEmbrace him as your guardian angel and learn from him to be virtuous  BELMOUR  O madam let me still plead for him Surely when a vain man feels himself in the wrong you cannot desire him to suffer a greater punishment  ARAMINTA  I have done with fooling You told me to∣day lady Beverley that he would never return to me  LADY  And I told you at the same time madam that if he didyou would take him  ARAMINTA  In both you were mistaken Mr Modely your last behaviour to Caelia and my brother shews a generosity of temper I did not think you capable  of and for that I thank you But to be serious on our own affair whatever appearance your present change may carry with it your transactions of today have been such that I can never hereafter have that respect for you which a wife ought to have for her husband  SIR JOHN  I am sorry to say it Mr Modely her deter∣mination is I fear too just Trust to time how∣ever at least let us part friends and not abruptly We should conceal the failings of each other and if it must come to that endeavour to find out spe∣cious reasons for breaking off the match without injuring either party  ARAMINTA  To shew how willing I am to conceal every thing now I have had my little female revenge as my brother has promised us the fiddles this evening Mr Modely as usual shall be my part∣ner in the dance  MODELY  I have deserved this ridicule madam and am humbled to what you please  ARAMINTA  Why then brother as we all seem in a strange dilemma why may'nt we have one dance in the garden it will put us in good humour  SIR JOHN  As you please madamCall the fiddles hither Don't despair Mr Modely  Half aside to him  LADY  I will not dance positively  BELMOUR  Indeed but you shall madam do you think I will be the only disconsolate swain who wants a partner Besides you see there are are so few of us  that we must call in the butler and the ladies maids even to help out the figure  SIR JOHN  Come lady Beverley you must lay aside all ani∣mosities If I have behaved improperly to you to∣day I most sincerely ask your pardon and hope the anxieties I have been under will sufficiently plead my excuse my future conduct shall be irre∣proachable  Turning to Caelia  Here have I placed my happiness and here ex∣pect it O Caelia if the seriousness of my beha∣viour should hereafter offend you impute it to my infirmity it can never proceed from want of affection  A heart like mine its  own  distress contrives  And feels  most  sensibly the pain it gives  Then even its frailties candidly approve  For if it errs it errs from too much love  A DANCE  EPILOGUE Spoken before the DANCE By Mrs YATES and Mr PALMER in the Characters of ARAMINTA and MODELY  ARAMINTA  WELL ladies am I right or am I not  Should not this foolish passion be forgot  This fluttering something scarce to be exprest  Which pleads for coxcombs in each female breast  How mortified he look'd and looks so still  Turning to Modely  He really may repent perhaps he will  MODELY  Will AramintaLadies be so good  Man's made of frail materials flesh and blood  We all offend at some unhappy crisis  Have whims caprices vanities and vices  Your happier sex by nature was design'd  Her last best work to perfect humankind  No spot no blemish the fair frame deforms  No avarice taints no naughty passion warms  Your firmer hearts No love of change in you  E'er taught desire to stray  ARAMINTA  All this is true  Yet stay the men perchance will call it sneer  And some few ladies think you not sincere  For your petition whether wrong or right  Whate'er it be withdraw it for tonight  Another time if I should want a spouse  I may myself report it to the house  At present let us strive to mend the age  Let justice reign at least upon the stage  Where the fair dames who like to live by rule  May learn two lessons from the  LOVER'S SCHOOL  While Caelia's choice instructs them how to chuse  And my refusal warns them to refuse  THE END  ERRATA  Page l  for  you and I  read  you and me  l  for  you and I  read  you and me
