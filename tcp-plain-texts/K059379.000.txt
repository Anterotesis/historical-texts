 A Farther ARGUMENT AGAINST  Ennobling Foreigners  IN ANSWER To the Two Parts of the State Anatomy With a Short Account of the Anatomizer  Tlnd  Blasphemes the HolyGhost  The Bribed of Bribes Accuses  Of Foreign Rogues the Traytor Boasts  The King who was  Your Lord of Hosts    That Ral  How  Abuses  A Letter to a Member of Parliament  LONDON  Printed for  E Moore  near St  Paul  's Price  d  Where may be had the first Part Price  s  A Farther Argument  c  INTRODUCTION  SUCH is the Pride and invincible Obstinacy of Mankind that nothing is more against Nature than to  acknowledge their mistakes  Not the power of their Reason not the sence of Modesty no not the influence of secret Convictions can prevail with them ever to own themselves  in the wrong  No altho' they know it and discover to every own they converse with that they do so Hence the innumerable Writings of Men obstinate in error  have in a great measure proceeded and the World has been fill'd with the labours of  Hereticks  who have in all Ages broach'd false Doctrines and infamous  Opinions  even so gross as  Satan  himself never had the front to suggest and yet rather than be thought to recant what they had once advanc'd they have thought fit to maintain those false Doctrines and infamous Opinions at the expence of Religion Conscience and all manner of Reputation  This I take to be the Case in due proportion to Circumstances of the Author of the late Libel entituled the  State Anatomy  such I must call it because it Libels and Slanders Persons Governments and Nations And as this has long been his practise in other things for which a certain Author of Note said of him That he had made the World believe him a worse Heretick than he is  So  I see a great deal of ground to think he has gone upon the same foundation in bringing forth now a second part of his Libel in vindication of the first notwithstanding it is manifest that he  was so convinc'd of the Error of the first that the very nature of the thing now extorts a Confession That he had been justly reprov'd An example of this to make things clear as I go is in nothing more evident than in the great bustle he makes in his second Libel to clear himself of his having most scandalously forespoken the House of Lords telling us positively before their Lordships had so much as debated it that they  really would  receive more Foreigners into their Body and pointing out to them who should be the Men This he will not have call'd  leading  or  dictating  to the House tho' there are innumerable precedents when the House have thought otherwise and resented it accordingly as well from greater as smaller Persons than this Author  This hard task however he undertakes tho' most People think he will as ill come off as he did from endeavouring to prove himself no Heretick when yet he owns himself to be of some Opinions contrary to Orthodox Christians  It is nevertheless to be acknowledged to him for I shall do him justice tho' he does no justice to others I say it is to be acknowledg'd to him that he grants leading and dictating to so illustrious a Body as the House of Lords is an unjustifyable practise but when he comes to wash his hands of the Fact  Hoc opus Hic labor est  I shall examine it by it self presently but before I enter upon that part it is meet to attack his  detach'd Parties  which he has prepar'd to Satyrize those he intends to fight with for it is to be observ'd that he takes a new method with Mankind scarce ever practis'd by any Man before and this is to find out an Author who he thinks fit for his encounter and call him the Writer of the Book which he contends with it matters not with him whether he is the Man or no and thus having drest up this  Man of Straw  he begins the fight This he has done in the Case before me where finding it greatly for his purpose that  De Foe  Author of the  True born Englishman  should pass for the Author of the  Argument  against enabling Foreigners  c he has singled him out and fallen upon him in a most merciless manner for he has recommended him to the Revenge of his Foreigners what mercy he will find there may be guessd at He has also as far as his good Wishes may have effect recommended him to the Resentment of the Government He has expos'd ridicul'd banter'd and in a word as far as in him lies murther'd the Man and yet all this while this Man as I find was no more Author of this Book than the Man in the Moon Nay  as I hear  for I have no Knowledge of the Man he has been sick in his Bed all the while In carrying on this  Tragi comedy  he takes care to summon for Evidence all that this  D F  has said upon the same subject in his Pamphlets and Poems formerly written and to confront this with what I have said now whereas if it were true that the said  D F  had been Author of all those things and those too it had amounted to no more than this either that he had been  wrong before  and was now  better inform'd    or  second  that he had contradicted himself and wrote one time one thing and one time another a fault which Modesty should have taught  Toland  to have pass'd over in silence that it might not be retorted upon himself and after all neither of these things would prove at all that what Mr  Toland  had said was right or would have made his Libel one jot better than it was before besides the Scandal of having taken a wrong aim and charging a Man falsly with writing this Book who really has no manner of concern in it or about it In the next place I observe Mr  Toland  is of Opinion that I should not have publish'd his Name when I answer'd his Libel The Truth is he should have taken care to have had the Secret better kept knowing how ill his Name recommends any Cause he embarks in the defense of and how much disadvantage it is to those he serves to have him known to be their Advocate upon these Considerations I should have forborn his Name had it not been made publick before by his Eccho Mr  Boyer  who  in his Monthly Fables call'd falsly  the Political State  harang'd for him thinking  by mistake  to make his Book sell This Man openly told his Name for which I hear the Bookseller  ow'd him no thanks  Since then his own Friend did him that injury for I hear it gave a great check to the sale of his Book why should he blame the Author of the  Answer  who only nam'd him at second Hand after it was no more a Secret and who even then did it with caution too knowing how scandalous a sorger of Names to Books that same  Boyer  was and how little was to be built  for truth  upon what he had publish'd who is the easiest Man to be impos'd upon the most unconcern'd at doing any innocent Man an Injury and the backwardest to do Justice when he was convinc'd of it of any Man alive which I shall prove in a part by it self  CHAP I  A farther Confirmation of  the visible Design  there has been for some time carry'd on among  a Party  to propose the Introducing  FOREIGNERS  among the Nobility and a little of the Liberty Mr  TOLAND  takes with Truth  MR  Toland  begins this Subject for me with two notable  Falsities first he says boldly  Page these are his words  I never knew or heard of any such Design as he affirms there was to introduce these two Noblemen or any other Foreigners into the House of Peers  Stop there and go back to Page see his words again  My proposal  says he  contains nothing  new or strange  with respect either to the Dispensation or the  Persons How can this be if such a Design was never heard of before  Oportet Mendacem  The next  Falsity  is as evident as the former and is taken from his own words also Page  viz    As to the two foreign Noblemen in consideration of whose service I propos'd a legal Dispensation with the fifth limitation of the  Act of Succession an outcry was immediately rais'd as if all the Foreigners in  Christendom  were to be prefer'd here  whereas  I expresly  confin'd my Proposal  to those two Persons  Here again Mr  Toland  lets us see  that great Wits have short Memories  for either he did not write the Memorial call'd the  Anatomy  or else he had forgot himself strangely for look into his said  Anatomy  Page he expresly recommends Monsieur  Robethon  by Name thus  viz    nor can it enter into my Thoughts but that a way will be found out to recompence the Merit of the no less able and indefatigable Mr  Robethon there's  one more  plainly propos'd by Name And to let us see that even this is not all that is desired  he modestly adds  Page  I am far from extending this to  many  others  pray observe not to  many others  this I think strongly acknowledges he is for extending it  to some few others  And yet this Man has the Front to say in his  Second Part  Page that he  expresly confin'd his Proposals to two Persons  Is this the Man that charges  D F  with falshood and gives him  the  Lie  in publick Print was ever any thing more notorious and is this the Man that disowns their being  a Design laid  to propose the bringing in Foreigners and  more  Foreigners than he names into the Peerage whereas he here acknowledges there is a Design to bring in some but not  many  Thus he confesses in one Book and denies in the other talks honestly  per accident  and knavishly  per incident  But this is not the first time Mr  Toland  has discover'd himself to be  Ambo dexter  in his Arguments as well as in other things and tho' I will have nothing to do with the quarrel between  D F  and him for by his treating  D F  there must be some Malice among them yet when I am observing the Liberty Mr  Toland  takes with  Truth  I cannot pass by one of the Coursest Shuffles that I have ordinarily met with in the World It is in his fighting with his Man of Straw aforesaid After he has plaid the Buffoon with him a great while as if he was bringing him instantly to the  Old Bayly  or  Westminster  to be Arraign'd and that he  was to be the Informer against him he then falls to down right giving him the  Lie  as a Man who there was no measures to be us'd with and he proves  D F  a Lyar in this quaint method  He complains that  D F  had said in some of his writings that  he had seen the original Letter which he  Toland  had sent to the Dissenters  this is a  Lie  says  Toland  for it was only  written by an Amanuensis I kept the original by me    Now would one not think that  Toland  might have learnt ever since he was expell'd the University a little more justice in Dispute than this Let his Enemy be who he will real or imaginary I shall only ask him in a few Words  whether  let it be written by a Servant or not by a Servant  was not the Letter which he actually sent to the Dissenting Ministers properly the Original  I'll give him a particular Case  viz  as in drawing Writings The rough Draught of a Lease or  Indenture  is drawn by the Attorney or Scrivener and it is afterwards written over fair or engross'd by a Clerk  or  Amanuensis  yet that Ingrossment  being executed  is call'd the  Original Deed  and it would be look'd upon a most egregious Shuffle for any Man who had seen the said Writing to say if he was  legally ask'd  that he had not seen the  Original  because he had not seen the  Draught  If Mr  Toland  drew a Draught of a Letter  to the Dissenters  and then caused his Servant or  Amanuensis  to draw it out fair  The first perhaps having alterations interpolations  c  in it  and on viewing the fair Copy caused his Name to be set to it which is Executing it and then sent away I desire to know which is  the Original  That which is first finished and executed or that which is Drawn out rough to be redrawn out for such finishing  But this is  by  the  by  I Note it as a Specimen of his sincere way of Arguing and his bold giving  the LYE  on such Grounds as these And I have remarked this that the World may see what Advocates such a Cause as this has singled out among Mankind to defend it  Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis  Tempus eget  However I shall say the less of this here because I may yet give a Compleater History of the Character of this Mr  Toland  to undeceive the World about him and also of his fellow Labourer in this Drudgery That  French  Papist in disguise who flattering every Side in his turn Writes now for a Tory Ministry now for a Whig and under the pretence of serving the Whigs has always been the first to Publish the Manifestos of Rebels Declarations of the Pretender and such like stuff of whom I say together with an Account of Mr  Toland  the  Publick  not the  Secret History  is as ready for the Press as needful for the Publick and to which I shall refer for the most Execrable Practises that any have been suffer'd to be guilty of unpunish'd in a Christian Government  CHAP II  Of Leading Dictating or Prescribing to the House of Lords by the Pamphlet call'd  The State Anatomy    FOR the Reasons already Given I leave for a while talking any more of the Person of this Author and come back to his Discourse I find him very much concern'd to wash off what sticks to him in this Article of  Dictating to the House of Lords  it will soon appear whether he does this to purpose or not to purpose I need spend no time to prove that Leading and Dictating to the House of Lords is a Scandalous Insolent and Offensive Practice and what the House has always thought fit to resent  Toland  has given me up that Point in his  Second Libel  which therefore according to my Title I must Anatomise here  Pag  his Words aae these  They must be mad themselves who can think any Man else mad enough to prescribe to any Publick Assembly much less to the Legislative Body of the Nation  Thus  the Point is Granted and there needs no more dispute about that It lies then before us to enquire whether what Mr  Toland  in his Lybel has offer'd to the  House of Lords  can be call'd  Dictating to them  and Leading them or no  I will abate him all he says to recommend the Gentlemen This I will call only  Proposing to the Lords  which he says any Man may do But when he comes to say there is no need to fear but that the Lords  will do it  p and again that it would  savour of Ingratitude and Partiallity not to do it  p  ibid  What shall we say to that modest Part Is this Prescribing to and Leading the House of Peers or is it not  Let me be allow'd to make a short Comment upon this worthy Text  The House of Lords will Consent to make Baron  Bothmar  and Count  Bernsdorf Peers they cannot Honourably refuse it and they would be ungrateful and unjust  for to be Partial is to be Ʋnjust  if they should not These are Words well deserving to be Remark'd I would be very glad to hear when ever  such Words were spoken of the House of Lords and not resented and yet  this Man is not so mad as to Dedicate to the Parliament  ▪ as if telling them they must do a Certain thing  or be Ʋngrateful  and  Partial  was not Dictating For the farther asscertaining then what  is or is not  Dictating to the House I appeal to that Illustrious and most Honourable Assembly whose Journals are full of Eminent Precedents as well in Cases where Men have Offended in the Point of Dictating  c  as also of the constant resentment of the House in such Cases  Has this most Venerable Body been so Jealous of their Privileges and so Nice as to forbid any Lybeller or Author so much as to Print the Name of a Peer and to make the Offender Lyable to an Action of  Scandalum Magnatum  tho' he said nothing offensive nay tho' he spoke in the praise of the Person named And shall it not be an Offence against the Privileges of the House to reproach them in Print with  Ingratitude  and  Partiality  if they do not do this or  that which the Libeller says is fit to be done  Shall the House be so Jealous of their Privileges as to make a Fence round their Actions like the Rails in ancient Times to keep off the People from approaching Mount  Sinai  so that Authors are forbid to Print and Write any thing that is said or done within their Walls at their Peril and shall it be no Subject of Resentment to pretend in Print that they  will certainly  do this or that before they have so much as Debated it or spoken a Word about it Is not Mr  Redpath  and Mr  Walker  and others now in Custody of the  Black Rod  for but an unwary Trespass of this kind and shall  Toland  publickly say they  shall or will  do  this or that  and  cannot omit to do it without Ingratitude and Partiallity  and yet wipe his Mouth and say  He has given their Lordships no Offence    I will not say the House cannot omit taking him up without Partiallity but I may say that if it were any body but Mr  Toland  I should wonder at his Impudence and should  say that if he escaped he would have very good Luck  CHAP III  Of the great Succcess of the PROPOSAL The great Service done by the ANATOMIZER to the Interest which he pretends to assist And an Enquiry into the real Advance of their Cause by it  WERE the People who they Write for and those who both of them think they please made but once sensible of the just Characters of the Persons who have  whether Mercenarily  or  Officiously  undertaken their Cause Were they made sensible how they Perform and how they Expose rather than Assist the Cause they undertake they wou'd be asham'd of them and say to them as was lately said by a Noble Lord to a certain Author who claim'd some Reward for his great Services in vindicating his Lordship  You will extremely oblige me Sir if you will be pleas'd to say no more about me  Let  a Judgment be made only by the Success of the present Undertaking and let Mr  Toland  ask himself sedately Whether he thinks that the Cause he has espoused has gain'd or lost by him Let him go to the Baron  Bothmar  and Count  Bernsdorff  and ask of those Noble Persons Whether they think he has serv'd them or not and whether they think themselves nearer or farther off from a Peerage by his Argument  It cannot be true that he himself believes he has better'd their Cause it appears that he thinks otherwise by his shifting off from them the Scandal of Employing him taking the Blame of it all upon himself declaring they know nothing of it and that they are so far from desiring him to do it that they do not so much as Court or Desire the Honour of being Peers or to that purpose Now if he found upon his starting the Proposal that the Nation came generally and readily into it he would never strive with so much Earnestness to conceal the Design endeavour to bring in the Proposal  as a Brat of his own private Conjectures hatch'd for not bodies particular Interest directed by no body and only offered by a fortuitous Efflux of Thought without the Assistance or so much as the Approbation of the Persons named or pointed at  If this were the Truth of the Story  he must acknowledge himself mighty Officious  and that he has Run before he was Sent  I doubt he will find as few People to believe this Part as he has found to approve the Proposal it self  But be that as it will  if his projected Scheme of Enobling these two Foreigners with his Suggestion of  one  afterwards  which he names  and his  not many others  which he slily insinuates are to follow I say if the Method he has taken to introduce these has effected the Thing if the Generality of the Nation approve the Proposal and he sees the Game sure before them Why should they oblige him to acknowledge thus that they disown him and his Schemes Why is he not rather publickly Caress'd and his Book acknowledg'd  But on the contrary the Heads are pull'd back no body cares to own him and he himself applies diligently to clear those Noble Persons of having any hand in the Conspiracy with him as indeed I believe he has reason to do  No body cares to own a Plot when it has miscarried and if  Toland  designed to do his Principals a Service by the Proposal if it had succeeded he is the Honester and cannot be blam'd to do them a Service by keeping them out of it now it proves Abortive  Perhaps he will say I triumph without a Victory  very like so  but let him speak for himself whether it be a Victory or no if he has the Victory if he is as sure of the Success as he thought himself at first why is he so concern'd and why does he keep such a Bustle to wash the Dirt off of any and why so apprehensive least the World should think they were in the Conspiracy Why so forward to take all upon himself I think I may without any boasting say he has not so good an Opinion of his Cause as he  had when he began it let him deny it if he can  Nor will the fulsome Encomiums of a Vain  French  Scribbler assist him in this Point at all I think I may venture to say That all Mr  Toland  has said in this Case has but served to make it more difficult than he found it and the Gentlemen who he has named  if it is as he says without their Consent  no question if they know what a Champion they have that has espous'd  in meer Knight Errantry  their Cause would civilly desire him  to say no more about them    Now having brought it to the Question of his Success he joins Issue with him on his own Merit also and then the remaining Question in Debate is Whether has the Design miscarried by the scandalous Nature of the Proposal or by the scandalous Name of the Proposer Would ever Men of any Forecast have singled out a Man scandalous among Christians to have started their Friends Cause into the World He says he is not a  Socinian  and perhaps he may not be to now but let him tell them what  he was Expelled the University of for and how he comes to obtain the general Title of a Heretick in Principles if he had given no occasion for it  Not that Reproach always argues Guilt  but let him tell the World himself the occasion if he thinks fit I forbear it because it is not the present Business I shall find another Time for it  As to the present Case I cannot but observe how I have heard many People who were not much concern'd to enquire about it before start at the Proposal now because it is handed into the World by such an Agent and I leave it to universal Judgment whether the Manner the arrogant Manner of proposing it has not justly shock'd the Nobility and Gentry of  England  as to the Proposal it self to have them told  they will do it  before they were ever so much as asked To have them told it will  savour of Ingratitude and Partiallity not to do it  before ever they so much as denied Is not this Bullying the Peers into it Is it not a Bussoonry upon the Nation If this has made  the Case better than it was or has not rather justly filled many Minds with Resentment who were neither prepossessed one way or other let any reasonable Person determine  In the mean time I can assure him it is a very great Satisfaction to many good and impartial Men that this Design of proposing the breaking down the Pale of our Nobility is thus Detected and Exposed But I must confess that when some Gentlemen came to me the other Day and gave me thanks for the Service I had done in setting it out in so clear a Light as is done in the  Argument c  I told them frankly the Thanks were all due to Mr  Toland  who by so insolent an Attempt had justly alarm'd and open'd the Eyes of almost as many as had read his Libel and had even  in denying  proved effectually that this Proposal of his was  no new Thing  No indeed  it has been no new Thing either that some Persons aimed at being so Enobled or that a Party aimed at complying  and  getting those who alone could do it to comply with their Desire  and this is a sufficient Reason to be given for what I own'd in the  Argument  namely That  it had been Digested for some time viz  as long as I had understood from good Hands that there was such a thing intended and which I thought it my indispensible Duty to Oppose and Expose  CHAP IV  Of the Nature of Malice and of the unjust Suggestions of Mr  TOLAND  in his Second  ANATOMY  in order to Expose the Author of  the Argument  to the Resentment of the Government  I Despise all the sly and knavish insinuations of this Malicious Envenom'd Lybeller in order if he could to expose me as a  Jacobite  I wish all that are blindly and ignorantly  Jacobites  may in Heavens due time  be better inform'd  and all that are Maliciously so and from principles of  Hatred to the Protestant Succession and the Person of King  George  were as  Toland  is  viz Contemn'd and Expos'd  I wish them like him Expell'd from the Society of the best of Men and made to know their Crime by their Punishment There is not one Sentence or Syllable in the Book entiuled  An Argument c  which is intended as a Reflection or Disrespect to the Person or Government or Conduct of King  George  and of that Sentence which he maliciously wrests  P  viz  Till at length Posterity may be offer'd two Turks  I say to him  Honi soit qui Mal y Pense  I know no Venom in it nor can he without infinite  Sarcasm  and Lybelling the most Innocent Actions of the King say or suggest that there is any room for a Satyr in them  All his boasted Advantage and the Tryumph he makes upon Quotations out of  De Foes  Pamphlet Require no other Answer than has been given already  viz  That  De Foe  has no Concern one way or other in that Book and if Mr  Baker  the Publisher were not just at the point of Death  while this is at the Press a particular Account of that Part would be given But it is none of my business to vindicate  De Foe  however injuriously he may be treated all I have to say is That if Mr  Toland  is disposed to make Honourable Amends for the insolent Language which he gives  ME  under the Cover of Charging the Work upon a Fellow that neither He nor I know any thing of he shall at any time have the Occasion to know who is not Concern'd in this Work by knowing Face to Face who is Concern'd in it And I say the same to that Cowardly  Frenchman Boyer  also  I repeat again what I have said That there is not the least Design or Intention of Disrespect to the Person or Government of  King George  in all my Answer to  Toland  's Lybel but a single and disinterested Zeal for the Liberties of my Country I Honour with the profoundest Duty not the King only as on the Throne but all his Royal Posterity and Raee as Capable of and Design'd by Heaven to Reign in their Courses of time and  yet it is no impeachment of this Duty and Zeal  to say  that from the best of Kings have proceeded the worst of Tyrants Our Laws are made as Fences and Securities not against good but bad Kings Were the Divine Genius to be Immortal as I said in the  Argument  were all the Kings who shall proceed from the Loyns of His present Majesty to Inherit King  George  's Principles his Justice Moderation Love to his People and Knowledge as well as Desire of their Wellfare and Prosperity I would be as Easie to give up all our Constitution to him and to be Governed by his meer Will and Discretion as I would be to any Man that ever wore a Crown  But as Vertue Honour Probity Wisdom Judgment do not descend by Inheritance and are no Entail with the Crown but Kings may hereafter arise that  knew not Joseph  it is a Duty to our Posterity that we endeavour to preserve the Fences of our Liberties unbroken and hand forward those invaluable Rights to our Children  Entire as we Receive them  But this Mercenary this bringer of a Railing Accusation he is for breaking down this Fence and dispensing with this Law making a precedent to serve a present  Turn  and  Party  which may hereafter be an Argument to bring in all the Instruments of Tyranny which an Arbitrary unguided Prince may stand in need of for the Destruction of the Kingdom and this tho'  as I said before without the least design'd Reflection  they were of any Nation or Religion even  Turks  and  Mahometans  whether those who are for thus breaking in upon our Constitution to gratify  Foreigners  or they who are for preserving our Constitution whole and unbroken are the best Patriots let impartial Posterity inquire  Nor am I in this offering in the least to derogate from the just Esteem due to the Honourable Persons who he mentions  but I ask him this Question  Is there no Reward can be suitable to the Character and Merit of those Gentlemen but that of being made Lords Can the King be at a  loss and is the Kingdom of  GreatBritain  empty of means to Reward these Persons however great their Merit Is there no way to make them amends but this one Method Will nothing else satisfy them or be suitable to their Deservings that  this Libeller  should say  not to do it would be to be Ʋngrateful and Partial  I remember when the Glorious  King William  intending to Reward the late E of  Portland  with a vast Grant no less than the Revenue of the  Principality of Wales  and the House of Commons applied to His Majesty not to do it the King readily acquiesc'd and expressing his Royal Gratitude to the E of  Portland  for his many signal Services His Majesty said He would think of  Rewarding those Services some other way  I shall make no Comparisons but believe the Libeller himself will not pretend that any Man can have deserv'd better of his Present Majesty than the late E of  Portland  had deserv'd of King  William  yet when he found the way he had design'd to Reward him gave any uneasiness to his People His Majesty Resolv'd to  Reward those Eminent Services some other way and I dare say the Posterity of that Noble Person do not Complain of the King's being unkind to them  I am ready to grant that the Services of these Noble Persons now Propos'd are as great as my Opposer pleases to suppose them yet I say without lessening those Suppositions That  GreatBritain  is able to Reward them fully tho' they are not receiv'd into our Peerage and yet not merit to be Libell'd by  Toland  as partial and ungrateful  But be that as it will  Let His Majesty propose to his Parliament what he thinks fit the Parliament will always act as becomes them the House of Peers will never act undutifully to the King  no  not in those things which they cannot Grant nor will they act unfaithfully to their Country  no  not in those things which they cannot Refuse But this is not to the Case in hand for it does not appear that the King has any desire to have this thing done nay Mr  Toland  does not pretend to it  But let us see here how the vain Man exposes himself for while he acknowleges no body to be privy to the Proposal but himself he Contradicts and Confounds himself most pitiously He protests pa  That he never knew or heard of any Design to introduce those two Noble Men or any other Foreigners into the House of Peers Exore tuo  Call Mr  Toland  to detect Mr  Toland  pa  My Proposal Contain'd nothing NEW with Respect either to the Thing or to the Persons  these are the Words quoted before but are absolutely necessary to be brought in again here because this Man can have the Assurance to pretend after this to be believ'd upon his Word That no body ever heard of this before  But suppose we should believe him for once and imagine that neither the King intended to Enoble these Persons that these two Persons did not desire to be Enobled or that the House of Peers ever intended to Repeal or Dispence with the Act for this End How then can he have the Front to tell the House of Peers to  their Faces that if they do not do it  it savours of Ingratitude and Partiality  He may be defy'd to show an Impudence like this since the Liberty of the Press which we now groan under has Plagu'd us I am sorry to use such Words in Print but when we are talking to such Men such Language is forc'd out of our Mouths as only proper to People of such Flagrant Merit  Again  If neither the King the House of Lords or the two foreign Noblemen themselves have so much as had any Thoughts of this matter how will this  false Accuser  make good his Charge that the opposing it is pointed at the Government or the Ministry The Charge is pointed at those Conspirators who are in the Design and as he declares neither the King the Ministry or the Parliament are acquainted with it then they are not pointed at But we know who are in it perhaps better than he pretends to know and as they are not too big to be charg'd so I must  ell him it is not his Raillery and  pretending it Points at the Government who are not concern'd in it that will wipe it off  The Case is  in short  this the Design is blown the Plot is discover'd and thereby defeated he thought it was Ripe before it was so and brought it out too soon He knows it well enough for his own Friends blame him for it and now he has no Remedy but to cry out  Jacobitism  and  Treason  in his opposers as if all the Men who are not for recommending  Foreigners  to the Nobility must be  Jacobites  or that all those who were not for a  StandingArmy  in time of Peace were for the Pretender and yet he confesses that I declar'd I was for an Army when there was any Danger of the Pretender and while either a foreign Enemy or private Disturbance threatned the Country  But the Man is enrag'd because he is frustrated He had said the House of Lords  will  open the Door to Foreigners and now he is assur'd they  wont  nay he knows he may with much more title to modesty say  they  will not  than he could before say  they will  and this makes him raving at every body that comes in his way  But let him Rave the Nation is awake  Britains  may be surpriz'd into such things as may be dangerous in their Examples  like this  but  in vain is the Net spread in the sight of any Bird  while they are awake and there Eyes are open they are in no Danger  I observe that this  Toland  makes himself merry with  De Foe  's Verses from  The True born Englishman  I have only this to say in that Case that if that Satyr was Just upon our Country and Nobility it certainly infers that as we are now arriv'd to an Excellence which we believe is not  outdone  by other Nations either in Science or Religion and moral Virtue  we should keep were we are  and mix no farther  if we can help it  unless we are sure to improve  but to let that go for a jest as it was intended  our business is not now so much about mixing of Blood  tho' that is not insignificant  but about mixing our Politicks The Argument which I brought from the  Treatment we gave to the  Scots  Nobility at the late Treaty of  Ʋnion  is good Sence and to the present purpose and the  Scots  Nobility are not now insensible of the weight of it tho' this  unfair Cavilling  Libeller Bustoons it and pretends that I alledge they were kept out  as Foreigners  Had he been in Temper to understand common Sense he would have seen the contrary He absurdly suggests that I hint they were kept out  as Foreigners No no  he cannot but allow that  I  and  every one else  knows that after the  Ʋnion  they were no more Foreigners but united but the Argument is just nevertheless  a fortiori  if these though our own Brethren were not allow'd to sit in the House of Lords but with such nicety restrain'd to a  Representative  and this in especial manner because of our  Judicature  being reposited with the Peers how much more then should we be backward to bring Strangers and real Foreigners to partake of that supreme Authority which the  Scotish  Nobility were deny'd  Let any Man but observe the wretched Temper of this slanderous  Libeller  The Author of  Mercurius Politicus  has called this a new Argument This Book he says  De Foe has the chief hand in also  which upon good enquiry and good evidence I am assur'd is false too but let the Author be who he will I say he has call'd this a  new Argument  which forsooth  Toland  will not only not allow but says 'tis  nonsence  Let us see the  nonsence  of it and if it be not a  new Argument  let him tell us when it was made use of before Be it new or old the force of it is full against him  The  Scots  Nobility antient beyond History and illustrious beyond Objection yet was deny'd upon the late  Coalition  of natural Priviledges were deny'd I say to be admitted into the  English  Peerage  other than by a Representative  because it was not thought that the supream Judicature of  England  could be communicated  with justice  to those who had not an equal concern in the Interest of the People of the Nation  Now to add a Word or two to that Part Would it not appear  Partial  against our Brethren of  Scotland  especially now after they are our Brethren that while they are excluded  Foreigners shall be admitted  Let him give a just Reason for this if he can  But to carry this a little farther because his Ignorance suffers him to pretend that the Reasons for admitting the  Scots  Nobility  only by a Representative number  was to Assert the proportion only to the value of Estates He shews by this that he has Folly and gross Ignorance equal to his Dishonesty for  though it is true that  the proportioning the value  c  was regarded in the asserting the Number of the  Scots  Representitives  in the House of Commons  yet this was the least Consideration  if any at all  in fixing the Number of the Peers for the limiting of which there were Reasons not proper to recite here and had he not been perfectly void of any Notion of what was then doing he would have known something of those Reasons  But not to resume the Debates of those Days seeing he puts me to it I shall start another Case as new as the former and yet as pungent as can be desired to the present point of admitting Foreigners At the time of the  Treaty of Ʋnion  notwithstanding the whole  Scots  Nation was to be incorporated into one body with the  English  and that the Subjects of both were to enjoy  equal Priviledges  yet so resolutely did our  English  Nobility insist upon not encorporating the Peerage of  Scotland  with themselves so jealous were they of pulling down the Fence about their own incommunicable Judicature that the Union is said not to allow even the Crown it self to create a  Scots  Peer  already a Peer  a Lord by an  English  Title so as to make him  an Hereditary Lord of Parliament  This is eminent in the Case of the late Duke  Hamilton  as Duke of  Brandon  and albeit the  Scots  do dispute this Point we do not find the House of Lords take yet any notice of that Dispute  And shall this Libeller tell us the House of Peers will be  Partial  and  Ʋngrateful  if they admit not  Germans  and Strangers into their Body while at the same time they have barr'd the Door against their own encorporated Brethren of  Scotland  Let  Toland  or any of the Conspirators  tell us  what was the Reason of this nicety if it was not that the  English  Nobility had seen Reason to think they ought to be exceeding cautious of ever making more mixtures  by Creation at least  with the Blood of their Nobility Rather let him prove that it would not be  Partial  and  Ʋngrateful  to the  Scots  Nobility if Foreigners should be receiv'd while the  Scots  are excluded and where is the general kindness which was promis'd and  exhorted to from the  Throne to be preserv'd and cultivated between the two united Kingdoms I say where is this mutual kindness if such Partiality should be practis'd on our Side  If indeed an  encorporate Ʋnion  shall come to be treated between his Majesty's Foreign Dominions and the Island of  Great Britain  then the Case will be alter'd and we should be all  willing and ready  no doubt  to receive a Representative of the  Hanover Nobility  into the Body of ours such as to the King and Parliament shall seem convenient But as to the Ennobling Foreigners it is firmly Provided against by the Constitution and our  Libelmaker  Prosesses that neither does he know that his Majesty intends it or these Foreign Noble Persons who  he has presum'd to Name  desire it I am sure the House of Peers have not Debated it What Assurance then must He and the Party who Dictate to him who for that Reason I justly call Conspirators  I say  what assurance must they have to be Officious in a thing of this Consequence to their Country  It has been suggested and I have Reason to believe it is so far true that the thing is in its  Embrio  that the Scheme is young and that the People concern'd were willing to let the Proposal take wind  this way  to see how it would Relish with the  British  Gentry and it was no imprudent step I acknowledge to do so for had they made the attempt at once before  they had made a judgment of things they would have run the hazard of a Miscarriage much more to their Disadvantage  Be it as it will  they have now made the Experiment and I dare say they will not find upon telling Noses that they have made one Convert by Mr  Toland  's  Anatomy  on the contrary there are some testimony of many Eyes being opened by the Detecting and justly Exposing the Traiterous Contrivance and I leave them to the Tryal when they will find the Persons Concern'd in another Condition to Repel them than perhaps they expected  It might be worth while to note here how Quaintly he would make it Criminal in me to speak of SOME  Honest and Loyal Patriots REMAINING in the Administration  as if I thereby insinuated that  some there  were otherwise and that there were  misunderstandings  amongst the Ministry That I would have it thought they were not all of a Piece and he would have this be thought Malicious Now by what has since hapned  in the Ministry it may be asked without any Reflection whether if I had look'd that way  tho' that is not granted  I were in the Right or not But it has been this Man's Talent many Years to be  an Accuser of the Brethren  and if it be true that he was Expell'd a University for  Faction  and  Error  if it be true  as I have heard  that he once impiously attempted to draw up a new Gospel no wonder he would now frame a new Constitution but this I shall have a farther occasion to talk with him about  All the residue of his Book  viz  His Answer to the Clergyman his Letters to the Archbishop and to the Dissenters and his wrangling and unseemly Language upon  De Foe  are worth no Notice at all either by me or any one else Perhaps such Language may be suitable to the Foreign  Noble Lord without a Name  who he pretends to write to and who  if he be any body  it's like is one of the  not many more  who he pretends to sollicit for after these are got in and who are  all  to be  British  Peers  ad Graecos Calendas    FINIS
