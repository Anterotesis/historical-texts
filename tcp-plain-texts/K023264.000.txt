 A LETTER TO Mr SECRETARY DUNDAS  IN ANSWER TO  HIS SPEECH  ON THE LATE PROCLAMATION  BY THOMAS PAINE  LONDON PRINTED FOR J PARSONS No PATERNOSTER ROW    PRICE SIXPENCE  TO Mr SECRETARY DUNDAS  SIR  London  June    AS you opened the debate in the House of Com∣mons May th on the Proclamation for suppressing Publications which that Proclamation without naming any calls wicked and seditious and as you applied those opprobious epithets to the works entitled "RIGHTS OF MAN" I think it unnecessary to offer any other reason for addressing this Letter to you  I begin then at once by declaring that I do not believe there are to be found in the writings of any author ancient or modern on the subject of Government a spirit of greater benignity and a stronger inculcation of moral principles than in  those which I have published They come Sir from a man who by having lived in different countries and under different systems of Govern∣ment and who being intimate in the construc∣tion of them is a better judge of the subject than it is possible that you from the want of those op∣portunities can beAnd besides this they come from an heart that knows not how to beguile  I will further say that when that moment ar∣rives in which the best consolation that shall be left will be that of looking back on some past actions more virtuous more meritorious than the rest I shall then with happiness remember among other things I have written the RIGHTS OF MAN As to what Proclamations or Prosecutions or Placemen or placeexpectantsthose who pos∣sess or those who are gaping for office may say or them it will not alter their character either with the world or with me  Having Sir made this declaration I shall pro∣ceed to remark not particularly upon your own Speech on that occasion but on any other Speech to which your Motion on that day gave rise and I shall begin with that of Mr ADAM  This Gentleman accuses me of  not  having done the very thing that  I have done  and which he says if I  had  done he should not have accused me  Mr ADAM in his Speech see the Morning Chronicle of May says  That he had well  considered the subject of Constitutional Publi∣cations and was by no means ready to say but the contrary that books of science upon Go∣vernment though recommending a doctrine or system different from the form of our Constitu∣tion meaning that of England were fit objects of prosecution that if he did he must condemn which he meant not to do HARRINGTON for his Oceana SIR THOMAS MORE for his Eu∣topia and HUME for his idea of a perfect Com∣monwealth But continued Mr Adam the Publication of Mr PAINE was very different for it reviled what was  most sacred  in the Con∣stitution destroyed every principle of subordi∣nation and  established nothing in their room  I readily perceive that Mr ADAM had not read the  Second  Part of the  Rights of Man  and I am put under the necessity either of submitting to an er∣roneous charge or of justifying myself against it and I certainly shall prefer the latterIf then I shall prove to Mr ADAM that in my reasoning upon Systems of Government in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  I have shewn as clearly I think as words can convey ideas a certain system of Go∣vernment and that not existing in theory only but already in full and established practice and systematically and practically free from all the vices and defects of the English Government and capa∣ble of producing more happiness to the People  and that also with an eightieth part of the Taxes which the present System of English Government consumes I hope he will do me the justice when he next goes to the House to get up and confess he had been mistaken in saying that I had  esta∣blished nothing and that I had destroyed every princi∣ple of subordination  Having thus opened the case I now come to the point  In the Second Part of RIGHTS OF MAN I have distinguished Government into two classes or systems the one the hereditary system the other the representative system  In the First Part of  Rights of Man  I have en∣deavoured to shew and I challenge any man to refute it that there does not exist a right to esta∣blish Hereditary Government or in other words Hereditary Governors because Hereditary Go∣vernment always means a Government yet to come and the case always is that the People who are to live afterwards have always the same right to chuse a Government for themselves as the peo∣had who lived before them  In the Second Part of  Rights of Man  I have not repeated those arguments because they are irrefutable but have confined myself to shew the defects of what is called Hereditary Government or Hereditary Succession that it must from the nature of it throw Government into the hands of men totally unworthy of it from want of prin∣ciple  or unfitted for it from want of capacity James the IId is recorded as an instance of the first of these cases and instances are to be found almost all over Europe to prove the truth of the latter  To shew the absurdity of the Hereditary System still more strongly I will now put the following caseTake any fifty men promiscuously and it will be very extraordinary if out of that number one man should be found whose principles and talents taken together for some might have prin∣ciples and others have talents would render him a person truly fitted to fill any very extraordinary office of National Trust If then such a fitness of character could not be expected to be found in more than one person out of fifty it would happen but once in a thousand years to the eldest son of any one family admitting each on an average to hold the office twenty years Mr Adam talks of something in the Constitution which he calls  most sacred  but I hope he does not mean hereditary succession a thing which appears to me a violation of every order of nature and of common sense  When I look into History and see the multitudes of men otherwise virtuous who have died and their families been ruined in defence of knaves and fools and which they would not have done had they reasoned at all upon the system I do not know a greater good that an individual can render to mankind than to endeavour to  break the chains of political superstition Those chains are now dissolving fast and proclamations and prosecutions will serve but to hasten that dis∣solution  Having thus spoken of the Hereditary System as a bad system and subject to every possible defect I now come to the Representative System and this Mr ADAM will find stated in the Second Part of Rights of Man not only as the best but as the only  Theory  of Government under which the li∣berties of a people can be permanently secure  But it is needless now to talk of mere Theory since there is already a Government in full prac∣tice established upon that Theory or in other words upon the Rights of Man and has been so for almost twenty years Mr Pitt in a speech of his some short time since said  That there never did and never could exist a Government esta∣blished upon those Rights and that if it began at noon it would end at night  Mr Pitt is not yet arrived to the degree of a schoolboy in this species of knowledge His practice has been con∣fined to the means of  extorting revenue  and his boast has been  how much  Whereas the boast of the System of Government that I am speaking of is not how much but how little  The System of Government purely representa∣tive unmixed with any thing of hereditary non∣sense began in America I will now compare the  effects of that system of Government with the sys∣tem of Government in England both during and since the close of the war  So powerful is the Representative System first by combining and consolidating all the parts of a country together however great the extent and secondly by admitting of none but men properly qualified into the Government or dismissing them if they prove to be otherwise that America was enabled thereby totally to defeat and overthrow all the schemes and projects of the Hereditary Govern∣ment of England against her As the establish∣ment of the Revolution and Independence of America is a proof of this fact it is needless to enlarge upon it  I now come to the comparative effect of the two Systems  since  the close of the war and I request Mr Adam to attend to it  America had internally sustained the ravage of upwards of seven years of war which England had not England sustained only the expence of the war whereas America sustained not only the expence but the destruction of property committed by  both  armies Not a house was built during that period and many thousands were destroyed The farms and plantations along the coast of the Coun∣try for more than a thousand miles were laid waste Her commerce was annihilated Her ships were either taken or had rotted within her own  harbour The credit of her funds had fallen up∣wards of ninety per cent that is an original hundred pounds would not sell for ten pounds In fine she was apparently put back an hundred years when the war closed which was not the case with England  But such was the event that the same Repre∣sentative System of Government though since better organized which enabled her to conquer enabled her also to recover and she now presents a more flourishing condition and a more happy and harmonized society under that system of Go∣vernment than any country in the world can boast under any other Her towns are rebuilt much better than before her farms and plantations are in higher improvement than ever her com∣merce is spread over the world and her funds have risen from less than ten pounds the hundred to up∣wards of one hundred and twenty Mr Pitt and his colleagues talk of the things that have happen∣ed in his boyish Administration without knowing what greater things have happened elsewhere and under other systems of Government  I next come to state the expence of the two systems as they now stand in each of the countries but it may first be proper to observe that Go∣vernment in America is what it ought to be a mat∣ter of honour and trust and not made a trade of for the purpose of lucre  The whole amount of the nett taxes in England exclusive of the expence of collection of draw∣backs of seizures and condemnations of fines and penalties of fees of office of litigations and in∣formers which are some of the blessed means of enforcing them is seventeen millions Of this sum about nine millions go for the payment of the interest of the National Debt and the re∣mainder being about eight millions is for the cur∣rent annual expences Thus much for one side of the case I now come to the other  The expence of all the several departments of the general Representative Government of the United States of America extending over a space of country nearly ten times larger than England is two hundred and ninetyfour thousand five hundred and fiftyeight dollars which at s d per dollar is l s sterling and is thus apportioned  Expence of the Executive Department     l  s  The Office of the Presidency at which the President receives nothing for himself      Vice President      Chief Justice      Five associate Justices      Nineteen Judges of Districts and Attorney General      Legislative Department  Members of Congress at six dollars l s per day their Secretaries Clerks Chaplains Messengers Doorkeepers c      Treasury Department  Secretary Assistant Comptroller Auditor Trea∣surer Register and LoanOfficeKeeper in each State together with all necessary Clerks OfficeKeepers c      Department of State including Foreign Affairs  Secretary Clerks c c      Department of War  Secretary Clerks Paymasters Commissioner c      Commissioners for settling Old Accounts  The whole Board Clerks c      Incidental and Contingent Expences  For Firewood Stationary Printing c      Total      On account of the incursions of the Indians on the back settlements Congress is at this time ob∣liged to keep six thousand militia in pay in addi∣tion to a regiment of foot and a battalion of ar∣tillery which it always keeps and this increases the expence of the War Department to dollars which is l sterling but when Peace shall be concluded with the Indians the greatest part of this expence will cease and the total amount of the expence of Government including that of the army will not amount to one hundred  thousand pounds sterling which as has been al∣ready stated is but an eightieth part of the expences of the English Government  I request Mr Adam and Mr Dundas and all those who are talking of Constitutions and bles∣sings and Kings and Lords and the Lord knows what to look at this statement Here is a form and system of Government that is better orga∣nized and better administered than any Govern∣ment in the world and that for less than one hun∣dred thousand pounds per annum and yet every Member of Congress receives as a compensation for his time and attendance on public business one pound seven shillings per day which is at the rate of nearly five hundred pounds a year  This is a Government that has nothing to fear It needs no proclamations to deter people from writing and reading It needs no political super∣stition to support it It was by encouraging discus∣sion and rendering the press free upon all subjects of Government that the principles of Government became understood in America and the people are now enjoying the present blessings under it You hear of no riots tumults and disorders in that country because there exists no cause to pro∣duce them Those things are never the effect of Freedom but of restraint oppression and exces∣sive taxation  In America there is not that class of poor and  wretched people that are so numerously dispersed all over England and who are to be told by a Proclamation that they are happy and this is in a great measure to be accounted for not by the difference of Proclamations but by the difference of Governments and the difference of Taxes be∣tween that country and this What the labouring people of that country earn they apply to their own use and to the education of their children and do not pay it away in Taxes as fast as they earn it to support Court extravagance and a long enormous list of Placemen and Pensioners and besides this they have learned the manly doctrine of reverenc∣ing themselves and consequently of respecting each other and they laugh at those imaginary be∣ings called Kings and Lords and all the fraudulent trumpery of Courts  When Placemen and Pensioners or those who expect to be such are lavish in praise of a Govern∣ment it is not a sign of its being a good one The pension list alone in England see Sir John Sin∣clair's History of the Revenue page of the Ap∣pendix is One Hundred and Seven Thousand Four Hundred and Four Pounds  which is more than the expences of the whole Government of America amount to  And I am now more convinced than before that the offer that was made to me of a Thousand Pounds for the copyright of the Se∣cond Part of the  Rights of Man  together with the  remaining copyright of the First Part was to have effected by a quick suppression what is now at∣tempted to be done by a Prosecution The con∣nection which the person who made that offer has with the King's Printing Office may furnish part of the means of enquiring into this affair when the Ministry should please to bring their Prosecution to issue But to return to my subject  I have said in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  and I repeat it here that the service of any man whether called King President Senator Legis∣lator or any thing else cannot be worth more to any country in the regular routine of office than Ten Thousand Pounds per annum We have a better man in America and more of a Gentleman than any King I ever knew of who does not occa∣sion even half that expence for though the salary is fixed at Five Thousand Six hundred and Twen∣tyFive Pounds he does not accept it and it is only the incidental expences that are paid out of it The name by which a man is called is of itself but an empty thing It is worth and character alone which can render him valuable for without these Kings and Lords and Presidents are but jingling names  But without troubling myself about Constitutions of Government I have shewn in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  that an alliance may be formed between England France and America and that  the expences of Government in England may be put back to one million and an half viz  Civil expence of Government  £  Army    Navy         And even this sum is fifteen times greater than the expences of Government are in America and it is also greater than the whole peace establishment of England amounted to about an hundred years ago So much has the weight and oppression of Taxes encreased since the Revolution and especially since the year  To shew that the sum of l is sufficient to defray all the civil expences of Government I have in that work annexed the following estimate for any country of the same extent as England  In the first place three hundred Representatives fairly elected are sufficient for all the purposes to which Legislation can apply and preferable to a larger number  If then an allowance at the rate of five hun∣dred pounds per ann be made for every Represen∣tative deducting for nonattendance the expence if the whole number attended six months each year would be  The Official Departments could not possibly exceed the following number with the salaries annexed viz  Three Offices at  l each    Ten ditto at  l each    Twenty ditto at  l each    Forty ditto at  l each    Two hundred ditto at  l each    Three hundred ditto at  l each    Five hundred ditto at  l each    Seven hundred ditto at  l each          £  If a Nation chose it might deduct four per cent from all the offices and make one of twenty thousand pounds per annum and stile the person who should fill it King or Majesty or Madjesty or give him any other title  Taking however this sum of one million and an half as an abundant supply for all the expences of Government under any form whatever there will remain a surplus of nearly six million and a half out of the present Taxes after paying the in∣terest of the National Debt and I have shewn in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  what appears to me the best mode of applying the surplus money for I am now speaking of expences and savings and not of systems of Government  I have in the first place estimated the poorrates at two millions annually and shewn that the first effectual step would be to abolish the poorrates  entirely which would be a saving of two millions to the housekeepers and to remit four millions out of the surplus taxes to the poor to be paid to them in money in proportion to the number of children in each family and the number of aged persons  I have estimated the number of persons of both sexes in England of fifty years of age and upwards at and have taken onethird of this num∣ber viz to be poor people  To save long calculations I have taken of them to be upwards of fifty years of age and under sixty and the other to be sixty years and upwards and to allow six pounds per ann to the former class and ten pounds per ann to the latter The expence of which will be  Seventy thousand persons at l per ann    Seventy thousand persons at l per ann       £  There will then remain of the four millions l I have stated two different methods of appropriating this money The one is to pay it in proportion to the number of children in each family at the rate of three or four pounds per ann for each child the other is to apportion it ac∣cording to the expence of living in different coun∣ties but in either of these cases it would together with the allowance to be made to the aged com∣pletely  take off taxes from onethird of all the families in England besides relieving all the other families from the burthen of poorrates  The whole number of families in England lot∣ting five souls to each family is one million four hundred thousand of which I take one third viz to be poor families who now pay four million of taxes and that the poorest pays at least four guineas a year and that the other thirteen millions are paid by the other twothirds The plan therefore as stated in the work is first to remit or repay as is already stated this sum of four millions to the poor because it is impossible to separate them from the others in the present mode of collecting taxes on articles of consump∣tion and secondly to abolish the poorrates the house and window light tax and to change the Commutation Tax into a progressive Tax on large estates the particulars of all which are set forth in the work and to which I desire Mr ADAM to refer for particulars I shall here con∣tent myself with saying that to a town of the population of Manchester it will make a dif∣ference in its favour compared with the present state of things of upwards of fifty thousand pounds annually and so in proportion to all other places throughout the nation This certainly is of more consequence than that the same sums should be collected to be afterwards spent by riotous and  profligate courtiers and in nightly revels at the Star and Garter Tavern Pall Mall  I will conclude this part of my letter with an extract from the Second Part of  Rights of Man  which Mr Dundas a man rolling in luxury at the expence of the nation has branded with the epithet of "wicked"  By the operation of this plan the poor laws those instruments of civil torture will be su∣perseded and the wasteful expence of litigation prevented The hearts of the humane will not be shocked by ragged and hungry children and persons of seventy and eighty years of age begging for bread The dying poor will not be dragged from place to place to breathe their last as a reprisal of parish upon parish Wi∣dows will have a maintenance for their chil∣dren and not be carted away on the death of their husbands like culprits and criminals and children will no longer be considered as increas∣ing the distresses of their parents The haunts of the wretched will be known because it will be to their advantage and the number of petty crimes the offspring of poverty and distress will be lessened The poor as well as the rich will then be interested in the support of Government and the cause and apprehension of riots and tumults will ceaseYe who sit in ease and solace yourselves in plenty and such  there are in Turkey and Russia as well as in England and who say to yourselves  are we not well off  have ye thought of these things When ye do ye will cease to speak and feel for yourselves alone  Rights of Man Part II page  After this remission of four millions be made and the poor Rates and House and Windowlight Tax be abolished and the Commutation Tax changed there will still remain nearly one million and an half of surplus Taxes and as by an alli∣ance between England France and America armies and navies will in a great measure be rendered unnecessary and as men who have either been brought up in or long habited to those lines of life are still citizens of a nation in com∣mon with the rest and have a right to participate in all plans of National benefit it is stated in that work Rights of Man part II to apply annually l out of the surplus taxes to this purpose in the following manner  To fifteen thousand disbanded soldiers s per week each clear of deductions during life    Additional pay to the remaining soldiers per ann    To the officers of the disbanded corps during life the same sum of    To fifteen thousand disbanded sailors s per week during life    Additional pay to the remaining sailors    To the officers of the disbanded part of the Na∣vy during life       L    The limits to which it is proper to confine this Letter will not admit of my entering into further particulars I address it to Mr Dundas because he took the lead in the debate and he wishes I suppose to appear conspicuous but the purport of it is to justify myself from the charge which Mr Adam has made  This Gentleman as has been observed in the beginning of this Letter considers the writings of Harrington Moore and Hume as justifiable and legal Publications because they reasoned by comparison though in so doing they shewed plans and systems of Government not only different from but preferable to that of England and he accuses me of endeavouring to confuse instead of producing a system in the room of that which I have reasoned against whereas the fact is that I have not only reasoned by comparison of the Representative system against the Hereditary system but I have gone further for I have pro∣duced an instance of a Government established en∣tirely on the Representative system under which much greater happiness is enjoyed much fewer Tax∣es required and much higher credit is established than under the system of Government in England The funds in England have risen since the war only from l to l and they have been down since the Proclamation to l whereas the Funds in America rose in the mean time from l to l  His charge against me "of destroying every principle of subordination" is equally as ground∣less which even a single paragraph from the work will prove and which I shall here quote  Formerly when divisions arose respecting Governments recourse was had to the sword and a civil war ensued That savage custom is exploded by the new system and  recourse is had to a National Convention  Discussion and the general will arbitrates the question and to this private opinion yields with a good grace and  order is preserved uninterrupted    Rights of Man Part II p  That two different charges should be brought at the same time the one by a Member of the Legislature for  not  doing a certain thing and the other by the Attorney General for  doing  it is a strange jumble of contradictions I have now justified myself or the work rather against the first by stating the case in this letter and the justification of the other will be undertaken in its proper place But in any case the work will go on  I shall now conclude this Letter with saying that the only objection I found against the plan and principles contained in the Second Part of  Rights of Man  when I had written the book was that they would beneficially interest at least ninetynine persons out of every hundred throughout the nation and therefore would not leave sufficient  room for men to act from the direct and disin∣terested principle of honour but the prosecution now commenced has fortunately removed that ob∣jection and the approvers and protectors of that work now feel the immediate impulse of honour added to that of National Interest  I am Mr Dundas Not your obedient humble Servant But the contrary THOMAS PAINE  Copied from the Paper entitled "THE ARGUS" June
