 THE LUCUBRATIONS OF  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Revised and Corrected by the Author  VOL I  Homer  LONDON  Printed by  John Nutt  and sold by  John Mor∣phew  near  StationersHall  MDCCXII  TO M  r  Maynwaring  SIR  THE State of Conversa∣tion and Business in this Town having been long perplexed with Pretenders in both Kinds in order to open Men's Eyes against such Abuses it appeared no unprofitable Un∣dertaking to publish a Paper which should observe upon the Manners of the Pleasurable as well as the Busie Part of Mankind To make this generally read it seemed the most proper Method to form it by Way of a Let∣ter of Intelligence consisting of such Parts as might gratify the Curiosity of Persons of all Conditions and of each Sex  But a Work of this Nature re∣quiring Time to grow into the Notice of the World it hap∣pened very luckily that a little before I had resolved upon this Design a Gentleman had written Predictions and Two or Three other Pieces in my Name which had render'd it famous thro' all Parts of  Europe  and by an inimi∣table Spirit and Humour raised it to as high a Pitch of Reputation as it could possibly arrive at  By this good Fortune the Name of  Isaac Bickerstaff  gained an Audience of all who had any Taste of Wit and the Addition of the ordinary Occurrences of common Journals of News brought in a Multitude of other Readers I could not I confess long keep up the Opinion of the Town that these Lucubrations  were written by the same Hand with the first Works which were published under my Name but before I lost the Participation of that Author's Fame I had al∣ready found the Advantage of his Authority to which I owe the sudden Acceptance which my Labours met with in the World  The general Purpose of this Paper is to expose the false Arts of Life to pull off the Disguises of Cunning Vanity and Affecta∣tion and to recommend a general Simplicity in our Dress our Dis∣course and our Behaviour No Man has a better Judgment for the Discovery or a nobler Spirit for the Contempt of all Impo∣sture than your self which Qua∣lities render you the most proper Patron for the Author of these Essays In the general the De∣sign  however executed has meet with so great Success that there is hardly a Name now eminent a∣mong us for Power Wit Beauty Valour or Wisdom which is not subscribed for the Encourage∣ment of the Two Volumes in  Octavo  on a  Royal  or  Medium  Pa∣per This is indeed an Honour for which it is impossible to ex∣press a suitable Gratitude and there is nothing could be an Ad∣dition to the Pleasure I take in it but the Reflection that it gives me the most conspicuous Occasion I can ever have of subscribing my self  SIR  Your most Obliged most Obedient and most Humble Servant  Isaac Bickerstaff  N  o  THE TATLER  BY Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Quicquid agunt Homines uostri Farrago Libelli  Tuesday April  THO' the other Papers which are pub∣lished for the Use of the good People of  England  have certainly very wholsom Effects and are laudable in their parti∣cular Kinds they do not seem to come up to the main Design of such Narrations which I humbly presume should be principally intended for the Use of politick Persons who are so publickspirited as to neglect their own Affairs to look into Trans∣actions of State Now these Gentlemen for the most Part being Persons of strong Zeal and weak Intellects It is both a Charitable and Necessary Work to offer something whereby such worthy and wellaffected Members of the Commonwealth may be instructed after their Reading  what to  think  which shall be the End and Purpose of this my Paper Wherein I shall from Time to Time Report and Consider all Matters of what Kind so∣ever that shall occur to Me and publish such my Advices and Reflections every  Tuesday Thursday  and  Saturday  in the Week for the Convenience of the Post I resolved also to have something which may be of Entertainment to the Fair Sex in Honour of whom I have taken the Title of this Paper I therefore earnestly desire all Persons without Di∣stinction to take it in for the present  Gratis  and hereafter at the Price of One Penny forbidding all Hawkers to take more for it at their Peril And I desire all Persons to consider that I am at a very great Charge for proper Materials for this Work as well as that before I resolved upon it I had settled a Correspondence in all Parts of the Known and Knowing World And forasmuch as this Globe is not trodden upon by meer Drudges of Business only but that Men of Spirit and Genius are justly to be esteemed as considerable Agents in it we shall not upon a Dearth of News present you with musty Foreign Edicts or dull Proclamations but shall divide our Relation of the Passages which occur in Action or Discourse throughout this Town as well as elsewhere under such Dates of Places as may prepare you for the Matter you are to expect in the following Manner  All Accounts of  Gallantry Pleasure  and  En∣tertainment  shall be under the Article of  White  's  Chocolatehouse Poetry  under that of  Will  's  Coffeehouse Learning  under the Title of  Grae∣cian Foreign  and  Domestick News  you will have from  St James  's  Coffeehouse  and what else I have to offer on any other Subject shall be dated from my own  Apartment  I once more desire my Reader to consider That as I cannot keep an ingenious Man to go daily to  Will  's under Twopence each Day mereby for his Charges to  White  's under Sixpence nor to the  Graecian  without allowing him some Plain  Spa∣nish  to be as able as others at the Learned Table and that a good Observer cannot speak with even  Kidney  at St  James  's without clean Linnen I say these Considerations will I hope make all Per∣sons willing to comply with my Humble Request when my  Gratis  Stock is exhausted of a Penny apiece especially since they are sure of some pro∣per Amusement and that it is impossible for me to want Means to entertain 'em having besides the Force of my own Parts the Power of Divina∣tion and that I can by casting a Figure tell you all that will happen before it comes to pass  But this last Faculty I shall use very sparingly and speak but of few Things 'till they are passed for fear of divulging Matters which may offend our Superiors  White's Chocolatehouse  April  THE deplorable Condition of a very pretty Gentleman who walks here at the Hours when Men of Quality first appear is what is very much lamented His History is That on the th of  September  being in his One and twentieth Year he was washing his Teeth at a Tavern Window in  Pallmall  when a fine Equipage passed by and in it a young Lady who looked up at him away goes the Coach and the young Gentleman pulled off his Night∣cap and instead of rubbing his Gums as he ought to do out of the Window till about Four a Clock sits him down and spoke not a Word till Twelve at Night after which he began to enquire If any Body knew the LadyThe Company asked What Lady But he said  no more 'till they broke up at Six in the Mor∣ning All the ensuing Winter he went from Church to Church every Sunday and from Play∣house to Playhouse every Night in the Week but could never find the Original of the Picture which dwelt in his Bosom In a Word his Attention to any Thing but his Passion was utterly gone He has lost all the Money he ever played for and been confuted in every Argument he has enter'd upon since the Moment he first saw her He is of a Noble Family has naturally a very good Air and is of a frank honest Temper But this Passion has so extremely mauled him that his Features are set and uninformed and his whole Visage is deaden'd by a long Absence of Thought He never appears in any Alacrity but when raised by Wine at which Time he is sure to come hither and throw away a great deal of Wit on Fellows who have no Sense fur∣ther than just to observe That our poor Lover has most Understanding when he is drunk and is least in his Senses when he is sober  Will's Coffeehouse  April  On  Thursday  last was acted for the Bene∣fit of Mr  Betterton  the Celebrated Comedy called  Love for Love  Those excellent Players Mrs  Barry  Mrs  Bracegirdle  and Mr  Dogget  though not at present concerned in the House acted on that Occasion There has not b en known so great a Concourse of Persons of Di∣stinction as at that Time the Stage it self was cover'd with Gentlemen and Ladies and when the Curtain was drawn it discovered even there a very splendid Audience This unusual Encouragement which was given to a Play for the Advantage of so great an Actor gives an undeniable Instance That the true Relish for Manly Entertainments and Rational Plea∣sures  is not wholly lost All the Parts were acted to Perfection the Actors were careful of their Carriage and no one was guilty of the Affection to insert Witticisms of his own but a due Respect was had to the Audience for en∣couraging this accomplish'd Player It is not now doubted but Plays will revive and take their usual Place in the Opinion of Persons of Wit and Merit notwithstanding their late Apo∣stacy in Favour of Dress and Sound This Place is very much altered since Mr  Dryden  frequen∣ted it where you used to see  Songs Epigrams  and  Satyrs  in the Hands of every Man you met you have now only a Pack of Cards and in∣stead of the Cavils about the Turn of the Ex∣pression the Elegance of the Style and the like the Learned now dispute only about the Truth of the Game But however the Com∣pany is altered all have shewn a great Respect for Mr  Betterton  And the very Gaming Part of this House have been so much touched with a Sense of the Uncertainty of Humane Affairs which alter with themselves every Moment that in this Gentleman they pitied  Mark An∣thony  of  Rome Hamlet  of  Denmark Mithri∣datus  of  Pontus Theodosius  of  Greece  and  Henry  the Eighth of  England  It is well known he has been in the Condition of each of those illustrious Personages for several Hours toge∣ther and behaved himself in those high Sta∣tions in all the Changes of the Scene with suitable Dignity For these Reasons we in∣tend to repeat this Favour to him on a proper Occasion lest he who can instruct us so well in personating Feigned Sorrows should be lost to us by suffering under Real Ones The Town is at present in very great Ex∣pectation of seeing a Comedy now in Rehear∣sal  which is the th Production of my Ho∣noured Friend Mr  Thomas D'Urfey  who be∣sides his great Abilities in the Dramatick has a peculiar Talent in the Lyrick Way of Writing and that with a Manner wholly new and un∣known to the Ancient  Greeks  and  Romans  where∣in he is but faintly imitated in the Translations of the Modern  Italian  Opera's  St James's Coffeehouse  April  Letters from the  Hague  of the th say That MajorGeneral  Cadogan  was gone to  Brussels  with Orders to disperse proper Instructions for assembling the whole Force of the Allies in  Flanders  in the Beginning of the next Month The late Offers concerning Peace were made in the Style of Persons who think themselves upon equal Terms But the Allies have so just a Sense of their present Advantages that they will not admit of a Treaty except  France  of∣fers what is more suitable to her present Con∣dition At the same Time we make Prepara∣tions as if we were alarmed by a greater Force than that which we are carrying into the Field Thus this Point seems now to be argued Sword in Hand This was what a Great General al∣luded to when being asked the Names of those who were to be Plenipotentiaries for the ensu∣suing Peace answered with a serious Air  There are about an Hundred thousand of us  Mr  Kid∣ney  who has the Ear of the greatest Politicians that come hither tells me There is a Mail come in to Day with Letters dated  Hague A∣pril    N S  which say a Design of bringing Part of our Troops into the Field at the latter End of this Month is now altered to a Resolu∣tion of marching towards the Camp about the th of the next There happened t'other Day in the Road of  Scheveling  an Engagement be∣tween  a Privateer of  Zealand  and one of  Dun∣kirk  The  Dunkirker  carrying Pieces of Cannon was taken and brought into the Texel It is said the Courier of Monsieur  Rouille  is re∣turned to him from the Court of  France  Mon∣sieur  Vendo  e  being reinstated in the Favour of the Dutchess of  Burgundy  is to command in  Flanders  Mr  Kidney  added That there were Letters of the th from  Ghent  which give an Ac∣count That the Enemy had formed a Design to surprize two Battalions of the Allies which lay at  Alost  but those Battalions received Advice of their March and retired to  Dendermond  Lieutenant General  Wood  appeared on this Oc∣casion at the Head of Foot and Horse upon which the Enemy withdrew without ma∣king any further Attempt  From my own Apartment  I am sorry I am obliged to trouble the Pub∣lick with so much Discourse upon a Matter which I at the very first mentioned as a Tri∣fle  viz  the Death of Mr  Partridge  under whose Name there is an  Almanack  come out for the Year In one Page of which it is asserted by the said  John Partridge  That he is still living and not only so but that he was also living some Time before and even at the Instant when I writ of his Death I have in another Place and in a Paper by it self suf∣ficiently convinced this Man that he is dead and if he has any Shame I don't doubt but that by this Time he owns it to all his Acquain∣tance For tho' the Legs and Arms and whole Body of that Man may still appear and perform their animal Functions yet since as I have elsewhere observed his Art is gone the Man is gone I am as I said concerned that this  little Matter should make so much Noise but since I am engaged I take my self obliged in Honour to go on in my Lucubrations and by the Help of these Arts of which I am Master as well as my Skill in Astrological Specula∣tions I shall as I see Occasion proceed to con∣fute other dead Men who pretend to be in Be∣ing that they are actually deceased I therefore give all Men fair Warning to mend their Man∣ners for I shall from Time to Time print Bills of Mortality and I beg Pardon of all such who shall be named therein if they who are good for nothing shall find themselves in the Number of the Deceased  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd April  to  Thursd April    Will's Coffeehouse  April  THere has lain all this Evening on the Ta∣ble the following Poem The Subject of it being Matter very useful for Families I thought it deserved to be considered and made more publick The Turn the Poet gives it is very happy but the Foundation is from a real Accident which happened among my Acquain∣tance A young Gentleman of a great Estate fell desperately in Love with a great Beauty of very high Quality but as illnatured as long Flattery and an habitual Self will could make her However my young Spark ventures upon her like a Man of Quality without be∣ing acquainted with her or having ever saluted  her till it was a Crime to kiss any Woman else Beauty is a Thing which palls with Pos∣session and the Charms of this Lady soon wanted the Support of good Humour and Com∣plaisancy of Manners Upon this my Spark flies to the Bottle for Relief from his Satiety She disdains him for being tired with that for which all Men envied him and he never came Home but it wasWas there no Sot that would stay longer Would any Man living but you Did I leave all the World for this Usage To which heMadam Split me you are very impertinent In a Word this Match was Wedlock in its most terrible Ap∣pearances She at last weary of Railing to no Purpose applies to a good Uncle who gives her a Bottle of Water The Vertue of this Powerful Liquor said he is such that if the Woman you marry proves a Scold which it seems my dear Neece is your Misfortune as it was your good Mother's before you let her hold six Spoonfuls in her Mouth for a full half Hour after you come HomeBut I find I am not in Humour for telling a Tale and no∣thing in Nature is so ungrateful as StoryTelling against the Grain therefore take it as the Author has given it you  The MEDECIN  A Talefor the Ladies  Miss  Molly  a fam'd Toast was Fair and Young  Had Wealth and Charmsbut then she had a Tongue  From Morn' to Night th' Eternal Larum run  Which often lost those Hearts her Eyes had won  Sir  John  was smitten and confess'd his Flame  Sigh'd out the usual Time then wed the Dame  Possess'd he thought of every Joy of Life  But his Dear  Molly  prov'd a very Wife  Excess of Fondness did in Time decline  Madam  lov'd Money and the  Knight  lov'd Wine  From whence some petty Discords would arise  As  You're a Fool  and  You are mighty Wife  Tho' he and all the World allow'd her Wit  Her Voice was shrill and rather loud than sweet  When she beganfor Hat and Sword he'd call  Then after a faint KissCry B'y Dear  Moll  Supper and Friends expect me at the  Rose  And what Sir  John  You'll get your usual Dose  Go stink of Smoak and guzzle nasty Wine  Sure never Virtuous Love was us'd like Mine  Oft as the watchful Bellman march'd his Round  At a fresh Bottle gay Sir  John  he found  By Four the  Knight  would get his Business done  And only then reel'd off because alone  Full well he knew the dreadful Storm to come  But arm'd with  Bourdeaux  he durst venture Home  My Lady with her Tongue was still prepar'd  She rattled loud and he impatient heard  'Tis a fine Hour In a sweet Pickle made  And this Sir  John  is ev'ry Day the Trade  Here I sit moping all the livelong Night  Devour'd with Spleen and Stranger to Delight  Till Morn' sends stagg'ring Home a Drunken Beast  Resolv'd to break my Heart as well as Rest  Hey Hoop d'ye hear my damn'd obstrep'rous Spouse  What can't you find one Bed about the House  Will that perpetual Clack lie never still  That Rival to the Softness of a Mill  Some Couch and distant Room must be my Choice  Where I may sleep uncurs'd with Wife and Noise  Long this uncomfortable Life they led  With snarling Meals and each a separate Bed  To an old Uncle oft she would complain  Beg his Advice and scarce from Tears refrain  Old  Wisewood  smoak'd the Matter as it was  Cheer up cry'd he and I'll remove the Cause  A wond'rous Spring within my Garden flows  Of Sov'reign Virtue chiefly to compose  Domestick Jarrs and Matrimonial Strife  The best Elixir t'appease Man and Wife  Strange are th' Effects the Qualitles Divine  'Tis Water call'd but worth its Weight in Wine  If in his sullen Airs Sir  John  should come  Three Spoonfuls take hold in your Mouththen Mum  Smile and look Pleas'd when he shall Rage and Scold  Still in your Mouth the Healing Cordial hold  One Month this Sympathetick Med'cin try'd  He'll grow a Lover you a Happy Bride  But dearest Neece keep this Grand Secret close  Or ev'ry prat'ling Hussy'll beg a Dose  A WaterBottle's brought for her Relief  Not  Nants  could sooner ease the Lady's Grief  Her busy Thoughts are on the Tryal bent  And Femalelike impatient for th' Event  The Bonny Knight reels Home exceeding clear  Prepar'd for Clamour and Domestick War  Entring he criesHey Where's our Thunder fled  No Hurricane  Betty  's your Lady dead  Madam aside an ample Mouthful takes  Court'sys looks Kind but not a Word she speaks  Wond'ring he star'd scarcely his Eyes believ'd  But found his Ears agreeably deceiv'd  Why How now  Molly  What's the Crotchet now  She smiles and answers only with a Bow  Then clasping her aboutWhy let me die  These Nightclothes  Moll  become thee mightily  With that he sigh'd her Hand began to press  And  Betty  calls her Lady to undress  Nay kiss me  Molly  for I'm much inclin'd  Her Lace she cuts to take him in the Mind  Thus the fond Pair to Bed enamour'd went  The Lady pleas'd and the good Knight con∣tent  For many Days these fond Endearments pass'd  The reconciling Bottle fails at last  'Twas us'd and goneThen Midnight Storms arose  And Looks and Words the Union discompose  Her Coach is order'd and Posthaste she flies  To beg her Uncle for some fresh Supplies  Transported does the strange Effects relate  Her Knight's Conversion and her happy State  Why Neece says heI prithee apprehend  The Water's WaterBe thy self thy Friend  Such Beauty would the coldest Husband warm  But your provoking Tongue undoes the Charm  Be silent and complyingYou'll soon find  Sir  John  without a Med'cin will be kind  St James's Coffeehouse  April  Letters from  Venice  say The Disappointment of their Expectation to see his  Danish  Majesty  has very much disquieted the Court of  Rome  Our last Advices from  Germany  inform us That the Minister of  Hanover  has urg'd the Council at  Ratisbonne  to exert themselves in Behalf of the Common Cause and taken the Liberty to say That the Dignity the Virtue the Pru∣dence of his Electoral Highness his Master were called to the Head of their Affairs in vain if they thought fit to leave him naked of the proper Means to make those Excellencies use∣ful for the Honour and Safety of the Empire They write from  Berlin  of the th  O S  That the true Design of General  Fleming  's Visit to that Court was to insinuate that it will be for the mutual Interest of the King of  Prussia  and King  Augustus  to enter into a new Alli∣ance but that the Ministers of  Prussia  are not inclined to his Sentiments We hear from  Vi∣enna  That his Imperial Majesty has expressed great Satisfaction in their High Mightinesses having communicated to him the whole that has passed in the Affair of a Peace Though there have been Practices used by the Agents of  France  in all the Courts of  Europe  to break the good Understanding of the Allies they have had no other Effect but to make all the Mem∣bers concerned in the Alliance more doubtful of their Safety from the great Offers of the Enemy The Empire is rouzed by this Alarm and the Frontiers of all the  French  Dominions are in Danger of being insulted the ensuing Campagne Advices from all Parts confirm That it is impossible for  France  to find a Way to obtain so much Credit as to gain any one Po∣tentate of the Allies or conceive any Hope for Safety from other Prospects  From my own Apartment  April  I find it of very great Use now I am setting up for a Writer of News that I am an Adept in Astrological Speculations by which Means I avoid speaking of Things which may offend Great Persons But at the same Time I must not prostitute the Liberal Sciences so far as not to utter the Truth in Cases which do not im∣mediately concern the Good of my Native Country I must therefore contradict what has been so assuredly reported by the NewsWriters of  England  That  France  is in the most deplo∣rable Condition and that their People die in great Multitudes I will therefore let the World know that my Correspondent by the Way of  Brussels  informs me upon his Honour That the Gentleman who writes the Gazette of  Paris  and ought to know as well as any Man has told him That ever since the King has been past his d Year or Grand Climacte∣rick there has not died one Man of the  French  Nation who was younger than his Majesty ex∣cept a very few who were taken suddenly near the Village of  Hickstet  in  Germany  and some more who were straitned for Lodging at a Place called  Ramilies  and died on the Road to  Ghent  and  Bruges  There are also other Things given out by the Allies which are Shifts below a Conquering Nation to make use of Among others 'tis said There is a general Murmuring among the People of  France  tho' at the same Time all my Letters agree That there is so good an Understanding among them that there is not one Morsel carried out of any Market in the Kingdom but what is delivered upon Credit  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd April  to  Saturd April    Will's Coffeehouse  April  THis Evening the Comedy call'd  The Coun∣try Wife  was acted in  DruryLane  for the Benefit of Mrs  Bignall  The Part which gives Name to the Play was performed by her self Through the whole Action she made a a very pretty Figure and exactly entered into the Nature of the Part Her Husband in the  Drama  is represented to be one of those De∣bauchees who run through the Vices of the Town and believe when they think fit they can marry and settle at their Ease His own Knowledge of the Iniquity of the Age makes him chuse a Wife wholly ignorant of it and place his Security in her Want of Skill how to abuse him The Poet on many Occasions where the Propriety of the Character will admit of it insinuates That there is no Defence a∣gainst Vice but the Contempt of it And has in the natural Ideas of an untainted Innocent shown the gradual Steps to Ruin and Destruction which Persons of Condition run into without the Help of a good Education how to form their Conduct The Torment of a Jealous Cox∣comb which arises from his own False Ma∣xims and the Aggravation of his Pain by the very Words in which he sees her Innocence makes a very pleasant and instructive Satyr  The Character of  Horner  and the Design of it is a good Representation of the Age in which that Comedy was written at which Time Love and Wenching were the Business of Life and the Gallant Manner of pursuing Women was the best Recommendation at Court To which only it is to be imputed that a Gentle∣man of Mr  Wicherly  's Character and Sense condescends to represent the Insults done to the Honour of the Bed without just Reproof but to have drawn a Man of Probity with Re∣gard to such Considerations had been a Mon∣ster and a Poet had at that Time discovered his Want of knowing the Manners of the Court he lived in by a Virtuous Character in his fine Gentleman as he would show his Ig∣norance by drawing a Vicious one to please the present Audience Mrs  Bignall  did her Part very happily and had a certain Grace in her Rusticity which gave us Hopes of seeing her a very Skilful Player and in some Parts supply our Loss of Mrs  Verbruggen  I cannot be of the same Opinion with my Friends and FellowLabourers the  Reformers of Manners  in their Severity towards Plays but must allow that a good Play acted before a wellbred Au∣dience must raise very proper Incitements to good Behaviour and be the most quick and most prevailing Method of giving Young Peo∣ple a Turn of Sense and Breeding But as I have set up for a Weekly Historian I resolve to be a Faithful One and therefore take this publick Occasion to admonish a Young Noble∣man who came flustered into the Box last Night and let him know how much all his Friends were out of Countenance for him The Women sate in Terror of hearing some∣thing that should shock their Modesty and all  the Gentlemen in as much Pain out of Com∣passion to the Ladies and perhaps Resentment for the Indignity which was offered in coming into their Presence in so disrespectful a Man∣ner Wine made him say nothing that was Rude therefore he is forgiven upon Condition he weill never hazard his offending more in this Kind As I just now hinted I own my self of the Society for  Reformation of Manners  We have lower Instruments than those of the Fa∣mily of  Bickerstaff  for punishing great Crimes and exposing the Abanddoned Therefore as I disign to have Notices from all Publick Assem∣blies I shall take upon me only Indecorums Improprieties and Negligences in such as should give us better Examples After this De∣claration if a Fine Lady thinks fit to giggle at Church or a Great Beau come in drunk to a Play either shall be sure to hear of it in my en∣suing Paper For meerly as a wellbred Man I cannot bear these Enormities  After the Play we naturally stroll to this Coffeehouse in Hopes of meeting some new Poem or other Entertainment among the Men of Wit and Pleasure where there is a Dearth a present But it is wonderful there should be so few Writers when the Art is be∣come meerly Mechanick and Men may make themselves Great that Way by as certain and infallible Rules as you may be a Joiner or a Mason There happens a good Instance of this in what the Hawker just now has offered to Sale to wit  Instructions to Vanderbank A Sequel to the Advice to the Poets A poem oc∣casioned by the Glorious Success of Her Majesty's Arms under the Command of the Duke of  Marl∣borought  the last Tear in  Flanders Here you are to understand that the Author finding the  Poets would not take his Advice he troubles himself no more about 'em but has met with one  Vanderbank  who works in Arras and makes very good Tapestry Hangings There∣fore in order to celebrate the Hero of the Age he claps me together all that can be said of a Man that makes Hangings As  Then Artist who dost Nature's Face express  In Silk and Gold and Scenes of Action dress  Dost figur'd Arras animated leave  Spin a Bright Story or a Passion weave  By mingling Threads canst mingle Shade and Light  Delineate Triumphs or describe a Fight  Well what shall this Work man do Why To show how great an Hero the Poet intends he provides him a very good Horse  Champing his Foam and bounding on the Plain  Arch his High Neck and Graceful spread his Mane  Now as to the Intrepidity the calm Cou∣rage the constant Application of the Hero it is not necessary to take that upon your self you may in the Lump bid him you employ raise him as High as he can and if he does it not let him answer for disobeying Orders  Let Fame and Victory in inferior Sky  Hover with ballanc'd Wings and smiling fly  Above his Head  c  A whole Poem of this Kind may be ready against an ensuing Campagne as well as a Space left in the Canvass of a Piece of Tape∣stry for the principal Figure while the UnderParts are working So that in Effect the Ad∣viser copies after the Man he pretends to direct  This Method should methinks encourage young Beginners For the Invention is so fitted to all Capacities that by the Help of it a Man may make a Receipt for a Poem A young Man may observe that the Gigg of the Thing is as I said finding out all that can be said of his Way you employ to set forth your Worthy  Waller  and  Denham  had worn out the Expe∣dient of  Advice to a Painter  This Author has transferred the Work and sent his  Advice to the Poets  that is to say to the  Turners of Verse  as he calls 'em Well that Thought is worn out also therefore he directs his Genius to the Loom and will have a new Set of Hang∣ings in Honour of the last Year in  Flanders  I must own to you I approve extremely this Invention and it might be improved for the Benefit of Manufactury As suppose an Inge∣nious Gentleman should write a Poem of Ad∣vice to a CallicoPrinter Do you think there is a Girl in  England  that would wear any Thing but  The Taking of Lisle  or  The Battle of Oudenarde  They would certainly be all the Fashion till the Heroes Abroad had cut out some more Parterns I should fancy small Skirmishes might do for UnderPetticoats pro∣vided they had a Siege for the Upper If our Adviser were well imitated many Industrious People might be put to Work Little Mr  Dactile  now in the Room who formerly writ a Song and a Half is a Week gone in a very pretty Work upon this Hint He is writing an Epi∣gram to a young Virgin who knits very well 'tis a Thousand Pities he is a  Jacobite  But his Epigram is by Way of Advice to this Damsel to knit all the Actions of the  Pretender  and the Duke of  Burgundy  last Campagne in the Clock of a Stocking It were endless to enumerate  the many Hands and Trades that may be em∣ployed by Poets of so useful a Turn as this Adviser's I shall think of it and in this Time of Taxes shall consult a great Critick employed in the Customhouse in order to pro∣pose what Tax may be proper to put upon Knives Seals Rings Hangings WroughtBeds Gowns and Petticoats where any of those Commodities bear Motto's or are worked upon Poetical Grounds  St James's Coffeehouse  April  Letters from  Turin  of the d Instant  N S  inform us That his Royal Highness employs all his Address in alarming the Enemy and perplexing their Speculations concerning his real Designs the ensuing Campaign Contracts are entered into with the Merchants of  Milan  for a great Number of Mules to transport his Provisions and Ammunition His Royal High∣ness has ordered the Train of Artillery to be conveyed to  Susa  before the th of the next Month In the mean Time all Accounts a∣gree Thas the Enemy are very backward in their Preparations and almost incapable of de∣fending themselves against an Invasion by rea∣son of the general Murmurs of their own Peo∣ple which they find are no way to be quiet∣ed but by giving them Hopes of a speedy Peace When these Letters were dispatched the Marshal  de Thesse  was arrived at  Genoa  where he has taken much Pains to keep the Correspondents of the Merchants of  France  in Hopes that Measures will be found out to support the Credit and Commerce between that State and  Lyons  But the late Declaration of the Agents of Monsieur  Bernard  that they cannot discharge the Demands made upon  them has quite dispirited all those who are en∣gaged in the Remittances of  France  From my own Apartment  April  It is a very natural Passion in all good Mem∣bers of the Commonwealth to take what Care they can of their Families Therefore I hope the Reader will forgive me that I desire he would go to the Play called the  Stratagem  this Evening which is to be acted for the Benefit of my near Kinsman Mr  John Bicker∣staff  I protest to you the Gentleman has not spoken to me to desire this Favour but I have a Respect for him as well in Regard to Con∣sanguinity as that he is an intimate Friend of that Famous and Heroick Actor Mr  George Powell  who formerly played  Alexander the Great  in all Places though he is lately grown so reserved as to act it only on the Stage  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd April  to  Tuesd April    IT is usual with Persons who mount the Stage for the Cure or Information of the Crowd a∣bout 'em to make solemn Professions of their be∣ing wholly disinterested in the Pains they take for the Publick Good At the same Time those very Men who make Harangues in Plush Dou∣blets and extol their own Abilities and Generous Inclinations tear their Lungs in vending a Drug and show no Act of Bounty except it be that they lower a Demand of a Crown to Six nay to One Penny We have a Contempt for such Paultry Barterers and have therefore all  along informed the Publick that we intend to give them our Advices for our own Sakes and are labouring to make our Lucubrations come to some Price in Money for our more convenient Support in the Service of the Publick It is cer∣tain that many other Schemes have been propo∣sed to me as a Friend offered to show me a Trea∣tise he had writ which he called  The Whole Art of Life  or  The Introduction to Great Men illustrated in a Pack of Cards  But be∣ing a Novice at all Manner of Play I declined the Offer Another advised me for want of Money to set up my Coach and practise Physick but having been bred a Scholar I feared I should not succeed that Way neither therefore resolved to go on in my present Project But you are to understand that I shall not pretend to raise a Credit to this Work upon the Weight of my Po∣litick News only but as my  Latin  Sentence in the Title Page informs you shall take any Thing that offers for the Subject of my Discourse Thus New Persons as well as New Things are to come under my Consideration as when a  Toast  or a  Wit  is first pronounced such You shall have the freshest Advice of their Preferment from me with a Description of the  Beauty  's Manner and the  Wit  's Style as also in whose Places they are advanced For this Town is never goodnatured enough to raise One without depressing Another But it is my Design to avoid saying any Thing of any Person which ought justly to displease but shall endeavour by the Variety of the Matter and Style to give Entertainment for Men of Plea∣sure without Offence to those of Business  White's Chocolatehouse  April  ALL Hearts at present pant for Two La∣dies only who have for some Time en∣grossed the Dominion of the Town They are indeed both exceeding Charming but differ very much in their Excellencies The Beauty of  Clarissa  is Soft that of  Chloe  Piercing When you look at  Clarissa  you see the most exact Harmony of Feature Complexion and Shape you find in  Chloe  nothing extraordinary in any one of those Particulars but the whole Wo∣man irresistible  Clarissa  looks Languishing  Chloe  Killing  Clarissa  never fails of gaining Admiration  Chloe  of moving Desire The Gazers at  Clarissa  are at first unconcerned as if they were observing a fine Picture They who behold  Chloe  at the first Glance discover Transport as if they met their dearest Friend These different Perfections are suitably repre∣sented by the last great Painter  Italy  has sent us Mr  Jervase Clarissa  is by that skilful Hand placed in a Manner that looks artless and innocent of the Torments she gives  Chloe  drawn with a Liveliness that shows she is con∣scious but not affected of her Perfections  Clarissa  is a Shepherdess  Chloe  a Country Girl I must own the Design of  Chloe  's Picture shows to me great Mastery in the Painter for nothing could be better imagined than the Dress he has given her of a StrawHat and Ribband to represent that Sort of Beauty which enters the Heart with a certain Familiarity and cheats it into a Belief that it has received a Lover as well as an Object of Love The Force of their different Beauties is seen also in the Effects it makes on their Lovers The Ad∣mirers of  Chloe  are eternally gay and well∣pleased Those of  Clarissa  melancholy and  thoughtful And as this Passion always changes the natural Man into a quite different Creature from what he was before the Love of  Chloe  makes Coxcombs that of  Clarissa  Madmen There were of each Kind just now in this Room Here was one that whistles laughs sings and cuts Capers for Love of  Chloe  Another has just now writ Three Lines to  Clarissa  then taken a Turn in the Garden then came back again then tore his Fragment then called for some Chocolate then went away without it  Chloe  has so many Admirers in the House at present that there is too much Noise to pro∣ceed in my Narration So that the Progress of the Loves of  Clarissa  and  Chloe  together with the Bottles that are drank each Night for the One and the many Sighs which are uttered and Songs written on the Other must be our Subject on future Occasions  Will's Coffeehouse  April  Letters from the  Haymarket  inform us That on  Saturday  Night last the Opera of  Pyrrhus  and  Demetrius  was performed with great Ap∣plause This Intelligence is not very accepta∣ble to us Friends of the Theatre for the Stage being an Entertainment of the Reason and all our Faculties this Way of being pleased with the Suspence of 'em for Three Hours together and being given up to the shallow Satisfaction of the Eyes and Ears only seems to arise ra∣ther from the Degeneracy of our Understand∣ing than an Improvement of our Diversions That the Understanding has no Part in the Pleasure is evident from what these Letters very positively assert to wit That a great Part of the Performance was done in  Italian  And a great Critick fell into Fits in the Gallery at seeing not only Time and Place but Langua∣ges  and Nations confused in the most incorri∣gible Manner His Spleen is so extremely mo∣ved on this Occasion that he is going to pub∣lish a Treatise against Opera's which he thinks have already inclined us to Thoughts of Peace and if tolerated must infallibly dispirit us from carrying on the War He has communicated his Scheme to the whole Room and declared in what Manner Things of this Kind were first introduced He has upon this Occasion considered the Nature of Sounds in general and made a very elaborate Digression upon the  London Cries  wherein he has shown from Reason and Philosophy why Oysters are cried Cardmatches sung and Turneps and all other Vegetables neither cried sung nor said but sold with an Accent and Tone neither natu∣ral to Man or Beast This Piece seems to be taken from the Model of that excellent Dis∣course of Mrs  Manly  the School Mistress con∣cerning Samplers Advices from the upper End of  Piccadilly  say That  MayFair  is utter∣ly abolished and we hear Mr  Penkethman  has removed his ingenious Company of Strollers to  Greenwich  But other Letters from  Deptford  say the Company is only making thither and not yet settled but that several Heathen Gods and Goddesses which are to descend in Ma∣chines landed at the  KingsHeadStairs  last  Saturday Venus  and  Cupid  went on Foot from thence to  Greenwich Mars  got drunk in the Town and broke his Landlord's Head for which he sate in the Stocks the whole Evening but Mr  Penkethman  giving Security that he should do nothing this ensuing Summer he was set at Liberty The most melancholy Part of all was that  Diana  was taken in the Act of Fornication with a Boatman and commit∣ted  by Justice  Wrathful  which has it seems put a Stop to the Diversions of the Theatre of  BlackHeath  But there goes down another  Diana  and a  Patient Grissel  next Tide from  Billingsgate  St James's Coffeehouse  April  They write from  Saxony  of the th Instant  N S  That the Grand General of the Crown of  Poland  was so far from entring into a Treaty with King  Stanislaus  that he had written Cir∣cular Letters wherein he exhorted the Palati∣nates to join against him declaring that this was the most favourable Conjuncture for assert∣ing their Liberty  Letters from the  Hague  of the d Instant  N S  say they have Advices from  Vienna  which import That his Electoral Highness of  Hannover  had signified to the Imperial Court that he did not intend to put himself at the Head of the Troops of the Empire except more effectual Measures were taken for acting vigorously against the Enemy the ensuing Cam∣paign Upon this Representation the Empe∣ror has given Orders to several Regiments to march towards the  Rhine  and dispatched Ex∣presses to the respective Princes of the Empire to desire an Augmentation of their Forces  These Letters add That an Express arrived at the  Hague  on the th Instant with Advice That the Enemy having made a Detachment from  Tournay  of Horse each Trooper carrying a Foot Soldier behind him in order to surprise the Garrison of  Alost  the Allies upon Notice of their March sent out a strong Body of Troops from  Ghent  which engaged the Ene∣my at  Asche  and took of them Prisoners obliging the rest to retire without making any farther Attempt On the d in the Morning  a Fleet of Merchant Ships coming from  Scot∣land  were attacked by Six  French  Privateers at the Entrance of the  Meuse  We have yet no certain Advice of the Event But Letters from  Rotterdam  say That a  Dutch  Man of War of Forty Guns which was Convoy to the said Fleet was taken as were also Eighteen of the Merchants The  Swiss  Troops in the Service of the States have compleated the Augmenta∣tion of their respective Companies Those of  Wirtemberg  and  Prussia  are expected on the Frontiers within few Days and the Auxiliaries from  Saxony  as also a Battalion of  Holstein  and another of  Wolfembuttle  are advancing thither with all Expedition On the st Instant the Deputies of the States had a Conference near  Woerden  with the President  Rouille  but the Matter which was therein debated is not made publick His Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  and Prince  Eugene  continue at the  Hague  From my own Apartment  April  I have lately been very studious for Intelli∣gence and have just now by my Astrological FlyingPost received a Packet from  Felicia  an Island in  America  with an Account that gives me great Satisfaction and lets me under∣stand that the Island was never in greater Prosperity or the Administration in so good Hands since the Death of their late glorious King These Letters import That the Chief Minister has entered into a firm League with the ablest and best Men of the Nation to carry on the Cause of Liberty to the Encourage∣ment of Religion Virtue and Honour Those Persons at the Helm are so useful and in themselves of such Weight that their strict Alliance must needs tend to the universal Pros∣perity of the People  Camillo  it seems pre∣sides  over the Deliberations of State and is so highly valued by all Men for his singular Pro∣bity Courage Affability and Love of Man∣kind that his being placed in that Station has dissipated the Fears of that People who of all the World are the most jealous of their Liber∣ty and Happiness The next Member of their Society is  Horatio  who makes all the Publick Dispatches This Minister is Master of all the Languages in Use to great Perfection He is held in the highest Veneration imaginable for a severe Honesty and Love of his Country He lives in a Court unsullied with any of its Artifices the Refuge of the Oppressed and Terror of Oppressors  Martio  has joined him∣self to this Council a Man of most undaunt∣ed Resolution and great Knowledge in Mari∣time Affairs famous for destroying the Navy of the  Franks  and singularly happy in one Particular That he never preferred a Man who has not proved remarkably serviceable to his Country  Philander  is mentioned with particu∣lar Distinction a Nobleman who has the most refined Tast of the true Pleasures and Elegance of Life joined to an indefatigable Industry in Business A Man eloquent in As∣semblies agreeable in Conversation and dex∣trous in all Manner of Publick Negotiations These Letters add That  Verono  who is also of this Council has lately set Sail to his Govern∣ment of  Patricia  with Design to confirm the Affections of the People in the Interests of his Queen This Minister is Master of great Abi∣lities and is as industrious and restless for the Preservation of the Liberties of the People as the greatest Enemy can be to subvert them The Influence of these Personages who are Men of such distinguished Parts and Virtues  makes the People enjoy the utmost Tranquility in the Midst of a War and gives them undoubt∣ed Hopes of a secure Peace from their Vigilance and Integrity  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd April  to  Thursd April    White's Chocolatehouse  April  WHO names that lost Thing Love without a Tear  Since so debauch'd by illbred Customs here  To an exact Perfection they have brought  The Action Love the Passion is forgot  This was long ago a witty Author's Lamenta∣tion but the Evil still continues and if a Man of any Delicacy were to attend the Discourses of the young Fellows of this Age they would believe there were none but Prostitutes to make the Objects of Passion So true it is what the Author of the above Verses said a little before his Death of the modern Pretenders to Gal∣lantry  "They set up for Wits in this Age by saying when they are Sober what they of the last spoke only when they were Drunk"  But  Cupid  is not only Blind at present but Dead∣drunk he has lost all his Faculties Else how should  Celia  be so long a Maid with that agreea∣ble Behaviour  Corinna  with that sprightly Wit  Lesbia  with that Heavenly Voice And  Sacharissa  with all those Excellencies in one Person frequent the Park the Play and murder the poor Tits that drag her to publick Places and not a Man turn pale at her Appearance But such is the fallen State of Love that if it were not for honest  Cynthio  who is true to the Cause we should hardly have a Pattern left of the ancient Worthies that Way And indeed he has but very little Encourage∣ment to persevere but he has a Devotion ra∣ther than Love for his Mistress and says  Only tell her that I love  Leave the rest to her and Fate  Some kind Planet from Above  May perhaps her Passion move  Lovers on their Stars must wait  But the Stars I am so intimately acquainted with that I can assure him he will never have her For would you believe it tho'  Cynthio  has Wit Good Sense Fortune and his very Being depends upon her the Termagant for whom he fighs is in Love with a Fellow who stares in the Glass all the Time he is with her and lets her plainly see she may possibly be his Rival but never his Mistress Yet  Cynthio  the same unhappy Man whom I mentioned in my first Narrative pleases himself with a vain Imagina∣tion that with the Language of his Eyes now he has found who she is he shall conquer her though her Eyes are intent upon one who looks from her which is ordinary with the Sex It is certainly a Mistake in the Ancients to draw the little Gentleman  Love  as a blind Boy for his real Character is a little Thief that squints For ask Mrs  Meddle  who is a Confident or Spy upon all the Passions in Town and she'll tell you that the Whole is a Game of Cross Purposes The Lover is generally pursuing one who is in Pursuit of another and running from one that desires to meet him Nay the Nature of this Passion is so justly represented in a squinting little Thief who is always in a Double Action that do but observe  Clarissa  next Time you see her and you'll find when her Eyes have made their soft Tour round the Company she makes no Stay on him they say she is to marry but rests Two Seconds of a Mi∣nute on  Wildair  who neither looks nor thinks on her or any Woman else However  Cynthio  had a Bow from her t'other Day upon which he is very much come to himself and I heard him send his Man of an Errand Yesterday with∣out any Manner of Hesitation a Quarter of an Hour after which he reckoned Twenty re∣member'd he was to sup with a Friend and went exactly to his Appointment I sent to know how he did this Morning and I find he hath not forgot that he spoke to me Yester∣day  Will's Coffeehouse  April  This Week being Sacred to Holy Things and no publick Diversions allowed there has been taken Notice of even here a little Treatise called  A Project for the Advancement of Reli∣gion Dedicated to the Countess of  Berkeley The Title was so uncommon and promised so peculiar a Way of Thinking that every Man here has read it and as many as have done so have approved it It is written with the Spirit of one who has seen the World enough to un∣dervalue it with good Breeding The Author must certainly be a Man of Wisdom as well as Piety and have spent much Time in the Ex∣ercise of both The real Causes of the Decay of the Interest of Religion are set forth in a clear and lively Manner without unseasonable Passions and the whole Air of the Book as to the Language the Sentiments and the Reason∣ings show it was written by one whose Virtue sits easie about him and to whom Vice is throughly contemptible It was said by one of  this Company alluding to that Knowledge of the World the Author seems to have the Man writes much like a Gentleman and goes to Hea∣ven with a very good Mien  St James's Coffeehouse  April  Letters from  Italy  say That the Marquis  de Prie  upon the Receipt of an Express from the Court of  Vienna  went immediately to the Pa∣lace of Cardinal  Paulucci  Minister of State to his Holiness and demanded in the Name of his Imperial Majesty that King  Charles  should be forthwith acknowledged King of  Spain  by a solemn Act of the Congregation of Cardinals appointed for that Purpose He declared at the same Time That if the least Hesitation were made in this most important Article of the late Treaty he should not only be obliged to leave  Rome  himself but also transmit his Master's Orders to the Imperial Troops to face about and return into the Ecclesiastical Dominions When the Cardinal reported this Message to the Pope his Holiness was struck with so sensible an Affliction that he burst into Tears His Sor∣row was aggravated by Letters which imme∣diately after arrived from the Court of  Madrid  wherein his Nuncio acquainted him That upon the News of his Accommodation with the Em∣peror he had received a Message to forbear com∣ing to Court and the People were so highly pro∣voked that they could hardly be restrain'd from insulting his Palace These Letters add That the King of  Denmark  was gone from  Florence  to  Pisa  and from  Pisa  to  Leghorn  where the Go∣vernour paid his Majesty all imaginable Ho∣nours The King designed to go from thence to  Lucca  where a Magnificent Tournament was prepared for his Diversion An  English  Man of War which came from  Port Mahon  to  Leghorn  in Days brought Advice That the Fleet com∣manded by Admiral  Whitaker  was safely ar∣rived at  Barcelona  with the Troops and Ammu∣nition which he had taken in at  Naples  General  Boneval  Governo of  Commacchio  had summoned the Magistrates of all the Towns near that Place to appear before him and take an Oath of Fidelity to his Imperial Majesty commanding also the Gentry to pay him Ho∣mage on Pain of Death and Confiscation of Goods Advices from  Swisserland  inform us That the Bankers of  Geneva  were utterly rui∣ned by the Failure of Mr  Bernard  They add That the Deputies of the  Swiss  Cantons were returned from  Soleure  where they were assem∣bled at the Instance of the  French  Ambassador but were very much dissatisfied with the Re∣ception they had from that Minister 'Tis true he omitted no Civilities or Expressions of Friendship from his Master but he took no Notice of their Pensions and Arrears what further provoked their Indignation was That instead of Pistoles formerly allowed to each Member for their Charge in coming to the Diet he had presented them with only They write from  Dresden  That King  Augustus  was still busie in recruiting his Cavalry and that the  Danish  Troops which lately served in  Hun∣gary  had Orders to be in  Saxony  in the Middle of  May  and that his Majesty of  Denmark  was expected at  Dresden  in the Beginning of that Month King  Augustus  makes great Prepara∣tions for his Reception and has appointed Six∣ty Coaches each drawn by Six Horses for that Purpose The Interview of these Princes af∣fords great Matter for Speculation Letters from  Paris  of the d of this Month say That Mareschal  Harcourt  and the Duke of  Berwick  were preparing to go into  Alsace  and  Dauphiné  but that their Troops were in Want of all Man∣ner of Necessaries The Court of  France  had received Advices from  Madrid  That on the th of this Month the States of  Spain  had with much Magnificence acknowledged the Prince of  Asturias  Presumptive Heir of the Crown This was performed at  Buen Retiro  the Depu∣ties took the Oaths on that Occasion from the Hands of Cardinal  Portocarrero  These Ad∣vices add That it was signified to the Pope's Nuncio by Order of Council to depart from that Court in Hours and that a Guard was accordingly appointed to conduct him to  Bay∣onne  Letters from the  Hague  of the th Instant inform us That Prince  Eugene  was to set out the next Day for  Brussels  to put all Things in a Readiness for opening the Campaign They add That the Grand Pensioner having reported to the Duke of  Marlborough  what passed in the last Conference with Mr  Rouille  his Grace had taken a Resolution immediately to return to  Great Britain  to communicate to Her Majesty all that has been transacted in that important Affair  From my own Apartment  April  The Nature of my Miscellaneous Work is such that I shall always take the Liberty to tell for News such Things let 'em have happened never so much before the Time of Writing as have escaped publick Notice or have been mis∣represented to the World provided that I am still within Rules and trespass not as a Tatler any further than in an Incorrectness of Style and writing in an Air of common Speech Thus if any Thing that is said even of old  Anchises  or  Aeneas  be set by me in a different Light than has  hitherto been hit upon in order to inspire the Love and Admiration of worthy Actions you will Gentle Reader I hope accept of it for In∣telligence you had not before But I am going upon a Narrative the Matter of which I know to be true It is not only doing Justice to the deceas'd Merit of such Persons as had they li∣ved would not have had it in their Power to thank me but also an Instance of the Greatness of Spirit in the lowest of Her Majesty's Subjects Take it as follows  At the Siege of  Namur  by the Allies there were in the Ranks of the Company commanded by Captain  Pincent  in Colonel  Frederick Hamil∣ton  's Regiment one  Unnion  a Corporal and one  Valentine  a private Centinel There happened between these Two Men a Dispute about a Mat∣ter of Love which upon some Aggravations grew to an irreconcileable Hatred  Unnion  be∣ing the Officer of  Valentine  took all Opportuni∣ties even to strike his Rival and profess the Spite and Revenge which moved him to it The Centinel bore it without Resistance but frequent∣ly said He would die to be revenged of that Tyrant They had spent whole Months thus one injuring the other complaining when in the Midst of this Rage towards each other they were commanded upon the Attack of the Ca∣stle where the Corporal received a Shot in the Thigh and fell the  French  pressing on and he expecting to be trampled to Death called out to his Enemy Ah  Valentine  Can you leave me here  Valentine  immediately ran back and in the Midst of a thick Fire of the  French  took the Corporal upon his Back and brought him thro' all that Danger as far as the Abbey of  Salsine  where a CannonBall took off his Head His Bo∣dy fell under his Enemy whom he was carrying  off  Unnion  immediately forgot his Wound rose up tearing his Hair and then threw himself up∣on the bleeding Carcass crying Ah  Valentine  Was it for me who have so barbarously used thee that thou hast died I will not live after thee He was not by any Means to be forced from the Body but was removed with it bleed∣ing in his Arms and attended with Tears by all their Comrades who knew their Enmity When he was brought to a Tent his Wounds were dressed by Force but the next Day still calling upon  Valentine  and lamenting his Cruel∣ties to him he died in the Pangs of Remorse and Despair  It may be a Question among Men of Noble Sentiments Whether of these unfortunate Per∣sons had the greater Soul he that was so gene∣rous as to venture his Life for his Enemy or he who could not survive the Man that died in lay∣ing upon him such an Obligation  When we see Spirits like these in a People to what Heights may we not suppose their Glory may arise but as it is excellently ob∣served by  Sallust  it is not only to the general Bent of a Nation that great Revolutions are owing but to the extraordinary Genio's that lead 'em On which Occasion he proceeds to say That the  Roman  Greatness was neither to be attributed to their superior Poli y for in that the  Carthaginians  excelled nor to their Valour for in that the  French  were preferable but to particular Men who were born for the Good of their Country and formed for great Attempts This he says to introduce the Characters of  Caesar  and  Cato  It would be entring into too weighty a Discourse for this Place if I attempted to show that our Na∣tion has produced as great and able Men for  publick Affairs as any other But I believe the Reader outruns me and fixes his Imagination upon the Duke of  Marlborough  It is me∣thinks a pleasing Reflection to consider the Dispensations of Providence in the Fortune of this Illustrious Man who in the Space of Forty Years has passed through all the Grada∣tions of Humane Life till he has ascended to the Character of a Prince and become the Scourge of a Tyrant who sate in one of the greatest Thrones of  Europe  before the Man who was to have the greatest Part in his Downfal had made one Step in the World But such Elevations are the Natural Conse∣quences of an exact Prudence a calm Courage a well governed Temper a patient Ambition and an affable Behaviour These Arts as they are the Steps to his Greatness so they are the Pillars of it now it is raised To this her Glo∣rious Son  Great Britain  is indebted for the hap∣py Conduct of her Arms in whom she can boast She has produced a Man formed by Na∣ture to lead a Nation of Heroes  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd April  to  Saturd April    Will's Coffeehouse  April  I AM just come from visiting  Sappho  a fine Lady who writes Verses sings dances and can say and do whatever she pleases without the Imputation of any Thing that can injure her Character for she is so well known to have no Passion but SelfLove or Folly but Affectation that now upon any Occasion they only cry  'Tis her Way  and  That's so like her  without further Reflection As I came into the Room she cries Oh Mr  Bickerstaff  I am utterly undone I have broke that pretty  Italian  Fan I showed you when you were here last wherein were so admirably drawn our First Parents in  Paradise  asleep in each other's Arms But there is such an Affinity between Painting and Poetry that I have been impro∣ving the Images which were raised by that Picture by reading the same Representation in Two of our greatest Poets Look you here are the Passages in  Milton  and in  Dryden  All  Milton  's Thoughts are wonderfully just and na∣tural in this inimitable Description which  Adam  makes of himself in the Eighth Book of  Paradise Lost  But there is none of them finer than that contained in the following Lines where he tells us his Thoughts when he was falling asleep a little after his Creation  While thus I call'd and stray'd I know not whi∣ther  From whence I first drew Air and first beheld  This happy Light when Answer none return'd  On a green shady Bank profuse of Flowers  Pensive I sate me down there gentle Sleep  First found me and with soft Oppression seiz'd  My drowned Sense untroubled though I thought  I then was passing to my former State  Insensible and forthwith to dissolve  But now I can't forgive this odious Thing This  Dryden  who in his  State of Innocence  has given my GreatGrandmother  Eve  the same Apprehension of Annihilation on a very diffe∣rent Occasion As  Adam  pronounces it of himself when he was seized with a pleasing Kind of Stupor and Deadness  Eve  fancies her∣self  falling away and dissolving in the Hurry of a Rapture However the Verses are very good and I don't know but it may be natural what she says I'll read 'em  When your kind Eyes look'd languishing on mine  And wreathing Arms did soft Embraces join  A doubtful Trembling seiz'd me first all o'er  Then Wishes and a Warmth unknown before  What follow'd was all Extasie and Trance  Immortal Pleasures round my swimming Eyes did dance  And speechless Joys in whose sweet Tumults tost  I thought my Breath and my New Being lost  She went on and said a Thousand good Things at Random but so strangely mixed that you would be apt to say All her Wit is meer good Luck and not the Effect of Reason and Judgment When I made my Escape hi∣ther I found a Gentleman playing the Critick on Two other great Poets even  Virgil  and  Ho∣mer  He was observing that  Virgil  is more judicious than the other in the Epithets he gives his Hero  Homer  's usual Epithet said he is  or  and his Indiscre∣tion has been often rallied by the Criticks for mentioning the Nimbleness of Foot in  Achilles  though he describes him standing sitting lying down fighting eating drinking or in any other Circumstance however foreign or repugnant to Speed and Activity  Virgil  's common Epi∣thet to  Aeneas  is  Pius  or  Pater  I have there∣fore considered said he what Passage there is in any of his Hero's Actions where either of these Appellations would have been most im∣proper to see if I could catch him at the same Fault with  Homer  And this I think is his Meeting with  Dido  in the Cave where  Pius  Aeneas  would have been Absurd and  Pater Aeneas  a Burlesque The Poet has therefore wisely dropped 'em both for  Dux Trojanus  Speluncam Dido Dux Trojanus candem  Deveniunt  Which he has repeated twice in  Juno  's Speech and his own Narration For he very well knew a loose Action might be consistent enough with the usual Manners of a Soldier tho' it became neither the Chastity of a Pious Man nor the Gravity of the Father of a People  Grecian Coffeehouse  April  While other Parts of the Town are amused with the present Actions we generally spend the Evening at this Table in Enquiries into An∣tiquity and think any Thing News which gives us new Knowledge Thus we are ma∣king a very pleasant Entertainment to our selves in putting the Actions of  Homer  's  Iliad  into an exact Journal  This Poem is introduced by  Chryses  King of  Chryseis  and Priest of  Apollo  who comes to re∣demand his Daughter who was carried off at the Taking of that City and given to  Aga∣memnon  for his Part of the Booty The Refu∣sal he received enrages  Apollo  who for Nine Days showered down Darts upon them which occasioned the Pestilence  The th Day  Achilles  assembles the Coun∣cil and encourages  Calchas  to speak for the Surrender of  Chryseis  to appease  Apollo Aga∣memnon  and  Achilles  storm at one another notwithstanding which  Agamemnon  will not release his Prisoner unless he has  Briseis  in her Stead After long Contestations wherein  Aga∣memnon  gives a glorious Character of  Achil∣les  's Valour he determines to restore  Briseis  to  her Father and sends Two Heralds to fetch away  Chryseis  from  Achilles  who abandons him∣self to Sorrow and Despair His Mother  Thetis  came to comfort him under his Affliction and promises to represent his sorrowful Lamenta∣tions to  Jupiter  But he could not attend it for the Evening before he had appointed to divert himself for Two Days beyond the Seas with the harmless  Aethiopians  'Twas the st Day after  Chryseis  's Arrival to the Camp that  Thetis  went very early to demand an Audience of  Jupiter  The Means he uses to satisfie her were to perswade the  Greeks  to attack the  Trojans  that so they might perceive the Consequence of contemning  Achil∣les  and the Miseries they suffer if he does not head them The next Night he orders  Aga∣memnon  in a Dream to attack them who was deceived with the Hopes of obtaining a Victo∣ry and also taking the City without sharing the Honour with  Achilles  On the d in the Morning he assembles the Council and having made a Feint of raising the Siege and retiring he declares to them his Dream and together with  Nestor  and  Ulysses  resolves on an Engagement  This was the d Day which is full of Inci∣dents and which continues from almost the Beginning of the Second Canto to the Eighth The Armies being then drawn up in View of one another  Hector  brings it about that  Mene∣laus  and  Paris  the Two Persons concerned in the Quarrel should decide it by a single Com∣bat which tending to the Advantage of  Mene∣laus  was interrupted by a Cowardice infused by  Minerva  Then both Armies engage where the  Trojans  have the Disadvantage but being afterwards animated by  Apollo  they repulse  the Enemy yet they are once again forced to give Ground but their Affairs were retrieved by  Hector  who has a single Combat with  Ajax  The Gods threw themselves into the Battle Juno and  Minerva  took the  Gracians  Part and  Apollo  and  Mars  the  Trojans  But  Mars  and  Ve∣nus  are both wounded by  Diomedes  The Truce for burying the Slain ended the d Day after which the  Greeks  threw up a great Intrenchment to secure their Navy from Danger Councils are held on both Sides On the Morning of the th Day the Battle is re∣newed but in a very disadvantagious Manner to the  Greeks  who were beaten back to their Retrenchments  Agamemnon  being in Despair at this ill Success proposes to the Counsel to quit the Enterprize and retire from  Troy  But by the Advice of  Nestor  he is perswaded to re∣gain  Achilles  by returning  Chryseis  and sending him considerable Presents Hereupon  Ulysses  and  Ajax  are sent to that Hero who conti∣nues inflexible in his Anger  Ulysses  at his Return joins himself with  Diomedes  and goes in the Night to gain Intelligence of the Ene∣my They enter into their very Camp where finding the Centinels asleep they made a great Slaughter  Rhesus  who was just then arrived with Recruits from  Thrace  for the  Trojans  was killed in that Action Here ends the th Can∣to The Sequel of this Journal will be inserted in the next Article from this Place  St James's Coffeehouse  April  We hear from  Italy  That notwithstanding the Pope has received a Letter from the Duke of  Anjou  demanding of him to explain himself upon the Affair of acknowledging King  Charles  his Holiness has not yet thought fit to send any Answer to that Prince The Court of  Rome  appears very much mortified that they are not to see his Majesty of  Denmark  in that City ha∣ving perhaps given themselves vain Hopes from a Visit made by a Protestant Prince to that See The Pope has dispatched a Gentleman to com∣pliment his Majesty and sent the King a Pre∣sent of all the Curiosities and Antiquities of  Rome  represented in Seventeen Volumes very richly bound which were taken out of the  Vatican  Library Letters from  Genoa  of the th Instant say A  Felucca  was arrived there in Five Days from  Marseilles  with an Account That the People of that City had made an In∣surrection by reason of the Scarcity of Provi∣sions and that the Intendant had ordered some Companies of Marines and the Men belonging to the Gallies to stand to their Arms to pro∣tect him from Violence but that he began to be in as much Apprehension of his Guards as those from whom they were to defend him When that Vessel came away the Soldiers murmured publickly for Want of Pay and it was generally believed they would pillage the Magazines as the Garrisons of  Grenoble  and other Towns of  France  had already done A Vessel which lately came into  Leghorn  brought Advice That the  British  Squadron was arrived at  Port Mahon  where they were taking in more Troops in order to attempt the Relief of  Alicant  which still made a very vigorous Defence 'Tis said Admiral  Bing  will be at the Head of that Expedition The King of  Denmark  was gone from  Leghorn  towards  Lucca  They write from  Vienna  That in case the Allies should enter into a Treaty of Peace with  France  Count  Zinzendorf  will be appointed First Plenipotentiary the Count  de Goes  the Se∣cond  and Monsieur  Van Konsbruch  a Third MajorGeneral  Palmes  Envoy Extraordinary from Her  Britannick  Majesty has been very ur∣gent with that Court to make their utmost Ef∣forts against  France  the ensuing Campaign in order to oblige it to such a Peace as may establish the Tranquility of  Europe  for the fu∣ture  We are also informed That the Pope uses all imaginable Shifts to elude the Treaty con∣cluded with the Emperor and that he demand∣ed the immediate Restitution of  Commacchio  insisting also That his Imperial Majesty should ask Pardon and desire Absolution for what has formerly passed before he would solemnly ac∣knowledge King  Charles  But this was utterly refused  They hear at  Vienna  by Letters from  Con∣stantinople  dated the d of  February  last That on the th of that Month the Grand Signior took Occasion at the Celebration of the Festi∣vals of the  Musselmen  to set all the Christian Slaves which were in the Galleys at Liberty  Advices from  Swisserland  import That the Preachers of the County of  Tockenburg  conti∣nue to create new Jealousies of the Protestants and some Disturbances lately happened there on that Account The Protestants and Papists in the Town of  Hamman  go to Divine Service one after another in the same Church as is usual in many other Parts of  Swisserland  but on  Sunday  the th Instant the Popish Curate having ended his Service attempted to hinder the Protestants from entring into the Church according to Custom but the Protestants brisk∣ly attacked him and his Party and broke into it by Force  Last Night between Seven and Eight his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  arrived at Court  From my own Apartment  April  The present great Captains of the Age the Duke of  Marlborough  and Prince  Eugene  ha∣ving been the Subject of the Discourse of the last Company I was in it has naturally led me into a Consideration of  Alexander  and  Caesar  the Two greatest Names which ever appeared before this Century In order to enter into their Characters there needs no more but exa∣mining their Behaviour in Parallel Circum∣stances It must be allowed That they had an equal Greatness of Soul but  Caesar  's was more corrected and allayed by a Mixture of Prudence and Circumspection This is seen conspicuously in one Particular in their Histo∣ries wherein they seem to have shown exactly the Difference of their Tempers When  Alex∣ander  after a long Course of Victories would still have led his Soldiers farther from Home they unanimously refused to follow him We meet with the like Behaviour in  Caesar  's Army in the Midst of his March against  Ariovistus  Let us therefore observe the Conduct of our Two Generals in so nice an Affair And here we find  Alexander  at the Head of his Army upbraiding them with their Cowardice and Meanness of Spirit and in the End telling them plainly He would go forward himself though not a Man followed him This show∣ed indeed an excessive Bravery but how would the Commander have come off if the Speech had not succeeded and the Soldiers had taken him at his Word The Project seems of a Piece with Mr  Bays  's in the  Rehearsal  who to gain a Clap in his Prologue comes out with a ter∣rible Fellow in a FurCap following him and  tells his Audience If they would not like his Play he would lie down and have his Head struck off If this gained a Clap all was well but if not there was nothing left but for the Executioner to do his Office But  Caesar  would not leave the Success of his Speech to such un∣certain Events He shews his Men the Unrea∣sonableness of their Fears in an obliging Man∣ner and concludes That if none else would march along with them he would go himself with the Tenth Legion for he was assured of their Fidelity and Valour though all the rest forsook him not but that in all Probability they were as much against the March as the rest The Result of all was very natural The Tenth Legion fired with the Praises of their Ge∣neral send Thanks to him for the just Opinion he entertains of 'em and the rest ashamed to be outdone assure him That they are as rea∣dy to follow where he pleases to lead them as any other Part of the Army  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd April  to  Tuesd April    IT is so just an Observation That  Mocking is Catching  that I am become an unhappy In∣stance of it and am in the same Manner that I have represented Mr  Partridge  my self a dying Man in Comparison of the Vigour with which I first set out in the World Had it been otherwise you may be sure I would not have pretended to have given for News as I did last  Saturday  a Diary of the Siege of  Troy  But Man is a Crea∣ture very inconsistent with himself The Greatest  Heroes are sometimes Fearful the Spriteliest Wits at some Hours Dull and the Greatest Poli∣ticians on some Occasions  Whimsical  But I shall not pretend to palliate or excuse the Matter for I find by a Calculation of my own Nativity that I cannot hold out with any tolerable Wit longer than Two Minutes after Twelve a Clock at Night between the th and th of the next Month For which Space of Time you may still expect to hear from me but no longer except you will transmit to me the Occurrences you meet with relating to your Amours or any other Subject within the Rules by which I have proposed to walk If any Gentle∣man or Lady sends to  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  at Mr  Morphew  's near  StationersHall  by the PennyPost the Grief or Joy of their Soul what they think fit of the Matter shall be related in Colours as much to their Advantage as those in which  Gervase  has drawn the Agreeable  Chloe  But since without such Assistance I frankly con∣fess and am sensible that I have not a Month's Wit more I think I ought while I am in my sound Health and Senses to make my Will and Testament which I do in Manner and Form fol∣lowing  Imprimis  I give to the Stockjobbers about the Exchange of  London  as a Security for the Trusts daily reposed in them all my Real Estate which I do hereby vest in the said Body of worthy Citi∣zens for ever  Item  For as much as it is very hard to keep Land in Repair without ready Cash I do out of my Personal Estate bestow the Bearskin which I have frequently lent to several Societies about this Town to supply their Necessities I say I give also the said Bearskin as an immediate Fund to the said Citizens for ever  Item  I do hereby appoint a certain Number of  the said Citizens to take all the Customhouse or Customary Oaths concerning all Goods Imported by the whole City strictly directing That some se∣lect Members and not the whole Number of a Bo∣dy Corporate should be perjured  Item  I forbid all Ns and Persons of Qty to watch Bargains near and about the Exchange to the Diminution and Wrong of the said Stock∣jobbers  Thus far in as brief and intelligible a Manner as any Will can appear till it is explained by the Learned I have disposed of my Real and Personal Estate But as I am an Adept I have by Birth an equal Right to give also an indefea∣sible Title to my Endowments and Qualifications which I do in the following Manner  Item  I give my Chastity to all Virgins who have withstood their Market  Item  I give my Courage among all who are ashamed of their distressed Friends all Sneakers in Assemblies and Men who show Valour in Com∣mon Conversation  Item  I give my Wit as Rich Men give to the Rich among such as think they have enough already And in case they shall not accept of the Legacy I give it to  Bentivolio  to defend his Works from Time to Time as he shall think fit to publish 'em  Item  I bestow my Learning upon the Honourary Members of the Royal Society  Now for the Disposal of this Body  As these Eyes must one Day cease to gaze on  Teraminta  and this Heart shall one Day pant no more for her Indignation That is to say since this Body must be Earth I shall commit it to the Dust in a Manner suitable to my Character Therefore as there are those who dispute Whether there is any such Real Person as  Isaac Bickerstaff  or not I shall excuse all Persons who appear what they really are from coming to my Funeral But all those who are in their Way of Life  Personae  as the  Latins  have it Persons assumed and who appear what they really are not are hereby invited to that Solemnity  The Body shall be carried by Six Watchmen who are never seen in the Day  Item  The Pall shall be held up by the Six most known Pretenders to Honesty Wealth and Power who are not possessed of any of them The Two First an Half Lawyer a Compleat Justice The Two next a Chymist a Projector The Third Couple a Treasury Solicitor and a small Courtier  To make my Funeral what that Solemnity when done to common Men really is in it self a very Farce and since all Mourners are meer Actors on these Occasions I shall desire those who are profes∣sedly such to attend me I humbly therefore beseech Mrs  Barry  to act once more and be my WidowWhen she swoons away at the ChurchPorch I ap∣point the Merry Sir  John Falstaff  and the Gay Sir  Harry Wildair  to support her I desire Mr  Penkethman  to follow in the Habit of a Cardi∣nal and Mr  Bullock  in that of a PrivyCouncel∣lor To make up the rest of the Appearance I desire all the Ladies from the Balconies to weep with Mrs  Barry  as they hope to be Wives and Widows themselves I invite all who have no∣thing else to do to accept of Gloves and Scarves  Thus with the Great  Charles V  of  Spain  I resign the Glories of this Transitory World Yet at the same Time to show you my Indifference and that my Desires are not too much fixed upon any Thing I own to you I am as willing to stay as go Therefore leave it in the Choice of my Gen∣tle Readers whether I shall hear from them or they hear no more from me  White's Chocolatehouse  April  EAster  Day being a Time when you cannot well meet with any but humble Adven∣tures and there being such a Thing as low Gallantry as well as low Comedy Colonel  Ramble  and my self went early this Morning into the Fields which were strewed with Shep∣herds and Shepherdesses but indeed of a diffe∣rent Turn from the Simplicity of those of  Ar∣cadia  Every Hedge was conscious of more than what the Representations of enamoured Swains admit of While we were surveying the Crowd around us we saw at a Distance a Com∣pany coming towards  Pancras  Church but tho' there was not much Disorder we thought we saw the Figure of a Man stuck through with a Sword and at every Step ready to fall if a Woman by his Side had not supported him the rest followed Two and Two When we came nearer this Appearance who should it be but Monsieur  Guardeloop  mine and  Ramble  's  French  Taylor attended by others leading one of Madam  Depingle  's Maids to the Church in order to their Espousals It was his Sword rucked so high above his Wast and the Cir∣cumflex which Persons of his Profession take in their Walking that made him appear at a Distance wounded and falling But the Morning being rainy methought the March to thi  Wedding was but too lively a Picture of Wed¦lock it self They seemed both to have  Month's Mind to make the best of their Wa  single yet both tugged Arm in Arm an  when they were in a dirty Way he was bu  deeper in the Mire by endeavouring to pu  out his Companion and yet without helpin  her The Bridegroom's Feathers in his Hat  drooped one of his Shoes had lost an He  In short he was in his whole Person and Dress so extremely soused that there did not appear one Inch or single Thread about him unmar∣ried Pardon me that the melancholy Object still dwells upon me so far as to reduce me to Punning However we attended to the Chap∣pel where we stay'd to hear the irrevocable Words pronounced upon our old Servant and made the best of our Way to Town I took a Resolution to forbear all married Persons or any in Danger of being such for Four and twenty Hours at least therefore dressed and went to visit  Florimell  the vainest Thing in Town where I knew would drop in Colonel  Picket  just come from the Camp her professed Admirer He is of that Order of Men who has much Honour and Merit but withal a Cox∣comb the other of that Set of Females who has Innocence and Wit but the First of Co∣quets It is easy to believe These must be Admirers of each other She says The Colo∣nel rides the best of any Man in  England  The Colonel says She talks the best of any Wo∣man At the same Time he understands Wit just as she does Horsemanship You are to know these extraordinary Persons see each other dai∣ly and they themselves as well as the Town think it will be a Match But it can never happen that they can come to the Point for instead of addressing to each other they spend their whole Time in Reports of themselves He is satisfied if he can convince her he is a fine Gentleman and a Man of Consequence and she in appearing to him an accomplished Lady and a Wit without further Design Thus he tells her of his Manner of posting his Men at such a Pass with the Numbers he com∣manded on that Detachment She tells him  how she was dressed on such a Day at Court and what Offers were made her the Week following She seems to hear the Repetition of his Men's Names with Admiration and waits only to answer him with as false a Mu∣ster of Lovers They talk to each other not to be informed but approved Thus they are so like that they are to be ever distant and the Parallel Lines may run together for ever but never meet  Will's Coffeehouse  April  This Evening the Comedy called  EpsomWells  was acted for the Benefit of Mr  Bullock  who though he is a Person of much Wit and Ingenuity has a peculiar Talent of looking like a Fool and therefore excellently well qua∣lified for the Part of  Bisket  in this Play I cannot indeed sufficiently admire his Way of bearing a Beating as he does in this Drama and that with such a Natural Air and Proprie∣ty of Folly that one cannot help wishing the Whip in one's own Hand so richly does he seem to deserve his Chastisement Skilful Actors think it a very peculiar Happiness to play in a Scene with such as Top their Parts Therefore I cannot but say when the Judgment of any good Author directs him to write a Beating for Mr  Bullock  from Mr  William Pen∣kethman  or for Mr  William Penkethman  from Mr  Bullock  those excellent Players seem to be in their most shining Circumstances and please me more but with a different Sort of Delight than that which I receive from those Grave Scenes of  Brutus  and  Cassius  or  Anthony  and  Ventidius  The whole Comedy is very just and the Low Part of Humane Life represented with much Humour and Wit  St James's Coffeehouse  April  We are advised from  Vienna  by Letters of the th Instant That the Emperor hath lately added new Members to his Council of State but they have not yet taken their Places at the Board General  Thaun  is returned from  Baden  his Health being so well reestablished by the Baths of that Place that he designs to set out next Week for  Turin  to his Command of the Imperial Troops in the Service of the Duke of  Savoy  His Imperial Majesty has advanced his Brother Count  Henry Thaun  to be a Brigadier and a Councellor of the Aulick Council of War These Letters import That King  Sta∣nislaus  and the  Swedish  General  Crassau  are di∣recting their

vigorously in  Hungary  where all Things as yet are in perfect Tranqui∣lity And that General  Thungen  has been very importunate for a speedy Reinforcement of the Forces on the  Upper Rhine

th Instant say That on the preceding  Sunday  his Holiness was carried in an open Chair from St  Peter  's to St  Mary  's attended by the Sacred College in Cavalcade and after Mass distributed several Dowries for the Marriage of poor and distres∣sed Virgins The Proceedings of that Court are very dilatory concerning the Recognition of King  Charles  notwithstanding the pressing In∣stances of the Marquis  de Prie  who has decla∣red That if this Affair be not wholly concluded  by the th Instant he will retire from that Court and order the Imperial Troops to return into the Ecclefiastical State On the other Hand the Duke of  Anjou  's Minister has in the Name of his Master demanded of his Holiness to ex∣plain himself on that Affair which 'tis said will be finally determined in a Consistory to be held on  Monday  next the Duke  d'Uzeda  de∣figning to delay his Departure till he sees the Issue These Letters also say That the Court was mightily alarmed at the News which they received by an Express from  Ferrara  that Ge∣neral  Boneval  who commands in  Commachio  had sent Circular Letters to the Inhabitants of St  Alberto Longastrino Fillo  and other adja∣cent Parts enjoining them to come and swear Fealty to the Emperor and receive new Inve∣stitures of their Fiefs from his Hands Letters from other Parts of  Italy  say That the King of  Denmark  continues at  Lucca  that four  English  and  Dutch  Men of War were seen off of  Oneglia  bound for  Final  in order to transport the Troops designed for  Barcelona  and that Her Majesty's Ship the  Colchester  arriv'd at  Leghorn  the th In∣stant from  Port Mahon  with Advice That MajorGeneral  Stanhope  designed to part from thence the st Instant with or Men to attempt the Relief of the Castle of  Alicant  Our last Advices from  Berlin  bearing Date the th Instant import That the King was gone to  Linum  and the Queen to  Meckleuburg  but that their Majesties designed to return the next Week to  Oranienburg  where a great Chase of WildBeasts was prepared for their Diversion and from thence they intend to proceed toge∣ther to  Potsdam  That the Prince Royal was set out for  Brahant  but intended to make some short Stay at  Hanever  These Letters also in∣form us That they are advised from  Obory  that the King of  Sweden  being on his March towards  Holki  met General  Reune  with a Do∣tachment of  Muscovites  who placing some Re∣giments in Ambuscade attacked the  Swedes  in their Rear and putting them to Flight killed Men the King himself having his Horse shot under him  We hear from  Copenhagen  That the Ice being broke the  Sound  is again open for the Ships and that they hoped his Majesty would return sooner than they at first expected  Letters from the  Hague  dated  May

Bo∣dy of Men was on his March to attack  Gironne  The Duke of  Anjou  has deposed the Bishop of  Lerida  as being a Favourer of the Interest of King  Charles  and has summoned a Convocation at  Madrid  composed of the Arch∣bishops  Bishops and States of that Kingdom wherein he hopes they will come to a Resolu∣tion to send for no more Bulls to  Rome  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd Apr  to  Thursd Apr    Will's Coffeehouse  April  THE Play of  The London Cuckolds  was acted this Evening before a suitable Audience who were extremely well diverted with that Heap of Vice and Absurdity The Indignation which  Eugenio  who is a Gentleman of a just Tast has upon Occasion of seeing humane Na∣ture fall so low in their Delights made him I thought expatiate upon the Mention of this Play very agreeably Of all Men living said he I pity Players who must be Men of good Un∣derstanding to be capable of being such that they are obliged to repeat and assume proper Gestures for representing Things of which their Reason must be ashamed and which they must disdain their Audience for approving The A∣mendment of these low Gratifications is only to be made by People of Condition by encoura∣ging the Presentation of the Noble Characters drawn by  Shakespeare  and others from whence it is impossible to return without strong Impres∣sions of Honour and Humanity On these Oc∣casions Distress is laid before us with all its Causes and Consequences and our Resentment placed according to the Merit of the Persons af∣flicted Were  Drama  's of this Nature more ac∣ceptable to the Tast of the Town Men who have Genius would bend their Studies to excel in 'em How forcible an Effect this would have on our Minds one needs no more than to observe  how strongly we are touched by meer Pictures Who can see  Le Brun  's Picture of the Battle of  Porus  without entring into the Character of that fierce gallant Man and being accordingly spurred to an Emulation of his Constancy and Courage When he is falling with his Wound the Fea∣tures are at the same Time very terrible and languishing and there is such a stern Faintness diffused through all his Look as is apt to move a kind of Horrour as well as Pity in the Be∣holder This I say is an Effect wrought by meer Lights and Shades consider also a Repre∣sentation made by Words only as in an Account given by a good Writer  Catiline  in  Sallust  makes just such a Figure as  Porus  by  Le Brun  It is said of him Catilina  vero longe a suis inter Hostium Cadavera repertus est paululum etiam spirans Ferocitatemque Animi quam vivus habue∣rat in Vultu retinens  '  Catiline  was found kill'd far from his own Men among the dead Bo∣dies of the Enemy He seemed still to breath and still retained in his Face the same Fierce∣ness he had when he was living"  You have in that one Sentence a lively Impression of his whole Life and Actions What I would insi∣nuate from all this is That if the Painter and the Historian can do thus much in Colours and Language what may not be performed by an excellent Poet When the Character he draws is represented by the Person the Manner the Look and the Motion of an accomplished Play∣er If a Thing painted or related can irresisti∣bly enter our Hearts what may not be brought to pass by seeing generous Things performed be∣fore our Eyes  Eugenio  ended his Discourse by recommending the apt Use of a Theatre as the most agreeable and easie Method of making a polite and moral Gentry which would end in rendring the rest of the People regular in their  Behaviour and ambitious of laudable Under∣takings  St James's Coffeehouse  April  Letters f om  Naples  of the th Instant  N S  advise That Cardinal  Grimani  had ordered the Regiment commanded by General  Pate  to march towards  Final  in order to

Matters relating to the Treaty of a Peace upon which he declared that he thought it ne∣cessary to hasten to his own Dominions  Letters from  Swisserland  inform us That the Effects of the great Scarcity of Corn in  France  we e felt at  Geneva  the Magistrates of which City had appointed Deputies to treat with the Cantons of  Bern  and  Zurich  for Leave to buy up such Quantities of Grain within their Terri∣tories as should be thought necessary The Pro∣testants of  Tockenburg  are still in Arms about the Convent of St  John  and have declared That they will not lay them down till they shall have sufficient Security from the  Roman  Catho∣licks of living unmolested in the Exercise of their Religion In the mean Time the Deputies of  Bern  and  Tockenburg  have frequent Confe∣rences at  Zurich  with the Regency of that Can∣ton to find out Methods for the quieting these Disorders  Letters from the  Hague  of the d of  May  ad∣vise That the Prendent  Rouille  after his last Conference with the Deputies of the States had retired to  Bodegrave  five Miles distant from  Worden  and expected the Return of a Courier from  France  on the th with new Instructions It is said if his Answer from the  French  Court shall not prove Satisfactory he will be desired to withdraw out of these Parts In the mean Time it is also reported That his Equipage as an Ambassador on this great Occasion is actual∣ly on the March towards him They write from  Flanders  That the great Convoy of Pro∣visions which set out from  Ghent  is safely ar∣rived at  Lisle  Those Advices add That the Enemy had assembled near  Tournay  a considera∣ble Body of Troops drawn out of the Neigh∣bouring Garrisons Their High Mightinesses ha∣ving sent Orders to their Ministers at  Hamburgh  and  Dantzick  to engage the Magistrates of those Cities to forbid the Sale of Corn to the  French  and to signify to them That the  Dutch  Merchants will buy up as much of that Com∣modity as they can spare The  Hamburghers  have accordingly contracted with the  Dutch  and refused any Commerce with the  French  on that Occasion  From my own Apartment  After the Lassitude of a Day spent in the strolling Manner which is usual with Men of Pleasure in this Town and with a Head full of a Million of Impertinencies which had danced round it for Ten Hours together I came to my Lodging and hastened to Bed My Valet de Chambre knows my University Trick of read∣ing there and he being a good Scholar for a Gentleman ran over the Names of  Horace Ti∣bullus Ovid  and others to know which I would have Bring  Virgil  said I and if I fall asleep take Care of the Candle I read the Sixth Book over with the most exquisite De∣light and had gone half through it a second Time when the pleasing Idea's of  Elysian  Fields  deceased Worthies walking in them sincere Lo∣vers enjoying their Languishment without Pain Compassion for the unhappy Spirits who had mispent their short Daylight and were exiled from the Seats of Bliss for ever I say I was deep again in my Reading when this Mixture of Images had taken Place of all others in my Imagination before and lulled me into a Dream from which I am just awake to my great Dis∣advantage The happy Mansions of  Elysium  by Degrees seemed to be wafted from me and the very Traces of my late walking Thoughts began to fade away when I was cast by a sudden Whirlwind upon an Island encompassed with a roaring and troubled Sea which shak'd its very Centre and rocked its Inhabitants as in a Cradle The Islanders lay on their Faces with∣out offering to look up or hope for Preserva∣tion all her Harbours were crowded with Mariners and tall Vessels of War lay in Dan∣ger of being driven to Pieces on her Shores Bless me said I why have I lived in such a Manner that the Convulsion of Nature should be so terrible to me when I feel in my self that the better Part of me is to survive it Oh may that be in Happiness A sudden Shriek in which the whole People on their Faces join∣ed interrupted my Soliloquy and turned my Eyes and Attention to the Object which had given us that sudden Start in the Midst of an inconsolable and speechless Affliction Imme∣diately the Winds grew calm the Waves subsided and the People stood up turning their Faces upon a magnificent Pile in the Midst of the Island There we beheld an Hero of a comely and erect Aspect but pale and languid sitting under a Canopy of State By the Faces and dumb Sorrow of those who attended we thought him in the Article of Death At a Distance sate a Lady whose Life seemed to  hang upon the same Thread with his She kept her Eyes fixed upon him and seemed to smother Ten Thousand Thousand nameless Things which urged her Tenderness to clasp him in her Arms But her Greatness of Spirit overcame those Sentiments and gave her Power to forbear disturbing his last Moment which immediately approached The Hero looked up with an Air of Negligence and Satiety of Be∣ing rather than of Pain to leave it and leaning back his Head expired  When the Heroine who sate at a Distance saw his last Instant come she threw her self at his Feet and kneeling pressed his Hand to her Lips in which Posture she continued under the Agony of an unutterable Sorrow till con∣ducted from our Sight by her Attendants That commanding Awe which accompanies the Grief of great Minds restrained the Multitude while in her Presence but as soon as she retired they gave Way to their Distraction and all the Islanders called upon their deceased Hero To him methought they cried out as to a Guar∣dian Being and I gathered from their broken Accents That it was he who had the Empire over the Ocean and its Powers by which he had long protected the Island from Shipwreck and Inva∣sion They now give a Loose to their Moan and think themselves exposed without Hopes of Humane or Divine Assistance While the Peo∣ple ran wild and expressed all the different Forms of Lamentation methought a Sable Cloud overshadowed the whole Land and co∣vered its Inhabitants with Darkness No Glimpse of Light appeared except one Ray from Heaven upon the Place in which the He∣roine now secluded her self from the World with her Eyes fixed on those Abodes to which her Consort was ascended Methought a long Period of Time had passed away in Mourning  and in Darkness when a Twilight began by Degrees to enlighten the Hemisphere and look∣ing round me I saw a Boat rowed towards the Shore in which sate a Personage adorned with Warlike Trophies bearing on his left Arm a Shield on which was engraven the Image of  Victory  and in his Right Hand a Branch of O∣live His Visage was at once so winning and so awful that the Shield and the Olive seemed equally suitable to his Genius  When this illustrious  About this Time the D of  M  returned from  Holland  with the Preliminaries of a Peace  Person touched on the Shore he was received by the Acclamations of the People and followed to the Palace of the Heroine No Pleasure in the Glory of her Arms or the Acclamations of her applauding Subjects were ever capable to suspend her Sorrow for one Moment till she saw the Olive Branch in the Hand of that auspicious Messenger At that Sight as Heaven bestows its Blessings on the Wants and Importunities of Mortals out of its Native Bounty and not to encrease its own Power or Honour in Compassion to the World the Celestial Mourner was then first seen to turn her Regard to Things below and taking the Branch out of the Warrior's Hand looked at it with much Satisfaction and spoke of the Bles∣sings of Peace with a Voice and Accent such as that in which Guardian Spirits whisper to dy∣ing Penitents Assurances of Happiness The Air was hushed the Multitude attentive and all Nature in a Pause while she was speaking But as soon as the Messenger of Peace had made some low Reply in which methought I heard the Word  Iberia  the Heroine assuming a more severe Air but such as spoke Resolution without Rage returned him the Olive and  again veiled her Face Loud Cries and Clashing of Arms immediately followed which forced me from my charming Vision and drove me back to these Mansions of Care and Sorrow  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd Apr  to  Saturd Apr    Will's Coffeehouse  April  THis Evening we were entertained with  The Old Batchelor  a Comedy of deserved Re∣putation In the Character which gives Name to the Play there is excellently represented the Reluctance of a battered Debauchee to come into the Trammels of Order and Decency He neither languishes nor burns but frets for Love The Gentlemen of more regular Behaviour are drawn with much Spirit and Wit and the  Dra∣ma  introduced by the Dialogue of the first Scens with uncommon yet natural Conversation The Part of  Fondlewife  is a lively Image of the unsea∣sonable Fondness of Age and impotence But in∣stead of such agreeable Works as these the Town has this half Age been tormented with Insects called  Easie Writers  whose Abilities Mr  Wicherly  one Day described excellently well in one Word  That  said he  among these Fellows is called  Easy Writing  which any one may easily write  Such Jantie Scribblers are so justly laughed at for their Sonnets on  Phillis

and described Things exactly as they happen He never forms Fields or Nymphs or Groves where they are not but  makes the Incidents just as they really appear For an Example of it I stole out of his

Had par'd the Street and sprinkled round the Floor  Now  Moll  had whirl'd her Mop with dextr'ous Airs  Prepar'd to scrub the Entry and the Stairs  The Youth with broomy Stumps began to trace  The Kennel Edge where Wheels had worn the Place  The Smallcoal Man was heard with Cadence deep  Till drown'd in shriller Notes of Chimney sweep  Duns at his Lordship's Gate began to meet  And Brickdust  Moll  had scream'd through half a Street  The Turnkey now his Flock returning sees  Duly let out a' Nights to steal for Fees  The watchful Bailiffs take their silent Stands  And Schoolboys lag with Satchels in their Hands  All that I apprehend is that dear  Numps  will be angry I have published these Lines not that he has any Reason to be ashamed of them but for fear of those Rogues the Bane to all excel∣lent Performances the  Imitators  Therefore beforehand I bar all Descriptions of the Even∣ing as a Medley of Verses signifying GreyPeas are now cried warm That Wenches now begin to amble round the Passages of the Play∣house Or of Noon as That find Ladies and great Beaux are just yawning out of their Beds and Windows in  PallMall  and so forth I forewarn also all Persons from encouraging any Draughts after my Cousin and foretel any  Man who shall go about to imitate him that he will be very insipid The Family Stock is em∣barked in this Design and we will not admit of Counterfeits Dr  Anderson  and his Heirs enjoy his Pills Sir  Willium Read  has the Cure of Eyes and Monsieur  Roselli  can only cure the Gout We pretend to none of these Things but to exa∣mine who and who are together to tell any mistaken Man he is not what he believes he is to distinguish Merit and expose false Pretences to it is a Liberty our Family has by Law in 'em from an InterMarriage with a Daughter of Mr  Scoggin  the famous Droll of the last Centu∣ry This Right I design to make Use of but will not encroach upon the abovementioned Adepts or any other At the same Time I shall take all the Privileges I may as an  Englishman  and will lay hold of the late Act of Naturaliza∣tion to introduce what I shall think fit from  France  The Use of that Law may I hope be extended to people the polite World with new Characters as well as the Kingdom it self with new Subjects Therefore an Author of that Na∣tion called  Le Bruyere  I shall make bold with on such Occasions The last Person I read of in that Writer was Lord  Timon Timon  says my Author is the most generous of all Men but is so hurri∣ed away with that strong Impulse of Bestowing that he confers Benefits without Distinction and is Munificent without laying Obligations For all the Unworthy who receive from him have so little Sense of this noble Infirmity that they look upon themselves rather as Partners in a Spoil than Partakers of a Bounty The other Day coming into  Paris  I met  Timon  going out on Horseback attended only by one Servant It struck me with a sudden Damp to see a Man of so excellent a Disposition and that understood making a Figure so very well so much shorten'd  in his Retinue But passing by his House I saw his great Coach break to Pieces before his Door and by a strange Inchantment immediately turned into many different Vehicles The first was a very pretty Chariot into which step'd his Lordship's Secretary The second was hung a little heavier into that strutted the Fat Steward In an Instant follow'd a Chaise which was enter'd by the Butler The rest of the Body and Wheels were forthwith changed into Gocarts and ran away with by the Nurses and Brats of the rest of the Family What makes these Misfortunes in the Affairs of  Timon  the more astonishing is That he has a better Understanding than those who cheat him so that a Man knows not which more to wonder at the Indifference of the Ma∣ster or the Impud nce of the Servant  White's Chocolatehouse  April  It is a Matter of much Speculation among the Beaus and Oglers what it is that can have made so suddeu a Change as has been of late observed in the whole Behaviour of  Pastorella  who never sate still a Moment till she was Eigh∣teen which she has now exceeded by Two Months Her Aunt who has the Care of her has not been always so rigid as she is at this present Date but has so good a Sense of the Frailty of Woman and Falshood of Man that she resolved on all Manner of Methods to keep  Pastorella  if possible in Safety against her self and all her Admirers At the same Time the good Lady knew by long Experience that a gay Inclination curbed too rashly would but run to the greater Excesses for that Restraint Therefore intended to watch her and take some Opportunity of engaging her insensibly in her own Interests without the Anguish of an Admonition You are to know then That Miss with all her Flirting and Ogling had also  naturally a strong Curiosity in her and was the greatest EvesDropper breathing  Parisatis  for so her prudent Aunt is called observed this Humour and retires one Day to her Closet into which she knew  Pastorella  would peep and listen to know how she was employed It happened accordingly and the young Lady saw her good Governante on her Knees and after a mental Behaviour break into these Words  As for the dear Child committed to my Care let her Sobriety of Carriage and Severity of Behaviour be such as may make that Noble Lord who is taken with her Beauty turn his De∣signs to such as are honourable  Here  Parisatis  heard her Neece nestle closer to the KeyHole She then goes on  Make her the joyful Mother of a numerous and wealthy Offspring and let her Carriage be such as may make this Noble Youth expect the Blessings of an happy Marriage from the Singularity of her Life in this loose and cen∣sorious Age  Miss having heard enough sneaks off for Fear of Discovery and immediately at her Glass alters the Sitting of her Head then pulls up her Tucker and forms herself into the exact Manner of  Lindamira  In a Word be∣comes a sincere Convert to every Thing that's commendable in a fine young Lady and Two or Three such Matches as her Aunt feigned in her Devotions are at this Day in her Choice This is the History and Original Cause of  Pasto∣rella  's Conversion from Coquettry The Pru∣dence in the Management of this young Lady's Temper and good Judgment of it is hardly to be exceeded I scarce remember a greater In∣stance of Forbearance of the usual peevish Way with which the Aged treat the Young than this except that of our famous  Noy  whose good Na∣ture went so far as to make him put off his Admonitions to his Son even till after his Death  and did not give him his Thoughts of him till he came to read that memo able Passage in his Will  All the rest of my Estate  says he  I leave to my Son  Edward  who is Executor to this my Will to be squandred as he shall think fit I leave it him for that Purpose and hope no better from him  A generous Disdain and Reflection upon how little he deserved from so excellent a Father reformed the young Man and made  Edward  from an errant Rake become a fine Gentleman  St James's Coffeehouse  April  Letters from  Portugal  of the th Instant dated from  Estremos  say That on the th the Earl of  Galway  arrived at that Place and had the Satis∣faction to see the Quarters well furnished with all Manner of Provisions and a Quantity of Bread sufficient for subsuting the Troops for Days besides Bisket for Days The Enemy give out That they shall bring into the Field Regiments of Horse and Battalions The Troops in the Service of  Portugal  will make up Foot and Horse On the Day these Letters were dispatched the Earl of  Galway  re∣ceived Advice that the Marquis  de Bay  was preparing for some Enterprize by gathering his Troops together on the Frontiers Where∣upon his Excellency resolved to go that same Night to  Villa Vicosa  to assemble the Troops in that Neighbourhood in order to disappoint his Designs  Yesterday in the Evening Captain  Foxon  Aid∣deCamp to MajorGeneral  Cadogan  arriv'd here Express from the Duke of  Marlborough  And this Day a Mail is come in with Letters dated from  Brussels  of the th of  May N S  which advise That the Enemy had drawn togethera Body consisting of Men with a Design as was supposed to intercept the great Convoy  on the March towards  Lisle  which was safely arrived at  Menin  and  Courtray  in its Way to that Place the  French  having retired without making any Attempt  We hear from the  Hague  That a Person of the First Quality is arrived in the  LowCountries  from  France  in order to be a Plenipotentiary in an ensuing Treaty of Peace  Letters from  France  acknowledge That Mon∣sieur  Bernard  has made no higher Offers of Satis∣faction to his Creditors than of  l per Cent  These Advices add That the Mareschal  Bouf∣flers  Monsieur  Torcy  who distinguished himself formerly by advising the Court of  France  to adhere to the Treaty of Partition and Monsieur  d' Harcourt  who negotiated with Cardinal  Por∣tocarrero  for the Succession of the Crown of  Spain  in the House of  Bourbon  are all Three joined in a Commission for a Treaty of Peace The Mareschal is come to  Ghent  The other Two are arrived at the  Hague  It is confidently reported here That the Right Honourable the Lord  Townshend  is to go with his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  into  Holland  The TATLER N  o    By Mrs  Jenny Distaff  HalfSister to Mr  Bickerstaff  From  Saturd April  to  Tuesd May    From my own Apartment  May  MY Brother  Isaac  having a sudden Occasion to go out of Town ordered me to take upon me the Dispatch of the next Advices from Home with Liberty to speak it my own Way  not doubting the Allowances which would be given to a Writer of my Sex You may be sure I undertook it with much Satisfaction And I confess I am not a little pleased with the Op∣portunity of running over all the Papers in his Closet which he has left open for my Use on this Occasion The first that I lay my Hands on is A Treatise concerning  The Empire of Beauty  and the Effects it has had in all Nations of the World upon the publick and private Actions of Men with an Appendix which he calls  The Batchelor's Scheme for Governing his Wife  The first Thing he makes this Gentleman propose is That she shall be no Woman for she is to have an Aversion to Balls to Opera's to Visits She is to think his Company suffi∣cient to fill up all the Hours of Life with great Satisfaction She is never to believe any other Man Wise Learned or Valiant or at least but in a second Degree In the next Place he in∣tends she shall be a Cuckold but expects that he himself must live in perfect Security from that Terror He dwells a great while on Instructions for her discreet Behaviour in case of his Falshood I have not Patience with these unreasonable Expectations therefore turn back to the Treatise it self Here indeed my Bro∣ther deduces all the Revolutions among Men from the Passion of Love and in his Preface answers that usual Observation against us  That there is no Quarrel without a Woman in it  with a gallant Assertion  That there is nothing else worth Quarrelling for  My Brother is of a Com∣plexion truly Amorous all his Thoughts and Actions carry in 'em a Tincture of that obliging Inclination and this Turn has opened his Eyes to see we are not the inconsiderable C eatures which unlucky Pretenders to our Favour would insinuate He observes That no Man begins to  make any tolerable Figure till he sets out with he Hopes of Pleasing some one of us No soon∣er he takes that in Hand but he pleases every one else by the by It has an immediate Effect upon his Behaviour There is Colonel  Ranter  who never spoke without an Oath till he saw the Lady  Betty Modish  now never gives his Man an Order but it is Pray  Tom  do it The Drawers where he drinks live in perfect Hap∣piness He asked  Will  at the  George  t'other Day How he did Where he used to say  Damn it Is it so  He now believes  there is some Mistake He must confess he is of another Opinion but however he won't insist  Every Temper except downright insipid is to be animated and softned by the Influence of Beauty But of this untractable Sort is a life∣less handsome Fellow that visits us whom I have dressed at this Twelvemonth but he is as insensible of all the Arts I use as if he conversed all that Time with his Nurse He outdoes our whole Sex in all the Faults our Enemies im∣pute to us he has brought Laziness into an Opi∣nion and makes his Indolence his Philosophy Insomuch that no long r ago than Yesterday in the Evening he gave me this Account of him∣self  I am Madam perfectly unmoved at all that passes among Men and seldom gives my self the Fa∣tigue of going among 'em but when I do I always appear the same Thing to those whom I converse with My Hours of Existence or being awake are from Eleven in the Morning to Eleven at Night half of which I live to my self in picking my Teeth washing my Hands paring my Nails and looking in the Glass The Insignificancy of my Manners to the rest of the World makes the Laughers call me a  Quid Nunc  a Phrase which I neither under∣stand or shall ever enquire what they mean by it The last of me each Night is at St  James  's Coffeehouse  where I converse yet never fall into a Dispute on any Occasion but leave the Under∣standing I have Passive of all that goes through it without entring into the Business of Life And thus Madam have I arrived by Laziness to what others pretended to by Philosophy a perfect Neglect of the World  Sure if our Sex had the Liberty of frequenting Publick Houses and Con∣versations we should put these Rivals of our Faults and Follies out of Countenance How∣ever we shall soon have the Pleasure of being acquainted with 'em one Way or other for my Brother  Isaac  designs for the Use of our Sex to give the exact Characters of all the Chief Politicians who frequent any of the Coffeehouses from St  James  's to the  Change  but de∣signs to begin with that Cluster of Wise Heads as they are found sitting every Evening from the Leftside of the Fire at the  Smyrna  to the Door This will be of great Service for us and I have Authority to promise an exact Jour∣nal of their Deliberations the Publication of which I am to be allowed for PinMoney In the mean Time I cast my Eye upon a new Book which gave me a more pleasing Entertainment being a sixth Part of Miscellany Poems pub∣lish'd by  Jacob Tonson  which I find by my Bro∣ther's Notes upon it no Way inferior to the other Volumes There are it seems in this a Collection of the best Pastorals that have hi∣therto appeared in  England  but among them none superior to that Dialogue between  Sylvia  and  Dorinda  written by one of my own Sex where all our little Weaknesses are laid open in a Manner more just and with truer Raillery than ever Man yet hit upon  Only this I now discern  From the Things thou'st have me learn  That Womankind's peculiar Joys  From past or present Beauties rise  But to reassume my first Design there can∣not be a greater Instance of the Command of Females than in the prevailing Charms of the Heroine in the Play which was acted this Night call'd  All for Love  or  The World well lost  The enamoured  Antony  resigns Glory and Power to the Force of the attractive  Cleopatra  whose Charms were the Defence of her Dia∣dem against a People otherwise invincible It is so natural for Women to talk of themselves that it is to be hoped all my own Sex at least will pardon me that I could fall into no other Discourse If we have their Favour we give our selves very little Anxiety for the rest of our Readers I believe I see a Sentence of  Latin  in my Brother's DayBook of Wit which seems applicable on this Occasion and in Contempt of the Criticks  Tristitiam Metus  Tradam protectis in Mare Criticum  Portare Ventis  But I am interrupted by a Packet from Mr  Kid∣ney  from St  James  's Coffeehouse which I am obliged to insert in the very Style and Words which Mr  Kidney  uses in his Letter  St James's Coffeehouse  May  We are advised by Letters from  Bern  dated the st Instant  N S  That the Duke of  Berwick  arrived at  Lyons  the th of the last Month and continued his Journey the next Day to visit the Passes of the Mountains and other Posts in  Dau∣phine  and  Provence  These Letters also informed us That the Miseries of the People in  France  are heightened to that Degree that unless a Peace be speedily concluded half of that King∣dom would perish for want of Bread On the th the Mareschal  de Thesse  passed through  Lyons  in his Way to  Versailles  and Two Batta∣lions which were marching from  Alsace  to re∣inforce  the Army of the Duke of  Berwick  passed also through that Place Those Troops were to be followed by Battalions more  Letters from  Naples  of the th of  April  say That the Marquis  de Prie  's Son was arrived there with Instructions from his Father to sig∣nify to the Viceroy the Necessity his Imperial Majesty was under of desiring an Aid from that Kingdom for carrying on the extraordinary Expences of the War On the th of the same Month they made a Review of the  Spanish  Troops in that Garrison and afterwards of the Marines one Part of whom will embark with those designed for  Barcelona  and the rest are to be sent on Board the Gallies appointed to convoy Provisions to that Place  We hear from  Rome  by Letters dated the th of  April  That the Count  de Mellos  Envoy from the King of  Portugal  had made his Pub∣lick Entry into that City with much State and Magnificence The Pope has lately held Two other Consistories wherein he made a Promo∣tion of Two Cardinals but the Acknowledg∣ment of King  Charles  is still deferred  Letters from other Parts of  Italy  advise us That the Doge of  Venice  continues dangerously Ill That the Prince  de Carignan  having relaps'd into a violent Fever died the d of  April  in his th Year  Advices from  Vienna  of the th of  April  im∣port That the Archbishop of  Saltzburg  is dead who is succeeded by Count  Harrach  formerly Bishop of  Vienna  and for these last Three Years Coadjutor to the said Archbishop and that Prince  Maximilian  of  Lichtenstein  has likewise depa ted this Life at his Country Seat called  Cromaw  in  Moravia  These Advices add That the Emperor has nam'd Count  Zinzendorf  Count  Goes  and Monsieur  Consbruck  for his Plenipo∣tentiaries  in an ensuing Treaty of Peace and they hear from  Hungary  That the Imperialists have had several successful Skirmishes with the Malecontents  Letters from  Paris  dated  May  the th say That the Mareschal  de Thesse  arrived there on the th of the last Month and that the Chevalier  de Beuil  was sent thither by Don  Pedro Rouquillo  with Advice That the Confederate Squadron ap∣peared before  Alicant  on the th and having for some Time cannonaded the City endeavoured to land some Troops for the Relief of the Ca∣stle but General  Stanhope  finding the Passes well guarded and the Enterprize dangerous demanded to capitulate for the Castle which being granted him the Garrison consisting of Regular Troops marched out with their Arms and Baggage the Day following and be∣ing received on Board they immediately set Sail for  Barcelona  These Letters add That the March of the  French  and  Swiss  Regiments is fur∣ther deferred for a few Days and that the Duke of  Nouilles  was just ready to set out for  Rous∣sillon  as well as the Count  de Bezons  for  Catalo∣nia  The same Advices say Bread was sold at  Pa∣ris  for  d per  Pound and that there was not half enough even at that Rate to supply the Necessities of the People which reduced them to the utmost Despair that Men had ta∣ken up Arms and having plunder'd the Market of the Suburb of St  Germain  pressed down by their Multitude the King's Guards who opposed them Two of those Mutineers were afterward seiz'd and condemn'd to Death but Four others went to the Magistrate who pronounc'd that Sen∣tence and told him He must expect to answer with his own Life for those of their Comrades All Order and Sense of Government being thus  lost among the enraged People to keep up a Show of Authority the Captain of the Guards who saw all their Insolence pretended That he had represented to the King their deplora∣ble Condition and had obtained their Pardon It is further reported That the Dauphin and Dutchess of  Burgundy  as they went to the O∣pera were surrounded by Crowds of People who upbraided them with their Neglect of the general Calamity in going to Diversions when the whole People were ready to perish for want of Bread Edicts are daily published to suppress these Riots and Papers with Menaces against the Government as publickly thrown about Among others these Words were dropped in a Court of Justice France  wants a  Ravilliac  or a  Jesuit  to deliver her  Besides this universal Di∣stress there is a contagious Sickness which it is feared will end in a Pestilence Letters from  Bourdeaux  bring Accounts no less lamentable The Peasants are driven by Hunger from their Abodes into that City and make Lamentations in the Streets without Redress  We are advised by Letters from the  Hague  dated the th Instant  N S  That on the th the Marquis  de Torcy  arrived there from  Paris  but the Passport by which he came having been sent blank by Monsieur  Rouille  he was there Two Days before his Quality was known That Minister offer'd to communicate to Mons  Hein∣sius  the Proposals which he had to make but the Pensionary refused to see them and said He would signify it to the

Eugene  was expected there the th Instant from  Brussels  'Tis said That besides Monsieur  de Torcy  and  Monsieur  Pajot  Director General of the Posts there are Two or Three Persons at the  Hague

send their Deputies to receive the Propositions of Peace made by the Court of  France  The TATLER N  o    By  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  From  Tuesday May  to  Thursday May    Will's Coffeehouse  May  A Kinsman has sent me a Letter wherein he informs me He had lately resolved to write an Heroick Poem but by Business has been interrupted and has only made one Simi∣litude which he should be afflicted to have wholly lost and begs of me to apply it to some∣thing being very desirous to see it well placed in the World I am so willing to help the Di∣stressed that I have taken it in But though his greater Genius might very well distinguish his Verses from mine I have marked where his begin His Lines are a Description of the Sun in Eclipse which I know nothing more like than a brave Man in Sorrow who bears it as he should without imploring the Pity of his Friends or being dejected with the Contempt of his Enemies As in the Case of  Cato  When all the Globe to  Caesar  's Fortune bow'd  Cato  alone his Empire disallow'd  With Inborn Strength alone oppos'd Mankind  With Heav'n in View to all below it blind  Regardless of his Friend's Applause or Moan  Alone Triumphant since he falls alone  ' Thus when the Ruler of the Genial Day  ' Behind some dark'ning Planet forms his Way  ' Desponding Mortals with officious Care  ' The Concave Drum and Magick Brass pre∣pare  ' Implore him to sustain th'important Fight  ' And save depending Worlds from endless Night  ' Fondly they hope their Labour may avail  ' To ease his Conflict and assist his Toil  ' Whilst he in Beams of Native Splendor bright  ' Tho' dark his Orb appear to Humane Sight  ' Shines to the Gods with more diffusive Light  ' To distant Stars with equal Glory burns  ' Inflames their Lamps and feeds their Gol∣den Urns  ' Sure to retain his known superior Tract  ' And proves the more illustrious by Defect  This is a very lively Image but I must take the Liberty to say My Kinsman drives the Sun a little like  Phaeton  He has all the Warmth of  Phaebus  but won't stay for his Direction of it  Avail  and  Toil Defect  and  Tract  will ne∣ver do for Rhimes But however he has the true Spirit in him for which Reason I was wil∣ling to entertain any Thing he pleas'd to send me The Subject which he writes upon naturally raises great Reflections in the Soul and puts us in Mind of the mixed Condition which we Mortals are to support which as it varies to Good or Bad adorns or defaces our Actions to the Beholders All which Glory and Shame must end in what we so much repine at Death But Doctrines on  this Occasion any other than that of living well are the most insignificant and most empty of all the Labours of Men None but a Tragedian can die by Rule and wait till he discovers a Plot or says a fine Thing upon his  Exit  In real Life this is a Chimaera and by Noble Spi∣rits it will be done decently without the O∣stentation of it We see Men of all Conditions and Characters go through it with equal Reso∣lution And if we consider the Speeches of the mighty Philosophers Heroes Lawgivers and Great Captains they can produce no more in a discerning Spirit than Rules to make a Man a Fop on his DeathBed Commend me to that natural Greatness of Soul expressed by an in∣nocent and consequently resolute Country Fel∣low who said in the Pains of the Cholick  If I once get this Breath out of my Body you shall hang me before you put it in again  Honest  Ned  and so he died  But it is to be supposed from this Place you may expect an Account of such a Thing as a New Play is not to be omitted That acted this Night is the newest that ever was writ The Au∣thor is my ingenious Friend Mr  Thomas Dy  This Drama is called  The Modern Prophets  and is a most unanswerable Satyr against the late Spirit of Enthusiasm The Writer had by long Experience observed That in Company very grave Discourses have been followed by Baw∣dry and therefore has turned the Humour that Way with great Success and taken from his Audience all Manner of Superstition by the A∣gitations of pretty Mrs  Bignall  whom he has with great Subtilty made a LaySister as well as a Prophetess by which Means she carries on the Affairs of both Worlds with great Suc∣cess My Friend designs to go on with another Work against Winter which he intends to call  The Modern Poets  a People no less mistaken in their Opinions of being inspired than the other In order to this he has by him several Songs besides many Ambiguities which cannot be mi∣staken for any Thing but what he means them Mr  Dy  generally writes StatePlays and is wonderfully useful to the World in such Repre∣sentations This Method is the same that was us'd by the Old  Athenians  to laugh out of Counte∣nance or promote Opinions among the People My Friend has therefore against this Play is acted for his own Benefit made Two Dances which may be also of an universal Benefit In the First he has represented Absolute Power in the Per∣son of a Tall Man with an Hat and Feather who gives his First Minister that stands just be∣fore him an huge Kick the Minister gives the Kick to the next before and so to the End of the Stage In the Moral and Practical Jest you are made to understand That there is in an Absolute Government no Gratification but giving the Kick you receive from one above you to one below you This is performed to a grave and melancholy Air but on a sudden the Tune moves quicker and the whole Company fall into a Circle and take Hands then at a certain sharp Note they move round and kick as kick can This latter Performance he makes to be the Representation of a Free State where if you all mind your Steps you may go round and round very jollily with a Motion pleasant to your selves and those you dance with Nay if you put your selves out at the worst you only kick and are kicked like Friends and Equals  From my own Apartment  May  Of all the Vanities under the Sun I confess that of being proud of one's Birth is the great∣est At the same Time since in this unreaso∣nable Age by the Force of prevailing Custom  Things in which Men have no Hand are impu∣ted to them and that I am used by some Peo∣ple as if  Isaac Bickerstaff  tho' I write my self  Esquire  was no Body To set the World right in that Particular I shall give you my Genea∣logy as a Kinsman of ours has sent it me from the  HeraldsOffice  It is certain and observed by the wisest Writers That there are Women who are not nicely Chast and Men not severely Honest in all Families therefore let those who may be apt to raise Aspersions upon ours please to give us as Impartial Account of their own and we shall be satisfied The Business of Heralds is a Matter of so great Nicety that to avoid Mistakes I shall give you my Cousin's Letter  Verbatim  without altering a Syllable  Dear Cousin  SInce you have been pleased to make your self so famous of late by your ingenious Writings and some Time ago by your learned Predictions Since  Partridge  of Immortal Memory is dead and gone who Poetical as he was could not understand his own Poetry and Philomathical as he was could not read his own Destiny Since the  Pope  the King of  France  and great Part of his Court are either literally or metaphorically defunct Since I say these Things not foretold by any one but your self have come to pass after so surprizing a Man∣ner 'tis with no small Concern I see the Original of the  Staffian  Race so little known in the World as it is at this Time for which Reason as you have employed your Studies in Astronomy and the Oc∣cult Sciences so I my Mother being a  Welch  Wo∣man dedicated mine to Genealogy particularly that of our own Family which for its Antiquity and Number may challenge any in  Great Britain  The  Staffs  are originally of  Staffordshire  which took its Name from them The First that I find of the  Staffs  was one  Jacobstaff  a famous and renowned Astronomer who by  Dorothy  his Wife had Issue Seven Sons  viz Bickerstaff Longstaff Wag∣staff Quarterstaff Whitestaff Falstaff  and  Tip∣staff  He also had a Younger Brother who was twice married and had Five Sons  viz Distaff Pikestaff Mopstaff Broomstaff  and  Ragged∣staff  As for the Branch from whence you spring I shall say very little of it only that 'tis the Chief of the  Staffs  and called  Bickerstaff quasi Bigger∣staff  as much as to say the  Great Staff  or  Staff  of  Staffs  and that it has applied it self to Astronomy with great Success after the Ex∣ample of our aforesaid Forefather The Descen∣dants from  Longstaff  the second Son were a rakish disorderly Sort of People and rambled from one Place to another till in  Harry II  's Time they settled in  Kent  and were called  LongTails  from the  LongTails  which were sent them as a Punishment for the Murder of  Thomas a Becket  as the Legends say They have been always seeked after by the Ladies but whether it be to show their Aversion to Popery or their Love to Miracles I can't say The  Wagstaffs  are a merry thought∣less Sort of People who have always been opinio∣nated of their own Wit they have turned them∣selves mostly to Poetry This is the most numerous Branch of our Family and the poorest The  Quar∣terstaffs  are most of them Prizefighters or Deer∣stealers There have been so many of them hanged lately that there are very few of that Branch of our Family left The  Whitestaffs  are all Courtiers and have had very considerable Places There have been some of them of that Strength and Dex∣terity That Five hundred of the ablest Men in the Kingdom have often tugged in vain to pull a Staff out of their Hands The  Falstaffs  are strangely given to Whoring and Drinking There are Abun∣dance of them in and about  London  And one Thing is very remarkable of this Branch and that  is There are just as many Women as Men in it There was a wicked Stick of Wood of this Name in  Harry IV  's Time one Sir  John Falstaff  As for  Tipstaff  the youngest Son he was an honest Fel∣low but his Sons and his Sons Sons have all of them been the veriest Rogues living 'Tis this un∣lucky Branch has stock'd the Nation with that Swarm of Lawyers Attorneys Serjeants and Bai∣liffs with which the Nation is overrun  Tip∣staff  being a Seventh Son used to cure the  King'sEvil  but his rascally Descendants are so far from having that healing Quality that by a Touch upon the Shoulder they give a Man such an ill Habit of Body that he can never come abroad af∣terwards This is all I know of the Line of  Ja∣cobstaff  His younger Brother  Isaacstaff  as I told you before had Five Sons and was married twice his First Wife was a  Staff  for they did not stand upon false Heraldry in those Days by whom he had one Son who in Process of Time being a Schoolma∣ster and well read in the  Greek  called himself  Distaff  or  Twicestaff  He was not very rich so he put his Children out to Trades and the  Distaffs  have ever since been employed in the Woollen and Linen Manufactures except my self who am a Genealogist  Pikestaff  the eldest Son by the Se∣cond Venter was a Man of Business a downright plodding Fellow and withal so plain that he be∣came a Proverb Most of this Family are at pre∣sent in the Army  Raggedstaff  was an unlucky Boy and used to tear his Clothes a getting Birds Nests and was always playing with a tame Bear his Father kept  Mopstaff  fell in love with one of his Father's Maids and used to help her to clean the House  Broomstaff  was a ChimneySweeper The  Mopstaffs  and  Broomstaffs  are naturally as civil People as ever went out of Doors but alas If they once

StageCoach he is obliged whether he has Passengers or not to set out Thus it fares with us Weekly Historians but indeed for my Particular I hope I shall soon have little more to do in this Work than to publish what is sent me from such as have Leisure and Capa∣city for giving Delight and being pleased in an elegant Manner The present Grandeur of  the  British  Nation might make us expect that we should rise in our Publick Diversions and Manner of enjoying Life in Proportion to our Advancement in Glory and Power Instead of that take and survey this Town and you'll find Rakes and Debauchees are your Men of Pleasure Thoughtless Atheists and Illiterate Drunkards call themselves FreeThinkers and Gamesters Banterers Biters Swearers and Twenty new born Insects more are in their se∣veral Species the Modern Men of Wit Hence it is that a Man who has been out of Town but one half Year has lost the Language and must have some Friend to stand by him and keep him in Countenance for talking common Sense To Day I saw a short Interlude at  White  's of this Nature which I took Notes of and put together as well as I could in a Publick Place The Persons of the  Drama  are  Pip  the last Gentleman

by the Count and cursedly out of Humour  Ac  Vowel'd Prithee  Trimmer  What does he mean by that  Trim  Have a Care  Harry  speak softly don't show your IgnoranceIf you do they'll bite you wheree'er they meet you they are such cursed Cursthe present Wits  Ac  Bite me What do you mean  Pip  Why Don't you know what Biting is Nay you are in the Right on't However one would learn it only to defend ones self against Men of Wit as one would know the Tricks of Play to be secure against the Cheats But don't you hear  Acorn  that Report That some Potentates of the Alliance have taken Care of

to me That he has been Vowel'd and they tell me I am Bit  Friend  You are to understand Sir That Simplicity of Behaviour which is the Perfection of good Breeding and good Sense is utterly lost in the World and in the Room of it there are started a Thousand little Inventions which Men barren of better Things take up in the Place of it Thus for every Character in Con∣versation that used to please there is an Impo∣stor put upon you Him whom we allow'd for∣merly for a certain pleasant Subtilty and natu∣ral Way of giving you an unexpected Hit cal∣led a  Droll  is now mimick'd by a  Biter  who is a dull Fellow that tells you a Lye with a grave Face and laughs at you for knowing him no better than to believe him Instead of that Sort of Companion who could rally you and keep his Countenance till he made you fall  into some little Inconsistency of Behaviour at which you your self could laugh with him you have the Sneerer who will keep you Company from Morning to Night to gather your Follies of the Day which perhaps you commit out of Confidence in him and expose you in the Even∣ing to all the Scorners in Town For your Man of Sense and free Spirit whose Set of Thoughts were built upon Learning Reason and Expe∣rience you have now an impudent Creature made up of Vice only who supports his Igno∣rance by his Courage and Want of Learning by Contempt of it  Ac  Dear Sir hold What you have told me already of this Change in Conversation is too miserable to be heard with any Delight but methinks as these new Creatures appear in the World it might give an excellent Field to Wri∣ters for the Stage to divert us with the Repre∣sentation of them there  Friend  No No As you say there might be some Hopes of Redress of these Grievances if there were proper Care taken of the Theatre but the History of that is yet more lamentable than that of the Decay of Conversation I gave you  Ac  Pray Sir a little I han't been in Town these Six Years till within this Fortnight  Friend  It is now some Years since several Revolutions in the Gay World had made the Empire of the Stage subject to very fatal Con∣vulsions which were too dangerous to be cured by the Skill of little King  Oberon  who then sate in the Throne of it The Laziness of this Prince threw him upon the Choice of a Person who was fit to spend his Life in Contentions an able and profound Attorney to whom he mort∣gaged his whole Empire This  Divite  is the most skilful of all Politicians He has a perfect  Art in being unintelligible in Discourse and un∣comeatable in Business But he having no Un∣derstanding in this polite Way brought in upon us to get in his Money Ladderdancers Ropedancers Jugglers and Mountebanks to strut in the Place of  Shakespear  's Heroes and  Johnson  's Humourists When the Seat of Wit was thus mortgaged without Equity of Redemption an Architect arose who has built the Muse a new Palace but secured her no Retinue so that in∣stead of Action there we have been put off by Song and Dance This latter Help of Sound has also began to fail for want of Voices there∣fore the Palace has since been put into the Hands of a Surgeon who cuts any Foreign Fellow in∣to an Eunuch and passes him upon us for a Singer of  Italy  Ac  I'll go out of Town to Morrow  Friend  Things are come to this Pass and yet the World will not understand that the Theatre has much the same Effect on the Manners of the Age as the Bank on the Credit of the Na∣tion Wit and Spirit Humour and good Sense can never be revived but under the Government of those who are Judges of such Talents who know that whatever is put up in their Stead is but a short and trifling Expedient to sup∣port the Appearance of them for a Season It is possible a Peace will give Leisure to put these Matters under new Regulations but at pre∣sent all the Assistance we can see towards our Recovery is as far from giving us Help as a Poultice is from performing what can be done only by the Grand Elixir  Will's Coffeehouse  May  According to our late Design in the applauded Verses on the Morning which you lately had from hence we proceed to improve that just Intention and present you with other Labours  made proper to the Place in which they were written The following Poem comes from  Co∣penhagen  and is as fine a Winterpiece as we have ever had from any of the Schools of the most learned Painters Such Images as these give us a new Pleasure in our Sight and fix up∣on our Minds Traces of Reflection which ac∣company us whenever the like Objects occur In short excellent Poetry and Description dwell upon us so agreeably that all the Readers of them are made to think if not write like Men of Wit But it would be Injury to detain you longer from this excellent Performance which is addressed to the Earl of  Dorset  by Mr  Philips  the Author of several choice Poems in Mr  Ton∣son  's new Miscellany  Copenhagen  March  From Frozen Climes and endless Tracks of Snow  From Streams that Northern Winds forbid to flow  What Present shall the Muse to  Dorset  bring  Or how so near the Pole attempt to sing  The heary Winter here conceals from Sight  All pleasing Objects that to Verse invite  The Hills and Dales and the delightful Woods  The Flowry Plains and Silver Streaming Floods  By Snow disguis'd in bright Confusion lye  And with one dazling Waste fatigue the Eye  No gentle breathing Breeze prepares the Spring  No Birds within the Desart Region sing  The Ships unmov'd the boist'rous Winds defie  While rattling Chariots o'er the Ocean fly  The vast  Leviathan  wants Room to play  And spout his Waters in the Face of Day  The starving Wolves along the main Sea prowl  And to the Moon in Icy Valleys howl  For many a shining League the level Main  Here spreads it self into a Glassy Plain  There solid Billows of enormous Size  Alpes  of green Ice in wild Disorder rise  And yet but lately have I seen e'en here  The Winter in a lovely Dress appear  Eer yet the Clouds lot fall the treasur'd Snow  Or Winds begun through hazy Skies to blow  At Ev'ning a keen Eastern Breeze arose  And the descending Rain unsully'd freze  Soon as the silent Shades of Night withdrew  The ruddy Morn disclos'd at once to View  The Face of Nature in a rich Disguise  And brighten'd ev'ry Object to my Eyes  For ev'ry Shrub and ev'ry Blade of Grass  And ev'ry pointed Thorn seem'd wrought in Glass  In Pearls and Rubies rich the Hawthorns show  While through the Ice the Crimson Berries glow  The thick sprung Reeds the watry Marshes yield  Seem polish'd Lances in a hostile Field  The Stag in limpid Currents with Surprize  Sees Chrystal Branches on his Forehead rise  The spreading Oak the Beech and tow'ring Pine  Glaz'd over in the freezing Aether shine  The frighted Birds the rattling Branches shun  That wave and glitter in the distant Sun  When if a sudden Gust of Wind arise  The brittle Forrest into Atoms flies  The crackling Wood beneath the Tempest bends  And in a spangled Show'r the Prospect ends  Or if a Southern Gale the Region warm  And by Degrees unbind the Wintry Charm  The Traveller a miry Country sees  And Journeys sad beneath the dropping Trees  Like some deluded Peasant  Merlin  leads  Thro' fragrant Bow'rs and thro' delicious Meads  While here inchanted Gardens to him rise  And airy Fabricks there attract his Eyes  His wand'ring Feet the Magick Paths pursue  And while he thinks the fair Illusion true  The trackless Scenes disperse in fluid Air  And Woods and Wilds and Thorny Ways appear  A tedious Road the weary Wretch returns  And as he goes the transiens Vision mourns  From my own Apartment  May  There has a Mail this Day arrived from  Hol∣land  but the Matter of the Advices importing rather what gives us great Expectations than any positive Assurances I shall for this Time decline giving you what I know and apply the following Verses of Mr  Dryden  in the Second Part of  Almanzor  to the present Circumstances of Things without discovering what my Know∣ledge in Astronomy suggests to me  When Empire in its Childhood first appears  A watchful Fate e'ersees its tender Years  Till grown more strong it thrusts and stretches out  And elbows all the Kingdoms round about  The Place thus made for its first breathing free  It moves again for Ease and Luxury  Till swelling by Degrees it has possest  The greater Space and now crowds up the rest  When from behind there starts some petty State  And pushes on its now unweildy Fate  Then down the Precipice of Time it goes  And sinks in Minutes which in Ages rose  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd May  to  Tuesd May    From my own Apartment  May  MUch Hurry and Business had to Day per∣plex'd me into a Mood too thoughtful for going into Company for which Reason in stead of the Tavern I went into  Lincoln's InnWalks  and having taken a Round or Two I sate down according to the allowed Familia∣rity of these Places on a Bench at the other End of which sate a venerable Gentleman who speaking with a very affable Air  Mr  Bicker∣staff said he  I take it for a very great Piece of good Fortune that you have found me out Sir  said I  I had never that I know of the Honour of seeing you before That  replied he  is what I have often lamented but I assure you I have for many Years done you good Offices without being observed by you or else when you had any little Glimpse of my being concerned in an Affair you have fled from me and shunned me like an Ene∣my but however the Part I am to act in the World is such that I am to go on in doing Good though I meet with never so many Repulses even from those I oblige  This thought I shows a great good Nature but little Judgment in the Persons upon whom he confers his Favours He immediately took Notice to me That he obser∣ved by my Countenance I thought him indiscreet in his Beneficence and proceeded to tell me his Quality in the following Manner  I know thee  Isaac  to be so well vers'd in the Occult Sciences that I need not much Preface or make long Pre∣parations to gain you Faith that there are Airy Beings who are employed in the Care and Atten∣dance  of Men as Nurses are to Infants till they come to an Age in which they can actof themselves These Beings are usually called amongst Men  Guar∣dian Angels  and Mr  Bickerstaff  I am to ac∣quaint you that I am to be yours for some Time to come it being our Orders to vary our Stations and sometimes to have me Pationt under our Pro∣tection and sometimes another with a Power of assuming what Shape we please to ensuare our Words unto their own Good I have of late been upon such hard Duty and know you have so much Work for me that I think fit to appear to you Face to Face to desire you would give me as little Oc∣casion for Vigilance as you can Sir  said I  it will be a great Instruction to me in my Behaviour if you please to give me some Account of your late Employments and what Hardships or Satisfactions you have had in them that I may govern my self accordingly  He answered To give you an Ex∣ample of the Drudgery we go through I will entertain you only with my Three last Stations I was on the First of  April  last put to mortifie a great Beauty with whom I was a Week from her I went to a common Swearer and have been last with a Gamester When I first came to my Lady I found my great Work was to guard well her Eyes and Ears but her Flatte∣rers were so numerous and the House after the modern Way so full of Lookingglasses that I seldom had her safe but in her Sleep When∣ever we went Abroad we were surrounded by an Army of Enemies When a wellmade Man appeared he was sure to have a Sideglance of Observation If a disagreeable Fellow he had a full Face out of meer Inclination to Con∣quests But at the Close of the Evening on the Sixth of the last Month my Ward was fit∣ting on a Couch reading  Ovid's Epistles  and as she came to this Line of  Helen  to  Paris  She half consents who silently denies  enter'd  Philander  who is the most skilful of all Men in an Address to Women He is arri∣ved at the Perfection of that Art which gains them which is  To talk like a very miserable Man but look like a very happy One  I saw  Dictinna  blush at his Entrance which gave me the Alarm but he immediately said something so agreeable on her being at Study and the No∣velty of finding a Lady employed in so grave a Manner that he on a sudden became very fami∣liarly a Man of no Consequence and in an In∣stant laid all her Suspicions of his Skill asleep as he almost had done mine till I observed him very dangerously turn his Discourse upon the Elegance of her Dress and her Judgment in the Choice of that very pretty Mourning Having had Women before under my Care I trembled at the Apprehension of a Man of Sense who could talk upon Trifles and resolved to stick to my Post with all the Circumspection imaginable In short I prepossessed her against all he could say to the Advantage of her Dress and Person but he turned again the Discourse where I found I had no Power o ver her on the abusing her Friends and Acquaintance He allowed in∣deed That  Flora  had a little Beauty and a great deal of Wit but then she was so ungainly in her Behaviour and such a laughing  HoydenPastorella  had with him the Allowance of being Blameless But what was that towards being Praiseworthy To be only Innocent is not to be Virtuous He afterwards spoke so much a∣gainst Mrs  Dipple  's Forehead Mrs  Prim  's Mouth Mrs  Dentifrice  's Teeth and Mrs  Fidget  's Cheeks that she grew downright in Love with him For it is always to be understood That a Lady takes all you detract from the rest of her Sex to  be a Gift to her In a Word Things went so far that I was dismissed and she will remem∣ber that Evening Nine Months from the Sixth of  April  by a very remarkable Token The next as I said I went to was a common Swea∣rer Never was a Creature so puzzled as my self when I came first to view his Brain half of it was worn out and filled up with meer Exple∣tives that had nothing to do with any other Parts of the Texture therefore when he cal∣led for his Clothes in a Morning he would cry  JohnJohn  does not answer  What a Plague No Body there What the Devil and rot me  John  for a laxy Dog as you are  I knew no Way to cure him but by writing down all he said one Morning as he was dressing and lay∣ing it before him on the Toilet when he came to pick his Teeth The last Recital I gave him of what he said for half an Hour before was  What a Pox rot me Where is the Washball Call the Chairmen Damn 'em I warrant they are at the Alehouse already Zounds and Con∣found 'em  When he came to the Glass he takes up my Note  Ha This Fellow is worse than me What Does he swear with Pen and Ink  But reading on he found them to be his own Words The Stratagem had so good an Effect upon him that he grew immediately a new Man and is learning to speak without an Oath which makes him extremely short in his Phrases for as I observed before a Common Swearer has a Brain without any Idea on the Swearing Side therefore my Ward has yet mighty little to say and is forced to substitute some other Vehicle of Nonsence to supply the Defect of his usual Expletives When I left him he made Use of  Odsbodikins Oh me  and  Never stir alive  and so forth which gave me the Hopes of his Recovery So I went to the next I told you of  the Gamester When we first take our Place about a Man the Receptacles of the  Pericra∣nium  are immediately searched In his I found no one ordinary Trace of Thinking but strong Passion violent Desires and a continued Series of different Changes had torn it to Pieces There appeared no middle Condition the Tri∣umph of a Prince or the Misery of a Beggar were his alternate States I was with him no longer than one Day which was Yesterday In the Morning at Twelve we were worth Four Thousand Pounds at Three we were arrived at Six Thousand half an Hour after we were reduced to One Thousand at Four of the Clock we were down to Two Hundred at Five to Fifty at Six to Five at Seven to One Gui∣nea the next Bet to Nothing This Morning he borrowed Half a Crown of the Maid who cleans his Shoes and is now gaming in  Lin∣colnsInnFields  among the Boys for Farthings and Oranges till he has made up Three Pieces and then he returns to  White  's into the best Company in Town This ended our first Dis∣course and it is hoped you will forgive me that I have picked so little out of my Compa∣nion at our first Interview In the next 'tis possible he may tell me more pleasing Incidents for though he is a Familiar he is not an Evil Spirit  St James's Coffeehouse  May  We hear from the  Hague  of the th Instant  N S  That Monsieur  de Torcy  hath had frequent Con∣ferences with the Grand Pensioner and the other Ministers who were heretofore commis∣sioned to treat with Monsieur  Rouille  The Pre∣liminaries of a Peace are almost settled and the Proceedings wait only for the Arrival of the Duke of  Marlborough  after whose Approba∣tion of the Articles proposed it is not doubted  but the Methods of the Treaty will be publickly known In the mean Time the States have declared an Abhorrence of making any Step in this great Affair but in Concert with the Court of  Great Britain  and other Princes of the Alliance The Posture of Affairs in  Franes  does necessarily oblige that Nation to be very much in Earnest in their Offers and Monsieur  de Torcy  hath professed to the Grand Pensioner That he will avoid all Occasions of giving him the least Jealousie of his using any Address in private Conversations for accomplishing the Ends of his Embassy It is said That as soon as the Preliminaries are adjusted that Minister is to return to the  French  Court The States of  Holland  have resolved to make it an Instruction to all their Men of War and Privateers to bring into their Ports whatever Neutral Ships they shall meet with laden with Corn and bound for  France  and to avoid all Cause of Complaint from the Potentates to whom these Ships shall belong their full Demand for their Freight shall be paid them there The  French  Prote∣stants residing in that Country have applied themselves to their respective Magistrates desi∣ring that there may be an Article in the Trea∣ty of Peace which may give Liberty of Con∣science to the Protestants in  France  Monsieur  Bosnage  Minister of the  Walloon  Church at  Rot∣terdam  has been at the  Hague  and hath had some Conferences with the Deputies of the States on that Subject It is reported there That all the  French  Refugees in those Domi∣nions are to be naturalized that they may enjoy the same good Effects of the Treaty with the  Hollanders  themselves in respect to  France  Letters from  Paris  say The People conceiv  great Hopes of a sudden Peace from Monsieu  Torcy  's being employed in the Negotiation h  being a Minister of too great Weight in that Court to be sent on any Employment in which his Master would not act in a Manner wherein he might justly promise himself Success The  France  Advices add That there is an Insurrection in  Poicton  Men having taken up Arms and beaten the Troops which were appointed to disperse them Three of the Mutineers being taken were immediately executed and as ma∣ny of the King's Party were used after the same Manner  Our late Act of Naturalization hath had so great an Effect in Foreign Parts that some Princes have prohibited the  French  Refugees in their Dominions to sell or transfer their Estates to any other of their Subjects and at the same Time have granted them greater Immunities than they hitherto enjoyed It has been also thought necessary to restrain their own Subjects from leaving their native Country on Pain of Death  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd May  to  Thursd May    From my own Apartment  May  HAD it not been that my Familiar had ap∣peared to me as I told you in my last in Person I had certainly been unable to have found even Words without Meaning to keep up my Intelligence with the Town But he has checked me severely for my Despondence and ordered me to go on in my Design of observing upon Things and forbearing Persons for said he the Age you live in is such that a good Pi∣cture of any Vice or Virtue will infallibly be  misrepresented and though none will take the kind Descriptions you make so much to them∣selves as to wish well to the Author yet all will resent the ill Characters you produce out of Fear of their own Turn in the Licence you must be obliged to take if you point at particu∣lar Persons I took his Admonition kindly and immediately promised him to beg Pardon of the Author of the  Advice to the Poets  for my Rail∣lery upon his Work tho' I aimed at no more in that Examination but to convince him and all Men of Genius of the Folly of laying them∣selves out on such Plans as are below their Cha∣racters I hope too it was done without IllBreeding and nothing spoken below what a Ci∣vilian as it is allowed I am may utter to a Physician After this Preface all the World may be safe from my Writings for if I can find nothing to commend I am silent and will for∣bear the Subject For though I am a Reformer I scorn to be an Inquisitor  It would become all Men as well as me to lay before 'em the noble Character of  Verus  the Magistrate who always sate in Triumph over and Contempt of Vice He never searched after it or spared it when it came before him At the same Time He could see thro' the Hypocri∣sy and Disguise of those who have no Pretence to Virtue themselves but by their Severity to the Vicious This same  Verus  was in Times long past Chief Justice as we call it amongst us in  Faelicia  He was a Man of profound Knowledge of the Laws of his Country and as just an Ob∣server of 'em in his own Person He considered Justice as a Cardinal Virtue not as a Trade for Maintenance Wherever he was Judge he ne∣ver forgot that he was also Council The Cri∣minal before him was always sure he stood be∣fore his Country and in a Sort a Parent of it  The Prisoner knew that tho' his Spirit was bro∣ken with Guilt and incapable of Language to defend it self all would be gathered from him which could conduce to his Safety and that his Judge would wrest no Law to destroy him nor conceal any that could save him In his Time there were a Nest of Pretenders to Justice who happen'd to be employed to put Things in a Me∣thod for being examined before him at his usual Sessions These Animals were to  Verus  as Mon∣keys are to Men so like that you can hardly disown them but so base that you are ashamed of their Fraternity It grew a Phrase  Who would do Justice on the Justices  That certainly would  Verus  I have seen an old Trial where he sate Judge on Two of 'em one was called  TrickTrack  the other  Tearshift  one was a learned Judge of Sharpers the other the quickest of all Men at finding out a Wench  TrickTrack  never spared a Pickpocket but was a Companion to Cheats  Tearshift  would make Compliments to Wenches of Quality but certainly commit poor ones If a poor Rogue wanted a Lodging  TrickTrack  sent him to Gaol for a Thief If a poor Whore went only with one thin Petticoat  Tear∣shift  would imprison her for being loose in her Dress These Patriots infested the Days of  Ve∣rus  while they alternately committed and relea∣sed each others Prisoners But  Verus  regarded them as Criminals and always look'd upon Men as they stood in the Eye of Justice without re∣specting whether they sate on the Bench or stood at the Bar  Will's Coffeehouse  May  Yesterday we were entertained with the Tra∣gedy of  The Earl of Essex  in which there is not one good Line and yet a Play which was never seen without drawing Tears from some Part of the Audience A remarkable Instance that the  Soul is not to be moved by Words but Things for the Incidents in this  Drama  are laid together so happily that the Spectator makes the Play for himself by the Force which the Circumstance has upon his Imagination Thus in spight of the most dry Discourses and Expressions almost ri∣diculous with respect to Propriety it is impos∣sible for one unprejudic'd to see it untouch'd with Pity I must confess this Effect is not wrought on such as examine why they are pleased but it never fails to appear on those who are not too learned in Nature to be moved by her first Suggestions It is certain the Per∣son and Behaviour of Mr  Wilks  has no small Share in conducing to the Popularity of the Play and when an handsome Fellow is going to a more course  Exit  than Beheading his Shape and Countenance makes every tender one re∣prieve him with all her Heart without waiting till she hears his dying Words  This Evening  The Alchymist  was played This Comedy is an Example of  Ben  's extensive Ge∣nius and Penerration into the Passions and Fol∣lies of Mankind The Scene in the Fourth Act where all the cheated People oppose the Man that would open their Eyes has something in it so inimitably excellent that it is certainly as great a Masterpiece as has ever appeared by any Hand The Author's great Address in showing Covetousness the Motive of the Actions of the  Puritan  the  Epicure  the  Gamester  and the  Tra∣der  that all their Endeavours how differently soever they seem to tend center only in that one Point of Gain shows he had to a great Perfection that Discernment of Spirit which constitutes a Genius for Comedy  White's Chocolatehouse  May  It is not to be imagined how far the Violence of our Desires will carry us towards our own  Deceit in the Pursuit of what we wish for A Gentleman here this Evening was giving me an Account of a dumb FortuneTeller who out∣does Mr  Partridge  my self or the UnbornDoctor for Predictions All his Visitants come to him full of Expectations and pay his own Rate for the Interpretations they put upon his Shrugs and Nods There is a fine rich CityWidow stole thither the other Day though it is not Six Weeks since her Husband's Departure from her Company to rest and with her trusty Maid demanded of him Whether she should marry again by holding up Two Fingers like Horns on her Forehead The Wizard held up both her Hands forked The Relict desired to know Whether he meant by his holding up both Hands to represent that she had one Hus∣band before and that she should have another Or that he intimated she should have Two more The Cunning Man look'd a little sour upon which  Betty  jogged her Mistress who gave t'other Guinea and he made her understand She should positively have Two more but sha∣ked his Head and hinted that they should not live long with her The Widow sighed and gave him t'other half Guinea After this Prepos∣session all that she had next to do was to make Sallies to our End of the Town and find out who it is her Fate to have There are Two who frequent this Place whom she takes for Men of Vogue and of whom her Imagination has given her the Choice They are both the Appearances of fine Gentlemen to such as do not know when they see Persons of that Turn and indeed they are industrious enough to come at that Chara∣cter to deserve the Reputation of being such But this Town will not allow us to be the Thing we seem to aim at and are too discerning to be fobb'd off with Pretences One of these pretty  Fellows fails by his laborious Exactness the o∣ther by his as much studied Negligence  Frank Careless  as soon as his Valet has helped on and adjusted his Clothes goes to his Glass sets his Wig awry tumbles his Cravat and in short undresses himself to go into Company  Will Nice  is so little satisfied with his Dress that all the Time he is at a Visit he is still mending it and is for that Reason the more insufferable for he who studies Carelesness has at least his Work the sooner done of the Two The Widow is distracted whom to take for her first Man for  Nice  is every Way so careful that she fears his Length of Days and  Frank  is so loose that she has Apprehensions for her own Health with him I am puzzled how to give a just Idea of them but in a Word  Careless  is a Cox∣comb and  Nice  a Fop Both you'll say very hopeful Candidates for a gay Woman just set at Liberty But there is a Whisper her Maid will give her to  Tom Terrour  the Gamester This Fel∣low has undone so many Women that he'll cer∣tainly succeed if he is introduced for nothing so much prevails with the vain Part of that Sex as the Glory of deceiving them who have de∣ceived others  Desunt Multa  St James's Coffeehouse  May  Letters from  Berlin  bearing Date  May    N S  inform us That the BirthDay of her  Prussian  Majesty has been celebrated there with all possi∣ble Magnificence and the King made her on that Occasion a present of Jewels to the Value of Thirty Thousand Crowns The Marquis  de Quesne  who has distinguished himself by his great Zeal for the Protestant Interest was at the Time of the Dispatch of these Letters at that Court soliciting the King to take Care  that an Article in Behalf of the Refugees ad∣mitting their Return to  France  should be inser∣ted in the Treaty of Peace They write from  Hanover  of the th That his Electoral High∣ness had received an Express from

Imperial Army into the Field There are very many Speculations upon the intended In∣terview of the King of  Denmark  and King  Au∣gustus  The latter has made such Preparations for the Reception of the other that it is said his  Danish  Majesty will be entertained in  Saxony  with much more Elegance than he met with in  Italy  it self  Letters from the  Hague  of the th Instant  N S  say That his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  landed the Night before at the  Brill  after ha∣ving been kept out at Sea by adverse Winds two Days longer than is usual in that Passage His Excellency the Lord  Townshend  Her Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the StateGeneral was driven into the  Veer  in  Zealand  on  Thursday  last from whence he came to the  Hague  within few Hours after the Arrival of his Grace The Duke soon after his coming to the  Hague  had a Visit from the Pen∣sioner of  Holland  All Things relating to the Peace were in Suspence till this Interview nor is it yet known what Resolutions will be taken on that Subject for the Troops of the Allies have fresh Orders dispatched to them to move from their respective Quarters and march with all Expedition to the Frontiers where the Ene∣my are making their utmost Efforts for the De∣fence of their Country These Advices further inform us That the Marquis  de Torcy  had re∣ceived  an Answer from the Court of  France  to his Letters which he had sent thither by an Ex∣press on the  Friday  before  Mr  Bickerstaff  has received Letters from Mr  Coltstaff  Mr  Whipstaff  and Mrs  Rebecca Wagstaff  all which relate chiefly to their being left out in the Genealogy of the Family lately pub∣lished but my Cousin being a Clerk in the  Herald's Office  who writ that Draught and being at pre∣sent under the Displeasure of the Chapter it is feared if that Matter should be touched upon at this Time the young Gentleman would lose his Place for Treason against the Kings at Arms  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd May  to  Saturd May    From my own Apartment  May  I Have taken a Resolution hereafter on any Want of Intelligence to carry my Familiar abroad with me who has promised to give me very proper and just Notices of Persons and Things to make up the History of the passing Day He is wonderfully skilful in the Know∣ledge of Men and Manners which has made me more than ordinary curious to know how he came to that Perfection and I communicated to him that Doubt Mr  Pacolet  said I I am migh∣tily surpriz'd to see you so good a Judge of our Nature and Circumstances since you are a meer Spirit and have no Knowledge of the Bodily Parts of us He answered smiling You are mi∣staken I have been one of you and lived a Month amongst you which gives me an exact Sense of your Condition You are to know That all who enter into Humane Life have a certain Date or  Stamen  given to their Being  which they only who die of Age may be said to have arrived at but it is ordered sometimes by Fate that such as die Infants are after Death to attend Mankind to the End of that  Stamen  of Being in themselves which was broke off by Sickness or any other Disafter These are proper Guardians to Men as being insensible of the Infirmity of their State You are Philosopher enough to know that the Difference of Men's Understanding proceeds only from the various Dispositions of their Organs so that he who dies at a Month old is in the next Life as knowing tho' more innocent as they who live to Fifty and after Death they have as perfect a Memory and Judgment of all that pass'd in their Lifetime as I have of all the Revolutions in that uneasie turbulent Condition of yours and you'd say I had enough of it in a Month were I to tell you all my Misfortunes A Life of a Month can't have one would think much Variety but pray said I let us have your Story  Then he proceeds in the following Manner  It was one of the most wealthy Families in  Great Britain  into which I was born and it was a very great Happiness to me that it so hap∣pen'd otherwise I had still in all Probability been living But I shall recount to you all the Occurrences of my short and miserable Existence just as by examining into the Traces made in my Brain they appeared to me at that Time The first Thing that ever struck my Senses was a Noise over my Head of one shrieking after which methought I took a full Jump and found my self in the Hands of a Sorceress who seem'd as if she had been long waking and em∣ployed in some Incantation I was throughly frightned and cried out but she immediately seem'd to go on in some Magical Operation and  anointed me from Head to Foot What they meant I could not imagine for there gather'd a great Crowd about me crying  An Heir an Heir  upon which I grew a little still and be∣lieved this was a Ceremony to be used only to great Persons and such as made them what they call'd  Heirs  I lay very quiet but the Witch for no Manner of Reason or Provocation in the World takes me and binds my Head as hard as possibly she could then ties up both my Legs and makes me swallow down an horrid Mixture I thought it an harsh Entrance into Life to begin with taking Physick but I was forced to it or else must have taken down a great Instrument in which she gave it me When I was thus dressed I was carried to a Bedside where a fine young Lady my Mother I wot had like to have hugg'd me to Death From her they faced me about and there was a Thing with quite another Look from the rest of the Room to whom they talk'd about my Nose He seem'd wonderfully pleas'd to see me but I knew since my Nose belong'd to another Fa∣mily That into which I was born is one of the most numerous amongst you therefore Crowds of Relations came every Day to congra∣tulate my Arrival among others my Cousin  Betty  the greatest Romp in Nature She whisks me such a Height over her Head that I cry'd out for fear of falling She pinch'd me and called me squealing Chit and threw me into a Girls Arms that was taken in to tend me The Girl was very proud of the Womanly Employ∣ment of a Nurse and took upon her to strip and dress me anew because I made a Noise to see what ailed me She did so and stuck a Pin in every Joint about me I still cri∣ed Upon which she lays me on my Face in her Lap and to quiet me fell a nailing in all  the Pins by clapping me on the Back and skreaming a Lullaby But my Pain made me exalt my Voice above hers which brought up the Nurse the Witch I first saw and my Grandmother The Girl is turn'd down Stairs and I stripp'd again as well to find what ail'd me as to satisfy my Granam's further Curiosi∣ty This good old Woman's Visit was the Cause of all my Troubles You are to understand That I was hitherto bred by Hand and any Body that stood next gave me Pap if I did but open my Lips insomuch that I was grown so cunning as to pretend my self asleep when I was not to prevent my being cramm'd But my Grandmother began a loud Lecture upon the Idleness of the Wives of this Age who for Fear of their Shapes forbear suckling their own Off∣spring And Ten Nurses were immediately sent for one was whisper'd to have a wanton Eye and would soon spoil her Milk another was in a Consumption the Third had an ill Voice and would frighten me instead of lulling me to sleep Such Exceptions were made against all but one Country MilchWench to whom I was committed and put to the Breast This care∣less Jade was eternally romping with the Foot∣men and downright starved me insomuch that I daily pined away and should never have been reliev'd had it not been that on the Thirtieth Day of my Life a Fellow of the  Royal Society  who had writ upon  Cold Baths  came to visit me and solemnly protested I was utterly lost for want of that Method Upon which he sous'd me Head and Ears into a Pail of Water where I had the good Fortune to be drowned and so escap'd be∣ing lash'd into a Linguist till Sixteen running after Wenches till Twenty five and being mar∣ried to an ill natured Wife till Sixty Which had certainly been my Fate had not the Inchant∣ment  between Body and Soul been broke by this Philosopher Thus till the Age I should have otherwise liv'd I am oblig'd to watch the Steps of Men and if you please shall accompany you in your present Walks and get you Intelligence from the Aerial Lacquey who is in Waiting what are the Thoughts and Purposes of any whom you enquire for I accepted his kind Offer and immediately took him with me in an Hack to  White  's  White's Chocolatehouse  May  We got in hither and my Companion threw a Powder round us that made me as invisi∣ble as himself so that we could see and hear all others our selves unseen and un∣heard  The first Thing we took Notice of was a Nobleman of a goodly and frank Aspect with his generous Birth and Temper visible in it playing at Cards with a Creature of a black and horrid Countenance wherein were plainly de∣lineated the Arts of his Mind Cousenage and Falshood They were marking their Game with Counters on which we could see Inscriptions imperceptible to any but us My Lord had scor'd with Pieces of Ivory on which were writ  Good Fame Glory Riches Honour and Po∣sterity  The Spectre overagainst him had on his Counters the Inscriptions of  Dishonour Impu∣dence Poverty Ignorance and Want of Shame  Bless me said I Sure my Lord does not see what he plays for As well as I do says  Pacolet  He despises that Fellow he plays with and scorns himself for making him his Companion At the very Instant he was speaking I saw the Fellow who play'd with my Lord hide Two Cards in the Roll of his Stocking  Pacolet  immediately stole 'em from thence upon which the Noble∣man  soon after won the Game The little Tri∣umph he appeared in when he got such a tri∣  ing Stock of ready Money tho' he had ven∣tured so great Sums with Indifference increas'd my Admiration But  Pacolet  began to talk to me Mr  Isaac  This to you looks wonderful but not at all to us higher Beings That Noble has as many good Qualities as any Man of his Order and seems to have no Faults but what as I may say are Excrescencies from Virtues He is Generous to a Prodigality more Affable than is consistent with his Quality and Coura∣gious to a Rashness Yet after all this the Source of his whole Conduct is tho' he would hate himself if he knew it meer Avarice The Ready Cash laid before the Gamester's Counters makes him venture as you see and lay Distin∣ction against Infamy Abundance against Want in a Word all that's desirable against all that's to be avoided However said I be sure you dis∣appoint the Sharpers to Night and steal from 'em all the Cards they hide  Pacolet  obey'd me and my Lord went Home with their whole Bank in his Pocket  Will's Coffeehouse  May  To Night was acted a Second Time a Come∣dy call'd  The Busie Body  This Play is written by a Lady In old Times we us'd to sit upon a Play here after it was acted but now the En∣tertainment is turn'd another Way not but there are considerable Men appear in all Ages who for some eminent Quality or Invention deserve the Esteem and Thanks of the Publick Such a Be∣nefector is a Gentleman of this House who is observed by the Surgeons with much Envy for he has invented an Engine for the Prevention of Harms by LoveAdventures and by great Care and Application hath made it an Immodesty to name his Name This Act of Selfdenial has  gain'd this worthy Member of the Common¦wealth a great Reputation Some Lawgiver  have departed from their Abodes for ever an  commanded the Observation of their Laws til  their Return others have used other Artifice  to fly the Applause of their Merit but this Per∣son shuns Glory with greater Address and has by giving his Engine his own Name made it obscene to speak of him more However he is rank'd among and receiv'd by the modern Wits as a great Promoter of Gallantry and Pleasure But I fear Pleasure is less under∣stood in this Age which so much pretends to it than in any since the Creation 'Twas ad∣mirably said of him who first took Notice That  Res est severa Voluptas  there is a certain Seve∣rity in Pleasure Without that all Decency is banished and if Reason is not to be present at our greatest Satisfactions of all the Races of Creatures the Humane is the most miserable It was not so of old when  Virgil  describes a Wit he always means a virtuous Man and all his Sentiments of Men of Genius are such as show Persons distinguished from the common Level of Mankind such as placed Happiness in the Contempt of low Fears and mean Gratifi∣cations Fears which we are subject to with the Vulgar and Pleasures which we have in common with Beasts With these illustrious Personages the wisest Man was the greatest Wit and none was thought worthy of that Character unless he answered this excellent Description of the Poet  Qui Metus omnes inexorabile Fatum  Subjecit Pedibus strepitum{que}  Acherontis  avari  St James's Coffeehouse  May  We had this Morning Advice That some  Eng∣lish  Merchant Ships convoyed by the  Bristol  of Guns were met with by a Part of Mons  du  Gui Trouin  's Squadron who engaged the Con∣voy That Ship defended it self till the  English  Merchants got clear of the Enemy but being disabled was her self taken Within few Hours after my Lord  Dursley  came up with Part of his Squadron and engaging the  French  retook the  Bristol  which being very much shattered sunk and took the  Glorieux  a Ship of Guns as al∣so a Privateer of Before this Action his Lordship had taken Two  French  Merchant Men and had at the Dispatch of these Advices brought the whose safe into  Plimouth  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd May  to  Tuesd May    White's Chocolatehouse  May  SIR  Thomas  of this House has show'd me some Letters from the  Bath  which give Accounts of what passes among the good Com∣pany of that Place and allow'd me to tran∣scribe one of them that seems to be writ by some of Sir  Thomas  's particular Acquaintance and is as follows  Dear Knight  I Desire you would give my humble Service to all our Friends which I speak of to you out of Method in the very Beginning of my Epi∣stle lest the present Disorders by which this Seat of Gallantry and Pleasure is torn to Pieces should make me forget it You keep so good Company that you know  Bath  is stock'd with such as come hither to be relieved from luxuri∣ant Health or imaginary Sickness and conse∣quently is always as well stowed with Gallants as Invalids who live together in a very good  Understanding But the Season is so early that our fine Company is not yet arrived and the Warm Bath which in Heathen Times was dedi∣cated to  Venus  is now used only by such as really want it for Health's Sake There are however a good many Strangers among whom are Two ambitious Ladies who being both in the Au∣tumn of their Life take the Opportunity of placing themselves at the Head of such as we are before the  Chloe's Clarissa's  and  Pastorella's  come down One of these Two is excessively in Pain that the ugly Being called  Time  will make Wrinkles in Spite of the Lead ForeheadCloth and therefore hides with the Gaiery of her Air the Volubility of her Tongue and Quickness of her Motion the Injuries which it has done her The other Lady is but Two Years behind her in Life and dreads as much being laid aside as the former and consequent∣ly has taken the necessary Precautions to pre∣vent her Reign over us But she is very dis∣creet and wonderfully turned for Ambition being never apparently transported either with Affectation or Malice Thus while  Florimel  is talking in Publick and spreading her Graces in Assemblies to gain a Popular Dominion over our Diversions  Prudentia  visits very cunningly all the Lame the Splenatick and the Superan∣nuated who have their distinct Classes of Fol∣lowers and Friends Among these she has found that some Body has sent down printed Certificates of  Florimel  's Age which she has read and distributed to this unjoyful Set of Peo∣ple who are always Enemies to those in Pos∣session of the good Opinion of the Company This unprovoked Injury done by  Prudentia  was the first Occasion of our fatal Divisions here and a Declaration of War between these Rivals  Florimel  has abundance of Wit which she has  lavish'd in decrying  Prudentia  and giving De∣fiance to her little Arts For an Instance of her superior Power she bespoke the Play of  Alex∣ander the Great  to be acted by the Company of Strollers and desired us all to be there on  Thursday  last When she spoke to me to come  As you are  said she  a Lover you will not fail the Death of  Alexander  The Passion of Love is wonderfully hit  Statira  Oh that happy WomanTo have a Conqueror at her FeetBut you'll be sure to be there  I and several others resolv'd to be of her Party But see the irresistible Strength of that unsuspected Crea∣ture a  Silent Woman Prudentia  had counter∣plotted us and had bespoke on the same Even∣ing the PopperShow of  The Creation of the World  She had engaged every Body to be there and to turn our Leader into Ridicule had secretly let 'em know that the Poppet  Eve  was made the most like  Florimel  that ever was seen On  Thursday  Morning the  PoppetDrum∣mer Adam  and  Eve  and several others who lived before the Flood pass'd thro' the Streets on Horseback to invite us all to the Pastime and the Representation of such Things as we all knew to be true and Mr Mayor was so wise as to prefer these innocent People the Pop∣pets who he said were to represent Christians before the wicked Players who were to show  Alexander  an Heathen Philosopher To be short this  Prudentia  had so laid it that at Ten of the Clock Footmen were sent to take Places at the PoppetShow and all we of  Florimel  's Party were to be out of Fashion or desert her We chose the latter All the World crowded to  Prudentia  's House because it was given out no Body could get in When we came to  Noah  's Flood in the Show  Punch  and his Wife were introduced dan∣cing in the Ark An honest plain Friend of  Flori∣mel  's  but a Critick withal rose up in the midst of the Representation and made many very good Exceptions to the  Drama  it self and told us That it was against all Morality as well as Rules of the Stage that  Punch  should be in Jest in the De∣luge or indeed that he should appear at all This was certainly a just Remark and I thought to second him but he was hiss'd by  Prudentia  's Party upon which really Sir  Thomas  we who were his Friends hiss'd him too Old Mrs  Petulent  desired both her Daughters to mind the Moral then whispered Mrs Mayo∣ress  This is very proper for young People to see Punch  at the End of the Play made Madam  Prudentia  a Compliment and was very civil to the whole Company making Bows till his Buttons touch'd the Ground All was carried triumphantly against our Party In the mean Time  Florimel  went to the Tragedy dress'd as fine as Hands could make her in Hopes to see  Prudentia  pine away with Envy Instead of that she sate a full Hour alone and at last was entertain'd with this whole Relation from  Stati∣ra  who wiped her Eyes with her Tragical cut Handkerchief and lamented the Ignorance of the Quality  Florimel  was stung with this Af∣front and the next Day bespoke the PoppetShow  Prudentia  insolent with Power be∣spoke  Alexander  The whole Company came then to  Alexander  Madam  Petulant  desired her Daughters to mind the Moral and believe no Man's fair Words  For you'll see Children  said she  these Soldiers are never to be depended upon they are sometimes here sometimes thereDon't you see Daughter  Betty  Colonel  Clod  our next Neighbour in the Country pulls off his Hat to you Court'sie good Child his Estate is just by us Florimel  was now mortified down to  Prudentia  's Humour and  Prudentia  exalted in∣to  hers This was observed  Florimel  invites us to the Play a Second Time  Prudentia  to the Show See the Uncertainty of Humane Affairs The Beaux the Wits the Gamesters the Prues the Coquets the Valitudinarians and Gallants all now wait upon  Florimel  Such is the State of Things at this present Date and if there happens any new Commotions you shall have immediate Advice from  SIR  Your Affectionate Friend and Servant  Bath  May  To CASTABELLA  Madam  I Have the Honour of a Letter from a Friend of yours relating to an Incivility done to you at the Opera by one of your own Sex but I who was an Eyewitness of the Accident can testify to you that tho' she pressed before you she lost her Ends in that Design for she was taken Notice of for no other Reason but her Endeavours to hide a finer Woman than her self But indeed I dare not go further in this Matter than just this bare Mention for though it was taking your Place of Right rather than Place of Precedence yet it is so tender a Point and on which the very Life of Female Am∣bition depends that it is of the last Conse∣quence to meddle in it All my Hopes are from your beautiful Sex and those bright Eyes which are the Bane of others are my only Sun∣shine My Writings are Sacred to you and I hope I shall always have the good Fortune to live under your Protection therefore take this publick Opportunity to signify to all the World That I design to forbear any Thing that may in the least tend to the Diminution of your In∣terest Reputation or Power You'll therefore  forgive me that I strive to conceal every wrong Step made by any who have the Honour to wear Petticoats and shall at all Times do what is in my Power to make all Mankind as much their Slaves as my self If they would consider Things as they ought there needs not much Argument to convince 'em that it is their Fate to be obedient to you and that your greatest Rebels do only serve with a worse Grace I am  MADAM  Your most Obedient and most Humble Servant  Isaac Bickerstaff  May  St James's Coffeehouse  May  Letters from the  Hague  bearing Date the st Instant  N S  advise That his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  immediately after his Ar∣rival sent his Secretary to the President and the Pensionary to acquaint them therewith Soon after these Ministers visited the Duke and made him Compliments in the Name of the StatesGeneral after which they enter'd into a Con∣ference with him on the present Posture of Af∣fairs and gave his Grace Assurances of the firm Adherence of the States to the Alliance At the same Time acquainting him That all Overtures of Peace were rejected till they had an Oppor∣tunity of acting in Concert with their Allies on that Subject After this Interview the Pensio∣nary and the President returned to the Assembly of the States Monsieur  Torcy  has had a Confe∣rence at the Pensioner's House with his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  Prince  Eugene  and his Excellency the Lord  Townshend  The Re∣sult of what was debated at that Time is kept secret but there appears an Air of Satisfaction and good Understanding between these Mini∣sters  We are apt also to give our selves very hopeful Prospects from Monsieur  Torcy  's being employed in this Negotiation who has been al∣ways remarkable for a particular Way of Think∣ing in his Sense of the Greatness of  France  which he has always said  Was to be promoted rather by the Arts of Peace than those of War  His delivering himself freely on this Subject has formerly appeared an unsuccessful Way to Power in that Court but in its present Circumstan∣ces those Maxims are better received and it is thought a certain Argument of the Since∣rity of the  French  King's Intentions that this Minister is at present made use of The Mar∣quis is to return to  Paris  within few Days who has sent a Courier thither to give Notice of the Reasons of his Return that the Court may be the sooner able to dispatch Commissioners for a formal Treaty  The Expectations of Peace are increased by Advices from  Paris  of the th Instant which say The Dauphin hath altered his Resolution of commanding in  Flanders  the ensuing Cam∣paign The  Saxon  and  Prussian  Reinforcements together with Count  Merci  's Regiment of Impe∣rial Horse are encamped in the Neighbourhood of  Brussels  and sufficient Stores of Corn and Forage are transported to that Place and  Ghent  for the Service of the Confederate Army  They write from  Mons  That the Elector of  Bavaria  had Advice That an advanced Party of the  Portugueze  Army had been defeated by the  Spaniards  We hear from  Languedoc  That their Corn Olives and Figs were wholly destroyed but that they have a hopeful Prospect of a plentiful Vintage  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesday May  to  Thursday May    Will's Coffeehouse  May  THE Discourse has happened to turn this Evening upon the true Nature of Panegy∣rick the Perfection of which was asserted to consist in a certain artful Way of conveying the Applause in an indirect Manner There was a Gentleman gave us several Instances of it A∣mong others he quoted from Sir  Francis Ba∣con  in his  Advancement of Learning  a very great Compliment made to  Tiberius  as follows In a full Debate upon Publick Affairs in the Se∣nate one of the Assembly rose up and with a very grave Air said He thought it for the Ho∣nour and Dignity of the Commonwealth that  Tiberius  should be declared a God and have Di∣vine Worship paid him The Emperor was surprized at the Proposal and demanded of him to declare whether he had made any Ap∣plication to incline him to that Overture The Senator answered with a bold and haughty Tone  Sir In Matters that concern the Common∣wealth I will be governed by no Man  Another Gentleman mentioned something of the same Kind spoken by the late Duke of  Bm  to the late Earl of  Oy My Lord  says the Duke after his Libertine Way  you will certain∣ly be Damn'd How my Lord  says the Earl with some Warmth  Nay  says the Duke  there's no Help for it for it is positively said Cursed is he of whom all Men speak well  This is taking a Man by Surprize and being welcome when you have so surprized him The Person flattered receives you into his Closet at once and the  sudden Change in his Heart from the Ex∣pectation of an Illwisher to find you his Friend makes you in his full Favour in a Mo∣ment The Spirits that were raised so sudden∣ly against you are as suddenly for you There was another Instance given of this Kind at the Table A Gentleman who had a very great Favour done him and an Employment bestow∣ed upon him without so much as being known to his Benefactor waited upon the Great Man who was so Generous and was beginning to say he was infinitely obliged  Not at all  says the Patron turning from him to another  Had I known a more deserving Man in  England  he should not have had it  We should certainly have had more Exam∣ples had not a Gentleman produced a Book which he thought an Instance of this kind It was a Pamphlet call'd  The Naked Truth  The Idea any one would have of that Work from the Title was That there would be much Plain Dealing with People in Power and that we should see Things in their proper Light stripped of the Ornaments which are usually given to the Actions of the Great But the Skill of this Author is such that he has under that rugged Appearance approved himself the finest Gentleman and Courtier that ever writ The Language is extremely sublime and not at all to be understood by the Vulgar The Senti∣ments are such as would make no Figure in ordinary Words but such is the Art of the Ex∣pression and the Thoughts are elevated to so high a Degree that I question whether the Dis∣course will sell much There was an illna∣tured Fellow present who hates all Panegy∣rick mortally  P take him  said he  What the Devil means his  Naked Truth  in speaking nothing but to the Advantage of all whom he  mentions This is just such a great Action as that of the Champion's on a Coronation Day who chal∣lenges all Mankind to dispute with him the Right of the Sovereign surrounded with his Guards  The Gentleman who produced the Treatise desired him to be cautious and said it was writ by an excellent Soldier which made the Company observe it more narrowly And as Criticks are the greatest Conjurers at finding out a known  Truth  one said he was sure it was writ by the Hand of his SwordArm I could not perceive much wit in that Expressi∣on but it rais'd a Laugh and I suppose was meant as a Sneer upon valiant Men The same Man pretended to see in the Style that it was an HorseOfficer but sure that's being too nice For though you may know Officers of the Cavalry by the Turn of their  Feet  I can't ima∣gine how you should discern their  Hands  from those of other Men But it is always thus with Pedants they will ever be carping if a Gen∣tleman or a Man of Honour puts Pen to Paper  I don't doubt but this Author will find this Assertion too true and that Obloquy is not re∣pulsed by the Force of Arms I will therefore set this Excellent Piece in a Light too glaring for weak Eyes and in Imitation of the Cri∣tick  Longinus  shall as well as I can make my Observations in a Style like the Author's of whom I treat which perhaps I am as capable of as another having  an unbounded Force of Thinking as well as a most exquisite Address extensively and wisely indulged to me by the su¦preme Powers  My Author I will dare to assert shows the most Universal Knowledge of any Writer who has appeared this Century He is a Poet and Merchant which is seen in Two MasterWords  Credit Blossoms  He is a G  am¦marian and a Politician for he says  The Uni¦ting  the Two Kingdoms is the Emphasis of the Se∣curity to the Protestants Succession  Some would be apt to say he is a Conjurer for he has found That a Republick is not made up of every Body of Animals but is composed of Men only and not of Horses  Liberty and Property have chosen their Retreat within the Emulation Circle of an Humane Commonwealth  He is a Physician for he says  I observe a constant Equality in its Pulse and a just Quickness of its vigorous Circu∣lation  And again  I view the Strength of our Constitution plainly appear in the Sanguine and ruddy Complexion of a wellcontented City  He is a Divine For he says  I cannot but bless my self  And indeed this Excellent Treatise has had that good Effect upon me who am far from being Superstitious that  I  also  can't but bless my self  St James's Coffeehouse  May  This Day arrived a Mail from  Lisbon  with Letters of the th Instant  N S  containing a particular Account of the late Action in  Portu∣gal  On the th Instant the Army of  Portu∣gal  under the Command of the Marquis  de Frontera  lay on the Side of the  Caya  and the Army of the Duke of  Anjou  commanded by the Marquis  de Bay  on the other The latter Commander having an Ambition to ravage the Country in a Manner in Sight of the  Portu∣gueze  made a Motion with the whole Body f his Horse toward Fort St  Christopher  near the Town of  Badajos  The Generals of the  Portu∣gueze  disdaining that such an Insult should be offered to their Arms took a Resolution to pass the River and oppose the Designs of the Ene∣my The Earl of  Galway  epresented to them That the present Postu  e of Affairs wa such on the Side of the Allies that there needed no more to be done at present in that Country  but to carry on a Defensive Part But his Ar∣guments could not avail in the Council of War Upon which a great Detachment of Foot and the whole of the Horse of the King of  Portu∣gal  's Army passed the River and with some Pieces of Cannon did good Execution on the Enemy Upon observing this the Marquis  de Bay  advanced with his Horse and attacked the Right Wing of the  Portugueze  Cavalry who faced about and fled without standing the first Encounter But their Foot repulsed the same Body of Horse in three successive Charges with great Order and Resolution While this was transacting the  British  General com∣manded the Brigade of  Pearce  to keep the Enemy in Diversion by a new Attack This was so well executed that the  Portugueze  In∣fantry had Time to retire in good Order and repass the River But that Brigade which rescued 'em was it self surrounded by the Ene∣my and MajorGeneral  Sarkey  Brigadier  Pearce  together with both their Regiments and that of the Lord  Galway  lately raised were taken Prisoners  During the Engagement the Earl of  Barry∣more  having advanced too far to give some ne∣cessary Order was hemmed in by a Squadron of the Enemy but found Means to gallop up to the Brigade of  Pearce  with which he remains also a Prisoner My Lord  Galway  had his Horse shot under him in this Action and the Conde  de St Juan  a  Portugueze  General was taken Prisoner The same Night the Army encamped at  Aronches  and on the th moved to  Elvas  where they lay when these Dis∣patches came away Colonel  Stanwix  's Regi∣ment is also taken The whole of this Affair has given the  Portugueze  a great Idea of the Capacity and Courage of my Lord  Galway  a∣gainst  whose Advice they entered upon this un∣fortunate Affair and by whose Conduct they were rescued from it The prodigious Con∣stancy and Resolution of that great Man is hard∣ly to be parallel'd who under the Oppression of a maimed Body and the Reflection of repeated ill Fortune goes on with an unspeak∣able Alacrity in the Service of the Common Cause He has already put Things in a very good Posture after this ill Accident and made the necessary Dispositions for covering the Coun∣try from any further Attempt of the Enemy who lie still in the Camp they were in before the Battle  Letters from  Brussels  dated the th Instant advise That notwithstanding the Negotiations of a Peace seem so far advanced that some do confidently report the Preliminaries of a Treaty to be actually agreed on yet the Allies hasten their Preparations for opening the Campaign and the Forces of the Empire the  Prussians  the  Danes  the  Wirtembergers  the  Palatines  and  Saxon  Auxiliaries are in Motion towards the General Rendevous they being already ar∣rived in the Neighbourhood of  Brussels  These Advices add That the Deputies of the States of  Holland  having made a General Review of the Troops in  Flanders  set out for  Antwerp  on the st Instant from that Place On the same Day the Prince Royal of  Prussia  came thither  incognito  with a Design to make the ensuing Campaign under his Grace the Duke of  Marl∣borough  This Day is published a Treatise call'd  The Difference between Scandal and Admonition  By  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  And on the st of  July

From  Thursd May  to  Saturd May    From my own Apartment  May  IT is observed too often that Men of Wit do so much employ their Thoughts upon fine Speculations that Things useful to Mankind are wholly neglected and they are busy in making Emendations upon some Encliticks in a  Greek  Author while obvious Things that e∣very Man may have use for are wholly overlooked It would be an happy Thing if such as have real Capacities for Pub∣lick Service were employed in Works of general Use but because a Thing is every Body's Business it is no Body's Business This is for Want of publick Spirit As for my Part who am only a Student and a Man of no great Interest I can only remark Things and recommend the Correction of 'em to high∣er Powers There is an Offence I have a Thou∣sand Times lamented but fear I shall never see remedi d which is That in a Nation where Learning is so frequent as in  Great Britain  there should be so many gross Errors as there are in the very Directions of Things wherein Accuracy is necessary so the Conduct of Life This is notoriously observed by all Men of Letters when they first come to Town at  which Time they are usually curious that Way in the Inscriptions on SignPosts I have Cause to know this Matter as well as any Body for I have when I went to MerchantTaylor's School suffered Stripes for spelling after the Signs I observed in my Way tho' at the same Time I must confess staring at those Inscrip∣tions first gave me an Idea and Curiosity for Medals in which I have since arrived at some Knowledge Many a Man has lost his Way and his Dinner by this general Want of Skill in Orthography For considering that the Painters are usually so very bad that you can∣not know the Animal under whose Sign you are to live that Day How must the Stranger be missed if it be wrong spelled as well as ill painted I have a Cousin now in Town who has answered under  Batchellor  at  Queen  's College whose Name is  Humphrey Mopstaff  He is a Kin to us by his Mother This young Man going to see a Relation in  Barbekin  wan∣dered a whole Day by the Mistake of one Let∣ter for it was written  This is the BEER  instead of  This is the BEAR  He was set right at last by enquiring for the House of a Fellow who could not read and knew the Place mechanically only by having been often drunk there But in the Name of Goodness let us make our Learning of Use to us or not Was not this a Shame that a Philosopher should be thus directed by a Cobler I'll be sworn if it were known how many have suffered in this Kind by false Speeling since the Union this Matter would not long lie thus What makes these Evils the more insupporta∣ble is That they are so easily amended and nothing done in it But it is so far from that that the Evil goes on in other Arts as well as Orthography Places are confounded as well  for want of proper Distinctions as Things for Want of true Characters Had I not come by the other Day very early in the Morning there might have been Mischief done for a worthy  NorthBritain  was swearing at  Stocksmarket  that they would not let him in at his Ludg∣ings but I knowing the Gentleman and ob∣serving him look often at the King on Horse∣back and then double his Oaths that he was sure he was right found he mistook that for  CharingCross  by the Erection of the like Sta∣tue in each Place I grant private Men may distinguish their Abodes as they please as one of my Acquaintance who lives at  Marybone  has put a good Sentence of his own Invention upon his Dwellingplace to find out where he lives He is so near  London  that his Conceit is this  The Country in Town  or  The Town in the Coun∣try  for you know if they are both in one they are all one Besides that the Ambiguity is not of great Consequence if you are safe at the Place 'tis no Matter if you do not distinctly know where to say the Place is But to return to the Orthography of Publick Places I pro∣pose That every Tradesman in the Cities of  London  and  Westminster  shall give me Sixpence a Quarter for keeping their Signs in Repair as to the Grammatical Part and I will take into my House a  Swiss  Count of my Acquain∣tance who can remember all their Names without Book for Dispatch sake setting up the Head of the said Foreigner for my Sign the Features being strong and fit for hanging high  St James's Coffeehouse  May  This Day a Mail arrived from  Holland  by which there are Advices from  Paris  That the Kingdom of  France  is in the utmost Misery and Distraction The Merchants of  Lions  have been  at Court to remonstrate their great Sufferings by the Failure of their Publick Credit but have received no other Satisfaction than Pro∣mises of a sudden Peace and that their Debts will be made good by Funds out of the Re∣venue which will not answer but in case of the Peace which is promised In the mean Time the Cries of the common People are loud for Want of Bread the Gentry have lost all Spirit and Zeal for their Country and the King himself seems to languish under the An∣xiety of the pressing Calamities of the Nation and retires from hearing those Grievances which he hath not Power to redress Instead of Preparations for War and the Defence of their Country there is nothing to be seen but evident Marks of a general Despair Processi∣ons Fastings Publick Mournings and Humili∣ations are become the sole Employments of a People who were lately the most vain and gay of any in the Universe  The Pope has written to the  French  King on the Subject of a Peace and his Majesty has an∣swered in the lowliest Terms That he entirely submits his Affairs to Divine Providence and shall soon show the World that he prefers the Tranquility of his People to the Glory of his Arms and Extent of his Conquests  Letters from the  Hague  of the th say That his Excellency the Lord  Toxnshend  delivered his Credentials on that Day to the StatesGe∣neral as Plenipotentiary from the Queen of  GreatBritain  as did also Count  Zinzendorf  who bears the same Character from the Em∣peror  Prince  Eugene  intended to set out the next Day for  Brussels  and his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  on the  Tuesday  following The Marquis  de Torcy  talks daily of going but still  continues here The Army of the Allies is to assemble on the th of the next Month at  Hel∣chin  though 'tis generally believed that the Preliminar es to a Treaty are fully adjusted  The Approech of a Peace strikes a Pannick thro' ou Armies tho' that of a Battle could ne∣ver do it and they almost repent of their Bra∣very that made such hast to humble them∣selves and the  French  King The Duke of  Marlborough  tho' otherwise the greatest Gene∣ral of the Age has plainly shown himself un∣acquainted with the Arts of Husbanding a War He might have grown as old as the Duke of  Alva  or Prince  Waldeck  in the  LowCountries  and yet have got Reputation enough every Year for any reasonable Man For the Command of General in  Flanders  hath been ever looked upon as a Provision for Life For my Pa t I can't see how his Grace can answer it to the World for the great Eagerness he hath shown to send a Hundred Thousand of the bravest Fellows in  Europe  a begging But the pr vate Gentlemen of the Infantry will be able to shift for themselves a brave Man can never starve in a Country stock'd with Henroosts  There is not a Yard of Linnen  says my honour∣ed P ogenitor Sir  John Falstaff in my whole Company but as for that  says this worthy Knight  I am in no great Pain we shall find Shirts on every Heage  There is another Sort of Gentlemen whom I am much more concerned for and that is the ingenious Fraternity of which I have the Honour to be an unworthy Member I mean th  NewsWriters of Great Britain  whe∣ther  PostMen  or  PostBoys  or by what other Name or Title soever dignified or distinguished The Case of these Gentlemen is I think more hard than that of the Soldiers considering that they have taken more Towns and fought more  Battels They have been upon Parties and Skirmishes when our Armies have lain still and given the General Assault to many a Place when the Besiegers were quiet in their Trench∣es They have made us Masters of several strong Towns many Weeks before our Generals could do it and compleated Victories when our greatest Captains have been glad to come off with a drawn Battle Where Prince  Eugene  has slain his Thousands  Boyer  has slain his Ten Thousands This Gentleman can indeed be never enough commended for his Courage and Intrepidity during this whole War He has laid about him with an inexpressible Fury and like the offended  Marius  of Ancient  Rome  made such Havock among his Countrymen as must be the Work of Two or Three Ages to re∣pair It must be confess'd the Redoubted Mr  Buckley  has shed as much Blood as the former but I cannot forbear saying and I hope it will not look like Envy that we re∣gard our Brother  Buckley  as a kind of  Drawcan∣sir  who spares neither Friend or Foe But gene∣rally kills as many of his own Side as the Ene∣my's It is impossible for this ingenious Sort of Men to subsist after a Peace Every one re∣members the Shifts they were driven to in the Reign of King  Charles  the Second when they could not furnish out a single Paper of News without lighting up a Comet in  Germany  or a Fire in  Moscow  There scarce appeared a Letter without a Paragraph on an Earthquake Pro∣digies were grown so familiar that they had lost their Name as a great Poet of that Age has it I remember Mr  Dyer  who is justly look'd upon by all the Foxhunters in the Na∣tion as the greatest Statesman our Country has produced was particularly famous for dealing in Whales insomuch that in Five Months Time  for I had the Curiosity to examine his Letters on that Occasion he brought Three into the Mouth of the River  Thames  besides Two Por∣pusses and a Sturgeon The judicious and wary Mr  I Dawks  hath all along been the Rival of this great Writer and got himself a Repu∣tation from Plagues and Famines by which in those Days he destroyed as great Multirudes as he has lately done by the Sword In every Dearth of News  Grand Cairo  was sure to be un∣peopled  It being therefore visible that our Society will be greater Sufferers by the Peace than the Soldiery it self insomuch that the  Daily Cou∣rant  is in Danger of being broken my Friend  Dyer  of being reformed and the very best of the whole Band of being reduced to HalfPay Might I presume to offer any Thing in the Be∣half of my distressed Brethren I would hum∣bly move That an Appendix of proper Apart∣ments furnished with Pen Ink and Paper and other Necessaries of Life should be added to the Hospital of  Chelsea  for the Relief of such de∣cay'd NewsWriters as have serv'd their Coun∣try in the Wars and that for their Exercise they should compile the Annals of their Brother Veterans who have been engaged in the same Service and are still obliged to do Duty after the same Manner  I cannot be thought to speak this out of an Eye to any private Interest for as my chief Scenes of Action are Coffeehouses Playhouses and my own Apartment I am in no need of Camps Fortifications and Fields of Battle to support me I don't call out for Heroes and Generals to my Assistance Though the Of∣ficers are broken and the Armies disbanded I shall still be safe as long as there are Men or Women or Politicians or Lovers or Poets or  Nymphs or Swains or Cits or Courtiers in Being  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd May  to  Tuesd May    From my own Apartment  May  THERE is nothing can give a Man of any Consideration greater Pain than to see Or∣der and Distinction laid aside amongst Men especially when the Rank of which he himself is a Member is intruded upon by such as have no Pretence to that Honour The Appellation of  Esquire  is the most notoriously abused in this Kind of any Class amongst Men insomuch that it is become almost the Subject of Derision but I will be bold to say This Behaviour towards it proceeds from the Ignorance of the People in its true Origine I shall therefore as briefly as pos∣sible do my self and all true  Esquires  the Justice to look into Antiquity upon this Subject  In the First Ages of the World before the Invention of Jointures and Settlements when the noble Passion of Love had Possession of the Hearts of Men and the Fair Sex were not yet cultivated into the merciful Disposition which they have showed in latter Centuries it was natural for Great and Heroick Spirits to retire to Rivulets Woods and Caves to lament their Destiny and the Cruelty of the fair Persons who were deaf to their Lamentations The Hero in this Distress was generally in Armour and in a Readiness to fight any Man he met with especially if distinguished by any extra∣ordinary Qualifications it being the Nature of Heroick Love to hate all Merit lest it should  come within the Observation of the Cruel One by whom its own Perfections are neglected A Lover of this Kind had always about him a Per∣son of a Second Value and subordinate to him who could hear his Afflictions carry an Inchant∣ment for his Wounds hold his Helmet when he was eating if ever he did eat or in his Ab∣sence when he was retired to his Apartment in any King's Palace tell the Prince himself or perhaps his Daughter the Birth Parentage and Adventures of his valiant Master This trusty Companion was styled his  Esquire  and was al∣ways fit for any Offices about him was as gen∣tle and chast as a GentlemanUsher quick and active as an Equerry smooth and eloquent as a Master of the Ceremonies A Man thus qualified was the first as the Ancients affirm who was called an  Esquire  and none without these Accomplishments ought to assume our Or∣der But to the utter Disgrace and Confusion of the Heralds every Pretender is admitted into this Fraternity even Persons the most Foreign to this courteous Institution I have taken an Inventory of all within this City and looked over every Letter in the  PostOffice  for my better Information There are of the  Mid∣dleTemple  including all in the ButteryBooks and in the Lists of the House In the  In∣ner  In the  King's Bench Walks  the whole Buildings are inhabited by Esquires only The adjacent Street of  Essex  from  Morris  's Coffeehouse and the Turning towards the  Graecian  you cannot meet one who is not an Esquire 'till you take Water Every House in  Norfolk  and  Arundel  Streets is gove ned also by a 'Squire or his Lady  SohoSquare BloomsburySquare  and all other Places where the Floors rise above Nine Foot are so many Universities where you enter your selves and become of our Order  However if this were the worst of the Evil it were to be supported because they are generally Men of some Figure and Use though I know no Pretence they have to an Honour which had its Rise from Chivalry But if you travel into the Counties of  Great Britain  we are still more imposed upon by Innovation We are indeed derived from the Field But shall that give Ti∣tle to all that ride mad after Foxes that holloo when they see an Hare or venture their Necks full Speed after an Hawk immediately to com∣mence Esquires No our Order is Temperate Cleanly Sober and Chast but these Rural Esquires commit Immodesties upon Haycocks wear Shirts half a Week and are drunk Twice a Day These Men are also to the last Degree excessive in their Food An Esquire of  Norfolk  eats Two Pounds of Dumplin every Meal as if obliged to it by our Order An Esquire in  Hamp∣shire  is as ravenous in devouring Hogsflesh One of  Essex  has as little Mercy on Calves But I must take the Liberty to protest against them and acquaint those Persons that it is not the Quantity they eat but the Manner of eating that shows a Squire But above all I am most offended at small Quill men and Transcribing Clerks who are all come into our Order for no Reason that I know of but that they can easily flourish it at the End of their Name I'll un∣dertake that if you read the Superscriptions to all the Offices in the Kingdom you will not find Three Letters directed to any but Esquires I have my self a Couple of Clerks and the Rogues make nothing of leaving Messages upon each other's Desk One directs  To Degory Goose∣quill  Esq  to which the other replies by a Note  To Nehemiah Dashwell  Esq  with Respect  In a Word it is now  Populus Armigerorum  A Peo∣ple of Esquires And I don't know but by the  late Act of Naturalization Foreigners will as∣sume that Title as Part of the Immunity of be∣ing  Englishmen  All these Improprieties flow from the Negligence of the  HeraldsOffice  Those Gentlemen in Partycolour'd Habits do not so rightly as they ought understand them∣selves though they are dress'd Capape in Hieroglyphicks they are inwardly but ignorant Men I asked an Acquaintance of mine who is a Man of Wit but of no Fortune and is for∣ced to appear as Jackpudding on the Stage to a Mountebank Prethee  Jack  Why is your Coat of so many Colours He reply'd I act a Fool and this spotted Dress is to signifie that every Man living has a weak Place about him for I am Knight of the Shire and represent you all I wish the Heralds would know as well as this Man does in his Way that they are to act for us in the Case of our Arms and Appellations We should not then be jumbled together in so promiscuous and absurd a Manne I design to take this Matter into fu ther Consideration and no Man shall be received as an Esquire who cannot bring a Certificate That he has con∣quered some Lady's obdurate Heart That he can lead up a Country Dance or carry a Mes∣sage between her and her Lover with Address Secrecy and Diligence A 'Squire is properly born for the Service of the Sex and his Cre∣dentials shall be signed by Three Toasts and One Prude before his Title shall receiv'd in my Office  Will's Coffeehouse  May  On Saturday last was presented  The Busie Bo∣dy  a Comedy written as I have heretofore re∣mark'd by a Woman The Plot and Incidents of the Play are laid with that Subtilty of Spirit which is peculiar to Females of Wit and is very seldom well performed by those of the other  Sex in whom Craft in Love is an Act of Inven∣tion and not as with Women the Effect of Nature and Instinct  To Morrow will be acted a Play call'd  The Trip to the Jubilee  This Performance is the greatest Instance that we can have of the irre∣sistble Force of proper Action The Dialogue in it self has something too low to bear a Criti∣cism upon it But Mr  Wilks  enters into the Part with so much Skill that the Gallantry the Youth and Gaiety of a young Man of a plenti∣ful Fortune is looked upon with as much In∣dulgence on the Stage as in real Life without any of those Intermixtures of Wit and Humour which usually prepossess us in Favour of such Characters in other Plays  St James's Coffeehouse  May  Letters from the  Hague  of the d Instant  N S  say Mr  Walpole  who is since arrived was going with all Expedition to  Great Britain  whither they doubted not but he carried with him the Preliminaries to a Treaty of Peace The  French  Minister Monsieur  Torcy  has been obser∣ved in this whole Negotiation to turn his Dis∣course upon the Calamities sent down by Hea∣ven upon  France  and imputed the Necessities they were under to the immediate Hand of Pro∣vidence in inflicting a general Scarcity of Pro∣vision rather than the superior Genius of the Generals or the Bravery of the Armies against them It would be impious not to acknowledge the Indulgence of Heaven to us but at the same Time as we are to love our Enemies we are glad to see 'em mortified enough to mix Christianity with their Politicks An Authen∣tick Letter from Madam  Maintenon  to Monsieur  Torcy  has been stolen by a Person about him who has communicated a Copy of it to some of the Dependants of a Minister of the Al∣lies  That Epistle is writ in the most Pathetick Manner imaginable and in a Style which shows her Genius that has so long engrossed the Heart of this great Monarch  SIR  I Received yours and am sensible of the Address and Capacity with which you have hitherto transacted the great Affair under your Manage∣ment You well observe that our Wants here are not to be concealed and that it is Vanity to use Artifices with the knowing Men with whom you are to deal Let me beg you therefore in the Re∣presentation of our Circumstances to lay aside Art which ceases to be such when it is seen and make use of all your Skill to gain us what Advan∣tages you can from the Enemy's Jealousie of each other's Greatness which is the Place where only you have Room for any Dexterity If you have any Passion for your unhappy Country or any Af∣fection for your distressed Master come Home with Peace Oh Heaven Do I live to talk of  Lewis the Great  as the Object of  ity The King shews a great Uneasiness to be informed of all that passes but at the same Time is fearful of every one who appears in his Presence lest he should bring an Ac∣count of some new Calamity I know not in what Terms to represent my Thoughts to you when I speak of the King with Relation to his Bodily Health Figure to your self that Immortal Man who stood in our Publick Places represented with Trophies Armour and Terrors on his Pedestal Consider the  Invincible  the  Great  the  Good  the  Pious  the  Mighty  which were the usual Epi∣thets we gave him both in our Language and Thoughts I say consider him whom you knew the most Glorious and Great of Monarchs and now think you see the same Man an unhappy  Lazar  in the lowest Circumstances of Humane Nature it self  without Regard to the State from whence he is fallen I write from his Bedside He is at pre∣sent in a Slumber I have many many Things to add but my Tears flow too fast and my Sor∣row is too big for Utterance  I am  c  There is such a Veneration due from all Men to the Persons of Princes that it were a Sort of Dishonesty to represent further the Condition which the King is in but it is certain That soon after the Receipt of these Advices Mon∣sieur  Torcy  waited upon his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  and the Lord  Townshend  and in that Conference gave up many Points which he had before said were such as he must return to  France  before he could answer  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd May  to  Thursd May    White's Chocolatehouse  May  IT is not to be imagined how far Prepossession will run away with People's Understandings in Cases wherein they are under present Uneasi∣ness The following Narration is a sufficient Testimony of the Truth of this Observation  I had the Honour the other Day of a Visit from a Gentlewoman a Stranger to me who seemed to be about Thirty Her Complexion is Brown but the Air of her Face has an Agree∣ableness which surpasses the Beauties of the Fairest Women There appeared in her Look and Mien a sprightly Health and her Eyes had too much Vivacity to become the Language of Complaint which she began to enter into She seemed sensible of it and therefore with  downcast Looks said she Mr  Bickerstaff  You see before you the unhappiest of Women and therefore as you are esteemed by all the World both a great Civilian as well as an Astrologer I must desire your Advice and Assistance in put∣ting me in a Method of obtaining a Divorce from a Marriage which I know the Law will pronounce void Madam said I your Grie∣vance is of such a Nature that you must be very ingenuous in representing the Causes of your Complaint or I cannot give you the Sa∣tisfaction you desire Sir she answers I be∣lieved there would be no need of half your Skill in the Art of Divination to guess why a Wo∣man would part from her Husband 'Tis true said I but Suspicions or Guesses at what you mean nay Certainty of it except you plainly speak it are no Foundation for a formal Suit She clap'd her Fan before her Face My Hus∣band said she is no more an Husband  here she burst into Tears  than one of the  Italian  Singers  Madam said I the Affliction you complain of is to be redressed by Law but at the same Time consider what Mortifications you are to go through in bringing it into open Court how you will be able to bear the impertinent Whis∣pers of the People present at the Tryal the li∣centious Reflections of the Pleaders and the In∣terpretations that will in general be put upon your Conduct by all the World How little will they say could that Lady command her Passions Besides consider that curbing our Desires is the greatest Glory we can arrive at in this World and will be most rewarded in the next She answered like a prudent Matron Sir if you please to remember the Office of Matrimony the first Cause of its Institution is that of having Posterity Therefore as to the  curbing Desires I am willing to undergo any Abstinence from Food as you please to enjoin me but I cannot with any Quiet of Mind live in the Neglect of a necessary Duty and an express Commandment  Increase and Multi∣ply  Observing she was learned and knew so well the Duties of Life I turned my Ar∣guments rather to dehort her from this Pub∣lick Procedure by Examples than Precepts Do but consider Madam what Crowds of beauteous Women live in Nunneries seclu∣ded for ever from the Sight and Conversa∣tion of Men with all the Alacrity of Spirit imaginable they spend their Time in Hea∣venly Raptures in constant and frequent Devotion and at proper Hours in agreeable Conversations Sir said she hastily Tell not me of Papists or any of their Idolatries Well then Madam consider how many fine Ladies live innocently in the Eye of the World and this gay Town in the midst of Temptation There's the Witty Mrs  W  is a Virgin of Mrs  Ts  is Mrs  Lce  yet you see they laugh and are gay at the Park at the Playhouse at Balls and at Visits and so much at Ease that all this seems hardly a Selfdenial Mr  Bickerstaff  said she with some Emotion you are an excellent Casuist but the last Word destroyed your whole Argument if it is not Selfdenial it is no Virtue I presented you with an HalfGuinea in Hopes not only to have my Conscience eas'd but my Fortune told YetWell Madam said I Pray of what Age is your Husband He is reply'd my in∣jured Client Fifty and I have been his Wife Fifteen Years How happen'd it you never communicated your Distress in all this Time to your Friends and Relations She answered He has been thus but a Fortnight I am the  most serious Man in the World to look at and yet could not forbear laughing out Why Ma∣dam in case of Infirmity which proceeds on∣ly from Age the Law gives no Remedy Sir said she I find you have no more Learning that Dr  Case  and I am told of a young Man not Five and Twenty just come from  Oxford  to whom I will communicate this whole Matter and doubt not but he will appear to have Seven Times more useful and satisfactory Knowledge than you and all your boasted Family Thus I have entirely lost my Client But if this te∣dious Narrative preserves  Pastorella  from the intended Marriage with one Twenty Years her SeniorTo save a Fine Lady I am content∣ed to have my Learning decry'd and my  Predictions  bound up with  Poor Robin  's  Alma∣nacks  Will's Coffeehouse  May  This Evening was acted  The Recruiting Of∣ficer  in which Mr  Estcourt  's proper Sense and Observation is what supports the Play There is not in my humble Opinion the Humour hit in  Serjeant Kite  but it is admirably sup∣ply'd by his Action If I have Skill to judge that Man is an excellent Actor but the Crowd of the Audience are fitter for Representations at  MayFair  than a  TheatreRoyal  Yet that Fair is now broke as well as the  Theatre  is breaking But it is allowed still to sell Animals there Therefore if any Lady or Gentleman have Occasion for a tame Elephant let them enquire of Mr  Penkethman  who has one to dis∣pose of at a reasonable Rate The Downfal of  MayFair  has quite sunk the Price of this noble Creature as well as of many other Curiosities of Nature A Tyger will sell almost as cheap as an Ox and I am credibly informed a Man may purchase a Cat with Three Legs for very  near the Value of one with Four I hear like∣wise That there is a great Desolation among the Gentlemen and Ladies who were the Or∣naments of the Town and used to shine in Plumes and Diadems the Heroes being most of them press'd and the Queens beating Hemp Mrs  Sarabrand  so famous for her ingenious PuppetShow has set up a Shop in the  Exchange  where she sells her little Troop under the Term of JointedBabies I could not but be solici∣tous to know of her how she had disposed of that Rakehell  Punch  whose lewd Life and Conversation had given so much Scandal and did not a little contribute to the Ruin of the Fair She told me with a Sigh That despair∣ing of ever reclaiming him she would not of∣fer to place him in a Civil Family but got him in a Post upon a Stall in  Wapping  where he may be seen from Sunrising to Sunsetting with a Glass in one Hand and a Pipe in the other as Centry to a BrandyShop The great Revolu∣tions of this Nature bring to my Mind the Di∣stresses of the unfortunate  Camilla  who has had the ill Luck to break before her Voice and to disappear at a Time when her Beauty was in the Heighth of its Bloom This Lady enter'd so throughly into the great Characters she act∣ed that when she had finished her Part she could not think of retrenching her Equipage but would appear in her own Lodgings with the same Magnificence that she did upon the Stage This Greatness of Soul has reduced that unhap∣py Princess to an involuntary Retirement where she now passes her Time among the Woods and Forrests thinking on the Crowns and Scepters she has lost and often humming over in her Solitude  I was born of Royal Race  Yet must wander in Disgrace  c  But for Fear of being overheard and he Quality known she usually sings it in  Italian  Naqui al Regno naqui al Trono  E pur sono  Iventurata Pastorella  Since I have touched upon this Subject I shal  communicate to my Reader Part of a Letter  have received from an Ingenious Friend at  Am¦sterdam  where there is a very noble Theatre  though the Manner of furnishing it with Actors is something peculiar to that Place and gives us Occasion to admire both the Politeness and Fru∣gality of the People  MY Friends have kept me here a Week longer than ordinary to see one of their Plays which was performed last Night with great Applause  The Actors are all of them Tradesmen who after their Day's Work is over earn about a Gilder a Night by personating Kings and Generals The Here of the Tragedy I saw was a Journeyman Taylor und his First Minister of State a Coffeeman The Empress made me think of  Parthenope  in the  Rehearsal  for her Mother keeps an Ale∣house in the Suburbs of  Amsterdam  When the Tragedy was over they entertained us with a short Farce in which the Cobler did his Part to a Miracle but upon Enquiry I found he had really been working at his own Trade and representing on the Stage what he acted every Day in his Shop  The Profits of the Theatre maintain an Hospital For as here they do not think the Profession of an Actor the only Trade that a Man ought to exercise  so they will not allow any Body to grow rich on a Profession that in their Opinion so little conduce  to the Good of the Commonwealth If I am no  mistaken your Playhouses in  England  have don  the same Thing for unless I am misinformed  the Hospital at  Dulledge  was erected and endowed by Mr  Allen  a Player And it is also said A famous SheTragedian has settled her Estate after her Death for the Maintenance of decay'd

King shall not only recall his Troops out of that Kingdom and deliver up to the Allies the Towns of  Roses Fonterabia  and  Pampelona  but in case the Duke of  Anjou  shall not retire out of the  Spanish  Dominions he shall be obliged to assist the Allies to force him from thence A Cessation of Arms is agreed upon for Two Months from the first Day of the Treaty The Port and Fortifications of  Dunkirk  are to be demolished within Four Months but the Town it self left in the Hands of the  French  The Pre∣tender is to be obliged to leave  France  All  New∣foundland  is to be restored to the

Thursd May  to  Saturd May    White's Chocolatehouse  May  A Gentleman has writ to me out of the Country a very civil Letter and said Things which I suppress with great Violence to my Vanity There are many Terms in my Nar∣ratives which he complains want explaining and has therefore desired that for the Benefit of my Country Readers I would let him know what I mean by a  Gentleman  a  PrettyFellow  a  Toast  a  Coquet  a  Critick  a  Wit  and all other Appellations of those in the gayer World who are in Possession of these several Characters together with an Account of those who unfortu∣nately pretend to 'em I shall begin with him we usually call a  Gentleman  or Man of Conver∣sation  It is generally thought That Warmth of Ima∣gination quick Relish of Pleasure and a Man∣ner of becoming it are the most essential Quali∣ties for forming this Sort of Man But any one that is much in Company will observe that the Height of good Breeding is shown rather in ne∣ver giving Offence than in doing obliging Things Thus he that never Shocks you tho' he is seldom entertaining is more likely to keep your Favour than he who often entertains and sometimes displeases you The most neces∣sary Talent therefore in a Man of Conversation which is what we ordinarily intend by a Fine Gentleman is a good Judgment He that has this in Perfection is Master of his Companion without letting him see it and has the same Advantage over Men of any other Qualifications whatsoever as one that can see would have over a blind Man of Ten times his Strength  This is what makes  Sophronius  the Darling of all who converse with him and the most Power∣ful with his Acquaintance of any Man in Town By the Light of this Faculty he acts with great Ease and Freedom among the Men of Pleasure and acquits himself with Skill and Dispatch among the Men of Business All which he per∣forms with such Success that with as much Discretion in Life as any Man ever had he neither is nor appears Cunning But as he does a good Office if he ever does it with Readiness and Alacrity so he denies what he does not care to engage in in a Manner that convinces you that you ought not to have asked it His Judgment is so good and unerring and accompanied with so chearful a Spirit that his Conversation is a con∣tinual Feast at which he helps some and is helped by others in such a Manner that the Equality of Society is perfectly kept up and every Man obliges as much as he is obliged For it is the greatest and justest Skill in a Man of Superior Understanding to know how to be on a Level with his Companions This sweet Dis∣position runs through all the Actions of  Sophro∣nius  and make his Company desired by Wo∣men without being envied by Men  Sophro∣nius  would be as just as he is if there were no Law and would be as discreet as he is if there were no such Thing as Calumny  In Imitation of this agreeable Being is made that Animal we call a  Pretty Fellow  who being just able to find out that what makes  Sophro∣nius  acceptable is a Natural Behaviour in or∣der to the same Reputation makes his own an Artificial one  Jack Dimple  is his perfect Mi∣mick whereby he is of Course the most un∣like him of all Men living  Sophronius  just now passed into the inner Room directly forward  Jack  comes as fast after as he can for the Right  and Left Lookingglass in which he had but just approved himself by a Nod at each and marched on He will meditate within for Half an Hour till he thinks he is not careless enough in his Air and come back to the Mirror to re∣collect his Forgetfulness  Will's Coffeehouse  May  This Night was acted the Comedy called  The Fox  but I wonder the Modern Writers do not use their Interest in the House to suppress such Representations A Man that has been at this will ha dly like any other Play during the Sea∣son Therefore I humbly move That the Wri∣tings as well as Dresses of the last Age should give Way to the present Fashion We are come into a good Method enough if we were not in∣terrupted in our Mi  th by such an Apparition as a Play of  Johnson  's to be entertained at more Ease both to the Spectator and the Writer than in the Days of Old It is no Difficulty to get Hats and Swords and Wigs and Shooes and every Thing else from the Shops in Town and make a Man show himself by his Habit without more ado to be a Counsellor a Fop a Courtier or a Citizen and not be obliged to make those Characters talk in different Dia∣lects to be distinguished from each other This is certainly the surest and best Way of Writing But such a Play as this makes a Man for a Month after overrun with Criticism and enquire  What every Man on the Stage said What had such a one to do to meddle with such a Thing How came t'other who was bred after this or that Manner to speak so like a Man conversant among a different People  These Questions rob us of all our Pleasure for at this Rate no Sentence in a Play should be spoken by any one Character which could possibly enter into the Head of any other Man represented in it but  every Sentiment should be peculiar to him only who utters it Laborious  Ben  's Works will bear this Sort of Inquisition but if the present Wri∣ters were thus examined and the Offences a∣gainst this Rule cut out few Plays would be long enough for the whole Evening's Entertainment  But I don't know how they did in those old Times This same  Ben Johnson  has made every one's Passion in this Play be towards Money and yet not one of them expresses that Desire or endeavour to obtain it any Way but what is peculiar to him only One sacrifices his Wife another his Profession another his Posterity from the same Motive but their Characters are kept so skilfully apart that it seems prodigious their Discourses should rise from the Intention of the same Author  But the Poets are a Nest of Hornets and I'll drive these Thoughts no farther but must men∣tion some hard Treatment I am like to meet with from my Brother Writers I am credibly inform∣ed that the Author of a Play call'd  Love in a Hollow Tree  has made some Remarks upon my late Discourse on  The Naked Truth  I cannot blame a Gentleman for writing against any Er∣ror it is for the Good of the learned World But I would have the Thing fairly left between us Two and not under the Protection of Patrons But my Intelligence is that he has dedicated his Treatise to the Honourable Mr  Edwd Hrd  From my own Apartment  May  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  York  May  SIR  BEing convinc'd as the whole World is how in∣fallible your Predictions are and having the Honour to be your near Relation of the  Staffian  Fa∣mily I was under great Concern at one of your Pre∣dictions  relating to your self wherein you foretold your own Death would happen on the th Instant unless it were prevented by the Assistance of well∣disposed People I have therefore prevailed on my own Modesty to send you a Piece of News which may serve instead of  Goddard's Drops  to keep you alive for Two Days till Nature be able to recover it self or till you meet with some beteer Help from other Hands Therefore without further Ce∣remony I will go on to relate a singular Adven∣ture just happened in the Place where I am wri∣ting wherein it may be highly useful for the Pub∣lick to be informed  Three young Ladies of our Town were on  Satur∣day  last indicted for  Witchcraft  The Witnesses against the First deposed upon Oath before Justice  Bindover  That she kept Spirits locked up in Ves∣sels which sometimes appeared in Flames of blue Fire That she used Magical Herbs with some of which she drew in Hundreds of Men daily to her who went out from her Presence all inflamed their Mouths parched and a hot Steam issuing from them attended with a grievous Stench That many of the said Men were by the Force of that Herb metamorphosed into Swine and lay wallow∣ing in the Kennels for Twenty four Hours before they could reassume their Shapes or their Senses  It was proved against the Second That she cut off by Night the Limbs from dead Bodies that were hanged and were seen to dig Holes in the Ground to mutter some conjuring Words and bury Pieces of the Flesh after the usual Manner of Witches  The Third was accused for a notorious Piece of Sorcery long practised by Hags of moulding up Pieces of Dough into the Shapes of Men Women and Children then heating them at a gentle Fire which had a Sympathetick Power to torment the Bowels of those in the Neighbourhood  This was the Sum of what was objected against the Three Ladies who indeed had nothing to say in their own Defence but downright denying the Facts which is like to avail very little when they come upon their Trials  But the Parson of our Parish a strange refracto∣ry Man will believe nothing of all this so that the whole Town cries out  Shame That one of his Coat should be such an Atheist  And design to complain of him to the Bishop He goes about very odly to solve the Matter He supposes That the First of these Ladies keeping a Brandy and To∣bacco Shop the Fellows went out smoaking and got drunk towards Evening and made themselves Beasts He says The Second is a Butcher's Daugh∣ter and sometimes brings a Quarter of Mutton from the Slaughterhouse over Night against a MarketDay and once buried a Bit of Beef in the Ground as a known Receipt to cure Warts on her Hands The Parson affirms That the Third sells Gingerbread which to please the Children she is forced to stamp with Images before 'tis baked and if it burns their Guts 'tis because they eat too much or do not drink after it  These are the Answers he gives to solve these wonderful  Phaenomena  upon which I shall not animaavert but leave it among Philosophers And so wishing you all Success in your Underta∣kings for the Amendment of the World I remain  Dear Cousin  Your most Affectionate Kinsman and Humble Servant  Ephraim Bedstaff  P S  Those who were condemn'd to Death among the  Athenians  were obliged to take a Dose of Poison which made them die up∣wards seizing first upon their Feet making them cold and insensible and so ascending gra∣dually till it reach'd the Vital Parts I believe your Death which you foretold would happen on the th Instant will fall out the same Way and that your Distemper hath already seiz'd on you and makes Progress daily The lower Part of you that is the  Advertisements  is dead and these have risen for these Ten Days last past so that they now take up almost a whole Para∣graph Pray Sir do your Endeavour to drive this Distemper as much as possible to the ex∣treme Parts and keep it there as wise Folks do the Gout for if it once gets into your Sto∣mach it will soon fly up into your Head and you are a dead Man  St James's Coffeehouse  May  We hear from  Leghorn  That Sir  Edward Whitaker  with Five Men of War Four Transports and Two Fireships was arrived at that Port and Admiral  Bing  was suddenly expected Their Squadrons being joined they design to sail directly for  Final  to transport the Reinforce∣ments lodg'd in those Parts to  Barcelona  They write from  Milan  That Count  Thaun  arrived there on the th Instant  N S  and pro∣ceeded on his Journey to  Turin  on the st in order to concert such Measures with his Royal Highness as shall appear necessary for the Ope∣rations of the ensuing Campaign  Advices from  Dauphine  say That the Troops of the Duke of  Savoy  being already to appear in those Valleys whereof he made himself Master the last Year and that the Duke of  Berwick  apply'd himself with all ima∣ginable Diligence to secure the Passes of  the Mountains by ordering Intrenchments to be made towards  Briançon Tourneau  and the Valley of  Queiras  That General has also been at  Marseilles  and  Tboulon  to hasten the Trans∣portation of the Corn and Provisions designed for his Army  Letters from  Vienna  bearing Date  May    N S  import That the Cardinal of  SaxeZeits  and the Prince of  Litchtenstein  were preparing to set out for  Presburgh  to assist at the Diet of the States of  Hungary  which is to be assembled at that Place on the th of this Month Ge∣neral  Heister  would shortly appear at the Head of his Army at  Trentschin  which Place is appoint∣ed for the general Rendevous of the Imperial Forces in  Hungary  from whence he will advance to lay Siege in  Newhausel  In the mean Time Reinforcements with a great Train of Artillery are marching the same Way The King of  Denmark  arrived on the th Instant at  Inspruck  and on the th at  Dresden  under a a Triple Discharge of the Artillery of that Place but his Majesty refused the Ceremonies of a Publick Entry  Our Letters from the  Upper Rhine  say That the Imperial Army began to form it self at  Etlingen  where the respective Deputies of the Elector Palatine the Prince of  Baden Durlach  the Bishoprick of  Spires  c were assembled and had taken the necessary Measures for the Provision of Forage the Security of the Coun∣try against the Incursions of the Enemy and laying a Bridge over the  Rhine  Several Vessels laden with Corn are daily passing before  Frank∣fort  for the  Lower Rhine  Letters from  Poland  inform us That a De∣tachment of  Muscovite  Cavalry under the Com∣mand of General  Infland  had joined the Con∣federate Army and the Infantry commanded  by General  Goltz  was expected to come up within few Days These Succour will amount to Men  Our last Advices from the  Hague  dated  June  the th  N S  say That they expected a Courier from the  French  Court with the Ratification of the Preliminaries that Night or the Day fol∣lowing His Grace the Dake of  Marlborough  will set out for  Brussels  on  Wednesday  or  Thursday  next if the Dispatches which are expected from  Paris  don't alter his Resolutions Letters from  Majorca  confirm the

by the springing of their great Mine which did it seems more Execution than was reported Monsieur  Torcy  passed thro'  Mons  in his Return and had there a long Conference with the Elector of  Bavaria  after which that Prince spoke publickly of the Treatment he had received from  France  with the utmost Indignation  Any Person that shall come publickly Abroad in a fantastical Habit contrary to the present Mode and Fashion except Don  Diego Desmallo  or any other out of Poverty shall have his Name and Dress inserted in our next  N B  Mr  Howd'call  is desired to leave off those Buttons  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd May  to  Tuesd May    White's Chocolatehouse  May  I Came hither this Evening to see Fashions and who should I first encounter but my old Friend  Cynthio  encompassed by a Crowd of young Fellows dictating on the Passion of Love with the gayest Air imaginable  'Well says he as to what I know of the Matter there is nothing but Ogling with Skill carries a Wo∣man but indeed it is not every Fool that is capable of this Art You will find Twenty can speak eloquently Fifty can fight man∣fully and a Thousand that can dress gen∣teely at a Mistress where there is one that can gaze skilfully This requires an exquisite Judgment to take the Language of her Eyes to yours exactly and not let yours talk too fast for hers as at a Play between the Acts when Beau  Frisk  stands upon a Bench full in  Linda∣mira  's Face and her dear Eyes are searching round to avoid that flaring open Fool she meets the watchful Glance of her true Lover and sees his Heart attentive on her Charms and waiting for a second Twincle of her Eye for its next Motion Here the good Company sneer'd but he goes on Nor is this Atten∣dance a Slavery when a Man meets Encou∣ragement and her Eye comes often in his Way For after an Evening so spent and the Repe∣tition of Four or Five significant Looks at him the happy Man goes Home to his Lodging full of Ten thousand pleasing Images His Brain is dilated and gives him all the Idea's and Pro∣spects which it ever lets in to its Seat of Plea∣sure  Thus a kind Look from  Lindamira  re∣vives in his Imagination all the Beauteous Launs Green Fields Woods Forests Rivers and Solitudes which he had ever before seen in Picture Description or Real Life And all with this Addition That he now sees 'em with the Eyes of an happy Lover as before only with those of a common Man You laugh Gentlemen But consider your selves you common People that were never in Love and compare your selves in good Humour with your selves out of Humour and you will then acknowledge that all External Objects affect you according to the Disposition you are in to receive their Impressions and not as those Ob∣jects are in their own Nature How much more shall all that passes within his View and Ob∣servation touch with Delight a Man who is prepossess'd with successful Love which is an Assemblage of soft Affections gay Desires and hopeful Resolutions'  Poor  Cynthio  went on at this Rate to the Crowd about him without any Purpose in his Talk but to vent an Heart overflowing with Sense of Suc∣cess I wondered what could exalt him from the Distress in which he had long appear'd to so much Alacrity But my Familiar has given me the State of his Affairs It seems then that lately coming out of the Playhouse his Mistress who knows he is in her Livery as the Manner of insolent Beauties is resolved to keep him still so and gave him so much Wages as to complain to him of the Crowd she was to pass through He had his Wits and Resolution enough about him to take her Hand and say He would attend her to her Coach All the Way thither my good young Man stammer'd at every Word and stumbled at every Step His Mistress wonderfully pleased with her Triumph put him to a Thousand Questi∣ons  to make a Man of his natural Wit speak with Hesitation and let drop her Fan to see him recover it aukwardly This is the whole Foundation of  Cynthio  's Recovery to the spright∣ly Air he appears with at present  I grew mighty curious to know something more of that Lady's Affairs as being amaz'd how she could dally with an Offer of one of his Merit and Fortune I sent  Pacolet  to her Lodg∣ings who immediately brought me back the fol∣lowing Letter to her Friend and Confident  A∣manda  in the Country wherein she has open'd her Heart and all its Folds  Dear Amanda  THE Town grows so empty that you must ex∣pect my Letter so too except you will allow me to talk of my self instead of others You can∣not imagine what Pain it is after a whole Day spent in Publick to want your Company and the Ease which Friendship allows in being vain to each other and speaking all our Minds An Ac∣count of the Slaughter which these unhappy Eyes have made within Ten Days last past would make me appear too great a Tyrant to be allowed in a Christian Country I shall therefore confine my self to my Principal Conquests which are the Hearts of Beau  Frisk  and  Jack Freeland  be∣sides  Cynthio  who you know wore my Fetters before you went out of Town Shall I tell you my Weakness I begin to love  Frisk  It is the best humoured Impertinent Thing in the World He is always too in waiting and will certainly carry me off one Time or other  Freeland  's Father and mine have been upon Treaty without consulting me and  Cynthio  has been eternally watching my Eyes without approaching me my Friends my Maid or any one about me He hopes to get me I believe as they say the Rattle Snake does  the Squirrel by staring at me till I drop into his Mouth  Freeland  demands me for a Jointure which he thinks deserves me  Cynthio  thinks nothing high enough to be my Value  Freeland  therefore will take it for no Obligation to have me and  Cynthio  's Idea of me is what will vanish by know∣ing me better Familiarity will equally turn the Veneration of the one and the Indifference of the other into Contempt I will stick therefore to my old Maxim To have that Sort of Man who can have no greater Views than what are in my Power to give him Possession of The utmost of my Dear  Frisk  's Ambition is to be thought a Man of Fa∣shion and therefore has been so much in Mode as to resolve upon me because the whole Town likes me Thus I choose rather a Man who loves me because others do than one who approves me on his own Judgment He that judges for him∣self in Love will often change his Opinion but he that follows the Sense of others must be con∣stant as long as a Woman can make Advances The Visits I make the Entertainments I give and the Addresses I receive will be all Argu∣ments for me with a Man of  Frisk  's secondhand Genius but would be so many Bars to my Hap∣piness with any other Man However since  Frisk  can wait I shall enjoy a Summer or Two longer and remain a single Woman in the sublime Plea∣sure of being followed and admired which no∣thing can equal except that of being beloved by you  I am  c  Will's Coffeehouse  May  My chief Business here this Evening was to speak to my Friends in Behalf of honest  Cave Underhill  who has been a Comick for Three Generations My Father admired him extreme∣ly when he was a Boy There is certainly Na∣ture  excellently represented in his Manner of Action in which he ever avoided that gene∣ral Fault in Players of doing too much It must be confess'd he has not the Merit of some ingenious Persons now on the Stage of adding to his Authors for the Actors were so dull in the last Age that many of them have gone out of the World without having ever spoke one Word of their own in the Theatre Poor  Cave  is so mortified that he quibbles and tells you he pretends only to act a Part fit for a Man who has one Foot in the Grave  viz  a  Gravedig∣ger  All Admirers of true Comedy it is hop'd will have the Gratitude to be present on the last Day of his Acting who if he does not happen to please them will have it even then to say That it is his first Offence  But there is a Gentleman here who says he has it from good Hands that there is actually a Subscription made by many Persons of Wit and Quality for the Encouragement of new Come∣dies This Design will very much contribute to the Improvement and Diversion of the Town But as every Man is most concerned for him∣self I who am of a  Saturnine  and Melancholy Complexion cannot but murmur that there is not an equal Invitation to write Tragedies ha∣ving by me in my Book of Common Places enough to enable me to finish a very Sad one by the Fifth of the next Month I have the Farewell of a General with a Truncheon in his Hand dying for Love in Six Lines I have the Principles of a Politician who does all the Mischief in the Play together with his Decla∣ration on the Vanity of Ambition in his last Moments express'd in a Page and an half I have all my Oaths ready and my Similies want nothing but Application I won't pretend to give you an Account of the Plot it being the  same Design upon which all Tragedies have been writ for several Years last past and from the Beginning of the First Scene the Frequenters of the House may know as well as the Author when the Battle is to be fought the Lady to yield and the Hero proceed to his Wedding and Coronation Besides these Advantages which I have in Readiness I have an eminent Trage∣dian very much my Friend who shall come in and go through the whole Five Acts without troubling me for one Sentence whether he is to kill or be killed love or be loved win Battles or lose them or whatever other Tragical Perfor∣mance I shall please to assign him  From my own Apartment  May  I have this Day received a Letter subscribed  Fidelia  that gives me an Account of an In∣chantment under which a young Lady suffers and desires my Help to exorcise her from the Power of the Sorcerer Her Lover is a Rake of Sixty the Lady a virtuous Woman of Twenty five Her Relations are to the last De∣gree afflicted and amazed at this irregular Pas∣sion Their Sorrow I know not how to re∣move but can their Astonishment for there is no Spirit in Woman half so prevalent as that of Contradiction which is the sole Cause of her Perseverance Let the whole Family go dress'd in a Body and call the Bride to Morrow Morn∣ing to her Nuptials and I'll undertake the In∣constant will forget her Lover in the midst of all his Aches But if this Expedient does not suc∣ceed I must be so just to the young Lady's di∣stinguishing Sense as to applaud her Choice A fine young Woman at last is but what is due from Fate to an honest Fellow who has suffered so unmercifully by the Sex and I think we can∣not enough celebrate her Heroick Virtue who like the Patriot that ended a Pestilence by  plunging himself into a Gulph gives her self up to gorge that Dragon which has devoured so many Virgins before her  A Letter directed to  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  A∣strologer and Physician in Ordinary to Her Maje∣sty's Subjects of  Great Britain  with Respect is come to Hand  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd May  to  Thursd June    White's Chocolatehouse  May  THE Generality of Mankind are so very fond of this World and of staying in it that a Man cannot have eminent Skill in any one Art but they will in Spite of his Teeth make him a Physician also that being the Science the Worldings have most need of I pretended when I first set up to Astrology only but I am told I have deep Skill also in Medecine I am applied to now by a Gentleman for my Advice in Behalf of his Wife who upon the least Matri∣monial Difficulty is excessively troubled with Fits and can bear no Manner of Passion without falling into immediate Convulsions I must con∣fess it is a Case I have known before and re∣member the Party was recovered by certain Words pronounced in the midst of the Fit by the Learned Doctor who performed the Cure These Ails have usually their Beginning from the Affections of the Mind Therefore you must have Patience to let me give you an Instance whereby you may discern the Cause of the Distemper and then proceed in the Cure as follows  A fine Town Lady was married to a Gentle∣man of ancient Descent in one of the Counties  of  Great Britain  who had good Humour to a Weakness and was that Sort of Person of whom it is usually said He is no Man's Ene∣my but his own One who had too much Ten∣derness of Soul to have any Authority with his Wife and she too little Sense to give him Au∣thority for that Reason His kind Wife observed this Temper in him and made proper Use of it But knowing it was below a Gentlewoman to wrangle she resolved upon an Expedient to save Decorum and wear her Dear to her Point at the same Time She therefore took upon her to go∣vern him by falling into Fits whenever she was repulsed in a Request or contradicted in a Dis∣course It was a FishDay when in the midst of her Husband's good Humour at Table she bethought her self to try her Project She made Signs that she had swallowed a Bone The Man grew pale as Ashes and ran to her Assistance calling for Drink No my Dear said she reco∣vering It is down don't be frightened This Accident betrayed his Softness enough The next Day she complained a Lady's Chariot whose Husband had not half his Estate had a CraneNeck and hung with twice the Air that hers did He answered Madam You know my Income you know I have lost Two CoachHorses this SpringDown she fell  Harts∣horn  Betty Susan Alice  throw Water in her Face  With much Care and Pains she was at last brought to her self and the Vehicle in which she visited was amended in the nicest Manner to prevent Relapses but they frequently happen'd during that Husband's whole Life which he had the good Fortune to end in few Years after The Disconsolate soon pitched upon a very agreeable Successor whom she very prudently designed to  by the same Method This Man knew her little Arts and resolved to break through all  Tenderness and be absolute Master as soon as Occasion offered One Day it happened that a Discourse arose about Furniture He was very glad of the Occasion and fell into an Invective against  China  protesting he would never let Five Pounds more of his Money be laid out that Way as long as he breathed She immediately faintedHe starts up as amaz'd and calls for HelpThe Maids ran to the ClosetHe chafes her Face bends her forwards and beats the Palms of her Hands Her Convulsions increase and down she tumbles on the Floor where she lies quite dead in Spight of what the whole Fa∣mily from the Nursery to the Kitchin could do for her Relief  While every Servant was thus helping or la∣menting their Mistress he fixing his Cheek to hers seemed to be following her in a Trance of Sorrow but secretly whispers her  My Dear This will never do What is within my Power and Fortune you may always command but none of your Artifices You are quite in other Hands than those you passed these pretty Passions upon  This made her almost in the Condition she pretended her Convulsions now come thicker nor was she to be held down The kind Man doubles his Care helps the Servants to throw Water in her Face by full Quarts and when the sinking Part of the Fit came again  Well my Dear  said he  I applaud your Action but I must take my Leave of you till you are more sincere with me Farewell for ever You shall always know where to hear of me and want for nothing  With that he or∣dered the Maids to keep plying her with Harts∣horn while he went for a Physician He was scarce at the Stairhead when she followed and pulling him into a Closet thank'd him for her Cure which was so absolute that she gave me this Relation her self to be communi∣cated  for the Benefit of all the voluntary Inva∣lids of her Sex  St James's Coffeehouse  June  Advices from  Brussels  of the th Instant  N S  say His Highness Prince  Eugene  had received a Letter from Monsieur  Torcy  wherein that Mini∣ster after many Expressions of great Respect acquaints him That his Master had absolutely refused to sign the Preliminaries to the Treaty which he had in his Majesty's Behalf consented to at the  Hague  Upon the Receipt of this In∣telligence the Face of Things at that Place were immediately altered and the necessary Orders were transmitted to the Troops which lay most remote from thence to move towards the Place of Rendezvous with all Expedition The Ene∣my seem also to prepare for the Field and have at present drawn together Twentyfive Thousand Men in the Plains of  Lenz  Mareschal  Villars  is at the Head of those Troops and has given the Generals under his Command all possible Assu∣rances that he will turn the Fate of the War to the Advantage of his Master  They write from the  Hague  of the th That Monsieur  Rouille  had received Orders from the Court of  France  to signify to the StatesGene∣ral and the Ministers of the High Allies That the King could not consent to the Preliminaries of a Treaty of Peace as it was offered to him by Monsieur  Torcy  The great Difficulty is the Business of  Spain  on which Particular his Mi∣nisters seemed only to say during the Treaty that it was not so immediately under their Ma∣ster's Direction as that he could engage for its being relinquished by the Duke of  Anjou  But now he positively answers That he cannot com∣ply with what his Minister has promised in his Behalf even in such Points as are wholly in himself to act in or not This has had no  other Effect than to give the Alliance fresh Arguments for being diffident of Engagements entered into by  France  The Pensioner made a Report of all which this Minister had declared to the Deputies of the StatesGeneral and all Things turn towards a vigorous War The Duke of  Marlborough  designed to leave the  Hague  within Two Days in order to put him∣self at the Head of the Army which is to as∣semble on the th Instant between the  Scheld  and the  Lis  A Fleet of Eighty Sail laden with Corn from the  Baltick  is arrived in the  Texel  The States have sent Circular Letters to all the Provinces to notify this Change of Affairs and animate their Subjects to new Resolutions in Defence of their Country  From my own Apartment  May  The Publick is not so little my Concern tho' I am but a Student as that I should not interest my self in the present great Things in Agitation I am still of Opinion the  French  King will sign the Preliminaries With that View I have sent him by my Familiar the following Epistle and admonished him on Pain of what I shall say of him to future Generations to act with Sincerity on this Occasion  London  May  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  of  Great Britain  to  Lewis  the Fourteenth of  France  THE surprising News which arrived this Day of your Majesty's having refused to sign the Treaty your Ministers have in a Manner sued for is what gives Ground to this Application to your Majesty from one whose Name perhaps is too obscure to have ever reached your Territories but one who with all the  European  World is affected with your Determinations Therefore  as it is mine and the common Cause of Man∣kind I presume to expostulate with you on this Occasion It will I doubt not appear to the Vulgar extravagant that the Actions of a mighty Prince should be ballanced by the Censure of a private Man whose Approbation or Dislike are equally contemptible in their Eyes when they regard the Thrones of Sovereigns But your Majesty has shown through the whole Course of your Reign too great a Value for Liberal Arts to be insensible that true Fame lies only in the Hands of Learned Men by whom it is to be transmitted to Futurity with Marks of Ho∣nour or Reproach to the End of Time The Date of Humane Life is too short to recompence the Cares which attend the most private Condi∣tion Therefore it is that our Souls are made as it were too big for it and extend themselves in the Prospect of a longer Existence in a good Fame and Memory of worthy Actions after our Decease The whole Race of Men have this Passion in some Degree implanted in their Bo∣soms which is the strongest and noblest Incita∣tion to honest Attempts But the base Use of the Arts of Peace Eloquence Poetry and all the Parts of Learning have been possessed by Souls so unworthy those Faculties that the Names and Appellations of Things have been confounded by the Labours and Writings of pro∣stituted Men who have stamp'd a Reputation upon such Actions as are in themselves the Ob∣jects of Contempt and Disgrace This is that which has misled your Majesty in the Conduct of your Reign and made that Life which might have been the most imitable the most to be a∣voided To this it is that the great and excel∣lent Qualities of which your Majesty is Master are lost in their Application and your Majesty has been carrying on for many Years the most  cruel Tyranny with all the noble Methods which are used to support a just Reign Thus it is that it avails nothing that you are a Bountiful Master that you are so Generous as to reward even the Unsuccessful with Honour and Riches that no laudable Action passes unrewarded in your King∣doms that you have searched all Nations for obscure Merit In a Word that you are in your private Character endowed with every Princely Quality when all this is subjected to unjust and illtaught Ambition which to the Injury of the World is gilded by those Endowments How∣ever if your Majesty will condescend to look into your own Soul and consider all its Facul∣ties and Weaknesses with Impartiality if you will but be convinced that Life is supported in you by the ordinary Methods of Food Rest and Sleep you would think it impossible that you could ever be so much imposed on as to have been wrought into a Belief that so many Thou∣sands of the same Make with your self were formed by Providence for no other End but by the Hazard of their very Being to extend the Conquests and Glory of an Individual of their own Species A very little Reflection will con∣vince your Majesty that such cannot be the In∣tent of the Creator and if not What Horror must it give your Majesty to think of the vast Devastations your Ambition has made among your FellowCreatures While the Warmth of Youth the Flattery of Crowds and a continual Series of Success and Triumph indulged your Majesty in this Allusion of Mind it was less to be wondered at that you proceeded in this mi∣staken Pursuit of Grandeur but when Age Disappointments Publick Calamities Personal Distempers and the Reverse of all that makes Men forget their true Being are fallen upon you Heavens Is it possible you can live with∣out  Remorse Can the wretched Man be a Ty∣rant Can Grief study Torments Can Sorrow be Cruel  Your Majesty will observe I do not bring a∣gainst you a railing Accusation but as you are a strict Professor of Religion I beseech your Ma∣jesty to stop the Effusion of Blood by receiving the Opportunity which presents it self for the Preservation of your distressed People Be no longer so infatuated as to hope for Renown from Murder and Violence But consider that the Great Day will come in which this World and all its Glory shall change in a Moment When Na∣ture shall sicken and the Earth and Sea give up the Bodies committed to them to appear before the last Tribunal Will it then Oh King be an Answer for the Lives of Millions who have fal∣len by the Sword  They perished for my Glory  That Day will come on and one like it is imme∣diately approaching Injur'd Nations advance to∣wards thy Habitation Vengeance has began its March which is to be diverted only by the Peni∣tence of the Oppressor Awake O Monarch from thy Lethargy Disdain the Abuses thou hast received Pull down the Statue which calls thee Immortal Be truly Great Tear thy Pur¦ple and put on Sackcloth I am  Thy Generous Enemy  Isaac Bickerstaff  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd June  to  Saturd June    White's Chocolatehouse  June  IN my Paper of the th of the last Month I mentioned several Characters which want Explanation to the Generality of Readers A∣mong others I spoke of a Pretty Fellow I have since received a kind Admonition in a Letter to take Care that I do not omit to show also what is meant by a  very  Pretty Fellow which is to be allowed as a Character by it self and a Person exalted above the other by a peculiar Sprightli∣ness as one who by a distinguishing Vigour outstrips his Companions and has thereby de∣served and obtained a particular Appellation or Nickname of Familiarity Some have this Di∣stinction from the Fair Sex who are so generous as to take into their Protection such as are laugh∣ed at by the Men and place them for that Rea∣son in Degrees of Favour  The chief of this Sort is Colonel  Brunett  who is a Man of Fashion because he will be so and practises a very janty Way of Behaviour because he is too careless to know when he offends and too sanguine to be mortified if he did know it Thus the Colonel has met with a Town ready to receive him and cannot possibly see why he should not make use of their Favour and set himself in the First Degree of Conversation Therefore he is very successfully loud among the Wits fami∣liar among the Ladies and dissolute among the Rakes Thus he is admitted in one Place be∣cause he is so in another and every Man treats  Brunett  well not out of his particular Esteem  for him but in Respect to the Opinion of others It is to me a solid Pleasure to see the World thus mistaken on the goodnatur'd Side for 'tis Ten to One but the Colonel mounts into a General Officer marries a fine Lady and is Master of a good Estate before they come to explain upon him What gives most Delight to me in this Ob∣servation is that all this arises from pure Na∣ture and the Colonel can account for his Suc∣cess no more than those by whom he succeeds For these Causes and Considerations I pronounce him a true Woman's Man and in the first De∣gree  A very pretty Fellow  The next to a Man of this universal Genius is one who is peculiarly formed for the Service of the Ladies and his Merit chiefly is to be of no Consequence I am indeed a little in Doubt Whe∣ther he ought not rather to be called a  very Happy  than a  very Pretty  Fellow For he is admitted at all Hours All he says or does which would of∣fend in another are passed over in him and all Actions and Speeches which please doubly please if they come from him No one wonders or takes Notice when he's wrong but all admire him when he's in the RightBy the Way it is fit to remark That there are People of better Sense than these who endeavour at this Character but they are out of Nature and tho' with some Industry they get the Characters of Fools they cannot ar∣rive to be  very  seldom to be meerly  Pretty Fel∣lows  But where Nature has formed a Person for this Station amongst Men he is gifted with a pe∣culiar Genius for Success and his very Errors and Absurdities contribute to it this Felicity attend∣ing him to his Life's End For it being in a Man∣ner necessary that he should be of no Consequence he is as well in old Age as Youth and I know a Man whose Son has been some Years a pretty Fellow who is himself at this Hour a  very  Pretty Fellow  One must move tenderly in this Place for we are now in the Ladies Lodgings and speaking of such as are supported by their Influence and Fa∣vour against which there is not neither ought there to be any Dispute or Observation But when we come into more free Air one may talk a little more at large  Give me Leave then to mention Three whom I do not doubt but we shall see make considerable Figures and these are such as for their  Baccha∣nalian  Performances must be admitted into this Order They are Three Brothers lately landed from  Holland  As yet indeed they have not made their publick Entry but lodge and con∣verse at  Wapping  They have merited already on the Waterside particular Titles The First is cal∣led  Hogshead  the Second  Culverin  and the Third  Musquet  This Fraternity is preparing for our End of the Town by their Ability in the Ex∣ercises of  Bacchus  and measure their Time and Merit by Liquid Weight and Power of Drink∣ing  Hogshead  is a prettier Fellow than  Culverin  by Two Quarts and  Culverin  than  Musquet  by a full Pint It is to be feared  Hogshead  is so often too full and  Culverin  overloaded that  Musquet  will be the only lasting  very  Pretty Fellow of the Three  A Third Sort of this Denomination are such as by very daring Adventures in Love have pur∣chased to themselves Renown and new Names as  Jo Carry  for his excessive Strength and Vi∣gour  Tom Drybones  for his generous Loss of Youth and Health and  Cancrum  for his meri∣torious Rottenness  These great and leading Spirits are proposed to all such of our  British  Youth as would arrive at Perfection in these different Kinds and if their Parts and Accomplishments were well imi∣tated it is not doubted but that our Nation  would soon excel all others it Wit and Arts as they already do in Arms    N B  The Gentleman who stole  Betty Pepin  may own it for he is allowed to be a  very  Pret∣ty Fellow  But we must proceed to the Explanation of other Terms in our Writings  To know what a Toast is in the Country gives as much Perplexity as she her self does in Town And indeed the Learned differ very much upon the Original of this Word and the Acceptation of it among the Moderns However it is by all agreed to have a joyous and chearful Import A Toast in a cold Morning heightened by Nutmeg and sweeten'd with Sugar has for many Ages been given to our Rural Dispensers of Justice before they enter'd upon Causes and has been of great and politick Use to take off the Severi∣ty of their Sentences but has indeed been remarkable for one ill Effect that it inclines those who use it immoderately to speak  Latin  to the Admiration rather than Information of an Audience This Application of a Toast makes it very obvious that the Word may without a Metaphor be understood as an apt Name for a Thing which raises us in the most sovereign De∣gree But many of the Wits of the last Age will assert That the Word in its present Sense was known among them in their Youth and had its Rise from an Accident at the Town of  Bath  in the Reign of King  Charles  the Second  It happened that on a Publick Day a celebra∣ted Beauty of those Times was in the  Cross Bath  and one of the Crowd of her Admirers took a Glass of the Water in which the Fair One stood and drank her Health to the Company There was in the Place a Gay Fellow half fuddled who offered to jump in and swore Tho' he liked not  the Liquor he would have the Toast He was opposed in his Resolution yet this Whim gave Foundation to the present Honour which is done to the Lady we mention in our Liquors who has ever since been called a  Toast  Tho' this Institution had so trivial a Beginning it is now elevated into a formal Order and that happy Virgin who is received and drank to at their Meetings has no more to do in this Life but to judge and accept of the first good Offer The Manner of her Inauguration is much like that of the Choice of a Doge in  Venice  It is per∣formed by Ballotting and when she is so cho∣sen she reigns indisputably for that ensuing Year but must be elected anew to prolong her Empire a Moment beyond it When she is regularly cho∣sen her Name is written with a Diamond on a Drinkingglass The Hieroglyphick of the Dia∣mond is to shew her that her Value is imaginary and that of the Glass to acquaint her that her Condition is frail and depends on the Hand which holds her This wise Design admonishes her nei∣ther to overrate or depreciate her Charms as well considering and applying that it is perfect∣ly according to the Humour and Taste of the Company whether the Toast is eaten or left as an Offal  The Foremost of the whole Rank of Toasts and the most undisputed in their present Empire are Mrs  Gatty  and Mrs  Frontlet  The First an Agreeable the Second an Awful Beauty These Ladies are perfect Friends out of a Knowledge that their Perfections are too different to stand in Competition He that likes  Gatty  can have no Relish for so solemn a Creature as  Frontlet  and an Admirer of  Frontlet  will call  Gatty  a May∣pole Girl  Gatty  for ever smiles upon you and  Frontlet  disdains to see you smile  Gatty  's Love is a shining quick Flame  Frontlet  's a slow wast∣ing  Fire  Gatty  likes the Man that diverts her  Frontlet  him who adores her  Gatty  always im∣proves the Soil in which she travels  Frontlet  lays waste the Country  Gatty  does not only smile but laughs at her Lover  Frontlet  not only looks serious but frowns at him All the Men of Wit and Coxcombs their Followers are professed Servants of  Gatty  The Politicians and Pretenders give solemn Worship to  Frontlet  Their Reign will be best judged of by its Dura∣tion  Frontlet  will never be chosen more and  Gatty  is a Toast for Life  St James's Coffeehouse  June  Letters from  Hamburgh  of the th Instant  N S  inform us That no Art or Cost is omitted to make the Stay of his  Danish  Majesty at  Dresden  agree∣able but there are various Speculations upon the Interview between King  Angustus  and that Prince many putting Politick Constructions up∣on his  Danish  Majesty's Arrival at a Time when his Troops are marching out of  Hungary  with Orders to pass through  Saxony  where it is given out that they are to be recruited It is said also That several  Polish  Senators have invited K  Au∣gustus  to return into  Poland  His Majesty of  Swe∣den  according to the same Advices has passed the  Nieper  without any Opposition from the  Mus∣covites  and advances with all possible Expedi∣tion towards  Volhinia  where he proposes to join King  Stanislaus  and General  Cressau  We hear from  Bern  of the st Instant  N S  That there is not a Province in  France  from whence the Court is not apprehensive of recei∣ving Accounts of Publick Emotions occasion'd by the Want of Corn The General Diet of the Cantons is assembled at  Baden  but have not yet entered upon Business so that the Affair of  Tockenburgh  is yet at a Stand  Letters from the  Hague  dated the th Instant  N S  advise That Monsieur  Rouillé  having ac∣quainted the Ministers of the Allies that his Ma∣nner had refused to ratify the Preliminaries of a Treaty adjusted with Monsieur  Torcy  set out for  Paris  on  Sunday  Morning The same Day the Foreign Ministers met a Committee of the StatesGeneral where Monsieur  van Hessen  opened the Business upon which they were assembled and in a very warm Discourse laid before them the Con∣duct of  France  in the late Negotiations repre∣senting the abject Manner in which she had laid open her own Distresses that reduced her to a Compliance with the Demands of all the Allies and her Meannesses in receding from those Points to which Monsieur  Torcy  had consented The re∣spective Minister of each Potentate of the Alli∣ance severally expressed their Resentment of the faithless Behaviour of the  French  and gave each other mutual Assurances of the Constancy and Resolution of their Principals to proceed with the utmost Vigour against the common EnemyHis Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  set out from the  Hague  on the th in the Afternoon and lay that Night at  Rotterdam  from whence at Four the next Morning

between  Lens la Basses  and  Douay  Yesterday Morning Sir  John Norris  with the Squadron under his Command sailed from the  Downes  for  Holland  From my own Apartment  June  I have the Honour of the following Letter from a Gentleman whom I receive into my Fa∣mily and order the Heralds at Arms to enroll him accordingly  Mr  Bickerstaff  THO' you have excluded me the Honour of your Family yet I have ventured to cor∣respond with the same great Persons as your self and have wrote this Post to the King of  France  tho' I am in a Manner unknown in his Country and have not been seen there these many Months  To LEWIS le Grand  Tho' in your Country I'm unknown  Yet Sir I must advise you  Of late so poor and mean you're grown  That all the World despise you  Here Vermin eat your Majesty  There meagre Subjects stand unfed  What surer Signs of Poverty  Than many Lice and little Bread  Then Sir the present Minute chuse  Our Armies are advanced  Those Terms you at the  Hague  refuse  At  Paris  won't be granted  Consider this and  Dunkirk  raze  And  Anna  's Title own  Send one Pretender out to graze  And call the other Home  Your Humble Servant  Bread the Staff of Life  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturday June  to  Tuesd June    White's Chocolate house  June  A Letter from a young Lady written in the most passionate Terms wherein she laments the Misfortune of a Gentleman her Lover who was lately wounded in a Duel has turned my Thoughts to that Subject and enclined me to examine into the Causes which precipitate Men into so fatal a Folly And as it has been propo∣sed to treat of Subjects of Gallantry in the Arti∣cle from hence and no one Point in Nature is more proper to be consider'd by the Company who frequent this Place than that of Duels it is worth our Consideration to examine into this Chimaerical groundless Humour and to lay every other Thought aside till we have strip'd it of all its false Pretences to Credit and Reputation amongst Men  But I must confess when I consider what I am going about and run over in my Imagination all the endless Crowd of Men of Honour who will be offended at such a Discourse I am underta∣king methinks a Work worthy an invulnerable Hero in Romance rather than a private Gentle∣man with a single Rapier But as I am pretty well acquainted by great Opportunities with the Nature of Man and know of a Truth that all Men fight  against their Will  the Danger vanishes and Resolution rises upon this Subject For this Reason I shall talk very freely on a Custom which all Men wish exploded though no Man has Courage enough to resist it  But there is one unintelligible Word which I fear will extremely perplex my Dissertation and  I confess to you I find very hard to explain which is the Term  Satisfaction  An honest Country Gentleman had the Misfortune to fall into Com∣pany with Two or Three modern Men of Honour where he happened to be very ill treated and one of the Company being conscious of his Of∣fence sends a Note to him in the Morning and tells him He was ready to give him Satisfaction This is fine Doing says the plain Fellow Last Night he sent me away cursedly out of Humour and this Morning he fancies it would be a Satis∣faction to be run through the Body  As the Matter at present stands it is not to do handsome Actions denominates a Man of Honour it is enough if he dares to defend ill Ones Thus you often see a common Sharper in Competition with a Gentleman of the first Rank though all Mankind is convinced that a fighting Gamester is only a Pickpocket with the Courage of an HighwayMan One cannot with any Patience reflect on the unaccountable Jumble of Persons and Things in this Town and Nation which oc∣casions very frequently that a brave Man falls by a Hand below that of the common Hangman and yet his Executioner escapes the Clutches of the Hangman for doing it I shall therefore here∣after consider how the bravest Men in other Ages and Nations have behaved themselves upon such Incidents as we decide by Combat and show from their Practice that this Resentment neither has its Foundation from true Reason or solid Fame but is an Imposture made up of Cowar∣dice Falshood and Want of Understanding For this Work a good History of Quarrels would be very edifying to the Publick and I apply my self to the Town for Particulars and Circum∣stances within their Knowledge which may serve to embellish the Dissertation with proper Cuts Most of the Quarrels I have ever known  have proceeded from some valiant Coxcomb's per∣sisting in the Wrong to defend some prevailing Folly and preserve himself from the Ingenuity of owning a Mistake  By this Means it is called  Giving a Man Satis∣faction  to urge your Offence against him with your Sword which puts me in Mind of  Peter  's Order to the Keeper in  The Tale of a Tub If you neglect to do all this damn you and your Gene∣ration for ever and so we bid you heartily fare∣wel  If the Contradiction in the very Terms of one of our Challenges were as well explained and turn'd into downright  English  would it not run after this Manner  SIR  YOur extraordinary Behaviour last Night and the Liberty you were pleased to take with me makes me this Morning give you this to tell you because you are an illbred Puppy I will meet you in  HidePark  an Hour hence and because you want both Breeding and Hu∣manity I desire you would come with a Pistol in your Hand on Horseback and endeavour to shoot me through the Head to teach you more Manners If you fail of doing me this Pleasure I shall say You are a Rascal on every Post in Town And so Sir if you will not injure me more I shall never forgive what you have done already Pray Sir do not fail of getting every Thing ready and you will infinitely oblige  SIR  Your most Obedient Humble Servant  c  From my own Apartment  June  Among the many Employments I am necessa∣rily put upon by my Friends that of giving Ad∣vice  is the most unwelcome to me and indeed I am forced to use a little Art in the Matter for some People will ask Counsel of you when they have already acted what they tell you is still un∣der Deliberation I had almost lost a very good Friend t'other Day who came to know how I liked his Design to marry such a Lady I an∣swered By no Means and I must be positive a∣gainst it for very solid Reasous which are not proper to communicate Not proper to commu∣nicate said he with a grave Air I will know the Bottom of this I saw him moved and knew from thence he was already determined there∣fore evaded it by saying To tell you the Truth dear  Frank  Of all Women living I would have her my self  Isaac  said he Thou art too late for we have been both one these two Months  I learned this Caution by a Gentleman's con∣sulting me formerly about his Son He railed at his damn'd Extravagance and told me In a very little Time he would beggar him by the exor∣bitant Bills which came from  Oxford  every Quar∣ter  Make the Rogue bite upon the Bridle  said I  pay none of his Bills it will but encourage him to further Trespasses  He look'd plaguy sowr at me His Son soon after sent up a Paper of Verses forsooth in Print on the last publick Occasion upon which he is convinced the Boy has Parts and a Lad of Spirit is not to be too much cramp'd in his Maintenance lest he take ill Courses Nei∣ther Father nor Son can ever since endure the Sight of me  These Sort of People ask Opinions only out of the Fulness of their Heart on the Subject of their Perplexity and not from a Desire of Infor∣mation  There is nothing so easy as to find out which Opinion the Person in Doubt has a Mind to therefore the sure Way is to tell him that is cer∣tainly  to be chosen Then you are to be very clear and positive leave no Handle for Scruple Bless me Sir there's no Room for a Question This rivets you into his Heart for you at once applaud his Wisdom and gratify his Inclination However I had too much Bowels to be insincere to a Man who came Yesterday to know of me With which of two eminent Men in the City he should place his Son Their Names are  Paulo  and  Avaro  This gave me much Debate with my self because not only the Fortune of the Youth but his Virtue also depended upon this Choice The Men are equally wealthy but they differ in the Use and Application of their Riches which you immediately see upon entring their Doors  The Habitation of  Paulo  has at once the Air of a Nobleman and a Merchant You see the Servants act with Affection to their Master and Satisfaction in themselves The Master meets you with an open Countenance full of Benevo∣lence and Integrity Your Business is dispatched with that Confidence and Welcome which al∣ways accompanies honest Minds His Table is the Image of Plenty and Generosity supported by Justice and Frugality After we had dined here our Affair was to visit  Avaro  Out comes an aukward Fellow with a careful Countenance Sir Would you speak with my Master May I crave your Name After the first Preambles he leads us into a noble Solitude a great House that seem'd uninhabited but from the End of the spacious Hall moves towards us  Avaro  with a suspicious Aspect as if he believed us Thieves and as for my Part I approached him as if I knew him a Cutpurse We fell into Discourse of his noble Dwelling and the Great Estate all the World knew he had to enjoy in it And I to plague him fell a commending  Paulo  's Way  of Living  Paulo  answered  Avaro  is a very good Man but we who have smaller Estates must cut our Coat according to our Cloth Nay says I Every Man knows his own Circumstance best you are in the Right if you han't where∣withal He look'd very sowr for it is you must know the utmost Vanity of a mean∣spi∣rited rich Man to be contradicted when he calls himself Poor But I was resolved to vex him by consenting to all he said the main Design of which was that he would have us find out he was one of the wealthiest Men in  London  and lived like a Beggar We left him and took a Turn on the Change My Friend was ravished with  Avaro  This said he is cer∣tainly a sure Man I contradicted him with much Warmth and summed up their different Characters as well as I could This  Paulo  said I grows wealthy by being a common Good  Avaro  by being a general Evil  Paulo  has the Art  Avaro  the Craft of Trade When  Paulo  gains all Men he deals with are the better Whenever  Avaro  profits another certainly loses In a Word  Paulo  is a Citizen and  Avaro  a Cit I convinced my Friend and carried the young Gentleman the next Day to  Paulo  where he will learn the Way both to gain and enjoy a good Fortune And tho' I cannot say I have by keep∣ing him from  Avaro  saved him from the Gal∣lows I have prevented his deserving it every Day he lives For with  Paulo  he will be an honest Man without being so for Fear of the Law as with  Avaro  he would have been a Villain with∣in the Protection of it  St James's Coffeehouse  June  We hear from  Vienna  of the st Instant That Baron  Imoff  who attended her Catholick Ma∣jesty with the Character of Envoy from the  Duke of  Wolfembuttel  was returned thither That Minister brought an Account That MajorGeneral  Stanhope  with the Troops which em∣barked at  Naples  was returned to  Barcelona  We hear from  Berlin  by Advices of the th Instant That his  Prussian  Majesty had received Intelligence from his Minister at  Dresden  that the King of  Denmark  desired to meet his Maje∣sty at  Magdeburg  The King of  Prussia  has sent Answer That his present Indisposition will not admit of so great a Journey but has sent the King a very pressing Invitation to come to  Berlin  or  Potsdam  These Advices say That the Minister of the King of  Sweden  has produced a Letter from his Master to the King of  Poland  dated from  Ba∣titzan  the th of  March O S  wherein he ac∣quaints him that he has been successful against the  Muscovites  in all the Occasions which have happened since his March into their Country Great Numbers have revolted to the  Swedes  since General  Mazeppa  went over to that Side and as many as have done so have taken solemn Oaths to adhere to the Interests of his  Swedish  Majesty  Advices from the  Hague  of the th Instant  N S  say That all Things tended to a vigorous and active Campagne the Allies having strong Resentments against the late Behaviour of the Court of  France  and the  French  using all possi∣ble Endeavours to animate their Men to defend their Country against a victorious and exaspe∣rated Enemy Monsieur  Rouillé  had passed through  Brussels  without visiting either the Duke of  Marlborough  or Prince  Eugene  who were both there at that Time The States have met and publickly declared their Satisfaction in the Con∣duct of their Deputies during the whole Treaty Letters from  France  say That the Court is re∣solved to put all to the Issue of the ensuing  Campaign In the mean Time they have ordered the Preliminary Treaty to be published with Ob∣servation upon each Article in order to quiet the Minds of the People and perswade them that it has not been in the Power of the King to procure a Peace but to the Diminution of his Majesty's Glory and the Hazard of his Dominions His Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  and Prince  Eu∣gene  arrived at  Ghent  on  Wednesday  last where at an Assembly of all the General Officers it was thought proper by reason of the great Rains which have lately fallen to defer forming a Camp or bringing the Troops together but as soon as the Weather would permit to march up∣on the Enemy with all Expedition  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesday June  to  Thursd June    From my own Apartment  June  I Have read the following Letter with Delight and Approbation and I hereby order Mr  Kid∣ney  at St  James  's and Sir  Thomas  at  White  's who are my Clerks for enrolling all Men in their distant Classes before they presume to drink Tea or Chocolate in those Places to take Care that the Persons within the Descriptions in the Letter be admitted and excluded according to my Friend's Remonstrance  June  SIR  YOur Paper of  Saturday  has raised up in me a noble Emulation to be recorded in the foremost Rank of Worthies therein mention'd and if any Regard be had to Merit or Industry I may hope to succeed in the Promotion for I  have omitted no Toil or Expence to be a Profi∣cient and if my Friends do not flatter they assure me I have not lost my Time since I came to Town To enumerate but a few Particu∣lars There's hardly a Coachman I meet with but desires to be excused taking me because he has had me before I have compounded Two or Three Rapes and let out to Hire as many Bastards to Beggars I never saw above the First Act of a Play And as to my Courage it is well known I have more than once had suf∣ficient Witnesses of my drawing my Sword both in Tavern and Playhouse Dr  Wall  is my particular Friend and if it were any Service to the Publick to compose the Difference be∣tween  Martin  and  Sintilaer  the  Pearldriller  I don't know a Judge of more Experience than my self For in that I may say with the Poet  Quae Regio in Villâ nostri non plena Laboris  I omit other less Particulars the necessary Con∣sequences of greater Actions But my Reason for troubling you at this present is to put a Stop if it may be to an insinuating increasing Set of People who sticking to the  Letter  of your Treatise and not to the Spirit of it do assume the Name of  Pretty  Fellows nay and even get new Names as you very well hint Some of them I have heard calling to one ano∣ther as I have sate at  White  's and St  James  's by the Names of  Betty Nelly  and so forth You see them accost each other with effeminate Airs They have their Signs and Tokens like FreeMa∣sons They rail at Womenkind receive Visits on their Beds in Gowns and do a Thousand other unintelligible Prettinesses that I cannot tell what to make of I therefore heartily desire you would exclude all this Sort of Animals  There is another Matter I am foreseeing an ill Consequence from but may be timely pre∣vented by Prudence which is that for the last Fortnight prodigious Shoals of Volunteers have gone over to bully the  French  upon hearing the Peace was just signing and this is so true that I can assure you all Ingrossing Work about the  Temple  is risen above  s  in the Pound for want of Hands Now as 'tis possible some little Al∣teration of Affairs may have broken their Mea∣sures and that they will post back again I am under the last Apprehension that these will at their Return all set up for  Pretty Fellows  and thereby confound all Merit and Service and im∣pose on us some new Alteration in our Night∣capWigs and Pockets unless you can provide a particular Class for them I cannot apply my self better than to you and I am sure I speak the Mind of a very great Number as deserving as my self  The Pretensions of this Correspondent are worthy a particular Distinction He cannot in∣deed be admitted as a  Pretty  but is what we most justly call a  Smart Fellow  Never to pay at the Playhouse is an Act of Frugality that lets you into his Character and his Expedient in sending his Children a begging before they can go are Characteristical Instances that he belongs to this Class I never saw the Gentleman but I know by his Letter he hangs his Cane on his Button and by some Lines of it he should wear redheel'd Shoes which are essential Parts of the Habit belonging to the Order of  Smart Fel∣lows  My Familiar is returned with the following Letter from the  French  King  Versailles  June  Lewis  the Fourteenth to  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SIR  I Have your Epistle and must take the Liberty to say That there has been a Time when there were Generous Spirits in  Great Britain  who would not have suffer'd my Name to be treated with the Familiarity you think fit to use I thought Liberal Men would not be such Time∣servers as to fall upon a Man because his Friends are not in Power But having some Concern for what you may transmit to Posterity con∣cerning me I am willing to keep Terms with you and make a Request to you which is That you would give my Service to the Nineteenth Century if ever you or yours reach to them and tell them That I have settled all Matters between them and me by Monsieur  Boileau  I should be glad to see you here  It is very odd this Prince should offer to invite me into his Dominions or believe I should accept the Invitation No no I remember too well how he served an ingenious Gentleman a Friend of mine whom he locked up in the  Bastile  for no Reason in the World but because he was a Wit and feared he might mention him with Justice in some of his Writings His Way is That all Men of Sense are preferred banished or imprisoned He has indeed a Sort of Justice in him like that of the Gamesters for if a Standerby sees one at Play cheat he has a Right to come in for Shares as knowing the Mysteries of the Game  This is a very wise and just Maxim and if I have not left at Mr  Morphew  's directed to me Bank Bills for  l  on or before this Day Seven∣night I shall tell how  Tom Cash  got his Estate  I expect Three Hundred Pounds of Mr  Soilett  for concealing all the Money he has lent to him∣self and his Landed Friend bound with him at Thirty  per Cent  at his Scrivener's Absolute Prin∣ces make People pay what they please in Defe∣rence to their Power I do not know why I should not

Chocolatehouse  June  My Familiar being come from  France  with an Answer to my Letter to  Lewis  of that Kingdom instead of going on in a Discourse of what he had seen in that Court he put on the imme∣diate Concern of a Guardian and fell to enqui∣ring into my Thoughts and Adventures since his Journey As short as his Stay had been I confess'd I had had many Occasions for his As∣sistance in my Conduct but communicated to him my Thoughts of putting all my Force a∣gainst the horrid and senseless Custom of Duels If it were possible said he to laugh at Things in themselves so deeply Tragical as the imperti∣nent Profusion of Humane Life I think I could  divert you with a Figure I saw just after my Death when the Philosopher threw me as I told you some Days ago into the Pail of Water  You are to know That when Men leave the Body there are Receptacles for them as soon as they depart according to the Manner in which they lived and died At the very Instant that I was killed there came away with me a Spirit which had lost its Body in a Duel We were both examined Me the whole Assem∣bly looked at with Kindness and Pity but at the same Time with an Air of Welcome and Consolation They pronounced me very happy who had died in Innocence and told me a quite different Place was allotted to me than that which was appointed for my Companion there being a great Distance from the Mansions of Fools and Innocents Tho' at the same Time said one of the Ghosts there is a great Affinity between an Idiot who has been so for long Life and a Child who departs before Maturity But this Gentleman who has arrived with you is a Fool of his own making is ignorant out of Choice and will fare accordingly The Assembly began to flock about him and one said to him Sir I observed you came into the Gate of Per∣sons murdered and I desire to know What brought you to your untimely End He said He had been a Second  Socrates  who may be said to have been murdered by the Commonwealth of  Athens  stood by and began to draw near him in order after his Manner to lead him into a Sense of his Error by Concessions in his own Discourse  Sir  said that Divine and Amicable Spirit  What was the Quarrel  He answered  We shall know very suddenly when the Princi∣pal in the Business comes for he was desperately wounded before I fell Sir  said the Sage  Had you an Estate Yes Sir  the new Guest answer∣ed  I have left it in a very good Condition and made my Will the Night before this Occasion  Did you read it before you sign'd it Yes sure Sir said the new Comer  Socrates  replies Could a Man that would not give his Estate without reading the Instrument dispose of his Life with∣out asking a Question That illustrious Shade turned from him and a Crowd of impertinent Goblins who had been Droles and Parasites in their Lifetime and were knock'd on the Head for their Sawciness came about my FellowTraveller and made themselves very merry with Questions about the Words  Cart  and  Terce  and other Terms of Fencers But his Thoughts began to settle into Reflection upon the Adventure which had robbed him of his late Being and with a wretched Sigh said he  How terrible are Conviction and Guilt when they come too late for Penitence  Pacolet  was going on in this Strain but he re∣covered from it and told me  It was too soon to give my Discourse on this Subject so serious a Turn you have chiefly to do with that Part of Mankind which must be led into Reflection by Degrees and you must treat this Custom with Humour and Raillery to get an Audience before you come to pronounce Sentence upon it There is Foundation enough for raising such Entertainments from the Practice on this Occa∣sion Don't you know that often a Man is cal∣led out of Bed to follow implicitly a Coxcomb with whom he would not keep Company on any other Occasion to Ruin and DeathThen a good List of such as are qualified by the Laws of these uncourteous Men of Chivalry to enter into Combat who are often Persons of Honour without common Honesty These I say ran∣ged and drawn up in their proper Order would give an Aversion to doing any Thing in com∣mon  with such as Men laugh at and contemn But to go through this Work you must not let your Thoughts vary or make Excursions from your Theme Consider at the same Time that the Matter has been often treated by the ablest and greatest Writers yet that must not disen∣courage you for the properest Person to handle it is one who has roved into mix'd Conversa∣tions and must have Opportunities which I shall give you of seeing these Sort of Men in their Pleasures and Gratifications among which they pretend to reckon Fighting It was pleasantly enough said of a Bully in  France  when Duels first began to be punished The King has taken away Gaming and Stageplay∣ing and now Fighting too How does he ex∣pect Gentlemen shall divert themselves  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd June  to  Saturd June    White's Chocolatehouse  June  PAcolet  being gone a strolling among the Men of the Sword in order to find out the secret Causes of the frequent Disputes we meet with and furnish me with Materials for my Treatise on Duelling I have Room left to go on in my Information to my Country Readers whereby they may understand the bright Peo∣ple whose Memoirs I have taken upon me to write But in my Discourse of the th of the last Month I omitted to mention the most agreeable of all bad Characters and that is a  Rake  A Rake is a Man always to be pitied and if he lives is one Day certainly reclaimed for  his Faults proceed not from Choice or Inclina∣tion but from strong Passions and Appetites' which are in Youth too violent for the Club of Reason good Sense good Manners and good Nature All which he must have by Nature and Education before he can be allowed to be or have been of this Order He is a poor un∣weildy Wretch that commits Faults out of the Redundance of his good Qualities His Pity and Compassion makes him sometimes a Bub∣ble to all his Fellows let 'em be never so much below him in Understanding His Desires run away with him through the Strength and Force of a lively Imagination which hurries him on to unlawful Pleasures before Reason has Power to come in to his Rescue Thus with all the good Intentions in the World to A∣mendment this Creature sins on against Hea∣ven himself his Friends and his Country who all call for a better Use of his Talents There is not a Being under the Sun so mise∣rable as this He goes on in a Pursuit he him∣self disapproves and has no Enjoyment but what is followed by Remorse no Relief from Remorse but the Repetition of his Crime It's possible I may talk of this Person with too much Indulgence but I must repeat it that I think this a Character which is the most the Object of Pity of any in the World The Man in the Pangs of the Stone Gout or any acute Distem∣pers is not in so deplorable a Condition in the Eye of right Sense as he that errs and repents and repents and errs on The Fellow with bro∣ken Limbs justly deserves your Alms for his impotent Condition but he that can't use his own Reason is in a much worse State for you see him in miserable Circumstances with his Remedy at the same Time in his own Possession if he would or could use it This is the Cause  that of all ill Characters the Rake has the best Quarter in the World for when he is himself and unruffled with Intemperance you see his natural Faculties exert themselves and attract an Eye of Favour towards his Infirmities  But if we look round us here how many dull Rogues are there that would fain be what this poor Man hates himself for All the Noise towards Six in the Evening is caused by his Mimicks and Imitators How ought Men of Sense to be careful of their Actions if it were meerly from the Indignation of seeing them∣selves ill drawn by such little Pretenders Not to say he that leads is guilty of all the Actions of his Followers And a Rake has Imitators whom you would never expect should prove soSecondhand Vice sure of all is the most nause∣ous There is hardly a Folly more absurd or which seems less to be accounted for tho' 'tis what we see every Day than that grave and honest Natures give into this Way and at the same Time have good Sense if they thought fit to use it But the Fatality under which most Men labour of desiring to be what they are not makes 'em go out of a Method in which they might be received with Applause and would certainly excel into one wherein they will all their Life have the Air of Strangers to what they aim at  For this Reason I have not lamented the Me∣tamorphosis of any one I know so much as of  No∣bilis  who was born with Sweetness of Temper just Apprehension and every Thing else that might make him a Man fit for his Order But instead of the Pursuit of sober Studies and Ap∣plications in which he would certainly be capa∣ble of making a considerable Figure in the noblest Assembly of Men in the World I say in spight of that good Nature which is his proper Bent  he will say illnatured Things aloud put such as he was and still should be out of Countenance and drown all the natural Good in him to re∣ceive an artificial ill Character in which he will never succeed For  Nobilis  is no Rake He may guzzle as much Wine as he pleases talk Bawdy if he thinks fit but he may as well drink Wa∣tergruel and go twice a Day to Church for it will never do I pronounce it again  Nobilis  is no Rake To be of that Order he must be vi∣cious against his Will and not so by Study or Application All Pretty Fellows are also excluded to a Man as well as all Inamaratoes or Persons of the Epicene Gender who gaze at one another in the Presence of Ladies This Class of which I am giving you an Account is pretended to also by Men of strong Abilities in Drinking tho' they are such whom the Liquor not the Conversation keeps together But Blockheads may roar fight and stab and be never the nearer their Labour is also lost they want Sense They are no Rakes  As a Rake among Men is the Man who lives in the constant Abuse of his Reason so a Co∣quet among Women is one who lives in con∣tinual Misapplication of her Beauty The chief of all whom I have the Honour to be acquain∣ted with is pretty Mrs  Toss  She is ever in Practice of something which disfigures her and takes from her Charms tho' all she does tends to a contrary Effect She has naturally a very agreeable Voice and Utterance which she has chang'd for the prettiest Lisp imaginable She sees what she has a Mind to see at half a Mile Distance but poring with her Eyes half shut at every one she passes by she believes much more becoming The  Cupid  on her Fan and she have their Eyes full on each other all the Time in which they are not both in Motion When∣ever her Eye is turned from that dear Object  you may have a Glance and your Bow if she is in Humour returned as civilly as you make it but that must not be in the Presence of a Man of greater Quality For Mrs  Toss  is so throughly well bred that the chief Person pre∣sent has all her Regards And she who gig∣gles at Divine Service and laughs at her very Mother can compose her self at the Approach of a Man of a good Estate  Will's Coffeehouse  June  A fine Lady shewed a Gentleman of this Com∣pany for an eternal Answer to all his Addresses a Paper of Verses with which she is so capti∣vated that she profess'd the Author should be the happy Man in Spite of all other Pretenders It is ordinary for Love to make Men Poetical and it had that Effect on this enamour'd Man But he was resolved to try his Vein upon some of her Confidents or Retinue before he ventured upon so high a Theme as her self To do other∣wise than so would be like making an Heroick Poem a Man's first Attempt Among the Fa∣vourites to the Fair One he found her Parrat not to be in the last Degree He saw  Poll  had her Ear when his Sighs were neglected To write against him had been a fruitless Labour therefore he resolved to flatter him into his Inte∣rests in the following Manner  To a Lady on her Parrat  When Nymphs were coy and Love could not prevail  The Gods disguis'd were seldom known to fail  Leda  was chast but yet a Feather'd  Jove  Surpriz'd the Fair and taught her how to love  There's no Celestial but his Heav'n wou  d quit  For any Form which might to thee admit  See how the wanton Bird at every Glance  Swells his glad Plumes and feels an am'rous Trunce  The Queen of Beauty has forsook the Dove  Henceforth the Parrat be the Bird of Love  It is indeed a very just Proposition to give that Honour rather to the Parrat than the other Volatile The Parrat represents us in the State of making Love The Dove in the Possession of the Object beloved But instead of turning the Dove off I fancy it would be better if the Chaise of  Venus  had hereafter a Parrat added as we see sometimes a Third Horse to a Coach which might intimate That to be a Parrat is the only Way to succeed and to be a Dove to preserve your Conquests If the Swain would go on successfully he must imitate the Bird he writes upon For he who would be loved by Women must never be silent before the Favour or open his Lips after it  From my own Apartment  June  I have so many Messages from young Gentle∣men who expect Preferment and Distinction that I am wholly at a Loss in what Manner to acquit my self The Writer of the following Letter tells me in a Postscript he cannot go out of Town till I have taken some Notice of him and is very urgent to be some Body in it before he returns to his Commons at the University But take it from himself  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Monitor General of  Great Britain  SheerLane  June  SIR  I Have been above Months from the University of Age these Months and so long in Town I was recommended to one  Charles Bubbleboy  near the  Temple  who has supply'd me with all the Furniture he says a Gentleman ought to have I desired a Certificate thereof from him which he said would require some Time to consider of and when I went Yesterday Morning for it he tells me upon due Consideration I still want some few odd  Things more to the Value of Threescore or Four∣score Pounds to make me compleat I have bespoke them and the Favour I beg of you is to know when I am equip'd in what Part or Class of Men in this Town you will place me Pray send me Word what I am and you shall find me  SIR  Your most humble Servant  Jeffry Nicknack  I am very willing to encourage young Begin∣ners but am extreamly in the Dark how to dispose of this Gentleman I cannot see either his Person or Habit in this Letter but I'll call at  Charles  's and know the Shape of his SnuffBox by which I can settle his Character Tho' indeed to know his full Capacity I ought to be inform'd whether he takes  Spanish  or  Mu∣sty

N  o    From  Saturd June  to  Tuesd June    White's Chocolatehouse  June  I Had suspended the Business of Duelling to a distant Time but that I am called upon to declare my self on a Point proposed in the fol∣lowing Letter  June at Night  SIR  I Desire the Favour of you to decide this Questi∣on Whether calling a Gentleman a  Smart Fellow  is an Affront or not A Youth entring a certain Coffeehouse with his Cane tied at his Button wearing redheel'd Shoes I thought of your Description and could not forbear telling a Friend of mine next to me There enters a Smart Fellow The Gentleman hearing it had immedi∣ately a Mind to pick a Quarrel with me and desi∣red Satisfaction At which I was more puzzled than at the other remembring what Mention your Familiar makes of those that had lost their Lives on such Occasions The Thing is referred to your  Judgment and I expect you to be my Second since you have been the Cause of our Quarrel I am  SIR  Your Friend and humble Servant  I absolutely pronounce that there is no Oc∣casion of Offence given in this Expression for a  Smart Fellow  is always an Appellation of Praise and is a Man of double Capacity The true Cast or Mould in which you may be sure to know him is when his Livelihood or Edu∣cation is in the Civil List and you see him ex∣press a Vivacity or Mettle above the Way he is in by a little Jerk in his Motion short Trip in his Steps wellfancied Lining of his Coat or any other Indications which may be given in a vigorous Dress Now What possible Insinuati∣on can there be that 'tis a Cause of Quarrel for a Man to say he allows a Gentleman really to be what he his Taylor his Hosier and his Millener have conspired to make him I con∣fess if this Person who appeals to me had said He was  not a Smart Fellow  there had been Cause for Resentment but if he stands to it that he is one he leaves no Manner of Ground for a Misunderstanding Indeed it is a most lamentable Thing that there should be a Dispure raised upon a Man's saying another is what he plainly takes Pains to be thought  But this Point connot be so well adjusted as by enquiring what are the Sentiments of wise Nati∣ons and Communities of the Use of the Sword and from thence conclude Whether it is ho∣nourable to draw it so frequently or not An Illustrious Commonwealth of  Italy  has preser∣ved it self for many Ages without letting one of their Subjects handle this destructive Instru∣ment always leaving that Work to such of Mankind as understand the Use of a whole Skin  so little as to make a Profession of exposing it to Cuts and Scars  But what need we run to such Foreign Instan∣ces Our most ancient and wellgoverned Cities are conspicuous Exemples to all Mankind in their Regulation of Military Atchievements The chief Citizens like the noble  Italians  hire Mer∣cenaries to carry Arms in their Stead and you shall have a Fellow of a desperate Fortune for the Gain of one HalfCrown go through all the Dangers of  TuttleFields  or the  ArtilleryGround  clap his Right Jaw within Two Inches of the Touchhole of a Musquet fire it off and Huzza with as little Concern as he tears a Pullet Thus you see to what Scorn of Danger these Merce∣naries arrive out of a meer Love of sordid Gain But methinks it should take off the strong Prepossession Men have in Favour of bold Actions when they see upon what low Mo∣tives Men aspire to 'em Do but observe the common Practice in the Government of those Heroick Bodies our Militia and Lieutenancies the most ancient Corps of Soldiers perhaps in the Universe I question Whether there is one Instance of an Animosity between any Two of these illustrious Sons of  Mars  since their Institu∣tion which was decided by Combat I remem∣ber indeed to have read the Chronicle of an Ac∣cident which had like to have occasiond Blood∣shed in the very Field before all the General Offi∣cers tho' most of them were Justices of the Peace Captain  Crabtree  of  BirchingLane  Haber∣dasher had drawn a Bill upon MajorGeneral  Mag∣got  Cheesemonger in  Thamesstreet Crabtree  draws this upon Mr  William Maggot  and  Compa∣ny  A Country Lad receiv'd this Bill and not understanding the Word  Company  us'd in draw∣ing Bills on Men in Partnership carried it to Mr  Jeffrey Stitch  of  CrookedLane  Lieutenant of  the MajorGeneral's Company whom he had the Day before seen march by the Door in all the Pomp of his Commission The Lieutenant accepts it for the Honour of the Company since it had come to him But Repayment be∣ing ask'd from the MajorGeneral he absolute∣ly refuses Upon this the Lieutenant thinks of nothing less than to bring this to a Rupture and takes for his Second  Tobias Armstrong  of the  Counter  and sends him with a Challenge in a Scrip of Parchment wherein was written  Stitch contra Maggot  and all the Fury vanish'd in a Moment The MajorGeneral gives Satisfaction to the Second and all was well  Hence it is that the bold Spirits of our City are kept in such Subjection to the Civil Power Otherwise Where would our Liberties soon be If Wealth and Valour were suffer'd to exert them∣selves with their utmost Force If such Officers as are employed in the terrible Bands above∣mentioned were to draw Bills as well as Swords These dangerous Captains who could victual an Army as well as lead it would be too powerful for the State But the Point of Honour justly gives Way to that of Gain and by long and wise Regulation the richest is the bravest Man I have known a Captain rise to a Colonel in Two Days by the Fall of Stocks and a Major my good Friend near the  Monu∣ment  ascended to that Honour by the Fall of the Price of Spirits and the Rising of right  Nantz  By this true Sense of Honour that Bo∣dy of Warriors are ever in good Order and Dis∣cipline with their Colours and Coats all whole As in other Battalions where their Principles of Action are less solid you see the Men of Ser∣vice look like Spectres with long Sides and lank Cheeks In this Army you may measure a Man's Services by his Waste and the most  prominent Belly is certainly the Man who has been most upon Action Besides all this there is another excellent Remark to be made in the Discipline of these Troops It being of abso∣lute Necessity that the People of  England  should see what they have for their Money and be Eyewitnesses of the Advantages they gain by it all Battles which are fought abroad are re∣presented here But since one Side must be beaten and the other conquer which might create Disputes the eldest Company is always to make the other run and the younger retreats according to the last News and best Intelli∣gence I have my self seen Prince  Eugene  make  Catinat  fly from the Backside of  GraysInnLane  to  Hockley in the Hole  and not give over the Pursuit till obliged to leave the  BearGar∣den  on the Right to avoid being borne down by Fencers Wild Bulls and Monsters too terri∣ble for the Encounter of any Heroes but such whose Lives are their Livelihood  We have here seen that wise Nations do not admit of Fighting even in the Defence of their Country as a laudable Action and they live within the Walls of our own City in great Ho∣nour and Reputation without it It would be very necessary to understand by what Force of the Climate Food Education or Employment one Man's Sense is brought to differ so essenti∣ally from that of another that one is ridiculous and contemptible for forbearing a Thing which makes for his Safety and another applauded for consulting his Ruin and Destruction  It will therefore be necessary for us to show our Travelling to examine this Subject fully and tell you how it comes to pass That a Man of Honour in  Spain  tho' you offend him never so gallantly stabs you basely in  England  tho' you offend never so basely challenges fairly  The former kills you out of Revenge the latter out of good Breeding But to probe the Heart of Man in this Particular to its utmost Thoughts and Recesses I must wait for the Return of  Pa∣celet  who is now attending a Gentleman lately in a Duel and sometimes visits the Person by whose Hand he received his Wounds  St James's Coffeehouse  June  Letters from  Vienna  of the th Instant say there has been a Journal of the Marches and Actions of the King of  Sweden  from the Begin∣ning of  January  to the th of  April N S  com∣municated by the  Swedish  Ministers to that Court These Advices inform That his  Swedish  Majesty entered the Territories of  Muscovy  in  February  last with the main Body of his Army in order to oblige the Enemy to a general Engagement but that the  Muscovites  declining a Battle and an universal Thaw having rendred the Rivers unpassable the King returned into  Ukrania  There are mentioned several Rencounters be∣tween considerable Detachments of the  Swedish  and  Russian  Armies Marshal  Heister  intended to take his Leave of the Court on the Day after the Date of these Letters and put himself at the Head of the Army in  Hungary  The Malecon∣tents had attempted to send in a Supply of Pro∣visions into  Newhausel  but their Design was disappointed by the  Germans  Advices from  Berlin  of the th Instant  N S  say That his  Danish  Majesty having receiv'd an Invitation from the King of  Prussia  to an Inter∣view designed to come to  Potsdam  within few Days and that King  Augustus  resolved to ac∣company him thither To avoid all Difficulties in Ceremony the Three Kings and all the Company who shall have the Honour to sit with them at Table are to draw Lots and take Pre∣cedence accordingly  They write from  Hamburgh  of the th In∣stant  N S  That some particular Letters from  Dantzick  speak of a late Action between the  Swedes  and  Muscovites  near  Jeroslaw  but that Engagement being mentioned from no other Place there is not much Credit given to this Intelligence  We hear from  Brussels  by Letters dated the th That on the th in the Evening the Duke of  Marlborough  and Prince  Eugene  arrived at  Courtray  with a Design to proceed the Day fol∣lowing to  Liste  in the Neighbourhood of which City the Confederate Army was to rendezvous the same Day Advices from  Paris  inform us that the Marshal  de Bezons  is appointed to com∣mand in  Dauphine  and that the Duke of  Berwick  is set out for  Spain  with a Design to follow the Fortunes of the Duke of  Anjou  in case the  French  King should comply with the late De∣mands of the Allies  The Court of  France  has sent a Circular Let∣ter to all the Governours of the Provinces to re∣commend to their Consideration his Majesty's late Conduct in the Affair of Peace It is thought fit in that Epistle to condescend to a certain Appeal to the People Whether it is consistent with the Dignity of the Crown or the  French  Name to submit to the Preliminaties demanded by the Confederates That Letter dwells upon the Unreasonableness of the Allies in requi∣ring his Majesty's Assistance in dethroning his Grandson and treats this Particular in Lan∣guage more suitable to it as it is a Topick of Oratory than a real Circumstance on which the Interests of Nations and Reasons of State which affect all  Europe  are concern'd  The Close of this Memorial seems to prepare the People to expect all Events attributing the Confidence of the Enemy to the Goodness of their  Troops but acknowledging that his sole Depen∣dance is upon the Intervention of Providence  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd June  to  Thursd June    White's Chocolatehouse  June  HAving a very solid Respect for humane Na∣ture however it is distorted from its na∣tural Make by Affectation Humour Custom Misfortune or Vice I do apply my self to my Friends to help me in raising Arguments for preserving it in all its Individuals as long as it is permitted To one of my Letters on this Sub∣ject I have received the following Answer  SIR  IN Answer to your Question Why Men of Sense Virtue and Experience are seen still to comply with that ridiculous Custom of Duelling I must desire you to reflect that Custom has disb'd up in Ruffs the wisest Heads of our Ancestors and put the best of the present Age into huge Falbala Pe∣riwigs Men of Sense would not impose such In∣cumbrances on themselves but be glad they might show their Faces decently in Publick upon easier Terms If then such Men app  ar reasonably Slaves to the Fashion in what rega  ds the Figure of their Persons me ought not to wonder that they are at least so in what seems to touch their Reputations B  sides you can't be ignorant that Dress and Chivalry have been always encouraged by the La∣dies as the Two principal Branches of Gallantry 'Tis to avoid being sneer'd at for his Singularity and from a Desire to appear more agreeable to his Mistress that a wise experienced and polite Man  complices with the Dress commonly received and is prevailed upon to violate his Reason and Prin∣ciples in hazarding his Life and Estate by a Tilt as well as suffering his Pleasures to be con∣strained and sowred by the constant Apprehension of a Quarrel This is the more surprising be∣cause Men of the most delicate Sense and Princi∣ples have naturally in other Cases a particular Repugnance in accommodating themselves to the Maxims of the World But one may easily di∣stinguish the Man that is affected with Beauetry and the Reputation of a Tilt from him who com∣plies with both meerly as they are imposed upon him by Custom for in the former you'll remark an Air of Vanity and Triumph whereas when the latter appears in a long Duvillier full of Powder or has decided a Quarrel by the Sword you may perceive in his Face that he appeals to Custom for an Excuse I think it may not be improper to enquire into the Genealogy of this Chimerical Monster called a  Duel  which I take to be an illegitimate Species of the ancient KnightErrantry By the Laws of this Whim your He∣roick Person or Man of Gallantry was indispen∣sibly obliged to starve in Armour a certain Num∣ber of Years in the Chase of Monsters encounter them at the Peril of his Life and suffer great Hardships in order to gain the Affection of the Fair Lady and qualifie himself for assuming the  B  lleAir  that is of a Pretty Fellow or Man of Honour according to the Fashion But since the Publishing of Don  Quixot  and Extinction of the Race of Dragons which  Suetonius  says happen'd in that of  Wantley  the gallant and heroick Spi∣rits of these latter Times have been under the Ne∣cessity of creating new Chimerical Monsters to en∣tertain themselves with by Way of single Com∣bat as the only Proofs they are able to give their own Sex and the Ladies that they are in all  Poin's Men of nice Honour But to do Justice to the ancient and real Monsters I must observe that they never molested those who were not of a Hu∣mour to Hunt for them in the Woods and Desarts whereas on the contrary our modern Monsters are so familiarly admitted and entertained in all the Courts and Cities of  Europe  except  France  that one can scarce be in the most humaniz'd Society without risquing ones Life the People of the best Sort and the fine Gentlemen of the Age being so fond of 'em that they seldom appear in any pub∣lick Place without one I have some further Con∣siderations upon this Subject which as you encou∣rage me shall be communicated to you by Sir a Cousin but once removed from the best Family of the  Staffs  namely  SIR  Your humble Servant Kinsman and Friend  Tim Switch  It is certain Mr  Switch  has hit upon the true Source of this Evil and that it proceeds only from the Force of Custom that we contradict our selves in half the Particulars and Occurrences of Life But such a Tyranny in Love which the Fair impose upon us is a little too severe that we must demonstrate our Affection for 'em by no certain Proof but Hatred to one another or come at them only as one does to an Estate by Sur∣vivorship This Way of Application to gain a Lady's Heart is taking her as we do Towns and Castles by distressing the Place and letting none come near 'em without our Pass Were such a Lover once to write the Truth of his Heart and let her know his whole Thoughts he would appear indeed to have a Passion for her but it would hardly be called Love The BilletDeux would run to this Purpose  Madam  I Have so tender a Regard for you and your Interests that I'll knock any Man in the Head whom I observe to be of my Mind and like you Mr  Truman  the other Day look'd at you in so languishing a Manner that I am resolved to run him through to morrow Morn∣ing This I think he deserves for his Guilt in admiring you than which I cannot have a greater Reason for murdering him except it be that you also approve him Whoever says he dies for you I will make his Words good for I will kill him I am  Madam  Your most Obedient Most Humble Servant  From my own Apartment  June  I am just come hither at Ten at Night and have ever since Six been in the most celebrated though most nauseous Company in Town The Two Leaders of the Society were a Critick and a Wit These Two Gentlemen are great Opponents upon all Occasions not discerning that they are the nearest each other in Temper and Talents of any Two Classes of Men in the World for to profess Judgment and to profess Wit both arise from the same Failure which is Want of Judgment The Poverty of the Critick this Way proceeds from the Abuse of his Faculty that of the Wit from the Neglect of it It's a particular Observation I have al∣ways made That of all Morrals a Critick is the silliest for by inuring himself to examine all Things whether they are of Consequence or not he never looks upon any Thing but with a Design of passing Sentence upon it by which Means he is never a Companion  but always a Censor This makes him earnest upon Trifles and dispute on the most indiffe∣rent Occasions with Vehemence If he offers to speak or write that Talent which should approve the Work of the other Faculties pre∣vents their Operation He comes upon Action in Armour but without Weapons He stands in Safety but can gain no Glory The Wit on the other Hand has been hurried so long away by Imagination only that Judgment seems not to have ever been one of his natural Faculties This Gentleman takes himself to be as much obliged to be merry as the other to be grave A thorough Critick is a Sort of Puritan in the polite World As an Enthusiast in Religion stumbles at the ordinary Occurrences of Life if he cannot quote Scripture Examples on the Occasion so the Critick is never safe in his Speech or Writing without he has among the celebrated Writers an Authority for the Truth of his Sentence You will believe we had a very good Time with these Brethren who were so far out of the Dress of their native Country and so lost to its Dialect that they were as much Strangers to themselves as to their Relation to each other They took up the whole Discourse sometimes the Critick grew passionate and when reprimanded by the Wit for any Trip or Hesitation in his Voice he would answer Mr  Dryden  makes such a Cha∣racter on such an Occasion break off in the same Manner so that the Stop was according to Nature and as a Man in a Passion should do The Wit who is as far gone in Letters as himself seems to be at a Loss to answer such an Apology and concludes only that though his Anger is justly vented it wants Fire in the Utterance If Wit is to be measured by the Circumstances of Time and Place there is no  Man has generally so little of that Talent as he who is a Wit by Profession What he says instead of arising from the Occasion has an Occasion invented to bring it in Thus he is new for no other Reason but that he talks like no Body else but has taken up a Method of his own without Commerce or Dialogue with other People The lively  Jasper Dactyle  is one of this Character He seems to have made a Vow to be witty to his Life's End When you meet him What do you think says he I have been entertaining my self with Then out comes a premeditated Turn to which 'tis to no Purpose to answer for he goes on in the same Strain of Thought he designed without your speaking Therefore I have a general Answer to all he can say as  Sure there never was any Creature had so much Fire Spondee  who is a Critick is seldom out of this fine Man's Company They have no Manner of Affection for each other but keep together like  Novell  and  Oldfox  in the  PlainDealer  because they show each other I know several of Sense who can be diverted with this Couple but I see no Curiosity in the Thing except it be that  Spondee  is dull and seems dull but  Da∣ctyle  is heavy with a brisk Face It must be own'd also that  Dactyle  has almost Vigour enough to be a Coxcomb but  Spondee  by the Lowness of his Constitution is only a Block∣head  St James's Coffeehouse  June  We have no Particulars of Moment since our last except it be that the Copy of the following Original Letter came by the Way of  Ostend  It is said to have been found in the Closet of Monsieur  Chamillard  the late Se∣cretary of State of  France  since his Disgrace It was signed by Two Brothers of the fa∣mous  Cavalier  who led the  Cevennois  and had a Personal Interview with the King as well as a Capitulation to lay down his Arms and leave the Dominions of  France  There are many other Names to it among whom is the Chief of the Family of the Marquis  Guis∣card  It is not yet known whether Monsieur  Chamillard  had any real Design to favour the Protestant Interest or only thought to place himself at the Head of that People to make himself considerable enough to oppose his Ene∣mies at Court and reinstate himself in Power there  SIR  WE have read your Majesty's  Soon after the Conclusion of the late Treaty of Peace the  French  King dispers'd a Letter through his Dominions wherein he shows the Reasons why he could not ratifie the Preliminaries  Vide  the publick NewsPapers of this Date  Letter to the Governours of your Provinces with Instructions what Sentiments to insinu∣ate into the Minds of your People But as you have always acted upon the Maxim That we were made for you and not you for us we must take Leave to assure your Majesty that we are exactly of the contrary Opinion and must desire you to send for your Grandson Home and acquaint him that you now know by Experience Absolute Power is only a Ver∣tigo in the Brain of Princes which for a Time may quicken their Motion and double in their diseas'd Sight the Instances of Power above 'em but must end in their Fall and Destruction Your Memorial speaks a good Father of your Family but a very ill one of your People Your Majesty is reduced to hear  Truth when you are oblig'd to speak it There is no governing any but Savages by other Methods than their own Consent which you seem to acknowledge in appealing to us for our Opinion of your Conduct in treating of Peace Had your People been always of your Council the King of  France  had never been reduced so low as to acknowledge his Arms were fall'n into Contempt But since it is thus we must ask How is any Man of  France  but they of the House of  Bourbon  the better that  Philip  is King of  Spain  We have out∣grown that Folly of placing our Happiness in your Majesty's being call'd  The Great  There∣fore as you and we are all alike  NB  Mons  Bernard  and the chief Banker of  France  became Bankrupts about this Time  Bankrupts and undone let us not deceive our selves but compound with our Adversaries and not talk like their Equals Your Majesty must forgive us that we cannot wish you Success or lend you Help for if you lose one Battle more we may have an Hand in the Peace you make and doubt not but your Majesty's Faith in Treaties will require the Ratification of the States of your Kingdoms So we bid you heartily farewel till we have the Honour to meet you assembled in Parliament This happy Expectation makes us willing to wait the Event of another Campagne from whence we hope to be raised from the Mise y of Slaves to the Privileges of Subjects We are  Your Majesty's Truly Faithful and Loyal Subjects  c  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd June  to  Saturd June    From my own Apartment  June  THE Vigilance the Anxiety the Tender∣ness which I have for the good People of  England  I am perswaded will in Time be much commended but I doubt whether they will ever be rewarded However I must go on chearfully in my Work of Reformation That being my great Design I am studious to prevent my Labour's increasing upon me therefore am particularly observant of the Temper and Incli∣nations of Childhood and Youth that we may not give Vice and Folly Supplies from the grow∣ing Generation It is hardly to be imagined how useful this Study is and what great Evils or Benefits arise from putting us in our tender Years to what we are fit or unfit Therefore on  Tuesday  last with a Design to sound their Incli∣nations I took Three Lads who are under my Guardianship a rambling in a HackneyCoach to show them the Town as the Lions the Tombs  Bedlam  and the other Places which are Entertainments to raw Minds because they strike forcibly on the Fancy The Boys are Bro∣thers one of Sixteen the other of Fourteen the other of Twelve The First was his Father's Darling the Second his Mother's and the Third is mine who am their Uncle Mr  William  is a Lad of true Genius but being at the upper End of a great School and having all the Boys below him his Arrogance is insupportable If I begin to show a little of my  Latin  he imme∣diately interrupts Uncle under Favour that which you say is not understood in that Manner  Brother says my Boy  Jack  You do not show your Manners much in contradicting my Unkle  Isaac  You queer Cur says Mr  William  Do you think my Uncle takes any Notice of such a dull Rogue as you are Mr  William  goes on He is the most stupid of all my Mother's Chil∣dren He knows nothing of his Book When he should mind that he is hiding or hoard∣ing his Taws and Marbles or laying up Far∣things His Way of Thinking is Four and twen∣ty Farthings make Sixpence and Two Sixpences a Shilling Two Shillings and Sixpence Half a Crown and Two HalfCrowns Five Shillings So within these Two Months the close Hunks has scrap'd up Twenty Shillings and we'll make him spend it all before he comes Home  Jack  immediately claps his Hands into both Pockets and turns as pale as Ashes There is nothing touches a Parent and such I am to  Jack  so near∣ly as a provident Conduct This Lad has in him the true Temper for a good Husband a kind Fa∣ther and an honest Executor All the great People you see make considerable Figures on the Change in Court and sometimes in Senates are such as in Reality have no greater Faculty than what may be called Humane Instinct which is a natural Tendency to their own Preservation and that of their Friends without being capable of striking out of the Road for Adventures There's Sir  William Scrip  was of this Sort of Capacity from his Childhood He has bought the Country round him and makes a Bargain better than Sir  Harry Wildfire  with all his Wit and Humour Sir  Harry  never wants Money but he comes to  Scrip  laughs at him half an Hour and then gives Bond for t'other Thou∣sand The close Men are incapable of placing Merit any where but in their Pence and there∣fore gain it while others who have larger Ca∣pacities  are diverted from the Pursuit by Enjoy∣ments which can be supported only by that Cash which they despise and therefore are in the End Slaves to their Inferiors both in Fortune and Understanding I once heard a Man of ex∣cellent Sense observe That more Affairs in the World failed by being in the Hands of Men of too large Capacities for their Business than by being in the Conduct of such as wanted Abili∣ties to execute them  Jack  therefore being of a plodding Make shall be a Citizen and I de∣sign him to be the Refuge of the Family in their Distress as well as their Jest in Prosperity His Brother  Will  shall go to  Oxford  with all Speed where if he does not arrive at being a Man of Sense he will soon be informed wherein he is a Coxcomb There is in that Place such a true Spirit of Raillery and Humour that if they can't make you a wise Man they will certainly let you know you are a Fool which is all my Cousin wants to cease to be so Thus ha∣ving taken these Two out of the Way I have Leisure to look at my Third Lad I observe in the young Rogue a natural Subtilty of Mind which discovers it self rather in forbearing to declare his Thoughts on any Occasion than in any visible Way of exerting himself in Dis∣course For which Reason I will place him where if he commits no Faults he may go fur∣ther than those in other Stations though they excel in Virtues The Boy is well fashioned and will easily fall into a graceful Manner wherefore I have a Design to make him a Page to a great Lady of my Acquaintance by which Means he will be well skill'd in the common Modes of Life and make a greater Progress in the World by that Knowledge than with the greatest Qualities without it A good Mien in a Court will carry a Man greater Lengths than  a good Understanding in any other Place We see a World of Pains taken and the best Years of Life spent in collecting a Set of Thoughts in a College for the Conduct of Life and after all the Man so qualified shall hesitate in his Speech to a good Suit of Clothes and want common Sense before an agreeable Woman Hence it is that Wisdom Valour Justice and Learning can't keep a Man in Countenance that is possessed with these Excellencies if he wants that infe∣rior Art of Life and Behaviour call'd Good Breeding A Man endow'd with great Perfecti∣ons without this is like one who has his Pockets full of Gold but always wants Change for his ordinary Occasions  Will Courtly  is a living Instance of this Truth and has had the same Education which I am gi∣ving my Nephew He never spoke a Thing but what was said before and yet can converse with the wittiest Men without being ridiculous Among the Learned he does not appear igno∣rant nor with the Wise indiscreet Living in Conversation from his Infancy makes him no where at a Loss and a long Familiarity with the Persons of Men is in a Manner of the same Ser∣vice to him as if he knew their Arts As Cere∣mony is the Invention of wise Men to keep Fools at a Distance so good Breeding is an Expedient to make Fools and wise Men Equals  Will's Coffeehouse  June  The Suspension of the Playhouse has made me have nothing to send you from hence but cal∣ling here this Evening I found the Party I usu∣ally sit with upon the Business of Writing and examining what was the handsomest Style in which to address Women and write Letters of Gallantry Many were the Opinions which were immediately declared on this Subject Some were for a certain Softness some for I  know not what Delicacy others for something inexpressibly Tender When it came to me I said there was no Rule in the World to be made for writing Letters but that of being as near what you speak Face to Face as you can which is so great a Truth that I am of Opinion Wri∣ting has lost more Mistresses than any one Mi∣stake in the whole Legend of Love For when you write to a Lady for whom you have a solid and honourable Passion the great Idea you have of her join'd to a quick Sense of her Absence fills your Mind with a Sort of Tenderness that gives your Language too much the Air of Complaint which is seldom successful For a Man may flat∣ter himself as he pleases but he will find that the Women have more Understanding in their own Affairs than we have and Women of Spirit are not to be won by Mourners He that can keep handsomely within Rules and support the Car∣riage of a Companion to his Mistress is much more likely to prevail than he who lets her see the whole Relish of his Life depends upon her If possible therefore divert your Mistress rather than sigh to her The pleasant Man she will de∣sire for her own Sake but the languishing Lo∣ver has nothing to hope from but her Pity To shew the Difference I produced two Letters  Lady gave me which had been writ by two Gen¦tlemen who pretended to her but were bot  kill'd the next Day after the Date at the Batt  of  Almonza  One of them was a mercurial ga  humour'd Man the other a Man of a serious b  a great and gallant Spirit Poor  Jack Careles  This is his Letter You see how it is folded T  Air of it is so negligent one might have re  half of it by peeping into it without breaking  open He had no Exactness  MADAM  IT is a very pleasant Circumstance I am in that while I should be thinking of the good Company we are to meet within a Day or two where we shall go to Loggerheads my Thoughts are running upon a Fair Enemy in  England  I was in Hopes I had left you there but you follow the Camp tho' I have endea∣voured to make some of our Leaguer Ladies drive you out of the Field All my Comfort is you are more troublesome to my Colonel than my self I permit you to visit me only now and then but he downright keeps you I laugh at his Honour as far as his Gravity will allow me But I know him to be a Man of too much Merit to succeed with a Woman Therefore defend your Heart as well as you can I shall come Home this Winter irresisti∣bly dress'd and with quite a new Foreign Air And so I had like to say I rest but alas I re∣main  Madam  Your most Obedient Most Humble Servant  John Careless  Now for Colonel  Constant  's Epistle you see it is folded and directed with the utmost Care  MADAM  I Do my self the Honour to write to you this Evening because I believe to Morrow will be a Day of Battle and something forebodes in my Breast that I shall fall in it If it proves so I hope you will hear I have done nothing  below a Man who had the Love of his Coun∣try quickened by a Passion for a Woman of Honour If there be any Thing noble in go∣ing to a certain Death if there be any Merit that I meet it with Pleasure by promising my self a Place in your Esteem if your Applause when I am no more is preferable to the most glorious Life without you I say Madam If any of these Considerations can have Weight with you you will give me a kind Place in your Memory which I prefer to the Glory of  Caesar  I hope this will be read as it is writ with Tears  The beloved Lady is a Woman of a sensible Mind but she has confess'd to me that after all her true and solid Value for  Constant  she had much more Concern for the Loss of  Careless  Those noble and serious Spirits have something equal to the Adversities they meet with and con∣sequently lessen the Objects of Pity Great Acci∣dents seem not cut out so much for Men of fami∣liar Characters which makes them more easily pitied and soon after beloved Add to this that the Sort of Love which generally succeeds is a Stranger to Awe and Distance I asked  Romana  Whether of the Two she should have chosen had they survived She said She knew she ought to have taken  Constant  but believed she should have chosen  Careless  St James's Coffeehouse  June  Letters from  Lisbon  of the th Instant  N S  say That the Enemy's Army having block'd up  Olivenza  was posted on the  Guadiana  The  Portuguese  are very apprehensive that the Garri∣son of that Place tho' it consists of five of the best Regiments of their Army will be obliged to surrender if not timely relieved they not being supplied with Provisions for more than Six  Weeks Hereupon their Generals held a Coun∣cil of War on the th Instant wherein it was concluded to advance towards  Badajos  With this Design the Army decamped on the th from  Jerumena  and marched to  Cancaon  'Tis hoped that if the Enemy follow their Motions they may have Opportunity to put a sufficient Quantity of Provision and Ammunition into  Olivenza  Mr  Bickerstaff  gives Notice to all Persons that dress themselves as they please without Regard to Decorum as with blue and red Stockings in Mourn∣ing tuck'd Cravats and Nightcap Wigs before People of the First Quality That he has yet recei∣ved no Fine for indulging them in that Liberty and that he expects their Compliance with this De∣mand or that they go Home immediately and shift themselves This is further to acquaint the Town That the Report of the Hosiers Toymen and Milleners having compounded with Mr  Bicker∣staff  for tolerating such Enormities is utterly false and scandalous  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturday June  to  Tuesd June    Grecian Coffeehouse  June  IN my Dissertation against the Custom of sin∣gle Combat it has been objected that there is not Learning or much Reading shown therein which is the very Life and Soul of all Treatises for which Reason being always easy to receive Admonitions and reform my Errors I thought fit to consult this learned  Board on the Subject Upon proposing some Doubts and desiring their Assistance a very hopeful young Gentleman my Relation who is to be called to the Bar within a Year and an half at farthest told me That he had ever since I first mentioned Duelling turned his Head that Way and that he was principally moved thereto because he designed to follow the Cir∣cuits in the North of  England  and the South of  Scotland  and to reside mostly at his own Estate at  Landbadernawz  in  Cardiganshire  The Nor∣thern  Britains  and the Southern  Scots  are a warm People and the  Welsh a Nation of Gentlemen  so that it behov'd him to understand well the Science of Quarrelling The young Gentleman proceeded admirably well and gave the Board an Account that he had read  Fitzherbert  's  Grand Abridgment  and had found that Duelling is a very ancient Part of the Law For when a Man is sued be it for his Life or his Land the Person that joins the Issue whether Plaintiff or Defendant may put the Trial upon the Duel Further he argued under Favour of the Court that when the Issue is joined by the Duel in Treason or other Capital Crimes the Parties accused and Accuser must fight in their own proper Persons But if the Dispute be for Lands you may hire a Champion at  Hockley in the Hole  or any where else This Part of the Law we had from the  Saxons  and they had it as also the Trial by  Ordeal  from the  Lapland∣ers  It is indeed agreed said he the Southern and Eastern Nations never knew any Thing of it for though the ancient  Romans  would scold and call Names filthily yet there is not an Ex∣ample of a Challenge that ever passed amongst them  His quoting the Eastern Nations put another Gentleman in Mind of an Account he had from  a Boatswain of an  EastIndia  Man which was that a  Chinese  had tricked and bubbled him and that when he came to demand Satisfaction the next Morning and like a true Tar of Honour called him Son of a Whore Lyar Dog and o∣ther rough Appellatives used by Persons conver∣sant with Winds and Waves the  Chinese  with great Tranquility desired him not to come Abroad fasting nor put himself in a Heat for it would prejudice his Health Thus the East knows no∣thing of this Gallantry  There sate at the Left of the Table a Person of a venerable Aspect who asserted That half the Impositions which are put upon these Ages have been transmitted by Writers who have given too great Pomp and Magnificence to the Ex∣ploits of the ancient  BearGarden  and made their Gladiators by fabulous Tradition greater than  Gorman  and others of  GreatBritain  He informed the Company that he had searched Authorities for what he said and that a learned Antiquary  Humphrey Scarecrow  Esq  of  Hockley in the Hole  Recorder to the  BearGarden  was then writing a Discourse on the Subject It ap∣pears by the best Accounts says this Gentle∣man that the high Names which are used among us with so great Veneration were no other than Stagefighters and Worthies of the ancient  BearGarden  The renowned  Hercules  always carried a Quarterstaff and was from thence called  Claviger  A learned Chronolo∣gist is about proving what Wood this Staff was made of whether Oak Ash or CrabTree The first Trial of Skill he ever performed was with one  Cacus  a DeerStealer the next was with  Typhonus  a Giant of Forty Foot Four Inches Indeed it was unhappily recorded that meeting at last with a Sailor's Wife she made his Staff of Prowess serve her own Use and dwindle  away to a Distaff She clapt him on an old TarJacket of her Husband's so that this great Hero drooped like a scabbed Sheep Him his Contemporary  Theseus  succeeded in the  BearGarden  which Honour he held for many Years This grand Duellist went to Hell and was the only One of that Sort that ever came back again As for  Achilles  and  Hector  as the Ballads of those Times mention they were pretty Smart Fellows they fought at Sword and Buckler but the former had much the better of it his Mother who was an OysterWoman having got a BlackSmith of  Lemnos  to make her Son's Wea∣pons There's a Pair of trusty  Trojans  in a Song of  Virgil  's that were famous for handling their Gauntlets  Dares  and  Entellus  and indeed it does appear they fought no Sham Prize What Arms the great  Alexander  used is uncertain however the Historian mentions when he at∣tack'd  Thalestris  it was only at single Rapier but the Weapon soon failed for it was always observed that the  Amazons  had a Sort of En∣chantment about them which made the Blade of the Weapon though never of so good Metal at every home Push lose its Edge and grow fee∣ble  The  Roman BearGarden  was abundantly more magnificent than any Thing  Greece  could boast of it flourished most under those Delights of Man∣kind  Nero  and  Domitian  At one Time it's re∣corded Senators enter'd the List and thought it an Honour to be cudgelled and quarterstaffed I observe the  Lanistae  were the People chiefly em∣ployed which makes me imagine our  BearGar∣den  copied much after this the Butchers being the greatest Men in it  Thus far the Glory and Honour of the  BearGarden  stood secure till Fate that irresistible Ruler of sublunary Things in that universal  Ruin of Arts and politer Learning by those sa∣vage People the  Goths  and  Vandals  destroyed and levelled it to the Ground Then fell the Gran∣deur and Bravery of the  Roman  State till at last the Warlike Genius but accompanied with more Courtesie revived in the Christian World under those puissant Champions St  George  St  Dennis  and other dignified Heroes One kill'd his Dra∣gon another his Lion and were all afterwards canonized for it having red Letters before them to illustrate their Martial Temper The  Spanish  Nation it must be own'd were devoted to Gal∣lantry and Chivalry above the rest of the World What a great Figure does that great Name Don  Quixot  make in History How shines this glo∣rious Star in the  Western  World O renown'd Hero O Mirror of Knighthood  Thy branish'd Winyard all the World defies  And kills as sure as  del Tobosa  's Eyes  I am forced to break off abruptly being sent for in Haste with my Rule to measure the De∣gree of an Affront before the Two Gentlemen who are now in their Breeches and Pumps ready to engage behind  Mountague  House have made a Pass  From my own Apartment  June  It is an unreasonable Objection I find against my Labours that my Stock is not all my own and therefore the kind Reception I have met with is not so deserved as it ought to be But I hope though it be never so true that I am obliged to my Friends for laying their Cash in my Hands since I give it them again when they please and leave them at their Liberty to call it Home it will not hurt me with my gen∣tle Readers Ask all the Merchants who act upon Consignments Where is the Necessity if they answer readily what their Correspondents  draw of their being wealthy themselves Ask the greatest Bankers If all the Men they deal with were to draw at once what would be the Consequence But indeed a Country Friend has writ me a Letter which gives me great Mortifi∣cation wherein I find I am so far from expect∣ing a Supply from thence that some have not heard of me and the rest do not understand me His Epistle is as follows  Dear Cousin  I Thought when I left the Town to have rai∣sed your Fame here and helped you to sup∣port it by Intelligence from hence but alas they had never heard of the  Tatler  till I brought down a Set I lent them from House to House but they asked we what they meant I began to enlighten them by telling who and who were supposed to be intended by the Cha∣racters drawn I said for Instance  Chloe  and  Clarissa  are two eminent Toasts A Gentleman who keeps his Greyhound and Gun and one would think might know better told me he supposed they were Papishes for their Names were not  English  Then said he Why do you call live People Toasts I answered That was a new Name found out by the Wits to make a Lady have the same Effect as Burridge in the Glass when a Man is drinking But says I Sir I perceive this is to you all bamboozling why you look as if you were  Don Diego'd  to the Tune of a Thousand Pounds All this good Language was lost upon him He only stared though he is as good a Scholar as any Layman in the Town except the Barber Thus Cou∣sin you must be content with  London  for the Center of your Wealth and Fame we have no Relish for you Wit must describe its proper Circumference and not go beyond it lest  like little Boys when they straggle out of their own Parish it may wander to Places where it is not known and be lost Since it is so you must excuse me that I am forced at a Visit to sit silent and only lay up what excel∣lent Things pass at such Conversations  This Evening I was with a Couple of young Ladies one of them has the Character of the prettiest Company yet really I thought her but silly the other who talked a great deal less I observed to have Understanding The Lady who is reckoned such a Companion among her Acquaintance has only with a very brisk Air a Knack of saying the commonest Things The other with a sly serious one says home Things enough The first Mistress  Giddy  is very quick but the second Mrs  Slim  fell into  Giddy  's own Style and was as good Company as she  Giddy  happens to drop her Glove  Slim  reaches it to her Madam says  Giddy  I hope you'll have a better Office Upon which  Slim  immediately repartees and sits in her Lap and cries Are you not sorry for my Heaviness This sly Wench pleased me to see how she hit her Height of Under∣standing so well We sate down to Supper Says  Giddy  mighty prettily Two Hands in a Dish and One in a Purse Says  Slim  Ay Madam the More the Merrier but the Few∣er the Better Chear I quickly took the Hint and was as witty and talkative as they Says I  He that will not when he may  When he will he shall have Nay  and so helped my self  Giddy  turns about What have you found your Tongue Yes says I 'tis Manners to speak when I am spoken to but your greatest Talkers are the least Doers and the still Sow eats up all the Broth Ha Ha says  Giddy  One would think he had nothing in him and do you hear how he talks when he pleases I grew immediately roguish and pleasant to a De∣gree in the same Strain  Slim  who knew how good Company we had been cries You'll certainly print this bright Conversa∣tion  It is so and hereby you may see how small an Appearance the prettiest Things said in Com∣pany make when in Print  St James's Coffeehouse  June  A Mail from  Lisbon  has brought Advices of  June  the th from the King of  Portugal  's Army encamped at  Torre Allegada  which inform us That the General of the Army called a CourtMartial on the th at the Camp of  Gerumhena  where it was resolved to march with a Design to attempt the Succour of  Olivenza  Accordingly the Army moved on the th and marched to∣wards  Badajos  Upon their Approach the Mar∣quis  de Bay  detached so great a Party from the Blockade of  Olivenza  that the Marquis  das Mi∣nas  at the Head of a large Detachment cove∣red a great Convoy of Provisions towards  Oli∣venza  which threw in their Stores and march∣ed back to the main Army without Molestation from the  Spaniards  They add That each Army must necessarily march into Quarters within Twenty Days  Whosoever can discover a Surgeon's Apprentice who fell upon Mr  Bickerstaff  's Messenger or as the Printers call him  Devil  going to the Press and tore out of his Hand Part of his Essay against Duels in the Fragments of which were the Words  You lie  and  Man of Honour  taken up at the  TempleGate  and the Words  PerhapsMay be notBy your Leave Sir  and other Terms of Provocation taken up at the Door of  Young Man's  Coffeehouse shall receive Satisfaction from Mr  Morphew  besides a Set of Arguments to be spoken to any Man in a Passion which if the said enraged Man listens to will prevent Quarrelling  Mr  Bickerstaff  does hereby give Notice That he has taken the Two famous Universities of this Land under his immediate Care and does hereby promise all Tutors and Pupils That he will hear what can be said of each Side between them and to correct them impartially by placing them in Orders and Classes in the Learned World according to their Merit  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesday June  to  Thursd June    White's Chocolatehouse  June  AN Answer to the following Letter being ab∣solutely necessary to be dispatched with all Expedition I must trespass upon all that come with Horary Questions into my Antichamber to give the Gentleman my Opinion  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  June  SIR  I Know not whether you ought to pity or laugh at me for I am fallen desperately in Love with a profess'd  Platonne  the most unaccountable Creature of her Sex To hear her talk Seraphicks and run over  Norris  and  Moor  and  Milton  and the whole Set of Intel∣lectual Triflers torments me heartily for to a Lover who understands Metaphors all this pretty Prattle of Idea's gives very fine Views of Pleasure which only the dear Declaimer prevents by understanding them literally Why should she wish to be a Cherubim when 'tis Flesh and Blood that makes her adorable If I speak to her that's a high Breach of the Idea of Intuition If I offer at her Hand or Lip she shrinks from the Touch like a Sensi∣tive Plant and would contract her self into meer Spirit She calls her Chariot Vehicle her furbelow'd Scarf Pinnions Her blue Mant and Petticoat is her Azure Dress and her Footman goes by the Name of  Oberon  'Tis my Misfortune to be Six Foot and a half high Two full Spans between the Shoulders Thirteen Inches Diameter in the Calves and before I was in Love I had a noble Stomach and usually went to Bed sober with Two Bot∣tles I am not quite Six and twenty and my Nose is marked truly Aquiline For these Reasons I am in a very particular Manner her Aversion What shall I do Impudence it self cannot reclaim her If I write miserable she reckons me among the Children of Perdi∣tion and discards me her Region If I assume the Gross and Substantial she plays the real Ghost with me and vanishes in a Moment  I had Hopes in the Hypocrisy of her Sex but Perseverance makes it as bad as fixed Aversion I desire your Opinion Whether I may not law∣fully play the Inquisition upon her make use of a little Force and put her to the Rack and the Torture only to convince her she has real∣ly fine Limbs without spoiling or distorting them I expect your Directions e're I proceed to dwindle and fall away with Despair which at present I don't think advisable because if she should recant she may then hate me per∣haps in the other Extreme for my Tenuity I am with Impatience  Your most humble Servant  Charles Sturdy  My Patient has put his Case with very much Warmth and represented it in so lively a Man∣ner that I see both his Torment and Tormenter with great Perspicuity This Order of  Platonick  Ladies are to be dealt with in a peculiar Manner from all the rest of the Sex Flattery is the ge∣neral Way and the Way in this Case but it is not to be done grosly Every Man that has Wit and Humour and Raillery can make a good Flatterer for Woman in general but a  Platoune  is not to be touched with Panegyrick She will tell you it is a Sensuality in the Soul to be delight∣ed that Way You are not therefore to com∣mend but silently consent to all she does and says You are to consider in her the Scorn of you is not Humour but Opinion  There were some Years since a Set of these Ladies who were of Quality and gave out That Virginity was to be their State of Life during this mortal Condition and therefore resolved to join their Fortunes and erect a  Nunnery The Place of Residence was pitched upon and a pretty Situation full of natural Falls and Risings of Waters with shady Coverts and flowry Arbours was approved by Seven of the Founders There were as many of our Sex who took the Liberty to visit those Mansions of intended Severity among others a famous  Rake  of that Time who had the grave Way to an Excellence He came in first but upon seeing a Servant coming towards him with a Design to tell him this was no Place for him or his Companions up goes my grave Impudence to the Maid Young Woman said he if any of the Ladies are in the Way on this Side of the House pray carry us on the other Side towards the Gardens We are you must know Gen∣tlemen that are travelling  England  after which we shall go into Foreign Parts where some of us have already been Here he bows in the most humble Manner and kissed the Girl who knew not how to behave to such a Sort of Carriage He goes on Now you must know we have an Ambition to have it to say That we have a Protestant Nunnery in  England  But pray Mrs  Betty  Sir she replied my Name is  Susan  at your Service Then I hear∣tily beg your PardonNo Offence in the least says she for I have a CousinGerman whose Name is  Betty  Indeed said he I pro∣test to you that was more than I knew I spoke at Random But since it happens that I was near in the Right give me Leave to present this Gentleman to the Favour of a civil Salute His Friend advances and so on till that they had all saluted her By this Means the poor Girl was in the middle of the Crowd of these Fellows at a Loss what to do without Cou∣rage to pass through 'em and the  Platonicks  at several Peepholes pale trembling and fret∣ting  Rake  perceiv'd they were observ'd and therefore took Care to keep  Suky  in Chat with Questions concerning their Way of Life when appeared at last  Madonella  a Lady who had writ a fine Book concerning the Recluse Life and was the Projectrix of the Foundation She approaches into the Hall and  Rake  knowing the Dignity of his own Mien and Aspect goes Deputy from his Company She begins Sir I am obliged to follow the Servant who was sent out to know What Affair could make Stran∣gers press upon a Solitude which we who are to inhabit this Place have devoted to Hea∣ven and our own Thoughts Madam replies  Rake  with an Air of great Distance mixed with a certain Indifference by which he could dissemble Dissimulation your great Intention has made more Noise in the World than you design it should and we Travellers who have seen many foreign Institutions of this Kind have a Curiosity to see in its first Rudiments this Seat of Primitive Piety for such it must be called by future Ages to the Eternal Honour of the Founders I have read  Madonella  's excel∣lent and seraphick Discourse on this Subject The Lady immediately answers If what I have said could have contributed to raise any Thoughts in you that may make for the Advancement of intellectual and divine Conversation I should think my self extremely happy He immediate∣ly fell back with the profoundest Veneration then advancing Are you then that admired La∣dy If I may approach Lips which have utter∣ed Things so sacredHe salutes her His Friends followed his Example The Devoted within stood in Amazement where this would end to see  Madonella  receive their Address and their Company But  Rake  goes onWe  would not transgress Rules but if we may take the Liberty to see the Place you have thought fit to chuse for ever we would go into such Parts of the Gardens as is consistent with the Severi∣tics you have imposed on your selves To be short  Madonella  permitted  Rake  to lead her into the Assembly of Nuns followed by his Friends and each took his Fair One by the Hand after due Explanation to walk round the Gardens The Conversation turned upon the Lillies the Flow∣ers the Arbors and the growing Vegetables and  Rake  had the solemn Impudence when the whole Company stood round him to say That he sincerely wished Men might rise out of the Earth like Plants and that our Minds were not of Necessity to be sullied with carnivorous Appetites for the Generation as well as Sup∣port of our Species This was spoke with so easie and fixed an Assurance that  Madonella  an∣swer'd Sir under the Notion of a pious Thought you deceive your self in wishing an Institution foreign to that of Providence These Desires were implanted in us for reverend Purposes in preserving the Race of Men and giving Oppor∣tunities for making our Chastity more Heroick The Conference was continued in this Celestial Strain and carried on so well by the Managers on both Sides that it created a Second and a Second Interview and without entring into further Particulars there was hardly one of them but was a Mother or Father that Day Twelve∣month  Any unnatural Part is long taking up and as long laying aside therefore Mr  Sturdy  may as∣sure himself  Platonica  will fly for ever from a forward Behaviour but if he approaches her according to this Model she will fall in with the Necessities of mortal Life and condescend  to look with Pity upon an unhappy Man impri∣soned in so much Body and urged by such vio∣lent Desires  From my own Apartment  June  The Evils of this Town increase upon me to so great a Degree that I am half afraid I shall not leave the World much better than I found it Several worthy Gentlemen and Criticks have applied to me to give my Censure of an Enor∣mity which has been revived after being long oppressed and is called  Punning  I have several Arguments ready to prove that he cannot be a Man of Honour who is guilty of this Abuse of Humane Society But the Way to expose it is like the Expedient of curing Drunkenness show∣ing a Man in that Condition Therefore I must give my Reader Warning to expect a Collection of these Offences without which Preparation I thought it too adventurous to introduce the very Mention of it in good Company and hope I shall be understood to do it as a Divine men∣tions Oaths and Curses only for their Condem∣nation I shall dedicate this Discourse to a Gen∣tleman my very good Friend who is the  Janus  of our Times and whom by his Years and Wit you would take to be of the last Age but by his Dress and Morals of this  St James's Coffeehouse  June  Last Night arrived Two Mails from  Holland  which bring Letters from the  Hague  of the th Instant  N S  with Advice That the Enemy lay encamped behind a strong Retrenchment with the Marsh of  Remieres  on their Right and Left extending it self as far as  Bethune La Bassee  is in their Front  Lens  in their Rear and their Camp is strengthened by another Line from  Lens  to  Douay  The Duke of  Marlborough  caused an  exact Observation to be made of their Ground and the Works by which they were covered which appeared so strong that it was not thought proper to attack them in their present Posture However the Duke thought fit to make a Feint as if he design'd it His Grace accordingly march∣ing from the Abbey at  Looze  as did Prince  Eu∣gene  from  Lampret  and advanced with all possi∣ble Diligence towards the Enemy To favour the Appearance of an intended Assault the Ways were made and Orders distributed in such a Manner that none in either Camp could have Thoughts of any Thing but charging the Enemy by Break of Day the next Morning But soon af∣ter the Fall of the Night of the th the whole Army faced towards  Tournay  which Place they invested early in the Morning of the th The Mareschal  Villars  was so confident that we de∣signed to attack him that he had drawn great Part of the Garrison of the Place which is now invested into the Field For which Reason it is presumed it must submit within a small Time which the Enemy cannot prevent but by coming out of their present Camp and hazarding a ge∣neral Engagement These Advices add That the Garrison of  Mons  had marched out under the Command of Mareschal  d' Arco  which with the  Bavarians Walloons  and the Troops of  Co∣logne  have join'd the grand Army of the Enemy  The TATLER N  o    By Mrs  Jenny Distaff  HalfSister to Mr  Bickerstaff  From  Thursd June  to  Saturd June    From my own Apartment  June  MY Brother has made an Excursion into the Country and the Work against  Saturday  lies upon me I am very glad I have got Pen and Ink in my Hand for I have for some Time longed for his Absence to give a Right Idea of Things which I thought he put in a very odd Light and some of them to the Disadvantage of my own Sex It is much to be lamented that it is necessary to make Discourses and publish Treatises to keep the horrid Creatures the Men within the Rules of common Decency Turning over the Papers of Memorials or Hints for the ensuing Discourses I find a Letter subscribed by Mr  Truman  SIR  I Am lately come to Town and have read your Works with much Pleasure You make Wit subservient to good Principles and good Manners Yet because I design to buy the  Tatlers  for my Daughters to read I take the Freedom to desire you for the future to say nothing about any Combat between  Alex∣ander  and  Thalestris  This Offence gives me Occasion to express my self with the Resentment I ought on People who take Liberties of Speech before that Sex of  whom the honoured Names of Mother Daugh∣ter and Sister are a Part I had like to have named Wife in the Number but the senseless World are so mistaken in their Sentiments of Pleasure that the most amiable Term in Hu∣mane Life is become the Derision of Fools and Scorners My Brother and I have at least Fif∣ty Times quarrell'd upon this Topick I ever argue That the Frailties of Women are to be imputed to the false Ornaments which Men of Wit put upon our Folly and Coquetry He lays all the Vices of Men upon Women's secret Ap∣probation of Libertine Characters in them I did not care to give up a Point but now he is out of the Way I cannot but own I believe there is very much in what he asserted For if you will believe your Eyes and own that the wick∣edest and the wittiest of them all marry one Day or other Is it possible to believe that if a Man thought he should be for ever incapable of being received by a Woman of Merit and Ho∣nour he would persist in an abandon'd Way and deny himself the Possibility of enjoying the Happiness of wellgovern'd Desires orderly Sa∣tisfactions and honourable Methods of Life If our Sex were wise a Lover should have a Cer∣tificate from the last Woman he served how he was turned away before he was received into the Service of another But at present any Va∣gabond is welcome provided he promises to enter into our Livery It is wonderful that we will not take a Footman without Credentials from his last Master and in the greatest Con∣cern of Life we make no Scruple of falling into a Treaty with the most notorious Offender in his Behaviour against others But this Breach of Commerce between the Sexes proceeds from an unaccountable Prevalence of Custom by which a Woman is to the last Degree reproach∣able  for being deceived and a Man suffers no Loss of Credit for being a Deceiver  Since this Tyrant Humour has gained Place Why are we represented in the Writings of Men in ill Figures for Artifice in our Carriage when we have to do with a professed Impostor When Oaths Imprecations Vows and Adorations are made use of as Words of Course What Arts are not necessary to defend us from such as glory in the Breach of 'em As for my Part I am re∣solved to hear all and believe none of 'em and therefore solemnly declare no Vow shall deceive me but that of Marriage For I am turned of Twenty and being of a small Fortune some Wit and if I can believe my Lovers and my Glass Handsome I have heard all that can be said towards my Undoing and shall therefore for Warningsake give an Account of the Of∣fers that have been made me my Manner of re∣jecting 'em and my Assistances to keep my Re∣solution  In the Sixteenth Year of my Life I fell into the Acquaintance of a Lady extremely well known in this Town for the quick Advancement of her Husband and the Honours and Distinctions which her Industry has procured him and all who belong to her This excellent Body sate next to me for some Months at Church and took the Liberty which she said her Years and the Zeal she had for my Welfare gave her Claim to to assure me that she observed some Parts of my Behaviour which would lead me into Errors and give Encouragement to some to entertain Hopes I did not think of What made you said she look through your Fan at that Lord when your Eyes should have been turned upward or closed in Attention upon better Objects I blushed and pretended Fifty odd Excusesbut confounded my self the more She wanted  nothing but to see that Confusion and goes on Nay Child do not be troubled that I take No∣tice of it my Value for you made me speak it for though he is my Kinsman I have a near∣er Regard to Virtue than any other Considera∣tion She had hardly done speaking when this noble Lord came up to us and lead her to her Coach  My Head ran all that Day and Night on the exemplary Carriage of this Woman who could be so virtuously impertinent as to admonish one she was hardly acquainted with However it struck upon the Vanity of a Girl that it may possibly be his Thoughts might have been as favourable of me as mine were amorous of him and as unlikely Things as that have hap∣pened if he should make me his Wife She never mentioned this more to me but I still in all publick Places stole Looks at this Man who easily observed my Passion for him It is so hard a Thing to check the Return of a∣greeable Thoughts that he became my Dream my Vision my Food my Wish my Tor∣ment  That Minister of Darkness the Lady  Semphro∣nia  perceived too well the Temper I was in and would one Day after Evening Service needs take me to the Park When we were there my Lord passes by I flushed into a Flame Mrs  Di∣staff  said she You may very well remember the Concern I was in upon the first Notice I took of your Regard to that Lord and for∣give me who had a tender Friendship for your Mother now in her Grave that I am vigi∣lant of your Conduct She went on with much Severity and after great Solicitation prevailed on me to go with her into the Country and there spend the ensuing Summer out of the Way of a Man she saw I loved and one whom  she perceived meditated my Ruin by frequent∣ly desiring her to introduce him to me which she absolutely refused except he would give his Honour that he had no other Design but to marry me To her CountryHouse a Week or Two after we went There was at the far∣ther End of her Garden a Kind of Wilderness in the Middle of which ran a soft Rivu∣let by an Arbour of Jessamin In this Place I usually passed my retired Hours and read some Romantick or Poetical Tale till the Close of the Evening It was near that Time in the Heat of Summer when gentle Winds soft Murmurs of Water and Notes of Nightingals had given my Mind an Indolence which ad∣ded to that Repose of Soul Twilight and the End of a warm Day naturally throws up∣on the Spirits It was at such an Hour and in such a State of Tranquility I sat when to my unexpressible Amazement I saw my Lord walking towards me whom I knew not till that Moment to have been in the Country I could observe in his Approach the Perplexity which attends a Man big with Design and I had while he was coming forward Time to reflect that I was betrayed the Sense of which gave me a Resentment suitable to such a Base∣ness But when he entered into the Bower where I was my Heart flew towards him and I confess a certain Joy came into my Mind with an Hope that he might then make a Declaration of Honour and Passion This threw my Eye upon him with such Tender∣ness as gave him Power with a broken Ac∣cent to begin MadamYou will won∣derFor it is certain you must have ob∣servedthough I fear you will misinter∣pret the MotivesBut by Heaven and all that's Sacred If you couldHere he  made a full Stand And I recovered Power to say The Consternation I am in you will not I hope believeAn helpless innocent MaidBesides that the PlaceHe saw me in as great Confusion as himself which attributing to the same Causes he had the Audaciousness to throw himself at my Feet talk of the Stilness of the Evening and then ran into Deifications of my Person Pure Flames Constant Love Eter∣nal Raptures and a Thousand other Phrases drawn from the Images we have of Heaven which ill Men use for the Service of Hell were run over with uncommon Vehemence After which he seized me in his Arms His Design was too evident In my utmost Distress I fell upon my KneesMy Lord pity me on my KneesOn my Knees in the Cause of Virtue as you were lately in that of Wickedness Can you think of destroying the Labour of a whole Life the Purpose of a long Education for the base Service of a sudden Appetite to throw one that loves you that doats on you out of the Com∣pany and Road of all that is virtuous and Praise∣worthy Have I taken in all the Instructions of Piety Religion and Reason for no other End but to be the Sacrifice of Lust and abandoned to Scorn Assume your self my Lord and do not attempt to vitiate a Temple Sacred to Inno∣cence Honour and Religion If I have inju∣red you stab this Bosom and let me die but not be ruined by the Hand I love The Ardency of my Passion made me incapable of uttering more and I saw my Lover astonished and re∣formed by my Behaviour When rushed in  Sem∣phronia  Ha Faithful base Man could you then steal out of Town and lurk like a Robber about my House for such brutish Purposes  My Lord was by this Time recovered and fell into a violent Laughter at the Turn which  Sem∣phronia  designed to give her Villany He bowed to me with the utmost Respect Mrs  Distaff  said he be careful hereafter of your Company and so retired The Friend  Semphronia  congra∣tulated my Deliverance with a Flood of Tears  This Nobleman has since very frequently made his Addresses to me with Honour but I have as often refused them as well knowing that Fa∣miliarity and Marriage will make him on some illnatured Occasion call all I said in the Arbour a Theatrical Action Besides that I glory in con∣temning a Man who had Thoughts to my Dis∣honour If this Method were the Imitation of the whole Sex Innocence would be the only Dress of Beauty and all Affectation by any other Arts to please the Eyes of Men would be banished to the Stews for ever The Conquest of Passion gives Ten times more Happiness than we can reap from the Gratification of it and she that has got over such a one as mine will stand among Beaux and Pretty Fellows with as much Safety as in a Summer's Day among Grasshoppers and Butterflies  P S  I have Ten Millions of Things more against Men if I ever get the Pen again  St James's Coffeehouse  June  Our last Advices from the  Hague  dated the th Instant  N S  say That on the  th a Squadron of  Dutch  Men of War sailed out of the  Texel  to join Admiral  Baker  at  Spithead  The th was observed as a Day of Fast∣ing and Humiliation to implore a Blessing on the Arms of the Allies this ensuing Cam∣paign Letters from  Dresden  are very parti∣cular in the Account of the Gallantry and Magnificence in which that Court has ap∣peared  since the Arrival of the King of  Den∣mark  No Day has passed in which publick Shews have not been exhibited for his En∣tertainment and Diversion The last of that Kind which is mentioned is a Carousal where∣in many of the Youth of the first Quality dressed in the most splendid Manner ran for the Prize His  Danish  Majesty condescen∣ded to the same but having observed that there was a Design laid to throw it in his Way passed by without attempting to gain it The Court of  Dresden  was preparing to accompany his  Danish  Majesty to  Potsdam  where the Expectation of an Interview of three Kings had drawn together such Mul∣titudes of People that many Persons of Di∣stinction will be obliged to lie in Tents as long as those Courts continue in that Place  The TATLER N  o    By  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  From  Saturd June  to  Tuesd June    White's Chocolatehouse  June  HAving taken upon me to cure all the Di∣stempers which proceed from Affections of the Mind I have laboured since I first kept this publick Stage to do all the Good I could and have perfected many Cures at my own Lodg∣ings carefully avoiding the common Method of Mountebanks to do their most eminent Opera∣tions  in Sight of the People but must be so just to my Patients as to declare they have testified under their Hands their Sense of my poor Abili∣ties and the Good I have done them which I publish for the Benefit of the World and not out of any Thoughts of private Advantage  I have cured fine Mrs  Spy  of a great Im∣perfection in her Eyes which made her eter∣nally rolling them from one Coxcomb to ano∣ther in publick Places in so languishing a Man∣ner that it at once lessened her own Power and her Beholders Vanity Twenty Drops of my Ink placed in certain Letters on which she attentively looked for half an Hour have re∣stored her to the true Use of her Sight which is to guide and not mislead us Ever since she took this Liquor which I call  Bickerstaff  's  CircumspectionWater  she looks right forward and can bear being looked at for half a Day without returning one Glance This Water has a peculiar Vertue in it which makes it the only true Cosmetick or BeautyWash in the World The Nature of it is such that if you go to a Glass with a Design to admire your Face it im∣mediately changes it into downright Deformity If you consult it only to look with a better Countenance upon your Friends it immediately gives an Alacrity to the Visage and new Grace to the whole Person There is indeed a great deal owing to the Constitution of the Person to whom it is applied It is in vain to give it when the Patient is in the Rage of the Distemper a Bride in her first Month a Lady soon after her Husband's being Knighted or any Person of either Sex who has lately obtained any new good Fortune or Preferment must be prepared some Time before they use it It has an Ef∣fect upon others as well as the Patient when it is taken in due Form Lady  Petulant  has by  the Use of it cured her Husband of Jealousy and Lady  Gad  her whole Neighbourhood of Detra∣ction  The Fame of these Things added to my being an old Fellow makes me extreamly acceptable to the Fair Sex You would hardly believe me when I tell you there is not a Man in Town so much their Delight as my self They make no more of visiting me than going to Madam  d'Epingle  's There were two of them namely  Damia  and  Clidamira  I assure you Women of Distinction who came to see me this Morning in their Way to Prayers and being in a very diverting Humour as Innocence always makes People chea ful they would needs have me according to the Distinction of  pretty  and  very  pretty Fellows inform them if I thought either of them had a Title to the  very Pretty  a∣mong those of their own Sex and if I did which was the more deserving of the Two  To put them to the Tryal Look ye said I I must not rashly give my Judgment in Matters or this Importance pray let me see you dance I play upon the Kit They immediately fell back to the lower End of the Room You may be sure they curt'sy'd low enough to me And began Never were Two in the World so equally match∣ed and both S  ars to my Namesake  Isaac  Never was Man in so dange ous a Condition as my se f when they began to expand their Charms Oh Ladies Ladies cried I not half that Air you'll fire the House Both smiled for by the by there's no carrying a Metaphor too far when a Lady's Charms are spoke of Some Body I think has called a fine Woman dancing a Brandished Torch of Beauty These Rivals moved with such an agreeable Freedom that you would believe their Gesture was the neces∣sary Effect of the Musick and not the Product of Skill and Practice Now  Clidamira  came on  with a Crowd of Graces and demanded my Judg∣ment with so sweet an AirAnd she had no sooner carried it but  Damia  made her utterly forgot by a gentle sinking and a Rigadoon Step The Contest held a full half Hour and I pro∣test I saw no manner of Difference in their Per∣fections till they came up together and expected  Sentence Look ye Ladies said I I see no Preference in the least in your Performance but you  Clidamira  seem to be so well satisfied that I shall determine for you that I must give it to  Damia  who stands with so much Diffidence and Fear after showing an equal Merit to what she pretends to Therefore  Clidamira  you are a  pretty  but  Damia  you are a  very  pretty Lady For said I Beauty loses its Force if not accom∣panied with Modesty She that has an humble Opinion of her self will have every Body's Ap∣plause because she does not expect it while the vain Creature loses Approbation through too great a Sense of deserving it  From my own Apartment  June  Being of a very spare and hective Constitu∣tion I am forced to make frequent Journies of a Mile or Two for fresh Air and indeed by this last which was no further than the Village of  Chelsea  I am further convinced of the Necessity of travelling to know the World For as it is usual with young Voyagers assoon as they land upon a Shore to begin their Accounts of the Nature of the People their Soil their Go∣vernment their Inclinations and their Passions so really I fancied I could give you an immedi∣ate Description of this Village from the Five Fields where the Robbers lie in wait to the Coffeehouse where the  Literari  sit in Council A great Ancestor of ours by the Mother's Side Mr Justice  Overdo  whose History is  written by  Ben Johnson  met with more Enor∣mities by walking  incog  than he was capable of correcting and found great Mortifications in observing also Persons of Eminence whom he before knew nothing of Thus it fared with me even in a Place so near the Town as this When I came into the Coffeehouse I had not Time to salute the Company before my Eye was diverted by Ten Thousand Gimcracks round the Room and on the Sieling When my first Astonishment was over comes to me a Sage of a thin and meagre Countenance which Aspect made me doubt whether Read∣ing or Fretting had made it so Philosophick But I very soon perceived him to be of that Sect which the Ancients call  Gingivistae  in our Language ToothDrawers I immediately had a Respect for the Man for these practical Phi∣losophers go upon a very rational Hypothesis not to cure but take away the Part affected My Love of Mankind made me very benevo∣lent to Mr  Salter  for such is the Name of this eminent Barber and Antiquary Men are usual∣ly but unjustly distinguished rather by their Fortunes than their Talents otherwise this Per∣sonage would make a great Figure in that Class of Men which I distinguish under the Title of  Odd Fellows  But it is the Misfortune of Per∣sons of great Genius to have their Faculties dissipated by Attention to too many Things at once Mr  Salter  is an Instance of this If he would wholly give himself up to the String instead of playing Twenty Beginnings to Tunes he might before he dies play  Roger de Caubly  quite out I heard him go through his whole Round and indeed I think he does play the merry  ChristChurch  Bells pretty justly but he confess'd to me he did that rather to show he was Orthodox than that he valued himself up∣on  the Musick it self Or if he did proceed in his Anatomy Why might not he hope in Time to cut off Legs as well as draw Teeth The Particularity of this Man put me into a deep Thought whence it should proceed that of all the lower Order Barbers should go further in hitting the Ridicul us than any other Set of Men Watermen brawl Coblers sing But why must a Barber be for ever a Po∣litician a Musician an Anatomist a Poet and a Physician The learned  Vossius  says his Bar∣ber used to comb his Head in  Iambicks  And indeed in all Ages one of this useful Profession this Order of Cosmetick Philosophers has been celebrated by the most eminent Hands You see the Barber in Don  Quixot  is one of the princi∣pal Characters in the History which gave me Satisfaction in the Doubt why Don  Saltero  writ his Name with a  Spanish  Termination For he is descended in a right Line not from  John Tra∣descan  as he himself asserts but from that me∣morable Companion of the Knight of  Mancha  And I hereby certify all the worthy Citizens who travel to see his Rarities that his double∣barrelled Pistols Targets Coats of Mail his Sclopeta and Sword of  Toledo  were left to his Ancestor by the said Don  Quixot  and by the said Ancestor to all his Progeny down to Don  Saltero  Though I go thus far in favour of Don  Saltero  's great Merit I cannot allow a Liberty he takes of imposing several Names without my Licence on the Collections he has made to the Abuse of the good People of  England  one of which is particularly calculated to de∣ceive Religious Persons to the great Scandal of the Welldisposed and may introduce Hetero∣dox Opinions He shows you a StrawHat which I know to be made by  Madge Peskad  within Three Miles of  Bedford  and tells you  it is  Pontius Pilate  's Wife's Chambermaid's Sister's Hat  To my knowledge of this very Hat it may be added that the Covering of Straw was ne∣ver used among the  Jews  since it was deman∣ded of them to make Bricks without it There∣fore this is really nothing but under the speci∣ous Pretence of Learning and Antiquity to im∣pose upon the World There are other Things which I cannot tolerate among his Rarities as the  China  Figure of a Lady in the GlassCase the  Italian  Engine for the Imprisonment of those who go Abroad with it Both which I hereby order to be taken down or else he may expect to have his Letters Patents for making Punch superseded be debarred wearing his Muff next Winter or ever coming to  London  without his Wife It may perhaps be thought I have dwelt too long upon the Affairs of this Operator but I desire the Reader to remember that it is my Way to consider Men as they stand in Merit and not according to their Fortune or Figure and if he is in a Coffeehouse at the Reading hereof let him look round and he will find there may be more Characters drawn in this Account than that of Don  Saltero  for half the Politicians about him he may observe are by their Place in Nature of the Class of ToothDrawers  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd June  to  Thursd June    Grecian Coffeehouse  June  THere is an Habit or Custom which I have put my Patience to the utmost Stretch to have suffered so long because several of my in∣timate Friends are in the Guilt and that is the Humour of taking Snuff and looking dirty a∣bout the Mouth by Way of Ornament  My Method is to dive to the Bottom of a Sore before I pretend to apply a Remedy For this Reason I sat by an eminent Storyteller and Poli∣tician who takes half an Ounce in five Seconds and has mortgaged a pretty Tenement near the Town meerly to improve and dung his Brains with this prolifick Powder I observed this Gentleman t'other Day in the midst of a Story diverted from it by looking at something at a Distance and I softly hid his Box But he re∣turns to his Tale and looking for his Box he cries  And so Sir  Then when he should have taken a Pinch  As I was saying  says he  Has no Body seen my Box  His Friend beseeches him to finish his Narration Then he proceeds  And  SirWhere can my Box be  Then turn∣ing to me  Pray Sir Did you see my Box  Yes Sir said I I took it to see how long you could live without it He resumes his Tale and I took Notice that his Dulness was much more regular and fluent than before A Pinch sup∣plied the Place of  As I was saying And so Sir  and he went on currently enough in that Style  which the Learned call the Insipid This Obser∣vation easily led me into a Philosophick Reason for taking Snuff which is done only to supply with Sensations the Want of Reflection This I take to be an    a nostrum  upon which I hope to receive the Thanks of this Board For as it is natural to lift a Man's Hand to a Sore when you fear any Thing coming at you so when a Person feels his Thoughts are run out and has no more to say it is as natural to supply his weak Brain with Powder at the nearest Place of Access  viz  the Nostrils This is so evident that Nature suggests the Use according to the Indigence of the Persons who use this Medicine without being prepossessed with the Force of Fa∣shion or Custom For Example the Native  Hi∣bernians  who are reckoned not much unlike the ancie t  Baeotians  take this Specifick for Empti∣ness in the Head in greater Abundance than any other Nation under the Sun The learned  Sotus  as sparing as he is in his Words would be still more silent if it were not for this Powder  However low and poor the taking Snuff ar∣gues a Man to be in his own Stock of Thought or Means to employ his Brains and his Fingers yet there is a poorer Creature in the World than He and this is a Borrower of Snuff a Fellow that keeps no Box of his own but is always ask∣ing others for a Pinch Such poor Rogues put me always in Mind of a common Phrase among SchoolBoys when they are composing their Ex∣ercise who run to an upper Scholar and cry  Pray give me a little  Sense But of all Things com∣mend me to the Ladies who are got into this pretty Help to Discourse I have been this Three Years perswading  Sagissa  to leave it off but she talks so much and is so Learned that she is above Con∣tradiction However an Accident t'other Day brought that about which my Eloquence never  could accomplish She had a  very pretty Fellow  in her Closet who ran thither to avoid some Company that came to visit her She made an Excuse to go in to him for some Implement they were talking of Her eager Gallant snatched a Kiss but being unused to Snuff some Grains from off her upper Lip made him sneeze aloud which alarm'd the Visitants and has made a Dis∣covery that profound Reading very much In∣telligence and a general Knowledge of who and who's together cannot fill up her vacant Hours so much but that she is sometimes obliged to descend to Entertainments less intellectual  White's Chocolatehouse  June  I know no Manner of News for this Place but that  Cynthio  having been long in Despair for the inexorable  Clarissa  lately resolved to fall in Love the good old Way of Bargain and Sale and has pitched upon a very agreeable young Woman He will undoubtedly succeed for he accosts her in a Strain of Familiarity without breaking thro' the Deference that is due to Woman whom a Man would chuse for his Life I have hardly ever heard rough Truth spoken with a better Grace than in this his Letter  MADAM  I Writ to you on  Saturday  by Mrs  Lucy  and give you this Trouble to urge the same Request I made then which was that I may be admitted to wait upon you I should be very far from desiring this if it were a Transgression of the most severe Rules to al∣low it I know you are very much above the little Arts which are frequent in your Sex of giving unnecessary Torments to their Admi∣  rs therefore hope you'll do so much Ju∣stice  to the generous Passion I have for you as to let me have an Opportunity of acquainting you upon what Motives I pretend to your good Opinion I shall not trouble you with my Sen∣timents till I know how they will be received and as I know no Reason why Difference of Sex should make our Language to each other differ from the ordinary Rules of right Reason I shall affect Plainness and Sincerity in my Dis∣course to you as much as other Lovers do Per∣plexity and Rapture Instead of saying I shall die for you I profess I should be glad to lead my Life with you You are as beautiful as witty as prudent and as good humour'd as any Woman breathing but I must confess to you I regard all these Excellencies as you will please to direct them for my Happiness or Mi∣sery With me Madam the only lasting Mo∣tive to Love is the Hope of its becoming mu∣tual I beg of you to let Mrs  Lucy  send me Word when I may attend you I promise you I'll talk of nothing but indifferent Things though at the same Time I know not how I shall approach you in the tender Moment of first seeing you after this Declaration of  MADAM  Your most Obedient and most Faithful Humble Servant  c  Will's Coffeehouse  June  Having taken a Resolution when Plays are acted next Winter by an entire good Company to publish Observations from Time to Time on the Performance of the Actors I think it but just to give an Abstract of the Laws of Action for the Help of the less learned Part of the Audience  that they may rationally enjoy so refined and in∣structive a Pleasure as a just Representation of humane Life The great Errors in Playing are admirably well exposed in  Hamlet  's Direction to the Actors who are to play in his supposed Tra∣gedy by which we shall form our future Judg∣ments on their Behaviour and for that Reason you have the Discourse as follows  Speak the Speech as I pronounce it to you trippingly on the Tongue but if you mouth it as many of our Players do I had as lieu the TownCryer had spoke my Lines Nor do not saw the Air too much with your Hand thus but use all gently For in the very Torrent Tempest and as I may say the Whirlwind of Passion you must acquire and beget a Tem∣perance that may give it Smoothness Oh It offends me to the Soul to see a robustous Periwigpated Fellow tear a Passion to Tatters to very Rags to split the Ears of the Ground∣lings who for the most Part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb Shews and Noise I could have such a Fellow whipt for o'erdoing  Termagant  It out  Herod's Herod  Be not too tame neither but let your own Discretion be your Tutor Sute the Action to the Word the Word to the Action with this special Observance that you o'erstop not the Modesty of Nature for any Thing so over∣done is from the Purpose of Playing whose End both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the Mirror up to Nature to shew Virtue her own Feature Scorn her own Image and the very Age and Body of the Time its Form and Pressure Now this over∣done or come tardy off though it make the Unskilful laugh cannot but make the Judici∣ous grieve The Censures of which one must in your Allowance oversway a whole Theatre  of others Oh there be Players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it prophanely that nei∣ther having the Accent of  Christian Pagan  or  Norman  have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's Journey men had made Men and not made them well they imitated Humanity so abominably This should be reformed altogether and let those that play your Clowns speak no more than is set down for them For there be of them that will of themselves laugh to set on some Quan∣tity of barren Spectators to laugh too though in the mean Time some necessary Question of the Play be then to be consider'd that's villa∣nous and shews a most pitiful Ambition in the Fool that uses it  From my own

Author of the following Letter  SIR  NOT long since you were pleased to give us a Chimerical Account of the famous Family of  Staffs  from whence I suppose you would insinuate that it is the most ancient and numerous House in all  Europe  But I posi∣tively deny that it is either and wonder much at your audacious Proceedings in this Matter since 'tis well known that our most illustri∣ous most renowned and most celebrated  Ro∣man  Family of  Ix  has enjoyed the Prece∣dency to all others from the Reign of good old  Saturn  I could say much to the Defama∣tion and Disgrace of your Family as that  your Relations  Distaff  and  Broomstaff  were both inconsiderate mean Persons one spinning the other sweeping the Streets for their daily Bread But I forbear to vent my Spleen on Objects so much beneath my Indignation I shall only give the World a Catalogue of my Ancestors and leave them to determine which hath hitherto had and which for the future ought to have the Preference  First

Coffeehouse  June  Letters from  Brussels  of the d of  July N S  say That the Duke of  Marlborough  and Prince  Eugene  having received Advice That the Mar∣shal  Villars  had drawn a considerable Body out of the Garrison of  Tournay  to reinforce his Army marched towards that Place and came before it early in the Morning of the th As soon as they came into that Ground the Prince of  Nas∣sau  was sent with a strong Detachment to take Post at St  Amand  and at the same Time my Lord  Orkney  received Orders to possess himself of  Mortagne  both which were successfully exe∣cuted whereby we are Masters of the  Scheld  and the  Scarp  Eight Men were drawn out of each Troop of Dragoons and Company of Foot in the Garrison of  Tournay  to make up the Re∣inforcement which was order'd to join Marshal  Villars  but upon Advice that the Allies were  marching towards  Tournay  they endeavoured to return into the Town but were intercepted by the Earl of  Orkney  by whom that whole Body was killed or taken These Letters add That Dragoons each Horseman carrying a FootSoldier behind him were detached from  Mons  to throw themselves into  Tournay  but upon Ap∣pearance of a great Body of Horse of the Allies retired towards  Condé  We hear That the Gar∣rison does not consist of more than Men Of the Battalions design'd to be employ'd in this Siege are  English viz  Two of Guards and the Regiments of  Argyle Temple Evans  and  Meredith  The TATLER N  o    By Mrs  Jenny Distaff  HalfSister to Mr  Bickerstaff  From  Thursd June  to  Saturd July    From my own Apartment  June  MANY Affairs calling my Brother into the Country the Care of our Intelligence with the Town is left to me for some Time therefore you must expect the Advices you meet with in this Paper to be such as more immediately and naturally fall under the Consideration of our Sex History therefore written by a Woman you will easily imagine to consist of Love in all its Forms both in the Abuse of and Obe∣dience to that Passion As to the Faculty of Wri∣ting it self it will not it is hoped be demanded that Stile and Ornament shall be so much con∣sulted as Truth and Simplicity which latter Qualities we may more justly pretend to be∣yond  the other Sex While therefore the Ad∣ministration of our Affairs is in my Hands you shall from Time to Time have an exact Account of all false Lovers and their shallow Pretences for breaking off of all Termagant Wives who make Wedlock a Yoke of Men who affect the Entertainments and Manners suitable only to our Sex and Women who pretend to the Conduct of such Affairs as are only within the Province of Men It is necessary further to advertise the Reader that the usual Places of Resort being ut∣terly out of my Province or Observation I shall be obliged frequently to change the Dates of Pla∣ces as Occurrences come into my Way The fol∣lowing Letter I lately received from  Epsom  Epsom  June  IT is now almost Three Weeks since what you writ about happen'd in this Place The Quarrel between my Friends did not run so high as I find your Accounts have made it The Truth of the Fact you shall have very faithfully You are to understand that the Persons concern'd in this Scene were Lady  Autumn  and Lady  Springly Autumn  is a Per∣son of good Breeding Formality and a sin∣gular Way practised in the last Age and Lady  Springly  a modern Impertinent of our Sex who affects as improper a Familiarity as the other does Distance Lady  Autumn  knows to an Hair's Breadth where her Place is in all As∣semblies and Conversations but  Springly  nei∣ther gives nor takes Place of any Body but understands the Place to signify no more than to have Room enough to be at Ease wherever she comes Thus while  Autumn  takes the Whole of this Life to consist in un∣derstanding Punctilio and Decorum  Springly  takes every Thing to be becoming which con∣tributes  to her Ease and Satisfaction These Heroines have married Two Brothers both Knights  Springly  is the Spouse of the elder who is a Baronet and  Autumn  being a rich Widow has taken the younger and her Purse endowed him with an equal Fortune and Knighthood of the same Order This Jum∣ble of Titles you need not doubt has been an aching Torment to  Autumn  who took Place of the other on no Pretence but her Careles∣ness and Disregard of Distinction The secret Occasion of Envy broiled long in the Breast of  Autumn  but no Opportunity of Contention on that Subject happening kept all Things quiet till the Accident of which you demand an Account  It was given out among all the gay People of this Place That on the th Instant several Damsels swift of Foot were to run for a Sute of HeadClothes at the  Old Wells  Lady  Autumn  on this Occasion invited  Springly  to go with her in her Coach to see the Race When they came to the Place where the  Go∣vernour of Epsom  and all his Court of Citizens were assembled as well as a Crowd of Peo∣ple of all Orders a brisk young Fellow ad∣dresses himself to the younger of the La∣dies  viz Springly  and offers her his Service to conduct her into the MusickRoom  Spring∣ly  accepts the Compliment and is led trium∣phantly through a bowing Crowd while  Au∣tumn  is left among the Rabble and has much ado to get back into her Coach but she did it at last And as it is usual to see by the Hor∣ses my Lady's present Disposition she orders  John  to whip furiously Home to her Husband where when she enters down she sits be∣gan to unpin her Hood and lament her fool∣ish fond Heart to marry into a Family where  she was so little regarded she that mightHere she stops then rises up and stamps and sits down again Her gentle Knight made his Approaches with a supple beseeching Ge∣sture My Dear said heTell me no Dears replied  Autumn  in the Presence of the Go∣vernour and all the MerchantsWhat will the World say of a Woman that has thrown her self away at this Rate Sir  Thomas  withdrew and knew it would not be long a Secret to him as well as that Experience told him He that marries a Fortune is of Course guilty of all Faults against his Wife let them be com∣mitted by whom they will But  Springly  an Hour or Two after returns from the  Wells  and finds the whole Company together Down she sat and a profound Silence ensued You know a premeditated Quarrel usually begins and works up with the Words  Some People  The Silence was broken by Lady  Autumn  who began to say  There are Some People who fancy that if Some PeopleSpringly  imme∣diately takes her up  There are Some People who fancy if Other PeopleAutumn  repar∣tees  People may give themselves Airs but Other People perhaps who make less ado may be perhaps as agreeable as People who set themselves out more  All the other People at the Table sat mute while these Two People who were quarrelling went on with the Use of the Word  People  instancing the very Ac∣cidents between them as if they kept only in distant Hints  Therefore  says  Autumn  red∣ning  There are some People will go Abroad in other People's Coaches and leave those with whom they went to shift for themselves and if perhaps those People have married the youn∣ger Brother yet perhaps he may be behol∣den to those People for what he is Springly  smartly answers  People may bring so much ill Humour into a Family as People may repent their receiving their Money  and goes on  Every Body is not considerable enough to give her Uneasi∣ness  Upon this  Autumn  comes up to her and desired her to kiss her and never to see her again which her Sister refusing my Lady gave her a Box on the Ear  Springly  returns  Ay ay  said she  I knew well enough you meant me by your Some People and gives her another on t'other Side  To it they went with most Mas∣culine Fury Each Husband ran in The Wives immediately fell upon their Husbands and tore Periwigs and Cravats The Company interpo∣sed when according to the SlipKnot of Ma∣trimony which makes them return to one ano∣ther when any put in between the Ladies and their Husbands fell upon all the rest of the Company and having beat all their Friends and Relations out of the House came to them∣selves time enough to know there was no bear∣ing the Jest of the Place after these Adventures and therefore marched off the next Day It is said the Governour has sent several Joints of Mutton and has proposed divers Dishes very exquisitely dressed to bring them down again From his

Day appear'd here a Figure of a Person whose Services to the Fair Sex have reduced him to a Kind of Existence for which there is no Name If there be a Condition between Life and Death without being absolutely dead or living his State is that His Aspect and Complexion in his robust Days gave him the il∣lustrious Title of  Africanus  But it is not only from the warm Climates in which he has ser∣ved nor from the Disasters in which he has suf∣fered that he deserves the same Appellation with that renowned  Roman  but the Magnanimity with which he appears in his last Moments is what gives him the undoubted Character of  Hero Cato  stabbed himself and  Hannibal  drank Poi∣son but our  Africanus  lives in the continual Puncture of aching Bones and poisoned Juices The Old Heroes fled from Torments by Death and this Modern lives in Death and Torments with an Heart wholly bent upon a Supply for remaining in them An ordinary Spirit would sink under his Oppressions but he makes an Advantage of his very Sorrow and raises an Income from his Diseases Long has this Wor∣thy been conversant in Bartering and knows that when Stocks are lowest it is the Time to buy Therefore with much Prudence and Tranquility he thinks that now he has not a Bone sound but a Thousand nodous Parts for which the Anatomist have not Words and more Diseases than the College ever heard of it is the only Times to purchase an Annuity for Life Sir  Thomas  told me it was an Entertain∣ment more surprizing and pleasant than can be imagined to see an Inhabitant of neither World without Hand to lift or Leg to move scarce Tongue to utter his Meaning so keen upon  biting the whole World and making Bubbles at his Exit Sir  Thomas  added that he would have bought Twelve Shillings a Year of him but that he feared there was some Trick in it and belie∣ved him already dead What Says that Knight Is Mr  Partridge  whom I met just now going on both his Legs firmer than I can allowed to be quire dead and shall  Africanus  without one Limb that can do its Office be pronounced alive  What heightened the TragiComedy of this Market for Annuities was that the Ob∣servation of it provoked  Monocalus  who is the most Eloquent of all Men to many excel∣lent Reflections which he spoke with the Vehemence and Language both of a Game∣ster and an Orator  "When I cast said that delightful Speaker my Eye upon thee thou unaccountable  Africanus  I cannot but call my self as unaccountable as thou art for cer∣tainly we were born to shew what Contra∣dictions Nature is pleased to form in the same Species Here am I able to eat to drink to sleep and do all Acts of Nature except begetting my Like and yet by an unintelligible Force of Spleen and Fancy I every Moment imagine I am dying It is utter Madness in thee to provide for Supper for I'll bet you Ten to One you don't live till half an Hour after Four and yet I am so distracted as to be in Fear every Moment though I'll lay Ten to Three I drink Three Pints of burnt Claret at your Funeral Three Nights hence After all I envy thee thou that hast no Sense of Death art happier than one that always fears it"  The Knight had gone on but that a Third Man ended the Seene by applauding the Knight's Eloquence  and Philosophy in a Laughter too violent for his own Constitution as much as he mock'd that of  Africanus  and  Monoculus  St James's Coffeehouse  July  This Day arrived Three Mails from  Holland  with Advices relating to the Posture of Affairs in the  LowCountries  which say That the Con∣federate Army extends from  Luchin  on the Causeway between  Tournay  and  Lisle  to  Epain  near  Mortagne  on the  Scheld  The Marshal  Vil∣lars  remains in his Camp at  Lens  but it is said he detached Ten Thousand Men under the Com∣mand of the Chevalier  de Luxemburg  with Or∣ders to form a Camp at  Crepin  on the  Haine  be∣tween  Condé  and St  Guillain  where he is to be joined by the Elector of  Bavaria  with a Body of Troops and after their Conjunction to attempt to march into  Brabant  But they write from  Brussels  That the Duke of  Marlborough  having it equally in his Power to make Detachments to the same Parts they are under no Apprehensions from these Reports for the Safety of their Coun∣try They further add from  Brussels  that they have good Authority for believing That the  French  Troops under the Conduct of Marshal  de Bezons  are retiring out of  Spain  The TATLER N  o    By Mrs  Jenny Distaff  HalfSister to Mr  Bickerstaff  From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd July    White's Chocolatehouse  July  IT may be thought very unaccountable that I who can never be supposed to go to  White  's should pretend to talk to you of Matters proper for or in the Stile of that Place But though I never visit these publick Haunts I converse with those that do and for all they pretend so much to the contrary they are as talkative as our Sex and as much at a Loss to entertain the present Company without sacrificing the last as we our selves This Reflection has led me into the Con∣sideration of the Use of Speech and made me look over in my Memory all my Acquaintance of both Sexes to know to which I may more justly impute the Sin of superfluous Discourse in Re∣gard to Conversation without entring into it as it respects Religion  I foresee my Acquaintance will immediately upon starting this Subject ask me How I shall celebrate Mrs  Alse Copswood  the  Yorkshire  Hun∣tress who is come to Town lately and moves as if she were on her Nag and going to take a FiveBar Gate and is as loud as if she were fol∣lowing her Dogs I can easily answer that for she is as soft as  Damon  in Comparison of her BrotherinLaw  Tom Bellfrey  who is the most accomplish'd Man in this Kingdom for all Gen∣tlemanlike Activities and Accomplishments It is allow'd that he is a profess'd Enemy to the  Italian  Performers in Musick But then for our own native Manner according to the Customs and known Usages of our Island he is to be pre∣ferr'd for the Generality of the Pleasure he be∣stows much before those Fellows though they sing to full Theatres For what is a Theatrical Voice to that of a Foxhunter I have been at a Musical Entertainment in an open Field where it amaz'd me to hear to what Pitches the chief Masters would reach There was a Meeting near our Seat in  Staffordshire  and the most emine t of all the Counties of  England  were at it How wonderful was the Harmony between Men and Dogs  Robin Cartail  of  Bucks  was to answer to  Jowler  Mr  Tinbreast  of  Cornwal  was appointed to open with  Sweetlips  and Beaux  Slimber  a  Lon∣doner  undertook to keep up with  Trips  a Whelp just set in  Tom Bellfrey  and  Ringwood  were cou∣pled together to fill the Cry on all Occasions and be in at the Death of the Fox Hare or Stag for which both the Dog and the Man were excel∣lently suited and loved one another and were as much together as  Banister  and  King  When  Jowler  first alarm'd the Field  Cartail  repeated every Note  Sweetlips  's Treble succeeded and shook the Wood  Tinbreast  eccho'd a Quarter of a Mile beyond it We were soon after all at a Loss till we rid up and found  Trips  and  Slimber  at a Default in Half Notes But the Day and the Tune was recovered by  Tom Bellfrey  and  Ring∣wood  to the great Joy of us all tho' they drown∣ed every other Voice For  Bellfrey  carries a Note Four Furlongs Three Rood and Six Paces fur∣ther than any other in  England  I fear the Mention of this will be thought a Digression from my Purpose about Speech But I answer No Since this is used where Speech rather should be employ'd it may come in o Consideration in the same Chapter For Mr  Bell∣frey  being at a Visit where I was  viz  his Cou∣sin's Lady  Dainty  's in  Soho  was asked What Entertainments they had in the Country Now  Bellfrey  is very ignorant and much a Clown but confident withal In a Word he struck up a FoxChase Lady  Dainty  's Dog Mr  Sippet  as she calls him started and jump'd out of his La∣dy's Lap and fell a barking  Bellfrey  went on and call'd all the neighbouring Parishes into the Square Never was Woman in such Confusion as that delicate Lady But there was no stop∣ping her Kinsman A Room full of Ladies fell into the most violent Laughter My Lady look'd as if she was shrieking Mr  Sippet  in the Mid∣dle of the Room breaking his Heart with bark∣ing but all of us unheard As soon as  Bell∣frey  became silent up gets my Lady and takes him by the Arm to lead him off  Bellfrey  was in his Boots As she was hurrying him away his Spurs takes hold of her Petticoat his Whip throws down a Cabinet of  China  He cries  What Are your Crocks rotten Are your Petti∣coats ragged A Man can't walk in your House for Trincums  Every County of  Great Britain  has One Hun∣dred or more of this Sort of Fellows who Roar instead of Speaking Therefore if it be true that we Women are also given to greater Flu∣ency of Words than is necessary sure she that disturbs but a Room or a Family is more to be to∣lerated than one who draws together Parishes and Counties and sometimes with an Estate that might make him the Blessing and Ornament of the World around him has no other View and Ambition but to be an Animal above Dogs and Horses without the Relish of any one En∣joyment which is peculiar to the Faculties of hu∣mane Nature I know it will here be said that talking of meer Country Squires at this Rate is  as it were to write against  Valentine  and  Orson  To prove any Thing against the Race of Men you must take 'em as they are adorn'd with Edu∣cation as they live in Courts or have received Instructions in Colleges  But I am so full of my late Entertainment by Mr  Bellfrey  that I must defer pursuing this Sub∣ject to another Day and wave the proper Obser∣vations upon the different Offenders in this Kind some by profound Eloquence on small Occa∣sions others by degrading Speech upon great Circumstances Expect therefore to hear of the Whisperer without Business the Laugher with∣out Wit the Complainer without receiving In∣juries and a very large Crowd which I shall not forestall who are common though not com∣monly observ'd Impertinents whose Tongues are too voluble for their Brains and are the ge∣neral Despisers of us Women though we have their Superiors the Men of Sense for our Ser∣vants  St James's Coffeehouse  July  There has arriv'd

From my own Apartment  July  I Find among my Brother's Papers the follow∣ing Letter  verbatim  which I wonder how he could suppress so long as he has since it was sent him for no other End but to show the good Effect his Writings have already had upon the ill Customs of the Age  London  June  SIR  THE End of all publick Papers ought to be the Benefit and Instruction as well as the Diversion of the Readers To which I see none so truly conducive as your late Perfor∣mances especially those tending to the root∣ing out from amongst us that Unchristianlike and Bloody Custom of Duelling which that you have already in some Measure perform'd will appear to the Publick in the following no less True than Heroick Story  A Noble Gentleman of this City who has the Honour of serving his Country as Major in the TrainBands being at that General Mart of StockJobbers call'd  Jonathans  endeavour∣ing to raise himself as all Men of Honour ought to the Degree of Colonel at least it happened that he bought the  Bear  of another Officer who though not Commissioned in the Army yet no less eminently serves the Pub∣lick than the other in raising the Credit of the Kingdom by raising that of the Stocks However having sold the  Bear  and Words arising about the Delivery the most Noble Major no less scorning to be outwitted in the Coffeehouse than to run into the Field according to Method abused the other with the Titles of  Rogue Villain BearskinMan  and the like Whereupon Satisfaction was demanded and accepted So forth the Major march'd commanding his Adversary to fol∣low To a most spacious Room in the She∣riff's House near the Place of Quarrel they come where having due Regard to what you have lately publish'd they resolved not to shed one another's Blood in that barba∣rous Manner you prohibited yet not wil∣ling  to put up Affronts without Satisfaction' they stripp'd and in decent Manner fought full fairly with their wrathful Hands The Combat lasted a Quarter of an Hour in which Time Victory was often doubtful and many a dry Blow was strenuously laid on by each Side till the Major finding his Adver∣sary obstinate unwilling to give him further Chastisement with most shrill Voice cry'd out  I am satisfied enough  Whereupon the Com∣bat ceas'd and both were Friends imme∣diately  Thus the World may see how necessary it is to encourage those Men who make it their Business to instruct the People in every Thing necessary for their Preservation I am in∣formed a Body of worthy Citizens have a∣greed on an Address of Thanks to you for what you have writ on the foregoing Subject whereby they acknowledge one of their highly esteem'd Officers preserv'd from Death  Your humble Servant  A B  I fear the Word  Bear  is hardly to be under∣stood among the polite People but I take the Meaning to be That one who ensures a Real Value upon an Imaginary Thing is said to sell a  Bear  and is the same Thing as a Promise a∣mong Courtiers or a Vow between Lovers I have writ to my Brother to hasten to Town and hope that printing the Letters directed to him which I knew not how to answer will bring him speedily and therefore I add also the following  July  Mr  Bickerstaff  YOU having hinted a generous Intention of taking under your Consideration the Whisperers without Business and Laughers without Occasion as you tender the Welfare of your Country I entreat you not to forget or delay so Publickspirited a Work Now or never is the Time Many other Calamities may cease with the War but I dismally dread the Multiplication of these Mortals un∣der the Ease and Luxuriousness of a settled Peace half the Blessing of which may be de∣stroyed by 'em Their Mistake lies certainly here in a wretched Belief That their Mi∣mickry passes for Real Business or True Wit Dear Sir convince 'em that it never was is or ever will be either of them nor ever did does or to all Futurity ever can look like ei∣ther of them but that it is the most cursed Disturbance in Nature which is possible to be inflicted on Mankind under the noble Definition of a Sociable Creature In doing this Sir you will oblige more Humble Ser∣vants than can find Room to subscribe their Names  White's Chocolatehouse  July  In Pursuance of my last Date from hence I am to proceed on the Accounts I promised of several Personages among the Men whose con∣spicuous Fortunes or Ambition in shewing their Follies have exalted them above their Fellows The Levity of their Minds is visible in their every Word and Gesture and there  s not a Day passes but puts me in Mind of Mr  Wycherley  's Character of a Coxcomb  He is ugly all over with the Affectation of the fine Gentleman  Now though the Women may put on Softness in their  Looks or affected Severity or impertinent Gaie∣ty or pert Smartness their SelfLove and Admi∣ration cannot under any of these Disguises ap∣pear so invincible as that of the Men You may easily take Notice that in all their Actions there is a secret Approbation either in the Tone of their Voice the Turn of their Body or Cast of their Eye which shows that they are extremely in their own Favour  Take one of your Men of Business he shall keep you half an Hour with your Hat off enter∣taining you with his Consideration of that Af∣fair you spoke of to him last till he has drawn a Crowd that observes you in this Grimace Then when he is publick enough he immediately runs into Secrets and falls a whispering You and he make Breaks with Adverbs as  But however thus far  and then you whisper again and so on till they who are about you are dispersed and your busy Man's Vanity is no longer gratified by the Notice taken of what Importance he is and how inconsiderable you are for your Pretender to Business is never in Secret but in Publick  There is my dear Lord  Nowhere  of all Men the most gracious and most obliging the Terror of all Valets de Chambre whom he oppresses with good Breeding in enquiring for my good Lord and for my good Lady's Health This imi∣table Courtier will whisper a PrivyCounsellor's Lacquey with the utmost Goodness and Conde∣scention to know when they next sit and is throughly taken up and thinks he has a Part in a Secret if he knows that there is a Secret  What it is  he will whisper you  that Time will discover  then he shrugs and calls you back a∣gain  Sir I need not say to you That these Things are not to be spoken ofAnd hark'ee No Names I would not be quoted  What adds to the Jest is that his Emptiness has its Moods and Seasons  and he will not condescend to let you into these his Discoveries except he is in very good Hu∣mour or has seen some Body in Fashion talk to you He will keep his  Nothing  to himself and pass by and overlook as well as the best of 'em not observing that he is insolent when he is gra∣cious and obliging when he is haughty Show me a Woman so inconsiderable as this frequent Character  But my Mind now I am in turns to many no less observable Thou dear  Will Shoestring  I profess my self in Love with thee How shall I speak thee How shall I address thee How shall I draw thee Thou dear Outside Will you be combing your Wig Playing with your Box or Picking your Teeth Or chusest thou rather to be Speaking to be speaking for thy only Purpose in Speaking to shew your Teeth Rub 'em no longer dear  Shoestring  Do not premeditate Mur∣der Do not for ever Whiten Oh That for my Quiet and his own they were rotten  But I will forget him and give my Hand to the courteous  Umbra  He is a fine Man indeed but the soft Creature bows below my ApronString before he takes it yet after the first Ce∣remonies he is as familiar as my Physician and his Insignificancy makes me half ready to com∣plain to him of all I would to my Doctor He is so courteous that he carries half the Messages of Ladies Ails in Town to their

says  Madam all the good  Offices in my Power while I have any Knowledge or Credit shall be at your Service  The Conside∣ration of so shallow a Being and the intent Ap∣plication with which he pursues Trifles has made me carefully reflect upon that Sort of Men we usually call an  Impertinent  And I am upon mature Deliberation so far from being offended with him that I am really obliged to him for though he will take you aside and talk half an Hour upon Matters wholly insignificant with the most solemn Air yet I consider that these Things are of Weight in his Imagination and he thinks he is communicating what is for my Service If therefore it be a just Rule to judge of a Man by his Intention according to the Equity of Good∣breeding he that is impertinently kind or wise to do you Service ought in Return to have a pro∣portionable Place both in your Aff ction and E∣steem so that the courteous  Umbra  deserves the Favour of all his Acquaintance for though he never serv'd 'em he is ever

and the warm Inclination I feel within me to stem as far I can the prevailing Torrent of Vice and Ignorance so I cannot more properly pursue that noble Impulse than by setting forth the Excellence of Virtue and Knowledge in their native and beautiful Colours For this Reason I made my late Excursion to  Oxford  where those Qualities appear in their highest Lustre and are the only Pretences to Honour and Di∣stinction Superiority is there given in Propor∣tion to Men's Advancement in Wisdom and Learning and that just Rule of Life is so uni∣versally received among those happy People that you shall see an Earl walk bearheaded to the Son of the meanest Artificer in Respect to seven Years more Worth and Knowledge than the Nobleman is possess'd of In other Places they bow to Men's Fortunes but here to their Understandings It is not to be express'd how pleasing the Order the Discipline the Regula∣rity of their Lives is to a Philosopher who has by many Years Experience in the World learn'd to contemn every Thing but what is re∣ver'd in this Mansion of select and welltaught Spirits The Magnificence of their Palaces the Greatness of their Revenues the Sweetness of their Groves and Retirements seem equally a∣dapted  for the Residence of Princes and Philoso∣phers and a Familiarity with Objects of Splen∣dour as well as Places of Recess prepares the Inhabitants with an Equanimity for their future Fortunes whether humble or illustrious How was I pleas'd when I look'd round at St  Mary  's and could in the Faces of the ingenious Youth see Ministers of State Chansellors Bishops and Judges Here only is Humane Life Here only the Life of Man is a Rational Being Here Men understand and are employed in Works worthy their noble Nature This transitory Being passes away in an Employment not unworthy a future State the Contemplation of the great Decrees of Providence Each Man lives as if he were to answer the Questions made to  Job Where wast thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth Who shut up the Sea with Doors and said Hither∣to shalt thou come and no further  Such Specu∣lations make Life agreeable make Death wel∣come  But alas I was torn from this noble Society by the Business of this dirty mean World and the Cares of Fortune For I was oblig'd to be in  London  against the th Day of the Term and accordingly govern'd my self by my  Oxford  Al∣manack and came last Night but find to my great Astonishment that this ignorant Town began the Term on the th of the last Month in Opposition to all the Learning and Astronomy of the famous University of which I have been speaking according to which the Term cer∣tainly was to commence on the st Instant You may be sure a Man who has turn'd his Studies as I have could not be mistaken in Point of Time for knowing I was come to Town in Term I examin'd the passing Moments very narrowly and called an eminent Astronomer to my Assistance Upon very strict Observation  we sound that the Cold has been so severe this last Winter which is allow'd to have a benum∣ming Quality that it retarded the Earth in mo∣ving round from  Christmas  to this Season full Seven Days and Two Seconds My Learned Friend assured me further That the Earth had lately received a Shog from a Comet that cross'd its Vortex which if it had come Ten Degrees nearer us had made us lose this whole Term I was indeed once of Opinion That the  Grego∣rian  Computation was the most regular as be∣ing Eleven Days before the  Julian  but am now fully convinc'd that we ought to be Seven Days after the Chancellor and Judges and Eighteen before the Pope of  Rome  and that the  Oxonion  Computation is the best of the Three  These are the Reasons which I have gather'd from Philosophy and Nature to which I can add other Circumstances in Vindication of the Account of this Learned Body who publish'd this Almanack  It is notorious to Philosophers that Joy and Grief can hasten and delay Time Mr  Lock  is of Opinion That a Man in great Misery may so far lose his Measures as to think a Minute an Hour or in Joy make an Hour a Minute Let us examine the present Case by this Rule and we shall find that the Cause of this general Mi∣stake in the  British  Nation has been the great Success of the last Campaigne and the follow∣ing Hopes of Peace Stocks ran so high at the  Change  that the Citizens had gain'd Three Days of the Courtiers and we have indeed been so happy this Reign that it the University did not rectify our Mistakes we should think our selves but in the Second Year of Her pretent Majesty It would be endless to enumerate the many Da∣mages that have happened by this Ignorance of  the Vulgar All the Recognizances within the Diocese of  Oxford  have been forfeited for not appearing on the First Day of this Fictitious Term The University has been Nonsuited in their Action against the Booksellers for printing  Clarendon  in  Quarto  Indeed what gives me the most quick Concern is the Case of a poor Gentleman my Friend who was t'other Day taken in Execution by a Set of ignorant Bai∣liffs He should it seems have pleaded in the first Week of Term but being a Master of Arts of  Oxford  he would not recede from the  Oxonian  Computation He shew'd Mr  Broad  the  Almanack  and the very Day when the Term began but the merciless ignorant Fel∣low against all Sense and Learning would hur∣ry him away He went indeed quietly enough but he has taken exact Notes of the Time of Arrest and sufficient Witnesses of his being car∣ried into Gaol and has by Advice of the Recorder of  Oxford  brought his Action and we doubt not but we shall pay 'em off with Da∣mages and blemish the Reputation of Mr  Broad  We have one convincing Proof which all that frequent the Courts of Justices are Witnesses of The Dog that comes constantly to  Westminster  on the First Day of the Term did not appear till the First Day according to the  Oxford Al∣manack  whose Instinct I take to be a better Guide than Men's erroneous Opinions which are usually byass'd by Interest I judge in this Case as King  Charles  II victual'd his Navy with the Bread which one of his Dogs chose of several Pieces thrown before him rather than trust to the Asseverations of the Victuallers Mr  Cowper  and other learned Council have already urg'd the Authority of this Almanack in Behalf of their Clients We shall therefore go on with all Speed in our Cause and doubt not but Chancery will give at the End what  we lost in the Beginning by protracting the Term for us till  Wednesday  come Se'nnight And the University  Orator  shall for ever pray  c  From my own Apartment  July  The Subject of Duels has I find been started with so good Success that it has been the fre∣quent Subject of Conversation among polite Men and a Dialogue of that Kind has been transmit∣ted to me  verbatim  as follows The Persons concern'd in it are Men of Honour and Expe∣rience in the Manners of Men and have fallen upon the truest Foundation as well as search'd the Bottom of this Evil  Mr  Sage  If it were in my Power every Man that drew his Sword unless in the Service or purely to defend his Life Person or Goods from Violence I mean abstracted from all Puncto's or Whims of Honour should ride the Wooden Horse in the  TiltYard  for such First Offence for the Second stand in the Pillory and for the Third be Prisoner in  Bedlam  for Life  Colonel  Plume  I remember that a Rencoun∣ter or Duel was so far from being in Fashion a∣mong the Officers that serv'd in the Parliament Army that on the contrary it was as disrepu∣table and as great an Impediment to Advance∣ment in the Service as being bashful in Time of Action  Sir  Mark  Yet I have been inform'd by some old Cavaliers of famous Reputation for brave and gallant Men that they were much more in Mode among their Party than they have been during this last War  Col  Plume  That is true too Sir  Mr  Sage  By what you say Gentlemen one should think that our present Military Officers are compounded of an equal Proportion of both those Tempers since Duels are neither quite discountenanc'd nor much in vogue  Sir  Mark  That Difference of Temper in Re∣gard to Duels which appears to have been be∣tween the Court and ParliamentMen of the Sword was not I conceive for Want of Cou∣rage in the latter nor of a liberal Education because there were some of the best Families in  England  engag'd in that Party but Gallantry and Mode which glitter agreeably to the Imagi∣nation were encouraged by the Court as pro∣moting its Splendour and it was as natural that the contrary Party who were to recommend themselves to the Publick for Men of serious and solid Parts should deviate from every Thing Chimerical  Mr  Sage  I have never read of a Duel among the  Romans  and yet their Nobility used more Liberty with their Tongues than one may do now without being challeng'd  Sir  Mark  Perhaps the  Romans  were of Opi∣nion that ill Language and brutal Manners re∣flected only on those who were guilty of them and that a Man's Reputation was not at all clear'd by cutting the Person's Throat who had reflected upon it But the Custom of those Times had fixed the Scandal in the Action whereas now it lies in the Reproach  Mr  Sage  And yet the only Sort of Duel that one can conceive to have been fought upon Mo∣tives truly honourable and allowable was that between the  Horatii  and  Curiatii  Sir  Mark  Colonel  Plume  Pray what was the Method of Single Combat in your Time among the Cavaliers I suppose that as the Use of Clothes continues though the Fashion of them  has been mutable so Duels tho' still in Use have had in all Times their particular Modes of Performance  Col  Plume  We had no constant Rule but generally conducted our Dispute and Tilt accord∣ing to the last that had happen'd between Per∣sons of Reputation among the very Top Fellows for Bravery and Gallantry  Sir  Mark  If the Fashion of Quarrelling and Tilting was so often chang'd in your Time Colonel  Plume  a Man might fight yet lose his Credit for want of understanding the Fa∣shion  Col  Plume  Why Sir  Mark  in the Beginning of  July  a Man would have been censur'd for want of Courage or been thought indigent of the true Notions of Honour if he had put up Words which in the End of  September  follow∣ing one could not resent without passing for a brutal and quarrelsome Fellow  Sir  Mark  But Colonel Were Duels or Ren∣counters most in Fashion in those Days  Col  Plume  Your Men of nice Honour Sir were for avoiding all Censure of Advan∣tage which they suppos'd might be taken in a Rencounter therefore they us'd Seconds who were to see that all was upon the Square and make a faithful Report of the whole Combat but in a little Time it became a Fashion for the Seconds to fight and I'll tell you how it hap∣pened  Mr  Sage  Pray do Colonel  Plume  and the Method of a Duel at that Time and give us some Notion of the Puncto's upon which your nice Men quarrelled in those Days  Col  Plume  I was going to tell you Mr  Sage  That one Cornet  Modish  had desned his Friend Captain  Smart  's Opinion in some Affair but did not follow it upon which Captain  Smart  sent  Major  Adroit  a very Topping Fellow of those Times to the Person that had slighted his Ad∣vice The Major never enquired into the Quar∣rel because it was not the manner then among the very Topping Fellows but got two Swords of an equal Length and then waited upon Cor∣net  Modish  desiring him to choose his Sword and meet his Friend Captain  Smart  Cornet  Modish  came with his Friend to the Place of Combat there the Principals put on their Pumps and strip∣ed to their Shirts to show they had nothing but what Men of Honour carry about 'em and then engag'd  Sir  Mark  And did the Seconds stand by Sir  Col  Plume  It was a received Custom till that Time but the Swords of those Days being pretty long and the Principals acting on both Sides upon the Defensive and the Morning be∣ing frosty Major  Adroit  desired that the other Second who was also a very Topping Fellow would try a Thrust or Two only to keep them warm till the Principals had decided the Mat∣ter which was agreed to by  Modish  's Second who presently whipt  Adroit  through the Body disarm'd him and then parted the Principals who had receiv'd no Harm at all  Mr  Sage  But was not  Adroit  laugh'd at  Col  Plume  On the Contrary the very Top∣ping Fellows were ever after of Opinion That no Man who deserved that Character could serve as a Second without Fighting and the Smarts and Modishes finding their Account in it the Humour took without Opposition  Mr  Sage  Pray Colonel How long did that Fashion continue  Col  Plume  Not long neither Mr  Sage  for as soon as it became a Fashion the very Top∣ping Fellows thought their Honour reflected up∣on  if they did not proffer themselves as Seconds when any of their Friends had a Quarrel so that sometimes there were a Dozen of a Side  Sir  Mark  Bless me If that Custom had con∣tinued we should have been at a Loss now for our very Pretty Fellows for they seem to be the proper Men to officer animate and keep up an Army But pray Sir How did that sociable Manner of Tilting grow out of Mode  Col  Plume  Why Sir I'll tell you It was a Law among the Combatants That the Party which happen'd to have the first Man disarm'd or kill'd should yield as vanquish'd which some People thought might encourage the Modishes and Smarts in quarrelling to the Destruction of only the very Topping Fellows and as soon as this Reflection was started the very Topping Fellows thought it an Incumbrance upon their Honour to fight at all themselves Since that Time the Modishes and the Smarts through∣out all  Europe  have extoll'd the  French  King's Edict  Sir  Mark  Our very pretty Fellows whom I take to be the Successors of the very Topping Fellows think a Quarrel so little Fashionable that they will not be expos'd to it by another Man's Vanity or Want of Sense  Mr  Sage  But Colonel I have observ'd in your Account of Duels that there was a great Exactness in avoiding all Advantage that might possibly be between the Combatants  Col  Plume  That's true Sir for the Wea∣pons were always equal  Mr  Sage  Yes Sir but suppose an active adroit strong Man had insulted an aukward or a feeble or an unpractis'd Swordsman  Col  Plume  Then Sir they fought with Pi∣stols  Mr  Sage  But Sir there might be a certain Advantage that Way for a good Marksman will be sure to hit his Man at Yards Distance and a Man whose Hand shakes which is com∣mon to Men that debauch in Pleasures or have not us'd Pistols out of their Holsters won't venture to fire unless he touches the Person he shoots at Now Sir I am of Opinion that one can get no Honour in killing a Man if one has it all Rug as the Gamesters say when they have a Trick to make the Game secure though they seem to play upon the Square  Sir  Mark  In Truth Mr  Sage  I think such a Fact must be Murder in a Man's own private Conscience whatever it may appear to the World  Col  Plume  I have known some Men so nice that they would not fight but upon a Cloak without Pistols  Mr  Sage  I believe a Custom well establish∣ed would outdo the Grand Monarch's Edict  Sir  Mark  And Bullies would then leave off their long Swords but I don't find that a very Pretty Fellow can stay to change his Sword when he is insulted by a Bully with a long Diego tho' his own at the same Time be no longer than a Penknife which will certainly be the Case if such little Swords are in Mode Pray Colonel how was it between the Hectors of your Time and the very Topping Fellows  Col  Plume  Sir Long Swords happened to be generally worn in those Times  Mr  Sage  In answer to what you were saying Sir  Mark  give me Leave to inform you that your KnightsErrant who were the very Pretty Fel∣lows of those Ancient Times thought they could not honourably yield though they had fought their own trusty Weapons to the Stumps but would venture as boldly with the Page's Leaden  Sword as if it had been of enchanted Meta  Whence I conceive there must be a Spice o  Romantick Gallantry in the Composition of tha  very Pretty Fellow  Sir  Mark  I am of Opinion Mr  Sage  tha  Fashion governs a very pretty Fellow Nature  or common Sense your ordinary Persons an  sometimes Men of fine Parts  Mr  Sage  But what is the Reason that Me  of the most excellent Sense and Morals in other Points associate their Understandings with the very Pretty Fellows in that Chimaera of a Duel  Sir  Mark  There's no disputing against so great a Majority  Mr  Sage  But there is one Scruple Col  Plume  and I have done Don't you believe there may be some Advantage even upon a Cloak with Pistols Which a Man of nice Honour would scruple to take  Col  Plume  Faith I can't tell Sir but since one may reasonably suppose that in such a Case there can be but one so far in the Wrong as to occasion Matters to come to that Extremity I think the Chance of being kill'd should fall but on one whereas by their close and desperate Manner of Fighting it may very probably hap∣pen to both  Sir  Mark  Why Gentlemen if they are Men of such nice Honour and must fight there will be no fear of foul Play if they threw up Cross or Pile who should be shot  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturday July  to  Tuesd July    Will's Coffee house  July  LEtters from the City of  London  give an Ac∣count of a very great Consternation that  ace is in at present by reason of a late Enquiry  ade at  Guildhall  Whether a Noble Person has  rts enough to deserve the Enjoyment of the  reat Estate of which he is possess'd The City  apprehensive that this Precedent may go fur∣  er than was at first imagin'd The Person a∣  inst whom this Inquisition is set up by his Re∣  tions is a Peer of a neighbouring Kingdom  d has in his Youth made some few Bulls by  hich it is insinuated that he has forfeited his  oods and Chattels This is the more astonish∣  g in that there are many Persons in the said  ity who are still more guilty than his Lord∣  ip and who though they are Ideots do not  nly possess but have also themselves acquired  reat Estates contrary to the known Laws of  is Realm which vests their Possessions in the Crown  There is a Gentleman in the Coffeehouse at  is Time exhibiting a Bill in  Chancery  against  s Father's younger Brother who by some  range Magick has arrived at the Value of half  Plumb as the Citizens call an Hundred Thou∣  nd Pounds and in all the Time of growing up  that Wealth was never known in any of his  rdinary Words or Actions to discover any Proof  of Reason Upon this Foundation my Friend ha  set forth that he is illegally Master of his Cof∣fers and has writ two Epigrams to signify his own Pretensions and Sufficiency for spending that Estate He has inserted in his Plea some Things which I fear will give Offence for he pretends to argue that tho' a Man has a little of the Knave mix'd with the Fool he is neverthe∣less liable to the Loss of Goods and makes the Abuse of Reason as just an Avoidance of an E∣state as the total Absence of it This is what can never pass but witty Men are so full of them∣selves that there is no perswading 'em and my Friend will not be convinc'd but that upon quo∣ting  Solomon  who always used the Word  Fool  as a Term of the same Signification with Unjust and makes all Deviation from Goodness and Virtue to come under the Notion of  Folly  I say he doubts not but by the Force of this Autho∣rity let his Ideot Uncle appear never so great a Knave he shall prove him a Fool at the same Time  This Affair led the Company here into an Exa∣mination of these Points and none coming here but Wits what was asserted by a young Lawyer that a Lunatick is in the Care of the  Chancery  but a Fool in that of the Crown was received with general Indignation  'Why that says old  Renault  Why that Why must a Fool be a Courtier more than a Madman This is the Iniquity of this dull Age I remember the Time when it went on the mad Side all your Top Wits were Scowrers Rakes Roarers and Demolishers of Windows I knew a mad Lord who was drunk five Years together and was the Envy of that Age who is faintly imi∣tated by the dull Pretenders to Vice and Mad∣ness in this Had he lived to this Day there had not been a Fool in Fashion in the whole  Kingdom When  Renault  had done speaking a very worthy Man assumed the Discourse This is said he Mr  Bickerstaff  a proper Ar∣gument for you to treat in your Article from this Place and if you would send your  Pacolet  into all our Brains you would find that a little Fibre or Valve scarce discernable makes the Distinction between a Politician and an Ideot We should therefore throw a Veil upon those unhappy Instances of humane Nature who seem to breath without the Direction of Rea∣son and Understanding as we should avert our Eyes with Abhorrence from such as live in per∣petual Abuse and Contradiction to these noble Faculties Shall this unfortunate Man be di∣vested of his Estate because he is tractable and indolent runs in no Man's Debt invades no Man's Bed nor spends the Estate he owes his Children and his Character when one who shews no Sense above him but in such Practi∣ces shall be esteem'd in his Senses and possibly may pretend to the Guardianship of him who is no Ways his Inferior but in being less wick∣ed We see old Age brings us indifferently in∣to the same Impotence of Soul wherein Nature has plac'd this Lo  d'  There is something very fantastical in the Di∣stribution of Civil Power and Capacity among Men The Law certainly gives these Persons in∣to the Ward and Care of the Crown because that is best able to protect 'em from Injuries and the Impositions of Craft and Knavery that the Life of an Ideot may not ruin the Intail of a noble House and his Weakness may not frustrate the Industry or Capacity of the Founder of his Family But when one of bright Parts as we say with his Eyes open and all Men's Eyes upon him de∣stroys those Purposes there is no Remedy Folly and Ignorance are punish'd Folly and Guilt are  tolerated Mr  Lock  has somewhere made a  ¦stinction between a Madman and a Fool A Fo  is he that from right Principles makes a wro  Conclusion but a Madman is one who draws  just Inference from false Principles Thus th  Fool who cut off the Fellow's Head that lay aslee  and hid it and then waited to see what he wou  say when he awak'd and miss'd his Headpiece was in the Right in the first Thought that a Ma  would be surprized to find such an Alteration i  Things since he fell asleep but he was a littl  mistaken to imagine he could awake at all afte  his Head was off A Madman fancies himself a Prince but upon his Mistake he acts suitably  that Character and tho' he is out in supposion he has Principalities while he drinks Gruel and lies in Straw yet you shall see him keep the Port of a distressed Monarch in all his Words and Actions These Two Persons are equally taken into Custody But what must be done to half this good Company who every Hour of their Life are knowingly and wittingly both Fools and Madmen and yet have Capacities both of form∣ing Principles and drawing Conclusions with the full Use of Reason  From my own Apartment  July  This Evening some Ladies came to visit my Sister  Jenny  and the Discourse after very ma∣ny frivolous and publick Matters turned up∣on the main Point among the Women the Pas∣sion of Love  Sappho  who always leads on this Occasion began to show her Reading and told us That Sir  John Suckling  and  Milton  had upon a parallel Occasion said the tenderest Things she had ever read The Circumstance said she is such as gives us a Notion of that Protecting Part which is the Duty of Men in their honourable Designs upon or Possession of  omen In  Suckling  's Tragedy of  Brennoralt  e makes the Lover steal into his Mistress's Bed∣  amber and draw the Curtains then when  is Heart is full of her Charms as she lies sleep∣  g instead of being carried away by the Vio∣  ce of his Desires into Thoughts of a warmer  ature Sleep which is the Image of Death  ives this generous Lover Reflections of a diffe∣  ent Kind which regard rather her Safety than  is own Passion For beholding her as she lies  eeping he utters these Words  So Misers look upon their Gold  Which while they joy to see they fear to lose  The Pleasure of the Sight scarce equalling  The Jealousy of being dispossess'd by others  Her Face is like the  Milky Way  i'th' Sky  A Meeting of gentle Lights without Name  Heav'ns Shall this fresh Ornament of the World  These precious LoveLines pass with other common Things  Amongst the Wasts of Time What Pity 'twere  When  Milton  makes  Adam  leaning on his Arm beholding  Eve  and lying in the Contemplation of her Beauty he describes utmost Tender∣ness and Guardian Affection in one Word  Adam  with Looks of Cordial Love  Hung over her enamour'd  This is that Sort of Passion which truly de∣serves the Name of Love and has something more generous than Friendship it self for it has a constant Care of the Object beloved ab∣stracted from its own Interests in the  osses∣sion of it  Sappho  was proceeding on the Sub∣ject when my Sister produced a Letter sent to her in the Time of my Absence in Celebration of the Marriage State which is the Condition  wherein only this Sort of Passion reigns in  Authority The Epistle is as follows  Dear Madam  YOur Brother being absent I dare take the Liberty of writing to you my Thought of that State which our whole Sex either is or desires to be in You'll easily guess I mean Ma∣trimony which I hear so much decry'd that it was with no small Labour I maintained my Ground against Two Opponents but as your Brother observ'd of  Socrates  I drew them into my Conclusion from their own Concessions thus  In Marriage are Two happy Things allow'd  A Wife in Wedding Sheets and in a Shrowd  How can a Marriage State then be accurs'd  Since the last Day's as happy as the First  If you think they were too easily confuted you may conclude them not of the First Sense by their talking against Marriage  Yours  Mariana  I observed  Sappho  began to redden at this Epistle and turning to a Lady who was play∣ing with a Dog she was so fond of as to carry him Abroad with her Nays says she I cannot blame the Men if they have mean Ideas of our Souls and Affections and wonder so many are brought to take us for Companions for Life when they see our Endearments so triflingly placed For to my knowledge Mr  Truman  would give half his Estate for half the Affection you have shown to that  Shock  Nor do I believe you would be ashamed to confess that I saw you cry when he had the Cholick last Week  with lapping sour Milk What more could you do for your Lover himself What more replied the Lady There is not a Man in  England  for whom I could lament half so much Then she stifled the Animal with Kisses and call'd him Beau Life Dear Monsieur Pretty Fellow and what not in the Hurry of her Impertinence  Sappho  rose up as she always does at any Thing The observes done which discovers in her own Sex a Levity of Mind which renders 'em iucon∣siderable in the Opinion of ours  St James's Coffeehouse  July  Letters from the  Hague  of the th Instant  N S  say That the Siege of  Tournay  went on with all imaginable Success and that

that their present Body of Men in Arms consisted of Six Thousand This sudden Insurrection has put the Court of  France  under great Difficulties and the King has gi∣ven Orders That the main Body of

being such that the People are not by any Means to be kept in Obedience except by the Terror of Military Execution What makes the Distres∣ses still greater is That the Court begins to be doubtful of

of giving out of Orders in the Artillery Company and they prepare for a Day of Action with so little Concern as only to call it  An Exercise of Arms  An Exercise at Arms of the Artillery Company to be performed on  Wednesday June  un∣der the Command of Sir  Joseph Woolf  Knight and Alderman General  Charles Hoplon  Esquire present Sheriff LieutenantGeneral Captain  Richard Synge  Major Major  John Shorey  Captain of Granadiers Capt  Wil∣liam Grayhurst  Capt  John Butler  Capt  Ro∣bert Carellis  Captains  THE Body march from the  ArtilleryGround  through  Moregate Coleman street Lothbu∣ry Broad street FinchLane Cornhill Cheapside  St  Martins  St  Anne'sLane  Hault the Pikes under the Wall in  Noblestreet  Draw up the Firelocks facing the  Goldsmiths  Hall make Ready and Face to the Left and Fire and so  ditto  Three Times Beat to Arms and March round the Hall as up  LadLane GutterLane HoneyLane  and so Wheel to the Right and make your Salute to my Lord and so down St  Anne  's  Lane  up  Aldersgatestreet Barbican  and draw up in  RedCross street  the Right at St  Paul  's  Alley  in the Rear March off Lieu∣tenantGeneral with Half the Body up  BeechLane  He sends a SubDivision up  KingsHeadCourt  and takes Post in it and marches Two Divisions round into  RedLionMarket  to de∣fend that Pass and succour the Division in  KingsHeadCourt  but keeps in  WhiteCrossstreet  facing  BeechLane  the rest of the Body ready drawn up Then the General marches up  BeechLane  is attacked but forces the Di∣vision in the Court into the Market and enters with Three Divisions while he presses the Lieu∣tenantGeneral's Main Body and at the same Time the Three Divisions force those of the Revolters out of the Market and so all the LieutenantGeneral's Body retreats into  Chis∣welstreet  and lodges Two Divisions in  Grubstreet  and as the General marches on they fall on his Flank but soon made to give Way but having a RetreatingPlace in  RedLionCourt  but could not hold it being put to Flight thro'  Paul  's  Alley  and pursued by the General's Gra∣nadiers while he marches up and attacks their main Body but are opposed again by a Party of Men as lay in  BlackRavenCourt  but they are forced also to Retire soon in the utmost Confusion and at the same Time those Brave Divisions in  Paul  's  Alley  ply their Rear with Granadiers that with Precipitation they take to the Rout along  BunhillRow  So the General marches into the  ArtilleryGround  and being drawn up finds the Revolting Party to have found Entrance and makes a Show as if for a Battle and both Armies soon Engage in Form and Fire by Platoons  Much might be said for the Improvement of this System which for its Style and Invention may instruct Generals and their Historians both in fighting a Battle and describing it when 'tis over These elegant Expressions  DittoAnd soBut soonBut havingBut could notBut areBut theyFinds the Party to have found  cdo certainly give great Life and Spirit to the Relation  Indeed I am extremely concerned for the Lieu∣tenantGeneral who by his Overthrow and De∣feat is made a deplorable Instance of the For∣tune of War and Vicissitudes of humane Affairs He alas has lost in  BeechLane  and  Chiswelstreet  all the Glory he lately gain'd in and about  Hol∣born  and St  Giles  's The Art of Subdividing first and Dividing afterwards is new and sur∣prising and according to this Method the Troops are disposed in  KingsHeadCourt  and  RedLionMarket  Nor is the Conduct of these Leaders less conspicuous in their Choice of the  Ground or Field of Battle Happy was it that the greatest Part of the Atchievements of this Day was to be performed near  Grubstreet  that there might not be wanting a sufficient Number of faithful Historians who being EyeWitnesses of these Wonders should impartially transmit them to Posterity But then it can never be e∣nough regretted that we are left in the Dark as to the Name and Title of that extraordinary Hero who commanded the Divisions in  Paul'sAlley  especially because those Divisions are just∣ly styled Brave and accordingly were to push the Enemy along  BunhillRow  and thereby occa∣sion a general Battle But  Pallas  appeared in the Form of a Shower of Rain and prevented the Slaughter and Desolation which were threat∣ned by these extraordinary Preparations  Hi Motus Animorum at{que} haec Certamina tanta  Pulveris exigui Jactu

Manners of Men There is one in the Room so very judicious that he manages Impertinents with the utmost Dexteri∣ty It was diverting this Evening to hear a Discourse between him and one of these Gen∣tlemen He told me before that Person join'd us that he was a  Questioner  who according to his Description is one who asks Questions not with a Design to receive Information but an Affectation to show his Uneasiness for Want of it He went on in asserting that there are Crowds of that modest Ambition as to aim no further than to demonstrate that they are in Doubt By this Time  Will Whynot  was  fate down by us  So Gentlemen  says he  In how many Days think you shall we be Masters of  Tournay  Is the Account of the Action of the  Vivarois  to be depended upon Could you have imagined  England  had so much Money in it as you see it has produced Pray Sirs What do you think Will the Duke of  Savoy  make an Irrup∣tion into  France  But  says he  Time will clear all these Mysteries  His Answer to himself gave me the Altitude of his Head and to all his Questions I thus answered very satisfactori∣ly  Sir have you heard that this  Slaughter∣ford  never own'd the Fact for which he died Have the NewsPapers mentioned that Matter But pray Can you tell me what Method will be taken to provide for these  Palatines  But this  as you say  Time will clear Ay ay  says he and whispers me  They will never let us into these Things beforehand  I whispered him again  We shall know it as soon as there is a Proclama∣tion  He tells me in t'other Ear  You are in the Right of it  Then he whispered my Friend to know what my Name was then made an obliging Bow and went to examine ano∣ther Table This led my Friend and me to weigh this wandring Manner in many other In∣cidents and he took out of his Pockets several little Notes or Tickets to sollicit for Votes to Employments As  "Mr  John Taplash  having served all Offices and being reduced to great Poverty desires your Vote for SingingClerk of

weakest Part about us I know a good Lady who has taken her Daughters from their old Dancingmaster to place them with another for no other Reason but because the new Man has broke his Leg which is so

such a Passage so that very Accusation is an Ar∣gument That there are such Beings in Humane Life as fall under our Description and our Dis∣course is not altogether fantastical and ground∣less But in

Tournay  an Account That we were in a fair Prospect of being Masters of the Town within seven Days after that Date Our Batteries had utterly overthrown those of the Enemy On the th Instant  N S  Gene∣ral  Schuylemburgh  had made a Lodgment on the Counterscarp of the Tenaille which Post was so weakly defended that we lost but Six Men in gaining it So that there seems Reason to hope that the

Facta  From  Thursd July  to  Saturd July    From my own Apartment  July  LOoking over some old Papers I found a little Treatise written by my GreatGrandfather concerning  Bribery  and thought his Manner of treating that Subject not unworthy my Remark He there has a Digression concerning a Possibi∣lity that in some Circumstances a Man may re∣ceive an Injury and yet be conscious to himself that he deserves it There are abundance of fine Things said on the Subject but the whole wrap'd up in so much Jingle and Pun which was the Wit of those Times that it is scarce in∣telligible but I thought the Design was well enough in the following Sketch of the old Gen∣tleman's Poetry For in this Case where Two are Rivals for the same Thing and propose to obtain it by Presents he that attempts the Judge's Ho∣nesty by making him Offers of Reward ought not to complain when he loses his Cause by a bet∣ter Bidder The good old Dogrel runs thus  A Poor Man once a Judge besought  To judge aright his Cause  And with a Pot of Oil salutes  This Judger of the Laws  My Friend quoth he thy Cause is good  He glad away did trudge  Anon his wealthy Foe did come  Before this partial Judge  An Hog well fed

happen'd this Evening to fall upon Characters drawn in Plays and a Gentle∣man remark'd That there was no Method in the World of knowing the Taste of an Age or Period of Time so good as by the Observations of the Persons represented in their Comedies There were several Instances produced as  Ben Johnson  's bringing in a Fellow smoaking as a Piece of Foppery but said the Gentleman who entertain'd us on this Subject this Matter is no where so observable as in the Difference of the Characters of Women on the Stage in the last Age and in this It is not to be supposed that it was a Poverty of Genius in  Shakespear  that his Women made so small a Figure in his Dialogues but it certainly is that he drew Women as they then were in Life for that Sex had not in those Days that Freedom in Conver∣sation and their Characters were only that they were Mothers Sisters Daughters and Wives There were not then among the Ladies shining Wits Politicians Virtuosae FreeThinkers and Disputants nay there was then hardly such a Creature ev'n as a Coquet But Vanity had quite another Turn and the most conspicuous  Woman at that Time of Day was only the best Housewife Were it possible to bring into Life an Assembly of Matrons of that Age and intro∣duce the learned Lady  Woodby  into their Com∣pany they would not believe the same Nation could produce a Creature so unlike any Thing they ever saw in it  But these Ancients would be as much astonish'd to see in the same Age so illustrious a Pattern to all who love Things Praiseworthy as the di∣vine  Aspasia  Methinks I now see her walking in her Garden like our first Parent with unaf∣fected Charms before Beauty had Spectators and bearing celestial conscious Virtue in her As∣pect Her Countenance is the lively Picture of her Mind which is the Seat of Honour Truth Compassion Knowledge and Innocence  There dwells the Scorn of Vice and Pity too  In the Midst of the most ample Fortune and Veneration of all that behold and know her without the least Affectation she consults Re∣tirement the Contemplation of her own Being and that supreme Power which bestowed it Without the Learning of Schools or Knowledge of a long Course of Arguments she goes on in a steady Course of uninterrupted Piety and Vir∣tue and adds to the Severity and Privacy of the last Age all the Freedom and Ease of this The Language and Mien of a Court she is possessed of in the highest Degree but the Simplicity and humble Thoughts of a Cottage are her more welcome Entertainments  Aspasia  is a Female Philosopher who does not only live up to the Resignation of the most retired Lives of the ancient Sages but also to the Schemes and Plans which they thought beautiful tho' inimi∣table This Lady is the most exact Oeconomist without appearing busie the most strictly vir∣tuous  without tasting the Praise of it and shuns Applause with as much Industry as others do Reproach This Character is so particular that it will very easily be fixed on her only by all that know her But I dare say she will be the last that finds it out  But alas If we have One or Two such La∣dies How many Dozens are there like the rest∣less  Poluglossa  who is acquainted with all the World but her self who has the Appearance of all and Possession of no one Virtue She has indeed in her Practice the Absence of Vice but her Dis∣course is the continual History of it and it is apparent when she speaks of the criminal Grati∣fications of others that her Innocence is only a Restraint with a certain Mixture of Envy She is so perfectly opposite to the Character of  Aspa∣sia  that as Vice is terrible to her only as it is the Object of Reproach so Virtue is agreeable only as it is attended with Applause  St James's Coffeehouse  July  It is now Twelve a Clock

Swadela Venusque  Hor  From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd July    White's Chocolatehouse  July  I Write from hence at present to complain That Wit and Merit are so little encouraged by People of Rank and Quality that the Wits of the Age are obliged to run within  TempleBar  for Patronage There is a deplorable In∣stance of this in the Case of Mr  Dy  who has dedicated his inimitable Comedy called  The Modern Prophets  to a worthy Knight to whom it seems he had before communicated his Plan which was  To Ridicule the Ridiculers of our esta∣blish'd Doctrine  I have elsewhere celebrated the Contrivance of this excellent  Drama  but was  not till I read the Dedication wholly let into the Religious Design of it I am afraid it has suf∣fered Discontinuance at this gay End of the Town for no other Reason but the  Piety  of the Purpose There is however in this Epistle the true Life of Panegyrical Performance and I do not doubt but if the Patron would part with it I can help him to others with good Pretensions to it  viz  of  Uncommon Understanding  who would give him as much as he gave for it I know perfectly well a Noble Person to whom these Words which are the Body of the Pane∣gyrick would fit to a Hair  Your Easiness of Humour or rather your harmo∣nious Disposition is so admirably mixed with your Composure that the rugged Cares and Disturbance that Publick Affairs brings with it which does so vexatiously affect the Heads of other great Men of Business  c  does scarce ever ruffle your un louded Brow so much as with a Frown And what above all is Praiseworthy you are so far from thinking your self better than others that a flourishing and opulent Fortune which by a certain natural Corrup∣tion in its Quality seldom fails to infect other Pos∣sessors with Pride seems in this Case as if only pro∣videntially disposed to enlarge your Humility  But I find Sir I am now got into a very large Field where tho' I could with great Ease raise a Number of Plants in Relation to your Merit of this plauditory Nature yet for Fear of an Author's general Vice and that the plain Justice I have done you should by my Proceeding and others mi∣staken Judgment be imagined Flattery a Thing the Bluntness of my Nature does not care to be con∣cern'd with and which I also know you abomi∣nate  It is wonderful to see how many Judges  these fine Things spring up every Day by th  Rise of Stocks and other elegant Methods  abridging the Way to Learning and Criticism  But I do hereby forbid all Dedications to any Per∣sons within the City of  London  except Sir  Fran∣cis  Sir  Stephen  and the Bank will take Epigrams and Epistles as Value received for their Notes and the  EastIndia  Companies accept of Heroick Poems for their Seal'd Bonds Upon which Bot∣tom our Publishers have full Power to treat with the City in Behalf of us Authors to enable Tra∣ders to become Patrons and Fellows of the Royal Society as well as receive certain Degrees of Skill in the  Latin  and  Greek  Tongues according to the Quantity of the Commodities which they take off our Hands  Grecian Coffeehouse  July  The Learned have so long laboured under the Imputation of Dryness and Dulness in their Ac∣counts of their Phaenomena that an ingenious Gentleman of our Society has resolved to write a System of Philosophy in a more lively Method both as to the Matter and Language than has been hitherto attempted He read to us the Plan upon which he intends to proceed I thought his Account by Way of Fable of the Worlds about us had so much Vivacity in it that I could not forbear transcribing his Hypothesis to give the Reader a Taste of my Friend's Treatise which is now in the Press  The Inferior Deities having designed on a Day to play a Game at Football knead toge∣ther a numberless Collection of dancing Atoms into the Form of Seven rowling Globes And that Nature might be kept from a dull In∣activity each separate Particle is endued with a Principle of Motion or a Power of Attra∣ction  whereby all the several Parcels of Mat∣ter draw each other proportionably to their Magnitudes and Distances into such a re∣markable Variety of different Forms as to produce all the wonderful Appearances we now observe in Empire Philosophy and Re∣ligion But to proceed  At the Beginning of the Game each of the Globes being struck forward with a vast Vio∣lence ran out of Sight and wander'd in a straight Line thro' the infinite Spaces The nim∣ble Deities pursue breathless almost and spent in the eager Chace each of them catched hold of one and stamped it with his Name as  Sa∣turn Jupiter Mars  and so of the rest To prevent this Inconveniene for the future the Seven are condemned to a Precipitation which in our inferior Style we call  Gravity  Thus the Tangential and Centripetal Forces by their Counterstruggle make the Celestial Bodies describe an exact Ellipsis  There will be added to this an Appendix in Defence of the First Day of the Term according to the  Oxford Almanack  by a learned Knight of this Realm with an Apology for the said Knight's Manner of Dress proving That his Ha∣bit according to this Hypothesis is the true  Mo∣dern  and  Fashionable  and that Buckles are not to be worn by this System till the th of  March  in the Year which according to the Computation of some of our greatest Divines is to be the first Year of the  Millennium  in which blessed Age all Habits will be reduced to a Primitive Simplicity and whoever shall be found to have persevered in a Constancy of Dress in Spight of all the Allurements of prophane and heathen Habits shall be rewarded with a neverfading Doublet of a Thousand Years All Points in the  System which are doubted shall be attested by the Knight's Extemporary Oath for the Satisfaction of his Readers  Will's Coffee house  July  We were upon the Heroick Strain this Even∣ing and the Question was What is the True Sublime Many very good Discourses happen'd thereupon after which a Gentleman at the Table who is it seems writing on that Sub∣ject assum'd the Argument and tho' he ran thro' many Instances of Sublimity from the an∣cient Writers said He had hardly known an Occasion wherein the true Greatness of Soul which animates a General in Action is so well represented with Regard to the Person of whom it was spoken and the Time in which it was writ as in a few Lines in a modern Poem There is continued he nothing so forc'd and constrain'd as what we frequently meet with in Tragedies to make a Man under the Weight of a great Sorrow or full of Meditation upon what he is soon to execute cast about for a Si∣mile to what he himself is or the Thing which he is going to act But there is nothing more proper and natural for a Poet whose Business is to describe and who is Spectator of one in that Circumstance when his Mind is working upon a great Image and that the Idea's hurry upon his Imagination I say there is nothing so natural as for a Poet to relieve and clear himself from the Burthen of Thought at that Time by uttering his Conception in Simile and Metaphor The highest Act of the Mind of Man is to possess it self with Tranquility in eminent Danger and to have its Thoughts so free as to act at that Time without Perplexity The ancient Authors have compared this sedate Courage to a Rock that remains immoveable  amidst the Rage of Winds and Waves but that is too stupid and inanimate a Similitude and could do no Credit to the Hero At other Times they are all of 'em wonderfully obliged to a  Lybian  Lion which may give indeed very agreeable Terrors to a Description but is no Compliment to the Person to whom it is appli∣ed Eagles Tygers and Wolves are made Use of on the same Occasion and very often with much Beauty but this is still an Honour done to the Brute rather than the Hero  Mars Pal∣las Bacchus  and  Hercules  have each of 'em furnish'd very good Similes in their Time and made doubtless a greater Impression on the Mind of a Heathen than they have on that of a modern Reader But the sublime Image that I am talking of and which I really think as great as ever enter'd into the Thought of Man is in the Poem call'd  The Campaign  where the Si∣mile of a ministring Angel sets forth the most sedate and the most active Courage engaged in an Uproar of Nature a Confusion of Ele∣ments and a Scene of Divine Vengeance Add to all That these Lines compliment the General and his Queen at the same Time and have all the natural Horrors heighten'd by the Image that was still fresh in the Mind of every Rea∣der  'Twas then Great  Marlbro  's mighty Soul was prov'd  That in the Shock of charging Hosts unmov'd  Amidst Confusion Horror and Despair  Examin'd all the dreadful Scenes of War  In peaceful Thought the Field of Death survey'd  To fainting Squadrons sent the timely Aid  Inspir'd repuls'd Battalions to engage  And taught the doubtful Battle where to rage  So when an Angel by Divine Command  With rising Tempests shakes a guilty Land  Such as of late o'er pale  Britannia  past  Calm and serene he drives the furious Blast  And pleas'd th' Almighty's Orders to perform  Rides in the Whirlwind and directs the Storm  The whole Poem is so exquisitely Noble and Poetick that I think it an Honour to our Na∣tion and Language The Gentleman concluded his Critick on this Work by saying that he esteemed it wholly new and a wonderful At∣tempt to keep up the ordinary Idea's of a March of an Army just as they happen'd in so warm and great a Style and yet be at once Familiar and Heroick Such a Performance is a Chroni∣cle as well as a Poem and will preserve the Me∣mory of our Hero when all the Edifices and Statues erected to his Honour are blended with common Dust  St James's Coffeehouse  July  Letters from the  Hague  of the d Instant  N S  say That the Allies were so forward in the Siege of  Tournay  that they were preparing for a general Assault which it was supposed would be made within a few Days Deserters from the Town gave an Account That the Garrison was carrying their Ammunition and Provisions into the Citadel which occasion'd a Tumult among the Inhabitants of the Town The  French  Army had laid Bridges over the  Scarp  and made a Motion as if they intended to pass that River but tho' they are joined by the Reinforcement expected from  Germany  it was not believed they would make any Attempt towards relieving  Tournay  Letters from

their Dominions to which Purpose a Procla∣mation was to be issued within few Days  They write from  France  That the great Mi∣sery and Want under which that Nation has so long laboured has ended in a Pestilence which began to appear in  Burgundy  and  Dauphin    They add That in the Town of  Mazon  Three Hundred Persons had died in the Space of Ten Days Letters from  Lisle  of the th Instant

was stopp'd in the Piazza by  Pacolet  to observe what he called the Triumph of Love and Youth I turned to the Object he pointed at and there I saw a gay gilt Chariot drawn by fresh prancing Horses the Coachman with a new Cockade and the Lacques with Insolence and Plenty in their Countenances I asked im∣mediately What young Heir or Lover own'd that glittering Equipage But my Companion interrupted Do not you see there the mourning  Aesculapius  The Mourning said I Yes  Isaac  said  Pacolet  He is in deep Mourning and is the languishing hopeless Lover of the divine  Hebe  the Emblem of Youth and Beauty The excellent and  learned Sage you behold in that Furniture is th  strongest Instance imaginable that Love is th  most powerful of all Things  You are not so ignorant as to be a Stranger to the Character of  Aesculapius  as the Patron and most successful of all who profess the Art of Me∣dicine But as most of his Operations are owing to a natural Sagacity or Impulse he has very little troubled himself with the Doctrine of Drugs but has always given Nature more Room to help her self than any of her learned Assistants and consequently has done greater Wonders than is in the Power of Art to perform For which Reason he is half deify'd by the People and has ever been justly courted by all the World as if he were a Seventh Son  It happen'd that the charming  Hebe  was re∣duced by a long and violent Fever to the most extreme Danger of Death and when all Skill fail'd they sent for  Aesculapius  The renowned Artist was touch'd with the deepest Compassion to see the faded Charms and faint Bloom of  Hebe  and had a generous Concern in beholding a Strug∣gle not between Life but rather between Youth and Death All his Skill and his Passion tended to the Recovery of  Hebe  beautiful even in Sickness But alas the unhappy Physician knew not that in all his Care he was only sharpening Darts for his own Destruction In a Word his Fortune was the same with that of the Statuary who fell in Love with the Image of his own making and the unfortunate  Aesculapius  is become the Patient of her whom he lately recovered Long before this Disaster  Aesculapius  was far gone in the unneces∣sary and superfluous Amusements of old Age in increasing unweildy Stores and providing in the midst of an Incapacity of Enjoyment of what he had for a Supply of more Wants than he had Calls for in Youth it self But these low Considerations  are now no more and Love has taken Place of Avarice or rather is become an Avarice of ano∣ther Kind which still urges him to pursue what he does not want But behold the Matamorphosis the anxious mean Cares of an Usurer are turned into the Languishments and Complaints of a Lover Behold says the aged  Aesculapius  I sub∣mit I own great Love thy Empire Pity  Hebe  the Fop you have made What have I to do with Guilding but on Pills Yet O Fair For thee I sit amidst a Crowd of painted Deities on my Chariot button'd in Gold clasp'd in Gold with∣out having any Value for that beloved Metal but as it adorns the Person and laces the Hat of thy dying Lover I ask not to live O  Hebe  Give me but gentle Death  Euthanasia Eutha∣nasia  that is all I implore When  Aesculapius  had finished his Complaint  Pacolet  went on in deep Morals on the Incertainty of Riches with this remarkable Exclamation O Wealth How im∣potent art thou And how little dost thou sup∣ply us with real Happiness when the Usurer himself can forget thee for the Love of what is as foreign to his Felicity as thou art  Will's Coffeehouse  July  The Company here who have all a delicate Taste of Theatrical Representations had made a Gathering to purchase the Moveables of the neighbouring Playhouse for the Encourage∣ment of one which is setting up in the  HayMar∣ket  But the Proceedings at the Auction by which Method the Goods have been sold this Evening have been so unfair that this generous Design has been frustrated for the  Imperial Mantle made for Cyrus  was missing as also the  Chariot and Two Dragons  But upon Examina∣tion it was found that a Gentleman of  Hamp∣shire  had clandestinely bought them both and is gone down to his Country Seat and that on  Saturday  last he passed through  Staines  attired in that Robe and drawn by the said  Dragons  as∣sisted by Two only of his own Horses This Theatrical Traveller has also left Orders with Mr  Hall  to send the faded Rainbow to the Scowrers and when it comes home to dispatch it after him At the same Time  C R  Esq  is invited to bring down his  Setting Sun  himself and be Boxkeeper to a Theatre erected by this Gentleman near  Southampton  Thus there has been nothing but Artifice in the Manage∣ment of this Affair for which Reason I beg Pardon of the Town that I inserted the Inven∣tory in my Paper and solemnly protest I knew nothing of this artful Design of vending these Ra∣rities But I meant only the Good of the World in that and all other Things which I divulge  And now I am upon this Subject I must do my self Justice in Relation to an Article in a former Paper wherein I made Mention of a Person who keeps a PuppetShow in the Town of  Bath  I was tender of naming Names and only just hinted that he makes larger Promises when he invites People to his Dramatick Repre∣sentations than he is able to perform But I am credibly informed that he makes a prophane lewd Jester whom he calls  Punch  speak to the Dishonour of  Isaac Bickerstaff  with great Familiarity and before all my learned Friends in that Place takes upon him to dis∣pute my Title to the Appellation of  Esquire  I think I need not say much to convince all the World that this Mr  Powell  for that is his Name is a pragmatical and vain Person to pre∣tend to argue with me on any Subject  Mecum certasse feretur  that is to say It will be an Ho∣nour to him to have it said he contended with me but I would have him to know that I can look beyond his Wires and know very well the  whole Trick of his Art and that it is only by these Wires that the Eye of the Spectator is cheated and hinder'd from seeing that there is a Thread on one of  Punch  's Chops which draws it up and lets it fall at the Discretion of the said  Powell  who stands behind and plays him and makes him speak sawcily of his Betters He To pretend to make Prologues against meBut a Man never behaves himself with Decency in his own Case therefore I shall command my self and never trouble me further with this little Fellow who is himself but a tall Puppet and has not Brains enough to make even Wood speak as it ought to do And I that have heard the Groaning Board can despise all that his Puppets shall be able to speak as long as they live But  Ex quovis Ligno non fit Mercurius  He has pretended to write to me also from the  Bath  and says He thought to have deferred gi∣ving me an Answer till he came  to his Books  but that my Writings might do well with the Wa∣ters Which are pert Expressions that become a Schoolboy better than one that is to teach others And when I have said a civil Thing to him he cries  Oh I thank you for thatI am your humble Servant for that  Ah Mr  Powell  these smart Civilities will never run down Men of Learning I know well enough your Design is to have all Men  Automata  like your Puppets but the World is grown too wise and can look through these thin Devices I know you design to make a Reply to this but be sure you stick close to my Words for if you bring me into Discourses concerning the Government of your Puppets I must tell you  I neither am nor have been nor will be at Leisure to answer you  It is really a burning Shame this Man should be tolerated in abusing the World with such Representations of Things But his Parts  decay and he is not much more alive than  Par∣tridge  From my own Apartment  July  I must beg Pardon of my Readers that for this Time I have I fear huddled up my Discourse having been very busy in helping an old Friend of mine out of Town He has a very good Estate is a Man of Wit but he had been Three Years absent from Town and can't bear a Jest for which Reason I have with some Pains con∣vinc'd him that he can no more live here than if he were a downright Bankrupt He was so fond of dear  London  that he began to fret only inwardly but being unable to laugh and be laugh'd at I took a Place in the Northern Coach for him and his Family and hope he is got to Night safe from all Sneerers in his own Parlour  St James's Coffeehouse  July  This Morning we received by Express the a∣greeable News of the Surrender of the Town of  Tournay  on the th Instant  N S  The Place was assaulted at the Attacks of General  Schuylemberg  and that of General  Lottum  at the same Time The Action at both those Parts of the Town was very obstinate and the Allies lost a considerable Number at the Beginning of the Dispute but the Fight was continued with so great Bravery that the Enemy observing our Men to be Masters of all the Posts which were necessary for a general Attack beat the  Cha∣made  and Hostages were receiv'd from the Town and others sent from the Befiegers in order to come to a formal Capitulation for the Surrender of the Place We have also this Day received Advice That Sir  John Leak  who lies off of  Dunkirk  had intercepted several Ships la∣den with Corn from the  Baltick  and that the  Dutch  Privateers had fallen in with others and carried them into  Holland  The  French  Letters advise That the young Son to the Duke of  An∣jou  lived but Eight Days  The TATLER N  o    Credo Pudicitiam Saturno Rege moratam  In Terris  From  Thursd July  to  Saturd July    White's Chocolatehouse  July  THE other Day I took a Walk a Mile or Two∣out of Town and strolling wherever Chance led me I was insensibly carried into a ByRoad along which was a very agreeable Quickset of an extraordinary Height which surrounded a very delicious Seat and Garden From one Angle of the Hedge I heard a Voice cry Sir SirThis rais'd my Curiosity and I heard the same Voice say but in a gentle Tone Come forward come forward I did so and one through the Hedge called me by my Name and bad me go on to the Left and I should be admitted to visit an old Acquaintance in Distress The Laws of Knight Errantry made me obey the Summons without Hesitation and I was let in at the BackGate of a lovely House by a MaidServant who carried me from Room to Room till I came into a Gallery at the End of which I saw a fine Lady dressed in the most sumptuous Habit as if she were going to a Ball but with the most abject and disconsolate Sorrow in her Face  that I ever beheld As I came near she burst into Tears and cry'd Sir Do not you know the unhappy  Teraminta  I soon recollected her whole Person But said I Madam The Sim∣plicity of Dress in which I have ever seen you at your good Father's House and the Chearful∣ness of Countenance with which you always appeared are so unlike the Fashion and Temper you are now in that I did not easily recover the Memory of you Your habit was then decent and modest your Looks serene and beautiful Whence then this unaccountable Change No∣thing can speak so deep a Sorrow as your present Aspect yet your Dress is made for Jollity and Re∣velling It is said she an unspeakable Pleasure to meet with one I know and to bewail my self to any that is not an utter Stranger to Humanity  When your Friend my Father died he left me to a wide World with no Defence against the Insults of Fortune but rather a Thousand Snares to intrap me in the Dangers to which Youth and Innocence are exposed in an Age wherein Honour and Virtue are become mere Words and used only as they serve to be∣tray those who understand them in their native Sense and obey them as the Guides and Mo∣tives of their Being The wickedest of all Men living the abandoned  Decius  who has no Know∣ledge of any good Art or Purpose of Humane Life but as it tends to the Satisfaction of his Ap∣petites had Opportunities of frequently seeing and entertaining me at a House where mixed Company boarded and where he placed him∣self for the base Intention which he has since brought to pass  Decius  saw enough in me to raise his brural Desires and my Circumstances gave him Hopes of accomplishing them But a l the glittering Expectations he could lay be∣fore me joined by my private Terrors of Po∣verty  it self could not for some Months prevail upon me yet however I hated his Intention I still had a secret Satisfaction in his Courtship and always exposed my self to his Solicitations See here the Bane of our Sex Let the Flatte∣ry be never so apparent the Flatterer never so ill thought of his Praises are still agreeable and we contribute to our own Deceit I was there∣fore ever fond of all Opportunities and Pretences of being in his Company In a Word I was at last ruined by him and brought to this Place where I have been ever since immur'd and from the fatal Day after my Fall from Inno∣cence my Worshipper became my Master and my Tyrant  Thus you see me habited in the most gorge∣ous Manner not in Honour of me as a Wo∣man he loves but as this Attire charms his own Eye and urges him to repeat the Gratifi∣cation he takes in me as the Servant of his brutish Lusts and Appetites I know not where to fly for Redress but am here pining away Life in the Solitude and Severity of a Nun but the Conscience and Guilt of an Harlot I live in this lewd Practice with a Religious Awe of my Minister of Darkness upbraided with the Support I receive from him for the inestimable Possession of Youth of Innocence of Honour and of Conscience I see Sir my Discourse grows painful to you all I beg of you is to paint in so strong Colours as to let  Decius  see I am discovered to be in his Possession that I may be turned out of this detestable Scene of regular Iniquity and either think no more or sin no more If your Writings have the good Effect of gaining my Enlargement I promise you I will atone for this unhappy Step by pre∣ferring an innocent laborious Poverty to all the guilty Affluence the World can offer me  Will's Coffeehouse  July  To show that I do not bear an irreconcilable Hatred to my mortal Enemy Mr  Powell  at  Bath  I do his Function the Honour to publish to the World that Plays represented by Puppets are permitted in our Universities and that Sort of  Drama  is not wholly thought unworthy the Critick of learned Heads But as I have been conversant rather with the greater Ode as I think the Criticks call it I must be so humble as to make a Request to Mr  Powell  and desire him to apply his Thoughts to answering the Difficulties with which my Kinsman the Au∣thor of the following Letter seems to be em∣barrassed  To my Honoured Kinsman  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Dear Cousin  HAD the Family of the  Beadlestaffs  where∣of I tho' unworthy am one known of your being lately at  Oxon  we had in our own Name and in the Universities as it is our Office made you a Compliment But your short Stay here robbed us of an Opportunity of paying our due Respects and you of re∣ceiving an ingenious Entertainment with which we at present divert our selves and Strangers A  PuppetShow  at this Time sup∣plies the Want of an  ACT  And since the Nymphs of this City are disappointed of a lus∣cious MusickSpeech and the Country Ladies of hearing their Sons or Brothers speak Ver∣ses yet the vocal Machines like them by the Help of a Prompter say Things as much to the Benefit of the Audience and almost as properly their own The Licence of a  TerraFilius  is refined to the wellbred Satyr of  Pun∣chenella  Now Cousin  Bickerstaff  tho'  Punch  has neither a  French  Nightcap nor Long Pockets yet you must own him to be a Pret∣ty Fellow a  very  Pretty Fellow Nay since he seldom leaves the Company without cal∣ling Son of a Whore demanding Satisfaction and Duelling he must be owned a  Smart  Fellow too Yet by some Indecencies towards the Ladies he seems to be of a Third Cha∣racter distinct from any you have yet touch'd upon A young Gentleman who sate next me for I had the Curiosity of seeing this Enter∣tainment in a tufted Gown red Stockings and long Wig which I pronounce to be tantamount to red Heels and a dangling Cane was enraged when  Punchenello  distur∣bed a soft LoveScene with his Ribaldry You would oblige us mightily by laying down some Rules for adjusting the extravagant Be∣haviour of this  Almanzor  of the Play and by writing a Treatise on this Sort of Dramatick Poetry so much favoured and so little un∣derstood by the learned World  From its being conveyed in a Cart after the  Thespian  Manner all the Parts being recited by one Person as the Custom was before  Aes∣chilus  and from the Behaviour of  Punch  as if he had won the Goal you may possibly deduce its Antiquity and settle the Chronology as well as some of our Modern Criticks In its natural Transitions from Mournful to Merry as from the Hanging of a Lover to Dancing upon the Rope from the Stalking of a Ghost to a Lady's presenting you with a Jig you may discover such a Decorum as is not to be found elsewhere than in our  TragiCome∣dies  But I forget my self 'tis not for me to dictate I thought fit dear Cousin to give you these Hints to shew you that the  Beadle∣staff's  don't walk before Men of Letters to no  Purpose and that tho' we do but hold up the Train of Arts and Sciences yet like other Pages we are now and then let into our La∣dies Secrets I am  Your most Affectionate Kinsman  Benjamin Beadlestaff  From Mother  Gour∣don  's at  Hedington  near  Oxon  June  From my own Apartment  July  I am got hither safe but never spent Time with so little Satisfaction as this Evening for you must know I was Five Hours with Three  Merry  and Two  Honest Fellows  The for∣mer sang Catches and the latter even died with laughing at the Noise they made Well says  Tom Belfrey  You Scholars Mr  Bickerstaff  are the worst Company in the World Ay says his Opposite You are dull to Night pri∣thee be merry With that I huzza'd and took a Jump cross the Table then came clever upon my Legs and fell a laughing Let Mr  Bicker∣staff  alone says one of the  Honest Fellows  when he's in a good Humour he's as good Company as any Man in  England  He had no sooner spoke but I snatched his Hat off his Head and clap'd it upon my own and burst out a laughing again upon which we all fell a laugh∣ing for half an Hour One of the  Honest Fel∣lows  got behind me in the Interim and hit me a sound Slap on the Back upon which he got the Laugh out of my Hands and it was such a Twang on my Shoulders that I confess he was much merrier than I I was half angry but resolved to keep up the good Humour of  the Company and after hollowing as loud as I could possibly I drank off a Bumper of Cla∣ret that made me stare again Nay says one of the  Honest Fellows  Mr  Isaac  is in the Right there is no Conversation in this What fignifies Jumping or hitting one another on the Back Let's drink about We did so from Seven a Clock till Eleven and now I am come hither and after the Manner of the wise  Pythagoras  begin to reflect upon the Passages of the Day I remember nothing but that I am bruised to Death and as it is my Way to write down all the good Things I have heard in the last Con∣versation to furnish my Paper I can from this only tell you my Sufferings and my Bangs  I nam'd  Pythagoras  just now and I protest to you as he believ'd Men after Death enter'd in∣to other Species I am now and then tempted to think other Animals enter into Men and could name several on Two Legs that never discover any Sentiment above what is common with the Species of a lower Kind as we see in these bo∣dily Wits whom I was with to Night whose Parts consist in Strength and Activity but their boisterous Mirth gives me great Impatience for the Return of such Happiness as I enjoyed in a Conversation last Week Among others in that Company we had  Florio  who never interrupt∣ed any Man living when he was speaking or ever ceased to speak but others lamented that he had done His Discourse ever arises from a Fulness of the Matter before him and not from Ostentation or Triumph of his Understanding for though he seldom delivers what he need fear being repeated he speaks without having that End in View and his Forbearance of Calumny or Bitterness is owing rather to his good Na∣ture than his Discretion for which Reason he is esteem'd a Gentleman perfectly qualified for  Conversation in whom a general Goodwill to Mankind takes off the Necessity of Caution and Circumspection  We had at the same Time that Evening the best Sort of Companion that can be a goodna∣tured old Man This Person meets in the Com∣pany of young Men Veneration for his Benevo∣lence and is not only valued for the good Quali∣ties of which he is Master but reaps an Accep∣tance from the Pardon he gives to other Men Faults And the ingenious Sort of Men with whom he converses have so just a Regard for him that he rather is an Example than a Check to their Behaviour For this Reason as  Senecio  never pretends to be a Man of Pleasure before Youth so young Men never set up for Wisdom before  Senecio  so that you never meet where he is those Monsters of Conversation who are grave or gay above their Years He never converses but with Followers of Nature and good Sense where all that is uttered is only the Effect of a communicable Temper and not of Emulation to excel their Companions all Desire of Su∣periority being a Contradiction to that Spirit which makes a just Conversation the very Es∣sence of which is mutual Goodwill Hence it is that I take it for a Rule that the natural and not the acquired Man is the Companion Learning Wit Gallantry and good Breeding are all but subordinate Qualities in Society and are of no Value but as they are subservient to Benevolence and tend to a certain Manner of being or appear∣ing equal to the rest of the Company for Con∣versation is composed of an Assembly of Men as they are Men and not as they are distinguish∣ed by Fortune Therefore he that brings his Qua∣lity with him into Conversation should always pay the Reckoning for he came to receive Homage and not to meet his FriendsBut  he Din about my Ears from the Clamour of  he People I was with this Evening has carried  e beyond my intended Purpose which was to  xplain upon the Order of  Merry Fellows  but I  hink I may pronounce of them as I heard good  enecio  with a Spice of the Wit of the last Age  ay  viz  That a  Merry Fellow  is the  Saddest Fel∣  ow  in the World  The TATLER N  o    Non bene conveniunt nec in una Sede morantur  Majestas Amor  From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd July    White's Chocolatehouse  July  WE see every Day Volumes written against that Tyrant of Humane Life called  Love  and yet there is no Help found against his Cruel∣ties or Barrier against the Inroads he is pleased to make into the Mind of Man After this Preface you will expect I am going to give par∣ticular Instances of what I have asserted That Expectation cannot be raised too high for the Novelty of the History and Manner of Life of the Emperor  Aurengezebe  who has resided for some Years in the Cities of  London  and  West∣minster  with the Air and Mien indeed of his Imperial Quality but the Equipage and Ap∣pointment only of a private Gentleman This Potentate for a long Series of Time appeared from the Hour of Twelve till that of Two at a Coffeehouse near the  Change  and had a Seat though without a Canopy sacred to himself  where he gave diurnal Audiences concerning Commerce Politicks Tare and Tret Usury and Abatement with all Things necessary for helping the Distressed who are willing to give one Limb for the better Maintenance of the rest or such joyous Youths whose Philo∣sophy is confined to the present Hour and were desirous to call in the Revenue of next half Year to double the Enjoyment of this Long did this growing Monarch employ himself after this Manner And as Alliances are necessary to all great Kingdoms he took particularly the Interests of  Lewis  the Fourteenth into his Care and Protection When all Mankind were at∣tacking that unhappy Monarch and those who had neither Valour or Wit to oppose against him would be still showing their impotent Ma∣lice by laying Wagers in Opposition to his In∣terests  Aurengezebe  ever took the Part of his Contemporary and laid immense Treasures on his Side in Defence of his important Magazine of  Toulon Aurengezebe  also had all this while a constant Intelligence with  India  and his Let∣ters were answered in Jewels which he soon made Brillant and caused to be affixed to his Imperial Castor which he always wears cock'd in Front to show his Defiance with an Hear of Imperial Snuff in the Middle of his ample Visage to show his Sagacity The Zealots for this little Spot called  Great Britain  fell uni∣versally into this Emperor's Policies and paid Homage to his superior Genius in forfeiting their Coffers to his Treasury  But Wealth and Wisdom are Possessions too solemn not to give Weariness to active Minds without the Relief in vacant Hours of Wit and Love which are the proper Amusements of the Powerful and the Wise This Emperor therefore with great Regularity every Day at Five in the  Afternoon leaves his MoneyChangers his Pub∣licans and little Hoarders of Wealth to their low Pursuits and ascends his Chariot to drive to  Will  's where the Taste is refined and a Re∣lish given to Mens Possessions by a polite Skill in gratifying their Passions and Appetites There it is that the Emperor has learned to live and to love and not like a Miser to gaze only on his Ingots or his Treasures but with a nobler Sa∣tisfaction to live the Admiration of others for his Splendour and Happiness in being Master of them But a Prince is no more to be his own Caterer in his Love than in his Food there∣fore  Aurengezebe  has ever in waiting Two Pur∣veyors for his Dishes and his Wenches for his retired Hours by whom the Scene of his Diver∣sion is prepared in the following Manner  There is near  CoventGarden  a Street known by the Name of  Drury  which before the Days of Christianity was purchased by the Queen of  Paphos  and is the only Part of  Great Britain  where the Tenure of Vassalage is still in Being All that long Course of Building is under par∣ticular Districts or Ladiships after the Manner of Lordships in other Parts over which Matrons of known Abilities preside and have for the Support of their Age and Infirmities certain Taxes paid out of the Rewards of the amorous Labours of the Young This Seraglio of  Great Britain  is disposed into convenient Allies and Apartments and every House from the Cellar to the Garret inhabited by Nymphs of diffe∣rent Orders that Persons of every Rank may be accommodated with an immediate Consort to allay their Flames and partake of their Cares Here it is that when  Aurengezebe  thinks fit to give a Loose to Dalliance the Purveyors prepare the Entertainment and what makes it more  august is that every Person concerned in the Interlude has his set Part and the Prince sends beforehand Word what he designs to say and directs also the very Answer which shall be made to him  It has been before hinted that this Emperor has a continual Commerce with  India  and it is to be noted that the largest Stone that rich Earth has produced is in our  Aurengezebe  's Pos∣session  But all Things are now disposed for his Re∣ception At his Entrance into the  Seraglio  a Servant delivers him his Bever of State and Love on which is fixed this inestimable Jewel as his Diadem When he is seated the Pur∣veyors  Pandarus  and  Nuncio  marching on each Side of the Matron of the House intro∣duce her into his Presence In the midst of the Room they bow all together to the Dia∣dem  When the Matron  Whoever thou art as thy awful Aspect speaks thee a Man of Power be propitious to this Mansus of Love and let not the Severity of thy Wisdom disdain that by the Representation of naked In∣nocence or pastoral Figures we revive in thee the Memory at least of that Power of  Venus  to which all the Wise and the Brave are some Part of their Lives devoted Aurengezebe  consents by a Nod and they go out backward  After this an unhappy Nymph who is to be supposed just escaped from the Hands of a Ra∣visher with her Tresses dishevel'd runs into the Room with a Dagger in her Hand and falls before the Emperor  Pity Oh pity whoever thou art an unhap∣py Virgin whom one of the Train has robbed of her Innocence her Innocence which was all her  PortionOr rather let me die like the memora∣ble  LucretiaUpon which she stabs her self The Body is immediately examined after the Manner of our Coroners  Lucretia  recovers by a Cup of right  Nants  and the Matron who is her next Relation stops all Process at Law  This unhappy Affair is no sooner over but a naked Madwoman breaks into the Room calls for her Duke her Lord her Emperor As soon as she spies  Aurengezebe  the Object of all her Fury and Love she calls for Petticoats is ready to sink with Shame and is dressed in all haste in new Attire at his Charge This un∣expected Accident of the Madwoman makes  Aurengezebe  curious to know whether others who are in their Senses can guess at his Quali∣ty For which Reason the whole Convent is examined one by one The Matron marches in with a tawdry Country GirlPray  Winifred  says she Who do you think that fine Man with those Jewels and Pearls isI believe says  Winifred  it is our LandlordIt must be the Squire himselfThe Emperor laughs at her SimplicityGo Fool says the Matron Then turning to the EmperorYour Greatness will pardon her Ignorance After her several others of different Characters are instructed to mistake who he is in the same Manner Then the whole Sisterhood are called together and the Em∣peror rises and cocking his Hat declares He is the  Great Mogul  and they his Concubines A general Murmur goes through the Assembly and  Aurengezebe  certifying that he keeps them for State rather than Use tells them they are permitted to receive all Men into their Apart∣ments then proceeds through the Crowd among whom he throws Medals shaped like HalfCrowns and returns to his Chariot  This being all that passed the last Day a which  Aurengezebe  visited the Women's Apart∣ments I consulted  Pacolet  concerning the Foun∣dation of such strange Amusements in old Age To which he answer'd You may remember when I gave you an Account of my good Fortune in being drowned on the th Day of my Humane Life I told you of the Disasters I should otherwise have met with before I arri∣ved at the End of my  Stamen  which was Sixty Years I may now add an Observation to you That all who exceed that Period except the latter Part of it is spent in the Exercise of Vir∣tue and Contemplation of Futurity must neces∣sarily fall into an Indecent old Age because with Regard to all the Enjoyments of the Years of Vigour and Manhood Childhood returns upon them And as Infants ride on Sticks build Houses in Dirt and make Ships in Gut∣ters by a faint Idea of Things they are to act hereafter so old Men play the Lovers Po∣tentates and Emperors from the decaying Image of the more perfect Performances of their stronger Years Therefore be sure to in∣sert  Aesculapius  and  Aurengezebe  in your next Bill of Mortality of the Metaphorically De∣funct  Will's Coffeehouse  July  As soon as I came hither this Evening no less than Ten People produced the following Poem which they all reported was sent to each of them by the PennyPost from an unknown Hand All the BattleWriters in the Room were in Debate who could be the Author of a Piece so martially written and every Body ap∣plauded the Address and Skill of the Author in calling it a  Postscript  It being the Nature of  a Postscript to contain something very Material which was forgotten or not clearly expressed in the Letter it self Thus the Verses being occa∣sioned by a March without Beat of Drum and that Circumstance being no ways taken Notice of in any of the Stanza's the Author calls it a Postscript not that it is a Postscript but figura∣tively because it wants a Postscript Common Writers when what they mean is not expressed in the Book it self supply it by a Preface but a Postscript seems to me the more just Way of A∣pology because otherwise a Man makes an Ex∣cuse before the Offence is committed All the Heroick Poets were guessed at for its Author but though we could not find out his Name yet one repeated a Couplet in  Hudibras  which spoke his Qualifications  I'th' midst of all this Warlike Rabble  Crowdero  march'd expert and able  The Poem is admirably suited to the Occasion For to write without discovering your Meaning bears a just Resemblance to Marching without Beat of Drum  On the March to  Tournay  without Beat of Drum  The  Brussels  POSTSCRIPT  Could I with plainest Words express  That great Man's wonderful Address  His Penetration and his towring Thought  It would the gazing World surprize  To see one Man at all Times wise  To view the Wonders he with Ease has wrought  Refining Schemes approach his Mind  Like Breezes of a Southern Wind  To temperate a sultry glorious Day  Whose Fannings with an useful Pride  Its mighty Heat doth softly guide  And having cleared the Air glide silently away  Thus his Immensity of Thought  Is deeply form'd and gently wrought  His Temper always softening Life's Disease  That Fortune when she does intend  To rudely frown she turns his Friend  Admires his Judgment and applauds his Ease  His great Address in this Design  Does now and will for ever shine  And wants a  Waller  but to do him Right  The whole Amusement was so strong  Like Fate he doom'd them to be wrong  And  Tournay  's took by a peculiar Slight  Thus Madam all Mankind behold  Your vast Ascendant not by Gold  But by your Wisdom and your pious Life  Your Aim no more than to destroy  That which does  Europe  's Ease annoy  And supersede a Reign of Shame and Strise  St James's Coffeehouse  July  My Brethren of the Quill the ingenious So∣ciety of Newswriters having with great Spi∣rit and Elegance already informed the World that the Town of  Tournay  capitulated on the th Instant there is nothing left for me to say but to congratulate the good Company here that we have Reason to hope for an Opportu∣nity of thanking Mr  Withers  next Winter in this Place for the Service he has done his Coun∣try No Man deserves better of his Friends  than that Gentleman whose distinguishing Cha∣racter it is that he gives his Orders with the Familiarity and enjoys his Fortune with the Generosity of a FellowSoldier His Grace the Duke of  Argyle  had also an eminent Part in the Reduction of this important Place That illu∣strious Youth discovers the peculiar Turn of Spi∣rit and Greatness of Soul which only make Men of high Birth and Quality useful to their Coun∣try and considers Nobility as an imaginary Di∣stinction unless accompanied with the Practice of those generous Virtues by which it ought to be obtained But that our Military Glory is ar∣rived at its present Height and that Men of all Ranks so passionately affect their Share in it is certainly owing to the Merit and Conduct of our glorious General For as the great Secret in Chy∣mistry though not in Nature has occasioned many useful Discoveries and the fantastick No∣tion of being wholly disinterested in Friendship has made Men do a Thousand generous Actions above themselves so though the present Gran∣deur and Fame of the Duke of  Marlborough  is a Station of Glory to which no one hopes to arrive yet all carry their Actions to an higher Pitch by having that great Example laid before them  The TATLER N  o    Quicquid agunt Homines nostri Farrago Libelli  From  Tuesd July  to  Thursd July    White's Chocolatehouse  July  MY Friend Sir  Thomas  has communicated to me his Letters from  Epsom  of the th Instant which give in general a very good Account of the present Posture of Affairs in that Place but that the Tranquility and Cor∣respondence of the Company begins to be in∣terrupted by the Arrival of Sir  Taffety Trippet  a Fortunehunter whose Follies are too gross to give Diversion and whose Vanity is too stu∣pid to let him be sensible that he is a publick Offence If People will indulge a splenatick Humour it is impossible to be at Ease when such Creatures as are the Scandal of our Spe∣cies set up for Gallantry and Adventures It will be much more easy therefore to laugh Sir  Taffety  into Reason than convert him from his Foppery by any serious Contempt I knew a Gentleman that made it a Maxim to open his Doors and ever run into the Way of Bullies to avoid their Insolence The Rule will hold as well with Coxcombs They are never morti∣fied but when they see you receive and de∣spise them otherwise they rest assured that it is your Ignorance makes them out of your good Graces or that 'tis only want of Admit∣tance prevents their being amiable where they are shun'd and avoided But Sir  Taffety  is a Fop of so sanguine a Complexion that I fear it will  be very hard for the fair One he at present pur∣sues to get rid of the Chace without being so tired as for her own Ease to fall into the Mouth of the Mungrel she runs from But the History of Sir  Taffety  is as pleasant as his Character  It happened that when he first set up for a Fortunehunter he chose  Tunbridge  for the Scene of Action where were at that Time Two Sisters upon the same Design The Knight believed of Course the Elder must be the better Prize and consequently makes all his Sail that Way Peo∣ple that want Sense do always in an egregious Manner want Modesty which made our Hero triumph in making his Amour as publick as was possible The adored Lady was no less vain of his publick Addresses An Attorney with one Cause is not half so restless as a Wo∣man with one Lover Whereever they met they talked to each other aloud chose each o∣ther Partner at Balls saluted at the most con∣spicuous Parts of the Service at Church and practised in Honour of each other all the re∣markable Particularities which are usual for Persons who admire one another and are con∣temptible to the rest of the World These Two Lovers seem'd as much made for each other as  Adam  and  Eve  and all pronounced it a Match of Nature's own making but the Night be∣fore the Nuptials so universally approved the younger Sister envious of the good Fortune even of her Sister who had been present at most of their Interviews and had an equal Tast for the Charms of a Fop as there are a Set of Women made for that Order of Men the younger I say unable to see so rich a Prize pass by her discovered to Sir  Taffety  that a Coquet Air much Tongue and Three Suits was all the Portion of his Mistress His Love vanished that Moment himself and Equipage  the next Morning It is uncertain where the Lo∣ver has been ever since engag'd but certain it is he has not appeared in his Character as a Fol∣lower of Love and Fortune till he arrived at  Ep∣som  where there is at present a young Lady of Youth Beauty and Fortune who has alarmed all the Vain and the Impertinent to infest that Quarter At the Head of this Assembly Sir  Taf∣fety  shines in the brightest Manner with all the Accomplishments which usually ensuare the Heart of Woman with this particular Merit which often is of great Service that he is laughed at for her Sake The Friends of the fair One are in much Pain for the Sufferings she goes through from the Perseverance of this Hero but they may be much more so from the Danger of his succeeding toward which they give him an helping Hand if they disswade her with Bitter∣ness for there is a fantastical Generosity in the Sex to approve Creatures of the least Merit ima∣ginable when they see the Imperfections of their Admirers are become Marks of Derision for their Sakes and there is nothing so frequent as that he who was contemptible to a Woman in her own Judgment has won her by being too violently opposed by others  Grecian Coffeehouse  July  In the several Capacities I bear of Astrolo∣ger Civilian and Physician I have with great Application studied the publick Emolument To this End serve all my Lucubrations Specu∣lations and whatever other Labours I under∣take whether nocturnal or diurnal On this Motive am I induced to publish a neverfailing Medicine for the Spleen My Experience in this Distemper came from a very remarkable Cure on my ever worthy Friend  Tom Spindle  who through excessive Gaiety had exhausted  that natural Stock of Wit and Spirits he had long been blessed with He was sunk and flattened to the lower Degree imaginable sit∣ting whole Hours over the  Book of Martyrs  and  Pilgrims Progress  his other Contempla∣tions never rising higher than the Colour of his Urine or Regularity of his Pulse In this Condition I found him accompanied by the learned Dr  Drachm  and a good old Nurse  Drachm  had prescribed Magazines of Herbs and Mines of Steel I soon discovered the Mala∣dy and descanted on the Nature of it till I con∣vinced both the Patient and his Nurse that the Spleen is not to be cured by Medicine but by Poetry  Apollo  the Author of Physick shone with diffusive Rays the best of Poets as well as of Physicians and it is in this double Capaci∣ty that I have made my Way and have found sweet easy flowring Numbers are oft superior to our noblest Medicines When the Spirits are low and Nature sunk the Muse with spright∣ly and harmonious Notes gives an unexpected Turn with a Grain of Poetry which I prepare without the Use of Mercury I have done Wonders in this Kind for the Spleen is like the  Tarantula  the Effects of whose malignant Poison are to be prevented by no other Remedy but the Charms of Musick For you are to un∣derstand that as some noxious Animals carry Antidotes for their own Poisons so there is something equally unaccountable in Poetry For though it is sometimes a Disease it is to be cured only by it self Now I knowing  Tom Spindle  's Constitution and that he is not only a pretty Gentleman but also a pretty Poet found the true Cause of his Distemper was a violent Grief that moved his Affections too strongly For during the late Treaty of Peace he had writ a most excellent Poem on that Subject  and when he wanted but Two Lines in the last Stanza for finishing the whole Piece there comes News that the  French  Tyrant would not sign  Spindle  in a few Days took his Bed and had lain there still had not I been sent for I immediately told him there was great Probabi∣lity the  French  would now sue to us for Peace I saw immediately a new Life in his Eyes and knew That nothing could help him forward so well as hearing Verses which he would believe worse than his own I read him therefore the  Brussels Postscript  After which I recited some Heroick Lines of my own which operated so strongly on the Tympanum of his Ear that I doubt not but I have kept out all other Sounds for a Fortnight and have Reason to hope we shall see him abroad the Day before his Poem  This you see is a particular Secret I have found out  viz  That you are not to chuse your Physician for his Knowledge in your Di∣stemper but for having it himself There∣fore I am at Hand for all Maladies arising from Poetical Vapours beyond which I never pre∣tend For being called the other Day to one in Love I took indeed their Three Guinea's and gave them my Advice which was to send for  Aesculapius Aesculapius  as soon as he saw the Patient cries out 'Tis Love 'Tis Love Oh the unequal Pulse These are the Symp∣toms a Lover feels such Sighs such Pangs at∣tend the uneasy Mind nor can our Art or all our boasted Skill availYet O Fair for theeThus the Sage ran on and owned the Passion which he pitied as well as that he felt a greater Pain than ever he cured After which he concluded All I can advise is Marriage Charms and Beauty will give new Life and Vigour and turn the Course of Nature to its better Prospect This is the new Way and  thus  Aesculapius  has left his beloved Powders and writes a  Recipe  for a Wife at Sixty In short my Friend followed the Prescription and married Youth and Beauty in its perfect Bloom  Supine in  Silvia  's snowy Arms he lies  And all the busy Care of Life defies  Each happy Hour is fill'd with fresh Delight  While Peace the Day and Pleasure crowns the Night  From my own Apartment  July  Tragical Passion was the Subject of the Dis∣course where I last visited this Evening and a Gentleman who knows that I am at present writing a very deep Tragedy directed his Dis∣course in a particular Manner to me It is the common Fault said he of you Gentlemen who write in the Buskin Style that you give us ra∣ther the Sentiments of such who behold Tragi∣cal Events than of such who bear a Part in 'em themselves I would advise all who pre∣tend this Way to read  Shakespear  with Care and they will soon be deterred from putting forth what is usually called Tragedy The Way of common Writers in this Kind is rather the  Description  than the  Expression  of Sorrow There is no Medium in these Attempts and you must go to the very Bottom of the Heart or it is all mere Language and the Writer of such Lines is no more a Poet than a Man is a Phy∣sician for knowing the Names of Distempers without the Causes of them Men of Sense are professed Enemies to all such empty Labours For he who p  etends to be sorrowful and is not is a Wretch yet more contemptible than he who pretends to be me  ry and is not Such a Tragedian is only maudlin drunk The  Gentleman went on with much Warmth but all he could say had little Effect upon me But when I came hither I so far observed his Coun∣sel that I looked into  Shakespear  The Tragedy I dipped into was  Harry the Fourth  In the Scene where  Morton  is preparing to tell  Northumber∣land  of his Son's Death the old Man does not give him Time to speak but says  The Whiteness of thy Cheeks  Is apter than thy Tongue to tell thy Errand  Even such a Man so faint so spiritless  So dull so dead in Look so WoeBe gone  Drew  Priam  's Curtain at the Dead of Night  And would have told him Half his  Troy  was burnt  But  Priam  found the Fire e're he his Tongue  And I my  Percy  's Death e're thou report'st it  The Image in this Place is wonderfully noble and great yet this Man in all this is but ri∣sing towards his great Affliction and is still e∣nough himself as you see to make a Simile But when he is certain of his Son's Death he is lost to all Patience and gives up all the Re∣gards of this Life and since the last of Evils is fallen upon him he calls for it upon all the World  Now let not Nature's Hand  Keep the wild  lood confined let Order die  And let the World no longer be a Stage  To feed  on  tion in a ling'ring Act  But let one Spirit of the firstborn  Cain  Reign in all Bosoms that each Heart being set  On bloody Courses the wide Scene may end  And Darkness be the Burier of the Dead  Reading but this one Scene has convinced me that he who describes the Concern of great Men must have a Soul as noble and as susceptible of high Thoughts as they whom he represents I shall therefore lay by my  Drama  for some Time and turn my Thoughts to Cares and Griefs some∣what below that of Heroes but no less moving A Misfortune proper for me to take Notice of has too lately happened The disconsolate  Ma∣ria  has three Days kept her Chamber for the Loss of the beauteous  Fidelia  her Lap dog  Lesbia  her self did not shed more Tears for her Sparrow What makes her the more concern'd is that we know not whether  Fidelia  was kill'd or stolen but she was seen in the ParlourWindow when the Trainbands went by and never since Who∣ever gives Notice of her dead or alive shall be rewarded with a Kiss of her Lady  The TATLER N  o    Virtutem Verba putant ut  Lucum Ligna  Hor  From  Thursd July  to  Saturd July    From my own Apartment  July  THIS Day I obliged  Pacolet  to entertain me w  th Matters which regarded Persons of his own Character and Occupation We chose to take our Walk on  Tower Hill  and as we were coming from thence in o der to stroll as far as  Garraway  's I obse ved two Men who had but just landed coming from the Water∣side I thought there was something uncom∣mon  in their Mien and Aspect but though they seemed by their Visage to be related yet was there a Warmth in their Manner as if they differed very much in their Sentiments of the Subject on which they were talking One of them seem'd to have a natural Confidence mixed with an ingenuous Freedom in his Ge∣sture his Dress very plain but very graceful and becoming The other in the midst of an overbearing Carriage betrayed by frequently looking round him a Suspicion that he was not enough regarded by those he met or that he feared they would make some Attack upon him This Person was much taller than his Companion and added to that Height the Ad∣vantage of a Feather in his Hat and Heels to his Shoes so monstrously high that he had Three or Four Times fallen down had he not been supported by his Friend They made a full Stop as they came within a few Yards of the Place where we stood The plain Gentle∣man bowed to  Pacolet  the other looked on him with some Displeasure Upon which I asked him Who they both were When he thus informed me of their Persons and Circum∣stances  You may remember  Isaac  that I have of∣ten told you there are Beings of a superior Rank to Mankind who frequently visit the Ha∣bitations of Men in order to call them from some wrong Pursuits in which they are actually engaged or divert them from Methods which will lead them into Errors for the future He that will carefully reflect upon the Occurrences of his Life will find he has been sometimes extricated out of Difficulties and received Fa∣vours where he could never have expected such Benefits as well as met with cross Events from some unseen Hand which have disap∣pointed  his best laid Designs Such Accidents arrive from the Interventions of Aerial Beings as they are benevolent or hurtful to the Nature of Man and attend his Steps in the Tracts of Ambition of Business and of Pleasure Be∣fore I ever appeared to you in the Manner I do now I have frequently followed you in your Evening Walks and have often by throwing some Accident in your Way as the passing by of a Funeral or the Appearance of some other solemn Object given your Imagination a new Turn and changed a Night you had destined to Mirth and Jollity into an Exercise of Study and Contemplation I was the old Soldier who met you last Summer in  Chelsea  Fields and pre∣tended that I had broken my WoodenLeg and could not get Home but I snap'd it short off on purpose that you might fall into the Reflections you did on that Subject and take me into your Hack If you remember you made your self very merry on that Fracture and asked me Whether I thought I should next Winter feel Cold in the Toes of that Leg As is usually observed that those who lose Limbs are sen∣sible of Pains in the extreme Parts even after those Limbs are cut off However my keep∣ing you then in the Story of the Battle of the  Boin  prevented an Assignation which would have led you into more Disasters than I then re∣lated  To be short Those Two Persons you see yonder are such as I am they are not real Men but are mere Shades and Figures One is named  Alethes  the other  Verisimilis  Their Office is to be the Guardians and Representa∣tives of  Conscience  and  Honour  They are now going to visit the several Parts of the Town to see how their Interests in the World decay or flourish and to purge themselves from the  many false Imputations they daily meet with in the Commerce and Conversation of Men You observed  Verisimilis  frowned when he first saw me What he is provoked at is that I told him one Day though he strutted and dressed with so much Ostentation if he kept himself within his own Bounds he was but a Lacquey and wore only that Gentleman's Li∣very whom he is now with This frets him to the Heart for you must know he has pre∣tended a long Time to set up for himself and gets among a Crowd of the more unthinking Part of Mankind who take him for a Person of the First Quality though his Introduction into the World was wholly owing to his present Companion  This Encounter was very agreeable to me and I was resolved to dog them and desired  Pacolet  to accompany me I soon perceived what he told me in the Gesture of the Persons For when they look'd at each other in Dis∣course the welldress'd Man suddenly cast down his Eyes and discovered that the other had a painful Superiority over him After some further Discourse they took Leave The plain Gentleman went down towards  Thamesstreet  in order to be present at least at the Oaths taken at the  Custom House  and the other made directly for the Heart of the City It is incredible how great a Change there imme∣diately appeared in the Man of Honour when he got rid of his uneasie Companion He ad∣justed the Cock of his Hat anew settled his SwordKnot and had an Appearance that at∣tracted a sudden Inclination for him and his Interests in all who beheld him For my Part said I to  Pacolet  I cannot but think you are mistaken in calling this Person of the Lower Quality for he looks much more like a Gen∣tleman  than the other Don't you observe all Eyes are upon him as he advances How each Sex gazes at his Stature Aspect Address and Motion  Pacolet  only smiled and shaked his Head as leaving me to be convinced by my own further Observation We kept on our Way after him till we came to  ExchangeAlley  where the plain Gentleman again came up to the other and they stood together after the Manner of eminent Merchants as if ready to receive Application but I could observe no Man talk to either of them The One was laughed at as a Fop and I heard many Whis∣pers against the other as a whimsical Sort of Fellow and a great Enemy to Trade They crossed  Cornhill  together and came into the full  Change  where some bowed and gave themselves Airs in being known to so fine a Man as  Verisimilis  who they said had great Interest in all Princes Courts and the other was taken Notice of by several as one they had seen somewhere long before One more particularly said He had formerly been a Man of Consideration in the World but was so un∣lucky that they who dealt with him by some strange Infatuation or other had a Way of cut∣ting off their own Bills and were prodigi∣ously slow in improving their Stock But as much as I was curious to observe the Reception these Gentlemen met with upon  Change  I could not help being interrupted by one that came up towards us to whom every Body made their Compliments He was of the com∣mon Height and in his Dress there seemed to be great Care to appear no Way particular ex∣cept in a certain exact and feat Manner of Be∣haviour and Circumspection He was won∣derfully careful that his Shoes and Cloathes should be without the least Speck upon them  and seem'd to think that on such an Ac∣cident depended his very Life and Fortune There was hardly a Man on  Change  who had not a Note upon him and each seem'd very well satisfied that their Money lay in his Hands without demanding Payment I asked  Pacolet  What great Merchant that was who was so universally addressed to yet made too familiar an Appearance to command that extraordinary Deference  Pacolet  answer'd This Person is the Daemon or Genius of Credit his Name is  Umbra  If you observe he follows  Alethes  and  Verisimilis  at a Distance and indeed has no Foundation for the Figure he makes in the World but that he is thought to keep their Cash though at the same Time none who trust him would trust the other for a Groat As the Company rolled about the Three Spe∣cters were jumbled into one Place When they were so and all thought there was an Alliance between them they immediately drew upon them the Business of the whole  Change  But their Affairs soon encreased to such an unweildy Bulk that  Alethes  took his Leave and said He would not engage further than he had an immediate Fund to answer  Verisimilis  pretend∣ed that though he had Revenues large enough to go on his own Bottom yet it was below one of his Family to condescend to trade in his own Name therefore he also retired I was extremely troubled to see the glorious Mart of  London  left with no other Guardian but him of Credit But  Pacolet  told me That Traders had nothing to do with the  Honour  or  Conscience  of their Correspondents provided they suppor∣ted a general Behaviour in the World which could not hurt their Credit or their Purses For said he you may in this one Tract of Building of  London  and  Westminster  see the imaginary  Motives on which the greatest Affairs move as well as in rambling over the Face of the Earth For tho'  Alethes  is the real Governour as well as Legislator of Mankind he has very little Bu∣siness but to make up Quarrels and is only a ge∣neral Referree to whom every Man pretends to appeal but is satisfied with his Determina∣tions no further than they promote his own In∣terest Hence it is that the Soldier and the Courtier model their Actions according to  Veri∣similis  's Manner and the Merchant according to that of  Umbra  Among these Men Honour and Credit are not valuable Possessions in them∣selves or pursued out of a Principle of Justice but merely as they are serviceable to Ambition and to Commerce But the World will never be in any Manner of Order or Tranquility till Men are firmly convinced that Conscience Ho∣nour and Credit are all in one Interest and that without the Concurrence of the former the latter are but Impositions upon our selves and others The Force these delusive Words have is not seen in the Transactions of the busie World only but also have their Tyranny over the Fair Sex Were you to ask the un∣happy  Lais  What Pangs of Reflection prefer∣ring the Consideration of her Honour to her Conscience has given her She could tell you That it has forced her to drink up half a Gal∣lon this Winter of  Tom Dassapas  's Potions That she still pines away for fear of being a Mother and knows not but the Moment she is such she shall be a Murderess But if Con∣science had as strong a Force upon her Mind as Honour the first Step to her unhappy Con∣dition had never been made she had still been innocent as she's beautiful Were Men so enlighten'd and studious of their own Good as to act by the Dictates of their Reason and  Reflection and not the Opinion of others Con∣science would be the steady Ruler of humane Life and the Words  Truth Law Reason Equi∣ty  and  Religion  would be but Synonymous Terms for that only Guide which makes us pass our Days in our own Favour and Approba∣tion  The TATLER N  o    Quicquid agunt Homines nostri Farrago Libelli  From  Saturd July  to  Tuesd Aug    White's Chocolatehouse  August  THE Impo ition of honest Names and Words upon improper Subjects has made so regu∣lar a Confusion amongst us that we are apt to sit down with our Errors well enough satisfied with the Methods we are fallen into without at∣tempting to deliver ou selves from the Tyranny under which we are reduc'd by such Innovations Of all the laudable Motives of humane Life none has suffered so much in this Kind as Love under which rever'd Name a brutal Desire call'd Lust is frequently concealed and admitted tho' they differ as much as a Matron from a Prosti∣ture or a Companion from a Buffoon  Philan∣der  the other Day was bewailing this Misfortune w  much Indignation and upbraided me for hav  g some Time since quoted those excellent Lines of the Satyrist  To an exact Perfection they have brought  The Action Love the Passion is forgot  How could you said he leave such a Hint so coldly How could  Aspasia  and  Semphronia  en∣ter into your Imagination at the same Time and you never declare to us the different Reception you gave 'em  The Figures which the ancient Mythologists and Poets put upon Love and Lust in their Wri∣tings are very instructive Love is a beauteous Blind Child adorn'd with a Quiver and a Bow which he plays with and shoots around him without Design or Direction to intimate to us that the Person beloved has no Intention to give us the Anxieties we meet with but that the Beauties of a worthy Object are like the Charms of a lovely Infant They cannot but attract your Concern and Fondness tho' the Child so regard∣ed is as insensible of the Value you put upon it as it is that it deserves your Benevolence On the other Side the Sages figured Lust in the Form of a Satyr of Shape part Humane part Bestial to signify that the Followers of it pro∣stitute the Reason of a Man to pursue the Appe∣tites of a Beast This Satyr is made to haunt the Paths and Coverts of the WoodNymphs and Shepherdesses to lurk on the Banks of Rivulets and watch the purling Streams as the Resorts of retired Virgins to show that lawless Desire tends chiefly to prey upon Innocence and has something so unnatural in it that it hates its own Make and shuns the Object it lov'd as soon as it has made it like it self Love therefore is a Child that complains and bewails its Inability to help it self and weeps for Assistance without an immediate Reflection or Knowledge of the Food it wants Lust a watchful Thief which seizes its Prey and lays Snares for its own Relief and its principal Object being Innocence it never robs but it murders at the same Time  From this Idea of a  Cupid  and a  Satyr  we may settle our Notion of these different Desires and accordingly rank their Followers  Aspasia  must therefore be allow'd to be the first of the beau∣teous Order of Love whose unaffected Freedom and conscious Innocence give her the Attendance of the Graces in all her Actions That awful Di∣stance which we bear towards her in all our Thoughts of her and that chearful Familiarity with which we approach her are certain Instan∣ces of her being the truest Object of Love of any of her Sex In this accomplish'd Lady Love is the constant Effect because it is never the De∣sign Yet tho' her Mien carries much more Invi∣tation than Command to behold her is an im∣mediate Check to loose Behaviour and to love her is a liberal Education For it being the Na∣ture of all Love to create an Imitation of the be∣loved Person in the Lover a Regard for  Aspasia  naturally produces Decency of Manners and good Conduct of Life in her Admirers If there∣fore the giggling  Leucippe  could but see her Train of Fops assembled and  Aspasia  move by 'em she would be mortified at the Veneration with which she is beheld ev'n by  Leucippe  's own un∣thinking Equipage whose Passions have long ta∣ken Leave of their Understandings  As Charity is esteemed a Conjunction of the good Qualities necessary to a virtuous Man so Love is the happy Composition of all the Accom∣plishments that make a Fine Gentleman The Motive of a Man's Life is seen in all his Actions and such as have the Beauteous Boy for their Inspirer have a Simplicity of Behaviour and a certain Evenness of Desire which burns like the Lamp of Life in their Bosoms while they who are instigated by the Satyr are ever tortu∣red by Jealousies of the Object of their Wishes often desire what they scorn and as often  consciously and knowingly embrace where they are mutually indifferent  Florio  the generous Husband and  Limberham  the kind Keeper are noted Examples of the dif∣ferent Effects which these Desires produce in the Mind  Amanda  who is the Wife of  Florio  lives in the continual Enjoyment of new Instances of her Husband's Friendship and sees it the End of all his Ambition to make her Life one Series of Pleasure and Satisfaction and  Amanda  's Relish of the Goods of Life is all that makes 'em plea∣sing to  Florio  They behave themselves to each other when present with a certain apparent Bene∣volence which transports above Rapture and they think of each other in Absence with a Con∣fidence unknown to the highest Friendship Their Satisfactions are doubled their Sorrows lessen'd by Participation  On the other Hand  Corinna  who is the Mistress of  Limberham  lives in constant Tor∣ment Her Equipage is an old Woman who was what  Corinna  is now an antiquated Foot∣man who was Pimp to  Limberham  's Father and a ChamberMaid who is  Limberham  's Wench by Fits out of a Principle of Politicks to make her jealous and watchful of  Corinna  Under this Guard and in this Conversation  Corinna  lives in

and is as capa∣ble of being dispos'd of elsewhere as any other Moveable But while her Keeper is perswaded by his Spies that no Enemy has been within his Doors since his last Visit no  Persian  Prince was ever so magnificently bountiful A kind Look or falling Tear is worth a Piece of Broc∣kade a Sigh is a Jewel and a Smile is a Cup∣board  board of Plate All this is shar'd between  Co∣rinna  and her

August  Letters from the  Hague  of the th Instant  N S  say That there daily arrive at our Camp Deserters in considerable Numbers and that several of the Enemy concealed themselves in the Town of  Tournay  when the Garrison mar∣ched into the Citadel after which they pre∣sented themselves to the Duke of  Marlborough  some of whom were Commissioned Officers The Earl of  Albemarle  is appointed Governour of the Town Soon after the Surrender there arose a Dispute about a considerable Work which was asserted by the Allies to be Part of the Town and by the  French  to belong  to the Citadel It is said Monsieur  de Survill  was so ingenuous as to declare he thought it t  be comprehended within the Limits of the Town  but Monsieur  de Mesgrigny  Governour of the Ci¦tadel was of a contrary Opinion It is reported  That this Affair occasioned great Difficulties  which ended in a Capitulation for the Citadel i  self the principal Article of which is That i  shall be surrendred on the th of  September  next  in case they are not in the mean Time relieved  This Circumstance gives Foundation to believe that the Enemy have acted in this Manner ra∣ther from some Hopes they conceive of a Treaty of Peace before that Time than any Expectation from their Army which has retired towards their former Works between  Lens  and  La Bassee  These Advices add That his Excellency the Cza∣rish Ambassador has communicated to the StatesGeneral and the Foreign Ministers residing at the  Hague  a Copy of a Letter from his Master's Camp which gives an Account of the entire De∣feat of the  Swedish  Army They further say That Count  Piper  is taken Prisoner and that it is doubted whether the King of  Sweden  himself was not kill'd in the Action We hear from  Savoy  That Count  Thaun  having amus'd the Enemy by a March as far as the  Tarantaise  had suddenly repassed Mount  Cennis  and moved towards  Bri∣anzon  This unexpected Disposition is apprehen∣ded by the Enemy as a Piece of

generous  Orlando  believ'd himself form'd for the World and not to be engross'd by any particular Affection He sigh'd not for  Delia  for  Chloris  for  Chloe  for  Betty  nor my Lady nor for the ready Chambermaid nor di∣stant Baroness  Woman  was his Mistress and the whole Sex his Seraglio His Form was al∣ways irresistible And if we consider that not One of Five hundred can bear the least Favour from a Lady without being exalted above him∣self  if also we must allow that a Smile from a SideBox has made  Jack Spruce  half mad we can't think it wonderful that  Orlando  's repeated Conquests touch'd his Brain So it certainly did and  Orlando  became an Enthusiast in Love and in all his Address contracted something out of the ordinary Course of Breeding and Ci∣vility However powerful as he was he would still add to the Advantages of his Person that of a Profession which the Ladies always fa∣vour and immediately commenced Soldier Thus equipp'd for Love and Honour our Hero seeks distant Climes and Adventures and leaves the despairing Nymphs of  Great Britain  to the Courtship of Beaus and Witlings till his Re∣turn His Exploits in Foreign Nations and Courts have not been regularly enough com∣municated unto us to report 'em with that Ve∣racity which we profess in our Narrations But after many Feats of Arms which those who were Witnesses to them have suppress'd out of Envy but which we have had faithfully related from his own Mouth in our publick Streets  Orlando  returns home full but not loaded with Years Beaus born in his Absence made it their Business to decry his Furniture his Dress his Manner but all such Rivalry he suppressed as the Philosopher did the Sceptick who ar∣gued there was no such Thing as Motion by only moving The Beauteous  Villar J  who only was formed for his Paramour became the O  of his Affection His first Speech to he was as follows  Madam  It is not only that Nature has made us Two the most accomplished of each Sex and minted to us to obey her Dictates in becoming One but  there is also an Ambition in following the mighty Persons you have favoured Where King  and Heroes as great as  Alexander  or such as could personate  Alexander  have bowed permit your Ge∣neral to lay his Lawrels  According to  Milton  The Fair with conscious Majesty approv'd  His pleaded Reason  Fortune having now supplied  Orlando  with Ne∣cessaries for his high Taste of Gallantry and Plea∣sure his Equipage and Oeconomy had some∣thing in them more sumptuous and gallant than could be receiv'd in our degenerate Age there∣fore his Figure tho' highly graceful appeared so exotick that it assembled all the  Britons  un∣der the Age of Sixteen who saw his Grandeur to follow his Chariot with Shouts and Acclama∣tions which he regarded with the Contempt which great Minds affect in the midst of Applau∣ses I remember I had the Honour to see him one Day stop and call the Youths about him to whom he spake as follows  'Good BastardsGo to School and don't lose your Time in following my Wheels I am loth to hurt you because I know not but you are all my own Offspring Hark'ee you Sirrah with the white Hair I am sure you are mine There's Half a Crown Tell your Mother This with the Half Crown I gave her when I got you comes to Five Shillings Thou hast cost me all that and yet thou art good for nothing Why you young Dogs did you never see a Man before'  Never such a one as you  Noble General  replied a Truant from  Westminster  'Sirrah I believe thee There is a Crown for thee Drive on Coach∣man'  This Vehicle tho' sacred to Love was not a∣dorn'd with Doves Such an Hieroglyphick de∣noted  too languishing a Passion  Orlando  there∣fore gave the Eagle as being of a Constitution which inclined him rather to seize his Prey with Talons than pine for it with Murmurs  From my own Apartment  August  I have received the following Letter from Mr  Powell  of the  Bath  who I think runs from the Point between us which I leave the whole World to judge  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SIR  HAving a great deal of more advantagious Business at present on my Hands I thought to have deferr'd answering your  Tatler  of the st Instant till the Company was gone and Season over but having resolved not to re∣gard any Impertinences of your Paper except what relate particularly to me I am the more easily induc'd to answer you as I shall find Time to do it First pa tly lest you should think your self neglected which I have Reason to believe you would take heinously ill Se∣condly partly because it will increase my Fame and consequently my Audience when all the Quality shall see with how much Wit and Rail∣lery I show youI don't care a Farthing for you Thirdly partly because being  without Books  if I don't show much Learning it will not be imputed to my having none  I have travelled  Italy France  and  Spain  and fully comprehend whatever any  German  Arrist in the World can do yet cannot I ima∣gine why you should endeavour to disturb the Repose and Plenty which tho' unworthy I enjoy at this Place It cannot be that you take Offence at my Prologues and Epilogues which you are pleas'd to miscall Foolish and  Abusive No no until you give a better I shall not forbear thinking that the true Rea∣son of your picking a Quarrel with me was because it is more agreeable to your Prin∣ciples as well as more to the Honour of your  ured Victory to attack a Governour Mr  Isaac  Mr  Isaac  I can see into a Millstone as far as another as the Saying is You  for sowing the Seeds of Sedition and  bedience among my Puppets and your  eal for the good old Cause would make you perswade  Punch  to pull the String from his Chops and not move his Jaw when I have a Mind he should harangue Now I appeal to all Men if this is not contrary to that uncontroulable unaccountable Dominion which by the Laws of Nature I exercise over them for all Sorts of Wood and Wire were made for the Use and Benefit of Man I have therefore an unquestionable Right to frame fashion and put them together as I please and having made them what they are my Puppets are my Property and there∣fore my Slaves Nor is there in Nature any Thing more just than the Homage which is paid by a less to a more excellent Being So that by the Right therefore of a superior Ge∣nius I am their supreme Moderator altho' you would insinuate agreeably to your level∣ling Principles that I am my self but a great Puppet and can therefore have but a coordi∣nate Jurisdiction with them I suppose I have now sufficiently made it appear that I have a paternal Right to keep a PuppetShow and this Right I will maintain in my Prologues on all Occasions  And therefore if you write a Defence of your self against this my SelfDefence I ad∣monish you to keep within Bounds for  every Day will not be so propitious to you as the th of  April  and perhaps my Resent∣ment may get the better of my Generosity and I may no longer scorn to fight one who is not my Equal with unequal Weapons There are such Things as  Scandulums Magnatums  there∣fore take Heed hereafter how you write such Things as I cannot easily answer for that will put me in a Passion  I order you to handle only these Two Pro∣positions to which our Dispute may be redu∣ced The First Whether I have not an Ab∣solute Power whenever I please to light a Pipe with one of  Punch  's Legs or warm my Fingers with his whole Carcass The Second Whether the Devil would not be in  Punch  should he by Word or Deed oppose my Sove∣reign Will and Pleasure And then perhaps I may if I can find Leisure for it give you the Trouble of a second Letter  But if you intend to tell me of the Original of PuppetShows and the several Changes and Revolutions that have happened in them since  Thespis  and I don't care who that's  Noli me tangere  I have solemnly engaged to say nothing of what I can't approve Or if you talk of certain Contracts with the Mayor and Burgesses or Fees to the Con∣stables for the Privilege of Acting I will not write one single Word about any such Matters but shall leave you to be mumbled by the learned and very ingenious Author of a late Book who knows very well what's to be said and done in such Cases He is now shuffling the Cards and dealing to  Timothy  but if he wins the Game I will send him to play at Backgammon with you and then he will satisfy you that DeuceAce makes Five  And so submitting my self to be try'd by my Country and allowing any Jury of good Men and true to be that Country not excepting any unless Mr  Isaac Bickerstaff  to be of the Pannel for you are neither good nor true I bid you heartily farewel and am  SIR  Your Loving Friend  Powell  Bath  July  The End of the First Volume  A Faithful INDEX OF THE Dull as well as ingenious Passages IN
