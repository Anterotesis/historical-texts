 No One's Enemy but His Own  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  No One's Enemy but His Own  A COMEDY In THREE ACTS  As it is PERFORMED at the THEATREROYAL in COVENTGARDEN  Plenus rimarum sum hac atque illac perfluo  TER  LONDON Printed for P VAILLANT facing Southamptonstreet in the Strand  MDCCLXIV  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr SMITH  BOLD was the man and senc'd in ev'ry part  With oak and tenfold brass about the heart  To build a play who tortur'd first his brain  And then dar'd launch it on this stormy main  What tho' at first he spreads his little sails  To Heav'n's indulgent and propitious gales  As the land gradual lessens to his eye  He finds a troubled sea and low'ring sky  Envy detraction calumny and spite  Raise a worse storm than when the winds unite  Around his bark in many a dang'rous shoal  Those monsters of the deep the critics prowl  "She's a weak vessel for these seas unfit  "And has on board her not a spice of wit  "She's Frenchbuilt too of foreign make" they cry  Like geese still cackling that the Gauls are nigh  If thrown on rocks by the hoarse dashing wave  Th' unhappy crew no hand is stretch'd to save  But round the wreck like Moors with furious joy  The witlings crowdto murder and destroy  These are known dangers and still full as certain  The bard meets other ills behind the curtain  Little you think ere yet you fix his fate  What previous mischiefs there in ambush wait  What plagues arise from all the mimic throng  "My part's too shortand Sir my part's too long"  This calls for incident that repartee  "Down the backstairs pen an escape for me  "Give me a ladder Mr Bayes of rope  "I love to wear the breeches and elope  "Something for me the groundlings ears to split  "Write a dark closet or a faintingfit  "Fix Woodward in some whimsical disgrace  "Or be facetious with Ned Shuter's face"  This is our way and yet our bard to night  Removes each obstacle and springs to light  Some scenes we hope he brings to nature true  Some gleams of humour and a moral too  But no strange monsters offers to your view  No forms grotesque and wild are here at strife  He boasts an etching from the real life  Exerts his efforts in a polish'd age  To drive the Smithfield muses from the stage  By easy dialogue would win your praise  And on fair decency graft all his bayes  Lately Published  By the Author of this Piece     s  d  The Orphan of China A Tragedy

never concerned in what he says or does  BLUNT  Why as to his heart according to the way of the world  CARELESS  He has none Sir no heart at all his affections are all contracted into a narrow attention to self and his understanding acts the subservient part to schemes of interest  BLUNT  Why that is the very quality I wish you possessed a little ofyou would not then be liable to ridiculous miscarriages in every thing you undertake  CARELESS  There going again to harp upon my indiscretions But prithee no more of thatI am wonderfully altered'Tis true I have had hitherto an unguarded

the matter I believe I shall bring it to thatThe lady seems to think her fortune places her above censure and  she coquets with so many men that hang me if I don't believe she means to keep her estate in her own hands and to have all the pleasures of matrimony without parting with her power  LA JEUNESSE  Monsieur that is a leetle alamode  CARELESS  Yes I fancy I shall have an affair with the lady

Hortensia may have as prompt inclinations as any of her sex she seems to act more from judgment than desire  CARELESS  Yes man I know all thatShe says so herself here in a charming charming note she sent me yesterday  He searches for it  Where the devil is itZoons I have not lost itHere Richard George run to my room and see if I have left a letter thereI was upon the terras last night'Sdeath if I

WISELY  WISELY  Gentlemen your servant Is your letter ready Blunt  CARELESS  My dear Wisely I am sorry we are to lose youSome disappointment in love I reckon  WISELY  There are other perplexities besides those of love SirBut no matter for my concerns I don't desire to be either pitied or envied  CARELESS  Now I like to provoke the envy of mankind And here is that  Shewing the letter  will make my acquaintance look on me with a jealous eye  BLUNT  Po prythee put up  CARELESS  Nay I can trust my friend Wiselyhe is an honest fellow and minds nobody's business but his ownhe shall know it before he goes to town  Reads  "Hortensia's compliments to Mr Careless"  WISELY  Hortensia to him  Aside  Well Sir  BLUNT  Careless how can you  CARELESS  Psha he is going to town he'll not obstruct me  WISELY  No truly not I SirUnless you put me in the way  Aside  CARELESS  Hortensia's compliments to Mr Careless she thinks it vain to attempt concealing an inclination which he has raised in her heart and which many circumstances must have already interpreted She was at first alarmed at Mr Careless's unguarded temper but expects from his good sense an absolute silence till every thing is concluded  You see Blunt she thinks differently of my character from what you doHa ha  BLUNT  Weak idle man  CARELESS  She will meet him at Sir Philip Figurein's mask this evening And in the mean time desires he will hidefrom the world this declaration of her heart which the merit of Mr Careless has extorted from her  There's a billet doux for you  BLUNT  Well you obey the lady's commands most admirably  CARELESS  Don't be so cynicalThis is among ourselves  BLUNT  Among ourselvesSuppose Wisely was in love with her  WISELY  I SirIthe lady is very little known to meI would not be suspected for the world  Aside  BLUNT  Po I hate to see you play the fool thusWisely let your man deliver this letter for meCareless your servant  Exit  CARELESS  Fare you well philosoperPoor Blunt he thinks I don't know how to distinguish between men but I can confide in youI know thou'rt an honest fellow  WISELY  Oh you may confide in me I assure you Sir I have such an interest now in this business that I am heartily oblig'd to you for the intelligence  CARELESS  Ay I knew you would be glad to hear itWell now a'n't I a very happy fellowHa haThis letter would be enough to break the heart of a rival to make him challenge me fight me kill meHa ha  WISELY  Why it is a serious business for a rival  Forcing a laugh  CARELESS  Only think of my carrying off Hortensia at last I think it would gall you now if you had been one of her many admirers  WISELY  To be rejected by her in whom beauty and good sense are still at strife for preeminence  to be discarded by her 'tis enough to drive the mind to madnessthat is I should think so if the lady had engag'd my heartConfusion I had like to have detected myself  Aside  But I am glad to hear what you have told me  CARELESS  Oh I knew you would be glad of itBut now I have open'd myself to you not a word for your life  WISELY  I shall make a proper use of itrely upon me  CARELESS  I am sure you willI read men nowA propos as you are going to town do me a slight favour Here is a snuffbox with her picture in it I let it fall last night upon the terras and have damag'd it a little Prythee leave it at Deard's as you go by and order it to be mended  WISELY  With all my heartI take it with great pleasure  CARELESS  Only cast your eye on her pictureHow lovely  WISELY  Charming indeedSuccessful coxcomb  Aside  CARELESS  Don't let a mortal see it  WISELY  By no means  CARELESS  You see the least hint will ruin me  Enter  a SERVANT  SERVANT  Sir Philip Figurein Sir has sent to know if your honour will meet him on the terras this morning  CARELESS  I'll wait on him    Exit  Servant  Will you come and take a turn with the knight  WISELY  I don't care if I do I shall hardly set out till evening  CARELESS  The knight will divert us What an absurd passion has possessed him in his old days He is seventy is not he  WISELY  Not much short and in high spirits still  CARELESS  Spirits with one foot in the grave he dances about the world as if he was bit by a tarantula  WISELY  Why dancing is his ruling passion  CARELESS  So much that he runs about to all the country assemblies and is a  beau garçon  with all human infirmities  WISELY  He is very harmless and goodnatur'd  CARELESS  Yes but not a single idea but what is derived from dancing If you ask him what sort of a place such a town is "They have a very good Mondaynight assembly" Or if you desire to know what kind of people "They very often dance thirty couple"  WISELY  You have him exactly  CARELESS  Can you guess his business with me  WISELY  No really  CARELESS  He is to have a masquerade at his own house tonight and wants to give me the invitation  WISELY  Civil  CARELESS  But his wife has been beforehand with himHa haI could let you into a secret about herHa haYou must not let a word transpireHa haI am pretty well with her  WISELY  The devil you areMy own relation and he is going to betray her  Aside  CARELESS  Yes I am much in her good graces And if hereafter you should see the likeness of your humble servant in one of my lady Figurein's children tip me a smile but keep your mind to yourself  WISELY  How in the name of wonder do you manage to ingratiate yourself thus  CARELESS  Step with me to my dressing room and you shall know further particularsHa haThis very night when the mask inflames every spirit to joy and revelry and while Sir Philip is sacrificing to the graces as he calls it her ladyship and I intend a sacrifice to the god of love  WISELY  Thou art an happy fellowBut I hope I shall be able to counteract your designs  Aside  CARELESS  But my dear Wisely not a syllable of all this  WISELY  You may rely upon me  CARELESS  Not the least hint about Hortensia  WISELY  Not for the world  CARELESS  Poor Blunt he calls me the Marplot of my own schemesHa haBut you see I know who to confide inI know who are my friends  Exeunt  SCENE  the Terras  Enter  LUCINDA  and  BELLFIELD  BELLFIELD  And so my dear Lucinda you think you know your own mind so well that you can answer for it I shall never have the rights of an husband over that pretty person of yours  LUCINDA  No never positively never  BELLFIELD  And on my part I positively pronounce that you will one day or other make me the happy man  LUCINDA  Pray Mr Bellfield have you a patent for my inclinations or do you intend to lay violent hands upon a weak defenceless woman and make me your own by force of arms  BELLFIELD  O fy no forcelike a goodnatur'd general I invite you to capitulate rather than urge me to the necessity of carrying the town by storm  LUCINDA  But I find the garrison still able to hold outThe citadel  laying her hand on her heart  is still proof against all the artillery you have play'd offI think you have not been able to throw in much fire Mr Bellfield  BELLFIELD  Ha ha you little know that I have a secret friend in that very citadel that will betray the place to me  LUCINDA  Indeed you flatter yourselfThere is not a single sentiment not one desire or inclination here that has ever whisper'd the smallest good word in your favour  BELLFIELD  Well well there is a little destiny in these mattersthat's all  LUCINDA  Destiny and so your system in loveaffairs is like that of certain heroes in military mattersYou think I suppose that every heart like every cannonball has its billet  BELLFIELD  Even so madam Nature like a skilful bowler delivers every heart out of hand with a secret bias to its proper object  LUCINDA  There is something agreeably impudent in the fellow's vanity  Aside  But you will allow that nature gives little secret antipathies too  BELLFIELD  Oh certainlyShe delights in blending contradictions in order to embellish the fair and give her the graces of variety A sort of mosaic work where folly is inlaid with talents a love of pleasure with virtue a power of pleasing with a delight in giving pain and as the poet says  "Fix'd principles with fancy ever new  "Shakes all together and produces you"  LUCINDA  Upon my word this is altogether a new way of making love By convincing me that you can with curious discernment spy out all the little foibles of the fair you think to recommend yourself to my notice Have a care Mr Bellfield remember Apollo's sentence upon the critic who found out all the faults in a celebrated poem He laid before him a sack of wheat and bid him separate the chaff which he gave him for his pains  BELLFIELD  That madam was because the man was so unfortunate as to have no relish for the beauties whereas my admiration  LUCINDA  Oh Sir you manage your admiration as certain prodigals do their money you grudge the smallest part to your neighbours and squander all most profusely on yourself And therefore it is you have been entered in my black list let me see how longlet me see  takes out a pocketbook  Ay this is it  reads  A list of those I am determined not to marry  Let me see  Mr Worthless condemn'd May the nineteenth  BELLFIELD  Worthless what he that married the great fortune  LUCINDA  And took on so prodigiously at her deathHe made love to me while he had weepers on  for his deceas'd wife and so I hated him for an impostor worse than Maria does Dr Wolfe in the NonjurorBut where are you you creature "Lord Hazard" This was a man of rank with a pale quality face and a genteel enervated figure I perceiv'd by his passion for play that the queen of trumps was in his eyes the greatest beauty in the world so I acquainted his lordship that I had no further occasion for his services and he told his friends that he resign'd  BELLFIELD  Ha haI see plainly I must be the man  Aside  LUCINDA  Where the deuce is your name "MoreloveRangerDorimantBlackacre"Well this Mr Blackacre was a perfect curiosity Instead of saying civil things of my person he talked of nothing but my estate and assured me when the present leases expired he would let the whole at an improv'd rent  BELLFIELD  Why such a fellow was fitter to be bailiff or steward of your manor  LUCINDA  There was something handsome about him toono not handsome neitherI don't know how to describe him A sort of symmetry of features and a faint bloom that made a comely kind of deformity No symptoms of sensibility no expression of a feeling mind and he appeared to me likely to make that sort of husband who has no manner of vice gets up in  a morning regularly eats his breakfast looks over his accounts goes to the coffeehouse comes home to dinner reads his letters goes to the coffeehouse again reads the eveningpapers comes home to supper and goes tobedHa ha  BELLFIELD  Ha ha Why you give portraits in miniature as well as any painter of them all  LUCINDA  Ha ha I laugh whenever I think of the manHe brought me all the news of the day  BELLFIELD  Ay  LUCINDA  Oh all but none that I valued no news about the little victories this figure obtain'd in the world no advices of what was said about my last new capthe happy arrangement of a patch no intelligence about a particular bloom of my complexion never came with a  We hear from Ranelagh that Lucinda's eyes scattered death and torment among all the beaus last Fridaynight  No no such thing it was all political intelligence and being a favourite I had it warm from the mint At ten in the morning there was an action in Germany and the French lost ten thousand men upon the field of battle three princes of the blood and five marshals of France At twelve the news was premature At two an express was arriv'd at the secretary of state's In the evening the victory was not so complete and a noble lord was heard to say that if a certain general  had done his duty the balance of Europe would have been settled At night the whole report was false and there was no battle at all  BELLFIELD  You would have had all the joys of dear variety with such an husband  LUCINDA  Oh horridI told him at length that I could not consider him in the light of a lover but that really he was a very good newspaper and that whenever he was out of hand or not bespoke I should be glad to be entertain'd with the topic of the dayHa ha  BELLFIELD  And so order'd your servants to take him in instead of the Chronicle or Public LedgerHa haBy laughing at all her lovers she is determined to have me  Aside  Upon my soul Lucinda you have a very pretty groupe of humourists  LUCINDA  Enough to furnish our a comedyThe vain the proud the formal the brisk every species of the ridiculous and absurd has been my most obedient very humble servantAnd herehere's another character to help out the piece "Mr Bellfield"  BELLFIELD  Well let us hear  LUCINDA  Condemn'd August the sixteenth for looking at himself in the glass for a full half hour while he was directing his discourse  to me  There you are outlaw'd for open rebellion against my beautyhold up your handand what have you to say why judgment of death should not pass upon you  BELLFIELD  Why I have your pardon in my pocket  LUCINDA  Oh to be sure I who claim homage from every pretty fellow am likely to forgive the disaffected person who disputes my title and becomes a vain pretender to it himself  BELLFIELD  How can you talk thus when you know I have worshipp'd you even to idolatry and have offer'd up prayers on my very knees to you  LUCINDA  But I require true devotion in your prayers Would it not provoke the patience of a saint to have a wellpowder'd fop kneel at his shrine with a "There's a handsome fellow for you mind my cloaths Brussels lace diamondring saucy snuffbox and impudent face" And this too under the notion of asking a blessing  BELLFIELD  My dear Lucinda I never knew you so much out Would not you have a man go to his prayers with a good conscience And what are the pleasures of a good conscience The applauses of one's own heartNow my dear ma'am if when I approach you I have some selfapproving airs am not I therefore the better intitled to you  LUCINDA  Heav'ns I am frighten'd at youYou are a freethinker in lovePreach this doctrine to the ladies and they will call it downright heresy  BELLFIELD  Very like But surely were I to make my advances with darts and flames and Cupid and Venus and the Graces I should be a meer uninstructed pagan Whe  eas at present I only want to discard superstition and idle ceremonials and so establish the true system of love  LUCINDA  Which you take to consist in  BELLFIELD  In the language of the heartAs instanceI love you shall study your happiness and so let me call the parson  LUCINDA  Easy and impudentBut love's religion is a sort of popery and requires penance and fasting and watching and that you should pray for favours in a language almost unintelligibleBut you say your prayers in the vulgar tongue "And so let me call the parson" Why you might as well come most cavalierly to my house take possession of an arm chair and  Here bring me my nightgown and slippers  BELLFIELD  And as all the sighs and verses and fine things of lovers must end in that you had better wave ceremony for as to Careless tho' you may think you have hold of his heart  LUCINDA  CarelessI desire you will never mention himCarelessA senseless wretchA vile inconstantwho abandons me as if age had suddenly rendered me loathlome  BELLFIELD  Why faith though I detest the treachery I can't upon this occasion quarrel with the traitor  LUCINDA  Oh Sir I dare say you applaud his conduct and would like him declare that I might pass very well for a mistress to toy an hour with and must shortly come to thatBut for a wifeoh shocking  BELLFIELD  Has he dar'd talk thus Lucinda  LUCINDA  Even to the lowest wretch on earth to that fellow La Jeunesse who dress'd my hair about half an hour agoOh if my brother were in England he should find I do not want a friend to assert my honour  BELLFIELD  By Heaven I'll do it this very day myselfNow you shall have proof of the sincerity with which I lovePronounce me unworthy of you if your wrongs are not redress'd within this hour  Exit  LUCINDA  Yet why should vexation thus get the better of meMr Bellfield gone Heav'ns he talk'd something of calling this base man to an account  I hope he won't be mad enough to think of such a thingSo so Mr Careless coming this wayI will not even condescend to upbraid him with his basenessI'll swear I could almost find in my heart to throw myself into Bellfield's arms to pique the wretch  Exit  Enter  CARELESS  and  WISELY  CARELESS  Ha ha is not he a ridiculous character  WISELY  Yes something singular in his way  CARELESS  Poor Sir PhilipA passion for dancing when the use of his limbs has almost left himI am glad we have got rid of himHa ha'Sdeath here he comes again with St Vitus strong upon him  Enter Sir  PHILIP FIGUREIN  SIR PHILIP  In a minuet step  I

happiness I am bound for London Sir  SIR PHILIP  Po po prithee man stay this night be in at the diversions with your friends  WISELY  I have not your spirits Sir Philip I must beg to be excusedI am not so young a man as you are  SIR PHILIP  Why considering all I am pretty young  throws back his shoulders and turns out his toes  All owing to the exercise I takeI dance three thousand miles a year  WISELY  So much  CARELESS  Ay and moreWhy he goes to all the assemblies within thirty miles round London  SIR PHILIP  Turning his arms in and out  Yes I go to all I call it sacrificing to the graces Socrates the philosopher call'd it so before me He sacrific'd to the graces at threescore  WISELY  I should like to have seen the old philosopher turning out his toes  SIR PHILIP  Turns out his toes and hums a tune  The old philosopher Sir lov'd the elegant arts And there was Scaliger a man of great learning and an eminent critiche danc'd a Pyrrhic dancea dance well known to the ancients Mr CarelessScaliger Sir danc'd a Pyrrhic dance to the astonishment of all Germany We have his own word for it  WISELY  And well they might be astonished  SIR PHILIP  Why so Sir why so  CARELESS  Very

responsible woman is my lady Portsokenmoves a minuet like a cathedralIndeed a slight accident happen'd to me  CARELESS  Ay what was that  SIR PHILIP  Why Sir in the harmonious movement under the great branch in the middle of the room an unlucky hook took a fancy to my wigI lost the honours of my head Sir they were suspended in air and I mov'd thro' my minuet quite insensible of the disaster  CARELESS  Ha ha my dear knight an unlucky accident  SIR PHILIP  Oh no nothingI did not mind it a few lampoons epigrams and little lutestring verses for the summerseason flew about I danced  onthey could not put me out of time One of the smart sonneteers of the place charg'd the accident home upon me and in pretty Namby Pamby call'd it the Rape of the Lock The feet of his verse might be very good but my feet were never the worse I laughed and answer'd him out of Horace  Nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus  CARELESS  Admirable an excellent repartee  WISELY  So it wasA propos Sir Philip I

Turning out his toes  It is the worst passion in the world  WISELY  You had a beautiful seat there  SIR PHILIP  Pleasantly situated SirYou were near the assembly at Salisbury the assembly at Winchester and the assembly at Southampton  CARELESS  Ha ha that was convenient ha Wisely  WISELY  Ay very convenient  SIR PHILIP  Yes and the estate was much improv'd of late For my friend George

the graces  CARELESS  Well I challenge the world for such another philosopher  SIR PHILIP  I call myself a peripatetic philosopherI go about for the serenity of my mindI had a letter yesterday from my attorney to meet him on Monday next at the Mitre tavern in Fleetstreet in order to sign deeds of lease and release for a small estate in Berkshire a little out at elbows but I have appointed him to meet me at the Long Room at Hampstead  CARELESS  Why there that's an odd place  SIR PHILIP  The best in the world because when the business is finished I can then go and give right hand and left at

BRAZEN  And I'll bring on a general action I warrant me  Exeunt  Enter  LUCINDA  and  HORTENSIA  LUCINDA  My dear Hortensia that is carrying it too faryou grow captiousthere is no harm in a little raillery sure  HORTENSIA  But won't you allow me to be deeper in my own secrets than any body else  LUCINDA  No by no means we are all very ingenious in deceiving ourselves Our passions wear so many cunning disguises we hardly know themSpleen shall pass for wit avarice  onomy  and the love of a man shall often be thought a mere female vanity in hearing the praises of a shape or a feature  HORTENSIA  So that if I suffer a civil thing from a pretty fellow the pleasure I find from the compliment makes a quick transition to a liking of the man  LUCINDA  Instantly and almost imperceptibly to ourselves And when we think we are putting him off with our arts of cold delay it is at the bottom but mere coquetry to draw him on the more Like playing with edge tools till we cut ourselves  HORTENSIA  Still I am not wounded  LUCINDA  I'II lay you a pot of coffee you are married before me  HORTENSIA  You'll loseThere is nothing in my conduct that can  LUCINDA  I beg your pardonThere is in you serious people a sedate love of pleasure that we giddy creatures never come up to We receive slight impressions and slight impressions chatter away and evaporate in the whirl of our fancy Now you demure ones dwell upon what gains access to your hearts and then your thoughts are like what they tell me of white powderThey make no noise but are full of mischief  HORTENSIA  This is very strangeBut let me assure you I have not forgot my poor deceas'd husband  LUCINDA  Ay but that tender melancholy will so dispose your mind to receive the kindred passion of love that I should not wonder ifin short grief is very amorous my dear  HORTENSIA  Mighty fineBut the man who makes me sacrifice my liberty must have an extraordinary merit  LUCINDA  There again nowAnother of the masquerade habits our passions wearWhen you are in love with a man's person you fancy it is a refin'd esteem for his meritOh Hortensia under that illusion the heart of a woman will soften and melt prodigiouslyDo you think it possible to have a lasting esteem for a man merely on the score of his merit  HORTENSIA  Surely is not it natural to love virtue  LUCINDA  Why to speak a plain truth which I would not have a man hear from me for the world whims passions and desires are the groundworks of our minds and virtue I am afraid is but inlaid  HORTENSIA  O fy Lucinda  LUCINDA  O fy hypocrite  HORTENSIA  Pray now let me ask you have you no esteem for Mr Careless  LUCINDA  A propos I forgot to tell youwell I adore my ease on this occasionSure every thing is at an end between me and that gentleman  HORTENSIA  You amaze meWas not the weddingday fix'd  LUCINDA  Yes I was under sentence of matrimonybut he has sent me a reprieve  HORTENSIA  Can it be possible  LUCINDA  He is going to be married to another  HORTENSIA  You astonish meShe does not suspect me  Aside  Going to be married to anotherNo woman of delicacy would hearken to him considering how far matters have been carried with you  LUCINDA  Why if there is any lady really smitten the dispute between her love and her delicacy will not last longDelicacy may talk of nice points of honour but that will only reach the head While every syllable from that little urchin Love will make its way directly to the heart and while Delicacy is reading lectures Love will persuade and so the business is over  But pray my dear had not you heard this before  HORTENSIA  I my dearI hope he has not divulg'd any thing  Aside  How can you ask such a questionI am not in a course of towntalk  LUCINDA  Why I don't knowone is always saying one silly thing or anotherLet's change the subject the man is not worth a moment's thought his indiscretion is the smallest of his faultsMy rest shan't suffer a single wink for him  HORTENSIA  That's right Lucinda give me your hand and take my adviceIf the false man deserts you shew yourself a girl of spirit on the occasionThe wretch is not worth a single smile from any of our sexan idle vain boasterto trust him is taking up water with a sieveSo resolve at once to look down with scorn both on him and the vain beauty that prides herself in the conquestWish her joy of her bargain my dear and think no more about him  Enter  BRAZEN  in a livery  BRAZEN  Madam Hortensia my master presents his compliments  HORTENSIA  Careless's livery  Aside  Who is your master  BRAZEN  Mr Careless  LUCINDA  Mr Careless

hard heart "Won't you consider Sir that Hortensia"  Hold your tongue you rascaldo as I bid you  and so off he brushed to the tune of an old song  sings  One kiss of a maid's worth two of a window  LUCINDA  Ho ho hoThis is worth all the discoveries of all the philosophers for a thousand yearsThis is the most whimsical accidentHa ha  HORTENSIA  Fool that I was  Aside  Who bribed you Sir to be guilty of this rudenessLucinda I assure you  LUCINDA  My dear HortensiaHo ho ho  HORTENSIA  Nay if you won't give me have to speakBegone fellow this moment I know nothing of your master  LUCINDA  Well

worseWell done Brazen this will do rarely  Exit  LUCINDA  My dear Madam you'll excuse mebut if my life depended upon it I can't help laughing  HORTENSIA  You need not triumph on the occasion You are welcome to the gentleman  LUCINDA  No doubtThe man that insinuates himself into your good graces must have an extraordinary merit  HORTENSIA  Mighty wellIf you must run on  LUCINDA  Besides you have not as yet forgot your poor deceas'd husband  HORTENSIA  This raillery is unseasonable madam  LUCINDA  Well now do you know that I was weak enough to suppose that no woman of delicacy  stifles a laugh  considering how far things had been carried with me  laughs out  HORTENSIA  Oh shame shame All my ill stars combin'd  LUCINDA  Come come give me your hand Hortensia if the false man deserts you shew your self a woman of spirit on the occasion  HORTENSIA  Oh insupportable  breaks away  LUCINDA  Following her  To trust him is taking up water with a sieve and so look down with scorn on him and the vain beautyHo ho  laughs heartily  HORTENSIA  I sha'n't stay to be insulted  Exit  LUCINDA  And has your Aeneas left you  looking after her  poor disconsolate DidoOh I shall expire with laughingWell I

studied the exercise of the fan  LUCINDA  Scandalous wretch  CARELESS  A lover with you has as bad a time as a poor animal in a philosopher's airpumpWhen your false refinements are too thin for him to subsist upon they are render'd somewhat more substantial by letting in a little air of commonsense that you may have the pleasure of ratifying all away again and so leave a poor deluded fellow panting for his existence  LUCINDA  Why I like to try experiments upon 'emBut Mr Careless you tried the most admirable experiment today that ever yet was thought ofHa haI must laugh with you tho' you don't

notice of one anotherBut I'll embarrass them both  Aside  Oh Mr Blunt I am so lucky that you and this company came to my reliefYour friend Careless has so pester'd me with his fulsome flattery and his tender pain and his pleasing anguish and all the nonsense of love  CARELESS  I Ma'amThe conversation seem'd to have taken a very different turn  LUCINDA  Oh you hideous man do you deny itHortensia such a scene you never saw  HORTENSIA  I dare say Ma'am  forcing a laugh  it was at once both very acceptable and very ridiculous  LUCINDA  The wretch was down on his knees to me heartbroken sighing

Aside to  Blunt  SIR PHILIP  For that matter I think ye both Ladies highly worthy of my friend CarelessFor you are two as good romps in a countrydance as I ever desire to cast off and figure in withI think one of you should take the gentleman out  LUCINDA  For my part I'm engag'dShall I make interest for you Ma'am  HORTENSIA  The character the gentleman bears and the light you have made him appear in are sufficient to warn a woman of prudence against so dangerous a risk  CARELESS  Blessngs on her discretion and goodsense for abusing me so  Aside  Blunt you see she won't give the smallest suspicion of what's dependingI'll throw my mite into the scale to convince her of my prudence  SIR PHILIP  Come come Careless be brisksomething in your own defencedon't be out of time  CARELESS  I must do the lady the justice to say that I have not the happiness or merit of deserving a place in her good graces  HORTENSIA  You own it false man do you  Aside  LUCINDA  And are you insensible to the lady's superior beauty and that distinguish'd prudence with which she moves so orderly in every sphere of life  CARELESS  PrudenceWhy faith prudence may be a very useful qualification in trade and may answer the purposes of a mercer upon Ludgatehill or a moneyscrivener in the cityBut I wish may die if I have not always thought prudence the most frigid virtue a person of fashion can be possessed of  HORTENSIA  I dare say you think so  Aside  LUCINDA  Ho ho  CARELESS  I do it well don't I Blunt  SIR PHILIP  It is in life as in dancingEvery thing should be done with briskness and activity of

not in love with any of the company I promise you  HORTENSIA  And if I am may I be married to the wretch for my punishment  CARELESS  A sly inuendo BluntAnd as to me if I felt a single symptom of love so far from concealing it I did not care if it was the whole talk of every party at cards and scandal throughout the city of London and liberty of Westminster  HORTENSIA  That I do verily believe

judgment and discretion  BLUNT  But she seem'd to speak with acrimony  CARELESS  Oh I ador'd her for thatShe's a charming woman and a word of abuse out of her mouth is worth all the praises of the rest of her sexHa haIt was the luckiest interviewand gave me the finest opportunity of shiningHa haShe carried it off finely too  When women praise their passions gently move  But if they rail then

understanding have a relapse I dare say  BELLFIELD  I should not like to lose her but I could laugh at the loss  WISELY  Then it won't grieve you to hear that Careless and she are well together again
