 CRITICAL STRICTURES ON THE New TRAGEDY OF ELVIRA  Price SIXPENCE  CRITICAL STRICTURES ON THE New TRAGEDY OF ELVIRA WRITTEN BY Mr DAVID MALLOCH  LONDON Printed for W FLEXNEY near Gray'sInn Holborn MDCCLXIII  Advertisement  We have followed the Authority of Sir  David Dalrymple  and Mr  Samuel Johnson  in the Orthography of Mr  Malloch  's Name as we imagine the Decision of these Gentlemen will have more weight in the World of Letters than even that of the said Mr  Malloch  himself  CRITICAL STRICTURES  c  IN our Strictures on the Tragedy of  Elvira  we shall not hasten all at once into the midst of Things according to the Rules of Epic Poetry Heroic Poems and Remarks on New Plays are things so essentially different that they ought not to be written by the same Rules  Had Mr  Malloch  been aware of these Distinctions in writing which surely are not very nice he probably would have discovered that Scenes admirably adapted for forming a Burlesque Tragedy would never succeed in forming a serious Drama In the Prologue the Author informs us that the Preliminaries of Peace are signed and the War now over and he humbly hopes as we have spared the  French  we will spare his Tragedy But as the Principles of Restitution seem at present strong in this Nation before we extend our Mercy to him we insist that in imitation of his Superiors he shall restore every thing valuable he has plunder'd from the  French  during the Course of his sad and tedious Composition  In the first Scene of this Tragedy a Gentleman who has been abroad during the Wars requests his Friend to acquaint him with what has past at Court in the time of his Absence We were equally surprized and delighted with this new Method of informing the Spectators of the Transactions prior to the Commencement of the Play nothing can be more natural for we imagine the Art of conveying Letters by Post was at that time undiscovered We must indeed acknowledge that during the time of the Roman Empire Letters were transmitted with the utmost Celerity from one Part to another of those immense Dominions but we also know that after  the Subversion of that State by the Incursions of the  Goths  and  Vandals  the first Act of Cruelty committed by these Barbarians was murdering all the PostBoys in cold Blood In like manner as our inhuman  Edward  upon his compleating the Conquest of  Wales  ordered all the Bards to be put to Death amongst the Number of which had Mr  Malloch  been included we had not now been tortured with his execrable Tragedy Novelty of the same kind with this we have mentioned runs thro' the whole Play almost every Scene being an Interview and a  tête a tête  The King wants to see his Son the Queen wants to see  Elvira Elvira  wants to see the King and so on thro' the Five Acts  No new Thoughts or Sentiments are to be found in this Performance we meet only with old ones absurdly expressed  Dryden  said that  Ben Johnson  was every where to be traced in the Snow of the Ancients We may say that  Malloch  is every where to be traced in the Puddle of the Moderns Instead of selecting the Beauties he has pick'd out whatever is despicable in  Shakespeare Otway Dryden  and  Rowe  like a PickPocket who dives for Handkerchiefs not for Gold and contents himself with what he finds in our Great Coat Pocket without attempting our Watch or your Purse Tho' Mr  Malloch  may only mean to borrow yet as he possesses no Fund of Original  Genius from whence he can pay his Debts borrowing we are afraid is an inadequate Expression the harsher one of stealing we must therefore tho' reluctantly substitute in its room In the Prologue he acknowledges himself a Culprit but as the Loss of what he has pilfered is insignificant to the Owners we shall bring him in guilty only of Petty Larcenary We believe he has been driven like poor People in this severe Weather by dire Necessity to such dishonest Shifts  In this Play the Author has introduced a Rebellion unparalleled in any History Ancient or Modern He raises his Rebellions as a skilful Gardener does his Mushrooms in a Moment and like an artful Nurse  he lulls in a Moment the fretful Child asleep The Prince enters an Appartment of the Palace with a drawn Sword this forms the Rebellion The King enters the same Appartment without a drawn Sword This quashes the Rebellion How to credit this Story or to pardon this poetical Licence we are greatly at a Loss for we know in the Year three thousand Mountaineers actually appeared at  Derby Cataline  we are credibly informed had a Gang of at least a Dozen stout Fellows and it is pretty certain that  Bedemar  when going to inslave  Venice  had provided Pistols and Battle Powder for more than fifteen fighting Men We are almost tempted to think that Mr  Malloch  gets his Rebellions ready made like his  Scotch  Tobacco cut and dry at the Sign of the Valiant Highlander  Our great Author possesses in its utmost Perfection the happy Art of uniting rival Ladies and of setting at Variance a virtuous Father and Son How intimate his Acquaintance with Human Nature How deep his Knowledge of the Passions No less exquisite and refined in his Morality like a true Disciple of Lord  Bolingbroke  he unites Vice and Virtue most lovingly together witness this memorable Line of the King's addressed to  Elvira  'Midst all your Guilt I must admire your Virtue  Let us invert this Line  'Midst all your Virtue I must abhor your Guilt  Let us parody it  O Mr  David Malloch  'midst all your Dullness I must admire your Genius  We heard it once asserted by  David Hume  Esq  that Mr  Malloch  was destitute of the Pathetic In this Observation however we beg leave to differ with him In the fourth Act the whole Board of Portuguese Privy Counsellors are melted into Tears The Trial of the Prince moves the Hearts of those Monsters of Iniquity those Members of Inquisition when the less humane Audience are in Danger from the Tediousness  of two insipid Harangues of falling fast asleep This majestic Scene is too exactly copied from a Trial at the  Old Bailey  to have even the Merit of Originality And indeed it is to the Lenity of the King of  Portugal  that we owe by far the greater Part of this amazing Play The good Man lets his rebellious Subjects out of Prison to chat with him when a wiser Monarch would have kept them close confined in  Newgate  The incomparable Action of that universal Genius Mr  Garrick  alone saved this Act from the Damnation it deserved Had not he like a second  Aeneas  carried the old doating and decrepid Father on his Back he must have lain by the W  y Tho' we must observe another Character in this Play  seemed better suited to the Impetuosity and Fire of this Actor We could not but smile at the Humour of a merry Wag in the Pit who at the Conclusion of one of the most tiresome Pleadings with some Degree of Impatience and Emotion called out  Encore encore  In the fifth Act we were melted with the Sight of two young Children which the King embraced which the Prince embraced which  Elvira  embraced Mr  Addison  in the th No of the  Spectator  has some Remarks so judicious and lively on the Practice of introducing Children on the Stage that we must beg leave to transcribe the Passage  "A disconsolate Mother with a Child in her Hand has frequently drawn Compassion from the Audience and has therefore gained a Place in several Tragedies a modern Writer who observed how this had taken in other Plays being resolved to double the Distress and melt his Audience twice as much as those before him had done brought a Princess on the Stage with a little Boy in one Hand and a Girl in the other A third Poet being resolved to outwrite all his Predecessors a few Years ago introduced three Children with great Success and as I am informed a young Gentleman who is sully determined to break the most obdurate Heart has  a Tragedy by him where the first Person that appears on the Stage is an afflicted Widow in her mourning Weeds with half a dozen fatherless Children attending her like those that usually hang about the Figure of Charity Thus several Incidents that are beautiful in a good Writer become ridiculous by falling into the Hands of a bad one"  We would suggest to Mr  Malloch  the useful Hint of introducing in some of his future Productions the whole Foundling Hospital which with a well painted Scene of the Edifice itself would certainly call forth the warmest Tears of Pity and the bitterest Emotions of Distress  especially when we consider that many of the Parents of these unfortunate Babes would probably be Spectators of this interesting Scene  The Conclusion of the Piece is as abrupt as the other Parts of it are absurd We should be much at a Loss to guess by whom the Poison is administered to  Elvira  were we not aided in our Conjectures by the shrewd Suspicions which the King tho' otherwise a very loving Husband seems to entertain of his Wife Upon my regreting that her Majesty if guilty should escape without poetical Justice at least a Gentleman who sat behind me a Friend as I supposed of the Author assured me her Punishment was reserved for the Farce which for that  Purpose was contrary to Custom added to the Play  Though in general this Tragedy is colder than the most extreme Parts of  Nova Zembla  yet we now and then feel a Warmth but it is such a Warmth or Glow rath  as is sometimes produced by the Handling of Snow  Bad as this Play is yet will the Author have the Profits of his Three Nights Few on the First Night having either Taste or Spirit to express their Disapprobation Like the Rascals who plundered  Lisbon  after the Earthquake Mr  David Malloch  will extract Guineas out of Rubbish  We shall now give in a few Words the Quintessence of this Play Monarchs ought to be just Heroes are bad Men Husbands ought to die for their Wives Wives for their Husbands We ought to govern our Passions And the Sun shines on all alike A few of these new Remarks form the Sum total of this contemptible Piece  After the Play we were entertained with an Epilogue fraught with Humour and spoken with Spirit There was a Simile of a Bundle of Twigs formed into a Rod which seemed to convey a delicate Allusion to Mr  Malloch  's original Profession and some of the Lines contained an exquisite and severe Criticism on the Play itself  Amidst all the harshness inspired by a real Feeling of the Dulness of the Composition itself it would be unjust not to bestow the highest Applause on the principal Performers by the Energy of whose Action even Dulness was sometimes rendered respectable We were sorry to find such great Talents so very ill employed The melting Tones of a  Cibber  should make every Eye stream with Tears  Pritchard  should always elevate  Garrick  give Strength and Majesty to the Scene Let us soften at the keen Distress of a  Belvidera  let our Souls rise with the Dignity of an  Elizabeth  let us tremble at the wild Madness of a  Lear  but let us not Yawn at the Stupidity of uninteresting Characters  FINIS
