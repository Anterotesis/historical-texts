 THE MAN OF TEN THOUSAND A COMEDY  AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  THE SECOND EDITION  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW    ADVERTISEMENT  THE character of Major Rampart was intended to represent one of those persons who imagine they have uttered volumes without having said a word whose eager looks inform us how important they suppose their own conceptions to be but being too mighty for utterance language sinks under them and they expect the assent and applause of their companions to their Humphs Hays and expletives These expletives as used by the Major are omitted in representation because they offended They are here restored and left to the consideration of the reader It may be necessary to add they should not be pronounced in an articulate and emphatical manner but with a halfmuttering rapidity accompanied by equally rapid glances looking round for and demanding admiration  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Dorington  Mr KEMBLE  Hairbrain

FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The House of  CURFEW  OLIVIA  and Lady  TAUNTON  Lady  T  OH ho you romantic creature Ha ha ha Pure undivided hearts Do you think our handsome fellows and fine women trouble themselves about pure undivided hearts Lud They know nothing about hearts They have no hearts  Oli  Nor heads neither perhaps  Lady  T  Oh no They have no use for them Thinking and feeling are out of fashion  Oli  Well they must at least be allowed the virtue of candour  Lady  T  Oh yes To glory in our failings is the essence of good breeding Hypocrisy and affectation are laughed out of doors  Oli  I wish folly and effrontery had kept them company  Lady  T  Oh you cruel thing What would become of persons of fashion without folly and effrontery They would lose their existence They would be out of countenance at every word and blush at every thought  Oli  They are in no danger blushes and bloom are become mere articles of perfumeryYour Ladyship dined in Brookstreet yesterday  Lady  T  Oh With Dorington Yes Do you know I begin to think him a very charming man I envy you Butis the match quite certain Is there no chance of rivalling you  Oli  Your Ladyship is the best judge of that  Lady  T  Why I really feel half inclined I don't know but I may Beware of me for if I set about it there is danger I assure you he was very attentive and I was very much pleased I never saw a man more gallant  Oli  I should have hoped you had never seen one less  Lady  T  Indeed And why pray  Oli  A man attentive to the happiness of others I delight in but a gallant man is a vender of falsehood by system  Lady  T  Dear  Oli  And a character I despise  Lady  T  I protest you are jealous  Oli  No I can renounce but I cannot condescend to suspect  Lady  T  Well I declare I had not the least intention to put you in a flurry  Oli  A flurry Ha ha ha  Lady  T  Nay nay laugh out What you can't Well well I own you have reason to be alarmed We who from our childhood have been used to move in the first circles have always something fascinating in our manner  Oli  Your manners are very marking indeed  Lady  T  I must be going Good morning But it is very true rank will carry it against riches So if any thing should happen do not indulge these violent emotions nor do not pout and complain like a city miss that your friend has betrayed you because her attractions had the power that yours wanted  Oli  Complain No no I am not so totally a Novice as to complain of unexpected treachery in a Lady of fashion  Lady  T  It is very ill bred to be jealous It is a confession of inferiority Good bye my dear I see you are not well I will send somebody to you Good bye Remember  Exit  Oli  Why this is admirable Can Dorington endure these manners Can he countenance can he esteem or what is worse can he affect to esteem nay can he coquet with this fashionable Lady If he can his heart and mine have no affinity I seem to have been most miserably mistaken  SCENE II  Enter  ANNABEL  hastily with fear  Ann  Dear Madam What is the matter  Oli  With whom  Ann  Lady Taunton bade me run to you for she said you were in a fit  Oli  Better and better  Ann  Why did she tell me such an untruth  Oli  For the joke's sake I suppose  Ann  Oh the wicked  Oli  Sneers and insults are become the commonplace jests of a certain set who may aptly enough be termed high low life And with these Dorington associates These are his friends They never shall be mine  Ann  Law now you are angry again with mine and my cousin's dear protector  Oli  The just the feeling the delicate mind I only can admire The sweet intercourse of intelligent and pure souls revolts alike at trivial unmeaning gallantry clandestine love and that audacious vice which sets censure at defiance  Ann  Dear now I would not be jealous of my poor Herbert for  Oli  Annabel you do me wrong I am not jealous Mine is a more dignified motive  Ann  Dignified motive dear Lady is a fine name but I doubt it is what most people call jealousy  Oli  Annabel I forgive this injustice to your friend  Ann  Ah Madam I love you dearly Dearly Indeed I do I am sure my Herbert's Dorington and you were made for one another  Oli  No we are not I never can never will be the wife of the friend ofdepravity and vice  SCENE III  Footman and Lord  LAROON  Foot  Lord Laroon  Exit  Lord  L  Madam your most obedient I passed Lady Taunton at the corner Has she been visiting you  Oli  She has  Lord  L  Ha ha ha Well her Ladyship is certainly the highest bred woman in the kingdom Ah my sweet Annabel  ▪Toying Annabel offended  Pooh I brought your cousin in my carriage  Calling  Herbert Where are you  Ann  Pleased  Come in Herbert  Lord  L  Ay come in Was not I kind I dare say he will let me have a kiss  Her  Interposing  Your pardon vor that Wi▪ us Lords tho'f they be Lords don't kiss country cousins  Oli  But what is the high breeding of Lady Taunton  Lord  L  Breeding Breeding Oh I recollect I thought it had escaped you A very marking trait Her very first visit in the morning to the Lady whom over night she had been endeavouring to undo  Oli  Undo  Lord  L  Undo No no Undo was thewrong word Too strong Rather too strong I merely meant rival  Oli  Well well her Ladyship's success is certain  Lord  L  You do not think so  Oli  What can an "unfinished scarce half made up" simple creature like myself oppose to all a fashionable Lady's borrowed beauties and bought perfections Hair sheared from the dead teeth plucked from the living a shape bespoke of a mantuamaker a complexion purchased in Spain grace imported by figurants taste by Italian fiddlers elegance by French courtezans and manners improved by the polite conversation of grooms and the attic wit of gamblers  Lady  L  Very true And I fairly tell you this formidable train she now brings to the attack  Oli  How condescending in her Ladyship How kind in you Yet should she succeed I do not think your Lordship would feel any exquisite pain  Lord  L  How should I It has long been my ambition to make you a peeress  Oli  Commoner as I am how shall I return the obligation Especially when I remember your friendly endeavours to promote a quarrel between me and Dorington  Lord  L  Only for the good of all parties  Oli  Oh To be sure Then perhaps to answer this charitable end a little deviation from the truth now  Lord  L  No Upon my honour I have a witness Herbert  Her  My Lord  Lord  L  You can testify  Her  What can I testivy  Lord  L  Did not you see my dear friend hand Lady Taunton down the staircase  Her  May hap I did  Ann  Making signs  Herbert Be quiet  Her  And may hap I had as lieve a' zeen zummut else  Ann  Be quiet I tell thee  Lord  L  And how long had the company been gone  Her  I can't tell  Lord  L  Less or more than half an hour  Her  I can't tell  Lord  L  You see Madam that charming handsome hussey is bribing him to silence  Oli  I see my Lord all that you or Lady Taunton could wish and what is more it has produced  the very effect you both intended Present my compliments therefore and tell her she need not tax her own ingenuity or your friendship farther Tell her she may declare it as my avowed resolution never to be the partner of a man whose principles do not forbid him that dalliance that hypocrisy which he may call good breeding but which I know to be vice  Exit  Lord  L  Ha ha ha  Ann  I wonder that being a Lord you are not ashamed to raise jealousy and quarrels between true lovers  Lord  L  Charming innocent Ha ha ha I shall make love to you  Her  Begging your pardon but you shan't tho'  Lord  L  I have a pretty tale to tell you  Her  Don't ee believe 'n Annabel Don't ee believe a word he zays I zee nothing but fibs in his face Come away  Lord  L  I shall meet with you alone and then  Exit  Her  What then What then Did thee ever zee such sheameful doings Wilt come  Ann  Why are you vexed Herbert  Her  What did thee let him look at thee zo vor  Ann  Nah Never mind his looks What if he be a Lord and offered me watches and rings  Her  Did he Did heI wish I'd a heard 'n That's al  Ann  I would rather walk in the fields arm in arm with my Herbert than swing ding here and there and every where with a Lord in his chariot  Her  Would thee Annabel Would thee  Ann  You know I would Herbert So you  should not be jealous Oh it is very bad Very bad to be jealous  Her  "Well well I won't" Come thy way Come  Exeunt fondly  SCENE IV  The Library of  DORINGTON  DORINGTON  and  CURFEW  Dor  Indeed Sir you are mistaken You attribute interest to me which I do not possess I have no view in the company I keep and the dinners I give except conviviality  Cur  Excuse me this would be a very proper apology or putoff to your Major or such people but not to the guardian of an heiress  Dor  In my opinion Sir it would be much less proper to the Major than to you  Cur  Sir  Dor  You have money and friends he has neither You are childless he is the father of a family  Cur  And for this reason he is to be served rather than me  Dor  Could you desire a better  Cur  In my humble judgment Olivia has a hundred thousand pounds and I am her Guardian  Dor  Ha ha ha Nay nay I mean no offence  SCENE

the soul It is cruel It is really cruel Very cruel  Dor  Shorten your exordium come to the point  Sir  P  I cannot Yetit would lay me under eternal obligations Serve me essentially  Dor  Well  Sir  P  You have an inexhaustible share of the milk of human kindness I know you never refuse a tried and true friend  Dor  Sir Pertinax I shall join with his Lordship and begin to suspect  Sir  P  Why look

bid you a good morning Sir It is suffocating  Sir  P  Holding him  You shall not leave your friend in anger Your dear your obliged your everlasting friend Is a heart overcharged with gratitude hateful

Your family has produced many highminded and excellent men You have a son worthy of ancestors whose virtues live while they sleep in peace To rescue his patrimony from the gripe of usury and give it a chance of becoming beneficial I willingly grant what you ask  Sir  P  My kind my incomparable friend I feel these painful pleasing scenes too intimately They depress and wound elevate and heal There is no describing  Dor  Sir PertinaxHave not I told you you shall have the money  Sir  P  Oh my heart  Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  The House of  CURFEW  OLIVIA  and Lord  LAROON  Oli  IF your Lordship hopes to torment me by these tales you mistake the means I grieve at Dorington's conduct for his own sake not for mine  Lord  L  Why grieve for any body's sake The Dowager is a person of fashion Her rout is fashionable her faro bank is fashionable All the world was there  Qli  For which some of them I fear are now execrating all the world  Lord  L  A dozen at least among my own particular friends Lady Hotwater was terribly cut Her last stake was a desperate venture Her frame distorted her cheeks livid her hand palsied she cut a card lost shrieked fell in a fit was carried out in convulsions and is this morning parted from her husband It was a high scene  Oli  You seem to have enjoyed it  Lord  L  Oh It was in a great stile  Oli  You no doubt were on the right side  Lord  L  Me I am a partner in the bank  Oli  And was Dorington a loser  Lord  L  Ha ha ha That now is pleasant I knew you would ask The fact is he is in for it to some purpose I don't know the sum Bills and drafts handed about by wholesale  Oli  You are his dear friend  Lord  L  I am  Oli  Why did not you prevent him  Lord  L  Oh Lord Ha ha ha I and Sir Pertinax got him to piquet and touched him for ten thousand  Oli  Beside his loss at faro  Lord  L  Oh yes Sir Peter is a deep schemer He completely wiped off an old score of seven thousand I have draughts for three in my pocket which I shall present today or tomorrow Are not you sorry  Oli  More for his loss of morals than of money To the latter his fortune is equal  Lord  L  Pardon me To prodigality like his no fortune is equal for he gives and lends more than he loses  Oli  And you his intimate friends encourage him in ruin  Lord  L  My dear Madam what is it to me if my friend be disposed to ruin himself My time would be well employed were I to preach maxims of wisdom to all who choose to play the fool I must tell every man I meet he is a blockhead and get my throat cut fifty times a day Dorington is my dear friend but like many more of my dear friends he is a damned  SCENE II  DORINGTON  introduced  Lord  L  Ah Dorington This is quite apropos You were the last man in our mouths You cannot imagine how many things I have been saying in your praise Have not I Madam  Oli  You have said a great deal I own  Lord  L  Yes I was telling her what bad success you had last night  Dor  Was that in my praise  Lord  L  To be sure What does a hero like you mind the loss of a few thousands Your halfsouled fellows on such an occasion will take opium over night and a pistol the next morning but you brush such trifles from your mind as your footman does powder from your coat  Dor  When I am coward enough to commit suicide it will not be for the loss of money  Lord  L  I love your spirit I know no young fellow who has so much When shall I present the draughts  Dor  Whenever you please Why do you ask that  Lord  L  You remember the sum  Dor  How should I forget  Lord  L  How indeed If it will any way oblige  you I will forbear a day or two I am in no immediate want of cash  Dor  And I am in no immediate want of your forbearance  Lord  L  Nay don't take pet at my being willing to accommodate  Dor  Why should you think I need accommodation  Lord  L  Is it strange that I should wish to oblige my dearest friend  Dor  Yes when your dearest friend has no inclination to be obliged  Lord  L  I am really sincere I have no malice  Dor  Yes you have and I do not like you the worse for it You are a highflavoured sauce a mixture of you is relishing  Lord  L  We all have our uses I the sauce you the turtle  Dor  On which you have the cunning to cut and feed Yet you are no conjuror  Lord  L  Conjurors are scarce I must sly a hundred calls to make I shall see you at dinner Adieu Don't quarrel  Exit  Oli  This dear friend of yours is in full spirits  Dor  I never knew him otherwise A very magpie always hopping and chattering 'Tis a quality I like in him  Oli  Is there any other quality for which you like him  Dor  Yes his frank honest satire  Oli  To torment is his study  Dor  And he is a master of the art a proof of his genius  Oli  He spares neither friend nor foe  Dor  If he did I should despise him What  the heart thinks let the tongue utter Knaves and cowards only fear its freedom  Oli  He has made tolerably free with you  Dor  With all my heart I am fair game and he is a fair sportsman  Oli  Not too much of that He advises me to break with you and offers to dignify me with a coronet  Dor  Ha ha ha There is merit even in his impudence  Oli  And are you not offended with him  Dor  Not in the least  Oli  Do you esteem me so little  Dor  Fie I esteem you so much Your understanding is of too high an order  Oli  To marry him when I may have you  Dor  Yes  Oli  Frank at least  Dor  Certainly I despise hypocrisy Why not as freely speak good of myself when I think it as of another  Oli  Or ill  Dor  Ay or ill I have faults as many as you please but I have something that will hide them all  Oli  Be not too confident A single cloud will conceal the sun  Dor  That is a mistake A few acres I grant may be overcast but his rays at the same instant shine refulgent on the remaining world  Oli  Less poetry and more prudence might perhaps be as well  Dor  Not in your eyes  Oli  You seem very certain  Dor  As I am of my own heart which beats in unison with yours or I never could have admired  never could have loved you as I do I confess your coldness this morning a little surprises me and might alarm were I less acquainted with the justice and the dignity of your mind My last night's follies offend and with reason  Oli  They are indefensible they are degrading and yet comparatively they are trifles  Dor  Indeed  Oli  The loss of wealth only strips vanity of her plumes but the loss of principle covers us with contempt  Dor  Granted  Oli  To preserve our good temper when the profligate and the absurd surround us is as worthy of the sage as the man of the world but to smile approbation to ape their hypocrisy and be the high priest of their nocturnal orgies is to be ambitious of infamy and to renounce the love and the society of the good  Dor  A dreadful sentence  Oli  But inevitable  Dor  Well I am now in haste but in the course of the evening I will call listen to reproof kiss the rod and adore the chastiser  Oli  I may happen not to be at home  Dor  I'll venture that Good morrow  Exit  Oli  This self confidence is insulting Conscious as he is of a dissipated spirit male coquetry and depravity of manners can he so familiarly talk of the unison of our hearts When he is present he fascinates I have but one resource I will avoid him Former affection shall not subject me to future wretchedness Let me be any thing rather than the wife of one whom passion prefers but whom the understanding rejects  Exit  SCENE III  A drawingroom at Dorington's A large company assembled Lord  LAROON  Lady  TAUNTON  Sir  PERTINAX PITIFUL  Major  RAMPART  Mr

approbation for our good deeds and indulgence for our mistakes  Exeunt Omnes  THE END  PROLOGUE  TO whining prone to sighs and sobs and tears  How much is man the creature of his fears  Hence grief and lamentation long have been  The serious subject of the comic scene  Nor knew the hero of the doleful tale  To meet mischance he knew but to bewail  Each wind of heaven some swift destruction brought  The willing slave of every brainsick thought  He hunts for woe For plagues capitulates  And those he cannot find he soon creates  The thousand joys he has are all despised  The toy he cannot get alone is prized  Give him but wealth poor churl he frets and frowns  Take it away poor wretch he hangs or drowns  Pursued by phantoms through life's troubled day  Coward and fool go with him all the way  In conscious rectitude confirmed and bold  Tonight appears a man of different mould  Who meets misfortune fate defies and braves  The rolling thunder and the surging waves  Rides safe among the rocks though tempesttost  Where many a tallbuilt bark lies wrecked and lost  Poetically rides butThought of fear  Should one more hurricane o'ertake him here  Should bursting yells and howls from yonder skies  Bid the wild billows of damnation rise  Courage and skill in vain the storm oppose  He founders in the gulph and down he goes  But should you take the helm and kindly please  To steer with pleasant gales through halcyon seas  The white sails swelling where the zephyrs sport  Sweet will the plaudits be that welcome him to port▪  EPILOGUE  ONCE more I'm sent the Poet's Plenipo'  Your high behest dread Potentates to know  Say mighty Monarchs how shall I begin  Oh that I knew the way your hearts to win  That Critics are unjust is falsely rumour'd  Then smile dear sweet Sir Gruff Do look good humour'd▪  Must Mr Bays go hang himself Declare  Does he deserve damnation and despair  In gratitude return of praise is due  You can't imagine how he praises you  He vows in this most great and wise of ages  That this whole audience are Saints and Sages  Yonder sits Solomon Socrates there  One queu'd and powder'd t'other cropt and bare  This a most sapient Whig that a staunch Tory  Their country's mutual boast Old England's glory  The Greek a student in the school of taste  Who cultivates the arts by which he's grac'd  Sports his halfboots buttons his halfgreat coat  And props his chin with woolpack round his throat  With bludgeon arm'd to knock down those that laugh  He sallies forththe Bear and ragged staff  The JewGreat Houndsditch never saw his peer  The cunning Jew with ev'ry wind can veer  "I lend my moneesh 'cause I lofe de Nation  "I join mit all my art to pay taxation  "De Var and Peesh to me be quite all von  "Give me but von goot shlish from dat great loafd  Loan"  Yet do not think proud sirs that we shall own  The genius we admire is yours alone  We claim our share Our taste and wisdom too  Can equal yours so let us have our due  We study the antique Its simple grace  Shines forth in ev'ry form and ev'ry face  Thus Lady Candlewick Sir John just knighted  Prepares for Court Like turkeycock bedighted  With rosy gills red plumage pink and muslin  And scarlet petticoat the sattin rustling  She blazes all abroad As if she came  To set the Presencechamber in a flame  Loaded with dignity and loops and laces  The prototype of  Wenus  and the Graces  Slim as a Porter butt tall as a Drum  With feathers six feet high behold her come  Beefeaters stand abash'd fall back and stare  She waddles on with such a Greek Dutch air  None can dispute her elegance and taste  All must allow my Lady has no waist  Anxious and proud to captivate beholders  Her hips have just join'd issue with her shoulders  I prate too long yet hear me one word more  Shall I defy petition or implore  Great is your pow'r and you know how to use it  None sure would wish would prompt you to abuse it  Our cause is yours to you that cause we trust  If merit you perceive you'll be to merit just
