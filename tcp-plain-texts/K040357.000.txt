EDINBURGH  M DCC LXXVI  THE ART OF RISING ON THE STAGE  CANTO I  TO grace the elbowchair of age  ROSCIUS the monarch of the stage  For ROSCIUS was in years well stricken  Besides that he began to thicken  Resolv'd to lay the sceptre down  And make his exit from the town  To this intent he summon'd strait  The lords and commons of his state  A motley tribe as you should see  A theatre's variety  From Madam YATES to COLUMBINE  He summon'd them exact at nine  Exact at nine the parties came  Some known to famine some to fame  In the same room for once they met  The tragic ladies took their seat  The little folks were on the scout  And fairly wish'd themselves without  The gentlemen stroll'd here and there  Till ROSCIUS came and took the chair  Then stood in attitude profound  And thus address'd the circle round  "MY subjects and my friends adieu  I now am come to part with you  Full forty years in various places  Have I alas been making faces  During which timeas you can tell  Much have I talk'd of heaven and hell  Myself have stabb'd through every part  And often given away my heart  Imaginary crimes committed  Been hated scorn'd admir'd and pitied  My father strangled kill'd my brother  And play'd the devil with my mother  To day a fool to morrow wiser  A monarch manager and miser  Ten thousand times this hand has press'd  In mimic agony my breast  I've died for love and rose again  On purpose to repeat my pain  At once I've stabb'd both man and maid  And now and then a tyrant play'd  Not Sir JOHN HILL so much has wrote  As I have spoken through my throat  'Tis true indeed we all rehearse  Each year a waggon load of verse  I when the poet lost his gift  Have kindly given the man a lift  When poets weighty matters cobble  And their gall'd jades begin to hobble  The player doctors up their feet  And makes them seem both sound and fleet  This have I donewith your assistance  Tho' sometimes we scarce sav'd our distance  Bards now a days would lose the race  If players did not mend their pace  So apt their hackneys are to trip  That did we not work spur and whip  Scarce is there one among them all  But would ere course the second fall  To tell you then my serious wish  I'm tir'd of this poetic dish  So mean to bid farewel to verse  And live upon my prose and purse  I'm on the edges of threescore  'Tis really time to give it o'er  I need not counterfeit a wrinkle  Beholdit strikes you in a twinkle  The step of sixty as I stir  You see 'tis downright angular I  I'm now unfit for rant and riot  And so determine to be quiet  No more will I the PROTEUS play  But choose henceforth the private way  Nay Mr KING you need not stare  I am in earnest  now  I swear  As player manager and poet  "I've done some service and you know it"  I've had my struggles like the moor  A time there was when I was poor  Now farewel hairbreadth 'scapes and slavings  Hailthree times hailmy little savings  I never coveted such stuff  But will retire with just enough  To line the evening couch with down  And keep a cottage out of town  My homely Hampton hut I mean  Altho' a plain a pleasant scene  A palace ill befitteth age  Mine is the season to be sage  And that's another reason why  I lay this bustling business by  Altho' of actors I am king  The hour alas is on the wing  When I and real monarchs must  Lay all our royalties in dust  I now an  awful  part should act  And fable must give way to fact  You see my purpose and my plan  No more the player but the man  THEN friends farewel but ere I quit  These well known scenes of sense and wit  These everhonour'd sacred boards  Where such a levee grand of lords  Where kings and queens so oft have stood  And diedwith little loss of blood  Where conquerors of every clime  Have night by night harangued in rhime  Where by the aid of good blank verse  Stout heroes have improved their curse  Where dukes of every sort and size  Have complimented ladies eyes  Where chiefs have fought their country's cause  And statesmen made and unmade laws  Where countesses have drain'd the bowl  Or stabb'd the form to save the soul  While virgins rather than submit  Their pretty panting hearts have hit  Where all of  us  have had our blows  Our sieges battles joys and woes  Ah friendsI cannot leave this place  Till I have given my last embrace  My eyes will linger to this spot  Till you my last advice have got  FRIENDS ours is oft a dangerous trade  Take then a recipe I've made  I've tried its efficacy long  Mind and apply it to the tongue  The legs and arms must claim a part  I've mixt it up with wondrous art  'Twill move the soul and mend each feature  I'm told there's not the like in nature  And as a mark 'twill bear the test  Me  it hath made  Probatum est  Take first a wellsiz'd LOOKINGGLASS  "And view your shadow as you pass"  Mark every motion of the eye  And learn at will to laugh and cry  Observe to step and start with grace  And call up meaning in the face  Walk not too narrow nor too wide  'Tis like Sir Punch to strut and stride  As bad it is to jerk and run  Pray  ladies  copy ABINGTON  Observe the breeding in her air  There's nothing of the actress there  Assume her fashion if you can  And catch the graces of her fan  Learn in the mirror how to stare  To smile in joy to droop in care  With ease to hectorit or sinit  And be the PROTEUS of the minute  From gloomy shift to the serene  And learn to methodise your mien  In drawing off a glove I'll tell  Whether a woman is bred well  In tieing on a solitaire  Or in the tender of a chair  Or managing the limbs below  I know whate'er a man can do  I prithee never  pause  too long  A trick I got when I was young  A trick my enemies have told  But habits seldom leave the old  The glass may teach to bow and kneel  But  heaven  alone can make you  feel  From that fair fount the truth must flow  Yet art can make a shift you know  I've found it frequently supply  The want of sensibility  But then 'twill take up all your leisure  Ere you can make such toil a pleasure  For where dame Nature is unkind  And scarcely half makes up the mind  While Fortune like a scurvy jade  Tosses that mind upon our trade  It follows as a clear effect  That notwithstanding such neglect  If Nature will not do her part  The business must be done by  art  In stageaffairs as in a watch  There's many a wheel and many a catch  In both the mechanism's fine  Your lookerson can ne'er divine  What a mere juggle 'tis to play  And yet this juggle  does  I say  Who only views the watch's face  Conceive not what's within the case  Enough for them if truth it tell  And bids SUE roast the mutton well  The fine machinery they miss  As 'tis in that so 'tis in this  I would not have you then despair  Tho' Nature should her blessings spare  Tho' some of you should feel no more  Than DUNSTAN'S giants o'er church door  Sheer art may move a man about  And who's to find the secret out  Take heed 'twill seem all skill and knowledge  Might pose the fellow of a college  Have you not seen in LEAR and FOOL  Where players often rave by rule  The calling outa mouse a mouse  Has fairly  taken in  the house  If well the changeling throws his hat  Make sure of your applause for that  One minute marks a start at most  But if on entrance of a ghost  You stamp but loud enough and six  Instead of one you may take six  'Twere well indeed if when  it's  come  With dext'rous dash of hand or thumb  You caus'd the hair to stand an end  As that would much the horror mend  When HAMLET's phantom you pursue  Gaze as if every lamp burnt blue  But when its errand you would know  Take care to stagger as you go  Then as it waves you not to vex it  Let the sword tremble in your exit  To make King RICHARD there's a knack  Be perfect in the leg and back  The eyebrow should be broad and dark  And give to murder every mark  His fell complottings and designs  Should startle in the face's lines  Give him the dark assassin's airs  And catch the audience unawares  Much much dear folks depends on dress  The seemly ruff of royal BESS  The flourish when she gives the blow  The royal train and furbelow  The thundering boast of blustering PIERRE  The strawmade crown of crazy LEAR  OTHELLO's face OPHELIA's willow  And DESDRMONA's strangling pillow  Your  hose ye fair when boys you play  White chins when age is in decay  Fat FALSTAFF's shield and mountain belly  Are half the battle let me tell ye  If once the galleries give the hand  A fig for those that understand  The men of taste you know are rare  The boxes seldom heed the player  Mind not the critic's  hiss  at flaws  'Tis buried in the fool's applause  Is genius wantingtrust to trick  'Twill prove the actor's walkingstick  There are who use it every year  Tho' none of my good people here  But where true taste is given escape  That which will make you play the ape  Where there is geniusin such cases  The passions know their proper places  Just where they ought behold them rise  Or flow in tears or heave in sighs  They animate the brightest jest  And mighty nature stands confest  What therefore I remark'd at first  Was putting matters at the worst  As providence bestow'd the power  I ne'er could bear  finesse  an hour  My ARCHER is your comic sample  And LEAR affords a grave example  Of other points there are a few  That I will now reveal to you  And first it would not be amiss  But here and there prevent a hiss  If some of you would condescend  A certain  careless  air to mend  'Tis villainous to search the pit  To find where your admirers sit  Nor is it right to stare on  high  Intrigueing with the gallery  Or to the boxes give your eyes  While on the stage a lady sighs  Believe me there is much to  play  Ev'n when you have no more to  say  Some at the close of every speech  Will saucy turn upon their breech  Dear ladies pray forgive the word  But faith the custom's more absurd  Never conclude your business past  Till act the fifth and line the last  Oft have I been the friend in danger  When him I lov'd stood like a stranger  And tho' next scene I was to die  By draught or dart or sympathy  For broken hearts with  us  are common  I've often crack'd a cord for woman  The fellow was so lost to feeling  I might as well have hugg'd the ceiling  One of his  hands  indeed was near  To take my tributary tear  While other members making love  Were set to trap the nymphs above  Sure gentlemen you'll grant me this  A time to act a time to kiss  Resrain but till the curtain's down  Then Rangerit thro' all the town  BUT really there is no excuse  Where kissing is so much in use  The modern stage is no way slack  In granting you an honest smack  I cannot recollect the play  Where poets do not shew the way  There's scarce a scene of  tragic  bliss  But they have introduc'd a kiss  Or if a  comedy  's their  forte  There's always something of that sort  The drama now however chaste  In tender matters near the waist  Tho' they run round and round the riddle  Girding a zone about the middle  Yet all who deal in deaths and faintings  Our dapsters at  dramatic  paintings  However artfully each draws  O'er sacred parts the virtuous  gauze  There's none so churlish to dispute  The players right to a salute  In times of WYCHERLY indeed  A Man might modestly proceed  Might leave the lips andin a pet  Said YG"Pray sir don't you forget  I wish pure precepts you'd convey  And treat usin a decent way  When  ladies  in the room are sitting  Say is it sitting ROSCIUS"  Fitting  As heaven shall judge me by its laws  I only fight the female cause  My argument will plainly prove  You have a right to claim our love  Whatever characters you play  Or great or little grave or gay  While your dear forms are on the stage  You every motion should engage  And he who turns away his head  The prompterought to strike him dead  There's not a man in the creation  Has for THE SEX such veneration  IT now remains ere I go hence  To thank you for your diligence  Sickness 'tis true will oft disable  Pretended  sickness is a fable  The papers have been full of  this  But I blame nature for each miss  At duty's call you  all  would come  Butthat you could not get from home  Nay you'd have ventur'd in a chair  Had you not fear'dthe evening air  I know a lady's resolution  But who can help her constitution  And had you left your hoods and screens  You might have died behind the scenes  I credit not the idle tale  "She is not sick she does not ail"  I've seldom pry'd for your complaint  Convinc'd you were above a feint  But  sure  of your indisposition  Have often sent you a physician  SOME may have had it much at heart  Because they did not like a  part  Some fair ones have been apt to quarrel  And could not fancy their  apparel  It seems I've too much trimm'd a train  When 'twould have prettier look'd if plain  I have not always pleas'd my beaux  In the division of the cloaths  I have giv'n gold for silver lace  And sometimes sulted ill a face  Complexions differ and stage dresses  Should always match the skan and tresses  But far from me the blame may pass  The fault was inthe LOOKINGGLASS  Ladies indeed it told not truth  Each habit much improv'd your youth  And when you were displeas'd with  me  'Twas I adorn'da deity  PERHAPS a word may be expected  Of Bards who think themselves neglected  It is no easy task to rule  The scribbling tribe and every sool  Who pelts a man with manuscripts  And crowds on him mishapen slips  Things half begot and born in pain  The very Faetus of the brain  Some of you know my windowseat  The piles of paper there you meet  Are but the bastards of the day  From trash that spawn a mushroom play  Abortions sprung from parents poor  That lielike foundlingsat my door  In charity I take them up  Altho' not worth my caudlecup  The sire without dramatic sap  How can the son be rear'd by pap  Yet all I keep a decent time  In ragged swatheingcloaths of rhime  Then beg the fathers to attend  Andtake them to another friend  I'M charg'd with scorning babes of  wit  A charge for which I've answer fit  EXTRACT a moral from a tale  A Grazier once had steers for sale  Horses just broke and heifers grown  Pigs calves and other kine his  own  To market as he went one day  A neighbour stopp'd him on the way  DOBSON said he as you know well  Both how to buy and how to sell  As I must watch today the house  For mother midwife's with my spouse  'Twill be a kindness DOB if you  Will bargain for  my  oxen too  None better knows when beasts are fat  You are a judgeI must say that  The Grazier from pure love to JOHN  Jog'd with the cattle gently on  A mile beyond one THOMAS STAVER  Beg'd with a smile an equal favour  Talk'd of a lameness in his legs  And press'd upon him all his eggs  It was not DOB's denying day  So with his load he trudg'd away  But just as if 'twas ne'er to end  Hard by he saw a  female  friend  She too had met a bad disaster  For which repose would prove a plaister  How much she said would he oblige  If he would take her Friday's cheese  The Grazier though almost weigh'd down  Agreed and toiling went to town  'Twas sultry noon when he got there  And now came on our Grazier's care  Off went his horses to his mind  His heifers did not stay behind  His lambkins bore a market price  His hogs found buyers in a trice  The market then was at a stand  His neighbours' goods remain in hand  He scarcely sold an egg an hour  And night at last began to lower  Longer to stay would be in vain  And so he drove  them  back again  The man with the rheumatic legs  Who was the owner of the eggs  The swain who sent the oxen too  Now on our luckless Grazier flew  They tore his coat they bruis'd his eye  He was at last compell'd to fly  Yet how was the poor man to blame  He would have sold if buyers came  He could not  force  the beef and cheese  The Town was  full  of purchases  The moral is worth every other  Serve first  yourself  and then a brother  To serve a brother  first  is right  Provided  self  gets double by't  But mind that you get  pleasure  too  That sanctifies whate'er you do  Tis past dispute and stands reveal'd  By men of notesee CHESTERFIELD  Authority we have no better  It is the sense of every Letter  For  that  it was I sav'd my gold  For  that  I bought for  that  I sold  My friends I have no more to say  I wish you long to live and play  And when like me you've sav'd a pittance  Make your last bows and cry  acquittance"  THE GREENROOM echoed approbation  And thus broke up the CONVOCATION  END OF THE FIRST CANTO  CANTO II  WHEN mighty resignations come  They're sounded loud by beat of drum  I speak by  trope  conceive me right  Not drums made use of in the fight  But those more general alarms  That summon kingdoms up to arms  Again I strike on  metaphor  These things in rhiming will occur  Sure as guns pop by pulling trigger  Pen but a verse off goes a figure  Altho' our greatest merits lie  Far from such quaint embroidery  True 'tis that young poetic sinners  Who at the trade are but beginners  Find it extremely hard to rein  Th' ideas of the buxom brain  When spirits boil and fancy rages  Then glare and gewgaw gild the pages  IMAGINATION'S in her prime  Who loves to sing in summertime  And hence the stripling poet goes  To compliment the blooming rose  Pours forth his genius in  love  Bedecks the garden grot and grove  Scorns to see things like other men  But with a sort of chymic pen  Hies to the shepherd's fleecy sold  And turns the greasy wool to gold  Hath civil sayings for each flower  First  makes  and then  describes  a bower  Meet such a bardling in your walk  Perchance you find him deep in talk  Or 'neath the branches with a book  Or listening to a lazy brook  For what you readers call a bird  Writers have quite another word  A  plumy songster feather'd friend  If proper name an  a  at end  Not bullfinch goldfinch thrush or chaf  A sweeter softer sound by half  'Tis  Philamela  tells the tale  And not the vulgar  nightingale  'Tis not the  linnet  gives its note  But  Lillinetta  pours her throat  What dull folks call the beetle's flight  Is but the  messenger of night  And when the day is gone to bed  On  Thetis'  lap he lays his head  The poet's eye can see him swim  And  tinge  with  gold  the ocean's brim  Then that which mortals call the dawn  Is open'd by the  ruddy morn  And certain streaks of rising red  Mark where that lady's fingers spread  Lambs are the  types of innocence  Lilies and snow dispute that sense  Nay every leaf on every tree  Affords the bard a  simile  And every tender bud that blows  An  epithet  or  thought  bestows  Now some may thinkJOVE help their heads  It is mere dust a mortal treads  I cannot pity such enough  We authors know 'tis no such stuff  The  velvet carpet  nature gives  She offers it and man receives  Wish you to change the phrase again  'Tis the  green mantle of the plain  'Tis heaven's  own livery silken sod  And by no means a kneaded clod  'Tis  tissue  wove by hands divine  'Tis  all that's fair  and  all that's  fine  BUT to proceedhenceforth the muse  At most shall modest  edging  choose  With her the fairy days are o'er  Content with sense she dares not soar  Leave we such freaks to youngsters green  They're but the sportings of eighteen  The muse alas Who scribbles this  Is now no more a flaunty miss  The fever of her fancy cool  She rhimes and reasons all by rule  THE morning registers of fame  Soon set the city in a flame  A favourite player to retire  Is worse than the alarm of fire  The  ignis fatuus  of the stage  Runs ripe and rapid through the age  And though two mighty nations wait  Upon the councils of the state  Yet like true patriots at the heart  We look when ROSCIUS plays a part  Whate'er's theatrical devour  And give to him th' important hour  The papers told that he resign'd  At this you guess the public mind  Hang all the folks across the main  So ROSCIUS would but act again  Next day the matter was averr'd  Certain the patent was transferr'd  Song sonnet ditty sought the press  And half the town was in distress  The matter scarce abroad had flown  Ere it arriv'd at Helicon  Swift to the muses' laurell'd court  A poet went to make report  For poets be it noted go  On such affairs incognito  And tho' to sceptics it seem odd  In point of speed shall match a god  They stride not ordinary horse  But PEGASUS performs the course  A beast that traverses the air  More fleet than your arabian mare  Thus poets get to Hypocrene  Ere Sunday cits to TURNHAM GREEN  PHOEBUS allows the miracle  And so they ride invisible  Hence 'tis the ponies of PARNASS  All other quadrupedes surpass  The reason's evident the mead  Is consecrated where they feed  The best historians alledge  There's something holy in each hedge  That sacred herbage blooms around  And not a thistle in the ground  A nettle here and there you find  For steeds that are to wit inclin'd  Even then there's honey round the sting  But for a weedthere's no such thing  In vain you look for winter here  'Tis June rich June throughout the year  Hence 'tis that all the coursers' noses  Are perfum'd with parnassian posies  For as the creatures stoop to graze  They biteand fill the mouth with bays  The fillies chiefly choose to eat  The primrose pagle violet  Because this sort of food it seems  Inspires your pretty past'ral themes  On jemmy gentle seet they run  And frisk and frolic in the fun  In short the fields are here so fine  They prove that every blade's divine  Such too is their peculiar force  A bard they make of ass or horse  Certain as wings grace Hermes' cap  Whatever eats and takes a nap  Right good sufficient poets wake  The better if their thirst they slake  At CABALLINE the horses fountain  Which lies on t'other side the mountain  Some fearful fools too tame to blunder  Have set these matters far asunder  The river in BEOTIA placing  And PHOCIS call the spot they graze in  But poet real mule or man  Despises critic's rigid plan  And skip through kingdoms in a minute  Think of a placewhewpassthey're in it  Your bards dramatical shall run  And win the sweepstakes from the sun  In waving of a goose's feather  Shall draw the distant poles together  On wings scarce fledg'd with ease can fly  From CATHARINE street to CASTALY  Then dig the spur add loose the rein  Dine in the Strand and sup in Spain  THESE points premis'd we will not fail  To see who went to tell the tale  Trust me there was no less than seven  Now made a vig'rous push for heaven  DAN ROSCIUS rang'd them in a row  And every one desired to go  Their coursers you'll suppose were there  Pawing to gallop through the air  Reader you'll note that heaven's a phrase  We authors use in different ways  The skies above lay constant claim  And HELICON enjoys the name  Nay what will startle most I know  We give it to the shades below  In short sirs every place of rest  Is heaven because it suits in best  So whatsoever's bad or bitter  Is hell to make the sense compleater  This licence chiefly marks  our  charter  So wonder not at what comes A 'TER  In verse like this the bard's allow'd  A privilege deny'd the crowd  A letter we ne'er mind a pin  But cast it out or keep it in  Odd syllables we cut and clip  And half a word with ease o'erskip  So that at top we put our dashes  The critic heeds not such small flashes  This right prince BUTLER did ordain  And SWIFT confirm'd the act again  DAN PRIOR sign'd it with his hand  A law poetic through the land  Since these so often par'd the line  There's none will cavil sure at mine  Say I clip oft'ner I'm the less  But to returnI shall digress  THE bard who saddled first his steed  Was of a mixt and mongrel breed  His PEGASUS scarce known to fame  Tho' young and mettlesome was lame  One that ne'er won a noble bet  But threw the heel at all he met  In going a dogtrot lie stumbled  Yet snorting restive and ne'er humbled  You'd think its master was a bruiser  I lack a rhimeProceed'twill do sir  Yet was it plump as pad of parson  The beast might serve to bring a  farce on  Indeed he has been known to pray  And written almost half a play  Nay to do justice to the steed  'Tis certain he the news could read  There are who sayyou need not laugh  He actually could  paragraph  The column ken'd with critic eyes  And wrote both question and replies  Howe'er this be he did not fail  To be a  candidate  for the mail  To search too nicely for the reason  Would at this time be out of season  But ROSCIUS thought not fit to send  This courier tho' esteem'd a friend  Rumour declar'dbut she's a hag  That ROSCIUS had long fed his nag  And some were bold enough to swear  This  courier's beast engag'd his care  While blooded horses left to play  Could scarce get either corn or hay  That many a prancer stout and able  Was left to swell at leg in stable  While this queer creature was rubb'd down  And made a fight of for the town  But not to tire you with suggestion  I haste to things beyond a question  Altho' by taking off a cup  Of that same water poets sup  And dining well on heavenly sallads  Might mend our author's knack at  ballads  'Tis clear Sir ROSCIUS did not choose  To dub  him  postman to the MUSE  THE second was a bard obscure  That wanted much a sinecure  The master of a galloway  Exceeding apt to  run away  That lately threw a lady down  Then scamper'd with her thro' the town  Quoth ROSCIUS "It can't be my friend  I might as well an ANDREW send  How am I sure ere you get there  You will not settle in the air  The Tit you ride's a lovely BROWN  But who's to bring the message down"  THE four next candidates were such  As prov'd a little was too much  Your men of FARCE and INTERLUDE  Who teaze the town with trifles crude  Who give their tiny popguns play  To pelt the folly of the day  Whom ROSCIUS artfully employs  To keep the galleriesfrom noise  When tragic heroines in disguise  Are now no  more  to cheat the eyes  When she who lately seem'd a brother  In scene the next turns out a mother  When passions are no more at strife  And the poor man may  own  his wife  Till she puts on her woman weeds  'Tis certain that a  pause  succeeds  And as it takes both time and pain  To make a boy a girl again  'Tis decent that we use  finesse  That each fair lady may undress  Hence ROSCIUS being politic  Engages those same sons of trick  A tribe of low dramatic hacks  To fill the space between the acts  Their sense and taste were nearly even  But all unfit alas for heaven  ON these accounts he call'd a crony  Who kept a very pretty poney  A thing of fashion brisk and neat  And swift of foot altho'  petite  Well he maintain'd a poet's cause  A stickler stout for critic laws  The steed was little but not lazy  The rider dapper as a daisy  With fairy step together they  Had tripp'd to PARIS for a play  Thither each year the pair would prance  To catch the comedy of FRANCE  Him  ROSCIUS deem'd a proper hard  To carry off the messagecard  "Then mount dear GEORGE said he your steed  And pray return to me with speed"  ALTHO" our poet did not race  He deftly went a decent pace  And those who take long journeys know  Your  even  riders fastest go  Thus tho' he did not stretch and tear  He canter'd regularly there  For though a dramatist and fleet  His PEGASUS ohey'd the bit  Some bards full cautious and exact  Are sway'd by ARISTOTLE'S act  Which doth provide in certain cases  Strict edicts upon  times  and  places  To break through which without just reason  Is call'd a  literary treason  Would you with these same laws comply  Thenreverence probability  Aw'd therefore by the sage's plan  Steadily went our little man  Arriv'd he hail'd the sacred spring  Dismounted and address'd the ring  For as it chanc'd the ladies nine  Were after dinner quaffing wine  A basket of ambrosia by  Remain'd to tempt a stranger's eye  Yet ere he laid a finger on  He told them what he came upon  "YE everhonour'd THREE TIMES THREE  I COLEY GEORGE now visit ye  The messenger alas of news  That needs must shock each gentle muse  The facts connected with the matter  Will turn your nectar all to water  And your divine poetic lake  An ordinary puddle make  ROSCIUS old Drury's mighty king  With pain ye maids I tell the tiling  ROSCIUS resolv'd to leave the town  Prepares to quit the scenic crown  Even now he flies he's gone this hour  Unless you interpose your power"  "And who the diadem shall wear"  Cried the sad muses with a stare  All rose confus'd some swore 'twas fable  Some spilt the nectar on the table  Queen TRAGEDY was in despair  The COMIC LADY tore her hair  It chanc'd the GRACES were their guests  And they began to thump their breasts  And though perhaps 'twas only art  Each fair one acted well her part  They topt it sir as they had been  Six summers training for the scene  I'm led to judge it a deceit  At best a modish counterfeit  Because tho' some amongst them had  Sufficient reason to run mad  The poor THALIA well might cry  And her sad sister sob and sigh  Yet really all  the rest  might spare  Their woful looks and fullen air  For those to whimper'twas a whim  He scarce knew them they scarce knew him  And wherefore could the charming GRACES  Distort and spoil their lovely faces  The thing as it appears to me  Is that they wept for  sympathy  For if you criticise you shall  Observe that grief's electrical  When BELVIDERA draws the tear  Beholdthe handkerchiefs appear  At once a thousand noses blow  Till the house echoes with the woe  But markI don't conclude from hence  All feel the pathos of the sense  Or all regard the stage or player  Ev'n though the lovely BARRY'S there  For those who  truly  are distrest  Perhaps the nose shall blow the least  Yet when th' infection touches one  From box to box you see it run  But every heart is not alike  And one woe cannot all folks strike  Where fathers feel  themselves  a LEAR  No doubt the misery's sincere  But she who bride shall be tomorrow  Has no soul then I ween for sorrow  And many a tittering fair you find  So little to distress inclin'd  Ev'n SHAKESPEARE'S scenes could never melt  Yet still you'd swear they really felt  When tender people round you cry  'Tis right to bear them company  Before the face the fan to pull  And vow  'tis passing pitiful  The eye to rub the head to lean  And seemquite soften'd by the scene  THIS clears the conduct of each MUSE  Nor could the GRACES well refuse  When MEL and THA heav'd sighs by dozens  They claim'd the sympathy of cousins  Their beauteous sisters too gave vent  'Twas all a decent compliment  THE news some thought must be a fable  ROSCIUS they said though old was able  The courier must mistake the thing  They'd  send an herald to the king  And have it well confirm'd for sure  The tidings must be premature  The courier said he told the truth  Moreover that a tuneful youth  Who by a certain spanish plot  A wond'rous rich DUENNA got  Who for six singsong months together  Had led the town thro' wind and weather  His tweedledumand dee to hear  And tookthe nation by the ear  That  be  the palace now had bought  The trappings trimmings and what not  That  other  gentlefolks had part  And shar'd the instruments of art  The comic mask and tragic train  The sunshine and the showers of rain  The weeds the witches often danc'd in  With colour'd coat of HARLEQUIN  The sceptres swords and suits of mail  The palace flats the park the jail  The dragons bears and dromedaries  And all the pantomime vagaries  The truncheon targe and trumpet loud  The pasteboard crown and canvass cloud  The thunderspouts and thunder too  With robes of tartar turk and jew  The couches coronets and camps  The stars the moon and all the lamps  The heroes habits whole and torn  And ermine walking dukes have worn  The blazing petticoats and sacks  Which often grac'd princesses backs  In short the whole machinery  And all the trick of tragedy  ENOUGH enough said POMMY here  I see the horrid matter clear  It chiefly touches you and me  It does my dear MELPOMENE  Exclim'd poor THALYlet us fly  Direct to feather'd MERCURY  THIS said the sisters instant went  To MAIA in the firmament  Their golden pinions beat the wind  the little herald stay'd behind  Long'd with the rest to hold converse  But thought it right to talk in verse  He told the fate of EPICOENE  Yet did not give the nymphs the SPLEEN  A CONNOISSEUR the bard they found  So many a civil thing went round  And after much dramatic chat  They stuck a laurel in his hat  Then as the nectar 'gan to rise  Which they get coustant from the skies  For from OLYMPUS to PARNASS  It is with them an easy pass  Each lady freely spoke her mind  And didwhat by and by you'll find  READER 'twould sacriligious look  At the mere fag end of a book  These sacred matters to rehearse  Which figure in our future verse  When great affairs approach we pause  This is amongst your  epic  laws  Important points demand parade  And to grace these we CANTOS made  END OF THE SECOND CANTO  CANTO III  UPON a Card as white as snow  Fairer than message cards below  Fairer than those on which the belle  Sends by her Hermes to PALLMALL  The modish message of the day  To make a party for the play  Or fix the hour of dear quadrille  That not a moment may stand still  The MUSES sign'd a soft address  Which COLEY carried off express  THE MUSES TO ROSCIUS  WHILE MEL and THA are gone to heaven  We your admirers sisters seven  Send this to beg you may not sell  Till he who buys can act as well  But  such  a bidder when you find  Pray let us hear that you've resign'd  Consent we have a right to claim  Obey and trust to us your fame  From each a  compliment  receive  And cherish what the MUSES give  I CLIO in the immortal page  Will bid you live thro' every age  And I CALLIOPE the fair  Will make your  harmony  my care  Your various powers of voice record  And tell the music of each word  ERATO and TERPSICHORE  Your  dancing  and your  poetry  Ours it shall oft be to rehearse  Your knack at epilogue and verse  PHOEBUS neglects the epigram  And sounds the trump of EPIC fame  The gentle sallies of a morning  His godship trusts to our adorning  EUTERPE though you seldom sing  Pays you the honours of a king  I POLYHYMN your  memory  love  URANIA marks the whole above  She with a sunbeam writes your name  And consecrates the word to fame  And we the sister GRACES vow  Not to forget your  air  and  bow  Given at our court PARNASSUS mountain  By usPrincesses of the fountain  By us your friends the MUSES seven  While THA and MEL are gone to heaven  OUR poet now his hobby strode  And briskly took the London road  But ere he came to DRURYLANE  THALIA press'd the OLYMPIAN plain  For as no turnpikes tax the  air  The sisters presently were there  When on the earth we go 'tis gravel  But debonair to heav'n you travel  The path is cut thro' aether clear  A mild and milky atmosphere  And as you reach the realms of day  There's not a pebble in the way  When once you get beyond the sun  So smooth and rapidly you run  All is so gentle fair and even  You glide on featherbeds to heaven  Hence VENUS with a thousand LOVES  Yokes but a  single pair  of doves  Which manag'd with a silken rein  Skim up and down the rich domain  CUPID to fly beside her chooses  A brace of peacocks JUNO uses  And as 'tis all an easy flight  Their chariots are exceeding light  MERCURIUS summon'd by the MUSE  Flew to ELISIUM with the news  And lighting on the  poets'  Walk  The circle found in various talk  SHAKESPEARE majestic in his mien  Superior to the rest was seen  " HYPERION'S curls the front of JOVE  An eye like MARS" the lip of LOVE  Mark'd  him  from all the lofty band  A laurel wreath was in his hand  A wreath by all the MUSES wove  Where each in rival emblems strove  A tribe of Grecians view'd his grace  With all the Romans of the place  The fathers of th' ATHENIAN stage  Poets sublime of every age  VIRGIL stood gazing on his face  "The characters of truth to trace"  Sagacious PLATO with surprize  Saw inspiration in his eyes  The pierceing SOPHOCLES was struck  At rays of glory in his look  Ev'n ARISTOTLE bent the knees  And half forgot his  unities  HOMER himself to fight restor'd  Embrac'd him as an equal lord  APOLLOWho that day was there  Proclaim'd the bard his favourite care  JOHNSON was near in learned state  Severe in look in step sedate  Much circumspection in his air  With all an anxious scholar's care  BEAUMONT and FLETCHER  The TUNEFUL TWINS together sat  Like brotherbards in friendly chat  THOMSON on beds of roses laid  Was twisting chaplets in the shade  His harp to heavenly subjects strung  Bespoke the hand of solemn YOUNG  The gentle OTWAY press'd the green  Still sovereign of the tender scene  An angelaudience own'd his sway  From polish'd ROWE to pleasing GAY  MILTON whom all with reverence view  POSSEST the scenes that once he DREW  Known by his gait and sounding lyre  Poor LEE was there with eye of fire  Hurrying he went from grove to grove  And ranted rage or sung of love  ANOTHER part adorn'd with bowers  Contain'd THALIA'S lively powers  HORACE appear'd as king of wit  And SWIFT maintain'd a regal seat  Of playhouse bards a numerous train  Were still disputing who should reign  The brilliant stroke the satire smart  And keen retort around they dart  Even here they seem'd to hate a brother  And tore the laurel from each other  Old WYCHERLY assum'd the head  But matchless DRYDEN took the lead  Whene'er the mighty poet sung  The paradise responsive rung  Ev'n PHILLIP'S godlike son to hear  Would list'ning lean upon his spear  And sooth'd by sound even yet was vain  Then sigh'd to have his ODE again  Who in his lifetime affected to despise a literary reputation  CONGREVE now thought it no disgrace  But wore a smile upon his face  And yet I've heard would now and then  Say a soft thing to Mrs BEHN  The bard could ne'er his  forte  forget  But lov'd to joke about it yet  The courtly VANBRUGH too was near  And CIBBER whispering in his ear  With many a merry bard beside  THALIA'S honour boast and pride  SIR MERCURY now spoke aloud  But settled first his wings and bow'd  His message told with godlike grace  And beg'd their judgment on the case  He added too that Mrs THA  Had not once smil'd since dawn of day  That Madam MEL was still in tears  And might be so these twenty years  Unless their poetships could rule  Friend ROSCIUS still to play the fool  He thought that ROSCIUS should agree  For sake of all stage poesy  To act one more theatric session  " HERMES you're rightI say  possession  Cried SHAKESPEARE loud and while he spoke  No other bard the accents broke  Is all to perish then of mine  Must SHAKESPEARE be no more divine  Tho' fame may  here  her clarion blow  Pray who must manage it below "  He saidELYSIUM heard the sound  And all its tenants throng'd around  The story in a moment flew  Till every bard the matter knew  One told the tydings to another  Till SOL himself was in a pother  ELYSIUM reader is a name  Not only for  these  sons of fame  But a  fine  place by JOVE ordain'd  For  all  who've figur'd fought or reign'd  'Tis for the wise the great the fair  And every constant lover's there  It is in short for all the good  When they have done with flesh and blood  And yet the beauty when a ghost  There as on earth remains a toast  Th' Elysians to her charms pay court  And  amorous shadows  round her sport  The human shape we sure retain  Else could sons know their sires again  Now strange as this may seem to you  AENEAS found it vastly true  Who as DAN VIRGIL'S legends go  Once took a pious trip below  Walk'd round the charming garden twice  And own'd ANCHISES in a trice  Made without toil th' important tour  And got to earth within the hour  THE characters that ROSCIUS  play'd  Were now assembledto a shade  Poor BENEDICT began to stare  And tho' 'tis odd how he got there  MACBETH protested he was  glad  ROSCIUS  too oft'  had made him mad  His crimes so painted to the life  AsPRITCHARD us'd to paint his wife  The pensive HAMLET smote his breast  And on poor YORRICK'S shoulder press'd  Even DRUGGER seem'd to feel the blow  Then took a quid to ease his woe  OTHELLO little seem'd to care  And JAFFIER was not in despair  Yet royal LEAR sustain'd the stroke  Tho' BARRYat the  bottom  broke  If all were well as 'tis  above  That form that face might well improve  My scenes said LEEah ALEXANDER  That BARRY was a better  stander  Then might'st  thou  still unrivall'd run  And claim alliance with the sun  ZANGA  An hero of the MOORISH race  Had a  The late Mr MOSSOP  new  guest in his embrace  Near whom the stately WOLSEY stood  To give him welcome from the flood  Even  A name given to CORROLIANUS whose character was finely represented by Mr MOSSOP  CAIIUS MARCIUS hail'd his friend  And PIERRE was eager to attend  CATO to grieve saw little cause  SHERIDAN gives  his  senate laws  But princely JOHN declin'd the head  And wish'd that SHERIDAN was dead  Then dropt a tear and hid his face  As conscious still of his disgrace  RANGER with nectar almost mellow  SWORE ROSCIUS was a noble fellow  Then turning to unfriended  Amongst the Parts of Mr SHUTER  STEPHEN  Wish'd NED and DAVY both in heaven  THE multitude now talk'd so fast  The matter was so like to last  So little hope remain'd of hearing  Sir HERMES spread his wings for steering  When SHAKESPEARE thus preferr'd his prayer  To HIM who darts his rays from far  " I see I feel the tempest brewing  Dark o'er my stage impends the ruin  Let me to earth a ramble take  And I will expedition make  Thou bearer of the brilliant bow  This favour on thy bard bestow "  DEAR SHAKESPEARE thy request is odd  Replied the silvershafted god  And yet I know not to deny  Then here good friend said MERCURY  This winged cap I'll lend to thee  A flying foot will do for me  So short the way is to the king  One might go there with half a wing  CONSENT thus gain'd and full in feather  The bard and HERMES flew together  As friendly towards earth they went  To see what these strange tidings meant  They freely chatted on the road  And SHAKESPEARE thus bespoke the god  " HERMES no toil that man engages  Not making verses to make pages  Not all the logic of the laws  Nor knot that ties the gordian cause  Not all the navigator's art  Nor even the warrior's wily part  Not methodistical devotion  Nor secret of perpetual motion  Not the dull road to classic knowledge  Nor humdrum labours of a college  Not the fierce spirit of debate  That works the whirligig of state  Nor jarring jargon of physician  Not science of geometrician  Not fluxions fractions or finance  Not both on heel and head to dance  Not Coptic Algebra or Erse  Not dignity without a purse  Nor ought on earth such talents ask  Such powers as the  theatric task  At once to move and mend the heart  A master of the Thespian art  For even I with all my boast  Was deem'd unfit to make a ghost  Yet HERMES I could scribble things  As easy as you work your wings  Could very decent dukes create  And make a minister of state  Dubb one a  lord  a second  sir  And half compleat a character  Sooner than get that phantom's talk  Or e'en be perfect in my  stalk  It is not  acting  to rehearse  Some hundred lines of florid verse  It is not  comedy  to frisk  To trip to titter and look brisk  The wood and wire can dance and caper  A very mountebank can vapour  It is not  tragedy  to roar  And flounce the body on the floor  Then to spring upward with a bound  And cast the goggling eyeballs round  To writhe the joints or shake the head  Then quiver and burlesque the dead  It is not  tragedy  to pout  Or in a fume to jump about  To slap the forehead thump the chest  And screw the face to seem distrest  Nor sweat an hour upon the stage  Or twich the mantle in a rage  Hence I infer my worthy friend  Nature peculiar gifts must lend  And after all her favours Care  And Industry must make the player"  Quoth MERCURY " my noble poet  You're a great man and often shew it  But now you miss the matter quite  Since you dear WILL began to write  Affairs have had a modern turn  Actors have little now to learn  The deuce a difficulty in it  The hocuspocus of a minute  At least the folks who teach to speak  Dispatch a dozen in a week  ROSCIUS indeed and three or four  Haply thro' BRITAIN half a score  The subject study as a science  The rest to study bid defiance  He who is to the stage inclin'd  Tells to Sir Manager his mind  "To be or not to be"  rehearses  And tries his compass in the  curses  His bosom beats with tragic rage  And so he jumps upon the stage  A time he takes to con his part  Since he must get the words by heart  His leisure at the GLASS employs  And scares the landlady with noise  Then all in rubric capitals  He flames resplendent on the walls  At every corner of the street  The new  young gentleman  you meet  And that he may the better bellow  Sometimes he chooses your OTHELLO  Changes his face to Moorish black  Or else a bunch upon his back  He aims at grin and glare and posture  And takes a tug of Master GLOSTER  At length upon a solemn night  The hero is to fume and fight  In Romish triumph lo he comes  And stalks to the tattoo of drums  He never play'd the king before  And haply ne'er shall play it more  Observe him the succeeding eve  With a vile livery on his sleeve  Sunk to the servant's lowest place  Yet mean enough to bear disgrace  But if his lungs the task sustain  He plays the character again  The strange attraction casts around  And works his way by  dint of sound  The papers circulate the puff  He is a diamond in the rough  And by the force of mighty jaws  He storms awhile and wins applause  Now with success quite feverish grown  He'll have a playhouse of his own  The manager and actor join  And then he fills the hero's line  Afar he travels on the hoof  His theatre without a roof  In a vile barn he butchers LEAR  And stabbs the regimental'd PIERRE  But ev'n if all his toils succeed  Prithee dear WILLIAM mark the meed  Full oft he bustles half the night  Yet scarcely gets a supper by't  On thy fine thoughts he feeds by day  The  famish'd sovereign  of a play  The vagrant hut rewards his pains  And the world frowns upon his gains  Not pedlar gipsy jesuit  Not balladwenches in the street  Not base buffoon on scaffolding  Not bullock baited at the ring  Nor beggar dieting at door  Nor the chance children of the poor  A lot so hard "I prithee stop  Return'd the bardthe subject drop  For if their private life be good  Blest they may be whate'er their food  "The ship boy on the giddy mast"  My worthy BILLY not so fast  Said MAIA'S sonPhilosophy  Is a fine thing when plenty's nigh  As to their  goodness  I confess  They are the types of holiness  Tho' I sometimes pass to and fro  I hear no trips where'er I go  So much to deal in sentiment  Inspires pure love esteem content  Tho' grocers will their figs neglect  Actors will noble thoughts respect  And hence it is the real player  Will live on virtue and the air  To no one ill is he inclin'd  Unspotted both in form and mind  To do the  ladies  right their dress  Even in a  morn  is cleanliness  So spruce you at a glance would swear  In every pin you saw the player  With rumpled cap and towzled head  They never breakfast on the bed  But as at night they love parade  At day each fair shall match a maid  In short the heroines of the scene  Are full as  chaste  as they are  clean  HERE HERMES paus'd and rubb'd his eye  And why friend MERCURY so sly  Rejoin'd the poetin these days  Actors I hear get pence and praise  Fashion it seems hath chang'd her plan  TOWNPLAYER is a GENTLEMAN  And surely men of art and sense  Have justly to the name pretence  But as I scent the city smoak  Prithee good HERMES spare thy joke  And if thou lov'st me quickly say  Should ROSCIUS go who's left to play  For since I've been a ghost my friend  I little to such points attend  'TIS long quoth HERMES Sir since I  To either house have had a fly  There's little call for you or me  The news you'll hear from POMINB  There's SHERIDAN the old and young  One fam'd for  speech  and one for  song  But ah dear WILL alack aday  'Tis all to sing and nought to say  His airs full seventy nights have run  And yet the game is just begun  Why Sir I'm told this wicked elf  Has thrown your lordship on the shelf  In vain you growl forth list oh list  Your favorite phantom is not mist  And when the mob resign  their ghost  Judge how much footing you have lost  Uncall'd old BARRY limps about  Gets a long sabbath for his gout  And 'tis with much ado I hear  His wife can draw one tragic tear  Methinks the age is  operatiz'd  SWEET WILLYyou seem much surpriz'd  HERMES stopt shortthe poet frown'd  And tore the bays his temples bound  The chaplet thrice indignant shook  Tost it air then angry spoke  "ROSCIUS resign'd why had he stay'd  I would go forward to upbraid  Oh had I known what SHAKESPEARE wrote  Would fly before the sidler's note  By yonderbut I will not swear  Why didst thou lead me on thus far  HERMES your handdear friend adieu"  He turn'd about and backward flew  THE God of errands left alone  Now bent his course towards HELICON  Told every MUSE th' appeal was vain  And in a huff sought heaven again  THE END
