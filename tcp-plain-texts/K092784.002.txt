ECLOGUES  I UNCERTAINTY To Mr  POPE  II HOPE To the Hon  GEORGE DODDINGTON  Esq  III JEALOUSY To  ED WALPOLE  Esq  IV POSSESSION To the Right Hon the Lord Visc  COBHAM  THE PROGRESS of LOVE IN Four ECLOGUES  UNCERTAINTY ECLOGUE I  To Mr POPE  POPE to whose reed beneath the beechen shade  The nymphs of Thames a pleas'd attention paid  While yet thy muse content with humbler praise  Warbled in Windsor's grove her sylvan lays  Though now sublimely borne on Homer's wing  Of glorious wars and godlike cheifs she sing  Wilt thou with me revisit once again  The crystal fountain and the flow'ry plain  Wilt thou indulgent hear my verse relate  The various changes of a lover's state  And while each turn of passion I pursue  Ask thy own heart if what I tell be true  To the green margin of a lonely wood  Whose pendant shades o'erlook'd a silver flood  Young Damon came unknowing where he stray'd  Full of the image of his beauteous maid  His flock far off unfed untended lay  To every savage a defenceless prey  No sense of int'rest cou'd their master move  And every care seem'd trifling now but Love  A while in pensive silence he remain'd  But tho' his voice was mute his looks complain'd  At length the thoughts within his bosom pent  Forc'd his unwilling tongue to give them vent  Ye Nymphs he cry'd ye Dryads who so long  Have favour'd Damon and inspir'd his song  For whom retir'd I shun the gay resorts  Of sportful cities and of pompous courts  In vain I bid the restless world adieu  To seek tranquillity and peace with you  Tho' wild Ambition and destructive Rage  No Factions here can form no Wars can wage  Tho' Envy frowns not on your humble shades  Nor Calumny your innocence invades  Yet cruel Love that troubler of the breast  Too often violates your boasted rest  With inbred storms disturbs your calm retreat  And taints with bitterness each rural sweet  Ah luckless day when first with fond surprize  On Delia's face I fix'd my eager eyes  Then in wild tumults all my soul was tost  Then reason liberty at once were lost  And every wish and thought and care was gone  But what my heart employ'd on her alone  Then too she smil'd Can smiles our peace destroy  Those lovely children of Content and Joy  How can soft pleasure and tormenting woe  From the same spring at the same moment flow  Unhappy boy these vain enquiries cease  Thought cou'd not guard nor will restore thy peace  Indulge the frenzy that thou must endure  And sooth the pain thou know'st not how to cure  Come flatt'ring Memory and tell my heart  How kind she was and with what pleasing art  She strove its fondest wishes to obtain  Confirm her pow'r and faster bind my chain  If on the green we danc'd a mirthful band  To me alone she gave her willing hand  Her partial taste if e'er I touch'd the lyre  Still in my song found something to admire  By none but her my crook with flow'rs was crown'd  By none but her my brows with ivy bound  The world that Damon was her choice believ'd  The world alas like Damon was deceiv'd  When last I saw her and declar'd my fire  In words as soft as passion cou'd inspire  Coldly she hear'd and full of scorn withdrew  Without one pitying glance one sweet adieu  The frighted hind who sees his ripen'd corn  Up from the roots by sudden tempests torn  Whose fairest hopes destroy'd and blasted lie  Feels not so keen a pang of grief as I  Ah how have I deserv'd inhuman maid  To have my faithful service thus repay'd  Were all the marks of kindness I receiv'd  But dreams of joy that charm'd me and deceiv'd  Or did you only nurse my growing love  That with more pain I might your hatred prove  Sure guilty treachery no place cou'd find  In such a gentle such a gen'rous mind  A maid brought up the woods and wilds among  Cou'd ne'er have learnt the art of courts so young  No let me rather think her anger feign'd  Still let me hope my Delia may be gain'd  'Twas only modesty that seem'd disdain  And her heart suffer'd when she gave me pain  Pleas'd with this flatt'ring thought the lovesick boy  Felt the faint dawning of a doubtful joy  Back to his flock more chearful he return'd  When now the setting sun less fiercely burn'd  Blue vapours rose along the mazy rills  And light's last blushes ting'd the distant hills  HOPE ECLOGUE II  To Mr DODDINGTON  HEar DODDINGTON the notes that shepherds sing  Notes soft as those of nightingales in spring  Nor Pan nor Phoebus tune the shepherd's reed  From Love alone our tender lays proceed  Love warms our fancy with enliv'ning fires  Refines our genius and our verse inspires  From him Theocritus on Enna's plains  Learnt the wild sweetness of his Doric strains  Virgil by him was taught the moving art  That charm'd each ear and soften'd every heart  O wouldst thou quit the pride of courts and deign  To dwell with us upon the vocal plain  Thee too his pow'r should reach and ev'ry shade  Resound the praises of thy fav'rite maid  Thy pipe our rural concert wou'd improve  And we shou'd learn of thee to please and love  Damon no longer sought the silent shade  No more in unfrequented paths he stray'd  But call'd the nymphs to hear his jocund song  And told his joy to all the rustick throng  Blest be the hour he said that happy hour  When first I own'd my Delia's gentle pow'r  Then gloomy discontent and pining care  Forsook my breast and left soft wishes there  Soft wishes there they left and gay desires  Delightful languors and transporting fires  Where yonder limes combine to form a shade  These eyes first gaz'd upon the charming maid  There she appear'd on that auspicious day  When swains their sportive rites to Bacchus pay  She led the danceheav'ns with what grace she mov'd  Who cou'd have seen her then and not have lov'd  I strove not to resist so sweet a flame  But glory'd in a happy captive's name  Nor wou'd I now cou'd Love permit be free  But leave to brutes their savage liberty  And art thou then fond swain secure of joy  Can no reverse thy flatt'ring bliss destroy  Has treacherous Love no torment yet in store  Or hast thou never prov'd his fatal pow'r  Whence flow'd those tears that late bedew'd thy cheek  Why sigh'd thy heart as if it strove to break  Why were the desart rocks invok'd to hear  The plaintive accent of thy sad despair  From Delia's rigour all those pains arose  Delia who now compassionates my woes  Who bids me Hope and in that charming word  Has peace and transport to my soul restor'd  Begin my pipe begin the gladsome lay  A kiss from Delia shall thy musick pay  A kiss obtain'd 'twixt struggling and consent  Giv'n with forc'd anger and disguis'd content  No laureat wreaths I ask to bind my brows  Such as the muse on lofty bards bestows  Let other swains to praise or fame aspire  I from her lips my recompence require  Hark how the bees with murmurs fill the plain  While ev'ry flower of every sweet they drain  See how beneath you hillock's shady steep  The shelter'd herds on flow'ry couches sleep  Nor bees nor herds are half so blest as I  If with my fond desires my Love comply  From Delia's lips a sweeter honey flows  And on her bosom dwells more soft repose  Ah how my dear shall I deserve thy charms  What gift can bribe thee to my longing arms  A bird for thee in silken bands I hold  Whose yellow plumage shines like polish'd gold  From distant isles the lovely stranger came  And bears the fortunate Canaries name  In all our woods none boasts so sweet a note  Not ev'n the nightingale's melodious throat  Accept of this and cou'd I add beside  What wealth the rich Peruvian mountains hide  If all the gems in Eastern rocks were mine  On thee alone their glitt'ring pride shou'd shine  But if thy mind no gifts have pow'r to move  Phoebus himself shall leave th' Aonian grove  The tuneful Nine who never sue in vain  Shall come sweet suppliants for their fav'rite swain  For him each blueey'd Naiad of the flood  For him each greenhair'd sister of the wood  Whom oft beneath fair Cynthia's gentle ray  His musick calls to dance the night away  And you fair nymphs companions of my love  With whom she joys the cowslip meads to rove  I beg you recommend my faithful flame  And let her often hear her shepherd's name  Shade all my faults from her enquiring sight  And shew my merits in the fairest light  My pipe your kind assistance shall repay  And every friend shall claim a diff'rent lay  But see in yonder glade the heav'nly fair  Enjoys the fragrance of the breezy air  Ah thither let me fly with eager feet  Adieu my pipe I go my love to meet  O may I find her as we parted last  And may each future hour be like the past  So shall the whitest lamb these pastures feed  Propitious Venus on thy altars bleed  JEALOUSY ECLOGUE III  To Mr EDWARD WALPOLE  THE gods O WALPOLE give no bliss sincere  Wealth is disturb'd by care and pow'r by fear  Of all the passions that employ the mind  In gentle Love the sweetest joys we find  Yet ev'n those joys dire Jealousy molests  And blackens each fair image in our breasts  O may the warmth of thy too tender heart  Ne'er feel the sharpness of his venom'd dart  For thy own quiet think thy mistress just  And wisely take thy happiness on trust  Begin my muse and Damon's woes rehearse  In wildest numbers and disorder'd verse  On a romantick mountain's airy head  While browzing goats at ease around him fed  Anxious he lay with jealous cares oppress'd  Distrust and anger lab'ring in his breast  The vale beneath a pleasing prospect yields  Of verdant meads and cultivated fields  Through these a river rolls its winding flood  Adorn'd with various tufts of rising wood  Here half conceal'd in trees a cottage stands  A castle there the opening plain commands  Beyond a town with glitt'ring spires is crown'd  And distant hills the wide horizon bound  So charming was the scene a while the swain  Beheld delighted and forgot his pain  But soon the stings infix'd within his heart  With cruel force renew'd their raging smart  His flow'ry wreath which long with pride he wore  The gift of Delia from his brows he tore  Then cry'd May all thy charms ungrateful maid  Like these neglected roses droop and fade  May angry heav'n deform each guilty grace  That triumphs now in that deluding face  Those alter'd looks may every shepherd fly  And ev'n thy Daphnis hate thee worse than I  Say thou inconstant what has Damon done  To lose the heart his tedious pains had won  Tell me what charms you in my rival find  Against whose pow'r no ties have strength to bind  Has he like me with long obedience strove  To conquer your disdain and merit love  Has he with transport every smile ador'd  And dy'd with grief at each ungentle word  Ah no the conquest was obtain'd with ease  He pleas'd you by not studying to please  His careless indolence your pride alarm'd  And had he lov'd you more he less had charm'd  O pain to think another shall possess  Those balmy lips which I was wont to press  Another on her panting breast shall lie  And catch sweet madness from her swimming eye  I saw their friendly flocks together feed  I saw them hand in hand walk o'er the mead  Wou'd my clos'd eyes had sunk in endless night  Ere I was doom'd to bear that hateful sight  Where e'er they pass'd be blasted every flow'r  And hungry wolves their helpless flocks devour  Ah wretched swain cou'd no examples move  Thy heedless heart to shun the rage of Love  Hast thou not hear'd how poor  See Mr  Gay's  Dione  Menalcas dy'd  A victim to Parthenia's fatal pride  Dear was the youth to all the tuneful plain  Lov'd by the nymphs by Phoebus lov'd in vain  Around his tomb their tears the muses paid  And all things mourn'd but the relentless maid  Wou'd I cou'd die like him and be at peace  These torments in the quiet grave wou'd cease  There my vex'd thoughts a calm repose wou'd find  And rest as if my Delia still were kind  No let me live her falsehood to upbraid  Some god perhaps my just revenge will aid  Alas what aid fond swain wou'dst thou receive  Cou'd thy heart bear to see its Delia grieve  Protect her heav'n and let her never know  The slightest part of hapless Damon's woe  I ask no vengeance from the pow'rs above  All I implore is never more to love  Let me this fondness from my bosom tear  Let me forget that e'er I thought her fair  Come cool indifference and heal my breast  Wearied at length I seek thy downy rest  No turbulence of passion shall destroy  My future ease with flatt'ring hopes of joy  Hear mighty Pan and all ye Sylvans hear  What by your Guardian deities I swear  No more my eyes shall view her fatal charms  No more I'll court the trait'ress to my arms  Not all her arts my steddy soul shall move  And she shall find that Reason conquers Love  Scarce had he spoke when through the lawn below  Alone he saw the beauteous Delia go  At once transported he forgot his vow  Such perjuries the laughing gods allow  Down the steep hills with ardent haste he flew  He found her kind and soon believ'd her true  POSSESSION ECLOGUE IV  To Lord COBHAM  COBHAM to thee this rural lay I bring  Whose guiding judgment gives me skill to sing  Though far unequal to those polish'd strains  With which thy Congreve charm'd the list'ning plains  Yet shall its musick please thy partial ear  And sooth thy breast with thoughts that once were dear  Recall those years which time has thrown behind  When smiling Love with Honour shar'd thy mind  The sweet remembrance shall thy youth restore  Fancy again shall run past pleasures o'er  And while in Stowe's enchanting walks you stray  This theme may help to cheat the summer's day  Beneath the covert of a myrtle wood  To Venus rais'd a rustick altar stood  To Venus and to Hymen there combin'd  In friendly league to favour humankind  With wanton Cupids in that happy shade  The gentle Virtues and mild Wisdom play'd  Nor there in sprightly Pleasure's genial train  Lurk'd sick Disgust or late repenting Pain  Nor Force nor Interest join'd unwilling hands  But Love consenting ty'd the blissful bands  Thither with glad devotion Damon came  To thank the Pow'rs who bless'd his faithful flame  Two milkwhite doves he on their altar laid  And thus to both his grateful homage paid  Hail bounteous god before whose hallow'd shrine  My Delia vow'd to be for ever mine  While glowing in her cheeks with tender love  Sweet virgin modesty reluctant strove  And hail to thee fair queen of young desires  Long shall my heart preserve thy pleasing fires  Since Delia now can all its warmth return  As fondly languish and as fiercely burn  O the dear gloom of last propitious night  O shade more charming than the fairest light  Then in my arms I clasp'd the melting maid  Then all my pains one moment overpaid  Then first the sweet excess of bliss I prov'd  Which none can taste but who like me have lov'd  Thou too bright goddess once in Ida's grove  Didst not disdain to meet a shepherd's love  With him while frisking lambs around you play'd  Conceal'd you sported in the secret shade  Scarce cou'd Anchises' raptures equal mine  And Delia's beauties only yield to thine  What are you now my once most valued joys  Insipid trifles all and childish toys  Friendship itself ne'er knew a charm like this  Nor Colin's talk cou'd please like Delia's kiss  Ye muses skill'd in every winning art  Teach me more deeply to engage her heart  Ye nymphs to her your freshest roses bring  And crown her with the pride of all the spring  On all her days let health and peace attend  May she ne'er want nor ever lose a friend  May some new pleasure every hour employ  But let her Damon be her highest joy  With thee my love for ever will I stay  All night caress thee and admire all day  In the same field our mingled flocks we'll feed  To the same spring our thirsty heifers lead  Together will we share the harvest toils  Together press the vine's autumnal spoils  Delightful state where peace and love combine  To bid our tranquil days unclouded shine  Here limpid fountains roll through flow'ry meads  Here rising forests lift their verdant heads  Here let me wear my careless life away  And in thy arms insensibly decay  When late old age our heads shall silver o'er  And our slow pulses dance with joy no more  When Time no longer will thy beauties spare  And only Damon's eye shall think thee fair  Then may the gentle hand of welcome death  At one soft stroke deprive us both of breath  May we beneath one common stone be laid  And the same cypress both our ashes shade  Perhaps some friendly muse in tender verse  Shall deign our faithful passion to rehearse  And future ages with just envy mov'd  Be told how Damon and his Delia lov'd  SOLILOQUY Of a BEAUTY in the COUNTRY  Written at  Eton  School  By the Same  'TWas night and FLAVIA to her room retir'd  With ev'ning chat and sober reading tir'd  There melancholy pensive and alone  She meditates on the forsaken town  On her rais'd arm reclin'd her drooping head  She sigh'd and thus in plaintive accents said  "Ah what avails it to be young and fair  "To move with negligence to dress with care  "What worth have all the charms our pride can boast  "If all in envious solitude are lost  "Where none admire 'tis useless to excel  "Where none are Beaus 'tis vain to be a Belle  "Beauty like wit to judges shou'd be shewn  "Both most are valu'd where they best are known  "With ev'ry

"That is our heav'n and we are angels There  "In that gay circle thousand Cupids rove  "The court of Britain is the court of Love  "How has my conscious heart with triumph glow'd  "How have my

tow'rs  Didst to his virtue raise whom oft thy shield  In peril guarded and thy wisdom steer'd  Through all the storms of warThee too I call  Thalia sylvan muse who lov'st to rove  Along the shady paths and verdant bow'rs  Of Woodstock's happy grove there tuning sweet  Thy rural pipe while all the Dryad train  Attentive listen let thy warbling song  Paint with melodious praise the pleasing scene  And equal these to Pindus' honour'd shades  When Europe freed confess'd the saving pow'r  Of MARLE'ROUGH's hand Britain who sent him forth  Chief of confederate hosts to fight the cause  Of Liberty and Justice grateful rais'd  This palace sacred to her leader's fame  A trophy of success with spoils adorn'd  Of conquer'd towns and glorying in the name  Of that auspicious field where CHURCHILL's sword  Vanquish'd the might of Gallia and chastis'd  Rebel BavarMajestick in its strength  Stands the proud dome and speaks its great design  Hail happy chief whose valour could deserve  Reward so glorious grateful nation hail  Who paidst his service with so rich a meed  Which most shall I admire which worthiest praise  The Hero or the People Honour doubts  And weighs their virtues in an equal scale  Not thus Germania pays th' uncancell'd debt  Of gratitude to usBlush Caesar blush  When thou behold'st these tow'rs ingrate to thee  A monument of shame Canst thou forget  Whence they are nam'd and what an English arm  Did for thy throne that day But we disdain  Or to upbraid or imitate thy guilt  Steel thy obdurate heart against the sense  Of obligation infinite and know  Britain like heav'n protects a thankless world  For her own glory nor expects reward  Pleas'd with the noble theme her task the muse  Pursues untir'd and through the palace roves  With evernew delight The Tap'stry rich  With gold and gay with all the beauteous paint  Of various colour'd silks dispos'd with skill  Attracts her curious eye Here Ister rolls  His purple wave and there the Granic flood  With passing squadrons foams here hardy Gaul  Flies from the sword of Britain there to Greece  Effeminate Persia yieldsIn arms oppos'd  MARLB'ROUGH and ALEXANDER vie for fame  With glorious competition equal both  In valour and in fortune but their praise  Be different for with different views they fought  This to  subdue  and That to  free  mankind  Now through the stately portals issuing forth  The muse to softer glories turns and seeks  The woodland shade delighted Not the vale  Of Tempe fam'd in song or Ida's grove  Such beauty boasts Amid the mazy gloom  Of this romantick wilderness once stood  The bow'r of Rosamonda hapless fair  Sacred to grief and love the crystal fount  In which she us'd to bathe her beauteous limbs  Still warbling flows pleas'd to reflect the face  Of SPENSER lovely maid when tir'd she sits  Beside its flow'ry brink and views those charms  Which only Rosamond could once excel  But see where flowing with a nobler stream  A limpid lake of purest waters rolls  Beneath the widestretch'd arch stupendous work  Through which the Danube might collected pour  His spacious urn Silent a while and smooth  The current glides till with an headlong sorce  Broke and disorder'd down the steep it falls  In loud cascades the silversparkling foam  Glitters relucent in the dancing ray  In these retreats repos'd the mighty soul  Of CHURCHILL from the toils of war and state  Splendidly private and the tranquil joy  Of contemplation felt while BLENHEIM's dome  Triumphal ever in his mind renew'd  The mem'ry of his fame and sooth'd his thoughts  With pleasing record of his glorious deeds  So by the rage of faction home recall'd  Lucullus while he wag'd successful war  Against the pride of Asia and the pow'r  Of Mithridates whose aspiring mind  No losses

MARLBRO' peaceful dwelt Indulgent heav'n  Gave a companion to his softer hours  With whom conversing he forgot all change  Of fortune or of taste and in her mind  Found greatness equal to his own and lov'd  Himself in herThus each by each admir'd  In mutual honour mutual fondness join'd  Like two fair stars with intermingled light  In friendly union they together shone  Aiding each other's brightness till the cloud  Of night eternal quench'd the beams of one  Thee CHURCHILL first the ruthless hand so death  Tore from thy consort's side and call'd thee hence  To the sublimer seats of joy and love  Where fate again shall join her soul to thine  Who now regardful of thy fame erects  The column to thy praise and sooths her woe  With pious honours to thy sacred name  Immortal Lo where tow'ring on the height  Of yon aërial pillar proudly stands  Thy image like a guardian god sublime  And awes the subject plain Beneath his feet  The German eagles spread their wings his hand  Grasps

gore on Hochstet's plain  The theatre of thy glory once was rais'd  A meaner trophy by th' Imperial hand  Extorted gratitude which now the rage  Of Malice impotent beseeming ill  A regal breast has

AYSCOUGH  at  Oxford  Writ from  Paris  in the Year  By the Same  SAY dearest friend how roll thy hours away  What pleasing study cheats the tedious day  Dost thou the sacred volumes oft explore  Of wise Antiquity's immortal lore  Where virtue by the charms of wit refin'd  At once exalts and polishes the mind  How diff'rent from our modern guilty art  Which Pleases only to Corrupt the heart  Whose curs'd refinements odious Vice adorn  And teach to Honour what we ought to Scorn  Dost thou in sage Historians joy to see  How Roman Greatness rose with Liberty  How the same hands that tyrants durst controul  Their empire stretch'd from Atlas to the Pole  Till wealth and conquest into slaves refin'd  The proud luxurious masters of mankind  Dost thou in letter'd Greece each charm admire  Each grace each virtue Freedom could inspire  Yet in her troubled states see all the woes  And all the crimes that giddy Faction knows  Till rent by parties by corruption sold  Or weakly careless or too rashly bold  She sunk beneath a mitigated doom  The Slave and Tut'ress of protecting Rome  Does calm Philosophy her aid impart  To guide the passions and to mend the heart  Taught by her precepts hast thou learnt the end  To which alone the wise their studies bend  For which alone by nature were design'd  The pow'rs of thoughtTo benefit mankind  Not like a cloyster'd drone to read and doze  In undeserving undeserv'd repose  But reason's influence to diffuse to clear  Th' enlighten'd world of ev'ry gloomy fear  Dispel the mists of error and unbind  Those pedant chains that clog the freeborn mind  Happy who thus his leisure can employ  He knows the purest hours of tranquil joy  Nor vex'd with pangs that busier bosoms tear  Nor lost to social virtue's pleasing care  Safe in the port yet lab'ring to sustain  Those who still float on the tempestuous main  So Locke the days of studious Quiet spent  So Boyle in Wisdom found divine Content  So Cambray worthy of a happier doom  The virtuous slave of Louis and of Rome  Good  Dr Hough  Wor'ster thus supports his drooping age  Far from courtflatt'ry far from partyrage  He who in youth a tyrant's frown defy'd  Firm and intrepid on his country's side  Her boldest champion then and now her mildest guide  O generous warmth O sanctity divine  To emulate his worth my friend be thine  Learn from his life the duties of the Gown  Learn not to flatter nor insult the Crown  Nor basely servile court the guilty Great  Nor raise the Church a Rival to the State  To Error mild to Vice alone severe  Seek not to spread the law of Love by Fear  The priest who plagues the world can never mend  No foe to Man was e'er to God a friend  Let Reason and let Virtue Faith maintain  All Force but theirs is impious weak and vain  Me other cares in other climes engage  Cares that become my birth and suit my age  In various knowledge to improve my youth  And conquer Prejudice worst foe to Truth  By foreign arts domestick faults to mend  Enlarge my notions and my views extend  The useful science of the world to know  Which books can never teach or pedants shew  A nation here I pity and admire  Whom noblest sentiments of glory fire  Yet taught by custom's force and bigot fear  To serve with pride and boast the Yoke they bear  Whose Nobles born to Cringe and to Command  In courts a mean in camps a gen'rous band  From each low Tool of pow'r content receive  Those laws their dreaded arms to Europe give  Whose People vain in Want in Bondage blest  Tho' plunder'd gay industrious though oppress'd  With happy follies rise above their fate  The Jest and Envy of each wiser state  Yet here the Muses deign'd a while to sport  In the short sunshine of a fav'ring court  Here Boileau strong in sense and sharp in wit  Who from the Ancients like the Ancients writ  Permission gain'd inferior vice to blame  By flatt'ring incense to his Master's fame  Here Moliere first of comick wits excell'd  Whate'er Athenian theatres beheld  By keen yet decent satire skill'd to please  With Morals Mirth uniting Strength with Ease  Now charm'd I hear the bold Corneille inspire  Heroick thoughts with Shakespear's force and fire  Now sweet Racine with milder influence move  The soften'd heart to Pity and to Love  With mingled pain and pleasure I survey  The pompous works of arbitrary sway  Proud Palaces that drain'd the subjects store  Rais'd on the ruins of th' oppress'd and poor  Where ev'n mute walls are taught to flatter state  And painted triumphs stile Ambition GREAT  The victories of LOUIS XIV painted in the galleries of Versailles  With more delight those pleasing shades I view  Where Condé from an envious court withdrew  Chantilly  Where sick of glory faction pow'r and pride  Sure judge how empty all who all had try'd  Beneath his palms the weary Chief repos'd  And life's great scene in quiet Virtue clos'd  With shame that other fam'd Retreat I see  Adorn'd by Art disgrac'd by Luxury  St Cloud  Where Orleans wasted ev'ry vacant hour  In the wild riot of unbounded pow'r  Where feverish Debauch and impious Love  Stain'd the mad table and the guilty grove  With these amusements is thy friend detain'd  Pleas'd and instructed in a foreign land  Yet oft a tender wish recals my mind  From present joys to dearer left behind  O native isle fair freedom's happiest seat  At thought of thee my bounding pulses beat  At thought of thee my heart impatient burns  And all my country on my soul returns  When shall I see thy fields whose plenteous grain  No pow'r can ravish from th' industrious swain  When kiss with pious love the sacred earth  That gave a BURLEIGH or a RUSSEL birth  When in the shade of laws that long have stood  Prop'd by their care or strengthen'd by their blood  Of fearless independence wisely vain  The proudest slave of Bourbon's race disdain  Yet oh what doubt what sad presaging voice  Whispers within and bids me not rejoice  Bids me contemplate ev'ry state around  From sultry Spain to Norway's icy bound  Bids their lost rights their ruin'd glories see  And tells me These like England once were Free  To Mr POYNTZ  Ambassador at the Congress of SOISSONS in the Year  Written at  Paris  By the Same  O Thou whose friendship is my joy and pride  Whose Virtues warm me and whose Precepts guide  Thou to whom Greatness rightly understood  Is but a larger power of being good  Say Poyntz amidst the toils of anxious state  Does not thy secret soul desire Retreat  Dost thou not wish the task of glory done  Thy busy life at length might be thy own  That to thy lov'd philosophy resign'd  No care might ruffle thy unbended mind  Just is the wish For sure the happiest meed  To favour'd man by smiling heav'n decreed  Is to reflect at ease on glorious pains  And calmly to enjoy what Virtue gains  Not him I praise who from the world retir'd  By no enlivening generous passion fir'd  On flow'ry couches slumbers life away  And gently bids his active pow'rs decay  Who fears bright Glory's awful face to see  And shuns Renown as much as Infamy  But blest is he who exercis'd in cares  To private Leisure publick Virtue bears  Who tranquil ends the race he nobly run  And decks Repose with trophies Labour won  Him Honour follows to the secret shade  And crowns propitious his declining head  In his retreats their harps the Muses string  For him in lays unbought spontaneous sing  Friendship and Truth on all his moments wait  Pleas'd with Retirement better than with State  And round the bow'r where humbly great he lies  Fair olives bloom or verdant laurels rise  So when thy Country shall no more demand  The needful aid of thy sustaining hand  When peace restor'd shall on her downy wing  Secure Repose and careless Leisure bring  Then to the shades of learned ease retir'd  The world forgetting by the world admir'd  Among thy books and friends thou shall possess  Contemplative and quiet Happiness  Pleas'd to review a life in Honour spent  And painful Merit paid with sweet Content  Yet tho' thy hours unclogg'd with sorrow roll  Tho' wisdom calm and science feed thy soul  One dearer bliss remains to be possess'd  That only can improve and crown the rest  Permit thy friend this secret to reveal  Which thy own heart perhaps would better tell  The point to which our sweetest passions move  Is to be truly lov'd and fondly love  This is the charm that smooths the troubled breast  Friend to our health and author of our rest  Bids ev'ry gloomy vexing passion fly  And tunes each jarring string to harmony  Ev'n while I write the name of love inspires  More pleasing thoughts and more enlivening fires  Beneath his pow'r my raptur'd fancy glows  And ev'ry tender verse more sweetly flows  Dull is the privilege of living free  Our hearts were never form'd for Liberty  Some beauteous image well imprinted there  Can best defend them from consuming care  In vain to groves and gardens we retire  And nature in her rural works admire  Tho' grateful these yet these but faintly charm  They may Delight us but can never Warm  May some fair eyes my friend thy bosom fire  With pleasing pangs of ever gay desire  And teach thee that soft science which alone  Still to thy searching mind rests slightly known  Thy soul tho' great is tender and refin'd  To friendship sensible to love inclin'd  And therefore long thou canst not arm thy breast  Against the entrance of so sweet a guest  Hear what th' inspiring Muses bid me tell  For heav'n shall ratify what they reveal  A chosen bride shall in thy arms be plac'd  With all th' attractive charms of beauty grac'd  Whose wit and virtue shall thy own express  Distinguish'd only by their softer dress  Thy greatness she or thy retreat shall share  Sweeten tranquillity or soften care  Her smiles the taste of ev'ry joy shall raise  And add new pleasure to renown and praise  Till charm'd you own the truth my verse would prove  That Happiness is near ally'd to Love  VERSES to be written under a Picture of Mr POYNTZ  By the Same  SUCH is thy form O Poyntz but who shall find  A hand or colours to express thy mind  A mind unmov'd by ev'ry vulgar fear  In a false world that dares to be sincere  Wise without art without ambition great  Tho' firm yet pliant active tho' sedate  With all the richest stores of Learning fraught  Yet better still by native Prudence taught  That fond the griefs of the distress'd to heal  Can pity frailties it could never feel  That when Misfortune sued ne'er sought to know  What sect what party whether friend or foe  That fix'd on equal virtue's temp'rate laws  Despises Calumny and shuns Applause  That to its own perfections singly blind  Would for another think this praise design'd  An Epistle to Mr POPE  From  Rome    By the Same  IMmortal bard for whom each muse has wove  The fairest garlands of th'Aonian grove  Preserv'd our drooping genius to restore  When Addison and Congreve are no more  After so many stars extinct in night  The darken'd age's last remaining light  To thee from Latian realms this verse is writ  Inspir'd by memory of ancient Wit  For now no more these climes their influence boast  Fall'n is their glory and their virtue lost  From Tyrants and from Priests the Muses fly  Daughters of Reason and of Liberty  Nor Baiae now nor Umbria's plain they love  Nor on the banks of Nar or Mincius rove  To Thames's flow'ry borders they retire  And kindle in thy breast the Roman fire  So in the shades where chear'd with summer rays  Melodious linnets warbled sprightly lays  Soon as the faded falling leaves complain  Of gloomy winter's unauspicious reign  No tuneful voice is heard of joy or love  But mournful silence saddens all the grove  Unhappy Italy whose alter'd state  Has felt the worst severity of fate  Not that Barbarian hands her Fasces broke  And bow'd her haughty neck beneath their yoke  Not that her palaces to earth are thrown  Her cities desart and her fields unsown  But that her ancient Spirit is decay'd  That scared Wisdom from her bounds is fled  That there the source of Science flows no more  Whence its rich streams supply'd the world before  Illustrious names that once in Latium shin'd  Born to Instruct and to Command mankind  Chiefs by whose virtue mighty Rome was rais'd  And Poets who those Chiefs sublimely prais'd  Oft I the traces you have left explore  Your ashes visit and your urns adore  Oft kiss with lips devout some mould'ring stone  With ivy's venerable shade o'ergrown  Those hallow'd Ruins better pleas'd to see  Than all the pomp of modern luxury  As late on Virgil's tomb fresh flow'rs I strow'd  While with th' inspiring muse my bosom glow'd  Crown'd with eternal bays my ravish'd eyes  Beheld the poet's awful form arise  Stranger he said whose pious hand has paid  These grateful rites to my attentive shade  When thou shalt breathe thy happy native air  To Pope this message from his Master bear  Great Bard whose numbers I myself inspire  To whom I gave my own harmonious lyre  If high exalted on the throne of wit  Near me and Homer thou aspire to sit  No more let meaner Satire dim the rays  That flow majestick from thy nobler bays  In all the flow'ry paths of Pindus stray  But shun that thorny that unpleasing way  Nor when each soft engaging muse is thine  Address the least attractive of the nine  Of thee more worthy were the task to raise  A lasting column to thy Country's praise  To sing the land which yet alone can boast  That Liberty corrupted Rome has lost  Where Science in the arms of Peace is laid  And plants her Palm beside the Olive's shade  Such was the theme for which my lyre I strung  Such was the People whose exploits I sung  Brave yet refin'd for Arms and Arts renown'd  With different bays by Mars and Phoebus crown'd  Dauntless opposers of tyrannick sway  But pleas'd a mild Augustus to obey  If these commands submissive thou receive  Immortal and unblam'd thy name shall live  Envy to black Cocytus shall retire  And howl with Furies in tormenting fire  Approving Time shall consecrate thy lays  And join the Patriot's to the Poet's praise"  To My LORD  In the Year  From Worcestershire  By the Same  Strenua nos exercet Inertia Navibus atque  Quadrigis petimus bene Vivere quod petis hic est  Est Ulubris Animus si te non deficit aequus  HORACE  FAV'RITE of Venus and the tuneful Nine  Pollio by nature form'd in courts to shine  Wilt thou once more a kind attention lend  To thy long absent and forgotten friend  Who after seas and mountains wander'd o'er  Return'd at length to his own native shore  From all that's gay retir'd and all that's great  Beneath the shades of his paternal seat  Has found that Happiness he sought in vain  On the fam'd banks of Tiber and of Seine  'Tis not to view the wellproportion'd pile  The charms of Titian's and of Raphael's stile  At soft Italian sounds to melt away  Or in the fragrant groves of myrtle stray  That lulls the tumults of the soul to rest  Or makes the fond possessor truly blest  In our own breasts the source of Pleasure lies  Still open and still flowing to the wise  Not forc'd by toilsome art and wild desire  Beyond the bounds of nature to aspire  But in its proper channels gliding fair  A common benefit which all may share  Yet half mankind this easy Good disdain  Nor relish happiness unbought by pain  False is their taste of bliss and thence their search is vain  So idle yet so restless are our minds  We climb the Alps and brave the raging winds  Through various toils to seek Content we roam  Which but with  thinking right  were our's at home  For not the ceaseless change of shifted place  Can from the heart a settled grief erase  Nor can the purer balm of foreign air  Heal the distemper'd mind of aking care  The Wretch by wild Impatience driv'n to Rove  Vex'd with the pangs of illrequited love  From pole to pole the fatal arrow bears  Whose rooted point his bleeding bosom tears  With equal pain each different clime he tries  And is himself that torment which he flies  For how shou'd ills that from our passions flow  Be chang'd by Afric's heat or Russia's snow  Or how can aught but pow'rful Reason cure  What from unthinking Folly we endure  Happy is He and He alone who knows  His heart's uneasy discord to compose  In gen'rous love of others Good to find  The sweetest pleasures of the social mind  To bound his wishes in their proper sphere  To nourish pleasing hope and conquer anxious fear  This was the wisdom ancient Sages taught  This was the sov'reign Good they justly sought  This to no place or climate is confin'd  But the free native produce of the mind  Nor think my Lord that Courts to you deny  The useful practice of Philosophy  Horace the wisest of the tuneful choir  Not always chose from Greatness to retire  But in the palace of Augustus knew  The same unerring maxims to pursue  Which in the Sabine or the Velian shade  His study and his happiness he made  May you my friend by his example taught  View all the giddy scene with sober thought  Undazzled every glitt'ring folly see  And in the midst of slavish forms be free  In its own center keep your steady mind  Let Prudence guide you but let Honour bind  In show in manners act the Courtier's part  But be a Countrygentleman at heart  ADVICE to a LADY  By the Same  THE counsels of a friend Belinda hear  Too roughly kind to please a Lady's ear  Unlike the flatteries of a lover's pen  Such truths as women seldom learn from men  Nor think I praise you ill when thus I shew  What female Vanity might fear to know  Some merit's mine to dare to be sincere  But greater your's sincerity to bear  Hard is the fortune that your sex attends  Women like Princes find few real friends  All who approach them their own ends pursue  Lovers and Ministers are seldom true  Hence oft from Reason heedless Beauty strays  And the most trusted Guide the most betrays  Hence by fond dreams of fancy'd Pow'r amus'd  When most you tyrannize you're most abus'd  What is your sex's earliest latest care  Your heart's supreme ambition To be fair  For this the toilet every thought employs  Hence all the toils of dress and all the joys  For this hands lips and eyes are put to school  And each instructed feature has its rule  And yet how few have learnt when this is giv'n  Not to disgrace the partial boon of heav'n  How few with all their pride of form can Move  How few are lovely that were made for love  Do you my fair endeavour to possess  An elegance of mind as well as dress  Be that your ornament and know to please  By graceful nature's unaffected ease  Nor make to dangerous Wit a vain pretence  But wisely rest content with modest Sense  For Wit like wine intoxicates the brain  Too strong for feeble woman to sustain  Of those who claim it more than half have none  And half of those who have it are undone  Be still superior to your sex's arts  Nor think Dishonesty a proof of Parts  For you the plainest is the wisest rule  A CUNNING WOMAN is a KNAVISH FOOL  Be good yourself nor think another's shame  Can raise your merit or adorn your fame  Prudes rail at whores as statesmen in disgrace  At Ministers because they wish their place  Virtue is amiable mild serene  Without all beauty and all peace within  The honour of a prude is rage and storm  'Tis ugliness in its most frightful form  Fiercely it stands defying gods and men  As fiery monsters guard a giant's den  Seek to be good but aim not to be great  A woman's noblest station is Retreat  Her fairest virtues fly from publick sight  Domestick worth that shuns too strong a light  To rougher man Ambition's task resign  'Tis ours in Senates or in Courts to shine  To labour for a sunk corrupted state  Or dare the rage of envy and be great  One only care your gentle breasts should move  Th'important Business of your life is Love  To this great point direct your constant aim  This makes your Happiness and this your Fame  Be never cool reserve with passion join'd  With caution chuse but then be fondly kind  The selfish heart that but by halves is given  Shall find no place in Love's delightful heav'n  Here sweet extreams alone can truly bless  The virtue of a lover is excess  A maid unask'd may own a wellplac'd flame  Not loving  first  but loving  wrong  is shame  Contemn the little pride of giving pain  Nor think that Conquest justifies Disdain  Short is the period of insulting Pow'r  Offended Cupid finds his vengeful hour  Soon will resume the empire which he gave  And soon the Tyrant shall become the Slave  Blest is the maid and worthy to be blest  Whose soul entire by him she loves possess'd  Feels every vanity in fondness lost  And asks no pow'r but that of pleasing most  Her's is the bliss in just return to prove  The honest warmth of undissembled Love  For her inconstant man might cease to range  And Gratitude forbid Desire to change  But lest harsh Care the lover's peace destroy  And roughly blight the tender buds of joy  Let Reason teach what Passion fain wou'd hide  That Hymen's bands by Prudence should be ty'd  Venus in vain the wedded pair would crown  If angry fortune on their union frown  Soon will the flatt'ring dream of bliss be o'er  And cloy'd imagination cheat no more  Then waking to the sense of lasting pain  With mutual tears the nuptial couch they stain  And that fond love which should afford relief  Does but encrease the anguish of their grief  While both cou'd easier their own sorrows bear  Than the sad knowledge of each other's care  Yet may you rather feel that virtuous pain  Than sell your violated charms for gain  Than wed the wretch whom you despise or hate  For the vain glare of useless wealth or state  The most abandon'd Prostitutes are they  Who not to Love but Av'rice fall a prey  Nor aught avails the specious name of WIFE  A maid so wedded is a WHORE FOR LIFE  Ev'n in the happiest choice where fav'ring heav'n  Has equal love and easy fortune giv'n  Think not the Husband gain'd that all is done  The prize of Happiness must still be won  And oft the careless find it to their cost  The  Lover  in the  Husband  may be lost  The  Graces  might  alone  his heart  allure  They  and the  Virtues meeting  must  secure  Let ev'n your  Prudence  wear the pleasing dress  Of care for  him  and anxious  tenderness  From kind concern about his weal or woe  Let each domestick duty seem to flow  The HOUSHOLD SCEPTRE if he bids you bear  Make it your pride his  servant  to appear  Endearing thus the common acts of life  The  Mistress  still shall charm him in the  Wife  And wrinkled age shall unobserv'd come on  Before his eye perceives one beauty gone  Ev'n o'er your cold your eversacred urn  His constant flame shall unextinguish'd burn  Thus I Belinda would your charms improve  And form your heart to all the arts of love  The task were harder to secure my own  Against the pow'r of those already known  For well you twist the secret chains that bind

true  DAMON  Unkind my Falsehood to upbraid  When your own orders I obey'd  You bid me try by this Deceit  The notice of the world to cheat  And hide beneath another name  The secret of our mutual

to rest  Humbly secure and indolently blest  Warm'd by the blaze of my own chearful hearth  I'll waste the wintry hours in social mirth  In summer pleas'd attend to harvest toils  In autumn press the vineyard's purple spoils  And oft to Delia in my bosom bear  Some kid or lamb that wants its mother's care  With her I'll celebrate each gladsome day  When swains their sportive rites to Bacchus pay  With her new milk on Pales' altar pour  And deck with ripen'd fruits Pomona's bow'r  At night how soothing wou'd it be to hear  Shelter'd and warm the tempest whistling near  And while my charmer in my arms I strain  Slumber assisted by the beating rain  Ah how much happier than the fool who braves  In search of wealth the black tempestuous waves  While I contented with my little store  In tedious voyage seek no distant shore  But idly lolling on some shady seat  Near cooling fountains shun the dogstar's heat  For what reward so rich cou'd Fortune give  That I by absence shou'd my Delia grieve  Let great Messalla shine in martial toils  And grace his palace with triumphal spoils  Me Beauty holds in strong tho' gentle chains  Far from tumultuous war and dusty plains  With thee my love

invite him to repose  Hard were his heart who thee my fair cou'd leave  For all the honours prosp'rous War can give  Tho' through the vanquish'd east he spread his fame  And Parthian tyrants trembled at his name  Tho' bright in arms while hosts around him bleed  With martial pride he press'd his foaming steed  No pomps like these my humble vows require  I ask in thy embraces to expire  Thee may my closing eyes in death behold  Thee may my fault'ring hand yet strive to hold  Then Delia then thy heart will melt in woe  Then o'er my breathless clay thy tears will flow  Thy tears will flow for gentle is thy mind  Nor dost thou think it weakness to be kind  With thee each youth and tender maid shall join  In grief and mix their friendly sighs with thine  But ah my Delia I conjure thee spare  Thy heaving breasts and loose dishevell'd hair  Wound not thy form lest on th' Elysian coast  Thy anguish shou'd disturb my peaceful ghost  But now nor death nor parting shou'd employ  Our sprightly

graces leads  Array'd in all her flow'ry pride  No sweeter fragrance now the gardens yield  No brighter colours paint th' enamell'd field  III  Is it to Love these new delights I owe  Four times has the revolving sun  His annual circle thro' the zodiack run  Since all that Love's indulgent pow'r  On favour'd mortals can bestow  Was given to me in this auspicious bow'r  IV  Here first my LUCY sweet in virgin charms  Was yielded to my longing arms  And round our nuptial bed  Hovering with purple wings th' Idalian boy  Shook from his radiant torch the blissful fires  Of innocent desires  While Venus scatter'd myrtles o'er her head  Whence then this strange increase of joy  He only he can tell who match'd like me  If such another happy man there be  Has by his own experience tried  How much  the Wife  is dearer than  the Bride  TO THE MEMORY of the same LADY A MONODY  AD    Ipse cavâ solans aegrum testudine amoram  Te dulcis conjux solo te in littore secum  Te veniente die te decedente canebat  By the Same  I  AT length escap'd from ev'ry human eye  From ev'ry duty ev'ry care  That in my mournful thoughts might claim a share  Or force my tears their flowing stream to dry  Beneath the gloom of this embow'ring shade  This lone retreat for tender sorrow made  I now may give my burden'd heart relief  And pour forth all my stores of grief  Of grief surpassing ev'ry other woe  Far as the purest bliss the happiest love  Can on th'ennobled mind bestow  Exceeds the vulgar joys that move  Our gross desires inelegant and low  II  Ye tufted groves ye gently falling rills  Ye high o'ershadowing hills  Ye lawns gaysmiling with eternal green  Oft have you my LUCY seen  But never shall you now behold her more  Nor will she now with fond delight  And taste refin'd your rural charms explore  Clos'd are those beauteous eyes in endless night  Those beauteous eyes where beaming us'd to shine  Reason's pure light and virtue's spark divine  III  Oft would the Dryads of these woods rejoice  To hear her heav'nly voice  For her despising when she deign'd to sing  The sweetest songsters of the spring  The woodlark and the linnet pleas'd no more  The nightingale was mute  And ev'ry shepherd's flute  Was cast in silent scorn away  While all attended to her sweeter lay  Ye larks and linnets now resume your song  And thou melodious Philomel  Again thy plaintive story tell  For death has stopt that tuneful tongue  Whose musick could alone your warbling notes excel  IV  In vain I look around  O'er all the wellknown ground  My LUCY's wonted footsteps to descry  Where oft we us'd to walk  Where oft in tender talk  We saw the summer sun go down the sky  Nor by you fountain's side  Nor where its waters glide  Along the valley can she now be found  In all the widestretch'd prospect's ample bound  No more my mournful eye  Can ought of her espy  But the sad sacred earth where her dear relicks lie  V  O shades of Hy where is now your boast  Your bright inhabitant is lost  You she preferr'd to all the gay resorts  Where female vanity might wish to shine  The pomp of cities and the pride of courts  Her modest beauties shun'd the publick eye  To your sequester'd dales  And flow'rembroider'd vales  From an admiring world she chose to fly  With nature there retir'd and nature's GOD  The silent paths of wisdom trod  And banish'd ev'ry passion from her breast  But those the gentlest and the best  Whose holy flames with energy divine  The virtuous heart enliven and improve  The conjugal and the maternal love  VI  Sweet babes who like the little playful fawns  Were wont to trip along these verdant lawns  By your delighted Mother's side  Who now your infant steps shall guide  Ah where is now the hand whose tender care  To ev'ry Virtue would have form'd your Youth  And strew'd with flow'rs the thorny ways of Truth  O loss beyond repair  O wretched Father left alone  To weep their dire misfortune and thy own  How shall thy weaken'd mind oppress'd with woe  And drooping o'er thy LUCY's grave  Perform the duties that you doubly owe  Now She alas is gone  From folly and from vice their helpless age to save  VII  Where were ye Muses when relentless fate  From these fond arms your fair disciple tore  From these fond arms that vainly strove  With hapless ineffectual Love  To guard her bosom from the mortal blow  Could not your fav'ring power Aonian maids  Could not alas your power prolong her date  For whom so oft in these inspiring shades  Or under Campden's mossclad mountains hoar  You open'd all your sacred store  Whate'er your ancient sages taught  Your ancient bards sublimely thought  And bade her raptur'd breast with all your spirit glow  VIII  Nor then did Pindus or Castalia's plain  Or Aganippe's fount your steps detain  Nor in the Thespian vallies did you play  Nor then on  The Mincio runs by Mantua the birthplace of VIRGIL  Mincio's bank  Beset with osiers dank  Nor where  The Clitumnus is a river of Umbria the residence of PROPERTIUS  Clitumnus rolls his gentle stream  Nor where through hanging woods  Steep  The Anio runs through Tibur or Tivoli where HORACE had a villa  Anio pours his floods  Nor yet where  The Meles is a river of Ionia from whence HOMER supposed to be born on its banks is called Melisigenes  Meles or  The Ilissus is a river at Athens  Ilissus stray  Ill does it now beseem  That of your guardian care bereft  To dire disease and death your darling should be left  IX  Now what avails it that in early bloom  When light fantastick toys  Are all her sex's joys  With you she search'd the wit of Greece and Rome  And all that in her later days  To emulate her ancient praise  Italia's happy genius could produce  Or what the Gallick fire  Brightsparkling could inspire  By all the Graces temper'd and refin'd  Or what in Britain's isle  Most favour'd with your smile  The pow'rs of reason and of fancy join'd  To full perfection have conspir'd to raise  Ah what is now the use  Of all these treasures that enrich'd her mind  To blank oblivion's gloom for ever now consign'd  X  At least ye Nine her spotless name  'Tis yours from death to save  And in the temple of immortal Fame  With golden characters her worth engrave  Come then ye virgin sisters come  And strew with choicest flow'rs her hallow'd tomb  But foremost thou in sable vestment clad  With accents sweet and sad  Thou plaintive Muse whom o'er his Laura's urn  Unhappy Petrarch call'd to mourn  O come and to this fairer Laura pay  A more impassion'd tear a more pathetick lay  XI  Tell how each beauty of her mind and face  Was brighten'd by some sweet peculiar grace  How eloquent in ev'ry look  Thro' her expressive eyes her soul distinctly spoke  Tell how her manners by the world refin'd  Left all the taint of modish vice behind  And made each charm of polish'd courts agree  With candid truth's simplicity  And uncorrupted innocence  Tell how to more than manly sense  She join'd the soft'ning influence  Of more than female tenderness  How in the thoughtless days of wealth and joy  Which oft the care of other's Good destroy  Her kindlymelting heart  To ev'ry want and ev'ry woe  To guilt itself when in distress  The balm of pity would impart  And all relief that bounty could bestow  Ev'n for the kid or lamb that pour'd its life  Beneath the bloody knife  Her gentle tears would fall  As She the common mother were of all  XII  Nor only good and kind  But strong and elevated was her mind  A spirit that with noble pride  Could look superior down  On fortune's smile or frown  That could without regret or pain  To virtue's lowest duty sacrifice  Or int'rest's or ambition's highest prize  That injur'd or offended never try'd  Its dignity by vengeance to maintain  But by magnanimous disdain  A wit that temperately bright  With inoffensive light  All pleasing shone nor ever past  The decent bounds that wisdom's sober hand  And sweet benevolence's mild command  And bashful modesty before it cast  A prudence undeceiving undeceiv'd  That nor too little nor too much believ'd  That scorn'd unjust suspicion's coward fear  And without weakness knew to be sincere  Such LUCY was when in her fairest days  Amidst th' acclaim of universal praise  In life's and glory's freshest bloom  Death came remorseless on and sank her to the tomb  XIII  So where the silent streams of Liris glide  In the soft bosom of Campania's vale  When now the wintry tempests all are fled  And genial Summer breathes her gentle gale  The verdant orange lifts its beauteous head  From ev'ry branch the balmy flow'rets rise  On ev'ry bough the golden fruits are seen  With odours sweet it fills the smiling skies  The woodnymphs tend it and th' Idalian queen  But in the midst of all its blooming pride  A sudden blast from Apenninus blows  Cold with perpetual snows  The tender blighted plant shrinks up its leaves and dies  XIV  Arise O Petrarch from th'Elysian bowers  With neverfading myrtles twin'd  And fragrant with ambrosial flowers  Where to thy Laura thou again art join'd  Arise and hither bring the silver lyre  Tun'd by thy skilful hand  To the soft notes of elegant desire  With which o'er many a land  Was spread the fame of thy disastrous love  To me resign the vocal shell  And teach my sorrows to relate  Their melancholy tale so well  As may ev'n things inanimate  Rough mountain oaks and desart rocks to pity move  XV  What were alas thy woes compar'd to mine  To thee thy mistress in the blissful band  Of Hymen never gave her hand  The joys of wedded love were never thine  In thy domestick care  She never bore a share  Nor with endearing art  Would heal thy wounded heart  Of ev'ry secret grief that fester'd there  Nor did her fond affection on the bed  Of sickness watch thee and thy languid head  Whole nights on her unwearied arm sustain  And charm away the sense of pain  Nor did she crown your mutual flame  With pledges dear and with a father's tender name  XVI  O best of wives O dearer far to me  Than when thy virgin charms  Were yielded to my arms  How can my soul endure the loss of thee  How in the world to me a desart grown  Abandon'd and alone  Without my sweet companion can I live  Without thy lovely smile  The dear reward of ev'ry virtuous toil  What pleasures now can pall'd ambition give  Ev'n the delightful sense of wellearn'd praise  Unshar'd by thee no more my lifeless thoughts could raise  XVII  For my distracted mind  What succour can I find  Or whom for consolation shall I call  Support me ev'ry friend  Your kind assistance lend  To bear the weight of this oppressive woe  Alas each friend of mine  My dear departed love so much was thine  That none has any comfort to bestow  My books the best relief  In ev'ry other grief  Are now with your idea sadden'd all  Each fav'rite author we together read  My tortur'd mem'ry wounds and speaks of LUCY dead  XVIII  We were the happiest pair of human kind  The rolling year its varying course perform'd  And back return'd again  Another and another smiling came  And saw our happiness unchang'd remain  Still in her golden chain  Harmonious Concord did our wishes bind  Our studies pleasures tastes the same  O fatal fatal stroke  That all this pleasing fabrick Love had rais'd  Of rare felicity  On which ev'n wanton Vice with envy gaz'd  And ev'ry scheme of bliss our hearts had form'd  With soothing hope for many a future day  In one sad moment broke  Yet O my soul thy rising murmurs stay  Nor dare th'allwise Disposer to arraign  Or against his supreme decree  With impious grief complain  That all thy fullblown joys at once should fade  Was his most righteous will and be that will obey'd  XIX  Would thy fond love his grace to her controul  And in these low abodes of sin and pain  Her pure exalted soul  Unjustly for thy partial good detain  Norather strive thy groveling mind to raise  Up to that unclouded blaze  That heav'nly radiance of eternal light  In which enthron'd she now with pity sees  How frail how insecure how slight  Is ev'ry mortal bliss  Ev'n love itself if rising by degrees  Beyond the bounds of this imperfect state  Whose fleeting joys so soon must end  It does not to its sov'reign Good ascend  Rise then my soul with hope elate  And seek those regions of serene delight  Whose peaceful path and everopen gate  No feet but those of harden'd Guilt shall miss  There Death himself thy LUCY shall restore  There yield up all his pow'r e'er to divide you more  VERSES Making Part of an EPITAPH on the same LADY  By the Same  MADE to engage all hearts and charm all eyes  Tho' meek magnanimous tho' witty wise  Polite as all her life in courts had been  Yet good as she the world had never seen  The noble fire of an exalted mind  With gentlest female tenderness combin'd  Her Speech was the melodious voice of Love  Her Song the warbling of the vernal grove  Her Eloquence was sweeter than her Song  Soft as her Heart and as her Reason strong  Her Form each beauty of her Mind express'd  Her Mind was Virtue by the Graces dress'd  ON THE ABUSE of TRAVELLING  A CANTO In IMITATION of  SPENSER  By GILBERT WEST  Esq    The ARGUMENT  Archimage  tempts the RedCross Knight  From love of Fairyland  With show of foreign pleasures all  The which he doth withstand  I  WISE was that Spartan Lawgiver of old  Who rais'd on Virtue's base his wellbuilt state  Exiling from her walls barbarick gold  With all the mischiefs that upon it wait  Corruption luxury and envious hate  And the distinctions proud of rich and poor  Which among brethren kindle fould debate  And teach Ambition that to Fame would soar  To the false lure of wealth her stooping wing to low'r  II  Yet would Corruption soon have entrance found  And all his boasted schemes eftsoon decay'd  Had not he cast a powerful circle round  Which to a distance the arch felon fray'd  And ineffectual his foul engines made  This was to weet that politick command  Which from vain travel the young Spartan stay'd  Ne suffer'd him forsake his native land  To learn deceitful arts and science contraband  III  Yet had that ancient world her courts and schools  Great Kings and Courtiers civil and refin'd  Great Rabbins deeply read in wisdom's rules  And all the arts that cultivate the mind  Embellish life and polish human kind  Such Asia birthplace of proud monarchy  Such elder Aegypt in thy kingdoms shin'd  Mysterious Aegypt the rank nursery  Of superstitions fond and learned vanity  IV  But what accomplishments what arts polite  Did the young Spartan want his deeds to grace  Whose manly virtues and heroick spright  Check'd by no thought impure no falshood base  With nat'ral dignity might well outface  The glare of manners false and mimick pride  And wherefore should they range from place to place  Who to their country's love so firm were ty'd  All homely as she was that for her oft they dy'd  V  And  truth  sooth it is with reverence may ye hear  And honour due to passion so refin'd  The strong affection which true patriots bear  To their dear country zealous is and blind  And fond as is the love of womankind  So that they may not her defects espy  Ne other  rival or one to compare with her  paragone may ever find  But gazing on her with an aweful eye  And superstitious zeal her learn to deify  VI  And like as is the faith unsound untrue  Of him who wand'ring aye from fair to fair  Conceiveth from each object passion new  Or from his heart quite drives the troublous care  So with the patriotlover doth it fare  Who through the world delighting aye to rove  His country changeth with each change of air  Or weening the delights of all to prove  On none or all alike bestows his vagrant love  VII  moreover besides  Als doth corruption in a distant soil  With double force  assault  assay the youthful heart  Expos'd suspectless to the traytor's wile  Expos'd unwarn'd to pleasure's poison'd dart  Expos'd unpractis'd in the world's wide mart  Where each one lies imposes and betrays  Without a friend due counsel to impart  Without a parent's awe to rule his ways  Without the check of shame or spur of publick praise  VIII  therefore  Forthy false Archimago traytor vile  Who burnt 'gainst Fairyland with ceaseless ire  Gan cast with foreign pleasures to beguile  Her faithful knight and quench the heav'nly fire  That did his virtuous bosom aye inspire  With zeal unfeigned for her service true  And send him forth in chivalrous attire  Arm'd at all points adventures to pursue  And wreak upon her foes his vowed vengeance due  IX  So as he journeyed upon the way  Him soon the sly enchaunter  overtook  overhent  Clad like a Fairy knight in armour gay  With painted shield and spear right forward bent  In knightly  fashion  guise and shew of  courage  hardiment  That aye prepared was for bloody fight  Whereat the  fairy  Elfin knight with speeches gent  Him first saluted who well as he might  Him fair salutes again as  beseemeth  seemeth courteous knight  X  Then gan he  discourse or argument  purpose frame of valiant deeds  Atchiev'd by foreign knights of  might valour  prowess great  And mighty fame which emulation breeds  In virtuous breast and kindleth martial heat  Of arts and sciences for warriour  proper fit  meet  And knight that would in feats of arms excell  Or him who  rather  liefer choosing calm retreat  With peace and gentle virtue aye would dwell  Who have their triumphs like as hath Bellona fell  XI  These as he said beseemed knight to know  And all be they in Fairylond ytaught  Where every art and all fair virtues grow  Yet various climes with various fruits are fraught  And such in one hath full perfection  reach'd  raught  The which no skill may in another rear  So gloz'd th' enchaunter till he hath him brought  To a huge rock that clomb so high in air  That from it he  hardly  uneath the murmuring surge mote hear  XII  Thence the salt wave beyond in prospect wide  A spacious plain the false enchaunter show'd  With goodly castles deck'd on every side  And silver streams that down the champain flow'd  And wash'd the vineyards that beside them stood  And groves of myrtle als the lamp of day  His orient beams display'd withouten cloud  Which lightly on the glistening waters play  And tinge the castles woods and hills with purple ray  XIII  So fair a landscape charm'd the wondring knight  And eke the breath of morning fresh and sweet  Inspir'd his jocund spirit with delight  And ease of heart for soft persuasion meet  Then him the traytor base gan fair entreat  And from the rock as downward they descend  Of that blest lond his praises can repeat  Till he him moved hath with him to  to go  wend  So to the billowy shore their hasty march they bend  XIV  There in a painted bark all trim and gay  Whose sails full glad embrac'd the wanton wind  There sat a stranger  man or woman  wight in quaint array  That seem'd of various garbs  together  attone combin'd  Of Europe Afric east and western Inde  Als round about him many creatures stood  Of several nations and of diverse kind  Apes serpents birds with human speech endow'd  And monsters of the land and wonders of the flood  XV  He was to weet a mighty traveller  Who Curiosity thereafter  was called  hight  And well he knew each coast and harbour fair  And every nation's latitude and site  And how to steer the wand'ring bark aright  So to him strait the false enchaunter bore  And with him likewise brought the redcross knight  Then fairly him besought to waft them o'er  Swift flew the dauncing bark and reach'd the adverse shore  XVI  There when they landed were them ran to greet  A bevy bright of damsels gent and gay  Who with soft smiles and salutation sweet  And courteous violence would force them stay  And rest them in their bow'r not far away  Their bow'r that most luxuriously was  adorned set forth  dight  With all the dainties of air earth and sea  All that mote please the taste and charm the sight  The pleasure of the board and charm of beauty bright  XVII  Als might he therein hear a mingled sound  Of feast and song and laughing jollity  That in the noise was all distinction drown'd  Of graver sense or musick's harmony  Yet were there some in that blithe company  That aptly could discourse of virtuous lore  Of manners wisdom and sound policy  Yet  would not  nould they often ope their sacred store  Ne might their voice be heard mid riot and uproar  XVIII  Thereto the joys of idleness and love  And luxury that besots the noblest mind  And custom prevalent at distance drove  All sense and relish of a higher kind  Whereby the soul to virtue is refin'd  Instead whereof the arts of slavery  Were taught of slavery perverse and blind  That vainly boasts her native liberty  Yet wears the chains of pride of lust and gluttony  XIX  Of which the redcross knight right well aware  Would in no wise agree with them to go  Albeit with courtly glee their leader fair  called  Hight Politessa him did kindly woo  But all was false pretence and hollow show  False as the flow'rs which to their breasts they ty'd  Or those which seemed in their cheeks to glow  For both were false and not by nature dy'd  False rivals of the spring and beauty's rosy pride  XX  Then from behind them straitway gan advaunce  An uncouth stripling quaintly habited  As for some revel mask or antick daunce  All chequer'd o'er with yellow blue and red  Als in a vizor black he shrouds his head  The which he tossed to and fro amain  And  often  eft his lathy falchion brandished  As if he meant fierce battle to  attempt  darrain  And like a wanton ape eft skip'd he on the plain  XXI  And est about him skip'd a gaudy throng  Of youthful gallants frolick trim and gay  Chanting in careless notes their amourous song  Match'd with like careless gests like amourous play  Als were they gorgeous dress'd in rich array  And well accepted of that female train  Whose hearts to joy and mirth devoted aye  Each proffer'd love receive without disdain  And part without regret from each latefavour'd swain  XXII  And now they do accord in wanton daunce  To join their hands upon the flow'ry plain  The whiles with amourous leer and eyes askaunce  Each damsel fires with love her glowing swain  Till allimpatient of the tickling pain  In sudden laughter forth at once they break  And ending so their daunce each tender twain  To shady bow'rs forthwith themselves betake  Deep hid in myrtle groves beside a silver lake  XXIII  Thereat the redcross knight was much enmov'd  And gan his heart with indignation swell  To view in forms so made to be belov'd  Ne faith ne truth ne heav'nly virtue dwell  But lust instead and falshood child of hell  And glutton sloth and love of gay attire  And sooth to say them well could parallel  Their lusty  lovers  paramours in vain desire  Well fitted to each dame was every gallant squire  XXIV  Yet when their sovereign calls them forth to arms  Their sovereign whose  commands  behests they most revere  Right wisely can they menage war's alarms  And wield with valour great the martial spear  So that their name is dreaded far and near  Oh that for Liberty they so did fight  Then need not Fairyland their prowess fear  Ne give in charge to her advent'rous knight  Their friendship to beware and sensedeluding sleight  XXV  But not for liberty they wagen war  But solely to  please  aggrate their mighty lord  For whom their dearest blood they  will not  nillen spare  Whenso him listeth draw the conquering sword  So is that idol vain of them ador'd  Who ne with might beyond his meanest thrall  Endued ne with superior wisdom stor'd  Sees at his feet prostrated millions fall  And with religious drad obey his princely call  XXVI  Thereto so high and stately was his port  That all the petty kings him sore envy'd  And would him imitate in any sort  Withall the mimick pageantry of pride  And worship'd be like him and deify'd  Of courtly sycophants and  scoundrels  captives vile  Who to those services themselves apply'd  And in that school of servitude ere while  Had learn'd to bow and grin and flatter and beguile  XXVII  For to that seminary of fashions vain  The rich and noble from all parts repair  Where grown enamour'd of the gaudy train  And courteous haviour gent and debonair  They cast to imitate such semblaunce fair  And deeming meanly of their native lond  Their own rough virtues they disdain to wear  And back returning dress'd by foreign hond  Ne other matter care ne other understond  XXVIII  Wherefore th' enchaunter vile who sore was griev'd  To see the knight reject those damsels gay  Wherewith he thought him sure to have deceiv'd  Was minded to that court him to convey  And daze his eyen with Majesty's bright ray  So to a stately castle he him brought  Which in the midst of a great garden lay  And wisely was by cunning craftsmen wrought  And with all riches deck'd surpassing human thought  XXIX  There underneath a sumptuous canopy  That with bright ore and diamonds glitter'd far  Sate the swoln form of royal  pride  Surquedry  And deem'd itself  by all means omnino  allgates some creature rare  While its own haughty state it mote compare  With the base count'nance of the vassal fry  That seem'd to have nor eye nor tongue nor ear  Ne any sense ne any faculty  That did not to his throne owe servile ministry  XXX  Yet wist he not that half that homage low  Was at a wizard's shrine in private pay'd  The which conducted all that goodly show  And as he list th' imperial puppet play'd  By secret springs and wheels right wisely made  That he the subtle wires mote not  discover perceive  avize  But deem in sooth that all he did or said  From his own motion and free grace did rise  And that he justly hight immortal great and wise  XXXI  And eke to each of that fame gilded train  That meekly round that lordly throne did stand  Was by that wizard ty'd a magick chain  Whereby their actions all he mote command  And rule with hidden influence the land  Yet to his lord he outwardly did bend  And those same magick chains within his hand  Did seem to place albeit by the end  He held them fast that none them from his gripe mote rend  XXXII  He was to weet an old and wrinkled mage  Deep read in all the arts of policy  And from experience grown so crafty sage  That none his secret counsels mote descry  Ne search the mines of his deep subtlety  Thereto fair peace he lov'd and cherished  And traffick did promote and industry  Whereby the vulgar were in quiet fed  And the proud lords in ease and plenty wallowed  XXXIII  Thence all the gorgeous splendor of the court  since  Sith the sole bus'ness of the rich and great  Was to that hopebuilt temple to resort  And round their earthly god in glory wait  Who with their pride to swell his royal state  Did pour large sums of gold on every one  Brought him by harpies fell him to aggrate  And torn from peasants vile beneath the throne  Who lay deep sunk in earth and inwardly did groan  XXXIV  Behold says ARCHIMAGE the envy'd height  Of human grandeur to the gods ally'd  Behold yon sun of pow'r whose glorious light  O'er this rejoicing land outbeaming wide  Calls up those princely flowers on every side  Which like the painted daughters of the plain  Ne toil ne spin ne stain their silken pride  With care or sorrow sith withouten pain  Them in eternal joy those heav'nly beams maintain  XXXV  Them morn and evening joy eternal greets  And for them thousands and ten thousands  work hard  moil  Gathering from land and ocean honied sweets  For them who in soft indolence the while  And slumb'ring peace enjoy the luscious spoil  And as they view around the careful bees  quite spent  Forespent with labour and incessant toil  With the sweet contrast learn themselves to please  And heighten by compare the luxury of ease  XXXVI  Ungenerous man quoth then the Fairy knight  That can rejoice to see another's woe  And thou unworthy of that glory bright  Wherewith the gods have deck'd thy princely brow  That dost on Sloth and Gluttony bestow  The hardearn'd fruits of Industry and Pain  And to the dogs the labourer's morsel throw  Unmindful of the hand that sow'd the grain  The poor earthtrodden root of all thy greatness vain  XXXVII  Oh foul abuse of sacred Majesty  That boasteth her fair self from heav'n ysprong  Where are the marks of thy divinity  Truth Mercy Justice steady bold and strong  To aid the meek and curb oppressive wrong  Where is the care and love of publick good  That to the people's father doth belong  Where the vicegerent of that bounteous God  Who bids dispense to all what he for all bestow'd  XXXVIII  Dwell'st thou not rather like the prince of Hell  In Pandemonium foul of ugly fiends  Dissimulation Discord Malice fell  Reckless Ambiton that right onward  goes  wends  Tho' his wild march o'erthrow both fame and friends  And virtue and his country crooked Guile  Obliquely creeping to his treach'rous ends  And Flattery curs'd assassm who the while  He holds the murd'rous knife can sawn and kiss and smile  XXXIX  Then 'gan he strait unvail the mirrour bright  The which fair  Una in Spenser represents Truth see B  Fairy Queen  Una gave him heretofore  Ere he as yet with  Heathen the usual enemy of knighterrants in Spenser  Paynim foe to fight  For foreign land had left his native shore  This in his careful breast he always bore  And on it oft would cast his wary eye  For it by magick framed was of yore  So that no falshood mote it well abye  But it was plainly seen or fearfully did fly  XL  This on that gay assembly did he turn  And saw confounded quite the gawdy scene  Saw the close fire that inwardly did burn  And waste the throbbing heart with secret  pain anguish  teen  Saw base dependence in the haughty mien  Of lords and princes saw the magick chain  That each did wear but deem'd he wore unseen  The whiles with count'naunce glad he hid his pain  And homage did require from each poor lowly swain  XLI  And tho' to that old mage they louted down  Yet did they dearly wish for his decay  Als trembled he and aye upon the throne  Of his great lord his tottering steps did stay  And oft behind him skulk'd for great dismay  Als shook the throne when so the villain crew  That underneath oppress'd and groveling lay  Impatient of the grievous burthen grew  And loudly for redress and liberty did sue  XLII  There mote he likewise see a ribbald train  Of dancers broid'rers slaves of luxury  Who cast o'er all those lords and ladies vain  A vail of semblaunce fair and richest dye  That none their inward baseness mote descry  But nought was hidden from that mirrour bright  Which when false ARCHIMAGO 'gan espy  He feared for himself and warn'd the knight  From so detested place to maken speedy flight  XLIII  So on he passed till he comen hath  To a small river that full slow did glide  As it uneath mote find its watry path  For stones and rubbish that did choak its tide  So lay the mould'ring piles on every side  Seem'd there a goodly city once had been  Albeit now fallen were her royal pride  Yet mote her auncient greatness still be seen  Still from her ruins prov'd the world's imperial queen  XLIV  For the rich spoil of all the continents  The boast of art and nature there was brought  Corinthian brass Aegyptian monuments  With hieroglyphick sculptures all inwrought  And Parian marbles by Greek artists taught  To counterfeit the forms of heroes old  And set before the eye of sober thought  Lycurgus Homer and Alcides bold  All these and many more that may not here be told  XLV  There in the middest of a ruin'd pile  That seem'd a theatre of circuit vast  Where thousands might be seated he erewhile  Discover'd hath an uncouth trophy plac'd  Seem'd a huge heap of stones together cast  In nice disorder and wild symmetry  Urns broken freezes statues half defac'd  And pedestals with antique imagery  Emboss'd and pillars huge of costly Porphyry  XLVI  Aloft on this strange basis was  placed  ypight  With girlonds gay adorn'd a golden chair  In which aye smiling with selfbred delight  In careless pride reclin'd a lady fair  And to soft musick lent her idle ear  The which with pleasure so did her enthrall  That for aught else she had but little care  For wealth or fame or honour feminal  Or gentle love sole king of pleasures natural  XLVII  Als by her side in richest robes array'd  An eunuch sate of visage pale and dead  Unseemly paramour for royal maid  Yet him she courted oft and honoured  And oft would by her place in princely  seat or place  sted  Though from the dregs of earth he springen were  And oft with regal crowns she deck'd his head  And oft to sooth her vain and foolish ear  She bade him the great names of mighty  emperors  Kesars bear  XLVIII  Thereto herself a pompous title bore  For she was vain of her great auncestry  But vainer still of that prodigious store  Of arts and

poets of departing a little from chronology and have postponed for a few years the institution of this order for the sake of rendering that solemnity more august by introducing king John of France who though a prisoner was treated both by Edward and his son the prince of Wales with all the regard due to the quality and virtue of so great a prince To alleviate his captivity Edward entertained him and the other French prisoners with diversions of various kinds among which a tournament he held at Windsor on the d of April to solemnize the feast of St George the patron of the order of the GARTER held the chief place and was as Rapin tells us the most sumptuous and magnificent that had ever been seen in England The duke of Brabant with several other sovereign princes and an infinite number of

the morn  From the bow whose mingling dyes  Sweetly chear the frowning skies  From the silver cloud that sails  Shadowy o'er the darken'd vales  From th' Elysiums of the sky  Spirits immortal hither

From your empyreal bow'rs  Chiefly ye whose brows divine  Crown'd with starry circlets shine  Who in various labours try'd  Once Britannia's strength and pride  Now in everlasting rest  Share the glories of the blest  Peers and nobles of the sky  Spirits immortal hither fly  CHORUS of SPIRITS  Fly and thro' the limpid air  Guard in pomp the sliding car  Which to his terrestrial throne  Wafts Britannia's genius down  Third SPIRIT  Hither too ye tuneful throng  Masters of enchanting song  Sacred bards whose rapt'rous strains  Sooth the toiling hero's pains  Sooth the patriot's generous cares  Sweetly thro' their ravish'd ears  Whisp'ring to th' immortal mind  Heav'nly visions hopes refin'd  Hopes of endless peace and fame  Safe from envy's blasting flame  Pure sincere in those

of oaken boughs upon their heads and golden harps in their hands made like the  Welsh  or old  British  harp Before they appear they sing the chorus and afterwards as they descend the following songs at the last stanza of which the chariot of the GENIUS appears and descends gradually all the while that and the grand chorus is singing  CHORUS of BARDS  Gentle Spirit we obey  Thus along th' aetherial way  We attend our monarch's car  Thus we charm the silent air  SONG  First BARD  Ye southern gales that ever fly  In frolick April's vernal train  Who as ye skim along the sky  Dip your light pinions in the main  Then shake them fraught with genial show'rs  O'er blooming Flora's primrosebow'rs    Now cease a while your wanton sport  Now drive each threat'ning cloud away  Then to the flow'ry vale resort  And hither all its sweets convey  And ever as ye dance along  With softest murmurs aid our song  SONG II  Second BARD  But lo fair Windsor's tow'rs appear  And hills with spreading oaks imbrown'd  Hark hark the voice of joy I hear  Sung by a thousand echoes round  And now I view a glittering train  In triumph march o'er yonder plain  Grand CHORUS of SPIRITS and BARDS  Hail mighty nation ever fam'd in war  Lo heav'n descends thy festivals to share  To view those heroes whose immortal praise  Celestial bards shall sing in living lays  At the conclusion of this chorus the GENIUS alights from his chariot the front of which resembling the head of a man of war is adorned with a carved lion holding before his breast the arms of  England  as they were borne by  Edward  Behind on a rais'd seat sits the GENIUS leaning upon an anchor of silver and bearing in his right hand the  vindicta  or wand of enfranchisement and in his left a roll of parchment upon which is written in large letters of gold MAGNA CHARTA On his head is a  corona rostrata  or naval crown and his robe of a seagreen colour is embroider'd with  cornucopiae's  and golden tridents  GENIUS

Breint and Meinai wash'd the oaks  Of ancient Mona their academies  And schools of sage and moral discipline  They held and to the neighb'ring Britons round  From their rever'd tribunals holy mounts  Dispens'd at once their oracles and laws  'Till fierce Paulinus and his Roman bands  Them and their gods defying drove them thence  To seek for shelter in Hibernian shades  Yet still enamour'd of their ancient haunts  Unseen of mortal eyes they hover round  Their ruin'd altars consecrated hills  Once girt with spreading oaks mysterious rows  Of rude enormous obelisks that rise  Orb within orb stupendous monuments  Of artless architecture such as now  Oft times amaze the wand'ring traveller  By the pale moon discern'd on Sarum's plain  But hence aërial spirits lo they come  Here the SPIRITS and BARDS together with the chariot of the GENIUS reascend and at the same time the DRUIDS enter cloath'd in darkcolour'd coarse stuff gowns  which before hang no lower than the knee but behind almost touch the ground The sleeves of these gowns reach down below the elbow and from behind comes up a sort of hood or cowle which hangs loose about the head and forehead From the left shoulder hangs in a string a kind of pouch or scrip and rests on the right hip In their righthands they hold a staff and in their left an oaken branch Their beards are very large and long reaching below their waists Their legs are naked and their feet shod with sandals which are fastened by thongs wound about the foot and the small of the leg  See a cut of the chief Druid in Rowland's Mona Antiqua restaurata

of heroes listed in the cause  Of honour virtue and celestial truth  Under the name and holy patronage  Of Cappadocian GEORGE Britannia's saint  Such is the plan by gen'rous Edward form'd  A plan of glory that beyond the reach  Of his own conqu'ring arms shall propagate  The sovereignty of Britain and erect  Her monarchs into judges of mankind  But from this day's decisions from the choice  Of his first collegues shall succeeding times  Of Edward judge and on his fame pronounce  For dignities and titles when misplac'd  Upon the vicious the corrupt and vile  Like princely virgins to low

eloquence Edward I trust  The trial shall abide which shall but tend  To manifest that not from arrogance  But conscious virtue hath he thus assum'd  Above all other kings to be the judge  And great rewarder of heroick deeds  Nor wholly unassisted will I leave  My royal charge but with blest influence clear  His intellectual eye from the dim mists  It haply hath contracted from a long  Unebbing current of felicity  Unhop'd unequall'd triumphs from the view  Of captive monarchs and the glitt'ring throng  Who at his summons from all climates come  To take as from their sov'reign honours new

Unworthy your attention my renown  This bright assemblage of the wise the brave  The noble the magnificent the fair  The ornaments of Europe have I sought  To grace the pomp of Virtue to adorn  With

Thus as the orient sun ador'd of old  By prostrate Persia ow'd his deity  Less to that genial and benignant heat  That cherishes and warms the seeds of life  Than to those gorgeous beams that deck with gold  And crimson the gay portals of the morn  So shall this rising order owe its fame  And brightest lustre to the splendid train  Of lords and purple princes who are met  This day to usher and adorn its birth  Nor deem that to allure heroick minds  My private interests partially to serve  To list the valiant in ambition's cause  And form a league of conquest I have laid  In subtie policy this great design  Edward being engaged in a war with France for the obtaining that crown in order to draw into England great multitudes of foreigners with whom he might negociate either for their personal service or aids of troops to assist him in that undertaking ordered during the truce that then subsisted between the two crowns publication to be made of a great tournament to be held at Windsor an expedient says Rapin which could not fail of success because it was entirely agreeable to the taste of that age Accordingly many persons of distinction came over to all of whom he gave an honourable reception caressing them in such a manner that they could never sufficiently admire his politeness magnificence and liberality To render these entertainments the more solemn and to free himself also from the ceremonies to which the difference of rank and condition would have subjected him he caused a circular hall of boards to be run up at Windsor feet in diameter There it was that he feasted all the knights at one table which was called the Round Table in memory of the great Arthur who as it is pretended instituted an order of knighthood by that name Next year he caused a more solid building to be erected that he might continue yearly the same diversions During that time he treated with these several lords about the aids wherewith each could furnish him in proportion to his forces His rival king Philip could not see without jealousy Spaniards Italians Germans Flemings and Frenchmen themselves flock to England to assist at these tournamrnts He suspected some hidden design in these entertainments and to break Edward's meosures caused the like to be published in his dominions which meeting with success proved a countermine to Edward's main design so that he did not long continue to keep up his round table From thence however it is generally agreed he took the first hint of instituting the order of the Garter But as his purpose in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive Arthur's round table as he had in this no private views no ambitious scheme of engaging such as should be admitted into this fraternity to assist him in his wars he thought proper in order to obviate the like jealousies and suspicion as had alarmed king Philip to signify by his motto the purity of his intentions and to retort shame upon all those who should put any malignant construction upon his design in instituting this order This therefore I take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE The not understanding the purport of which gave rise in all probability to that vulgar story of the countess of Salisbury's garter rejected by all the best writers  ASHAM'D BE HE WHO WITH MALIGNANT EYE  SO

Than to be plac'd on high in anxious pride  The purple drudge and slave of tiresome state  If to superior power superior means  Of joy were not annex'd and larger scope  For every wish the lavish heart can form  If the soft hand of pleasure did not wreathe  Around the royal diadem whose weight  Oppressive loads the monarch's aching brow  Her fairest growth of everblooming flow'rs  On thee victorious prince propitious fortune  Hath pour'd her richest gifts renown and wealth  And greatness equal to thy mighty mind  One only bliss is wanting to thy court  Voluptuous elegance the lovely child  Of ease and opulence that never comes  But like a bird of summer to attend  The brightest sunshine of a glorious state  To her and her alone belongs the task  By learned delicacy to remove  What yet remains in this thy ancient realm  Of Gothick barbarism the rust of war  And valiant ignoranceHer artful hand  Thy rugged Britons shall refine and teach  More courtly manners to their sov'reign's will  Politely pliant do but thou command  Thy willing servant with thy favours grac'd  From fair Joanna's eversmiling court  Under whose happy influence I was train'd  From polish'd Naples her delightful feat  The blooming goddess to transport with all  Her train of joys and fix them here beneath  Thy great protectionBut perhaps thou fear'st  The voice of censure and the grave reproof  Of moralizing dullness idle fear  The vulgar herd indeed religious craft  And policy of state have well confin'd  With wise severity to rigid laws  Else would that headstrong beast the multitude  Forget obedience and its rider's voice  Disdain But shall the rider put a curb  In his own mouth The laws that kings have made  Shall they restrain the makers Edward no  For thee indulgent justice shall relax  Her harsh decrees and piety shall wait  To give her reverend sanction to thy will  'Tis thine to rove at large thro' nature's field  Crop every flow'r and taste of every fruit  By sweet variety provoking still  The languid appetite to new desires  Nor useless to thy pleasures happy prince  Shall be my faithful service nicer joys  Joys of a quicker more exalted taste  Than ever ripen'd in this northern clime  The growth of softer regions shall my hand  By skilful culture in thy Britain raise  To them whose gross and dull capacities  Are fit to bear the burthens of the state  The lab'ring mules that thro' the mire of forms  Draw the slow car of government along  Gladly the task of bus'ness I resign  Be mine the brighter province to direct  Thy pleasures Edward minister supreme  Of all thy softer hours to serve the king  Be theirs the glory let me serve the man  But shou'd thy sterner Genius only pleas'd  With arms and royalty's important cares  The duties of a king my gentle arts  Too lightly prize and thence reject my suit  Permit at least that to Philippa's ear  Divine Philippa thine and beauty's queen  And her attendant graces I may plead  The cause of bliss a cause so much their own  They will approve my claim to whom the cares  The labours of my life my head my heart  Are all devotedLet me from their hands  Receive the GARTER and be call'd their knight  PHILLIPPA  Permit me gracious Edward to reply  To this irreverent flatterer who presumes  Before a matron and a queen to plead  The cause of vice and impudently hopes  To find in her a fautress of his suit  But know pernicious sophister my heart  Hath learn'd from Edward's love and this high rank  Which I partake with him a noble pride  That ill can brook the too familiar eye  And saucy tongue of riot and debauch  In whose unmanner'd light society  Nor majesty nor virtue can maintain  That dignity which is their proper guard  Thy vile refinements and luxurious arts  Miscall'd politeness I detest and feel  In the soft duties of a virtuous love  Such pure serene delight as far transcends  What thou stil'st pleasure the delirious joy  Of an intoxicated feverish brain  Behold my royal lord the first and best  Of kings the love and wonder of mankind  Behold my children worthy their great fire  The general theme of praise and benediction  These are my pleasures can thy skill bestow  Superior bliss Ah no the vain attempt  Wou'd only bring disgust remorse and shame  EDWARD  That I have lov'd Philippa and esteem'd thee  More for thy virtues than those female charms  Which this vile flatterer deems fingly worth  His panegyrick be thy happiness  And glory as it is thy Edward's pride  With the like spirit have I also woo'd  And wedded sov'reign pow'r not weakly caught  With outward pomp or seeking to my self  A privilege to riot uncontroul'd  In sensual pleasures and behind the throne  To laugh securely at restraint and law  No I embrac'd her as the child of heav'n  Dowr'd with the ample means of doing good  From whose espousals I might hope to raise  An offspring worth th' ambition of a king  Immortal glory to a generous mind  As far surpassing all the wanton toys  Which he calls pleasure as thy faithful love  The sweet o'erflowing of heartfelt delight  Excels Philippa the lascivious smile  Of common prostitutes caress'd and loath'd  Hence from my sight with thy detested arts  Base minister of luxury the bane  Of every flourishing and happy state  Presume no more within my court to sing  Thy Syrensong nor soften into slaves  And cowards my brave subjectsI disdain  That elegance which such as thou can teach  Virtue alone is elegant alone  Polite vice must be sordid and deform'd  Tho' to adorn her every art contend  And rather wou'd I see my Britons roam  Untutor'd savages among their woods  As once they did in naked innocence  Than polish'd like the vile degenerate race  Of modern Italy's corrupted sons  Exit  Neap  Trumpet sounds and is answer'd from without by another trumpet which sounds a march accompanied by kettledrums and other warlike instruments Then enters preceded by soldiers playing upon fifes and others bearing tatter'd ensigns standards and trophies a leader of mercenary bands compleatly arm'd from head to foot and carrying in his righthand a  baton  or truncheon On each side of him march his 'squires one bearing his launce the other his shield Behind him as his attendants comes a a train of officers and soldiers maimed and their faces all seam'd with scars  SOLDIER  Nor riches nor nobility of birth  Nor the soft arts of base effeminate ease  Which justly thou rejectest valiant prince  But thy own darling attribute I boast  Undaunted courage try'd in many a field  In every clime and under every banner  That for these forty summers hath been wav'd  O'er Europe's plains by Isther Rhine and Po  Hungarian and Bohemian Flemish French  Venetian Spanish Guelph and Ghibeline  Whence in just confidence secure I come  This military honour to demand  Due to my toils and service to my wounds  My laurels and that generous love of glory  Which without any call or publick cause  Or private animosity alone  Rais'd my strong arm and drew my dreadful sword  Wherever Mars his crimson flag display'd  That was my country thither swift I bore  My ready valour and the dauntless band  Of various nations under my command  Prepar'd to sell their blood their limbs their lives  Nor where the right nor where the justest cause  Deign'd we to askthose intricate debates  We left to lazy penmen in the shade  Of coward ease while our impetuous fire  Still bore us forward ardent to pursue  Thro' danger's roughest paths the steps to fame  On such a spirit should thy favour smile  But let me wonder Edward that so long  Thy ear the vain pretensions cou'd endure  Of men unknown to war attendants meet  On some luxurious Asiatick court  Or female distaffreign but suiting ill  The presence of a monarch great in arms  Hadst thou to those inglorious sons of peace  Thy martial order giv'n the warriorsaint  Had blush'd to see his image so profan'd  Which on my manly breast indented o'er  With many a noble scar will fitly shine  But wherefore stand I thus haranguing here  Unskilful as I am in smooth discourse  The coward's argument On force alone  I rest my title let the glorious prize  Be hung on high amid the listed field  And let me there dispute it there my launce  Shall plead my cause far better than my tongue  If any dare deny my rightful claim  EDWARD  Not for the brave alone have I ordain'd  This institution but for all desert  All publick virtue wisdom all that serves  Improves defends or dignifies a state  Tho' first indeed to valour as the guard  Of all the rest when in the publick cause  With justice and benevolence employ'd  But thou base mercenary canst thou dare  The glorious name of valour to usurp  Who know'st no publick cause no sense of right  Nor pity nor affection nor remorse  Who under any chief in any quarrel  Canst stain with gore thy prostituted arms  Call it not love of glory that is built  On acts for the deliverance of mankind  On generous principles and noble scorn  Of sordid interest call it cruel pride  And savageness of nature that delights  To conquer and oppress afflict insult  Or call it love of plunder that can draw  Unauthoris'd uninjur'd unprovok'd  The sword of war that bravolike can lift  For hire the venal hand to perpetrate  Assassinations murders massacres  But thou hast serv'd with courage be it so  Thou hast thy pay and with it thy reward  Pretend no farther nor compare thy deeds  Dishonour'd by the mean desire of gain  With his who for his country and his king  Resigns his ease his fortune or his life  Those battles thou hast fought those forty years  Of blood and horror which thy vaunting tongue  So high hath sounded are indeed thy crimes  Flagitious crimes for which th' impartial bar  Of reason wou'd condemn thee as the foe  Of human nature did not custom screen  By her unjust esteem thy guilty head  But hope not honour or employment here  Unsafe and wretched is that monarch's state  Who weakly trusts to mercenary bands  The guard or of his person or his realm  Unfaithful insolent rapacious base  He soon shall prove them and become himself  Their slave to hold his kingdom at their will  For this within my Britain have I sought  To raise a martial spirit and ordain'd  These new incitements honours and rewards  To virtuous chivalry that never king  Who wears hereafter my imperial crown  May need to stoop to the precarious aid  Of venal foreign swords but in the hearts  Of his brave subjects find a stronger guard  Prepar'd with zeal unbought and English valour  His rights to vindicate and save their own  Exit  Soldier  Trumpet sounds to which another from without replies Then enters an  Italian  politician habited like a  Venetian  nobleman who advancing with a solemn and important air towards the throne makes a low reverence to king  Edward  and proceeds  POLITICIAN  Well has thy sovereign wisdom royal judge  The suit refus'd of these pretenders vain  And by rejecting them embolden'd me  For valour and nobility and wealth  Though by their proud possessors vaunted high  Are but subordinate the slaves and tools  Not the companions and the counsellors  Of godlike monarchy whose awful throne  By darksome clouds envelop'd far beyond  The ken of vulgar eyes supported stands  On that deeprooted prop the craft of state  Mysterious policyWho best hath learn'd  Her wily lessons best deserves to share  The honours counsels and the hearts of kings  By him instructed even the meanest prince  Shall rise to envy'd greatness shall advance  His dreaded pow'r above restraint and fear  And all the rules that in fantastick chains  Inferior minds confine Thus Milan's dukes  Thus Padoua's lords above their country's laws  Have rais'd their heads and trampled to the dust  The pride of freedom that essays in vain  Their high superior genius to controul  These were my masters mighty prince beneath  Their rule and in their councils was I form'd  To know the false corrupted heart of man  His every weakness every vice and thence  To tempt or break his passions to the yoke  To scorn the publick as an empty name  And on the helpless multitude impose  The adamantine bonds of fraud and force  Thus was I train'd thus fitted to conduct  The fate of proudest empires thus I come  To claim thy GARTER Edward the just meed  Of worth praeeminent and in return  My services to offer which no doubt  Thy wisdom gladly will accept for who  So fit to serve the majesty of kings  As he who slighting every meaner tye  Friends parents country to advance their pow'r  Devotes his toil experience fortune fame  Nor other favour courts nor refuge hopes  But in their high protectionLed by me  Thou royal Edward shalt attain that height  That glorious summit of imperial pow'r  Which not thy mightiest ancestors have reach'd  Where in a freer air a more enlarg'd  Horizon bounded only by thy will  Thou shalt exalted sit and view beneath  In humbler distances and safer bounds  Those subjects who presumptuous now approach  Too near and with rude hands profane thy throne  Nor let weak scruples check thy manly soul  In the bright task of glory know great prince  A king's divinity is sov'reign pow'r  The only God before whose shrine the wise  Their incense offer whence inspir'd they draw  Divine ambition and heroick scorn  Of vulgar prejudices vulgar fears  Virtue's the people's idol and by them  Rewarded well with popular applause  That idle breath the gift and prize of fools  'Tis thine to govern not to court mankind  Nor on their smiles precarious to depend  But nobly force them to depend on thine  O sacred sir can virtue give thee this  This bright supremacy Trust not her boasts  Her idle pageantry of barren praise  Reject her saucy claims importunate  And selfsupported nor admit her train  Proud independency and publick zeal  Those factious demagogues the foes of kings  EDWARD  Are virtue then and love of publick good  The foes of monarchy and are deceit  Injustice and oppression qualities  Becoming and expedient in a king  Then know I not to govern but have nurs'd  For twice these fifteen years even in my heart  A pois'nous viper nay unking'd my self  By yielding to restrain my sovereign pow'r  With laws and charters of enfranchisement  Not due it seems from monarchs to their slaves  But know vile counsellor of infamy  That I disdain thy politicks those false  And shallow politicks by which my sire  Weakjudging Edward was betray'd to shame  And foul destruction while to such as thee  His ear and heart incautious he resign'd  And was indeed their slave not England's king  By maxims different far have I sustain'd  The strength and splendor of my regal state  On the broad basis of true wisdom fix'd  With solid firmness By encouraging  The generous love of virtue and of fame  That source of valour pledge of victory  By granting to my subjects what indeed  Is their inherent right security  The chearful father of content and peace  Of industry and opulence which fills  With smiling multitudes the land and pays  In willing subsidies that prince's care  Who lays up treasure in his people's hearts  By holding with a firm impartial hand  The steady scale of justice not alone  Betwixt my subjects in their private rights  But in the general more important cause  Betwixt the crown and them the different claims  Of freedom and of just prerogative  Transgressing not myself by boundless pow'r  Nor suffering others to transgress those laws  That in their golden chain together bind  For common good the whole united state  But more than all by guarding from contempt  Or impious violation that supreme  Protectress of all government and law  Religion in whose train for ever wait  Obedience order justice mercy love  A guard of angels plac'd around the throne  Her sacred counsels have I still rever'd  Her high commands enforc'd her pow'r implor'd  O'er all my subject nations to call down  From heav'nly wisdom her eternal fire  A fix'd secure felicity beyond  The force of human prudence to attain  These are my arts of government those arts  By which my British crown I have advanc'd  Above th' imperial diadem above  The pride of Africk's or of Asia's thrones  I wou'd not tell thee this but that thou seem'st  A stranger to my fame as to my realm  And to the real greatness of a king  Whose sacred dignity by thee traduc'd  Much it behoves a king to vindicate  Not by rejecting only with disdain  Thy arrogant pretensions but in thee  Dishonouring and branding with reproach  Thy tenets also the pernicious lore  Of tyrants and usurpers which thy tongue  Blaspheming justice government and law  Hath in a land of freedom dar'd to vent  Hence from my kingdom with thy quickest speed  Lest the revenge of an insulted king  With sudden ruin intercept thy flight  Exit  Politician  King JOHN  Permit me Edward to thy royal voice  To add my suffrage also and with thee  Protest against this coward policy  That meanly skulks behind opprobrious fraud  And low unprincely artifice I feel  A virtue in my heart a generous pride  That tells me kings were cloath'd with majesty  Encircled with authority rever'd  And almost deify'd to teach them thence  That goodness and the saving attributes  Of heav'n become their office justice chief  And truth the virtue of heroick minds  Which were it banish'd from all other breasts  Should dwell for ever in the hearts of kings  Aërial musick  upon which reenter the five  Druids  who personated the  Grandee  c in their original characters and habits of  Druids  the chief of whom advancing towards the throne addresses himself to king  Edward  Chief DRUID  Behold in us great king the ancient priests  And judges of this land the Druids old  Who late in borrow'd characters have stood  Before thy sage tribunal to prefer  The claims of valour wealth nobility  And those soft specious flatterers who beneath  The rosy wreaths of pleasure and of love  Conceal the sickly and disgustful brow  Of riot and debauch and often win  From weak unmanly princes the rich prize  To virtue due and wisdom not to these  The cankers of a state but least of all  Due to that traytor to his king and country  Who lab'ring to build up the regal throne  Beyond its due proportion and the strength  Of those foundations which the laws have laid  O'erwhelms the people and at once o'erturns  His royal master places him at best  On an uneasy tottering pinacle  The mark of execration and reproach  These claims hast thou rejected like a king  Discerning in mankind and knowing well  The value of his favours like a king  Deserving the high office of the judge  And arbiter of Europe like a king  Equal to his great fame and worth the care  Of those immortal spirits who this day  Have quitted their celestial residence  To view and to approve thy glorious deeds  But Edward be not thou amaz'd to find  That those who lately for thy favour sued  Were not the personages they assum'd  O king thou art beset with counterfeits  The very opposites to us who seem  Far better than they are For flattery  Camelionlike accommodates with care  To the courthue his changeful countenance  And when a prince is brave magnanimous  And high in spirit then ambition wears  A face of dignity and nothing breathes  But lofty enterprizes conquest pow'r  And schemes of glory to the sovereign ear  Pretending love and care for his renown  With more than duteous zealOf these beware  For as the Theban queen in fables old  Was by the specious guile of fraudful Jove  In her Amphitryon's form to guilt betray'd  So by these counterfeits are kings seduc'd  Ev'n in the most belov'd suspectless shape  To take a traytor to their royal arms  But thou shalt know them Edward by their works  And of this truth be most assur'd that he  Who in his private commerce with mankind  Is mean dishonest interested false  Can ne'er be true to thee nor can he love  His prince who feels not for his country's good  Thus warn'd we leave thee mighty prince be firm  Be constant in the paths of fair renown  Think it thy duty to revere thyself  The sacred laws of chivalry the wise  Injunctions by thy order laid on all  The GARTER'D KNIGHTS so shall thy fame remain  The great example of all future kings  Farewel for lo the genius of thy realm  With all his pomp attended comes to share  And grace the glories of this signal day  These clouds of fragrance that farbeaming blaze  Of heav'nly brightness his approach declare  Druids  vanish  Flashes of light and symphony of aërial musick  Genius  of  England  descends in his chariot attended by spirits and bards then alighting he advances towards the throne and addresses himself to  Edward  GENIUS  From the gay realms of cloudless day I come  Where in the glitter of unnumber'd worlds  That like to isles of various magnitudes  Float in the ocean of unbounded space  On my invisible aërial throne  I sit attended with a radiant band  Of spirits immortal whose pure essences  While clad in human shapes on earth they dwelt  Thro' the dull clay of gross mortality  Disclos'd their heav'nly vigour and burst forth  In godlike virtues and heroick deeds  Their Albion gracing with as fair a growth  Of fame as e'er enrich'd imperial Rome  Thence ripe for heav'n and immortality  To me the Genius of this happy isle  They fly and claim the meed of their desert  Celestial crowns and everliving praise  Recorded in the songs of heav'nly bards  That round my throne their hymns of triumph sing  Attuning to the sweet harmonious spheres  Their undiscording lyres and voice divine  Nor thus remov'd to heav'n and thus employ'd  In ceaseless raptures wont they to forget  Their native country and the publick weal  To which on earth their labours and their lives  They once devoted but pursuing still  The bent and habit of their souls with me  They watch the British empire still intent  To check alternately th' incroaching waves  Of regal pow'r and popular liberty  I chief attentive near the royal throne  Take up my watchful station to infuse  My sage and moderate counsels in those ears  Which wisdom hath prepar'd and purify'd  To relish honest tho' unpleasing truth  Thus am I always tho' invisible  Attendant Edward on thy glorious deeds  But on this solemn day have I vouchsaf'd  To manifest my presence to declare  Not in those whispers which have often spoke  Peace to thy conscious heart but audibly  And evident to all th' assent of heav'n  To the great business which hath gather'd here  This troop of princes from all nations round  Hence all may know that virtue hath a train  More bright than earthly empire can command  Know that those actions which are great and good  Receive a nobler sanction from the free  And universal voice of all mankind  Which is the voice of heav'n than from the highest  The most illustrious act of regal pow'r  This noble sanction Edward in the name  Not of this age alone but latest time  Here do I solemnly annex to each  Of thy great acts but chief to this most wise  Most virtuous institution which extends  Wide as thy fame beyond thy empire's bound  A prize of virtue publish'd to mankind  Ye registers of heav'n record the deed  BARDS  Now tune ye bards the British lyre  Now wake the vocal string  While heav'n and earth in Edward's praise conspire  Join to the general voice your sacred quire  And on your soaring wing  From time and envy waft his glorious name  And place it in the shrine of incorruptive fame  Begin the listening echoes round  Shall catch with joy the longforgotten sound  And warbling thro' each grove the British strain  To Windsor's smiling nymphs recall their Arthur's reign  Ye nymphs of Windsor's bow'ry woods  Ye pow'rs who haunt yon glist'ning floods  That with reluctant fond delay  Around yon flow'ry valley stray  Say from your minds hath time eras'd  The pleasing images of glory pass'd  Review ye now those scenes no more  When nobly stain'd with Saxon gore  From Badon's long contended plain  Great Arthur with his martial train  To Windsor's chosen shades repair'd  And with his knights the festive banquet shar'd  Then first exulting Thames beheld  The triumphs of the listed field  Beheld along his level meads  Careering knights encount'ring steeds  Heroick games whose toils inspire  The thirst of praise and kindle martial fire  Fair peace in war's bright mail array'd  With smiles the glorious lists survey'd  So shou'd the brave she cry'd prepare  Their hearts and sinewy arms for war  Such combats break not my repose  Such sons best guard my rights from daring foes  Then too in feastful hall or bow'r  Attendant on the genial hour  The British harp sweet lyrists strung  And Albion's generous victors sung  While valiant Arthur's copious fame  Incessant fed the bright poetick flame  But mortals erring in excess  O'erwhelm the virtue they caress  Thus Arthur his great story mourn'd  By too fond praise to fable turn'd  Mourn'd the companions of his toils  Mock'd with false glory and fantastick spoils  'Till thro' the dark romantic tale  Thro' superstition's magick veil  Sage Edward piercing view'd and own'd  The chief with genuine lustre crown'd  View'd the great model and restor'd  The longlost honours of his martial board  Hail British prince These faithful lays  Eternal records of heroick worth  Shall reassert thy ancient praise  And from the cloud of fiction call thee forth  In glory's sphere thy orbit to reclaim  And at great Edward's beam relume thy darken'd fame  But see in heav'nly panoply array'd  Whose streaming radiance skirts the clouds with gold  I view Pendragon burst the veiling shade  And all his blazing magnitude unfold  O'er yon broad tow'r he takes his airy stand  And pointing Edward towards the royal throne  To his fam'd knights around a laurel'd band  Shews on thy knee the bright skytinctur'd zone  Virtue he cries th' aetherial sound  Thy gross material organ cannot hear  Virtue on earth by British Edward crown'd  Her reverend throne once more shall rear  To her own selfapplauding breast  Forc'd for reward no longer to retreat  She sees her awful charms by kings caress'd  Sees honour woo her for his mate  Honour her heav'nelected spouse  From her embrace by lawless pow'r withheld  Now at yon altar plights his holy vows  Vows by assenting Edward seal'd  And now the fair angelick bride  Gathering her noble train from every land  To her latewedded lord with decent pride  Presents the venerable band  The great procession Edward leads  I see yon hallowed dome with heroes throng'd  Incessant still the whiteplum'd pomp proceeds  Thro' time's eternal course prolong'd  And you dear partners of my fame  Your ancient honours now again shall boast  This noble ORDER shall retrieve our name  In visionary fables lost  This from our martial board deriv'd  These for our brethren let us proudly own  More pleas'd to view our deeds by thee reviv'd  Than griev'd great king to be outdone  CHORUS  Hail British prince these faithful lays  Shall reassert thy ancient praise  Nor thee O Windsor shall I pass unsung  Mansion of princes and fit haunt of gods  Who frequent shall

fane  Or lowly village residence of peace  And joyous industry or furrow'd plain  Or lowing herd or silver fleece  That whitens now each verdant vale  While laden with their precious store  Far trading barks to every shore  Swift heralds of Britannia's glory sail  EPODE I  These are thy shining works this smiling face  Of beauteous nature thus in regal state  Deck'd by each handmaid art each polish'd grace  That on fair liberty and order wait  This pomp these riches this repose  To thee imperial Britain owes  To thee great substitute of heav'n  To whom the charge of earthly realms was giv'n  Their social systems by wise nature's plan  To form and rule by her eternal laws  To teach the selfish soul of wayward man  To seek the publick good and aid the common cause  So didst thou move the mighty heart  Of Alfred founder of the British state  So to Matilda's scepter'd son  To him whose virtue and renown  First made the name of Edward great  Thy ample spirit so didst thou impart  Protecting thus in every age  From greedy pow'r and factious rage  That law of freedom which to Britain's shore  From Saxon Elva's manyheaded flood  The valiant sons of Odin with them bore  Their national ador'd inseparable good  STROPHE II  Runny Mead near Stains where the grand Charter was signed by king John  On yonder plain  Along whose willowfringed side  The silverfooted Naiads sportive train  Down the smooth Thames amid the cygnets glide  I saw when at thy reconciling word  Injustice anarchy intestine jar  Despotick insolence the wasting sword  And all the brazen throats of civil war  Were hush'd in peace from his imperious throne  Hurl'd furious down  Abash'd dismay'd  Like a chas'd lion to the savage shade  Of his own forests fell oppression fled  With vengeance brooding in his sullen breast  Then justice fearless rear'd her decent head  Heal'd every grief each wrong redress'd  While round her valiant squadrons stood  And bade her aweful tongue demand  From vanquish'd John's reluctant hand  The deed of freedom purchas'd with their blood  ANTISTROPHE II  O vain surmise  To deem the grandeur of a crown  Consists in lawless pow'r to deem them wise  Who change security and fair renown  For detestation shame distrust and fear  Who shut for ever from the blissful bow'rs  With horror and remorse at distance hear  The musick that inchants th' immortal pow'rs  The heav'nly musick of wellpurchas'd praise  Seraphick lays  The sweet reward  On heroes patriots righteous kings conferr'd  For such alone the heav'ntaught poets sing  Tune ye for Edward then the moral strain  His name shall well become your golden string  Begirt with this aetherial train  Seems he not rank'd among the gods  Then let him reap the glorious meed  Due to each great heroick deed  And taste the pleasures of the blest abodes  EPODE II  Hail happy prince on whom kind fate bestows  Sublimer joys and glory brighter far  Than Cressy's palm and every wreath that grows  In all the bloodstain'd field of prosp'rous war  Joys that might charm an heav'nly breast  To make dependent millions blest  A dying nation to restore  And save fall'n liberty with kingly pow'r  To quench the torch of discord and debate  Relume the lanquid spark of publick zeal  Repair the breaches of a shatter'd state  And gloriously compleat the plan of England's weal  Compleat the noble Gothick pile  That on the rock of justice rear'd shall stand  In symmetry and strength and fame  A rival of that boasted frame  Which virtue rais'd on Tiber's strand  This Edward guardian father of our isle  This godlike task to few assign'd  Exalts thee above humankind  And from the realms of everlasting day  Calls down celestial bards thy praise to sing  Calls this bright troop of spirits to survey  Thee the great miracle of earth a PATRIOTKING  GENIUS  Now reascend your skies immortal spirits  Th' important act that drew ye down to earth  Is finish'd Spare we now their mortal sense  That cannot long endure th'unshrouded beam  Of higher natures Well hath Edward laid  Under your happy auspices the base  Of his great ORDER let him undisturb'd  But not unaided by the heav'nly pow'rs  Compleat th' illustrious work which future kings  Struck with the beauty of the noble plan  Shall emulously labour to maintain  And may thy spirit Edward be their guide  In every chapter thou henceforth preside  In every breast infuse thy virtuous flame  And teach them to respect their country's fame  Genius  and  Spirits  reascend to a loud symphony of musick  An Epistle to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount CORNBURY  By  Esq    WHILE you my Lord alas amidst a few  With generous warmth your country's good pursue  While to that center all your wishes tend  Accept the zeal that prompts a willing friend  Others like you heaven's hallow'd spark inspir'd  Whom soon the blaze of selfish passion fir'd  Soon ruder flames extinguish'd reason's light  While prejudices foul'd their jaundic'd sight  Such thro' false opticks every object prove  And try the good and bad by hate and love  Allpowerful means each virtue to supply  Allpowerful means each virtue to deny  To Wyndham strength and grace and fire and weight  To Granville parts to save a sinking state  Hence various judgments forms the madden'd throng  Only in this alike they all are wrong  Hence to false praise shall blame unjust succeed  And cherubs fall and gods unpity'd bleed  Wou'd you my friend not mix the purer flame  Nor lose the patriot in a baser name  Nor factious rage mistake for publick zeal  Nor private int'rest for the gen'ral weal  By truth's sure test let ev'ry deed be try'd  And justice ever be th' unerring guide  Her rules are plain and easy is her way  And yet how hard to find if once we stray  All lost alike the maze perplex'd we tread  However prompted whether drove or led  Whether false honour or ambition goad  Or sneaking av'rice wind the miry road  Or whether sway'd by passions not our own  And the weak fear of being right alone  Alone in such a cause 'tis base to fear  Tho' fools suspect and knaves designing sneer  Sneer villains sneer th' avenging time is nigh  When Balbo scourg'd shall weep the taunting lie  When Stopus foul with each imputed crime  Shall dread false prose repaid with honest rhyme  'Tis not enough you scorn a private claim  And to your country's good direct your aim  Wrong still is wrong however great the end  Tho' all the realm were brother father friend  Justice regards not thesewhere right prevails  A nation is an atom in her scales  Heaven means not all the good which man can gain  But that which truth can earn and right maintain  However fair the tempting prize may be  If guilt the price it is not meant for thee  Succeeding times may claim the just design  Or other means or other powers than thine  Each part's connected with the gen'ral plan  The weal of Britain with the weal of man  Justice the scale of interest for the whole  The same in Indies as beneath the pole  Sure rule by which heaven's blessings to dispense  Unerring light of guiding providence  Others may failIf wrongly understood  How fatal is the thirst of publick good  No heavier curse almighty vengeance brings  Nor plagues nor famine nor the lust of kings  Fir'd by this rage the frantick sons of Rome  The suff'ring world to death and bondage doom  Nations must sink to raise her cumb'rous frame  And millions bleed to eternize her name  But lo her glories fade her empire's past  She madly conquer'd but to fall the last  Nor would I here the patriot's views reprove  Or damp the sacred flame of social love  Still may that portion of th' eternal ray  Sublime our sense and animate our clay  Above low self exalt th' immortal frame  And emulate that heaven from whence it came  Oh would it never be confin'd to place  But beam extensive as the human race  Be as it was design'd the world's great soul  Connect its parts and actuate the whole  So each should think himself a part alone  And for a nation's welfare stake his own  Yet farther still tho' dearest to the breast  That nation think but part of all the rest  For this let equal justice poise the ball  Her swaying force unites us all to all  Of manners worship form no diff'rence knows  Condemns our friends and saves our better foes  Confess the heavenly power nor need you fear  Lest Britain suffer while you follow her  Tho' prosp'rous crimes some daring villains raise  Nor life's short date my halting vengeance seize  A nation cannot 'scapethe destin'd rage  Pursues her ceaseless to some future age  Speeds the sure ruin from the conqueror's hand  Or spreads corruption o'er a pining land  Ask hoary time what nation is most blest  For sage experience shall this truth attest  "Where freedom sleeps secure from lawless wrath  "Where commerce shelter'd flows thro' publick faith  "Where fell ambition lights no foreign wars  "Nor discord rages with intestine jars  "Where justice reigns"Immortal were that state  If aught immortal here were giv'n by fate  Such lost Iberia were those happy reigns  When liberty sate brooding o'er thy plains  The rich in plenteous peace their stores enjoy'd  By cares unvex'd by luxury uncloy'd  Hope sooth'd the poor with promises of gain  And paid with future joys their present pain  Shew'd the full bowl amidst their sultry toil  While those who prun'd the olive drank the oil  By night of all the fruits of day possess'd  Labour softclos'd the eye and sweeten'd rest  Such was thy state all gay in nature's smiles  And such is now the state of Britain's isles  Hence o'er the ocean's waste her sail unfurl'd  Wide wafts the tribute of a willing world  Hence trusting nations treasure here their wealth  Safe from tyrannick force or legal stealth  And hence the injur'd exile doom'd to roam  Shall find his country here and dearer home  Still be this truth this saving truth confess'd  Britain is great because with freedom blest  Her prince is great because her people free  And power here springs from publick liberty  Hail mighty monarch of the free and great  Firm on the basis of a prosp'rous state  The wealth the strength of happy millions thine  United rise united shall decline  For time will come sad period of the brave  When Britain's humble prince shall rule the slave  When traffick vile shall stain the guilty throne  And kings shall buy our ruin and their own  But long O long th' inglorious doom suspend  What virtue gain'd may virtue still defend  Thrice sacred spirit never may you cease  But as you blaz'd in war shine forth in peace  Dauntless with all the force of truth engage  The headlong tide of each corrupted age  O ever wake around one favour'd throne  Nor let our guardian monarch wake alone  Tho' oft defeated and tho' oft betray'd  Numbers shall rise in sacred freedom's aid  Far as her allenlivening influence reigns  Heroick ardour beats in gen'rous veins  Now bids learn'd Greece barbarian might defy  Now the soft arts of polish'd tyranny  Now to no stock or sect or place confin'd  She takes adopted sons from human kind  While denizen'd by her eternal laws  They all are Britons who shall serve her cause  Lo to the banner crowds a youthful band  Form'd for the glorious task by nature's hand  Wisdom unclogg'd by years with toil unbought  A zeal by vigour kindl'd rul'd by thought  Such gifts she to the happy few imparts  To judging heads and to determin'd hearts  To heads unfir'd by youth's tumultuous rage  To hearts unnumb'd by the chill ice of age  And while they both preserve a sep'rate claim  Their passions reason and their reasons flame  Proceed brave youths Let others court renown  In hostile fields be yours the olive crown  And trust to fame those heroes brighter shone  Who sav'd a nation than who nations won  Nor let assuming age restrain your flight  Fearful to tempt the yet unpractis'd height  Deceitful counsel lurks in hoary hairs  And the last dregs of life are sordid cares  Objects are clear proportion'd in degree  To gen'ral use or strong necessity  Nor are two things so plainly understood  As the worst evil and the greatest good  If rescu'd from the misty breath of schools  Men will but feel without the help of rules  So unbewilder'd in the crooked maze  Where guilt low sculks and reptile cunning strays  A nation's interest and a people's rights  Distinctly shine in nature's simple lights  And claim in him who fairly acts his part  Before a Lonsdale's head a Lonsdale's heart  But chief when snatch'd by heaven's preserving hand  From the fell contests of each hostile land  A happy island to th' incircling main  Trusts for a sure support and honest gain  The just are heaven's earth is for heaven ordain'd  Form'd by its laws and by its laws maintain'd  These one true int'rest one great system frame  Political and moral are the same  Guilt toils for gain at honour's vast expence  Heaven throws the trifle in to innocence  And fixes happiness in hell's despite  The necessary consequence of right  Proceed ye deists blindfold rage employ  And prove the sacred truths ye would destroy  Prove christian faith the wisest scheme to bind  In chains of cordial love our jarring kind  And thence conclude it human if ye can  The perfect produce of imperfect man  While prostrate we adore that pow'r divine  Whose simple rule connects each great design  Bids social earth a type of heaven appear  Where justice tastes those joys which wait her there  But tho' selfint'rest follow virtue's train  Yet selfish think not virtue's end is gain  Older than time ere int'rest had a name  Justice existed and is still the same  Alike the creature's and creator's guide  His rule to form the law by which we're ty'd  In reason's light eternal word express'd  Stamp'd with his image in the creature's breast  Thus speaks the sage who skill'd in nature's laws  Deep from effects hightrac'd th' allruling cause  "Before creation was th' almighty mind  "In time's abyss the future world design'd  "Did the great system in its parts survey  "And fit the springs and regulate their play  "In meet gradations plan th' harmonious round  "Those links by which depending parts are bound  "All these he knew ere yet the things he made  "In types which well the mimick world display'd  "The types are real since from them he drew  "The real forms of whatsoe'er we view  "Made to their 'semblance heaven and earth exist  "But they unmade eternally subsist  "For if created we must sure suppose  "Some other types whence their resemblance flows  "While these on others equally depend  "Nor ever shall the long progression end  "God ere it was the future being saw  "Or blindfold made his world and gave his law  "But chance cou'd never frame the vast design  "Where countless parts in justest order join  "The types eternal just proportions teach  "Greater or less more or less perfect each  "These ever present power omniscient sees  "On them he forms his evermade decrees  "Nor can he better love what merits least  "Man than an angel or than man a beast  "Hence Reason hence immortal Order springs  "Knowledge and Love adapted to the things  "And thence th' unerring rule of justice flows  "To act what Order prompts and Reason shews  "When man in nature's purity remain'd  "By pain untroubled and by sin unstain'd  "Fair image of the God and close conjoin'd  "By innate union with the heavenly mind  "In the pure splendor of substantial light  "The beam divine of Reason bless'd his sight  "Seraphick order in its fount he view'd  "Seeing he lov'd and loving he pursu'd  "Nor dar'd the body passive slave controul  "The sovereign mandates of the ruling soul  "But soon by sin the sacred union broke  "Man bows to earth beneath the heavy yoke  "The darkling soul scarce feels a glimm'ring ray  "Shrouded in sense from her immortal day  "Vengeance divine offended Order arms  "And cloaths in terrors her celestial charms  "Now grosser objects heav'nborn souls possess  "Passions enslave and servile cares oppress  "Fraud rapine murder guilt's long horrid train  "Distracted nature's anarchy maintain  "No more pure Reason earthly minds can move  "No more can Order's charms persuasive prove  "But as the moon reflecting borrow'd day  "Sheds on our shadow'd world a feeble ray  "Some scatter'd beams of Reason law contains  "While Order's rule must be inforc'd by pains  "Hence death's black scroll dire tortures hence are given  "Hence kings the necessary curse of heaven  "And just the doom of an avenging God  "Who spurn'd his scepter feel the tyrant's rod  "Blind by our fears we meet the ills we fly  "In rule oppression want in property"  So spoke the sage and if not learn'd in vain  If spotless truth in sacred books remain  Dearly the child hath paid the parent's pride  And ill hath Law the heavenly rule supply'd  Thus boasts some leech with unavailing art  To mend the tainted lungs and wasting heart  Bids the loose springs with wonted vigour play  And sprightly juices warm in cold decay  Or wou'd imperious reason deign to own  The world not made for sovereign man alone  Some things there are for human use design'd  And these in common dealt to human kind  To mortal wants is giv'n a power to use  What to th'immortal part just heaven might well refuse  This faithful instinct in each breast implants  All know their rights for all must feel

pomp appears  And far o'er earth his tow'ring aspect rears  While prostrate crowds his sacred smiles implore  And what their crimes had form'd their fears adore  Low from beneath they lift their servile eyes  And see the proud colossus touch the skies  So at some mountain's foot have children gaz'd  While close to heaven they view the summit rais'd  Eager they mount new regions to explore  But heaven is now as distant as before  Thus views the crowd a throne while those who rise  Claim not a nearer kindred to the skies  Earth is their parent thither kings should bend  From thence they rise and not from heaven descend  Happy had all the royal sons of earth  Thus sprung nor guilt had claim'd the monst'rous birth  Where from the fire descending thro' the line  Rapine and fraud confer

Love's promis'd sweet ambition's lofty scheme  The painter's image and the poet's theme  These in fair perspective exalted high  Attract with seeming charms the distant eye  But when by envious fortune plac'd too near  Misshapen forms and grosser tints appear  Where lovely Venus led her beauteous train  Some fiend gigantick holds her monstrous reign  Crowns scepters laurels are confus'dly strow'd  A wild deform'd unmeaning heavy load  Some pleasures here with sparing hand are giv'n  That sons of earth should taste their promis'd heav'n  But what was meant to urge us to the chace  Now stops or sideway turns our devious race  Tho' still to make the destin'd course more plain  Thick are our erring paths beset with pain  Nor has one object equal charms to prove  The fitting center of our restless love  And when the great creator's will had join'd  Unequal pair the body and the mind  Lest the proud spirit should neglect her clay  He bad corporeal objects thought convey  Each strong sensation to the soul impart  Ecstatick transport or afflicting smart  By that intic'd the useful she enjoys  By this deterr'd she flies whate'er destroys  Hence from the dagger's point sharp anguish flows  And the soft couch is spread with sweet repose  In some things fails tho' gen'ral this design  For some exceptions ev'ry rule confine  Yet few were they while nature's genuine store  Supply'd our wants nor man yet sought for more  Ere diff'rent mixtures left no form the same  And vicious habits chang'd our sickly frame  Now subtle art may gild the venom'd pill  And bait with soothing sweets destructive ill  To narrow self heav'n's impulse unconfin'd  Diffusive reigns and takes in all our kind  The smile of joy reflected joy imparts  The wretch's groans pierce sympathizing hearts  Yet not alike are all conjoin'd with all  Nor throng with rival heat to nature's call  By vary'd instinct diff'rent ties are known  While love superior points to each his own  Those next the reach of our assisting hands  And those to whom we're link'd by kindred bands  Those who most want and best deserve our care  In warmer streams the sacred influence share  Ambrosial sweets her infant's lip distils  While thro' the mother's heart quick rapture thrills  The social fires friend servant neighbour claim  Which blaze collected in the patriot's flame  Hence Britain throbs superior in thy foul  Nor idly wak'st thou for the distant pole  Yet farther still the saving instinct moves  And to the future wide extends our loves  Glows in our bosom for an unborn race  And warms us mutual to the kind embrace  For this to man was giv'n the graceful air  For this was woman form'd divinely fair  But now to pleasure sensual views confin'd  Reach not the use for which it was design'd  To this one point our hopes our wishes tend  And thus mistake the motive for the end  Whate'er sensations from enjoyment flow  Our erring thought to matter's force would owe  To that ascribe our pleasures and our pains  And blindly for the cause mistake the means  In od'rous meads the vernal gale we praise  Or dread the storm that plows the wintry seas  While he's unheeded who alone can move  Claims all our fears and merits all our love  Alone to souls can sense and thought convey  Thro' the dark mansions of surrounding clay  Man part from heav'n and part from humble earth  A motley substance takes his various birth  Close link'd to both he hangs in diff'rent chains  The pliant fetter length'ning as he strains  If bravely conscious of her native fires  To the bold height his nobler frame aspires  Near as she soars to join th' approaching skies  Our earth still lessens to her distant eyes  But if o'erpois'd she sinks her downward course  Each moment weighs with still augmenting force  Low and more low the burden'd spirit bends  While weaker still each heav'nly link extends  Till prostrate grov'ling fetter'd to the ground  She lies in matter's heap o'erwhelm'd and bound  Wrapt in the toils of sin just heav'n employs  What caus'd her guilt to blast her lawless joys  Love potent guardian of our length'ning race  Unnerves the feeble letcher's cold embrace  And appetite by nature giv'n to save  Sinks the gorg'd glutton in his early grave  What sends you fleet o'er boist'rous seas to roll  Beneath the burning line and frozen pole  Why ravage men the hills the plains the woods  Why spoil all nature earth and air and floods  Seek they some prize to help a sinking state  Nothis must all be done ere  A Frenchman render'd famous by a most extravagant expence in eating  Bernard eat  Tell it some untaught savage with surprize  He asks "How vast must be that giant's size  "How great his pow'r who thousands can employ  "How great his force who millions can destroy"  But if the savage would more curious know  What potent virtues from such viands flow  What blest effects they causeconsult with Sloane  Let him explain the colick gout and stone  Pleasure's for use it differs in degree  Proportion'd to the thing's necessity  Hence various objects variously excite  And diff'rent is the date of each delight  But when th' alloted end we once attain  Each step beyond it is a step to pain  Nor let us murmurHath not earth a store  For ev'ry want it was not meant for more  Blest is the man as far as earth can bless  Whose measur'd passions reach no wild excess  Who urg'd by nature's voice her gifts enjoys  Nor other means than nature's force employs  While warm with youth the sprightly current flows  Each vivid sense with vig'rous rapture glows  And when he droops beneath the hand of age  No vicious habit stings with fruitless rage  Gradual his strength and gay sensations cease  While joys tumultuous sink in silent peace  Far other is his lot who not content  With what the bounteous care of nature meant  With labour'd skill would all her joys dilate  Sublime their sense and lengthen out their date  Add blend compose each various mixture try  And wind up appetite to luxury  Thus guilty art unknown desires implants  And viler arts must satisfy their wants  When to corruption by himself betray'd  Gold binds the slave whom luxury has made  The hand that form'd us must some use intend  It gives us pow'rs proportion'd to that end  And happiness may justly be defin'd  A full attainment of the end design'd  Virtue and wisdom this alike implies  And blest must be the virtuous and the wise  Bliss is ordain'd for all since heav'n intends  All beings should attain their destin'd ends  For this the fair idea shines confess'd  To ev'ry mind and glows in ev'ry breast  Compar'd with this all mortal joys are vain  Inspir'd by this we restless onward strain  High tho' we mount the object mounts more high  Eludes our grasp and mingles with the sky  With nothing less th' aspiring soul's content  For nothing less her gen'rous flame was meant  Th' unerring rule which all our steps should guide  The certain test by which true good is try'd  Blest when we reach it wretched while we miss  Our joys our sorrows prove there must be bliss  Nor can this be some visionary dream  Where heated fancy forms the flatt'ring scheme  There sure is blisselse why by all desir'd  What guileful pow'r has the mad search inspir'd  Could accident produce in all the same  Or a vain shadow raise a real flame  When nature in the world's distended space  Or fill'd or almost fill'd each smaller place  Careful in meanest matter to produce  Each single motion for some certain use  Hard was the lot of her first fav'rite man  Faulty the scheme of his contracted span  If that alone must know an useless void  And he feel longings ne'er to be enjoy'd  That only can produce consummate joy  Which equals all the pow'rs it would employ  Such fitting object to each talent giv'n  Earth cannot fit what was design'd for heav'n  Why then is man with gifts sublimest fraught  An active will and comprehensive thought  For what is all this waste of mental force  What for a house a coach a dog a horse  Has nature's lord inverted nature's plan  Is man now made for what was made for man  There must be pleasures past the reach of sense  Some nobler source must happiness dispense  Reason arise and vindicate thy claim  Flash on our minds the joyinfusing flame  Pour forth the fount of light whose endless store  Thought drinks insatiate while it thirsts for more  And thou seraphick flame who could'st inspire  The prophet's voice and wrap his soul in fire  Ray of th' eternal beam who canst pervade  The distant past and future's gloomy shade  While trembling reason tempts heav'n's dazzling height  Sublime her force and guide her dubious flight  Strengthen'd by thee she bears the streaming blaze  And drinks new light from truth's immortal rays  Great only evidence of things divine  By thee reveal'd the mystick wonders shine  What puzzled sophists vainly would explore  What humbled pride in silence must adore  What plainly mark'd in heav'n's deliver'd page  Makes the taught hind more wise than Greece's sage  Yet reason proves thee in her low degree  And owns thy truths from their necessity  Conspicuous now is happiness display'd  Possessing him for whom alone we're made  For he alone all human bliss compleats  To him alone th' expanding bosom beats  Who fills each faculty each pow'r can move  Exerts all thought and deep absorbs all love  Whose ceaseless being years would tell in vain  Whose attributes immense all bounds disdain  No sickly tastes the heav'nly rapture cloys  No weary'd senses sink in whelming joys  While rais'd above low matter's grosser frame  Pure spirit blazes in his purer flame  Such are th' immortal blessings that attend  The just and good the patriot and the friend  Nor such alone in distant prospect chear  They taste heav'n's joys anticipated here  These in the smiling cup of pleasure flow  Or mingling sooth the bitter stream of woe  These pay the loss of honours and of place  And teach that guilt alone is true disgrace  These with the glorious exile cheerful rove  And far from courts fresh bloom in Curio's grove  Long may such bliss by such enjoy'd attest  The greatly virtuous are the greatly blest  Enough there are amidst yon gorgeous train  Who wretched prove all other joys are vain  So shines the truth these humble lines unfold  "Fair virtue ever is unwisely sold"  Too mean a price sublimest fortune brings  Too mean the wealth the smiles the crowns of kings  Far rais'd o'er these she makes our bliss secure  The present pleasing and the future sure  While prosp'rous guilt a sad reverse appears  And in the tasteless now the future fears  An EPISTLE to a LADY  By the Same  CLarinda dearly lov'd attend  The counsels of a faithful friend  Who with the warmest wishes fraught  Feels all at least that friendship ought  But since by ruling heav'n's design  Another's fate shall influence thine  O may these lines for him prepare  A bliss which I wou'd die to share  Man may for wealth or glory roam  But woman must be blest at home  To this shou'd all her studies tend  This her great object and her end  Distaste unmingled pleasures bring  And use can blunt affliction's sting  Hence perfect bliss no mortals know  And few are plung'd in utter woe  While nature arm'd against despair  Gives pow'r to mend or strength to bear  And half the thought content may gain  Which spleen employs to purchase pain  Trace not the fair domestick plan  From what you wou'd but what you can  Nor peevish spurn the scanty store  Because you think you merit more  Bliss ever differs in degree  Thy share alone is meant for thee  And thou shou'dst think however small  That share enough for 'tis thy all  Vain scorn will aggravate distress  And only make that little less  Admit whatever trifles come  Units compose the largest sum  O tell them o'er and say how vain  Are those which form ambition's train  Which swell the monarch's gorgeous state  And bribe to ill the guilty great  But thou more blest more wise than these  Shalt build up happiness on ease  Hail sweet content where joy serene  Gilds the mild soul's unruffled scene  And with blith fancy's pencil wrought  Spreads the white web of flowing thought  Shines lovely in the chearful face  And cloaths each charm with native grace  Effusion pure of bliss sincere  A vestment for a god to wear  Far other ornaments compose  The garb that shrouds dissembled woes  Piec'd out with motley dies and sorts  Freaks whimsies festivals and sports  The troubled mind's fantastick dress  Which madness titles happiness  While the gay wretch to revels bears  The pale remains of sighs and tears  And seeks in crouds like her undone  What only can be found in one  But chief my gentle friend remove  Far from thy couch seducing love  O shun the false magician's art  Nor trust thy yet unguarded heart  Charm'd by his spels fair honour flies  And thousand treach'rous phantoms rise  Where guilt in beauty's ray beguiles  And ruin lurks in friendship's smiles  Lo where th' enchanted captive dreams  Of warbling groves and purling streams  Of painted meads of flow'rs that shed  Their odours round her fragrant bed  Quick shifts the scene the charm is lost  She wakes upon a desert coast  No friendly hand to lend its aid  N  dian bow'r to spread its shade  Expos'd to ev'ry chilling blast  She treads th' inhospitable waste  And down the drear decline of life  Sinks a forlorn dishonour'd wife  Neglect not thou the voice of fame  But clear from crime be free from blame  Tho' all were innocence within  'Tis guilt to wear the garb of sin  Virtue rejects the foul disguise  None merit praise who praise despise  Slight not in supercilious strain  Long practis'd modes as low or vain  The world will vindicate their cause  And claim blind faith in custom's laws  Safer with multitudes to stray  Than tread alone a fairer way  To mingle with the erring throng  Than boldly speak ten millions wrong  Beware of the relentless train  Who forms adore whom forms maintain  Lest prudes demure or coxcombs loud  Accuse thee to the partial croud  Foes who the laws of honour slight  A judge who measures guilt by spite  Behold the sage Aurelia stand  Disgrace and fame at her command  As if heaven's delegate design'd  Sole arbiter of all her kind  Whether she try some favour'd piece  By rules devis'd in ancient Greece  Or whether modern in her flight  She tells what Paris thinks polite  For much her talents to advance  She study'd Greece and travel'd France  There learn'd the happy art to please  With all the charms of labour'd ease  Thro' looks and nods with meaning fraught  To teach what she was never taught  By her each latent spring is seen  The workings foul of secret spleen  The guilt that sculks in fair pretence  Or folly veil'd in specious sense  And much her righteous spirit grieves  When worthlessness the world deceives  Whether the erring croud commends  Some patriot sway'd by private ends  Or husband trust a faithless wife  Secure in ignorance from strife  Averse she brings their deeds to view  But justice claims the rig'rous due  Humanely anxious to produce  At least some possible excuse  O ne'er may virtue's dire disgrace  Prepare a triumph for the base  Meer forms the fool implicit sway  Which witlings with contempt survey  Blind folly no defect can see  Half wisdom views but one degree  The wise remoter uses reach  Which judgment and experience teach  Whoever wou'd be pleas'd and please  Must do what others do with ease  Great precept undefin'd by rule  And only learn'd in custom's school  To no peculiar form confin'd  It spreads thro' all the human kind  Beauty and wit and worth supplies  Yet graceful in the good and wise  Rich with this gift and none beside  In fashion's stream how many glide  Secure from ev'ry mental woe  From treach'rous friend or open foe  From social sympathy that shares  The publick loss or private cares  Whether the barb'rous foe invade  Or merit pine in fortune's shade  Hence gentle Anna ever gay  The same tomorrow as today  Save where perchance when others weep  Her cheek the decent sorrow steep  Save when perhaps a melting tale  O'er ev'ry tender breast prevail  The good the bad the great the small  She likes she loves she honours all  And yet if sland'rous malice blame  Patient she yields a sister's fame  Alike if satyr or if praise  She says whate'er the circle says  Implicit does whate'er we do  Without one point or wish in view  Sure test of others faithful glass  Thro' which the various phantoms pass  Wide blank unfeeling when alone  No care no joy no thought her own  Not thus succeeds the peerless dame  Who looks and talks and acts for fame  Intent so wide her cares extend  To make the universe her friend  Now with the gay in frolicks shines  Now reasons deep with deep divines  With courtiers now extols the great  With patriots sighs o'er Britain's fate  Now breathes with zealots holy fires  Now melts in less refin'd desires  Doom'd to exceed in each degree  Too wise too weak too proud too free  Too various for one single word  The high sublime of deep absurd  While ev'ry talent nature grants  Just serves to shew how much she wants  Altho' incombine  The virtues of our sex and thine  Her hand restrains the widow's tears  Her sense informs and sooths and cheers  Yet like an angel in disguise  She shines but to some favour'd eyes  Nor is the distant herd allow'd  To view the radiance thro' the cloud  But thine is ev'ry winning art  Thine is the friendly honest heart  And shou'd the gen'rous spirit flow  Beyond where prudence fears to go  Such sallies are of nobler kind  Than virtues of a narrow mind  An EPISTLE to Mr POPE  By the Same  HEAVEN in the human breast implants  Fit appetites for all our wants  With hunger prompts to strength'ning food  With love of praise to publick good  These to their object straight convey  While reason winds her tardy way  Yet in one center should unite  Faith instinct reason appetite  One perfect plan ordain'd to trace  And nature dignify with grace  In one great system meant to roll  To move support and guide the whole  But some there are who rigid blame  The mind that thirsts for righteous Fame  And with weak lights presumptuous scan  The springs which move predestin'd man  And some there are accurs'd their art  Tho' all the nine their charms impart  Who in false forms of great and just  Cloath av'rice treach'ry rage and lust  As if superior beings suit  Those attributes which sink the brute  But vainly chime the partial lays  Chaste fame rejects all spurious praise  She fairest offspring of the skies  The goddess of the brave and wise  Whose sacred impulse prompts the best  To succour and preserve the rest  Is deaf to ev'ry private call  And wakes but at the voice of all  From heaps of illcollected gain  From hecatombs by heroes slain  From courts where guilty greatness dwelle  She flys to penury and cells  With Erskine pious exile goes  To sooth a drooping father's woes  Or mingling with the orphantrain  She sings the bounties of Germain  Nor pow'r nor policy of state  Can ever give intrinsick weight  And shou'd fallacious art display  O'er titled dross a golden ray  Still baser thro' detecting years  The speckled counterfeit appears  But when from proof fair issuing forth  The ore asserts its native worth  Then sov'reign bard 'tis justly thine  To stamp the well attested coin  And consecrated with thy name  To treasure in the stores of fame  EPISTLE to  POLLIO  from the Hills of  Howth  in  Ireland  By the Same  POLLIO would'st thou condescend  Here to see thy humble friend  Far from doctors potions pills  Drinking health on native hills  Thou the precious draught may'st share  Lucy shall the bowl prepare  From the brousing goat it flows  From each balmy shrub that grows  Hence the kidling's wanton fire  Hence the nerves that brace his sire  Vigorous buxome young and gay  Thou like them shalt love and play  What tho' far from silver Thames  Stately piles and courtly dames  Here we boast a purer flood  Joys that stream from sprightly blood  Here is simple beauty seen  Fair and cloath'd like beauty's queen  Nature's hands the garbs compose  From the lilly and the rose  Or if charm'd with richer dies  Fancy every robe supplies  Shou'd perchance some highborn fair  Absent claim thy tender care  Here enraptur'd shall thou trace  S's shape and R's face  While the waking dream shall pay  Many a wishing hopeless day  Domes with gold and toil unbought  Rise by magick pow'r of thought  Where by artist's hand undrawn  Slopes the vale and spreads the lawn  As if sportive nature meant  Here to mock the works of Kent  Come and with thee bring along  Jocund tale and witty song  Sense to teach and words to move  Arts that please adorn improve  And to gild the glorious scene  Conscience spotless and serene  Poor with all a Ht's store  Lives the man who pines for more  Wretched he who doom'd to roam  Never can be blest at home  Nor retire within his mind  From th' ungrateful and unkind  Happy they whom crouds befriend  Curs'd who on the croud depend  On the great

resort  To the viceroy's splendid court  There indignant shalt thou see  Cringing slaves who might be free  Brib'd with titles hope or gain  Tye their country's shameful chain  Or inspir'd by heav'n's good cause  Waste the land with holy laws  While the gleanings of their power  Lawyers lordlings priests devour  Now methinks I hear thee say  "Drink alone thy mountainwhey  "Wherefore tempt the Irish

by dark creeds and mystick law  Wrapt up in reverential awe  I bow'd to priests and kings  II  Soon reason dawn'd with troubled sight  I caught the glimpse of painful light  Afflicted and afraid  Too weak it shone to mark my way  Enough to tempt my steps to stray  Along the dubious shade  III  Restless I roam'd when from afar  LO HOOKER shines the friendly star  Sends forth a steady ray  Thus cheer'd and eager to pursue  I mount till glorious to my view  LOCKE spreads the realms of day  IV  Now warm'd with noble SIDNEY's page  I pant with all the patriot's rage  Now wrapt in PLATO's dream  With MORE and HARRINGTON around  I tread fair freedom's magick ground  And trace the flatt'ring scheme  V  But soon the beauteous vision flies  And hideous spectres now arise  Corruption's direful train  The partial judge perverting laws  The priest forsaking virtue's cause  And senates slaves to gain  VI  Vainly the pious artist's toil  Would rear to heaven a mortal pile  On some immortal plan  Within a sure tho' varying date  Confin'd alas is every state  Of empire and of man  VII  What tho' the good the brave the wise  With adverse force undaunted rise  To break th' eternal doom  Tho' CATO liv'd tho' TULLY spoke  Tho' BRUTUS dealt the godlike stroke  Yet perish'd fated ROME  VIII  To swell some future tyrant's pride  Good FLEURY pours the golden tide  On Gallia's smiling shores  Once more her fields shall thirst in vain  For wholesome streams of honest gain  While rapine wastes her stores  IX  Yet glorious is the great design  And such O PULTNEY such is thine  To prop a nation's frame  If crush'd beneath the sacred weight  The ruins of a falling state  Shall tell the patriot's name  An ODE to the Right Honourable the Lord LONSDALE  By the Same  I  LONSDALE thou everhonour'd name  For such is sacred virtue's claim  Say why my noble friend  While nature sheds her balmy powers  O'er hill and dale in leaves and flowers  Say why my joys suspend  II  Here spreads the lawn highcrown'd with wood  Here slopes the vale there twines the flood  In many a crystal maze  The fishes sport in silver pride  Slow moves the swan on either side  The herds promiscuous graze  III  Or if the stiller shade you love  Here solemn nods th' imbow'ring grove  O'er innocence and ease  Whether with deep reflection fraught  Or in the sprightly stream of thought  The lighter trifles please  IV  Alluding to a certain scandalous libel  And should the shaft of treacherous spleen  Glance venom'd through this peacesul scene  Unheeded may it fly  Provok'd not tempted to repay  Tho' truth severer prompt the lay  A mean prosaick lie  V  Here with the pheasant and the hare  Unfearful of the human snare  Have statesmen pass'd a day  While far from you forbidden gate  Pale care and

lethargic rest  On blessings unenjoy'd  VII  But come my friend the sun invites  For thee the town hath no delights  Distasted and aggriev'd  While fools believe while villains cheat  Too honest to approve deceit  Too wise to be deceiv'd  VIII  Or dost thou fear lest dire disease  Again thy tortur'd frame may seize  And hast thou therefore stay'd  O rather haste where thou shalt find  A ready hand a gentle mind  To comfort and to aid  IX  And while by sore afflictions try'd  You bear without the Stoic's pride  What Stoic never bore  O may I learn like thee to bear  And what shall be my destin'd share  To suffer not explore  An ODE  By the Same  GENTLE idle trifling boy  Sing of pleasures sing of joy  Well you paint the crystal spring  Well the flow'ry meadow sing  But beware with bolder flight  Tempt not heaven's unequal height  But beware with impious strain  Mock not virtue's hallow'd train  Sacred here O ever be  Heaven and heavenborn liberty  Let the slaves of lawless sway  Let the stupid flock obey  Pent within a narrow fold  Ty'd and stript and slain and sold  Happier stars the brave befriend  Britons know a nobler end  Theirs it is to temper laws  Theirs to watch in freedom's cause  Theirs one common good to share  Theirs to feel one common care  In the glorious task combin'd  From the monarch to the hind  Yet O cease not gentle boy  Sing of pleasures sing of joy  Like thy brothers of the wing  Idly hop and chirp and sing  Heaven can nothing vain produce  Ev'ry creature has its use  Thine it is to sooth our toil  Thine to make e'en wisdom smile  Much they err who such despise  Trifles please the truly wise  An ODE  By the Same  I  ON Stow the muse's happy theme  Let fancy's eye enamour'd gaze  Where thro' one nobly simple scheme  Ten thousand varying beauties please  There patriotvirtue rears her shrine  Nor love art thou depriv'd of thine  II  Mark where from POPE's exhaustless vein  Pure flows the stream of copious thought  While nature pours the genial strain  With fairest springs of learning fraught  The treasures of each clime and age  Grace and enrich his sacred page  III  So while thro' Britain's fields her Thames  Prolifick rolls his silver tide  The tribute of a thousand streams  Swells the majestick river's pride  And where his gen'rous current strays  The wealth of either world conveys  IV  Far other is that wretch's song  Whose scanty rill devoid of force  With idle tincklings creeps along  A narrow crooked dubious course  Or foul with congregated floods  Spreads a wide waste o'er plains and woods  V  In action thus the mind express'd  High soars in Pope the true sublime  A Stow unfolds a Cobham's breast  A Bavius crawls in doggrel rhyme  Thro' all their various works we trace  The greatly virtuous and the base  An ODE  By the Same  I  TOO anxious for the publick weal  A while suspend the toilsome strife  O think if Britain claims thy zeal  Thy friends and Britain claim thy life  II  Thy gen'rous free and active soul  Inspir'd by glory's sacred flame  Springs ardent to the distant goal  And strains the weaker mortal frame  III  Happy whom reason deigns to guide  Secure within the golden mean  Who shuns the Stoic's senseless pride  Nor wallows with the herd obscene  IV  He nor with brow severely bent  Chides pleasure's smiling train away  Nor careless of life's great intent  With folly wastes each heedless day  V  But from the mountain's lofty height  Now nature's mighty frame surveys  And now descending with delight  Along the humble valley strays  VI  So have I seen thee gain applause  Tho' faction rag'd from Britain's peers  Then glorious in thy country's cause  Go whisper love in Chloe's ears  An ODE to MANKIND  Address'd to the PRINCE  By the same  INTRODUCTION to the PRINCE  NOR me the glories of thy birth engage  With royal names to swell my pompous page  Nor meaner views allure in soothing lays  To court thy favour with officious praise  Yet praise it is thus to address thine ear  In strains no slave dares sing no tyrant hear  While warm for Britain's rights and nature's laws  I call forth Britain's HOPE in freedom's cause  Assert an empire which to ALL belongs  And vindicate a world's longsuffer'd wrongs  These saving truths import thee most to know  The links that tie the mighty to the low  What now our fellowsubject is your due  And when our lord shall be a debt on you  O may'st thou to the throne such maxims bring  And feel the freeman while thou reign'st the king  Far hence the tribe whose servile arts delude  And teach the great to spurn the multitude  Are those unworthy of the royal heir  Who claim the future monarch's duteous care  Still may thy thoughts the godlike task pursue  And to the many ne'er prefer the few  Still mayst thou fly thy fortune's specious friends  Who deal forth sov'reign grace to private ends  In narrow streams divert the copious tide  Exalt one sect and damn the world beside  While with false lights directing partial rule  The lord of nations falls a party's tool  Such there have beenand such in truth's despite  Disgrac'd the cause of liberty and right  But thou shalt rise superior to their arts  And fix thy empire in a people's hearts  Nor hence may faction boast her favour'd claim  Where selfish passions borrow virtue's name  Free government alone preserves the free  And righteous rule is gen'ral liberty  There guiding law is freedom's native voice  The publick good defin'd by publick choice  And justly should the bold offenders fall  Who dare invade the sov'reign rights of all  A king who proudly makes these claims his own  Or they whose rage would shake a lawful throne  From truths like these proceeds a right divine  And may the power that rais'd preserve thy scepter'd line  To MANKIND An ODE  I  IS there or do the schoolmen dream  Is there on earth a pow'r supreme  The delegate of heav'n  To whom an uncontroul'd command  In ev'ry realm o'er sea and land  By special grace is giv'n  II  Then say what signs this god proclaim  Dwells he amidst the diamonds flame  A throne his hallow'd shrine  The borrow'd pomp the arm'd array  Want Fear and Impotence betray  Strange proofs of pow'r divine  III  If service due from human kind  To men in slothful ease reclin'd  Can form a sov'reign's claim  Hail monarchs ye whom heav'n ordains  Our toils unshar'd to share our gains  Ye ideots blind and lame  IV  Superior virtue wisdom might  Create and mark the ruler's right  So reason must conclude  Then thine it is to whom belong  The wise the virtuous and the strong  Thrice sacred multitude  V  In thee vast ALL are these contain'd  For thee are those thy parts ordain'd  So nature's systems roll  The scepter's thine if such there be  If none there is then thou art free  Great monarch mighty whole  VI  Let the proud tyrant rest his cause  On faith prescription force or laws  An host's or senate's voice  His voice affirms thy stronger due  Who for the many made the few  And gave the species choice  VII  Unsanctify'd by thy command  Unown'd by thee the scepter'd hand  The trembling slave may bind  But loose from nature's moral ties  The oath by force impos'd belies  The unassenting mind  VIII  Thy will's thy rule thy good its end  You punish only to defend  What parent nature gave  And he who dares her gifts invade  By nature's oldest law is made  Thy victim or

Where all the lazy moments crept  And every passion sluggish slept  I wish'd for love's inspiring pains  To rouze the loiterer in my veins  Th' officious power my call attends  He who uncall'd his succour lends  And with a smile of wanton spite  He gave Camilla to my sight  Her eyes their willing captive seize  Her look her air her manner please  New beauties please unseen before  Or seen in her they please me more  And soon too soon alas I find  The virtues of a nobler kind  Now cheerful springs the morning ray  Now cheerful sinks the closing day  For every morn with her I walk'd  And every eve with her I talk'd  With her I lik'd the vernal bloom  With her I lik'd the crouded room  From her at night I went with pain  And long'd for morn to meet again  How quick the smiling moments pass  Thro' varying fancy's magick glass  While the gay scene is painted o'er  Where all was one wide blank before  And sweetly sooth'd th' inchanting dream  Till love inspir'd a bolder scheme  Camilla stung with grief and shame  Now marks and shuns the guilty flame  Fierce anger lighten'd in her face  Then cold reserve assum'd its place  And soon the wretches hardest fate  Contempt succeeds declining hate  No more my presence now she flies  She sees me with unheeding eyes  Sees me with various passion burn  Enrag'd depart submiss return  Return with flattering hopes to find  Soft pity move her gentler mind  But ah her looks were still the same  Unmark'd I went unmark'd I came  Unmark'd were all my hopes and fears  While Strephon whispers in her ears  O jealousy distracting guest

welcome guest  Not such she look'd as when by day  She blazes in the diamond's ray  And adding to each gem a grace  Gives India's wealth the second place  But softreclin'd in careless ease  More pleasing less intent to please  Loose flow'd her hair in wanton pride  Her robe unbound her zone unty'd  Half bare to view her milkwhite breast  A slender vail scarce shades the rest  Her eye with sparkling lustre glows  And wit in sweetest accent flows  Now sooth'd the angel's voice I hear  And drink in love at either ear  Now stung with wilder rapture gaze  While our eyes meet with blended rays  And kindling in th' infectious flame  I feel what words want pow'r to name  Awaking from the silent trance  Cautious I steal a broken glance  In clam'rous mirth each pang disguise  And laughter swell with bursting sighs  For envy pallid fiend was there  And jealousy with watchful care  Now ends the feast each guest retires  And with them all my soul desires  Clarissa goesAh cruel fate  She goes with her illsorted mate  Sullen and slow he moves along  And heavy hums a drowsy song  O drowsy may the monster lye  And instant slumbers seal his eye  So shalt thou best belov'd escape  The

press the joyless bed  And lye in cold indiff'rence dead  Nor let the blasting spoiler sip  The fragrance of thy balmy lip  To share with him the lover's part  Were rank adultery of the heart  But if in chaster love's despite  Warm nature catch the known delight  While fierce desires tumultuous rise  And rapture melts thy closing eyes  Ah be those joys for me design'd  And let me rush upon thy mind  To me the burning kiss impart  On me impress the humid dart  For me unlock the nectar'd store  Then sigh and dream the transport o'er  Thus with her lov'd idea fraught  Delusive fancy charms my thought  And joining in the flatt'ring cheat  Willing I hug the dear deceit  From fiction real bliss receive  And all I fondly wish believe  Nor envy to a husband's arms  The dull fruition of her charms  But when regardless of my truth  She smiles on some more favour'd youth  And while he whispers in her ears  With more than wonted pleasure hears  My jealous thought his voice supplies  And

DANGER of Writing VERSE An EPISTLE  By Mr W WHITEHEAD of Clarehall in Cambridge  Quae poterant unquam satis expurgare cicutae  Ni melius dormire putem quam scribere versus  HOR Ep z Lib  YOU ask me sir why thus by phantoms aw'd  No kind occasion tempts the muse abroad  Why when retirement sooths this idle art  To fame regardless sleeps the youthful heart  'Twou'd wrong your judgment shou'd I fairly say  Distrust or weakness caus'd the cold delay  Hint the small diff'rence till we touch the lyre  'Twixt real genius and too strong desire  The human slips or seeming slips pretend  That rouse the critick but escape the friend  Nay which tho' dreadful when the foe pursues  You'd pass and smile and still provoke the muse  Yet spite of all you think or kindly feign  My hand will tremble while it grasps the pen  For not in this like other arts we try  Our light excursions in a summer sky  No casual flights the dang'rous trade admits  But wits once authors are for ever wits  The fool in prose like earth's unwieldy son  May oft rise vig'rous tho' he's oft o'erthrown  One dang'rous crisis marks our rise or fall  By all we're courted or we're shunn'd by all  What will't avail that unmatur'd by years  My easy numbers pleas'd your partial ears  If now condemn'd my riper lays must bear  The wise man's censure and the critick's sneer  Or still more hard ev'n where he's valu'd most  The man must suffer if the poet's lost  For wanting wit be totally undone  And barr'd all arts for having fail'd in one  When fears like these his serious thoughts engage  No bugbear phantom curbs the poet's rage  'Tis pow'rful reason holds the streighten'd rein  While flutt'ring fancy to the distant plain  Sends a long look and spreads her wings in vain  But grant for once th' officious muse has shed  Her gentlest influence on his infant head  Let fears lie vanquish'd and resounding fame  Give to the bellowing blast the poet's name  And see distinguish'd from the croud he moves  Each finger marks him and each eye approves  Secure as Halcyons brooding o'er the deep  The waves roll gently and the thunders sleep  Obsequious nature binds the tempest's wings  And pleas'd attention listens whilst he sings  O blissful state O more than human joy  What shafts can reach him or what cares annoy  What cares my friend why all that man can know  Oppress'd with real or with fancy'd woe  Rude to the world like earth's first lord expell'd  To climes unknown from Eden's safer field  No more eternal springs around him breathe  Black air scowls o'er him deadly damps beneath  Now must he learn misguided youth to bear  Each varying season of the poet's year  Flatt'ry's full beam detraction's wintry store  The frowns of fortune or the pride of pow'r  His acts his words his thoughts no more his own  Each folly blazon'd and each frailty known  Is he reserv'dhis sense is so refin'd  It ne'erdescends to trifle with mankind  Open and freethey find the secret cause  Is vanity and courts the world's applause  Nay tho' he speak not something still is seen  Each change of face betrays a fault within  If grave 'tis spleen he smiles but to deride  And downright aukwardness in him is pride  Thus must he steer thro' fame's uncertain seas  Now sunk by censure and now puff'd by praise  Contempt with envy strangely mix'd endure  Fear'd where caress'd and jealous tho' secure  One fatal rock on which good authors split  Is thinking all mankind must like their wit  And the grand business of the world stand still  To listen to the dictates of their quill  Hurt if they fail and yet how few succeed  What's born in leisure men of leisure read  And half of those have some peculiar whim  Their test of sense and read but to condemn  Besides on parties now our fame depends  And frowns or smiles as these are foes or friends  Wit judgment nature join you strive in vain  'Tis keen invective stamps the current strain  Fix'd to one side like Homer's gods we fight  These always wrong and these for ever right  And would you chuse to see your friend resign'd  Each conscious tie that guides the virtuous mind  Embroil'd in factions hurl with dreaded skill  The random vengeance of his desp'rate quill  'Gainst pride in man with equal pride declaim  And hide ill nature under virtue's name  Or deeply vers'd in flattery's wily ways  Flow in full reams of undistinguish'd praise  To vice's grave or folly's bust bequeath  The blushing trophy and indignant wreath  Qui nescit qualia demens  Aegyptus portenta colat crocodilon adorat  JUV Sat  Like Aegypt's priests bid endless temples rise  And people with earth's pests th' offended skies  The muse of old her native freedom knew  And wild in air the sportive wand'rer flew  On worth alone her bays eternal strow'd  And found the heroe ere she hymn'd the god  Nor less the chief her kind support return'd  No drooping muse her slighted labours mourn'd  But stretch'd at ease she prun'd her growing wings  By sages honour'd and advanc'd by kings  Ev'n knowing Greece confess'd her early claim  And warlike Latium caught the gen'rous flame  Not so our age regards the tuneful tongue  'Tis senseless rapture all and empty song  No Pollio sheds his genial influence round  No Varus listens whilst the groves resound  Ev'n those who most the muse's charms admire  Wou'd scorn th' assistance of so weak a fire  They ask not fame precarious lays can give  In ev'ry breast their treasur'd forms shall live  Their widely blazon'd deeds themselves rehearse  And virtue shines without the pomp of verse  Yet let ev'n these be taught in mystick rhyme  'Tis verse alone arrests the wings of Time  Bacon de augmentis scientiarum  Fast to the thread of life annex'd by fame  A sculptur'd medal bears each human name  O'er Lethe's streams the fatal threads depend  Th' glitt'ring medal trembles as they bend  Close but the shears when chance or nature calls  The birds of rumour catch it as it falls  A while from bill to bill the trifle's tost  The waves receive it and 'tis ever lost  But should the meanest swan that cuts the stream  Consign'd to Phoebus catch the favour'd name  Safe in her mouth she bears the sacred prize  To where bright Fame's eternal altars rise  'Tis there the muse's friends true laurels wear  There  Ptolemy Philadelphus  Aegypt's monarch reigns and great Augustus there  But why round patrons climb th' ambitious bays  Is interest then the sordid spur to praise  Persius  Shall the same cause that prompts the chatt'ring jay  To aim at words inspire the poet's lay  And is there nothing in the boasted claim  Of living labours and a deathless name  The pictur'd front with sacred fillets bound  The sculptur'd bust with laurels wreath'd around  The annual roses scatter'd o'er his urn  And tears to flow from poets yet unborn  Illustrious all but sure to merit these  Demands at least the poet's learned case  Say can the bard attempt what's truly great  That pants in secret for his future fate  Him serious toils and humbler arts engage  To make youth easy and provide for age  While lost in silence hangs his useless lyre  And tho' from heav'n it came fast dies the sacred fire  Or grant true genius with superior force  Bursts ev'ry bond resistless in its course  Yet lives the man how wild soe'er his aim  Would madly barter fortune's smiles for fame  Or distant hopes of future case forego  For all the wreaths that all the nine bestow  Well pleas'd to shine thro' each recording page  The hapless Dryden of a shameless age  Illfated bard wheree'er thy name appears  The weeping verse a sad memento bears  Ah what avail'd th' enormous blaze between  Thy dawn of glory and thy closing scene  When sinking nature asks our kind repairs  Unstrung the nerves and silver'd o'er the hairs  When stay'd reflection comes uncall'd at last  And grey experience counts each folly past  Untun'd and harsh the sweetest strains appear  And loudest Paeans but fatigue the ear  'Tis true the man of verse tho' born to ills  Too oft deserves the very fate he feels  When vainly frequent at the great man's board  He shares in ev'ry vice with ev'ry lord  Makes to their taste his sober sense submit  And 'gainst his reason madly arms his wit  Heav'n but in justice turns their serious heart  To scorn the wretch whose life belies his art  He only he shou'd haunt the muse's grove  Whom youth might rev'rence and grey hairs approve  Whilst virtue's lore adorns his decent tongue  Pure as his breast and as his numbers strong  For him wou'd PLATO change their gen'ral fate  And own one poet might improve his state  Curs'd be their verse and blasted all their bays  Whose sensual lure th' unconscious ear betrays  Wounds the young breast ere virtue spreads her shield  And takes not wins the scarce disputed field  Tho' specious rhet'rick each loose thought refine  Tho' musick charm'd in ev'ry labour'd line  The dang'rous verse to full perfection grown  BAVIUS might blush and QUARLES disdain to own  Shou'd some MACHAON whose sagacious soul  Trac'd blushing nature to her inmost goal  Skill'd in each drug the varying world provides  All earth embosoms and all ocean hides  Nor cooling herb nor healing balm supply  Ease the swoln breast or close the languid eye  But exquisitely ill awake disease  And arm with poisons ev'ry baleful breeze  What racks what tortures must his crimes demand  The more than BORGIA of a bleeding land  And is less guilty he whose shameless page  Not to the present bounds its subtil rage  But spreads contagion wide and stains a future age  Forgive me Sir that thus the moral strain  With indignation warm'd rejects the rein  Nor think I rove regardless of my theme  'Tis hence new dangers clog the paths to fame  Not to themselves alone such bards confine  Fame's just reproach for virtue's injur'd shrine  Profan'd by them the muse's laurels fade  Her voice neglected and her flame decay'd  And the son's son must feel the father's crime  A curse entail'd on all the race that rhyme  New cares appear new terrors swell the train  And must we paint 'em ere we close the scene  Say must the muse th' unwilling task pursue  And to compleat her dangers mention you  Yes you my friend and those whose kind regard  With partial fondness views this humble bard  Ev'n you he dreadsAh kindly cease to raise  Unwilling censure by exacting

Behold th' ATHENIAN sage whose piercing mind  Had trac'd the wily lab'rinths of mankind  When now condemn'd he leaves his infant care  To all those evils man is born to bear  Not to his friends alone

Or bloom'd our BRITAIN with ATHENIAN worth  Wou'd the brave foe th' imperfect work engage  With honest freedom not with partial rage  What just productions might the world surprize  What other POPES

the PHILOSOPHER A FABLE  By the Same  AGrecian Youth of talents rare  Whom Plato's philosophick care  Had form'd for virtue's nobler view  By precept and example too  Wou'd often boast his matchless skill  To curb the steed and guide the wheel  And as he pass'd the gazing throng  With graceful ease and smack'd the thong  The ideot wonder they express'd  Was praise and transport to his breast  At length quite vain he needs wou'd shew  His master what his art cou'd do  And bade his slaves the chariot lead  To Academus' sacred shade  The trembling grove confess'd its fright  The woodnymphs startled at the sight  The Muses drop the learned lyre  And to their inmost shades retire  Howe'er the youth with forward air  Bows to the sage and mounts the car  The lash resounds the coursers

th' indented plain  The selfsame track he marks again  Pursues with care the nice design  Nor ever deviates from the line  Amazement seiz'd the circling croud  The youths with emulation glow'd  Ev'n bearded sages hail'd the boy  And all but Plato gaz'd with joy  For he deepjudging sage beheld  With pain the triumphs of the field  And when the charioteer drew nigh  And flush'd with hope had caught his eye  Alas unhappy youth he cry'd  Expect no praise from me and sigh'd  With indignation I survey  Such skill and judgment thrown away  The time profusely squander'd there  On vulgar arts beneath

Tent in his GARDEN  By the Same  AH friend forbear nor fright the fields  With hostile scenes of imag'd war  Content still roves the blooming wilds  And sheds her mildest influence there  Ah drive not

Slip'd down to earth exceeding sly  And bade his coachman drive to White's  In form a beau so light he trips  You'd swear his wings were at his heels  From glass to glass alert he skips  And bows and prattles while he deals  In short so well his part he play'd  The waiters took him for a peer  And ev'n some great ones whisp'ring said  He was no vulgar foreigner  Whate'er he was he swept the board  Won every bett and every game  Strip'd even the Rooks who stampt and roar'd  And wonder'd how the devil it came  He wonder'd too and thought it hard  But found at last this great command  Was owing to one fav'rite card  That still brought luck into his hand  The four of spades whene'er he saw  Its sable spots he smoak'd the gulls  Took odds beyond the gaming law  And laugh'd at Hoyle's as vulgar rules  But now for now 'twas time to go  What gratitude shall he express  And what peculiar boon bestow  Upon the cause of his success  Suppose for something must be done  On Juno's self he cou'd prevail  To pick the pips out one by one  And stick them in her peacock's tail  Should Pallas have it was a doubt  To twist her silk or range her pins  Or should the muses cut it out  For bridges to their violins  To Venus shou'd the prize be given  Superior beauty's just reward  And 'gainst the next great rout in heaven  Be sent her for a messagecard  Or holdby Jove a lucky hit  Your goddesses

air for sure in that  There's nothing more than common  And all her sense is only chat  Like any other woman  IV  Her voice her touch might give th' alarm  'Twas both perhaps or neither  In short 'twas that provoking charm  Of CAELIA altogether  An ODE On a distant Prospect of  ETON  COLLEGE  By Mr  YE distant spires ye antique towers  That crown the wat'ry glade  Where grateful science still adores  Her HENRY's holy shade  And ye that from the stately brow  Of WINDSOR's heights th' expanse below  Of grove of lawn of mead survey  Whose turf whose shade whose flowers among  Wanders the hoary Thames along  His silverwinding way  Ah happy hills ah pleasing shade  Ah fields belov'd in vain  Where once my careless childhood stray'd  A stranger yet to pain  I feel the gales that from ye blow  A momentary bliss bestow  As waving fresh their gladsome wing  My weary soul they seem to sooth  And redolent of joy and youth  To breathe a second spring  Say father THAMES for thou hast seen  Fully many a sprightly race  Disporting on thy margent green  The paths of pleasure trace  Who foremost now delight to cleave  With pliant arm thy glassy w  ve  The captive linnet which enthral  What idle progeny succeed  To chase the rolling circle's speed  Or urge the flying ball  While some on earnest business bent  Their murm'ring labours ply  'Gainst graver hours that bring constraint  To sweeten liberty  Some bold adventurers disdain  The limits of their little reign  And unknown regions dare descry  Still as they run they look behind  They hear a voice in every wind  And snatch a

And lively chear of vigour born  The thoughtless day the easy night  The spirits pure the slumbers light  That fly th' approach of morn  Alas regardless of their doom  The little victims play  No sense have they of ills to come  No care beyond today  Yet see how all around 'em wait  The ministers of human fate  And black misfortune's baleful train  Ah shew them where in ambush stand  To seize their prey the murth'rous band  Ah tell them they are men  These shall the fury passions tear  The vultures of the mind  Disdainful anger pallid fear  And shame that sculks behind  Or pineing love shall waste their youth  Or jealousy with rankling tooth  That inly gnaws the secret heart  And envy wan and faded care  Grimvisag'd comfortless despair  And sorrow's piercing dart  Ambition this shall tempt to rise  Then whirl the wretch from high  To bitter scorn a sacrifice  And grinning infamy  The stings of falshood those shall try  And hard unkindness' alter'd eye  That mocks the tear it forc'd to flow  And keen remorse with blood defil'd  And moody madness laughing wild  Amidst severest woe  Lo in the vale of years beneath  A griesly troop are seen  The painful family of death  More hideous than their queen  This racks the joints this fires the veins  That every labouring sinew strains  Those in the deeper vitals rage  Lo poverty to fill the band  That numbs the soul with icy hand  And slowconsuming age  To each his suff'rings all are men  Condemn'd alike to groan  The tender for another's pain  Th' unfeeling for his own  Yet ah why should they know their fate  Since

stream  Their scaly armour's Tyrian hue  Thro' richest purple to the view  Betray'd a golden gleam  IV  The hapless nymph with wonder saw  A whisker first and then a claw  With many an ardent wish  She stretch'd in vain to reach the prize  What female heart can gold despise  What cat's a foe to fish  V  Presumptuous maid with looks intent  Again she stretch'd again she bent  Nor knew the gulf

 No Dolphin came no Nereid stir'd  Nor cruel Tom nor Harry heard  What fav'rite has a friend  VII  From hence ye beauties undeceiv'd  Know one false step is ne'er retriev'd  And be with caution bold  Not all that tempts your wand'ring eyes  And heedless hearts is lawful prize  Nor all that glisters gold  A MONODY On the DEATH of Queen CAROLINE  By RICHARD WEST  Esq  Son to the Chancellor of Ireland and Grandson to Bishop BURNET  I  SING we no more of HYMENEAL lays  Nor strew the land with myrtles and with bays  The voice of joy is fled the BRITISH shore  For CAROLINE's no more  And now our sorrows ask a sadder string  Come plaintive goddess of the Cyrrhan spring  Pour thy deep note and shed thy tuneful tear  And while we lose the memory of pain  In thy oblivious strain  Ah drop thy cypress on yon mournful bier  Begin nor more delay  The sacred meed of gratitude to pay  Begin whate'er immortal song can do  To the dear name of CAROLINE is due  Who loves the muse deserves the muse's love  Then raise thy numbers high  Sound out her glory to the throne of Jove  Spread the glad voice thro' all the ambient sky  From the dull marble vindicate her praise  And waft it down to lighten future days  II  Ye bards to come the song of truth attend  This this is she the muse's judge and friend  The royal female whose benignant hand  Throughout fair ALBION's land  Dealt every useful every decent part  Each MEMPHIAN science and each ATTICK art  Within the muse's bower  She oft was wont to lose the vacant hour  Or underneath the sapient grot reclin'd  Her soul to contemplation she resign'd  And for a while laid down  The painful envied burthen of a crown  Mean time thy rural ditty was not mute  Sweet bard of MERLIN's cave  Tho' rude thy ditty was of her who gave  Thy voice to sing and tun'd thy oatenflute  In strains unwonted to the ear of swain  As when the lark ambitious of the skies  Quits the low harvest of the golden plain  Taught by the sun's inspiring warmth to rise  Sublime in air he spreads his dappled wings  Mounts the blue aether and in mounting sings  III  But whither wanders the licentious song  Such joyous notes to happier days belong  Ah me our happier days are now no more  Return sad muse see pale BRITANNIA weep  See all the sisters of the subject deep  Their sovereign's loss deplore  See fond IERNE gives her sorrows vent  And as she tunes her brazen lyre to woe  Indulge her grief to flow  See even the northern ORCADES lament  Nor ends the wailing here  Wheree'er beneath our flag wild Ocean roars  From farthest ORIENT to HESPERIA's shores  From torrid AFFRICK to the world's cold end  The BRITISH woes extend  And every colony has dropt a tear  IV  O honour'd flood with reeds Pierian crown'd  ISIS whose argent waters glide along  Fair BELLOSITE's Lycaean shades renown'd  Now aid my feeble song  And call thy chosen sons and bid them bring  Their lays of DORICK air  With lenient sounds to steal a while from care  Th' inconsolable King  O sooth his anguish and compose his pains  With artful unimaginable strains  According sweetly to the golden lyre  Such as might halfinspire  The iron breast of HADES to resign  Our lost lov'd CAROLINE  V  These are thy glorious deeds almighty death  These are thy triumphs o'er the sons of men  That now receive the miserable breath  Which the next moment they resign again  Ah me what boots us all our boasted power  Our golden treasure and our purple state  They cannot ward th' inevitable hour  Nor stay the fearful violence of fate  Virtue herself shall fail  Else now if virtue ever could prevail  Death had not dar'd to violate the throne  Nor had BRITANNIA heard her sovereign groan  Ye nymphs recall the song  For heavenborn virtue does to heaven belong  And scorns the meanest of her sons should die  But opens him a passage to the sky  Her rod aypointing to th' ethereal goal  From the brute earth she frees the ardent soul  Swift from the vulgar herd aloft she springs  Spurns the moist clay and soars on azure wings  VI  Then hence with sorrows vain  Ye Theban muses elevate the strain  Search o'er the records of immortal fame  And highrefulgent on the female line  Imblaze in starry characters the name  Of BRITISH CAROLINE  While sacred story rings with SHEBA's praise  While BERENICE's virtues still inspire  The CYRENEAN lyre  And GLORIANA blooms in SPENSER's lays  Thy name great Queen shall glow in every page  Shall dwell in every clime and live in every age  When GEORGE shall go where WILLIAM went before  And all the present world shall be no more  When the fond factions of unjust mankind  The mean the mad the envious and the blind  Shall turn to worms and dust  Then time impartial judge that states the price  Of each man's virtue and of each man's vice  From thy bright fame shall clear the cank'ring rust  And O the muses ever shall be just  VII  But lo what sudden radiance gilds the skies  'Tis gratitude descending from above  Known by the sweetness of her dovelike eyes  Daughter of truth and universal love  To HENRY's sacred dome she wafts along  And on thy tomb she pours  Celestial sweets and amaranthine flowers  The old the young the rich the wretched croud  Numerous around her and with accents loud  Raise the mix'd voice and pour the grateful song  "Hail Queen adorn'd by nature and by art  "Thine was each virtue of the head and heart  "Thy people blest thee and thy children lov'd  "And thy King honour'd and thy God approv'd"  VIII  But here my labours cease  'Tis time the foaming courser to release  And thou O royal shade  Forgive the muse that these vain honours paid  A muse as yet unheeded and unknown  That dares to sacrifice to truth alone  Not prone to blame not hasty to commend  No foe unjust no mercenary

tyrant man  Selfprais'd and grasping at despotick pow'r  He looks on slav'ry as the female dow'r  To Nature's boon ascribes what force has giv'n  And usurpation deems the gift of heav'n  See the firstpeopled East where ASIA sheds  Her balmy spices o'er her fertile meads  There while th' ASSYRIAN stretch'd his wide domain  From distant Ind  to the Cyprian main  All nature's laws by impious force were broke  The female sex to slav'ry's galling yoke  Bow'd their fair necks from social life confin'd  And all th' exertions of th' enlight'ned mind  Clos'd in a proud Seraglio's wanton bow'rs  The dalliance of a tyrant's looser hours  By kings examples subjects form their lives  Dependent satraps had their train of wives  Proportion'd pow'r each petty tyrant craves  And each poor female was the slave of slaves  When PERSIA next o'erturn'd th' Assyrian throne  Destroy'd her tyranny and fix'd its own  The fair distress'd no milder treatment saw  This was indeed  th' unalterable law  In future times whatever masters came  Tyrants were chang'd but tyranny the same  At length t' accumulate the female woes  The grand impostor MAHOMET arose  Swoln with prophetick lyes he lay'd his plan  On the firm basis of the pride of man  "Women the toys of men and slaves of lust  "Are but mere moulds to form man's outward crust  "The heavenly spark that animates the clay  "Of the prime essence that effulgent ray  "Th' immortal soul is all to man confin'd  "Not meanly squander'd on weak womankind"  Accursed wretch by hell's black council driv'n  Thus to debase the fairest work of heav'n  And could Religion rear her sacred head  Fraught with such doctrines could such errors spread  From western TANGIER and the sunburnt Moor  To the cold TARTAR's everfrozen shore  Ev'n GREECE too not exempt GREECE once the seat  Where Sense and Freedom held the reins of state  Where Force was Reason's handmaid where the bands  Of Love and Friendship join'd the wedded hands  Where flourish'd once and flourish still in fame  Th'ATHENIAN matron and the SPARTAN dame  In ROME too Liberty once reign'd in ROME  The female virtues were allow'd too bloom  And bloom they did when CANNAE's fatal plain  Was heap'd with mountains of the Roman slain  Was there a matron wept her children  dead  Was there a matron wept not those that  fled  Then when each rumour seem'd the voice of fate  And spoke the victor thund'ring at their gate  Was there one mention'd peace did they not pour  Their wealth their jewels to the publick store  In emulous haste all pressing to be poor  Alas how chang'd how are the mighty sunk  From the firm Patriot to the whining Monk  Where Industry secur'd the publick good  Where censors consuls and dictators plough'd  Now lazy zealots batten on the spoil  And consecrated Sloth devours the farmer's toil  But oh still worse where Love and friendship shone  Domestick Tyranny has fix'd his throne  With all his train of monsters at his side  Swoln with selfflatteries sits stiffneck'd Pride  Two twinborn fiends his other ear engage  Heartcanker'd Jealousy and fireey'd Rage  In front his empire's sole support and source  Rattling chains bars and locks stalks brutal Force  Whilst pale and shrivel'd crouch'd beneath the chair  Lies sneaking conscious Worthlessness and near  Squintey'd Suspicion lurks with selfdistracting Fear  Hail happy BRITAIN dear parental land  Where Liberty maintains her latest stand  Oh while amidst tyrannick realms I rove  Enamour'd let me pour my filial love  Into thy bosom When the raven wings  Of darkness hover o'er me when the springs  Of ev'ry outward sense are shut my soul  Thee oft revisits oft without controul  Ranges thy fields delighted and inhales  Friendship's pure joys and Freedom's healthful gales  But say BRITANNIA do thy sons who claim  A birthright liberty dispense the same  In equal scales Why then does Custom bind  In chains of ignorance the female mind  Why is to them the bright ethereal ray  Of science veil'd Why does each pedant say  "Shield me propitious powers nor clog my life  "With that supreme of plagues  a learned wife  "'Tis man's with science to expand the soul  "And wing his eagleflight from pole to pole  "'Tis his to pierce antiquity's dark gloom  "And the still thicker shades of times to come  "'Tis his to guide the pond'rous helm of state  "And bear alone all wisdom's solid weight  "Let woman with alluring graces move  "The fondling passions and the baby love  "Be this her only science be her doom  "Fix'd to the toilette the spinnet and loom"  Tonguedoughty pedant was ATHENIA's soul  Form'd for these only Bring th' exactest rule  Of judgment to the tryal prove that e'er  Thy schoolproud tribe engross'd a greater share  Of mental excellence tho' vernal youth  Justs swells her lovely bosom yet blest truth  Offspring of sense and industry has there  Long fix'd her residence and taught the fair  Or wisdom's deep recesses to explore  Or on invention's rapid wings to soar  Above th' Aonian mount and can'st thou think  That virtues which exalt the soul can sink  The outward charms must knowledge give offence  And are the graces all at war with sense  Say who of all the fair is form'd to move  The fondest passions most ecstatick love  More than ATHENIA in her gentle eye  Soft innocence and virgin modesty  Incessant shine while still a newborn grace  Springs in each speaking feature of her face  Her sprightly wit no forward pertness spoils  No selfassuming air her judgment soils  Still prone to learn tho' capable to teach  And lofty all her thoughts but humble all her speech  Proceed ATHENIA let thy growing mind  Take ev'ry knowledge in of ev'ry kind  Still on perfection fix thy steady eye  Be ever rising rise thou ne'er so high  But oh reflect that in th' advent'rous flight  Thou mount'st a glorious but a dangerous height  When ev'ry science ev'ry grace shall join  When most thy wit when most thy beauties shine  When thickest crouds enamour'd press around  When loudest ev'ry tongue thy praise shall found  When verse too offers incense at thy shrine  And adoration breathes in ev'ry line  Then let my friendly Muse express her care  Then most will danger spread her viewless snare  Then let this truth possess thy inmost soul  "One drop of Vanity may spoil the whole"  Not selfsecure on earth can knowledge dwell  Knowledge the bliss of heav'n and pang of hell  Alike the instrument of good and evil  The attribute of God and of the Devil  Without her Virtue is a powerless Will  She without Virtue is a powerful Ill  Does she then join with Virtue or oppose  She proves the best of Friends or worst of Foes  Oh be they once in happiest union join'd  And be that union in ATHENIA's mind  On SHAKESPEAR's Monument at  Stratford  upon  Avon  By the Same  GReat HOMER's birth sev'n rival cities claim  Too mighty such monopoly of Fame  Yet not to birth alone did HOMER owe  His wond'rous worth what EGYPT could bestow  With all the schools of GREECE and ASIA join'd  Enlarg'd th' immense expansion of his mind  Nor yet unrival'd the MAEONIAN strain  The  Milton  British Eagle and the Mantuan Swan  Tow'r equal heights But happier STRATFORD thou  With incontested laurels deck thy brow  Thy Bard was thine  unschool'd  and from thee brought  More than all EGYPT GREECE or ASIA taught  Not HOMER's self such matchless honours won  The Greek has Rivals but thy SHAKESPEAR none  A SONG  By the Same  I  WHEN fair SERENA first I knew  By friendship's happy union charm'd  Incessant joys around her flew  And gentle smiles my bosom warm'd  II  But when with fond officious care  I press'd to breathe my amorous pain  Her lips spoke nought but cold despair  Her eyes shot ice thro' ev'ry vein  III  Thus in ITALIA's lovely vales  The sun his genial vigour yields  Reviving heat each sense regales  And plenty crowns the smiling fields  IV  When nearer we approach his ray  High on the Alps' stupendous brow  Surpriz'd we see pale sunbeams play  On everlasting hills of snow  CHISWICK  By the Same  THE potent Lord that this bright villa plann'd  Exhibits here a  Paradise regain'd  Whate'er of Verdure have Hills Lawns or Woods  Whate'er of

Knowledge  grows  The INDIFFERENT From the  Italian  of  Metastasio  By the Same  THANKS CLOE thy coquetting art  At length hath heal'd my lovesick heart  At length thy slave is free  I feel no tyrant's proud controul  I feel no inmate in my soul  But peace and liberty  No longer now a fierce desire  In anger masks its amorous fire  And fiercer burns suppress'd  I blush not when thy name I hear  I meet thee suddenly and fear  No fluttering in my breast  In dreams I ev'ry trifle see  Yet very rarely dream of thee  I wake nor think about thee  When absent I ne'er wish thee near  And when thou'rt present I nor fear  Nor pray to be without thee  I think hear talk about thy charms  Nor stoop the head nor fold the arms  Nay ev'n my wrongs fit easy  And when my favour'd rival's near  And eyes me with insulting leer  His triumphs never teaze me  Put on thy looks of cold disdain  Or speak respectful 'tis in vain  Nor frowns nor smiles can move  Those lips no more have words that bind  Those eyes no more have light to find  The path that leads to love  Seasons which wont to take their dye  Of foul or fair from CLOE's eye  Now their own livery wear  This place I hate and that I love  The fen's a fen the grove's a grove  If absent thou or there  Judge if I speak like one sincere  Still I confess your face is fair  But so are twenty faces  And if plain truth will not offend  You've now some features I could mend  Which once appear'd all graces  Nay more I own when from my heart  I strove to tug the fatal dart  It cut my heart in sunder  But to relieve a constant pain  And to retrieve one's self again  What would one not gounder  The fluttering bird in viscous snare  Entangled willingly will spare  For liberty a feather  In time again the feather grows  And wise by danger made he knows  To shun the snare for ever  But still I hear you smiling say  'Tis sign you've flung your chains away  You take such pains to shew 'em  Why CLOE there's a fond delight  Our former dangers to recite  And let our neighbours know 'em  After the thunder of the wars  The veteran thus displays his scars  And tells you of his pains  The gallyslave enslav'd no more  Shews you the shackles which he wore  And where their mark remains  I talk 'cause talking gives delight  I please myself not CLOE by't  Nor care if she believe  And when myself she deigns to name  Whether she praise my song or blame  I neither joy nor grieve  For me I quit a fickle fair  CLOE has lost a heart sincere  Who first should sing  Te Deum  You'll never find so true a swain  But women full as false and vain  By dozens one may see 'em  The TRIUMPH of INDIFFERENCE  Being the same ODE imitated by an unknown Hand  I  THANKS dear coquet indulgent cheat  Kind heaven and your more kind deceit  At length have set me free  No more I sigh and doat and pine  All ease without and calm within  In peace and liberty  II  Cupid no more has power to scorch  Time sure has robb'd him of his torch  Ne'er was a cooler creature  That name no more has such eclat  No more my heart goes pitapat  At sight of each dear feature  III  I sleep at night and sometimes dream  Nor you the fond vexatious theme  I wake nor think about you  I meet I leave you meet again  But feel no mighty joy or pain  Or with you or without you  IV  Now with indifference I chat  Of eyes lips bubbies and all that  And laugh at former follies  Joke with my rival when we meet  What eye so keen what lips so sweet  What skin so soft as Molly's  V  Leave then those little torturing arts  You practise on complying hearts  They're all in vain believe me  Whether those eyes look kind or weep  The pouting or the smiling lip  Will neither please nor grieve me  VI  From those despotick looks no more  Once tyrants of each fickle hour  I date my grief and joy  May tho' you frown looks sweetly clad  And dull December's mighty sad  Tho' you stand smiling by  VII  Yet still for I am quite sincere  You're mighty prettytrue my dear  But like your pretty sex  You've here and there and now and then  A failing for like other men  I now can spy defects  VIII  Yet once with coward fondness curs'd  My poor weak heart I fear'd would burst  At thought of separation  But now despise my feeble chain  And bless the salutary pain  That cur'd me of my passion  IX  Impatient of his iron cage  The bird thus spends his little rage  And 'scapes with shatter'd wings  But soon with newfledg'd pinions soars  And hast'ning to his native bow'rs  A joyful welcome sings  X  Fond female vanity will say  These long harangues they sure betray  A heart that's hankering still  This passion so proclaim'd in song  This tale so pleasing to the tongue  Does it not touch the will  XI  Lovers like soldiers Molly dwell  With pleasure on the horrid tale  When all the danger's o'er  Like other slaves from fetters free  We smile with anxious joy to see  The chains which once we wore  XII  In kind indulgence to a heart  Engag'd in so severe a part  This sweet revenge I write  Rail weep be woman all for I  Lull'd in indifference defy  Your fondness or your spite  XIII  A frail false maid I lost but you  A man fond generous and true  Which fortune is the worst  Try all love's mighty empire round  A faithful lover's seldom found  A jilt's a common curse  The SHEPHERD's FAREWELL to his LOVE  Being the same ODE  Translated by Mr  PHoebe thank thy false heart it has fix'd my repose  The gods have had pity at length on my woes  I feel it I feel my soul loose from its chain  And at last freedom comes often dream'd of in vain  The flame is burn'd out and each passion at rest  Under which love disguis'd still might lurk in my breast  No more when thou'rt nam'd the warm blushes arise  No more flutters my heart when I meet with your eyes  In my sleep now no longer thy image I see  Nor the first of my thoughts when I wake is of thee  When from thee no more of thy absence I plain  When with thee I feel neither pleasure nor pain  My heart without fondness can muse on thy charms  My past pains I recount yet no passion alarms  Discompos'd I'm no longer when tow'rd me you move  And at ease with my rival I talk of my love  Whether haughty thy frown whether gentle thy strain  In vain thy proud looks thy fond speeches in vain  Thy false tongue to beguile me no more has the art  No more thy keen eye knows the way to my heart  Whether pensive or cheerful no longer to you  For this are my thanks or for that my blame due  The gay prospect now pleases though you are away  And your presence no more can make dreariness gay  Believe me I still can allow that thou'rt fair  But not that no fairone can with thee compare  And though beauteous I own thee yet still in thy face  I can now spy a fault which I once thought a grace  When first the fix'd arrow I pluck'd from my heart  Oh methought I shou'd die so severe was the smart  But from pow'r so oppressive to set myself clear  Torments greater than dying with patience I'd bear  When lim'd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains  Nor regrets the lost plume so his freedom he gains  The loss of his plumage small time will restore  And once try'd the false twig it can cheat him no more  The old flame never flatter yourself to believe  While it dwells on my tongue in my heart still must live  Our dangers when past with delight we repeat  What in suffering was pain to remembrance is sweet  'Tis thus when the soldier returns from the wars  He fights o'er his old battles and vaunts of his scars  With pleasure the captive his liberty gain'd  The fetters thus shows which once held him enchain'd  Thus I talk and I still will talk on while I may  Nor heed I though you disbelieve what I say  I ask not that Phoebe my talk should approve  Let her too if she can talk at ease of my love  An inconstant I leave a true lover you lose  Which first of us two will have comfort who knows  This I knowPhoebe ne'er such a truelove will find  I can easily meet with a fair as unkind  RIDDLE  By the Same  THrough the close covert of the shady grove  One summer's day it was my chance to rove  Where shrouded from the sun's too scorching ray  Stretch'd at her ease halfslumbering Cloe lay  Occasion so inviting who could miss  Softly I stole and snatch'd a sudden kiss  Startled at first the rising blush display'd  The quick resentment of the ruffled maid  Lively display'dfor soon it over past  Such blushing anger never long did last  Quick reconcilement must to rage succeed  Where wrongs ideal solid pleasures breed  Submissive looks my pardon soon obtain'd  And pardon'd love as soon new boldness gain'd  Offending thus forgiving thus we lay  Long time entranc'd with the alternate play  'Till warn'd too soon by envious night we part  The thrilling joy still flutters round my heart  Thought still tho' fainter paints the glowing bliss  On fancy's lip still cleaves the rapt'rous kiss  But mark the sad effects of casual love  And tread with caution in the shady grove  In due time Cloe at my doors appears  A fix'd composure on her brow she wears  And guess the cause close in her lap conceal'd  A lovely twin in either hand she held  And take she cry'd these pledges of our love  These fruits you planted in the shady grove  Soft as the downy bloom on Cloe's cheek  Smooth as the polish'd ivory of her neck  Warm as her bosom white as was her arm  So smooth were they and white so soft and warm  Pleas'd I receiv'd them for the giver's sake  Heedless what censures straitlac'd prudes might make  Compliant to my forming hand they grew  And with their size encreas'd obedience due  As I direct they take th' appointed bent  With ev'ry motion ev'ry beck consent  Whate'er I want they reach with ready hand  Wheree'er I go they wait at my command  Now at his ease one in my bosom lays  While by my side the other wanton plays  Now this my hand embraces t'other free  Takes his full swing and plays at liberty  Before me hand in hand sometimes they move  Emblems of friendship and united love  Sometimes behind my leading steps they trace  Still closely knit in brotherly embrace  Anon on either side as guards attend  At once adorn me and at once defend  Still more and more my love they thus engage  Thus still shall cherish my declining age  And when th' appointed hour of fate shall come  They'll follow still attendant on my tomb  More lasting far than man's soonfading breath  Their love extends beyond the vale of death  They'll hang for ever o'er my muchloved bust  Till they themselves like me are turn'd to dust  RIDDLE  Mortalis in unum  Quodque caput vultu mutabilis albus an ater  By the Same  TORN from the fruitful spot on which I grew  Me innocent unnumber'd pains pursue  Pains more afflicting as from man they flow  From parent man for birth to man I owe  Sometimes on spikes of steel my nerves they rend  Sometimes asunder split from end to end  In boiling cauldrons now immers'd I lie  Now doom'd the rage of drying fires to try  There while in double torment scorch'd and drown'd  Fast tied I writhe the rigid stake around  Last their fierce hate its utmost effort tries  With all Barbarian pomp of sacrifice  The purple fillet round my temples wreathes  From every part the scented unguent breathes  O'er my white locks the sacred flower is spread  Whilst on the fatal block is plac'd my head  Yet with fix'd constancy I bear my doom  And constancy at last will overcome  From all my tryals I return at length  My worth encreas'd my beauty and my strength  The suffering martyr thus in torment dies  In sainted state more glorious to arise  And now I reassume my native state  My torturers now beneath their burden sweat  Slaves in their turn to me and think it pride  If on their subject necks I deign to ride  Yet still my filial duty I retain  Unchang'd by honours as unmov'd by pain  Still to mankind a friend I daily shed  My warmest blessings on his parent head  Around him still with fond embraces twine  As round the elm her tendrils curls the vine  Nor quit him e'er till he to rest repairs  And every morn renew my constant cares  Ready alike on rich and poor to wait  I suit myself to every different state  With priest in whitish dress array'd I shine  Emblem of purity and truth divine  His solemn face the doctor owes to me  His solemn face to which he owes his fee  At bench or bar I add a dignity  To th' upright sentence or rhetorick plea  Hence without me no judge explains the laws  Nor coifed council pleads the puzling cause  In fullest floods my bounty showers on them  Profuse descending to the garment's hem  Gorgeous in silken garb I grace the beau  And all around ambrosial fragrance throw  Nor less decorous tho' with dust o'erspread  When to the camp the valiant warriors lead  Gorgonian terrors to each mien I add  And still their weakest part with care I shade  RIDDLE  By the Same  MY size is large my shape's uncouth  I've neither limb nor feature  Men's hands have form'd my skin so smooth  My guts were made by nature  Nor male nor female is my sex  You'll scarce believe my troth  For when I've told you all my tricks  You'll swear 'tmust needs be both  For oft my master lies with me  His wife I oft enjoy  Yet she's no whore no cuckold he  And true to both am I  My cloaths nor women fit nor men  They're neither coat nor gown  Yet oft both men and maidens when  They're naked have them on  When I'm upon my legs I lie  Yet legs in truth I've none  And never am I seen so high  To rise as when I'm down  What's oft my belly is oft my back  And what my feet my head  And though I'm up I

Illustrious names in great Elisa's days  Nor doubt his promise firm that such who own  In evil times undaunted though alone  His glorious truth such he will crown with praise  And glad agnize before his Father's throne  SONNET XI  YOung fair and good ah why should young and fair  And good be huddled in untimely grave  Must so sweet flow'r so brief a period have  Just bloom and charm then fade and disappear  Yet our's the loss who ill alas can spare  The bright example which thy virtues gave  The guerdon thine whom gracious heav'n did save  From longer trial in this vale of care  Rest then sweet saint in peace and honor rest  While our true tears bedew thy maiden hearse  Light lie the earth upon thy lovely breast  And let a grateful heart with grief oppress'd  To thy dear mem'ry consecrate this verse  Though all too mean for who deserves the best  SONNET XII  W * whose dear friendship in the dawning years  Of undesigning Childhood first began  Through Youth's gay morn with even tenor ran  My noon conducted and my evening chears  Rightly dost thou in whom combin'd appears  Whate'er for Public Life completes the Man  With active Zeal strike out a larger plan  No useless friend to Senators and Peers  Me moderate talents and a small estate  Fit for Retirement's unambitious shade  Nor envy I who near approach the throne  But joyful see thee mingle with the Great  See thy deserts with due distinction paid  And praise thy lot contented with my own  SONNET XIII  To the Right Hon Mr with the foregoing SONNETS  THOU who successive in that honor'd seat  Presid'st the feuds of jarring Chiefs to 'swage  To check the boisterons force of Party rage  Raise modest worth and guide the high debate  Sometimes retiring from the toils of State  Thou turn'st th' instructive Greek or Roman page  Or what our British Bards of later age  In scarce inferior numbers can relate  Amid this feast of Mind when Fancy's Child  Sweet SHAKESPEAR wraps the soul to virtuous deed  When SPENSER warbling tunes his Doric lays  Or the first Man from Paradise exil'd  Great MILTON sings can ought my rustic reed  Presume to sound that may deserve thy praise  INDEX to the Second Volume  THE
