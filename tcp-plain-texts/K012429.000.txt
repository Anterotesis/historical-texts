 THE SEASONS IN IMITATION OF  SPENSER  Annuus agricolis ordo breviorque laborum  Summa mihi tradenda  Praedium Rusticum  LONDON  Printed for S BAKER at  Chaucer  's  Head  in  RusselStreet CoventGarden  Price One Shilling  AN IMITATION OF  SPENSER  I  YE baleful Follow'rs of the  Blatant Beast  Who censure Matters far beyond your Ken  Behold I now present you with a Feast  Rush forth like Wolves from your sequester'd Den  And mangle all the Labours of my Pen  Show ye rude Louts your lewd unhallow'd Rage  In this I share the Fate of greater Men  Pale Envy ever knaws the laurel'd Page  And 'gainst all worthy Wight doth War perpetual wage  II  If thee sweet Nymph these simple Lines  Please  aggrate  If I may hope to merit thine Esteem  Not with the proudest would I change my State  Of those who deeply drink  Castalia  's Stream  And on  Parnassus  catch th' inspiring Dream  Say thou dear Noursling of the  Paphian  Queen  Wilt thou ah wilt thou patronize my Theme  So shall this Measure blunt the tooth of Spleen  Nor Critic's Tongue shall blast such favour'd Lines I ween  III  See how the Tribe of Witlings shun the Place  And deep in Shades conceal their Fronts of Brass  The Coxcomb talks of Feathers Cloaths and Lace  Nay  Codrus  unimpeach'd doth let me pass  Codrus  of Pride and Spite a mighty Mass  Thus when a Set of Imps at Midnight play  And tear the Coarses from the hallow'd Grass  Soon as the Sun unbars the Gates of Day  They fear his heav'nly Light and melt in Air away  SPRING  An IMITATION of  SPENSER  I  ERE yet I sing the roundrevolving Year  And show the Toils and Pastime of the Swain  At  The late Mr  Thomson  Alcon  's Grave I drop a pious Tear  Right well he knew to raise his learned Strain  And like his  Milton  scorn'd the rhyming Chain  Ah cruel Fate to tear him from our Eyes  Receive this Wreath albe the Tribute's vain  From the green Sod may Flow'rs immortal rise  To mark the sacred Spot where the sweet Poet lies  II  It is the Cuckoo that announceth SPRING  And with his  Revengeful  wreakful Tale the Spouse doth fray  Mean while the Finches harmless Ditties sing  And hop in buxom Youth from Spray to Spray  Proud as Sir  Paridel  of rich Array  The little Wantons that draw  Venus'  Team  Chirp am'rous thro' the Grove in beavies gay  And he who erst gain'd  Leda  's fond Esteem  Now sails on  Thamis  Tide the Glory of the Stream  III  Proud as the  Turkish  Soldan  Chaunticleer  Sees with Delight his num'rous Race around  He grants fresh Favours to each Female near  For Love as well as Chevisaunce renown'd  The waddling Dame that did the  Gauls  confound  Her tawny Sons doth lead to Rivers cold  While  Juno  's  Darling  Dearling with majestic Bound  To charm his  Lover  Leman doth his Train unfold  That glows with vivid Green that flames with burning Gold  IV  The balmy Cowslip gilds the smiling Plain  The virgin Snowdrop boasts her Silver Hue  An hundred Tints the gaudy Daisy stain  And the meek Violet in amis Blue  Creeps low to Earth and hides from public View  But the rank Nettle rears her Crest on high  So Ribaulds loose their Fronts unblushing shew  While modest Merit doth neglected lie  And pines in lonely Shade unseen of vulgar Eye  V  See all around the gallless  Doves  Culvers bill  Mean while the Nightingale's becalming Lays  Mix with the plaintive Music of the Rill  The which in various  Circles or Windings  Gyres the Meadow  Bathes  bays  Behold the Welkin bursts into a Blaze  Fast by the Car of Light the nimble Hours  In Songs of Triumph hail his genial Rays  And as they  go  wend to  Thetis  cooling Bow'rs  They bound along the Sky and strew the Heav'ns with Flow'rs  VI  And now the human Bosom melts to Love  The raptur'd Bard awakes his skilful Lyre  By running Streams or in the Laurel Grove  He tunes to am'rous Notes his sounding Wire  All all is Harmony and all Desire  The happy Numbers charm the blooming Maid  Her blushing Cheeks pronounce her Heart on Fire  She now consents then shuns th' embow'ring Shade  With faint Reluctance yields desirous yet afraid  VII  Now rustic Cuddy with untutor'd Throat  Tho' much admir'd I ween of Nymph and Swain  By various Songs would various Ends promote  Seeks he to prove that Woman's Vows are vain  He  Bateman  's Fortune tells a baleful Strain  And if to honour  Britain  he be led  He sings a 'Prentice bold in Londs profane  Who all unarm'd did strike two Lyons dead  Tore forth their savage Hearts and did a Princess wed  VIII  But hark the Bagpipe summons to the Green  The jocund Bagpipe that awaketh Sport  The blythesome Lasses as the Morning sheen  Around the flow'rcrown'd Maypole quick resort  The Gods of Pleasure here have fix'd their Court  Quick on the Wing the flying Moment seize  Nor build up ample Schemes for Life is short  Short as the Whisper of the passing Breeze  Yet ah in vain I preachmine Heart is ill at Ease  SUMMER  An IMITATION of  SPENSER  I  BEneath yon  Knotty  snubby Oak's extended Shade  Safe let me hide me from the Eye of Day  Nor shall the Dogstar this Retreat invade  As thro the Heav'ns he speeds his burning Way  The sultry Lyon rages for his Prey  Ah  Phoebus  quench thy wild destroying Fire  Each Flow'r each Shrub doth sink beneath thy Ray  Save the fresh Laurel that shall ne'er expire  The leaves that crown a Bard may brave celestial Ire  II  Or shall I hie to mine own Hermitage  Round which the wanton Vine her Arms doth wind  There may I lonely turn the sacred Page  Improve my Reason and amend my Mind  Here 'gainst Life's Ills a Remedy I find  An hundred Flow'rs emboss the verdant Ground  A little Brook doth my sweet Cottage bind  Its Waters yield a melancholy Sound  And sooth to Study deep or lull to Sleep profound  III  The playful Insect hopping in the Grass  Doth tire the Hearer with his Sonnet shrill  The poolsprung Gnat on sounding Wing doth pass  And on the  Starting flyingout  ramping Steed doth suck his Fill  Ah me can little Creatures work such Ill  The patient Cow doth to eschew the Heat  Her Body steep within the neighb'ring Rill  And while the Lambs in fainter Voices bleat  Their Mothers hang the Head in doleful Plight I weet  IV  Careless  Rechless of Seasons see the lusty Swains  Along the Meadow spread the tawny Hay  The Maidens too undaunted seek the Plains  Ne fear to show their Faces to the Ray  But all the honest Badge of Toil display  See how they mould the Haycock's rising Head  While wanton  Colin  full of am'rous Play  Down throweth  Susan  who doth shriek for Dread  Fear notThou canst be hurt upon so soft a Bed  V  At length the Sun doth hasten to repose  And all the Vault of Heav'n is streak'd with Light  In flamy Gold the ruddy Welkin glows  And for the Noonday Heat our Pains doth  Requite  quite  For all is calm serene and passing bright  Favonius  gentle skims along the Grove  And sheds sweet Odors from his Pennons light  The little Bat in giddy Orbs doth rove  And loud the Screechowl shrieks to rouse her blueey'd Love  VI  Menalcas  came to taste the Ev'ning Gale  His Cheeks impurpl'd with the Rose of Youth  He won each Damsel with his piteous Tale  They thought they listen'd to the Words of Truth  Yet their Belief did work them muchel  Sorrow  Ruth  His Oaths were light as Gossimer or Air  His Tongue was pois'nous as an Aspic's Tooth  Ah cease to promise Joy and give Despair  'Tis brave to smite the Foe 'tis base to wrong the Fair  VII  The gentle  Thyrsis  mild as op'ning Morn  Came to the Lawn and  Marian  there was found  Marian  whom many Huswife Arts adorn  Right well she knew the Apple to surround  With dulcet Crust and  Thomalin  renown'd  For  Hardy valiant  prow Atchievements in the Wrestlingring  He held at nought the Vantage of the Ground  But prone to Earth the hardiest Wight would fling  Such was  Alcides  erst if Poets  Truth  Sooth do sing  VIII  From treecrown'd Hill from flow'renamel'd Vale  The mild Inhabitants in Crowds appear  To tread a Measure while Night's Regent pale  Doth thro' the Sky her Silver Chariot steer  Whose lucid Wheels were deck'd with Dewdrops clear  The which like Pearls descended on the Plain  Now every Youth doth clasp his Mistress dear  And ev'ry Nymph rewards her constant Swain  Thrice happy he who loves and is belov'd again  AUTUMN  An IMITATION of  SPENSER  I  SEE jolly AUTUMN clad in Hunter's Green  In wholesome  Vigor  lustyhed doth mount the Sphere  A leafy Girlond binds her Temples sheen  Instudded richly with the spiky Ear  Her right Hand bears a vineincircl'd Spear  Such as the Crew did wield whom  Bacchus  lad  When to the  Ganges  he his Course did steer  And in her left a Buglehorn she had  On which she  often  eft did blow and made the Heart right glad  II  In slow Procession moves the tott'ring Wain  The sunburnt Hinds their finish'd Toil  follow  ensue  Now in the Barn they house the glit'ring Grain  And there the Cries of 'Harvest Home' renew  The honest Farmer doth his Friends  salute  salew  And them with Jugs of Ale his Wife doth treat  Which for that Purpose she at Home did brew  They laugh they sport and homely Jests repeat  Then smack their Lasses Lips their Lips as Honey sweet  III  On ev'ry Hill the purpleblushing Vine  Beneath her Leaves her racy Fruit doth hide  Altho  Albe she pour not Floods of foaming Wine  Yet are we not Potations bland deny'd  See where the Peartree doth in Earth abide  Bruise her rich Fruitage and the Grape disdain  The Apple too will grant a gen'rous Tyde  To sing whose Honours  Thenot  rais'd his Strain  Whose soulinchanting Lays still charm the list'ning Plain  IV  Thro' greyish Mists behold  Aurora  dawns  And to his Sport the wary Fowler hies  Crouching to Earth his guileful Pointer fawns  Now the thick Stubble now the Clover tries  To find where with his Race the Partridge lies  Ah luckless Sire ah luckless Race I ween  Whom Force compels or subtle Arts surprize  More  Daedalus  envying  Perdix  his Nephew's Skill in Mechanics threw him into the Sea He escaped Death by being changed into a Partridge  Uncles wait to cause thee dol'rous  Anguish Pain  Teen  Doom'd to escape the Deep and perish on the Green  V  The fullmouth'd Hounds pursue the tim'rous Hare  And the Hills eccho to the joyful Cry  Ah borrow the light Pennons of the Air  If you're  Reach'd overtaken  arraught you die poor Wretch you die  Nought will avail the pitypleading Eye  For our good 'Squire doth much against you rail  And saith you often magic Arts do try  At Times you wave  Grimalkin  's sooty Tail  Or on a Beesom vild you thro' the Welkin sail  VI  The Stag is rous'd he stems the threat'ning Flood  That shall ere long his matchless Swiftness quell  And to avoid the Tumult of the Wood  Amongst his wellknown  Companions  Pheers attempts to  Mix  mell  With Horn and Hoof his Purpose they repel  Thus should a Maid from Virtue's Lore ystray  Your Sex my  Daphne  show their Vengeance fell  Your cruel selves with Gall the Shaft  Bathe  embay  And lash from Pardon's Shrine the Penitent away  VII  Now Silence charms the Sages of the Gown  To purer Air doth speed each crafty Wight  The wellsqueez'd Client quits the dusty Town  Grown grey in the asserting of his Right  With Head yfraught with Law and Pockets light  Well pleas'd he wanders o'er the fallow Lea  And views each rural Object with Delight  Ne'er be my Lot the brawling Courts to see  Who trusts to Lawyer's Tongue doth much  Judges ill  misween perdy  VIII  Right bless'd the Man who free from bitter  Sorrow  Bale  Doth in the little peaceful Hamlet dwell  No loud Contention doth his Ears assail  Save when the Tempest whistles o'er his Cell  The Fruitful Down the flow'rdepainted Dell  To please his Eyne are variously array'd'  And when in Roundelay his Flame he'd tell  He gains a Smile from his beloved Maid  By such a gentle Smile an Age of Pain's repaid  WINTER  An IMITATION of  SPENSER  I  THE little Brook that erst my Cot did lave  And o'er its flinty Pavement sweetly sung  Doth now forget to roll her wanton Wave  For Winter Hoar her icy Chain has flung  And still'd the babbling Music of her Tongue  The lonely Woodcock seeks the splashy Glen  Each Mountain Head with fleecy Snow is hung  The Snipe and Duck enjoy the moorish Fen  Like  Hermits  Eremites they live and shun the Sight of Men  II  The  Stupiffed  wareless Sheep no longer bite the Mead  No more the Ploughboy turns the stubborn Ground  At the full Crib the horned Lab'rers feed  Their Nostrils cast black Clouds of Smoak around  A squalid Coat doth the lean Steed surround  The wily Fox doth prowl abroad for Prey  Rechless of Snares or of th' avenging Hound  And trusty  Liftghoot  now no longer gay  Line last but one for  Liftghoot  read  Lightfoot  Sleeps at the Kitchen Hearth his cheerless Hours away  III  Where erst the Boat and slowly moving Barge  Did with Delight cut thro' the dimpling Plain  Now wanton Boys and Men do roam at large  The RiverGods quit their usurp'd Domain  And of the Wrong at  Neptune  's Court complain  There mote you see mild  Avon  crown'd with Flow'rs  And milky  Wey  withouten Spot or Stain  There the fair Stream that washes  Hampton  's Bow'rs  And  Isis  who with Pride beholds her learned Tow'rs  IV  Intent on Sport the ever jocund Throng  Quit their warm Cots and for the Game prepare  Behold the restless Football whirls along  Now near the Earth now mounted high in Air  Thus often Men in Life's wild Lott'ry fare  Who quit true Bliss to grasp an empty Toy  Our honest Swains for Wealth nor Titles care  But lusty Health in Exercise employ  The distant Village hears the rude tumultuous Joy  V  The careful Hedger looks the Fields around  To see what Labour may his Skill demand  He mends the Fence repairs the sinking Mound  Or in long Drains he cuts the lower Land  That shall henceforth all sudden Floods withstand  Mean while at Home his Dame with Silver Hair  Doth sit incircl'd by a goodly Band  Of lovely Maids who various Works prepare  All chaste as  Jove  's wise Child as  Cupid  's Mother fair  VI  She them discourses not of Fashions nice  Nor of the trilling Notes which Eunuchs sing  Allurements vain that prompt the Soul to Vice  Ne tells she them of  Kesar  or of King  Too great the Subject for so mean a Ring  Her Lessons teach to swell the Capon's Size  To make the Hen a num'rous Offspring bring  Or how the wayward Mother to chastize  When from her vetchy Nest the weetless Vagrant hies  VII  When glist'ring Spangles deck the Robe of Night  And all their Kine in Pens avoid the Cold  The buxom Troops still eager of Delight  Round  Damon  's Eyne a  A Linen Cloth  Drapet white infold  He darkling gropes 'till he some one can hold  Next  Corin  hides his Head and must impart  What wanton fair One smote his Hand so bold  He  Delia  names nor did from Truth depart  For well he knew her Touch who long had fir'd his Heart  VIII  Stay I conjure you by your Hopes of Bliss  Trust not my  Daphne  the roughbiting Air  Let not rude Winds those Lips of Softness kiss  Will  Eurus  stern the Charms of Beauty spare  No he will hurt my rosyfeatur'd Fair  If aught so bright dares rugged  Carl  invade  Too tender thou such rough assaults to bear  The Mountain Ash may stand tho' strip'd of Shade  But at the slightest Wound the silken Flow'r will fade  FINIS
