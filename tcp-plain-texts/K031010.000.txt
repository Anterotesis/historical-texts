 SHepherds buxom blith and free  Now's the Time for Jollity  SYLVIA  AIR  Hither haste and bring along  Merry Tale and jocund Song  To the Pipe and Tabor beat  Frolick Measures with your Feet  Ev'ry Gift of Time employ  Make the most of proffer'd Joy  Pleasure hates the scanty Rules  Portion'd out by dreaming Fools  CHORUS  Shepherds buxom blith and free  Now's the Time for Jollity  A Dance of Shepherds  c  SYLVIA  RECITATIVE  Rejoice ye happy Swains rejoice  It is the Heart that prompts the Voice  Be sorrow banish'd far away  Thyrsis  shall make it Holyday  Who at his Name can Joy suppress  Arcadian  born to rule and bless  DAMON  And hark from Rock to Rock the Sound  Of winding Horn and deepmouth'd Hound  Breaking with Rapture on the Ear  Proclaims the blithsome  Phoebe  near  See where she hastes with eager Pace  To speak the Joys that paint her Face  SCENE II  Opens to a Prospect of Rocks  Huntsmen Huntresses  c  coming down from them  PHOEBE  Hither I speed with honest Glee  Such as befits the Mind that's free  Your chearful Troop blith Youth to join  And mix my social Joys with thine  Now may each Nymph and frolick Swain  O'er Mountain steep or level Plain  Court buxom Health while jocund Horn  Bids Echo wake the Sluggard Morn  AIR  When the Morning peeps forth and the Zephyr's cool Gale  Carries Fragrance and Health over Mountain and Dale  Up ye Nymphs and ye Swains and together we'll rove  Up Hill down the Valley by Thicket or Grove  Then follow with me where the Welkin resounds  With the Notes of the Horn and the Cry of the Hounds  Let the wretched be Slaves to Ambition and Wealth  All the Blessing we ask is the Blessing of Health  So shall Innocence' Self give a Warrant to Joys  No Envy disturbs no Dependence destroys  Then follow with me where the Welkin resounds  With the Notes of the Horn and the Cry of the Hounds  O'er Hill Dale and Woodland with Rapture we roam  Yet returning still find the dear Pleasures at Home  Where the chearful good Humour gives Honesty grace  And the Heart speaks Content in the Smiles of the Face  Then follow with me where the Welkin resounds  With the Notes of the Horn and the Cry of the Hounds  A Dance of Huntsmen and Huntresses  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Small Care my Friends your Youth annoys  Which only looks to present Joys  SYLVIA  Though the white Locks of silver'd Age  And long Experience hail thee Sage  Ill suits it in this Joy to wear  A Brow so overhung with Care  Better with us thy Voice to raise  And join a whole  Arcadia  's Praise  DAMAETAS  With you I joy that  Thyrsis  reigns  The Guardian o'er his native Plains  But Praise is scanty to reveal  The speaking Blessings all must feel  DAMON  True all must feelbut thankless too  Nor give to Virtue Virtue's due  My grateful Heart shall ever shew  The Debt I need not blush to owe  DAMON  AIR  That I go where I list that I sing what I please  That my Labour's the Price of Contentment and Ease  That no Care from abroad my Retirement annoys  That at home I can taste the true Family Joys  That my Kids wanton safely o'er Meadows and Rocks  That my Sheep graze secure from the Robber or Fox  These are Blessings I share with the rest of the Swains  For it's  Thyrsis  who gave them and  Thyrsis  maintains  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Perish my Voice if e'er I blame  Thy Duty to our Guardian's Name  His active Talents I revere  But eye them with a jealous Fear  Intent to form our Bliss alone  The generous Youth forgets his own  Nor e'er his busy Mind employs  To find a Partner of his Joys  So might his happy Offspring own  The Virtues which their Sire hath shewn  AIR  With Joy the Parent loves to trace  Resemblance in his Children's Face  And as he forms their docil Youth  To walk the steady Paths of Truth  Observes them shooting into Men  And lives in them Life o'er again  While active Sons with eager Flame  Catch Virtue at their Father's Name  When full of Glory full of Age  The Parent quits this busy Stage  What in the Sons we most admire  Calls to new Life the honour'd Sire  SYLVIA  RECITATIVE  O prudent Sage forgive the Zeal  Of thoughtless Youth▪ With thee I feel  The Glories now  Arcadia  shares  May but embitter future Cares  Oh mighty  Pan  attend  Arcadia  's Voice  Inspire direct and sanctify his Choice  SYLVIA  AIR  So may all thy  Sylvan  Train  Dryad Nymph and rustic Faun  To the Pipe and merry Strain  Trip it o'er the russet Lawn  May no Thorn or bearded Grass  Hurt their Footsteps as they pass  Whilst in Gambols round and round  They sport it o'er the shaven Ground  Though thy  Syrinx  like a Dream  Flying at the Face of Day  Vanish'd in the limpid Stream  Bearing all thy Hopes away  If again thy Heart should burn  In caressing  Blest and Blessing  May'st thou find a wish'd Return  CHORUS  O mighty  Pan  attend  Arcadia  's Voice  Inspire direct and sanctify his Choice  A Dance of Huntsmen and Huntresses  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Peace Shepherds peace with jocund Air  Which speaks a Heart unknown to Care  Young  Delia  hastes The glad Surprize  Of Rapture flashing from her Eyes  Enter  DELIA  DELIA  AIR  Shepherds Shepherds come away  Sadness were a Sin Today  Let the Pipe's merry Notes aid the Skill of the Voice  For our Wishes are crown'd and our Hearts shall rejoice  Rejoice and be glad  For sure he is mad  Who where Mirth and good Humour and Harmony's found  Never catches the Smile nor lets Pleasure go round  Let the stupid be grave  'Tis the Vice of the Slave  But can never agree  With a Maiden like me  Who is born in a Country that's happy and free  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  What means this Rapture  Delia  shew  Th' Event our Bosoms burn to know  DELIA  Now as I trod yon verdant Side  Where  Ladon  rolls its Silver Tide  All gayly deck'd in gorgeous State  Sail'd a proud Barge of richest Freight  Where sat a Nymph more fresh and fair  Than Blossoms which the Morning Air  Steals Perfume from the modest Grace  Of Maiden Blush bespread her Face  Hither it made and on this Strand  Pour'd its rich Freight for Shepherds' Land  Ladon  for this smooth flow thy Tide  The precious Freight was  Thyrsis'  Bride  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Stop Shepherds if aright I hear  The Sounds of Joy proclaim them near  Lets meet them Friends I'll lead the way  Joy makes me young again today  SCENE III  A View of the Sea with the Vessel at a Distance  Here follows a  PASTORAL PROCESSION  to the Wedding of  THYRSIS  PRIEST  RECITATIVE  Mighty  Pan  with tender Care  View this Swain and Virgin fair  May they ever thus impart  Just Return of Heart for Heart  May the Pledges of their Bliss  Climb their Knees to share the Kiss  May their steady blooming Youth  While they tread the Paths of Truth  Virtues catch from either Side  From the Bridegroom and the Bride  CHORUS  May their steady blooming Youth  While they tread the Paths of Truth  Virtues catch from either Side  From the Bridegroom and the Bride  The END
