 POEMS LUDICROUS SATIRICAL AND MORAL  SUSPENSA MANU  LONDON PRINTED FOR J FLETCHER IN ST PAUL'S CHURCHYARD  MDCCLXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE author of the following rhimes hath too much neglected the muses either to deserve or expect any great reputation as a poet He hath ever set so little store indeed by his poetical per∣formances as to be now able to procure copies of but few of those which have occasionally dropt from his pen It would be impertinent in him however to affect to undervalue what he is obtruding on the publick especially as most of the pieces contained in this collection have been frequently printed and therefore may be presumed to have met with some approbation  W KENRICK  CONTENTS  TO a gentleman who censured the author for scribbling verses p  Fine fights or the

YEAR MDCCLXV  YOU ask me why I spend my time  In fruitless ribaldry and rhime  On Criticks Poets Players  The Ministers of State you say  Would gladly take me into pay  And none so good as theirs  I thank ye but I've had to do  With Ministers as well as you  And know they're wond'rous civil  They'll promise places for your pains  But care not when they've suck'd your brains  If you were at the devil  Did war or rude rebellion shake  The court and make the city quake  I then my pen might draw  Not in these piping times of peace  When wealth with taxes must increase  And freedom's fix'd by law  I once indeed did such a thing  To serve my country and my king  And of my own accord  A king who had the grace and spirit  To know his friends and loyal merit  Could liberally reward  But since for truth may dare be just  False policy hath given disgust  While Nature's powerful charms  Woo'd me those hidden paths t'explore  Which Locke and Newton trod before  And won me to her arms  Not but relaxing now and then  Philosophy lays down the pen  When pictures poems plays  E'en musick's prostituted art  Engage the eye the ear the heart  Amusing various ways  Meanwhile an hour I'd rather sit  To look at Pritchard from the pit  Than kiss the papal toe  Nay rather than a monarch's hand  For Garrick there would even stand  'Till I could hardly go  While thus amus'd and thus employ'd  Life wears away not unenjoy'd  Tho' free from ill intention  Good providence but give me health  I envy no man's wit or wealth  Nor pine for place or pension  Let others write to please the rabble  In hopes some ministerial squabble  May pluck the fools a feather  Believe me I am no such fool  Like to be made the tool  Of knaves and fools together  FINE SIGHTS OR THE COUNTESS OF CY IN ELYSIUM  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLX  ON the banks of the Styx as a beautiful ghost  In resemblance the shade of the Goddess of Love  Was revolving the days when a countess and toast  She flaunted about in the regions above  News arriv'd which soon made all Elysium to ring  That the Fates a great monarch had summon'd to rest  In calling Old England's late father and king  To a crown of reward in the realms of the blest  My lady was vex'd to be robb'd of th' occasion  By dying before him so malapropos  Of seeing his royal young heir's coronation  And making a party herself in the show  She therefore in haste skipt away to the ferry  "Here Charon you're empty come take over me  "I'm resolv'd to go back to the world in your wherry  "The only fine sight I e'er miss'd of to see"  Old Charon most civilly bow'd to my lady  Stept out of his wherry and handed her in  But finding she wanted a pass was as ready  Her ladyship roughly to turn out again  Then skudding away to the court in a hurry  Direct for a passport to Pluto she ran  And put madam Proserpine into a flurry  Who thought she was come to seduce her good man  Gloomy Dis grimly smil'd at the lady's request  But more at her whimsical motive and reason  And having malignly a mind for a jest  Represented her suit as a thing out of season  I cannot said he lady fair with a frown  Indulge ev'ry ghost in it's wanton desire  But if for their sakes wife or husband come down  I then might restore the fond souls they require  Since Orpheus however in risk of his life  Long ago made us stare with his musick and passion  Not a soul hath come down or for husband or wife  So that journies of this kind are quite out of fashion  Yet as you're a beauty the favour I grant ye  But wherefore again should you covet on earth  To mix with a crowd that perhaps only want ye  To make you the theme of impertinent mirth  Besides pretty lady you're greatly mistaken  If pleasure you promise yourself in the sight  For unseen by your friends by admirers forsaken  There's none will regard an impalpable spright  Nay nay quoth the countess if that be the case  Take your passport again I'll have no more chagrin  A fig for fine sights if unseen one's fine face  What signifies seeing if one is not seen  AN EPISTLE TO MR GARRICK ON THE REPORT OF HIS HAVING LEFT THE STAGE  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCLXV  SO Mr Garrick is it true  As folks report the stage and you  Took a French leave at parting  We hop'd th' Italian air and diet  Had quite restor'd your health and quiet  And made you keen for starting  In vain we listen'd to the tales  Brought over by the foreign mails  That you were home returning  To see your name in capitals  Stuck up on tavernposts and walls  With fond impatience burning  Your wish'd arrival vain to boast  If never enter'd at the post  You shun the race of glory  As well you might have travell'd on  From Pope to Turk to Prester John  The world was all before ye  For to be plain Sir entre nous  'Twas not about your wife or you  We all were so solicitous  You might as well be there as here  If as king Richard Bayes or Lear  You mean no more to visit us  Your friends if friends they are indeed  Your spirit or your spleen may plead  From acting to excuse ye  But spite of what your friends declare  We your admirers cannot bear  To get you thus to lose ye  'Tis true they make a mighty stir  About you as a manager  Intent on reformation  Busy instructing in their parts  In claptrap attitudes and starts  The rising generation  But ah in vain removed from sight  The candles to improve the light  Tho' pleas'd the pit immensely  If all your pupils need the rod  As much as fiddlefaddle  Or blustering bouncing  To those who ne'er have Garrick seen  Such acting may not give the spleen  To me it is the devil  To sit three hours my noddle bare  To see yourrant and tear  And hear thatsnivel  I often as I come to town  In order to spare you a crown  Dine gratis with my printer  But damn it if I'm doom'd to see  Such mummers play instead of thee  I'll come no more this winter  ON THE INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH  AN EPISTLE TO LORENZO  TOO long have childish bards too long  Their hours employ'd in idle song  Busied the lineaments to trace  Of wither'd Fiction's painted face  Where not a native beauty blows  But cankers eat the budding rose  Yet captive to her smiles and wit  Pleas'd with their chains her slaves have writ  And all the labour'd pomp of verse  Employ'd her fables to rehearse  While thou O sacred Truth remain  The theme of ev'ry humbler strain  And yet believe what each pretends  And num'rous are her rhyming friends  While such her fond admirers prove  And tune their rival songs to love  But fools in fondness as in awe  The truth 'tis plain they never saw  And but themselves her lovers boast  Because her name the public toast  Still playing a fictitious part  No real passion at the heart  For say what lover's passion's true  For beauty that he never knew  So eastern monarch's love their wives  Tho' barren strangers all their lives  So lov'd la Mancha's famous knight  The Fair for whom he swore to fight  Fir'd by th' enthusiastic rage  With men and monsters to engage  Yet ask'd for whom this martial strife  He never saw her in her life  Nor was he positive God wot  Whether indeed she liv'd or not  Thus bards too oft in truth's defence  Break through the rules of common sense  And o'er his rival each t' aspire  Strives which shall prove the greatest liar  Strange to the liberty of thought  Vile slaves but seeking to be bought  To lying faction early train'd  A purchase by the truth disdain'd  Meantime as insolent as vain  They freedom's sacred name profane  And boasting hug the chains that bind  That worst of slaves the servile mind  Such Dryden thou immortal bard  Whose genius claims supreme regard  How honour'd might not truth accuse  Thy venal prostituted muse  Say'st thou 'tis strange the world should rest  Content by falsehood thus depress'd  Alas thou little know'st mankind  Who seeing imitate the blind  In spite of truth and open day  In darkness choose to grope their way  Suspecting plainness of disguise  The obvious sense of terms despise  From sound or derivation gleaning  Some farfetch'd dark and doubtful meaning  While each impostor's word prevails  In mystic parables and tales  Neglected e'en the word divine  If with it sense and reason join  Look back through each successive age  How honour'd the mysterious page  What millions have been the tools  Of knaves whose nat'ral prey is fools  How strangely trick'd deluded crowds  Who truth expecting from the clouds  And therefore gaping into th' air  On error stumbled unaware  Thus an astrologer of old  In learned history we're told  Contemplating the milky way  Neglected that before him lay  And led by wand'ring planets fell  Unluckily into a well  Yet e'er with slander branding those  Who seek the naked truth t' expose  Shortsighted mortals in their pride  Thus strive their ignorance to hide  By holding all beyond their view  Beyond investigation too  Lorenzo our misfortune here  Th' effect of idleness and fear  The sluggard shuns inquiry's task  Because too great the pains to ask  Stifling th' emotions of his breast  T' indulge his lazy brains in rest  A paradox yet such the fact  More fear to think than fear to act  In thought tho' danger we surmize  In act while real danger lies  In truth my friend 'tis sad to find  Hence rise the zeal of half mankind  Religion but the compound vice  Of indolence and cowardice  Ev'n pious christians much I fear  Are practically atheists here  How deaf and blind to calls of grace  When nature wears a smiling face  But when she frowns in wild amaze  Look how th' affrighted cowards gaze  When clouds drop fatness on the plains  In mildlysoft descending rains  In their due season harvests smile  And plenty crowns the peasant's toil  As nothing rare as nothing new  We take the blessing as our due  For O prosperity's a lot  At ease enjoy'd with ease forgot  In june's warm sun and april's shower  We trace not an almighty power  Ingrates so light of heav'n we make  Nor think the hand that gives may take  But ah when threat'ning storms arise  When thunders rattle through the skies  When the tall mountain bows its head  And earthquakes vomit up the dead  Behold whole nations prostrate fall  Before the mighty God of all  T' appease his anger now their care  Lo all is fasting sighs and pray'r  Till the dread storm blown haply o'er  They rise and revel as before  Forget or ridicule the rod  And laugh to scorn the fear of God  Nor only mov'd when danger's nigh  Our fears awake the gen'ral cry  Imaginary scenes alike  The dastard soul with terror strike  While to the coward's opticks seem  Light straws as each a giant's beam  In honour thus of God above  So weakly draw the cords of love  While nature's groans or fancy's fears  Drive headlong down the vale of tears  Lorenzo wouldst thou freely trace  Whence grows a cowardice so base  At th' early dawn of moral sense  Th' infatuation did commence  And propagated since by art  We all have more or less a part  Ere hermit bald or pilgrim grey  Had worn the solitary way  Ere yet the monk had told his beads  Ere yet credulity or creeds  To school with sober Reason sent  Young Genius to Experience went  The latter tho' as yet 'tis true  No wiser than the former two  In charge the tender pupils took  And with them read in Nature's book  So pedagogues unletter'd use  No class of blockheads to refuse  But gravely undertake t' explain  The arts themselves must first attain  Sufficient if the master goes  Before his blundering pupil's nose  Careful his vacant hours t' employ  Now Reason prov'd a hopeful boy  But Genius insolent and wild  By nature an assuming child  A treach'rous memory his lot  The little that he learn'd forgot  Nor gave himself a moments pain  To con his lessons o'er again  But trusting to his forward parts  Debauch'd with wit the sisterarts  Who yet unsettled young and frail  Enamour'd listen'd to his tale  And since the cause of dire disputes  Turn'd out abandon'd prostitutes  By priest and prophet once enjoy'd  To basest purposes employ'd  For ages past their only use  To vitiate reason or traduce  For this Tradition foremost came  Instruction was her maiden name  Now grown a smoothtongu'd slipp'ry jade  An arrant mistress of her trade  She told the stories o'er and o'er  That Genius told the Arts before  Repeating lies as liars do  Till in the end they think them true  And when detected in her lie  " Myst'ry"the biter's arch reply  By this fine dame our mothers taught  Their scheme of education wrought  So train'd us early to deceit  To look on Reason as a cheat  To lies first tun'd the op'ning ear  Awoke our earliest sense to fear  With monsters and chimeras vain  Fill'd the soft head and turn'd the brain  Till the fond fools to top their part  Fix'd the rank coward at the heart  Nor with our growing years releas'd  The nurse but moulds us for the priest  Who lest his ward grown sly or stout  Should find the knavish secret out  The bugbear from his reach removes  And all th' old woman's tale improves  Passions more riotous to quell  Chang'd the dark hole for darker hell  The truant damn'd for naughty play  Blackmonday now's the judgmentday  In promise hopes for toys are given  And endless holidays in heav'n  The groundless fear and vain desire  Which hence mankind in youth acquire  How deeply rooted do we find  How fix'd th' impressions on the mind  The weakness of those childish fears  Too oft increasing with our years  While ev'ry infant joy and strife  Improv'd is carried into life  For see the idiot and the wise  Each from his own fond shadow flies  Like curs that run till nature fails  A bladder fasten'd to their tails  With idle fears the world t' abuse  Assistant here th' inventive muse  The tale of wonder early taught  When playful young and void of thought  By stroling Fancy led astray  The vagrant troul'd the jovial lay  Alas of mirth and pleasure cur'd  To horror's brownest shade inur'd  By love of wonder since betray'd  To lend fantastic Spleen her aid  For whom her numbers sad and slow  In dismal melancholly flow  Condemn'd to murmur all the day  To sigh and groan the midnight lay  The skull the spade the shroud the herse  The doleful implements of verse  Or doom'd prepost'rous tales to tell  By brainsick Fiction brought from hell  For know th' unwary muse was caught  While Fiction yet her friend was thought  A hag by Ignorance badly nurs'd  With craving appetite accurs'd  To Spleen's embrace while yet a maid  The dire chlorosis had betray'd  Since when the wretch has roam'd abroad  Her sullen tyrant's willing bawd  A vile procuress to supply  The love of wonder with a lie  Hence bards that reason less than rail  Affect to tell the woeful tale  Or vent their moralizing rage  As bugbears of a fearful age  To truth pretending to be led  By megrims in the sick man's head  As if with zeal prophetic burn'd  The wretch whose blister'd head was turn'd  The fittest those the truth to teach  By fevers halfdepriv'd of speech  Whose fault'ring tongues most loud complain  When death or doctors shake the brain  Nor seldom by transition led  From dying moralists to dead  Tristful in hypocondres vex'd  The musing parson chews his text  Some solemn scene of dulness sought  To aid his rectitude of thought  The murky vaults the haunted cells  Where moping Melancholy dwells  And Fear that kneels in piteous plight  Her straggling hair all bolt upright  Fit comrades these as e'er could chuse  The splenetic or maudlin muse  Her doleful ditties proud to sing  Where sadness spreads her dusky wing  Where croaks the syren of the lake  The lightofheart from ease to wake  And solemn owls in concert grave  Join hoot the worldlywise to save  'Twas thus enthusiastic Young  'Twas thus affected Hervey sung  Whose motley muse in florid strain  With owls did to the moon complain  Clear'd at the morn her raven throat  To sound the glibber magpy's note  Meanwhile Religion gravely smil'd  To see grown Piety a child  In leadingstrings to find her led  By those her fost'ring hand had bred  For why confin'd the moral muse  To blasted oaks or baleful yews  O'er graves to make fantastick moan  And deepen Horror's dismal groan  Say hath alone the mould'ring tomb  For pious Meditation room  Ah wont with meekeyed Peace to rove  Through churchway path or silent grove  Her grateful influence round her shed  Where groan the sick or sleep the dead  With truth and soberness serene  Enliv'ning ev'ry solemn scene  Disarming Terror of it's pow'r  To wander at the midnight hour  Sweet Philomel harmonious spright  The only spectre of the night  Can love of truth impose the task  To lurk beneath a gorgon mask  To stalk in garb terrific clad  And scoul the weak and wicked mad  Or drive the wretch o'erwhelm'd with care  In godly frenzy to despair  Is folly vice fear makes it worse  Reflection is the coward's curse  Unless remorse in mercy given  To damn selfmurderers to heaven  Why then is sought the midnight shade  From vice or falsehood to dissuade  Is night less vicious than the day  Doth error guide the solar ray  Or is exhal'd like morning dew  The moral object or the true  O most ridiculous the scene  Where superstition feeds the spleen  Where the grey spectre stalks to view  As burns th' expiring taper blue  Or dances o'er the dizzy sight  The form of many a dreadful spright  Meanwhile a victim to his fears  The moonstruck moralist appears  For when the brain wild fancy fires  Reason most prudently retires  As sober men from drunkards part  For such companions griev'd at heart  Awes then with tremulous restraint  The painted urn or plaster saint  Humbles the mutilated bust  The rotten sinner to the dust  Lorenzo here no error make  Nor cowardice for conscience take  Alas repentance void of root  May blossom fair yet fail of fruit  Attrition vain and insincere  Mere weakness all unmanly fear  In the dark grove what horrour reigns  To chill the blood in Chiron's  A modern Centaur See the preface to a book entitled the Centaur not fabulous  veins  When th' ignisfatuus glares by night  Terrific witchcraft to his sight  Or animated by his fears  Alive the freshlopp'd elm appears  A giant ghost the dreadful bush  Shook by some formidable thrush  That nightly perching on its breast  Securely builds or tends her nest  While on the next tremendous spray  The nightingale repeats her lay  Th' heroic titmouse or the wren  Less timid than the sons of men  Who yet to conscience give the lie  And dare the pow'r of truth defy  For know no tremour can impart  Conviction to the skeptick's heart  Nor takes like agues in a fright  Trembling Impiety its flight  Behold the tyrant's iron hand  That holds in chains a captive land  In whose firm grasp imprison'd lies  Bold freedom struggling as it dies  Crush'd by whose weight the monarch bleeds  And sceptres break like blighted reeds  See this strong hand let fall the rod  And tremble if the bulrush nod  Belshazzar's like enervate fall  If laid a finger on the wall  The wretch of God nor man afraid  Yet trembling at an empty shade  Nor only fear th' immoral crew  The coward Pious tremble too  Philosophy herself a fool  Attended by her nurse to school  Such dupes to fear at times we find  The best the wisest of mankind  For Oh what antidote so strong  As poison that has work'd so long  What drug eradicates the pest  Suck'd from the mother's tainted breast  In vain the doctor we may try  No doctor's fee our cure can buy  Tho tamp'ring with the dire disease  Licentiates mock with present ease  And emp'ricks salving ev'ry sore  With nostrums make it rage the more  Sayst thou in policy afraid  To spoil the priest's and lawyer's trade  The statesman topping the divine  Supports with pow'r the same design  To keep th' inquisitive in awe  Smacking his longtail'd whip the law  Still thund'ring in the vulgar ear  Implicit faith and groundless fear  The nostrums these of church and state  To make a nation good and great  Thus forfeit patriots that pretence  They make as men to commonsense  Can ignorance be understood  As needful to the public good  That free inquiry such decry  And boast their salutary lie  Or are they here by habit led  And innovation's tumult dread  So sacred held the stated rules  Of Custom lawgiver to fools  Yet Custom's rules caprice has broke  And turn'd her statutes into joke  Nor boast her laws however old  Resistance to the pow'r of gold  Shall Science then still drag her chain  And sigh for liberty in vain  Forbid it heav'n that thus the mind  By tyrant policy confin'd  Should bow while Falsehood bears the sway  And give the cause of Truth away  Is this Lorenzo to be free  Are these the sweets of liberty  That glorious priv'lege yours and mine  In our own sties like sensual swine  At will to grumble eat and drink  But ah prohibited to think  Our nobler appetites denied  Their proper food and damn'd for pride  Forbad our reason to employ  Depriv'd of each sublimer joy  Robb'd of the privilege to know  Man's chief prerogative below  May Britons boast of all mankind  The nobler fortitude of mind  To set blind prejudice apart  To rend th' old woman from the heart  To laugh at blind tradition's rules  The mother and the nurse of fools  Have they with blood so dearly bought  Their boasted privilege of thought  To throw like schoolboys tir'd with play  The long disputed prize away  Ah had not custom often fail'd  What barbarism had still prevail'd  Deaf to the call of truth and grace  Denying reformation place  What lengths still stubborn faith had run  To end what madd'ning zeal begun  In honour still of Moloch's name  Our children might have pass'd the flame  By persecution's faggot rais'd  Religious fires in Smithfield blaz'd  Or now as in a Stuart's reign  Been dy'd with blood Iërne's plain  Nay still how prepossess'd we find  With pious falsehoods half mankind  Think from the stake how late repriev'd  Wretches no charity reliev'd  Oh horror to the slaughter led  For wearing rags and wanting bread  Doom'd by inhuman legal rage  Martyrs to poverty and age  The unhappy victims to an act of parliament not long since repealed by virtue of which many hundreds of poor wretches were formerly hanged or burnt for witchcraft    See still th' enthusiastic band  Cant whine and madden o'er the land  By scripturecraz'd fanaticks led  Whitfield or Westley at their head  See ev'n the learning of our schools  Perverted to bewilder fools  The words of plainness to disguise  And baffle reason with surprize  While truth and nature plead in vain  Against the comment of Romaine  A famous Hutchinsonian divine of the church of England    Ah think how fatal soon or late  Such crazy members to the state  How dang'rous to the public weal  Blind ignorance and foolish zeal  Reflect in what a dreadful hour  Nonsense usurp'd the hand of power  When puritans the land o'errun  And sacrilege was pious fun  While wretches for their country's good  Dipt their vile hands in royal blood  Is ignorance the curse of God  Avert good Heav'n th' impending rod  O leave ye patriots leave the mind  In search of knowledge unconfin'd  Lest Truth your cunning should despise  Returning to its native skies  If men were not to delare their opinions in spite of establish∣ments either in church or state truth would be soon banished the earth Dedication to Essay on Spirit    Good policy to truth's ally'd  By science guided not its guide  Cease too ye bards so wond'rous wise  T' instruct by means you should despise  In sober sadness much too long  Mankind have listen'd to your song  Have strain'd the mental eye to see  Your false fantastic imag'ry  With gaudy colours glaring bright  To captivate the vulgar sight  The gaping idiot's grin of praise  Or stare of ignorance to raise  Nay tho' approv'd your moral ends  Ye still are truth's mistaken friends  Ah full as dang'rous to her cause  As even those who spurn her laws  No visionary fears intrude  Where triumphs moral rectitude  Truth all the artifice disdains  Of dungeons deep and clanking chains  Skulks not in life's sequester'd way  But walks abroad in open day  'Tis Falsehood her grim face to hide  Shuffles on nature's darkest side  Baffling in Terror's murky den  The scrutiny of honest men  THE FORCE OF PREJUDICE  A FABLE  THE HINT FROM HELVETIUS  ONCE on a time or story lies  A deity forsook the skies  And rambling curious up and down  Enter'd at length an Afric town  Where liv'd a tribe of mortals black  With each a hump upon his back  A burthen common to the nation  Thro' each such successive generation  The comely god wellshap'd and fair  March'd forward with a graceful air  While gathering round the gaping throng  Wonder'd and hooted him along  This gave a kick and that a thump  All crying Where's the fellow's hump  The females too among the rest  Their detestation loud express'd  While luscious jokes were cut and crack'd  To see a man so slender back'd  Eager each flirt to have a fling  At such a pale fac'd ugly thing  Nay heav'n knows where their taunts had ended  If fate the god had not befriended  But so it chanc'd a sober sage  Advanc'd rever'd for sense and age  Made wise by time and observation  His knowledge glean'd from ev'ry nation  He whites had seen as well as blacks  No mountains bearing on their backs  And knew from reasons consequential  Colour and form were not essential  Yet still too wise to call in doubt  The wisdom of the rabble rout  He thus the stranger to protect  Address'd the mob with due respect  "O give my friends your insults o'  "Nor vex this hapless creature more  "What tho' before our eyes we see  "A lump of fair deformity  "Not e'en a molehill on his shoulder  "To captivate one black beholder  "But like an unshap'd log he stands  "Unfinish'd left by nature's hands  "Yet mock him not in cruel pride  "For wanting what the gods deny'd  "'Tis affectation makes the fool  "No object this of ridicule  "It might have been your fate or mine  "To want the human hump divine  And each of us an ugly sight  Might have flatshoulder'd been and white  If therefore heav'n to us so kind  Gives the protuberance behind  Thanks to the gods with fervour pay  But send this wretch unhurt away"  The mob on ev'ry word intent  With some few murmurings gave consent  When now the sage the god address'd  And thus dismiss'd the injur'd guest  "On earth a welcome wouldst thou find  "Go hence and learn to know mankind  "In other lands thy form and face  "May challenge comeliness and grace  "But here to beauty are we blind  "If wanting of a hump behind  "Thus ev'ry nation ev'ry tribe  "Peculiar sentiments imbibe  "And beauty virtue sense lay claim  "To little more than empty name  "Varied in every clime and nation  "As suits the general situation  "Hence judging each by diff'rent rules  "They think each other knaves or fools  "While no defect or vice is known  "Unless it differ from their own  "To turn the shafts of scorn aside  "Then take this maxim for your guide  "Go where you will be sure to wear  "The gen'ral hump the people bear  "He's ne'er accounted fool or rogue  "Whose vice or folly is in vogue"  A FAMILIAR EPISTLE TO A FRIEND OCCASIONED BY THE AUTHOR'S SEEING HIS NAME IN THE LIST OF DEATHS IN A MAGAZINE  NO doubt ere this the magazine  Your monthly nostrum for the spleen  Hath reach'd your hands at K  The list of deaths of course you've read  Turn'd up your eyes and shook your head  And cry'd goodlackaday  But having not deserv'd so ill  That in your testamental will  I should be quite forgotten  I'm thinking how the folks will stare  If kindly you should make an heir  Of one thought dead and rotten  Thus to prevent mistakes I send  T' assure my best my worthiest friend  His magazine tells lies  So the maim'd soldier 'mong the slain  Just ready to be stripp'd in pain  Aloud for mercy cries  For men may lose a limb or wife  Yet lead a notunpleasant life  Nor pine away with sorrow  Hearty as any buck alive  And little more than thirtyfive  Why may'nt I live tomorrow  I hear you clearing up your brow  Reply "You live wild Cozbut how  "How live youTell me that  "For tho' perhaps I am not willing  "To cut you off with just a shilling  "If said 'tis done that's flat  "Pray tell me are you rich or poor  "Can'st keep the wolfdogs from the door  "How stand you with his grace  "How comes it such quick parts as yours  "Get not some pretty sinecures  "A pension or some place"  Why faith good Sir to tell you true  I wish I were as rich as you  But prodigal in grain  At school my little weekly cash  Went all in whips and tops and trash  Improvident of gain  Nor growing up did e'er I chuse  For lords to fetch and carry news  Like spaniels for a crust  With bread by labour earn'd I'd rather  Keep soul and body just together  Till dust return to dust  Contented I can sit

Calls in a leisure hour to spend  And nurse my winter's fire  Rich knaves in gilded coaches roll  And truly pity from my soul  What half the world admire  Not that I've learn'd in stoic school  To live and move by line and rule  NoIf I had it friend  My lavish soul could give away  With rapture more in half a day  Than dukes in years could spend  For others have I drawn a bill  I've paid itorI owe it still  And want no credit yet  You know what Milton's devil says  "True gratitude tho nought it pays  "Is ever out of debt"  My youthful errors then forgive  And know I live and how I live

Thy failing pencil 'gainst the pen  Or Churchill scorning to give out  Should prove less merciful than stout  To an apt tale an equal friend  To both requests you to attend  Three sisters daughters of the Town  A family of some renown  Together liv'd tho' single lives  Jangling as husbands and their wives  The first like Tristram nam'd in haste  Was christen'd by misnomer Taste  A splenetic and formal prude  Averse to all that's low or rude  Fainting at ev'ry odious jest  And starch as any quaker drest  So nice so sinical so quaint  No sinner sure so much a saint  For this was all a fair outside  Her vice and vanity to hide  The second a fantastic dame  As modish in her dress as name  A batter'd strumpet Fashion hight  The bane of many a living wight  A grey coquet whose magic pow'r  Tho' wasting with the present hour  Her charms deciduous but decay  To sprout again some future day  While thus alternate youth and age  By turns her votaries engage  And still with constancy maintain  Her most inconstant tyrant reign  The third a female full of zeal  Still flaming for the commonweal  Tho as her sister Fashion guides  Alternate taking different sides  Now a rank Tory talking big  And now a grumbling stedfast Whig  Or when no business of the nation  Sets her warm blood in fermentation  As keen she flies at lower game  A poet's or a painter's fame  Alike she raves alike she bounces  About pink furbelows and flounces  In every cause sincere and hearty  Her name as well as nature Party  Now ancient maids and barren wives  Who lead unprofitable lives  Full often keep the devil rout 'em  A pack of animals about 'em  Dogs cats or monkies substitutes  For children oft less natural brutes  Thus did our jarring sisters three  Keep a wellstock'd menagerie  Whither each quadruped and biped  By gentle treatment was invited  Or bird or beast or fair or frightful  For the more strange the more delightful  Accordingly in numbers came  Domestic foreign wild and tame  From Stade and Norway noble rats  From Italy fine warbling cats  Taught by Marcel himself to dance  A troop of apes skipp'd o'er from France  From Turkey tutor'd in the east  An Irish renegado beast  That like a Bornean ape could swing  And trot upon an iron string  Next from St Omer's learned college  There came a prodigy of knowledge  A Chien Sçavant or dog of parts  At least a bachelor of arts  That knew the Greek and Latin better  Than all th' academy BellesLettres  But more than all a dancing Bear  And fav'rite Pug engag'd their care  The latter as a dog of merit  Was cherish'd for his former spirit  For he tho' now much past his prime  Had been an odd dog in his time  Would fetch and carry leap o'er sticks  And play a thousand comic tricks  Him had our ladies long preferr'd  To be their doughty bodyguard  Hence in the parlour was he plac'd  And with a silver collar grac'd  On a soft velvet cushion seated  And by all three most kindly treated  Whence growing insolent and proud  He growl'd so fierce and bark'd so loud  That not another dog or cat  About the house dar'd smell a rat  Or set a foot into the parlour  For fear of this eternal snarler  Who like a greedy envious elf  Lov'd no one creature but himself  Rough Bruin but as yet a cub  Unlick'd and yet unwean'd from bub  Was boarded with a neighb'ring vicar  And nurtur'd with his fav'rite liquor  Hence growing sturdy and mischievous  He oft committed outrage grievous  Made a cat's paw of Tom's the mouser  And plagu'd to death poor harmless Touzer  Drown'd old Grimalkin and in ire  Threw playful kittens in the fire  For out of wantonness or spite  In mischief lay his sole delight  Tho' some excuse him and will say  That what he did was but in play  The maggots of a dancing bear  To make the people hoot and stare  As if dame Nature form'd one half  The world to make the other laugh  At length however most unruly  He fell upon his keeper truly  And when corrected threw him down  And trampled on the parson's gown  Made e'en a kennel of the church  And left his feeders in the lurch  Meanwhile as strolling up and down  The sport and terror of the town  His brother brutes he chanc'd to see  That lodg'd in the menagerie  Here the first scene that caught his eye  Was a broad stage erected high  On which a set of mimic apes  Play'd monkeytricks in various shapes  Grinn'd chatter'd laugh'd and made such faces  That Bruin piqu'd at their grimaces  Scrambled aloft resolv'd to rout 'em  And with his bear's paws laid about him  Hugging each monkeydog and bitch  As loving Satan hugg'd the witch  While the poor devils scream'd aloud  The jest and pity of the crowd  Next in a neighb'ring charnel vault  He smok'd a pack of hounds at fault  By some spay'd bitch's nose misled  To snuffie there among the dead  In search of Fanny's knocking ghost  Of whom the scent in earth was lost  But Bruin never wanted scent  After whatever game he went  But smelt her out and to be doing  Fell foul upon a brother Bruin  Pomposo fam'd as rude a bear  As e'er was shewn in Southwark fair  Illfavour'd clumsy and uncouth  The veriest monster of the booth  His waters Bruin closely watch'd  When hurt Pomposo overmatch'd  And fairly worsted in the fray  Growl'd and turn'd tail and slunk away  Flush'd with success and fond of fame  Now Bruin ran at higher game  Nay some tho' these we don't rely on  Pretend he dar'd t' attack the lion  But brutes as well as men 'tis known  Pay a due deference to the throne  Certain it is he made fine sport  Of th' o'ergrown jackals of the court  And caus'd the rest to quake for fear  Around the country far and near  These triumphs envious Pug had seen  And halfdevour'd with spight and spleen  Another quadruped to see  More fear'd and mischievous than he  Resolv'd t'assail this mighty beast  Or give himself such airs at least  That folks might think he did not fear him  So growl'd whenever he came near him  His mistress Party hence mistaken  Till much too late to save his bacon  Unequal match her fav'rite's ruin  Slipt poor presumptuous Pug at Bruin  Unknowing that tho' bark he might  His toothless gums no more could bite  But roughlygentle Bruin seiz'd  And softly first old Puggy squeez'd  Who thinking all the mischief done  His foe could do kept barking on  When now enrag'd at hapless Pug  He gave him such a cursed hug  That well nigh all his bones he broke  So dev'lish serious was the joke  Then threw the limping snarler down  To howl and piss about the town  Such ever is the fate of those  Who wantonly make folks their foes  Or quarrelsome provoke the fight  With bravoes of superior might  And thus e'en Bruin's self may catch  A tartar who may prove his match  And to some future tyger bow  As low as Pug to him doth now  ON HAPPINESS AND THE INCAPACITY OF MANKIND FOR ITS ATTAINMENT  AN EPISTLE TO LORENZO  DO wits this maxim still profess  "That man was born for happiness  "Tho tow'rs of hope he fondly raise  "Their structure lasting all his days  "In expectation ev'n possessing  "The better half of ev'ry blessing  "His bliss for ever in his view  "Whene'er he pleases to pursue"  My friend with care such maxims weigh  Nor run with giddy wits astray  Genius in search of truth may roam  But bliss if found is found at home  To region clime nor soil confin'd  This boasted seed of heav'nly kind  Ah vainly boasted if below  The plant celestial cannot grow  Say sophists neither more nor less  Than happiness is happiness  Yet will they boast this state unknown  This bliss indefinite their own  The diff'rence plain 'twixt bliss and woe  Whate'er we feel we surely know  What state can then be ever thine  Which sense nor science can define  That man by others is't confess'd  Ne'er is but still is to be blest  Yet would they teach in moral strain  How all may happiness attain  As well who ne'er was bless'd with light  May boast the happiness of sight  The splendour of the solar ray  Or teach his comrades blind their way  As such to thee make ever known  A state of being ne'er their own  Dost thou to prove my judgment wrong  In answer quote thy fav'rite song  True bliss thy Pope if we believe  All hands can reach all heads conceive  See Pope's Essay on Man  The happiness of each confin'd  In truth to that of all our kind  But terms so gen'ral nought define  The bliss of all not yours nor mine  For yet distinctly's understood  The public from the private good  Nor doth it prove this maxim right  To say that both in one unite  Unless their union be so plain  That seeking one we both obtain  Since th' individual for himself  Applies to riot fame or pelf  In spite of all the wise can say  We seek our bliss a sep'rate way  Just as the present maggots bite  Take our own measures for the right  Or having no peculiar whim  Along the tide of custom swim  Meanwhile tho all of bliss dispute  None leave their darling substitute  "How short of happiness is gold"  The miser cries yet keeps his hold  "In women" sighs the batter'd rake  "What solid comfort can we take"  "Ah what in wine" Silenus asks  Yet cart the whore go stave the casks  "How shall the sons of Comus live  "If wine nor women life will give"  Thus public happiness our care  But for our own peculiar share  While sons their father's hopes traduce  And here even patriotism's abuse  However then the specious face  Of wit may countenance the case  Bliss inconsistently we call  The happiness of one and all  Nor is it yet precisely meant  By good ease pleasure or content  Good might we variously explain  Ease is deliv'rance but from pain  Pleasure is actual joy confess'd  And mere content but patient rest  A neutral state at best and worst  But negatively blest or curst  That which our happiness we call  Tho that nor this the sum of all  The word's plain meaning's plainly this  Some constant state of actual bliss  No matter whether in degree  Alike bestow'd on you or me  Enough if void of fear or pain  No motive lead us to complain  Enough whate'er the mode of joy  If such that it can never cloy  Look round the world and tell me true  Where is such happiness in view  From monarchs fled as sings the bard  His patron's virtue to reward  Tell me in truth was St John blest  Or did the bitter bard but jest  Dipping his pen in worse than gall  An outed statesman bless'd to call  With equal truth the Muse might paint  My lord of Bolingbroke a saint  Run riot o'er his dubious fame  And dub him with a patriot's name  So worthy of his country's praise  So meek so holy all his ways  Nor tho to him to him alone  A state of perfect bliss unknown  Of each complexion age degree  Mankind as far remov'd as he  Go ask my friend from door to door  The high the low the rich the poor  In court or cot if here or there  Resides the mortal free from care  You ask in vain for joy and strife  Diversify all states of life  To wield the scythe with sweaty brow  With wearied arm to guide the plough  To sow in hope to reap in joy  Thine Labour is the sweet employ  A life of rest with pain t'endure  To seek in health disease's cure  To eat the grape unprun'd the vine  Laborious Idleness is thine  Yet idleness of care complains  And labour quarrels with its pains  Nor only found or made distress  Because externals fail to bless  Lodg'd in ourselves the taste and will  That make externals good or ill  No earthly blessing hence we find  An equal good to all mankind  Belmore the sober'st thing on earth  Dreads the broad laugh and roar of mirth  While Clerrio with a length of chin  Protracted by perpetual grin  Tho' Socrates himself pass by  Must laugh in ridicule or die  How elegant how high refin'd  The palate of Cardella's mind  How low how vulgar Cotta's soul  That feels no rapture in a vole  See thousands as in love with strife  Pursue it fretting all their life  And darken with the clouds of spleen  The sky of providence serene  Wretched to find another eas'd  And most unhappy when they're pleas'd  How strange while some with patient toil  Raise comfort on a barren soil  Or pleasure strike by native dint  From cruel Fortune's hardest flint  The patriarch like whose rod we're told  Earth's stubborn fetters burst of old  When gush'd the stream from Horeb's rock  To water Israel's thirsty flock  Hence not on earth a blessing sent  Gives universally content  For while so varied is our taste  Manna itself were show'r'd to waste  With reason therefore we profess  God meant not here our happiness  Else in the various blessings given  Sure various minds might find their heaven  But know as different we find  Each individual's turn of mind  As little with ourselves we see  Ourselves at various times agree  So oft our views our tempers change  As through life's varied scenes we range  At times so diff'rent from himself  The prodigal will hoard his pelf  Spend greedily the night at play  To throw next morn his gains away  At times ev'n misers rob their store  And give their sixpence to the poor  At times ev'n trembling cowards fight  And desp'rate put the bold to flight  While sick of fighting and of fame  The brave as belgic lions tame  How oft my friend in private life  We love the maid we hate a wife  How oft the scene that gives delight  At morn offends the eye at night  'Tis not the want of that or this  Possession is the bane of bliss  And hence of happiness we see  On earth th' impossibility  Yet with an interested view  Doth still Lorenzo truth pursue  Dost thou suppose th' enlighten'd mind  In truth's researches bliss may find  That science fancy may restrain  And fix that weathercock the brain  Alas deceive thy self no more  But give thy vain pretensions o'er  For as a world of fruitless cost  In vain inquiries hath been lost  A world of labour spent t' attain  That knowledge man may never gain  So millions all their lives have spent  Searching for bliss in discontent  For bliss which but a little thought  Had told them never could be taught  Yet still they ask yet still they run  A race that never can be won  Thus sought of yore projecting fools  The summum bonum of the schools  And wiser heads than those of old  The stone converting all to gold  Or vain adepts much wiser still  To wrest from nature's band at will  Promethean theft celestial fire  To animate their wood and wire  Madmen that not Monro could cure  Of circles and their quadrature  Of thinking drunken nature reels  Like a slung coach on springs and wheels  Dost thou instructed in thy youth  To place consummate bliss in truth  Conceive it somewhere hidden lies  Among the learned and the wise  That hence our bliss or misery flow  The truth to know or not to know  In vain the learn'd in science deep  In search of bliss their vigils keep  In vain the universe explore  Swift as their search it flies before  Through ev'ry clime on ev'ry wind  And leaves the panting wish behind  O tell me what connection ties  So close the happy and the wise  Did e'er the sage in wisdom find  The artless infant's peace of mind  Proud knowledge e'er or boastful art  Restore to joy the broken heart  Ah what avails the truth to know  When truth's the frequent source of woe  While gilded fiction's dazzling rays  With sunshine beautify our days  Or mildly shed its silver beams  Reflected light our nightly dreams  While pleasure and its laughing train  Dance by the moonshine of the brain  For what is knowledge but to know  How ignorant our state below  The more we learn the more to find  Beyond our learning still behind  Our fruitless wishes to increase  Whene'er our mental prospects cease  So far from happiness my friend  Is science in its means and end  Sayst thou that bliss the world affect  The smile of God on his elect  Confin'd to Abr'am's faithful seed  And made dependent on our creed  Go ask the saints to whom are given  The best assurances of heaven  The few distinguish'd here on earth  As children of a spiritual birth  How gloomy oft a state of grace  How often hid their Maker's face  How oft by satan and by sin  Sore buffeted the man within  These all confess beyond the sky  Their blissful heritage doth lie  Say is repos'd this heav'nly trust  Within the bosom of the just  While virtue in itself you call  The happiness of one and all  Pretending still "tho' yours and mine  "No partial mode of bliss define  "Yet that our different tastes unite  "In meaning well and thinking right  "An universal moral this  "Conducting all mankind to bliss"  Alas what sophistry to tell  Of "thinking right and meaning well"  Pope  Unless this rectitude of thought  With perspicuity be taught  This honest meaning plainly shown  So oft admir'd so little known  At virtue if we're left to guess  What is't to say 'tis happiness  The way to virtue as to bliss  If dubious that as doubtful this  How fruitless therefore but to know  "Virtue is happiness below"  Sayst thou mankind are all agreed  That happiness is virtue's meed  The service of the work inquire  And by the labour rate the hire  Now virtue some to fact confine  While others place it in design  Some blest but for the good they do  Others for all they have in view  But if by virtue's understood  The mere intent of doing good  Those fully virtuous may be held  Who ne'er one lawless passion quell'd  Whom ne'er temptation led astray  Beyond the tenour of their way  A sober path by stoicks trod  Nor friends to man nor foes to God  Consistent with a state of rest  If virtue's centred in the breast  As happy those may surely live  Who nothing give nor have to give  As those who taste in ev'ry sense  Th' exertions of benevolence  Some seeming difference yet we find  What pangs affect the tender mind  What exquisite sensations rise  To hear the orphan's piteous cries  To feel the widow's piercing woe  When no relief we can bestow  Doth virtue here rejoice the heart  As when the gen'rous ease impart  When purest transports warm the breast  That glows to succour' the distress'd  And yet my friend 'twere wond'rous hard  If bliss the virtuous rich reward  In poverty that virtue's zeal  Should double all the pangs we feel  Each gen'rous sigh each social tear  But render want the more severe  To virtue therefore if the deed  Our best designs must yet succeed  Granting that happy ev'ry mind  In such proportion as its kind  Here in externals do we place  The happiness of human race  Enabled to relieve distress  As wealth or pow'r ourselves possess  For bliss capacitated more  As blest with fortune's worldly store  Fix'd by this scheme the blissful state  Exclusive to the rich and great  The virtuous poor but innocent  Claiming at th' utmost bare content  Besides if individuals blest  As sharers only with the rest  True happiness with thee to call  Not merely that of one but all  What is inactive virtue's use  Can it to social good conduce  Can it thus fruitless and confin'd  Be call'd a blessing to mankind  If then we judge so much amiss  Of virtue and of virtuous bliss  If faith tho crown'd with alms and pray'rs  Hath all its pangs hath all its cares  While ev'n from knowledge prospects rise  That makes us miserably wise  His perfect happiness to reach  No morals mortal man can teach  Still Heav'n's b  st vot'ries must confess  No blessings here compleatly bless  A compound strange of bliss and woe  Man's variable state below  Some absent something ours to crave  Ev'n from the cradle to the grave  How idly then employ'd the mind  In search of that we cannot find  For human bliss stands never still  Our good insep'rable from ill  Whilst all of pain and pleasure share  Their hour of joy their hour of care  Adapted to each sev'ral state  Fix'd and determinate as fate  The world my friend an ample field  Of such examples store doth yield  How throbs the infant's little breast  Beneath a load of care oppress'd  The care that issues with a sigh  The tear yet standing in the eye  Or caught in laughter's dimple sleek  Dry'd up in stealing down the cheek  See next among the sachel'd crowd  Bold as a hero and as proud  The little tyrant of his class  How happy till condemn'd to parse  Or sob beneath the weightier curse  Of scanning Lilly's crabbed verse  In youth how glows the vital fire  'Tween expectation and desire  Our sanguine hopes our aukward fears  All suiting unexperienc'd years  Still riper joys do manhood bless  When fullblown fortune we possess  We riot on the joyous store  Till health and strength can charm no more  When disappointment and chagrin  Retaliate all our joys with spleen  Proportion'd next to wasted age  Insipid joys and peevish rage  Tho dim th' exhausted passions burn  Take to our latest gasp their turn  Thus relative my friend we find  The pains and pleasures of mankind  Adapted all in due degree  To human sensibility  For see no more alive to smart  Than dead to joy the hardofheart  As far from rapture as despair  The fretful family of care  Not sickness pain nor death itself  Avarus dreads like loss of pelf  While Lavish offers an estate  To staunch a cut ere yet too late  Dispel the headach or remove  Th' effects of his intemp'rate love  Was ever yet the child of mirth  Intensely blest or curst on earth  Ah no how lightly feel a pain  The lightofheart or lightofbrain  The man so happy as to think  Life's bitter potions born to drink  Behold the foolish weak and blind  The sprightliest merriest of mankind  While suffers oft superiour sense  Ev'n from its own preeminence  Those follies that the wise annoy  The destituteofwisdom's joy  The blockhead naturally free  From cares thy knowledge brings on thee  While Heav'n you daily toil to seek  Poor Ralpho works but once a week  When left his plough and worldly cares  He plies his Sunday's task at pray'rs  Nor puzzled he in truth's research  Laid all his burthen on the church  The friendly church by Heav'n design'd  To help the weak to lead the blind  To check the rash to warm the cold  T'engage the young t'amuse the old  Th' unthinking from themselves to save  And bring them calmly to the grave  Blest ignorance from care so free  Hath it Lorenzo charms for thee  Wouldst thou to science empty name  If void of bliss resign thy claim  Be like the ass that plodding goes  Nor looks beyond his bridled nose  For meO rather should I ask  Life's most laborious abject task  Would ev'n the meanest lot sustain  Bear ev'ry tolerable pain  To emp'ricks would intrust my cure  Ev'n to be pitied might endure  Nay plague me Heav'n in ev'ry sense  Ere take my share of reason hence  Of science ere my soul deprive  My little portion whilst alive  Yet dost thou ignorance despise  The joys of knowledge hence arise  So strange so little understood  The varied source of mortals' good  To Heav'n my grateful vows be paid  That man in human frailty's made  That grief and ignorance my lot  In joy and science since forgot  Or best remember'd in the taste  They give improvement's rich repast  O say industrious querist say  What raptures court you on the way  What views delight from time to time  As the steep hills of art you climb  Such transports ne'er had fir'd my breast  If born of sciences possess'd  As when by want of knowledge fir'd  To nature's lore I late aspir'd  By slow degrees enlighten'd grew  Her volume op'ning to my view  To the weak mind as knowledge given  Knowledge that wings the soul for Heaven  Lorenzo is this doctrine strange  Seest thou not while the seasons change  How much as each in contrast felt  We freeze with cold by heat we melt  Thus exquisite our sense of woe  As more refin'd our pleasures grow  Pleasure and pain as light and shade  By one the other still display'd  Didst never want to thee denied  The bliss of being satisfied  In constant fulness but enjoy'd  Th' insipid good of which we're cloy'd  Say plenty gives thee bread more white  It blunts the edge of appetite  Or giving wine malignly first  Robs thee distasteful of thy thirst  How sunk and terrible to thee  The hollow eye of poverty  While Villius meets her with a smile  And sings or whistles all the while  Tho worn his hands perplex'd his head  He relishes the sweets of bread  Nay patient sees in want itself  His curstless cupboard's vacant shelf  Full many a time in pleasant rue  Dancing for joy without a shoe  Is Fortunatus rich and gay  Curst with the modish itch of play  Bubbl'd at White's thro lust of gain  Or jockey'd round NewMarket plain  See with his barb his manors fly  His leaseholds totter with the die  Braving the storm of many a cast  His oaks a bet malignant blast  His cardbuilt villas one and all  Like infant architecture fall  From sharpers creditors and duns  Not half the perils Villius runs  Whom all the world to trust refuse  Who nothing owns he dreads to lose  Ah me what threat'ning danger's nigh  Why swells the tear in Delia's eye  Eclips'd the fairest of the fair  By sad misfortune's drooping air  Delia on whom kind nature smil'd  Ev'n at the birth her fav'rite child  When all the graces to combine  She cloath'd them in one form divine  Bestowing grandeur wit and wealth  And fortune's best of bounties health  Nay adding in her gen'rous fit  Goodnature even to her wit  With all these blessings yet unblest  Ah tell me fair one why distress'd  Alas alas the belle's reply  "Of Brilliante's birtyday suit I die'  You smile at misery like this  Match it with Delia's sense of bliss  In rapture ever with the gay  To shine at concert ball or play  Her greatest happiness to boast  Her name the fopling's reigning toast  The all in life her wish regards  Summ'd up in fashions routs and cards  Ah then how pow'rful to distress  Th' important article of dress  So deeply some may cares affect  Those trifling cares that you neglect  Half the solicitude we see  Ridiculous to you and me  Others there are as lightly hold  Dangers at which our blood runs cold  Lo where beneath th' impending cliff  The Norway fowler moors his skiff  Or desp'iate fifty fathoms high  Suspended seems himself to fly  While thus from rock to rock he swings  And blythe his summer's ditty sings  As blythe the seaboy furls the sail  Regardless of the blust'ring gale  Nor winds nor waves disturb his sleep  Amid the horrours of the deep  The cordial draught the downy bed  Had ne'er reviv'd the drooping head  Had sickness pale and fainting grief  Ne'er wish'd for wearied nerves relief  See Belmont on the sofa laid  What racking pains his limbs invade  Take half his gout the respite given  He calls a blissful taste of heaven  Give but a youth dispersing wealth  Who riots on the bloom of health  That blissful part which yet remains  And his a mortal's bitter'st pains  Pains which no aggravation know  Yet so comparative our woe  Inflict them when Cleora's kiss  Kind earnest of approaching bliss  Hath rais'd the glowing lover's fire  To flaming raptures of desire  Lo disappointment joins the curse  And turns this worst affliction worse  Correct ideas let us gain  Our sense of joy we owe to pain  So strange a paradox is this  And mis'ry to our sense of bliss  While such our varying state below  Ev'n joy degen'rates into woe  And pains in sufferance by degrees  On their own pangs engender ease  Their antidote like poison bring  T'expel the poison of their sting  The tension of th'extended nerve  With physiologists may serve  The means of pleasure and of pain  The seeming paradox t'explain  As strung the harp with trembling wire  So brac'd with nerves the human lyre  While such in tune these sages say  The smiling hours in concert play  But if in change too lax or tense  Health strikes no more the keys of sense  But tremblingly alive all o'er  The tortur'd strings in discord roar  While sickness with her harpy claws  Stranger to each harmonious pause  Labours benumb'd the jarring strain  That stuns our ear with deaf'ning pain  Nor yet can health too oft repeat  Its musick howsoever sweet  While by degrees lo ev'ry string  Depriv'd of its elastic spring  In gen'ral lassitude full soon  The whole machine grows out of tune  Should also passion sense or art  Wind up too high the nervous part  With noise the notes tumultuous tire  Or breaking strings unman the lyre  Of pain or pleasure on our frame  Th' effects hence frequently the same  Thus full of gladness or of grief  In tears we find the same relief  Alike the feeble nerve destroy  Exquisite pain extatic joy  The bandit stretch'd upon the wheel  Th' extreme of torture ne'er can feel  But cruelty disarming lies  Or dead to sense or really dies  So rapture never meant to bless  E'vn joy grows pain when in excess  Indulg'd to print the burning kiss  On Chloe's lips how fierce the bliss  How keen the torture of her charms  Caress'd to pant within her arms  Melting in fulness of desire  Stretch'd on the rack of bliss t'expire  Thus constitutional below  Is all our bliss is all our woe  Each holding intimately join'd  Alternate empire o'er the mind  Like Persian monarchs hardly known  Ere tumbled headlong from the throne  Precarious and as short its sway  Depos'd and sceptred in a day  Pleasure begins its fickle reign  And tyrannizes into pain  When as to cruel pain we bow  Its rod grows light we know not how  Ah cruel blow to human pride  Is pain and pleasure thus allied  That all the sweets of life grow sour  Within the transitory hour  Complains Lorenzo darts behind  No ray of comfort on his mind  If thus with varied joy and strife  Diversified allstates of life  If human being cannot know  A constant state of bliss and woe  Worn by sharp mis'ry to the bones  While grief with intermission groans  And meagre want half fed the while  Grins forth her grateful ghastly smile  Tho vain our hopes of bliss as vain  Our fears of unremitting pain  Absurd the mischiefmaking care  That leads us blindly to despair  SIMKIN A FAIRY TALE  WRITTEN AT SCHOOL  crinem Irroravit aquisEt neque jam color est misto candore rubori  Ovid  IN days of yore when elves were seen  By moonlight dancing on the green  Leading in mystic steps their train  O'er marshy mead or flow'ry plain  A maiden with her milking pail  Trip'd morn and eve across the vale  Patty the sweetest temper'd lass  That e'er beat dewdrop from the grass  But nature half unkind had shed  Illnatur'd influence on her head  For oh the cause of many a care  Deeptinted red the virgin's hair  For sister nymphs she liv'd a jest  And ne'er was kiss'd among the rest  Now so it chanc'd that by the mead  Where Patty's cows were us'd to feed  There stood a mount on verdant ground  With daisies strew'd and violets crown'd  Round which had many a tim'rous swain  Seen fairies sporting on the plain  For under as the story's told  They dwelt in palaces of gold  Safe in the bosom of the hill  Where they convey'd themselves at will  Or when they pleas'd from thence could rise  Invisible to mortal eyes  By these the nymph was often seen  With clearstarch'd coif so neat and clean  Devoid of all that negligence  That give the fairies just offence  Who trace the house with critic eye  Nor pass an unwash'd trencher by  But pinch severe the careless maid  For room unswept or spoon mislaid  They view in pity Patty's hair  And take the virgin to their care  Now as at dusky eve the maid  Sat milking Mully in the shade  Simkin a sprite of neither sex  That us'd old peevish maids to vex  In flowing azure loosely drest  A thin transparent gauze its vest  Like that which now to us convey'd  The modern females term a shade  Astride a vapour dancing came  A Will o'th' Wisp its mortal name  The same which boys so often ken  From distant lake or foggy fen  A cloud of light that leads astray  Trav'llers benighted on their way  Thus over hill and dale the maid  The welldesigning Simkin led  'Till twelve a clock a solemn sound  Rung from a neighbouring village round  What time the nimble fairies tread  The maiden daisies of the mead  Which scarcely bend beneath their weight  So lightly trip their nimble feet  How blest the plain thrice fertile soil  On which the fairies deign to smile  No barren spot can here be found  No weed nor thistle curse the ground  Nor here is heard the screechowl's note  Nor omen from the raven's throat  But thrush and blackbird sweetly sing  And the glad cuckoo hails the spring  Here too the scented sweetbriar grows  The woodbine wild and wild the rose  The kingcup smiles with brighter bloom  Aud violets breathe more sweet perfume  To such a spot enchanted mead  The sprightly elve doth Patty lead  Now from his bounding steed alights  And mixes 'mong his fellow sprights  His bounding steed no more his care  Directly vanish'd into air  Now gentle Patty in surprize  Around her turns her wand'ring eyes  Here some she saw with mighty care  New moulding fancies for the fair  Here rose a head and there was seen  Improvements on a capuchin  For all the milliner imparts  Is the result of fairy arts  Here stood a crowd in warm dispute  About to form a birthday suit  And there in consultation sat  As many modelling a hat  Fast by inspir'd by female love  The spreading petticoat t' improve  They met and in debate were high  Or is or is it nota fly  Others to greater deeds inclin'd  Were drawing morals for the mind  And lo to this important end  The fairy histories are penn'd  The sprites to all invention new  Their slender fingers dip in dew  And fill with deeds unknown before  Their tomes the leaves of sycamore  Hence are the lov'd of fairies taught  And blest with ev'ry brilliant thought  Who here peruse at early dawn  Th' impressions on the dewy lawn  Ere yet an inauspicious wind  Leaves not a single tome behind  Or the refulgent sun exhales  On one bright beam a thousand tales  From hence each intellectual vapour  They scrawl on mortal ink and paper  So wretches vulgar things their care  For mushrooms at the morn repair  Ere yet th' expanding warmth of day  Dries their contracted sweets away  A number more at different toil  Patty with terror view'd awhile  When now a train approach'd the maid  With sprightly Simkin at their head  Who smiling tript before the rest  And thus the trembling fair addrest  Fear not sweetest maid but see  What the gift we bring to thee  This the queen of fairies sent  In a phial nicely pent  Drops by mooney'd elves distill'd  From the wild buds of the field  Mix'd with liquids nicely caught  Which in acorn cups are brought  Fill'd before the peep of morn  From the prickly point of thorn  Or the furzbush in the dell  Or the yellow cowslip bell  Suck'd from thence with slender pipe  Or the hip at christmas ripe  Join'd with these a chemic rare  Earth extract from purest air  Nymph with this bedew thine head  No more shall glow thy locks with red  Of lovely brown shall be thy hair  And thou the brightest of the sair  This said the ken of rising day  Summon'd each spright in haste away  Now Patty to the phial flies  And strait the remedy applies  She sighs neglected now no more  The swains admire that jeer'd before  The nymphs from former pity turn  And now with hate and envy burn  ON THE WEAKNESS OF THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING AND THE INCOMPRE∣HENSIBILITY OF THE DEITY  AN EPISTLE TO LORENZO  ARE there Lorenzo who suppose  That man can nature's God disclose  Their moral and religious schemes  Building on theologic dreams  Expect not thou a point to hit  Beyond the sight of human wit  Nor ever think to judge of ought  Above the reach of sober thought  Rul'd by no giant hopes or fears  Whose stature grows with length of years  In search of truth be sure to find  The labour suited to the mind  With genius nature bearing part  The strict yet gentle nurse of art  For say the voice of reason true  Be ours a just abstracted view  Be it the privilege of man  To trace exactly nature's plan  The scale of beings in his hands  To know the point at which he stands  Compar'd with all he boasts to know  As well above him as below  Yet if of human logick vain  He link to heaven a kindred chain  Conclusions idle soon he draws  And heav'n prescribes by human laws  Imagine thou in what degree  A seraph stands 'tween God and thee  The neck how lowly dost thou bend  Before thy bright seraphic friend  But place thyself a mite unseen  And Being infinite between  In this comparison says pride  A seraph thou to God allied  Thy pride Lorenzo disbelieve  Let Locke nor Addison deceive  For tho creation's varied plan  Assigns degrees respecting man  Yet bigot know and learn to fear  God is beyond thy proper sphere  Created beings all his care  Doth he with them creation share  Ah no the system all his own  God the creator stands alone  At equal distance all his plan  The mite the seraph and the man  If 'tis not so the passive clay  Of yon corinthian column gay  That gilt entablature and base  Or marble of yon shining vase  Resemble more the artist's mind  Than if to meaner use consign'd  Absurd is Jones's genius known  By the great model or the stone  The pile erect to Trajan's name  Affected not by empty fame  The cross rever'd the honour'd bust  And trodden floor are kindred dust  For all in one degree respect  Their sov'reign lord the architect  How justly then soe'er we plead  That reason Nature's book doth read  As by her known establish'd laws  Of each effect we trace the cause  Those laws themselves can ne'er consine  The legislative power divine  Whose will those very laws decreed  And bad th' effect the cause succeed  Agent in some superior scheme  Of which in this we can but dream  Beyond the science of mankind  In nature's fane our God enshrin'd  Content Lorenzo let us trace  The lines and shadow of his face  In humble boldness seek to know  No more than heaven permits below  To face the sun to beat the sky  Demand an eagle's wing and eye  Ah let not then mere birds of night  Whose wings whose opticks check their flight  Encourag'd by the morning ray  To risk the sunshine of the day  Their feeble powers too highly rate  And rush absurdly on their fate  As in the noontide beams they gaze  Struck blind by heav'ns meridian blaze  For ever after to their cost  To grope in endless error lost  Bear Atticus the critick's rod  In vain we then define a God  In vain we attributes bestow  Or reason here from what we know  Tho science teach religion warm  What wild ideas still we form  Imperfect embrios of the brain  That strive to scale the heav ns in vain  Too short to reach beyond the sky  The focus of the mental eye  Too cold our most transporting zeal  To paint what heav'ns and light conceal  Yet will the skeptick ask me why  Go rise and to the dogstar fly  Thou canst not nor the cause unknown  Central attraction holds thee down  A pow'r occult which ere thy birth  Fast bound thee to thy native earth  From which thou ne'er canst hope to rise  To lunar plains or solar skies  Nor less within its sphere confin'd  The subtile essence of the mind  What tho' it boasts the pow'r to rove  In freedom through the plains above  Tho' wing'd its active feet to run  With Merc'ry round the central sun  Giv'n it far distant worlds t' explore  And seas of space without a shore  Yet still within creation's round  Within our narrow system bound  Of what's above or what without  We harbour universal doubt  Say light prevails no contrast shade  Outlines the void we would prevade  Say darkness reigns no chearing ray  Delineates blind inquiry's way  Destin'd thy erring way to trace  Thro' nature's wide and gloomy space  Hence mortal man must ever be  Thy author God unknown to thee  Let Ignorance then her idol dress  In justice love and happiness  Adorn with mercy's golden chain  With all the virtues grace its train  And then adore in humble plight  Calling those fopperies infinite  The pagan thus despis'd as blind  Creates his idol to his mind  Thinking his deity express'd  By bird or beast he likes the best  Then bows before the painted shrine  And calls his wooden god divine  Cast the presumptuous thought aside  'Tis not humility but pride  Unless that truly humble we  T' adore the god Humanity  And such it is for whence arise  Our virtues but from moral ties  Whose known relations thus define  That essence mortals call divine  Lorenzo ready for reply  Lay not thy prompt objection by  Thou sayst "thy friend himself deceives  "Nor God adores nor God believes  "For tho the mind the pow'r descry  "If left its essence in the sky  "If none imagin'd or display'd  "To nothing adoration's paid  "In me no certain faith is found  "My deity an empty sound"  Not so for granting I confess  Thy attributes a God express  Thou sayst thyself "still undefin'd  "The perfect by th' imperfect mind"  And to thy attributes must join  Thy Infinite or thy Divine  As jugglers who t' enhance deceit  To sacred science give their cheat  While with the curtain still they hide  The slight of hand too closely ey'd  So sly theologists impart  The hocus pocus of their art  Holding religion's sacred veil  Where slights of understanding fail  For know alas their wisest plan  Displays but a superiour man  Whom Infinite the conjurer's rod  Presto converts into a god  Till then they solve our problem right  And tell us what is infinite  They still must be reduc'd to own  Their compound deity unknown  To all or reasoning or inspir'd  This infinite a term requir'd  Differs Lorenzo then with me  In terms alone we disagree  Perfection infinite is thine  Indefinite perfection mine  Condemn not then half understood  I not deny that perfect good  Allgracious merciful and wise  God reigns supreme beyond the skies  Neither 'tis true my terms imply  But granting none I none deny  Requiring but to acquiesce  That thou thy Infinite express  Idly doth Bolingbroke refine  Granting that wisdom is divine  While as absurdly he denies  Justice and goodness to the skies  Ideas equally our own  Our goodness as our wisdom's known  To both as hard to reconcile  Or nature's frown or nature's smile  Alas no attributes of thine  Can e'er the Deity define  Impossible to judge or know  Of God above from man below  Reserv'd the prospect of the skies  To gratify immortal eyes  Lorenzo let us reason right  No finite spans an infinite  Unless with Matho vers'd in arts  We hold th' infinity of parts  But none th' absurdity will plan  That God can be contain'd in man  Tho as absurdly they suppose  Our partial gifts the God disclose  Join'st thou with Florio the dispute  T' enhance each moral attribute  Pretending "these however crude  "Divine perfection doth include  "As species in a genus they  "Or parts which join'd the whole display"  So with the grandeur all t' inspire  Of the gay mansion of his sire  An idiot heir his mother's fool  Taught his synecdochè at school  Conceiv'd by part the whole was shown  And took a sample of the stone  Convinc'd doth Polydore with me  That God's indefinite agree  Yet argue "that our partial view  "May still be relatively true  "For if no abstract light we gain  "'Tis just our best to entertain  "Our God to call that wond'rous cause  "In nature trac'd by nature's laws"  Mistake not here nor God dethrone  The first mechanic cause be known  'Tis of some prior cause th' effect  Which no known similars respect  The God which then we so define  Nor selfexistent nor divine  Be known creation's various ties  Whence physical relations rise  Of each effect the various cause  Attraction and repulsion's laws  That primum mobilè be found  That drove Des Cartes' whirlpools round  Let matter motion aether join  To form thy attributes divine  Striving if possible to rise  To the first agent in the skies  Be next explain'd to moral sense  The wond'rous scheme of providence  Down from those great important springs  On which rebounds the fate of kings  To those so exquisitely small  Destin'd to let the sparrow fall  Say'st thou the knowledge hence deriv'd  Of him those systems hath contriv'd  Alas from hence we only trace  The features of creation's face  The front it bears to human kind  But not its selfexisting mind  Should we presuming to display  The spirit of the golden day  Thus call its essence its result  Attraction fire alike occult  Or say 'tis vegetation green  Who'd think it is the sun we mean  So here t' absurdity we fall  Nor thus define a God at all  Yet while to thee I freely own  I reverence a God unknown  Think not thro ignorance or pride  A God was ever yet denied  No atheist e'er was known on earth  Till fiery zealots gave him birth  For controversy's sake their trade  And damn'd the heretick they made  Doth Clody impudent and vain  Deny a God in skeptic strain  And yet in ignorance advance  That nature is the work of chance  Theologists absurdly wise  With their anathemas despise  For well may Clody these inflame  Whose God exists but in a name  A technic term devis'd at school  I pity Clody as a fool  To Epicurus' strains belong  The censures of an idle song  For say "united words might join  "By accident and not design  "Atoms might luckily contrive  "And strangely find themselves alive  "Or by some other scheme as wild  "The world be fortune's fav'rite child"  Explain the terms say what is meant  By atoms fortune accident  What meanst thou but th' efficient cause  Of nature's works and nature's laws  O think not then th' eternal mind  To term or epithet confin'd  But take away or change the name  And Clody's God and mine's the same  Say'st thou "in chance a pow'r defin'd  "Fortuitous absurd and blind  "Unworthy that stupendous plan  "Which nature's scenes display to man  "When grace with harmony allied  "And wisdom strike on ev'ry side"  Alas to Clody these unknown  For wond'rous wisdom's all his own  In nature nothing he surveys  That actuates his soul to praise  In vain the planets run their course  Obedient to impulsive force  Th' excentric comets far and wide  Pursue the same unerring guide  In vain describes their varied race  In equal times an equal space  In vain thro microscopic eyes  Innumerable wonders rise  On the green leaf whole nations crawl  And myriads perish in its fall  Ah me what bears the barren mind  What beauty can affect the blind  Should Clody then his chance disclaim  And own a Deity by name  The blund'ring deist would advance  A God no wiser than his chance  Boasts nature therefore no design  Say whence Lorenzo yours and mine  Did wisdom's sons themselves create  Their birth 'tis own'd they owe to fate  To fate capricious blind and dull  Design lock'd up in th' atheist's skull  But say my friend how came it there  Lit chance upon occasion fair  From odds and ends of matter join'd  To form an intellecual mind  Egregious blunder gross surmize  "Nature's a fool yet man is wise"  Is there a mortal found of brain  Who such a tenet can maintain  O noFor words let fools contest  Atheism's a mere tho impious jest  How obvious is the truth and yet  What learned volumes have been writ  How scholiasts labour to refute  What none do actually dispute  Of the firstcause or fools or wise  The pure existence none denies  But in its essence  Essential Attributes  disagree  For who defines infinity  Blush not Lorenzo then to own  Th' eternal God a God unknown  Whose face to mortal eye denied  Can never gratify thy pride  To him your votive altars raise  As Athens did in ancient days  Nor dare pollute his sacred shrine  With human sacrifice divine  But humble adoration bring  And silent praise fit offering  So the Peruvian pure in heart  Strange to the guile or guilt of art  Unaw'd by tenet text or tale  Erects his temple in the vale  Sacred to th' universal mind  The God and guide of human kind  No firstlings here affront the skies  No clouds of smoking incense rise  No hypocrite with crabbed face  No convert tortur'd into grace  No solid skull in wisdom's cowl  No hooded hawk nor solemn owl  Nor blind nor ominous invade  This spotless consecrated shade  But as the native of the spray  Man hails his maker with the day  By nature taught heaven asks no more  In spirit and in truth t' adore  PROLOGUE TO THE WIDOW'D WIFE  A COMEDY  ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  TO gain the public ear the man of rhimes  Should always speak the language of the times  And little else hath been of late in hearing  Than terms and phrases of Electioneering  Our author therefore sends me to assure ye  Worthy and free electors of Old Drury  How happy he should prove if it content you  That he be one of those who represent you  The state Poetic laws and legislature  Like the Political in form and nature  Phoebus the Nine and bards of reputation  King peerage commons of the scribbling nation  Now from Parnassus' throne the prince of wit  It seems hath issued out his royal writ  For a new

seated  His service lost presuming you may need him  The present candidate would fain succeed him  Not that he vainly boasts on this occasion  He met encouragement from your persuasion  Or that both

HAVE BEEN SPOKEN AT THE THEATREROYAL ON RICHMONDGREEN MDCCLXVII  BY opposition lately sore affrighted  We own with gratitude we see delighted  Our rivals disappointed of their ends  To alienate the favour of our friends  What could their musing prologuemonger dream on  By his strange tale of Baucis and Philemon  Alluding to the prologue spoken at the theatre on the hill said to be written by G C  Esq    Of heathen Jove and suchlike idle stuff  True to be sure and probable enough  But were it real 'tis a fine example  And of his taste no doubt a curious sample  Because Dan Ovid's Jove a filthy rake  Once pleas'd his lodgings in a barn to take  You in the dirt as decently should grovel  And take your places truly in a hovel  Well must they know who much frequented plays  Enacted up the hill in former days  How oft the scene dragg'd on nay stood stock still  For want of somethingworse than want of skill  How ludicrous to see altho in sport  The fields of Cressy and of Agincourt  Scarce big enough t' admit a warriour's stride  Your heroes always straddle four feet wide  Where trumpets sound swords clash and pikestaves rattle  The shimsham hurlyburly of a battle  Where bloodless victory sets whole armies shouting  A man should sure have room to stir about in  How else can nimble Harlequin display  His merry magic in the mimic fray  Flourish his wooden sword or driven hard  Escape pursuit by jumpinghalf a yard  Yet have we seen that motley child of fun  Coop'd in a hutch where he could skip nor run  But fidgetted his wrigglings to confine  From tripping up the tripping Columbine  The stage so spacious that three steps at most  Ran Agamemnon's nose against the post  While his fair consort madam Clytemnestra  Hid with her petticoat the whole orchestra  Nor was the playhouse faultier than the play'rs  As that had its defects so they had theirs  Oft 'tis well known the careless comic muse  Forgot to laugh because forgot their cues  Nay we have seen a whole performance undone  For want of chieftians not arriv'd from London  Base knights that fail'd distressed queens to meet  But tippling sat in Bow or Russelstreet  Mean while poor Tragedy was forc'd to cry  And whimper sadly with a single eye  The other turn'd incessantly to look  Tearless and dry intent upon the book  The actor's part by some pert 'prentice play'd  Too fond of buskins not to scorn his trade  No wonder stage so small play'rs so obedient  Should render a new theatre expedient  Where heroes might have room to strut and stare  And bullies to lug out look big and swear  Where Sir John Falstaff at his ease might swagger  Jaffier have elbow room to lift his dagger  Pistol to stalk and Toby Belch to stagger  On these accounts and due consideration  We fix'd our thoughts on this our present station  Here rais'd our house and having tightly built it  Just as you see thus painted carv'd and gilt it  This for our theatreAs for the rest  As actors we at worst will do our best

relative to man  Wouldst thou Lorenzo comprehend  Man's physical and moral end  To future to immortal views  Conducted by the faithful muse  Secure while yet in reason's sight  For thee she takes her daring flight  Borne up on scientific wing  Attempts her boldest note to sing  For thee those winding tracts t' explore  Where seldom muse hath dar'd to soar  Is there who teach that human woe  Must from a source abstracted flow  Existing in creation's plan  Some active ill the curse of man  Some imperfection or offence  In physicks or in providence  The question old unanswer'd lies  "Whence did the curse of evil rise"  By Wolfius left and twenty more  As puzzling as it stood before  To God or devil still assign'd  The cause of ill by humankind  In disobedience to his God  Did man himself call down the rod  Or did th' archfiend from heaven that fell  Inspire the mischief to rebel  Yet sure if pow'r preventive given  No angel e'er had fell from heaven  Man had no tempter known to vice  Serpent nor Eve in Paradise  Lorenzo in the pride of sense  Instruction's deem'd impertinence  She therefore daughter of the wise  Hath long been shelter'd in disguise  Ent'ring beneath the mask of sport  The presence tho forbid the court  So fond with young delight to stray  And moralize the wanton's play  That ev'n her precepts still prevail  In every favorite gossip's tale  Yet so that those who seek to learn  With ease the naked truth discern  To genius but a pleasing task  To sport with allegory's mask  The moral then from tales deduct  And let philosophy instruct  Angelic truths let

blunders there confusion here  Of heav'n too distant hell too near  In mood so splenetic my friend  Say what those evils that offend  Thy doubts propose thy questions ask  And take omnisciency to task  Takes thy sagacity offence  At all thou seest of providence  Dost thou the constitution blame  Of nature's universal frame  Dost thou heaven's boasted care deny  When tempests sweep along the sky  Thy feather'd geese when whirlwinds bear  Aloft and scatter wide in air  Or from the hills impetuous rains  Descend and strip th' autumnal plains  Concluding the machinery vile  When earthquakes shake our stable isle  When Etna and Vesuvius flame  To nature each a burning shame  Finds thy philosophy as soon  Faulty th' attraction of the moon  When death resistless roaring rides  In triumph o'er the swelling tides  Or bathing in destruction drowns  Flocks herds and men and helpless towns  Or bears them off some mountain steep  All headlong down to glut the deep  Or is thy wiser censure bent  Against some comet's dire event  In time to come time out of mind  To fall into the sun design'd  Suspicious that if planets turn  To comets ours at length may burn  And we be doom'd some sultry day  To fierce devouring f  ames a prey  Lorenzo is this strain admir'd  Here mayst thou rail till sense be tir'd  But judge not thou like sophists vain  Of gen'ral good by partial gain  Thinking when cross'd our stubborn will  Such is a providential ill  For know no abstract cause exists  And battles in creation's lists  A formal enemy to man  Since nature's tournaments began  Inflam'd with enmity and power  God's human likeness to devour  No'tis impossible a cause  Should counteract creation's laws  The hand of providence arrest  Or heaven's determin'd pow'r contest  As one or other must

glebe untrod by humankind  Fierce light'nings flash and thunders roll  Their horrours only round the pole  Let Malstrooms roar and Heclas blaze  Where fools nor cowards stand to gaze  Let islands drown let mountains melt  These were no evils if unfelt  'Mid southern seas and lands unknown  Should agonizing nature groan  There only ease her future throes  And harmless terrours round disclose  Earthquakes would lose their evil name  And heaven no longer bear the blame  Tho evils row we loudly call  Lima's and Ulysippo's  Lisbon so called from its supposed founder Ulysses  fall  Lorenzo of creation's plan  But parts are visible to man  Whence ign'rant of their various use  We think them subject to abuse  Tho all with art consummate join  Conducive to heaven's main design  As parts to complex engines prove  Inspir'd by mechanism to move  This retrogade and that direct  In diff'rent modes to one effect  So howsoe'er they clash to sense  The sev'ral springs of providence  In concert at their maker's will  Their ends harmoniously fulfil  Upheld the weight let fall the rod  As urges the first mover God  How blind are then the smatt'rihg fools  Just taught their geometric rules  The simple use of rule and line  To these who nature would confine  Its laws who else capricious call  Or say "it acts by none at all'  "The macrocosm's vast engine made  "By one that knew not half his trade  "Its bungling engineer at hand  "To help it forward at a stand"  Impious like Marli's doth it take  The pains to mend it did to make  Requiring endless cost and care  To hold in tenable repair  Ah no howe'er to us it seem  Creation is a perfect scheme  Lorenzo let not words deceive  All imperfection's relative  Since from conceiv'd amendments came  The patchwork we perfection name  A term for something understood  Productive still of mortals' good  But of perfection absolute  All nature is beyond dispute  For all from God is here deriv'd  And all is perfect God contriv'd  "Man's surely perfect then" you cry  As man most perfect I reply  The creature of his Maker's will  Form'd his good pleasure to fulfil  Destin'd in th' universal plan  To fill his place and act as man  What tho on earth the human mind  Involv'd in ignorance we find  Impassion'd fickle giv'n to pride  Nor resting e'er selfsatisfied  Doth pow'r comparative t' improve  Perfection positive remove  As well imperfect might we say  The rising sun at early day  Since with superiour heat and light  It blazes in meridian height  Form'd with progressive pow'rs to rise  From out the dust to tread the skies  Perfect as such humanity  However lowly in degree  How ignorant and weak are those  Who nature's author then suppose  In providence remains a spy  To guard his work with watchful eye  From fallen angels' base intent  The direful outrage to prevent  To rescue or preserve his plan  From that prodigious creature man  Like the young steed that scours the plain  Is nature wild and needs a rein  Or halts she like a founder'd jade  Lame by her frequent stumbling made  Perhaps Lorenzo some mistake  Concerning provideace we make  The pow'rs of nature to divide  From its imaginary guide  For if creation has in fact  Been long ago a finish'd act  What end doth lab'ring time pursue  Or what hath providence in view  For sure thou wilt not take the side  Of those whose ignorance and pride  Maintain the universe design'd  Merely to gratify mankind  A stage as on a stroller's cart  Where drolls itin'rant play their part  In grinning mirth or brawling strife  The tragicomedy of life  Was then heav'n's wond'rous pow'r display'd  This system in perfection made  Only to wear itself away  Stupendous frame for mere decay  Its worlds to wander thro the void  Destroying till themselves destroy'd  Or in some future fabled days  To take imaginary blaze  At flames that all to ruin turn  Annihilating as they burn  Risk'd then the censure of my wit  I hold the world unfinish'd yet  Time building what heaven's wisdom plann'd  Creation's work ev'n yet in hand  Thro nature's scenes in order range  See all things in continual change  All to some point progressive run  To do or else to be undone  Existing for so short a space  Thousands we know but by their place  Which chang'd by changing form we say  The things themselves are pass'd away  No proofs of Being objects bring  Whose essence ever on the wing  Flown from their forms ere yet defin'd  Leaves no identity behind  But waving this yet find we here  No abstract cause of ill to fear  Since on the feelings of mankind  Depends the ev'ry ill we find  Whence tho our suff'rings ill we call  They've no abstracted cause at all  For stript creation of mankind  No evil would be left behind  To this will cavillers reply  "We ask not where those causes lie  "If in externals be th' oiffence  "Or in the pravity of sense  "That real ill exists is plain  "While man is sensible of pain"  In answer my Lorenzo here  No vaunting stoicism fear  Nor think thy friend so madly wise  T' affeft his mis'ries to despise  I ne'er presume that point to reach  Nor 'gainst the voice of nature preach  None feel more tenderly than I  Mine the soft heart and wat'ry eye  The sanguine hopes the groundless fears  Still unsubdu'd by sense or years  Ah too susceptible of pain  When vice or folly bat complain  Yet ev'n while tears of anguish flow  I hold no abstract ill we know  'Tis true my friend no man alive  Could in his senses gravely strive  The wretch in torture to persuade  Of evil not to be afraid  The murd'rer mangled on the wheel  To smile at harmless rope and steel  Or that the blows that loitering kill  Cannot be physically ill  Asurd the argument and vain  Since all we know of ill is pain  And yet as neither griev'd nor pain'd  Of evil man had ne'er complain'd  If relative our bliss and woe  Reciprocally ebb and flow  'Tis palpable that joy and strife  Are but the modes of human life  Which varied with consummate skill  May on the whole be good nor ill  Sayst thou the learned are agreed  The ills of life the good exceed  Lorenzo peevish sick or vain  How nat'ral is it to complain  But fure experience here denies  This threadbare maxim of the wise  Behold the weak the blind the lame  The sons of poverty and shame  The wretch expiring by degrees  By amputations or disease  Such whose vile lot the world their foe  Contempt and beggary below  Shouldst thou to this or that propose  In death a cure for all their woes  Tell 'em oppress'd with human strife  "Wide stand the num'rous doors'of life  "With open arms the wretch to save  "Rest welcomes mis'ry to the grave"  How few your recipe will try  Tho dying piecemeal loth to die  Nor merely from the fear of worse  Tenacious of a present curse  For say annihilation here  The all poor mortals have to fear  How few would yet their ills incline  Their sense of being to resign  To part on terms like these from pain  With pleasure ne'er to meet again  Ev'n nature shudders at the thought  To sink inconscious into naught  In mere existence sure mankind  Must then intrinsic pleasure find  Some good equivalent must feel  To such suppos'd excess of ill  Since thus in death so loth to part  The aching head and bleeding heart  May not indeed all human woe  Be ballanc'd by our joys below  Dost them Lorenzo doubt of this  How dost thou measure earthly bliss  'Tis not by extasy alone  Thy actual share of joy is known  Duration adds to the degree  As much as its intensity  Joy for a moment's space how small  Pain instantaneous none at all  Thro life continued little less  Ev'n bare content than happiness  The joyous extasy of bliss  Dilating rarified to this  Be it on individuals tried  Each needs but to be satisfied  The longing wish the sigh is o'er  When once content we ask no more  Thus equal joy we often taste  In shortliv'd pleasures snatch'd in haste  As others or when raptur'd less  For years ev'n we ourselves possess  Hence oft asserted in dispute  That time ideas constitute  Sense of duration so confin'd  To that which passes in the mind  Th' expectant lover thinks in rage  His Stella's absent hour an age  While short and sweet the moments fly  When love and she sit smiling by  Nor giv'n their epithets in vain  To fleeting joy and lingering pain  In minutes flown each joyful day  Each sad one whil'd in hours away  Nay tho of life tenacious all  Longevity no bliss we call  In diff'rent animals at least  The less the greater's constant feast  'Tis probable their joys and strife  Are suited to their term of life  Whence equal pleasure equal pain  May longliv'd elephants sustain  With young ephemerons whose flight  At noon beginning ends at night  During which momentary space  They rise love battle and embrace  Flutt'ring around till out of breath  They drop into the arms of death  From felfexperience dost thou rate  The real hardship of thy fate  Art thou with ev'ry friend at strife  Seest thou no gentle joy in life  Dost thou no fav'rite scheme possess  That yields contemplative success  Hast thou no hope no good dost choose  A good thou wouldst not die to lose  Thy day thus clouded at the dawn  Will brighter shine its clouds withdrawn  Or is thy morn of sunshine past  With clouds thy ev'ning's overcast  Wouldst of its brightness know th' amount  Bring morn and ev'ning to account  Stands nature then so long abus'd  Of abstract evil thus excus'd  As little truth is understood  By those who hold all nature good  "Whatever is is right"It may  But therefore good we cannot say  Unless some general bliss we see  Arise from partial misery  In spite of truth in reason's spite  When vex'd or pain'd we all deny't  Ne'er till the pain be o'er confessing  That was which never is a blessing  The term's then here misunderstood  Right's not equivocal to good  Goodness adapted and confin'd  To th' appetites of humankind  The right unknown to you or me  Tho sure what is is fit to be  Let Plato then or Leibnitz prate  Of goodnsess influencing fate  Or idle sophists still contest  Their boasted principle the best  By disputants or either side  The partial term is misapplied  That God is good they know full well  But what his goodness none can tell  Unless to man his kindness shown  His good's dependent on our own  Lorenzo merely to mankind  Thus evil physical confin'd  Of moral next a puzzling task  An explanation dost thou ask  Sayst thou "Heaven's care no more extends  "To physical than moral ends  "The same the providential power  "That rains the soft refreshing shower  "That in the womb of teeming earth  "Its atoms quickens into birth  "Doth in the moral scene connect  "The cause and consequent effect  "On virtue peace of heart bestows  "Softens the good man's casual woes  "Abandons vice to fell despair  "Or plagues with heartcorroding care"  Concluding hence "that moral ill  "Opposing nature's righteous will  "Aloud for heaven's dread vengeance calls  "The curse that on the guilty falls"  So far Lorenzo I with thee  In part most readily agree  That vice will leave a sting behind  And virtue its reward shall find  Yet all with good St Paul confess  "Without a law we can't transgress"  Now nature's law is heaven's command  Whose will no mortal can withstand  How lives earth's animated clod  To contravene the will of God  As well advent'rous of his neck  The laws of gravity to break  Presumptuous man might seek to fly  A creeping earthworm to the sky  Or don the bishop's winged shoon  To trip it yarely to the moon  What curse soe'er then vice provoke  Creation's laws can ne'er be broke  But know by physical alone  Is moral good or evil known  For had not vice the pow'r to vex  Its evil never would perplex  Each moral thus a partial ill  Permitted by th' eternal will  To mortals relative th' offence  And punishments of providence  Lorenzo state the matter clear  Be pain and pleasure strangers here  Strangers to pleasures and to pain  What motives had we to complain  Suppose we then in nature's plan  T' exist th' antomaton of man  Rising from senseless matter's arms  Which perfect rest nor grieves nor charms  Should heaven a consciousness bestow  Subject to good or ill below  Not real pain or pleasure give  But only make the form to live  As yet from all reflection clear  Unnerv'd by hope unaw'd by fear  Suppose to action thus consign'd  This naked unaffected mind  Lorenzo with precision hence  Let us infer the consequence  Ere yet existed moral ill  The first sole agent was the will  Reason without the pow'r to act  To censure or advise a fact  As from experience nought it knew  Of good or bad or false or true  For reason its conclusion draws  From similar effect and cause  No instinct faculty or sense  Securing actual innocence  That bids us virtue's steps pursue  Or points to bliss it never knew  Else giving reason bounteous heaven  Had also actual pleasure given  This not suppos'd hence reason's use  Some known effect must introduce  Now as innate if we maintain  A love of bliss and hate of pain  Directed as the passions fir'd  The will to pleasure first aspir'd  The moral agent bound to chuse  From nature's most immediate views  But prone to censure and complain  Suppose our first sensation pain  Let pain or pleasure be attain'd  Of both an equal sense was gain'd  As the first tree of knowledge bore  Of good and evil equal store  For when the mind one pleasure knew  Its neutral state of rest withdrew  Pleasure and pain by contrast known  Criteria of each other grown  Hence felt th' initiated mind  The sting which pleasure left behind  And reason did to act commence  On th' information of the sense  Still as the passions ebb and flow  Now swoln with bliss now sunk in woe  Tracing the bounds th' extremes between  Of innocence that golden mean  But ah the fluctuating tide  Of passion doth this mean deride  Consistent only 'tis confess'd  With nature in a state of rest  Here then from moral actions came  The necessary ill we blame  Running selflove in full career  Reason her guide not always near  Her satisfaction oft pursuing  Tho at her own and others' ruin  Th' indulgence of the human will  We hence presume is moral ill  Whene'er from such indulgence flows  More pain than pleasure it bestows  In guilt original involv'd  Here see the wond'rous myst'ry solv'd  To the first man no more confin'd  Than passions found in ev'ry mind  Is the plain cause of moral woe  Sin human frailty here below  Lorenzo evil understood  The die's reverse is moral good  Whate'er more pleasure yields than pain  Not indeed solely to the agent but to mankind or the moral world in general  The name of goodness doth obtain  Unsatisfied Lorenzo yet  Dost thou lost happiness regret  Doth from our plan of morals seem  Still providence no perfect scheme  Because perplex'd with fear or pain  Ev'n virtue covets bliss in vain  Dost thou against the cause object  "'Tis disproportion'd to th' effect  "Thus in th' intemp'rance of the will  "To place the source of moral ill  "Our passions but a nat'ral cause  "Obedient to creation's laws  "Here palpably too innocent  "The cause of mis'ry to be meant"  Must I repeat it o'er again  From pleasure flows our sense of pain  Dependent these as light and shade  Thro life each other's contrast made  Whence tho to moderation join'd  Content's serenity of mind  While vice but sports with higher glee  To sink as low in misery  Proportion'd to the guilty joy  The pangs intemperance annoy  Yet on the whole no abstract ill  Doth here confront th' eternal will  Of evil all th' effected strife  But relative to human life  Sayst thou indeed "if man confin'd  "To fill the place by heaven assign'd  "But partially to rise or fall  "Why feels he misery at all"  Another question answers this  What title have mankind to bliss  During thy life if man and boy  Thy share of both thou mayst enjoy  If perfect rest the certain mean  Our pleasures and our pains between  Null the momentum of our pain  Who shall of providence complain  Seest thou incumbering the ground  The barren figtrees branching round  While virtue stands the brunt of vice  And knaves possess fools' paradise  'Tis here indeed our errour lies  Our virtues we too highly prize  And adequate rewards to find  Create them fondly to our mind  Not satisfied on heaven to trust  Or think its dispensations just  Unless his conduct God submit  To our investigating wit  Here toiling as an humble drudge  For man his critick lord and judge  What merit in thy maker's eye  That thou vain man art six feet high  To heaven must all with shame agree  Unprofitable servants we  Unworthy of celestial dress  The rags of human righteousness  The all that virtue has to boast  Claiming the world's regard at most  As virtue here so vice depends  Ourselves our guilt the most offends  For know proud man no act of thine  Renders defective God's design  No pow'r to human frailty given  To injure unpreventing heaven  Presume not at so high a price  To rate th' iniquity of vice  Nor let the vainlyvirtuous fool  Projecting heaven by line and rule  Sore lash'd and wasting to the bone  The crimes of health and ease t' atone  Conceive by want of rest or meat  Th' eternal purpose to defeat  Presume not at so cheap a rate  To hold th' omnipotence of fate  Yet who shall say that guilt is free  Or promise vice impunity  Since 'tis so plain the sting of woe  To joy inordinate doth grow  While none from virtue's paths would stray  If pleasure did not lead the way  Can virtue also hence despair  Since virtue's providence's care  Compensing pleasure due to pain  Nor this nor that bestow'd in vain  Let fools when hard their present lot  Think distant heaven has earth forgot  In discontent aloud complain  "That all our trust in heaven is vain"  Pretending God the world protects  And yet its sev'ral parts neglects  Do thou Lorenzo better taught  Never indulge so wild a thought  Conceiving th' individual man  No charge on nature's gen'ral plan  What tho impossible that we  At once the whole and parts should see  To single objects here confin'd  Th' attention of the human mind  Yet shall we blasphemously join  Heaven's intellects with yours and mine  Know thou the world's great architect  Its smallest part shall not neglect  As needful in the stately pile  As golden roofs th' abutments vile  Nor in their kind more perfect they  The parian stones than potter's clay  How sadly blundering in the dark  Here St John miss'd his boasted mark  "When heaven's omnipotence t'enhance  He almost gave the world to chance  Supposing God too great to mind  The peccadillos of mankind  Too insignificant our claim  To Deity's immediate aim  Or rather from his reasons given  He thought the task too great for heaven  Too puzzling for th' eternal wit  To hold its state and thus submit  Wherefore like th' idiot at a loss  To count heaven takes us in the gross  Lorenzo probable the scheme  However strange the doctrine seem  Whate'er the next world give in this  That virtue hath its share of bliss  While all accounts 'tween vice and woe  Are settled and discharg'd below  No ballance to receive or pay  Left shuffling for a future day  Go make an estimate of life  Compare the sums of joy and strife  Each in its separate degree  Duration and intensity  Perhaps upon the whole you'll find  That nothing's due to human kind  Nor loss nor profit in the trade  Of transient pains and pleasures made  Meantime how difficult to guess  At real objects of distress  How difficult in fact to trace  Where real pleasure hath a place  See shuddering at September's frost  In clothes of fur duke Chilly lost  Lamenting with his belly full  The tinker's halfcloath'd starving trull  A jade that warmer than his grace  Laughs at his pity to his face  Accustom'd to the melting mood  So wishing ev'ry mortal good  Behold Tendrilla drown her eyes  At what the sufferers despise  How oft the scene revers'd again  Apparent bliss is actual pain  How oft we hear muchenvied state  Groan beneath bulky grandeur's weight  Of thousands broke their nightly rest  By that for which we call them blest  Nay as a God on earth ador'd  See the dread inquisition's lord  Rais'd in the pomp of priestly pride  How envied by his monarch's side  And yet how mis'rable a part  He acts if not extinct his heart  How little less at nature's cost  If ev'ry social feeling lost  Meanwhile the wretch for whom we sigh  In cruel tortures doom'd to die  To pain superiour fear or shame  Exulting smiles amidst the flame  Makes his proud judge with malice swell  And triumphs over death and hell  Proportion'd to the weight of care  Gives nature thus the pow'r to bear  But partial judges we 'tis plain  Of others' joy or others' pain  So vice and virtue could we trace  Neither is stamp'd upon the face  And who to read presumes the art  The secret of another's heart  Nay ev'n that art how little known  To open and peruse our own  Who then so much slave to sense  Shall here arraign heaven's providence  Thinking "the good the world may leave  "Ere virtue's portion they receive  "Triumphant that the wicked go  "Blest or unpunish'd here below  "As if our end a slight event  "Depending on mere accident"  Is this not atheism in the eye  Of those who atheism most decry  Who made the world with equal skill  Can surely guide it if he will  Who then appearances shall trust  To think that heaven's on earth unjust  When vice and virtue may relate  Solely to man's sublunar state  And here for ought we truly know  Be paid their dues of joy and woe  Yet think not thou I here deny  That virtuous souls ascend the sky  Or that the grov'ling sons of vice  Shall be excluded paradise  Prepar'd my friend the man in life  By varied means of joy and strife  Or by redemption's wond'rous grace  To view his maker face to face  In death compleated for the state  Design'd him by the will

pow'rs and taste  Such future scenes may sure be given  This call'd a hell and that a heaven  And justly vice and virtue here  Have that to hope and this to fear  Still do I hear the growl of care

of her beauty  Together for ever at work or at play  Were united by love or by duty  But Time by lewd Fashion seducing the maid  The mother the daughter discarded  'Till Custom concealing the breach that was made  The fauxpas grew at length less regarded  I was told at Springgardens and this place and t'other  Art and Nature were seen in alliance  The daughter I met with but as for the mother  Our artists had bid her defiance  On fresh information I posted to Kew  And look'd round the princesses gardens  That both had been there I saw proofs not a few  Tho some of them not worth three farthings  Returning to town on this side TurnhamGreen  Jogging on without thinking of either  I saw them tho both seem'd asham'd to be seen  So closely connected together  In a little thatch'd house

Droll was the figure she did make  With plumage bare and rusty  The peacock hearing her bewail  And mov'd tho proud to pity  Shook the loose feathers from his tail  And dress'd her somewhat pretty  This done she turn'd her rump about  And saw it made so fine  "Dn it" says she "the world will doubt  "These feathers being mine  "Tho stolen plumes I safely wear  "It mayn't be safe to borrow  "But

blind  The skeptic tribe of humankind  Who doubt Lorenzo if our lot  Be here to die and be forgot  Or if it prove our future fate  To know an intellectual state  In death to perish or to rise  Immortal to our native skies  Allur'd by wit to neither side  Be reason our impartial guide  Let us Lorenzo fairly weigh  What argument hath here to say  Hast thou poor Dromio's sophisms got  Who bids us vegetate and rot  Man but a rank and useless weed  Prove them alike and 'tis agreed  But the analogy of parts  Is all that's prov'd by skeptic arts  Say that "of vegetable race  "We spread the root from place to place  "The lovely flow'r of beauty blows  "Twin sister to the province rose  "Allures at morn the gazing eye  "That ere the ev'ning sees it die"  Say "years disrobe the mantled brow  "As winter strips th' autumnal bough  "The rough rude blast to both unkind  "Both perish by an eastern wind  "Or by the ax untimely blow  "Are laid their spreading honours low"  Admit Lorenzo this be true  Go onthe parallel pursue  Say "the tall elms you stately row  "Sweet transports of sensation know  "When zephyrs kiss the lily's breast  "The lily's rapture be confess'd"  Say "the broad oak when thunders roar  "Fears till the thunderstorm be o'er  "Conscious of doubt and dread by turns  "Stands trembling as the forest burns  "Alive awake to nature's laws  "From nature's scenes experience draws  "Throbbing its trunk with hopes and fears  "Grown old in wisdom as in years"  Is this absurd absurd indeed  Lorenzo how unlike a weed  To moral arguments dost run  Here shall we end as we begun  Sayst thou "the virtuous when they die  "In their own right ascend the sky  "The wicked here unpunish'd go  "To torment in the world below  "Heaven's justice else we should arraign  "And prove the virtuous good in vain"  You take my friend for granted here  What none by reason make appear  That vice at God Almighty's hands  Eternal punishment demands  While endless bliss beyond the skies  Justice bestows as virtue's prize  Justice Lorenzo what my friend  By justice dost thou here intend  Her sword she holds but say what ails  The equilibrium of her scales  How low the one tho empty lies  To kick the beam while t' other flies  Alas I see by what compell'd  In diff'rent mediums are they held  One in material fluids buoy'd  The other in a perfect void  Weigh'd in eternity and time  The punishment against the crime  Dare the selfrighteous tribe to say  That heaven's no more than virtue's pay  While vice demerits endless woe  Needs God a friend fears God a foe  Holding vindictive rage in store  For his own sake on man to pour  O Nounhurt th' Almighty cause  Or kept or broken human laws  Cease then presumption to contend  That mortals heaven can so offend  As at an infinite expence  To answer a finite offence  To pay the fine immortal made  Which else they never could have paid  The dying wretch tho tyrants cure  But tortures longer to endure  With nature cruelly at strife  When criminals are quit with life  Can God whose tender mercies flow  O'er all his varied works below  Whose loving kindness all confess  Whose name the distant nations bless  Say can this God of boundless love  Vengeful as earthly tyrants prove  O shame Lorenzo shame to all  Who cruelty can justice call  Such argument beside is vain  Unless the premises were plain  Unless we first could make it clear  That vice can ne'er be punish'd here  That virtue must be ever blest  For following but its interest  Or that we truly could define  That justice mortals call divine  By metaphysicks dost thou strive  To keep the man in death alive  Wouldst thou set moral pleas aside  The body from the soul divide  Material that and born to die  While this a native of the sky  Objects that none can hear and see  Hence claiming immortality  But say is thy corporeal claim  Laid to the matter or the frame  Is it the substance of the heart  Or make that is the mortal part  Doth change of form bring death alone  Form we must immaterial own  If to the essence of the clay  Again mortality we lay  Doom'd the loath'd carcass to the worm  The substance changes but its form  Through modes of being given to range  Immortal in perpetual change  Matter by all the skeptic crowd  Essentially the same allow'd  In death in life our shame our pride  In various forms but modified  Say then the matter or the frame  Or both in body have a claim  Nor mortal nor immortal we  From our materiality  Lorenzo doth thy bosom beat  To claim in heaven th' immortal seat  So fond of thy existence here  Dost thou annihilation fear  To fall as undistinguish'd clay  To dumb forgetfulness a prey  The joys of paradise in view  Sayst thou "thy claim must needs be true  "Else wherefore doth thy fond desire  "To immortality aspire"  Whate'er in hope be heaven's intent  This is my friend no argument  I too perhaps so pleas'd to live  My very means of life might give  All I am worth from death to save  If hope were buried in the grave  But let Lorenzo never trust  To wish or hope however just  Nor let a passionate desire  To reason's sober task aspire  Wouldst thou false principles defend  Because they serve a pleasing end  Who loves the truth will sure despise  Her cause to rest on specious lies  What merit doth it add to worth  That knaves its virtues babble forth  What added weight or consequence  In suffrage gives the fool to sense  Again is't said "so closely join'd  "In life the body and the mind  "Reciprocally form'd to bear  "Each other's weight of pain and care  "Sharing alike the mutual

to the organs join'd  "Poor mortals of sensation void  "As these are damag'd or destroy'd  "Therefore the soul on sense depends  "And with the failing organ ends"  Lorenzo thro a darken'd glass  Seest thou but faintly objects pass  More darken'd yet dost thou confess  Thy certainty of vision less  With its transparency thy sight  Decreasing till obstructed quite  Suppose it broke or let it fall  Dost think thou couldst not see at all  Ridiculous when objects lie  All open to the naked eye  Thus may the soul to body join'd  Be deaf irrational or blind  But take th' obstructing organs hence  At liberty its native sense  By fits no more it hears and sees  As now by piecemeal and degrees  In partial modes adapted here  To organs of the eye and ear  But intellect all ear all eye  It reads the wonders of the sky  At once what nature can disclose  Of scientific secrets knows  Now sense and science both combin'd  In each perception of the mind  But here Lorenzo for a while  Lay by the metaphysic foil  With this behind our darken'd glass  Too apt to make a blund'ring pass  By much more anxious on the whole  To guard the body than the soul  Too nice th' anatomizing art  To take them dextrously apart  Let us on both inquiry plan  And scrutinize their compound man  Contented from his present state  To reason of his future fate  Doth Dromio say to hold dispute  "Man if no plant is

expence  Luxurious casts his cares aside  Or starves thro indolence or pride  Here no preeminence his claim  Insects in life and death the same  Is there no medium in dispute  Must man be either God

pert baboon un homme d'esprit  Or own on this sagacious plan  A monkey's nat'rally a man  Let rash polemicks idly prate  Of nature and a nat'ral state  The arts of social life despise  And think that brutes are only wise  Pretending better had it been  If kings and priests we ne'er had seen  If lawless ignorant and wild  Man had been left while yet a child  With brutes to share a common fate  More blest than in his present state  Go thou and act a social part  Man's nat'ral state's a state of art  'Twas nature when the world was young  Made loose our first great grandsire's tongue  Taught his wild sons the force of speech  And gave the human pow'r to teach  To social converse tun'd the ear  Gave mutual love and mutual fear  Inspir'd the hero warm'd the friend  And bade the strong the weak defend  'Twas nature gave religion's rule  And bade the wise conduct the fool  In justice gave the law to save  The weak and honest from the knave  'Twas nature rais'd our thoughts on high  In contemplation to the sky  Taught us to beat the wilds of space  And worlds on worlds in ether trace  Planets and suns unknown explore  And hence their maker God adore  All this you artificial call  I heed not empty terms at all  Call it by whatsoever name  'Tis human nature's special claim  Say from mere phrases to depart  How differs nature here from art  Within the solitary wood  Rears the old brock her helpless brood  For safety scouring to her den  At sight or sound of dogs and men  'Tis nature warns her not t' expose  Herself or offspring to her foes  But sends her to the safe retreat  Where both enjoy their rest and meat  Why rears not man in forest wild  Or acorn grove his fav'rite child  But lodg'd in towns and nurs'd with care  Protects and feeds his fondled heir  Experter sure were human race  If train'd in forests for the chase  The chase that might our food provide  And what need animals beside  Lorenzo here we plainly find  The characters that mark our kind  'Twas nature knowledge did impart  Which time has ripen'd into art  But call it art or what you will  'Tis nature human nature still  As natural for us my friend  To bid the cloudcapt tow'rs ascend  To bid the floating castles ride  On moving mountains of the tide  As for the bird and beast their food  To seek in thicket plain or wood  To build the nest or dig the den  Far distant from the haunts of men  Science disprove it those who can  Is therefore natural to man  To other animals denied  This best and worst excuse for pride  There are 'tis true who gravely hold  "Grimalkin's no essential scold  "That men and monkies differ wide  "The former to the heavens allied"  Striving to prove by various means  "That brutes are nothing but machines"  But can we e'er with these suppose  Springs lodg'd within the terrier's nose  Direct his nimble feet to go  Where the old fox lies earth'd below  Or that by mere mechanicks Tray  Pursues his master's doubtful way  For me I frankly must impute  True syllogisms to e'en the brute  A pow'r of reason spite of pride  No more to him than man denied  So much admitting dost thou say  "I fairly throw my cause away  "Unless to brutes heaven also give  "In immortality to live"  Lorenzo noTho' less refin'd  My pleas are of another kind  Low as the dust tho' here we lie  Yet death may raise us to the sky  Is man a worm 'Tis here his fate  To winter his

Perfect the bird and beast we find  Advance not here their sev'ral kind  From race to race no wiser grow  No gradual perfection know  T'increasing knowledge void their claim  Still their specific

WHERE Hodge ye great oaf have you been  That you ha'not yet been to the play  The playhouse at Richmond I mean  Which i'faith is most gallant and gay  We shewfolk have seen afore now  Enact kings and queens in a barn  But this is a palace I vow  And a costly one too as I learn  I star'd as you'll think all about  To see such a wonderful thing  But I found when the secret came out  'Twas design'd to be fit for the king  God bless'n had he but been there  And the queen I'd ha' gi'n half a crown  For they come not to wake nor to fair  And 'tis miles up to London fine town  Tho else there were smart folks enow  No wonder entic'd by such skill  For they play'd soI cannot tell how  But I doat on that Maid i'the Mill  So sweetly she sings without doubt  I could like and I'm sure so could you  Could a body but bring it about  But pize on it the maid's married too  Yet acting apart there's the scenes  All fresh as the barleymow sign  Shifting backwards and forwards like skreens  And painted most desperate fine  Then simple tho I as a sheep  The man of the shew was so kind  As to let me just have a bopeep  At the fine actorpeople behind  There I thought to have found out a flam  For of tinsel and stuff I've been told  But their dresses ecod were no sham  But velvet and silver and gold  In the greenroom which I took for blue  Gay ladies I saw richly dress'd  And some of them handsome ones too  But their manners were none of the best  For a lass with one leg in the air  The other kneehigh to be seen  With her head leaning back on her chair  Look'd like a carv'd ivory queen  Her red pouting nib lay so fair  For a kiss had I fear'd no denial  But her eyes sparkled " Do if you date"  So Ralph was afraid to stand trial  On the stage did you see her but dance  And skip here and there like a vapour  She'd fling you soon into a trance  To see what you'd see ev'ry caper  For whisking and frisking about  As nimble and light as a feather  Her petticoat makes such a rout  That one's heart and her heels go together  So Hodge if so be you're inclin'd  To the play we will go lad together  Next week if I hold in the mind  And God sends the farmers good weather  ON HUMAN CERTITUDE AND THE UNIVERSALITY OF SCIENCE  AN EPISTLE TO LORENZO  NOT to the fount of Hippocrene  Nor groves of laurel ever green  Nor where the sportive graces stray  With flowers is strown the Muse's way  Lorenzo no I more rejoice  At Reason's bold and manly voice  Than at the softest sprightliest air  Mirth ever sung to lighten care  Truth's sober tale more pleas'd to hear  Than all that tickle Fancy's ear  Tho such to babbling echo sweet  Aloud the public voice repeat  Her numbers then let Truth excuse  Tho rudely sing th' unpolish'd muse  Careless of ornament and proud  To differ from the singsong crowd  So boastful of the poor pretence  To swell with sound the starveling sense  Truth hopes not for poetic praise  To fiction sacred are the bays  Dost thou demand ingenuous youth  What is and who doth teach the truth  I answerWouldst thou learn of me  'Tis that wherein mankind agree  At least no safer truths we know  Than what the world will grant us so  The truth indeed as sages tell  Of yore lay buried in a well  So deep that hid for want of light  From ev'ry peering mortal's sight  The more suspicious than the rest  Conceiv'd its being was a jest  And as no soul could find it out  That fact itself was all a doubt  Philosophizing train of thought  Since by improving moderns caught  Who tell us nature trick'd mankind  When giving eyes she left us blind  Heaven making fools and thinking fit  To play upon their want of wit  But sure we boldly may receive  As truth what all mankind believe  Such universal faith a guide  In skepticism itself implied  Yet sayst thou "till the world unite  "To fix on some one rule of right  "Enquiry still is at a pause  "Still vague investigation's laws"  Lorenzo all with you and me  In points demonstrable agree  Conviction right or wrong the test  Of truth in ev'ry human breast  For what's demonstratively so  Believers ev'n profess to know  On Science hence our search must rest  An universal rule confess'd  Laid then those subtilties aside  Where human certitude's denied  Inquiry safely may proceed  To form its scientific creed  Let Prior's Solomon profess  His science all uncertain guess  Th' egregious sophist but affirms  A contradiction even in terms  For who his ign'rance can suppose  Of what he's conscious that he knows  Dost thou my pupil still delay  In search of truth afraid to stray  If plac'd belief in points alone  That are demonstratively known  These much too few and too confin'd  To serve the purpose of mankind  Lorenzo see to commonsense  How just how gen'ral the pretence  To nation climate age or sect  Unlimited without respect  Hence howsoever wide we stray  When church or system lead the way  All of necessity agree  In what alike they hear and see  For not a son of Adam's race  Innate conviction can efface  The highland loon the lowland lout  Wild Irish fierce and Cambrian stout  The boor that Rhynland's polder drains  Tho reason slumber in his brains  All the same premises in view  The same conclusions ever drew  For know that like our mother earth  Its human offspring at its birth  Where fertile clay and barren sand  Compose the variegated land  Th' unequal strata of the soil  Unequally demand our toil  The rich that toil with gain repay  Thrown on the poor our pains away  In man's uncultivated mind  So varied is the soil in kind  The flow'rs of science fresh and fair  On some expand without our care  On others scarce by culture grow  The buds that wither as they blow▪  Yet here essentially allied  Howev'r else diversified  The fertile marl the steril sand  Alike the seed or plant demand  Denied alike spontaneous grain  To Bergen's rocks and Baiae's plain  So not a truth innate our own  The seeds of knowledge must be sown  Experience slow must swell the root  And tend the fibres as they shoot  Or speedier aid instruction grant  And slips of foreign growth implant  The mental and material claim  Here too essentially the same  Grow seed or plant where'er it will  In kind 'tis propagated still  No soil nor climate can produce  From tares the barley's potent juice  To thorns no culture can assign  The purple honours of the vine  Thus when by simple nature's aid  Put forth sensation's tender blade  If to perfection hearer brought  It bloom and ripen into thought  Wherever situate the root  The same its intellectual fruit  Its taste its form perhaps we blame  But still its genus is the same  In this no poverty of soil  No dulness ever mock'd our toil  If vainly then in letter'd pride  The scholar deep is dignified  So false so empty the pretence  Of wits to more than commonsense  If plain to th' idiot as to you  Th' immediate object of his view  While ev'n the blockhead truly knows  Far as his little science goes  Consistent sure's our confidence  In search of truth on commonsense  That gen'ral index to mankind  To taste and genius unconfin'd  Pointing in all one common way  By dullness shorten'd but its ray  Of wit and knowledge all the end  In length that radius to extend  In stubborn age or pliant youth  Its bearing in the line of truth  A needle constant to the pole  Whence beams true faith upon the soul  Dost thou object "if commonsense  "So plausible an evidence  "And all mankind of this possess'd  "That any differ from the rest"  Know thou when honest minds dissent  Misunderstood's their argument  Diff'rent the premises appear  Else were the fix'd deduction clear  Hence half our numerous quarrels rise  We see not with each others eyes  So that precisely all alike  Nor terms nor things conception strike  For every individual draws  His plan by mere perspective laws  Fix'd to one station time and place  In pow'r no full survey to trace  The false mistaking oft for true  Observ'd at diff'rent points of view  So when to cheat the partial sight  And prove in mirth that black is white  With lights dispos'd the shades between  In folds is spread the artful scene  Oppos'd the colours strike the eye  And he affirms what you deny  Here spotless all appears and fair  Perceiv'd a total blackness there  The demonstration of his sight  Who doubts who knows not black from white  Thus evidence supports dispute  Nor one the other can refute  And yet is commonsense to blame  The premises were not the same  Were these alike tho say you err  Both would infallibly concur  For take each others point of sight  And set at once the matter right  Conceive not then because we find  One source of truth in ev'ry mind  We e'er shall individuals see  At ev'ry time and place agree  As soon amidst yon grove of trees  While plays a constant eastern breeze  We ev'ry single spray shall find  In one direction west reclin'd  For tho to truth alike our claim  Our taste nor sentiment's the same  For dusky green the jaundic'd eye  Mistakes the clearblue summer sky  The distant scene however bright  Is darkness to the shortofsight  To loaded ears as whispers still  The clack and thunder of the mill  Thus lost as colours on the blind  On dulness qualities refin'd  Than musick to the deaf no more  To ignorance th' abstracted lore  Hence oft objection calls us out  To satisfy the blockhead's doubt  Who not one proof whereon depends  His sought solution comprehends  The tritest arguments of yore  In vain repeated o'er and o'er  Proving how fruitless were the toil  The jarring world to reconcile  And yet as but from time and place  Our several modes of thought we trace  Alas how blindly do we run  Each others heresy to shun  Our own our glory and our pride  While curses all the rest betide  By pious children doom'd their  ire  By fires their children to hellfire  Heirs to salvation's brighter sphere  So strangely damn'd and damning here  Thus Calvin ignorantly raves  At souls which therefore Luther saves  To both denied Lord Peter's keys  Who shuts out hereticks like these  And yet ev'n those who boast to feel  Their bosoms burn with christian zeal  Who dooming dervizes to hell  With pride uncharitable swell  In Naz'reth bred or Bethle'm born  Had laugh'd our Saviour's birth to scorn  Mere Turks denounc'd for you and me  The bitter fruit of Zacon's tree  To eat with fiends below the doom  Of AntiMahomet and Rome  Yet blind as Sampson when despair  Had sunk his life below his care  The numbers wanton Gaza lost  Destroy'd but at his proper cost  Halfwitted Zeal of all the test  Itself condemns among the rest  For if requir'd by gracious heaven  Our service but as knowledge given  Should I in pope or mufti trust  For proving to their tenets just  Your rule to censure me or mine  Holds the like condemnation thine  Yet still more wicked weak and blind  This reprobating zeal we find  When void of truth absurd and vain  The tenets zealots thus maintain  For sure ridiculous and odd  That zeal precipitate for God  So short of knowledge that indeed  It understands not ev'n its creed  For know whate'er the world pretend  But few believe what they defend  In modes of faith tho falsehood taught  Nonsense is equally their fault  Thousands by forms of speech deceiv'd  Ne'er yet by mortal man believ'd  Creeds penn'd as said at heaven's command  In terms no soul can understand  Or such tho thunder'd from on high  That plainly give themselves the lie  But sure if words no sense convey  Faith in their utt'rance dies away  Nor can a single son of Eve  Apparent falsehood e'er believe  Belief no vague declaimer's rant  No bigot's creed no sophist's cant  'Tis not the scripture text to quote  To get our catechism by rote  O'er homilies to spend the day  At midnight half asleep to pray  To chatter matins at the dawn  Or gabble with the man of lawn  True faith that consciousness of soul  That times nor accidents control  Save those adapted and combin'd  To root conviction from the mind  For know that neither threat nor blows  Sincere belief can e'er impose  The monk's hot zeal the jesuit's skill  Lead not conviction as they will  Go turn inquisitor and burn  The hereticks all round in turn  The Turk refusing to resign  His sensual paradise for thine  The Indian that in death pretends  To visit but his former friends  Unless his faith what you may tell  Of joys in heaven and pains in hell  Not one of all the suffering tribe  Thy sentiments perforce imbibe  Howe'er induc'd by hope or fear  The mind is no free agent here  To change their faith beyond the power  Of martyrs at their dying hour  How idly then enthusiasts rave  Of systems that will damn or save  Or think true proselytes to gain  By torture gallows whip or chain  Since ever constant to its cause  True faith depends on natures laws  By nonsense nor caprice misled  The honest heart and sober head  How idly wild fanaticks preach  While ignorant of what they teach  The spirit ne'er affects the mind  Unless with th' understanding join'd  Nor hath the word if void of sense  To gospel pow'r the least pretence  Some certain meaning hence and plain  A saving faith must needs contain  If fix'd its object sure no less  The sense of terms our creed express  A parrot else if none deceive her  A sound and orthodox believer  Convinc'd as much as ever yet  The Athanasian paroquet  Let not fanaticism deceive  None can a mystery believe  Tho plung'd by zeal in error deep  While commonsense lies fast asleep  Their faith rash bigots strangely boast  The strongest his who's cheated most  Who least for truth presumes to search  But headlong runs into the church  For laid thy hand upon thy heart  The formule of thy creed impart  Dost thou its substance comprehend  Lo all its mystery's at an end  In spite of their misguiding Zeal  Here to their hearts let all appeal  Enough if just be their pretence  To honesty and commonsense  Here rests that umpire of mankind  Conscience the God within the mind  At eastern temples as of yore  Without the threshold of the door  In reverence did the zealot use  To doff and leave his dirty shoes  Like him the modern faithful taught  That reason is a thing of naught  Lest they should soil the church with doubt  Their understandings leave without  For ask who thus in mystery trust  If Euclid's demonstration's just  If truth the geometric art  Or subtile algebra impart  Unknowing what precisely meant  They honestly refuse assent  Confess they first must comprehend  Before they credit or contend  O self condemn'd O dead to shame  Have these a conscience void of blame  Who take no worldly points on trust  But scruple till they know them just  Yet their supreme concerns will rest  On tenets half the world contest  Conviction openly defy  And with their tongues their hearts belie  These the true faithful shall we call  These have alas no faith at all  For howsoe'er with art they strive  To keep absurdity alive  Cloath'd in equivocal disguise  Or garb of truth their specious lies  Still commonsense unrooted out  Will find a flaw to fix a doubt  And where one doubt is left behind  No firm belief informs the mind  Yet is there whose officious zeal  Pretends a consciousness to feel  A fix'd internal evidence  Of axioms hid from commonsense  A stronger testimony given  By inspiration breath'd from heaven  Lorenzo neither you nor I  What God reveals can e'er deny  But here how needful to be wise  To know where revelation lies  Art them thyself ihspir'd by Heav'n  Tell me what certain proof is given  Dost thou intuitively view  What reason tells thee must be true  No revelation here requir'd  How proves such truth that thou'rt ihspir'd  For why inspir'd if but to tell  What reason might have told as well  As truth beholds thy mental eye  What seems to all the world a lie  Thy proof imagination strong  Here also may'st thou still be wrong  If heaven hath ever fir'd conceit  Brandy has also done the feat  Nay oft th' infatuateofbrain  Of heav'n's presum'd injunctions vain  Have madly broke its dread commands  And dipt in blood their murd'ring hands  If God or devil then inspire  Of reason still we must inquire  And reason doubtless would reply  "Heaven never yet reveal'd a lie"  On others gifts confiding more  Dost give thine own pretensions o'er  Dost from th' inspir'd thy faith receive  And pin it on thy neighbour's sleeve  Reason or heaven must tell thee too  If such be more inspir'd than you  "Where then the proof" I frankly own  To me yet uninspir'd unknown  Such guides to me by madness fir'd  As madmen with the Turks inspir'd  In spite of Middleton and Hume  Dost thou on miracles presume  To revelation these thy guide  Thy faith by wonders verified  Go thou and easy of belief  My comrade ask if I'm a thief  If inspiration's false and true  Sure miracles suspicious too  And hence thy conduct most absurd  To take for one the other's word  Our souls how long to damn and save  Hath subtile priestcraft play'd the knave  Its pupils train'd from early youth  T' equivocate and hide the truth  To practise the deception nice  Of tricking hand or quaint device  To cheat the palate nose and eye  And gild that dirty pill a lie  Yet dost thou miracles maintain  Be here thy definition plain  The muse disdaining to reply  To such as shock the naked eye  Events as miracles dost own  Whose cause immediate is unknown  Or is thy faith establish'd more  On actions ne'er perform'd before  Alas my muchbelieving friend  The times of yore might these defend  When heretic freethinkers rose  That dar'd the holy church oppose  For infidelity renown'd  Asserting that the globe was round  Vile heresy whence doom'd to hell  Upsal's good bishop martyr fell  Wretches so impious as to hold  The earth about its axis roll'd  And as the years their courses run  Still took its journeys round the sun  Vile heresy for which 'tis said  Old Galileo too had bled  Had not the sage more loth to die  Recanting damn'd it for a lie  Ego Galileo corde sincero et fide non ficta abjuro maledico et detestor supradictos errores et haereses    In days of ignorance like these  When legends had the power to please  While love of wonder salv'd deceit  And gudgeons swallow'd whole the cheat  How little strange that monks and fryars  Should prove miraculously liars  Or converts to divines so sad  Turn out miraculously mad  But now a century worn away  Time working wonders ev'ry day  The vast discov'ries years have made  Have spoilt the wondermonger's trader  Wouldst thou since facts so strange of yore  Are now miraculous no more  Thy genuine miracles define  As real acts of power divine  Th' effects of some immediate cause  In fact transgressing nature's laws  Howdid th' omnipotent on high  Let those his laws at random fly  Or was his providence so blind  To what omnisciency design'd  That still his sov'reign will attends  To strike his foes or skreen his friends  That pow'r beyond th' Almighty's art  To nature's system to impart  Needful heaven's arbitrary fire  To blast a figtree or a liar  Lorenzo be not thou so vain  To think thus brittle nature's chain  From which whatever link we strike  Tenth or ten thousandth broke alike  Connecting systems all destroy'd  Unballanc'd worlds would strow the void  To atoms burst restor'd again  Old Chaos to his ancient reign  Unless in time the God attend  The works of his own hand to mend  Alas how blasphemous to say  That heaven can save no other way  Or that for trifles or in joke  Creation's sacred order's broke  For do we not in fact confess  If God may nature's laws transgress  The wise creator wanted skill  His vast intentions to fulfil  Or that th' intention tho his own  Was in th' extent to him unknown  Or still more impiously imply  That heaven can give itself the lie  Say then that miracles there be  They're but miraculous to thee  So many links conceal'd remain  Which form the complicated chain  True causes and effects between  In nature's providential scene  What tho without an obvious cause  We see inverted custom's laws  Must we immediately infer  That nature from itself can err  Commanded by the word divine  Say water chang'd itself to wine  Graves open'd wide their pond'rous jaws  A breath the sole apparent cause  Ah who shall boast that God revere  Creation's laws were broken here  Might not ten thousand springs unite  Causes too fine for mortal sight  Such varied wonders to produce  To providential ends of use  Form'd when by heaven its power display'd  The earth's foundation first was laid  Or when that logos was design'd  By miracles to save mankind  Think not Lorenzo nature strays  Whene'er the world is in amaze  Extend thy view from pole to pole  See one great miracle the whole  Where all events their cause succeed  As once the great firstcause decreed  Where order still from order flows  And never interruption knows  Capricious but to mortal sense  The harmony of providence  How strangely therefore bigots err  Who wonders to plain facts prefer  With list'ning ear who love to range  And greedy eye for all that's strange  Rejecting their creator's plan  The voice of God for that of man  Besides thy miracles confin'd  To former ages of mankind  Nature in these our latter days  Unmov'd by prayer and deaf to praise  Ne'er turning back nor led aside  To help our wants or sooth our pride  But keeping packhorse like its track  Bearing the world upon its back  Say such to revelation guide  For these on hearsay we confide  In want of proof on trust must take  For honest jew or gentile's sake  Since howsoe'er the truth's conceal'd  None trust in miracles reveal'd  Unless learn'd Jortin's scheme may pass  Of dreaming Balaam's talking ass  Dost thou secure historians trust  How know we if their tale be just  From num'rous causes prone to err  Dubious alas what these aver  What from deception e'er can save  The man whose trust is in a knave  To falsehood he how oft a tool  Whose confidence is in a fool  And should themselves the honest speak  The honest may be blind or weak  Be led a visionary dance  Like Peter in prophetic trance  Or Paul that sometimes hardly knew  If what he said was false or true  Inconscious his own word to take  If fast asleep or wide awake  My friend no wonder then at all  Adventures strange should such befal  Or that by wild opinions they  From truth are blindly led astray  Who like old wives in winter nights  Hear see and feel and chat with sprights  Their prudent caution therefore just  Who waking dreamers seldom trust  To whom light

cropt the fragrant thyme  When high in air a medling crow  Saw puss securely feast below  Meanwhile the hunters from afar  Let loose the yelping dogs of war  "Alas poor hare ere yet too late  "O let me warn thee of thy fate"  Exclaim'd the crow and quick descended  To give the good advice intended  The hare alarm'd with speed withdrew  Not doubting but the tale was trae  Whereas in truth th' unkennell'd pack  Had ta'en full cry a different track  But now to mount on wing again  The struggling crow attempts in vain  For while intent t'advise the hare  She lighted on the fowler's snare  And found at length herself the bubble  Of all her needless pains and trouble  Who meddle thus with others cares  Too oft neglect their own affairs  But who abroad for business roam  Should nothing leave undone at home  TO A NEWMARRIED LADY WHO INSISTED ON THE AUTHOR'S WRITING A SONG ON HER  MDCCLVIII  OF unmarried ladies goodnatur'd and gay  I often have sung as a body may say  But now I must sing as

think heaven an easy fool  Of wiser mortals made the tool  Takes counters vile for current coin  Our filthy rags for robes divine  We made its joint immortal heirs  For penance paltry alms and prayers  What racks their disappointed zeal  Dooms the poor culprit bard to feel  The thief whose rhimes the rents have stole  Long mark'd on their celestial roll  So angry bees take sudden wing  Furious the harmless boy to sting  Who less in anger than in play  O'erturns their labours in his way  Have they the poor their farthings lent  At more than th' usual cent per cent  Becauses the promises of heaven  For principal and interest given  Yet loth to mortgage house or land  Dealing ev'n these with sparing hand  Hard times and taxes wont to moan  T' excuse their adding to the loan  Spite of hypocrisy confess'd  The world's security the best  Vile us'rers yet ye think it hard  Your virtue should not meet reward  I think so toohence hence to hell  And there your worth to devils tell  Do here th' immoral pertly ask  What profits rise from virtue's task  If "vice and virtue bliss and woe  "Quit scores effectually below  "While unaffected heaven surveys  "Its ends fulfill'd in human ways"  Say they "if pain give pleasure birth  "To joy proportion'd grief on earth  "Our suff'rings all comparative  "What matters how th' ungodly live  "What can we gain by selfdenial  "Or standing virtue's fiery trial"  Virtue's clear gain my friend 'tis true  If any hid from me and you  Lodg'd in the dark decrees of fate  Awaits us in some future state  A gift heaven pleases to bestow  Wholly unmerited below  So whatsoever diff'rent state  May vice in future life await  Hid in the counsels of th' allwise  The reprobating secret lies  Predestination's awful plan  Beyond the scrutiny of man  Can yet Lorenzo weakly dream  That ours is an immoral scheme  Because we hold that joy and strife  Are ballanc'd probably in life  Whence equally nor blest nor curst  The lives of th' unjust and the just  Shines not the sun alike on earth  On good and bad of mortal birth  Falls not the plantenliv'ning rain  Alike on mountainheath and plain  Tho noxious there vile brambles shoot  Here sweetest flow'rs and choicest fruit  To reason's sober call my friend  Did the blind passions but attend  While ever present to the mind  A full conviction we might find  "That in the lust of mere desire  "No certain pleasure men acquire  "But what in extasy they gain  "They're sure to lose in future pain"  By truth enlighten'd hence to fly  The distant evil as the nigh  Men were no longer prone to vice  Now stript of all her charms t' entice  But arming in their own defence  Would stand in neutral innocence  Thro reason let a sensual eye  Th' enchanting form of vice espy  Equivocal in make and face  Her left side doth her right disgrace  As form'd to give and share delight  One blooming cheek doth hearts invite  While roguish loves in ambush lie  And dart their arrows from her eye  A polish'd arm a taper side  Her thigh that scarce her garments hide  Her wellturn'd leg and ancle neat  The half of beauty's form compleat  But ah the contrast side appears  Worn out with care and grey with years  With wrinkled brow and squinting eye  Scowling most haggardly awry  While hollow cheek and nostril maim'd  Notch'd ear burnt hand and thighbone lam'd  Display a wretch▪ from head to tail  Diseas'd with many a desp'rate ail  A form which wrapt in squalid dress  Compleats the half of ugliness  Behold the charmerthis is vice  Embrace herIs thy stomach nice  Too often passion singleey'd  Enamour'd with the fairer side  The monster clasps till turn'd her face  We starting fly her loath'd embrace  Thro reason's medium only shown  Her real form in tints her own  Which thus disgusting to the sense  Could ne'er beguile our innocence  Should virtue then disown the muse  At least let innocence excuse  The strictest moralists content  If mortals were but innocent  In actual virtue true indeed  I see no hopes we should succeed  If once by reason grown so tame  That naught our passions could inflame  For say desires may not extrude  A sense of moral rectitude  This only points to what is right  But ne'er to virtue can excite  Reason indiff'rent to th' event  Merely bestows its cold assent  As far as truth's concern'd in part  Speaks to the head but not the heart  Reason bestow'd an humble friend  Not to keep faultless but to mend  With hopes to cheer or fears to bind  Selflove a glutton deaf and blind  To give our scene of action light  To check the sensual appetite  To show us what is good ahd fair  And passion's blunders to repair  To virtue sense of right and wrong  Must of necessity belong  But from this knowledge who infer  The conscious party cannot err  Nay founded on such sense our claim  To bear of vice the moral blame  The fool the mad do what they will  Standing excus'd of moral ill  Say then the virtuous must be wise  In wisdom sayst thou virtue lies  By other motives must the mind  To virtuous actions be inclin'd  "What other motive" dost thou ask  Lorenzo difficult the task  T' unravel here the human mind  Its moral principles to find  Sayst thou we all true virtue love  And virtue that which all approve  Supposing this yet is't with you  That very approbation too  Is this Lorenzo what is meant  By virtue sprung from sentiment  See Hume on the general principles of morals  By that ambiguous term of art  The native goodness of the heart  Pride not yourselves ye pharisees  That acts of kindness give you ease  Nor think ye publicans from heaven  An evil inclination's given  Know that from diff'rent passions vice  And virtue take not sep'rate rise  For tho deducing moral ill  But from th' indulgence of the will  No passion not the love of pelf  Is really vicious in itself  The noblest in the human breast  Motives to action but confess'd  Howe'er admir'd howe'er approv'd  From actual virtue far remov'd  For a good heart as put to use  Or vice or virtue may produce  A fertile soil where taking root  Plants good and bad bear equal fruit  Narcissa boasted once a mind  The purest sure of human kind  Till growing passions taught her breast  To feel for all that seem'd distress'd  To melt in tenderness of grief  And sigh to give unask'd relief  Ah since by cruel arts betray'd  How low is fall'n the hapless maid  Too innocent to feel distrust  Or know how diff'rent love and lust  Now by her tempter ev'n accus'd  See her abandon'd and abus'd  Her open heart her generous mind  To prostitution how resign'd  Of vices glorying in the shame  Her former self had blush'd to name  Alas for pity see meanwhile  At lost Narcissa's ruin smile  Gremia to pity never mov'd  As little loving as belov'd  In spite of all vile man could say  In pious maidenhood grown grey  Blessing her better stars that she  Still triumphs in her chastity  Tho with the planets on her fide  Illnature ugliness and pride  See Phormio stoically cold  In youth by constitution old  Who never yet his heart of stone  Made once another's cause his own  But living for himself or heirs  Minds nothing but his own affairs  Whose word to take not faithless Jews  For more than heaven is worth refuse  His credit sacred east and west  His bills negotiating best  Safe in his hands were many a pound  Too good a man to run aground  O worthy honest man we cry  While bankrupt knaves in dungeons lie  So vile the rogue who scorning pelf  Lov'd others better than himself  Thus oft th' inflexible the just  The man who never broke his trust  Is virtuous but from fear or art  Or killing coldness in his heart  While base and mean the quickofsense  From glowings of benevolence  Lorenzo feelingly I speak  Of failings where myself am weak  To whom adversity evere  Hath sold experience much too dear  Hard hearted prudence far from me  And narrowsoul'd frugality  Hence oft to knave and fool a prey  No match for either in his way  Till cheated plunder'd fill'd with shame  Lit on my luckless head the blame  How short Lorenzo plainly hence  Of virtue is benevolence  To mere good nature while you live  No more that pompous title give  The milk of kindness in a trice  Yielding the luscious cream of vice  The milk of human kindness a florid term in com∣mon use for benevolence    The dryest eye the hardest heart  May act as virtuous a part  Tho turn'd as adders deaf the ear  To all that others feel or fear  While vicious sloth a whining cheat  Is forc'd to work before it eat  Misfortune struggling in its thrall  Rises more glorious from its fall  Should to the prodigal the friend  On whom his spendthrift hopes depend  When ask'd assistance or advice  Reply with looks as cold as ice  With all the insolence of ease  "Friend you know best do what you please"  May this not teach the hand profuse  Virtuous discretion's sov'reign use  And thus a coldness of the heart  A good to too much warmth impart  How oft less vicious is the mind  That ne'er beneficent or kind  For others broke one moment's rest  Nor cheer'd with comfort the distress'd  Than his whose open hand and heart  Espouse the poor and needy's part  Plunging in unforeseen distress  Hundreds in striving one to bless  Too short of sight benevolence  Proves oft a breach of innocence  To virtue therefore it is first  Requir'd the man be strictly just  Passions the springs of joy and strife  Are but the elements of life  And as rich streams from mountains flow  Smooth winding some through vales below  While others raging as they come  Tear up their mothermountain's womb  Or pouring down the hills amain  Deluge at once the humble plain  So flow some passions gently mild  While others furious bold and wild  Foaming o'er reason's rockbuilt mounds  Disdain the check of moral bounds  But see in pastures streams of use  When art corrects the flood's abuse  When their due channels taught to keep  In shallow brook or river deep  Smiling thro dappled meads they go  And paint the flow'rs they cause to grow  Corrected thus by reason's art  The bursts or meltings of the heart  In virtue's channels see them glide  Her flow'rs the blooming margin's pride  Is the small spring thy fav'rite theme  That trickles forth a shallow stream  In murmurs soft a purling rill  What wilt thou do to drive the mill  How wilt thou make to ride at large  Thy timber or thy loaded barge  As much as purling rills admir'd  The navigable stream's requir'd  The stream whose turbulence abides  The roaring of the swelling tides  Alike whose raging bosom swells  And back the threat'ning tide repels  The hero thus the soldier brave  It should seem that Mr Pope supposed heroism incom∣patible with virtue from the following lines in his Essay on Man  Heroes are much the same the point's agreed  From Macedonia's madman to the Swede  The whole strange purpose of their lives to find  Or make an enemy of all mankind  I will grant that many heroic actions have been atchieved which have given just room for those who have no tincture of heroism in themselves to suppose the hero to be without either head or heart But however reprehensible the con∣duct of heroes may have been in general history may inform us that many of the distinguishing blessings mankind enjoy have been effected by those whom narrowminded moralists have stigmatized as knaves or madmen  How needful half the world to save  Like Prussia's king thro seas of blood  Wading for threaten'd Europe's good  Virtuously useful to mankind  The strongest as the weakest mind  Thus one's no better than the other  The warmest heart the cold one's brother  And neither this nor that in fact  Are virtuous till as such they act  Yet here appearances believ'd  In virtuous actions oft deceiv'd  How plain in th' hypocritic face  We read the characters of grace  And falsely to youth's giddy tribe  Designing villainy ascribe  While time and circumstance and place  Our byass'd judgments here disgrace  Is there a man whose tender heart  Takes in another's pains a part  Who cloathes the naked feeds the poor  And bribes the orphan to his door  So kind he cannot bear to see  Another less at ease than he  Godlike benevolence you cry  And praise his virtue to the sky  But were this virtuous mortal poor  Oblig'd to beg from door to door  Could he not eat the bread at rest  Torn by the law from the distress'd  Should his weak mind compunction feel  In honest ways of trade to steal  Could not the softness of his heart  Torture the horse that draws the cart  Mangle the lamb before it die  Or draw its heart's blood thro its eye  Who would not cry "too proud to serve  "Work idle wretch or work or starve"  To Bridewell's lash the knave consign'd  For vicious tenderness of mind  Is there who worn with vice begins  To hide his multitude of sins  Leave of the wicked world doth take  And hermit turns for virtue's sake  Or anxious for the souls of men  Flies to the pulpit or the pen  Behold another Paul we cry  A new apostle from on high  Are there whom cares nor want exclude  At little cost from doing good  In pious practices that spend  Their fortune and their latter end  The sick who physic in distress  And make the trav'ler's burthen less  To these what virtue will refuse  The praiseful elegiac muse  But say doth tenderness of heart  Teach the divine's or doctor's art  Too oft unletter'd preachers rave  And damn the souls they meant to save  Too oft alas the pious pill  Of charity like Ward's doth kill  While lighten'd more the pedlar's pack  To clothe our own than save his back  "Whence then is virtue" dost thou cry  In truth and nature I reply  Reason and passion both combin'd  To form true virtue in the mind  Nor rests it there in mere design  To go where these may chance t' encline  'Tis not sufficient to set out  Tho meaning well thy way in doubt  Here known experience shouldst thou use  That passion reason mayn't abuse  Cautious in virtue's rout to go  No farther than our path we know  Lest when thro ign'rance lost our way  Passion to vice should lead astray  'Tis not enough to mean aright  Unless the meant effect's in sight  Too apt to wander from the mark  When blund'ring forward in the dark  'Tis no excuse to have it said  The heart had put it in the head  When mischief done instead of good  For want of being understood  To virtue pitiful our claim  When at a venture taking aim  More by good luck than sense or wit  The mark of moral good we hit  What virtue's in the madman's dream  Or fool's impracticable scheme  Whose should they ev'n succeed at best  Chancemedley virtue is confess'd  Knowledge my friend goes hence 'tis plain  Foremost in virtue's splendid train  While reason and the passions join'd  Walk closely hand in hand behind  Is't said "one mere goodnatur'd deed  "All worth in science doth exceed"  One moral or a mere wellnatur'd deed  Can all desert in sciences exceed  DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM  On this weak maxim dost object  We virtuous merit here neglect  Thus honest ign'rance to contemn  And inability condemn  Sayst thou "as no foreknowledge given  "Events are in the hands of heaven  "And therefore virtuous those confess'd  "From

talents lent which unapplied  'Tis virtuous in the earth to hide  No with the pow'r of reason blest  Improvement's claim'd as interest  Is there who turns away his ear  Instruction's voice averse to hear  Most obstinately bent to plod  Along the road his father trod  Old custom never to forsake  Nor use of eye or ear to make  Tho right the wilful wretch we find  Is his a virtuous turn of mind  With God above or man below  How is't deserving not to know  Of virtue's merit Folly hush  Nor put true wisdom to the blush  Remember virtue still depends  Both on our motives and our ends  What merit is't we gladly do  That which our hearts incline us to  Or what that reason doth submit  To own the truth is right and fit  For say that by the heart or head  Solely to virtue men were led  If by the heart and that alone  What man e'er call'd his heart his own  Right oft by impulse forc'd to go  Whether his reason lead or no  Apparently against the will  As oft conducting him to ill  How meritorious then the best  That love or pity warms the breast  For this nor that from vice can save  Or if they could'tis God that gave  Is it from caution practis'd long  You seek the right and shun the wrong  By just experience understood  Your worldly interest's to be good  What merits here the clod of earth  That nature smil'd upon its birth  And gave it reason's fost'ring aid  To teach it virtue as its trade  Sayst thou "when head and heart we prais  "Doth this not virtue's merit raise  "The man of vicious acts asham'd"  May yet for spiritual pride be blam'd  "The elegantly just"too nice  Perhaps for vulgar scenes of vice  "The lowlyminded kind and meek"  Mean pitiful perhaps and weak  "The patriot in his country's cause"  A gudgeon greedy of applause  "The pious who their God revere"  Only perhaps of hell in fear  Or not by fears sufficient driven  Push'd forward by the hopes of heaven  So little do we truly know  The cause to which we virtue owe  To what bad principle or good  Ev'n we ourselves have vice withstood  Nor can the best of mortals say  From what has yet directed may  Or in a state he never knew  Tell what his head and heart might do  Who then their moral worth shall prize  Shall ev'n the best the worst despise  Thin the partitions that divide  Ev'n vice itself from virtue's pride  The virtuous boaster weak and proud  Like the tall idiot in the crowd  Who stalking with exalted tread  Above his fellows rears his head  While from his more distinguish'd height  The harm upon his pate doth light  The pride of virtue hence depress'd  O learn to pity not

 For whose embrace my vows I pay  In ardent sighs throughout the day  Nor when the longest day is o'er  Cease by the midnight lamp to pore  O'er the dull tale or tedious page  Of saint or more

beavers kept their hold  Their island cabbins duly stor'd  And feasted at a plenteous board  To industry and labour bred  Meanwhile they toil'd as well as fed  Nor waited their decreasing store  To fail ere provident of more  Continual plenty hence by stealth  Grew up to luxury and wealth  When now alas in evil hour  To wealth succeeds the thirst of power  No longer satisfied to reign  Sole masters of the wat'ry main  To see the trembling otter fly  Hereditary Enemy  Condemn'd tho starving on the shore  To trespass on the lake no more  Contented not that nature gave  The spoils and triumphs of the wave  But vainly fond to shew their might  Or turn out champions for the right  They interfere in all disputes  Between the continental brutes  And parties in their feuds to make  Their island tenements forsake  Transporting madly brutes and stores  Blind war to wage on foreign shores  And save from otters bears and cats  Landbeavers vile or worthless rats  Meanwhile at home is various ways  Their wealth's consum'd their strength decays  Recruits and payment of allies  Demand exorbitant supplies  While e'en by battles fought and gain'd  Their little state is only drain'd  Sagacious creatures shall we call  The brutes that squander thus their all  Or shall we not their wit deride  Who thus expose their weakest side  But time and circumstance you say  May change the face of thingsThey may  Yet neither sure can change the nature  Of brutal more than human creature  And yet as if some revolution  Had happen'd in his constitution  Thus oft the beaver leaves his home  On mountain wilds for wars to roam  Unnatural wars to him at least  Amphibious moistureloving beast  In which a generous jack with pride  He always takes the weakest side  And hires the poor at his expence  To stand up in their own defence  While ten to one he trusts the gods  To him are even trifling odds  As if to win his surest way  Was still to choose the losing play  Or loggerheads he took delight in  And fought but for the sake of fighting  Yet beavers are accounted wise  And need no burthensome allies  Their hold in liquid walls immur'd  From danger and assaults secur'd  Alas dame nature surely meant  Each creature for its element  If birds will dive and fishes fly  What wonder if they droop and die  Now so it happ'd as poets sing  A landrat was the beavers' king  By all belov'd without dispute  A just humane and honest brute  Who yet throughout his gracious reign▪  Too highly priz'd his old domain  Too poor too weak without allies  To stand amidst its enemies  And therefore at their own expence  The beavers purchas'd its defence  Or when by chance of war 'twas lost  Redeem'd it always at their cost  Bribing the tygers bears and cats  With subsidies to spare the rats  And keeping in their constant pay  The bandogs not to prowl that way  Now on a day it so fell out  The landed brutes began their rout  A cat of catamountain race  Spit in the lordly tyger's face  And aided by a wild shebear  In pieces vow'd his limbs to tear  The tyger bravely bid defiance  And claim'd the beaverking's alliance  Meanwhile the otters join'd the cats  And wreak'd their vengeance on the rats  A vengeance they were urg'd to take  For what they suffer'd on the lake  Where now their fishing haunts were gone  And holds all ruin'd one by one  And not an otter dar'd to dive  Or daring reach'd the shore alive  So powerful were the beavers grown  While conquest made the lake their own  Vain conquest if constrain'd at last  To sully all their glory past  By giving back each dearbought prize  To save their poor or weak allies  Who now by numerous foes enthrall'd  Aloud for their assistance call'd  The beavers readily consenting  To do what done they're sure repenting  And yet alas 'twas all in vain  The patriots ventur'd to complain  'Twas all in vain to represent  The stores immense they yearly spent  How much they ow'd and to their sorrow  How much they still were forc'd to borrow  In vain they shew'd the end they sought  When 'gainst the otters first they fought  By almost ev'ry battle gain'd  At length compleatly was obtain'd  And therefore having got their end  They need no longer to contend  But standing on their own defence  Might now contract the war's expence  And would the foe accept of peace  Exact a general release  Or sparing thus their blood and treasure  Might leave him to make peace at leisure  Remonstrance just but 'twas in vain  Success had turn'd each beaver's brain  The tyger's martial fame and fire  Did all their heated breasts inspire  And every honest plodding beaver  Seiz'd with a military fever  Careless of what was done or doing  Ran fightingmad the road to ruin  Nay ev'n the chief who once more loud  Than any of the patriot crowd  Roar'd out his insolent reflections  On the great rat and his connections  A ministerial beaver grown  Now bow'd obedient to the throne  And worse than either of the Brothers  Adopted measures damn'd in others  Measures himself condemn'd so late  As big with ruin to the state  Yet now he swallow'd all th' objections  He made before to land connections  "The tyger's call the rat's distress  "Demanded instantly redress  "And generous brutes should sacrifice  "Themselves their all for their allies"  How much unlike this specious cant  To all his former noisy rant  To that fine florid declamation  By which he us'd to gull the nation  But as the mob had been so loud  To praise this idol of the crowd  His friends were now asham'd to own  Their honest chief had chang'd his tone  And let him lead them by the snout  As tho he ne'er had turn'd about  Meanwhile with grief the patriot few  Who best the beaver's interest knew  Saw him on every flight pretence  Abuse the public confidence  And enter into every measure  Contriv'd to squander blood and treasure  Beheld the waste of both increase  To purchase war instead of peace  While more their toil and less their gain  How just a reason to complain  The fruits of all their labour thrown  Away in quarrels not their own  PHOEBUS DETECTED  WRITTEN AT A SUMMER THEATRE IN MDCCLXVII  THE country was wond'ring for

 Still resting on th' accepting wit  For who that read but comprehend  As taught by father priest or friend  Or tenets new more nice than wise  Peculiar to themselves devise  How then prevails the

Nor those for truth's defenders take  Who cavil but for cavil's sake  But is there layman or divine  In whom good sense and temper join  A priest of honest Clogher's  The late bishop of Clogher  mould  A thiest moderate as bold  To whom indulgent heaven assign'd  A truly ethic turn of mind  Who dares the mob in scorn to hold  Hath weigh'd the happiness of gold  Hath found the pond'rous cheat so

But fearful of himself to stand  Seiz'd his old tottering mother's hand  The church of Rome to which Mr Pope returned affter having written his Essay on Man for that he was a true Romancatholic at the time of his writing that essay is a tale adapted merely to the credulity of a Racine Un∣less indeed we have as little opinion of his judgment as his friend Bolingbroke had who is said to have ridiculed him as one who understood nothing of his own principles or saw to what they naturally led    Looks back Lorenzo shrinking now  When set his hand unto the plough  In vain we sacrifice to truth  The sportive giddiness of youth  If falshood's painted charms engage  The doating levity of age  Truth's thorny paths who fear to run  Should first her dangerous portal shun  Nor set like heroes boldly out  To founder in the deeps of doubt  Yet still bewaretho boldness thine  Temp'rance that boldness must refine  True temp'rance rational and brave  To stoic pride no sullen slave  Not such as gently meek and mild  Betrays the weakness of a child  Nor that without or fear or wit  By chance ev'n blunderers may get  The rash too angry to be bold  By Falshood oft are bought and sold  The proud too haughty to be wise  See not where grov'ling Errour lies  The heedless counts without his host  Or runs his nose against the post  And oft their tim'rous indolence  The meek indulge at Truth's expence  So hard to keep that middle way  From which enquiry ne'er should stray  While for the task so hard to find  A truly firm capacious mind  No wonder fools the wouldbewise  Suppose in doubt that wisdom lies  Or that because so short their sight  Truth may be errour wrong be right  Cicero somewhere observes there is no opinion how∣ever absurd which has not been espoused by some or other of the philosophers And nothing surely can be more so than the famous inference drawn from the weakness of the human understanding i e that because we do not com∣prehend every thing we in reality know nothing Agrippa it is true has declaimed prettily and the ingenious bishop of Avranches chopped logick as dextrously on the subject Yet alas such is the perverseness of common sense that the greatest part of mankind even to this day do insist on the certainty of their knowing their right hand from the left    For ignorance to sooth its pride  Must seek its own defects to hide  Affecting hence all unbelief  Is Scoto infidel in chief  His hand and heart his ears and eyes  Confessing what his tongue denies  To truth in ev'ry system blind  Yet seeking it where none shall find  Lorenzo here his wit's a cheat  That mocks his judgment with deceit  Where'er opinion gaily dress'd  Runs gadding in her rainbow vest  Among her sisterhood a crew  Of motley wives black red or blue  See skepticism the truth in chase  Run giddily from face to face  Now this now that by turns enjoy  Nor find them false till found to cloy  Thus with the fair he most admires  Full soon the wav'ring lover tires  At morn her smiles with rapture meets  At night affronts her in the streets  By loose suspicion wand'ring led  Or spider Fancy's flimsy thread  Till on some lying whore at last  He lights and holds her tenets fast  Nor strange oppos'd to these to find  In uniformity combin'd  Believing thousands who suppose  Truth with the croud for ever goes  As if convinc'd the rabble rout  Because too obstinate to doubt  Yet customs old or fashions new  Are all th' unthinking herd pursue  The orthodox in dress or song  As modish as to right and wrong  Whatever country you go into let the religion be what it will the unthinking part thereof are always the reputed orthodox  DED TO ESSAY ON SPIRIT    Of custom born to fashion bred  Thus blind credulity is led  While modes of faith like modes of dress  Mankind capriciously profess  Yet all agreed thro shame or pride  Nature's simplicity to hide  Whate'er the fashion of the time  It holds the naked truth a crime  Thus to a man we find the crowd  To doubt too bashful or too proud  In errour rather chuse to fall  Than boast no scheme of faith at all  Impatient hence of stop or stay  They blunder on the broadest way  Or make a guide in every street  Of fool or knave the first they meet  Authorities how blind and lame  Hence bring the credulous to shame  While all revere the mould'ring page  Where moths have spent their gothic

And leap'd whatever mares he found  Where'er he chose in safety fed  And made what straw he pleas'd his bed  But grown by long indulgence bold  He scorn'd at length to be controul'd  And when his master dar'd to lick him  Was sure with lifted hoof to kick him  At length howe'er by chance he fell  To one who knew the manage well  And bent to tame our restive jack  Resolv'd to let him for a hack  A neighbouring miller soon he found  Who corn for all the parish ground  And wanting such a beast to bear  The grist committed to his care  To him our sturdy ass was lent  At a large premium per cent  To market soon the miller goes  Leading the jackass by the nose  At night returning with a sack  Laid right across our hero's back  Who bending now beneath its weight  Began to sorrow for his fate  And as the miller lagg'd behind  Unburthen'd thus his troubled mind  "Alas for what mysterious end  "Must I beneath this burthen bend  "I that have liv'd an ass so free  "And bray'd in boundless liberty  "I that have long disdain'd the bit  "Must I insulted thus submit  "To bear a cruel weight alack  "That needs in time must break my back"  Then issuing forth a piteous groan  His load he gladly would have thrown  But that the miller fast had tied  And girt it on the underside  While having seen his inclination  He gave him hearty flagellation  With grumbling and no little scrubbing  Th' impatient ass put up the drubbing  But still most grievously complain'd  Of pains he either felt or feign'd  Again next day to market sent  with heavy heart and head he went  But guess with what disdain he burn'd  When with two sacks he back return'd  Yet thus t' augment his toil and trouble  Each day he found his burthen double  At the same time the truth be spoken  His wind and back remain'd unbroken  For tho a life of toil he led  The more he work'd the more he fed  So that at first tho lank and weak  He daily grew mere round and sleek  While as they added sack by sack  More sturdy seem'd his brawny back  In such good case 'twas all in vain  He found to murmur or complain  Tho constantly the trough to fill  More sacks were sent for to the mill  But no this tonic once set thinking  He judg'd at least when fresh with drinking  That fro  the grievous weights he bore  He gather'd strength but more and more  And might in time like Atlas carry  The world upon his backAy marry  'Twere fine if that could come to pass  But what so stupid as an ass  Know dull machine and have a care  There is a weight thou canst not bear  Much farther should thy masters try  Thy strength 'twill give their hopes the lye  Know even now thy life's at stake  A few more sacks thy back will break  Bethink thee then vain brute in time  Selfmurder is a horrid crime  Be passive to thy load no more  But freedom seek as heretofore  Nor think because thy belly's fed  No other care should fill thy head  A broken back may let me tell ye  Attend at last a bursting belly  Needs this our fable

ministers in piteous taking  Exclaiming oft her back was breaking  Who now tho ten times more lies on her  Maintain she'll bear it off with honour  As if by sufferance taught t' endure  The same the

at her command  Those favours with as lavish hand  On others she bestows  XIX  Yet think not fortune's wild caprice  O Bruhl shall e'er destroy my peace  Or fill my heart with spleen  I use with gratitude as mine  Her gifts which yet I can resign  Without the least chagrin  XX  By nobler sentiments inspir'd  By nobler views to virtue fir'd  Ev'n poverty I'd wed  Did she a portion for a king  Integrity and honour bring  To crown her nuptial bed  AN EPISTLE TO AR MY ESQ  ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS LAST NEW COMEDIES  YOU'LL doubtless M y be surpriz'd to see  My rhimes address'd familiarly to thee  Nine years or thereabouts now gone and past  Since the first time I saw you and the last  But as epistles 'tis the mode to write  Witness the Day  By Dr Armstrong  and witness too the Night  By Mr Churchill    Why may not I be modishly employ'd  And write to you as Churchill does to Lloyd  My grave acquaintance may reply 'tis true  That I have got much better things to do  What then no respite must the jaded mind  From paradox and crabbed problems find  Must I perplex'd continue evermore  On puzzling schemes and diagrams to pore  Dull Philomath himself gets these dismiss'd  And spends his evenings pleasantly at whist  Now just as pleasantly I pass my time  Set in to play an harmless game at rhime  Severer studies may more nobly please  But pleasure yields the palm sometimes to ease  And tho' no great adept in Philo's way  The haut calcul or conjuring algebra  Yet entre nous of that perplexing stuff  Call'd metaphysicks I have had enough  And therefore hope no censor will refuse  An hour's indulgence to an idle muse  Idle I call her who ne'er toils to please  Verse if I write 'tis always at my ease  No poet bred compleatly careless I  Whether my Pegasus or creep or fly  Whether on hobbling feet my lame verse goes  Or soft and smooth in easy numbers flows  Whether in lines the rhime and sense chime pat  To me as Falstaff says all's one for that  Criticks allow in looser strains 'tis fitting  Epistolary writing should be written  I smile to see the letter to a friend  With curious art and studied caution penn'd  Fill'd with choice terms and freed from all defect  So nice so quaint so labour'd so correct  Nor should I shake my sides much more to see  The messenger with like propriety  Take equal caution not to soil or tear it  And in a birthday suit ride post to bear it  My plain muse travels in less state the roads  And brings for letters elegies nor odes  Booted and spurr'd she leaves her palfry free  Nor picks the flowery paths of poesy  Culls thee no plants that on the borders smile  Therewith t'adorn another Desart Isle  But jogging on nor seeks nor shuns the dirt  Fearless herself as meaning none to hurt  And when of flowers of rhetorick in need  Takes up with highway furze or hedgerow weed  And tho' e'en these with safety may not pass  The keen reviewer's hardmouth'd critic ass  Here let him crop the literary thistle  Hard are his gums who grinds  A polite term used among certain criticks for review∣ing books  this rough epistle  Authors you know and actors as they're call'd  Have been of late unmercifully maul'd  Whilst My you howe'er to own it loth  A fellowfeeling must have had for both  Indeed 'twas natural in th' adventurous wit  Who brav'd at once both coffeehouse and pit  To feel for those engag'd in either case  To prove their powers of genius lungs or face  Bold was the man who ventur'd first to sea  The first line of an old prologue which Mr My has imitated in the prologue to his last new pieces    Poh all's comparativehe bold not he  Bold is the man indeed who in this age  Ventures his works or person on the stage  Doom'd to submit to th' insolence of power  And wait an o'ergrown actor's leisure hour  To watch his coming at the playhouse door  Or what is worse the lodgings of his whore  To bear a manager's insulting airs  Prime ministers not half so proud as players  To find himself of all their art in need  Shewn how to write by those who cannot read  Or kindly taught to mouth a speech as well  As one who in his life ne'er learn'd to spell  But mortified seven years this penance past  Suppose himself or play brought on at last  What is the raging of the stormy seas  A stormy house no merit can appease  The gods above may hear the seaman's prayer  But gallery  The gentry in the galleries are commonly called the god in the playhouse stile  gods nor bard nor actor spare  How have I seen their light'nings flash around  And dart in shape of candles to the ground  Those flaming instruments of vengeance hurl'd  Threat'ning destruction to the mimic world  Totus mundus agit histrionem    How have I seen them wanton in their ire  Shower down their rattling balls of solid fire  Pippins and oranges to mortal eyes  But thunderbolts they were in that disguise  Which th' angry gods to strike presumption dead  Aim'd at th' aspiring player's devoted head  How have I heard arise the dismal yell  Where poets damn'd and damning critics dwell  When now the demons of th' infernal pit  Tear up the lordly thrones on which they sit  And wanting lightnings hurl their seats in rage  With double horrour on th' affrighted stage  In vain mean while the powers of earth and air  Skreening the destin'd victim from despair  While heav'n and hell appear at once combin'd  With fate itself against the culprit join'd  For lo aloft beneath a catcall's form  Malicious Fun shrill spirit of the storm  See Fingal    Pleas'd with the ruin of th' advent'rous wight  Enjoys the glorious mischief of the night  Hard lot of Genius but as such the rage  Of these tremendous rulers of the stage  Let me advise thee tempt thy fate no more  Where critics groan fools hiss and bullies roar  Forbear to wage with witlings endless war  But push thy better fortunes at the bar  No criticks groaning for damnation call  Within the precincts of Westminsterhall  Nor gods above nor devils in the pit  There pelt their council for his want of wit  But all are kept in a tremendous awe  By the dread weight and dullness of the law  Beneath whose influence gouty rich and fat  May'st thou outbully Nn and outpatriot Pt  MARY THE COOKMAID'S ADDRESS TO HER FELLOW ARTISTS OF LONDON AND WESTMINSTER  AN IMITATION OF SWIFT  WRITTEN SOON AFTER HIS MAJESTY'S ACCESSION  GE'MEN and ladies of the spits pots saucepans and kettles  And all the other 'tensils made use of in dressing of wittles  These lines are to let you know that I wonder what you mean  That you don't all meet together dress'd sweet and clean  And while you see 'tis the fashion throughout the nation  To 'drefs the KGod bless him with 'dolence and 'gratulation  Go all in a body and present him your duty on his accession  As other loyal subjects of like respectable profession  You hear that as how the painters and gravers that dine at  The foundling hospital and called themselves artists design it  Now that we are artists as well as they stands upon record in bookery  For who of you all hath not read books on the Art of Cookery  Nay I myself have wrote a volume upon it But let that pass  Tho' it was allowed to be as full of 'rudition as Mrs Glasse  And but that I then liv'd well and thought begging an impropriety  I might have had if I had ask'd a premium from the whatdoyecallit society  For you are to know that I have not had so low a breeding  But that tho' a cookmaid I am hadup  Adept  in writing and reading  And remember that Mr Pope when he tells of lord Timon's feats  Joins together the artists of pictures musick meats  Stand up therefore my friends for the honour of your profession  And insist upon making a party in the artist's procession  But if you are prevented by those nigglers of the pencil and chissel  Make a procession of your own and let them go whistle  At the same time give a hint to their cook who is the son of a sinner  If while they are gone to St James's he don't take care to spoil their dinner  Nay for the slight already put on us as I hold my pen  If ev'ry cook was of my mind they should never have a good dinner again  They pride themselves mightily on their taste to be sure  But in all matters of taste a cook must certainly be the greatest coneysewer  Connoisseur    I like such fellows pretending to have of us no opinion  When I'll be hanged if any of them know the taste of a shalott from an onion  They are so vain forsooth of their paultry rareeshow of painting  I am sure I was starved and squeedged  Squeezed  there till I was almost fainting  Such sights may serve indeed your skinny scraggy people of condition  But in my mind a wellroasted sirloin of beef is a much more better exhibition  Let these upstarts however do as they will I do seriously profess  That as to going to St James's I think you can do no less  For if what I have heard be true our calling is aggriev'd  And 'tis necessary you should do your best to get it reliev'd  Being told as how that goodeating is going out of fashion  Which is you know enough to put any cook in the world into a passion  But what vexes me most and seems to be a bad presage is  That I hear the Kg's servants are all actually at boardwages  So that as his example will likely be followed by the quality  Goodbye to new French sauces and old English hospitality  Nay John the butler tells me tho' he's a little waggish  That one of the greatest ladies in the kingdom sups on Scotch kale and haggis  Not but what ladies should eat what they like but 'tis so comical  That great folks should be as our chaplain says so ecanonical  Oeconomical    I would have you therefore go and make an humble representation  Of the evils that threaten the state of cookery in this nation  And I doubt not by what I have heard of the Kg's goodness and sagicity  Sagacity  But that you will meet with proper encouragement from his Mjy  Who the premises considered will certainly on mature reflection  Take every man and woman of us under his protection  And if he does not find us work will have the gracious intentions  To give us something to play with by granting us all pensions  Yours to command MARY THE COOKMAID  THE BULLFINCH AND SPARROW  A FABLE  FROM THE FRENCH OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA  O greatness and its pompous train  What notions false we entertain  The glitt'ring dress the splendid feast  Those seeking most who know them least  Our time anxiety and cost  In the vain acquisition lost  Its joys and griefs to every state  Adapted by the will of fate  The man we envy oft as blest  In secret pines with care oppress'd  Of this though trite just observation  My fable is an illustration  As on the rake one winter's day  A townbred sparrow wing'd his way  Possess'd of each engaging art  To win the feather'd sair one's heart  To all his rivals still preferr'd  The fav'rite of each female bird  He lighted near an ancient seat  Whose turrets mark the squire's retreat  The mansion where renown'd in fame  Resides the guardian of the game  Or the right worshipful the mayor  Whose corporation's all his care  There hopping round from tree to tree  Curious no doubt to hear and see  A bullfinch from a window nigh  Attracted the young rover's eye  Struck with the warbler's gilded cage  He glow'd with envy grief and rage  "How partial"he exclaim'd "is fate  "See how that bullfinch lives in state  "The happiest of the feather'd race  "How diff'rent the poor sparrow's case  "He shelter'd from the winds and rain  "Still chaunts at ease his warbling strain  "While I sit shiv'ring in the shower  "Expos'd through each inclement hour  "To nipping frosts or melting snows  "Ills that no pamper'd bullfinch knows  "He cherish'd at a sumptuous board  "Is lodg'd and feasted like a lord  "Fondled and by his master fed  "With sweetest cakes and whitest bread  "While after me the village runs  "With pelting stones and popping guns  "Forc'd by such barb'rous sport to fly  "A miserable wand'rer I  "In the more hospitable wood  "Pick up and down precarious food  "Hard lot alas how diff'rent mine  "Compar'd thrice happy bird with thine  "Why cruel fate live I to rue  "I was not hatch'd a bullfinch too"  The finch in quite a wellbred way  Heard what our sparrow had to say  And understood him though at distance  Without th' interpreter's assistance  Indeed a bird not quite a fool  Brought up in so polite a school  Could not be thought in want of learning  A word's enough to the discerning  Not comprehend the vulgar folk  Poh comprehend tis all a joke  Smiling to find the aukward blunder  The foolish fellow labour'd under  He pluming up his haughty crest  The envious grumbler thus address'd  "Sure my good friend you're touch'd in brain  "To talk in this mistaken strain  "'Tis true there's something of a smattering  "Of wit in what you have been chattering  "But chirp as smartly as you will  "Trust me you reason very ill  "And to be serious for a while  "In truth your envy makes me smile  "What is there in this fine gilt cage  "So much your fancy should engage  "These wires my prison bars where I  "A splendid slave must live and die  "Go hence content and learn of me  "How vain the finery you see  "Forbear my joys tree bliss to call  "Thy liberty is worth them all"  ON THE MAN OF PARTS AND HEAD OF THE PRESS  HOW Doctor You a man of parts  Pray are you skillful in the arts  What science may you know  "I am the Head Sir of the press"  You are Indeed I thought no less  But say how came you so  Just as on ancient cupboard carv'd  The rueful phyz of wight halfstarv'd

Sonow to businessHemsi vestris placet  May't please your worshipsForgery which is grown  To such a height as ne'er before was known  I say a forgery hath been committed  By which king Pluto's mirmidons outwitted  Certain choice spirits in theatric shape  Have suffer'd from Elysium to escape  Of Shakespeare's offspring an ideal train  Sprung Pallas like from an immortal brain  Their namesI have 'em downbut to be brief  Shall only just recapitulate the chief  Imprimis with madeira swell'd and sack  There's Sir John Falstaff alias call'd Plump Jack  Next captain Pislol a notorious bully  And miss Dol Tearsheet fam'd for jilting cully  The widow Quickly vintner bawd and whore  With Bardolph Peto Nym and several more  Link'd in a gang each cutpurse with his crony  All arrant thieves and dramatis personae  Bent as suppos'd to prostitute to shame  Th' aforesaid Shakespeare's honour name and fame  I shall not trespass on your worships' time  T' explain at full the nature of their crime  But poets having an exclusive right  To bring their mental progeny to light  This right's invaded by the party 'peach'd  Who vi et armis hath th' old bard o'erreach'd  By counterfeiting of his hand do you see  Feloniously to set these vagrants free  With base design t'adopt them for his own  Tho' Shakespeare's property and his alone  Such is the fact A critic were an ass  No doubt to let such imposition pass  Nor could a cheat so palpable succeed  But that the captain of the guard cou'dn't read  Not he for laughing tho' to've sav'd his soul  The scene and circumstances were so droll  Pistol with yellow nightcap patch'd with red  With mother Quickly was retir'd to bed  And waking swore by Styx he would not come  Sans preparation pike and beat of drum  Of aquavitae having stole a flaggon  Bardolph and Nym were playing at snapdragon  Sometimes proceeding from hard words'to blows  As by mistake Nym seiz'd on Bardoph's nose  With Falstaff sat Dol Tearsheet cheek by joll  And while she buss'd his chin and scratch'd his poll  Slipp'd from his thumb his grandfire's copper ring  For love not for the value of the thing  Then stole his empty purse but no abuse  'Twas only done to keep her hand in use  He swearing he'd be damn'd as soon as trust his  Round belly more with Hall or his chief justice  But this is wandering from the pointThey're here  And on your summons ready to appear  Please to proceed then to examination  And be attentive to their information  If as your judgment cannot be erroneous  You take this forgery to be felonious  The author meaning fraud I need not mention  Your issuing warrants for his apprehension  And when you've caught and into peices tore him  Hang up his mangled carcase in terrorem  In f  agrant crimes the process should be short  The law is clearI leave it with the court  EPILOGUE TO THE SAME  MRS H ENTERS READING A CARD  THE muse of Shakespeare's compliments A card  T'excuse this evening's enterprizing bard  Great his presumption to confess the truth  But as he pleads the passion of his youth  Together with the magick of her charms  Attracting him resistless to her arms  Tho' somewhat by surprize she owns she suffer'd  Yet as no actual violence was offer'd  She's willing if the audience should agree  For this one time to set th' offender free  We women soon forgive if not forget  The crimes our beauties make the men commit  Especially when once we're past our prime  And Shakespeare's muse like me 's the worse for time  For tho' she charm with fancy ever young  Tho heav'nly musick dwell upon her tongue  Lost many an artless smile and dimple sleek  Which sat alluring on her virgin cheek  Beauties that faded on the gazer's eye  And no coldcream of comment can supply  As for what Merc'ry in the prologue told ye  Pray let not that from clemency withhold ye  That Hermes was of old a lying blade  And practic'd in imposture as his trade  The patron he or classic lore deceives  Of cheats forestallers higglers hucksters thieves  Besides to tell you a stagetrick of ours  But you'll not spread the secret out of doors  The man was no more Mercury than I am  Queen Hecuba the wife of Trojan Priam  A messenger from Phoebus He a god  I can assure you all 'twas Mr Dodd  His dropping from the clouds was all a sham  And his pretended errand but a flam  We've heathen gods of pasteboard made to fly  On hempen cords across the painted sky  Those canvass clouds that dangle there above  Inveloping the throne itself of Jove  His tale fictitious too tho' told so glib  For take it on my word 'twas all a fib  Old Falstaff in ElysiumTo my thinking  So great his natural tendency to sinking  That to the shades if he had once descended  To bring him back not Atlas had pretended  Dramatic sprites at least they tell me so  Dwell not with saints above nor devils below  But form'd th' imagination to engage  During their shortliv'd passage o'er the stage  As mere ideal characters exist  And stand as cyphers mark'd on nature's list  To genius giv'n a delegated power  To form these transient beings of an hour  Which from this mimic world whene'er they go  Are free to range in fancy's pimlico  A limbo large and broad which in the schools  Is call'd by some the paradise of fools  Ferae naturae there their preservation  Is purchas'd by no game association  The poaching plagiary alone denied  A privilege granted to each bard beside  Who tho' a cottager to try his skill  May shoot or course or hunt them down at will  In his own paddock may the strays receive  And scorn to ask a lordly owner's leave  Not but that here the author of the play  By me begs leave submissively to say  "None more than he reveres great Shakespeare's name  "Or glows with zeal to vindicate his fame"  AN EPISTLE DEDICATORY  TO THE FIRST MINISTER OF STATE FOR THE TIME BEING  PREFIX'D TO THE SECOND EDITION OF EPISTLES TO LORENZO  HAIL mighty Pam if song without offence  Thus hail the first courtcard in eminence  Thou in whom kings find oft the sov'reign sway  For kings at Loo the leading knave obey  Or if content to play an humbler game  Plain Jack we stile thee more familiar name  Thou whose sly blows the lower party feels  While bent the high to catch thy tripping heels  Great in thyself whatever thou art call'd  Nations by thee enfranchis'd or inthrall'd  Holla'd to day to Palaceyard along  Flatter'd at once in metzotint and song  Or piqu'd perhaps while chimes the present line  Ere yet turn'd out as usual to resign  Branded by th' honest satire of the times  With all a minister's mysterious crimes  To thee I pay my  till in disgrace  And then as humbly to the next in place  For know what private worth soe'er thy boast  Thy person I address not but thy post  Is there a time when statesmen good or great  Look down with pity on the toils of state  Superiour to the boast of boasted things  The pomp of titles and the smile of kings  When in the private hour of social ease  Ambition sleeps and truth itself may please  At such an hour when ev'n politeness deigns  To taste the rudeness of familiar strains  Presuming thou in honour to the muse  Indulgent once her labours mayst peruse  To thee those honest labours she commends  At court while honest doubtless finding friends  But through thy levee if forbid to press  In freedom's plain and anticourtier's dress  Light of her rhimes as of petitions made  Should they be lost forgotten or mislaid  If not so vain to think thou should'st commend  In either case permit me to defend  Too well I know imputed as a crime  The gift of reason to the man of rhime  To childish Fiction jingling numbers tied  As bells that dangle by an infant's side  To useless whims poetic worth confin'd  To please the sense but not improve the mind  Should on my daring verse then censure fall  From priest or prelate waken'd in the stall  Or should the learned jurors take in hand  To burn the books they may not understand  Scorn'd the loud torrent of the mob's abuse  With thee I leave my errour and excuse  Know then my patron once upon a time  While yet a boy I caught the itch of rhime  But born with hatred to the singsong train  Whose numbers charm like senseless notes in vain  While strange to themes t'employ the muse about  The peccant humour broke but little out  Till late in waking dreams that trouble youth  On one side Prudence urg'd on t'other Truth  Prudence a worldlyminded dame and sly  Who fix'd on earth still kept her cautious eye  While Truth whose open breast did mine inflame  Look'd up to heaven to heaven from whence she came  When now my eager heart her power confess'd  And thus her willing captive she address'd  "Art thou my friend that enterprizing youth  "Who make pretensions to the song of truth  "By reason taught to leave in early life  "The wanton mistress for the faithful wife  "Among the sciences thy partner chuse  "Philosophy's the sister of the muse"  Prudence who heard made various hems and haws  And after due deliberating pause  Shaking her head "beware rash youth" she cried  "Let Prudence here your early footsteps guide  "Art thou so ignorant as not to know  "Truth leads us oft to poverty and woe  "Let me advisewouldst thou succeed in rhime  "Mark at the proper season well thy time  "Taking this maxim as a gen'ral rule  "The knave is honest till he plays the fool  "For times there are of such malignant face  "That sharpers only rise to power and place  "Times when the mere huzza for publick good  "Breaks down all ranks of honour and of blood  "When sacred characters like bawds are us'd  "And princes with impunity abus'd  "The throne of majesty a vulgar thing  "While George the cobler damns great George the king  "In times like these behold on every side  "What pains we take offensive Truth to hide  "Asham'd to shew her bashful face at court  "See her simplicity but made its sport  "Her lovers stigmatiz'd by gen'ral hate  "As bold disturbers of the church and state  "Would'st thou to this abandon'd tribe belong  "What bard e'er heeded yet the truth of song  "Again 'tis certain there may come a time  "When Impudence finds no excuse in rhime  "When even Prudence may herself be just  "Her int'rest more to keep than break her trust  "When crowns are honour'd and in proper season  "S dread patriot may be hang'd for treason  "A time perhaps years work the strangest things  "When the brave Scots may love their best of kings  "When slighted science may approach the throne  "And Britons make true policy their own  "What tho their patriot hearts are known to fail  "When dearth of barley threatens want of ale  "What tho religion arm'd by commonsense  "Breaks but its weapons in its own defence  "Ev'n yet may piety be kept alive  "And halfexpiring patriotism revive  "At such a season should the muse inspire  "If touch'd with caution thou mayst strike the lyre  "Perhaps uncensur'd but to look for praise  "Know these young bard are no poetic days  "But should the age as probably it may  "Turn its loose politicks another way  "While in religious mood far push'd the schemes  "Of true born Britons always in extremes  "The times may yet return when frantic zeal  "Shall give its wooden sword an edge of steel  "When convocation  shall in judgment sit  "To canvass th' infidelity of wit  "On wicked Knowledge Britain's guilt to lay  "And drive the destin'd victim far away  "If thus blind Ignorance should rule in turn  "Bards loose their ears and martyr theists burn  "Ready reforming constables at hand  "Of scientific vice to cleanse the land  "Have thou with truth nor morals ought to do  "Things are not always fit that may be true"  Here Prudence endedher advice was good  But Truth has charms that cannot be withstood  Hers then the musehow far success will show  In times like ours her song be apropos  So much indeed of Prudence did I learn  My fingers ne'er in politicks to burn  Silent I sat amidst the party rout  When late the ministry turn'd in and out  When rag'd the furious goosequills of the times  To shame their country with their shameless rhimes  Careless what turtleeating son of White's  Might set the blunders of the state to rights  If Pollio Gallus Tully or his grace  Should all keep out or who get into place  I car'd not I tho these or none of these  The king the house or mightier mob might please  Blam'd I the peer whom adverse winds had blown  Round the wide world to prop a monarch's throne  Taught in the hurricanes of southern seas  The statesman's wisdom and the courtier's case  By plunder'd Spaniards the consummate skill  To steer a kingdom like a bark at will  Tho made too plain the leeway of the realm  Did I presume to bid him mind the helm  Nay when the guardian genii of the land  To save our desp'rate fortunes took in hand  I sung them not tho crown'd by half the nation  With civic wreaths from town and corporation  I ne'er officious crack'd my brains t'amend  Errours the great alone might comprehend  Plagu'd with no songs of praise our lord the king  Nor gave one faggot to the blaze of Byng  But free from panegyrick as abuse  Put all my little wit to private use  Thus far of temp'ral politics I'm clear  Nor has the spiritual had more to fear  Since gospel witnesses in form were tried  Their valid evidence I ne'er denied  Ne'er intermeddled with the jury's quest  Nor contradicted Littleton or West  When church and state learn'd Warburton would join  Tho sad th' affair I made it none of mine  Nor did I e'er 'gainst Leland's pen presume  To vindicate Lord Bolingbroke or Hume  Made no pretence to freedom of debate  Nor risk'd like harmless Annet Woolston's fate  And tho for once in this a trick of youth  Prudential views are sacrific'd to truth  Could I shake off those vices rhime and sense  My first might likely prove my last offence  Or in thy cause enlisted once my pen  I never more might trouble Truth again  But to thy purpose turn my ready hand  True to the law and gospel of the land  THE END
