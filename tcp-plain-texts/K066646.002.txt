years before the Christian aera having written a book  De Viribus Herbarum  is not worth a comment  Fingal  is said to  have been well acquainted with the virtues of herbs and  Temory  healed the wounds of his countrymen by his skill in vulnerary vegetables  Alan  OGILBY who flourished about a native of  Scotland  after having travelled through the east and resided some time at  Constantinople  fixed at  Venice  Besides his eminent acquaintance with the oriental languages he is celebrated for his knowledge of natural history He left a book  De Balneis  and six books  De Virtutibus Herbarum  Of Dr  James  CARGILL of  Aberdeen  I can produce no material anecdotes although he merits particular remembrance since it is manifest from the nature of his communications to his friends both on the continent and at home that he must have been extremely well acquainted with the botany of the age There is sufficient evidence that he had studied botany and anatomy at  Basil  during the time that  Caspar  BAUHINE held the professorship in those sciences for whom a chair was first erected in that city in This celebrated professor enumerates Dr CARGILL among those who  transmitted seeds and specimens to him GESNER records the same services on his part At home LOBEL in his "  Adversaria  " acknowledges the like communications and repeatedly speaks of him in very respectable terms as a philosopher and as well skilled in the sciences of botany and anatomy He appears to have been living in the year at which time he sent to  Caspar  BAUHINE specimens of the  Fucus digitatus  with the description which is seen in the "  Prodromus  " of that author I know not of any publication from Dr CARGILL neither am I acquainted with any successful efforts in the way of natural history before the time of the BALFOURS  The founding of the Botanical Garden and the  Museum  at  Edinburgh  by Sir  Andrew  BALFOUR may be considered as the introduction of natural history into  Scotland  Sir  Robert  SIBBALD the friend and colleague of Sir  Andrew  BALFOUR and who himself added to the stores of the  Museum  has written "  Memoria Balfouriana  " purposely to commemorate the liberal benefactions and encouragements given to  literature by Sir  Jacob  and Sir  Andrew  BALFOUR  The Garden was established about the year and in was so successfully cultivated by  James  SUTHERLAND theintendant that it is said to have contained species of plants disposed according to MORISON's method An account of it was published under the title of "HORTUS MEDICUS EDINBURGENSIS or a Catalogue of the Plants in the Physic Garden at  Edinburgh  containing their most proper  Latin  and  English  names" By  James  SUTHERLAND  o  pp Varieties however occupy a large share of this Catalogue and very few of the native plants of  Scotland  are found in it It was to Sir  Robert  SIBBALD that the first attempts towards indigenous botany were owing  Robert  SIBBALD was a fellow of the College of Physicians at  Edinburgh  and the first medical professor instituted in that university about the year He was knighted by  Charles  II and had also the title of king's physician and geographer  royal conferred upon him and was a man of very considerable and various learning To the knowledge of his profession he added that of natural history and antiquities He was if not the first among the earliest who wrote on the antiquities of his country on which he published several learned works to illustrate more especially the history of  Scotland  during the time of the  Romans  He published "SCOTIA ILLUSTRATA  sive  PRODROMUS HISTORIAE NATURALIS SCOTIAE  in quo regionis natura incolarum ingenia et mores morbi iisque medendi methodus et medicina indigena explicantur et multiplices naturae partus in triplici ejus regno vegetabili scilicet animali et minerali explicantur  " folio and folio  In this volume which he tells us was the work of twenty years one part is appropriated to the indigenous plants of  Scotland  it contains observations on the medicinal and oeconomical uses A few rare species make their first appearance in this book particularly that which LINNAEUS named  Sibbaldia  after the author and the  Ligusticum Scoticum  Dr SIBBALD having thrown out some strictures on the mathematical principles of physic for which the learned Dr PITCAIRN was a strenuous advocate the latter wrote a severe satire on this work under the title "  De Legibus Historiae Naturalis  " Edin But it contains nothing solid and was thought by some to have been the result of party if not personal dislike  Among the "  Miscellanea quaedam eruditae Antiquitatis  " of Sir  Robert  published in there is a Dissertation on the  Chara  of CAESAR  De Bello Civili  lib iii §  mentioned also by DIO on which the soldiers of  Valerius  's army subsisted under a penury of bread This root has been by some supposed to be the  Karemile  Carmele or as Mr LIGHTFOOT calls it the  Corr  or  Cormeille  See PENNANT's Tour in Scotland vol i Appendix  of the  Highlanders  It is the  Orobus tuberosus Linnaei  our Wood Pease  In his "History of the Sheriffdom of  Fife  and  Kinross  " printed the same year is a catalogue of plants chiefly maritime  growing about the  Frith of Forth  among which he had given to one the name of  Balforiana  now called  Pulmonaria maritima  In the zoological way Dr SIBBALD published separately "  Phalainologia nova  "  o  or "Observations on some Animals of the Whale Genus lately thrown on the Shores of  Scotland  " This tract had merit enough to entitle it to a republication so lately as in the year He meditated a  Caetologia  together with the history of the other marine animals of  Scotland  in his second volume of the "  Prodromus  "  In the year he communicated to the Royal Society an accurate description accompanied with a figure of the animal and its shell named  Balanus Balenae  or  Pediculus Ceti  of BOCCONE  Lepas Diadema  of LINNAEUS  Syst  These were published in vol xxv of the  Philosophical Transactions  p  Although Sir  Robert  SIBBALD did not carry his researches so far as to rank high in the character of the naturalist yet as  having led the way in that branch and singularly promoted the study of the antiquities of his country he is justly entitled to that honourable station he bears among the writers of  NorthBritain  His name was applied by LINNAEUS in the  Flora Laponica  to a small plant of the  Pentandrous  class which was known to  Caspar  BAUHINE and others and considered by them as allied to the  Fragariae  and the  Pentaphylla  It was first figured by SIBBALD in his "  Prodromus  " being found in  Britain  only on the  Highland  mountains    WALLACE  In the year was published "An Account of the Islands of  Orkney  " by  James  WALLACE MD FRS which contains a catalogue of some of the indigenous plants of that northern region  Flora  is not exuberant in her gifts in the chilling regions of the north I have not seen this book but I read that the  arborescent  and some other tribes particularly the  malvaceous  are sparingly seen in these islands  PRESTON  I know not whether there was any superintendant to the Garden of  Edinburgh  between  SUTHERLAND and  George  PRESTON whom BLAIR stiles an indefatigable botanist and who published about the year the following Catalogue written in  Latin  and  English  "  Catalogus omnium Plantarum quas in Seminario Medicinae dict  transtulit Georgius  PRESTONUS  Bot Prof et Hort Edinburg Praefectus ex Auctoritate ejus  "  o  Not having seen this volume I can give no account of it A writer of the same name occurs though I know not whether the same person as a correspondent of Mr RAY See his Letters p "Some Observations on Mr RAY's  Synopsis  " by Dr PRESTON tending to illustrate the characters of about fifteen species of  English  plants with some Strictures on TOURNEFORT's method of classification  In the year Mr  Charles  ALSTON succeeded PRESTON as superintendant of the Garden  ALSTON  Charles  ALSTON as we are informed by Dr HOPE was the son of Mr  Alston  of  Eddlewood  a gentleman of small estate in the west of  Scotland  and allied to the noble family of  Hamilton  who after having studied physic and travelled with several gentlemen declined the practice of his profession and retired to his patrimony His son  Charles  was born in the year and at the time of his father's death was at  Glasgow  applying with great assiduity to his studies On this event the Duchess of  Hamilton  took him under her patronage and wished him to have chosen the department of the law but his inclination for botany and the study of physic superseded all other schemes and from the year he entirely devoted himself to physic  At the age of thirtythree he went over to  Leyden  to study under BOERHAAVE where he remained near three years At that place he contracted an intimacy with the late celebrated Dr  Alexander  MONRO and with him on their return to  Edinburgh  projected the revival of medical lectures where but little had been done in that department since the first establishment of the medical professorships in  under Sir  Robert  SIBBALD and Dr PITCAIRN The plan was modelled by that of  Leyden  MONRO was appointed to give lectures in anatomy and surgery and ALSTON in botany and the  materia medica  RUTHERFORD SINCLAIR and PLUMMER were soon after appointed to fill up the other departments and to the spirited endeavours of these celebrated names the university of  Edinburgh  owes the rise of that reputation which has since so deservedly raised it to be one of the first schools of physic in  Europe  Dr ALSTON continued to teach botany and the  materia medica  with unwearied assiduity until the time of his death which took place Nov in the th year of his age  In Dr ALSTON published for the use of his pupils "INDEX PLANTARUM  praecipue  OFFICINALIUM  quae in Horto Medico Edinburgensi Studiosis demonstrantur  "  o    In "INDEX MEDICAMENTORUM SIMPLICIUM TRIPLEX"  o  pp  Alphabetical  the officinal names with numerous synonyms from the best botanical  cal writers pp  Officinal  names only fossils vegetables animals in the order of his lectures  Classification  of the officinal names according to the virtues beginning with the absorbents and ending with vulneraries A table of the doses of emetics and purgatives  In botany Dr ALSTON's chief performance was his "  Tirocinium Botanicum Edinburgense  "  o  It contains a republication of his "  Index  " first printed in to which he now added the "  Fundamenta Botanica  " of LINNAEUS But the bulk of the work is a professed attempt to explode the system of the  Swede  and particularly to invalidate all his arguments for the  sex  of plants This part of it was translated by himself and published the next year in the first volume of "Essays and Observations physical and literary"  o  Could the doctrine of the  sexes  of plants have been easily shaken the learning and abilities of ALSTON were sufficient to have effected his purpose But as it was not at that time supported by hypothesis alone so it has since gained additional strength by new  experiments and sound inductions resulting from them Nurtured from his early years in the systems of TOURNEFORT RAY and BOERHAAVE to the first of which he had even given improvement it is not strange that at an advanced age Dr ALSTON rejected a system of so much novelty as that of LINNAEUS presented We do not willingly unlearn at sixty what has been cherished from our earliest youth  Dr ALSTON's medical papers are "A Dissertation on  Tin  as an Anthelmintic" "A Dissertation on  Opium  " and "A Case of extravasated Blood in the  Pericardium  " These are printed in the  Edinburgh Medical Essays  In he discovered a property in quick lime which led him to believe that the power of lime was not exhausted by repeated affusions of water to the same lime he adds even for twenty or thirty times The first notices of this paradox as he then called it were communicated to the  Royal Society  and were printed in the fortyseventh  volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  This opinion was contested and drew him into a controversy with his friend and colleague Dr WHYTT Having continued his experiments and enlarged his observations he published in  his "Dissertation on QuickLime and Limo Water" republished in and in in which he replies to Dr WHYTT's Strictures and after enumerating a variety of diseases in which lime water has proved efficacious confirms the opinion of his colleague relating to its lithontriptic powers  Dr ALSTON's Lectures on the  Materia Medica  were prepared for the press before his decease and were published under the following title  "Lectures on the  Materia Medica  containing the Natural History of Drugs their Virtues and Doses also Directions for the Study of the  Materia Medica  and an Appendix on the Method of Prescribing Published from the Manuscript of the late Dr  Charles  ALSTON Professor  of Botany and the  Materia Medica  in the University of  Edinburgh  By  John  HOPE MD Professor of Medicine and Botany in that University" In two vol  o  pp and  The first eleven lectures consist of preliminary discourses on the rise and progress of this knowledge on the operation of medicines of errors concerning the  materia medica  on classing simples according to their virtues and some account of authors who have written on simples  In treating on each subject after reciting the officinal name and the principal  synonyma  the description and place of growth Dr ALSTON gives in his own words the sensible qualities powers and uses of each simple after which follows in the words of the authors themselves a copious detail of the opinions of respectable writers relating to each concluding with a recital of all the officinal compounds into which each simple enters Add to this the reader will meet with a variety of collateral and historical information which is highly gratifying  to all such as wish to extend their enquiries beyond the mere nomenclature and quality of each substance and which could otherwise be acquired only from laborious researches  Although the reader will not find the author giving implicit belief to the manifold and vaunted powers attributed to numberless simples through almost all preceding writers but on the contrary will meet with judicious doubts observations and experiments yet Dr ALSTON's  Materia Medica  must be considered on the whole as exhibiting rather the state of it as it has been than as it is in the works of LEWIS BERGIUS MURRAY and CULLEN It is but of late that philosophers and physicians have exercised that degree of scepticism on the power of tmedicines which must ever influence the mind when experiments alone form the foundation of medical practice  Were it within my plan to extend my observations I should with grateful pleasure expatiate on the improved state of  botany at  Edinburgh  after this period when the zeal and abilities of my muchhonoured and respected friend the late Dr  John  HOPE assisted by the royal bounty enabled him to raise the study of botany to an eminence unrivalled unless at  Upsal  by any university in  Europe  CHAP  Plukenet  Short memoirs ofA learned critical and laborious botanistHis  PhytographiaAlmagestum  and  Mantissa  His  Amaltheum  His works had great meritContain near figures  Plukenet  unmindful of generical charactersHis strictures on  Sloane  His works reprinted in  Dr  Uvedale  of  Enfield  PLUKENET  IT has been the fate of many learned men who have deserved highly of the republic of letters to have the private circumstances and occurrences of their lives in a few years so far involved in obscurity that almost their immediate posterity howsoever desirous of gratifying a natural and laudable curiosity and of rendering to their memory that tribute which their services have demanded have been almost wholly frustrated in their endeavours to rescue them from oblivion  If I mistake not the truth of this position is strongly exemplified in the person of whom in the order of time I am next to speak Of Dr  Leonard  PLUKENET as far as I can find there are scarcely any memorials but what are to be collected from the prefaces of his works and they afford indeed very scanty information He has told us that he was born in but whether he was of  English  origin and of what family does not certainly appear though it has been conjectured that he was of  French  extraction Where he received his scholastic education or at what place he took degrees in physic I am not able to ascertain Some light would be thrown on this circumstance indeed by determining where his two friends  William  COURTEN Esq and the Rev Dr UVEDALE of  Enfield  were educated since he speaks of both these gentlemen as having been his fellowpupils probably it was at  Cambridge  as he had a son named  Richard  pursuing his studies in that university at the publication of his  Almagestum  in Be that as it may his writings sufficiently testify his extensive  knowledge of the learned languages He dates the prefaces to his works from Old Palace Yard  Westminster  where from a circumstance mentioned in his  Phytographia  it may be inferred that he had a small garden I know not that he ever attained to any considerable eminence as a practical physician The contrary may rather be presumed as I do not find his name in several lists of the College of Physicians printed in the first years of this century neither in those of the  Royal Society  at the same period  His ardour for his favourite pursuit was remarkably strong  Ut pene nullus sic ardeo  was his motto It does not appear that he ever had an opportunity of gratifying his taste by travelling in search of plants He seems to have devoted all his leisure to his work of the  Phytographia  sparing no pains to procure specimens of rare and new plants He had correspondents in all parts of the world and had access to the gardens of the curious in the environs of  London  and to that at  Hampton Court  which was in a flourishing state from the care which the  king and queen bestowed on it The Earl of  Portland  also had so much relish for exotics as to have repeatedly sent  Jacob  REEDE to the  West Indies  to collect curious productions for the Royal Garden PLUKENET was one of those to whom Mr RAY was indebted for assistance in the arrangement of the second volume of his History and that eminent man every where bears the strongest testimony to his merit Nevertheless PLUKENET wanted that patronage to which his learning and science entitled him and he seems by his complaints to have severely felt it In the latter part of his life he appears to have been at variance with SLOANE and PETIVER two of the first characters of the age for knowledge in his own studies He censures their writings it must be confessed in a stile of too much asperity Whether this alienation from those of whom he had before spoken in terms of friendship and respect had its origin in jealousy on the one hand or what is more probable on the other in that indignant loftiness which too often accompanies the consciousness of  neglected merit or whether from other sources I cannot determine It was however probably unfavourable to PLUKENET since SLOANE was at that time rising fast into reputation and influence In the mean while no obstacles damped the zeal of PLUKENET he was himself at the expence of his engravings and printed the work at his own charge until the publication of the last part his  Amaltheum  when he procured a trifling subscription from a few of the nobility amounting to about fiftyfive guineas Towards the close of his life he is said to have been assisted by the queen and to have obtained the superintendency of the garden at  Hampton Court  and was honoured with the title of Royal Professor of Botany  I cannot discover the exact time of his decease but it is probable he did not long survive his last publication in  There is a copperplate print of Dr PLUKENET done in the th year of his age prefixed to the  Phytographia  with his arms field ermine bearing a bend dexter engrailed gules  PLUKENET had all that enthusiasm without which few attain preeminence and as the riches of  Flora  were daily pouring into  Britain  from all quarters of the globe he failed not to avail himself of every opportunity of adding to his stores Indigenous subjects were equally with exotics the objects of this industrious and learned collector Hence at length his  Herbarium  consisted of eight thousand plants an astonishing number for a private unopulent individual to collect Of these the  Phytographia  is to be considered as the delineation of the new and rare kinds and the  Almagestum Mantissa  and  Amaltheum  as the catalogue of the whole  The  Phytographia  was published at different times The first part under the following title  "PHYTOGRAPHIA  sive  STIRPIUM ILLUSTRIORUM  et  MINUS COGNITORUM ICONES"         o    tab    Pars  II      o    tab    Pars  III      o    tab    Pars  IV      o    tab    These four parts which constitute the first  volume of his works consist entirely of figures  In the same year with the fourth part of the  Phytographia  came out  "ALMAGESTUM BOTANICUM  sive Phytographiae Plukenetianae Onomasticon Methodo Syntheticâ digestum exhibens Stirpium exoticarum rariorum novarumque Nomina quae Descriptionis Locum supplere possint  "  o  pp  PLUKENET follows no system the Catalogue is alphabetical and contains near species of which he tells us were new Synonyms are added to each and references made to those figured in the  Phytographia  No man after  Caspar  BAUHINE had till then examined the antient authors with so much attention as PLUKENET in order to settle the synonyms with truth and many critical notes interspersed prove his intimate acquaintance with all the resources of botanical literature  Not solicitous to form new  genera  he refers from the conformity of  habit  in almost all instances his new plants to the  genera  of former authors and more anxious  concerning the  species  he has described them with an accuracy that has been applauded Not that PLUKENET was una quainted with  system  as is manifest from one of his criticisms on SLOANE in the  Mantissa  p and from his Observations on the first edition of Mr RAY's  Synopsis  published in the Collection of RAY's Letters p  Four years after the publication of the PHYTOGRAPHIA came out with a continuation of the plates "ALMAGESTI BOTANICI MANTISSA  Plantarum novissime delectarum ultra Millenarium Numerum complectens  "  o  pp tab Besides many new plants this volume contains very numerous additions to the synonyms of the  Almagesium  Many curious critical observations on some of the plants of the ancient authors occur in this volume which evince the depth of his knowledge and the extreme pains he took in the investigation of his subjects  See his Observations on the  Cedrus  p on the  Juniper  of the Hebrews p on the  Kinsa  of the Chinese or the  Poco sempie  p on the  Myrobalans  p on the  Ginsong  p c c  A very copious index to both volumes concludes the work  It is in the  Mantissa  we first meet with strictures on SLOANE and PETIVER He censures PETIVER especially with a degree of satyrical acrimony for errors in the application of synomyms in his  Centuriae  and SLOANE for the like mistakes in his "Catalogue of  Jamaica  plants" accusing the latter of having also applied his synonyms from the  Phytographia  without acknowledgments or any reference  Hinc illae lachrymae  Five years after the MANTISSA he published his last work "The AMALTHEUM BOTANICUM  s Stirpium Indicarum alterum Copiae Cornu Millenas ad minimam et bis Centum diversas Species novas et indictas nominatim comprehendens quarum sexcenae et insuper selectis Iconibus aeneisque Tabulis illustrantur  "  o  pp tab Some of the tables of this volume belong to the plants of the  Mantissa  It abounds with new subjects sent from  China  and the  East Indies  by Mr CUNNINGHAM and Mr BROWN and with some from  Florida  PLUKENET's work contains upwards of figures Most of them were engraved from dried specimens and many from small sprigs destitute of flowers or any parts of fructification and consequently not to be ascertained several of these nevertheless as better specimens came to hand are figured a second time in the subsequent plates As he employed a variety of artists they are very unequally done those by  Vander Gucht  have usually the preference The imperfections of this work however are in a great degree those of the times yet it cannot but be regretted that PLUKENET had it not in his power to have given his figures on a larger scale There are unquestionably many varieties exhibited as real species and one great defect runs nearly through the whole work that the new plants are no further described than by the specifical definitions which under the want of true generical characters were then insufficient  It is notwithstanding a large magazine of botanical stores inasmuch as no work before published by one man ever exhibited so great a number of new plants And as  many of the  English  species are here figured for the first time it has been equally acceptable to the lovers of indigenous as of exotic botany  LINNAEUS and others mention a new edition of PLUKENET's works in But this was nothing more than the usual artifice of the bookseller who having purchased the remaining copies placed a new titlepage They were however reprinted and divided into four volumes in with the addition of a few plates that were wanting in some copies of the fourth part of the  Phyiographia  Those who occasionally consult this author will regret that this opportunity had not been taken of inserting the additions from the  Mantissa  into the  Almagestum  by introducing them in a smaller character and placing the pages for both in the margin The  Herbarium  of PLUKENET came into Sir  Hans  SLOANE's possession and is now in the  British Museum  In an  Index Linnaeanus  to the tables was published by Dr GISEKE professor of poetry and natural philosophy in the  Gymnasium  of  Hamburgh  which contains a few notes from a MS left by PLUKENET  Father PLUMIER complimented this learned botanist by calling after his name a climbing ivyleaved plant of the  Monoecious  class with a  Monadelpheus  flower described only by himself and by RUMPHIUS being a native of both Indies    Dr PLUKENET has not failed to record the names of a numerous set of benefactors by whose communications he was from time to time enabled to amplify his collection and introduce many new plants to the knowledge of the curious Among several others we find repeatedly the names of PETIVER COURTEN SHERARD DU BOIS Bishop COMPTON Dr  Tancred  ROBINSON Dr SLOANE CUNNINGHAM and UVEDALE Some of these I shall have occasion to commemorate in separate articles but I regret that I cannot collect any material anecdotes relating to his friend and fellow collegian UVEDALE LLD of whom PLUKENET ever speaks in a stile which indicates that he held him in great esteem  UVEDALE  Dr UVEDALE lived at  Enfield  where he cultivated a garden which appears to have been rich in exotic productions And although he is not known among those who advanced the indigenous botany of  Britain  yet his merit as a botanist or his patronage of the science at large was considerable enough to incline PETIVER to apply his name to a new plant which MILLER retained in his Dictionary but which has since passed into the genus  Polymnia  of the  Linnaean  system the author of which has nevertheless retained  Uvedalia  as the trivial epithet  CHAP  Petiver  Anecdotes ofSuccessful in collecting a museum of natural curiositiesHis works  CenturiaeGazophylaciumMiddlesex  plants  Plantae ChinensesSwitzerland  plants  PterigraphiaEnglish Herbal  Various other listsand papers in the  Philosophical Transactions  PETIVER  CONTEMPORARY with PLUKENET lived Mr  James  PETIVER of whom too little intelligence is remaining  It appears that he was apprenticed to Mr  Feltham  apothecary to  St Bartholomew's Hospital  He entered into business for himself in  Aldersgate Street  where he lived the remainder of his days He became apothecary to the  Charter House  and obtained a considerable share of practice in his profession  He had an early propensity to these studies and excepting Mr COURTEN and Dr SLOANE seems to have been the  only  one after  the TRADESCANTS who made any considerable collection in natural history PETIVER engaged the captains and surgeons of ships to bring home specimens and seeds of plants birds stuffed animals and insects and he directed their choice and enabled them to judge in some measure of proper objects by distributing printed lists and directions among them He was not less anxious to procure what his native country afforded and was so successful in his efforts that Sir  Hans  SLOANE who afterwards purchased it offered PETIVER four thousand pounds for his  Museum  some time before his death which offer although it may be considered as a proof of the opulence of Sir  Hans  is equally so of the extent of the collection  The allurement of such uncommon curiosities as Mr PETIVER exhibited soon obtained him considerable distinction and his name became well known both at home and abroad He was elected into the  Royal Society  and as his particular attachment was to plants he became early the correspondent of Mr RAY who acknowledges  his assistance in arranging the second volume of his "History of Plants" and elsewhere owns his high obligations to him for the extent and freedom of his communications  In the year preparatory to the publication of his first work PETIVER took a tour into the midland counties of England I recollect on this occasion the pleasure I had in my youth in seeing the  Lichen jubatus  growing on the spot where I believe he first discovered it on the highest rocks in  Charley Forest Leicestershire  Mr PETIVER's first publication was "MUSEI PETIVERIANI  Centuriae decem  "  o  Containing the names and synonyms of various rare animals fossils and plants among which several curious articles the produce of  England  are here first exhibited particularly some of the  Cryptogamous  class in the investigation of which he was very successful  "GAZOPHYLACII NATURAE  et  ARTIS  Decades decem  " tab fol A book of great value at the time of its publication being the engravings accompanied with  short descriptions of animals of all the orders vegetables and fossils among these are many  American  ferns plants of the  Alps  and from the  Cape of Good Hope  all either very rarely seen before or nondescripts It will retain its value while LINNAEUS's writings are in use  Among the provincial lists of plants printed in Bishop GIBSON's edition of CAMDEN in Mr PETIVER communicated the  Middlesex  plants All the others were drawn up by Mr RAY as was observed under his article  Next to the  Gazophylacium  in the order of time although not a distinct work was published in Mr RAY's third volume of his History of Plants "PLANTAE RARIORES CHINENSES MADRASPATANAE  et  AFRICANAE  à Jacobo  PETIVERO  ad Opus consummandum collatae cum ejusdem Catalogo Plantarum in Hortis suis siccis conservatarum quae vel ineditae aut hactenus obscurè descriptae sunt adjicitur Farrago Stirpium Indicarum et Americanarum incertae Sedis  "  The first of these catalogues amounts to plants those of the  Hortus siccus  to  more than species the last to Although doubtless great numbers of these must have been varieties only these lists will yet remain a lasting testimony of the early and extreme diligence of this indefatigable collector  In he published without his name "A Catalogue of Plants found on the mountains about  Geneva  the  Jura La Dole Saleve  with others growing in the fields c as observed by GESNER the BAUHINES CHABRAEUS and RAY"  "PTERIGRAPHIA AMERICANA ICONES  continens plusquam CCCC Filicum variarum Specierum  " Tab fol The ferns occupy sixteen of these tables Among these are contained most of

plants as well as of other natural productions some of which he figured in the  Gazophylacium  but he meditated and in part executed a work that had not been attempted  before a set of distinct figures of  British  plants Unfortunately he lived not to finish it  This work which distinguishes PETIVER as an auxiliary to  English  botany bears the title of "A Catalogue of Mr RAY's  English Herbal  illustrated with Figures" fol t and continued "with the fourleaved flowers" t fol Twelve plants are engraved on each plate The work ends with the seventeenth class The figures are little more than outlines but they are neat and though they have the defect of the old herbals in being all on a similar scale were valuable and especially as pointing out many of the varieties in the  Synopsis

early period of the  Royal Society  when the study of nature was in its infancy could not fail to convey much information and excite a curiosity to pursue with zeal one of the chief ends of the

which grows on the island  Cobross  in the Red Sea If this be the origin of the true or oriental kind there is likewise a  Styrax liquida  from the  Liquidambar  tree of  Virginia  What is generally met with now is justly suspected to be a mixed artificial composition  In N  o  Mr PETIVER published under the title of  Botanicum hortense  an Account of divers rare plants observed in several

PLUMIER in giving personal names to new  genera  PETIVER is however severely reprehended by LINNAEUS for having conferred this honour on some who did not merit it He observes justly that it is due to such alone as have signalized themselves in the science I take this opportunity to remark the rise  and progress of this eustom which appears to be of high antiquity since there are examples of it among the antient poets historians and physicians  Poetry has consecrated in this way the names of  Adonis Daphne Hyacinthus Narcissus  and others PLINY informs us that  Eupatorium  is said to be the cognomen of MITHRIDATES who first discovered the uses of that plant  Gentiana  we are told is derived from GENTIUS king of  Illyria Lysimachia  from LYSIMACHUS king of  Sicily Telephium  from TELEPHUS king of  Mysia Teucrium  from TEUCER king of  Troy Clymenum  from CLYMENUS  Artemisia  from the wife of king MAUSOLUS  Helenium  from HELENA the wife of  Menelaus Euphorbium  from EUPHORBUS physician to  Juba  II king of  Mauritania  though SALMASIUS avers that this name had been in use at a much earlier period Many other instances might be adduced  In succeeding ages the devotion of the monks led them to consecrate a variety of plants to the saints of the kalendar Thus we have the  Herba Sancti  ANTONII  Epilobium S  CHRISTOPHORI  Actaea S  GERARDI  Aegopodium S  RUPERTI  Geranium S  JACOBI  Senecio S  PETRI  Parietaria  c c  John  BAUHINE wrote a treatise in now become very scarce "  De Plantis à Divis Sanctisve Nomen habentibus  "  The restorers of botany in a few instances revived the practice GESNER had he lived to finish his plan in his "History of Plants" intended to have perpetuated the names of his friends by monuments of this kind It appears that he had requested GUILANDINUS  John  BAUHINE KENTMAN CAMERARIUS and our celebrated countryman Dr CAIUS to select from his new species such as they chose to bear their names or allow to him the privilege of adopting what he thought most congruous By the same kind of tribute we learn from his letters that he proposed to record the names of his friends GASSERUS OCCO ARETIUS and several others  MATTHIOLUS however actually restored the usage by the application of the term  Cortusa  to a new plant in honour of  CORTUSUS the successor of GUILANDINUS in the garden of  Padua  and CLUSIUS followed his example by calling the  Contrayerva  of the shops  Drakaena  in honour of Sir  Francis  DRAKE from which time it was sparingly practised until after the invention of system and the construction of generical characters at the latter end of the last century TOURNEFORT PLUMIER and PETIVER led the way and have been followed by all succeeding writers of note and by none more than by LINNAEUS himself It may be stiled the  apotheosis  of botanists and LINNAEUS may be compared to the high priest who has thus immortalized a numerous group of celebrated men  The practice however was severely censured by some of the older botanists who objected that these names having no connection with the form nature habit or properties of the plant conveyed no idea of distinction But the objection if duly weighed is of no force since there is not perhaps a single appellation even among the best of  Greek  etymology however aptly  framed which conveys any character of the genus that might not with equal propriety have been applied to a multitude of others  The free use that PLUMIER made of this privilege in honouring so great a number of Englishmen does equal credit to his own discernment and impartiality and to the merit of those on whom he bestowed this laurel On this account I hope it may not be ungrateful to the reader to digress so far as to introduce a short notice of this liberalminded foreigner  PLUMIER  Charles  PLUMIER was born at  Marseilles  in the year and after a classical education devoted himself to a religious life and at the age of sixteen entered into the order of the  Minime Friars  Being early inclined to mechanics and philosophy he studied mathematics at  Toulouse  under  Pére Maignan  a celebrated professor of the science and of the same order In some of his leisure hours he amused himself in the practice of Turning having been taught theart by his father and became so great  a proficient that he wrote a book on the subject Under  Pére Maignan  he also learned to make lenses mirrors microscopes and other instruments of philosophy and early acquired the arts of designing and painting He was soon after sent by his superiors to  Rome  where his close application to his studies and to these arts together with optics and mathematics deranged his health In this situation he sought for relaxation in the study of botany under the lectures of  Pére  SERGEANT in a convent at  Rome  and in the instructions of  Francis de  ONUPHRIIS an Italian physician and of  Sylvius  BOCCONE a Sicilian By these connections he was insensibly led to devote himself to his new study Being recalled by his order into  Provence  he was placed in a convent near  Hyeres  and obtained leave of his superiors to search the coasts of that country and the neighbouring Alps for plants At this time he conceived a design of forming a new  Pinax  or "General History of Vegetables" for which he had made many drawings and collected materials but his subsequent destination  prevented his making an effectual progress in this design He soon after became acquainted with TOURNEFORT then on his botanical tour in the South of  France  and together with GARIDEL professor of botany at  Aix  accompanied that eminent man in his researches  Thus qualified and while he was herborizing on the coast of  Marseilles  he was chosen as the associate of SURIAN to explore the French settlements in the West Indies The French were stimulated to this expedition by the success of our great naturalist SLOANE in  Jamaica  PLUMIER acquitted himself so well that he was twice sent afterwards at the King's expence to compleat the natural history of the  Antilles  and was rewarded with the title of Botanist to the King and an increased pension each time He passed two years in those islands and on the neighbouring continent but made  Domingo  his principal residence He made designs and paintings of many hundred plants on a scale as large as the life besides numerous figures of birds fishes and insects  On his return from his second voyage by the interest of M PONTCHARTRAIN he procured the first specimen of his labours to be published at the  Louvre  under the title of "  Description des Plantes de l' Amerique  " Fol pp tab The first fifty of these tables represent Ferns the remainder divers species of the  Arum  genus the  Piper Passiflorae Rajania Dolichos  and various others The figures consist of little more than outlines but being as large as the life and drawn with great accuracy and freedom they have a very fine effect The descriptions are in French  On his return from the third voyage he settled at  Paris  in the character of his order and in published his "  Nova Plantarum Genera  "  o  In this work which is constructed on the plan of TOURNEFORT's "Institutions of Botany" the author describes and figures the characters of new  genera  among which are many of the plants used in medicine It is in this book he pays the tribute so often specified not only to the manes of deceased botanists but to several eminent men then  living he has in this way given appellations to more than fifty  genera  taken from the names of botanists  In the course of these pages those generical terms which have been formed from the names of  English  botanists of renown thus celebrated by  Father  PLUMIER are mentioned under their respective articles but I here collect them into one view  Gerardia  Lobelia  Morisonia  Parkinsonia  Petiveria  Plukenetia  Rajania  Sloanea  Turnera  In the year he was prevailed on by M FAGON to undertake a voyage to  Peru  to discover and delineate the  Peruvian Bark  tree Nothing but the greatest zeal for science could induce a man at the age of fiftyeight to attempt so perilous a voyage While he was waiting for the ship to embark with a new viceroy at Port  St Mary  near  Cadiz  he was seized with a pleurisy and died  Having before his departure from  Paris  prepared for the press his "  Traité des Fougeres  de l'Amerique  " it was printed in folio in pp tab The text in  French  and  Latin  All the Ferns contained in the former volume enter again into this and as this likewise was printed at the King's expence it has all the advantages in the execution that accompanies royal munificence  We are informed by Dr LISTER that PLUMIER left behind him drawings of plants sufficient to make ten volumes equal to the first book above mentioned They are said to have amounted to Some of these remained in the convent at  Paris  to which PLUMIER belonged others were in the King's library From the latter BOERHAAVE procured copies of species done by AUBRIET under the inspection of VAILLANT These were published in by Professor BURMAN at  Amsterdam  in ten  fasciculi  accompanied with plates on which are engraven upwards of species and Dr BLOCH of  Berlin  has procured many of the fishes for his late splendid work on ichthyology  PLUMIER was the author of two dissertations one in the "  Journal des Scavans  " of the other in the "  Journal des Trevoux  " to prove that cochineal was an insect a fact doubted by many at that time and concerning which his own testimony had been controverted In the same work occur some publications by PLUMIER on other zoological subjects  His  L'Art de Tourner  was first published at  Lyons  in and a second time at  Paris  so lately as in in folio with eighty plates It is spoken of as a curious and singular work containing the most compleat instructions relating to that art that are to be met with  CHAP  Banister  communicates plants to  Ray  Perished in  Virginia  by

made a voyage to the  East Indies  where he remained some time but was afterwards fixed in  Virginia  In that country he industriously sought for plants described them and himself drew the figures of the rare species he was also celebrated for his knowledge of insects and meditated writing the natural history of  Virginia  for which Mr RAY  observes that he was every way qualified He sent to RAY in "A Catalogue of Plants observed by him in  Virginia  " which was published in the second volume of RAY's History p  The world was deprived of much of the fruit of his labours by his untimely death BANISTER increased the list of martyrs to natural history In one of his excursions in pursuit of his object he fell from the rocks and perished His  Herbarium  came into the possession of Sir  Hans  SLOANE who thought it a considerable acquisition  The following papers written by Mr BANISTER were published in the  Philosophical Transactions  A Catalogue of several Curiosities found in  Virginia

German physician led by their genius for botany made a voyage to  Maryland  They returned after having collected an  Herbarium  of several hundred new and undescribed plants These came into the possession of Sir  Hans  SLOANE by whose liberal communication they were inserted in the "Supplement" to RAY's History Mr VERNON is also spoken of by RAY as not less skilful and assiduous in the pursuit of  English  plants  and of all other branches of natural knowledge His discoveries in the  Cryptogamia  class were numerous  Of Dr KREIG I can give no further account than that he was of  Saxony  I conjecture that after his return from  Maryland  he retired into his native country He was the friend and correspondent of DALE who in his  Pharmacologia  introduces his name in the most respectful manner for notices communicated by him and ranks him among the few eminent men of the time who excelled in the knowledge of the  Materia Medica  and Chemistry Dr KREIG was not living when DALE published the third edition of the abovementioned work in  Dr KREIG communicated to the Royal Society "An Account of Cobalt and the Preparation of Smalt and Arsenic" according to the process used at the mines of  Shneebergh  in  Hermanduria  It was printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  Vol xxiv p with figures of the Furnaces  CUNNINGHAM  In the period we are now speaking of but few voyagers possessed any considerable knowledge of nature or a spirit of enquiry powerful enough to induce them to sacrifice their avocations from interested pursuits to the study of natural history SLOANE BANISTER and a few others were indeed exceptions and in this sketch it would be injurious to his memory not to add the name of  James  CUNNINGHAM to whom RAY and particularly PLUKENET and PETIVER acknowledge important obligations for his copious communications of new plants  The merit of Mr CUNNINGHAM would justly demand a more complete gratification of curiosity concerning his life and circumstances than I can supply I can only collect that he went out in as surgeon to the factory established by the East India Company at  Emuy  or  Amoy  on the coast of  China  and afterwards made a  second voyage in the same capacity to the subsequent establishment at  Kusan  or  Chusan  in on which island he resided some time  I conjecture also that he was afterwards fixed at  Pulo Condore  and was the person to whom we owe the account of the massacre of the  English  by the  Macassars  at that factory in as related in the Modern Part of the  Universal History  vol x p edit  o    Mr CUNNINGHAM kept a journal of the weather in both his voyages to  China  and during his residence on the isle of  Chusan  he appears to have been very active in collecting the productions of that place He sent over to PLUKENET and PETIVER a very large number of new plants as is evident from an inspection of their writings In the "  Amaltheum  " of PLUKENET his name occurs in almost every page  From the island of  Ascension  Mr CUNNINGHAM transmitted to PETIVER an account of the plants and shells he observed there He sent a journal of his voyage  and an account of the Isle of  Chusan  which was printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  vol xxiii p It conveys many interesting particulars to the  English  reader relating to the inhabitants their fisheries agriculture and arts He corrects several mistakes of Father MARTINI and LE COMPTE and is I believe the first  English  writer who gives an accurate history of the  Tea Tree  which although but short is authenticated by the latest description given us by THUNBERG in the "  Flora Japonica  "  Besides this account of  Chusan  I find the following papers written by Mr CUNNINGHAM and printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  A Catalogue of Plants and Shells collected on the Isle of  Ascension  N  o  vol xxi p  Observations on the Weather at  Emuy  in  China  in with the State of the Barometer N  o  vol xxi p

writers were under singular obligations for the liberality and importance of their communications both of vegetable and animal productions from the  East Indies  Mr  Samuel  BROWN was surgeon to the Fort at  St George  now called  Madras  His correspondence with Mr PETIVER and his collections have been noticed before  The name of Mr  Alexander  BROWN occurs in many parts of PLUKENET's works  He discovered several new plants both in the  East Indies  and at the  Cape of Good Hope  Dr PLUKENET denominated a new genus of  African  plants belonging to the  Pentandrous  class  Eriocephalos Bruniades  in honour of  Alexander  BROWN LINNAEUS has perpetuated the genus but agreeably to his rules which do not admit of such terminations has changed the term to BRUNIA of which some species are known in the  English  gardens    GLEN  Among the contemporaries of Mr RAY I am led from private information to mention  Andrew  GLEN MA a divine who although his name does not occur in the writings of his time was the friend and acquaintance of that eminent man having probably acquired a taste for similar pursuits from a frequent intercourse with him at the seat of his illustrious friend Mr WILLUGHBY near  Nottingham  I have seen an  Herbarium  collected by Mr GLEN which bears date in containing upwards of seven hundred indigenous and two hundred exotic plants Some of these  were collected in the tour on the continent He afterwards travelled into  Sweden  and  Italy  and resided some time at  Turin  where he began another collection which is dated but contained not more than two hundred specimens This  Herbarium  all circumstances considered was not mean for the time in which it was made Mr GLEN was afterwards rector of  Hatherne  in  Leicestershire  where he died at an advanced age  CHAP  Sloane  Memoirs ofBorn in  Ireland  His strong bias to natural history in his youthTravels with Dr  Tancred Robinson  Favourite with  Sydenham  Attends the Duke of  Albemarle  to

Greatly augments his Museum by the accession of  Courten  's  SLOANE  AT the same period of time lived RAY MORISON PLUKENET PETIVER SLOANE and SHERARD under whose countenance and culture the knowledge of nature received the most rapid and substantial improvement which it had ever experienced In this period system had been revived and improved by MORISON RAY HERMAN TOURNEFORT and RIVINUS In this period also RHEDE RUMPHIUS PLUMIER and SLOANE published  those great works in exotic botany which have immortalized their names This period was the close of the last century which as it has been called by the elegant and learned author of the "Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope"  "the Golden Age of Learning in  England  "  so has LINNAEUS named it in his Allegorical History of the Rise and Progress of this Science "The GOLDEN AGE OF BOTANY" and SLOANE was one of its brightest ornaments  Of the life of this great patron of natural science it would be superfluous in me to attempt a detailed account since this tribute has been paid to his memory in the "Eloge of the  French  Academy" in the "  Biographia Britannica  " the "Biographical Dictionary" and other collections of that kind in daily use Hence I shall from these publications extract only the outlines of his life as they are connected with and tend to clucidate his general character his acquirements in natural history and his botanical publications  Sir  Hans  SLOANE was descended from  parents originally of  Scottish  extraction and was born at  Killileagh  in the county of  Down  in  Ireland  April His younger years were marked by a strong attachment to the works of nature At sixteen his studies were interrupted by ill health in consequence of a spitting of blood which confined him for three years On his amendment he studied the preliminary branches of physic in  London  for four years chemistry under a pupil of the great STAHL his favourite science at  Chelsea  Garden then but just established and young as he was contracted during that time an acquaintance with BOYLE and RAY Mr SLOANE afterwards in company with Mr  Tancred  ROBINSON and another student visited  France  for improvement At  Paris  he attended TOURNEFORT and DU VERNEY and is supposed to have taken his degrees in medicine at  Montpelier  some say at  Orange  He returned to  London  at the latter end of the year and became the favourite of Dr SYDENHAM who took him into his house and zealously promoted his interest In November  he was elected a fellow of the  Royal Society  and in April entered into the college of physicians These early advancements in the professional line are the strongest presumptions in favour of his superior knowledge and promising abilities Yet these flattering prospects he relinquished to gratify his ardour for natural knowledge  On the th of September and in the th year of his age he embarked for  Jamaica  as physician to the Duke of  Albemarle  and touched at  Madeira Barbadoes Nevis  and  St Kitt's  The Duke dying on the th of December soon after their arrival at  Jamaica  Dr SLOANE's stay on the island did not exceed fifteen months During this time however such was his application that in the language of his  French  eulogist had he not converted as it were his minutes into hours he could not have made those numerous acquisitions which contributed so largely to extend the knowledge of nature while they laid the foundation of his own future same and fortune  Here I am led to observe that several  circumstances concurred respecting the voyage of Dr SLOANE to  Jamaica  which rendered it peculiarly successful to natural history He was the first man of learning whom the love of science alone had led from  England  to that distant part of the globe and consequently the field was wholly open to him He was already well acquainted with the discoveries of the age He had an enthusiasm for his object and was at an age when both activity of body and vivacity of mind concur to vanquish difficulties Under this happy coincidence of circumstances it is not strange that Dr SLOANE returned home with a rich harvest In fact besides a proportional number of subjects from the animal kingdom he brought from  Jamaica  and the other islands they touched at not fewer than different species of plants A number very far beyond what had been imported by any individual into  England  before  Dr SLOANE returned from his voyage on the th of May and fixing in  London  soon became eminent He was chosen physician to Christ's Hospital in  In the preceding year he had been elected secretary to the  Royal Society  and had revived the publication of the  Philosophical Transactions  which had been interrupted from the year This office he held till and was then succeeded by Dr HALLEY  In Dr SLOANE married  Elizabeth  daughter of Alderman  Langley  of  London  She died in She brought him besides a son and daughter who died young two other daughters who survived and were advantageously married the eldest to  George Stanley  Esq  of the county of  Hants  and the younger to Lord  Cadogan  It was about this time that he became an active member of the college in promoting the plan of a dispensary for the poor which was at length carried into effect The feuds excited on this occasion gave rise to the celebrated satire from Dr GARTH  It was not till the year that Dr SLOANE published the  Prodromus  to his History of  Jamaica  Plants under the title of "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM QUAE IN  INSULA JAMAICA SPONTE PROVENIUNT  vel vulgo coluntur cum earundem Synonymis et Locis natalibus adjectis aliis quibusdam quae in Insulis Maderae Barbados Nieves et Sancti Christophori nascuntur seu Prodromi Historiae Naturalis Jamaicae Pars Prima  "  o  pp  Praeter Indicem valde copiosum Nominum et Synonymorum  This volume intrinsically valuable as it is my yet be considered as only the nomenclature or systematic index to his subsequent work The arrangement of the subject and which was strictly followed in "The History" is nearly that of Mr RAY vegetables being thrown into twentyfive large natural classes or families Among botanists of that time generical characters had not attained any remarkable precision and SLOANE like PLUKENET was little farther anxious than to refer his new plants to some genus already established without a minute attention to the parts of fructification farther than as they formed part of the character drawn from habit yet with this defect the figures and descriptions of SLOANE proved sufficiently accurate to enable  his successors to refer almost all his species to the appropriate places in the system of the present day  By this neglect of constructing  genera  SLOANE nevertheless threw into the hands of PLUMIER the grateful opportunity which he embraced of naming the plants of his investigations after celebrated botanists In justice however to PLUMIER it has been before observed that he was not parsimonious in the distribution of these favours to the merit of  Englishmen  It is worthy of observation that among these classes there are only two plants belonging to the  Umbelliferous  tribe and but one genus of the  Asperifoliae  namely the  Heliotropium  The ferns on the other hand are very numerous all over the  West India  islands SLOANE has above one hundred species and PLUMIER a few years afterwards detected many more  In this volume however small in bulk yet vast in labour there is a circumstance much to the credit of SLOANE which must be obvious to every intelligent naturalist It is the care which the author has taken to  consult every possible resource in order to discriminate his plants and avoid an unnecessary multiplication of species by describing that as new which was before known So numerous a set of synonyms had never been inserted in any local catalogue and SLOANE greatly enhanced its value by a most commendable addition having with incredible labour referred to every traveller of note for all the vegetables renowned for utility in medicine arts or oeconomy In this instance it is much to be regretted that so praiseworthy an example has not been more frequently imitated by succeeding botanists  Before I dismiss this volume I must mention an instance of the liberality of its author in allowing Mr RAY the free use of his manuscripts of the  Jamaica  plants on the publication of the third volume of his "History" in Accordingly we find all SLOANE's new plants with the descriptions at large inserted in that work He also communicated a list of  English  plants which he had observed spontaneously growing in  Jamaica  This was printed in  the second edition of the  Synopsis  and continued by DILLENIUS in the third  Dr SLOANE began early to form a museum and it was by the collections made in his voyage become considerable but the aera of its celebrity was not till when it received the augmentation of Mr COURTEN's valuable stores United by similar taste Dr SLOANE had formed with this gentleman an early and strict friendship and a perpetual interchange of communications and good offices had subsisted between them of which Sir  Hans  himself bears public testimony in his writings It is not possible at this time to ascertain the extent of Mr COURTEN's collection but it is sufficiently certain that it was very ample the acquisition of it added new ardour and diligence to our naturalist in the augmentation of it He has himself exhibited a general statement of the contents of his museum twentytwo years after its enlargement by the abovementioned collection By this it appears that the subjects of natural history alone exclusive of two hundred volumes of preserved plants amounted to  more than articles They were afterwards augmented to upwards of as may be seen by "A General View of the Contents" published a year before his deathAnd here I cannot but observe that the curious are under singular obligation to the author of the article COURTEN in the fourth volume of the new edition of the  Biographia Britannica  who has with great labour brought to light so many interesting memoirs relating to Mr COURTEN and his family His truly laborious researches have done equal justice to that gentleman and to Sir  Hans  SLOANE by rescuing the history of their connexion from great misrepresentation Hence we learn that Dr SLOANE as executor to his friend so far from acquiring the accession of Mr COURTEN's museum  at a dear rate  as had been represented in the preceding edition obtained it at a price greatly under its original and real value

 Philosophical Transactions  SLOANE  IN the year Dr SLOANE was incorporated doctor of physic at  Oxford  and was associated member of several academies on the continent In he published the first volume of his history under the following title  "A VOYAGE to the Islands  Madeira Barbadoes Nevis St Christopher's  and  Jamaica  with the Natural History of the Herbs and Trees fourfooted Beasts Fishes Birds Insects Reptiles c To  which is prefixed an Introduction wherein is an Account of the Inhabitants Air Waters Diseases Trade c of that Place with some Relations concerning the neighbouring Continent and Islands of America" Vol i fol pp tab  This volume is dedicated to the queen The introduction contains pages and is replete with matter of an interesting nature and evidently displays the great pains the author took to collect materials for this work It comprehends a general account of the discovery of the  West Indies  and of the island of  Jamaica  in particular the geography the climate and soil food manners and economy of the various inhabitants description of a tour the author made to various parts of the country and especially to the ruins of  Sevilla  with an account of the church built by  Peter Martyr  a list of more than fifty European vegetables principally of the culinary tribe cultivated in the gardens of  Jamaica  He concludes with an history of the diseases and the detail of many cases which came under his  own observation Then follows the journal of the voyage with ample descriptions of the marine animals observed in the course of it the plants observed at  Madeira  several of which are figured in the work itself observations of the like kind made at  Barbadoes  The remainder of the volume contains a methodical arrangement and description of all the submarine and herbaceous plants natives of the island amounting to and upwards Very few synonyms are here introduced but references in general made to the copious collection of them in his "Catalogue" To each plant the author has subjoined from medical authors and from travellers the most ample account of their several uses  The  second volume  was not published till the year and was dedicated to the king The reasons of this delay are assigned in the introduction and were principally the care the arrangement and description of his museum The accession of Mr COURTEN's collection has been remarked above and that of PETIVER in gave Sir  Hans  much employment PETIVER  had amassed a greater quantity of the productions of nature than any man before him but he had not preserved them with a care equal to the zeal with which he acquired them and it demanded extraordinary diligence to recover them from the injury they had sustained It is in the introduction to this volume that Sir  Hans  gives a general inventory of his Library and Museum as it stood in the year which has been noticed before and by the comparison of which with later estimates it appears how greatly he increased it after that time  This second volume comprehends five hundred pages and completes the vegetable part and the animal kingdom The new plants are nearly all figured The plates are continued to the number of The last forty belong to the animals of which some of all the classes the  Mammalia  excepted are here exhibited  To the curious botanist it will be observable that out of vegetables described in these volumes above are  Ferns  and that of the others more than species are of the  arborescent  kind  Subsequent voyagers have established it as a fact that in the warmer and intertropical regions this latter class constitutes in a general way the third part of the vegetable productions of nature Abundantly the reverse of this takes place in temperate and cold climates  In these volumes Sir  Hans  has introduced all his quotations at length from the books of travels mentioned in the "Catalogue" to illustrate the various uses of each vegetable They exhibit a proof of the author's industry which I conceive it is difficult to parallel in any other work The tables which were principally engraved by  Vander Gucht  although on a large scale yet having the disadvantage of being done from dried specimens want those natural attitudes which grace more modern performances In this volume Sir  Hans  takes various occasions to defend himself from the strictures of PLUKENET and in his turn criticises that author though in a language much less censurable than that of the  Mantissa  The voyage of Dr SLOANE was productive of much subsequent benefit to science  by exciting an emulation both in  Britain  and on the continent Sir  Arthur  RAWDON upon viewing his splendid collection sent  James  HARLOW a skilful gardener to  Jamaica  who returned with a ship almost laden with plants in a vegetating state and with a great number of dried specimens Of the latter SLOANE had all such as were new before he published his first volume Many of the living plants succeeded in the garden of Sir  Arthur  at  Moyra  in  Ireland  and many were distributed into the garden of the Bishop of  London  at  Fulham  Dr UVEDALE's at  Enfield  the  Chelsea  Garden and especially into that of her Grace the  Duchess  of BEAUFORT at  Badminton  in  Gloucestershire  the botanic gardens of  Amsterdam Leyden Leipsic  and  Upsal  shared these rarities TOURNEFORT sent Dr GUNDELSCHEIMER his associate in his oriental journey into  England  to view SLOANE's plants and this gave occasion to PLUMIER's expedition into the  Caribbee  Islands  Dr SLOANE entered very early into correspondence with Mr RAY His first letter  bears date in and DE  HAM's collection contains thirteen Most of them have reference to botanical subjects while they evidence the mutual friendship of the writers a cirumstance indeed very pathetically expressed by Mr RAY in the last letter he ever wrote which was but a few days before his death being dated Jan  In he was elected a foreign member of the  Royal Academy  of  Sciences  at  Paris  a distinction of the highest estimation in science and the greater at that time as the  French  nation was at war with  England  and the queen's consent was necessary to the acceptance of it He was frequently consulted by Queen  Ann  who in her last illness was blooded by him On the accession of  George  I he was created a baronet being the first  English  physician on whom an hereditary title of honour had been conferred He was appointed Physician General to the Army which office he enjoyed till when he was made Physician to King  George  II He gained the confidence of Queen  Caroline  and prescribed for the royal family till his death  In Sir  Hans  was elected President of the College of Physicians which station he held sixteen years and during that time he gave signal proofs of his zeal for the interests of that body  On purchasing the manor of  Chelsea  he gave the fee simple of the  Botanial Garden  to the Company of Apothecaries on conditions which will more properly be specified in a subsequent part of this work  On the death of Sir  Isaac  NEWTON in Sir  Hans  SLOANE was advanced to the presidency of the Royal Society of  London  the interest of which no man had ever more uniformly promoted He made the Society a present of guineas and a bust of the founder King  Charles  II Thus in the zenith of prosperity he presided at the same time over the two most illustrious scientific bodies in the kingdom and while he discharged the respective duties of each station with credit and honour he also enjoyed the most extensive and dignified employment as a physician He occupied these important stations from the year to when he resigned the presidency of the College of Physicians and in at the age of  fourscore that of the  Royal Society  having formed the resolution of withdrawing from the bustle of life into retirement at  Chelsea  In he removed his Library and Museum and on the th of May fixed at his new mansion where occasionally visited by his friends and by all men of distinction from abroad he passed in serenity and in the constant exercise of benevolence the last twelve years of his life which terminated Jan OS  Sir  Hans  SLOANE was tall and well made in his person easy polite and engaging in his manners sprightly in his conversation and obliging to all To foreigners he was extremely courteous and ready to shew and explain his curiosities to all who gave him timely notice of their visit He kept an open table once a week for his learned friends particularly those of the Royal Society In the aggregation of his vast collection of books he is said to have sent his duplicates either to the Royal College of Physicians or to the Bodleian Library  He was governor of almost every hospital  in  London  and to each after having given an hundred pounds in his lifetime he left a more considerable legacy at his death He was ever a benefactor to the poor who felt the consequences of his death severely He was zealous in promoting the establishment of the colony of  Georgia  in and formed himself the plan for bringing up the children in the Foundling Hospital in  In the exercise of his function as a physician he is said to have been remarkable for the certainty of his prognostics and the hand of the anatomist verified in a signal manner the truth of his predictions relating to the seat of diseases By his practice he not only confirmed the efficacy of the  Peruvian Bark  in intermittents but extended its use in fevers of other denominations in nervous disorders and in gangrenes and hemorrhages The sanction he gave to inoculation by performing that operation on some of the royal family encouraged and much accelerated its progress throughout the kingdom His ointment for the  Leucoma  has not yet lost its credit with many reputable names in physic  Possessed of affluence entirely the reward of his own merit Sir  Hans  SLOANE enjoyed through a long life every satisfaction that science could bestow and in the  British Museum  has not only erected the noblest monument to his own fame but a temple also to the culture of learning and of science which will transmit his donation to future ages as a signal instance of the munificence of a private individual  That the list of Sir  Hans  SLOANE's writings may be complete I shall in conformity with my general plan in other instances recite those papers which were printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  Many of these convey such interesting literary information and abound with such facts and observations as will long give them a value with all who remember the eminent abilities and services of the author and have a relish for the like researches  The first of Dr SLOANE's papers in the  Philosophical Transactions  is a Description  of the  Jamaica  Pepper Tree  Myrtus Pimenta  Lin with an account of curing the Berries and of the Oil distilled from them commonly sold for  Carpobalsamum  N  o  Vol xvii p accompanied

described by MARCGRAAVE It is so nearly allied to the Chesnut tree that MILLER in his Dictionary refers it to that genus LINNAEUS however on the credit of LOEFLING preserves PLUMIER's appellation

institutions which in a singular manner invigorated in this period the spirit of natural history in  England  the ROYAL SOCIETY of  London  claims the most distinguished notice In its design as in its progress it was the fostering parent and guardian of  natural knowledge The collection of a museum of natural curiosities was one of the objects in view and such was the respectability of the society both as a body and in its individuals that through its means the whole nation may be said to have amply contributed to its emolument All new objects of curiosity all new books at home and abroad new discoveries throughout all nature incessantly offered themselves and thus not only tended to remove the prejudices that too strongly prevailed against the studies of nature in that age but in the event excited a passion in the public which was so successfully exerted in improving not natural history alone but real and useful science at large that it will not be considered as an exaggerated encomium to assert that more effectual advancement was made by the influence of this illustrious body in one century than had before taken place from the earliest ages Botany shared these benefits and the early volumes of the  Transactions  abound in records of newlydiscovered vegetables and of newlydiscovered properties  in that part of the creation Experiments of various intention were instituted by this learned body Under their auspices the anatomy and philosophy of plants were illustrated by GREW and improved by HALES Such memoirs in the  Philosophical Transactions  as more directly relate to my object or were written by those whom I commemorate have been already or will be briefly noticed in the course of these pages  CHELSEA GARDEN  I proceed further to observe that among the assistances which the science has received from public bodies of men must be mentioned also that which sprung from the Physic Garden founded by the Company of Apothecaries at  Chelsea  an institution which reflected the highest honour on that respectable society This took place in the year although the inscription over the entrance imports that the Garden was not effectually constructed till the year  From the time of JOHNSON the editor of GERARD a custom had prevailed among the  London  Apothecaries to form a society  each summer and make excursions to investigate plants The  Itinera  published by JOHNSON may be considered as the fruit of such expeditions in his day But they had been discontinued as I apprehend for many years After the foundation of the Garden this laudable practice was revived and the associations fixed to stated periods and put under regulations the herborizings being now distinguished into private and general The first intended to excite a taste for botany among the apprentices of the Company begin on the second Tuesday of April and are held monthly on the same day till September inclusively in some of the villages in the immediate neighbourhood of  London  At the end of the season the premium of a copy of RAY's  Synopsis  since changed for Mr HUDSON's  Flora Anglica  is presented to the young man who has been the most successful in discovering and investigating the greatest number of plants The general herborization is annual only in July when the Demonstrator and others of the Court of Assistants belonging to the Company make an excursion to a considerable distance from  the city collect the scarce plants and dine together near  London  on which occasion they are frequently accompanied by other gentlemen who are fond of the same pursuits  This institution at  Chelsea  was rendered more stable and received permanency from the liberality of Sir  Hans  SLOANE who soon after his purchase of the manor in gave the freehold of the ground near four acres to the Company on condition that the demonstrator should in the name of the Company deliver annually to the  Royal Society  fifty new plants till the number should amount to all specifically different from each other the list of which was published yearly in the  Philosophical Transactions  The first was printed in the year and the catalogues have been continued till the year at which time the number was completed These specimens are duly preserved in the archives of the Society for the inspection of the curious  Under excellent superintendants  Chelsea Garden  has flourished having been excelled perhaps by no public institution of the  kind in  Europe  for the number of curious exotics it contains Of this the Dictionary and Figures of the late Mr MILLER afford sufficient proofs The advantages indeed of this institution are obvious and even Sir  Hans  SLOANE himself acknowledged his obligations to it in the early part of his life  In justice to the memory of those who have eminently filled the place of lecturers and demonstrators in the  Chelsea Garden  I recite their names from the time of Sir  Hans  SLOANE's donation not being able to ascend above that period  Isaac  RAND apothecary FRS    Joseph  MILLER apothecary    John  WILMER MD    William  HUDSON FRS    Stanesby  ALCHORNE    William  CURTIS    Mr RAND published in in  o    Index Plantarum Officinalium Horti Chelsejani  The list contains plants of the  Materia Medica  and specifies the part of each used in physic The same author  published  Horti Chelsejani Index Compendiarius    o  Houston  gave the name of RAND to a West India shrub of the  Pentandrous  class figured by  Sloane  and it is retained by LINNAEUS    Joseph  MILLER published "  Botanicum Officinale  or A Compendious Herbal giving an Account of all such Plants as are now used in the Practice of Physic with their Descriptions and Virtues"  o  pp The plants are alphabetically arranged according to the officinal names The Summary of the Virtues is in most instances a translation from the  Pharmacologia  of DALE  Except in the  Orthotonia  subjoined to  Shipton  's edition of  Pharmacopaeia Bateana  the  Botanicum Officinale  of MILLER is the only book on the subject not of very modern date in which the student is assisted in the accentuation of the  Latin  names of plants but from the confined nature of the plan in these works the benefit is not extensive  Among the favourable circumstances which contributed to distinguish or I might  say helped to form the  Golden Age of Botany  before alluded to was that growing taste for the cultivation of exotics which sprung up among the great and opulent after the happy return of internal peace by the Restoration  Archibald Duke of  ARGYLE is said to have been one of the first who was conspicuous for the introduction of Foreign Trees and Shrubs Mr EVELYN both by his writings and example encouraged the same taste He cultivated a garden and plantations at  Saye'sCourt  near  Deptford  and his  Sylva  remains a monument of his learning and patriotic intentions which cannot soon be superseded  After the Revolution the Royal Gardens at  HamptonCourt  were rich in fine plants and that at  St James's  of no inconsiderable note if we may guess by the many new plants PLUKENET received from it The  Duchess of  BEAUFORT had a garden richly stored at  Badminton  in  Gloucestershire  Dr  Henry  COMPTON Bishop of  London  another at  Fulham  and many private gentlemen vied with each other in these elegant and useful amusements The gardens of  Dr UVEDALE of  Enfield  of Mr DU BOIS an  East India  merchant of Mr COURTEN and others were of the first notice and afforded much assistance to the labours of RAY PLUKENET and PETIVER The growing commerce of the nation the more frequent intercourse with  Holland  where immense collections from the  Dutch  colonies had been made rendered these gratifications more easily attainable than before and from all these happy coincidences science in general reaped great benefit  BISHOP COMPTON  Among those I have just enumerated Dr  Henry  COMPTON Bishop of  London  claims peculiar notice since we learn from Mr RAY and PLUKENET that he joined to his taste for gardening a real and scientific knowledge of plants an attainment not usual among the great in those days  This eminent prelate so distinguished for his zeal in the cause of Protestantism and for the active part he took in promoting the Revolution was born in the year He was entered a nobleman of  Queen's College  Oxford  in where he continued about three years and afterwards travelled abroad After the Restoration he entered into the army but very soon quitted it for the church In the year he became Rector of  Cottenham  in  Cambridgeshire  and after possessing various emoluments in the church was made Bishop of  Oxford  in the year and the year after translated to the See of  London  which he held to the time of his death in the year at the age of  In his retirement at  Fulham  Bishop COMPTON amply gratified himself in his favourite amusement The circumstances of the times above mentioned aided by his own zeal and a residence of thirtyeight years on the same See enabled him finally to collect a greater variety of Greenhouse rarities and to plant a greater variety of hardy Exotic Trees and Shrubs than had been seen in any garden before in  England  This repository was ever open to the inspection of the curious and scientific and we find RAY PETIVER and PLUKENET in numerous instances acknowledging the  assistances they received from the free communication of rare and new plants out of the garden at  Fulham  Many of PLUKENET's figures were engraved from specimens out of the Bishop's garden and some from a book of drawings in his possession quoted under the name of  Codex Comptoniensis  In the second volume of RAY's History of Plants p we find a Catalogue of some new species of Trees and Plants observed by the author in this garden These were principally of  North American  growth The reader who is desirous of seeing a more ample account of the garden at  Fulham  is referred to a relation of the state in which it was found in the year written by the late Sir  William  WATSON and printed in the th volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  DOODY  If to any man in his day not professedly an author on the subject extraordinary praise is due for discoveries in the indigenous botany it must belong to Mr  Samuel  DOODY the contemporary and friend of RAY PLUKENET and SLOANE who all hear testimony to his merit I regret the want of more information relating to this assiduous man of whom I can only say that he was born in  Staffordshire  was an apothecary in  London  and a fellow of the  Royal Society  He was chosen superintendant and demonstrator of the Garden at  Chelsea  an office he held for some years before his death which took place in  As Mr DOODY lived in  London  and there is room to believe he was in very considerable business his excursions could not ordinarily extend far from that city In its neighbourhood his diligence was beyond any other example He struck out a new path in botany by leading to the study of that tribe which comprehended the imperfect plants now called the  Cryptogamia  class In this branch he made the most numerous discoveries of any man in that age and in the knowledge of it stood clearly unrivalled The early editions of RAY's  Synopsis  were much amplified by his labours and he is represented by Mr RAY as a man  of uncommon sagacity in discovering and discriminating plants in general The learned successor of  Tournefort  M JUSSIEU speaks of him as  inter Pharmacopoeos Londinenses sui temporis Coryphaeus  In truth he was the DILLENIUS of his time  There is a long list of rare plants many of them new and first discovered by Mr DOODY published in the second edition of RAY's  Synopsis  accompanied with observations on other species I also find "The Case of a Dropsy of the Breast" written by him and printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  in N  o  Vol xx p  CHAP  Llhwyd  Memoirs ofA celebrated antiquaryand

and a skilful naturalist According to Mr  Wood  he was the son of  Edward  LLHWYD or  Lloyd  of  Kidwell  in  Carmarthenshire  but as  Boyer  relates of  Charles Llhwyd  of  Lanvordia  in  Salop  Esq He was born in and became a student of  Jesus College  in of which Dr PLOT was a member and under whom Mr LLHWYD was in a great measure educated  On the resignation of Dr PLOT he succeeded him as keeper of the  Ashmolaean  Museum about He travelled repeatedly all over  Wales  went through the North of  Scotland  into  Ireland  in which kingdom he seems to have made some considerable abode He spent some time in  Cornwall  and in  Britany  in  France  in search of antiquities and materials to carry on the extensive designs he had formed  In all these journies he was constantly attentive to the objects of natural history fossils plants and any remarkable phaenomena of nature Such of his remarks as are published in the  Philosophical Transactions  are full of curious and new information on these subjects His knowledge of the plants of his own country and particularly those of  Wales  justly entitles him to remembrance in these pages although he was not professedly an author on the subject of them  LLHWYD first brought to light several of the rare plants of  Wales  many of which till of late years were considered as natives of no other part of Britain He discovered  several very scarce species in  Cornwall  all these he communicated to Mr RAY who inserted them in the editions of his  Synopsis  with due acknowledgments After having made very large collections for the antiquities of  Wales  and formed great designs in literature he died before he could digest them into order for publication in July  Exclusive of large communications made to Bishop GIBSON's edition of  Camden  on the antiquities of  Wales  he formed from the fruit of his own investigations the  List of Plants  subjoined to the account of that country  He published "LITHOPHYLACII BRITANNICI ICHNOGRAPHIA"  o    cum tab  This work which is a methodical catalogue of the figured fossils of the  Ashmolean  Museum consisting of articles was printed at the expence of Sir  Isaac  NEWTON Sir  Hans  SLOANE and a few others of his learned friends As only copies were printed a new edition of it was published in by Mr  Huddesford  to which were annexed several letters from Mr LLHWYD to his learned friends on the  subject of Fossils his  Praelectio de Stellis Marinis Oceani Britannici et Asteriarum Entrochorum et Encrinorum Origine  In Mr RAY's correspondence we meet with thirteen letters written by LLHWYD all except one bearing date in and the four subsequent years They run chiefly on the subject of Fossils In October he informs Mr RAY that he was employed in drawing up a Catalogue of Mr ASHMOLE's  Legacy  of Books Medals and Pictures In the list of his printed works we find  Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum in Museo Ashmoleano  in sheets folio without date In he published "ARCHAEOLOGIA BRITANNICA" fol Vol I  Glossography  A work by which he will long be remembered among the lovers of antiquity  From private information I have learned that Mr LLHWYD left a very considerable library a large collection of manuscripts and specimens that in the year these were all in the custody of Dr FOWLKES of  Lhanher  who died soon after that time They were undisposed of ten years afterwards  but the printed books which were of great worth had been valued by a gentleman and two booksellers and the refusal of them offered to the Duke of  Bedford  My intelligence reached no farther  I conclude this account with a catalogue of Mr LLHWYD's papers published in the  Philosophical Transactions  An Account of the  Lapis Amianthus  or  Linum Fossile Asbestinum  found

publishing professedly on this subject  Thomas  LAWSON by whose discoveries the  English Flora  was enlarged must not be forgotten  Of Mr LAWSON I can only collect that he lived at  Great Strickland  in  Westmoreland  at the time he transmitted to Mr RAY "A Catalogue of the Rare Plants of the North of  England  " which is printed in the "Philosophical Letters" p This list clearly evinces that the author must have paid great attention to his subject and in fact Mr LAWSON first introduced several  English  plants into notice It is to him that we owe the botanical part of ROBINSON's "Essay on the Natural History of  Westmoreland  and  Cumberland  "  The very frequent mention of his name in the writings of Mr RAY and the copiousness of the  Catalogue of Rare Plants  distinguished by him at so early a period in the North of  England  sufficiently confirm the character that eminent naturalist gives him  "of a diligent industrious and skilful botanist"  It appears that he travelled  into various parts of  England  since he recites plants collected by him on  Salisbury  Plain and if I mistake not he made an excursion into the  Isle of Man  I conjecture that he survived Mr RAY several years but he was not living at the publication of the third edition of the  Synopsis Stirpium  although he left papers of which DILLENIUS availed himself on that occasion  DR ROBINSON  At this period must also be introduced Dr TANCRED ROBINSON physician in  London  and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and of the Royal Society between whom and Mr RAY there subsisted the most genuine friendship and affection  Amicorum Alpha  is the distinction which RAY gives him The printed correspondence between them commences during Dr ROBINSON's travels abroad in and is continued for upwards of ten years Seventeen letters of Dr ROBINSON appear in the "Philosophical Correspondence" with all Mr RAY's answers  They run much on the subject of zoology but contain also botanical and philosophical observations  These letters and the publications of Dr ROBINSON in the  Philosophical Transactions  prove him to have been a man well acquainted with various parts of learning to which he added also an intimate knowledge of natural history and in which he must have been very early initiated since RAY in the Prefaces to his  Historia Plantarum  in acknowledges in strong terms his obligations to him for his care and assiduity in correcting and enriching his work adding that he had exerted himself with a zeal that could not have been exceeded had the work been entirely his own  Mr RAY afterwards put into his hands the manuscript of the  Synopsis  and renewed his acknowledgments for the benefit it received under his inspection  Dr ROBINSON was the author of the following communications printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  An Account of the four first Volumes of the "  Hortus Malabaricus  " with Remarks N  o  N  o  N  o  N  o    A Description with a Figure of the Bridge of  St Esprit  in  France  N  o  Vol xiv p  On the natural Sublimation of Sulphur from the Pyrites and Limestone at  Aetna Vesuvius  and  Solfatara  N  o  Vol xv p  Observations on boiling Fountains and subterraneous Steams occasioned by viewing that of  Parone  near  Montpelier  with an enumeration of many others in various parts of the world N  o  and p With Remarks  On the Lake  Avernus  Ib  On the Truffles found at  Rushton  in  Northamptonshire  with Figures N  o  Vol xvii p  On the  Scotch  Barnacle and  French  Macrcuse N  o  Vol xv p  An Account of  Henry Jenkins  who

Rome  and  Naples  on the  Opuntia  Cork Trees  Manna  Volcanos Palm Trees and other vegetable Productions about  Naples  Antiquities Birds and Fishes N  o  Vol xxix p  DODSWORTH  The Rev  Matthew  DODSWORTH whose residence appears to have been in  Yorkshire  is mentioned both by RAY and PLUKENET as well acquainted with  English  botany He was the first discoverer of at least two of the  English  plants both of which he sent to PLUKENET  CHAP  Dale  Anecdotes ofHis  Pharmacologia  His "  Antiquities of Harwich  " written by  Silas TaylorDale  's valuable additions to that workAn early assistant to  Ray  His papers in the  Philosophical Transactions  DALE  SAMUEL  DALE of  Braintree  in  Essex  the friend and neighbour of Mr RAY eminent for his knowledge of botany but better known as a writer on the most important part of the science its application to the purposes of physic I am not furnished with any anecdotes concerning this respectable writer further than that he practised as an apothecary at  Braintree  until about the year about which time he became a Licentiate of the College of Physicians and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society At this time I apprehend he settled at  Bocking  and practised as a physician until his decease June th  in the eightieth year of his age He was buried in the Dissenter's buryingground at  Bocking  A print of him may be seen before the third edition of his  Pharmacologia  He published PHARMACOLOGIA s  Manuductio ad Materiam Medicam  It was first printed in  o  with the sanction of the College of Physicians and we find four editions of it printed abroad It was republished at London in and  o  and a third time in  o  in pp which edition is much improved and enlarged The arrangement of the work is that of RAY and to each chapter throughout the vegetable kingdom he has prefixed the characters of the genus from the  Methodus Emendata  of that author He has moreover with great labour constructed a  Syllabus  or synoptical view of all the articles under each section or class on a more amplified plan than that of RAY  The  Materia Medica  of DALE in its first edition may be said to have been one of the earliest rational books on the subject  In an interval of more than forty years between the first and last editions much of that credulity which had obtained respecting the powers of simples among the writers of the last century had abated Several excellent publications had taken place abroad which aided by improvements at home enabled DALE to select better materials and give his last edition the importance of a new work Scarcely in any author is there a more copious collection of synonyms a circumstance which independent of much other intrisic worth will long continue the use of the book with those who wish to pursue the history of any article through all former writers on the subject  In Mr DALE published "The ANTIQUITILS of HARWICH and DOVER COURT" in  o  pp tab written by  Silas  TAYLOR  Gent  about the year with large notes amounting to much the greater part of the book Howsoever respectable our author may appear as an antiquary in this volume he is equally so as a naturalist in general His History of the Figured Fossils of the Cliff is very exact  and copious and the view he has given in a short compass of the various opinions relating to the origin of these bodies as held by the writers of the last and the beginning of the present century is very satisfactory  His  Synopsis  of the animals and vegetables of the neighbouring sea and coast proves his intimate and critical knowledge of his subjects and being embellished with several good copperplates renders his book a real acquisition to science  It is highly probable that from their vicinity to each other DALE owed to Mr RAY his attachment to natural history and the great proficiency he so early made in that study We find Mr RAY acknowledging his assistance in collecting and extricating the synonyms of plants correcting errors and supplying omissions for his  Historia Plantarum  of which the  imprimatur  bears date when DALE could not be more than years old  DALE was the author of several communications to the Royal Society which  were published in the  Philosophical Transactions  A Method of making Turnip Bread practised in Essex in a scarcity of corn in Printed in N  o    Some Observations on the  Vermis Aureus  of  Bartholine  aphrodita aculeata  Lin  a marine animal called a  Sea Mouse  common on the coast of  England  but not having been much observed until Dr  Molyneux

the Diadelphous class communicated by MILLER to the  Clifford Garden  and figured in the Work that bears that name The plant afterwards fell into the genus  Psoralea  established by  Van  ROYEN now comprehending many species where it preserves the trivial name of  Dalea  BROWN endeavoured afterwards to perpetuate  Dale  in his  Jamaica  Plants but BROWN's species became the  Eupatorium Dalea  of the  Linnaean  system    CHAP  Bradley  a popular Writer on Gardening and AgricultureProfessor of Botany at  CambridgeHistoria Plantarum Succulentarum  Blair  Anecdotes ofHis Miscellaneous ObservationsBotanic Essays a Book of much InstructionConfirms the Doctrine of the Sexes of Plants by Experiments  Pharmacobotanologia  Papers in the  Philosophical Transactions  BRADLEY  RICHARD  BRADLEY a popular writer on Gardening and Agriculture in the early part of this century was one of the first who treated these subjects in a philosophical manner and as he possessed considerable botanical knowledge is entitled to a place in these Anecdotes He first made himself known to the public by two papers printed in the xxixth Volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  One "on the Motion of the Sap in Vegetables  Vol xxix p  " the other "on the quick Growth of Mouldiness on Melons  Ib p  " He became a Fellow of the  Royal Society  and  was chosen Professor of Botany in the University of  Cambridge  in BRADLEY was the author of more than twenty separate publications chiefly on Gardening and Agriculture published between the years and  His "New Improvement of Planting and Gardening both Philosophical and Practical"  o  went through repeated impressions as did his Gentleman's "and Gardener's Kalendar" which was the fourth part of the preceding book both at home and in translations abroad His "Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature"  o  was a popular instructive and entertaining work and continued in repute several years The same may be said of his "General Treatise of Husbandry and Gardening"  o  Vol and of his "Practical Discourses concerning the four Elements as they relate to the Growth of Plants"  o  His "  Dictionarium Botanicum  "  o  was I believe the first attempt of the kind in  England  Mr BRADLEY was not eminent for any discoveries relating to the indigenous plants  of  England  but exotic botany was indebted to him for an undertaking which there is reason to regret he was not enabled to pursue and perfect I mean his book on  Succulent Plants  As this tribe is incapable of being advantageously preserved in a  Hortus Siccus  there is no part of botany that calls more essentially for a separate publication His work bears the following title "HISTORIA PLANTARUM SUCCULENTARUM  complectens hasce insequentes Plantas Aloen scilicet Ficoiden Cereos Melocardium aliasque ejus generis quae in Horto sicco coli non possunt secundum Prototypum puta naturam in tabellis aeneis insculptas earumdem Descriptiones huc accedunt et Cultura    o  t It was published in  Decads  at different times between the years and of which only five were completed The whole was republished in The descriptions are in Latin and English and the figures extremely well done in the stile of the time It preserves its value as being cited by LINNAEUS and as containing some plants not figured in any other publication  A species of  Sedum  is the only indigenous plant contained in it  BRADLEY gave a course of Lectures on the  Materia Medica  in  London  in the year which he published in  o  in the succeeding year He died at the latter end of  Although BRADLEY's writings do not abound in new discoveries yet they are not destitute of interesting knowledge collected from contemporary gardeners and from books He was an advocate for the circulation of the sap and made several new observations on the sexes of plants in consequence of the production of hybrid species by which he added strength to that doctrine He wrote instructively on the gems of trees on bulbs on grafting and particularly on the methods of producing variegated and double flowers  On the whole BRADLEY's writings coinciding with the growing taste for gardening the introduction of exotics and improvements in husbandry contributed to excite a more philosophical view of these  arts and diffuse a general and popular knowledge of them throughout the kingdom  The industry and talents of BRADLEY were not mean and though unadorned by learning were sufficient to have secured to him that reputable degree of respect from posterity which it will ever justly withhold from him who fails to recommend such qualifications by integrity and propriety of conduct In these unhappily Mr BRADLEY was deficient We learn from the account given of him by Mr MARTYN that he procured the professorship in a clandestine and fraudulent manner and afterwards neglected to perform the duties of it The University nevertheless allowed him to retain the nominal distinction of Professor and appointed Dr MARTYN to give the lectures Near the conclusion of his life his conduct was so unbecoming that it was in agitation to deprive him of this nominal title  BLAIR  Dr  Patrick  BLAIR was a native of  Scotland  and practised physic and surgery at  Dundee  where he made himself first known as an anatomist by the dissection of an elephant which died near that place in He was a Nonjuror and so far attached to the exiled family as to have been imprisoned in the rebellion in as a suspected person He afterwards removed to  London  where he recommended himself to the  Royal Society  by some Discourses on the Sexes of Flowers His stay in  London  was not long he quitted it and settled at  Boston  in  Lincolnshire  where if I mistake not he practised physic during the remainder of his life I am not able to ascertain the time of his decease but I conjecture that it was soon after the publication of the Seventh  Decad  of his  Pharmacobotanologia  in  Dr BLAIR's first publication was intituled "Miscellaneous Observations in Physic Anatomy Surgery and Botanicks"  o  In the botanical part of this  work he insinuates some doubts relating to the method suggested by PETIVER and others of deducing the qualities of vegetables from the agreement in natural characters and instances the  Cynoglossum  as tending to prove the fallacy of this rule He relates several instances of the poisonous effects of plants and thinks the  Echium Marinum    Pulmonaria Maritima  Lin should be ranked in the genus  Cynoglossum  since it possesses a narcotic power He describes and figures several of the more rare  British  plants which he had discovered in a tour made into  Wales  e g The  Rumex Digynus Lobelia Dortmanna Alisma Ranunculoides Pyrola Rotundifolia Alchemilla Alpina  c  But the work by which Dr BLAIR rendered the greatest service to botany originated with his "Discourse on the Sexes of Plants" read before the  Royal Society  and afterwards greatly amplified and published at the request of several members of that body under the title of  BOTANICK ESSAYS  o  pp with four copperplates This treatise is  divided into two parts containing five essays The three first concerning what is proper to plants the two last what is common to plants and animals  Essay I On the Structure of Flowers The Distinction and Definition of the several Parts  Essay II Definition of the Fruit and the several Kinds  Essay III Of the different Methods of disposing Plants Analysis of the several Methods of Classification with Critical Remarks on each  Essay IV On the Generation of Plants The Concurrence of Sexes necessary Variety of Reasons in Favour of this Doctrine The several Opinions relating to the Nature and Use of the Farina Mr MORLAND's Opinion confuted  Essay V Of the Nourishment of Plants The  Folio Seminalia  The Vegetation of Annuals and of Trees and the Structure of the Parts explained That there is a Circulation of the Sap in Vegetables  Dr BLAIR's treatise as far as I can find was the first compleat work at least in the  English  language written on the subject and the author shews himself well acquainted in general with all the opinions and arguments of authors on the matter of each essay The value of these  Essays  must not be estimated by the measure of modern knowledge though even at this day they may be read by those not critically versed in the subject with instruction and improvement A view of the several methods then invented cannot be seen so connectedly exhibited in any other  English  author Dr BLAIR strengthened the arguments in proof of the Sexes of Plants by sound reasoning and some new experiments His reasons against MORLAND's opinion of the entrance of the  Farina  into the  Vasculum seminale  and his refutation of the Lewenhoekian theory have met with the sanction of the moderns If his theory of vegetation of the nourishment of plants and his arguments in favour of the circulation of the sap do not meet with the approbation of the present age it  must at least be granted that they are as rational in the principle of them as those of his predecessors  Pharmacobotanologia  or "An Alphabetical and Classical Dissertation on all the  British  Indigenous and Garden Plants of the New Dispensatory" Lond  o  The genera and species are described the sensible qualities and medicinal powers are subjoined and the pharmaceutical uses  In this work the author notices several of the more rare  English  plants discovered by himself in the environs of  Boston  The work was imperfect being carried no farther than the letter H  Dr BLAIR was the author of the following papers in the  Philosophical Transactions  The Anatomy and Osteology of an Elephant with an historical Account of that Animal N  o  Vol xxvii p and and Vol xxx p This Account was also separately published in  o  illustrated with figures  The heat of the weather when the animal died occasioned a precipitate dissection  but the rarity of the occasion added such zeal to the anatomist that it is matter of surprise that Dr BLAIR could so amply gratify the comparative anatomist as he has done in this paper He has supplied the deficiency of some articles and illustrated others from the History of the Dissection of an Elephant which perished at  Dublin  published by Dr MOULINS in  An Account of the  Asbestus  or  Lapis Amianthus  found in the county of  Angus  in  Scotland  N  o  Vol xxvii p  A Dissection of a Child emaciated N  o  Vol xxx p At five months old the child weighed only five pounds Dr BLAIR could find no vestige of the  omentum  and queries whether this atrophy might not originate in the want of that membrane The absence of this part was probably the consequence rather than the cause of this infant's disease  An Account of a Boy who lived a considerable Time without Food N  o  Vol xxxi p  A Method of discovering the Virtues of Plants by their external Structure N  o    Vol xxxi p Dr BLAIR thinks it probable that even the ancients were led in many instances by the comparison of the habit to ascribe similar virtues to plants and in others by the conformity in the sensible qualities

versed in  English  BotanyHis garden at  Eltham  Inscription on his monument  DR WILLIAM SHERARD  WILLIAM  SHERARD or  Sherwood  the son of  George Sherwood  of  Bushby  in  Leicestershire  was born in and educated at Merchant Taylors' School till he was entered at  St John's  College  Oxford  in the year Of this college he became a Fellow and took the degree of Bachelor of Law Dec After this time he accompanied  Lord Viscount Townshevd  in his travels and discharged  his trust with so much reputation that he was prevailed on to take the charge of  Wriothesly  grandson of  William  first  Duke of  BEDFORD and made a second tour to the continent with equal satisfaction to the noble family who confided in him  He returned from this tour as I conjecture about the year and communicated to Mr RAY a Catalogue of Plants which he had remarked on Mount  Jura Saleve  and the neighbourhood of  Geneva  This was published as a Supplement in RAY's "  Sylloge Stirpium Europaearum  " About this time we find he was in  Ireland  with his friend Sir  Arthur  RAWDON at  Moyra  of whom mention has been made in the article SLOANE  In travelling SHERARD gratified his favourite passion and formed connections with the most celebrated characters on the continent HERMAN BOERHAAVE and TOURNEFORT He was very early skilled in  English  botany and although his publications are few there is no doubt that he had bestowed great assiduity in the study of  English  plants Need I allege any farther  evidence than the obligations already mentioned which Mr RAY acknowledges for assistance in his "History of Plants" He travelled early into various parts of  England  and was ever attentive to make discoveries He made the tour of the West as far as into  Cornwall  He searched the island of  Jersey  and communicated a List of Plants to Mr RAY to be inserted in the first edition of the  Synopsis  printed in  He is said to have been the author of a book published under the name of  Samuel  WHARTON "  Schola Botanica sive Catalogus Plantarum quas ab aliquot Annis in Horto Regio Parisiensi Studiosis indigitavit Jos Pet  TOURNEFORT"  Amst    o  It was reprinted in and If indeed SHERARD was the author of this book he must have attended the lectures of TOURNEFORT three several seasons It contains a rude sketch of TOURNEFORT's Method of Botany exemplified in a large catalogue of plants among which are innumerable varieties some new species collected by TOURNEFORT himself in the  Pyrenaean  Mountains and others introduced by the care of M FAGON  It is to SHERARD also that the learned owe the publication of HERMAN's "  Paradisus Batavus continens plus centum Plantas affabre Aere incisas et Descriptionibus illustratas  "  o    Lugd Bat  He wrote a preface to this work in which he relates the difficulties he met with in reducing the author's papers into method and which contains an account of other works of HERMAN This preface is dated from  Geneva  in April at which time I apprehend SHERARD was on his third tour on the continent  In the year Mr SHERARD communicated to the Royal Society a Method of making several  China  Varnishes which were sent from the Jesuits in  China  to the Great Duke of  Tuscany  It was published in the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  Vol xxii p And the next year he communicated to the Society a paper from Dr J DEL PASSA on the poisonous Effects of the  Indian  Varnish on the human Skin which on the naked Skin of Poultry  proved quite harmless How soon after this time he was engaged in any public employment I cannot determine but in he was one of the commissioners for sick and wounded seamen at  Portsmouth  and I believe was soon after appointed consul at  Smyrna  a department which it is probable his desire of investigating the plants of the East had no small share in inducing him to accept But SHERARD's knowledge and taste was not confined to the study of botany Mr MARTYN informs us that  "in with  Antonio  PICENINI he visited the seven churches of  Asia  In and he transcribed the  Monumenta Teia  and caused the  Sigean  inscription to be copied and sent to  England  and the learned Dr CHISHULL dedicates his account of it to him"  He also sent an account of the island raised near  Santorini  in the  Archipelago  on the th of May which was printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  Vol xxii p  During his residence at  Smyrna  he had a country house at a place called  Sede    It is not yet forgotten as the residence of SHERARD In HASSELQUIST visited this retreat and viewed with all the enthusiasm of a young botanist the spot where  "the regent of the botanic world"  as he stiles him spent his summers and cultivated his garden Here SHERARD collected specimens of all the plants of  Natolia  and  Greece  and began that famous  Herbarium  which at length became the most extensive that had ever been seen as the work of one man since it is said finally to have contained species And here he is said to have begun the muchcelebrated  Pinax  to which he continued to make accessions throughout his life He returned into  England  in Soon after which time he had the degree of Doctor of Laws conferred upon him by the University of  Oxford  In Dr SHERARD communicated to the Royal Society an Account of the Poison Wood Tree of  New England  which he had received from Mr MORE It does not appear that the species had been ascertained till Dr SHERARD pointed it out as  the  Arbor Americana alatis Foliis  c Pluk Phytogr t f  Rhus Vernix  Lin This observation is printed in the  Phil Trans  N  o  Vol xxxi p  In this year he returned to the continent and made the tour of  Holland France  and  Italy  Whilst at  Paris  he found VAILLANT in a declining state of health but anxious to preserve his papers from oblivion VAILLANT had solicited BOERHAAVE to purchase and to publish them SHERARD negociated the business and spent the greatest part of the summer with BOERHAAVE in reducing the manuscripts into order To SHERARD therefore principally the learned owe the  Botanicon Parisiense  which was published in BOERHAAVE prefixed to this work a  Latin  letter written by Dr SHERARD giving an account of this transaction which is also more fully explained in the preface It was in this tour that being in search of plants in the  Alps  he narrowly escaped being shot by a peasant for a wolf  On his return he brought over with him the celebrated DILLENIUS with  whom he had before corresponded and whom he had encouraged to prosecute his enquiries into the  Cryptogamia  class and in publishing his  Plantae Gissenses  SHERARD had himself been among the earliest in  England  to promote attention to this hitherto neglected part of nature and in this DILLENIUS had already excelled all who had written before him  Although Dr SHERARD had acquired a considerable fortune in  Asia  yet he lived with the greatest privacy in  London  wholly immersed in the study of natural history except when he went to his brother's seat and fine garden at  Eltham  Dr DILLENIUS assisted him in his chief employment the carrying on his  Pinax  or Collection of all the names which had been given by botanical writers to each plant being a continuation of  Caspar  BAUHINE's great plan  Dr SHERARD was in a particular manner the patron of Mr  Mark  CATESBY and himself affixed the  Latin  names to the plants of "The Natural History of  Carolina  "  He died August and by his will gave three thousand pounds to provide a salary for a professor of botany at  Oxford  on condition that Dr DILLENIUS should be chosen first professor He erected the edifice at the entrance of the garden for the use of the professor and gave to this establishment his botanical library his  Herbarium  and the  Pinax  Dr SHERARD was among the last of those ornaments in  England  of that aera which LINNAEUS calls  "the golden age of botany"  Having from his earliest years a relish for the study of natural history and in his youth acquired a knowledge of  English  botany his repeated tours to the continent and his long residence in the East afforded ample scope for his improvement and the acquisition of affluence joined to his learning and agreeable qualities rendered him after his return home a liberal and zealous patron of the science and of those who cultivated it  VAILLANT first devoted the name  Sherardia  to a new genus which was afterwards assimilated with the  Vervain  About the same time DILLENIUS gave the like appellation in his  Flora Gissensis  to an  English  plant of the  Stellated  class in the system of RAY which retains its distinction in the  Tetrandrous  class of LINNAEUS    Some manuscripts of Dr SHERARD's were presented to the Royal Society by Mr ELLIS in the year  J SHERARD  James  the brother of  William  SHERARD was born in He practised physic as an apothecary in  London  and was early and strongly attached to his brother's favourite pursuit Having become eminent and opulent in his profession he cultivated at his country seat at  Eltham  in  Kent  one of the richest gardens that  England  ever possessed It was also the retirement of his brother the consul after his return from  Smyrna  and is immortalized by the pen of DILLENIUS Mr SHERARD is not known as an author but his name frequently occurs in RAY's  Synopsis  for his discoveries of rare  English  plants of which he had great knowledge as he is said to have had of natural history in general and his zeal for  botany was singularly great To these he added a relish for the elegant and

chronological course as well as by other associations to a character of the highest worth in botanical science That harmony of taste and cooperation of design which first connected SHERARD and DILLENIUS hath inseparably united their names as long as their works shall endure DILLENIUS though not an  Englishman  born is gratefully naturalized by a nation  to whose botanical fame he gave an eminence it had not experienced from the time of RAY It was no mean sacrifice to relinquish his country his friends his connexions and his prospects from a profession which is at least sometimes lucrative that he might devote himself to the culture of science in a foreign land where the extent of his views was most probably bounded by the precarious hope of a professorship alone  John Jacob  DILLENIUS  There is a letter extant written by DILLENIUS in in which he tells his correspondent  "I had once a mind to have spelled my name DILLEN it being easier to pronounce and to make my brother do the same for my great grandfather spelled it so and my great great grandfather DILL but considering that my name and my father's had been so often printed DILLENIUS I have left it as it is"  was born at  Darmstadt  in  Germany  in the year  It appears that he had his education principally at the university of  Giessen  a city of  Upper Hesse  and where probably his family had considerable interest and connexions since I find two of his contemporaries of the same name of whom one was  a professor of medicine and dean of the faculty of physic at that place and the other  Poliater  or public physician an office I believe not uncommon in  Germany  though unknown here and which DILLENIUS himself held in the same city He was very early made a member of the  Academia Curiosorum Germaniae  He communicated several papers to that society which were published in their  Miscellanea Curiosa  The earliest that I find was a Dissertation in the  Third Century of Observations  about the year concerning the plants of  America  which are naturalized in  Europe  This is a subject which might again be taken up by a skilful hand to great advantage The result of observation and communication on this matter would unquestionably prove that a far greater number of plants than we are aware of which are now thought to be indigenous in  Europe  were of exotic origin Besides the most obvious method from the garden to the dunghill and from thence to the field amongst a variety of other causes the importation of grain has introduced a great number the package of merchandise  and the clearing out of ships have been the means of dispersing many The  English Flora  as it now stands cannot contain fewer perhaps than sixty  acknowledged  species and a critical examination would probably investigate a much greater number  In the  Fourth Century  of the same work we find a critical dissertation on the  Cahve  coffee of the  Arabians  and on  European  coffee or such as may be prepared from grain or pulse DILLENIUS gives the result of his own preparations made with pease beans and kidney beans but says that from  rye  comes the nearest to true coffee and was with difficulty distinguished from it  In the  Sixth Century  he has described and figured four species of dubious plants three of the  Spergula  genus now  Arenariae  and a  Veronica  In the Appendix to this  Century  DILLENIUS gave the first specimen of his accurate examination of some plants of the  Cryptogamous  class which he afterwards pursued so greatly to the improvement of  botany In this paper DILLENIUS treats on the propagation of plants in general but more particularly on that of the  Ferns  or  capillary  plants and of the  Mosses  which had hitherto been considered as destitute of flower and seed He describes the flowers of that genus which he afterwards called  Lichenastrum  and which was named by MICHELI  Jungermannia  He delineates two of the  Chara  genus some of the  Confervae  and several of the more perfect plants particularly the  Chondrilla  He fixed the genus  Radiola Corrigiola  c and particularly the  Centunculus  and  Cameraria  which was afterwards called  Montia  To these he subjoins many curious observations on the use of the  petals  and  stamina  all tending to confirm the doctrine of the  sexes  of plants observations on the root of the  Equisetum  on the dust of the  Antherae  and on the different shape of that in the  Orchis  which he says is conical and of that in the  Ophrys  which is round  In the  Ninth Century  of the same work he relates an experiment he made concerning  the Opium which he prepared himself from the poppy of  European  growth  In the  Eighth Century  he appears as a zoologist in a paper on  Leeches  and describes two species of the  Papilio  genus  In he published his "Catalogue of Plants growing in the neighbourhood of  Giessen  " a work which established his character as one of the most accurate botanists of the age It bears the following title  "  Jo Jac  DILLENII  ML Ac Nat Cur Coll Catalogus Plantarum sponte circa Gissam nascentium cum Appendice qua Plantae post editum Catalogum circa et

contains the plants  of the neighbourhood confined to a circuit of not more than a  German  mile and a half Of this tract he has given a map in his book  The author has prefixed "A Critical Examination of the Methods of arranging Plants" published by RAY and KNAUT who had founded their classical distinctions on the  fruit  and of those published by RIVINUS and TOURNEFORT founded on the  flower  In the end he gave the preference to RAY's system and adhered to it throughout his life His criticism on RIVINUS brought upon him the resentment of the author at that time far advanced in years who answered his objections DILLENIUS had written in a stile that was but too reprehensible and can only be excused in some measure as natural to the warmth of a young author though it has been generally acknowledged that he had the advantage in the argument  Nothing can shew the early skill and indefatigable industry of DILLENIUS more strongly than his being able to produce so great a number of plants in so small a tract  He has not enumerated fewer than species of what were then called the more perfect plants that is exclusive of the  Mushroom  class and all the  Mosses  DILLENIUS entered minutely into the examination of this class and by his diligence and discoveries extended the bounds of that field which the  English  botanists had so successfully cultivated before him More had been done in  England  in this way than in any other nation The  Pinax  of  Caspar  BAUHINE contains but fifty species so little had the  Musci  been regarded before The first edition of RAY's  Synopsis  printed in not more than about eighty kinds whereas by the investigations of the  English  botanists particularly of DOODY SHERARD VERNON LLHWYD ROBINSON PETIVER BOBART and others this order was so far augmented in the second edition of the same work in as to contain upwards of species  DILLENIUS was however the first writer who examined them with a view to generical characters and divided the  Mosses  and  Mushrooms  each into separate  genera  It is in this book that we first meet with  Bryum Hypnum Mnium Sphagnum Lichenoides  and  Lichenastrum  as generical names The four first of these were terms in use with the  Patres Botanici  although neglected by the restorers of the science who had ranked all under the general term  Muscus  except the  Lichen Lycopodium  and  Polytrichum  To demonstrate his accuracy and diligence it may be observed that in the environs of  Giessen  alone DILLENIUS discovered more than species of  Mosses  of which were new of the  Mushroom  order he enumerates of which upwards of were such as he judged had not been noticed by any author before The plants in this catalogue are disposed in the order of flowering throughout all the year The places of growth are subjoined with critical observations on many of the species  The Appendix contains a list of twenty plants additional to those of the Catalogue discovered in the immediate environs of  Giessen  and an enumeration of upwards of species observed by the author beyond  the bounds circumscribed in the Catalogue This renders the book in a great measure a  Flora  of the plants of  Hesse  Then follows a description of the  new  species of the Catalogue These are succeeded by the establishment of his new  genera  of  Mosses Fungi  and a variety of others amounting to near of which some of former authors are here only amended but the far greater part are of his own constructing and entirely new and the parts of fructification separately delineated in copperplates This part of his work has been of great authority with succeeding writers and many of these characters have stood the test of the  Linnaean  system  The merit of this work fixed the character of the author as a perfectly scientific botanist and attracted the notice of all the eminent professors and admirers of the science among others that of Mr  William  afterwards Dr SHERARD to whom we owe that DILLENIUS was brought to  England  and in the end fixed in the professorship at  Oxford  SHERARD was at that time among the few who patronized and cultivated the science in  England  He was  lately returned from  Smyrna  and having regretted the neglect of the  Cryptogamia  class he was so enamoured with the discoveries of DILLENIUS in that branch that he entered into correspondence with him and procured specimens from him and afterwards brought him to  England  No man was more closely devoted to a favourite muse than DILLENIUS was to  Flora  and after his arrival in  England  he pursued his study with uncommon ardour and corresponding diligence The acquisition of so able a man was probably an additional motive with the Consul to attempt the revival of botany in the university of  Oxford  DILLENIUS came into  England  in August where he had not long resided before he undertook a work that was much desired that of publishing a new edition of the  Synopsis Stirpium Britannicarum  of RAY It had been last printed in and was become scarce DILLENIUS having firmly attached himself to RAY's system and even improved it in some parts though he intimates in one of his letters to a friend that he was not allowed to  make all the changes he wished for and being furnished with ample means of enlarging the book by his discovery of new species of  Cryptogamia  and by the establishment of new  genera  being also enabled by the discoveries of many ingenious men whose names he enumerates in the preface greatly to enlarge  English  botany and through the skill and assistance of Dr RICHARDSON Mr  James  SHERARD and others being sufficiently qualified to add the old  British  if I may so say to the  English  botany he published a third edition in much to the satisfaction of all the lovers of the science throughout  Europe  Twentyfour plates of rare plants were added to this edition and besides many valuable notes and emendations in the  genera  the addition of new species was very great The accumulation to this book from DILLENIUS's own discoveries and from the communications of others whose names are mentioned in the preface particularly those of Dr SHERARD and Dr RICHARDSON amounted to near new  Fungi  as many  Marine  plants upwards of  Mosses  and  considerably above other plants which had been discovered to be natives of  Britain  since the publication of the second edition the whole number of  British  plants being about as they stand in this book But here it may be observed that botanists had not at that time sufficiently established specific distinctions and this number could not stand the test of the  Linnaean  rules which has since reduced the number to fewer than  DILLENIUS seems to have divided his time before his establishment at  Oxford  principally between the country residence of Mr  James  SHERARD at  Eltham  in  Kent  the Consul's house in town and his own lodgings which in the year were in  Barking Alley  In the year Dr THRELKELD published his  Synopsis Stirpium Hibernicarum  in which he had introduced some severe strictures on DILLENIUS principally levelled at the introduction of his new generical names He also inveighs against him for unnecessarily multiplying the species of  plants See the articles  Anagallis aquatica Dens Leonis Lichenoides Muscus trichoides Stellaria  c DILLENIUS though displeased with the harsh and coarse language of THRELKELD's criticisms had temper enough to forbear entering into any controversy on this occasion He probably did not think THRELKELD's objections of any force sufficient to influence men of judgment in the science as the  Irish  botanist had but little regarded any true principles of generical distinction In a letter he wrote soon after the publication of the  Irish Flora  after complaining of the grossness of THRELKELD's censures he informs his correspondent that there was but one plant recited in the book which was not known before as a native of  Ireland  This he adds is the  Pseudostachys Alpina  of  Caspar  BAUHINE  Stachys Alpina  Lin and this he had inserted on the authority of Mr HEATON's manuscript  About this time he had it in contemplation to publish a new edition of the  Synopsis  with the addition of the old  British  names  and the times of floweringan article neglected in the former editions This design was laid aside and an  Appendix  intended for which ample materials were in hand received from different quarters particularly from Dr RICHARDSON of  North Bierly  in  Yorkshire  and from Mr BREWER who had resided two seasons at  Bangor  purposely to investigate and collect the plants of  Snowdon  and the neighbouring parts BREWER was very successful in his researches and sent at different times great numbers of scarce plants to DILLENIUS This  Appendix  also miscarried In the mean time all these exertions were favourable to the purpose he ever had in view of completing the  Historia Muscorum Wales  was a productive source of new subjects in this way and DILLENIUS availed himself of BREWER's researches  Whatever might be the precise nature of his engagement with the  Consul  it appears that DILLENIUS being doubtful of the success of the  Oxford  scheme had formed a design of residing some time  if not finally settling in  Yorkshire  In a letter to a correspondent of that county dated Dec he writes thus  "Pray Sir how is it to board in that country if I have done here and  Oxford  fails as its likely it may do I could resolve to go and live there some time if not for good and all if any small business should encourage it"  Ever since his residence in  England  his employments had been various and important and his assiduity as distinguished as his abilities Since his arrival in he had published the  Synopsis  of which he designed if he did not himself engrave all the figures He soon after began the  Hortus Elthamensis  He collected materials for a new edition of or Appendix to the  Synopsis  He never lost sight of his  Historia Muscorum  Additional to all which the business of the  Pinax  appears to have been pursued with vigour In a letter dated Dec he says  "We have entered almost all authors but to put it in order and to write it fair will require some years still"  In August his friend and patron  Consul  SHERARD died in consequence of whose will his establishment at  Oxford  took place soon after the university waving the right of nomination in consideration of Dr SHERARD's benefaction  CHAP  Dillenius  established in the professorship of botany at  Oxford  Publishes the

of the  Fungusses  His death and character  DILLENIUS  DILLENIUS was now arrived at that situation which had probably been the main object of his wishes and which he considered equally as the completion of his hopes the asylum against future disappointments and the field of all that gratification for which his taste and pursuits prompted him to wish and qualified him to enjoy Add to all this he was placed in the society of the learned in the completest sense of that word and at the fountain of every information which the stores of both antient and modern erudition could display to an inquisitive mind  The plan of the  Hortus Elthamensis  had been laid so early as the year immediately after publishing the  Synopsis  and some of the plants were figured and described before Dr SHERARD's death The work was now carried on with vigour and was printed in under the following title  "HORTUS ELTHAMENSIS  seu Plantarum rariorum quas in Horto suo Elthami in Cantio coluit Vir ornatissimus et praestantissimus Jacobus  SHERARD  MD Soc Reg et Coll Med Lon Soc Gulielmi PM Frater Delineationes et Descriptiones quarum Historia vel planè non vel imperfectè à Rei herbariae Scriptoribus tradita fuit Auctore Johanne Jacobo  DILLENIO  MD  "  Lond Fol  pp  Tab    In this elegant and elaborate work of which LINNAEUS says "  est opus botanicum quo absolutius mundum non vidit  " are described and figured with the most circumstantial accuracy plants all drawn and etched with his own hand consisting principally of such exotics as were then rare or had been but lately introduced into  England  A few of the more rare  English  and  Welch  plants were included They are disposed in the alphabetical order The figures are of the natural size as much as may be The  synonyma  of former authors are quoted and accompanied by copious critical examinations and observations the better to ascertain the species Several new  genera  are established many of the new  Gerania  are figured and a very copious history of the  genus Mesembryanthemum  given with a synoptical view of all the species of which fiftyfour are described and figured in this work  The plates of the  Hortus Elthamensis  were afterwards sold to a  Dutch  bookseller who cast off an impression accompanied with the denominations only of the species This was done at  Leyden  in and many copies have found their way into this kingdom    We find by the list of graduates that DILLENIUS was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Physic in  St John's College  April  In the summer of LINNAEUS visited the Professor at  Oxford  and although DILLENIUS did not relish the sexual system about that time first divulged yet LINNAEUS returned with the highest opinion of  his merit and as I have observed on another occasion expressed himself in these terms  "  In Anglia nullus est qui genera curat vel intelligat praeterquam  DILLENIUS"  LINNAEUS after this time corresponded with him sent him his  Flora Lapponica  and dedicated to him the  Critica Botanica  On which occasion the Professor sent his acknowledgments in the following terms in a letter dated Aug  "  Vidi accepi et legi Floram tuam Lapponicam multa cum voluptate utinam plures istiusmodi nobis prostarent tali studio et cura elaboratae in hac te virum praestitisti  "  During this period DILLENIUS held frequent correspondence and communication with HALLER whom he esteemed probably the more on account of the affinity of his system with that of RAY which he had himself adopted It appears that he considered HALLER as almost the only man qualified to carry on the  Pinax  and wished him to have been his successor  About this time he was employed with Dr SHAW in reducing to order and ascertaining that learned traveller's collection of  Oriental plants As they were all dried specimens and the collection extensive consisting of species it required the aid of an able hand to distinguish and apply synonyms to so considerable a number This catalogue therefore which is annexed with the engravings of a few of the plants to the first edition of Dr SHAW's elaborate work may be considered eventually as the work of the botanical Professor  After the completion of the  Hortus Elthamensis  he pursued his "History of Mosses" with great diligence It has been observed before that he had extended his researches into this part of nature much further than any preceding botanist having been the first discoverer of a great number of species and having separated those heretofore described together by the general term  Muscus  into several  genera  under the names of  Sphagnum Fontinalis Bryum  and  Hypnum  taking his distinctions as well from the  habit  of the plant to which the accurate HALLER thought he paid too much regard as from the figure and situation of that part of the sructification which is  now considered as the  capsule  By means of the excellent botanical library of the SHERARDS and free access to their ample  Herbarium  and that of Mr DU BOIS who had with Mr DOODY and several others signalized themselves by their discoveries this way some years before DILLENIUS enjoyed advantages which perhaps no other situation could have afforded Besides which to give himself all further opportunities that  Britain  allowed of making discoveries in this department he took a journey himself into  Wales  in the summer of In this excursion he was attended by  Samuel  BREWER They examined  Cader Idris  and took up their residence at  Bangor  searched  Snowdon Glyder  the  Isle of Anglesea  and visited the  Iste of Man  Mr GREEN a clergyman of those parts was useful in directing their researches and in assisting DILLENIUS in the  Welch  names of places and of plants The Rev  Littleton  BROWN MA Fellow of the Royal Society is also commemorated as having communicated many specimens of the  Cryptogamous  tribe to our author collected by  him in  Wales Shropshire  and  Herefordshire  and thus by the communications of these and many other friends whose aid he has gratefully acknowledged  The names of several foreigners appear in this list Dr AMMAN of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at  Petersburgh Olaus  CELSIUS Professor of Divinity at  Upsal  Dr  J Frederick  GRONOVIUS of  Leyden  Dr HALLER Professor at  Gottingen  and LINNAEUS himself  he was enabled to bring his work to that degree of perfection which would have been impracticable in many other situations In it was published from the  Sheldon  press under the following title  "HISTORIA MUSCORUM  in qua circiter sexcentae Species veteres et novae ad sua Genera relatae describuntur et Iconibus genuinis illustrantur cum Appendice et Indice Synonymorum Opera Jo Jac  DILLENII  MD in Universitate Oxoniensi Botanices Professoris  SHERARDINI"  o  pp  Tab    All the subjects of this volume were drawn and engraved with his own hand It comprehends all those plants which  come under the name of  Musci  and  Algae  in the  Cryptogamia  class of the sexual system except the  Fucuses  some of the  Ulvae Confervae  and a very few others The author's method is throughout as follows at the head of each genus he gives the etymology of the name his reasons for adopting that name and applying it to the subject then the definition of his genus followed by the subordinate distinctions for the arrangement of the species  In treating on each species he gives A new specific character in terms intended to distinguish it from others of the same genus or subdivision The description of the species at length distinguishing also with great care the several varieties and referring each to the several figures on his plates The general places of growth and under the more rare species the particular places where they have been found or from whence he had received them to these is subjoined the time when each is found in heads or in its most flourishing state The synonym of every author at length disposed in chronological order  noticing at the same time such as are referable to varieties and frequently subjoining a number of critical observations The uses of particular kinds whether in the general oeconomy of nature or in medicine or the other arts and conveniences of life A summary view of the uses of several kinds appears in the preface but in the body of the work DILLENIUS has with great diligence collected numerous authorities on these heads which sufficiently evince that this almost unnoticed tribe of vegetables hold a more considerable importance  Numerous proofs of the truth of this observation occur in the various writings of modern botanists I refer the reader to the  Flora Lapponica  and  Suecica  to HALLER's  Historia Stirpium Helvetiae  to the  Amoenitates Academicae  particularly to those papers under the titles of  Oeconomia Naturae  and  Usus Muscorum  I may perhaps be allowed to refer also to a  Memoir  which I was induced to collect some years ago on the  Lichens  alone which was printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  vol On the uses of the same genus may also be consulted  Tentamen  Historiae  Lichenum et praesertim Prussicorum  of HAGEN printed at  Koninsberg    o  but above all the  Memoires couronnés en l'année    par l'Academie des Sciences Belles Lettres et Arts de Lyons sur l'Utilité des Lichens dans la Medicine et dans les Arts par MM  HOFFMAN AMOREUX  fils et  WILLEMET  o    in the scale of utility than a superficial view may suggest  When we consider the minuteness of the objects of his investigation the accuracy of his descriptions the critical examination and nice discrimination of each species the labour and skill the author has exhibited in the selection of the  synonyma  and the disposition of them into chronological order which is a highly meritorious part of the plan "The History of  Mosses  " must be considered as a very extraordinary performance and notwithstanding any subsequent improvements in the arrangement of species or in the reduction of them in consequence of more perfect observations or even in the microscopical discoveries of HEDWIG respecting the  Genera  DILLENIUS's work must long be the basis of knowledge in this part of nature and must remain with posterity as an almost unexampled instance of patience ingenuity and science in the author This work moreover possesses a superiority over every other botanical publication  that I am acquainted with in having a complete index of the  synonyma  at length An addition of the highest utility in works of this kind and which those who are conversant with the writings of LINNAEUS cannot but regret the want of in the  Species Plantarum  The whole impression of DILLENIUS's "Mosses" was only copies of which were on imperial paper The original edition having become extremely scarce  Posterity will scarcely believe that at the time of the publication of this work and during the life of the author the demand for books of natural history was so small in  England  that one guinea was thought a sufficient price for this book At this period ten is not deemed too much and not long since a copy with the plates coloured by DILLENIUS himself was sold for twenty guineas or upwards  an impression of the plates with the names only annexed was taken off in the year and published by  John Millan  I here remark that this was the first book printed in  England  in which any of the  Linnaean  specific characters were exhibited Both the  Flora Lapponica  and the  Hortus Cliffortianus  are quoted in this volume  There is little doubt that DILLENIUS intended to have prosecuted the  Fungusses  as he had done the  Mosses  and he appears to have had this design in contemplation early after he came to  England  In a letter written in Dec he informs his correspondent that  "He was busy in painting  Fungi  "  and makes this employment an apology for not answering his letters in due time We know that he corresponded with Dr DEERING on this subject who was himself well skilled in the knowledge of these productions and had painted a great number some of which he communicated to the Professor  I have been informed that Dr DILLENIUS was of a corpulent habit of body this circumstance united to his close application to study probably tended to shorten his days He was seized with an apoplexy in the last week of March and died on the d of April in the th year of his age  There is a portrait of him in the picture gallery or school at  Oxford  in which he is represented in the academical habit  with this inscription  Jacobus  DILLENIUS  MD Botanices Professor primus in Academia Oxonienfi  but I have never heard that any engraving was made from it  The drawings dried plants printed books and manuscripts c of DILLENIUS came into the hands of Dr SEIDEL as his executor of whom Dr SIBTHORP purchased them Among these are all the  British Fungusses  drawn and painted by DILLENIUS himself besides a large collection of such nondescript  Fungi  as were discovered subsequent to the publication of the  Synopsis  Some drawings also of the more perfect plants done by DILLENIUS but many of them unfinished DILLENIUS coloured some copies of the  Hortus Elthamensis  himself one of which he presented to the  Bodleian  library  From information obligingly communicated by Dr John  SIBTHROP  the present learned Professor at Oxford    I have never been able to acquire that information my curiosity hath prompted me to wish for relating to the domestic character habits temper and dispositions of Dr DILLENIUS Of those whom I have conversed with who were his contemporaries I have learned that he was modest temperate and gentle in all his conduct that he was known to few who did not seek him and as might be expected from the bent of his studies and  the close application he gave to them that his habits were of the recluse kind If it be allowable to form any opinions of men from the perusal of their letters some that I have seen written by him would suggest that he was naturally endowed with a placid disposition improved by a philosophical calmness of mind which secured him in a considerable degree from the effects of the incidental evils of life I will at least lay before the reader in the note  "For my little time I have met with as many adversities and misfortunes as any body which by the help of exercise amusement and reading some of the Stoic philosophers I have overcome and am resolved that nothing shall afflict me more Many things here as well as at my home that hath happened to me would cut down almost any body But two days ago I had a letter acquainting me with a very near relation's death whom I was obliged to assist with money in his calamities in order to set him up again in his business and now this is all gone and there is something more for me to pay and which is not a little for  me  but it does not at all affect me I rather thank God that it is not worse This is only one and I have had harder strokes than this and there lies still some upon me Feb "    a transcript from one of his letters written to a friend labouring under the pressure of adverse fortune which seems to confirm this idea  If in the commemoration of celebrated men by the application of their names to new  genera  any comparative dignity or symbolical allusion was ever to be observed it became in the highest degree decent that to DILLENIUS should be appropriated one of the most splendid of the vegetable race LINNAEUS had unquestionably this analogy in view when he gave to this illustrious botanist the  Syalita  of the "Malabar Garden" a  Polyandrous Tree  distinguished for its beautiful large flowers and fine fruit and not less for its considerable use in medicinal and oeconomical purposes    CHAP  Dr  Richardson  the correspondent of  Sloane  and of  Dillenius  a diligent investigator of  English  plantsCommunications to the  Royal Society  Brewer  the

RICHARDSON  AMONG those whom DILLENIUS has recorded in the preface to the third edition of RAY's  Synopsis  and in his  Historia Muscorum  as having amplified  English  botany the names of the SHERARDS and of Dr RICHARDSON obtain a superior distinction The merit of Dr RICHARDSON both from his undoubted skill in the science and his well known patronage of those who cherished it demand a more particular commemoration than I am able to give  since I am unacquainted with any further circumstances relating to him than that he was educated a physician and lived at  North Bierly  in  Yorkshire  There he resided upon his own estate which was ample enough to render the practice of physic totally unnecessary to his wellbeing from any lucrative views He had travelled into various parts of  England  for the investigation of plants and had been successful in his tour into  Wales  having more especially made discoveries in the  Cryptogamia  class His garden was well stored with exotics and with a curious collection of  English  plants He was happily situated to favour his possession of the latter with which his store was replenished from time to time by the assistance of  Samuel  BREWER and  Thomas  KNOWLTON both instances of strong attachment to botanical pursuits and both resident in the same county  Dr RICHARDSON lived in intimacy and correspondence with Sir  Hans  SLOANE Dr DILLENIUS and other celebrated botanists of his time I do not find that he published on his favourite amusement but his  name occurs in the  Philosophical Transactions  as author of the following

the year  BREWER  I reluctantly pass over the names of many others mentioned in the  Synopsis  whose services although they were not writers on the subject might justly call for respectful notice but not being able to produce any satisfactory or interesting anecdotes relating to them I must content myself with referring the reader to a list of them collected with no small pains by the present Professor of Botany at  Cambridge  and published in the Preface to his  Plantae Cantabrigienses  Having however mentioned the name of  Samuel  BREWER his connection with DILLENIUS will not allow me to refuse a proper tribute to his memory since his passion for  English  botany and his skill and assiduity enabled him to afford singular assistance to the Professor particularly in the subjects for his "History of  Mosses  " as in  some instances he had done in the  Synopsis  for the plants of  Mendip  and  Chedder Rocks  He was originally of  Trowbridge  in  Wilts  in which county he had a small estate He was engaged at one time in the woollen manufactory of that place but I believe proved unsuccessful in business He attended DILLENIUS into  Wales Anglesey  and the  Isle of Man  in the summer of and afterwards remained the winter and the greater part of the next year in that country making his residence at  Bangor  and taking his excursions to  Snowdon  and elsewhere often accompanied by the Rev Mr GREEN and Mr  William  JONES While in  Wales  it was intended that he should have gone over to  Ireland  to make a botanical tour through that kingdom but that expedition never took place So long a residence gave him an opportunity not only of seeing the beauties of summer plants but of collecting the  Cryptogamia  in winter when they flourish most Here he received instructions from the Professor collected specimens of every thing  rare or unknown to him before and sent them to DILLENIUS to determine the species and fix the names I have seen a catalogue of more than two hundred plants many of which were ill ascertained before all sent at one time with the references to the  Synopsis  affixed by DILLENIUS This journey appears to have been designed to promote the "  Appendix  to the  Synopsis  "  In Mr BREWER went into  Yorkshire  and resided I believe the remainder of his days at  Bradford  in that county in the neighbourhood of Dr RICHARDSON by whose beneficence he was assisted in various ways After his retirement into  Yorkshire  he meditated and nearly finished a work which was to have borne the title of "The Botanical Guide" but it never appeared I cannot determine the time of his decease but am assured he was living in the year  HARRISON  At a somewhat later period we find the name of  Thomas  HARRISON a tradesman at  Manchester  who furnished DILLENIUS  with specimens for his history In his younger years he had collected a large  Herbarium  I have been informed by one who inspected it in the year that it contained at that time near specimens including both exotic and indigenous plant  Among the latter the  Filices  were the most complete part the other  Cryptogamia  being but few and the collection in general not rich in  British  species In order to accommodate the specimens to the largest sized paper luxuriant plants of the smaller kinds had been chosen a circumstance disadvantageous to the distinctions of such plants  Mr HARRISON's  Herbarium  hath I believe since been purchased at a considerable price and is deposited in the  Manchester  library  COLE  Mr  Thomas  COLE another of the correspondents of DILLENIUS was a dissenting minister at  Gloucester  of whom I have heard the following anecdote That he had collected an  Herbarium  which in a flight of  religious zeal and repentance at having mispent his time in accumulating he committed to the flames Mr COLE certainly forgot at that moment that the key to useful science is the knowledge of things To collect the productions of nature in order to admire and contemplate in his works the great Author of all is in itself surely not only innocent but laudable and when the view is extended to the utility of man still more meritorious If the sight of Mr COLE's collection might teach but one peasant to distinguish that plant which could alleviate his own or the affliction of his neighbour or his friend surely it had not been made in vain  CHAP  Rise of Botany in  IrelandBoateHeatonSilliardMolyneuxLlhwyd  and  Sherard  all prior to  Threlkeld  Memoirs of  Threlkeld  His  Synopsis Stirpium Hibernicarum  An account of that work  Ireland  not sufficiently examined  Keogh  's Herbal  Smith  's County Histories  IRISH BOTANY  IRELAND  has been so little distinguished for the production of writers on the subject of these sketches that it has not been in my power till this late period to introduce to the reader's notice any professed work on the  Flora  of that kingdom The distracted state of the country during a great part of the last century had doubtless no small share in retarding the progress of learning and science among the  Irish  It does not appear that until the middle of that period any enquiries had been made even into the natural history of the country in general  Gerard  BOATE a  Dutch  physician began "  Ireland  's Natural History" which was published by  Samuel  HARTLIB in  o  Of this the th th and th chapters treat on Agriculture But the second part of the work in which the author intended to have given the Vegetables was never published if indeed it was ever written  There is a Mr  Zanche  SILLIARD an apothecary of  Dublin  mentioned by PARKINSON who seems to have possessed some botanical knowledge But the earliest intelligence that I can find of any real botanist a native of  Ireland  is of a Mr HEATON a divine who lived at  Dublin  I cannot collect any anecdotes of him but I find his name attached as the first discoverer to many plants in HOW's  Phytologia  and to some in MERRETT's  Pinax  and from the number and rarity of the subjects recorded he must have been a person of considerable knowledge in his way It appears from the same authorities that he had been much in  England  having pointed out the natural places of many rare plants  of this country He is thought to have left a manuscript on the subject which it is conjectured was written about the year and from which THRELKELD took the  Irish  names of plants who says they were much more copious and exact than he could collect from any living authority In the number of plants it greatly exceeds any list we have extant of the old  British  names or of those in the  Erse  tongue among the  Highlanders  Towards the latter end of the century some information was received relating to the natural history of  Ireland  from the tour of Dr LLHWYD as recorded in the  Philosophical Transactions  and Dr  William  SHERARD on his visits to Sir  Arthur  RAWDON at  Moyra  noticed many of the rare plants of that region  Soon after this time the establishment of the  Philosophical Society  at  Dublin  contributed to advance among other sciences that of natural history and of those who exerted themselves to promote these pursuits were the two brothers Dr  William  and Dr  Thomas  MOLYNEUX Their  papers are numerous and are extant in the  Philosophical Transactions  Dr  Thomas  MOLYNEUX was professor of physic in the university of  Dublin  and physician to the state and to the army About the beginning of this century he drew up some account of the spontaneous vegetables of  Ireland  which evidence that he had applied to the study in a scientific manner  He communicated his papers to Dr THRELKELD who incorporated some of them into the body of his  Synopsis  and placed the remainder at the end Of Dr THRELKELD I now proceed to give some account  THRELKELD  Caleb  THRELKELD the author of the first treatise on the plants of  Ireland  was born the st of May at  Keiberg  in the parish of  Kirkoswald  in  Cumberland  In the year he commenced master of arts in the university of  Glasgow  and soon after settled at  Low Huddlesceugh  near the place of his birth in the character of a dissenting minister He had acquired a  taste for botany and physic during his residence at  Glasgow  and continued to make a considerable progress in these studies insomuch that in he took a doctor's degree in physic at  Edinburgh  and the next spring having a straight income and a large family he removed to  Dublin  and settled there in the united character of the divine and physician Finding himself likely to succeed in little more than a year he sent for his family consisting of a wife three sons and three daughters His practice as a physician soon increased so far as to enable him to drop his other character entirely and devote himself wholly to physic In he published his "SYNOPSIS STIRPIUM HIBERNICARUM" and died after a short sickness of a violent fever at his house in  Mark's Alley Frances Street  April and was buried in the new burial ground belonging to  St Patrick's  near  Cavan Street  to which place his obsequies were attended by a set of children educated by a society of gentlemen to which institution he had acted as physician And my memorialist adds that he was much regretted  by the poor to whom he had been both as a man and as a physician a kind benefactor  It does not appear that Dr THRELKELD published any other work than the following though he meditated a general history of plants  "SYNOPSIS STIRPIUM HIBERNICARUM  alphabetice dispositarum five Commentatio de Plantis indigenis praesertim Dublinensibus instituta  Being a short Treatise of Native Plants especially such as grow spontaneously in the vicinity of  Dublin  with their  Latin English  and  Irish  Names and an Abridgment of their Virtues with several new Discoveries With an Appendix of Observations made upon Plants by Dr MOLYNEUX Physician to the State in  Ireland  The first Essay of the Kind in the Kingdom of  Ireland Auctore  CALEB THRELKELD MD  Dublin  "  o  pp  The author after a dedication to the Archbishop of  Armagh  and a preface which though written in a quaint stile proves him to have been a man of some  erudition in the science enumerates all the plants he had observed in the environs of  Dublin  and of all such as he had gained authentic intelligence from other parts of the kingdom He gives first the old  Latin  names generally from  Caspar  BAUHINE's  Pinax  then the  English  name and afterwards the  Irish  subjoining some account of the quality of the plant and its use in medicine and oeconomy  He has moreover interspersed some curious observations to instance under the  Betula  or Birch Tree he says  "The  Irish  grammarians remark that all the names of the  Irish  letters are names of trees"  Under  Brassica  he observes  "That the word is only the  Celtic Praisseagh  put into a  Latin  termination the  Latin  being no other than the  Celtic  language cloathed with the Aeolic dialect as  English  is the  Saxon  or  Dutch  language cloathed with  Normandy French  as all antiquaries will allow"  It is observable that THRELKELD notices the good effects of the  Lythrum Salicaria  in a dysentery a simple since his  time so strongly recommended by  De  HAEN  See  Rationis Medendi  vol i p  in the same disorder and in obstinate diarrhoeas He also speaks in high terms and from his own experience of the powers usually attributed to the  Menyanthes trifoliata  or Bogbean He quotes from Dr VAUGHAN a case of the fatal effect of the Mackenbay or  Euphorbia Hyberna Dr  MOLYNEUX has observed that the  Genista spinosa  or Whins Ulex europeus  Lin  although common in other parts of  Ireland  is not seen in the province of  Connaught  A singular fact if the observation be sufficiently accurate  In the  Appendix  printed from the papers of Dr MOLYNEUX the reader meets with several curious observations Among others an instance of the effects of the roots of  common Henbane  upon several persons who having eaten them instead of skirrets were affected with vertiginous symptoms and in one case a frenzy ensued which held the person two or three days The work concludes with the  Index  of Irish names of  plants from the manuscript supposed to have been written as heretofore observed by Mr HEATON  THRELKELD's  Flora  is not rich in the number of plants since it does not contain more than species The author appears to have been better acquainted with the history of plants than with plants themselves and seems not to have studied botany in a systematic way as may be inferred from his strictures on the third edition of RAY's  Synopsis  noticed under the article DILLENIUS  KEOGH  "  Botanologia Universalis Hibernica  or A General  Irish  Herbal calculated for this Kingdom giving an Account of the Herbs Shrubs and Trees naturally produced therein in  English Irish  and  Latin  with a true Description of them and their Medicinal Virtues and Qualities By  John  KEOGH AB Chaplain to the Right Hon the Lord  Kingston Corke  "  o    Not having seen this work I cannot give the reader any further information relating to it  SMITH's HISTORIES  In the  County Histories  of  Ireland  published under the direction of the Physicohistorical Society of  Dublin  by  Charles  SMITH we meet with catalogues of the rare plants in each district These lists however not being drawn up with sufficient knowledge of the subject want that authenticity which the critical botanist would expect and have not greatly enlarged the botany of  Ireland  In that of "The antient and present State of the County of  Down  "  o  the author speaks of the  Savin  as indigenousa privilege which will scarcely be allowed to it in that kingdom although Dr MOLYNEUX and after him THRELKELD had recorded it When it is recollected for what nefarious purposes it was originally introduced into many gardens it may readily be conjectured to be the perpetuated offspring  of original culture in a favourable situation  In that of "The County of  Waterford  " many very common plants and a considerable number of the marine species There occurs also a case confirming the poisonous quality of the  Hemlock Dropwort  In that of "The County of  Cork  " vols  o  several of the  Alpine  and other rare plants occur such are the  Dryas octopetala Sedum dasyphyllum Euphorbia hyberna  but what will the critical botanist say when he sees in this list the  Androsaemum Ascyron  Ireland  may with reason be proud to enumerate among its choice productions of  Flora  the  Arbutus  of  Killarney  nevertheless its right as an aboriginal is with great probability of truth contested by Mr SMITH in his "History of the County of  Kerry  "  o  in which he considers it as having been introduced by the Monks of  St Finnian  who founded the abbey in the sixth century  I conclude my remarks on  Irish  botany with observing that the varied clime the  different site of the country throughout  Ireland  its mountains lakes creeks and moors unquestionably afford scope to a great variety of vegetables and the poverty of THRELKELD's  Flora  has left a rich harvest to the  Irish  botanist for notwithstanding the considerable time elapsed since the publication of his book and the laudable attempts of the  Dublin  Society I know not that  Ireland  has since been examined by any person of acknowledged abilities in the science What might not such an adventurer expect from a country which nurtures on its mountains the  Andromeda Daboecia  the  Dryas octopetala  and the  Saxifraga umbrosa  of the  Alps  and on the borders of its enchanting lakes the  Arbutus Unedo  of  Greece  CHAP  Martyn  Memoirs

library and  Herbarium  to the UniversityWritings  Tabulae SynopticaeMethodus PlantarumDecades quinque  Translation from  Tournefort  His  Virgil  MARTYN  AT the dawn of learning the seeds of botany had been first sown in  England  by Dr TURNER at  Cambridge  They can scarcely however be said to have germinated until a century afterwards under the fostering care of Mr RAY By his cultivation they took root although not invigorated by public support In the mean time through the munificence of the Earl of DANBY  Oxford  experienced the benefit of a public institution in aid of this science and botany flourished under the care of MORISON  After his time to the establishment of DILLENIUS it languished no publication marked its progress and its history at  Oxford  is void of interesting facts Nearly the same languor prevailed after the time of Mr RAY at  Cambridge  and botany attained no strength till the time of Dr MARTYN who under the patronage of the university gave the first public lecture in that department in the year  Of this learned botanist I am now in the order of time to present the reader with some account and here I find myself agreeably anticipated by the relation of his life and writings prefixed to his "Dissertations on the Aeneids of VIRGIL" printed in  o  and drawn up by his most respectable son and successor in the professorship with whose friendship and correspondence I have on this occasion a sincere pleasure in acknowledging I have long been honoured Hence I shall briefly recite from these anecdotes only the leading circumstances in the life of Dr MARTYN as connected with his professorial character and conclude with a short account of his botanical writings  John  MARTYN was born in the city of  London  Sept and was designed by his father for the profession of a merchant but his early and strong propensity to learning and science in the end overruled that design He had from his youth an attachment to botany and this taste was further excited by his acquaintance with Mr WILMER afterwards demonstrator at  Chelsea  Garden and confirmed by an intimacy with and the countenance of Dr SHERARD in the year In the year he translated from the  French  Dr TOURNEFORT's "History of the Plants growing about  Paris  " and having projected a like catalogue of the plants about  London  he collected with unwearied diligence the native plants of the environs making for this purpose sometimes very extensive excursions and almost ever on foot He had once conceived a scheme for forming a method from the  Seedleaves  and had sown a great number of seeds in order to observe the difference between them He early became acquainted with DILLENIUS and cooperated with him in forming a society  of botanists which consisted of seventeen members This society kept together till the year He continued during the years and to make his excursions in search of plants more frequent and extended them farther into  Middlesex Surrey Essex  and  Kent  At the same time he studied Insects continued his observations on the Seedleaves and made many others on the Sexes of Plants He had several years before this time translated from the  Latin  an ode on that subject presented to CAMERARIUS and printed in that Author's epistle  De Sexu Plantarum  The translation may be seen in BLAIR's "Botanic Essays"  In the summer of he travelled into  Wales  by  Bath  and  Bristol  returning by  Hereford Worcester  and  Oxford  by which he extended the objects of his studies and augmented his collection of  English  plants insomuch that at length it comprehended specimens  In and he read lectures in botany in  London  and was recommended by Dr SHERARD and Sir  Hans  SLOANE to exercise the same function at  Cambridge  where on the death of BRADLEY he was chosen Professor of Botany and continued to give lectures for several years until the want of a garden and his long absence from the business of physic which he had engaged in rendered it incommodious to him  In Dr MARTYN was admitted a member of the Royal Society and was so active in the committee for regulating the library and museum in that he had his bond for annual payment cancelled by an order of council as an acknowledgment of his services  In he was admitted of  Emanuel  College with an intention to have proceeded regularly with the degrees in physic but his marriage and his attention to the practice of the profession prevented him from finishing his design In the mean time he read lectures in Botany and the  Materia Medica  both at  Cambridge  and in  London  in the years and In the beginning of the year he was elected Professor of Botany by the unanimous voice of the university  Dr MARTYN had practised physic for three years in the city but on account of an asthmatic complaint removed in the year to  Chelsea  where he continued the exercise of that prosession until his retirement to  Streatham  in In he resigned his professorship and soon after in gratitude for the favour of having chosen him and his son after him to this post he presented to the university his botanical library consisting of upwards of volumes his  Hortus Siccus  of Exotics containing specimens near drawings of  Fungi  his collection of Seeds and Seed Vessels and his  Materia Medica  He removed to  Chelsea  about a year before his death which event took place on the th of January  The Professor was the author of the following publications  TABULAE SYNOPTICAE  Plantarum Officinalium ad Methodum Raianam dispositae  fol pp Dedicated to Sir  Hans  SLOANE  METHODUS PLANTARUM  circa Cantabrigiam nascentium    o  pp  This is Mr RAY's Alphabetical Catalogue reduced to the order of his system with the generic characters taken from RAY's  Methodus emendata et aucta  from VAILLANT DILLENIUS SCHEUCHZER and others much improved and corrected by Mr MARTYN's own observations All the plants of Mr RAY's two  Appendices  of and now become extremely rare amounting to species are inserted in this manual which was printed for the use of his pupils on his first reading lectures at  Cambridge  A sheet and an half of a new edition containing more than species not contained in RAY's Catalogue was printed as part of a new edition but it was not carried farther these were  Submarine Plants Funguses Mosses Capillaries Apetalous  and  Juliferous Plants  And as the genius of RAY still continued to animate his successors the  Cambridge Flora  has since been much augmented and improved not only by the skill and assiduity of the present Professor and the labours of the late Mr LYONS but more recently still by the  diligent researches and accurate discriminations of the Rev Mr RELHAN  HISTORIA PLANTARUM RARIORUM  Decades quinque  Fol max This was the most sumptuous and magnificent work of the kind that had ever been attempted in  England  It was dedicated to the Royal Society and was designed to contain such curious plants as had not been figured before in their natural size and colours with the descriptions and the culture and uses The extraordinary expence of this work prevented its progress The plates were mezzotinto and printed in proper colours These Decads among many other rarities contain several  Gerania  the  Milleria Martynia Gronovia Turnera  several  Passiflorae Cassiae  and many  NorthAmerican  plants  In having entertained a design of reading a course of lectures at  Oxford  he published "The first Lecture of a Course of Botany being an Introduction to the rest"  o  pp tab It is an explanation of the technical terms of the science  In the year Dr MARTYN as hath been observed had made a Translation of TOURNEFORT's "History of Plants about  Paris  " and at the same time meditated a Catalogue of those of the environs of  London  The latter was never finished nor was the Translation published till twelve years afterwards when it appeared under the following title "TOURNEFORT's History of Plants growing about  Paris  with their Uses in Physic and a Mechanical Account of the Operation of Medicines Translated into  English  with many Additions and accommodated to the Plants growing in  Great Britain  " In vols  o    "The Six Alphabets" of TOURNEFORT are reduced into one all the useful observations both from the edition which came out by the united care of SHERARD and BOERHAAVE and from that which was published by  Bernard de  JUSSIEU are extracted The Translator added also the  English  names and the places where the plants grow in  England  He disposed the  Mosses  according to DILLENIUS's method  and the  Mushrooms  and  Capillary Plants  after a new method of his own  Of the papers published by Dr MARTYN in the  Philosophical Transactions  the following have relation to the subject of this work  Rare Plants observed in a Journey into the Peak of  Derbyshire  N  o  Vol xxxvi p and In this paper the Author has taken occasion to separate the  Lactuca sylvestris murorum flore luteo  of BAUHINE and RAY from that genus and gives it the name of  Scariola  LINNAEUS justifies the distinction but calls the genus  Phrenanthes  An Account of a new Species of  Fungus  N  o  Vol xliii p with a Figure Dr MARTYN classed this singular production among the  Boleti  He takes the opportunity in this paper of exhibiting a Synoptical Table of his distribution of the whole order of  Fungi  of which it is sufficient to say that it does not materially differ from that of DILLENIUS The figure was copied in BLACKSTONE's  Specimen Botanicum  and the  Fungus  has been considered  by the author of the  Flora Anglica  as a variety of the  Clavaria Hypoxylon  Lin  A Remark concerning the Sex of Holly Vol xlviii p Dr MARTYN first observed the Holly Tree to be  Dioecious  in his own garden at  Streatham  in  Surry  Dr WATSON Mr MILLER and subsequent botanists not only found his observations true but discovered that the same trees bore also hermaphrodite flowers This occasioned the removal of it in the  Flora Anglica  to the class  Polygamia  But as it does not appear that the remaining species of the  Ilex  are subject to the same change the genus stands in the works of LINNAEUS in the  Tetrandrous  class as before  It is not without the strictest justice that the term indefatigable is applied to this learned man His avocations from business were wholly devoted to the cause of literature which he contributed to serve in various ways The numerous works he was engaged in and the variety of his manuscript remains amply testify this truth At one time he was concerned in a periodical paper He was a coadjutor with Mr EAMES  in abridging the  Philosophical Transactions  and was employed in writing the first three volumes of the "General Dictionary" in which the lives of BELLONIUS BOCCONE and BRUNSFELSIUS were written by him He translated BOERHAAVE's "Treatise on the Powers of Medicine" HARRIS's "Treatise on the Acute Diseases of Infants" and jointly with Mr CHAMBERS gave in volumes in octavo in a Translation or rather an "Abridgment of Philosophical Papers from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at  Paris  "  Dr MARTYN was the author of thirteen papers printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  His Translation of the  Georgics  and  Bucolics  of VIRGIL with his notes upon this his favourite poet hath extended his fame among the learned of all nations To the classical reader in general they afford ample satisfaction but to those who join to such elegant enjoyment a knowledge of the learned Editor's favourite science these volumes must afford a gratification which they will in vain seek for elsewhere His great knowledge both of antient and modern  science relating to plants enabled him to appropriate the modern appellations with a degree of judgment that has been highly approved of by those who know the difficulty of the undertaking under that almost total want of specific distinction which occurs in the writings of the ancients  In the year our Author entered into correspondence with LINNAEUS It is one of those notices that can only occur to a lover of similar studies that he was if not the first at least one of the earliest  English  writers who announced the northern genius to the  British  reader This was done by the Professor's extract from the  Flora Lapponica  printed in the edition of the  Georgics  in It was some years afterwards before the system of the  Swede  made any progress in  England  I shall only remark further that besides the obligations which literature in general owes to this learned Professor that which I call more strictly  English  botany received considerable augmentation from his labours particularly from his methodizing "The  Cambridge  Catalogue" of Mr RAY and from the additions he made to his Translation of TOURNEFORT's book  The name of  Martynia  was given to a fine plant of the second order in the  Didynamous  class by Dr HOUSTON who discovered it on the continent of  America  It is well known at present as an ornament to the  English  stoves    CHAP  Catesby  Memoirs ofHis strong attachment to natural historyResides first in  Virginia  seven yearsand encouraged

strictly rank among the improvers of indigenous botany yet I cannot pass over in silence a man to whom the science owes one of its most elegant and superb productions Mr  Mark  CATESBY was I believe one of those men whom a passion for natural history very early allured from the interesting pursuits of life and it led him at length to cross the  Atlantic  that he might read the volume of nature in a country but imperfectly explored and where her beauties were displayed in a  more extended and magnificent scale than the narrow bounds of his native country exhibited It is but too true that the world at large will for ever treat with ridicule and disdain that man who thus deserting the paths that lead to riches to preserment or to honour gives himself up to what are commonly deemed unimportant and trifling occupations Few will give him credit for that secret satisfaction for that inexhaustible pleasure which the investigation of nature in all her objects incessantly holds forth to his mind or believe that such employment can possibly compensate for the solid treasures of gain  Mark  CATESBY was born about the latter end of or the beginning of the next year He acquaints us himself that he had very early a propensity to the study of nature and that his wish for higher gratifications in this way first led him to  London  which he emphatically stiles  "the center of science"  and afterwards impelled him to seek further sources in distant parts of the globe The residence of some relations  in  Virginia  favoured his design and he went to that country in where he staid seven years admiring and collecting the various productions of the country without having laid any direct plan for the work he afterwards accomplished During this residence he communicated seeds and specimens of plants both dried and in a growing state to Mr DALE of  Braintree  in  Essex  and some of his observations on the country being communicated by this means to Dr  William  SHERARD procured him the friendship and patronage of that gentleman On his return to  England  in he was encouraged by the assistance of several of the nobility of Sir  Hans  SLOANE Dr SHERARD and other naturalists whose names he has recorded to return to  America  with the professed design of describing delineating and painting the more curious objects of nature  Carolina  was fixed on as the place of his residence where he arrived in May He first examined the lower parts of the country making excursions from  Charles Town  and afterwards sojourned for some time among the  Indians  in the mountainous regions at and about  Fort Moore  He then extended his researches through  Georgia  and  Florida  and having spent nearly three years on the continent he visited the  Bahama Islands  taking his residence in the  Isle of Providence  carrying on his plan and particularly making collections of fishes and submarine productions  On his return to  England  in the year his labours having met with the approbation of his patrons Mr CATESBY made himself master of the art of Etching and retiring to  Hoxton  employed himself in carrying on his great work which he published in numbers of twenty plants each The first appeared in the latter end of the year and the first volume consisting of plates was finished in the second in and the Appendix of twenty plates in the year  A regular account of each number written by Dr  Cromwell  MORTIMER Secretary of the Royal Society was laid before the  Society as it appeared and printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  in which the Doctor has sometimes interspersed illustrative observations  See  N  o  for Vol i N  o  for Vol ii and N  o  for the Appendix  The whole work bears the following title "The Natural History of  Carolina

the most beautiful trees shrubs and herbaceous plants that adorn the gardens of the present time Many also of the most useful in the arts and conveniences of life and several of those used in medicine are here for the first time exhibited in the true proportion and natural colours It is only to be regretted that in this work a separate exhibition of the flower in all its parts should be wanting in

that birds lie torpid in caverns and at the bottom of waters he produces a variety of reasons and several facts  which his residence in  America  offered in support of their migration in search of proper food His voyages across the  Atlantic  had taught him the ability of these wanderers to take long flights He mentions in another place his having seen Hawks Swallows and a species of  Owl  in

 was greatly enriched by his means If I err not Mr HOUSTON went first to the  West Indies  in the character of a surgeon and upon his return after two years residence at  Leyden  took degrees in physic under BOERHAAVE This was in and At  Leyden  he instituted a set of Experiments on Brutes some  of which were made in concert with the late celebrated  Van  SWIETEN They were afterwards published in the  Philosophical Transactions  Vol xxxix under the title of "  Experimenta de Perforatione Thoracis ejusque in Respiratione Effectibus  " The result of which proved contrary to the commonly received opinion that animals could live and breathe for some time although air was freely admitted into both cavities of the thorax  It appears that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society soon after his return from  Holland  and that he went immediately to the  West Indies  I am not able to ascertain his fixed residence in that part of the world although I conjecture it was principally at the  Logwood Settlement  from whence he sent a description and figure of the  Dorstenia Contrayerva  which were published in the  Philosophical Transactions  Vol xxxvii This was the first authentic account received of that drug although known in  England  from the time of Sir  Francis  DRAKE or earlier He also sent to his friend at  Chelsea  the seeds of many rare and  new plants collected by him in the islands of  Jamaica  and  Cuba  in the province of  Venezuela  and about  Vera Crux  He fell a sacrifice to the heat of the climate and died in July He left in manuscript a Catalogue of Plants collected by himself in the places above mentioned together with some engravings done by his own hand These came into the hands of Mr MILLER and after his decease into the possession of Sir  Joseph  BANKS who out of respect to the memory of so deserving a man gratified the botanists with the publication of them under the following title  "RELIQUIAE HOUSTONIANAE  seu

system as far as possible  The name of HOUSTONIA is given by GRONOVIUS to a  Tetrandrous  genus found in  Virginia  known to the elder authors and somewhat allied to the  Stellated  class of RAY    DOUGLAS  Of the  genera  constituted by HOUSTON we find the  Douglassia  in honour of  James  DOUGLAS FRS a celebrated surgeon and anatomist afterwards MD and honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians and Physician to Queen  Caroline  whom it is just to introduce into these anecdotes since he obtained a reputable rank among those who in botany have been stiled "Monographers" from having separately written on a single species or genus He published a very scientific description of the  Amaryllis sarniensis  under the title of "  Lilium sarniense  or a Description of the  Guernsey  Lily

the florists and botanists This phenomenon will appear less wonderful in our days when it is known from the elegant work of Dr THUNBERG that from the congeniality of climate between  England  and  Japan  onefourth part of the indigenous plants of that very distant country appear to be also natives of  England  In his "Observations on the Coffee" Dr DOUGLAS observes that it was first mentioned by RAUWOLF in and first sent into  Europe  to CLUSIUS See  Clus Exotic  p  Dr DOUGLAS besides many papers on Pathological and Surgical subjects written between the years and which  were printed in the

PlantsCultivation of Madder  Communications to the  Royal Society  THE increasing cultivation of exotics in  England  from the beginning of the present century and the greater diffusion of taste for the elegancies and luxuries of the Stove and Greenhouse naturally tended to raise up a spirit of improvement and real science in the arts of culture To preserve farfetched rarities it became necessary to scrutinize into the true principles of the art which ultimately must depend on the  knowledge of the climate of each plant and the soil in which it flourishes in that climate  Under the influence of such men as SLOANE the SHERARDS and other opulent encouragers of the science gardeners acquired botanical knowledge and were excited to greater exertions in their art Hence I believe the  English  gardeners have shewn themselves equal if not superior to most others My plan does not allow me to deviate so far as to cite authors on the subject of gardening unless eminent for their acquaintance with  English  botany Some have distinguished themselves in this way and I cannot omit to mention with applause the names of FAIRCHILD KNOWLTON GORDON and MILLER The first of these made himself known to the Royal Society by some "New Experiments relating to the different and sometimes contrary Motion of the Sap" which were printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  Vol xxxiii p He also assisted in making experiments by which the sexes of plants were illustrated and the doctrine  confirmed Mr FAIRCHILD died in November  KNOWLTON  Thomas  KNOWLTON was in the earlier part of his life gardener to Consul SHERARD but I find him in that station at  Lonesborough  in  Yorkshire  in the service of the Earl of BURLINGTON in the year in which place I believe he spent the greater part if not the whole of the remainder of his life His zeal for  English  botany was uncommonly great and recommended him successfully to the learned botanists of this country From Sir  Hans  SLOANE he received eminent civilities He merits notice in these memoirs were it only to record his discovery of that singular production the Globe  Conferva  or Moor Balls  Conferva Aegagrophila  Lin which he first found in  Wallingfen Mere  I have read a letter from him to a correspondent written in the year and another in in one of which he relates his having waded near a quarter of a mile into the lake to collect them which is not done  without some difficulty as they lie at the depth of from two to three feet At another time he was more successful and collected near a bushel at once He describes them to his friend under the name of  Pillas  or globular Balls of Moss of the size of a tennis ball  Mr  Thomas  KNOWLTON was a man of general curiosity and observation and amongst other matters not inattentive to the pursuits of the antiquary  We find Extracts of Two Letters from him "to Mr  Mark  CATESBY FRS concerning the Situation of the ancient Town  Delgovicia  and of two Men of an extraordinary Bulk and Weight"  Phil Trans  Vol xliv p This  Roman  station was discovered on the Wolds within two miles of  Pocklington  Also  "An Account of two extraordinary Deers Horns found under

adjudged  to be the horns of the Moose Deer so frequently dug up in  Ireland  and were thought to be the first of the kind discovered in  England  Mr KNOWLTON died in the year at the advanced age of ninety  GORDON  James  GORDON of Mile End eminent for his successful cultivation of exotics was well acquainted with  English  botany I know not that he made himself known by any publications He maintained a correspondence with LINNAEUS and had the respect paid to him by the late Mr ELLIS of having the  Loblolly Bay  of CATESBY called by his name when separated from the  Hypericum  genus  MILLER  Philip  MILLER was born in the year His father was gardener to the Company of Apothecaries at  Chelsea  and his son succeeded him in that office in the year He raised himself by his merit from a state of obscurity to a degree of  eminence but rarely if ever before equalled in the character of a gardener It is not uncommon to give the term of Botanist to any man that can recite by memory the plants of his garden Mr MILLER rose much above this attainment He added to the knowledge of the theory and practice of gardening that of the structure and characters of plants and was early and practically versed in the methods of RAY and TOURNEFORT Habituated to the use of these from his younger years it was not without reluctance that he was brought to adopt the system of LINNAEUS but he was convinced at length by the arguments of the late Sir  William  WATSON and Mr HUDSON and embraced it To his superior skill in his art the curious owe the culture and preservation of a variety of fine plants which in less skilful hands would have failed at that time to adorn the conservatories of  England  His objects were not confined to exotics few were better acquainted with the indigenous plants of which he successively cultivated most of the rare species  He maintained a correspondence with many of the most eminent botanists on the continent among others with LINNAEUS who said of his Dictionary  Non erit Lexicon Hortulanorum sed Botanicorum  By foreigners he was emphatically stiled  Hortulanorum Princeps  He was admitted a member of the Botanical Academy of  Florence  and of the Royal Society of  London  in which he was occasionally honoured by being chosen of the council Mr MILLER was the only person I ever knew who remembered to have seen Mr RAY I shall not easily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance it so strongly expressed the  Virgilium tantum vidi  when in speaking of that revered man he related to me that incident of his youth  Mr MILLER's infirmities induced him to resign his office in the Garden a little time before his decease which took place December in the th year of his age He left a very large  Herbarium  of Exotics principally the produce of the  Chelsea  Garden  In the year Mr MILLER communicated to the Royal Society "A Method of raising some Exotic Seeds which have been judged almost impossible to be raised in  England  "  Phil Trans  N  o  Vol xxxv p This consisted in suffering the Seeds to germinate in a bark bed and then transplanting them into earth By this method he succeeded with all the hardshelled fruits and seeds He instances the Cocoa Nut the Bonduc or Nickar Tree  Guilandina Bonduc  Lin the  Abrus precatorius  the Horse Eye Bean  Dolichos urens  and several others  "An Account of Bulbous Roots flowering in Bottles filled with Water" N  o  Vol xxxvii p This method of procuring early Hyacinths Tulips and Narcissuses at that time lately discovered is now well known and daily practised  Although he did not prefix his name to it he was the author of "A Catalogue of Trees Shrubs and Flowers which are hardy enough to bear the cold of our climate and the open air and are propagated  in the gardens near  London  " Fol p tab The plates are coloured the arrangement is alphabetical and the generical characters given The Catalogue consists chiefly of Trees and Shrubs among which are several of the  Coniferous  kinds Some varieties are interspersed  "CATALOGUS PLANTARUM OFFICINALIUM  quae in Horto Botanico Chelseiano aluntur  "  o  pp  In he published his "Gardener's Dictionary" in folio which has passed through many successive editions in each of which it received such improvements and augmentations as have rendered it in the end the most complete body of gardening extant It has been translated into various languages and the reception it has every where met with is a sufficient proof of its superiority The new edition of it now under the care of Professor MARTYN we doubt not will extend to a late period the reputation both of the author and of the editor  In the same or the succeeding year he published "The Gardener's Kalender" in  o    which has run through numerous editions and has been a manual in its way for the whole kingdom To an edition of this work in the author prefixed "A Short Introduction to the Knowledge of the Science of Botany" in which he explains the  Linnaean  terms of art and illustrates the characters of the classes in five copperplates This introduction was also sold separately  Mr MILLER held an extensive correspondence with persons in distant parts of the globe From the  Cape of Good Hope  from  Siberia  from  North America  and particularly by means of Dr  William  HOUSTON from the  West Indies  his garden for a long series of years received a plentiful and perpetual supply of rare and frequently of new species which his successful culture seldom failed to preserve It was the remark of foreigners that  Chelsea  exhibited the treasures of both the  Indies  These advantages enabled MILLER to execute what it was in the power of few to attemptHis "Figures of Plants adapted to his Dictionary" which he began to publish in  numbers in and which were completed in tables making two volumes in folio in were drawn from plants of his own garden His original design was very extensive no less than to give one or more species of all the genera but it was found to be impracticable and it was therefore confined to such as were the most beautiful useful and uncommon Each number was accompanied with several pages of letterpress containing the descriptions and an account of the classes to which they belong according to the systems of RAY TOURNEFORT and LINNAEUS As this work is well known I shall only observe that whether we consider the rarity of the subjects the speciousness of those he selected for his purpose or the general execution of the whole  England  had not before produced any work except the  Hortus Elthamensis  and CATESBY's  Carolina  so superb and extensive In one respect MILLER's plates had the advantage of the above mentioned as they exhibited much more frequently the separate figures of the parts of fructification  "The Method of cultivating Madder as it is practised by the  Dutch  in  Zealand  "  o  Intended to excite the  English  by the cultivation of this important article of trade to supersede the importation of it from the  Dutch  who have  "received from hence for many years past more than pounds a year for this root"  and which if properly carried on would  "employ a great number of hands from the time harvest is over till the spring which is generally a dead time of the year"  "A Letter to Mr WATSON relating to a Mistake of Professor GMELIN concerning the  Spondylium vulgare hirsutum  " CB  Phil Trans  Vol xlviii p  MILLER adduces several reasons to prove that the common  CowParsnep  of  Siberia  which the inhabitants make an article of food is not the common  CowParsnep Heracleum Spondylium  of  Caspar  BAUHINE but the  Spondylium maximum  of BREYNIUS and further remarks the mistakes that have arisen from considering the  common  plants of one country as the  common  plants of another On which occasion  he observes that the  Parietaria  so frequent in  England  is not the  Parietaria Officinarum  of  Caspar  BAUHINE but the  P Ocymi folio  of that author In this supposition however we may observe that Mr MILLER has not been followed by  English  botanists of later date  "A Letter to the Rev  Thomas  BIRCH DD Secretary to the Royal Society"  Phil Trans  Vol xlix p And  "Remarks upon the Letter of Mr  John  ELLIS FRS to  Philip Carteret  WEBB Esq" in Vol l p  These letters relate to a discovery made by the Abbé MAZEAS and the Abbé SAUVAGES on the black staining quality of three several species of  American  Sumach Neither the lixivium of wood ashes nor boiling water with soap had any effect in weakening the tinge made by the juices of these plants They were The Poison Ash or  Toxicodendrum Carolinianum foliis pinnatis  Rhus vernix Lin  Toxicodendron triphyllum folio sinuato pubescente  Tourn Rhus Toxicodendrum  Toxicodendrum triphyllum glabrum  Rhus radicans Mr MILLER considers the  Abbe's discovery as having been long before anticipated by KAEMPFER and adduces many reasons to prove that the  Sitzdsiu  or  Arbor vernicifera legitima  p fig of that author or the Varnish Tree of  Japan  is no other than the first of these species of which the staining quality is recorded by KAEMPFER This position drew Mr MILLER into a controversy with Mr ELLIS who strongly insisted that the  American  and  Japanese Toxicodendra  were different plants Mr MILLER defends his opinion in the "Remarks" It is sufficient at this time to observe that subsequent botanists of the first note such as LINAENUS REICHARD and THUNBERG have countenanced MILLER's opinion by placing them under the same specific distinction with the  Rhus vernix  The MILLERIA was a new genus discovered at  Panama  and  Vera Cruz  by HOUSTON It belongs to the  Syngenesious  class and was dedicated to MILLER by Dr MARTYN in his  Decades Plantanum

Singular instance of his ardour to acquire botanical knowledgeHis  Synopsis of British Plants  BLACKWELL  IT is a singular fact that physic is indebted for the most complete set of figures of the medicinal plants to the genius and industry of a lady exerted on an occasion that redounded highly to her praise  The name of Mrs  Elizabeth  BLACKWELL is well known both from her own  merit and the fate of her unfortunate husband who condemned for crimes of state suffered death on the scaffold in  Sweden  in the year  We are informed she was the daughter of a merchant in the neighbourhood of  Aberdeen  of which city Dr  Alexander  BLACKWELL her husband was a native and where he received an university education and was early distinguished for his classical knowledge By some he is said only to have assumed the title of Doctor after his successful attendance on the King of  Sweden  but I believe the more probable account is that of his having taken the degree of Doctor of Physic under BOERHAAVE at  Leyden  After having failed in his attempt to introduce himself into practice first in  Scotland  and afterwards in  London  he became corrector to a printing press and soon after commenced printer himself But being prosecuted by the trade and at length involved in debt was thrown into prison To relieve these distresses Mrs BLACKWELL having a genius for drawing and painting exerted all her talents and  understanding that an Herbal of Medicinal Plants was greatly wanted she exhibited to Sir  Hans  SLOANE Dr MEAD and other physicians some specimens of her art in painting plants who approved so highly of them as to encourage her to prosecute a work by the profits of which she is said to have procured her husband's liberty after a confinement of two years  Mr RAND an eminent apothecary was at that time Demonstrator to the Company of Apothecaries in the Garden at  Chelsea  By his advice she took up her residence opposite the Physic Garden in order to facilitate her design by receiving the plants as fresh as possible He not only promoted her work with the public but together with Mr  Philip  MILLER afforded her all possible direction and assistance in the execution of it After she had completed the drawings she engraved them on copper and coloured the prints with her own hands  During her abode at  Chelsea  she was frequently visited by persons of quality and many scientific people who admired her  performances and patronized her undertaking  On publishing the first volume in she obtained a recommendation from Dr MEAD Dr SHERARD Mr RAND and others to be prefixed to it And being allowed to present in person a copy to the College of Physicians that body made her a present and gave her a public testimonial of their approbation with leave to prefix it to her book The second volume was finished in and the whole published under the following title  "A curious Herbal containing Cuts of the most useful Plants which are now used in the Practice of Physic engraved on folio copperplates after drawings taken from the life By ELIZABETH BLACKWELL To which is added a short Description of the Plants and their common Uses in Physic " vol fol  The drawings are in general faithful and if there is wanting that accuracy which modern improvements have rendered necessary in delineating the more minute parts  yet upon the whole the figures are sufficiently distinctive of the subject  Each plate is accompanied with an engraved page containing the  Latin  and  English  officinal names followed by a short description of the plant and a summary of its qualities and uses After these occur the name in various other languages These illustrations were the share her husband took in the work This illfated man after his failure in physic and in printing became an unsuccessful candidate for the place of Secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Learning He was made Superintendant of the Works belonging to the  Duke of  CHANDOS at  Cannons  and experienced those disappointments incident to projectors He formed schemes in agriculture and wrote a treatise on the subject which we are told was the cause of his being engaged in  Sweden  In that kingdom he drained marshes practised physic and was even employed in that capacity for the king At length he was involved in some state cabals or as some accounts have it in a plot with  Count  TESSIN for which  he lost his life protesting his innocence to the last  So respectable a performance as Mrs BLACKWELL's attracted the attention of physicians on the continent TREW of  Norimberg  in the year engaged an artist of that place to copy Mrs BLACKWELL's plates and himself supplied several defects in the drawings He substituted some entirely new figures in the room of the originals very considerably reformed and amplified the text translated it into  German  and  Latin  and planned the addition of a sixth century of plates He prefixed a most elaborate and learned Catalogue of Botanical Authors but did not live to finish the work The Fifth Century was published in and Dr TREW dying in the supplemental volume exhibiting plants omitted by Mrs BLACKWELL articles newly introduced into practice and figures of the poisonous species was conducted by LUDWIG BOSE and BOEHMER and printed in Thus reformed TREW's edition surpasses any other work of the same design If there are imperfections in it  they were unavoidable arising from the impracticability of procuring recent specimens in some instances and from an almost total ignorance of the origin of others defects still unsupplied in various articles  DEERING  Charles  DEERING was a native of  Saxony  He took his degrees in physic at  Leyden  and as Mr MARTYN informs us came to  England  first in the train of a foreign ambassador This happened I conjecture before or about the year He practised physic and midwifery in  London  and having a strong bias to the study of botany became one of the members of the society established by Dr DILLENIUS and Mr MARTYN which subsisted from the year to  In the year he removed to  Nottingham  under the recommendation of Sir  Hans  SLOANE At this time he was married but his wife did not long survive the removal to that place He was at first well received and is said to have been very successful in his treatment of the smallpox  which disease was highly epidemical at that place soon after his settling there But he incurred the censure of the faculty by his pretensions to a nostrum He published "An Account of an improved Method of treating the Smallpox in a Letter to Sir  Thomas  PARKYNS Bart"  o  pp By this tract it appears that his medicine was of the antiphlogistic kind and his regimen the cool one which at that time had been adopted by very few as general practice  Dr DEERING shewed his attachment to his botanical pursuits by his assiduity in collecting such ample materials for his Catalogue in less than two years after fixing at  Nottingham  He published it under the following title  "A CATALOGUE OF PLANTS naturally growing and commonly cultivated in divers Parts of  England  more especially about  Nottingham  containing the most known  Latin  and  English  Names of the several Plants the Tribe they belong to the Time of their flowering and of those which are either Officinals or otherwise  of any known Efficacy such

particularly attached to the subjects of the  Cryptogamia  class in which his researches had been very successful Of the number above mentioned more than belonged to the orders of  Fungi Musci  and  Algae  among which we meet with which he considered as  nondescripts  and others not to be met with in the third edition of RAY's  Synopsis  He was assisted in this branch by his correspondence with the learned Professor at  Oxford  who considered some of his discoveries as new and speaks of his knowledge and assiduity in terms of applause In page of his posthumous  work the  Nottinghamia Vetus et Nova  there occurs a list of some plants discovered by the author after the publication of this Catalogue These are principally of the  Cryptogamous  kind Several of the more rare plants of the environs escaped the observation of this assiduous man among which may be mentioned particularly that most virulent of all our  English  productions the  Cicuta virosa  or longleaved Water Hemlock which I remember to have seen growing in the  Leen  near the  Rockholes  in  Nottingham  Park That the  Addenda  to his "Catalogue" were not more copious may be attributed to his subsequent misfortunes which undoubtedly damped the ardour of his pursuit  Notwithstanding his early success that  "adverse fatality"  which he himself alludes to in his "Letter on the Smallpox" still attended him He was unhappily not endowed with that degree of prudence and equanimity of temper which are so necessary to the practice of physic insomuch that he very early lost the little interest which his character and success had at first gained  But as I would rather dwell on his merits than on his failings I shall observe that besides his acquaintance with the antient languages he was master of many of the modern tongues His knowledge of that science which gives him a place in this sketch was very considerable and will be perpetuated so long as DILLENIUS's "History" shall preserve estimation He had a knowledge of designing and was an ingenious mechanic After his failure in Physic his friends attempted several schemes to alleviate his necessities They procured him among others a commission in the regiment raised at  Nottingham  on account of the rebellion But this proved more honourable than profitable to him He was afterwards employed in a way more agreeable to his genius and talents being furnished with materials and enabled by the assistance of  John  PLUMTREE  Esq  and others to write the History of  Nottingham  which he dedicated to the  Duke of  NEWCASTLE But he did not live to receive the reward of this labour He had been troubled with the gout at a very early period having been afflicted  with it in his nineteenth year and in the latter stage of his life he suffered long confinements in this disease and became asthmatical Being at length reduced to a degree of poverty and dependance which his spirit could not sustain oppressed with calamity and complicated disease he died April Two of his principal creditors administered to his effects and buried him in  St Peter's  churchyard opposite the house in which he resided  He left an  Hortus Siccus  of the plants of his "Catalogue" consisting of upwards of species in eight volumes of the quarto form besides separate tables of the  Mosses  and a volume of paintings of the  Fungi  accurately done by his own hand Some part if not the whole of this collection was I believe purchased by the Honourable  Rothwell  WILLOUGHBY who had been one of his benefactors while living and inherited a portion of that taste which distinguished his family in the time of Mr RAY He left also a manuscript treatise in  Latin De Re obstetricaria  His posthumous work was published by his administrators  George  AYSCOUGH

the Remains of Antiquity and collected from authentic Manuscripts and ancient as well as modern Historians adorned with beautiful copperplates By  Charles  DEERING MD  Nottingham  "  o  pp  It is embellished with copperplates among which are a plan and two views of the town a ground plan of the old castle two views of the present castle the three churches and many other buildings A view of the "Rockholes" in the park supposed by Dr STUKELEY to have been the work of the  Britons  enlarged and altered by the  Saxons  But one of the most remarkable articles in this volume is a complete description of that curious machine the stockingframe invented two centuries ago by  William  LEE MA of  St John's  College  Cambridge  a native of  Woodborough  near  Nottingham  I know not that so full an account of this complicated machine is elsewhere to be seen All the parts are separately and minutely described in the technical terms and illustrated by two views of the whole and by a large table delineating with great accuracy every constituent part of the machine  WILSON  The subject of this article like  Thomas  WILLISEL and  Samuel  BREWER is another instance of that unconquerable attachment to a favourite branch of knowledge which sometimes engrosses the minds of those who by their lot have not been exempted from labouring in the lower and mechanical offices of life  From information which I received more than twenty years ago concerning  John  WILSON I learned that he was originally an inhabitant of  Kendal  in  Westmoreland  and was employed in the manufacture of knit stockings for which that town was so famous That at one time he gave weekly  lessons on botany alternately at that place and at  Newcastle  That many pupils resorted to him from the neighbouring parts of  Scotland  insomuch that in some seasons he received sixty pounds a year as the premium of his labours  I must not however omit to observe that this account does not coincide with another which I have since met with in the "  British  Topography" the respectable author of which informs us  "That WILSON was a shoemaker and by his intense application to his favourite study lived most of his life in a state of indigence A cow of which his wife had the care was the sole support of his family and such was his infatuation that he was once tempted to part with that most useful animal to purchase MORISON's voluminous work had not a neighbouring lady presented him with the book and rescued the poor man and his family from beggary and ruin"  In this representation of WILSON's conduct while men of sympathizing minds  and similar taste must deplore that hard fate which reduced him to such necessity they must yet more strongly censure a rashness which could tempt him to risk in so essential a manner the welfare of his family  As WILSON exhibited to the public a singular proof of his knowledge in this his principal object I am inclined to believe that he must originally either have had some grammar education or impelled by his genius must afterwards have acquired a knowledge of the  Latin  language How else except on the supposition of extraordinary assistance of which I have no information could he have made use of MORISON's "History" or have translated RAY's  Synopsis  In he published "A SYNOPSIS OF BRITISH PLANTS in Mr RAY's METHOD with their Characters Descriptions Places of Growth Time of Flowering and physical Virtues according to the most accurate Observations and the best modern Authors together with a Botanical Dictionary illustrated  with several Figures By  John  WILSON  Newcastle upon Tyne  "  o  pp  Throughout this work the author has prefixed copious characters to each genus taken as it appears from RAY and TOURNEFORT into many of which in conformity to RAY's method he introduces the form of the leaves and the habit of the plant By this means having added in most instances short descriptions of the species his book was an useful pocket manual as far as it extended for he begins with the Capillary plants and ends with the Bulbous rooted He subjoins the particular places of the rare plants in the northern parts of  England  from his own observations and partly from a manuscript of Mr LAWSON's His remarks on the properties and virtues additional to those from RAY he has principally extracted from MILLER's "  Botanicum Officinale  "  WILSON has made some transpositions in the distribution of his subjects in this volume which prove that he had attentively examined plants and was well acquainted  with the system of RAY Some of his alterations will stand the test of modern accuracy though others may be less happy  He has placed all the species of the  Fumaria  genus together in the  Papilionaceous  class and agreeably to the hint which DILLENIUS gives in the  Synopsis  p has referred the  Plantains  and  Sponges  to the  Monopetalous  flowers succeeded by dry seed vessels The removal of the  Lysimachiae siliquosae  the two  Papavera corniculata  the  Chelidonium  and the  Balsamine  to the  Siliquose  or Tetradynamous class of LINNAEUS is less to be approved By these changes he has nearly annihilated RAY's twentysecond class of  British  herbs In transposing of species he has made more numerous alterations some of which are sufficiently justified by modern improvements Thus he has brought under one genus the  Scordium  and  Scorodonia  He has referred the  Raphanus rusticanus  to the  Cochlearia  genus as TOURNEFORT had done The  Chelidonium  genus is separated from the  Papaver  and a new characteristic note framed but the name  Papaver corniculatum  preserved The only two plants met with in this book which do not occur in the  Synopsis  of RAY are such as have a doubtful title to the appellation of indigenous they are the  Valeriana rubra  and  Allium Schaenoprasum  I believe he died about the year or soon after He left the remaining part of his work on the  Graminaceous  and  Cryptogamous  tribes compleat in manuscript In the year a person of  Newcastle  into whose hands the manuscript had passed meditated the publication of it with a new edition of the work now spoken of which was out of print and much called for but the design never took effect  CHAP  Blackstone  His  Fasciculus Plantarum circa HarefieldSpecimen Botanicum  Contributors to that

curious observer Mr DAWSON a surgeon of  Leeds  communicated also many rare species as did Mr VERNON of  Whitchurch  in  Cheshire  The observations of the late Sir  William  WATSON Sir  John  HILL Dr

manuscript has since been the basis of a little work published by the late  Edward  JACOB FSA under the title of "  Plantae Favershamienses  "  Lond    o  pp To which is annexed a view of the Fossil Bodies of the island of  Shepey  The plan of this catalogue is exactly that of Mr WARNER's in the "  Plantae Woodfordienses  "  In this volume Mr BLACKSTONE has introduced a few plants not before recorded as natives of this island such are the  Epimedium alpinum Aristolochia Clematitis Limonium reticulatum Fritillaria Meleagris  and  Dentaria bulbifera  Subsequent authors have not allowed complete naturalization to the  Epimedium  and probably that of some of the others is but of modern date The two last were observed by Mr BLACKSTONE in the environs of  Harefield  The author intended another volume of the  Specimen  for which he had collected materials He had also a taste for Topographical Antiquities and had made collections in that way but did not live to publish them He died in  Mr HUDSON when he separated the  yellow Centory  from the  Gentians  gave it the name of BLACKSTONIA which distinction LINNAEUS confirmed in the  Systema  of but changed the name to  Chlora  an appellation it had received from RENEAULME in his  Specimen Historiae Plantarum  published in It should seem that the discovery of the true place of this plant in the system entitled Mr HUDSON to the dispensation of the name or at least that BLACKSTONE should have been perpetuated in the trivial epithet    The "  Specimen Botanicum  " of Mr BLACKSTONE I consider as the last book published in  England  on the indigenous botany before the system of LINNAEUS had gained the ascendancy over that of RAY nor unless it were within my plan to recount single papers occasionally printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  or in other collections am I able to mention any work of importance on exotic botany before this revolution took place which was not built upon or at least did not exhibit some principles of the new system Whilst this event was taking place which cannot be computed at fewer than twenty years commencing from there were however several eminent and learned men who although they did not distinguish themselves by publishing separate tracts on the science were occasionally improving it by their  various discoveries and communications and ever awake to its welfare by the patronage they extended towards it I cannot omit to mention some of these though it be out of my power either to do sufficient justice to their services myself or to point out in some instances such memorials relating to their lives as might properly gratify that curiosity which esteem for their characters naturally excites  COLLINSON  As prior in point of time I mention Mr  Peter  COLLINSON to whose name is attached all that respect which is due to benevolence and virtue I have the satisfaction of referring the reader to some account of Mr COLLINSON printed in and to further anecdotes by Dr LETTSOM at the end of his "Memoirs of Dr FOTHERGILL" to which is annexed a list of Mr COLLINSON's papers printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  and in the  Gentleman's Magazine  See also a further account of Mr COLLINSON in the  Biographia Britannica  Vol iv d edit p  In Mr COLLINSON's time  England  received large accessions to exotic botany  from all parts of the globe to which no one contributed more than himself through his various correspondence especially in  America  He was indefatigable in his exertions to procure the seeds of curious and useful vegetables and equally free in distributing them Natural History in all its parts Planting and Horticulture were his delight He cultivated the choicest exotics and the rarest  English  plants His garden contained at one time a more complete assortment of the  Orchis  genus than perhaps had ever been seen in one collection before He died August in the th year of his age  The name of Mr COLLINSON is perpetuated in a beautiful  American  plant of the  Diandrous  class well known in the  English  gardens    Numerous were the channels by which  England  was enriched with the seeds and specimens of  American  productions BARTRAM was constantly employed in collecting Governor COLDEN of  New York  and Dr MICHELL in  Virginia  were frequent in their communications to MILLER to CATESBY to COLLINSON and others For  Dr FOTHERGILL's incessant exertions in the same designs being at a later period are too well known to be repeated here Governor COLDEN sent to LINNAEUS upwards of species the account of which was printed in the  Upsal Acts  for and and LINNAEUS in his  Flora Zeylanica  gave to a plant of the  Tetrandrous  class the name of his correspondent  LOGAN  Several ingenious gentlemen in  America  pursued botanical investigations with great success about this period  James  LOGAN  Esq  afterwards President of the Council and Chief Justice of  Pensylvania  instituted a set of Experiments on the Maiz relating to the sexes of plants They were first communicated in a letter to  Peter  COLLINSON FRS in and were printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  Vol xxxvi p They were afterwards enlarged and published in  Latin  at  Leyden  in under the title of "  Experimenta et Meletemata de Plantarum Generatione  " and republished with an  English  translation if I mistake  not by Dr FOTHERGILL in  o  pp They have been considered and appealed to as among the most decisive in establishing the doctrine they were intended to illustrate and confirm  MITCHELL  Dr  John  MITCHELL then resident at  Urbana  in  Virginia  sent over in the descriptions of thirty genera of plants of which six were entirely new others were corrected and amended Among the most remarkable are the Ginseng of  America Panax quinquefolium  the  Liquid Ambar Styraciflua  the  Malacodendron  afterwards called by CATESBY STEWARTIA in honour of the  Earl of  BUTE the  Zizania aquatica  In the introduction Dr MITCHELL discourses on the principles of botany and appears to have paid attention to the  Hybrid  productions This paper was separately published in  o  at  Nurenburgh  in  In he sent over to Mr COLLINSON an ingenious "Essay on the Causes of the different Colours of People in different  Climates" It was designed as a solution of the prize problem from the Academy of  Bourdeaux  but was published in the  Philosophical Transactions  Vol xliii pp  The question concerning the cause of the black colour of the skin in Negroes has exercised the pens of many philosophers and anatomists What has perplexed the question the more is that these ingenious writers among whom are principally  Malpighi Boyle Winslow Meckel  and  Barrere  have differed about matters of fact that should seem to be cognizable by the senses  It would be improper in this work to pursue the learned author through all his ingenious details and curious  scholia  on this subject it must be sufficient to observe that on the  Newtonian  doctrine of the causes of colours he deduces the colour of the skin of Negroes from the structure after establishing certain propositions That the colour of White People proceeds from the colour which the  epidermis  transmits That the density of the skins of Negroes allows of no transmission of colour The  part of the skin which appears black in Negroes is the  corpus reticulare cutis  and external  lamella  of the  epidermis  That the colour does not proceed from any black humour or fluid parts contained in their skins That the  epidermis  especially its external  lamella  is divided into two parts by its pores and scales times less than the particles of bodies on which their colours depend Hence Dr MITCHELL concludes  "that the proximate cause of the colour of Negroes is threefold  viz  the opacity of their skins proceeding from the thickness and density of the texture which obstructs the transmission of the rays of light from the white and red parts below them together with their greater refractive power which absorbs those rays and the smallness of the particles of their skins which hinder them to reflect any light"  After which he discourses on the influence of the sun and the modes of life among the inhabitants of hot countries as the remote causes of the colour of Negroes and Indians  Dr MITCHELL returned to  England  I  believe about the year or became a Fellow of the Royal Society and was the writer of an instructive memoir "On the Preparation and Uses of the various Kinds of PotAsh"  Phil Trans  Vol xlv p And of "A Letter concerning the Force of Electrical Cohesion" Vol li p  WARNER  Richard  WARNER  Esq  of  WoodfordRow  in  Essex  merits a particular remembranch at this period for his regard to the science of botany and the respect and honour he ever shewed to the lovers of it  "He was bred to the law"  as we are informed in the 'Anecdotes of Mr  William  BOWYER'  "and had chambers in  Lincoln's Inn  but being possessed of a genteel fortune resided at a good old house on  Woodford Green  "  Here he maintained a botanical garden and was very successful in the cultivation of rare exotics He was not unacquainted with indigenous plants The herborizations of the Company of Apothecaries were once in the season  usually directed to the environs of  Woodford  where after the researches of the day at the table of Mr WARNER the products of  Flora  were displayed The result of the investigations made in that neighbourhood was published by Mr WARNER under the title of "  Plantae Woodfordienses  or a Catalogue of the more perfect Plants growing spontaneously about  Woodford  in  Essex  "  Lond    o  pp As none of the  Graminaceous  or  Cryptogamous  tribes are introduced the list does not exceed species The order

time of flowering In the Preface the author enumerates the names of more than twenty of his friends among whom are many of those alluded to above by whose joint assistance he was enabled to enlarge his work beyond what his own observations might otherwise have allowed Mr WARNER was also distinguished for his polite  learning and eminently so for his critical knowledge in the writings of  Shakespeare  of whose plays he had long meditated to give a new edition but desisted on the appearance of Mr  Steevens  's proposals In he published "A Letter to  David Garrick  Esq  concerning a Glossary to the Plays of  Shakespeare  "  o  This Glossary he continued to augment to the last days of his life He translated the Comedies of  Plautus  left undone by  Thornton  which were published in and  Mr WARNER in his youth as is related of the great LINNAEUS had been remarkably fond of dancing nor till his passion  "for that diversion subsided did he convert the largest room in his house into a library"  He died April and bequeathed his valuable books to  Wadham  College  Oxford  where he received his education and left to the same Society an exhibition for a botanical lecture  CHAP

which favoured the introduction of the  Linnaean  system into  England  it is not unimportant to mention the effect of the admirable pencil of the late Mr EHRET This ingenious artist brought with him not only a general taste for botany but a particular knowledge of the principles on which the system of LINNAEUS was founded and was among the first who displayed it in the specimens of his art  The father of  George Dyonisius  EHRET was gardener to the Prince of  Baden Durlach  Charles  Prince of  Baden Durlach  was a patron of botany and his garden was famous at that time He sent his principal superintendant of the garden on the unfortunate expedition with HEBENSTREIT into  Africa    Young EHRET very early shewed a taste for drawing and painting the flowers of the garden And although he received no instructions yet such was his proficiency that whilst a very young man he had painted plants with a skill and accuracy that was almost unexampled under the disadvantages of so total a want of instruction as our young artist had experienced His merit however remained long unknown or at least ineffectually noticed until it was discovered by a gentleman of curiosity and judgment who visited the garden of which his father was the superintendant Fortunately for young EHRET this stranger was a physician and a friend of the celebrated Dr TREW of  Norimberg  to whom he justly supposed these paintings would be acceptable EHRET by this means was introduced to TREW who immediately purchased the whole paintings and generously gave him double the price at which the young artist had modestly valued them  The liberality of TREW by which EHRET put florins into his pocket inspired him with confidence in his own abilities and such a share of ambition as inclined him to quit his home and seek at once to raise his fortune and to gratify the desire he had to see the world It appears that he was too much elated with his success and as the effect of some share of vanity and a want of oeconomy not unusual in young men he soon dissipated this sum and in quest of adventures went to  Basil  with the last and those only a few of his florins in his pocket Here shutting himself up he with great diligence and singular exertion stimulated now by pressing necessity soon exhibited numerous specimens of his art and though he had learned to set a higher value upon them found a demand beyond his industry to supply Having thus recruited his finances he journeyed into  France  and resided some time at  Montpelier  where he taught his art to a lady of fortune who rewarded him generously and on his wish to remove paid his expences to  Lyons  and  Paris  At the latter city he became known to JUSSIEU and was for some time employed  to paint the plants of the Royal Garden under that eminent Professor's inspection After a certain time he exchanged his situation at  Paris  for that of  London  but not succeeding to his mind he soon returned to the continent The precise time of his being first in  England  I cannot ascertain but it was I conjecture before his employment in the garden of Mr CLIFFORD where LINNAEUS found him in the year From LINNAEUS himself he was taught attention to the parts of the flower and hence became early instructed in the principles of the sexual system His fine taste and botanical accuracy were I apprehend first publicly manifested in the figures of the  Hortus Clissortianus  published in and from that time EHRET became strongly attached to the principles of the  Swede  He returned to  England  about the year or soon after that period and here he spent the remainder of his days His first patron in this country was  Taylor  WHITE  Esq  for whom he finished paintings of plants He soon after procured the patronage of Dr MEAD for whom he painted  and who generously advanced his price In consequence of this countenance and protection he obtained encouragement from Sir  Hans  SLOANE and many other opulent lovers of his art Dr FOTHERGILL procured large collections from him and the late eminent patroness of natural history the  Duchess of  PORTLAND possessed besides near paintings of exotics upwards of of  English  plants done on vellum and highly finished by this admirable artist  Another of his patrons and to whose obliging information I owe great part of the foregoing anecdotes relating to him was  Ralph  WILLETT  Esq  of  Merly  in  Dorsetshire  at whose seat Mr EHRET was accustomed for many years to spend several weeks in the summer season and in whose friendship Mr EHRET reposed as executor in the last arrangement of his affairs The library at  Merly  exhibits a copious collection of exotics done by EHRET not fewer than finished specimens on vellum besides seventy on paper and more than in an unfinished state  The first published specimens of his pencil after his settlement in  England  that I  am acquainted with were exhibited in the th volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  N  o  for January and February by the figure of the  Keratophyton flabelliforme  of RAY Gorgonia verrucosa  Lin  for a paper written by Sir  Hans  SLOANE and by two excellent figures of the  Oenanthe erocata  and  Cieuta virosa  in the same volume intended to illustrate Mr WATSON's observations on the fatal Qualities of those Plants  Very early after his arrival in this kingdom he began to paint figures of the rarest products of the  English  gardens for his friend and first patron Dr TREW for whom in the end he finished Of these at different periods were engraved and published in  Decads  under the following title  "PLANTAE SELECTAE  quarum Imagines ad exemplaria naturalia Londini in hortis curiosorum nutrita manu artificiosa pinxit Georgius Dionysius  EHRET  Germanus collegit nominibus notisque

expence during his lifetime and the remaining three by Dr VOGEL after his decease The whole is executed in so splendid a manner as to constitute at this day one of the finest ornaments of the botanical library  The only publication of any importance in  England  in which Mr EHRET was engaged throughout as far as I can find was BROWN's "Natural History of  Jamaica  " printed in for which he drew all the figures amounting to tables As they were principally taken from prepared and dried specimens they cannot be numbered among his capital performances  Mr EHRET drew and himself engraved a set of tables of Exotics two or three on each plate to the number of fifteen each table containing also a Butterfly of exotic origin These were published at  London  in The last of these exhibits the Cape Jasmine  Gardenia florida  which had flowered for the first time in  England  in the garden of Mr WARNER at  Woodford  in the year A description of this elegant plant the generical character of

of reputation among the literati and obtained him the distinction of being chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society Besides the profit accruing from those numerous exhibitions of his pencil he applied for many years with great assiduity to the business of teaching his art and if his ingenuity did not meet with a reward equal to his merit yet his labours in the end proved sufficiently lucrative to afford him a moderate independence though to the last he ceased not to employ his pencil  He died in September in the th year of his age  Mr EHRST was complimented by Dr TREW in the Third Decad of the  Plantae Selectae  with a new genus which he called by his name The EHRETIAE are trees of the  Pentandous  class first described and figured by SLOANE to which new species have been added by JACQUIN    Mr EHRET married the sister of  Philip Miller  of  Chelsea  by whom he left one son  He was well versed in the botany of this country and delighted in painting the indigenous plants He was ever best pleased when employed by scientific people since his wish was always to follow nature and to exhibit on his piece the true characters without the smallest deviation for the sake of embellishment Having early imbibed the principles of  Linnaeus's  system he attended to the discrimination of the parts on which it was founded with an accuracy that commanded observance and while his excellence in delineating and painting drew admiration and diffused a taste for the study of plants the truth of his pencil instructed those who beheld it in the principles of the science  HILL  About the year Dr HILL began to publish on the subject of botany His "History of Plants" printed in that year although compiled and translated principally from LINNAEUS was not adapted to indigenous botany nor sufficiently calculated to instruct the student in the ultimate  part of any system the specific distinctions since LINNAEUS had not as yet completed the exemplification by modelling the character throughout the whole the  Species Plantarum  not being published till the year  I mean not to enter on any detail of his numerous writings since they are well known and most of them posterior to the limits of my plan Although it may be difficult to reconcile the praises this author bestows on LINNAEUS in many of his writings with the censures contained in his "British Herbal" yet his works had a favourable influence in promoting the science in general though not the  Linnaean  modification of it in particular  For an account of Sir  John  HILL I refer the reador to the  Biographica Dramatica

prevailing excellencies of the  Linnaean  system must be ranked the late Sir  William  WATSON At a period when Botany was feebly supported in these kingdoms after the decease of the SHERARDS and the retirement of SLOANE his talents and his zeal enabled him as far as the influence of  an individual could extend to sustain and promote this science not only with his own countrymen but with those learned foreigners who visited this kingdom Whilst therefore justice to his character and attainments in the subject of this work demand consideration I feel an additional motive to pay a tribute to his memory arising from a grateful remembrance of the friendship and correspondence with which he honoured me  Sir  William  WATSON was born in in  St John's Street  near  Smithsield  His father was a reputable tradesman in that street and died leaving him very young When he had attained to a proper age he was sent to Merchant Taylor's School and from thence was apprenticed to Mr  Richardson  apothecary in  In his youth he had a strong propensity to the study of natural history and particularly to that of plants This led him to make frequent excursions in a morning several miles from  London  so that he became early well acquainted with the  Loci natales  of the indigenous plants of the environs of  London  and during his apprenticeship he gained the honorary premium given annually by the Apothecaries Company to such young men as exhibit a superiority in the knowledge of plants in those excursions made by the Demonstrator of  Chelsea  Garden and instituted for the purpose of initiating the apprentices of the Company in a science so necessary to the profession This premium as hath been observed in the course of the preceding pages consisted of a handsomely bound copy of RAY's  Synopsis  He continued at times throughout his life to attend on these occasions and meet his former associates with great pleasure and delight  In Mr WATSON married and set up in business for himself His skill his activity and diligence in his profession soon distinguished him among his acquaintance as did his taste for natural history and his general knowledge of philosophical subjects among the members of the Royal Society of which honourable body he was elected a member early in the year his two first communications being printed in the  st volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  Soon after his admission into the Royal Society Mr WATSON distinguished himself as a botanist His earliest paper on this subject was "An Account of the celebrated HALLER's  Enumeratio Stirpium Helvetiae  extracted from the  Latin  and illustrated with a  Conspectus  of the author's method and with various observations" This was printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  Vol xlii p    In the same volume  p  and in the succeeding  Vol xliii N  o  p  he excited the attention of the curious in this way by some "Critical Remarks on the Rev Mr PICKERING's Paper concerning the Seeds of Mushrooms" which that gentleman having seen a short time before considered as a new discovery whereas Mr WATSON shewed that they had been demonstrated several years prior to that period by M MICHELI in his "  Nova Plantarum Genera  " printed at  Florence  in  But that which attracted the attention of foreign botanists particularly was his description of a rare and elegant species of  Fungus  called from its form  Geaster  Phil Trans  Vol xliii p t f  This was written in  Latin  and accompanied with an engraving It has since been called  Lycoperdon fornicatum  In the same volume are inserted some very instructive observations on the  Cicuta  or Common Hemlock occasioned by the death of two of the  Dutch  soldiers quartered at  Waltham Abbey  in  Essex  which happened in consequence of their having eaten this herb instead of Greens  Ibid N  o  p    The death of two of the  French  prisoners in occasioned by their eating the roots of the  Hemlock Dropwort  produced from Mr WATSON a paper which in an eminent manner exemplified his skill in the knowledge of plants It abounds with curious and critical observations on that plant and on the  Sium Erucae folio  of  Caspar  BAUHINE Cicuta virosa  Lin  with which it had been frequently confounded  as both had also been commonly mistaken for  Water Parsnep  It is accompanied with engravings of the plants from the excellent drawings of Mr EHRET  Phil Trans  Vol xliv p    In the  th  volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  is printed a Translation by Mr WATSON of a Letter to Sir  Hans  SLOANE from Dr GARCIN of  Neuchatel  containing a complete history of the  Cypress  of the antients the  Henna  or  Alcanna  of the  Arabians  called by LINNAEUS  Lawsonia inermis  a Shrub famous for its use both in medicine and as a dye all over the East insomuch that at  Constantinople  the duty on this drug amounts to ducats annually  Ib Vol xlv p    In Mr WATSON had an opportunity of shewing attention to M KALM during his abode in  England  which was from February till August when he embarked for  America  He introduced him to the curious gardens and accompanied him in several botanical excursions in the environs of  London  This eminent pupil of LINNAEUS  who was a  Swedish  divine on his return home became Professor of Oeconomy at  Abo  where he died Nov aged  The same civilities were manifested by Dr WATSON to the present eminent Dr PALLAS of  Petersburgh  during his abode in  England  which was from July to April  In in company with Dr MITCHELL Mr WATSON examined the remains of the garden formerly belonging to the TRADESCANTS of whom see chap of this work They found the  Arbutus  and the  Cupressus Americana  with other exotics in a vigorous state after having sustained the winters of this climate for years This situation had also afforded a proof not often exemplified of the large size to which the  Common BuckThorn  will grow They found one about feet high and near a foot in diameter  Phil Trans  Vol xlvi p    In were laid before the public some very curious and interesting particulars relating to the sexes of plants which  tended to confirm the truth of that doctrine in a remarkable manner These were occasioned by a letter from Mr MYLINS of  Berlin  informing Mr WATSON that a tree of the  Palma major foliis flabelliformibus  which although it had borne fruit for years past had never brought any to perfection until the flowers of a maletree brought from  Leipsic    German  miles distant had been suspended over its branches After this operation the tree yielded the first year above and the second upon repeating the experiment above ripe fruit from which young Palmtrees had been propagated  Phil Trans  Vol xlvii p    In the same volume are some remarks on the case of two women in  Brabant  who had been nearly poisoned by eating the leaves of what had been called  White Henbane  but Mr WATSON proved that it must have been the  Hyoseyamas niger  since the  white  does not grow spontaneously in that country The same letter confirms the poisonous effect of the  Yewtree  upon horses  lb Vol xlvii p    Mr WATSON paid the same tribute in to the memory of Dr  Henry  COMPTON Bishop of  London  the friend and patron of Mr RAY as he had done to that of the TRADESCANTS and gives a list of exotic trees which were then remaining in the garden at  Fulham  From this catalogue may be inferred not only the original splendour of the garden and the zeal and taste the Bishop shewed in the cultivation of such numerous curiosities but the facility with which trees of very different latitudes may become naturalized in  England  Phil Trans  Vol xlvii p    In the same volume page we find "An Account of the Cinnamon Tree" occasioned by a large specimen equal in size to a walking cane sent over by Mr ROBINS to Dr LETHERLAND and which was exhibited to the inspection of the Royal Society From this Account we learn that three Cinnamon Trees which were intended to have been sent to  Jamaica  were growing in the garden of  Hampton Court  in the reign of King  William  In the year Mr WATSON laid before the Royal Society two rare  English  plants the  Lathraea Squamaria  and the  Dentaria bulbifera  the latter unnoticed both by Mr RAY and DILLENIUS These were discovered by Mr BLACKSTONE near  Harefield  Phil Trans  Vol xlvii p    He also describes in this volume that singular vegetable production noticed before under the article of  Thomas  KNOWLTON as first discovered by him and called  Moor Balls  the  Conferva Aegagropila  of LINNAEUS  Ib p    Mr WATSON about this time was the first as I apprehend who communicated to the  English  reader an Account of a Revolution which was about to take place among the learned in Botany and Zoology respecting the removal of a large body of marine productions which had heretofore been ranked among vegetables but which were now proved to be of animal origin and stand under the name of Zoophytes in the present  System of Nature  It  may be easily seen that this respects the Corals Corallines  Escharae  Madrepores Sponges c and although even GESNER IMPERATUS and RUMPHIUS had some obscure ideas relating to the dubious structure of this class yet the full discovery that these substances were the fabrications of Polypes was owing to M PEYSSONNEL physician at  Guadaloupe  This gentleman had imbibed this opinion first in at  Marseilles  and confirmed it in on the coast of  Barbary  While in  Guadaloupe  he wrote a volume of pages in  o  in proof of this subject which he transmitted in manuscript to the Royal Society of  London  This treatise in which the author seemed to have put the matter out of doubt as to the animal origin of these bodies was translated analyzed and abridged in by Mr WATSON and published in the  Philosophical Transactions  Vol xlvii p  at a time when the learned were wavering in their opinions on this matter M TREMBLY's investigation respecting  the Fresh Water Polypes had paved the way for the reception of PEYSSONNEL's truths and Mr WATSON himself in company with M TREMBLY had an opportunity on the coast of  Sussex  when on a visit at the Duke of RICHMOND's in one of those annual excursions  It may gratify the curiosity of some who reverence the name of Mr RAY to be informed that in one of these excursions Dr WATSON was led by his respect to the memory of that great and good man to visit the spot where he had lived at  Black Notley  in  Essex  This was in the year To Dr WATSON this was classical ground I was informed by him at that time that he found Mr RAY's monument removed out of the church where it formerly stood into the churchyard and hardly visible for brambles these he had removed while he stayed That he found the house in a state which indicated no alteration having taken place except what more than half a century of time might be supposed necessarily to have occasioned unless that indeed some of the windows were stopped up to save the tax and that the orchard bore all the appearance of being as near as possible in the state in which it must have been in Mr RAY's lifetime That the inhabitants of the village knew little of him and the people of the house had only heard that he was a great traveller  which for many years he seldom failed to make in the summer season of verifying M PEYSSONNEL's  system in viewing the Polypes of the Corallines  In was printed "An Account of the Second Volume of the  Flora Sibirica  of GMELIN" exhibiting some extracts relating to the cure of the venereal disease in

the  Transactions  Ib p  some Observations tending to determine what was the  Byssus  of the antients occasioned by a substance which was sent over by Professor BOSE of  Wittemberg  It proved to be no other than the common  Byssus velutina  in a bleached state whereas the  Byssus  of the antients was judged by Mr WATSON to be most probably a Cotton which is confirmed in a very elaborate and critical Dissertation written by Dr  Reinhold  FORSTER and published in  Remarks additional to those of Dr MARTYN on the Sex of the  HollyTree  which justified the removal of it from the  Tetrandrous  to the  Potygamous  class  Phil Trans  Vol xlviii p    "Some Observations upon the  Agaric  lately applied after Amputations with regard to the determining its Species  Ib p  " Some doubts had arisen relating to the exact species of the  Styptic Agaric  which had just then excited the attention of the surgeons both in  France  and  England  Mr WATSON having written afterwards to  M Bernard de  JUSSIEU at  Paris  was assured that the  French  surgeons had used the  Agaricus pedis equini facie  of TOURNEFORT which is the  Boletus igniarius  Lin  Ib Vol xlix p    In Mr WATSON wrote an Account of the first Edition of the  Species Plantarum  of LINNAEUS which was published in the  Gentleman's Magazine  p for that year It is not only highly worthy of being read for the useful information and curious critical matter it contains but also on account of its having produced from that celebrated Professor a handsome letter  written in  Latin  in which he takes occasion to acknowledge the candour and skill of the author in high terms and vindicates himself for having in his work abovementioned given to the  Meadia  a plant so called by CATESBY in honour of Dr MEAD a different name LINNAEUS's Letter was printed the succeeding year in the same publication  Gent Mag  Vol xxv p    In he had occasion to confirm the fatal effects of the  Oenanthe crocata  or Hemlock Dropwort by the death of a person at  Havant  in  Hampshire  from having taken about four spoonfuls of the juice of the root instead of that of the WaterParsnep It was observed that in this instance as in that of the  French  prisoners all the sufferers were affected with the locked jaw  Phil Trans  Vol l p  I take this opportunity to remark also that in the case of a young woman poisoned by the same means which is printed in the th volume of the  London Medical Journal  p subsequent enquiry has convinced me that the incapacity of swallowing with which she was affected before her death arose from the same affection of the jaw    These talents it may be easily imagined rendered him a welcome visitor to Sir  Hans  SLOANE who had retired to  Chelsea  in In fact he enjoyed no small share of the favour and esteem of that veteran in science and was honoured so far as to be nominated one of the Trustees of the British Museum by Sir  Hans  himself who died Jan  After its establishment in  Montagu House  Mr WATSON was very assiduous not only in the internal arrangement of subjects but also in getting the garden furnished with plants insomuch that in the first year of its establishment in it contained no fewer than species all in a flourishing state  Having given ample specimens of the genius and abilities of Mr WATSON as a naturalist we must now consider his talents in some other branches of knowledge Among these nothing contributed so much to extend his fame and enlarge his connexions with men of science as his discoveries in  electricity He became early enamoured with the phaenomena of this wonderful agent in nature an attention to which had been some time before excited among the philosophers of  Europe  and particularly in  England  by Mr  Stephen  GRAY of the CharterHouse  Granville  WHELER  Esq  Dr DESAGULIERS and others  About the year Mr WATSON took it up and made several important discoveries in it At this time it was no small advancement in the progress of electricity to be able to fire spirit of wine He was the first in  England  who effected this and he performed it both by the  direct  and the  repulsive  power of electricity He afterwards fired inflammable air gunpowder and inflammable oils by the same means He also instituted several other experiments which helped to enlarge the power of the electrician but the most important of his discoveries was the proving that the electric power was not created by the globe or tube but only collected by them Dr FRANKLIN and Mr WILSON  were alike fortunate about the same time It is easy to see the extreme utility of this discovery in conducting all subsequent experiments It soon led to what he called  "the circulation of the electric matter"  Besides these valuable discoveries the Historian of Electricity informs us that Mr WATSON first observed the different colour of the spark as drawn from different bodies that electricity suffered no refraction in passing through glass that the power of electricity was not affected by the presence or absence of fire since the sparks were equally strong from a freezing mixture as from red hot iron that flame and smoke were conductors of electricity and that the stroke was as the points of contact of the nonelectrics on the outside of the glass This investigation led to the coating of phials in order to increase the power of accumulation and qualified him eminently to be the principal actor in those famous experiments which were made on the  Thames  and at  Shooter's Hill  in the  years and in one of which the electrical circuit was extended four miles in order to prove the velocity of electricity the result of which convinced the attendants that it was instantaneous  'These and other experiments were made in so great a style and with such success as to draw the approbation and applause of almost all succeeding philosophers in that branch Among others the celebrated VOLTA has given him testimony of the excellence and greatness of his experiments in a paper published within these few years In that paper he shews how simple electrical conductors might be so constructed as not only to give shocks like the  Leyden  phial but even such as are sufficiently powerful to kill large animals and to equal the effects of lightning He however expresses his despair of ever seeing such put into execution but adds  "  Un  WATSON  forse sat ebbe tentato di farlo  c A WATSON perhaps might be tempted to make the experiment he who for another purpose which was that he might shew the extreme velocity with which the electrical power communicated itself from one extremity of a conductor to the other however great its length extended insulated iron wires to more than two miles in length and to whom on account of these very experiments MUSCHENBROEK took occasion to address himself as follows  Magnificentissimis tuis experimentis superasti conatus omnium  See a paper in  Opere Scelti  di Milano date Como Aug "    It ought also to be remembered that  Mr WATSON conducted some other experiments with so much sagacity and address relating to the impracticability of transmitting odours and the power of purgatives through glass and those relating to the exhibition of what was called the "Glory round the Head" or the "Beatification" boasted to have been done by some philosophers on the continent that he procured at length an acknowledgment from Mr BOSE of what he called "an Embellishment" in conducting the experiments a procedure totally incompatible with the true spirit of a philosopher  Mr WATSON's first papers on the subject of Electricity were addressed in three letters to  Martin  FOLKES  Esq  President of the Royal Society dated in March April and October and were published in the  Philosophical Transactions  Phil Trans  Vol xliii p and Vol xliv p  under the title of "Experiments and Observations tending to illustrate the Nature and Properties of Electricity" These were followed in the beginning of the next year  by "Farther Experiments c  Phil Trans  Vol xliv p  " and these by "A Sequel to the Experiments c"  These tracts were collected and separately published in octavo and reached to a third or fourth edition They were of so interesting a nature that they gave him the lead as it were in this branch of philosophy and were not only the means of raising him to a high degree of estimation at home but of extending his fame throughout all  Europe  His house became the resort of the most ingenious and illustrious experimental philosophers that  England  could boast  Several of the nobility attended on these occasions and his present Majesty GEORGE III when Prince of  Wales  honoured him with his presence In fact there needs no greater confirmation of his merit at that early time as an electrician than the public testimony conferred upon him by the Royal Society which in presented him with Sir  Godfrey  COPLEY's medal for his discoveries in electricity  After this mark of distinction Mr WATSON continued to prosecute electrical studies and experiments and to write on the subject for many years Between the year the date of his first paper and the year that

observer of the wonderful increase and improvement of that vast city He was acquainted in no ordinary degree with its history and its police in general and had particularly attended to those circumstances that were more immediately the objects of  the philosopher and the physician This knowledge enabled him frequently to suggest useful hints one of which highly deserves to be mentioned as it respects an object of great importance to the public  In the hard winter of he wrote "Some Observations on preventing the freezing of Water in the Leaden Pipes of the City of  London  " occasioned by the injudicious and ineffectual method practised frequently of strewing dung in the streets over the pipes These were printed in the  Gentleman's Magazine  The method was simply by means of two additional brass cocks One to be inserted into the leaden pipe two feet before it comes into the air guarded by a wooden case filled up with horse litter and reaching near to the surface of the ground and covered over even with the ground by a brick or stone This is to serve as a stopcock and to be turned by the help of an iron key The other cock is to be fastened to the leaden pipe in the open air in any part of its length provided it be somewhat below the level of the stopcock This is inserted simply to empty the leaden pipe of all its water after it has been turned off by the stopcock From the description of this apparatus the method of using it is obvious  for January p in which is pointed  out a successful method of effecting the purpose which he had himself employed in the severe winter of Other instances besides this occur of his attention to whatever might advance the welfare of the public So early as the year he had laid before the Royal Society "Some Observations upon Mr  Sutton  's Invention to extract the foul and stinking Air from the Well and other Parts of Ships With critical Remarks upon the Use of Windsails" In which he suggests several improvements in that useful invention  Phil Trans  Vol xlii p    In he published Mr  Appleby  's Process for rendering Seawater fresh  Vol xlviii p    In an Account of Mr  Charles  MILLER's Experiments on the sowing of

the same class has the singular property of protruding its seedvessel into the ground where it ripens the fruit hence it is named by RAY  Arachis Hypogaios  The oil of this pulfe is so mild and well tasted and withal so easily procured that it might bid fair to supersede that of olives or even oil of almonds It is cultivated in  North Carolina  and might advantageously be raised in the Sugar Islands  Phil Trans  Vol lix p    As from the earliest times of the Royal Society it had been customary to request of some member properly qualified from his knowledge of the subject to review and  lay before that body at their usual meetings any such extracts from the numerous publications which were sent to the Society relating to discoveries in philosophy and the arts as promised to be of general utility that they might be recorded in the  Philosophical Transactions  this office did not unfrequently fall upon Mr WATSON We find several papers of this nature bearing his name Besides those which I have enumerated relating to natural history strictly and electricity are the following as recited below  An Account of a Book intitled "  De quamplurimis Phosphoris nunc  primum  detectis Commentarius  Auctore  Jac Barthol Beccario  "  o    Bolog  Feb Vol xliv p  An Account of a Treatise in  Latin  dedicated to the Royal Society intitled "  Commentatio de Praerogativa

Trans  Vol xlin p and p  "  In an Account and Analysis of a Stone which when first taken out of the stomach of a coachhorse weighed three pounds two ounces avoirdupois weight and measured seventeen inches by sixteen  On examination it appeared to be not so much a concretion of the kind called  Egagropila  as of the  bezoardic  texture  Ib p  Mr WATSON had afterwards an opportunity of exhibiting to the Society a  Calculus  taken from the belly of a mare which weighed fifteen pounds twelve ounces Even this however was exceeded by one from a drayhorse belonging to Sir  Henry Hicks  at  Deptford  which weighed nineteen pounds exclusive of some of the crust broken off  Vol xlviii p    In he laid before the Royal Society "An Account of the  Vomito Prieto  of  Carthagena  " called on the spot  La Chappetonade  This was extracted from Don ULLOA's Voyage to  South America  just  then published at  Madrid  Phil Trans  Vol xlvi p  This disease is described by SAUVAGES under the name of  Vomitus rabiosus  In the same volume "Cases of the  Faetus in Utero  being differently affected by the Smallpox" In one of these a female child was born with evident marks of the smallpox upon her and was not susceptible of the disease when inoculated at four years old with her brother who passed through it very favourably The girl grew pale and lost her appetite but her indisposition wore off in two or three days The other is the case of a lady who had the smallpox to a great degree when seven months gone with child which was at the same period of pregnancy under which the mother of the abovementioned child passed through the distemper The offspring of this lady however went through the disease in the natural way at the age of four or five years  Ib p    All who were acquainted with the extent  of Mr WATSON's knowledge in the practice of physic in natural history and experimental philosophy were not surprised to see him rise into the higher line of his profession This event took place in previous to which he had been chosen a member of the Royal Academy of  Madrid  and he was created doctor of physic by the University of  Halle  under a diploma bearing date September the th The same honour was conferred upon him by that of  Wittemberg  about the same time Soon after which he was disfranchised from the Company of Apothecaries He became a licentiate of the College of Physicians in  This alteration in his circumstances and prospects hazardous as it might be confidered by some occasioned no diminution in his emoluments but far the contrary He had before this time removed from  Aldersgate Street  to  Lincoln's Inn Fields  where he lived the remainder of his days and now he found himself at greater liberty to pursue his studies and carry on at more leisure the extensive literary connnexion in which he  was engaged both at home and abroad He kept up a close correspondence with Dr HUXHAM for many years We find among his correspondents abroad the names of M PEYSSONNEL CLAIRAUT BOSE the Abbé NOLLET M ALLEMAND M JUSSIEU and many others as may be seen from the letters communicated by him to the Royal Society  In October Dr WATSON was chosen one of the physicians to the Foundling Hospital which office he held during the remainder of his life  We find also two zoological articles laid before the Royal Society by Dr WATSON The first of these relates to the insect called the  Vegetable Fly  which had imposed on the credulity of many under the idea of its being an insect flying about with a vegetable growing on its back whereas in fact it was nothing more than a fungus of the  Clavaria  genus growing from the dead nymph of a  Cicada  as well as from any other putrid animal substances  Phil Trans  Vol liii p tab  The first author who seems to have countenanced  this error was Father TORRUBIA in his "  Apparato para la Historia naturali Espanola  " printed at  Madrid  Fol He describes and figures a prickly plant vegetating from a dead

Person" This was a young man aged twentyeight who died after being afflicted with an asthma only two months The lungs were found in an extraordinarily emphysematous state and the pulmonary  vein varicose in a great degree A soreness of the chest succeeded by a cough and a shortness of breath had in this young man's case immediately succeeded a violent and longcontinued vomiting to which cause Dr WATSON was inclined to attribute the origin of this disease  Phil Trans  Vol liv p    Part of a Letter to Dr HUXHAM giving some account of the late cold weather dated  London  Feb By this it appears that the thermometer in  London  stood when at the lowest on the th at eight in the morning at ″½ and on the same day at  Norwich  it was observed as low as seven degrees  Ib Vol lvii p    In Dr WATSON published "An Account of a Series of Experiments instituted with a view of ascertaining the most successful Method of inoculating the Smallpox"  o  These experiments were designed to prove whether there was any  specific  virtue in preparatory medicines whether the disease was more favourable when the matter was taken from  the natural or the artificial pock and whether the crude lymph or the highlyconcocted matter produced different effects The result was what succeeding and ample experience has confirmed that after due abstinence from animal food and heating liquors it is of small importance what kind of variolous matter is used and that no preparatory specifics are to be regarded  Of Dr WATSON's papers on medical subjects printed in other publications it will be unnecessary to give a detailed account as they are well known to medical practitioners in general Nevertheless that the list of his productions may be complete I shall recite them briefly  "An Account of the good Effects of  Magnesia  in severe Vomitings  London Medical Observations  Vol iii p  "  "Observations on the  Hydrocephalus internus  Ibid Vol iv p  "  "An Account of the Putrid Measles as  they were observed in  London  in the years and  London Medical Observations  Vol iv p    "An Appendix to the Paper on the  Hydrocephalus internus  Ibid p  "  This disease on which Dr WHYTT Dr WATSON and others have lately written in so instructive a manner deserves to be accurately noticed and the knowledge of it strongly inculcated as in the country at least it is not unfrequently mistaken and treated as a putrid and comatose fever  As Dr WATSON lived in intimacy with the most illustrious and learned Fellows of the Royal Society so he was himself one of its most active members and ever zealous in promoting the ends of that institution For many years he was a frequent member of the council and during the presidentship of Sir  John  PRINGLE was elected one of the vicepresidents which honourable office he continued to fill to the  end of his days He was a most constant attendant on the public meetings of the Society and on the private associations of its members especially on that formerly held every Thursday at the Mitre in  Fleet Street  and now at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the  Strand  In Dr WATSON was chosen a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and made one of the Elects In the succeeding year he communicated to the College "An Account of a disease occasioned by transplanting a Tooth" This was inserted in the  Medical Transactions  and this I believe was the last paper he wrote  P    In he had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him being one of the body deputed by the College to congratulate his Majesty on his escape from assassination  In general Sir  William  WATSON enjoyed a firm state of health It was sometimes interrupted by fits of the gout but these seldom confined him long to the house In  the year the decline of his health was very visible to his friends and his strength was greatly diminished together with much of that vivacity which so strongly marked his character He died May  Sir  William  WATSON had a natural activity both of mind and body that never allowed him to be indolent in the slightest degree He was a most exact oeconomist of his time and throughout life a very early riser being up usually in summer at six o'clock and frequently sooner thus securing to himself daily two or three uninterrupted hours for study In his younger days these early hours as I have before observed were frequently given up to the purposes of simpling but in riper years they were devoted to study He read much and carefully and his ardent and unremitting desire to be acquainted with the progress of all those sciences which were his objects joined to a vigorous and retentive memory enabled him to treasure up a vast stock of knowledge What he thus acquired he freely dispensed His mode of conveying information was clear forcible  and energetic and justified the encomium bestowed upon him by a learned foreigner in a letter to a correspondent  WATSONIUS  Botanicus et Physicus clarus est et perspicax homo itidemque humanissimus  M Meckel of  Berlin  in Epistolis ad HALLERUM  datis    His attention however was by no means confined to the subjects of his own profession or those of philosophy at large He was a careful observer of men and of the manners of the age and the extraordinary endowment of his memory had furnished him with a great variety of interesting and entertaining anecdotes concerning the characters and circumstances of his time  It is to Sir  William  WATSON that we owe the prefervation of an anecdote which tends further to illustrate the character and exalt the sincerity and integrity of the excellent Mr ADDISON It is inserted in the  Addenda  to his Life in the third volume of the  Biographia Britannica  Dr KIPPIS also acknowledges himself the most indebted to him for the materials of the life of the late  Henry  BAKER Esq    On all subjects his liberal and communicative disposition and his courteous behaviour encouraged enquiry and those who sought for information from him seldom  departed without it In his epistolary correspondence he was copious and precise and such as enjoyed the privilege and pleasure of it experienced in his punctuality another qualification which greatly enhanced its value  Some of the first of Sir  William  WATSON's papers in the  Philosophical Transactions  evince his early proficiency in the science of Botany and especially his acquaintance with the  English  species nor was he less skilled in exotics in his riper years That he was very soon considered on the continent as highly respectable in this light is manifest from his having been one of the few in  England  whom Mr CLIFFORD gratified with a copy of the  Hortus Cliffortianus  a work at its first publication only attainable by those whose studies and acquirements in the subject of it entitled them to receive it from the munificence of Mr CLIFFORD himself In fact all learned foreigners of the same bias in their studies brought letters of recommendation to him and on their return failed not both in their correspondence and in their writings  to bear honourable testimony to his learning and abilities  Sir  William  WATSON had learned to know plants by the system and nomenclature of RAY when  trivial  names were unknown and he was so singularly happy in a tenacious memory as to be able to repeat with wonderful promptitude the long names which had been in use from the times of BAUHINE GERARD and PARKINSON a task from which botanists are relieved by the introduction of the  Linnaean trivial  epithets He lived to see the system of his muchhonoured countryman give way to that of the  Swede  which began to take place in  England  about this period and with which also he made himself acquainted His knowledge of plants and the history of them in the various authors was so eminently extensive that his opinion was frequently appealed to as decisive on the subject and by some of his intimate friends he was usually called  "The living Lexicon of Botany"  Had it been the lot of Sir  William  WATSON to have been devoted to Botany as an official employment  or had the more important avocations of his profession allowed a further indulgence to his favourite bias such an union of natural endowments and acquired knowledge as he possessed must have placed him very high among the naturalists of this age  It remains for me to do justice to the worth of Sir  William  WATSON as a physician and as a member of society But as these parts of his character have been already delineated with great truth and discrimination by my muchrespected friend Dr GARTHSHORE I shall conclude this account by some extracts from the Memorial read by him to a society of physicians of which Sir  William  had been the president  "As a physician his humanity assiduity and caution were eminently conspicuous and his exact observance of the duties of social politeness must ever be remembered with pleasure by all those who enjoyed the happiness of his acquaintance The smile of benignity was always displayed on his countenance he invariably  continued the general the ready and the obliging friend of mankind he was respectful to the elder and superior encouraging to the younger and pleasant and easy to all with whom he had any intercourse The same affability and good humour which adorned his character in public life were preserved also in the bosom of his family and endeared him to those who were more immediately around him He was scarcely ever out of temper was always benignant and kind to his friends and relationsand it would be injurious to his memory not to mention an anecdote which equally displays his humanity and the warmth with which he interested himself in the cases of his patientsNot many years before his death he was waked suddenly one morning very early by his servant who came to inform him that his house had been broken open and that his plate which was of considerable value was stolen"Is that all" said he coollyI was afraid you had brought me some alarming message from Mr concerning  whose dangerous situation I have been very uneasy all night  In Mr MILLER paid Dr WATSON the tribute of calling a new genus in the  Triandrous  class after his name two species of which he has figured in the "Cuts adapted to the Gardener's Dictionary" tab and tab fig It proved that Dr TREW had before given the name of  Meriana  to the first of these and LINNAEUS found himself obliged by the rules of his system to reduce these two species to his genus  Antholyza  already established in the  Species Plantarum  thus sinking the generic term of  Watsonia  and retaining TREW's as a  trivial  name to the plant of tab It is to be regretted that in justice to Dr WATSON who had deserved so eminently well of the science that LINNAEUS did not at least name the lesser species tab of MILLER  Antholyza Watsonia  instead of  A Merianella  "  CHAP  Linnaeus  visits  England  Cool reception of him by Sir Hans  SloaneDillenius  sensible of his merit but indisposed to receive the sexual systemBotany at this juncture in a languid state in  EnglandLinnaeus  's writings diffused in  England  about the year  Grufberg's Flora AnglicaBrown's  Jamaica Plants  Stillingfleet's  Tracts  Lee's  Introduction  Hill's Flora BritannicaHudson's Flora Anglica  Dr  SolanderLinnaeus  's system adopted in the public lectures at  Cambridge  and at  Edinburgh  and finally received and established in  England  LINNAEUS  AS I am now arrived beyond the period when the name of LINNAEUS began to be celebrated throughout  Europe  it will be necessary to recur to the circumstances of his visit to this country that the introduction and full establishment of his system in this kingdom may be better illustrated Here had his reception been  more encouraging to his wishes it has been said he was disposed to have taken up his residence He had been some time in  Holland  under the patronage and in the house of Mr CLIFFORD He had taken his degree of doctor in physic He had gained the esteem of BOERHAAVE and from him brought letters of recommendation to the literati of  England  The fame of Sir  Hans  SLOANE and his Museum and the esteem in which LINNAEUS held the character of DILLENIUS added to the desire of inspecting the  Sherardian Pinax  were among the most powerful motives that induced the  Swede  to visit  England  This event took place in the spring of I am only able to ascertain the season of the year from being informed of the pleasure he expressed in meeting in the fields with those productions of  England  that are not spontaneously growing in  Sweden  His delight particularly in seeing under the hedges the  Hyacinth  in full flower can only be conceived by those who possess some share of that botanical ardour which he possessed  At this time the sexual system existed only in its outline Enough of it however was manifested in the  Florula Lapponica  printed in the  Acta Upsaliensia  for the years and and in the first sketch of the  Systema  in to exhibit its novelty I know not that the  Fundamenta Botanica  the  Bibliotheca  and the  Musa Cliffortiana  although they bear date in had reached  England  before the author yet notwithstanding the warm recommendation of BOERHAAVE Sir  Hans  SLOANE considered at that time as the  Mecaenas  of Botany in this island gave the author and his system an unfavourable reception At the age of seventysix we need not be surprised that the veteran should not feel disposed to learn a new system from a young man whom he could not but consider as an adventurer both in fortune in fame and in science SLOANE moreover had never paid sufficient attention to the improvement of science in the construction of generical characters and this circumstance probably set him at a farther distance from embracing the system of  LINNAEUS which exhibited an arrangement so widely different from the undefined assemblage of the History of  Jamaica  It must not however be understood that Sir  Hans  SLOANE remained insensible to the genius and accomplishments of LINNAEUS on the contrary when he afterwards sent him his  Flora Lapponica  Sir  Hans  SLOANE wrote him a letter bearing date Dec expressive of the great pleasure he received in the perusal of it exhorting him to elucidate the remaining parts of the natural history of his country on the same plan  DILLENIUS was highly sensible of his merit and gave him the most polite reception But that he who had been so long versed in the systems of TOURNEFORT and RAY and after having given improvement to the latter by which he had deserved and received the applause not of  England  alone but of all  Europe  should abandon that system to embrace the hitherto uncountenanced novelties of LINNAEUS could not reasonably be expected  The journey into  England  however was on the whole highly gratifying to LINNAEUS He beheld with astonishment the collections of SLOANE and with rapture the  Herbaria  of PETIVER PLUKENET BUDELLE and of many others there reposited whose names were familiar to him At  Oxford  he inspected with no less satisfaction the  Pinax  of SHERARD which he had eagerly wished to see published and of which DILLENIUS had compleated about a fourth part But an undertaking of that nature and extent after the death of the first projector of it demanded a patronage and an expence not easily obtained  About the time LINNAEUS made his tour into this country indigenous botany was on the whole in a languishing state It no longer felt that degree of support which the SHERARDS and Sir HANS had afforded it The Consul was dead and the declining years of Dr  James  SHERARD and of Sir  Hans  SLOANE began to withdraw them from the bustle and almost from the business of life After the publication of RAY's  Synopsis  by DILLENIUS in  no work of magnitude on the  English  botany except the  Historia Muscorum  in took place for many years not that there were wanting several individuals who were eminent for their knowledge of indigenous botany and zealous in propagating it as instances I refer to the names of WATSON COLLINSON MILLER and BLACKSTONE The arrival however of LINNAEUS in  England  and the consequent promulgation of his method excited that curiosity which novelty will ever attract and although his system might be but little relished at the instant by the  English  naturalists in general there were yet a few into whose minds his doctrines silently insinuated themselves and gained approbation  In the year the next after LINNAEUS left  England  he published the  Genera Plantarum  which compleatly unfolded the sexual system as far as related to classical and generical characters and in the same year exemplified it in the species by the  Flora Lapponica  and the  Hortus Cliffortianus  At the same time anxious as it should seem above all to gain the approbation  of DILLENIUS he dedicated to him the  Critica Botanica  in which he explains his reasons for the change of names and for the establishment of new distinctions both of which he well knew would be considered as dangerous innovations  These volumes soon found their way into the libraries of the curious in  England  though the  Hortus Cliffortianus  was at first only dispersed through the munificence of Mr CLIFFORD The simplicity of the classical characters as the basis the uniformity of the generical notes confined wholly to the parts of fructification and that precision which marked the specific distinctions advantages of which all foregoing systems were destitute soon commanded the assent of the unprejudiced and an interval of a few years gave LINNAEUS's method a decided superiority with  English  botanists  After the establishment of LINNAEUS in the professorship in the year the publication of the  Theses  afterwards in a collected form called the  Amoenitates Academicae  commenced and in less than ten  years two volumes had been published These tracts by the variety of useful and entertaining knowledge with which they abound equally extended and augmented the reputation of LINNAEUS They convinced his opposers that his knowledge was not bounded by mere nomenclature and systematic arrangement as was reproachfully objected  CONCLUSION  In  England  Dr MARTYN in his  Virgil  published in DILLENIUS in his  Historia Muscorum  and BLACKSTONE in his  Specimen Botanicum  had referred to the writings of LINNAEUS and occasionally his name had been mentioned in the  Philosophical Transactions  and other periodical works but as yet no translation of any part of his writings or any publication on his plan had been made in this country until in a  Swedish  pupil of the  Upsal  school arranged by the generic and trivial names only all the plants of RAY's  Synopsis  according to the system of his master This little tract was immediately  transmitted to the Royal Society and excited much attention among those professed students and lovers of  English  botany who obtained the perusal of it  In Dr BROWNE classed all his  Jamaica  plants amounting to species in the same method The drawings having been made by EHRET had the advantage of separate delineations of the flower and fruit  In Mr STILLINGFLEET published a Translation of several Tracts from the  Amoenitates  and by his own valuable additions his instructive Preface the judicious and learned notes interspersed throughout the book by his own "Calendar of Flora" confirming and illustrating that of the  Swede  greatly conduced to exalt the reputation of LINNAEUS in  England  Of this learned and excellent man the reader will find some memoirs in the  Gentleman's Magazine  for which were afterwards incorporated into "Anecdotes of Mr  Bowyer  " see p and into the  Biographia Dramatica  d edition  The next year Mr LEE by his Translation  of the  Elements  of the Sexual System much contributed to facilitate the knowledge and extend the progress and popularity of it among the less learned of his countrymen or such as were unable to recur to the  Fundamenta  or  Philosophia Botanica  of the author  At this juncture it is material among those circumstances which accelerated the progress of the new system to mention the arrival of the late muchlamented Dr SOLANDER who came into  England  on the first of July His name and the connexion he was known to bear as the favourite pupil of his great master had of themselves some share in exciting a curiosity which led to information whilst his perfect acquaintance with the whole scheme enabled him to explain its minutest parts and elucidate all those obscurities with which on a superficial view it was thought to be enveloped I add to this that the urbanity of his manners and his readiness to afford every assistance in his power joined to that clearness and energy with which he effected it not only brought  conviction of its excellence in those who were inclined to receive it but conciliated the minds and dispelled the prejudices of many who had been averse to it  By all these preliminary advances the learned were prepared to see the  English  botany modelled according to the rules of the  Linnaean  school Dr HILL seized the first opportunity of attempting it in his  Flora Britannica  but it was executed in a manner so unworthy of his abilities that his work can have no claim to the merit of having answered the occasion and thus the credit of the atchievement fell to the lot of Mr  William  HUDSON FRS who to an extensive knowledge of  English  plants acquired by an attention to nature had by his residence in the  British Museum  all the auxiliary resources that could favour his design access particularly to the  Herbaria  of almost all the assistants of RAY and DILLENIUS mentioned in the  Synopsis  gave him the opportunity of comparing the individual specimens of that work with his own and thus enabled him to dispel a multitude of doubts and uncertainties in  which otherwise his application of the  synonyma  might have been involved  The sexual system was received nearly about the same time in the universities of  Britain  being publicly taught by Mr Professor MARTYN at  Cambridge  and by Dr HOPE at  Edinburgh  The adoption of it by these learned Professors I consider therefore as the aera of the establishment of the  Linnaean  system in  Britain  a system which if I may be allowed the expression had given the author of it a literary dominion over the vegetable kingdom which in the rapidity of its extension and the strength of its influence had not perhaps been paralleled in the
