 THE ILIAD OF HOMER  Translated by Mr  POPE  VOL II  Quis  Martem  tunica tectum adamantina  Digne scripserit aut pulvere Tro√Øco  Nigrum  Merionen  aut ope  Palladis  Tydiden  Superis parem  HORAT  LONDON  Printed by W BOWYER for BERNARD LINTOT between the  TempleGates    AN ESSAY ON HOMER's Battels  PERHAPS it may be necessary in this Place at the Opening of  Homer  's Battels to premise some Observations upon them in general I shall first endeavour to shew the  Conduct  of the Poet herein and next collect some  Antiquities  that tend to a more distinct understanding of those Descriptions which make so large a Part of the Poem  One may very well apply to  Homer  himself what he says of his Heroes at the end of the fourth Book that whosoever should be guided thro' their Battels by  Minerva  and pointed to every Scene of them would see nothing through the whole but Subjects of Surprize and Applause When the Reader reflects that no less than the Compass of twelve Books is taken up in these he will have Reason to wonder by what Methods our Author could prevent Descriptions of such a length from being tedious It is not enough to say that tho' the Subject itself be the same the Actions are always different That we have now distinct Combates now promiscuous Fights now single Duels now general Engagements Or that the Scenes are perpetually vary'd we are now in the Fields now at the Fortification of the  Greeks  now at the Ships now at the Gates  of  Troy  now at the River  Scamander  But we must look farther into the Art of the Poet to find the Reasons of this astonishing Variety  We may first observe that  Diversity  in the  Deaths  of his  Warriors  which he has supply'd by the vastest Fertility of Invention that ever was These he distinguishes several ways Sometimes by the  Characters  of the Men their  Age Office Profession Nation Family  c One is a blooming  Youth  whose Father dissuaded him from the War one is a  Priest  whose Piety could not save him one is a  Sportsman  whom  Diana  taught in vain one is the  Native  of a fardistant  Country  who is never to return one is descended from a Noble  Line  which ends in his Death one is made remarkable by his  Boasting  another by his  Beseeching  and another who is distinguish'd no way else is mark'd by his  Habit  and the Singularity of his Armor  Sometimes he varies these Deaths by the several  Postures  in which his Heroes are represented either fighting or falling Some of these are so exceedingly  exact  that one may guess from the very Position of the Combatant whereabouts the Wound will light Others so very  peculiar  and  uncommon  that they could only be the Effect of an Imagination which had search'd thro' all the Ideas of Nature Such is that Picture of  Mydon  in the fifth Book whose Arm being numb'd by a blow on the Elbow drops the Reins that trail on the Ground and then being suddenly struck on the Temples falls headlong from the Chariot in a soft and deep Place where he sinks up to the Shoulders in the Sands and continues a while fix'd by the Weight of his Armor with his Legs quivering in the Air 'till he is trampled down by his Horses  Another Cause of this Variety is the Difference of the  Wounds  that are given in the Ilaid They are by no means like the Wounds described by most other Poets which are commonly made in the selfsame obvious Places The Heart and Head serve for all those in general who understand no Anatomy and sometimes for Variety they kill Men by Wounds that are no where mortal but in their Poems As the whole human Body is the Subject of these so nothing is more necessary to him who would describe them  well than a thorough Knowledge of its Structure even tho' the Poet is not professedly to write of them as an Anatomist in the same manner as an exact Skill in Anatomy is necessary to those Painters that would excel in drawing the Naked tho' they are not to make every Muscle as visible as in a Book of Chirurgery It appears from so many Passages in  Homer  that he was perfectly Master of this Science that it would be needless to cite any in particular One may only observe that if we thoroughly examine all the Wounds he has described tho' so infinite in Number and so many ways diversify'd we shall hardly find one which will contradict this Observation  I must just add a Remark that the various Periphrases and Circumlocutions by which  Homer  expresses the single Act of  Dying  have supply'd  Virgil  and the succeeding Poets with all their manners of phrasing it Indeed he repeats the same Verse on that Occasion more often than they    c  But tho' it must be owned he had more frequent Occasions for a Line of this Kind than any Poet as no other has describ'd half so many Deaths yet one cannot ascribe this to any Sterility of Expression but to the Genius of his Times that delighted in those reiterated Verses We find Repetitions of the same sort affected by the sacred Writers such as  He was gathered to his People He slept with his Fathers  and the like And upon the whole they have a certain antiquated Harmony not unlike the Burthen of a Song which the Ear is willing to suffer and as it were rests upon  As the perpetual Horror of Combates and a Succession of Images of Death could not but keep the Imagination very much on the stretch  Homer  has been careful to contrive such Reliefs and Pauses as might divert the Mind to some other Scene without losing Sight of his principal Object His  Comparisons  are the more frequent on this Account for a  Comparison  serves this End the most effectually of any thing as it is at once correspondent to and differing from the Subject Those Criticks who fancy that the Use of Comparisons distracts the Attention and draws it from the first Image which should most employ it as that we lose the Idea of the Battel itself while we are led by a Simile  to that of a Deluge or a Storm Those I say may as well imagine we lose the Thought of the Sun when we see his Reflection in the Water where he appears more distinctly and is contemplated more at ease than if we gaz'd directly at his Beams For 'tis with the Eye of the Imagination as with our corporeal Eye it must sometimes be taken off from the Object in order to see in the better The same Criticks that are displeased to have their Fancy distracted as they call it are yet so inconsistent with themselves as to object to  Homer  that his Similes are too much alike and are too often derived from the same Animal But is it not more reasonable according to their own Notion to compare the same Man always to the same Animal than to see him sometimes a Sun sometimes a Tree and sometimes a River Tho'  Homer  speaks of the same Creature he so diversifies the Circumstances and Accidents of the Comparisons that they always appear quite different And to say Truth it is not so much the Animal or the Thing as the Action or Posture of them that employs our Imagination Two different Animals in the same Action are more like to each other than one and the same Animal is to himself in two different Actions And those who in reading  Homer  are shock'd that 'tis always a  Lion  may as well be angry that 'tis always a  Man  What may seem more exceptionable is his inserting the same Comparisons in the same Words at length upon different Occasions by which Management he makes one single Image afford many Ornaments to several Parts of the Poem But may not one say  Homer  is in this like a skilful Improver who places a beautiful Statue in a welldisposed Garden so as to answer several Vistas and by that Artifice one single Figure seems multiply'd into as many Objects as there are Openings from whence it may be viewed  What farther relieves and softens these Descriptions of Battels is the Poet's wonderful Art of introducing many pathetick Circumstances about the Deaths of the Heroes which raise a different Movement in the Mind from what those Images naturally inspire I mean Compassion and Pity when he causes us to look back upon the lost Riches Possessions and Hopes of those who die When he transports us to their Native  Countries and Paternal Seats to see the Griefs of their aged Fathers the Despair and Tears of their Widows or the abandon'd Condition of their Orphans Thus when  Protesilaus  falls we are made to reflect on the lofty Palaces he left half finish'd when the Sons of  Phenops  are killed we behold the mortifying Distress of their wealthy Father who saw his Estate divided before his Eyes and taken in Trust for Strangers When  Axylus  dies we are taught to compassionate the hard Fate of that generous and hospitable Man whose House was the House of all Men and who deserv'd that glorious Elogy of  The Friend of Humankind  It is worth taking Notice too what Use  Homer  every where makes of each little Accident or Circumstance that can naturally happen in a Battel thereby to cast a Variety over his Action as well as of every Turn of Mind or Emotion a Hero can possibly feel such as Resentment Revenge Concern Confusion  c  The former of these makes his Work resemble a large HistoryPiece where even the less important Figures and Actions have yet some convenient Place or Corner to be shewn in and the latter gives it all the Advantages of Tragedy in those various Turns of Passion that animate the Speeches of his Heroes and render his whole Poem the most  Dramatick  of any Epick whatsoever  It must also be observ'd that the constant  Machines  of the  Gods  conduce very greatly to vary these long Battels by a continual Change of the Scene from Earth to Heaven  Homer  perceiv'd them too necessary for this Purpose to abstain from the Use of them even after  Jupiter  had enjoin'd the Deities not to Act on either side It is remarkable how many Methods he has found to draw them into every Book where if they dare not assist the Warriors at least they are very helpful to the Poet  But there is nothing that more contributes to the Variety Surprize and  Eclat  of  Homer  's Battels or is more perfectly admirable in itself than that artful Manner of taking Measure or as one may say  Gaging  his Heroes by each other and thereby elevating the Character of one Person by the Opposition of it to that of some other whom he is made to excell So that he many times describes one only to image  another and raises one only to raise another I cannot better exemplify this Remark than by giving an Instance in the Character of  Diomed  that lies before me Let us observe by what a Scale of Oppositions he elevates this Hero in the fifth Book first to excell all human Valour and after to rival the Gods themselves He distinguishes him first from the  Grecian  Captains in general each of whom he represents conquering a single  Trojan  while  Diomed  constantly encounters two at once and while they are engag'd each in his distinct Post he only is drawn fighting in every quarter and slaughtering on every side Next he opposes him to  Pandarus  next to  Aeneas  and then to  Hector  So of the Gods he shews him first against  Venus  then  Apollo  then  Mars  and lastly in the eighth Book against  Jupiter  himself in the midst of his Thunders The same Conduct is observable more or less in regard to every Personage of his Work  This Subordination of the Heroes is one of the Causes that make each of his Battels rise above the other in Greatness Terror and Importance to the end of the Poem If  Diomed  has perform'd all these Wonders in the first Combates it is but to raise  Hector  at whose Appearance he begins to fear If in the next Battels  Hector  triumphs not only over  Diomed  but over  Ajax  and  Patroclus  sets fire to the Fleet wins the Armor of  Achilles  and singly eclipses all the Heroes in the midst of all this Glory  Achilles  appears  Hector  flies and is slain  The Manner in which his Gods are made to act no less advances the Gradation we are speaking of In the first Battels they are seen only in short and separate Excursions  Venus  assists  Paris Minerva Diomed  or  Mars Hector  In the next a clear Stage is left for  Jupiter  to display his Omnipotence and turn the Fate of Armies alone In the last all the Powers of Heaven are let down and banded into regular Parties Gods encountring Gods  Jove  encouraging them with his Thunders  Neptune  raising his Tempests Heaven flaming Earth trembling and  Pluto  himself starting from the Throne of Hell  I AM now to take Notice of some Customs of Antiquity relating to the Arms and Art Military of those Times which are proper to be known in order to form a right Notion of our Author's Descriptions of War  That  Homer  copied the Manners and Customs of the Age he writ of rather than of that he lived in has been observed in some Instances As that he no where represents  Cavalry  or  Trumpets  to have been used in the  Trojan  Wars tho' they apparently were in his own Time It is not therefore impossible but there may be found in his Works some Deficiencies in the Art of War which are not to be imputed to his Ignorance but to his Judgment  Horses  had not been brought into  Greece  long before the Siege of  Troy  They were originally Eastern Animals and if we find at that very Period so great a Number of them reckon'd up in the Wars of the  Israelites  it is the less a wonder considering they came from  Asia  The Practice of riding them was so little known in  Greece  a few Years before that they look'd upon the  Centaurs  who first used it as Monsters compounded of Men and Horses  Nestor  in the first  Iliad  says he had seen these  Centaurs  in his Youth and  Polypaetes  in the second is said to have been born on the Day that his Father expelled them from  Pelion  to the Desarts of  Aethica  They had no other Use of Horses than to draw their Chariots in Battel so that whenever  Homer  speaks of  fighting from an Horse taming an Horse  or the like it is constantly to be understood of fighting from a Chariot or taming Horses to that Service This as we have said was a piece of Decorum in the Poet for in his own Time they were arrived to such a Perfection in Horsemanship that in the fifteenth  Iliad  ‚Ñ£ we have a  Simile  taken from an extraordinary Feat of Activity where one Man manages four Horses at once and leaps from the Back of one to another at full Speed  If we consider in what high Esteem among Warriors these noble Animals must have been at their first coming into  Greece  we shall the less wonder at the frequent Occasions  Homer  has taken to describe and celebrate them It is not so strange to find them set almost upon a level with Men at  the time when a  Horse  in the Prizes was of equal Value with a  Captive  The  Chariots  were in all Probability very low For we frequently find in the  Iliad  that a Person who stands erect on a Chariot is killed and sometimes by a Stroke on the Head by a FootSoldier with a Sword This may farther appear from the Ease and Readiness with which they alight or mount on every Occasion to facilitate which the Chariots were made open behind That the Wheels were but small may be guest from a Custom they had of taking them off and setting them on as they were laid by or made use of  Hebe  in the fifth Book puts on the Wheels of  Juno  's Chariot when she calls for it in haste And it seems to be with Allusion to the same Practice that it is said in  Exodus  Ch  The Lord took off their Chariot Wheels so that they drove them heavily  The Sides were also low for whoever is killed in his Chariot throughout the Poem constantly falls to the Ground as having nothing to support him That the whole Machine was very small and light is evident from a Passage in the tenth  Iliad  where  Diomed  having taken a Chariot debates whether he shall draw it out of the way or carry it on his Shoulders to a Place of Safety All these Particulars agree with the Representations of the Chariots on the most ancient  Greek  Coins where the Tops of them reach not so high as the Backs of the Horses the Wheels are yet lower and the Heroes who stand in them are seen from the Knee upwards  See the Collection of  Goltzius c  This may serve to shew those Criticks are under a Mistake who blame  Homer  for making his Warriors sometimes retire behind their Chariots as if it were a Piece of Cowardice which was as little disgraceful then as it is now to alight from one's Horse in a Battel on any necessary Emergency  There were generally two Persons in each Chariot one of whom was wholly employ'd in guiding the Horses They used indifferently two three or four Horses From hence it happens that sometimes when a Horse is killed the Hero continues the Fight with the two or more that remain and  at other times a Warrior retreats upon the Loss of one not that he has less Courage than the other but that he has fewer Horses  Their  Swords  were all broad cutting Swords for we find they never stab but with their Spears The  Spears  were used two ways either to push with or to cast from them like the missive Javelins It seems surprizing that a Man should throw a Dart or Spear with such Force as to pierce thro' both sides of the Armor and the Body as is often described in  Homer  For if the Strength of the Men was Gigantick the Armor must have been strong in Proportion Some Solution might be given for this if we imagin'd the Armor was generally Brass and the Weapons pointed with Iron and if we could fancy that  Homer  call'd the Spears and Swords  Brazen  in the same manner that he calls the Reins of a Bridle  Ivory  only from the Ornaments about them But there are Passages where the Point of the Spear is expressly said to be of Brass as in the Description of that of  Hector  in  Iliad  ‚Ñ£  Pausanias  in  Laconicis  takes it for granted that the Arms as well offensive as defensive were Brass He says the Spear of  Achilles  was kept in his Time in the Temple of  Minerva  the Top and Point of which were of Brass and the Sword of  Meriones  in that of  Aesculapius  among the  Nicomedians  was entirely of the same Metal But be it as it will there are Examples even at this Day of such a prodigious Force in casting Darts as almost exceeds Credibility The  Turks  and  Arabs  will pierce thro' thick Planks with Darts of harden'd Wood which can only be attributed to their being bred as the Ancients were to that Exercise and to the Strength and Agility acquir'd by a constant Practice of it  We may ascribe to the same Cause their Power of casting  Stones  of a vast Weight which appears a common Practice in these Battels Those are in a great Error who imagine this to be only a fictitious Embellishment of the Poet which was one of the Exercises of War among the ancient  Greeks  and  Orientals  Mos est in Urbibus Palestinae usque hodie per omnem Judaeam vetus consuetudo servatur ut in viculis oppidis castellis rotundi ponantur lapides gravissimi ponderis ad quos juvenes exercere se solent eos pro varietate virium sublevare alii ad genua alii ad umbilicum alii ad humeros ad caput non nulli super verticem rectis junctisque manibus magnitudinem virium demonstrantes pondus attollunt  St  Jerome  tells us it was an old Custom in  Palestine  and in Use in his own Time to have round Stones of a great Weight kept in the Castles and Villages for the Youth to try their Strength with And the Custom is yet extant in some Parts of  Scotland  where Stones for the same Purpose are laid at the Gates of great Houses which they call  PuttingStones  Another Consideration which will account for many things that may seem uncouth in  Homer  is the Reflection that before the Use of  FireArms  there was infinitely more Scope for personal Valor than in the modern Battels Now whensoever the personal Strength of the Combatants happen'd to be unequal the declining a single Combate could not be so dishonourable as it is in this Age when the Arms we make use of put all Men on a level For a Soldier of far inferior Strength may manage a Rapier or FireArms so expertly as to be an Overmatch to his Adversary This may appear a sufficient Excuse for what in the modern Construction might seem Cowardice in  Homer  's Heroes when they avoid engaging with others whose bodily Strength exceeds their own The Maxims of Valor in all Times were founded upon Reason and the Cowardice ought rather in this Case to be imputed to him who braves his Inferior There was also more  Leisure  in their Battels before the Knowledge of FireArms and this in a good Degree accounts for those Harangues his Heroes make to each other in the Time of Combate  There was another Practice frequently used by these ancient Warriors which was to spoil an Enemy of his Arms after they had slain him and this Custom we see them frequently pursuing with such Eagerness as if they look'd on their Victory not complete 'till this Point was gain'd Some modern Criticks have accused them of Avarice on account of this Practice which might probably arise from the great Value and Scarceness of Armor in that early Time and Infancy of War It afterwards became a Point of Honour like gaining a Standard from the Enemy  Moses  and  David  speak of the Pleasure of obtaining many Spoils They preserv'd them as Monuments of Victory and even Religion at last became interested herein when those Spoils were consecrated in the Temples of the Tutelar Deities of the Conqueror  The Reader may easily see I set down these Heads just as they occur to my Memory and only as Hints to farther Observations which any one who is conversant in  Homer  can not fail to make if he will but think a little in the same Track  It is no Part of my Design to enquire what Progress had been made in the Art of War at this early Period The bare Perusal of the Iliad will best inform us of it But what I think tends more immediately to the better Comprehension of these Descriptions is to give a short View of the Scene of War the Situation of  Troy  and those Places which  Homer  mentions with the proper Field of each Battel Putting together for this Purpose those Passages in my Author that give any Light to this Matter  The ancient City of  Troy  stood at a greater Distance from the Sea than those Ruins which have since been shewn for it This may be gather'd from Iliad ‚Ñ£ of the Original where it is said that the  Trojans  never durst sally out of the  Walls  of their Town 'till the Retirement of  Achilles  but afterwards combated the  Grecians  at their very Ships  far from the City  For had  Troy  stood as  Strabo  observes so nigh the  Seashore  it had been Madness in the  Greeks  not to have built any Fortification before their Fleet till the tenth Year of the Siege when the Enemy was so near them And on the other hand it had been Cowardice in the  Trojans  not to have attempted any thing all that time against an Army that lay unfortify'd and unintrench'd Besides the intermediate Space had been too small to afford a Field for so many various Adventures and Actions of War The Places about  Troy  particularly mentioned by  Homer  lie in this Order  The  Scaean Gate  This open'd to the Field of Battel and was that thro' which the  Trojans  made their Excursions Close to this stood the  BeechTree  sacred to  Jupiter  which  Homer  generally mentions with it  The  Hill  of  wild Figtrees  It join'd to the Walls of  Troy  on one side and extended to the Highway on the other The first appears from what  Andromache  says in Iliad ‚Ñ£ that  the Walls were in danger of being scaled from this Hill  and the last from Il ‚Ñ£  c  The  two Springs  of  Scamander  These were a little higher on the same Highway  Ibid      Callicolone  the Name of a pleasant Hill that lay near the River  Simois  on the other side of the Town  Il  ‚Ñ£    Bateia  or the Sepulchre of  Myrinne  stood a little before the City in the Plain  Il  ‚Ñ£  of the Catal  The  Monument  of  Ilus  Near the middle of the Plain  Il  ‚Ñ£  The Tomb of  Aesyetes  commanded the Prospect of the Fleet and that Part of the Seacoast  Il  ‚Ñ£  of the Catalogue  IT seems by the  th  Verse of the second Iliad that the  Grecian  Army was drawn up under the several Leaders by the Banks of  Scamander  on that side toward the Ships In the mean time that of  Troy  and the Auxiliaries was rang'd in Order at  Myrinne  's Sepulchre  Ibid  ‚Ñ£  of the Catal  The Place of the  First Battel  where  Diomed  performs his Exploits was near the joining of  Simois  and  Scamander  for  Juno  and  Pallas  coming to him alight at the Confluence of those Rivers  Il  ‚Ñ£ and that the  Greeks  had not yet past the Stream but fought on that side next the Fleet appears from ‚Ñ£ of the same Book where  Juno  says  the  Trojans  now brave them at their very Ships  But in the beginning of the sixth Book the Place of Battel is specify'd to be between the Rivers of  Simois  and  Scamander  so that the  Greeks  tho'  Homer  does not particularize when or in what manner had then cross'd the Stream toward  Troy  The Engagement in the eighth Book is evidently close to the  Grecian  Fortification on the Shore That Night  Hector  lay at  Ilus  's Tomb in the Field as  Dolon  tells us  Lib  ‚Ñ£ And in the eleventh Book the Battel is chiefly about  Ilus  's Tomb  In the twelfth thirteenth and fourteenth about the Fortification of the  Greeks  and in the fifteenth at the  Ships  In the sixteenth the  Trojans  being repulsed by  Patroclus  they engage between the Fleet the River and the  Grecian  Wall See ‚Ñ£  Patroclus  still advancing they fight at the Gates of  Troy  ‚Ñ£ In the seventeenth the Fight about the  Body of  Patroclus  is under the  Trojan  Wall ‚Ñ£ His Body being carried off  Hector  and  Aeneas  pursue the  Greeks  to the Fortification ‚Ñ£ And in the eighteenth upon  Achilles  's appearing they retire and encamp without the Fortification  In the twentieth the Fight is still on that side next the Sea for the  Trojans  being pursued by  Achilles  pass over the  Scamander  as they run toward  Troy  See the beginning of Book The following Battels are either in the River itself or between that and the City under whose Walls  Hector  is kill'd in the twenty second Book which puts an end to the Battels of the  Iliad  THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Acts of  Diomed  DIOMED  assisted by  Pallas  performs Wonders in this Day's Battel  Pandarus  wounds him with an Arrow but the Goddess cures him enables him to discern Gods from Mortals and prohibits him from contending with any of the former excepting  Venus Aeneas  joins  Pandarus  to oppose him  Pandarus  is killed and  Aeneas  in great danger but for the Assistance of  Venus  who as she is removing her Son from the Fight is wounded on the Hand by  Diomed Apollo  seconds her in his Rescue and at length carries off  Aeneas  to  Troy  where he is heal'd in the Temple of  Pergamus Mars  rallies the  Trojans  and assists  Hector  to make a Stand In the mean time  Aeneas  is restor'd to the Field and they overthrow several of the  Greeks  among the rest  Tlepolemus  is slain by  Sarpedon Juno  and  Minerva  descend to resist  Mars  the latter incites  Diomed  to go against that God he wounds him and sends him groaning to Heaven  The first Battel continues thro' this Book The  Scene  is the same as in the former  THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  BUT  Pallas  now  Tydides  Soul inspires  Fills with her Force and warms with all her Fires  Above the  Greeks  his deathless Fame to raise  And crown her Hero with distinguish'd Praise  High on his Helm Celestial Lightnings play  His beamy Shield emits a living Ray  Th' unweary'd Blaze incessant Streams supplies  Like the red Star that fires th' Autumnal Skies  When fresh he rears his radiant Orb to Sight  And bath'd in Ocean shoots a keener Light  Such Glories  Pallas  on the Chief bestow'd  Such from his Arms the fierce Effulgence flow'd  Onward she drives him furious to engage  Where the Fight burns and where the thickest rage  The Sons of  Dares  first the Combate sought  A wealthy Priest but rich without a Fault  In  Vulcan  's Fane the Father's Days were led  The Sons to Toils of glorious Battel bred  These singled from their Troops the Fight maintain  These from their Steeds  Tydides  on the Plain  Fierce for Renown the Brother Chiefs draw near  And first bold  Phegeus  cast his sounding Spear  Which o'er the Warrior's Shoulder took its Course  And spent in empty Air its erring Force  Not so  Tydides  flew thy Lance in vain  But pierc'd his Breast and stretch'd him on the Plain  Seiz'd with unusual Fear  Idaeus  fled  Left the rich Chariot and his Brother dead  And had not  Vulcan  lent Celestial Aid  He too had sunk to Death's Eternal Shade  But in a smoaky Cloud the God of Fire  Preserv'd the Son in Pity to the Sire  The Steeds and Chariot to the Navy led  Encreas'd the Spoils of gallant  Diomed  Struck with Amaze and Shame the  Trojan  Crew  Or slain or fled the Sons of  Dares  view  When by the bloodstain'd Hand  Minerva  prest  The God of Battels and this Speech addrest  Stern Pow'r of War by whom the Mighty fall  Who bath'st in Blood and shak'st the lofty Wall  Let the brave Chiefs their glorious Toils divide  And whose the Conquest mighty  Jove  decide  While we from interdicted Fields retire  Nor tempt the Wrath of Heav'ns avenging Sire  Her Words allay th' impetuous Warrior's Heat  The God of Arms and Martial Maid retreat  Remov'd from Fight on  Xanthus  flow'ry Bounds  They sate and listen'd to the dying Sounds  Meantime the  Greeks  the  Trojan

O  Phereclus  was thine  The graceful Fabrick and the fair Design  For lov'd by  Pallas Pallas  did impart  To him the Shipwright's and the Builder's Art  Beneath his Hand the Fleet of  Paris  rose  The fatal Cause of all his Country's Woes  But he the mystick Will of Heav'n unknown  Nor saw his Country's Peril nor his own  The hapless Artist while confus'd he fled  The Spear of  Merion  mingled

From  Meges'  Force the swift  Pedaeus  fled  Antenor  's Offspring from a foreign Bed  Whose gen'rous Spouse  Theano  heav'nly Fair  Nurs'd the young Stranger with a Mother's Care  How vain those Cares when  Meges  in the Rear  Full in his Nape infix'd the fatal Spear  Swift thro' his crackling Jaws the Weapon glides  And the cold Tongue and grinning Teeth divides  Then dy'd  Hypsenor  gen'rous and divine  Sprung from the brave  Dolopion  's mighty Line  Who near ador'd  Scamander  made Abode  Priest of the Stream and honour'd as a God  On him amidst the flying Numbers found  Eurypilus  inflicts a deadly Wound  On his broad Shoulder fell the forceful Brand  Thence glancing downward lopp'd his Holy Hand  Which stain'd with sacred Blood the blushing Sand  Down sunk the Priest the Purple Hand of Death  Clos'd his dim Eye and Fate suppress'd his Breath  Thus toil'd the Chiefs in diff'rent Parts engag'd  In ev'ry Quarter fierce  Tydides  rag'd  Amid the  Greek  amid the  Trojan  Train  Rapt thro' the Ranks he thunders o'er the Plain  Now here now there he darts from Place to Place  Pours on the Rear or lightens in their Face  Thus from high Hills the Torrents swift and strong  Deluge whole Fields and sweep the Trees along  Thro' ruin'd Moles the rushing Wave resounds  O'erwhelms the Bridge and bursts the lofty Bounds  The yellow Harvests of the ripen'd Year  And flatted Vineyards one sad Waste appear  While  Jove  descends in sluicy Sheets of Rain  And all the Labours of Mankind are vain  So rag'd  Tydides  boundless in his Ire  Drove Armies back and made all  Troy  retire  With Grief the  Pandarus  Leader of the  Lycian  Band  Saw the wide Waste of his destructive Hand  His bended Bow against the Chief he drew  Swift to the Mark the thirsty Arrow flew  Whose forky Point the hollow Breastplate tore  Deep in his Shoulder pierc'd and drank the Gore  The rushing Stream his Brazen Armor dy'd  While the proud Archer thus exulting cry'd  Hither ye  Trojans  hither drive your Steeds  Lo by our Hand the bravest  Grecian  bleeds  Not long the deathful Dart he can sustain  Or  Phaebus  urg'd me to these Fields in vain  So spoke he boastful but the winged Dart  Stopt short of Life and mock'd the Shooter's Art  The wounded Chief behind his Car retir'd  The helping Hand of  Sthenelus  requir'd  Swift from his Seat he leap'd upon the Ground  And tugg'd the Weapon from the gushing Wound  When thus the King his Guardian Pow'r addrest  The purple Current wand'ring o'er his Vest  O Progeny of  Jove  unconquer'd Maid  If e'er my Godlike Sire deserv'd thy Aid  If e'er I felt thee in the fighting Field  Now Goddess now thy sacred Succour yield  Oh give my Lance to reach the  Trojan  Knight  Whose Arrow wounds the Chief thou guard'st in Fight  And lay the Boaster grov'ling on the Shore  That vaunts these Eyes shall view the Light no more  Thus pray'd  Tydides  and  Minerva  heard  His Nerves confirm'd his languid Spirits chear'd  He feels each Limb with wonted Vigor light  His beating Bosom claims the promis'd Fight  Be bold she cry'd in ev'ry Combate shine  War be thy Province thy Protection mine  Rush to the Fight and ev'ry Foe controul  Wake each Paternal Virtue in thy Soul  Strength swells thy boiling Breast infus'd by me  And all thy Godlike Father breathes in thee  Yet more from mortal Mists I purge thy Eyes  And set to View the warring Deities  These see thou shun thro' all th' embattled Plain  Nor rashly strive where human Force is vain  If  Venus  mingle in the martial Band  Her shalt thou wound So  Pallas  gives Command  With that the blueey'd Virgin wing'd her Flight  The Hero rush'd impetuous to the Fight  With tenfold Ardor now invades the Plain  Wild with Delay and more enrag'd by Pain  As on the fleecy Flocks when Hunger calls  Amidst the Field a brindled Lyon falls  If chance some Shepherd with a distant Dart  The Savage wound he rowzes at the Smart  He foams he roars The Shepherd dares not stay  But trembling leaves the scatt'ring Flocks a Prey  Heaps fall on Heaps he bathes with Blood the Ground  Then leaps victorious o'er the lofty Mound  Not with less Fury stern  Tydides  flew  And two brave Leaders at an Instant slew  Astynous  breathless fell and by his side  His People's Pastor good  Hypenor  dy'd  Astynous'  Breast the deadly Lance receives  Hypenor  's Shoulder his broad Faulchion cleaves  Those slain he left and sprung with noble Rage  Abas  and  Polyidus  to engage  Sons of  Eurydamas  who wise and old  Could Fates foresee and mystic Dreams unfold  The Youths return'd not from the doubtful Plain  And the sad Father try'd his Arts in vain  No mystic Dream could make their Fates appear  Tho' now determin'd by  Tydides'  Spear  Young  Xanthus  next and  Thoon  felt his Rage  The Joy and Hope of  Phoenops  feeble Age  Vast was his Wealth and these the only Heirs  Of all his Labours and a Life of Cares  Cold Death o'ertakes them in their blooming Years  And leaves the Father unavailing Tears  To Strangers now descends his heapy Store  The Race forgotten and the Name no more  Two Sons of  Priam  in one Chariot ride  Glitt'ring in Arms and combate Side by Side  As when the lordly Lyon seeks his Food  Where grazing Heifers range the lonely Wood  He leaps amidst them with a furious Bound  Bends their strong Necks and tears them to the Ground  So from their Seats the BrotherChiefs are torn  Their Steeds and Chariot to the Navy born  With deep Concern divine  Aeneas  view'd  The Foe prevailing and his Friends pursu'd  Thro' the thick Storm of singing Spears he flies  Exploring  Pandarus  with careful Eyes  At length he found  Lycaon  's mighty Son  To whom the Chief of  Venus'  Race begun  Where  Pandarus  are all thy Honours now  Thy winged Arrows and unerring Bow  Thy matchless Skill thy yetunrival'd Fame  And boasted Glory of the  Lycian  Name  Oh pierce that Mortal if we Mortal call  That wondrous Force by which whole Armies fall  Or God incens'd who quits the distant Skies  To punish  Troy  for slighted Sacrifice  Which oh avert from our unhappy State  For what so dreadful as Celestial Hate  Whoe'er he be propitiate  Jove  with Pray'r  If Man destroy if God entreat to spare  To him the  Lycian  Whom your Eyes behold  If right I judge is  Diomed  the bold  Such Coursers whirl him o'er the dusty Field  So tow'rs his Helmet and so flames his Shield  If 'tis a God he wears that Chief's Disguise  Or if that Chief some Guardian of the Skies  Involv'd in Clouds protects him in the Fray  And turns unseen the frustrate Dart away  I wing'd an Arrow which not idly fell  The Stroke had fix'd him to the Gates of Hell  And but some God some angry God withstands  His Fate was due to these unerring Hands  Skill'd in the Bow on Foot I sought the War  Nor join'd swift Horses to the rapid Car  Ten polish'd Chariots I possess'd at home  And still they grace  Lycaon  's Princely Dome  There veil'd in spacious Coverlets they stand  And twice ten Coursers wait their Lord's Command  The good old Warrior bade me trust to these  When first for  Troy  I sail'd the sacred Seas  In Fields aloft the whirling Car to guide  And thro' the Ranks of Death triumphant ride  But vain with Youth and yet to Thrift inclin'd  I heard his Counsels with unheedful Mind  And thought the Steeds your large Supplies unknown  Might fail of Forage in the straiten'd Town  So took my Bow and pointed Darts in hand  And left the Chariots in my Native Land  Too late O Friend my Rashness I deplore  These Shafts once fatal carry Death no more  Tydeus'  and  Atreus'  Sons their Points have found  And undissembled Gore pursu'd the Wound  In vain they bled This unavailing Bow  Serves not to slaughter but provoke the Foe  In evil Hour these bended Horns I strung  And seiz'd the Quiver where it idly hung  Curs'd be the Fate that sent me to the Field  Without a Warrior's Arms the Spear and Shield  If e'er with Life I quit the  Trojan  Plain  If e'er I see my Spouse and Sire again  This Bow unfaithful to my glorious Aims  Broke by my Hand shall feed the blazing Flames  To whom the Leader of the  Dardan  Race  Be calm nor  Phoebus'  honour'd Gift disgrace  The distant Dart be prais'd tho' here we need  The rushing Chariot and the bounding Steed  Against yon' Hero let us bend our Course  And Hand to Hand encounter Force with Force  Now haste ascend my Seat and from the Car  Observe my Father's Steeds renown'd in War  Practis'd alike to turn to stop to chace  To dare the Shock or urge the rapid Race  Secure with these thro' fighting Fields we go  Or safe to  Troy  if  Jove  assist the Foe  Haste seize the Whip and snatch the guiding Rein  The Warrior's Fury let this Arm sustain  Or if to Combate thy bold Heart incline  Take thou the Spear the Chariot's Care be mine  O Prince  Lycaon  's valiant Son reply'd  As thine the Steeds be thine the Task to guide  The Horses practis'd to their Lord's Command  Shall hear the Rein and answer to thy Hand  But if unhappy we desert the Fight  Thy Voice alone can animate their Flight  Else shall our Fates be number'd with the Dead  And these the Victor's Prize in Triumph led  Thine be the Guidance then With Spear and Shield  My self will charge this Terror of the Field  And now both Heroes mount the glitt'ring Car  The bounding Coursers rush amidst the War  Their fierce Approach bold  Sthenelus  espy'd  Who thus alarm'd to great  Tydides  cry'd  O Friend two Chiefs of Force immense I see  Dreadful they come and bend their Rage on thee  Lo the brave Heir of old  Lycaon  's Line  And great  Aeneas  sprung from Race Divine  Enough is giv'n to Fame Ascend thy Car  And save a Life the Bulwark of our War  At this the Hero cast a gloomy Look  Fix'd on the Chief with Scorn and thus he spoke  Me dost thou bid to shun the coming Fight  Me would'st thou move to base inglorious Flight  Know 'tis not honest in my Soul to fear  Nor was  Tydides  born to tremble here  I loath in lazy Fights to press the Car  At distance wound or wage a flying War  But while my Nerves are strung my Force entire  Thus front the Foe and emulate my Sire  Nor shall yon' Steeds that fierce to Fight convey  Those threatning Heroes bear them both away  One Chief at least beneath this Arm shall die  So  Pallas  tells me and forbids to fly  But if she dooms and if no God withstand  That both shall fall by one victorious Hand  Then heed my Words My Horses here detain  Fix'd to the Chariot by the straiten'd Rein  Swift to  Aeneas'  empty Seat proceed  And seize the Coursers of Aetherial Breed  The Race of those which once the thund'ring God  For ravish'd  Ganymede  on  Tros  bestow'd  The best that e'er on Earth's broad Surface run  Beneath the rising or the setting Sun  Hence great  Anchises  stole a Breed unknown  By mortal  Mares  from fierce  Laomedon  Four of this Race his ample Stalls contain  And two transport  Aeneas  o'er the Plain  These were the rich immortal Prize our own  Thro' the wide World should make our Glory known  Thus while they spoke the Foe came furious on  And stern  Lycaon  's warlike Race begun  Prince thou art met Tho' late in vain assail'd  The Spear may enter where the Arrow fail'd  He said then shook the pondrous Lance and flung  On his broad Shield the sounding Weapon rung  Pierc'd the tough Orb and in his Cuirass hung  He bleeds The Pride of  Greece  the Boaster cries  Our Triumph now the mighty Warrior lies  Mistaken Vaunter  Diomed  reply'd  Thy Dart has err'd and now my Spear be try'd  Ye scape not both One headlong from his Car  With hostile Blood shall glut the God of War  He spoke and rising hurl'd his forceful Dart  Which driv'n by  Pallas  pierc'd a vital Part  Full in his Face it enter'd and betwixt  The Nose and Eyeball the proud  Lycian  fixt  Crash'd all his Jaws and cleft the Tongue within  'Till the bright Point look'd out beneath the Chin  Headlong he falls his Helmet knocks the Ground  Earth groans beneath him and his Arms resound  The starting Coursers tremble with Affright  The Soul indignant seeks the Realms of Night  To guard his slaughter'd Friend  Aeneas  flies  His Spear extending where the Carcass lies  Watchful he wheels protects it ev'ry way  As the grim Lyon stalks around his Prey  O'er the fall'n Trunk his ample Shield display'd  He hides the Hero with his mighty Shade  And threats aloud The  Greeks  with longing Eyes  Behold at distance but forbear the Prize  Then fierce  Tydides  stoops and from the Fields  Heav'd with vast Force a Rocky Fragment wields  Not two strong Men th' enormous Weight could raise  Such Men as live in these degen'rate Days  He swung it round and gath'ring Strength to throw  Discharg'd the pond'rous Ruin at the Foe  Where to the Hip th' inserted Thigh unites  Full on the Bone the pointed Marble lights  Thro' both the Tendons broke the rugged Stone  And stripp'd the Skin and crack'd the solid Bone  Sunk on his Knees and stagg'ring with his Pains  His falling Bulk his bended Arm sustains  Lost in a dizzy Mist the Warrior lies  A sudden Cloud comes swimming o'er his Eyes  There the brave Chief who mighty Numbers sway'd  Oppress'd had sunk to Death's Eternal Shade  But Heav'nly  Venus  mindful of the Love  She bore  Anchises  in th'  Idaean  Grove  His Danger views with Anguish and Despair  And guards her Offspring with a Mother's Care  About her muchlov'd Son her Arms she throws  Her Arms whose Whiteness match'd the falling Snows  Screen'd from the Foe behind her shining Veil  The Swords wave harmless and the Javelins fail  Safe thro' the rushing Horse and feather'd Flight  Of sounding Shafts she bears him from the Fight  Nor  Sthenelus  with unassisting Hands  Remain'd unheedful of his Lord's Commands  His panting Steeds remov'd from out the War  He fix'd with straiten'd Traces to the Car  Next rushing to the  Dardan  Spoil detains  The heav'nly Coursers with the flowing Manes  These in proud Triumph to the Fleet convey'd  No longer now a  Trojan  Lord obey'd  That Charge to bold  Deipylus  he gave  Whom most he lov'd as brave Men love the Brave  Then mounting on his Car resum'd the Rein  And follow'd where  Tydides  swept the Plain  Meanwhile his Conquest ravish'd from his Eyes  The raging Chief in chace of  Venus  flies  No Goddess She commission'd to the Field  Like  Pallas  dreadful with her sable Shield  Or fierce  Bellona  thund'ring at the Wall  While Flames ascend and mighty Ruins fall  He knew soft Combates suit the tender Dame  New to the Field and still a Foe to Fame  Thro' breaking Ranks his furious Course he bends  And at the Goddess his broad Lance extends  Thro' her bright Veil the daring Weapon drove  Th' Ambrosial Veil which all the Graces wove  Her snowie Hand the razing Steel profan'd  And the transparent Skin with Crimson stain'd  From the clear Vein a Stream immortal flow'd  Such Stream as issues from a wounded God  Pure Emanation uncorrupted Flood  Unlike our gross diseas'd terrestrial Blood  For not the Bread of Man their Life sustains  No Wine's inflaming Juice supplies their Veins  With tender Shrieks the Goddess fill'd the Place  And dropt her Offspring from her weak Embrace  Him  Phaebus  took He casts a Cloud around  The fainting Chief and wards the mortal Wound  Then with a Voice that shook the vaulted Skies  The King insults the Goddess as she flies  Ill with  Jove's  Daughter bloody Fights agree  The Field of Combate is no Scene for thee  Go let thy own soft Sex employ thy Care  Go lull the Coward or delude the Fair  Taught by this Stroke renounce the War's Alarms  And learn to tremble at the Name of Arms  Tydides  thus The Goddess seiz'd with Dread  Confus'd distracted from the Conflict fled  To aid her swift the winged  Iris  flew  Wrapt in a Mist above the warring Crew  The Queen of Love with faded Charms she found  Pale was her Cheek and livid look'd the Wound  To  Mars  who sate remote they bent their way  Far on the left with Clouds involv'd he lay  Beside him stood his Lance distain'd with Gore  And rein'd with Gold his foaming Steeds before  Low at his Knee she begg'd with streaming Eyes  Her Brother's Car to mount the distant Skies  And shew'd the Wound by fierce  Tydides  giv'n  A mortal Man who dares encounter Heav'n  Stern  Mars  attentive hears the Queen complain  And to her Hand commits the golden Rein  She mounts the Seat oppress'd with silent Woe  Driv'n by the Goddess of the painted Bow  The Lash resounds the rapid Chariot flies  And in a Moment scales the lofty Skies  There stopp'd the Car and there the Coursers stood  Fed by fair  Iris  with Ambrosial Food  Before her Mother Love's bright Queen appears  O'erwhelm'd with Anguish and dissolv'd in Tears  She rais'd her in her Arms beheld her bleed  And ask'd what God had wrought this guilty Deed  Then she This Insult from no God I found  An impious Mortal gave the daring Wound  Behold the Deed of haughty  Diomed  'Twas in the Son's Defence the Mother bled  The War with  Troy  no more the  Grecians  wage  But with the Gods th' immortal Gods engage  Dione  then Thy Wrongs with Patience bear  And share those Griefs inferior Pow'rs must share  Unnumber'd Woes Mankind from us sustain  And Men with Woes afflict the Gods again  The mighty  Mars  in mortal Fetters bound  And lodg'd in Brazen Dungeons under Ground  Full thirteen Moons imprison'd roar'd in vain  Otus  and  Ephialtes  held the Chain  Perhaps had perish'd had not  Hermes'  Care  Restor'd the groaning God to upper Air  Great  Juno  's self has born her Weight of Pain  Th' imperial Partner of the heav'nly Reign  Amphitryon  's Son infix'd the deadly Dart  And fill'd with Anguish her immortal Heart  Ev'n Hell's grim King  Alcides'  Pow'r confest  The Shaft found Entrance in his Iron Breast  To  Jove  's high Palace for a Cure he fled  Pierc'd in his own Dominions of the Dead  Where  Paeon  sprinkling heav'nly Balm around  Asswag'd the glowing Pangs and clos'd the Wound  Rash impious Man to stain the blest Abodes  And drench his Arrows in the Blood of Gods  But thou tho'  Pallas  urg'd thy frantic Deed  Whose Spear illfated makes a Goddess bleed  Know thou whoe'er with heav'nly Pow'r contends  Short is his Date and soon his Glory ends  From Fields of Death when late he shall retire  No Infant on his Knees shall call him Sire  Strong as thou art some God may yet be found  To stretch thee pale and gasping on the Ground  Thy distant Wife  Aegiale  the Fair  Starting from Sleep with a distracted Air  Shall rowze thy Slaves and her lost Lord deplore  The brave the great the glorious now no more  This said she wip'd from  Venus'  wounded Palm  The sacred  Ichor  and infus'd the Balm  Juno  and  Pallas  with a Smile survey'd  And thus to  Jove  began the blueey'd Maid  Permit thy Daughter gracious  Jove  to tell  How this Mischance the  Cyprian  Queen befell  As late she try'd with Passion to inflame  The tender Bosome of a  Grecian  Dame  Allur'd the Fair with moving Thoughts of Joy  To quit her Country for some Youth of  Troy  The clasping Zone with golden Buckles bound  Raz'd her soft Hand with this lamented Wound  The Sire of Gods and Men superior smil'd  And calling  Venus  thus addrest his Child  Not these O Daughter are thy proper Cares  Thee milder Arts befit and softer Wars  Sweet Smiles are thine and kind endearing Charms  To  Mars  and  Pallas  leave the Deeds of Arms  Thus they in Heav'n While on the Plain below  The fierce  Tydides  charg'd his  Dardan  Foe  Flush'd with Celestial Blood pursu'd his way  And fearless dar'd the threatning God of Day  Already in his Hopes he saw him kill'd  Tho' screen'd behind  Apollo  's mighty Shield  Thrice rushing furious at the Chief he strook  His blazing Buckler thrice  Apollo  shook  He try'd the fourth When breaking from the Cloud  A more than mortal Voice was heard aloud  O Son of  Tydeus  cease be wise and see  How vast the Diff'rence of the Gods and Thee  Distance immense between the Pow'rs that shine  Above Eternal Deathless and Divine  And mortal Man a Wretch of humble Birth  A shortliv'd Reptile in the Dust of Earth  So spoke the God who darts Celestial Fires  He dreads his Fury and some Steps retires  Then  Phoebus  bore the Chief of  Venus'  Race  To  Troy  's high Fane and to his Holy Place  Latona  there and  Phoebe  heal'd the Wound  With Vigor arm'd him and with Glory crown'd  This done the Patron of the Silver Bow  A Phantom rais'd the same in Shape and Show  With great  Aeneas  such the Form he bore  And such in Fight the radiant Arms he wore  Around the Spectre bloody Wars are wag'd  And  Greece  and  Troy  with clashing Shields engag'd  Meantime on  Ilion  's Tow'r  Apollo  stood  And calling  Mars  thus urg'd the raging God  Stern Pow'r of Arms by whom the Mighty fall  Who bathe in Blood and shake th' embattel'd Wall  Rise in thy Wrath To Hell's abhorr'd Abodes  Dispatch yon'  Greek  and vindicate the Gods  First rosie  Venus  felt his brutal Rage  Me next he charg'd and dares all Heav'n engage  The Wretch would brave high Heav'ns immortal Sire  His triple Thunder and his Bolts of Fire  The God of Battel issues on the Plain  Stirs all the Ranks and fires the  Trojan  Train  In Form like  Acamas  the  Thracian  Guide  Enrag'd to  Troy  's retiring Chiefs he cry'd  How long ye Sons of  Priam  will ye fly  And unreveng'd see  Priam  's People die  Still unresisted shall the Foe destroy  And stretch the Slaughter to the Gates of  Troy  Lo brave  Aeneas  sinks beneath his Wound  Not Godlike  Hector  more in Arms renown'd  Haste all and take the gen'rous Warrior's Part  He said new Courage swell'd each Hero's Heart  Sarpedon  first his ardent Soul express'd  And turn'd to  Hector  these bold Words address'd  Say Chief is all thy ancient Valor lost  Where are thy Threats and where thy glorious Boast  That propt alone by  Priam  's Race should stand  Troy  's sacred Walls nor need a foreign Hand  Now now thy Country calls her wanted Friends  And the proud Vaunt in just Derision ends  Remote they stand while Alien Troops engage  Like trembling Hounds before the Lion's Rage  Far distant hence I held my wide Command  Where foaming  Xanthus  laves the  Lycian  Land  With ample Wealth the Wish of Mortals blest  A beauteous Wife and Infant at her Breast  With those I left whatever dear could be  Greece  if she conquers nothing wins from me  Yet first in Fight my  Lycian  Bands I chear  And long to meet this mighty Man ye fear  While  Hector  idle stands nor bids the Brave  Their Wives their Infants and their Altars save  Haste Warrior haste preserve thy threaten'd State  Or one vast Burst of allinvolving Fate  Full o'er your Tow'rs shall fall and sweep away  Sons Sires and Wives an undistinguish'd Prey  Rowze all thy  Trojans  urge thy  Aids  to fight  These claim thy Thoughts by Day thy Watch by Night  With Force incessant the brave  Greeks  oppose  Such Cares thy Friends deserve and such thy Foes  Stung to the Heart the gen'rous  Hector  hears  But just Reproof with decent Silence bears  From his proud Car the Prince impetuous springs  On Earth he leaps his Brazen Armor rings  Two shining Spears are brandish'd in his Hands  Thus arm'd he animates his drooping Bands  Revives their Ardor turns their Steps from Flight  And wakes anew the dying Flames of Fight  They turn they stand The  Greeks  their Fury dare  Condense their Pow'rs and wait the growing War  As when on  Ceres'  sacred Floor the Swain  Spreads the wide Fan to clear the golden Grain  And the light Chaff before the Breezes born  Ascends in Clouds from off the heapy Corn  The grey Dust rising with collected Winds  Drives o'er the Barn and whitens all the Hinds  So white with Dust the  Grecian  Host appears  From trampling Steeds and thundring Charioteers  The dusky Clouds from labour'd Earth arise  And roll in smoaking Volumes to the Skies  Mars  hovers o'er them with his sable Shield  And adds new Horrors to the darken'd Field  Pleas'd with his Charge and ardent to fulfill  In  Troy  's Defence  Apollo  's heav'nly Will  Soon as from Fight the blueey'd Maid retires  Each  Trojan  Bosom with new Warmth he fires  And now the God from forth his sacred Fane  Produc'd  Aeneas  to the shouting Train  Alive unharm'd with all his Peers around  Erect he stood and vig'rous from his Wound  Enquiries none they made the dreadful Day  No Pause of Words admits no dull Delay  Fierce  Discord  storms  Apollo  loud exclaims  Fame  calls  Mars  thunders and the Field's in Flames  Stern  Diomed  with either  Ajax  stood  And great  Ulysses  bath'd in hostile Blood  Embodied close the lab'ring  Grecian  Train  The fiercest Shock of charging Hosts sustain  Unmov'd and silent the whole War they wait  Serenely dreadful and as fix'd as Fate  So when th' embattel'd Clouds in dark Array  Along the Skies their gloomy Lines display  When now the  North  his boist'rous Rage has spent  And peaceful sleeps the liquid Element  The lowhung Vapors motionless and still  Rest on the Summits of the shaded Hill  'Till the Mass scatters as the Winds arise  Dispers'd and kroken thro' the ruffled Skies  Nor was the Gen'ral wanting to his Train  From Troop to Troop he toils thro' all the Plain  Ye  Greeks  be Men the Charge of Battel bear  Your brave Associates and Yourselves revere  Let glorious Acts more glorious Acts inspire  And catch from Breast to Breast the noble Fire  On Valor's side the Odds of Combate lie  The Brave live glorious or lamented die  The Wretch who trembles in the Field of Fame  Meets Death and worse than Death Eternal Shame  These Words he seconds with his flying Lance  To meet whose Point was strong  Deicoon  's Chance  Aeneas'  Friend and in his native Place  Honour'd and lov'd like  Priam  's Royal Race  Long had he fought the foremost in the Field  But now the Monarch's Lance transpierc'd his Shield  His Shield too weak the furious Dart to stay  Thro' his broad Belt the Weapon forc'd its way  The grizly Wound dismiss'd his Soul to Hell  His Arms around him rattled as he fell  Then fierce  Aeneas  brandishing his Blade  In Dust  Orsilochus  and  Crethon  laid  Whose Sire  Di√∂cleus  wealthy brave and great  In wellbuilt  Pherae  held his lofty Seat  Sprung from  Alpheus  plenteous Stream that yields  Encrease of Harvests to the  Pylian  Fields  He got  Orsilochus Di√∂cleus  He  And these descended in the third Degree  Too early expert in the martial Toil  In sable Ships they left their native Soil  T'avenge  Atrides  Now untimely slain  They fell with Glory on the  Phrygian  Plain  So two young Mountain Lions nurs'd with Blood  In deep Recesses of the gloomy Wood  Rush fearless to the Plains and uncontroul'd  Depopulate the Stalls and waste the Fold  'Till pierc'd at distance from their native Den  O'erpow'r'd they fall beneath the Force of Men  Prostrate on Earth their beauteous Bodies lay  Like Mountain Firs as tall and strait as they  Great  Menelaus  views with pitying Eyes  Lifts his bright Lance and at the Victor flies  Mars  urg'd him on yet ruthless in his Hate  The God but urg'd him to provoke his Fate  He thus advancing  Nestor  's valiant Son  Shakes for his Danger and neglects his own  Struck with the Thought should  Helen  's Lord be slain  And all his Country's glorious Labours vain  Already met the threat'ning Heroes stand  The Spears already tremble in their Hand  In rush'd  Antilochus  his Aid to bring  And fall or conquer by the  Spartan  King  These seen the  Dardan  backward turn'd his Course  Brave as he was and shunn'd unequal Force  The breathless Bodies to the  Greeks  they drew  Then mix in Combate and their Toils renew  First  Pylaemenes  great in Battel bled  Who sheath'd in Brass the  Paphlagonians  led  Atrides  mark'd him where sublime he stood  Fix'd in his Throat the Javelin drank his Blood  The faithful  Mydon  as he turn'd from Fight  His flying Coursers sunk to endless Night  A broken Rock by  Nestor  's Son was thrown  His bended Arm receiv'd the falling Stone  From his numb'd Hand the Iv'rystudded Reins  Dropt in the Dust are trail'd along the Plains  Meanwhile his Temples feel a deadly Wound  He groans in Death and pondrous sinks to Ground  Deep drove his Helmet in the Sands and there  The Head stood fix'd the quiv'ring Legs in Air  'Till trampled flat beneath the Courser's Feet  The youthful Victor mounts his empty Seat  And bears the Prize in Triumph to the Fleet  Great  Hector  saw and raging at the View  Pours on the  Greeks  The  Trojan  Troops pursue  He fires his Host with animating Cries  And brings along the Furies of the Skies  Mars  stern Destroyer and  Bellona  dread  Flame in the Front and thunder at their Head  This swells the Tumult and the Rage of Fight  That shakes a Spear that casts a dreadful Light  Where  Hector  march'd the God of Battels shin'd  Now storm'd before him and now rag'd behind  Tydides  paus'd amidst his full Carrier  Then first the Hero's manly Breast knew Fear  As when some simple Swain his Cot forsakes  And wide thro' Fens an unknown Journey takes  If chance a swelling Brook his Passage stay  And foam impervious cross the Wand'rer's way  Confus'd he stops a Length of Country past  Eyes the rough Waves and tir'd returns at last  Amaz'd no less the great  Tydides  stands  He stay'd and turning thus address'd his Bands  No wonder  Greeks  that all to  Hector  yield  Secure of fav'ring Gods he takes the Field  His Strokes they second and avert our Spears  Behold where  Mars  in mortal Arms appears  Retire then Warriors but sedate and slow  Retire but with your Faces to the Foe  Trust not too much your unavailing Might  'Tis not with  Troy  but with the Gods ye fight  Now near the  Greeks  the black Battalions drew  And first two Leaders valiant  Hector  slew  His Force  Anchialus  and  Mnesthes  found  In ev'ry Art of glorious War renown'd  In the same Car the Chiefs to Combate ride  And fought united and united dy'd  Struck at the Sight the mighty  Ajax  glows  With Thirst of Vengeance and assaults the Foes  His massy Spear with matchless Fury sent  Thro'  Amphius'  Belt and heaving Belly went  Amphius Apaesus'  happy Soil possess'd  With Herds abounding and with Treasure bless'd  But Fate resistless from his Country led  The Chief to perish at his People's Head  Shook with his Fall his Brazen Armor rung  And fierce to seize it conqu'ring  Ajax  sprung  Around his Head an Iron Tempest rain'd  A Wood of Spears his ample Shield sustain'd  Beneath one Foot the yetwarm Corps he prest  And drew his Javelin from the bleeding Breast  He could no more The show'ring Darts deny'd  To spoil his glitt'ring Arms and Plumy Pride  Now Foes on Foes came pouring on the Fields  With bristling Lances and compacted Shields  'Till in the Steely Circle straiten'd round  Forc'd he gives way and sternly quits the Ground  While thus they strive  Tlepolemus  the great  Urg'd by the Force of unresisted Fate  Burns with Desire  Sarpedon  's Strength to prove  Alcides'  Offspring meets the Son of  Jove  Sheath'd in bright Arms each adverse Chief came on  Jove  's great Descendent and his greater Son  Prepar'd for Combate e're the Lance he tost  The daring  Rhodian  vents his haughty Boast  What brings this  Lycian  Counsellor so far  To tremble at our Arms not mix in War  Know thy vain self nor let their Flatt'ry move  Who style thee Son of Cloudcompelling  Jove  How far unlike those Chiefs of Race divine  How vast the Diff'rence of their Deeds and thine  Jove  got such Heroes as my Sire whose Soul  No Fear could daunt nor Earth nor Hell controul  Troy  felt his Arm and yon' proud Ramparts stand  Rais'd on the Ruins of his vengeful Hand  With six small Ships and but a slender Train  He left the Town a wide deserted Plain  But what art thou who deedless look'st around  While unreveng'd thy  Lycians  bite the Ground  Small Aid to  Troy  thy feeble Force can be  But wert thou greater thou must yield to me  Pierc'd by my Spear to endless Darkness go  I make this Present to the Shades below  The Son of  Hercules  the  Rhodian  Guide  Thus haughty spoke The  Lycian  King reply'd  Thy Sire O Prince o'erturn'd the  Trojan  State  Whose perjur'd Monarch well deserv'd his Fate  Those heav'nly Steeds the Hero sought so far  False he detain'd the just Reward of War  Nor so content the gen'rous Chief defy'd  With base Reproaches and unmanly Pride  But you unworthy the high Race you boast  Shall raise my

 Their Task perform'd and mix among the Gods  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Fifth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIFTH BOOK  I  VERSE  BUT  Pallas  now  c  As in every just History Picture there is one principal Figure to which all the rest refer and are subservient so in each Battel of the Iliad there is one principal Person that may properly be call'd the Hero of that Day or Action This Conduct preserves the Unity of the Piece and keeps the Imagination from being distracted and confused with a wild Number of independent Figures which have no Subordination to each other To make this probable  Homer  supposes these extraordinary Measures of Courage to be the immediate Gift of the Gods who bestow them sometimes upon one and sometimes upon another as they think fit to make them the Instruments of their Designs an Opinion conformable to true Theology Whoever reflects upon this will not blame our Author for representing the same Heroes brave at one time and dispirited at another just as the Gods assist or abandon them on different Occasions  II  VERSE Tydides  That we may enter into the Spirit and Beauty of this Book it will be proper to settle the true Character of  Diomed  who is the Hero of it  Achilles  is no  sooner retired but  Homer  raises his other  Greeks  to supply his Absence like Stars that shine each in his due Revolution till the principal Hero rises again and eclipses all others As  Diomed  is the first in this Office he seems to have more of the Character of  Achilles  than any besides He has naturally an Excess of Boldness and too much Fury in his Temper forward and intrepid like the other and running after Gods or Men promiscuously as they offer themselves But what differences his Character is that he is soon reclaim'd by Advice hears those that are more experienced and in a word obeys  Minerva  in all things He is assisted by the Patroness of Wisdom and Arms as he is eminent both for Prudence and Valor That which characterizes his Prudence is a quick Sagacity and Presence of Mind in all Emergencies and an undisturb'd Readiness in the very Article of Danger And what is particular in his Valor is agreeable to these Qualities his Actions being always performed with remarkable Dexterity Activity and Dispatch As the gentle and manageable Turn of his Mind seems drawn with an Opposition to the boisterous Temper of  Achilles  so his bodily Excellencies seem design'd as in Contraste to those of  Ajax  who appears with great Strength but heavy and unwieldy As he is forward to act in the Field so is he ready to speak in the Council But 'tis observable that his Counsels still incline to War and are byass'd rather on the side of Bravery than Caution Thus he advises to reject the Proposals of the  Trojans  in the seventh Book and not to accept of  Helen  her self tho'  Paris  should offer her In the ninth he opposes  Agamemnon  's Proposition to return to  Greece  in so strong a manner as to declare he will stay and continue the Siege himself if the General should depart And thus he hears without Concern  Achilles  's Refusal of a Reconciliation and doubts not to be able to carry on the War without him As for his private Character he appears a gallant Lover of Hospitality in his Behaviour to  Glaucus  in the sixth Book a Lover of Wisdom in his Assistance of  Nestor  in the eighth and his Choice of  Ulysses  to accompany him in the tenth upon the whole an open sincere Friend and a generous Enemy  The wonderful Actions he performs in this Battel seem to be the Effect of a noble Resentment at the Reproach he had receiv'd from  Agamemnon  in the foregoing Book to which these Deeds are the Answer He becomes immediately the second Hero of  Greece  and dreaded equally with  Achilles  by the  Trojans  At the first Sight of him his Enemies make a Question Whether he is a Man or a God  Aeneas  and  Pandarus  go against him whose Approach terrifies  Sthenelus  and the Apprehension of so great a Warrior marvellously exalts the Intrepidity of  Diomed Aeneas  himself is not sav'd but by the interposing of a Deity He pursues and wounds that Deity and  Aeneas  again escapes only by the Help of a stronger Power  Apollo  He attempts  Apollo  too retreats not till the God threatens him in his own Voice and even then retreats but a few Steps When he sees  Hector  and  Mars  himself in open Arms against him he had not retir'd tho' he was wounded but in Obedience to  Minerva  and then retires with his Face toward them But as soon as she permits him to engage with that God he conquers and sends him groaning to Heaven What Invention and what Conduct appears in this whole Episode What Boldness in raising a Character to such a Pitch and what Judgment in raising it by such Degrees While the most daring Flights of Poetry are employ'd to move our Admiration and at the same time the justest and closest Allegory to reconcile those Flights to moral Truth and Probability It may be farther remark'd that the high Degree to which  Homer  elevates this Character enters into the principal Design of his whole Poem which is to shew that the greatest Personal Qualities and Forces are of no Effect when Union is wanting among the chief Rulers and that nothing can avail till they are reconciled so as to act in Concert  III  VERSE  High on his Helm Celestial Light'nings play    This beautiful Passage gave occasion to  Zoilus  for an insipid Piece of Raillery who ask'd how it happen'd that the Hero escap'd burning by these Fires that continually broke from  his Armor  Eustathius  answers that there are several Examples in History of Fires being seen to break forth from human Bodies as Presages of Greatness and Glory Among the rest  Plutarch  in the Life of  Alexander  describes his Helmet much in this manner This is enough to warrant the Fiction and were there no such Example the same Author says very well that the Imagination of a Poet is not to be confined to strict Physical Truths But all Objections may easily be removed if we consider it as done by  Minerva  who had determined this Day to raise  Diomed  above all the Heroes and caused this Apparition to render him formidable The Power of a God makes it not only allowable but highly noble and greatly imagined by  Homer  as well as correspondent to a Miracle in holy Scripture where  Moses  is described with a Glory shining on his Face at his Descent from Mount  Sinai  a Parallel which  Spondanus  has taken notice of  Virgil  was too sensible of the Beauty of this Passage not to imitate it and it must be owned he has surpassed his Original  Ardet apex capiti cristisque ac vertice flamma  Funditur vastos umbo vomit aureus ignes  Non secus ac liquida si quando nocte Cometae  Sanguinei lugubre rubent aut Sirius ardor  Ille sitim morbosque ferens mortalibus aegris  Nascitur laevo contristat lumine caelum  In  Homer  's Comparison there is no other Circumstance alluded to but that of a remarkable Brightness Whereas  Virgil  's Comparison beside this seems to foretel the immense Slaughter his Hero was to make by comparing him first to a Comet which is vulgarly imagin'd a Prognostick if not the real Cause of much Misery to Mankind and again to the Dogstar which appearing with the greatest Brightness in the latter end of Summer is suppos'd the Occasion of all the Distempers of that sickly Season And methinks the Objection of  Macrobius  to this Place is not just who thinks the Simile unseasonably apply'd by  Virgil  to  Aeneas  because he was yet on his Ship and had not begun the Battel One may answer that this miraculous Appearance could never be  more proper than at the first Sight of the Hero to strike Terror into the Enemy and to prognosticate his approaching Victory  IV  VERSE Idaeus  fled Left the rich Chariot    It is finely said by M  Dacier  that  Homer  appears perhaps greater by the Criticisms that have been past upon him than by the Praises which have been given him  Zoilus  had a Cavil at this Place he thought it ridiculous in  Idaeus  to descend from his Chariot to fly which he might have done faster by the help of his Horses Three things are said in answer to this first that  Idaeus  knowing the Passion which  Diomed  had for Horses might hope the Pleasure of seizing these would retard him from pursuing him Next that  Homer  might design to represent in this Action of  Idaeus  the common Effect of Fear which disturbs the Understanding to such a degree as to make Men abandon the surest means to save themselves And then that  Idaeus  might have some Advantage of  Diomed  in Swiftness which he had reason to confide in But I fancy one may add another Solution which will better account for this Passage  Homer  's word is  which I believe would be better translated  non perseveravit  than  non sustinuit defendere fratrem interfectum  and then the Sense will be clear that  Idaeus  made an Effort to save his Brother's Body which proving impracticable he was obliged to fly with the utmost Precipitation One may add that his alighting from his Chariot was not that he could run faster on foot but that he could sooner escape by mixing with the Crowd of common Soldiers There is a Particular exactly of the same Nature in the Book of  Judges  Ch ‚Ñ£ where  Sisera  alights to fly in the same manner  V  VERSE  Who bathe in Blood    It may seem something unnatural that  Pallas  at a time when she is endeavouring to work upon  Mars  under the Appearance of Benevolence and Kindness should make use of Terms which seem so full of  bitter Reproaches but these will appear very properly applied to this warlike Deity For Persons of this martial Character who scorning Equity and Reason carry all things by Force are better pleas'd to be celebrated for their Power than their Virtue Statues are rais'd to the Conquerors that is the Destroyers of Nations who are complemented for excelling in the Arts of Ruine  Demetrius  the Son of  Antigonus  was celebrated by his Flatterers with the Title of  Poliorcetes  a Term equivalent to one here made use of  VI  VERSE  The God of Arms and martial Maid retreat    The Retreat of  Mars  from the  Trojans  intimates that Courage forsook them It may be said then that  Minerva  's Absence from the  Greeks  will signify that Wisdom deserted them also It is true she does desert them but it is at a time when there was more occasion for gallant Actions than for wise Counsels  Eustathius  VII  VERSE  The  Greeks  the  Trojan  Race pursue    Homer  always appears very zealous for the Honour of  Greece  which alone might be a Proof of his being of that Country against the Opinion of those who would have him of other Nations  It is observable thro' the whole Ilaid that he endeavours every where to represent the  Greeks  as superior to the  Trojans  in Valor and the Art of War In the beginning of the third Book he describes the  Trojans  rushing on to the Battel in a barbarous and confus'd manner with loud Shouts and Cries while the  Greeks  advance in the most profound Silence and exact Order And in the latter Part of the fourth Book where the two Armies march to the Engagement the  Greeks  are animated by  Pallas  while  Mars  instigates the  Trojans  the Poet attributing by this plain Allegory to the former a wellconducted Valor to the latter rash Strength and brutal Force So that the Abilities of each Nation are distinguish'd by the Characters of the Deities who assist them  But in this Place as  Eustathius  observes the Poet being willing to shew how much the  Greeks  excell'd their Enemies when they engag'd only with their proper Force and when each side was alike destitute of divine Assistance takes occasion to remove the Gods out of the Battel and then each  Grecian  Chief gives signal Instances of Valor superior to the  Trojans  A modern Critick observes that this constant Superiority of the  Greeks  in the Art of War Valor and Number is contradictory to the main Design of the Poem which is to make the Return of  Achilles  appear necessary for the Preservation of the  Greeks  but this Contradiction vanishes when we reflect that the Affront given  Achilles  was the occasion of  Jupiter  's interposing in favour of the  Trojans  Wherefore the Anger of  Achilles  was not pernicious to the  Greeks  purely because it kept him inactive but because it occasion'd  Jupiter  to afflict them in such a manner as made it necessary to appease  Achilles  in order to render  Jupiter  propitious  VIII  VERSE  Back from the Car he tumbles    It is in Poetry as in Painting the Postures and Attitudes of each Figure ought to be different  Homer  takes care not to draw two Persons in the same Posture one is tumbled from his Chariot another is slain as he ascends it a third as he endeavours to escape on Foot a Conduct which is every where observed by the Poet  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  Next artful  Phereclus  This Character of  Phereclus  is finely imagined and presents a noble Moral in an uncommon manner There ran a Report that the  Trojans  had formerly receiv'd an Oracle commanding them to follow Husbandry and not apply themselves to Navigation  Homer  from hence takes occasion to feign that the Shipwright who presumed to build the Fleet of  Paris  when he took his fatal Voyage to  Greece  was overtaken by the divine  Vengeance so long after as in this Battel One may take notice too in this as in many other Places of the remarkable Disposition  Homer  shews to  Mechanicks  he never omits an Opportunity either of describing a Piece of Workmanship or of celebrating an Artist  X  VERSE  Antenor  's Offspring from a foreign Bed  Whose gen'rous Spouse  Theano  heav'nly Fair  Nurs'd the young Stranger with a Mother's Care  Homer  in this remarkable Passage commends the fair  Theano  for breeding up a Bastard of her Husband's with the same Tenderness as her own Children This Lady was a Woman of the first Quality and as it appears in the sixth Iliad the high Priestess of  Minerva  So that one cannot imagine the Education of this Child was imposed upon her by the Authority or Power of  Antenor Homer  himself takes care to remove any such derogatory Notion by particularizing the Motive of this unusual Piece of Humanity to have been to please her Husband  Nor ought we to lessen this Commendation by thinking the Wives of those Times in general were more complaisant than those of our own The Stories of  Phoenix Clytemnestra Medea  and many others are plain Instances how highly the keeping of Mistresses was resented by the married Ladies But there was indeed a difference between the  Greeks  and  Asiaticks  as to their Notions of Marriage For it is certain the latter allowed Plurality of Wives  Priam  had many lawful ones and some of them Princesses who brought great Dowries  Theano  was an  Asiatick  and that is the most we can grant for the Son she nurs'd so carefully was apparently not by a Wife but by a Mistress and her Passions were naturally the same with those of the  Grecian  Women As to the Degree of Regard then shewn to the Bastards they were carefully enough educated tho' not like this of  Antenor  as the lawful Issue nor admitted to an equal share of Inheritance  Megapenthes  and  Nicostratus  were excluded from the Inheritance of  Sparta  because they were born of BondWomen  as  Pausanias  says But  Neoptolemus  a natural Son of  Achilles  by  Deidamia  succeeded in his Father's Kingdom perhaps with respect to his Mother's Quality who was a Princess Upon the whole however that Matter stood  Homer  was very favourable to Bastards and has paid them more Complements than one in his Works If I am not mistaken  Ulysses  reckons himself one in the  Odysseis Agamemnon  in the eighth Iliad plainly accounts it no Disgrace when charm'd with the noble Exploits of young  Teucer  and praising him in the Rapture of his Heart he just then takes occasion to mention his Illegitimacy as a kind of Panegyrick upon him The Reader may consult the Passage ‚Ñ£ of the Original and ‚Ñ£ of the Translation From all this I should not be averse to believe that  Homer  himself was a Bastard as  Virgil  was of which I think this Observation a better Proof than what is said for it in the common  Lives  of him  XI  VERSE  Hypsenor  gen'rous and divine  Sprung from the brave  Dolopion  's mighty Line  Who near ador'd  Scamander  made Abode  Priest of the Stream and honour'd as a God  From the Number of Circumstances put together here and in many other Passages of the Parentage Place of Abode Profession and Quality of the Persons our Author mentions I think it is plain he composed his Poem from some Records or Traditions of the Actions of the Times preceding and complied with the Truth of History Otherwise these particular Descriptions of Genealogies and other minute Circumstances would have been an Affectation extremely needless and unreasonable This Consideration will account for several things that seem odd or tedious not to add that one may naturally believe he took these Occasions of paying a Complement to many great Men and Families of his Patrons both in  Greece  and  Asia  XII  VERSE  Down sinks the Priest    Homer  makes him die upon the cutting off his Arm which is an Instance of his Skill for the great Flux of Blood that must follow such a Wound would be the immediate Cause of Death  XIII  VERSE  Thus Torrents swift and strong    This whole Passage says  Eustathius  is extremely beautiful It describes the Hero carry'd by an Enthusiastick Valor into the midst of his Enemies and so mingled with their Ranks as if himself were a  Trojan  And the Simile wonderfully illustrates this Fury proceeding from an uncommon Infusion of Courage from Heaven in resembling it not to a constant River but a Torrent rising from an extraordinary Burst of Rain This Simile is one of those that draws along with it some foreign Circumstances We must not often expect from  Homer  those minute Resemblances in every Branch of a Comparison which are the Pride of modern Similes If that which one may call the main Action of it or the principal Point of Likeness be preserved he affects as to the rest rather to present the Mind with a great Image than to fix it down to an exact one He is sure to make a fine Picture in the whole without drudging on the under Parts like those free Painters who one would think had only made here and there a few very significant Strokes that give Form and Spirit to all the Piece For the present Comparison  Virgil  in the second  Aeneid  has inserted an Imitation of it which I cannot think equal to this tho'  Scaliger  prefers  Virgil  's to all our Author's Similitudes from Rivers put together  Non sic aggeribus ruptis cum spumeus amnis  Exiit oppositasque evicit gurgite moles  Fertur in arva furens cumulo camposque per omnes  Cum stabulis armenta trahit  Not with so fierce a Rage the foaming Flood  Roars when he finds his rapid Course withstood  Bears down the Dams with unresisted Sway  And sweeps the Cattel and the Cotts away  Dryden  XIV  VERSE  The Dart stopt short of Life    Homer  says it did not kill him and I am at a Loss why M  Dacier  translates it  The Wound was slight  when just after the Arrow is said to have pierc'd  quite thro'  and she herself there turns it  Per√ßoit l'espaule d'outre en outre  Had it been so slight he would not have needed the immediate Assistance of  Minerva  to restore his usual Vigor and enable him to continue the Fight  XV  VERSE  From mortal Mists I purge thy Eyes    This Fiction of  Homer  says M  Dacier  is founded upon an important Truth of Religion not unknown to the Pagans that God only can open the Eyes of Men and enable them to see what they cannot discover by their own Capacity There are frequent Examples of this in the Old Testament God opens the Eyes of  Hagar  that she might see the Fountain in  Genes  ‚Ñ£ So  Numbers  ‚Ñ£  The Lord open'd the Eyes of  Balaam  and he saw the Angel of the Lord standing in his way and his Sword drawn in his Hand  A Passage much resembling this of our Author  Venus  in  Virgil  's second  Aeneid  performs the same Office to  Aeneas  and shews him the Gods who were engag'd in the Destruction of  Troy  Aspice namque omnem quae nunc obducta tuenti  Mortales hebetat visus tibi humida circum  Caligat nubem eripiam  Apparent dirae facies inimicaque Trojae  Numina magna De√ªm  Milton  seems likewise to have imitated this where he makes  Michael  open  Adam  's Eyes to see the future Revolutions of the World and Fortunes of his Posterity Book  He purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue  The visual Nerve for he had much to see  And from the Well of Life three Drops distill'd  This distinguishing Sight of  Diomed  was given him only for the present Occasion and Service in which he was employ'd by  Pallas  For we find in the sixth Book that upon meeting  Glaucus  he is ignorant whether that Hero be a Man or a God  XVI  VERSE  No mystic Dream    This Line in the Original  contains as puzzling a Passage for the Construction as I have met with in  Homer  Most Interpreters join the negative Particle  with the Verb  which may receive three different Meanings That  Eurydamas  had not interpreted the Dreams of his Children when they went to the Wars or that he had foretold them by their Dreams they should never return from the Wars or that he should now no more have the Satisfaction to interpret their Dreams at their Return After all this Construction seems forced and no way agreeable to the general Idiom of the  Greek  Language or to  Homer  's simple Diction in particular If we join  with  I think the most obvious Sense will be this  Diomed  attacks the two Sons of  Eurydamas  an old Interpreter of Dreams his Children not returning the Prophet sought by his Dreams to know their Fate however they fall by the Hands of  Diomed  This Interpretation seems natural and poetical and tends to move Compassion which is almost constantly the Design of the Poet in his frequent short Digressions concerning the Circumstances and Relations of dying Persons  XVII  VERSE  To Strangers now descends his wealthy Store    This is a Circumstance than which nothing could be imagined more tragical considering the Character of the Father  Homer  says the Trustees of the remote collateral Relations seiz'd the Estate before his Eyes according to a Custom of those Times which to a covetous old Man must be the greatest of Miseries  XVIII  VERSE  Divine  Aeneas  It is here  Aeneas  begins to act and if we take a View of the whole Episode of this Hero in  Homer  where he makes but an Underpart it will appear that  Virgil  has kept him perfectly in the same Character in his Poem where he shines as the first Hero His Piety and his Valor tho' not drawn at so full a length are mark'd no less in the Original than in the Copy It is the manner of  Homer  to express very strongly the Character of each Person in the first Speech he is made to utter in the Poem In this of  Aeneas  there is a great Air of Piety in those Strokes  Is he some God who punishes  Troy  for having neglected his Sacrifices  And then that Sentence  The Anger of Heaven is terrible  When he is in Danger afterwards he is saved by the heavenly Assistance of two Deities at once and his Wounds cured in the holy Temple of  Pergamus  by  Latona  and  Diana  As to his  Valor  he is second only to  Hector  and in personal Bravery as great in the  Greek  Author as in the  Roman  He is made to exert himself on Emergencies of the first Importance and Hazard rather than on common Occasions he checks  Diomed  here in the midst of his Fury in the thirteenth Book defends his Friend  Deiphobus  before it was his Turn to fight being placed in one of the hindmost Ranks which  Homer  to take off all Objection to his Valor tells us happen'd because  Priam  had an Animosity to him tho' he was one of the bravest of the Army He is one of those who rescue  Hector  when he is overthrown by  Ajax  in the fourteenth Book And what alone were sufficient to establish him a firstrate Hero he is the first that dares resist  Achilles  himself at his Return to the Fight in all his Rage for the Loss of  Patroclus  He indeed avoids encountering  two at once in the present Book and shews upon the whole a sedate and deliberate Courage which if not so glaring as that of some others is yet more just It is worth considering how thoroughly  Virgil  penetrated into all this and saw into the very Idea of  Homer  so as to extend and call forth the whole Figure in its full Dimensions and Colours from the slightest Hints and Sketches which were but casually touch'd by  Homer  and even in some Points too where they were rather left to be understood than express'd And this by the way ought to be consider'd by those Criticks who object to  Virgil  's  Hero  the want of that sort of Courage which strikes us so much in  Homer  's  Achilles Aeneas  was not the Creature of  Virgil  's Imagination but one whom the World was already acquainted with and expected to see continued in the same Character and one who perhaps was chosen for the Hero of the  Latin  Poem not only as he was the Founder of the  Roman  Empire but as this more calm and regular Character better agreed with the Temper and Genius of the Poet himself  XIX  VERSE  Skill'd in the Bow  c  We see thro' this whole Discourse of  Pandarus  the Character of a vainglorious passionate Prince who being skill'd in the Use of the Bow was highly valued by himself and others for this Excellence but having been successless in two different Trials of his Skill he is rais'd into an outragious Passion which vents itself in vain Threats on his guiltless Bow  Eustathius  on this Passage relates a Story of a  Paphlagonian  famous like him for his Archery who having miss'd his Aim at repeated Trials was so transported by Rage that breaking his Bow and Arrows he executed a more fatal Vengeance by hanging himself  XX  VERSE  Ten polish'd Chariots    Among the many Pictures  Homer  gives us of the Simplicity of the Heroic Ages he mingles from time to time some Hints of an extraordinary  Magnificence We have here a Prince who has all these Chariots for Pleasure at one time with their particular Sets of Horses to each and the most sumptuous Coverings in their Stables But we must remember that he speaks of an  Asiatic  Prince those  Barbarians  living in great Luxury  Dacier  XXI  VERSE  Yet to Thrift inclin'd    'Tis  Eustathius  his Remark that  Pandarus  did this out of Avarice to save the Expence of his Horses I like this Conjecture because nothing seems more judicious than to give a Man of a perfidious Character a strong Tincture of Avarice  XXII  VERSE  And undissembled Gore pursu'd the Wound    The  Greek  is  He says he is sure it was real Blood that follow'd his Arrow because it was anciently a Custom particularly among the  Spartans  to have Ornaments and Figures of a purple Colour on their BreastPlates that the Blood they lost might not be seen by the Soldiers and tend to their Discouragement  Plutarch  in his  Instit Lacon  takes notice of this Point of Antiquity and I wonder it escap'd Madam  Dacier  in her Translation  XXIII  VERSE  Nor  Phoebus'  honour'd Gift disgrace    For  Homer  tells us in the second Book ‚Ñ£ of the Catalogue that the Bow and Shafts of  Pandarus  were given him by  Apollo  XXIV  VERSE  Haste seize the Whip  c  Homer  means not here that one of the Heroes should alight or descend from the Chariot but only that he should quit the Reins to the Management of the other and stand on Foot upon the Chariot to fight from thence As one might use the Expression  to descend from the Ship  to signify to quit the Helm or Oar in order to take up Arms This is the Note of  Eustathius  by which it appears that most of the Translators are mistaken in the Sense of this Passage and among the rest Mr  Hobbes  XXV  VERSE  One Chief at least beneath this Arm shall die    It is the manner of our Author to make his Persons have some Intimation from within either of prosperous or adverse Fortune before it happens to them In the present Instance we have seen  Aeneas  astonish'd at the great Exploits of  Diomed  proposing to himself the Means of his Escape by the Swiftness of his Horses before he advances to encounter him On the other hand  Diomed  is so filled with Assurance that he gives Orders here to  Sthenelus  to seize those Horses before they come up to him The Opposition of these two as Mad  Dacier  has remark'd is very observable  XXVI  VERSE  The Coursers of Aethereal Breed    We have already observed the great Delight  Homer  takes in Horses He makes some Horses as well as Heroes of celestial Race and if he has been thought too fond of the  Genealogies  of some of his Warriors in relating them even in a Battel we find him here as willing to trace that of his Horses in the same Circumstance These were of that Breed which  Jupiter  bestow'd upon  Tros  and far superior to the common Strain of  Trojan  Horses So that according to  Eustathius  's Opinion the Translators are mistaken who turn    the Trojan Horses  in ‚Ñ£ of the Original where  Aeneas  extolls their Qualities to  Pandarus  The same Author takes notice that Frauds in the Case of Horses have been thought excusable in all Times and commends  Anchises  for this Piece of Theft  Virgil  was so well pleas'd with it as to imitate this Passage in the seventh  Aeneid  Absenti Aeneae currum geminosque jugales  Semine ab aethereo spirantes naribus ignem  Illorum de gente patri quos daedala Circe  Supposita de matre nothos furata creavit  XXVII  VERSE  Full in his Face it enter'd    It has been ask'd how  Diomed  being on Foot could naturally be suppos'd to give such a Wound as is describ'd here Were it never so improbable the express mention that  Minerva  conducted the Javelin to that Part would render this Passage unexceptionable But without having recourse to a Miracle such a Wound might be receiv'd by  Pandarus  either if he stoop'd or if his Enemy took the Advantage of a rising Ground by which means he might not impossibly stand higher tho' the other were in a Chariot This is the Solution given by the ancient  Scholia  which is confirm'd by the Lowness of the Chariots observed in the Essay on  Homer  's  Battels  XXVIII  VERSE  To guard his slaughter'd Friend  Aeneas  flies    This protecting of the dead Body was not only an Office of Piety agreeable to the Character of  Aeneas  in particular but look'd upon as a Matter of great Importance in those Times It was believ'd that the very Soul of the deceas'd suffer'd by the Body's remaining destitute of the Rites of Sepulture as not being else admitted to pass the Waters of  Styx  Haec omnis quam cernis inops inhumataque turba est  Portitor ille Charon hi quos vehit unda sepulti  Nec ripas datur horrendas rauca fluenta  Transportare prius quam sedibus ossa quierunt  Centum errant annos volitantque haec litora circum  Virg  Aen    Whoever considers this will not be surprized at those long and obstinate Combates for the Bodies of the Heroes so frequent in the  Iliad Homer  thought it of such Weight that he has put this Circumstance of want of Burial into the  Proposition  at the beginning of his Poem as one of the chief Misfortunes that befel the  Greeks  XXIX  VERSE  Not two strong Men    This Opinion of a Degeneracy of human Size and Strength in the Process of Ages has been very general  Lucretius Lib    Jamque adeo fracta est aetas effoetaque tellus  Vix animalia parva creat quae cuncta creavit  Saecla deditque ferarum ingentia corpora partu  The active Life and Temperance of the first Men before their native Powers were prejudiced by Luxury may be supposed to have given them this Advantage  Celsus  in his first Book observes that  Homer  mentions no sort of Diseases in the old Heroic Times but what were immediately inflicted by Heaven as if their Temperance and Exercise preserved them from all besides  Virgil  imitates this Passage with a farther Allowance of the Decay in Proportion to the Distance of his Time from that of  Homer  For he says it was an Attempt that exceeded the Strength of  twelve  Men instead of  two  Saxum circumspicit ingens  Vix illud lecti bis sex cervice subirent  Qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus  Juvenal  has made an agreeable Use of this Thought in his fourteenth Satyr  Nam genus hoc vivo jam decrescebat Homero  Terra malos homines nunc educat atque pusillos  XXX  VERSE  Hid from the Foe behind her shining Veil    Homer  says she spread her Veil that it might be a Defence against the Darts How comes it then afterwards to be pierc'd thro' when  Venus  is wounded It is manifest the Veil was not impenetrable and is said here to be a Defence only as it render'd  Aeneas  invisible by being interposed This is the Observation of  Eustathius  and was thought too material to be neglected in the Translation  XXXI  VERSE  To bold  Deipylus  Whom most he lov'd    Sthenelus  says M  Dacier  loved  Deipylus parce qu'il avoit la mesme humeur que luy la mesme sagesse  The Words in the Original are    Because his Mind was equal and consentaneous to his own  which I should rather translate with regard to the Character of  Sthenelus  that he had the same  Bravery  than the same  Wisdom  For that  Sthenelus  was not remarkable for Wisdom appears from many Passages and particularly from his Speech to  Agamemnon  in the fourth Book upon which see  Plutarch  's Remark  Note    XXXII  VERSE  The Chief in chace of  Venus  flies    We have seen with what Ease  Venus  takes  Paris  out of the Battel in the third Book when his Life was in danger from  Menelaus  but here when she has a Charge of more Importance and nearer Concern she is not able to preserve her self or her Son from the Fury of  Diomed  The difference of Success in two Attempts so like each other is occasion'd by that Penetration of Sight with which  Pallas  had endu'd her Favorite For the Gods in their Intercourse with Men are not ordinarily seen but when they please to render themselves visible wherefore  Venus  might think her self and her Son secure from the Insolence of this daring Mortal but was in this deceiv'd  being ignorant of that Faculty wherewith the Hero was enabled to distinguish Gods as well as Men  XXXIII  VERSE  Her snowie Hand the razing Steel profan'd    Plutarch  in his Symposiacks  l  tells us that  Maximus  the Rhetorician propos'd this farfetch'd Question at a Banquet  On which of her Hands  Venus  was wounded  and that  Zopyrion  answer'd it by asking  On which of his Legs  Philip  was lame  But  Maximus  reply'd it was a different Case For  Demosthenes  left no Foundation to guess at the one whereas  Homer  gives a Solution of the other in saying that  Diomed  throwing his Spear across wounded her Wrist so that it was her right Hand he hurt her left being opposite to his right He adds another humorous Reason from  Pallas  's reproaching her afterwards as having got this Wound while she was stroking and solliciting some  Grecian  Lady and unbuckling her Zone  An Action  says this Philosopher  in which no one would make use of the left Hand  XXXIV  VERSE  Such Stream as issues from a wounded God    This is one of those Passages in  Homer  which have given occasion to that famous Censure of  Tully  and  Longinus That he makes Gods of his Heroes and Mortals of his Gods  These taken in a general Sense appear'd the highest Impiety to  Plato  and  Pythagoras  one of whom has banish'd  Homer  from his Commonwealth and the other said he was tortured in Hell for Fictions of this Nature But if a due Distinction be made of a difference among Beings superior to Mankind which both the Pagans and Christians have allowed these Fables may be easily accounted for  Wounds inflicted on the Dragon Bruising of the Serpent's Head  and other such metaphorical Images are consecrated in holy Writ and apply'd to Angelical and incorporeal Natures But in our Author's Days they had a Notion of Gods that were corporeal to whom they ascribed Bodies tho' of a more subtil Kind than  those of Mortals So in this very Place he supposes them to have Blood but Blood of a finer and superior Nature Notwithstanding the foregoing Censures  Milton  has not scrupled to imitate and apply this to Angels in the Christian System when  Satan  is wounded by  Michael  in his sixth Book  Then  Satan  first knew Pain  And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd so sore  The griding Sword with discontinuous Wound  Pass'd thro' him but th' Aetherial Substance clos'd  Not long divisible and from the gash  A Stream of Nectarous Humour issuing flow'd  Sanguin such as Celestial Spirits may bleed  Yet soon he heal'd for Spirits that live throughout  Vital in ev'ry Part not as frail Man  In Entrails Head or Heart Liver or Reins  Cannot but by annihilating die  Aristotle Cap    Art Poet  excuses  Homer  for following Fame and common Opinion in his Account of the Gods tho' no way agreeable to Truth The Religion of those Times taught no other Notions of the Deity than that the Gods were Beings of human Forms and Passions so that any but a real  Anthropomorphite  would probably have past among the ancient  Greeks  for an impious Heretick They thought their Religion which worshipped the Gods in Images of human Shape was much more refin'd and rational than that of  Aegypt  and other Nations who ador'd them in animal or monstrous Forms And certainly Gods of human Shape cannot justly be esteemed or described otherwise than as a celestial Race superior only to mortal Men by greater Abilities and a more extensive Degree of Wisdom and Strength subject however to the necessary Inconveniencies consequent to corporeal Beings  Cicero  in his Book  de Nat Deor  urges this Consequence strongly against the  Epicureans  who tho' they depos'd the Gods from any Power in creating or governing the World yet maintain'd their Existence in human Forms  Non enim sentitis quam multa vobis suscipienda sunt si impetraveritis ut concedamus eandem esse hominum deorum  figuram omnis cultus curatio corporis erit eadem adhibenda Deo quae adhibetur homini ingressus cursus accubatio inclinatio sessio comprehensio ad extremum etiam sermo oratio Nam quod mares Deos faeminas esse dicitis quid sequatur videtis  This Particular of the wounding of  Venus  seems to be a Fiction of  Homer  's own Brain naturally deducible from the Doctrine of corporeal Gods abovementioned and considered as Poetry no way shocking Yet our Author as if he had foreseen some Objection has very artfully inserted a Justification of this bold Stroke in the Speech  Dione  soon after makes to  Venus  For as it was natural to comfort her Daughter by putting her in mind that many other Deities had receiv'd as ill Treatment from Mortals by the Permission of  Jupiter  so it was of great Use to the Poet to enumerate those ancient Fables to the same Purpose which being then generally assented to might obtain Credit for his own This fine Remark belongs to  Eustathius  XXXV  VERSE  Unlike our gross diseas'd terrestrial Blood  c  The Opinion of the Incorruptibility of Celestial Matter seems to have been receiv'd in the Time of  Homer  For he makes the Immortality of the Gods to depend upon the incorruptible Nature of the Nutriment by which they are sustained As the Mortality of Men to proceed from the corruptible Materials of which they are made and by which they are nourished We have several Instances in him from whence this may be inferred as when  Diomed  questions  Glaucus  if he be a God or a Mortal he adds  One who is sustained by the Fruits of the Earth  Lib ‚Ñ£  XXXVI  VERSE  Low at his Knee she begg'd    All the former  English  Translators make it  she fell on her Knees  an Oversight occasion'd by the want of a competent Knowledge in Antiquities without which no Man can tolerably understand this Author For the Custom of praying on the Knees was  unknown to the  Greeks  and in use only among the  Hebrews  XXXVII  VERSE  And share those Griefs inferior Pow'rs must share    The word  Inferior  is added by the Translator to open the Distinction  Homer  makes between the Divinity itself which he represents impassible and the subordinate celestial Beings or Spirits  XXXVIII  VERSE  The mighty  Mars c  Homer  in these Fables as upon many other Occasions makes a great Show of his Theological Learning which was the manner of all the  Greeks  who had travell'd into  Aegypt  Those who would see these Allegories explained at large may consult  Eustathius  on this Place  Virgil  speaks much in the same Figure when he describes the happy Peace with which  Augustus  had blest the World  Furor impius intus  Saeva sedens super arma centum vinctus a√´nis  Post tergum nodis fremit horridus ore cruento  XXXIX  VERSE  Perhaps had perish'd    Some of  Homer  's Censurers have inferr'd from this Passage that the Poet represents his Gods subject to Death when nothing but great Misery is here described It is a common way of Speech to use  Perdition  and Destruction for  Misfortune  The Language of Scripture calls eternal Punishment  perishing everlastingly  There is a remarkable Passage to this Purpose in  Tacitus An  which very lively represents the miserable State of a distracted Tyrant It is the beginning of a Letter from  Tiberius  to the Senate  Quid scribam vobis P C aut quomodo scribam aut quid omnino non scribam hoc tempore Dii me deaeque pejus  perdant  quam  perire  quotidie sentio si scio  XL  VERSE  No Infant on his Knees shall call him Sire    This is  Homer  's manner of foretelling that he shall perish unfortunately in Battel which is infinitely a more artful way of conveying that Thought than by a direct Expression He does not simply say he shall never return from the War but intimates as much by describing the Loss of the most sensible and affecting Pleasure that a Warrior can receive at his Return Of the like Nature is the Prophecy at the end of this Speech of the Hero's Death by representing it in a Dream of his Wife's There are many fine Strokes of this kind in the Prophetical Parts of the Old Testament Nothing is more natural than  Dione  's forming these Images of Revenge upon  Diomed  the Hope of which Vengeance was so proper a Topick of Consolation to  Venus  XLI  VERSE  To stretch thee pale  c  Virgil  has taken notice of this threatning Denunciation of Vengeance tho' fulfill'd in a different manner where  Diomed  in his Answer to the Embassador of K  Latinus  enumerates his Misfortunes and imputes the Cause of them to this impious Attempt upon  Venus Aeneid Lib    Invidisse Deos patriis ut redditus oris  Conjugium optatum pulchram Calydona viderem  Nunc etiam horribili visu portenta sequuntur  Et socii amissi petierunt Aequora pennis  Fluminibusque vagantur aves heu dira meorum  Supplicia scopulos lachrymosis vocibus implent  Haec adeo ex illo mihi jam speranda fuerunt  Tempore cum ferro caelestia corpora demens  Appetii Veneris violavi vulnere dextram  XLII  VERSE  Thy distant Wife    The Poet seems here to complement the Fair Sex at the Expence of Truth by concealing the Character of  Aegiale  whom he has describ'd with the Disposition of a faithful Wife tho' the History of those Times represents her as an abandon'd Prostitute who gave up her own Person and her Husband's Crown to her Lover So that  Diomed  at his Return from  Troy  when he expected to be receiv'd with all the Tenderness of a loving Spouse found his Bed and Throne possess'd by an Adulterer was forc'd to fly his Country and seek Refuge and Subsistence in foreign Lands Thus the offended Goddess executed her Vengeance by the proper Effects of her own Power by involving the Hero in a Series of Misfortunes proceeding from the Incontinence of his Wife  XLIII  VERSE  The Sire of Gods and Men superior smil'd    One may observe the Decorum and Decency our Author constantly preserves on this Occasion  Jupiter  only  smiles  the other Gods  laugh out  That  Homer  was no Enemy to Mirth may appear from several Places of his Poem which so serious as it is is interspers'd with many Gayeties indeed more than he has been follow'd in by the succeeding Epic Poets  Milton  who was perhaps fonder of him than the rest has given most into the ludicrous of which his  Paradise of Fools  in the third Book and his  Jesting Angels  in the sixth are extraordinary Instances Upon the Confusion of  Babel  he says there was  great Laughter in Heaven  as  Homer  calls the Laughter of the Gods in the first Book  an  inextinguishable Laugh  But the Scripture might perhaps embolden the  English  Poet which says  The Lord shall laugh them to Scorn  and the like  Plato  is very angry at  Homer  for making the Deities laugh as a high Indecency and Offence to Gravity He says the Gods in our Author represent Magistrates and Persons in Authority and are designed  as Examples to such On this Supposition he blames him for proposing immoderate Laughter as a thing decent in great Men I forgot to take notice in its proper Place that the Epither  inextinguishable  is not to be taken literally for dissolute or ceasless Mirth but was only a Phrase of that time to signify Chearfulness and seasonable Gayety in the same manner as we may now say  to die with Laughter  without being understood to be in danger of dying with it The Place Time and Occasion were all agreeable to Mirth It was at a Banquet and  Plato  himself relates several things that past at the Banquet of  Agathon  which had not been either decent or rational at any other Season The same may be said of the present Passage Raillery could never be more natural than when two of the Female Sex had an Opportunity of triumphing over another whom they hated  Homer  makes Wisdom her self not able even in the Presence of  Jupiter  to resist the Temptation She breaks into a ludicrous Speech and the supreme Being himself vouchsafes a Smile at it But this as  Eustathius  remarks is not introduduced without Judgment and Precaution For we see he makes  Minerva  first beg  Jupiter  's Permission for this Piece of Freedom  Permit thy Daughter gracious  Jove in which he asks the Reader's leave to enliven his Narration with this Piece of Gayety  XLIV  VERSE  He dreads his Fury and some Steps retires    Diomed  still maintains his intrepid Character he retires but a  Step or two  even from  Apollo  The Conduct of  Homer  is remarkably just and rational here He gives  Diomed  no sort of Advantage over  Apollo  because he would not feign what was entirely incredible and what no Allegory could justify He wounds  Venus  and  Mars  as it is morally possible to overcome the irregular Passions which are represented by those Deities But it is impossible to vanquish  Apollo  in whatsoever Capacity he is considered either as the  Sun  or as  Destiny  One may shoot at the Sun but not hurt him and one may strive against Destiny but not surmount it  Eustathius  XLV  VERSE  A Phantome rais'd    The Fiction of a God's placing a Phantome instead of the Hero to delude the Enemy and continue the Engagement means no more than that the Enemy thought he was in the Battel This is the Language of Poetry which prefers a marvellous Fiction to a plain and simple Truth the Recital whereof would be cold and unaffecting Thus  Minerva  's guiding a Javelin signifies only that it was thrown with Art and Dexterity  Mars  taking upon him the Shape of  Acamas  that the Courage of  Acamas  incited him to do so and in like manner of the rest The present Passage is copied by  Virgil  in the tenth  Aeneid  where the Spectre of  Aeneas  is raised by  Juno  or the  Air  as it is here by  Apollo  or the  Sun  both equally proper to be employ'd in forming an Apparition Whoever will compare the two Authors on this Subject will observe with what admirable Art and what exquisite Ornaments the latter has improved and beautify'd his Original  Scaliger  in comparing these Places has absurdly censured the Phantome of  Homer  for its Inactivity whereas it was only form'd to represent the Hero lying on the Ground without any Appearance of Life or Motion  Spencer  in the eighth Canto of the third Book seems to have improved this Imagination in the Creation of his false  Florimel  who performs all the Functions of Life and gives occasion for many Adventures  XLVI  VERSE  The Speech of  Sarpedon  to  Hector  It will be hard to find a Speech more warm and spirited than this of  Sarpedon  or which comprehends so much in so few Words Nothing could be more artfully thought upon to pique  Hector  who was so jealous of his Country's Glory than to tell him he had formerly conceiv'd too great a Notion of the  Trojan  Valor and to exalt the Auxiliaries above his Countrymen The Description  Sarpedon  gives of the little Concern or Interest himself had in the War in Opposition to the  Necessity and imminent Danger of the  Trojans  greatly strengthens this Preference and lays the Charge very home upon their Honour In the latter Part which prescribes  Hector  his Duty there is a particular Reprimand in telling him how much it behoves him to animate and encourage the Auxiliaries for this is to say in other Words You should exhort them and they are forc'd on the contrary to exhort you  XLVII  VERSE Ceres'  sacred Floor    Homer  calls the Threshing Floor  sacred  says  Eustathius  not only as it was consecrated to  Ceres  but in regard of its great Use and Advantage to human Kind in which Sense also he frequently gives the same Epithet to  Cities  c This Simile is of an exquisite Beauty  XLVIII  VERSE  So when th' embattel'd Clouds    This Simile contains as proper a Comparison and as fine a Picture of Nature as any in  Homer  Yet however it is to be fear'd the Beauty and Propriety of it will not be very obvious to many Readers because it is the Description of a natural Appearance which they have not had an Opportunity to remark and which can be observed only in a mountainous Country It happens frequently in very calm Weather that the Atmosphere is charg'd with thick Vapors whose Gravity is such that they neither rise nor fall but remain poiz'd in the Air at a certain Height where they continue frequently for several Days together In a plain Country this occasions no other visible Appearance but of an uniform clouded Sky but in a Hilly Region these Vapors are to be seen covering the Tops and stretch'd along the Sides of the Mountains the clouded Parts above being terminated and distinguish'd from the clear Parts below by a strait Line running parallel to the Horizon as far as the Mountains extend The whole Compass of Nature cannot afford a nobler and more exact Representation of a numerous Army drawn up in Line of Battel and expecting the Charge The longextended even front the  Closeness of the Ranks the Firmness Order and Silence of the whole are all drawn with great Resemblance in this one Comparison The Poet adds that this Appearance is while  Boreas  and the other boisterous Winds which disperse and break the Clouds are laid asleep This is as exact as it is Poetical for when the Winds arise this regular Order is soon dissolv'd This Circumstance is added to the Description as an ominous Anticipation of the Flight and Dissipation of the  Greeks  which soon ensued when  Mars  and  Hector  broke in upon them  XLIX  VERSE  Ye  Greeks  be Men  c  If  Homer  in the longer Speeches of the Iliad says all that could be said by Eloquence in the shorter he says all that can be said with Judgment Whatever some few modern Criticks have thought it will be found upon due Reflection that the Length or Brevity of his Speeches is determined as the Occasions either allow Leisure or demand Haste This concise Oration of  Agamemnon  is a Masterpiece in the Laconic way The Exigence required he should say something very powerful and no Time was to be lost He therefore warms the Brave and the Timorous by one and the same Exhortation which at once moves by the Love of Glory and the Fear of Death It is short and full like that of the brave  Scotch  General under  Gustavus  who upon Sight of the Enemy said only this  See ye those Lads Either fell them or they'll fell you  L  VERSE  Your brave Associates and your selves revere    This noble Exhortation of  Agamemnon  is correspondent to the wise Scheme of  Nestor  in the second Book where he advised to rank the Soldiers of the same Nation together that being known to each other all might be incited either by a generous Emulation or a decent Shame  Spondanus  LI  VERSE Mars  urg'd him on    This is another Instance of what has been in general observ'd in the Discourse on the Battels of  Homer  his artful manner of making us measure one Hero by another We have here an exact Scale of the Valor of  Aeneas  and of  Menelaus  how much the former outweighs the latter appears by what is said of  Mars  in these Lines and by the Necessity of  Antilochus  's assisting  Menelaus  as afterwards what Overbalance that Assistance gave him by  Aeneas  's retreating from them both How very nicely are these Degrees mark'd on either Hand This Knowledge of the Difference which Nature itself sets between one Man and another makes our Author neither blame these two Heroes for going against one who was superior to each of them in Strength nor that one for retiring from both when their Conjunction made them an Overmatch to him There is great Judgment in all this  LII  VERSE  And all his Country's glorious Labours vain    For as  Agamemnon  said in the fourth Book upon  Menelaus  's being wounded if he were slain the War would be at an end and the  Greeks  think only of returning to their Country  Spondanus  LIII  VERSE Mars  stern Destroyer  c  There is a great Nobleness in this Passage With what Pomp is  Hector  introduced into the Battel where  Mars  and  Bellona  are his Attendants The Retreat of  Diomed  is no less beautiful  Minerva  had remov'd the Mist from his Eyes and he immediately discovers  Mars  assisting  Hector  His Surprize on this Occasion is finely imag'd by that of the Traveller on the sudden Sight of the River  LIV  VERSE  What brings this  Lycian  Counsellor so far    There is a particular Sarcasm in  Tlepolemus  's calling  Sarpedon  in this Place    Lycian Counsellor  one better skill'd in Oratory than War as he was the Governor of a People who had long been in Peace and probably if we may guess from his Character in  Homer  remarkable for his Speeches This is rightly observed by  Spondanus  tho' not taken notice of by M  Dacier  LV  VERSE Troy  felt his Arm    He alludes to the History of the first Destruction of  Troy  by  Hercules  occasion'd by  Laomedon  's refusing that Hero the Horses which were the Reward promis'd him for the Delivery of his Daughter  Hesione  LVI  VERSE  With base Reproaches and unmanly Pride    Methinks these Words  include the chief Sting of  Sarpedon  's Answer to  Tlepolemus  which no Commentator that I remember has remark'd He tells him  Laomedon  deserv'd his Misfortune not only for his Perfidy but for injuring a brave Man with unmanly and scandalous  Reproaches  alluding to those which  Tlepolemus  had just before cast upon him  LVII  VERSE  Nor  Hector  to the Chief replies    Homer  is in nothing more admirable than in the excellent Use he makes of the  Silence  of the Persons he introduces It would be endless to collect all the Instances of this Truth throughout his Poem yet I cannot but put together those that have already occurr'd in the Course of this Work and leave to the Reader the Pleasure of observing it in what remains The Silence of  the two Heralds when they were to take  Briseis  from  Achilles  in  Lib  of which see  Note  In the third Book when  Iris  tells  Helen  the two Rivals were to fight in her Quarrel and that all  Troy  were standing Spectators that guilty Princess makes no Answer but casts a Veil over her Face and drops a Tear and when she comes just after into the Presence of  Priam  she speaks not till after he has in a particular manner encourag'd and commanded her  Paris  and  Menelaus  being just upon the Point to encounter the latter declares his Wishes and Hopes of Conquest to Heaven the former being engag'd in an unjust Cause says not a word In the fourth Book when  Jupiter  has express'd his Desire to favour  Troy Juno  declaims against him but the  Goddess of Wisdom  tho' much concern'd holds her Peace When  Agamemnon  too rashly reproves  Diomed  that Hero remains silent and in the true Character of a rough Warrior leaves it to his Actions to speak for him In the present Book when  Sarpedon  has reproach'd  Hector  in an open and generous manner  Hector  preserving the same warlike Character returns no Answer but immediately hastens to the Business of the Field as he also does in this Place where he instantly brings off  Sarpedon  without so much as telling him he will endeavour his Rescue  Chapman  was not sensible of the Beauty of this when he imagined  Hector  's Silence here proceeded from the Pique he had conceiv'd at  Sarpedon  for his late Reproof of him That Translator has not scrupled to insert this Opinion of his in a groundless Interpolation altogether foreign to the Author But indeed it is a Liberty he frequently takes to draw any Passage to some new farfetch'd Conceit of his Invention insomuch that very often before he translates any Speech to the Sense or Design of which he gives some fanciful Turn of his own he prepares it by several additional Lines purposely to prepossess the Reader of that Meaning Those who will take the Trouble may see Examples of this in what he sets before the Speeches of  Hector Paris  and  Helena  in the sixth Book and innumerable other Places  LVIII  VERSE  But  Boreas  rising fresh    Sarpedon  's fainting at the Extraction of the Dart and reviving by the free Air shews the great Judgment of our Author in these Matters But how Poetically has he told this Truth in raising the God  Boreas  to his Hero's Assistance and making a little Machine of but one Line This manner of representing common Things in Figure and Person was perhaps the Effect of  Homer  's  Aegyptian  Education  LIX  VERSE  The gen'rous  Greeks c  This slow and orderly Retreat of the  Greeks  with their Front constantly turn'd to the Enemy is a fine Encomium both of their Courage and Discipline This manner of Retreat was in use among the ancient  Lacedaemonians  as were many other martial Customs describ'd by  Homer  This Practice took its Rise among that brave People from the Apprehensions of being slain with a Wound receiv'd in their Back Such a Misfortune was not only attended with the highest Infamy but they had found a way to punish them who suffer'd thus even after their Death by denying them as  Eustathius  informs us the Rites of Burial  LX  VERSE  Who first who last by  Mars  and  Hector  's Hand  Stretch'd in their Blood lay gasping on the Sand    This manner of breaking out into an Interrogation amidst the Description of a Battel is what serves very much to awaken the Reader It is here an Invocation to the Muse that prepares us for something uncommon and the Muse is suppos'd immediately to answer Teuthras  the great  c  Virgil  I think has improved the Strength of this Figure by addressing the Apostrophe to the Person whose Exploits he is celebrating as to  Camilla  in the eleventh Book  Quem telo primum quem postremum aspera virgo  Dejicis aut quot humi morientia corpora fundis  LXI  VERSE  And now Heav'ns Empress calls her blazing Car  c  Homer  seems never more delighted than when he has some Occasion of displaying his Skill in Mechanicks The Detail he gives us of this Chariot is a beautiful Example of it where he takes occasion to describe every different Part with a Happiness rarely to be found in Descriptions of this Nature  LXII  VERSE Pallas  disrobes    This Fiction of  Pallas  arraying herself with the Arms of  Jupiter  finely intimates says  Eustathius  that she is nothing else but the Wisdom of the Almighty The same Author tells us that the Ancients mark'd this Place with a Star to distinguish it as one of those that were perfectly admirable Indeed there is a Greatness and Sublimity in the whole Passage which is astonishing and superior to any Imagination but that of  Homer  nor is there any that might better give occasion for that celebrated Saying That  he was the only Man who had seen the Forms of the Gods or the only Man who had shewn them  With what Nobleness he describes the Chariot of  Juno  the Armor of  Minerva  the  Aegis  of  Jupiter  fill'd with the Figures of  Horror Affright Discord  and all the Terrors of War the Effects of his Wrath against Men and that Spear with which his Power and Wisdom overturns whole Armies and humbles the Pride of the Kings who offend him But we shall not wonder at the unusual Majesty of all these Ideas if we consider that they have a near Resemblance to some Descriptions of the same Kind in the sacred Writings where the Almighty is represented arm'd with Terror and descending in Majesty to be aveng'd on his Enemies The  Chariot  the  Bow  and the  Shield of God  are Expressions frequent in the  Psalms  LXIII  VERSE  A Fringe of Serpents    Our Author does not particularly describe this Fringe of the  Aegis  as consisting of Serpents but that it did so may be learn'd from  Herodotus  in his fourth Book  "The  Greeks  says he borrowed the Vest and Shield of  Minerva  from the  Lybians  only with this Difference that the  Lybian  Shield was fringed with Thongs of Leather the  Grecian  with Serpents"  And  Virgil  's Description of the same  Aegis  agrees with this  Aen  ‚Ñ£  Aegidaque horriferam turbatae Palladis arma  Certatim squamis serpentum auroque polibant  Connexosque angues  This Note is taken from  Spondanus  as is also  Ogilby  's on this Place but he has translated the Passage of  Herodotus  wrong and made the  Lybian  Shield have the Serpents which were peculiar to the  Grecian  By the way I must observe that  Ogilby  's Notes are for the most part a Transcription of  Spondanus  's  LXIV  VERSE  So vast the wide Circumference contains A hundred Armies    The Words in the Original are  which are capable of two Meanings either that this Helmet of  Jupiter  was sufficient to have covered the Armies of an hundred Cities or that the Armies of an hundred Cities were engraved upon it It is here translated in such a manner that it may be taken either way tho' the Learned are most inclined to the former Sense as that Idea is greater and more extraordinary indeed more agreeable to  Homer  's bold manner and not extravagant if we call in the Allegory to our Assistance and imagine it with M  Dacier  an Allusion to the Providence of God that extends over all the Universe  LXV  VERSE  Heav'n Gates spontaneous open'd    This marvellous Circumstance of the Gates of Heaven opening themselves of their own accord to the Divinities that past thro' them is copied by  Milton Lib    At the Gate  Of Heav'n arriv'd the Gate selfopen'd wide  On golden Hinges turning as by Work  Divine the Sov'reign Architect had fram'd  And again in the seventh Book  Heav'n open'd wide  Her everduring Gates Harmonious Sound  On golden Hinges moving  As the Fiction that the Hours are the Guards of those Gates gave him the Hint of that beautiful Passage in the beginning of his sixth  The Morn  Wak'd by the circling Hours with rosie Hand  Unbarr'd the Gates of Light  c  This Expression of  the Gates of Heaven  is in the  Eastern  manner where they said the  Gates  of Heaven or of Earth for the  Entrance  or  Extremities  of Heaven or Earth a Phrase usual in the Scriptures as is observ'd by  Dacier  LXVI  VERSE  Heav'ns golden Gates kept by the winged Hours    By the  Hours  here are meant the  Seasons  and so  Hobbes  translates it but spoils the Sense by what he adds  Tho' to the Seasons  Jove  the Power gave  Alone to judge of early and of late  Which is utterly unintelligible and nothing like  Homer  's Thought  Natalis Comes  explains it thus  Lib    c    Homerus libro quinto Iliadis non solum has Portas coeli servare sed etiam nubes inducere serenum facere cum libuerit quippe cum apertum coelum serenum nominent Poetae at clausum tectum nubibus  LXVII  VERSE  To tame the MonsterGod  Minerva  knows    For it is only  Wisdom  that can master  Strength  It is worth while here to observe the Conduct of  Homer  He makes  Minerva  and not  Juno  to fight with  Mars  because a Combate between  Mars  and  Juno  could not be supported by any Allegory to have authorized the Fable whereas the Allegory of a Battel between  Mars  and  Minerva  is very open and intelligible  Eustathius  LXVIII  VERSE  Far as a Shepherd  c  Longinus  citing these Verses as a noble Instance of the Sublime speaks to this Effect  "In what a wonderful manner does  Homer  exalt his Deities measuring the Leaps of their very Horses by the whole Breadth of the Horizon Who is there that considering the Magnificence of this Hyperbole would not cry out with Reason that if these heavenly Steeds were to make a second Leap the World would want room for a third"  This puts me in mind of that Passage in  Hesiod  's  Theogony  where he describes the Height of the Heavens by saying a Smith's Anvil would be nine Days in falling from thence to Earth  LXIX  VERSE  Smooth as the gliding Doves    This Simile is intended to express the Lightness and Smoothness of the Motion of these Goddesses The Doves to which  Homer  compares them are said by the ancient Scholiast to leave no  Impression of their Steps The Word  in the Original may be render'd  ascenderunt  as well as  incesserunt  so may imply as M  Dacier  translates it moving without touching the Earth which  Milton  finely calls  smoothgliding without Step Virgil  describes the gliding of one of these Birds by an Image parallel to that in this Verse  Mox aere lapsa quieto  Radit iter liquidum celeres neque commovet alas  This kind of Movement was appropriated to the Gods by the  Egyptians  as we see in  Heliodorus Lib    Homer  might possibly have taken this Notion from them And  Virgil  in that Passage where  Aeneas  discovers  Venus  by her Gate  Et vera incessu patuit Dea  seems to allude to some manner of moving that distinguish'd Divinities from Mortals This Opinion is likewise hinted at by him in the fifth  Aeneid  where he so beautifully and briefly enumerates the distinguishing Marks of a Deity  Divini signa decoris  Ardentesque notate oculos qui spiritus illi  Qui vultus vocisque sonus vel gressus eunti  This Passage likewise strengthens what is said in the thirtieth Note on the first Book  LXX  VERSE Stentor  the strong endu'd with Brazen Lungs    There was a Necessity for Cryers whose Voices were stronger than ordinary in those ancient Times before the Use of Trumpets was known in their Armies And that they were in Esteem afterwards may be seen from  Herodotus  where he takes notice that  Darius  had in his Train an  Egyptian  whose Voice was louder and stronger than any Man's of his Age There is a farther Propriety in  Homer  's attributing this Voice to  Juno  because  Juno  is no other than the  Air  and because the  Air  is the Cause of  Sound Eustathius Spondanus  LXXI  VERSE  Degen'rate Prince  c  This Speech of  Minerva  to  Diomed  derives its whole Force and Efficacy from the offensive Comparison she makes between  Tydeus  and his Son  Tydeus  when he was single in the City of his Enemy fought and overcame the  Thebans  even tho'  Minerva  forbade him  Diomed  in the midst of his Army and with Enemies inferior in Number declines the Fight tho'  Minerva  commands him  Tydeus  disobeys her to engage in the Battel  Diomed  disobeys her to avoid engaging and that too after he had upon many Occasions experienced the Assistance of the Goddess Madam  Dacier  should have acknowledged this Remark to belong to  Eustathius  LXXII  VERSE  Rash furious blind from these to those he flies    Minerva  in this Place very well paints the Manners of  Mars  whose Business was always to fortify the weaker side in order to keep up the Broil I think the Passage includes a fine Allegory of the Nature of  War Mars  is called  inconstant  and a  Breaker of his Promises  because the Chance of War is wavering and uncertain Victory is perpetually changing sides This latent Meaning of the Epithet  is taken notice of by  Eustathius  LXXIII  VERSE  So great a God    The Translation has ventured to call a Goddess so in Imitation of the  Greek  which uses the word  promiscuously for either Gender Some of the  Latin  Poets have not scrupled to do the same  Statius Thebaid  speaking of  Diana    Nec caret umbra  Deo  And  Virgil Aeneid  where  Aeneas  is conducted by  Venus  thro' the Dangers of the Fire and the Enemy  Descendo ac ducente  Deo  flammam inter hostes  Expedior  LXXIV  VERSE  Black  Orcus'  Helmet    As every thing that goes into the dark Empire of  Pluto  or  Orcus  disappears and is seen no more the  Greeks  from thence borrow'd this figurative Expression  to put on  Pluto  's Helmet  that is to say  to become invisible Plato  uses this Proverb in the tenth Book of his  Republick  and  Aristophanes  in  Acharnens Eustathius  LXXV  VERSE  Loud as the Roar encountring Armies yield    This  Hyperbole  to express the roaring of  Mars  so strong as it is yet is not extravagant It wants not a qualifying Circumstance or two the Voice is not Human but that of a Deity and the Comparison being taken from an Army renders it more natural with respect to the God of War It is less daring to say that a God could send forth a Voice as loud as the Shout of two Armies than that  Camilla  a  Latian  Nymph could run so swiftly over the Corn as not to bend an Ear of it Or to alledge a nearer Instance that  Polyphemus  a meer Mortal shook all the Island of  Sicily  and made the deepest Caverns of  Aetna  roar with his Cries Yet  Virgil  generally escapes the Censure of those Moderns who are shock'd with the bold Flights of  Homer  It is usual with those who are Slaves to common Opinion to overlook or praise the same Things in one that they blame in another They think to depreciate  Homer  in extolling the Judgment of  Virgil  who never shew'd it more than when he followed him in these Boldnesses And indeed they who would take Boldness from Poetry must leave Dulness in the room of it  LXXVI  VERSE  As Vapors blown  c  Mars  after a sharp  Engagement amidst the Rout of the  Trojans  wrapt in a Whirlwind of Dust which was rais'd by so many thousand Combatants flies toward  Olympus Homer  compares him in this Estate to those black Clouds which during a scorching Southern Wind in the Dogdays are sometimes born towards Heaven for the Wind at that time gathering the Dust together forms a dark Cloud of it The Heat of the Fight the Precipitation of the  Trojans  together with the Clouds of Dust that flew above the Army and took  Mars  from the Sight of his Enemy supply'd  Homer  with this noble Image  Dacier  LXXVII  VERSE  Thou gav'st that Fury to the Realms of Light Pernicious wild  c  It is very artful in  Homer  to make  Mars  accuse  Minerva  of all those Faults and Enormities he was himself so eminently guilty of Those People who are the most unjust and violent accuse others even the best of the same Crimes Every irrational Man is a distorted Rule tries every thing by that wrong Measure and forms his Judgment accordingly  Eustathius  LXXVIII  VERSE  Condemn'd to Pain tho' fated not to die    Those are mistaken who imagine our Author represents his Gods as mortal He only represents the inferior or corporeal Deities as capable of Pains and Punishments during the Will of  Jupiter  which is not inconsistent with true Theology If  Mars  is said in  Dione  's Speech to  Venus  to have been near  perishing  by  Otus  and  Ephialtes  it means no more than lasting Misery such as  Jupiter  threatens him with when he speaks of precipitating him into  Tartarus Homer  takes care to tell us both of this God and of  Pluto  when  Paeon  cured them that they were not mortal  LXXIX  VERSE  Of all the GodsThou most unjust most odious  c  Jupiter  's Reprimand of  Mars  is worthy the Justice and Goodness of the great Governor of the World and seems to be no more than was necessary in this Place  Homer  hereby admirably distinguishes between  Minerva  and  Mars  that is to say between  Wisdom  and ungovern'd  Fury  the former is produced from  Jupiter  without a Mother to show that it proceeds from God alone and  Homer  's alluding to that Fable in the preceding Speech shows that he was not unacquainted with this Opinion The latter is born of  Jupiter  and  Juno  because as  Plato  explains it whatever is created by the Ministry of second Causes and the Concurrence of Matter partakes of that Original Spirit of Division which reigned in the  Chaos  and is of a corrupt and rebellious Nature The Reader will find this Allegory pursued with great Beauty in these two Speeches especially where  Jupiter  concludes with saying he will not destroy  Mars  because he comes from himself God will not annihilate  Passion  which he created to be of use to Reason  "Wisdom says  Eustathius  upon this Place has occasion for Passion in the same manner as Princes have need of Guards Therefore Reason and Wisdom correct and keep Passion in Subjection but do not entirely destroy and ruin it  LXXX  VERSE  And all thy Mother in thy Soul rebels  c  Jupiter  says of  Juno  that  she has a Temper which is insupportable and knows not how to submit tho' he is perpetually chastising her with his Reproofs Homer  says no more than this but M  Dacier  adds  Si je ne la retenois par la severit√® des mes loix il n'est rien qu'elle ne bouleversast dans l'Olympe sous l'Olympe  Upon which she makes a Remark to this effect  "that if it were not for the Laws of Providence the whole World would be nothing but Confusion"  This Practice of refining and adding to  Homer  's Thought in the  Text and then applauding the Author for it in the Notes is pretty usual with the more florid modern Translators In the third Iliad in  Helen  's Speech to  Priam  ‚Ñ£ she wishes she had rather dy'd than follow'd  Paris  to  Troy  To this is added in the  French Mais je n'eus ni assez de Courage ni assez de vertu  for which there is not the least Hint in  Homer  I mention this particular Instance in pure Justice because in the Treatise  de la Corruption du Gout Exam de Liv  She triumphs over M  de la Motte  as if he had omitted the Sense and Moral of  Homer  in that Place when in Truth he only left out her own Interpolation  LXXXI  VERSE  As when the Fig's prest Juice  c  The sudden Operation of the Remedy administer'd by  Paeon  is well express'd by this Similitude It is necessary just to take notice that they anciently made use of the Juice or Sap of a green Fig for Runnet to cause their Milk to coagulate It may not be amiss to observe that  Homer  is not very delicate in the Choice of his Allusions He often borrowed his Similes from low Life and provided they illustrated his Thoughts in a just and lively manner it was all he had regard to  THE Allegory of this whole Book lies so open is carry'd on with such Closeness and wound up with so much Fulness and Strength that it is a wonder how it could enter into the Imagination of any Critick that these Actions of  Diomed  were only a daring and extravagant Fiction in  Homer  as if he affected the  Marvellous  at any rate The great Moral of it is that a brave Man should not contend against Heaven but resist only  Venus  and  Mars  Incontinence and ungovern'd Fury  Diomed  is propos'd as an Example of a great and enterprizing Nature which would perpetually be venturing too far and committing Extravagancies or Impieties did it not suffer itself to be check'd and guided by  Minerva  or Prudence For it is this  Wisdom  as we are told in the very first Lines of the Book that raises a Hero above all others Nothing is more observable than the particular Care  Homer  has taken to shew  he designed this Moral He never omits any Occasion throughout the Book to put it in express Terms into the Mouths of the Gods or Persons of the greatest Weight  Minerva  at the beginning of the Battel is made to give this Precept to  Diomed Fight not against the Gods but give way to them and resist only  Venus The same Goddess opens his Eyes and enlightens him so far as to perceive when it is Heaven that acts immediately against him or when it is Man only that opposes him The Hero himself as soon as he has perform'd her Dictates in driving away  Venus  cries out not as to the  Goddess  but as to the  Passion Thou hast no Business with Warriors is it not enough that thou deceiv'st weak Women  Even the Mother of  Venus  while she comforts her Daughter bears Testimony to the Moral  That Man  says she  is not longliv'd who contends with the Gods  And when  Diomed  transported by his Nature proceeds but a Step too far  Apollo  discovers himself in the most solemn manner and declares this Truth in his own Voice as it were by direct Revelation  Mortal forbear consider and know the vast difference there is between the Gods and Thee They are immortal and divine but Man a miserable Reptile of the Dust  THE SIXTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Episodes of  Glaucus  and  Diomed  and of  Hector  and  Andromache  THE Gods having left the Field the  Grecians  prevail  Helenus  the chief Augur of  Troy  commands  Hector  to return to the City in order to appoint a solemn Procession of the Queen and the  Trojan  Matrons to the Temple of  Minerva  to entreat her to remove  Diomed  from the Fight The Battel relaxing during the Absence of  Hector Glaucus  and  Diomed  have an Interview between the two Armies where coming to the Knowledge of the Friendship and Hospitality past between their Ancestors they make exchange of their Arms  Hector  having performed the Orders of  Helenus  prevail'd upon  Paris  to return to the Battel and taken a tender Leave of his Wife  Andromache  hastens again to the Field  The  Scene  is first in the Field of Battel between the Rivers  Simois  and  Scamander  and then changes to  Troy  THE SIXTH BOOK OF

Train  And rev'rend Elders seek the Gods in vain  This said with ample Strides the Hero past  The Shield's large Orb behind his Shoulder cast  His Neck o'ershading to his Ancle hung  And as he march'd the brazen Buckler rung  Now paus'd the Battel Godlike  Hector  gone  When daring  Glaucus  and great  Tydeus'  Son  Between both Armies met The Chiefs from far  Observ'd each other and had mark'd for War  Near as they drew  Tydides  thus began  What art thou boldest of the Race of Man  Our Eyes till now that Aspect ne'er beheld  Where Fame is reap'd amid th' embattel'd Field  Yet far before the Troops thou dar'st appear  And meet a Lance the fiercest Heroes fear  Unhappy they and born of luckless Sires  Who tempt our Fury when  Minerva  fires  But if from Heav'n Celestial thou descend  Know with Immortals we no more contend  Not long  Lycurgus  view'd the Golden Light  That daring Man who mix'd with Gods in Fight  Bacchus  and  Bacchus'  Votaries he drove  With brandish'd Steel from  Nyssa  's sacred Grove  Their consecrated Spears lay scatter'd round  With curling Vines and twisted Ivy bound  While  Bacchus  headlong sought the briny Flood  And  Thetis'  Arms receiv'd the trembling God  Nor fail'd the Crime th' Immortals Wrath to move  Th' Immortals blest with endless Ease above  Depriv'd of Sight by their avenging Doom  Chearless he breath'd and wander'd in the Gloom  Then sunk unpity'd to the dire Abodes  A Wretch accurst and hated by the Gods  I brave not Heav'n But if the Fruits of Earth  Sustain thy Life and Human be thy Birth  Bold as thou art too prodigal of Breath  Approach and enter the dark Gates of Death  What or from whence I am or who my Sire  Reply'd the Chief can  Tydeus'  Son enquire  Like Leaves on Trees the Race of Man is found  Now green in Youth now with'ring on the Ground  Another Race the following Spring supplies  They fall successive and successive rise  So Generations in their Course decay  So flourish these when those are past away  But if thou still persist to search my Birth  Then hear a Tale that fills the spacious Earth  A City stands on  Argos'  utmost Bound    Argos  the fair for warlike Steeds renown'd  Aeolian Sysiphus  with Wisdom blest  In ancient Time the happy Walls possest  Then call'd  Ephyre Glaucus  was his Son  Great  Glaucus  Father of  Bellerophon  Who o'er the Sons of Men in Beauty shin'd  Lov'd for that Valour which preserves Mankind  Then mighty  Praetus Argos'  Sceptres sway'd  Whose hard Commands  Bellerophon  obey'd  With direful Jealousy the Monarch rag'd  And the brave Prince in num'rous Toils engag'd  For him  Antaea  burn'd with lawless Flame  And strove to tempt him from the Paths of Fame  In vain she tempted the relentless Youth  Endu'd with Wisdom sacred Fear and Truth  Fir'd at his Scorn the Queen to  Praetus  fled  And beg'd Revenge for her insulted Bed  Incens'd he heard resolving on his Fate  But Hospitable Laws restrain'd his Hate  To  Lycia  the devoted Youth he sent  With Tablets seal'd that told his dire Intent  Now blest by ev'ry Pow'r who guards the Good  The Chief arriv'd at  Xanthus'  silver Flood  There  Lycia  's Monarch paid him Honours due  Nine Days he feasted and nine Bulls he slew  But when the tenth bright Morning Orient glow'd  The faithful Youth his Monarch's Mandate show'd  The fatal Tablets till that Instant seal'd  The deathful Secret to the King reveal'd  First dire  Chymaera  's Conquest was enjoin'd  A mingled Monster of no mortal Kind  Behind a Dragon's fiery Tail was spread  A Goat's rough Body bore a Lion's Head  Her pitchy Nostrils flaky Flames expire  Her gaping Throat emits infernal Fire  This Pest he slaughter'd for he read the Skies  And trusted Heav'ns informing Prodigies  Then met in Arms the  Solymaean  Crew  Fiercest of Men and those the Warrior slew  Next the bold  Amazon  's whole Force defy'd  And conquer'd still for Heav'n was on his side  Nor ended here his Toils His  Lycian  Foes  At his Return a treach'rous Ambush rose  With levell'd Spears along the winding Shore  There fell they breathless and return'd no more  At length the Monarch with repentant Grief  Confess'd the Gods and Goddescended Chief  His Daughter gave the Stranger to detain  With half the Honours of his ample Reign  The  Lycians  grant a chosen Space of Ground  With Woods with Vineyards and with Harvests crown'd  There long the Chief his happy Lot possess'd  With two brave Sons and one fair Daughter bless'd  Fair ev'n in heav'nly Eyes her fruitful Love  Crown'd with  Sarpedon  's Birth th' Embrace of  Jove    But when at last distracted in his Mind  Forsook by Heav'n forsaking Humankind  Wide o'er th'  Aleian  Field he chose to stray  A long forlorn uncomfortable Way  Woes heap'd on Woes oppress'd his wasted Heart  His beauteous Daughter fell by  Phoeb√®  's Dart  His Eldestborn by raging  Mars  was slain  In Combate on the  Solymaean  Plain  Hippolochus  surviv'd from him I came  The honour'd Author of my Birth and Name  By his Decree I sought the  Trojan  Town  By his Instructions learn to win Renown  To stand the first in Worth as in Command  To add new Honours to my native Land  Before my Eyes my mighty Sires to place  And emulate the Glories of our Race  He spoke and Transport fill'd  Tydides'  Heart  In Earth the gen'rous Warrior fix'd his Dart  Then friendly thus the  Lycian  Prince addrest  Welcome my brave Hereditary Guest  Thus ever let us meet with kind Embrace  Nor stain the sacred Friendship of our Race  Know Chief our Grandsires have been Guests of old  Oeneus  the strong  Bellerophon  the bold  Our ancient Seat his honour'd Presence grac'd  Where twenty Days in Genial Rites he pass'd  The parting Heroes mutual Presents left  A golden Goblet was thy Grandsire's Gift  Oeneus  a Belt of matchless Work bestow'd  That rich with  Tyrian  Dye refulgent glow'd  This from his Pledge I learn'd which safely stor'd  Among my Treasures still adorns my Board  For  Tydeus  left me young when  Theb√®  's Wall  Beheld the Sons of  Greece  untimely fall  Mindful of this in Friendship let us join  If Heav'n our Steps to foreign Lands incline  My Guest in  Argos  thou and I in  Lycia  thine  Enough of  Trojans  to this Lance shall yield  In the full Harvest of yon' ample Field  Enough of  Greeks  shall die thy Spear with Gore  But Thou and  Diomed  be Foes no more  Now change we Arms and prove to either Host  We guard the Friendship of the Line we boast  Thus having said the gallant Chiefs alight  Their Hands they join their mutual Faith they plight  Brave  Glaucus  then each narrow Thought resign'd    Jove  warm'd his Bosom and enlarg'd his Mind  For  Diomed  's Brass Arms of mean Device  For which nine Oxen paid a vulgar Price  He gave his own of Gold divinely wrought  A hundred Beeves the shining Purchase bought  Meantime the Guardian of the  Trojan  State  Great  Hector  enter'd at the  Scaean  Gate  Beneath the BeechTree's consecrated Shades  The  Trojan  Matrons and the  Trojan  Maids  Around him flock'd all press'd with pious Care  For Husbands Brothers Sons engag'd in War  He bids the Train in long Procession go  And seek the Gods t' avert th' impending Woe  And now to  Priam  's stately Courts he came  Rais'd on arch'd Columns of stupendous Frame  O'er these a Range of Marble Structure runs  The rich Pavillions of his fifty Sons  In fifty Chambers lodg'd and Rooms of State  Oppos'd to those where  Priam  's Daughters sate  Twelve Domes for them and their lov'd Spouses shone  Of equal Beauty and of polish'd Stone  Hither great  Hector  pass'd nor pass'd unseen  Of Royal  Hecuba  his Mother Queen  With her  Laodic√®  whose beauteous Face  Surpass'd the Nymphs of  Troy  's illustrious Race  Long in a strict Embrace she held her Son  And press'd his Hand and tender thus begun  O  Hector  say what great Occasion calls  My Son from Fight when  Greece  surrounds our Walls  Com'st thou to supplicate th' Almighty Pow'r  With lifted Hands from  Ilion  's lofty Tow'r  Stay till I bring the Cup with  Bacchus  crown'd  In  Jove  's high Name to sprinkle on the Ground  And pay due Vows to all the Gods around  Then with a plenteous Draught refresh thy Soul  And draw new Spirits from the gen'rous Bowl  Spent as thou art with long laborious Fight  The brave Defender of thy Country's Right  Far hence be  Bacchus'  Gifts the Chief rejoin'd  Inflaming Wine pernicious to Mankind  Unnerves the Limbs and dulls the noble Mind  Let Chiefs abstain and spare the sacred Juice  To sprinkle to the Gods its better Use  By me that holy Office were prophan'd  Ill fits it me with human Gore distain'd  To the pure Skies these horrid Hands to raise  Or offer Heav'n's great Sire polluted Praise  You with your Matrons go a spotless Train  And burn rich Odors in  Minerva  's Fane  The largest Mantle your full Wardrobes hold  Most priz'd for Art and labour'd o'er with Gold  Before the Goddess' honour'd Knees be spread  And twelve young Heifers to her Altar led  So may the Pow'r atton'd by fervent Pray'r  Our Wives our Infants and our City spare  And far avert  Tydides'  wastful Ire  Who mows whole Troops and makes all  Troy  retire  Be this O Mother your religious Care  I go to rowze soft  Paris  to the War  If yet not lost to all the Sense of Shame  The recreant Warrior hear the Voice of Fame  Oh would kind Earth the hateful Wretch embrace  That Pest of  Troy  that Ruin of our Race  Deep to the dark Abyss might he descend  Troy  yet should flourish and my Sorrows end  This heard she gave Command and summon'd came  Each noble Matron and illustrious Dame  The  Phrygian  Queen to her rich Wardrobe went  Where treasur'd Odors breath'd a costly Scent  There lay the Vestures of no vulgar Art  Sidonian  Maids embroider'd ev'ry Part  Whom from soft  Sidon  youthful  Paris  bore  With  Helen  touching on the  Tyrian  Shore  Here as the Queen revolv'd with careful Eyes  The various Textures and the various Dies  She chose a Veil that shone superior far  And glow'd refulgent as the Morning Star  Herself with this the long Procession leads  The Train majestically slow proceeds  Soon as to  Ilion  's topmost Tow'r they come  And awful reach the high  Palladian  Dome  Antenor  's Consort fair  Theano  waits  As  Pallas'  Priestess and unbars the Gates  With Hands uplifted and imploring Eyes  They fill the Dome with supplicating Cries  The Priestess then the shining Veil displays  Plac'd on  Minerva  's Knees and thus she prays  Oh awful Goddess everdreadful Maid  Troy  's strong Defence unconquer'd  Pallas  aid  Break thou  Tydides'  Spear and let him fall  Prone on the Dust before the  Trojan  Wall  So twelve young Heifers guiltless of the Yoke  Shall fill thy Temple with a grateful Smoke  But thou atton'd by Penitence and Pray'r  Our selves our Infants and our City spare  So pray'd the Priestess in her holy Fane  So vow'd the Matrons but they vow'd in vain  While these appear before the Pow'r with Pray'rs  Hector  to  Paris'  lofty Dome repairs  Himself the Mansion rais'd from ev'ry Part  Assembling Architects of matchless Art  Near  Priam  's Court and  Hector  's Palace stands  The pompous Structure and the Town commands  A Spear the Hero bore of wondrous Strength  Of full ten Cubits was the Lance's Length  The steely Point with golden Ringlets join'd  Before him brandish'd at each Motion shin'd  Thus entring in the glitt'ring Rooms he found  His BrotherChief whose useless Arms lay round  His Eyes delighting with their splendid Show  Bright'ning the Shield and polishing the Bow  Beside him  Helen  with her Virgins stands  Guides their rich Labours and instructs their Hands  Him thus unactive with an ardent Look  The Prince beheld and highresenting spoke  Thy Hate to  Troy  is this the Time to show  Oh Wretch illfated and thy Country's Foe  Paris  and  Greece  against us both conspire  Thy close Resentment and their vengeful Ire  For thee great  Ilion  's Guardian Heroes fall  Till Heaps of Dead alone defend her Wall  For thee the Soldier bleeds the Matron mourns  And wastful War in all its Fury burns  Ungrateful Man deserves not this thy Care  Our Troops to hearten and our Toils to share  Rise or behold the conqu'ring Flames ascend  And all the  Phrygian  Glories at an end  Brother 'tis just reply'd the beauteous Youth  Thy free Remonstrance proves thy Worth and Truth  Yet charge my Absence less oh gen'rous Chief  On Hate to  Troy  than conscious Shame and Grief  Here hid from human Eyes thy Brother sate  And mourn'd in secret his and  Ilion  's Fate  'Tis now enough now Glory spreads her Charms  And beauteous  Helen  calls her Chief to Arms  Conquest to Day my happier Sword may bless  'Tis Man's to fight but Heav'ns to give Success  But while I arm contain thy ardent Mind  Or go and  Paris  shall not lag behind  He said nor answer'd  Priam  's warlike Son  When  Helen  thus with lowly Grace begun  Oh gen'rous Brother if the guilty Dame  That caus'd these Woes deserve a Sister's Name  Would Heav'n e're all these dreadful Deeds were done  The Day that show'd me to the golden Sun  Had seen my Death Why did not Whirlwinds bear  The fatal Infant to the Fowls of Air  Why sunk I not beneath the whelming Tyde  And 'midst the Roarings of the Waters dy'd  Heav'n fill'd up all my Ills and I accurst  Bore all and  Paris  of those Ills the worst  Helen  at least a braver Spouse might claim  Warm'd with some Virtue some Regard of Fame  Now tir'd with Toils thy fainting Limbs recline  With Toils sustain'd for  Paris'  sake and mine  The Gods have link'd our miserable Doom  Our present Woe and Infamy to come  Wide shall it spread and last thro' Ages long  Example sad and Theme of future Song  The Chief reply'd This Time forbids to rest  The  Trojan  Bands by hostile Fury prest  Demand their  Hector  and his Arm require  The Combate urges and my Soul's on fire  Urge thou thy Knight to march where Glory calls  And timely join me e're I leave the Walls  E're yet I mingle in the direful Fray  My Wife my Infant claim a Moment's Stay  This Day perhaps the last that sees me here  Demands a parting Word a tender Tear  This Day some God who hates our  Trojan  Land  May vanquish  Hector  by a  Grecian  Hand  He said and past with sad presaging Heart  To seek his Spouse his Soul's far dearer Part  At home he sought her but he sought in vain  She with one Maid of all her Menial Train  Had thence retir'd and with her second Joy  The young  Astyanax  the Hope of  Troy  Pensive she stood on  Ilion  's Tow'ry Height  Beheld the War and sicken'd at the Sight  There her sad Eyes in vain her Lord explore  Or weep the Wounds her bleeding Country bore  But he who found not whom his Soul desir'd  Whose Virtue charm'd him as her Beauty fir'd  Stood in the Gates and ask'd what way she bent  Her parting Step If to the Fane she went  Where late the mourning Matrons made Resort  Or sought her Sisters in the  Trojan  Court  Not to the Court reply'd th' Attendant Train  Nor mix'd with Matrons to  Minerva  's Fane  To  Ilion  's steepy Tow'r she bent her way  To mark the Fortunes of the doubtful Day  Troy  fled she heard before the  Grecian  Sword  She heard and trembled for her absent Lord  Distracted with Surprize she seem'd to fly  Fear on her Cheek and Sorrow in her Eye  The Nurse attended with her Infant Boy  The young  Astyanax  the Hope of  Troy  Hector  this heard return'd without Delay  Swift thro' the Town he trod his former way  Thro' Streets of Palaces and Walks of State  And met the Mourner at the  Scaean  Gate  With haste to meet him sprung the joyful Fair  His blameless Wife  A√´tion  's wealthy Heir    Cilician Theb√®  great  A√´tion  sway'd  And  Hippoplacus'  wideextended Shade  The Nurse stood near in whose Embraces prest  His only Hope hung smiling at her Breast  Whom each soft Charm and early Grace adorn  Fair as the newborn Star that gilds the Morn  To this lov'd Infant  Hector  gave the Name  Scamandrius  from  Scamander  's honour'd Stream  Astyanax  the  Trojans  call'd the Boy  From his great Father the Defence of  Troy  Silent the Warrior smil'd and pleas'd resign'd  To tender Passions all his mighty Mind  His beauteous Princess cast a mournful Look  Hung on his Hand and then dejected spoke  Her Bosom labour'd with a boding Sigh  And the big Tear stood trembling in her Eye  Too daring Prince ah whither dost thou run  Ah too forgetful of thy Wife and Son  And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be  A Widow I an helpless Orphan He  For sure such Courage Length of Life denies  And thou must fall thy Virtue's Sacrifice  Greece  in her single Heroes strove in vain  Now Hosts oppose thee and thou must be slain  Oh grant me Gods e're  Hector  meets his Doom  All I can ask of Heav'n an early Tomb  So shall my Days in one sad Tenor run  And end with Sorrows as they first begun  No Parent now remains my Griefs to share  No Father's Aid no Mother's tender Care  The fierce  Achilles  wrapt our Walls in Fire  Lay'd  Theb√®  waste and slew my warlike Sire  His Fate Compassion in the Victor bred  Stern as he was he yet rever'd the Dead  His radiant Arms preserv'd from hostile Spoil  And lay'd him decent on the Fun'ral Pyle  Then rais'd a Mountain where his Bones were burn'd  The Mountain Nymphs the rural Tomb adorn'd  Jove  's Sylvan Daughters bade their Elms bestow  A barren Shade and in his Honour grow  By the same Arm my sev'n brave Brothers fell  In one sad Day beheld the Gates of Hell  While the fat Herds and snowie Flocks they fed  Amid their Fields the hapless Heroes bled  My Mother liv'd to bear the Victor's Bands  The Queen of  Hippoplacia  's Sylvan Lands  Redeem'd too late she scarce beheld again  Her pleasing Empire and her native Plain  When ah opprest by Lifeconsuming Woe  She fell a Victim to  Diana  's Bow  Yet while my  Hector  still survives I see  My Father Mother Brethren all in thee  Alas my Parents Brothers Kindred all  Once more will perish if my  Hector  fall  Thy Wife thy Infant in thy Danger share  Oh prove a Husband's and a Father's Care  That Quarter most the skillful  Greeks  annoy  Where yon' wild FigTrees join the Wall of  Troy  Thou from this Tow'r defend th' important Post  There  Agamemnon  points his dreadful Host  That Pass  Tydides Ajax  strive to gain  And there the vengeful  Spartan  fires his Train  Thrice our bold Foes the fierce Attack have giv'n  Or led by Hopes or dictated from Heav'n  Let others in the Field their Arms employ  But stay my  Hector  here and guard his  Troy  The Chief reply'd That Post shall be my Care  Nor that alone but all the Works of War  How would the Sons of  Troy  in Arms renown'd  And  Troy  's proud Dames whose Garments sweep the Ground  Attaint the Lustre of my former Name  Should  Hector  basely quit the Field of Fame  My early Youth was bred to martial Pains  My Soul impells me to th' embattel'd Plains  Let me be foremost to defend the Throne  And guard my Father's Glories and my own  Yet come it will the Day decreed by Fates  How my Heart trembles while my Tongue relates  The Day when thou Imperial  Troy  must bend  And see thy Warriors fall thy Glories end  And yet no dire Prefage so wounds my Mind  My Mother's Death the Ruin of my Kind  Not  Priam  's hoary Hairs defil'd with Gore  Not all my Brothers gasping on the Shore  As thine  Andromache  thy Griefs I dread  I see thee trembling weeping Captive led  In  Argive  Looms our Battels to design  And Woes of which so large a Part was thine  To bear the Victor's hard Commands or bring  The Weight of Waters from  Hyperia  's Spring  There while you groan beneath the Load of Life  They cry Behold the mighty  Hector  's Wife  Some haughty  Greek  who lives thy Tears to see  Embitters all thy Woes by naming me  The Thoughts of Glory past and present Shame  A thousand Griefs shall waken at the Name  May I lie cold before that dreadful Day  Press'd with a Load of Monumental Clay  Thy  Hector  wrapt in everlasting Sleep  Shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep  Thus having spoke th' illustrious Chief of  Troy  Stretch'd his fond Arms to clasp the lovely Boy  The Babe clung crying to his Nurse's Breast  Scar'd at the dazling Helm and nodding Crest  With secret Pleasure each fond Parent smil'd  And  Hector  hasted to relieve his Child  The glitt'ring Terrors from his Brows unbound  And plac'd the beaming Helmet on the Ground  Then kist the Child and lifting high in Air  Thus to the Gods prefer'd a Father's Pray'r  O Thou whose Glory fills th' Aetherial Throne  And all ye deathless Pow'rs protect my Son  Grant him like me to purchase just Renown  To guard the  Trojans  to defend the Crown  Against his Country's Foes the War to wage  And rise the  Hector  of the future Age  So when triumphant from successful Toils  Of Heroes slain he bears the reeking Spoils  Whole Hosts may hail him with deserv'd Acclaim  And say This Chief transcends his Father's Fame  While pleas'd amidst the gen'ral Shouts of  Troy  His Mother's conscious Heart o'erflows with Joy  He spoke and fondly gazing on her Charms  Restor'd the pleasing Burden to her Arms  Soft on her fragrant Breast the Babe she laid  Hush'd to Repose and with a Smile survey'd  The troubled Pleasure soon chastis'd by Fear  She mingled with the Smile a tender Tear  The soften'd Chief with kind Compassion view'd  And dry'd the falling Drops and thus pursu'd  Andromache  my Soul's far better Part  Why with untimely Sorrows heaves thy Heart  No hostile Hand can antedate my Doom  Till Fate condemns me to the silent Tomb  Fix'd is the Term to all the Race of Earth  And such the hard Condition of our Birth  No Force can then resist no Flight can save  All sink alike the Fearful and the Brave  No morebut hasten to thy Tasks at home  There guide the Spindle and direct the Loom  Me Glory summons to the martial Scene  The Field of Combate is the Sphere for Men  Where Heroes war the foremost Place I claim  The first in Danger as the first in Fame  Thus having said the glorious Chief resumes  His Tow'ry Helmet black with shading Plumes  His Princess parts with a prophetick Sigh  Unwilling parts and oft' reverts her Eye  That stream'd at ev'ry Look then moving slow  Sought her own Palace and indulg'd her Woe  There while her Tears deplor'd the Godlike Man  Thro' all her Train the soft Infection ran  The pious Maids their mingled Sorrows shed  And mourn the living  Hector  as the dead  But now no longer deaf to Honour's Call  Forth issues  Paris  from the Palace Wall  In Brazen Arms that cast a gleamy Ray  Swift thro' the Town the Warrior bends his way  The wanton Courser thus with Reins unbound  Breaks from his Stall and beats the trembling Ground  Pamper'd and proud he seeks the wonted Tides  And laves in Height of Blood his shining Sides  His Head now freed he tosses to the Skies  His Mane dishevel'd o'er his Shoulders flies  He snuffs the Females in the distant Plain  And springs exulting to his Fields again  With equal Triumph sprightly bold and gay  In Arms refulgent as the God of Day  The Son of  Priam  glorying in his Might  Rush'd forth with  Hector  to the Fields of Fight  And now the Warriors passing on the way  The graceful  Paris  first excus'd his Stay  To whom the noble  Hector  thus reply'd  O Chief in Blood and now in Arms ally'd  Thy Pow'r in War with Justice none contest  Known is thy Courage and thy Strength confest  What Pity Sloath should seize a Soul so brave  Or Godlike  Paris  live a Woman's Slave  My Heart weeps Blood at what the  Trojans  say  And hopes thy Deeds shall wipe the Stain away  Haste then in all their glorious Labours share  For much they suffer for thy sake in War  These Ills shall cease whene'er by  Jove  's Decree  We crown the Bowl to  Heav'n  and  Liberty  While the proud Foe his frustrate Triumphs mourns  And  Greece  indignant thro' her Seas returns  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Sixth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SIXTH BOOK  I  VERSE  FIRST  Ajax  Ajax  performs his Exploits immediately upon the Departure of the Gods from the Battel It is observ'd that this Hero is never assisted by the Deities as most of the rest are See his Character in the Notes on the seventh Book The Expression of the  Greek  is that he  brought Light to his Troops  which M  Dacier  takes to be metaphorical I do not see but it may be literal he broke the thick Squadrons of the Enemy and open'd a Passage for the Light  II  VERSE  The  Thracian  Acamas    This  Thracian  Prince is the same in whose Likeness  Mars  appears in the preceding Book rallying the  Trojans  and forcing the  Greeks  to retire In the present Description of his Strength and Size we see with what Propriety this Personage was selected by the Poet as fit to be assumed by the God of War  III  VERSE Axylus  Hospitable    This beautiful Character of  Axylus  has not been able to escape the Misunderstanding of  some of the Commentators who thought  Homer  design'd it as a Reproof of an undistinguish'd Generosity It is evidently a Panegyrick on that Virtue and not improbably on the Memory of some excellent but unfortunate Man in that Country whom the Poet honours with the noble Title of  A Friend to Mankind  It is indeed a severe Reproof of the Ingratitude of Men and a kind of Satyr on human Race while he represents this Lover of his Species miserably perishing without Assistance from any of those Numbers he had obliged This Death is very moving and the Circumstance of a faithful Servant's dying by his side well imagined and natural to such a Character His manner of keeping House near a frequented Highway and relieving all Travellers is agreeable to that ancient Hospitality which we now only read of There is Abundance of this Spirit every where in the  Odysseis  The Patriarchs in the Old Testament sit at their Gates to see those who pass by and entreat them to enter into their Houses This cordial manner of Invitation is particularly described in the  th  and  th  Chapters of  Genesis  The  Eastern  Nations seem to have had a peculiar Disposition to these Exercises of Humanity which continues in a great measure to this Day It is yet a Piece of Charity frequent with the  Turks  to erect  Caravanserahs  or Inns for the Reception of Travellers Since I am upon this Head I must mention one or two extraordinary Examples of ancient Hospitality  Diodorus Siculus  writes of  Gallias  of  Agrigentum  that having built severall Inns for the Relief of Strangers he appointed Persons at the Gates to invite all who travell'd to make use of them and that this Example was followed by many others who were inclined after the ancient manner to live in a human and beneficent Correspondence with Mankind That this  Gallias  entertain'd and cloathed at one time no less than five hundred Horsemen and that there were in his Cellars three hundred Vessels each of which contain'd an hundred Hogsheads of Wine The same Author tells us of another  Agrigentine  that at the Marriage of his Daughter feasted all the People of his City who at that time were above twenty thousand  Herodotus  in his seventh Book has a Story of this kind which is prodigious being of a private Man so immensely  rich as to entertain  Xerxes  and his whole Army I shall transcribe the Passage as I find it translated to my Hands  "  Pythius  the Son of  Atys  a  Lydian  then residing in  Celaene  entertain'd the King and all his Army with great Magnificence and offer'd him his Treasures towards the Expence of the War which Liberality  Xerxes  communicating to the  Persians  about him and asking who this  Pythius  was and what Riches he might have to enable him to make such an Offer Receiv'd this Answer  Pythius  said they is the Person who presented your Father  Darius  with a PlaneTree and Vine of Gold and after you is the richest Man we know in the World  Xerxes  surpriz'd with these last Words ask'd him to what Sum his Treasures might amount I shall conceal nothing from you said  Pythius  nor pretend to be ignorant of my own Wealth but being perfectly inform'd of the State of my Accompts shall tell you the Truth with Sincerity When I heard you was ready to begin the March towards the  Grecian  Sea I resolv'd to present you with a Sum of Money towards the Charge of the War and to that end having taken an Account of my Riches I found by Computation that I had two thousand Talents of Silver and three Millions nine hundred ninety three thousand Pieces of Gold bearing the Stamp of  Darius  These Treasures I freely give you because I shall be sufficiently furnish'd with whatever is necessary to Life by the Labour of my Servants and Husbandmen  "  Xerxes  heard these Words with Pleasure and in answer to  Pythius  said My  Lydian  Host since I parted from  Susa  I have not found a Man besides your self who has offer'd to entertain my Army or voluntarily to contribute his Treasures to promote the present Expedition You alone have treated my Army magnificently and readily offer'd me immense Riches Therefore in Return of your Kindness I make you my Host and that you may be Master of the intire Sum of four Millions in Gold I will give you seven thousand  Darian  Pieces out of my own Treasure Keep then all the Riches you now possess and  if you know how to continue always in the same good Disposition you shall never have reason to repent of your Affection to me either now or in future time  The Sum here offer'd by  Pythius  amounts by  Brerewood  's Computation to three Millions three hundred seventy five thousand Pounds Sterling according to the lesser Valuation of Talents I make no Apology for inserting so remarkable a Passage at length but shall only add that it was at last the Fate of this  Pythius  like our  Axylus  to experience the Ingratitude of Man his eldest Son being afterwards cut in Pieces by the same  Xerxes  IV  VERSE  Oh spare my Youth  c  This Passage where  Agamemnon  takes away that  Trojan  's Life whom  Menelaus  had pardoned and is not blamed by  Homer  for so doing must be ascribed to the uncivilized Manners of those Times when Mankind was not united by the Bonds of a rational Society and is not therefore to be imputed to the Poet who followed Nature as it was in his Days The Historical Books of the Old Testament abound in Instances of the like Cruelty to conquer'd Enemies  Virgil  had this Part of  Homer  in his View when he described the Death of  Magus  in the tenth  Aeneid  Those Lines of his Prayer where he offers a Ransome are translated from this of  Adrastus  but both the Prayer and the Answer  Aeneas  makes when he refuses him Mercy are very much heighten'd and improved They also receive a great Addition of Beauty and Propriety from the Occasion on which he inserts them Young  Pallas  is just kill'd and  Aeneas  seeking to be reveng'd upon  Turnus  meets this  Magus  Nothing can be a more artful Piece of Address than the first Lines of that Supplication if we consider the Character of  Aeneas  to whom it is made  Per patrios manes per spes surgentis J√ºli  Te precor hanc animam serves natoque Patrique  And what can exceed the Closeness and Fullness of that Reply to it  Belli commercia Turnus  Sustulit ista prior jam tum Pallante perempto  Hoc patris Anchisae manes hoc sentit J√ºlus  This removes the Imputation of Cruelty from  Aeneas  which had less agreed with his Character than it does with  Agamemnon  's whose Reproof to  Menelaus  in this Place is not unlike that of  Samuel  to  Saul  for not killing  Agag  V  VERSE  Her Infants at the Breast shall fall    Or her Infants  yet in the Womb  for it will bear either Sense But I think Madam  Dacier  in the right in her Affirmation that the  Greeks  were not arrived to that Pitch of Cruelty to rip up the Wombs of Women with Child  Homer  says she to remove all equivocal Meaning from this Phrase adds the Words    juvenem puerulum existentem  which would be ridiculous were it said of a Child yet unborn Besides he would never have represented one of his first Heroes capable of so barbarous a Crime or at least would not have commended him as he does just after for such a wicked Exhortation  VI  VERSE  First gain the Conquest then divide the Spoil    This important Maxim of War is very naturally introduced upon  Nestor  's having seen  Menelaus  ready to spare an Enemy for the sake of a Ransome It was for such Lessons as these says M  Dacier  that  Alexander  so much esteem'd  Homer  and study'd his Poem He made his Use of this Precept in the Battel of  Arbela  when  Parmenio  being in danger of weakening the main Body to defend the Baggage he sent this Message to him Leave the Baggage there for if we carry the Victory we shall not only recover what is our  own but be Masters of all that is the Enemy's Histories ancient and modern are fill'd with Examples of Enterprizes that have miscarry'd and Battels that have been lost by the Greediness of Soldiers for Pillage  VII  VERSE  Wise to consult and active to defend    This is a twofold Branch of Praise expressing the Excellence of these Princes both in Council and in Battel I think Madam  Dacier  's Translation does not come up to the Sense of the Original  Les plus hardis les plus experimentez des nos Capitains  VIII  VERSE  Thou  Hector  to the Town    It has been a modern Objection to  Homer  's Conduct that  Hector  upon whom the whole Fate of the Day depended is made to retire from the Battel only to carry a Message to  Troy  concerning a Sacrifice which might have been done as well by any other They think it absurd in  Helenus  to advise this and in  Hector  to comply with it What occasion'd this false Criticism was that they imagin'd it to be a Piece of  Advice  and not a  Command Helenus  was a Priest and Augur of the highest Rank he enjoins it as a Point of Religion and  Hector  obeys him as one inspired from Heaven The  Trojan  Army was in the utmost Distress occasion'd by the prodigious Slaughter made by  Diomed  There was therefore more Reason and Necessity to propitiate  Minerva  who assisted that Hero which  Helenus  might know tho'  Hector  would have chosen to have stay'd and trusted to the Arm of Flesh Here is nothing but what may agree with each of their Characters  Hector  goes as he was obliged in Religion but not before he has animated the Troops reestablished the Combate repulsed the  Greeks  to some distance received a Promise from  Helenus  that they would make a stand at the Gates and given one himself to the Army that he would soon return to the Fight All which  Homer  has been careful to specify to save the Honour and preserve the Character of this Hero As to  Helenus  his  Part he saw the Straits his Countrymen were reduced to he knew his Authority as a Priest and design'd to revive the Courage of the Troops by a Promise of divine Assistance Nothing adds more Courage to the Minds of Men than Superstition and perhaps it was the only Expedient then left much like a modern Practice in the Army to enjoin a  Fast  when they wanted Provision  Helenus  could no way have made his Promise more credible than by sending away  Hector  which look'd like an Assurance that nothing could prejudice them during his Absence on such a religious Account No Leader of less Authority than  Hector  could so properly have enjoin'd this solemn Act of Religion and lastly no other whose Valour was less known than his could have left the Army in this Juncture without a Taint upon his Honour  Homer  makes this Piety succeed  Paris  is brought back to the Fight the  Trojans  afterwards prevail and  Jupiter  appears openly in their favour  l  Tho' after all I cannot dissemble my Opinion that the Poet's chief Intention in this was to introduce that fine Episode of the Parting of  Hector  and  Andromache  This Change of the Scene to  Troy  furnishes him with a great Number of Beauties  By this means  says  Eustathius    his Poem is for a time divested of the Fierceness and Violence of Battels and being as it were wash'd from Slaughter and Blood becomes calm and smiling by the Beauty of these various Episodes  IX  VERSE  If so the Pow'r atton'd    The Poet here plainly supposes  Helenus  by his Skill in Augury or some other divine Inspiration well inform'd that the Might of  Diomed  which wrought such great Destruction among the  Trojans  was the Gift of  Pallas  incens'd against them The Prophet therefore directs Prayers Offerings and Sacrifices to be made to appease the Anger of this offended Goddess not to invoke the Mercy of any propitious Deity This is conformable to the whole System of  Pagan  Superstition the Worship whereof being grounded not on Love but Fear seems directed rather to avert the Malice and Anger of a wrathful and  mischievous Daemon than to implore the Assistance and Protection of a benevolent Being In this Strain of Religion this same Prophet is introduced by  Virgil  in the third  Aeneid  giving particular Direction to  Aeneas  to appease the Indignation of  Juno  as the only means which could bring his Labours to a prosperous End  Unum illud tibi nate Dea praeque omnibus unum  Praedicam repetens iterumque iterumque monebo  Junonis magnae primum prece numen adora  Junoni cane vota libens dominamque potentem  Supplicibus supera donis  X  VERSE  The Interview of  Glaucus  and  Diomed  No Passage in our Author has been the Subject of more severe and groundless Criticisms than this where these two Heroes enter into a long Conversation as they will have it in the Heat of a Battel Monsieur  Dacier  's Answer in Defence of  Homer  is so full that I cannot do better than to translate it from his Remarks on the  th  Chapter of  Aristotle  's  Poetic  There can be nothing more unjust than the Criticisms past upon things that are the Effect of Custom It was usual in ancient Times for Soldiers to talk together before they encounter'd  Homer  is full of Examples of this sort and he very well deserves we should be so just as to believe he had never done it so often but that it was agreeable to the Manners of his Age But this is not only a thing of Custom but founded in Reason itself The Ties of Hospitality in those Times were held more sacred than those of Blood and it is on that Account  Diomed  gives so long an Audience to  Glaucus  whom he acknowledges to be his Guest with whom it was not lawful to engage in Combate  Homer  makes an admirable Use of this Conjuncture to introduce an entertaining History after so many Battels as he has been describing and to unbend the Mind of his Reader by a Recital of so much Variety as the Story of the Family of  Sisyphus  It may be farther observ'd with what  Address and Management he places this long Conversation it is not during the Heat of an obstinate Battel which had been too unseasonable to be excused by any Custom whatever but he brings it in after he has made  Hector  retire into  Troy  when the Absence of so powerful an Enemy had given  Diomed  that Leisure which he could not have had otherwise One need only read the judicious Remark of  Eustathius  upon this Place  The Poet  says he  after having caus'd  Hector  to go out of the Fight interrupts the Violence of Wars and gives some Relaxation to the Reader in causing him to pass from the Confusion and Disorder of the Action to the Tranquillity and Security of an Historical Narration For by means of the happy Episode of  Glaucus  he casts a thousand pleasing Wonders into his Poem as Fables that include beautiful Allegories Histories Genealogies Sentences ancient Customs and several other Graces that tend to the diversifying of his Work and which by breaking as one may say the Monotomy of it agreeably instruct the Reader  Let us observe in how fine a manner  Homer  has hereby praised both  Diomed  and  Hector  For he makes us know that as long as  Hector  is in the Field the  Greeks  have not the least Leisure to take breath and that as soon as he quits it all the  Trojans  however they had regain'd all their Advantages were not able to employ  Diomed  so far as to prevent his entertaining himself with  Glaucus  without any danger to his Party Some may think after all that tho' we may justify  Homer  we cannot excuse the Manners of his Time it not being natural for Men with Swords in their Hands to dialogue together in cold Blood just before they engage But not to alledge that these very Manners yet remain in those Countries which have not been corrupted by the Commerce of other Nations which is a great Sign of their being natural what Reason can be offer'd that it is more natural to fall on at first Sight with Rage and Fierceness than to speak to an Enemy before the Encounter Thus far Monsieur  Dacier  and St  Evremont  asks humourously if it might not be as proper in that Country for Men to harangue before they fought as it is in  England  to make Speeches before they are hanged  That  Homer  is not in general apt to make unseasonable Harangues as these Censurers would represent may appear from that remarkable Care he has shewn in many Places to avoid them As when in the fifth Book  Aeneas  being cured on a sudden in the middle of the Fight is seen with Surprize by his Soldiers he specifies with particular Caution that they  asked him no Questions how he became cured  in a time of so much Business and Action Again when there is a Necessity in the same Book that  Minerva  should have a Conference with  Diomed  in order to engage him against  Mars  after her Prohibition to him to fight with the Gods  Homer  chuses a time for that Speech just when the Hero is retir'd behind his Chariot to take Breath which was the only Moment that could be spared during the Hurry of that whole Engagement One might produce many Instances of the same kind  The Discourse of  Glaucus  to  Diomed  is severely censured not only on Account of the Circumstance of Time and Place but likewise on the Score of the Subject which is taxed as improper and foreign to the End and Design of the Poem But the Criticks who have made this Objection seem neither to comprehend the Design of the Poet in general nor the particular Aim of this Discourse Many Passages in the best ancient Poets appear unaffecting at present which probably gave the greatest Delight to their first Readers because they were nearly interested in what was there related It is very plain that  Homer  designed this Poem as a Monument to the Honour of the  Greeks  who tho' consisting of several independent Societies were yet very national in Point of Glory being strongly affected with every thing that seem'd to advance the Honour of their common Country and resentful of any Indignity offer'd to it This Disposition was the Ground of that grand Alliance which is the Subject of this Poem To Men so fond of their Country's Glory what could be more agreeable than to read a History fill'd with Wonders of a noble Family transplanted from  Greece  into  Asia  They might here learn with Pleasure that the  Grecian  Virtues did not degenerate by removing into distant Climes but especially they must be affected with uncommon Delight to find that  Sarpedon  and  Glaucus  the bravest of the  Trojan  Auxiliaries were originally  Greeks  Tasso  in this manner has introduced an agreeable Episode which shews  Clorinda  the Offspring of  Christian  Parents tho' engag'd in the Service of the  Infidels  Cant  XI  VERSE  Between both Armies met  c  It is usual with  Homer  before he introduces a Hero to make as it were a Halt to render him the more remarkable Nothing could more prepare the Attention and Expectation of the Reader than this Circumstance at the first meeting of  Diomed  and  Glaucus  Just at the Time when the Mind begins to be weary with the Battel it is diverted with the Prospect of a single Combate which of a sudden turns to an Interview of Friendship and an unexpected Scene of sociable Virtue The whole Air of the Conversation between these two Heroes has something heroically solemn in it  XII  VERSE  But if from Heav'n  c  A quick change of Mind from the greatest Impiety to as great Superstition is frequently observable in Men who having been guilty of the most heinous Crimes without any Remorse on the sudden are fill'd with Doubts and Scruples about the most lawful or indifferent Actions This seems the present Case of  Diomed  who having knowingly wounded and insulted the Deities is now afraid to engage the first Man he meets lest perhaps a God might be conceal'd in that Shape This Disposition of  Diomed  produces the Question he puts to  Glaucus  which without this Consideration will appear impertinent and so naturally occasions that agreeable Episode of  Bellerophon  which  Glaucus  relates in answer to  Diomed  XIII  VERSE  Not long  Lycurgus c  What  Diomed  here says is the Effect of Remorse as if he had exceeded the Commission of  Pallas  in encountring with the Gods and dreaded the Consequences of proceeding too far At least he had no such Commission now and besides was no longer capable of distinguishing them from Men a Faculty she had given him in the foregoing Book He therefore mentions this Story of  Lycurgus  as an Example that sufficed to terrify him from so rash an Undertaking The Ground of the Fable they say is this  Lycurgus  caused most of the Vines of his Country to be rooted up so that his Subjects were obliged to mix it with Water when it was less plentiful Hence it was feign'd that  Thetis  receiv'd  Bacchus  into her Bosom  XIV  VERSE  Immortals blest with endless Ease    Tho'  Dacier  's and most of the Versions take no Notice of the Epithet used in this Place    Dii facil√® seu beat√® viventes  the Translator thought it a Beauty which he could not but endeavour to preserve  XV  VERSE  Approach and enter the dark Gates of Death    This haughty Air which  Homer  gives his Heroes was doubtless a Copy of the Manners and hyperbolical Speeches of those Times Thus  Goliah  to  David Sam  Ch  Approach and I will give thy Flesh to the Fowls of the Air and the Beasts of the Field  The Orientals speak the same Language to this Day  XVI  VERSE  Like Leaves on Trees    There is a noble Gravity in the beginning of this Speech of  Glaucus  according to the true Style of Antiquity  Few and evil are our Days  This beautiful Thought of our Author whereby the Race of Men are compared to the Leaves of Trees is celebrated by  Simonides  in a fine Fragment extant in  Stobaeus  The same Thought may be found in  Ecclesiasticus  Ch ‚Ñ£ almost in the same Words  As of the green Leaves on a thick Tree some fall and some grow so is the Generation of Flesh and Blood one cometh to an end and another is born  The Reader who has seen so many Passages imitated from  Homer  by succeeding Poets will no doubt be pleased to see one of an ancient Poet which  Homer  has here imitated this is a Fragment of  Musaeus  preserv'd by  Clemens Alexandrinus  in his  Stromata Lib    Tho' this Comparison be justly admir'd for its Beauty in this obvious Application to the Mortality and Succession of human Life it seems however design'd by the Poet in this Place as a proper Emblem of the transitory State not of Men but of Families which being by their Misfortunes or Follies fallen and decay'd do again in a happier Season revive and flourish in the Fame and Virtues of their Posterity In this Sense it is a direct Answer to what  Diomed  had ask'd as well as a proper Preface to what  Glaucus  relates of his own Family which having been extinct in  Corinth  had recover'd new Life in  Lycia  XVII  VERSE  Then call'd  Ephyre  It was the same which was afterwards called  Corinth  and had that Name in  Homer  's Time as appears from this Catalogue ‚Ñ£  XVIII  VERSE  Lov'd for that Valour which preserves Mankind    This Distinction of true Valour which has the Good of Mankind for its End in Opposition to the Valour of Tyrants or Oppressors is beautifully hinted by  Homer  in the Epithet    amiable Valour  Such as was that of  Bellerophon  who freed the Land from Monsters and Creatures destructive to his Species It is apply'd to this young Hero with particular Judgment and Propriety if we consider the Innocence and Gentleness of his Manners appearing from the following Story which every one will observe has a great Resemblance with that of  Joseph  in the Scriptures  XIX  VERSE  The faithful Youth his Monarch's Mandate show'd    Plutarch  much commends the Virtue of  Bellerophon  who faithfully carry'd those Letters he might so justly suspect of ill Consequence to him The Passage is in his Discourse of  Curiosity  and worth transcribing  "A Man of Curiosity is void of all Faith and it is better to trust Letters or any important Secrets to Servants than to Friends and Familiars of an inquisitive Temper  Bellerophon  when he carry'd Letters that order'd his own Destruction did not unseal them but forbore touching the King's Dispatches with the same Continence as he had refrain'd from injuring his Bed For Curiosity is an Incontinence as well as Adultery  XX  VERSE  First dire  Chimaera  Chimaera  was feign'd to have the Head of a Lion breathing Flames the Body of a Goat and the Tail of a Dragon because the Mountain of that Name in  Lycia  had a  Vulcano  on its top and nourish'd Lions the middle Part afforded Pasture for Goats and the bottom was infested with Serpents  Bellerophon  destroying these and rendring the Mountain habitable was said to have conquer'd  Chimaera  He calls this Monster  in the manner of the  Hebrews  who gave to any thing vast or extraordinary the Appellative of  Divine  So the Psalmist says  The Mountains of God  c  XXI  VERSE  The  Solymaean  Crew    These  Solymi  were an ancient Nation inhabiting the mountainous Parts of  Asia  Minor between  Lycia  and  Pisidia Pliny  mentions them as an Instance of a People so entirely destroy'd that no Footsteps of them remain'd in his Time Some Authors both ancient and modern from a Resemblance in sound to the  Latin  Name of  Jerusalem  have confounded them with the  Jews Tacitus  speaking of the various Opinions concerning the Origin of the  Jewish  Nation has these Words  Clara alii tradunt Judaeorum initia Solymos carminibus Homeri celebratum gentem conditae urbi Hierosolymam nomen √® suo fecisse  Hist Lib  XXII  VERSE  The  Lycians  grant a chosen Space of Ground    It was usual in the ancient Times upon any signal Piece of Service perform'd by the Kings or great Men to have a Portion of Land decreed by the Publick as a Reward to them Thus when  Sarpedon  in the twelfth Book incites  Glaucus  to behave himself valiantly he puts him in mind of these Possessions granted by his Countrymen  c  In the same manner in the ninth Book of  Virgil Nisus  is promised by  Ascanius  the  Fields  which were possess'd by  Latinus  as a Reward for the Service he undertook  Campi quod rex habet ipse Latinus  Chapman  has an Interpolation in this Place to tell us that this  Field  was afterwards called by the  Lycians The Field of Wandrings  from the Wandrings and Distraction of  Bellerophon  in the latter Part of his Life But they were not  these Fields that were call'd  but those upon which he fell from the Horse  Pegasus  when he endeavour'd as the Fable has it to mount to Heaven  XXIII  VERSE  But when at last  c  The same Criticks who have taxed  Homer  for being too tedious in this Story of  Bellerophon  have censured him for omitting to relate the particular Offence which had rais'd the Anger of the Gods against a Man formerly so highly favour'd by them But this Relation coming from the Mouth of his Grandson it is with great Decorum and Propriety he passes over in Silence those Crimes of his Ancestor which had provok'd the divine Vengeance against him  Milton  has interwoven this Story with what  Homer  here relates of  Bellerophon  Lest from this flying Steed unrein'd as once  Bellerophon  though from a lower Clime  Dismounted on the  Aleian  Field I fall  Erroneous there to wander and forlorn  Parad lost B  Tully  in his third Book of  Tusculane  Questions having observ'd that Persons oppress'd with Woe naturally seek Solitude instances this Example of  Bellerophon  and gives us his Translation of two of these Lines  Qui miser in campos moerens errabat Aleis  Ipse suum cor edens hominum vestigia vitans  XXIV  VERSE  Our Grandsires have been Guests of old    The Laws of Hospitality were anciently held in great Veneration The Friendship contracted hereby was so sacred that they prefer'd it to all the Bands of Consanguinity and Alliance and accounted it obligatory even to the third and fourth Generation We have seen in the foregoing Story of  Bellerophon  that  Proetus  a Prince under the Supposition of being injur'd in the highest degree is yet afraid to revenge himself upon the Criminal on this Account He is forced to send him into  Lycia  rather than be guilty of a Breach of this Law in his own Country And the King of  Lycia  having entertain'd the Stranger before he unseal'd the Letters puts him upon Expeditions abroad in which he might be destroy'd rather than at his Court We here see  Diomed  and  Glaucus  agreeing not to be Enemies during the whole Course of a War only because their Grandfathers had been mutual Guests And we afterwards find  Tea  er  engaged with the  Greeks  on this Account against the  Trojans  tho' he was himself of  Trojan  Extraction the Nephew of  Priam  by the Mother's side and Cousin German of  Hector  whose Life he pursues with the utmost Violence They preserved in their Families the Presents which had been made on these Occasions as obliged to transmit to their Children the Memorials of this Right of Hospitality  Eustathius  XXV  VERSE Jove  warm'd his Bosom and enlarg'd his Mind    The Words in the Original are  which may equally be interpreted  he took away his Sense  or  he elevated his Mind  The former being a Reflection upon  Glaucus  's Prudence for making so unequal an Exchange the latter a Praise of the Magnanimity and Generosity which induced him to it  Porphyry  contends for its being understood in this last way and  Eustathius  Monsieur and Madam  Dacier  are of the same Opinion Notwithstanding it is certain that  Homer  uses the same Words in the contrary Sense in the seventeenth Iliad ‚Ñ£ and in the nineteenth ‚Ñ£ And it is an obvious Remark that the Interpretation of  Porphyry  as much dishonours  Diomed  who proposed this Exchange as it does Honour to  Glaucus  for consenting to it However I have followed it if not as the juster as the most heroic Sense and as it has the nobler Air in Poetry  XXVI  VERSE  A hundred Beeves    I wonder the Curious have not remark'd from this Place that the Proportion of the Value of  Gold  to  Brass  in the Time of the  Trojan  War was but as an  hundred  to  nine  allowing these Armours of equal Weight which as they belong'd to Men of equal Strength is a reasonable Supposition As to this manner of computing the Value of the Armour by  Beeves  or  Oxen  it might be either because the Money was anciently stamp'd with those Figures or which is most probable in this Place because in those Times they generally purchased by Exchange of Commodities as we see by a Passage near the end of the seventh Book  XXVII  VERSE  Far hence be  Bacchus'  GiftsEnflaming Wine    This Maxim of  Hector  's concerning Wine has a great deal of Truth in it It is a vulgar Mistake to imagine the Use of Wine either raises the Spirits or encreases Strength The best Physicians agree with  Homer  in the Point whatever our modern Soldiers may object to this old heroic  Regimen  One may take notice that  Sampson  as well as  Hector  was a Waterdrinker for he was a  Nazarite  by Vow and as such was forbid the Use of Wine To which  Milton  alludes in his  Sampson Agonistes  Whereever Fountain or fresh Current flow'd  Against the Eastern Ray translucent pure  With touch Aethereal of Heav'ns fiery Rod  I drank from the clear milky Juice allaying  Thirst and refresh'd nor envy'd them the Grape  Whose Heads that turbulent Liquor fills with Fumes  XXVIII  VERSE  Ill fits it me with human Gore distain'd  c  The Custom which prohibits Persons polluted with Blood to perform any Offices of divine Worship before they were purified is so ancient and universal that it may in some sort be esteem'd a Precept of natural Religion tending to inspire an uncommon Dread and religious Horror of Bloodshed There is a fine Passage in  Euripides  where  Iphigenia  argues how impossible it is that human Sacrifices should be acceptable to the Gods since they do not permit any defil'd with Blood or even polluted with the Touch of a dead Body to come near their Altars  Iphig in Tauris  ‚Ñ£  Virgil  makes his  Aeneas  say the same thing  Hector  does here  Me bello √® tanto digressum caede recenti  Attrectare nefas donec me flumine vivo  Abluero  XXIX  VERSE Sidonian  Maids    Dictys Cretensis lib  acquaints us that  Paris  return'd not directly to  Troy  after the Rape of  Helen  but fetch'd a Compass probably to avoid Pursuit He touch'd at  Sidon  where he surprized the King of  Phoenicia  by Night and carry'd off many of his Treasures and Captives among which probably were these  Sidonian  Women The Author of the ancient Poem of the  Cypriacks  says he sailed from  Sparta  to  Troy  in the Space of three Days from which Passage  Herodotus  concludes that Poem was not  Homer  's We find in the Scriptures that  Tyre  and  Sidon  were famous for Works in Gold Embroidery  c  and for whatever regarded Magnificence and Luxury  XXX  VERSE  With Hands uplifted    The only Gesture describ'd by  Homer  as used by the Ancients in the Invocation of the Gods is the lifting up their Hands to Heaven  Virgil  frequently alludes to this Practice particularly in the second Book there is a Passage the Beauty of which is much rais'd by this Consideration  Ecce trahebatur passis Priameia virgo  Crinibus a Templo Cassandra adytisque Minervae  Ad caelum tendens ardentia lumina frustra  Lumina  nam teneras arcebant vincula  palmas  XXXI  VERSE  Oh awful Goddess  c  This Procession of the  Trojan  Matrons to the Temple of  Minerva  with their Offering and the Ceremonies tho' it be a Passage some Moderns have criticis'd upon seems to have particularly pleas'd  Virgil  For he has not only introduced it among the Figures in the Picture at  Carthage  Interea ad templum non aequae Palladis ibant  Crinibus Iliades passis peplumque ferebant  Suppliciter tristes tunsis pectora palmis  Diva solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat  But he has again copied it in the eleventh Book where the  Latian  Dames make the same Procession upon the Approach of  Aeneas  to their City The Prayer to the Goddess is translated almost word for word  Armipotens praeses belli Tritonia virgo  Frange manu telum Phrygii praedonis ipsum  Pronum sterne solo portisque effunde sub altis  This Prayer in the  Latin  Poet seems introduced with less Propriety since  Pallas  appears no where interested in the Conduct of Affairs thro' the whole  Aeneid  The first Line of the  Greek  here is translated more literally than the former Versions  I take the first Epithet to allude to  Minerva  's being the particular Protectress of  Troy  by means of the  Palladium  and not as Mr  Hobbes  understands it the Protectress of all Cities in general  XXXII  VERSE  But they vow'd in vain    For  Helenus  only ordered that Prayers should be made to  Minerva  to drive  Diomed  from before the Walls But  Theano  prays that  Diomed  may perish and perish flying which is included in his falling  forward  Madam  Dacier  is so free as to observe here that Women are seldom moderate in the Prayers they make against their Enemies and therefore are seldom heard  XXXIII  VERSE  Himself the Mansion rais'd    I must own my self not so great an Enemy to  Paris  as some of the Commentators His blind Passion is the unfortunate Occasion of the Ruine of his Country and he has the ill Fate to have all his fine Qualities swallowed up in that And indeed I cannot say he endeavours much to be a better Man than his Nature made him But as to his Parts and Turn of Mind I see nothing that is either weak or wicked the general Manners of those Times considered On the contrary a gentle Soul patient of good Advice tho' indolent enough to forget it and liable only to that Frailty of Love which methinks might in his Case as well as  Helen  's be charged upon the  Stars  and the  Gods  So very amorous a Constitution and so incomparable a Beauty to provoke it might be Temptation enough even to a wise Man and in some degree make him deserve Compassion if not Pardon It is remarkable that  Homer  does not paint him and  Helen  as some other Poets would have done like Monsters odious to Gods and Men but allows their Characters such esteemable Qualifications as could consist and in Truth generally do with tender Frailties He gives  Paris  several polite Accomplishments and in particular a Turn to those Sciences that are the Result of a fine Imagination He makes him have a Taste and Addiction to  curious Works  of all sorts which caus'd him to transport  Sidonian  Artists to  Troy  and employ himself at home in adorning and finishing his Armour And now we  are told that he assembled the most skilful Builders from all Parts of the Country to render his Palace a compleat Piece of  Architecture  This together with what  Homer  has said elsewhere of his Skill in the  Harp  which in those Days included both  Musick  and  Poetry  may I think establish him a  BelEsprit  and a  fine Genius  XXXIV  VERSE  Thy Hate to  Troy c  All the Commentators observe this Speech of  Hector  to be a Piece of Artifice he seems to imagine that the Retirement of  Paris  proceeds only from his Resentment against the  Trojans  and not from his Indolence Luxury or any other Cause  Plutarch  thus discourses upon it  "As a discreet Physician rather chuses to cure his Patient by Diet or Rest than by Castoreum or Scammony so a good Friend a good Master or a good Father are always better pleased to make use of Commendation than Reproof for the Reformation of Manners For nothing so much assists a Man who reprehends with Frankness and Liberty nothing renders him less offensive or better promotes his good Design than to reprove with Calmness Affection and Temper He ought not therefore to urge them too severely if they deny the Fact nor forestall their Justification of themselves but rather try to help them out and furnish them artificially with honest and colourable Pretences to excuse them and tho' he sees that their Fault proceeded from a more shameful Cause he should yet impute it to something less criminal Thus  Hector  deals with  Paris  when he tells him  This is not the time to manifest your Anger against the  Trojans As if his Retreat from the Battel had not been absolutely a Flight but merely the Effect of Resentment and Indignation  Plut  Of knowing a Flatterer from a Friend  juxta fin  XXXV  VERSE  Brother 'tis just  c  Paris  readily lays hold of the Pretext  Hector  had furnish'd him with and confesses  he has partly touch'd upon the true Reason of his Retreat but that it was also partly occasion'd by the Concern he felt at the Victory of his Rival Next he professes his Readiness for the Fight but nothing can be a finer Trait if we consider his Character than what  Homer  puts into his Mouth just in this Place that  he is now exhorted to it by  Helen which shews that not the Danger of his Country and Parents neither private Shame nor publick Hatred could so much prevail upon him as the Commands of his Mistress to go and recover his Honour  XXXVI  VERSE Helen  's Speech    The Repentance of  Helena  which we have before observed  Homer  never loses an Opportunity of manifesting is finely touch'd again here Upon the whole we see the Gods are always concern'd in what befalls an unfortunate Beauty Her Stars foredoom'd all the Mischief and Heaven was to blame in suffering her to live Then she fairly gets quit of the Infamy of her Lover and shews she has higher Sentiments of Honour than he How very natural is all this in the like Characters to this Day  XXXVII  VERSE  The Episode of  Hector  and  Andromache  Homer  undoubtedly shines most upon the great Subjects in raising our Admiration or Terror Pity and the softer Passions are not so much of the Nature of his Poem which is formed upon Anger and the Violence of Ambition But we have cause to think his Genius was no less capable of touching the Heart with Tenderness than of firing it with Glory from the few Sketches he has left us of his Excellency that way too In the present Episode of the Parting of  Hector  and  Andromache  he assembled all that Love Grief and Compassion could inspire The greatest Censurers of  Homer  have acknowledg'd themselves charm'd with this Part even Monsieur  Perault  translated it into  French  Verse as a kind of  Penitential Sacrifice for the Sacrileges he had committed against this Author  This Episode tends very much to raise the Character of  Hector  and endear him to every Reader This Hero tho' doubtful if he should ever see  Troy  again yet goes not to his Wife and Child till after he has taken care for the Sacrifice exhorted  Paris  to the Fight and discharg'd every Duty to the Gods and to his Country his Love of which as we formerly remark'd makes his chief Character What a beautiful Contraste has  Homer  made between the Manners of  Paris  and those of  Hector  as he here shews them one after the other in this domestic Light and in their Regards to the Fair Sex What a Difference between the Characters and Behaviour of  Helen  and of  Andromache  And what an amiable Picture of conjugal Love oppos'd to that of unlawful Passion  I must not forget that Mr  Dryden  has formerly translated this admirable Episode and with so much Success as to leave me at least no hopes of improving or equalling it The utmost I can pretend is to have avoided a few modern Phrases and Deviations from the Original which have escaped that great Man I am unwilling to remark upon an Author to whom every  English  Poet owes so much and shall therefore only take notice of a Criticism of his which I must be obliged to answer in its Place as it is an Accusation of  Homer  himself  XXXVIII  VERSE  Pensive she stood on  Ilion  's Tow'ry Height    It is a fine Imagination to represent the Tenderness of  Andromache  for  Hector  by her standing upon the Tower of  Troy  and watching all his Motions in the Field even the religious Office of the Procession to  Minerva  's Temple could not draw her from this Place at a time when she thought her Husband in danger  XXXIX  VERSE  Whose Virtue charm'd him  c  Homer  in  this Verse particularizes the Virtue of  Andromache  in the Epithet    blameless  or  without a Fault  I have used it literally in another Part of this Episode  XL  VERSE Hector  this heard return'd    Hector  does not stay to seek his Wife on the Tower of  Ilion  but hastens where the Business of the Field calls him  Homer  is never wanting in Point of Honour and Decency and while he constantly obeys the strictest Rules finds a way to make them contribute to the Beauty of his Poem Here for instance he has managed it so that this Observance of  Hector  's is the Cause of a very pleasing Surprize to the Reader for at first he is not a little disappointed to find that  Hector  does not meet  Andromache  and is no less pleased afterwards to see them encounter by chance which gives him a Satisfaction he thought he had lost  Dacier  XLI  VERSE Scamandrius  from  Scamander  's honour'd Stream  c  This manner of giving proper Names to Children derived from any Place Accident or Quality belonging to them or their Parents is very ancient and was customary among the  Hebrews  The  Trojans  call'd the Son of  Hector Astyanax  because as it is said here and at the end of the twenty second Book  his Father defended the City  There are many Instances of the same kind in the thirtieth Chapter of  Genesis  where the Names given to  Jacob  's Children and the Reasons of those Names are enumerated  XLII  VERSE  The fierce  Achilles c  Mr  Dryden  in the Preface to the third Volume of  Miscellany Poems  has past a Judgment upon Part of this Speech which is altogether unworthy of him  "  Andromache  says he in the midst of her Concernment and Fright for  Hector  runs off her Biass to tell him a Story  of her Pedigree and of the lamentable Death of her Father her Mother and her seven Brothers The Devil was in  Hector  if he knew not all this Matter as well as she who told it him for she had been his Bedfellow for many Years together and if he knew it then it must be confess'd that  Homer  in this long Digression has rather given us his own Character than that of the fair Lady whom he paints His dear Friends the Commentators who never fail him at a Pinch will needs excuse him by making the present Sorrow of  Andromache  to occasion the Remembrance of all the past But others think that she had enough to do with that Grief which now oppress'd her without running for Assistance to her Family"  But may not it be answer'd that nothing was more natural in  Andromache  than to recollect her past Calamities in order to represent her present Distress to  Hector  in a stronger Light and shew her utter Desertion if he should perish What could more effectually work upon a generous and tender Mind like that of  Hector  What could therefore be more proper to each of their Characters If  Hector  be induced to refrain from the Field it proceeds from Compassion to  Andromache  If  Andromache  endeavour to persuade him it proceeds from her Fear for the Life of  Hector Homer  had yet a farther View in this Recapitulation it tends to raise his chief Hero  Achilles  and acquaints us with those great Atchievements of his which preceded the Opening of the Poem Since there was a Necessity that this Hero should be absent from the Action during a great Part of the Iliad the Poet has shewn his Art in nothing more than the Methods he takes from time to time to keep up our great Idea of him and to awaken our Expectation of what he is to perform in the Progress of the Work His greatest Enemies cannot upbraid or complain of him but at the same time they confess his Glory and describe his Victories When  Apollo  encourages the  Trojans  to fight it is by telling them  Achilles  fights no more When  Juno  animates the  Greeks  it is by putting them in mind that they have to do with Enemies who durst not appear out of their Walls while  Achilles  engaged When  Andromache  trembles for  Hector  it is with Remembrance of the resistless Force  of  Achilles  And when  Agamemnon  would bribe him to a Reconciliation it is partly with those very Treasures and Spoils which had been won by  Achilles  himself  XLIII  VERSE  His Arms preserv'd from hostile Spoil    This Circumstance of  Aetion  's being burned with his Arms will not appear trivial in this Relation when we reflect with what eager Passion these ancient Heroes fought to spoil and carry off the Armour of a vanquish'd Enemy and therefore this Action of  Achilles  is mention'd as an Instance of uncommon Favour and Generosity Thus  Aeneas  in  Virgil  having slain  Lausus  and being mov'd with Compassion for this unhappy Youth gives him a Promise of the like Favour  Arma quibus laetatus habe tua teque parentum  Manibus cineri si qua est ea cura remitto  XLIV  VERSE Joves  's Sylvan Daughters bade their Elms bestow A barren Shade  c  It was the Custom to plant about Tombs only such Trees as Elms Alders  c  that bear no Fruit as being most suitable to the Dead This Passage alludes to that Piece of Antiquity  XLV  VERSE  A Victim to  Diana  's Bow    The  Greeks  ascribed all sudden Deaths of Women to  Diana  So  Ulysses  in  Odyss  asks  Antyclia  among the Shades if she died by the Darts of  Diana  And in the present Book  Laodame  the Daughter of  Bellerophon  is said to have perish'd young by the Arrows of this Goddess Or perhaps it may allude to some Disease fatal to Women such as  Macrobius  speaks of  Sat    Foeminas certis afflictas morbis  vocant  XLVI  VERSE  That Quarter mostWhere yon' wild Figtrees    The Artifice  Andromache  here uses to detain  Hector  in  Troy  is very beautifully imagined She takes occasion from the three Attacks that had been made by the Enemy upon this Place to give him an honourable Pretence for staying at that Rampart to defend it If we consider that those Attempts must have been known to all in the City we shall not think she talks like a Soldier but like a Woman who naturally enough makes use of any Incident that offers to persuade her Lover to what she desires The Ignorance too which she expresses of the Reasons that mov'd the  Greeks  to attack this particular Place was what I doubt not  Homer  intended to reconcile it the more to a Female Character  XLVII  VERSE Hyperia  's Spring    Drawing Water was the Office of the meanest Slaves This appears by the holy Scripture where the  Gibeonites  who had deceiv'd  Josuah  are made Slaves and subjected to draw Water  Josuah  pronounces the Curse against them in these Words  Now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being Bondmen and Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water  Josh Ch V  Dacier  XLVIII  VERSE  Stretch'd his fond Arms    There never was a finer Piece of Painting than this  Hector  extends his Arms to embrace his Child the Child affrighted at the glittering of his Helmet and the shaking of the Plume shrinks backward to the Breast of his Nurse  Hector  unbraces his Helmet lays it on the Ground takes the Infant in his Arms lifts him towards Heaven and offers a Prayer for him to the Gods then returns him to the Mother  Andromache  who receives him with a Smile of Pleasure but at the same  instant the Fears for her Husband make her burst into Tears All these are but small Circumstances but so artfully chosen that every Reader immediately feels the force of them and represents the whole in the utmost Liveliness to his Imagination This alone might be a Confutation of that false Criticism some have fallen into who affirm that a Poet ought only to collect the great and noble Particulars in his Paintings But it is in the Images of Things as in the Characters of Persons where a small Action or even a small Circumstance of an Action lets us more into the Knowledge and Comprehension of them than the material and principal Parts themselves As we find this in a History so we do in a Picture where sometimes a small Motion or Turning of a Finger will express the Character and Action of the Figure more than all the other Parts of the Design  Longinus  indeed blames an Author's insisting too much on trivial Circumstances but in the same Place extols  Homer  as  "the Poet who best knew how to make use of important and beautiful Circumstances and to avoid the mean and superfluous ones"  There is a vast difference betwixt a  small  Circumstance and a  trivial  one and the smallest become important if they are well chosen and not confused  XLIX  VERSE Hector  's Prayer for his Son    It may be asked how  Hector  's Prayer that his Son might protect the  Trojans  could be consistent with what he had said just before that he certainly knew  Troy  and his Parents would perish We ought to reflect that this is only a Prayer  Hector  in the Excess of a tender Emotion for his Son entreats the Gods to preserve  Troy  and permit  Astyanax  to rule there It is at all times allowable to beseech Heaven to appease its Anger and change its Decrees and we are taught that Prayers can alter Destiny  Dacier  Besides it cannot be infer'd from hence that  Hector  had any divine Foreknowledge of his own Fate and the approaching Ruine of his Country since in many following Passages we find him possess'd with strong Hopes and firm Assurances to raise the Siege by the Flight or Destruction  of the  Greeks  So that these Forebodings of his Fate were only the Apprehensions and Misgivings of a Soul dejected with Sorrow and Compassion by considering the great Dangers to which he saw all that was dear to him expos'd  L  VERSE  Transcends his Father's Fame    The Commendation  Hector  here gives himself is not only agreeable to the Openness of a brave Man but very becoming on such a solemn Occasion and a natural Effect from the Testimony of his own Heart to his Honour at this time especially when he knew not but he was speaking his last Words  Virgil  has not scrupled it in what he makes  Aeneas  say to  Ascanius  at his Parting for the Battel  Et pater Aeneas avunculus excitet Hector  Disce puer virtutem ex me verumque laborem  Fortunam ex aliis  Aen  I believe he had this of  Homer  in his Eye tho' the pathetical mention of  Fortune  in the last Line seems an Imitation of that Prayer of  Sophocles  copied also from hence where  Ajax  wishes his Son may be  like him in all things but in his Misfortunes  LI  VERSE  His Mother's conscious Heart    Tho' the chief Beauty of this Prayer consists in the paternal Piety shewn by  Hector  yet it wants not a fine Stroake at the end to continue him in the Character of a tender Lover of his Wife when he makes one of the Motives of his Wish to be the Joy she shall receive on hearing her Son applauded  LII  VERSE  Fix'd is the Term    The Reason which  Hector  here urges to allay the Affliction of his Wife is grounded on  a very ancient and common Opinion that the fatal Period of Life is appointed to all Men at the time of their Birth which as no Precaution can avoid so no Danger can hasten This Sentiment is as proper to give Comfort to the distress'd as to inspire Courage to the desponding since nothing is so fit to quiet and strengthen our Minds in Times of Difficulty as a firm Assurance that our Lives are expos'd to no real Hazards in the greatest Appearances of Danger  LIII  VERSE  Forth issues  Paris  Paris  stung by the Reproaches of  Hector  goes to the Battel 'Tis a just Remark of  Eustathius  that all the Reproofs and Remonstrances made in  Homer  have constantly their Effect The Poet by this shews the great Use of Reprehensions when properly apply'd and finely intimates that every worthy Mind will be the better for them  LIV  VERSE  The wanton Courser thus  c  This beautiful Comparison being translated by  Virgil  in the eleventh  Aeneid  I shall transcribe the Originals that the Reader may have the Pleasure of comparing them  Qualis ubi abruptis fugit praesepia vinclis  Tandem liber equus campoque potitus aperto  Aut ille in pastus armentaque tendit equarum  Aut assuetus aquae perfundi flumine noto  Emicat arrectisque fremit cervicibus alte  Luxurians luduntque jubae per colla per armos  Tho' nothing can be translated better than this is by  Virgil  yet in  Homer  the Simile seems more perfect and the Place more proper  Paris  had been indulging his Ease within the Walls of his Palace as the Horse in his Stable which was not the Case of  Turnus  The Beauty and Wantonness of the Steed agrees more exactly with the Character of  Paris  than with the other And the Insinuation of his Love of the Mares has yet a nearer Resemblance The languishing Flow of that Verse  finely corresponds with the Ease and Luxuriancy of the pamper'd Courser bathing in the Flood a Beauty which  Scaliger  did not consider when he criticis'd particularly upon that Line  Tasso  has also imitated this Simile  Cant    Come destrier che da la regie stalle  Ove a l'uso de l'arme si reserba  Fugge e libero alfin per largo calle  V√† tr√¢ gl'armenti √≤ al fiume usato √≤ a l'erba  Scherzau s√π 'l collo i crini e s√π le spalle  Si scote la cervice alta e superba  Suonano i pi√® nel corso e par ch'auvampi  Di sonori nitriti empiendo i campi  LV  VERSE Paris  excus'd his Stay    Here in the Original is a short Speech of  Paris  containing only these Words  Brother I have detained you too long and should have come sooner as you desired me  This and some few others of the same Nature in the Iliad the Translator has ventured to omit expressing only the Sense of them A living Author whom future Times will quote and therefore I shall not scruple to do it says that these short Speeches tho' they may be natural in other Languages can't appear so well in ours which is much more stubborn and unpliant and therefore are but as  so many Rubs in the Story that are still turning the Narration out of its proper Course  LVI  VERSE  Known is thy Courage  c  Hector  here confesses the natural Valour of  Paris  but observes it to be overcome by the Indolence of his Temper and the Love of Pleasure An ingenious  French  Writer very well remarks that the true Character of this Hero has a great Resemblance with that of  Marc Anthony  See the  th  and  th  Notes on the third Book  LVII  VERSE  We crown the Bowl to Heav'n and Liberty    The  Greek  is    the free Bowl  in which they made Libations to  Jupiter  after the Recovery of their Liberty The Expression is observed by M  Dacier  to resemble those of the  Hebrews The Cup of Salvation the Cup of Sorrow the Cup of Benediction  c  Athenaeus  mentions those Cups which the  Greeks  call'd  and were consecrated to the Gods in Memory of some Success He gives us the Inscription of one of this sort which was    THE SEVENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The single Combate of  Hector  and  Ajax  THE Battel renewing with double Ardour upon the Return of  Hector Minerva  is under Apprehensions for the  Greeks Apollo  seeing her descend from  Olympus  joins her near the  Scaean  Gate They agree to put off the general Engagement for that Day and incite  Hector  to challenge the  Greeks  to a single Combate Nine of the Princes accepting the Challenge the Lot is cast and falls upon  Ajax  These Heroes after several Attacks are parted by the Night The  Trojans  calling a Council  Antenor  proposes the Delivery of  Helen  to the  Greeks  to which  Paris  will not consent but offers to restore them her Riches  Priam  sends a Herald to make this Offer and to demand a Truce for burning the Dead the last of which only is agreed to by  Agamemnon  When the Funerals are performed the  Greeks  pursuant to the Advice of  Nestor  erect a Fortification to protect their Fleet and Camp flank'd with Towers and defended by a Ditch and Palisades  Neptune  testifies his Jealousy at this Work but is pacified by a Promise from  Jupiter  Both Armies pass the Night in Feasting but  Jupiter  disheartens the  Trojans  with Thunder and other Signs of his Wrath  The three and twentieth Day ends with the Duel of  Hector  and  Ajax  The next Day the Truce is agreed Another is taken up in the Funeral Rites of the Slain and one more in building the Fortification before the Ships So that somewhat above three Days is employed in this Book The  Scene  lies wholly in the Field  THE SEVENTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  SO spoke the Guardian of the  Trojan  State  Then rush'd impetuous thro' the  Scaean  Gate  Him  Paris  follow'd to the dire Alarms  Both breathing Slaughter both resolv'd in Arms  As when to Sailors lab'ring thro' the Main  That long had heav'd the weary Oar in vain  Jove  bids at length th' expected Gales arise  The Gales blow grateful and the Vessel flies  So welcome these to  Troy  's desiring Train  The Bands are chear'd the War awakes again  Bold  Paris  first the Work of Death begun  On great  Menesthius Are√Øthous'  Son  Sprung from the fair  Philomeda  's Embrace  The pleasing  Arn√®  was his

Glaucus'  Spear the bold  Iphinous  bleeds  Fix'd in the Shoulder as he mounts his Steeds  Headlong he tumbles His slack Nerves unbound  Drop the cold useless Members on the Ground  When now  Minerva  saw her  Argives  slain  From vast  Olympus  to the gleaming Plain  Fierce she descends  Apollo  mark'd her Flight  Nor shot less swift from  Ilion  's Tow'ry Height  Radiant they met beneath the Beechen Shade  When thus  Apollo  to the blueey'd Maid  What cause O Daughter of Almighty  Jove  Thus wings thy Progress from the Realms above  Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way  To give to  Greece  the longdivided Day  Too much has  Troy  already felt thy Hate  Now breathe thy Rage and hush the stern Debate  This Day the Business of the Field suspend  War soon shall kindle and great  Ilion  bend  Since vengeful Goddesses confed'rate join  To raze her Walls tho' built by Hands Divine  To whom the Progeny of  Jove  replies  I left for this the Council of the Skies  But who shall bid conflicting Hosts forbear  What Art shall calm the furious Sons of War  To her the God Great  Hector  's Soul incite  To dare the boldest  Greek  to single Fight  Till  Greece  provok'd from all her

Dictates of his sacred Breast  O Son of  Priam  let thy faithful Ear  Receive my Words thy Friend and Brother hear  Go forth persuasive and a while engage  The warring Nations to suspend their Rage  Then dare the boldest of the hostile Train  To mortal Combate on the listed Plain  For not this Day shall end thy glorious Date  The Gods have spoke it and their Voice is Fate  He said The Warrior heard the Word with Joy  Then with his Spear restrain'd the Youth of  Troy  Held by the midst athwart On either Hand  The Squadrons part th' expecting  Trojans  stand  Great  Agamemnon  bids the  Greeks  forbear  They breathe and hush the Tumult of the War  Th'  Athenian  Maid and glorious God of Day  With silent Joy the settling Hosts survey  In Form like Vulturs on the Beeche's Height  They

curling the wide wat'ry Plain  The Waves scarce heave the Face of Ocean sleeps  And a still Horror saddens all the Deeps  Thus in thick Orders settling wide around  At length compos'd they sit and

Grimly he smil'd Earth trembled as he strode  His massy Javelin quiv'ring in his Hand  He stood the Bulwark of the  Grecian  Band  Thro' ev'ry  Argive  Heart new Transport ran  All  Troy  stood

Fight  O Son of  Telamon  thy Country's Pride  To  Ajax  thus the  Trojan  Prince reply'd  Me as a Boy or Woman would'st thou fright  New to the Field and trembling at the Fight  Thou meet'st a Chief deserving of thy Arms  To Combate born and bred amidst Alarms  I know to shift my Ground remount the Car  Turn charge and answer ev'ry Call of War  To right to left the dext'rous Lance I wield  And bear thick Battel on my sounding Shield  But open be our Fight and bold each Blow  I steal no Conquest from a noble Foe  He said and rising high above the Field  Whirl'd the long Lance against the sev'nfold Shield  Full on the Brass descending from above  Thro' six Bullhides the furious Weapon drove  Till in the sev'nth it fix'd Then  Ajax  threw  Thro'  Hector  's Shield the forceful Javelin flew  His Corslet enters and his Garment rends  And glancing downwards near his Flank descends  The wary  Trojan  shrinks and bending low  Beneath his Buckler disappoints the Blow  From their bor'd Shields the Chiefs the Javelins drew  Then close impetuous and the Charge renew  Fierce as the MountainLions bath'd in Blood  Or foaming Boars the Terror of the Wood  At  Ajax Hector  his long Lance extends  The blunted Point against the Buckler bends  But  Ajax  watchful as his Foe drew near  Drove thro' the  Trojan  Targe the knotty Spear  It reach'd his Neck with matchless Strength impell'd  Spouts the black Gore and dimms his shining Shield  Yet ceas'd not  Hector  thus but stooping down  In his strong Hand upheav'd a flinty Stone  Black craggy vast To this his Force he bends  Full on the Brazen Boss the Stone descends  The hollow Brass resounded with the Shock  Then  Ajax  seiz'd the Fragment of a Rock  Apply'd each Nerve and swinging round on high  With Force tempestuous let the Ruin fly  The huge Stone thund'ring thro' his Buckler broke  His slacken'd Knees receiv'd the numbing Stroke  Great  Hector  falls extended on the Field  His Bulk supporting on the shatter'd Shield  Nor wanted heav'nly Aid  Apollo  's Might  Confirm'd his Sinews and restor'd to Fight  And now both Heroes their broad Faulchions drew  In flaming Circles round their Heads they flew  But then by Heralds Voice the Word was giv'n  The sacred Ministers of Earth and Heav'n  Divine  Talthybius  whom the  Greeks  employ  And sage  Idaeus  on the Part of  Troy  Between the Swords their peaceful Sceptres rear'd  When thus  Idaeus'  awful Voice was heard  Forbear my Sons your farther Force to prove  Both dear to Men and both belov'd of  Jove  To either Host your matchless Worth is known  Each sounds your Praise and War is all your own  But now the Night extends her awful Shade  The Goddess parts you Be the Night obey'd  To whom great  Ajax  his high Soul express'd  O Sage to  Hector  be these Words address'd  Let him who first provok'd our Chiefs to fight  Let him demand the Sanction of the Night  If first he ask it I content obey  And cease the Strife when  Hector  shows the way  Oh first of  Greeks  his noble Foe rejoin'd  Whom Heav'n adorns superior to thy Kind  With Strength of Body and with Worth of Mind  Now Martial Law commands us to forbear  Hereafter we shall meet in glorious War  Some future Day shall lengthen out the Strife  And let the Gods decide of Death or Life  Since then the Night extends her gloomy Shade  And Heav'n enjoins it be the Night obey'd  Return brave  Ajax  to thy  Grecian  Friends  And joy the Nations whom thy Arm defends  As I shall glad each Chief and  Trojan  Wife  Who wearies Heav'n with Vows for  Hector  's Life  But let us on this memorable Day  Exchange some Gift that  Greece  and  Troy  may say  "Not Hate but Glory made these Chiefs contend  "And each brave Foe was in his Soul a Friend  With that a Sword with Stars of Silver grac'd  The Baldric studded and the Sheath enchas'd  He gave the  Greek  The gen'rous  Greek  bestow'd  A radiant Belt that rich with Purple glow'd  Then with majestic Grace they quit the Plain  This seeks the  Grecian  that the  Phrygian  Train  The  Trojan  Bands returning  Hector  wait  And hail with Joy the Champion of their State  Escap'd great  Ajax  they survey'd him round  Alive unharm'd and vig'rous from his Wound  To  Troy  's high Gates the Godlike Chief they bear  Their present Triumph as their late Despair  But  Ajax  glorying in his hardy Deed  The wellarm'd  Greeks  to  Agamemnon  lead  A Steer for Sacrifice the King design'd  Of full five Years and of the nobler Kind  The Victim falls they strip the smoaking Hide  The Beast they quarter and the Joints divide  Then spread the Tables the Repast prepare  Each takes his Seat and each receives his Share  The King himself an Honorary Sign  Before great  Ajax  plac'd the mighty Chine  When now the Rage of Hunger was remov'd  Nestor  in each persuasive Art approv'd  The Sage whose Counsels long had sway'd the rest  In Words like these his prudent Thought exprest  How dear O Kings this fatal Day has cost  What  Greeks  are perish'd what a People lost  What Tides of Blood have drench'd  Scamander  's Shore  What Crowds of Heroes sunk to rise no more  Then hear me Chief nor let the Morrow's Light  Awake thy Squadrons to new Toils of Fight  Some Space at least permit the War to breathe  While we to Flames our slaughter'd Friends bequeathe  From the red Field their scatter'd Bodies bear  And nigh the Fleet a Fun'ral Structure rear  So decent Urns their snowy Bones may keep  And pious Children o'er their Ashes weep  Here where on one promiscuous Pile they blaz'd  High o'er them all a gen'ral Tomb be rais'd  Next to secure our Camp and Naval Pow'rs  Raise an embattel'd Wall with lofty Tow'rs  From Space to Space be ample Gates around  For passing Chariots and a Trench profound  So  Greece  to Combate shall in Safety go  Nor fear the fierce Incursions of the Foe  'Twas thus the Sage his wholsome Counsel mov'd  The sceptred Kings of  Greece  his Words approv'd  Meanwhile conven'd at  Priam  's Palace Gate  The  Trojan  Peers in nightly Council sate  A Senate void of Union as of Choice  Their Hearts were fearful and confus'd their Voice  Antenor  rising thus demands their Ear  Ye  Trojans Dardans  and Auxiliars hear  'Tis Heav'n the Counsel of my Breast inspires  And I but move what ev'ry God requires  Let  Sparta  's Treasures be this Hour restor'd  And  Argive Helen  own her ancient Lord  The Ties of Faith the sworn Alliance broke  Our impious Battels the just Gods provoke  As this Advice ye practise or reject  So hope Success or dread the dire Effect  The Senior spoke and sate To whom reply'd  The graceful Husband of the  Spartan  Bride  Cold Counsels  Trojan  may become thy Years  But sound ungrateful in a Warrior's Ears  Old Man if void of Fallacy or Art  Thy Words express the Purpose of thy Heart  Thou in thy Time more sound Advice hast giv'n  But Wisdom has its Date assign'd by Heav'n  Then hear me Princes of the  Trojan  Name  Their Treasures I'll restore but not the Dame  My Treasures too for Peace I will resign  But be this bright Possession ever mine  'Twas then the growing Discord to compose  Slow from his Seat the rev'rend  Priam  rose  His Godlike Aspect deep Attention drew  He paus'd and these pacific Words ensue  Ye  Trojans Dardans  and Auxiliar Bands  Now take Refreshment as the Hour demands  Guard well the Walls relieve the Watch of Night  Till the new Sun restores the chearful Light  Then shall our Herald to th'  Atrides  sent  Before their Ships proclaim my Son's Intent  Next let a Truce be ask'd that  Troy  may burn  Her slaughter'd Heroes and their Bones inurn  That done once more the Fate of War be try'd  And whose the Conquest mighty  Jove  decide  The Monarch spoke the Warriors snatch'd with haste  Each at his Post in Arms a short Repaste  Soon as the rosy Morn had wak'd the Day  To the black Ships  Idaeus  bent his way  There to the Sons of  Mars  in Council found  He rais'd his Voice The Hosts stood list'ning round  Ye Sons of  Atreus  and ye  Greeks  give ear  The Words of  Troy  and  Troy  's great Monarch hear  Pleas'd may ye hear so Heav'n succeed my Pray'rs  What  Paris  Author of the War declares  The Spoils and Treasures he to  Ilion  bore  Oh had he perish'd e'er they touch'd our Shore  He proffers injur'd  Greece  with large Encrease  Of added  Trojan  Wealth to buy the Peace  But to restore the beauteous Bride again  This  Greece  demands and  Troy  requests in vain  Next O ye Chiefs we ask a Truce to burn  Our slaughter'd Heroes and their Bones inurn  That done once more the Fate of War be try'd  And whose the Conquest mighty  Jove  decide  The  Greeks  gave ear but none the Silence broke  At length  Tydides  rose and rising spoke  Oh take not Friends defrauded of your Fame  Their proffer'd Wealth nor ev'n the  Spartan  Dame  Let Conquest make them ours Fate shakes their Wall  And  Troy  already totters to her Fall  Th' admiring Chiefs and all the  Grecian  Name  With gen'ral Shouts return'd him loud Acclaim  Then thus the King of Kings rejects the Peace  Herald in him thou hear'st the Voice of  Greece  For what remains let Fun'ral Flames be fed  With Heroes Corps I war not with the Dead  Go search your slaughter'd Chiefs on yonder Plain  And gratify the  Manes  of the slain  Be witness  Jove  whose Thunder rolls on high  He said and rear'd his Sceptre to the Sky  To sacred  Troy  where all her Princes lay  To wait th' Event the Herald bent his way  He came and standing in the midst explain'd  The Peace rejected but the Truce obtain'd  Strait to their sev'ral Cares the  Trojans  move  Some search the Plain some fell the sounding Grove  Nor less the  Greeks  descending on the Shore  Hew'd the green Forests and the Bodies bore  And now from forth the Chambers of the Main  To shed his sacred Light on Earth again  Arose the golden Chariot of the Day  And tipt the Mountains with a purple Ray  In mingled Throngs the  Greek  and  Trojan  Train  Thro' Heaps of Carnage search'd the mournful Plain  Scarce could the Friend his slaughter'd Friend explore  With Dust dishonour'd and deform'd with Gore  The Wounds they wash'd their pious Tears they shed  And lay'd along their Cars deplor'd the dead  Sage  Priam  check'd their Grief With silent Haste  The Bodies decent on the Piles were plac'd  With melting Hearts the cold Remains they burn'd  And sadly slow to sacred  Troy  return'd  Nor less the  Greeks  their pious Sorrows shed  And decent on the Pile dispose the dead  The cold Remains consume with equal Care  And slowly sadly to their Fleet repair  Now e're the Morn had streak'd with red'ning Light  The doubtful Confines of the Day and Night  About the dying Flames the  Greeks  appear'd  And round the Pile a gen'ral Tomb they rear'd  Then to secure the Camp and Naval Pow'rs  They rais'd embattel'd Walls with lofty Tow'rs  From Space to Space were ample Gates around  For passing Chariots and a Trench profound  Of large Extent and deep in Earth below  Strong Piles infix'd stood adverse to the Foe  So toil'd the  Greeks  Meanwhile the Gods above  In shining Circle round their Father  Jove  Amaz'd beheld the wondrous Works of Man  Then * He whose Trident shakes the Earth began  What Mortals henceforth shall our Pow'r adore  Our Fanes frequent our Oracles implore  If the proud  Grecians  thus successful boast  Their rising Bulwarks on the Seabeat Coast  See the long Walls extending to the Main  No God consulted and no Victim slain  Their Fame shall fill the World's remotest Ends  Wide as the Morn her golden Beam extends  While old  La√∂medon  's divine Abodes  Those radiant Structures rais'd by lab'ring Gods  Shall raz'd and lost in long Oblivion sleep  Thus spoke the hoary Monarch of the Deep  Th' Almighty Thund'rer with a Frown replies  That clouds the World and blackens half the Skies  Strong God of Ocean Thou whose Rage can make  The solid Earth's eternal Basis shake  What Cause of Fear from mortal Works cou'd move  The meanest Subject of our Realms above  Wheree'er the Sun's refulgent Rays are cast  Thy Pow'r is honour'd and thy Fame shall last  But yon' proud Work no future Age shall view  No Trace remain where once the Glory grew  The sapp'd Foundations by thy Force shall fall  And whelm'd beneath thy Waves drop the huge Wall  Vast Drifts of Sand shall change the former Shore  The Ruin vanish'd and the Name no more  Thus they in Heav'n while o'er the  Grecian  Train  The rolling Sun descending to the Main  Beheld the finish'd Work Their Bulls they slew  Black from the Tents the sav'ry Vapors flew  And now the Fleet arriv'd from  Lemnos'  Strands  With  Bacchus'  Blessings chear'd the gen'rous Bands  Of fragrant Wines the rich  Eunaeus  sent  A thousand Measures to the Royal Tent    Eunaeus  whom  Hypsipyle  of yore  To  Jason  Shepherd of his People bore  The rest they purchas'd at their proper Cost  And well the plenteous Freight supply'd the Host  Each in exchange proportion'd Treasures gave  Some Brass or Iron some an Oxe or Slave  All Night they feast the  Greek  and  Trojan  Pow'rs  Those on the Fields and these within their Tow'rs  But  Jove  averse the Signs of Wrath display'd  And shot red Light'nings thro' the gloomy Shade  Humbled they stood pale Horror seiz'd on all  While the deep Thunder shook th' Aerial Hall  Each pour'd to  Jove  before the Bowl was crown'd  And large Libations drench'd the thirsty Ground  Then late refresh'd with Sleep from Toils of Fight  Enjoy'd the balmy Blessings of the Night  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Seventh Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE SEVENTH BOOK  I  VERSE  THRO' the  Scaean  Gate    This Gate is not here particularized by  Homer  but it appears by the d Verse of the sixth Book that it could be no other  Eustathius  takes notice of the Difference of the Words  and  the one apply'd to  Hector  the other to  Paris  by which the Motion of the former is described as an impetuous sallying forth agreeable to the Violence of a Warrior and that of the latter as a calmer Movement correspondent to the gentler Character of a Lover But perhaps this Remark is too refined since  Homer  plainly gives  Paris  a Character of Bravery in what immediately precedes and follows this Verse  II  VERSE  As when to Sailors  c  This Simile makes it plain that the Battel had relax'd during the Absence of  Hector  in  Troy  and consequently that the Conversation of  Diomed  and  Glaucus  in the former Book was not as  Homer  's Censurers would have it in the Heat of the Engagement  III  VERSE  When now  Minerva c  This Machine of the two Deities meeting to part the Armies is very noble  Eustathius  tells us it is an allegorical  Minerva  and  Apollo Minerva  represents the prudent Valour of the  Greeks  and  Apollo  who stood for the  Trojans  the Power of Destiny So that the Meaning of the Allegory may be that the Valour and Wisdom of the  Greeks  had now conquer'd  Troy  had not Destiny withstood  Minerva  therefore complies with  Apollo  an Intimation that Wisdom can never oppose Fate But if you take them in the literal Sense as a real God and Goddess it may be ask'd what Necessity there was for the Introduction of two such Deities To this  Eustathius  answers that the last Book was the only one in which both Armies were destitute of the Aid of the Gods In Consequence of which there is no gallant Action atchiev'd nothing extraordinary done especially after the Retreat of  Hector  but here the Gods are again introduced to usher in a new Scene of great Actions The same Author offers this other Solution  Hector  finding the  Trojan  Army overpower'd considers how to stop the Fury of rhe present Battel this he thinks may best be done by the Proposal of a single Combate Thus  Minerva  by a very easy and natural Fiction may signify that Wisdom or Courage she being the Goddess of both which suggests the Necessity of diverting the War and  Apollo  that seasonable Stratagem by which he effected it  IV  VERSE  Vengesul Goddesses    in this Place must signify  Minerva  and  Juno  the Word being of the feminine Gender  Eustathius  V  VERSE  Sage  Helenus  their sacred Counsels knew    Helenus  was the Priest of  Apollo  and might therefore be suppos'd  to be informed of this by his God or taught by an Oracle that such was his Will Or else being an  Augur  he might learn it from the Flight of those Birds into which the Deities are here feigned to transform themselves perhaps for that Reason as it would be a very Poetical manner of expressing it The Fiction of these Divinities sitting on the BeechTree in the Shape of  Vulturs  is imitated by  Milton  in the fourth Book of  Paradise Lost  where  Satan  leaping over the Boundaries of  Eden  sits in the Form of a Cormorant upon the Tree of Life  VI  VERSE  For not this Day shall end thy glorious Date    Eustathius  justly observes that  Homer  here takes from the Greatness of  Hector  's Intrepidity by making him foreknow that he should not fall in this Combate whereas  Ajax  encounters him without any such Encouragement It may perhaps be difficult to give a Reason for this Management of the Poet unless we ascribe it to that commendable Prejudice and honourable Partiality he bears his Countrymen which makes him give a Superiority of Courage to the Heroes of his own Nation  VII  VERSE  Then with his Spear restrain'd the Youth of  Troy  Held by the midst athwart    The Remark of  Eustathius  here is observable He tells us that the Warriors of those Times having no Trumpets and because the Voice of the loudest Herald would be drown'd in the Noise of a Battel address'd themselves to the Eyes and that grasping the middle of the Spear denoted a Request that the Fight might a while be suspended the holding the Spear in that Position not being the Posture of a Warrior and thus  Agamemnon  understands it without any farther Explication But however it be we have a lively Picture of a General who stretches his Spear across and presses back the most advanced Soldiers of his Army  VIII  VERSE  As when a gen'ral Darkness  c  The thick Ranks of the Troops composing themselves in order to sit and hear what  Hector  was about to propose are compared to the Waves of the Sea that are just stirr'd by the  West  Wind the Simile partly consisting in the Darkness and Stillness This is plainly different from those Images of the Sea given us on other Occasions where the Armies in their Engagement and Confusion are compared to the Waves in their Agitation and Tumult And that the contrary is the Drift of this Simile appears particularly from  Homer  's using the Word    sedebant  twice in the Application of it All the other Versions seem to be mistaken here What caused the Difficulty was the Expression  which may signify the  West  Wind  blowing on a sudden  as well as  first rising  But the Design of  Homer  was to convey an Image both of the gentle Motion that arose over the Field from the Helmets and Spears before their Armies were quite settled and of the Repose and Awe which ensued when  Hector  began to speak  IX  VERSE  Hear all ye  Trojan  all ye  Grecian  Bands    The Appearance of  Hector  his formal Challenge and the Affright of the  Greeks  upon it have a near Resemblance to the Description of the Challenge of  Goliah  in the first Book of  Samuel  Ch  And he stood and cried to the Armies of  Israel  Chuse you a Man for you and let him come down to me If he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your Servants but if I prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our ServantsWhen  Saul  and all  Israel  heard the Words of the  Philistinc  they were dismayed and greatly afraid  c  There is a fine Air of Gallantry and Bravery in this Challenge of  Hector  If he seems to speak too vainly we should consider him under the Character of a Challenger whose Business it is to defy the Enemy Yet at the same time we  find a decent Modesty in his manner of expressing the Conditions of the Combate He says simply  If my Enemy kills me  but of himself  If  Apollo  grant me Victory  It was an Imagination equally agreeable to a Man of Generosity and a Lover of Glory to mention the Monument to be erected over his vanquish'd Enemy tho' we see he considers it not so much an Honour paid to the Conquer'd as a Trophie to the Conqueror It was natural too to dwell most upon the Thought that pleas'd him best for he takes no notice of any Monument that should be raised over himself if he should fall unfortunately He no sooner allows himself to expatiate but the Prospect of Glory carries him away thus far beyond his first Intention which was only to allow the Enemy liberty to inter their Champion with Decency  X  VERSE  On  Phoebus'  Temple I'll his Arms bestow    It was the Manner of the Ancients to dedicate Trophies of this kind to the Temples of the Gods The particular Reason for consecrating the Arms in this Place to  Apollo  is not only as he was the constant Protector of  Troy  but as this Thought of the Challenge was inspired by him  XI  VERSE Greece  on the Shore shall raise a Monument    Homer  took the Hint of this from several Tombs of the ancient Heroes who had fought at  Troy  remaining in his time upon the Shore of the  Hellespont  He gives that Sea the Epithet  broad  to distinguish the particular Place of those Tombs which was on the  Rhoetean  or  Sigaean  Coast where the  Hellespont  which in other Parts is narrow opens itself to the  Aegean  Sea  Strabo  gives an Account of the Monument of  Ajax  near  Rhoeteum  and of  Achilles  at the Promontory of  Sigaeum  This is one among a thousand Proofs of our Author's exact Knowledge in Geography and Antiquities Time says  Eustathius  has destroy'd those Tombs which were to have preserv'd  Hector  's Glory but  Homer  's Poetry more  lasting than Monuments and Proof against Ages will for ever support and convey it to the latest Posterity  XII  VERSE  All  Greece  astonish'd heard    It seems natural to enquire why the  Greeks  before they accepted  Hector  's Challenge did not demand Reparation for the former Treachery of  Pandarus  and insist upon delivering up the Author of it which had been the shortest way for the  Trojans  to have wip'd off that Stain It was very reasonable for the  Greeks  to reply to this Challenge that they could not venture a second single Combate for fear of such another insidious Attempt upon their Champion And indeed I wonder that  Nestor  did not think of this Excuse for his Countrymen when they were so backward to engage One may make some sort of answer to this if we consider the Clearness of  Hector  's Character and his Words at the beginning of the foregoing Speech where he first complains of the Revival of the War as a Misfortune common to them both which is at once very artful and decent and lays the blame of it upon  Jupiter  Tho' by the way his charging the  Trojans  Breach of Faith upon the Deity looks a little like the reasoning of some modern Saints in the Doctrine of absolute Reprobation making God the Author of Sin and may serve for some Instance of the Antiquity of that false Tenet  XIII  VERSE  Women of  Greece c  There is a great deal of Fire in this Speech of  Menelaus  which very well agrees with his Character and Circumstances Methinks while he speaks one sees him in a Posture of Emotion pointing with Contempt at the Commanders about him He upbraids their Cowardice and wishes they may become according to the literal Words  Earth and Water  that is be resolved into those Principles they sprung from or die Thus  Eustathius  explains it very exactly from a Verse he cites of  Zenophanes  XIV  VERSE  Ev'n fierce  Achilles  learn'd his Force to fear    The Poet every where takes occasion to set the brotherly Love of  Agamemnon  toward  Menelaus  in the most agreeable Light When  Menelaus  is wounded  Agamemnon  is more concern'd than He and here dissuades him from a Danger which he offers immediately after to undertake himself He makes use of  Hector  's superior Courage to bring him to a Compliance and tells him that even  Achilles  dares not engage with  Hector  This says  Eustathius  is not true but only the Affection for his Brother thus breaks out into a kind Extravagance  Agamemnon  likewise consults the Honour of  Menelaus  for it will be no Disgrace to him to decline encountering a Man whom  Achilles  himself is afraid of Thus he artfully provides for his Safety and Honour at the same time  XV  VERSE  The mightiest Warrior  c  It cannot with Certainty be concluded from the Words of  Homer  who is the Person to whom  Agamemnon  applies the last Lines of this Speech the Interpreters leave it as undetermin'd in their Translations as it is in the Original Some would have it understood of  Hector  that the  Greeks  would send such an Antagonist against him from whose Hands  Hector  might be glad to escape But this Interpretation seems contrary to the plain Design of  Agamemnon  's Discourse which only aims to deter his Brother from so rash an Undertaking as engaging with  Hector  So that instead of dropping any Expression which might depreciate the Power or Courage of this Hero he endeavours rather to represent him as the most formidable of Men and dreadful even to  Achilles  This Passage therefore will be most consistent with  Agamemnon  's Design if it be consider'd as an Argument offer'd to  Menelaus  at once  to dissuade him from the Engagement and to comfort him under the Appearance of so great a Disgrace as refusing the Challenge by telling him that any Warrior how bold and intrepid soever might be content to sit still and rejoice that he is not expos'd to so hazardous an Engagement The Words  signify not to escape out of the Combate as the Translators take it but to avoid entring into it  The Phrase of  which is literally  to bend the Knee  means according to  Eustathius  to  rest  to sit down  and is used so by  Aeschylus  in  Prometheo  Those Interpreters were greatly mistaken who imagin'd it signify'd  to kneel down  to thank the Gods for escaping from such a Combate whereas the Custom of kneeling in Prayer as we before observ'd was not in use among these Nations  XVI  VERSE  The Speech of  Nestor  This Speech if we consider the Occasion of it could be made by no Person but  Nestor  No young Warrior could with Decency exhort others to undertake a Combate which himself declin'd Nothing could be more in his Character than to represent to the  Greeks  how much they would suffer in the Opinion of another old Man like himself In naming  Peleus  he sets before their Eyes the Expectations of all their Fathers and the Shame that must afflict them in their old Age if their Sons behaved themselves unworthily The Account he gives of the Conversations he had formerly held with that King and his Jealousy for the Glory of  Greece  is a very natural Picture of the warm Dialogues of two old Warriors upon the Commencement of a new War Upon the whole  Nestor  never more displays his Oratory than in this Place You see him rising with a Sigh expressing a pathetick Sorrow and wishing again for his Youth that he might wipe away this Disgrace from his Country The Humour of Storytelling so natural to old Men is almost always mark'd by  Homer  in the Speeches of  Nestor  The Apprehension that their Age makes them contemptible puts them upon repeating the brave Deeds of their  Youth  Plutarch  justifies the Praises  Nestor  here gives himself and the Vaunts of his Valour which on this Occasion were only Exhortations to those he address'd them to By these he restores Courage to the  Greeks  who were astonish'd at the bold Challenge of  Hector  and causes nine of the Princes to rise and accept it If any Man had a right to commend himself it was this venerable Prince who in relating his own Actions did no more than propose Examples of Virtue to the Young  Virgil  without any such softening Qualification makes his Hero say of himself  Sum pius Aeneas fama super aethera notus  And comfort a dying Warrior with these Words  Aeneae magni dextra cadis  The same Author also imitates the Wish of  Nestor  for a Return of his Youth where  Evander  cries out  O mihi praeteritos referat si Jupiter annos  Qualis eram cum primam aciem Praeneste sub ipsa  Stravi scutorumque incendi Victor acervos  Et regem hac Herilum dextra sub Tartara misi  As for the Narration of the  Arcadian  War introduced here it is a Part of the true History of those Times as we are inform'd by  Pausanias  XVII  VERSE  Those Arms which  Mars  before Had giv'n    Homer  has the peculiar Happiness of being able to raise the obscurest Circumstance into the strongest Point of Light  Areithous  had taken these Arms in Battel and this gives occasion to our Author to say they were the Present of  Mars Eustathius  XVIII  VERSE  Prone fell the Giant o'er a Length of Ground    Nestor  's insisting upon this Circumstance of the Fall of  Ereuthalion  which paints his vast Body lying extended on the Earth has a particular Beauty in it and recalls into the old Man's Mind the Joy he felt on the Sight of his Enemy after he was slain These are the fine and natural Strokes that give Life to the Descriptions of Poetry  XIX  VERSE  And nine the noblest  c  In this Catalogue of the nine Warriors who offer themselves as Champions for  Greece  one may take notice of the first and the last who rises up  Agamemnon  advanced foremost as it best became the General and  Ulysses  with his usual Caution took time to deliberate till seven more had offer'd themselves  Homer  gives a great Encomium of the Eloquence of  Nestor  in making it produce so sudden an Effect especially when  Agamemnon  who did not proffer himself before even to save his Brother is now the first that steps forth One would fancy this particular Circumstance was contrived to shew that Eloquence has a greater Power than even Nature itself  XX  VERSE  Let the Lots decide    This was a very prudent Piece of Conduct in  Nestor  he does not chuse any of these nine himself but leaves the Determination entirely to Chance Had he named the Hero the rest might have been griev'd to have seen another prefer'd before them and he well knew that the Lot could not fall upon a wrong Person where all were valiant  Eustathius  XXI  VERSE  Whom Heav'n shall chuse be his the Chance to raise  His Country's Fame his own immortal Praise    The Original of this Passage is somewhat confused the Interpreters  render it thus Cast the Lots and he who shall be chosen if he escapes from this dangerous Combate will do an eminent Service to the  Greeks  and also have cause to be greatly satisfied himself But the Sense will appear more distinct and rational if the Words  and  be not understood of the same Person and the Meaning of  Nestor  will then be he who is chosen for the Engagement by the Lot will do his Country great Service and he likewise who is not will have reason to rejoice for escaping so dangerous a Combate The Expression  is the same  Homer  uses in ‚Ñ£ of this Book which we explain'd in the same Sense in Note  XXII  VERSE  The People pray    Homer  who supposes every thing on Earth to proceed from the immediate Disposition of Heaven allows not even the  Lots  to come up by Chance but places them in the Hands of God The People pray to him for the Disposal of them and beg that  Ajax Diomed  or  Agamemnon  may be the Person In which the Poet seems to make the Army give his own Sentiments concerning the Preference of Valour in his Heroes to avoid an odious Comparison in downright Terms which might have been inconsistent with his Design of complementing the  Grecian  Families They afterwards offer up their Prayers again just as the Combate is beginning that if  Ajax  does not conquer at least he may divide the Glory with  Hector  in which the Commentators observe  Homer  prepares the Readers for what is to happen in the Sequel  XXIII  VERSE  Surveys th' Inscription    There is no Necessity to suppose that they put any Letters upon these Lots at least not their Names because the Herald could not tell to whom the Lot of  Ajax  belong'd till he claim'd it himself It is more probable that they made some private Mark or Signet each upon his own Lot The Lot was only a Piece of Wood a Shell or any thing that lay at hand  Eustathius  XXIV  VERSE  Warriors I claim the Lot    This is the first Speech of  Ajax  in the Iliad He is no Orator but always expresses himself in short generally bragging or threatning and very positive The Appellation of  the  Bulwark of the  Greeks which  Homer  almost constantly gives him is extremely proper to the Bulk Strength and Immobility of this heavy Hero who on all Occasions is made to stand to the Business and support the Brunt These Qualifications are given him that he may last out when the rest of the chief Heroes are wounded This makes him of excellent Use in Iliad  c  He there puts a Stop to the whole Force of the Enemy and a long time prevents the firing of the Ships It is particularly observable that he is never assisted by any Deity as the others are Yet one would think  Mars  had been no improper Patron for him there being some Resemblance in the boisterous Character of that God and this Hero However it be this Consideration may partly account for a Particular which else might very well raise a Question Why  Ajax  who is in this Book superior in Strength to  Hector  should afterward in the Iliad shun to meet him and appear his Inferior We see the Gods make this difference  Hector  is not only assisted by them in his own Person but his Men second him whereas those of  Ajax  are dispirited by Heaven To which one may add another which is a natural Reason  Hector  in this Book expresly tells  Ajax  he will now make use of no Skill or Art in Fighting with him The  Greek  in bare brutal Strength prov'd too hard for  Hector  and therefore he might be suppos'd afterwards to have exerted his Dexterity against him  XXV  VERSE  He moves to Combate  c  This Description is full of the sublime Imagery so peculiar to our Author The  Grecian  Champion is drawn in all that terrible Glory with which he equals his Heroes to the Gods He is no less dreadful  than  Mars  moving to Battel to execute the Decrees of  Jove  upon Mankind and determine the Fate of Nations His March his Posture his Countenance his Bulk his Tow'rlike Shield in a word his whole Figure strikes our Eyes in all the strongest Colours of Poetry We look upon him as a Deity and are not astonish'd at those Emotions which  Hector  feels at the Sight of him  XXVI  VERSE  The Work of  Tychius  I shall ask leave to transcribe here the Story of this  Tychius  as we have it in the ancient  Life of Homer  attributed to  Herodotus  "  Homer  falling into Poverty determined to go to  Cuma  and as he past thro' the Plain of  Hermus  came to a Place called  The New Wall  which was a Colony of the  Cumaeans  Here  after he had recited five Verses in Celebration of  Cuma he was received by a Leatherdresser whose Name was  Tychius  into his House where he shew'd to his Host and his Company a Poem on the Expedition of  Amphiaraus  and his Hymns The Admiration he there obtain'd procur'd him a present Subsistance They shew to this Day with great Veneration the Place where he sate when he recited his Verses and a Poplar which they affirm to have grown there in his Time"  If there be any thing in this Story we have reason to be pleas'd with the grateful Temper of our Poet who took this Occasion of immortalizing the Name of an ordinary Tradesman who had obliged him The same Account of his Life takes notice of several other Instances of his Gratitude in the same kind  XXVII  VERSE  In Arts of Armoury    I have called  Tychius  an Armourer rather than a Leatherdresser or Currier his making the Shield of  Ajax  authorizes one Expression as well as the other and tho' that which  Homer  uses had no Lowness or Vulgarity in the  Greek  it was not to be admitted into  English  heroic Verse  XXVIII  VERSE Hector  approach my Arm  c  I think it needless to observe how exactly this Speech of  Ajax  corresponds with his blunt and Soldierlike Character The same Propriety in regard to this Hero is maintained throughout the Iliad The Business he is about is all that employs his Head and he speaks of nothing but Fighting The last Line is an Image of his Mind at all times  No morebe sudden and begin the Fight  XXIX  VERSE  Me as a Boy or Woman would'st thou fright    This Reply of  Hector  seems rather to allude to some Action  Ajax  had used in his Approach to him as  shaking his Spear  or the like than to any thing he had said in his Speech For what he had told him amounts to no more than that there were several in the  Grecian  Army who had courted the Honour of this Combate as well as himself I think one must observe many things of this kind in  Homer  that allude to the particular Attitude or Action in which the Author supposes the Person to be in at that time  XXX  VERSE  Turn charge and answer ev'ry Call of War    The  Greek  is  To move my Feet to the Sound of  Mars which seems to shew that those military Dances were in Use even in  Homer  's Time which were afterwards practised in  Greece  XXXI  VERSE  From their bor'd Shields the Chiefs their Javelins drew    Homer  in this Combate makes his Heroes perform all their Exercises with all sorts of Weapons first darting Lances at distance then advancing closer and pushing with Spears  then casting Stones and lastly attacking with Swords in every one of which the Poet gives the Superiority to his Countryman It is farther observable as  Eustathius  remarks that  Ajax  allows  Hector  an Advantage in throwing the first Spear  XXXII  VERSE Apollo  's Might    In the beginning of this Book we left  Apollo  perch'd upon a Tree in the Shape of a Vultur to behold the Combate He comes now very opportunely to save his Favourite  Hector Eustathius  says that  Apollo  is the same with  Destiny  so that when  Homer  says  Apollo  sav'd him he means no more than that it was not his Fate yet to die as  Helenus  had foretold him  XXXIII  VERSE  Heralds the sacred Ministers  c  The Heralds of old were sacred Persons accounted the Delegates of  Mercury  and inviolable by the Law of Nations The ancient Histories have many Examples of the Severity exercised against those who committed any Outrage upon them Their Office was to assist in the Sacrifices and Councils to proclaim War or Peace to command Silence at Ceremonies or single Combates to part the Combatants and to declare the Conqueror  c  XXXIV  VERSE  Divine  Talthybius c  This Interposition of the two Heralds to part the Combatants on the Approach of the Night is apply'd by  Tasso  to the single Combate of  Tancred  and  Argantes  in the sixth Book of his  Jerusalem  The Herald's Speech and particularly that remarkable Injunction to  Obey the Night  are translated literally by that Author The Combatants there also part not without a Promise of meeting again in Battel on some more favourable Opportunity  XXXV  VERSE  And first  Idaeus  Homer  observes a just Decorum in making  Idaeus  the  Trojan  Herald speak first to end the Combate wherein  Hector  had the Disadvantage  Ajax  is very sensible of this Difference when in his Reply he requires that  Hector  should first ask for a Cessation as he was the Challenger  Eustathius  XXXVI  VERSE  O first of  Greeks c  Hector  how hardly soever he is prest by his present Circumstance says nothing to obtain a Truce that is not strictly consistent with his Honour When he praises  Ajax  it lessens his own Disadvantage and he is careful to extol him only above the  Greeks  without acknowledging him more valiant than himself or the  Trojans Hector  is always jealous of the Honour of his Country In what follows we see he keeps himself on a level with his Adversary  Hereafter we shall meetGo thou and give the same Joy to thy  Grecians  for thy Escape as I shall to my  Trojans The  Point of Honour  in all this is very nicely preserved  XXXVII  VERSE  Who wearies Heav'n with Vows for  Hector  's Life    Eustathius  gives many Solutions of the Difficulty in these Words  They mean either that the  Trojan  Ladies will pray to the Gods for him  or  certatim  with the utmost Zeal and Transport or that they will go in Procession to the Temples for him    coetum Deorum  or that they will pray to him as to a God    XXXVIII  VERSE  Exchange some Gift    There is nothing that gives us a greater Pleasure in reading an heroic Poem than  the Generosity which one brave Enemy shews to another The Proposal made here by  Hector  and so readily embraced by  Ajax  makes the Parting of these two Heroes more glorious to them than the Continuance of the Combate had been A  French  Critick is shock'd at  Hector  's making Proposals to  Ajax  with an Air of Equality he says a Man that is vanquish'd instead of talking of Presents ought to retire with Shame from his Conqueror But that  Hector  was vanquish'd is by no means to be allowed  Homer  had told us that his Strength was restored by  Apollo  and that the two Combatants were engaging again upon equal Terms with their Swords So that this Criticism falls to nothing For the rest 'tis said that this Exchange of Presents between  Hector  and  Ajax  gave Birth to a Proverb that the Presents of Enemies are generally fatal For  Ajax  with this Sword afterwards killed himself and  Hector  was dragg'd by this Belt at the Chariot of  Achilles  XXXIX  VERSE  Before great  Ajax  plac'd the mighty Chine    This is one of those Passages that will naturally fall under the Ridicule of a true modern Critick But what  Agamemnon  here bestows on  Ajax  was in former Times a great Mark of Respect and Honour Not only as it was customary to distinguish the Quality of their Guests by the Largeness of the Portions assigned them at their Tables but as this Part of the Victim peculiarly belong'd to the King himself It is worth remarking on this Occasion that the Simplicity of those Times allowed the eating of no other Flesh but Beef Mutton or Kid This is the Food of the Heroes of  Homer  and the Patriarchs and Warriors of the Old Testament Fishing and Fowling were the Arts of more luxurious Nations and came much later into  Greece  and  Israel  One cannot read this Passage without being pleased with the wonderful Simplicity of the old heroic Ages We have here a gallant Warrior returning victorious for that he thought himself so appears from those Words  from a single Combate with the bravest of his Enemies and he is  no otherwise rewarded than with a larger Portion of the Sacrifice at Supper Thus an upper Seat or a more capacious Bowl was a Recompence for the greatest Actions and thus the only Reward in the Olympic Games was a PineBranch or a Chaplet of Parsley or wild Olive The latter Part of this Note belongs to  Eustathius  XL  VERSE  While we to Flames  c  There is a great deal of Artifice in this Counsel of  Nestor  of burning the Dead and raising a Fortification for tho' Piety was the specious Pretext their Security was the real Aim of the Truce which they made use of to finish their Works Their doing this at the same time they erected the Funeral Piles made the Imposition easy upon the Enemy who might naturally mistake one Work for the other And this also obviates a plain Objection  viz  Why the  Trojans  did not interrupt them in this Work The Truce determined no exact Time but as much as was needful for discharging the Rites of the Dead  I fancy it may not be unwelcome to the Reader to enlarge a little upon the way of disposing the Dead among the Ancients It may be proved from innumerable Instances that the  Hebrews  interred their Dead thus  Abraham  's Buryingplace is frequently mentioned in Scripture And that the  Aegyptians  did the same is plain from their embalming them Some have been of Opinion that the Usage of Burning the Dead was originally to prevent any Outrage to the Bodies from their Enemies which Imagination is render'd not improbable by that Passage in the first Book of  Samuel  where the  Israelites  burn the Bodies of  Saul  and his Sons after they had been misused by the  Philistines  even tho' their common Custom was to bury their Dead And so  Sylla  among the  Romans  was the first of his Family who order'd his Body to be burnt for fear the Barbarities he had exercised on that of  Marius  might be retaliated upon his own Tully  de legibus lib    Proculdubio cremandi ritus a Graecis venit nam sepultum legimus Numam ad Anienis fontem totique genti Corneliae  solenne fuisse sepulcrum usque ad Syllam qui primus ex ea gente crematus est  The  Greeks  used both ways of interring and burning  Patroclus  was burned and  Ajax  lay'd in the Ground as appears from  Sophocles  's  Ajax  lin    Hasten  says the Chorus  to prepare a hollow Hole a Grave for this Man  Thucidydes  in his second Book mentions  Coffins or Chests made of Cypress Wood in which the  Athenians  kept the Bones of their Friends that dy'd in the Wars  The  Romans  derived from the  Greeks  both these Customs of burning and burying  In Urbe neve  SEPELITO  neve  URITO says the Law of the Twelve Tables The Place where they burn'd the Dead was set apart for this religious Use and called  Glebe  from which Practice the Name is yet apply'd to all the Grounds belonging to the Church  Plutarch  observes that  Homer  is the first who mentions one general Tomb for a Number of dead Persons Here is a  Tumulus  built round the  Pyre  not to bury their Bodies for they were to be burn'd nor to receive the Bones for those were to be carry'd to  Greece  but perhaps to inter their Ashes which Custom may be gather'd from a Passage in Iliad ‚Ñ£ or it might be only a  Cenotaph  in Remembrance of the Dead  XLI  VERSE  The  Trojan  Peers in nightly Council sate    There is a great Beauty in the two Epithets  Homer  gives to this Council      timida turbulenta  The unjust side is always fearful and discordant I think M  Dacier  has not entirely done Justice to this Thought in her Translation  Horace  seems to have accounted this an useful and necessary Part that contain'd the great Moral of the Iliad as may be seen from his selecting it in particular from the rest in his Epistle to  Lollius  Fabula qua Paridis propter narratur amorem  Graecia Barbariae lento collisa duello  Stultorum Regum populorum continet aestus  Antenor censet belli praecidere causam  Quid Paris Ut salvus regnet vivatque beatus  Cogi posse negat  XLII  VERSE  The rev'rend  Priam  rose    Priam  rejects the wholsome Advice of  Antenor  and complies with his Son This is indeed extremely natural to the indulgent Character and easy Nature of the old King of which the whole  Trojan  War is a Proof but I could wish  Homer  had not just in this Place celebrated his Wisdom in calling him    Spondanus  refers this Blindness of  Priam  to the Power of Fate the Time now approaching when  Troy  was to be punish'd for its Injustice Something like this weak Fondness of a Father is described in the Scripture in the Story of  David  and  Absalom  XLIII  VERSE  Next let a Truce be ask'd    The Conduct of  Homer  in this Place is remarkable He makes  Priam  propose in Council to send to the  Greeks  to ask a Truce to bury the Dead This the  Greeks  themselves had before determined to propose But it being more honourable to his Country the Poet makes the  Trojan  Herald prevent any Proposition that could be made by the  Greeks  Thus they are requested to do what they themselves were about to request and have the Honour to comply with a Proposal which they themselves would otherwise have taken as a Favour  Eustathius  XLIV  VERSE  Each at his Post in Arms    We have here the manner of the  Trojans  taking their Repast Not promiscuously  but each at his Post  Homer  was sensible that military Men ought not to remit their Guard even while they refresh themselves but in every Action display the Soldier  Eustathius  XLV  VERSE  The Speech of  Idaeus  The Proposition of restoring the Treasures and not  Helen  is sent as from  Paris  only in which his Father seems to permit him to treat by himself as a Sovereign Prince and the sole Author of the War But the Herald seems to exceed his Commission in what he tells the  Greeks Paris  only offer'd to restore the Treasures he took from  Greece  not including those he brought from  Sidon  and other Coasts where he touch'd in his Voyage But  Idaeus  here proffers all that he brought to  Troy  He adds as from himself a Wish that  Paris  had perish'd in that Voyage Some ancient Expositors suppose those Words to be spoken aside or in a low Voice as it is usual in Dramatic Poetry But without that  Salvo  a generous Love for the Welfare of his Country might transport  Idaeus  into some warm Expressions against the Author of its Woes He lays aside the Herald to act the Patriot and speaks with a noble Indignation against  Paris  that he may Influence the  Grecian  Captains to give a favourable Answer  Eustathius  XLVI  VERSE  The  Greeks  gave ear but none the Silence broke    This Silence of the  Greeks  might naturally proceed from their Opinion that however desirous they were to put an end to this long War  Menelaus  would never consent to relinquish  Helen  which was the thing insisted upon by  Paris Eustathius  accounts for it in another manner and it is from him M  Dacier  has taken her Remark The Princes says he were silent because it was the Part of  Agamemnon  to determine in Matters of this Nature and  Agamemnon  is silent being willing to hear the Inclinations of the Princes By this means he avoided the Imputation of exposing the  Greeks  to Dangers for his Advantage and Glory since he only gives the Answer which is put into his Mouth by the Princes with the general Applause of the Army  XLVII  VERSE  Oh take not  Greeks c  There is a peculiar Decorum in making  Diomed  the Author of this Advice to reject even  Helen  herself if she were offer'd this had not agreed with an amorous Husband like  Menelaus  nor with a cunning Politician like  Ulysses  nor with a wise old Man like  Nestor  But it is proper to  Diomed  not only as a young fearless Warrior but as he is in particular an Enemy to the Interests of  Venus  XLVIII  VERSE  And lay'd along the Cars    These probably were not Chariots but Carriages for  Homer  makes  Nestor  say in ‚Ñ£ that this was to be done with Mules and Oxen which were not commonly join'd to Chariots and the word  there may be apply'd to any Vehicle that runs on Wheels  signifies indifferently  Plaustrum  or  Currus  and our  English  word  Car  implies either But if they did use Chariots in bearing their Dead it is at least evident that those Chariots were drawn by Mules and Oxen at Funeral Solemnities  Homer  's using the word  and not  confirms this Opinion  XLIX  VERSE  Then to secure the Camp  c  Homer  has been accus'd of an Offence against Probability in causing this Fortification to be made so late as in the last Year of the War Mad  Dacier  answers to this Objection that the  Greeks  had no Occasion for it till the Departure of  Achilles  He alone was a greater Defence to them and  Homer  had told the Reader in a preceding Book that the  Trojans  never durst venture out of the Walls of  Troy  while  Achilles  fought These Intrenchments  therefore serve to raise the Glory of his principal Hero since they become necessary as soon as he withdraws his Aid She might have added that  Achilles  himself says all this and makes  Homer  's Apology in the ninth Book ‚Ñ£ The same Author speaking of this Fortification seems to doubt whether the Use of intrenching Camps was known in the  Trojan  War and is rather inclined to think  Homer  borrowed it from what was practised in his own Time But I believe if we consider the Caution with which he has been observed in some Instances already given to preserve the Manners of the Age he writes of in Contradistinction to what was practised in his own we may reasonably conclude the Art of Fortification was in use even so long before him and in the Degree of Perfection that he here describes it If it was not and if  Homer  was fond of describing an Improvement in this Art made in his own Days nothing could be better contrived than his feigning  Nestor  to be the Author of it whose Wisdom and Experience in War render'd it probable that he might carry his Projects farther than the rest of his Contemporaries We have here a Fortification as perfect as any in the modern Times A strong Wall is thrown up Towers are built upon it from Space to Space Gates are made to issue out at and a Ditch sunk deep wide and long to all which Palisades are added to compleat it  L  VERSE  Meanwhile the Gods    The Fiction of this Wall raised by the  Greeks  has given no little Advantage to  Homer  's Poem in furnishing him with an Opportunity of changing the Scene and in a great degree the Subject and Accidents of his Battels so that the following Descriptions of War are totally different from all the foregoing He takes care at the first mention of it to fix in us a great Idea of this Work by making the Gods immediately concern'd about it We see  Neptune  jealous lest the Glory of his own Work the Walls of  Troy  should be effaced by it and  Jupiter  comforting him with a Prophecy that it shall be totally destroy'd in a short time  Homer  was sensible that as this was a Building  of his Imagination only and not founded like many other of his Descriptions upon some Antiquities or Traditions of the Country so Posterity might convict him of a Falsity when no Remains of any such Wall should be seen on the Coast Therefore as  Aristotle  observes he has found this way to elude the Censure of an improbable Fiction The Word of  Jove  was fulfilled the Hands of the Gods the Force of the Rivers and the Waves of the Sea demolish'd it In the twelfth Book he digresses from the Subject of his Poem to describe the Execution of this Prophecy The Verses there are very noble and have given the Hint to  Milton  for those in which he accounts after the same Poetical manner for the Vanishing of the Terrestrial Paradise  All Fountains of the Deep  Broke up shall heave the Ocean to usurp  Beyond all bounds till Inundation rise  Above the highest Hills Then shall this Mount  Of  Paradise  by Might of Waves be mov'd  Out of its place push'd by the horned Flood  With all its Verdure spoil'd and Trees adrift  Down the great River to the opening Gulf  And there take root an Island salt and bare  The Haunt of Seals and Orcs and Seamews clang  LI  VERSE  And now the Fleet  c  The Verses from hence to the end of the Book afford us the Knowledge of some Points of History and Antiquity As that  Jason  had a Son by  Hypsipyle  who succeeded his Mother in the Kingdom of  Lemnos  That the Isle of  Lemnos  was anciently famous for its Wines and drove a Traffick in them and that coined Money was not in use in the Time of the  Trojan  War but the Trade of Countries carry'd on by Exchange in gross Brass Oxen Slaves c I must not forget the particular Term used here for Slave  which is literally the same with our modern word  Footman  LII  VERSE  But  Jove  averse  c  The Signs by which  Jupiter  here shews his Wrath against the  Grecians  are a Prelude to those more open Declarations of his Anger which follow in the next Book and prepare the Mind of the Reader for that Machine which might otherwise seem too bold and violent  THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The second Battel and the Distress of the  Greeks  JUPITER  assembles a Council of the Deities and threatens them with the Pains of  Tartarus  if they assist either side  Minerva  only obtains of him that she may direct the  Greeks  by her Counsels The Armies join Battel  Jupiter  on Mount  Ida  weighs in his Balances the Fates of both and affrights the  Greeks  with his Thunders and Lightnings  Nestor  alone continues in the Field in great Danger  Diomed  relieves him whose Exploits and those of  Hector  are excellently described  Juno  endeavours to animate  Neptune  to the Assistance of the  Greeks  but in vain The Acts of  Teucer  who is at length wounded by  Hector  and carry'd off  Juno  and  Minerva  prepare to aid the  Grecians  but are restrained by  Iris  sent from  Jupiter  The Night puts an end to the Battel  Hector  keeps the Field the  Greeks  being driven to their Fortification before the Ships and gives Orders to keep the Watch all Night in the Camp to prevent the Enemy from reimbarking and escaping by Flight They kindle Fires through all the Field and pass the Night under Arms  The  Time  of seven and twenty Days is employed from the Opening of the Poem to the End of this Book The  Scene  here except of the Celestial Machines lies in the Field toward the Sea Shore  THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  AURORA  now fair Daughter of the Dawn  Sprinkled with rosy Light the dewy Lawn  When  Jove  conven'd the Senate of the Skies  Where high  Olympus'  cloudy Tops arise  The Sire of Gods his awful Silence broke  The Heav'ns attentive trembled as he spoke  Celestial States Immortal Gods give ear  Hear our Decree and rev'rence what ye hear  The fix'd Decree which not all Heav'n can move  Thou Fate fulfill it and ye Pow'rs approve  What God but enters yon' forbidden Field  Who yields Assistance or but wills to yield  Back to the Skies with Shame he shall be driv'n  Gash'd with dishonest Wounds the Scorn of Heav'n  Or far oh far from steep  Olympus  thrown  Low in the dark  Tartarean  Gulf shall groan  With burning Chains fix'd to the Brazen Floors  And lock'd by Hell's inexorable Doors  As deep beneath th' Infernal Centre hurl'd  As from that Centre to th' Aethereal World  Let him who tempts me dread those dire Abodes  And know th' Almighty is the God of Gods  League all your Forces then ye Pow'rs above  Join all and try th' Omnipotence of  Jove  Let down our golden everlasting Chain  Whose strong Embrace holds Heav'n and Earth and Main  Strive all of mortal and immortal Birth  To drag by this the Thund'rer down to Earth  Ye strive in vain If I but stretch this Hand  I heave the Gods the Ocean and the Land  I fix the Chain to great  Olympus'  Height  And the vast World hangs trembling in my Sight  For such I reign unbounded and above  And such are Men and Gods compar'd to  Jove  Th' Almighty spoke nor durst the Pow'rs reply  A rev'rend Horror silenc'd all the Sky  Trembling they stood before their Sov'reign's Look  At length his Bestbelov'd the Pow'r of  Wisdom  spoke  Oh First and Greatest God by Gods ador'd  We own thy Might our Father and our Lord  But ah permit to pity human State  If not to help at least lament their Fate  From Fields forbidden we submiss refrain  With Arms unaiding mourn our  Argives  slain  Yet grant my Counsels still their Breasts may move  Or all must perish in the Wrath of  Jove  The Cloudcompelling God her Suit approv'd  And smil'd superior on his Bestbelov'd  Then call'd his Coursers

Fire  Blue ambient Mists th' immortal Steeds embrac'd  High on the cloudy Point his Seat he plac'd  Thence his broad Eye the subject World surveys  The Town the Tents and navigable Seas  Now had the  Grecians  snatch'd a short Repaste  And buckled on their shining Arms with Haste  Troy  rowz'd as soon for on this dreadful Day  The Fate of Fathers Wives and Infants lay  The Gates unfolding pour forth all their Train  Squadrons on Squadrons cloud the dusky Plain  Men Steeds and Chariots shake the trembling Ground  The Tumult thickens and the Skies resound  And now with Shouts the shocking Armies clos'd  To Lances Lances Shields to Shields oppos'd  Host against Host with shadowy Legions drew  The sounding Darts in Iron Tempests flew  Victors and Vanquish'd join promiscuous Cries  Triumphant Shouts and dying Groans arise  With streaming Blood the slipp'ry Fields are dy'd  And slaughter'd Heroes swell the dreadful Tide  Long as the Morning Beams encreasing bright  O'er Heav'ns clear Azure spread the sacred Light  Commutual Death the Fate of War confounds  Each adverse Battel goar'd with equal Wounds  But when the Sun the Height of Heav'n ascends  The Sire of Gods his golden Scales suspends  With equal Hand In these explor'd the Fate  Of  Greece  and  Troy  and pois'd the mighty Weight  Press'd with its Load the  Grecian  Balance lies  Low sunk on Earth the  Trojan  strikes the Skies  Then  Jove  from  Ida  's Top his Horrors spreads  The Clouds burst dreadful o'er the  Grecian  Heads  Thick Light'nings flash the mutt'ring Thunder rolls  Their Strength he withers and unmans their Souls  Before his Wrath the trembling Host retire  The God in Terrors and the Skies on fire  Nor great  Idomeneus  that Sight could bear  Nor each stern  Ajax  Thunderbolts of War  Nor He the King of Men th'Alarm sustain'd  Nestor  alone amidst the Storm remain'd  Unwilling he remain'd for  Paris'  Dart  Had pierc'd his Courser in a mortal Part  Fix'd in the Forehead where the springing Mane  Curl'd o'er the Brow it stung him to the Brain  Mad with his Anguish he begins to rear  Paw with his Hoofs aloft and lash the Air  Scarce had his Falchion cut the Reins and freed  Th' incumber'd Chariot from the dying Steed  When dreadful  Hector  thund'ring thro' the War  Pour'd to the Tumult on his whirling Car  That Day had stretch'd beneath his matchless Hand  The hoary Monarch of the  Pylian  Band  But  Diomed  beheld from forth the Crowd  He rush'd and on  Ulysses  call'd aloud  Whither oh whither does  Ulysses  run  Oh Flight unworthy great  Laertes'  Son  Mix'd with the Vulgar shall thy Fate be found  Pierc'd in the Back a vile dishonest Wound  Oh turn and save from  Hector  's direful Rage  The Glory of the  Greeks  the  Pylian  Sage  His fruitless Words are lost unheard in Air  Ulysses  seeks the Ships and shelters there  But bold  Tydides  to the Rescue goes  A single Warrior 'midst a Host of Foes  Before the Coursers with a sudden Spring  He leap'd and anxious thus bespoke the King  Great Perils Father wait th' unequal Fight  These younger Champions will oppress thy Might  Thy Veins no more with ancient Vigour glow  Weak is thy Servant and thy Coursers slow  Then haste ascend my Seat and from the Car  Observe the Steeds of  Tros  renown'd in War  Practis'd alike to turn to stop to chace  To dare the Fight or urge the rapid Race  These late obey'd  Aeneas'  guiding Rein  Leave thou thy Chariot to our faithful Train  With these against yon'  Trojans  will we go  Nor shall great  Hector  want an equal Foe  Fierce as he is ev'n He may learn to fear  The thirsty Fury of my flying Spear  Thus said the Chief and  Nestor  skill'd in War  Approves his Counsel and ascends the Car  The Steeds he left their trusty Servants hold  Eurymedon  and  Sthenelus  the bold  The rev'rend Charioteer directs the Course  And strains his aged Arm to lash the Horse  Hector  they face unknowing how to fear  Fierce he drove on  Tydides  whirl'd his Spear  The Spear with erring Haste mistook its way  But plung'd in  Eniopeus'  Bosom lay  His opening Hand in Death forsakes the Rein  The Steeds fly back He falls and spurns the Plain  Great  Hector  sorrows for his Servant kill'd  Yet unreveng'd permits to press the Field  Till to supply his Place and rule the Car  Rose  Archeptolemus  the fierce in War  And now had Death and Horror cover'd all  Like tim'rous Flocks the  Trojans  in their Wall  Inclos'd had bled but  Jove  with awful Sound  Roll'd the big Thunder o'er the vast Profound  Full in  Tydides'  Face the Light'ning flew  The Ground before him flam'd with Sulphur blew  The quiv'ring Steeds fell prostrate at the Sight  And  Nestor  's trembling Hand confess'd his Fright  He drop'd the Reins and shook with sacred Dread  Thus turning warn'd th' intrepid  Diomed  O Chief too daring in thy Friend's Defence  Retire advis'd and urge the Chariot hence  This Day averse the Sov'reign of the Skies  Assists great  Hector  and our Palm denies  Some other Sun may see the happier Hour  When  Greece  shall conquer by his heav'nly Pow'r  'Tis not in Man his fix'd Decree to move  The Great will glory to submit to  Jove  O rev'rend Prince  Tydides  thus replies  Thy Years are awful and thy Words are wise  But ah what Grief should haughty  Hector  boast  I fled inglorious to the guarded Coast  Before that dire Disgrace shall blast my Fame  O'erwhelm me Earth and hide a Warrior's Shame  To whom  Gerenian Nestor  thus reply'd  Gods can thy Courage fear the  Phrygian  's Pride  Hector  may vaunt but who shall heed the Boast  Not those who felt thy Arm the  Dardan  Host  Nor  Troy  yet bleeding in her Heroes lost  Not ev'n a  Phrygian  Dame who dreads the Sword  That lay'd in Dust her lov'd lamented Lord  He said and hasty o'er the gasping Throng  Drives the swift Steeds the Chariot smoaks along  The Shouts of  Trojans  thicken in the Wind  The Storm of hissing Javelins pours behind  Then with a Voice that shakes the solid Skies  Pleas'd  Hector  braves the Warrior as he flies  Go mighty Hero grac'd above the rest  In Seats of Council and the sumptuous Feast  Now hope no more those Honours from thy Train  Go less than Woman in the Form of Man  To scale our Walls to wrap our Tow'rs in Flames  To lead in Exile the fair  Phrygian  Dames  Thy onceproud Hopes presumptuous Prince are fled  This Arm shall reach thy Heart and stretch thee dead  Now Fears dissuade him and now Hopes invite  To stop his Coursers and to stand the Fight  Thrice turn'd the Chief and thrice imperial  Jove  On  Ida  's Summits thunder'd from above  Great  Hector  heard he saw the flashing Light  The Sign of Conquest and thus urg'd the Fight  Hear ev'ry  Trojan Lycian Dardan  Band  All fam'd in War and dreadful hand to hand  Be mindful of the Wreaths your Arms have won  Your great Forefathers Glories and your own  Heard ye the Voice of  Jove  Success and Fame  Await on  Troy  on  Greece  eternal Shame  In vain they skulk behind their boasted Wall  Weak Bulwarks destin'd by this Arm to fall  High o'er their slighted Trench our Steeds shall bound  And pass victorious o'er the levell'd Mound  Soon as before yon' hollow Ships we stand  Fight each with Flames and toss the blazing Brand  Till their proud Navy wrapt in Smoak and Fires  All  Greece  encompass'd in one Blaze expires  Furious he said then bending o'er the Yoke  Encourag'd his proud Steeds while thus he spoke  Now  Xanthus Aethon Lampus  urge the Chace  And thou  Podargus  prove thy gen'rous Race  Be fleet be fearless this important Day  And all your Masters wellspent Care repay  For this high fed in plenteous Stalls ye stand  Serv'd with pure Wheat and by a Princess' Hand  For this my Spouse of great  Aetion  's Line  So oft' has steep'd the strength'ning Grain in Wine  Now swift pursue now thunder uncontroll'd  Give me to seize rich  Nestor  's Shield of Gold  From  Tydeus'  Shoulders strip the costly Load  Vulcanian  Arms the Labour of a God  These if we gain then Victory ye Pow'rs  This Night this glorious Night the Fleet is ours  That heard deep Anguish stung  Saturnia  's Soul  She shook her Throne that shook the starry Pole  And thus to  Neptune  Thou whose Force can make  The stedfast Earth from her Foundations shake  See'st thou the  Greeks  by Fates unjust opprest  Nor swells thy Heart in that immortal Breast  Yet  Aegae Helic√®  thy Pow'r obey  And Gifts unceasing on thine Altars lay  Would all the Deities of  Greece  combine  In vain the gloomy Thund'rer might repine  Sole should he sit with scarce a God to Friend  And see his  Trojans  to the Shades descend  Such be the Scene from his  Idaean  Bow'r  Ungrateful Prospect to the sullen Pow'r  Neptune  with Wrath rejects the rash Design  What Rage what Madness furious Queen is thine  I war not with the Highest All above  Submit and tremble at the Hand of  Jove  Now Godlike  Hector  to whose matchless Might  Jove  gave the Glory of the destin'd Fight  Squadrons on Squadrons drives and fills the Fields  With closerang'd Chariots and with thicken'd Shields  Where the deep Trench in Length extended lay  Compacted Troops stand wedg'd in firm Array  A dreadful Front they shake the Bands and threat  With longdestroying Flames the hostile Fleet  The King of Men by  Juno  's self inspir'd  Toil'd thro' the Tents and all his Army fir'd  Swift as he mov'd he lifted in his Hand  His Purple Robe bright Ensign of Command  High on the midmost Bark the King appear'd  There from  Ulysses'  Deck his Voice was heard  To  Ajax  and  Achilles  reach'd the Sound  Whose distant Ships the guarded Navy bound  Oh  Argives  Shame of human Race he cry'd  The hollow Vessels to his Voice reply'd  Where now are all our glorious Boasts of yore  Our hasty Triumphs on the  Lemnian  Shore  Each fearless Hero dares an hundred Foes  While the Feast lasts and while the Goblet flows  But who to meet one martial Man is found  When the Fight rages and the Flames surround  Oh mighty  Jove  oh Sire of the distress'd  Was ever King like me like me oppress'd  With Pow'r immense with Justice arm'd in vain  My Glory ravish'd and my People slain  To thee my Vows were breath'd from ev'ry Shore  What Altar smoak'd not with our Victims Gore  With Fat of Bulls I fed the constant Flame  And ask'd Destruction to the  Trojan  Name  Now gracious God far humbler our Demand  Give these at least to 'scape from  Hector  's Hand  And save the Reliques of the  Grecian  Land  Thus pray'd the King and Heav'ns great Father heard  His Vows in Bitterness of Soul preferr'd  The Wrath appeas'd by happy Signs declares  And gives the People to their Monarch's Pray'rs  His Eagle sacred Bird of Heav'n he sent  A Fawn his Talons truss'd divine Portent  High o'er the wond'ring Hosts he soar'd above  Who paid their Vows to  Panomphaean Jove  Then let the Prey before his Altar fall  The  Greeks  beheld and Transport seiz'd on all  Encourag'd by the Sign the Troops revive  And fierce on  Troy  with doubled Fury drive  Tydides  first of all the  Grecian  Force  O'er the broad Ditch impell'd his foaming Horse  Pierc'd the deep Ranks their strongest Battel tore  And dy'd his Javelin red with  Trojan  Gore  Young  Agel√§us    Phradmon  was his Sire  With flying Coursers shun'd his dreadful Ire  Strook thro' the Back the  Phrygian  fell opprest  The Dart drove on and issu'd at his Breast  Headlong he quits the Car his Arms resound  His pond'rous Buckler thunders on the Ground  Forth rush a Tide of  Greeks  the Passage freed  th'  Atridae  first th'  Ajaces  next succeed  Meriones  like  Mars  in Arms renown'd  And Godlike  Idomen  now pass the Mound  Euaemon  's Son next issues to the Foe  And last young  Teucer  with his bended Bow  Secure behind the  Telamonian  Shield  The skilful Archer wide survey'd the Field  With ev'ry Shaft some hostile Victim slew  Then close beneath the sev'nfold Orb withdrew  The conscious Infant so when Fear alarms  Retires for Safety to the Mother's Arms  Thus  Ajax  guards his Brother in the Field  Moves as he moves and turns the shining Shield  Who first by  Teucer  's mortal Arrows bled  Orsilochus  then fell  Ormenus  dead  The Godlike  Lycophon  next press'd the Plain  With  Chromius Daetor Ophelestes  slain  Bold  Hamop√§on  breathless sunk to Ground  The bloody Pile great  Melanippus  crown'd  Heaps fell on Heaps sad Trophies of his Art  A  Trojan  Ghost attending ev'ry Dart  Great  Agamemnon  views with joyful Eye  The Ranks grow thinner as his Arrows fly  Oh Youth for ever dear the Monarch cry'd  Thus always thus thy early Worth be try'd  Thy brave Example shall retrieve our Host  Thy Country's Saviour and thy Father's Boast  Sprung from an Alien's Bed thy Sire to grace  The vig'rous Offspring of a stol'n Embrace  Proud of his Boy he own'd the gen'rous Flame  And the brave Son repays his Cares with Fame  Now hear a Monarchs Vow If Heav'ns high Pow'rs  Give me to raze  Troy  's longdefended Tow'rs  Whatever Treasures  Greece  for me design  The next rich Honorary Gift be thine  Some golden Tripod or distinguish'd Car  With Coursers dreadful in the Ranks of War  Or some fair Captive whom thy Eyes approve  Shall recompence the Warrior's Toils with Love  To this the Chief With Praise the rest inspire  Nor urge a Soul already fill'd with fire  What Strength I have be now in Battel try'd  Till ev'ry Shaft in  Phrygian  Blood be dy'd  Since rallying from our Wall we forc'd the Foe  Still aim'd at  Hector  have I bent my Bow  Eight forky Arrows from this Hand have fled  And eight bold Heroes by their Points lie dead  But sure some God denies me to destroy  This Fury of the Field this Dog of  Troy  He said and twang'd the String The Weapon flies  At  Hector  's Breast and sings along the Skies  He miss'd the Mark but pierc'd  Gorgythio  's Heart  And drench'd in Royal Blood the thirsty Dart  Fair  Castianira  Nymph of Form Divine  This Offspring added to King  Priam  's Line  As full blown Poppies overcharg'd with Rain  Decline the Head and drooping kiss the Plain  So sinks the Youth his beauteous Head depress'd  Beneath his Helmet drops upon his Breast  Another Shaft the raging Archer drew  That other Shaft with erring Fury flew  From  Hector Phoebus  turn'd the flying Wound  Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the Ground  Thy Breast brave  Archeptolemus  it tore  And dipp'd its Feathers in no vulgar Gore  Headlong he falls his sudden Fall alarms  The Steeds that startle at his sounding Arms  Hector  with Grief his Charioteer beheld  And ey'd him breathless on the sanguin Field  Then bids  Cebriones  direct the Rein  Quits his bright Car and issues on the Plain  Dreadful he shouts from Earth a Stone he took  And rush'd on  Teucer  with the lifted Rock  The Youth already strain'd the forceful Yew  The Shaft already to his Shoulder drew  The Feather in his Hand just wing'd for flight  Touch'd where the Neck and hollow Chest unite  There where the Juncture knits the Channel Bone  The furious Chief discharg'd the craggy Stone  The Tendon burst beneath the pondrous Blow  And his numb'd Hand dismiss'd his useless Bow  He fell But  Ajax  his broad Shield display'd  And screen'd his Brother with the mighty Shade  Till great  Alastor  and  Mecistheus  bore  The batter'd Archer groaning to the Shore  Troy  yet found Grace before th'  Olympian  Sire  He arm'd their Hands and fill'd their Breasts with Fire  The  Greeks  repuls'd retreat behind their Wall  Or in the Trench on Heaps confus'dly fall  First of the Foe great  Hector  march'd along  With Terror cloath'd and more than mortal strong  As the bold Hound that gives the Lion chace  With beating Bosom and with eager Pace  Hangs on his Haunch or fastens on his Heels  Guards as he turns and circles as he wheels  Thus oft' the  Grecians  turn'd but still they flew  Thus following  Hector  still the hindmost slew  When flying they had pass'd the Trench profound  And many a Chief lay gasping on the Ground  Before the Ships a desp'rate Stand they made  And fir'd the Troops and call'd the Gods to aid  Fierce on his ratt'ling Chariot  Hector  came  His Eyes like  Gorgon  shot a sanguin Flame  That wither'd all their Host Like  Mars  he stood  Dire as the Monster dreadful as the God  Their strong Distress the Wife of  Jove  survey'd  Then pensive thus to War's triumphant Maid  Oh Daughter of that God whose Arm can wield  Th' avenging Bolt and shake the sable Shield  Now in this Moment of her last Despair  Shall wretched  Greece  no more confess our Care  Condemn'd to suffer the full Force of Fate  And drain the Dregs of Heav'ns relentless Hate  Gods shall one raging Hand thus level All  What Numbers fell what Numbers yet shall fall  What Pow'r Divine shall  Hector  's Wrath asswage  Still swells the Slaughter and still grows the Rage  So spoke th' imperial Regent of the Skies  To whom the Goddess with the Azure Eyes  Long since had  Hector  stain'd these Fields with Gore  Stretch'd by some  Argive  on his native Shore  But He above the Sire of Heav'n withstands  Mocks our Attempts and slights our just Demands  The stubborn God inflexible and hard  Forgets my Service and deserv'd Reward  Sav'd I for this his Fav'rite  Hercules  Son distress'd  By stern  Eurystheus  with long Labours prefs'd  He begg'd with Tears he begg'd in deep Dismay  I shot from Heav'n and gave his Arm the Day  Oh had my Wisdom known this dire Event  When to grim  Pluto  's gloomy Gates he went  The Triple Dog had never felt his Chain  Nor  Styx  been cross'd nor Hell explor'd in vain  Averse to me of all his Heav'n of Gods  At  Thetis'  Suit the partial Thund'rer nods  To grace her gloomy fierce resenting Son  My Hopes are frustrate and my  Greeks  undone  Some future Day perhaps he may be mov'd  To call his blueey'd Maid his Bestbelov'd  Haste launch thy Chariot thro' yon' Ranks to ride  My self will arm and thunder at thy side  Then Goddess say shall  Hector  glory then  That Terror of the  Greeks  that Man of Men  When  Juno  's self and  Pallas  shall appear  All dreadful in the crimson Walks of War  What mighty  Trojan  then on yonder Shore  Expiring pale and terrible no more  Shall feast the Fowls and glut the Dogs with Gore  She ceas'd and  Juno  rein'd her Steeds with Care  Heav'ns awful Empress  Saturn  's other Heir  Pallas  meanwhile her various Veil unbound  With Flow'rs adorn'd with Art immortal crown'd  The radiant Robe her sacred Fingers wove  Floats in rich Waves and spreads the Court of  Jove  Her Father's Arms her mighty Limbs invest  His Cuirass blazes on her ample Breast  The vig'rous Pow'r the trembling Car ascends  Shook by her Arm the massy Javelin bends  Huge pond'rous strong that when her Fury burns  Proud Tyrants humbles and whole Hosts o'erturns  Saturnia  lends the Lash the Coursers fly  Smooth glides the Chariot thro' the liquid Sky  Heav'nGates spontaneous open to the Pow'rs  Heav'ns golden Gates kept by the winged  Hours  Commission'd in alternate Watch to stand  The Sun's bright Portals and the Skies command  Close or unfold th' Eternal Gates of Day  Bar Heav'n with Clouds or roll those Clouds away  The sounding Hinges ring the Clouds divide  Pronedown the Steep of Heav'n their Course they guide  But  Jove  incens'd from  Ida  's Top survey'd  And thus enjoin'd the manycolour'd Maid  Thaumantia  mount the Winds and stop their Car  Against the Highest who shall wage the War  If furious yet they dare the vain Debate  Thus have I spoke and what I spake is Fate  Their Coursers crush'd beneath the Wheels shall lie  Their Car in Fragments scatter'd o'er the Sky  My Light'ning these Rebellious shall confound  And hurl them flaming headlong to the Ground  Condemn'd for ten revolving Years to weep  The Wounds impress'd by burning Thunder deep  So shall  Minerva  learn to sear our Ire  Nor dare to combate her's and Natures Sire  For  Juno  headstrong and imperious still  She claims some Title to transgress our Will  Swift as the Wind the variouscolour'd Maid  From  Ida  's Top her golden Wings display'd  To great  Olympus'  shining Gates she flies  There meets the Chariot rushing down the Skies  Restrains their Progress from the bright Abodes  And speaks the Mandate of the Sire of Gods  What Frenzy Goddesses what Rage can move  Celestial Minds to tempt the Wrath of  Jove  Desist obedient to his high Command  This is his Word and know his Word shall stand  His Light'ning your Rebellion shall confound  And hurl ye headlong flaming to the Ground  Your Horses crush'd beneath the Wheels shall lie  Your Car in Fragments scatter'd o'er the Sky  Your selves condemn'd ten rolling Years to weep  The Wounds impress'd by burning Thunder deep  So shall  Minerva  learn to fear his Ire  Nor dare to combate her's and Nature's Sire  For  Juno  headstrong and imperious still  She claims some Title to transgress his Will  But Thee what desp'rate Insolence has driv'n  To lift thy Lance against the Sire of Heav'n  Then mounting on the Pinions of the Wind  She flew and  Juno  thus her Rage resign'd  O Daughter of that God whose Arm can wield  Th'avenging Bolt and shake the dreadful Shield  No more let Beings of superior Birth  Contend with  Jove  for this low Race of Earth  Triumphant now now miserably slain  They breathe or perish as the Fates ordain  But  Jove  's high Counsels full Effect shall find  And ever constant ever rule Mankind  She spoke and backward turn'd her Steeds of Light  Adorn'd with Manes of Gold and Heav'nly bright  The  Hours  unloos'd them panting as they stood  And heap'd their Mangers with Ambrosial Food  There ty'd they rest in high Celestial Stalls  The Chariot propt against the Crystal Walls  The pensive Goddesses abash'd controul'd  Mix with the Gods and fill their Seats of Gold  And now the Thund'rer meditates his Flight  From  Ida  's Summits to th'  Olympian  Height  Swifter than Thought the Wheels instinctive fly  Flame thro' the Vast of Air and reach the Sky  'Twas  Neptune  's Charge his Coursers to unbrace  And fix the Car on its immortal Base  There stood the Chariot beaming forth its Rays  Till with a snowy Veil he screen'd the Blaze  He whose allconscious Eyes the World behold  Th' Eternal Thunderer sate thron'd in Gold  High Heav'n the Footstool of his Feet he makes  And wide beneath him all  Olympus  shakes  Trembling afar th' offending Pow'rs appear'd  Confus'd and silent for his Frown they fear'd  He saw their Soul and thus his Word imparts  Pallas  and  Juno  say why heave your Hearts  Soon was your Battel o'er Proud  Troy  retir'd  Before your Face and in your Wrath expir'd  But know whoe'er Almighty Pow'r withstand  Unmatch'd our Force unconquer'd is our Hand  Who shall the Sov'reign of the Skies controul  Not all the Gods that crown the starry Pole  Your Hearts shall tremble if our Arms we take  And each immortal Nerve with Horror shake  For thus I speak and what I speak shall stand  What Pow'r soe'er provokes our lifted Hand  On this our Hill no more shall hold his Place  Cut off and exil'd from th'Aethereal Race  Juno  and  Pallas  grieving hear the Doom  But feast their Souls on  Ilion  's Woes to come  Tho' secret Anger swell'd  Minerva  's Breast  The prudent Goddess yet her Wrath represt  But  Juno  impotent of Rage replies  What hast thou said Oh Tyrant of the Skies  Strength and Omnipotence invest thy Throne  'Tis thine to punish ours to grieve alone  For  Greece  we grieve abandon'd by her Fate  To drink the Dregs of thy unmeasur'd Hate  From Fields forbidden we submiss refrain  With Arms unaiding see our  Argives  slain  Yet grant our Counsels still their Breasts may move  Lest all should perish in the Rage of  Jove  The Goddess thus and thus the God replies  Who swells the Clouds and blackens all the Skies  The Morning Sun awak'd by loud Alarms  Shall see th' Almighty Thunderer in Arms  What Heaps of  Argives  then shall load the Plain  These radiant Eyes shall view and view in vain  Nor shall great  Hector  cease the Rage of Fight  The Navy flaming and thy  Greeks  in Flight  Ev'n till the Day when certain Fates ordain  That stern  Achilles  his  Patroclus  slain  Shall rise in Vengeance and lay waste the Plain  For such is Fate nor can'st thou turn its Course  With all thy Rage with all thy Rebel Force  Fly if thou wilt to Earth's remotest Bound  Where on her utmost Verge the Seas resound  Where curs'd  I√§petus  and  Saturn  dwell  Fast by the Brink within the Steams of Hell  No Sun e'er gilds the gloomy Horrors there  No chearful Gales refresh the lazy Air  There arm once more the bold  Titanian  Band  And arm in vain For what I will shall stand  Now deep in Ocean sunk the Lamp of Light  And drew behind the cloudy Veil of Night  The conqu'ring  Trojans  mourn his Beams decay'd  The  Greeks  rejoicing bless the friendly Shade  The Victors keep the Field and  Hector  calls  A martial Council near the NavyWalls  These to  Scamander  's Bank apart he led  Where thinly scatter'd lay the Heaps of Dead  Th' assembled Chiefs descending on the Ground  Attend his Order and their Prince surround  A massy Spear he bore of mighty Strength  Of full ten Cubits was the Lance's Length  The Point was Steel refulgent to behold  Fix'd to the Wood with circling Rings of Gold  The noble  Hector  on this Lance reclin'd  And bending forward thus reveal'd his Mind  Ye valiant  Trojans  with Attention hear  Ye  Dardan  Bands and gen'rous  Aids  give ear  This Day we hop'd would wrap in conq'ring Flame  Greece  with her Ships and crown our Toils with Fame  But Darkness now to save the Cowards falls  And guards them trembling in their wooden Walls  Obey the Night and use her peaceful Hours  Our Steeds to forage and refresh our Pow'rs  Strait from the Town be Sheep and Oxen sought  And strength'ning Bread and gen'rous Wine be brought  Wide o'er the Field highblazing to the Sky  Let num'rous Fires the absent Sun supply  The flaming Piles with plenteous Fuel raise  Till the bright Morn her purple Beam displays  Lest in the Silence and the Shades of Night  Greece  on her sable Ships attempt her Flight  Not unmolested let the Wretches gain  Their lofty Decks and safely cleave the Main  Some hostile Wound let ev'ry Dart bestow  Some lasting Token of the  Phrygian  Foe  Wounds that long hence may ask their Spouses Care  And warn their Children from a  Trojan  War  Now thro' the Circuit of our  Ilian  Wall  Let sacred Heralds sound the solemn Call  To bid the Sires with hoary Honours crown'd  And beardless Youths the Battlements surround  Firm be the Guard while distant lie our Pow'rs  And let the Matrons hang with Lights the Tow'rs  Lest under Covert of the Midnight Shade  Th' insidious Foe the naked Town invade  Suffice to Night these Orders to obey  A nobler Charge shall rowze the dawning Day  The Gods I trust shall give to  Hector  's Hand  From these detested Foes to free the Land  Who plow'd with Fates averse the wat'ry way  For  Trojan  Vulturs a predestin'd Prey  Our common Safety must be now the Care  But soon as Morning paints the Fields of Air  Sheath'd in bright Arms let ev'ry Troop engage  And the fir'd Fleet behold the Battel rage  Then then shall  Hector  and  Tydides  prove  Whose Fates are heaviest in the Scale of  Jove  To Morrow's Light oh haste the glorious Morn  Shall see his bloody Spoils in Triumph born  With this keen Javelin shall his Breast be gor'd  And prostrate Heroes bleed around their Lord  Certain as this oh might my Days endure  From Age inglorious and black Death secure  So might my Life and Glory know no bound  Like  Pallas  worship'd like the Sun renown'd  As the next Dawn the last they shall enjoy  Shall crush the  Greeks  and end the Woes of  Troy  The Leader spoke From all his Hosts around  Shouts of Applause along the Shores resound  Each from the Yoke the smoaking Steeds unty'd  And fix'd their Headstalls to his Chariotside  Fat Sheep and Oxen from the Town are led  With gen'rous Wine and allsustaining Bread  Full Hecatombs lay burning on the Shore  The Winds to Heav'n the curling Vapours bore  Ungrateful Off'ring to th' immortal Pow'rs  Whose Wrath hung heavy o'er the  Trojan  Tow'rs  Nor  Priam  nor his Sons obtain'd their Grace  Proud  Troy  they hated and her guilty Race  The Troops exulting sate in order round  And beaming Fires illumin'd all the Ground  As when the Moon refulgent Lamp of Night  O'er Heav'ns clear Azure sheds her sacred Light  When not a Breath disturbs the deep Serene  And not a Cloud o'ercasts the solemn Scene  Around her Throne the vivid Planets roll  And Stars unnumber'd gild the glowing Pole  O'er the dark Trees a yellower Verdure shed  And tip with Silver ev'ry Mountain's Head  Then shine the Vales the Rocks in Prospect rise  A Flood of Glory bursts from all the Skies  The conscious Swains rejoicing in the Sight  Eye the blue Vault and bless the useful Light  So many Flames before proud  Ilion  blaze  And lighten glimm'ring  Xanthus  with their Rays  The long Reflections of the distant Fires  Gleam on the Walls and tremble on the Spires  A thousand Piles the dusky Horrors gild  And shoot a shady Lustre o'er the Field  Full fifty Guards each flaming Pile attend  Whose umber'd Arms by fits thick Flashes send  Loud neigh the Coursers o'er their Heaps of Corn  And ardent Warriors wait the rising Morn  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Eighth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE EIGHTH BOOK  I  HOMER  like most of the  Greeks  is thought to have travell'd into  Aegypt  and brought from the Priests there not only their Learning but their manner of conveying it in Fables and Hieroglyphicks This is necessary to be consider'd by those who would thoroughly penetrate into the Beauty and Design of many Parts of this Author For whoever reflects that this was the Mode of Learning in those Times will make no doubt but there are several Mysteries both of Natural and Moral Philosophy involv'd in his Fictions which otherwise in the literal Meaning appear too trivial or irrational and it is but just when these are not plain or immediately intelligible to imagine that something of this kind may be hid under them Nevertheless as  Homer  travell'd not with a direct View of writing Philosophy or Theology so he might often use these Hieroglyphical Fables and Traditions as Embellishments of his Poetry only without taking the Pains to open their mystical Meaning to his Readers and perhaps without diving very deeply into it himself  II  VERSE  Let down our golden everlasting Chain    The various Opinions of the Ancients concerning this Passage are  collected by  Eustathius Jupiter  says  If he holds this Chain of Gold the Force of all the Gods is unable to draw him down but  that  he can draw up them the Seas and the Earth and cause the whole Universe to hang unactive  Some think that  Jupiter  signifies the  Aether  the golden Chain the  Sun  If the  Aether  did not temper the Rays of the Sun as they pass thro' it his Beams would not only drink up and exhale the Ocean in Vapours but also exhale the Moisture from the Veins of the Earth which is the Cement that holds it together by which means the whole Creation would become unactive and all its Powers be suspended  Others affirm that by this golden Chain may be meant the Days of the World's Duration  which are as it were painted by the Lustre of the Sun and follow one another in a successive Chain till they arrive at their final Period While  Jupiter  or the  Aether  which the Ancients call'd the Soul of all Things still remains unchanged  Plato  in his  Theaetetus  says that by this golden Chain is meant the Sun whose Rays enliven all Nature and cement the Parts of the Universe  The  Stoicks  will have it that by  Jupiter  is implied Destiny which overrules every thing both upon and above the Earth  Others delighted with their own Conceits imagine that  Homer  intended to represent the Excellence of Monarchy that the Sceptre ought to be sway'd by one Hand and that all the Wheels of Government should be put in Motion by one Person  But I fancy a much better Interpretation may be found for this if we allow as there is great Reason to believe that the  Aegyptians  understood the true System of the World and that  Pythagoras  first learn'd it from them They held that the Planets were kept in their Orbits by Gravitation upon the Sun which was therefore called  Jovis carcer  and sometimes by the Sun as  Macrobius  informs us is meant  Jupiter  himself We see too that the most prevailing Opinion of Antiquity fixes it to the  Sun  so that I think it will be no strained Interpretation to say that by the Inability of the Gods to pull  Jupiter  out of his Place with this  Catena  may be understood  the superior attractive Force of the Sun whereby he continues unmoved and draws all the rest of the Planets toward him  III  VERSE  Low in the dark Tartarean Gulf  c  This Opinion of  Tartarus  the Place of Torture for the Impious after Death might also be taken from the  Aegyptians  for it seems not improbable as some Writers have observed that some Tradition might then be spread in the Eastern Parts of the World of the Fall of the Angels the Punishment of the Damned and other sacred Truths which were afterwards more fully explain'd and taught by the Prophets and Apostles These  Homer  seems to allude to in this and other Passages as where  Vulcan  is said to be precipitated from Heaven in the first Book where  Jupiter  threatens  Mars  with  Tartarus  in the fifth and where the Daemon of Discord is cast out of Heaven in the nineteenth  Virgil  has translated a part of these Lines into the sixth  Aeneid  Tum Tartarus ipse  Bis patet in praeceps tantum tenditque sub umbras  Quantus ad aethereum coeli suspectus Olympum  And  Milton  in his first Book  As far remov'd from God and Light of Heav'n  As from the Centre thrice to th' utmost Pole  It may not be unpleasing just to observe the Gradation in these three great Poets as if they had vied with each other in extending this Idea of the Depth of Hell  Homer  says as far  Virgil  twice as far  Milton  thrice  IV  VERSE  Th' Almighty spoke    Homer  in this whole Passage plainly shews his Belief of one supreme omnipotent  God whom he introduces with a Majesty and Superiority worthy the great Ruler of the Universe Accordingly  Justin Martyr  cites it as a Proof of our Author's attributing the Power and Government of all things to one First God whose Divinity is so far superior to all other Deities that if compared to him they may be rank'd among Mortals  Admon ad Gentes  Upon this Account and with the Authority of that learned Father I have ventur'd to apply to  Jupiter  in this Place such Appellatives as are suitable to the supreme Deity a Practice I would be cautious of using in many others where the Notions and Descriptions of our Author must be own'd to be unworthy of the Divinity  V  VERSE  O first and greatest  c  Homer  is not only to be admir'd for keeping up the Characters of his Heroes but for adapting his Speeches to the Characters of his Gods Had  Juno  here given the Reply she would have begun with some Mark of Resentment but  Pallas  is all Submission  Juno  would probably have contradicted him but  Pallas  only begs leave to be sorry for those whom she must not assist  Juno  would have spoken with the Prerogative of a Wife but  Pallas  makes her Address with the Obsequiousness of a prudent Daughter  Eustathius  VI  VERSE  For on this dreadful Day The Fate of Fathers Wives and Infants lay    It may be necessary to explain why the  Trojans  thought themselves obliged to fight in order to defend their Wives and Children One would think they might have kept within their Walls the  Grecians  made no Attempt to batter them neither were they invested and the Country was open on all sides except towards the Sea to give them Provisions The most natural thought is that they and their Auxiliaries being very numerous could not subsist but from a large Country about them and perhaps not  without the Sea and the Rivers where the  Greeks  encamp'd That in time the  Greeks  would have surrounded them and block'd up every Avenue to their Town That they thought themselves obliged to defend the Country with all the Inhabitants of it and that indeed at first this was rather a War between two Nations and became not properly a Siege till afterwards  VII  VERSE  The Gates unfolding  c  There is a wonderful Sublimity in these Lines one sees in the Description the Gates of a warlike City thrown open and an Army pouring forth and one hears the Trampling of Men and Horses rushing to the Battel  These Verses are as  Eustathius  observes only a Repetition of a former Passage which shews that the Poet was particularly pleas'd with them and that he was not ashamed of a Repetition when he could not express the same Image more happily than he had already done  VIII  VERSE  The sacred Light    Homer  describing the Advance of the Day from Morning till Noon calls it  or sacred says  Eustathius  who gives this Reason for it because that Part of the Day was allotted to Sacrifice and religious Worship  IX  VERSE  The Sire of Gods his golden Scales suspends    This Figure representing God as weighing the Destinies of Men in his Balances was first made use of in holy Writ In the Book of  Job  which is acknowledg'd to be one of the most ancient of all the Scriptures he prays to be  weighed in an even Balance that God may know his Integrity Daniel  declares from God to  Belshazzar thou art weighed in the Balances and sound light  And  Proverbs  Ch ‚Ñ£  A just  Weight and Balance are the Lord's  Our Author has it again in the twenty second Iliad and it appear'd so beautiful to succeeding Poets that  Aeschylus  as we are told by  Plutarch de aud Poetis  writ a whole Tragedy upon this Foundation which he called  Psychostasia  or the  weighing of Souls  In this he introduced  Thetis  and  Aurora  standing on either side of  Jupiter  's Scales and praying each for her Son while the Heroes fought  It has been copied by  Virgil  in the last  Aeneid  Jupiter ipse duas aequato examine lances  Sustinet fata imponit diversa duorum  Quem damnet labor quo vergat pondere lethum  I cannot agree with Madam  Dacier  that these Verses are inferior to  Homer  's but  Macrobius  observes with some Colour that the Application of them is not so just as in our Author for  Virgil  had made  Juno  say before that  Turnus  would certainly perish  Nunc Juvenem imparibus video concurrere Fatis  Parcarumque dies vis inimica propinquat  So that there was less reason for weighing his Fate with that of  Aeneas  after that Declaration  Scaliger  trifles miserably when he says  Juno  might have learn'd this from the Fates tho'  Jupiter  did not know it before he consulted them by weighing the Scales But  Macrobius  's Excuse in behalf of  Virgil  is much better worth regard I shall transcribe it entire as it is perhaps the finest Period in all that Author  Haec alia ignoscenda Virgilio qui studii circa Homerum nimietate excedit modum Et revera non poterat non in aliquibus minor videri qui per omnem po√´sim suam hoc uno est praecipue usus Archetypo Acriter enim in Homerum oculos intendit ut aemularetur  ejus non modo magnitudinem sed simplicitatem praesentiam orationis tacitam majestatem Hinc diversarum inter Heroas suos personarum varia magnificatio hinc Deorum interpositio hinc autoritas fabulosa hinc affectuum naturalium expressio hinc monumentorum persecutio hinc parabolarum exaggeratio hinc torrentis orationis sonitus hinc rerum singularum cum splendore fastigium  Sat  l  c  As to the Ascent or Descent of the Scales  Eustathius  explains it in this manner The Descent of the Scale toward Earth signifies Unhappiness and Death the Earth being the Place of Misfortune and Mortality the Mounting of it signifies Prosperity and Life the superior Regions being the Seats of Felicity and Immortality  Milton  has admirably improved upon this fine Fiction and with an Alteration agreeable to a Christian Poet He feigns that the Almighty weighed  Satan  in such Scales but judiciously makes this difference that the Mounting of his Scale denoted ill Success whereas the same Circumstance in  Homer  points the Victory His Reason was because Satan was immortal and therefore the sinking of his Scale could not signify Death but the mounting of it did his  Lightness  conformable to the Expression we just now cited from  Daniel  Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid Fray  Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales yet seen  Between  Astraea  and the  Scorpion  Sign  Wherein all things created first he weigh'd  The pendulous round Earth with balanc'd Air  In counterpoise now ponders all Events  Battels and Realms In these he put two Weights  The Sequel each of Parting and of Fight  The latter quick upflew and kick'd the Beam  I believe upon the whole this may with Justice be preferr'd both to  Homer  's and  Virgil  's on account of the beautiful Allusion to the Sign of  Libra  in the Heavens and that noble Imagination of the Maker's weighing the whole World at the Creation and all the Events of it since so correspondent at once to Philosophy and to the Style of the Scriptures  X  VERSE  Then  Jove  from  Ida  's Top  c  This Distress of the  Greeks  being suppos'd  Jupiter  's Presence was absolutely necessary to bring them into it for the inferior Gods that were friendly to  Greece  were rather more in Number and superior in Force to those that favour'd  Troy  and the Poet had shew'd before when both Armies were left to themselves that the  Greeks  could overcome the  Trojans  besides it would have been an indelible Reflection upon his Countrymen to have been vanquish'd by a smaller Number Therefore nothing less than the immediate Interposition of  Jupiter  was requisite which shews the wonderful Address of the Poet in his Machinery  Virgil  makes  Turnus  say in the last  Aeneid  Dii me terrent Jupiter hostis  And indeed this Defeat of the  Greeks  seems more to their Glory than all their Victories since even  Jupiter  's Omnipotence could with difficulty effect it  XI  VERSE  Thick Light'nings flash    This Notion of  Jupiter  's declaring against the  Greeks  by Thunder and Lightning is drawn says  Dacier  from Truth itself  Sam    Ch    And as  Samuel  was offering up the Burntoffering the  Philistines  drew near to Battel against  Israel  But the Lord thunder'd with a great Thunder on that Day upon the  Philistines  and discomfited them and they were smitten before  Israel  To which may be added that in the  th  Psalm  The Lord thunder'd in the Heavens and the Highest gave his Voice Hailstones and Coals of Fire Yea he sent out his Arrows and scatter'd them he shot out Lightnings and discomfited them  Upon occasion of the various Successes given by  Jupiter  now to  Grecians  now to  Trojans  whom he suffers to perish interchangeably some have fancy'd this Supposition injurious  to the Nature of the Sovereign Being as representing him variable or inconstant in his Rewards and Punishments It may be answer'd that as God makes use of some People to chastise others and none are totally void of Crimes he often decrees to punish those very Persons for lesser Sins whom he makes his Instruments to punish others for greater so purging them from their own Iniquities before they become worthy to be Chastisers of other Men's This is the Case of the  Greeks  here whom  Jupiter  permits to suffer many ways tho' he had destin'd them to revenge the Rape of  Helen  upon  Troy  There is a History in the Bible just of this Nature In the  th  Chapter of  Judges  the  Israelites  are commanded to make War against the Tribe of  Benjamin  to punish a Rape on the Wife of a  Levite  committed in the City of  Gibeah  When they have laid Siege to the Place the  Benjamites  sally upon them with so much Vigour that a great Number of the Besiegers are destroy'd they are astonish'd at these Defeats as having undertaken the Siege in Obedience to the Command of God But they are still order'd to persist till at length they burn the City and almost extinguish the Race of  Benjamin  There are many Instances in Scripture where Heaven is represented to change its Decrees according to the Repentance or Relapses of Men  Hezechias  is order'd to prepare for Death and afterwards fifteen Years are added to his Life It is foretold to  Achab  that he shall perish miserably and then upon his Humiliation God defers the Punishment till the Reign of his Successor  c  I must confess that in comparing Passages of the sacred Books with our Author one ought to use a great deal of Caution and Respect If there are some Places in Scripture that in Compliance to human Understanding represent the Deity as acting by Motives like those of Men there are infinitely more that shew him as he is all Perfection Justice and Beneficence whereas in  Homer  the general Tenor of the Poem represents  Jupiter  as a Being subject to Passion Inequality and Imperfection I think M  Dacier  has carry'd these Comparisons too far and is too zealous to defend him upon every occasion in the Points of Theology and Doctrine  XII  VERSE  But  Diomed  beheld    The whole following Story of  Nestor  and  Diomed  is admirably contriv'd to raise the Character of the latter He maintains his Intrepidity and ventures singly to bring off the old Hero notwithstanding the general Consternation The Art of  Homer  will appear wonderful to any one who considers all the Circumstances of this Part and by what degrees he reconciles this Flight of  Diomed  to that undaunted Character The Thunderbolt falls just before him that is not enough  Nestor  advises him to submit to Heaven this does not prevail he cannot bear the Thoughts of Flight  Nestor  drives back the Chariot without his Consent he is again inclined to go on till  Jupiter  again declares against him These two Heroes are very artfully placed together because none but a Person of  Nestor  's Authority and Wisdom could have prevailed upon  Diomed  to retreat A younger Warrior could not so well in Honour have given him such Counsel and from no other would he have taken it To cause  Diomed  to fly required both the Counsel of  Nestor  and the Thunder of  Jupiter  XIII  VERSE  Oh turn and save  c  There is a Decorum in making  Diomed  call  Ulysses  to the Assistance of his Brother Sage for who better knew the Importance of  Nestor  than  Ulysses  But the Question is whether  Ulysses  did not drop  Nestor  as one great Minister would do another and fancy'd He should be the wise Man when the other was gone  Eustathius  indeed is of Opinion that  Homer  meant not to cast any Aspersion on  Ulysses  nor would have given him so many noble Appellations when in the same Breath he reflected upon his Courage But perhaps the contrary Opinion may not be ill grounded if we observe the manner of  Homer  's Expression  Diomed  call'd  Ulysses  but  Ulysses  was deaf he  did not hear  and whereas the Poet says of the rest that they had  not the  Hardiness  to stay  Ulysses  is not only said to  fly  but  to make  violent Haste  towards the Navy  Ovid  at least understood it thus for he puts an Objection in  Ajax  's Mouth  Metam  drawn from this Passage which would have been improper had not  Ulysses  made more speed than he ought since  Ajax  on the same occasion retreated as well as he  XIV  VERSE  The thirsty Fury of my flying Spear    Homer  has Figures of that Boldness which it is impossible to preserve in another Language The Words in the Original are  Hector  shall see if my Spear is mad in my Hands  The Translation pretends only to have taken some Shadow of this in animating the Spear giving it  Fury  and strengthning the Figure with the Epithet  thirsty  XV  VERSE  And now had Death  c  Eustathius  observes how wonderfully  Homer  still advances the Character of  Diomed  when all the Leaders of  Greece  were retreated the Poet says that had not  Jupiter  interposed  Diomed  alone had driven the whole Army of  Troy  to their Walls and with his single Hand have vanquish'd an Army  XVI  VERSE  The Ground before him flam'd    Here is a Battel describ'd with so much Fire that the warmest Imagination of an able Painter cannot add a Circumstance to heighten the Surprize or Horror of the Picture Here is what they call the  Fracas  or Hurry and Tumult of the Action in the utmost Strength of Colouring upon the Foreground and the  Repose  or  Solemnity  at a distance with great Propriety and Judgment First in the  Eloignement  we behold  Jupiter  in golden Armour surrounded with Glory upon the Summit  of Mount  Ida  his Chariot and Horses by him wrapt in dark Clouds In the next Place below the Horizon appear the Clouds rolling and opening thro' which the Lightning flashes in the Face of the  Greeks  who are flying on all sides  Agamemnon  and the rest of the Commanders in the Rear in Postures of Astonishment Towards the middle of the Piece we see  Nestor  in the utmost Distress one of his Horses having a deadly Wound in the Forehead with a Dart which makes him rear and writhe and disorder the rest  Nestor  is cutting the Harness with his Sword while  Hector  advances driving full speed  Diomed  interposes in an Action of the utmost Fierceness and Intrepidity These two Heroes make the principal Figures and Subject of the Picture A burning Thunderbolt falls just before the Feet of  Diomed  's Horses from whence a horrid Flame of Sulphur arises  This is only a Specimen of a single Picture design'd by  Homer  out of the many with which he has beautified the Iliad And indeed every thing is so natural and so lively that the HistoryPainter would generally have no more to do but to delincate the Forms and copy the Circumstances just as he finds them described by this great Master We cannot therefore wonder at what has been so often said of  Homer  's furnishing Ideas to the most famous Painters of Antiquity  XVII  VERSE  The solid Skies    Homer  sometimes calls the Heavens  Brazen  and  Jupiter  's Palace  One might think from hence that the Notion of the  Solidity of the Heavens  which is indeed very ancient had been generally receiv'd The Scripture uses Expressions agreeable to it  A Heaven of Brass  and the  Firmament  XVIII  VERSE  Heard ye the Voice of  Jove  It was a noble and effectual manner of encouraging the Troops by telling them that God was surely on their side This it seems has been an ancient Practice as it has been used in modern Times by those who never read  Homer  XIX  VERSE  Now  Xanthus Aethon c  There have been those who blame this manner introduced by  Homer  and copied by  Virgil  of making a Hero address his Discourse to his Horses  Virgil  has given human Sentiments to the Horse of  Pallas  and made him weep for the Death of his Master In the tenth Aeneid  Mezentius  speaks to his Horse in the same manner as  Hector  does here Nay he makes  Turnus  utter a Speech to his Spear and invoke it as a Divinity All this is agreeable to the Art of Oratory which makes it a Precept to speak to every thing and make every thing speak of which there are innumerable applauded Instances in the most celebrated Orators Nothing can be more spirited and affecting than this Enthusiasm of  Hector  who in the Transport of his Joy at the Sight of  Diomed  flying before him breaks out into this Apostrophe to his Horses as he is pursuing And indeed the Air of this whole Speech is agreeable to a Man drunk with the Hopes of Success and promising himself a Series of Conquests He has in Imagination already forced the  Grecian  Retrenchments set the Fleet in Flames and destroyed the whole Army  XX  VERSE  For this my Spouse    There is says M  Dacier  a secret Beauty in this Passage which perhaps will only be perceiv'd by those who are particularly vers'd in  Homer  He describes a Princess so tender in her Love to her Husband that she takes care constantly to go and meet him at his Return from every Battel and in the Joy of seeing him again runs to his Horses and gives them Bread and Wine as a Testimony of her Acknowledgment to them for bringing him back Notwithstanding the Raillery that may be past upon this Remark I take a Lady to be the best Judge to what Actions a Woman may be carry'd by Fondness to her Husband  Homer  does not expresly mention Bread but Wheat and the Commentators are not agreed whether she gave them  Wine to drink or steep'd the Grain in it  Hobbes  translates it as I do  XXI  VERSE Vulcanian  Arms the Labour of a God    These were the Arms that  Diomed  had received from  Glaucus  and a Prize worthy  Hector  being as we were told in the sixth Book entirely of Gold I do not remember any other Place where the Shield of  Nestor  is celebrated by  Homer  XXII  VERSE  Yet  Aegae Helice  These were two Cities of  Greece  in which  Neptune  was particularly honoured and in each of which there was a Temple and Statue of him  XXIII  VERSE  Where the deep Trench    That is to say the Space betwixt the Ditch and the Wall was filled with the Men and Chariots of the  Greeks Hector  not having yet past the Ditch  Eustathius  XXIV  VERSE  His Purple Robe    Agamemnon  here addresses himself to the Eyes of the Army his Voice might have been lost in the Confusion of a Retreat but the Motion of this purple Robe could not fail of attracting the Regards of the Soldiers His Speech also is very remarkable he first endeavours to shame them into Courage and then begs of  Jupiter  to give that Courage Success at least so far as not to suffer the whole Army to be destroyed  Eustathius  XXV  VERSE  High on the midmost Bark  c  We learn from hence the Situation of the Ships of  Ulysses Achilles  and  Ajax  The two latter being the strongest Heroes of the Army were placed to defend either end of the Fleet as most obnoxious to the Incursions or Surprizes of the Enemy and  Ulysses  being the ablest Head was allotted the middle Place as more safe and convenient for the Council and that he might be the nearer if any Emergency required his Advice  Eustathius Spondanus  XXVI  VERSE  Thus pray'd the King and Heav'ns great Father heard    It is to be observ'd in general that  Homer  hardly ever makes his Heroes succeed unless they have first offer'd a Prayer to Heaven Whether they engage in War go upon an Embassy undertake a Voyage in a word whatever they enterprize they almost always supplicate some God and whenever we find this omitted we may expect some Adversity to befall them in the Course of the Story  XXVII  VERSE  The Eagle sacred Bird    Jupiter  upon the Prayers of  Agamemnon  sends an Omen to encourage the  Greeks  The Application of it is obvious The Eagle signified  Hector  the Fawn denoted the Fear and Flight of the  Greeks  and being drop'd at the Altar of  Jupiter  shew'd that they would be saved by the Protection of that God The word  says  Eustathius  has a great Significancy in this Place The  Greeks  having just received this happy Omen from  Jupiter  were offering Oblations to him under the Title of the  Father of Oracles  There may also be a natural Reason for this Appellation as  Jupiter  signified the  Aether  which is the Vehicle of all Sounds  Virgil  has a fine Imitation of this Passage but diversify'd with many more Circumstances where he make  Juturna  shew a Prodigy of the like Nature to encourage the  Latins Aen    Namque volans rubr√¢ sulvus Jovis ales in aethr√¢  Litoreas agitabat aves turbamque sonantem  Agminis aligeri subito cum lapsus ad undas  Cycnum excellentem pedibus rapit improbus uncis  Arrexere animos Itali cunctaeque volucres  Convertunt clamore fugam mirabile visu  Aetheraque obscurant pennis hostemque per auras  Fact√¢ nube premunt donec vi victus ipso  Pondere defecit praedamque ex unguibus ales  Projecit fluvio penitusque in nubila fugit  XXVIII  VERSE Tydides  first    Diomed  as we have before seen was the last that retreated from the Thunder of  Jupiter  he is now the first that returns to the Battel It is worth while to observe the Behaviour of the Hero upon this Occasion He retreats with the utmost Reluctancy and advances with the greatest Ardour he flies with greater Impatience to meet danger than he could before to put himself in Safety  Eustathius  XXIX  VERSE  Secure behind the  Telamonian  Shield    Eustathius  observes that  Teucer  being an excellent Archer and using only the Bow could not wear any Arms which would incumber him and render him less expedite in his Archery  Homer  to secure him from the Enemy represents him as standing behind  Ajax  's Shield and shooting from thence Thus the Poet gives us a new Circumstance of a Battel and tho'  Ajax  atchieves nothing himself he maintains a Superiority over  Teucer Ajax  may be said to kill these  Trojans  with the Arrows of  Teucer  There is also a wonderful Tenderness in the Simile with which he illustrates the Retreat of  Teucer  behind the Shield of  Ajax  Such tender Circumstances soften the Horrors of a Battel and diffuse a Dawn of Serenity over the Soul of the Reader  XXX  VERSE  Great  Agamemnon  views    Eustathius  observes that  Homer  would here teach the Duty of a General in a Battel He must observe the Behaviour of his Soldiers He must honour the Hero reproach the Coward reduce the disorderly and for the Encouragement of the deserving he must promise Rewards that Desert in Arms may not only be paid with Glory  XXXI  VERSE  Sprung from an Alien's Bed    Agamemnon  here in the Height of his Commendations of  Teucer  tells him of his spurious Birth This says  Eustathius  was reckon'd no Disgrace among the Ancients nothing being more common than for Heroes of old to take their Female Captives to their Beds and as such Captives were then given for a Reward of Valour and as a Matter of Glory it could be no Reproach to be descended from them Thus  Teucer  says  Eustathius  was descended from  Telamon  and  Hesione  the Sister of  Priam  a Female Captive  XXXII  VERSE  This Dog of  Troy  This is literal from the  Greek  and I have ventured it as no improper Expression of the Rage of  Teucer  for having been so often disappointed in his Aim and of his Passion against that Enemy who had so long prevented all the Hopes of the  Grecians Milton  was not scrupulous of imitating even these which the modern Refiners call unmannerly Strokes of our Author who knew to what Extreams human Passions might proceed and was not ashamed to copy them He has put this very Expression into the Mouth of God himself who upon beholding the Havock which  Sin  and  Death  made in the World is moved in his Indignation to cry out  See with what Heat these Dogs of Hell advance  XXXIII  VERSE  He miss'd the Mark    These Words says  Eustathius  are very artfully inserted the Reader might wonder why so skilful an Archer should so often miss his Mark and it was necessary that  Teucer  should miss  Hector  because  Homer  could not falsify the History This Difficulty he removes by the Intervention of  Apollo  who wafts the Arrow aside from him The Poet does not tell us that this was done by the Hand of a God till the Arrow of  Teucer  came so near  Hector  as to kill his Charioteer which made some such Contrivance necessary  XXXIV  VERSE  As fullblown Poppies    This Simile is very beautiful and exactly represents the manner of  Gorgythion  's Death There is such a Sweetness in the Comparison that it makes us pity the Youth's Fall and almost feel his Wound  Virgil  has apply'd it to the Death of  Euryalus  Inque humeros cervix collapsa recumbit  Purpureus veluti cum flos succisus aratro  Languescit moriens lassove papavera collo  Demisere caput pluvia cum forte gravantur  This is finely improved by the  Roman  Author with the Particulars of  succisus aratro  and  lasso collo  But it may on the other hand be observ'd in the favour of  Homer  that the Circumstance of the Head being oppressed and weigh'd down by the Helmet is so remarkably just that it is a wonder  Virgil  omitted it and the rather because he had particularly taken notice before that it was the Helmet of  Euryalus  which occasion'd the Discovery and unfortunate Death of this young Hero and his Friend  One may make a general Observation that  Homer  in those Comparisons that breath an Air of Tenderness is very exact and adapts them in every Point to the Subject which he  is to illustrate But in other Comparisons where he is to inspire the Soul with sublime Sentiments he gives a Loose to his Fancy and does not regard whether the Images exactly correspond I take the Reason of it to be this In the first the Copy must be like the Original to cause it to affect us the Glass needs only to return the real Image to make it beautiful whereas in the other a Succession of noble Ideas will cause the like Sentiments in the Soul and tho' the Glass should enlarge the Image it only strikes us with such Thoughts as the Poet intended to raise sublime and great  XXXV  VERSE  There where the Juncture knits the Channel Bone    Hector  struck  Teucer  it seems just about the Articulation of the Arm with the Shoulder which cut the Tendon or wounded it so that the Arm lost its Force This is a true Description of the Effect of such a Blow  XXXVI  VERSE  As the bold Hound that gives the Lion chace    This Simile is the justest imaginable and gives the most lively Picture of the manner in which the  Grecians  fled and  Hector  pursued them still slaughtering the hindmost  Gratius  and  Oppian  have given us particular Descriptions of those sort of Dogs of prodigious Strength and Size which were employ'd to hunt and tear down wild Beasts To one of these fierce Animals he compares  Hector  and one cannot but observe his Care not to disgrace his  Grecian  Countrymen by an unworthy Comparison Tho' he is obliged to represent them flying he makes them fly like Lions and as they fly turn frequently back upon their Pursuer so that it is hard to say if they or he be in the greater Danger On the contrary when any of the  Grecian  Heroes pursue the  Trojans  it is He that is the Lion and the Flyers are but Sheep or trembling Deer  XXXVII  VERSE  The stubborn God inflexible and hard    It must be owned that this Speech of  Minerva  against  Jupiter  shocks the Allegory more than perhaps any in the Poem Unless the Deities may sometimes be thought to mean no more than Beings that presided over those Parts of Nature or those Passions and Faculties of the Mind Thus as  Venus  suggests unlawful as well as lawful Desires so  Minerva  may be described as the Goddess not only of Wisdom but of Craft that is both of true and false Wisdom So the Moral of  Minerva  's speaking rashly of  Jupiter  may be that the wisest of finite Beings is liable to Passion and Indiscretion as the Commentators have already observ'd  XXXVIII  VERSE  What mighty  Trojan  then on yonder Shore    She means  Hector  whose Death the Poet makes her foresee is such a lively manner as if the Image of the Hero lay bleeding before her This Picture is noble and agreeable to the Observation we formerly made of  Homer  's Method of Prophecying in the Spirit of Poetry  XXXIX  VERSE  Floats in rich Waves    The  Greek  word is    pours  the Veil on the Pavement I must just take Notice that here is a Repetition of the same beautiful Verses which the Author had used in the fifth Book  XL  VERSE  Smooth glides the Chariot  c  One would almost think  Homer  made his Gods and Goddesses descend from  Olympus  only to mount again and mount only to descend again he is so remarkably delighted with the Descriptions  of their Horses and their manner of Flight We have no less than three of these in the present Book  XLI  VERSE  For  Juno  headstrong and imperious still She claims  c  Eustathius  observes here if a good Man does us a Wrong we are justly angry at it but if it proceeds from a bad one it is no more than we expected we are not at all surprized and we bear it with Patience  There are many such Passages as these in  Homer  which glance obliquely at the Fair Sex and  Jupiter  is here forced to take upon himself the severe Husband to teach  Juno  the Duty of a Wife  XLII  VERSE  But thee what desp'rate Insolence    It is observable that  Homer  generally makes his Messengers divine as well as human very punctual in delivering their Messages in the very Words of the Persons who commission'd them  Iris  however in the Close of her Speech has ventur'd to go beyond her Instructions and all Rules of Decorum by adding these Expressions of bitter Reproach to a Goddess of superior Rank The Words of the Original  are too gross to be literally translated  XLIII  VERSE Juno  her Rage resign'd    Homer  never intended to give us the Picture of a good Wife in the Description of  Juno  She obeys  Jupiter  but it is a forced Obedience She submits rather to the Governor than to the Husband and is more afraid of his Lightning than his Commands  Her Behaviour in this Place is very natural to a Person under a Disappointment She had set her Heart upon preferring the  Greeks  but failing in that Point she assumes an Air of Indifference and says whether they live or die she is unconcern'd  XLIV  VERSE  They breathe or perish as the Fates ordain    The Translator has turn'd this Line in Compliance to an old Observation upon  Homer  which  Macrobius  has written and several others have since fallen into They say he was so great a Fatalist as not so much as to name the word  Fortune  in all his Works but constantly  Fate  instead of it This Remark seems curious enough and indeed does agree with the general Tenor and Doctrine of this Poet but unluckily it is not true the Word which they have proscribed being imply'd in the Original of this ‚Ñ£    XLV  VERSE  And fix the Car on its immortal Base    It is remark'd by  Eustathius  that the word  signifies not only  Altars  but  Pedestals  or  Bases  of Statues  c  I think our Language will bear this literally tho' M  Dacier  durst not venture it in the  French  The Solemnity with which this Chariot of  Jupiter  is set up by the Hands of a God and cover'd with a fine Veil makes it easy enough to imagine that this Distinction also might be shewn it  XLVI  VERSE Juno  and  Pallas  In the beginning of this Book  Juno  was silent and  Minerva  reply'd Here says  Eustathius Homer  makes  Juno  reply with great Propriety to both their Characters  Minerva  resents the Usage of  Jupiter  but the Reverence she bears to her Father and her King keeps her silent she has not less Anger than  Juno  but more Reason  Minerva  there spoke with all the Submission and Deference that was owing from a Child to a Father or from a Subject to a King but  Juno  is more free with her Husband she is angry and lets him know it by the first word she utters  Juno  here repeats the same Words which had been us'd by  Minerva  to  Jupiter  near the beginning of this Book What is there utter'd by Wisdom herself and approv'd by him is here spoken by a Goddess who as  Homer  tells us at this very time imprudently manifested her Passion and whom  Jupiter  answers with Anger To deal fairly I cannot defend this in my Author any more than some other of his Repetitions as when  Ajax  in the fifteenth Iliad ‚Ñ£ uses the same Speech word for word to encourage the  Greeks  which  Agamemnon  had made in the fifth ‚Ñ£ I think it equally an Extreme to vindicate all the Repetitions of  Homer  and to excuse none However  Eustathius  very ingeniously excuses this by saying that the same Speeches become entirely different by the different manner of introducing them  Minerva  address'd herself to  Jupiter  with Words full of Respect but  Juno  with Terms of Resentment This says he shews the Effect of opening our Speeches with Art It prejudices the Audience in our favour and makes us speak to Friends whereas the Auditor naturally denies that Favour which the Orator does not seem to ask so that what he delivers tho' it has equal Merit labours under this Disadvantage that his Judges are his Enemies  XLVII  VERSE  Nor shall great  Hector  cease  c  Here says  Eustathius  the Poet prepares the Reader for what is to succeed he gives us the Outlines of his Piece which he is to fill up in the Progress of the Poem This is so far from cloying the Reader's Appetite that it raises it and makes him desirous to see the Picture drawn in its full length  XLVIII  VERSE  Ye valiant  Trojans c  Eustathius  observes that  Hector  here speaks like a Soldier He bears a Spear not a Sceptre in his Hand he harangues like a Warrior but like a Victor he seems to be too much pleased with himself and in this Vein of Selfflattery he promises a compleat Conquest over the  Greeks  XLIX  VERSE  And let the Matrons    I have been more observant of the Decorum in this Line than my Author himself He calls the Women  an Epithet of scandalous Import upon which  Porphyry  and the  Greek  Scholiast have said but too much I know no Man that has yet had the Impudence to translate that Remark in regard of which it is Politeness to imitate the Barbarians and say  Graecum est non legitur  For my part I leave it as a Motive to some very curious Persons of both Sexes to study the  Greek  Language  L  VERSE  Full Hecatombs  c  The six Lines that follow being a Translation of four in the Original are added from the Authority of  Plato  in Mr  Barnes  his Edition That Author cites them in his second  Alcibiades  There is no doubt of their being genuine but the Question is only whether they are rightly placed here I shall not pretend to decide upon a Point which will doubtless be the Speculation of future Criticks  LI  VERSE  As when the Moon  c  This Comparison is inferior to none in  Homer  It is the most beautiful Nightpiece that can be found in Poetry He presents you with a Prospect of the Heavens the Seas and the Earth The Stars shine the Air is serene the World enlighten'd and the Moon mounted in Glory  Eustathius  remarks that  does not signify the Moon at full for then the Light of the Stars is diminish'd or lost in the greater Brightness of the Moon And others correct the word  to  for  but this Criticism is forced and I see no Necessity why the Moon may not be said to be bright tho' it is not in the full A Poet is not obliged to speak with the Exactness of Philosophy but with the Liberty of Poetry  LII  VERSE  A thousand Piles    Homer  in his Catalogue of the  Grecian  Ships tho' he does not recount expresly the Number of the  Greeks  has given some Hints from whence the Sum of their Army may be collected But in the same Book where he gives an Account of the  Trojan  Army and relates the Names of the Leaders and Nations of the Auxiliaries he says nothing by which we may infer the Number of the Army of the besieged To supply therefore that Omission he has taken occasion by this Piece of Poetical Arithmetick to inform his Reader that the  Trojan  Army amounted to fifty thousand That the Assistant Nations are to be included herein appears from what  Dolon  says in  l  that the Auxiliaries were encamped that Night with the  Trojans  This Passage gives me occasion to animadvert upon a Mistake of a modern Writer and another of my own The  Abb√® Terasson  in a late Treatise against  Homer  is under a grievous Error in saying that all the Forces of  Troy  and the Auxiliaries cannot be reasonably suppos'd from  Homer  to be above ten thousand Men He had entirely overlook'd this Place which says there were a thousand Fires and fifty Men at each of them See my Observation on the second Book where these Fires by a slip of my Memory are called Funeral Piles I should be glad it were the greatest Error I have committed in these Notes  LIII  VERSE  The Coursers o'er their Heaps of Corn    I durst not take the same Liberty with M  Dacier  who has omitted this Circumstance and does not mention the Horses at all In the following Line the last of the Book  Homer  has given to the  Morning  the Epithet  fairhaired  or  brightthroned  I have already taken notice in the Preface of the Method of translating the Epithets of  Homer  and must add here that it is often only the Uncertainty the Moderns lie under of the true genuine Signification of an  ancient word which causes the many various Constructions of it So that it is probable the Author's own Words at the time he used them never meant half so many things as we translate them into Madam  Dacier  generally observes one Practice as to these throughout her Version She renders almost every such Epithet in  Greek  by two or three in  French  from a fear of losing the least part of its Significance This perhaps may be excusable in Prose tho' at best it makes the whole much more verbose and tedious and is rather like writing a Dictionary than rendring an Author But in Verse every Reader knows such a Redoubling of Epithets would not be tolerable A Poet has therefore only to chuse that which most agrees with the Tenor and main Intent of the particular Passage or with the Genius of Poetry itself  It is plain that too scrupulous an Adherence to many of these gives the Translation an exotic pedantic and whimsical Air which it is not to be imagined the Original ever had To call a Hero the  great Artificer of Flight  the  swift of Foot  or the  Horsetamer  these give us Ideas of little Peculiarities when in the Author's Time they were Epithets used only in general to signify Alacrity Agility and Vigor A common Reader would imagine from these servile Versions that  Diomed  and  Achilles  were FootRacers and  Hector  a HorseCourser rather than that any of them were Heroes A Man shall be call'd a faithful Translator for rendring  in  English swiftfooted  but laugh'd at if he should translate
