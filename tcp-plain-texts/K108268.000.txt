 REMARKS ON THE USES OF THE DEFINITIVE ARTICLE IN THE GREEK TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT  REMARKS ON THE USES OF THE DEFINITIVE ARTICLE IN THE GREEK TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT CONTAINING MANY NEW PROOFS OF THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST FROM PASSAGES WHICH ARE WRONGLY TRANSLATED IN THE COMMON ENGLISH VERSION  BY GRANVILLE SHARP ESQ  TO WHICH IS ADDED A PLAIN MATTEROFFACT ARGUMENT FOR THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST BY THE EDITOR  DURHAM PRINTED AND SOLD BY L PENNINGTON  ADVERTISEMENT  THE first part of the following Remarks on the uses of the definitive article in the Greek Text of the New Testament was printed in the second Fasciculus of the Museum Oxoniense A Supplement to the Re∣marks was at the same time promised to be published in the third Fasciculus of the Museum But as many learned friends concurred with the Editor in thinking that the Remarks contain a very valuable accession to the evidences of Christ's divinity he was unwilling to detain the Supplement which exemplifies the Rules of the Remarks any longer from the publick and has there∣fore prevailed on Mr Sharp to permit him to publish it with the Remarks He earnestly recommends them both to Mr Wakefield's most deliberate consideration  To Mr Sharp's Remarks and Supplement he has subjoined a plain historical proof of the divinity of Christ founded on  Christ's own testimony of himself attested and interpreted by his living witnesses and enemies  the Jews  on  the evidence of his trial and crucifix∣ion  and on  the most explicit declarations of the A∣postles after the Resurrection of Christ  What ap∣peared to him to be a substantial and unanswerable ar∣gument he has in this little exercise on the subject en∣deavoured to render an easy and popular proof of our Saviour's divinity It was printed separately for the use of the unlearned part of his parishioners and is subjoin∣ed to this treatise for the convenience of other unlearned readers and such as may not have much considered the subject  DURHAM  Nov

 June    DEAR SIR  WHEN I look upon the date of your last oblig∣ing letter I am much ashamed that I have so long neglected to acknowledge the receipt of it The truth is I began a letter a few days afterwards but recol∣lecting that I had written on the same subject viz the use of the Greek article  and copulative  to a very learned friend at a great distance in the coun∣try I was willing to wait for his answer lest it should oblige me to make any alterations in my rules and so indeed it  proved for he objected to my first rule as it was then stated and has cited several ex∣ceptions to it which  thought sufficient to set it entirely aside but this I am convinced is going too far and would be  injury to truth The use there∣fore  which I have made of my friend's objections has been to correct my rule and add to it such li∣mitations as might include the several exceptions cited by my learned friend as well as others that are similar to them  The waiting for my friend's answer and the neces∣sary corrections in consequence of it together with a variety of other engagements has prevented me from complying with your request so soon as I could have wished but I shall now submit to your consi∣deration and candour the rules in question and beg that you will be pleased to favour me with whatever examples may occur in the course of your reading either as exceptions to invalidate the  first rule  or as proofs to establish and confirm it The reasons of my recommending the first rule more particularly to your attention is because it is of much more con∣sequence than any of the rest as it will enable us if the truth of it be admitted to correct the translation of several important texts in the present English ver∣sion of the New Testament in favour of a fundamen∣tal article of our church which has of late been much opposed and traduced I mean the belief that our Lord Jesus Christ is truly God  RULE I  When the copulative  connects two nouns of the same case viz nouns either substantive or adjective  or participles of personal description respecting office dignity affinity or connection and attributes properties or qualities good or ill if the article  or any of it's cases preceeds the first of the said nouns or participles and is not repeated before the second noun or participle the latter always relates to the same person that is ex∣pressed or described by the first noun or participle  i e it denotes a further description of the first named person as  Matt xii And again  Cor i This last sentence contains two examples of the first rule See also in Cor xi  c Also in Eph vi  Also in Heb iii  c See also in Pet ii  c And again in Pet iii  And again in Pet iii  Also in Philippians iv  c In Rev xvi  c And in Col ii    The distinction of persons mentioned in this sentence is pra∣served by the insertion of the article  before  which had been omitted before      c And in Thef iii  This solemn ejaculation for the divine direc∣tion is addressed jointly to the God and Father and to our Lord Jesus  This text is clearly a supplication to Christ for providential assistance and being addressed to him  jointly  with God the Father most certainly amounts to  supreme worship  because the direction of Providence belongs to God alone so that a prayer for it addressed to Christ were he merely a minister or dispenser of God's provi∣dence and not also truly God would be utterly unlawful and more especially so if such an inferior dispenser of providence one that was not truly God was to be addressed jointly with the heavenly Father for that would be blasphemous  so that here is good authority for offering up prayers to Christ which some have lately opposed and the distinction of the persons is preserved as in the last example by again inserting the article  before  which had been omitted before  The apostle James also used the same mode of expression  c James i And there are at least a do∣zen other places viz Rom xv Cor xv Gal i Ephes v Col i and  Some copies have not the words  in this twelfth verse but only  in which last case this verse affords an example only of the second rule  and iii Thes i Thes iii Thes ii James iii Rev i wherein  "the God and Father"  is mentioned exactly according to this rule and there is no exception or instance of the like mode of expression that I know of which necessarily  requires a construction different from what is here laid down EXCEPT the nouns be  proper names  or  in the plural number  in which cases there are many exceptions though there are not wanting exam∣ples even of plural nouns which are expressed ex∣actly agreeable to this rule  As the examples which I have annexed to my first rule consist of texts wherein the sense is so plain that there can be no controversy concerning the par∣ticular persons to whom the several nouns are ap∣plicable it will be thought I hope that I have al∣ready cited a sufficient number of them to authen∣ticate and justify the rule There are several other texts wherein the mode of expression is exactly simi∣lar and which therefore do necessarily require a construction agreeable to the same rule though the present English verson has unhappily rendered them in a different sense and has thereby concealed from the mere  English  reader many striking proofs  con∣cerning the Godhead    Col ii of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ The rules which follow are intended only to illustrate the  particula∣rity  of the several sentences which fall under  the first rule  by shewing in  other  sentences the different senses that are occasioned by adding omiting or repeating the article as well  with  the copulative as  without it  RULE II  A repetition of the article before the second noun if the copulative be omitted will have the same effect and  power  for it also denotes a further description of the same person property or thing that is expressed by the first noun as in the following examples    Luke i  c Luke ii  John i  John iv  John v  John vi This verse contains three examples  c John xx  The apostle in this text expressly calls our Lord Jesus Christ "  the  Great SHEPHARD OF THE SHEEP"  and the apostle Peter entitles him "THE CHIEF SHEP∣HERD"    Pet v which compare with Psaim xxiii "JEHOVAH  is my  SHEPHERD" and with Isaiah xl  "O Zion that bringeth good tidings"  c  say unto the cities of Judah Behold  YOUR GOD  Behold the Lord  JEHOVAH  will come in mighty power and  HIS  arm shall rule for him behold  HIS  re∣ward is with him and  HIS  work before him  HE  i e the Lord JEHOVAH "  shall feed  HIS  flock like a  SHEPHERD  he shall gather the lambs with his arm  " c c To explain this still further the pro∣phet Ezekiel foretold that "  all  shall have  one Shepherd  " Ezekiel xxxvii And Christ himself expressly acknowledged that  emi∣nent pastoral  character saying  I am the good Shepherd'    and I know  MY sheep  and am known of  MINE'  John x And a little further v our Lord mentions the  true mark  by which  his  flocks are known viz that of  Hearing his voice  compare with  th  psalm  My sheep  said our Lord  hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life  c which power of  giving eternal life  cannot be an attribute of any per∣son that is not truly God and one with Jehovah or the heavenly Father as in the th verse he is expressly declared to be  "I and my Father are one"    we are one  in which brief expression both the plurality and the unity of the two persons are unquestion∣ably asserted  c Heb xiii This sentence also contains three examples  GENERAL EXCEPTION  Except when genitive cases depend on one another in succession as  Cor iv And again  c Colos ii  RULE III  And the omission of the copulative between two or more nouns of the same case of personal description or appli∣cation even without the article before the second noun will have the same effect  viz will denote a further description of the same person property or thing that is expressed by the first noun as in the follow∣ing examples  Rom ii    In the modern printed editions the reading is  but in the Complutensian and several of the oldest edi∣tions it is  as also in the Alexandrian and other old MSS as well as the ancient versions and the citations of the Fa∣thers for which see Wetstein's Testimony Now compare this expression  with Pet ii  and also with Kings xvii and  ye shall not fear  rendered by the seventy    other gods but  JEHOVAH  who brought you up out of the land of Egypt c him shall ye fear  Ephes v  c Tit i    Here the  command  of  Christ  is mentioned jointly with the com∣mand of  God  himself which is a mode of expression never used concerning any other man but the  Man Christ Jesus  our Lord "  by whom are all things  Cor viii Hebrews i John i Col i and  "by whom all things consist"  Col i  Tim i  RULE IV  Yet it is otherwise when the nouns are not of person∣al description or application for then they denote di∣stinct things or qualities as    Tim i Tim i Titus i  In all these three texts and in John there is a mannifest supplication made to  Christ jointly with God the Father  for  grace mercy  and  peace  all divine gifts the supplications therefore must necessarily be considered as acts of  supreme worship to both  See also John    RULE V  And also when there is no article before the first noun the insertion of the copulative  before the next noun or name of the same case denotes a different person or thing from the first  as in the following examples  c James i  Ephes iv This last sentence contains four examples of the fifth rule  Cor i Ephes i Gal i Philem  Ephes vi  The supplications for  grace  and  peace  jointly from God the Fa∣ther and from the Lord Jesus Christ in all these five texts last cited are so many unquestionable instances of  prayer  and  supreme worship to  CHRIST as being a free disposer of those divine gifts  jointly  with his Almighty Father agreeable to what I have already remarked above on Thess iii and Titus i  EXCEPT the numerical adjective  precedes the first noun in which case the copulative  will have the same effect that it has between two nouns where only the first is preceded by the article agreeable to the first rule as  Ephes iv  RULE VI  And as the insertion of the copulative  between nouns of the same case  without articles  according to the fifth rule denotes that the second noun expresses a  different person thing or quality from the preced∣ing noun  so likewise  the same effect  attends the copu∣lative when each of the nouns are preceded by articles  as in the following examples  John i  John ii  John xi  Col ii  Tim i  Pet iv  EXCEPT distinct and different actions are intended to be attributed to  one and the same person  in which case if the sentence is not expressed agreeable to the three first rules but appears as an exception to this sixth rule or even to the fifth for this  exception  re∣lates to both rules the context must explain or point out plainly the person to whom the two nouns relate as in Thess iii  c And also in John xx  If the two nouns viz  and  were the leading nominative substantives of a sentence they would express the descriptive qualities or dignities of  two distinct persons  according to the sixth rule but in this last text two distinct divine characters are applied to  one per∣son  only for the context clearly expresses  to whom the words were addressed by Thomas  which perspicu∣ity  in the address  clearly proves likewise the futility of that gloss for which the Arians and Socinians contend viz that Thomas could not mean that  Christ was his God  but only uttered in his surprize a solemn exclamation or ejaculation to God The text however expressly relates that our Lord first addressed himself to Thomas  that is without doubt to JESUS  So that both these  distinct  titles for they are plainly mentioned as  distinct  were manifestly ad∣dressed  to that  one person Jesus  to whom  Thomas  replied  as the text expressly informs us The lan∣guage is so plain when the whole context is consi∣dered that the Socinian perversion of it is notori∣ous See also Cor i    Example of the exception to the fifth rule  and Acts ii There are also other exam∣Ples of this exception which equally prove that  Christ  is  God  as    Example of the exception to the sixth rule    Example of the exception to the sixth rule  Rev i  These are the words of him whom John saw  with a two edged sword proceeding out of his mouth which was undoubtedly a representa∣tion of the  or word of God as this declara∣tion alludes plainly to his death and resurrection  And again in the second chapter ver  Example of the exception to the sixth rule  and the same infallible mark of distinction is ad∣ded to prove which of the divine persons is here to be understood  Now though the explanation which Grotius has given us of these titles  is certainly true when ap∣plied to Christ yet it does not appear to be the  whole truth  or the full meaning that ought to be attribu∣ted to these titles either in the Revelation or else where for they have a manifest reference to the supreme titles of  the Almighty  in the first chapter th verse which also contains examples of this excep∣tion  And in the d chapter th verse where these titles  are manifestly by the context to be under∣stood as the titles of Christ we find them explained by these other titles  to which Grotius has attributed a much inferior and less com∣prehensive meaning  And as I have shewn in my Tract on  the Law  of Nature c p and that these titles "  the first  and  the last  " are ancient titles of  Jehovah  in the Old Testament to declare his  eternal existence  there can be no just reason for giving them an inferior sense when they are appli∣ed to Christ who was truly  Jehovah  as a variety of texts do demonstrate  Law of Nature  p to  Another example of the exception to the fifth rule occurs in the Rev xx  These are two different names or appellatives attributed by the explanatory words  to the same Old Serpent  THE END OF THE RULES  The various uses of the article and copulative expressed in the five last rules and their exceptions must amply illustrate to every attentive reader the difference and particularity of those sentences which fall under the first and principal rule and therefore I may now proceed with more confidence to point out several important corrections that ought to be  made in our common translation of the New Testa∣ment if the several sentences which fall under the  first rule  be duly weighed and consideredcorrec∣tions which may be fairly defended I apprehend by the authority of the several examples from which these rules were formed  EXAMPLES  Of sentences which fall under the FIRST RULE and are improperly rendered in the English version  Example I Pet i  As the Article  is not repeated before the next descriptive noun  it is manifest that both the nouns are to be referred to one and the same person and therefore in order to turn it into an intelligible English phrase the  proper name  to which the  two descriptive nouns  re∣fer ought to be placed first as  By the righteous∣ness of Jesus Christ OUR GOD and our SAVIOUR  Among the various readings collected by Curcel∣laeus it appears that in some copies the word  was not repeated after  and I have by me twen∣ty different editions including those of Erasmus Stephens Dr Mill Bengelius c which follow that reading viz  in which case a literal rendering into English will sufficiently express the sense of the Greek without transposing the  proper name  viz  Through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ  The sense and purport however  is exactly the same in both the readings and in the old English editions has generally been expressed in the terms required by my first rule viz  In the righteousness that cometh of oure God and Saviour Je∣su Christ  fol edit  Through the righ∣teousnesse of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ  mo edit  By the righteousnesse of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ  to edit  The righteousness of Jesus Christ our God and Sa∣viour  margin of the folio edit And even in the margin of our present version the pro∣per reading is inserted  of our God and Saviour  manifestly referring both titles to one person The learned Beza also remarks on the words of this text  Ista necesse est conjunctim legamus quia unicus est ar∣ticulus ut copiosius diximus  Tit ii  Itaque conti∣net etiam hic locus manifestum divinitatis Christi testi∣monium  The two nouns are referred to Christ also in the Syriac version There seems therefore to be ample authority for my first rule  Exam II Titus ii  In some few copies a comma is inserted between  and  but with∣out authority The abovementioned note of Beza upon this text is too long to be inserted here at  ength and therefore I must refer you to the author himself He insists however that these two titles do not refer to two distinct persons because the article  omitted before the second In the present Eng∣lish  version it is rendered  the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ  but so great is the difference between the idiom of the Greek tongue and that of the English that a  literal translation  will not always express the same sense without some little transposition in the order of the words and therefore though the pronoun  is placed after the two descriptive nouns that are ap∣plicable only to  one  person as they are expressed in  the Greek  yet the rendering of the said pronoun  in English  ought to be PREFIXED to the said descriptive nouns in order to express the  same sense  in a proper English phrase as  the glorious appearing of  OUR  great God and Saviour Jesus Christ  This is the rendering of the learned Hugh Broughton accor∣ding to a printed English bible corrected  with a pen  in my collection It might indeed be  literally  ren∣dered without transposition of the pronoun viz  the great God and Saviour  OF US  instead of  OUR  great God and Saviour  but the latter is more agreeable to the general mode of expressing that pronoun in English Thus Christ is not only enti∣tled  God  but even the  "great God"  according to the plainest grammatical construction of the text and indeed if we duly weigh the evidence of his being really  Jehovah  and  one with the Father    the plural verb    "we are"  marking the plurality or distinction of more person than one as much as the noun  marks the  unity  of  their existence he must necessarily be esteemed  the great God  As we believe that three persons exist in one and the same God we cannot believe any one of them to be less than God without denying the unity of the Godhead And as each person is God it follows that each must be the great God Theophylact bears an explicit testimony to this conclusion in his commentary on St Paul's epistle to Titus ii  says the learned and venerable commentator exultingly on the authority of this passage    Now what be∣comes of their objections who degrade the dignity of the Son not allowing him even the name of God Let them learn from this passage that he is not only God but the great God He is called great not relatively by com∣parison with another inferior God but absolutely from his own native and essential greatness  Whitby in his note on the same passage of Titus has given some very solid reasons for applying the terms  to our Saviour His words are  Here it deserveth to be noted that it is highly probable that Jesus Christ is here styled  the great God  first because in the original the article is prefixed only before the  great God  and therefore seems to re∣quire this construction "the appearance of Jesus Christ the great God and our Saviour" Secondly because as God the Fa∣ther is not said properly to  appear  so the word  never occurs in the New Testament but when it is applied to Jesus Christ and some coming of his the places in which it is to be found being only these Thess ii Tim vi Tim i and iv Thirdly because Christ is emphatically styled  our hope the hope of  our glory Col i Tim i And lastly because not only all the ancient commentators on the place do so interpret this text but the AnteNicene fathers al∣so Hippolytus Antichrist sect speaking of "the ap∣pearance of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ and Clemens of Alexandria ad Gent p proving Christ to be both God and Man our Creator and the author of all our good things from these very words of St Paul  Vid tract de vera Christi deitate  p  Hammond also in his literal marginal ver∣sion translates  thus "the appearance of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ EDITOR  The remainder of this letter is lost The author had not Ieisure to copy the original letter before he sent it to the gentleman to whom it was addres∣sed and therefore he requested him to return it as soon as he had perused and considered it but the gentleman neglected this request and the au∣thor after several years solicitation obtained only a part of the letter as far as is here copied and the remainder which was written on a separate half sheet he has never yet been able to recover He had however a short memorandum of  the several texts  which were explained in the latter part of the letter and having since had favourable opportunities of examining the said texts and of copying them very accurately from the ancient Alexandrian manuscript in the British Museum he has been ena∣bled to make some short remarks on the versions of all the said texts which may serve as a sufficient Supplement to this imperfect letter Some notes have been added to this printed copy which were not in the original let∣ter  G S  because there is but ONE GOD  G S  EXAMPLES TO THE GRAMMATICAL RULES OF CONSTRUCTION c  EXAMPLE I ACTS XX    The warning of the apostle Paul to the presby∣ters of the church of Ephesus which is thus ren∣dered in the common english version  Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the  holy Ghost  hath made you over∣seers to feed the church of  God  which he hath purchased with his own blood  In the Alexandrian MS and a few other MSS instead of  which is the most general reading the word  is substituted but many old MSS have both words  whereby the text is brought within the construction of the st rule  and should be rendered"To feed the church of the  Lord even of God  which he hath purchased with  his own blood  "  Though there is no word in the Greek to cor∣respond with this word  "even"  so as that it might be deemed a  literal rendering  yet this english word is frequently used by our translators to ex∣press the  identity of person  when a copulative in the greek text joins a second substantive i e of  personal  description without an article to the former substantive preceded by an article agree∣able to the first rule as in Romans xv  and I Cor xv  both of which are rendered  "God even the father"  in∣stead of the literal rendering  the God and father  that the  identity of person  may be the more obvious See also II Cor i  This sentence contains two succes∣sive examples of the first rule and is rendered  Bles∣sed be God  even  the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort  See also James iii  I Thess iii  II Thess ii  Besides these six examples where∣in the word  even  in the english version expresses the the copulative there are also  viz Cor xi Gal i Ephes i and and Philip iv Col i and and I Thess i and James i Peter i  other examples of  the first rule  in the New Testament i e altoge∣ther examples respecting our  heavenly father  alone and therefore the examples of the same mode of expression produced in this and the fol∣lowing pages respecting the  son and holy spirit  ought certainly to be rendered in a  sense  suitable to the same uniform rule of construction to ex∣press  the identity of persons  because the same mode of grammatical expression is used in them all  EXAMPLE No II EPHESIANS v    In the common english version the sentence is rendered  "no whoremonger c" hath any inheri∣tance in the kingdom of Christ and of God  As if two persons had been mentioned in the original text but as the part of the sentence above cited is the generally approved reading of the printed  greek copies  and as this reading is confirmed by the Alexandrian MS and by all other greek MSS of known authority it affords an unquestionable proof against  the apostacy of the Socinians  in their  denial of divine honour to our Lord the Christ or Messiah  who according to the idiom of the greek Tongue is in this text expressly entitled  "GOD" though the proof does not appear in the english version Let it be remarked that the two substan∣tives  of personal description  and  are joined by the copulative  and that the article  pre∣ceeds the first and that there is no article before the word  whereby according to  the first rule  both titles are  necessarily  to be applied to  one  and the same person and if literally rendered in eng∣lish should be"hath not inheritance in the king∣of  the Christ and God  " But this  literal  rendering does not sufficiently express the necessary doctrine of the greek that the  Christ  is  also God  and there∣fore to help the english idiom and to accommodate the rendering more strictly to the true meaning of the greek the name of  Jesu  which is necessary to be  understood  might very fairly be inserted in  italies  or between hooks to supply the necessary sense of the greekas "in the kingdom of Jesus the Christ and God" or else to be rendered  "in the kingdom of Christ even of God"  as recommended in the first example  EXAMPLE III PHILIPIANS iii    This is rendered in our common version  For we are the circumcision which worship  God  IN the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh  In the London Polyglott and many other valu∣able  editions the reading is  but in the Alexandrian MS it is  which seems to be the true reading because the other is so unusual an expression that the generality of translators have forced a construction which the context itself cannot fairly bear even if the da∣tive case  was admitted to be the true reading unless another word the preposition  be also added to it before  as in John iv and Rom viii where the sense which they have ap∣plied to this text was really intended but without this addition as we may fairly judge by those ex∣amples the literal rendering ought to be  We are the circumcision  who worship the spirit God  Whereas they have commonly rendered it as if the preposition  was really inserted in this text before the dative  as in the two examples before cited viz  "Qui spiritu servimus dec"  or  Qui spi∣ritu colimus Deum  or as in the Syriac version  "Qui deo servimus in spiritu"  fyr or as in the common english version  Which worship God in the spirit  But there is no such preposition in the greek The difficulty therefore of rendering the common reading  without supposing this addition of EN to be understood before  proves that the reading of the Alexandrian MS in this text is really to be prefered  Many other ancient and valuable greek MSS as Dr Mill has restified have this reading  but Augustine testified that in his time  all  or  almost all greek copies  and many latin had the reading "SPIRITUI DEI"  Plures enim Codices etiam Latini sic habent qui  SPIRITUI DEI  servimus  GRAECT  autem  OMNES AUTPENE OMNES  In nonnullis autem exemplaribus  LATINIS  invenimus  non SPIRITUI DEI SERVIMUS  sed  SPIRITUI DEO SERVIMUS  Sed qui in hoc erravit et authoritati graviori cedere detrectavit c  In Wetstein's edition the word  is subjoined with this mark  to denote the  preferable reading  "who worship the spirit of God"  whereby the apostle and Timothy as an example to the church at Philippi assert their profession that they pay  divine honour to the spirit of God  and  that they glory in Christ  EXAMPLE IV THESS i    This in the common english version is render∣ed very erroneously as if two distinct persons were mentioned viz  "according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ"  But if two distinct persons had really been intended to be expressed as by innumerable examples of the grammatical construction of sentences for the accurate distinc∣tion of persons peculiar to the greek tongue used in the greek testament from which the preceeding rules were formed may be demonstrated the arti∣cle would have been repeated according to the sixth rule after the copulative and before the se∣cond substantive  For it is manifest that the  insertion of the comma in some greek copies after  is a modern interpolation because the expe∣dient of breaking sentences into small divisions or particles by commas to preserve the necessary dis∣tinctions was not anciently used nor likely to have been used by the ancient writers of the greek tongue who were accustomed to much more accurate distinctions in their various pecu∣liar modes of grammatical expression specified in the six preceding rules  Whole sentences are indeed distinguished in the oldest greek MSS by a single point placed at their end sometimes towards the top of the line sometimes in the middle and sometimes towards the bottom but apparently no distinction of  time  has been intended by any of these three different modes of placing the point for they are all placed indiscriminately to the most obvious and full ter∣mination of sentences and therefore we may be assured that in all these three different modes of placing them they were originally intended only as  periods  to conclude the sentences so that when we find them in the place of commas to distinguish merely the parts or particles of a sentence there is great reason to suspect that they have been the ad∣ditions of later times  In the Alexandrian MS the text before us is awkwardly divided by one of these points placed after the word  which point for the reason  before given must necessarily be deemed a  period  and which did not exist in the original text of the sacred penman  The intention of the transcriber or interpolator by adding this point to the text for it cannot justly be attributed to the original writer has been probably to make a distinction of persons as if  two  persons had been named in the text instead of  one  in like manner as the comma is added after the word God in the english version  without any authority  But the necessary grammatical construction of the whole sentence taken together detects the in∣terpolator and demonstrates the absurdity of sup∣posing that any such point ever existed in the ori∣ginal text because the words which are severed by the supposititious period cannot form a grammati∣cal sentence according to the ordinary modes of expression used in the greek tongue by themselves alone so that the obvious sense of the context demonstrates their necessary connection with the preceding words  in one entire sentence  and de∣monstrates also at the same time the ignorance and fallacy of the interpolator who attempted to make two sentences of it by inserting a full period  If literally rendered it ought to be  according to the grace of the God and Lord of us Jesus Christ  but more in the idiom of our own language it might be justly rendered  according to the grace of  Jesus Christ our God and Lord  In either way the necessary doctrine of  our Lord's divine nature  manifestly intended to be expressed in the original is duly retained in the proposed version  EXAMPLE V TIM V  c  This in the common english version is rendered  I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things c  The word  is omitted in the Alexandrian MS which however agrees in every other parti∣cular for no  points  whatever are inserted between the substantives so that we have the testimony even of this MS for a clear declaration that  Jesus  is  God  as well as  Lord  and after the next copu∣lative which connects the mention of different Persons according to the sixth rule the adverb  before  though not expressly repeated is plainly to be understood as'I charge' thee 'before the God and Lord' "Jesus" or rather  'before Jesus the God and Lord and'  before  the elect angels that thou observe these things  Thus far the testimony of the Alexandrian MS But accord∣ing to the commonly received text of the greek it ought to be rendered in the english idiom  I  charge  thee  before Jesus Christ the GOD and LORD and  before  the elect angels c  EXAMPLE VI TIM iv  c  In the common english version this is rendered  I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead c  In the greek of this text as it is commonly printed the article  is repeated before  which so far affords an excuse for the present english version in placing the comma after the word God to denote  two  distinct persons according to the sixth rule but in the Alexandrian MS and several other old copies the article  is  not  repeated after the copulative before  so that the expression is exactly similar to the declaration of our Lord's  divine nature  by the same apostle in the preced∣ing example viz I Tim v In some printed editions the word  is also omitted but in the Geneva edition of with Scaliger's Notes the word  is inserted and the article  omitted whereby the title  God must necessarily be construed in such a manner that it may be clearly understood in all versions to be expressly applied  to Christ  as it really is in the original The tran∣scriber or interpolator of the Alexandrian MS however being aware of this doctrine has endea∣voured to pervert it by adding a full period after  the word  as  But this  period  is unquestionably supposititious because the words before and after the period are  not two distinct sentences  but obviously portions only of  one entire sentence  which must ne∣cessarily be construed together according to the ordinary rules of expression in the greek tongue as I have remarked on a preceding example whereby a second substantive of personal descrip∣tion  without an article before it  joined by a copu∣lative to a preceding substantive of the like na∣ture and in the same case  with an article before it  must necessarily denote a farther description of the same person expressed by the first substantive whenever there is an article before the first sub∣stantive and none before the second so that the insertion of the  period  in the Alexandrian MS af∣ter  is utterly vain because the  copulative  suffici∣ently proves the  connection  of the two substantives in one clear sentence and the omission of the article before the second substantive induces the necessity of applying the same grammatical construction whereby alone the due distinction of persons is so peculiarly maintained in the greek tongue and  not by points  The text should therefore be rendered  I charge thee therefore before the God and Lord Jesus Christ c  or rather to render the doctrine more obvious in the english idiom  I charge thee therefore before Jesus Christ the God and Lord who shall judge the quick and  the dead c  And thus the texts in the two last examples will perfectly accord as the uniform ex∣pressions of the same apostle asserting in both the  divinity of his Lord and Saviour  by whom he had been personally summoned to bear his testimony to the gentiles as being an eye and ear witness of his  glorious majesty  Our Socinian Sadducees who have impiously en∣tituled our Lord  "a mere man"  and  "nothing but a man"  and  simple human nature  will not be able to digest this necessary doctrine until they humble themselves to receive instructions from the holy scriptures  EXAMPLE VII TIT ii      The present version of these words in the eng∣lish testament is  Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ  This text though the next in order according to the usual mode of arranging the books of the new testament has al∣ready been produced as the second example in the preceding letter I have since however examined the Alexandrian MS and find that it agrees exactly with the above citation of this text except that a point has been added in the MS after the word  or  On which it is necessary to observe that the same remarks are obviously applicable to this super∣fluous and absurd addition of the point or  period  that I have made on the texts II Thess i and II Tim iv in the fourth and sixth examples of this tract For as the proper effect and purposes of  periods  is to separate words into  distinct sentences  it is obvious that the words which follow the suppo∣sititious period in this text are incapable of a gram∣matical construction without reference to the preceding words connected by the  copulative  and therefore the  note  of  separation  a period cannot possibly have been intended by the inspired writer This testimony therefore of the sacred text in fa∣vour of the necessary doctrine of our Lord's  divine nature  ought not to be withheld from the mere en∣glish reader  I am persuaded that our modern Socinians would not have made so much clamour about  the necessity of a new translation  had they been aware that a more close and literal rendering of the ori∣ginal text even in passages which had escaped their calumnious charges of  corruption  and their arrogant attempts at imaginary  correction  must necessarily cut up their favourite system by the roots  The text in question if the truth of the original be duly regarded must inevitably be rendered  Expecting the blessed hope and appearance of the  glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ  EXAMPLE VIII II PET i      Which in the common english version is thus imperfectly rendered  through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ  This text though  the eighth  in order according to the proper order of the books was  the first  ex∣ample cited in my letter and I have only to re∣mark farther that the Alexandrian MS perfectly agrees with the present common approved reading of the greek text In Dr Woide's printed copy of the said MS there is a point inserted after the word  which is not in the MS but that is manifestly a merely accidental typographical er∣ror  The Rev Mr Cruttwell has remarked in his useful edition of the english bible with Bishop Wilson's notes that the words rendered in our present version viz  of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ  were rendered  of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ  in the versions of Wiclif Cover∣dale Mathews Cranmer in the Bishops bible the Geneva the Rhemish bibles and by Dod∣dridge Westley Scattergood and Purver which is altogether a noble testimony of both ancient and modern times against the  Socinian impiety  The  eng∣lish  reader should undoubtedly be informed of the true meaning of these words in a proper  english  idiom as  Through the righteousness of Jesus Christ our God and Saviour  which is agreeable to a literal rendering into latin by the late learned Dr Thomas Mangey prebendary of Durham viz  "Jesu Christi Dei et servatoris nostri"  EXAMPLE IX JUDE iv      This in the common english version is imper∣fectly rendered  and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ  I made a transcript of this text several years ago from the Alexandrian MS which I copied or ra∣ther  drew  letter by letter in size and shape as exactly as the eye could discern In this transcript the word  is omitted as in the MS but I did not at that time perceive that there was any point or mark after the word  and I was there∣fore much surprized afterwards in comparing the said transcript with the elegant edition of my late very worthy and respectable friend the Rev Dr Woide who printed a copy of the new testa∣ment from the Alexandrian MS with new types in imitation of the letters of the MS to find that he had inserted a point in his new edition after the  word  I was very consident that I could not discern any such point when I examined the MS and yet as I entertained the highest respect and esteem for the veracity and accuracy of Dr Woide of which he was indeed truly worthy it was necessary to have this matter properly ex∣plained and I was rendered perfectly aware by Dr Velthusen's account of his examining an an∣cient MS that the feint lines and marks in the very old MSS are liable to bear different appear∣ances according to the different degrees of light in which they are seen  I therefore took the first opportunity afterwards of going once more to examine the MS and on a more close inspection I perceived indeed the  feint  mark which occasioned Dr Woide's insertion of the period in his edition but being afterwards assisted by the worthy librarian the Rev Mr Har∣per in a still more attentive and accurate exami∣nation of the mark with a magnifying glass I was satisfied that it had not been intended for a period but only for a short  line of connection  because it is nearly three times as long as it is broad  But if any person from the authority of Dr Woide's edition should be still inclined to suppose that it is really  a point  I must request them care∣fully to consider what I have before remarked on the fourth sixth and seventh examples in this tract respecting the addition of  points  in greek manu∣icripts  and also concerning the more accurate modes of Grammatical distinction in the greek tongue which rendered the smalier points or  par∣ticles of time  such as semicolons and commas abso∣lutely unnecessary in the  greek scripture  and in addition thereto let him observe particularly on the text before us that a point in that place after  in the middle of the sentence between the accusative noun and verb is utterly inconsutent with grammar and common sense and though the word  has been omitted in the Alexandrian MS perhaps for the same reason that some men would wish to prove the insertion of the point after  yet happily neither of these altera∣tions would at all affect or injure the manifest testimony of the apostle Jude  to Christ's almighty power and divinity  for  the only potentate and Lord of us Jesus Christ  is equivalent to a full declaration of  Christ's Divinity  as well as of his  almighty power  and with respect to the insertion of the  supposed point  they must perceive if they duly consider the text that the words  and  cannot consistently with the necessary gram∣matical sense of the greek and the usual modes of expression or idiom of that language be separated either by points or construction so as to be applied to two different persons because the article is  not  repeated after the copulative before  so that  Christ alone  was unquestionably that  "only poten∣tate"  or  sovereign Lord  who was denied by the  lascivious persons  against whom the apostle Jude bore testimony of their  reprobacy  and of their having  denied the Lord  who had  redeemed them  Dr Hammond's rendering of the text before us may therefore be conscientiously maintained viz  "and our only master God and Lord Jesus Christ"  making says he  "those three the several attri∣butes of Jesus Christ"  But as the doctor has been pleased to add that  This interpretation proceeds upon that way of punctuation which is ordinarily retained in our copies there being no comma after    I am obliged to protest against  that reason for the other reasons  already given and to insist that the grammatical construction of the greek text is of itself our sufficient and best warrant to justify that  literal rendering  But the applying to Christ this  supreme  title  "the only potentate God"  and also in a former text the  supreme  title of  "the great God"  may perhaps induce some persons to conceive that this grammatical system of construction if admitted as a rule for all texts in which the same mode of expression renders it applicable will sometimes prove rather too much and may be liable to fa∣vour a modern sect of  Unitarians  who have adopt∣ed the  Sabellian  notions of the late Baron Swe∣denborg and who assert that  Jesus Christ is the only God  that is they understand this in so  peculiar a sense that they do not seem properly to acknowledge the  personality  of  the holy spirit  any more than a very opposite sect of  Unitartans  do the modern Socinians who impiously assert in the opposite extreme to that the of  Swedenborgians  that  Jesus Christ was a mere man and nothing but a man  according to one of their teachers and  "simple human nature"  according to another and some of them have even presumed to charge the members of the church of England with ido∣latry  This unjust charge of  idolatry  against the unquestionable prin∣ciples of the  ancient catholic church  prosessed by the  church of Eng∣land  affords a notable skreen to the  Latin  church by indiscrimi∣nately confounding all the due distinctions whereby a charge of  idolatry  is applicable and this should teach us to be aware of what we should have to expect on the removal of all tests and restraints from such indiscriminate teachers and likewise from all other sec∣taries as much as from the  pontifical hierarchy  seated on the  throne of the dragon  who do  not  regulate their faith and practice by the plain doctrines of the holy scriptures For indeed no man is justly en∣titled to have a vote or share in the legislature of this or of any other  christian  nation unless he at least prosesses to regulate his  principles of action  by the  two first foundations of  ENGLISH LAW viz  natural  and  revealed religion  to which as being  two witnesses of God universal obedience  is due so that no statute of parliament can be  valid  nor any other law custom or practice  sufferable  if it be at all  inconsistent  with either of these  two indispensible foundations  For without these MEN retain indeed the form but not the  dignity of  MAN because they are subject to the impulse of  spirits  immi∣cal to the  nature of man  and are thereby liable to be rendered in disposition and practice the most noxious of  beasts  even  a generation of vipers  and therefore  the knowledge of our own  NA∣TURE  and of the principles of action in  MAN  what they are and what they ought to be  which by the scriptures alone is revealed to us is the first and most essential branch of  philosaphy  whatsoever our modern sceptical  philosophers  may think to the contrary for how should men be on their guard against  invisible enemies  of whose very existence they are ignorantBut by the holy scriptures we are informed that  the prince of the power of the air worketh in the children of disobedience  and certainly wherever this  satanical inspiration  manifestly takes place among  men  their  descriptive title  cannot be more accurately expressed than in the terms which our Lord himself as well as John the baptist before him applied to the haughty scepticks whom they opposed  a generation of vi∣pers  Matthew xii and  "serpents"  Matthew xxiii expressly alluding thereby to the  satanical inspiration  by which they became the  children  or  generation  of the  old serpent  as our Lord plainly warned them at another time  Ye are of  YOUR FA∣THER THE DEVIL    and the lusts of  YOUR FATHER  ye will do    he was a  MURDERER  from the beginning and abode not in the truth c Men  therefore who will not be limited by the  two first foundations of English law  are unworthy to b  admitted to an equal participation of  civil rights  in any free  christian  state whatever because  true liberty  cannot be maintained without that  perfection of law  which arises  only  from these  indispensible rules of action  They are  indispensible  because we can have no hope that our  constitutional  establishment of  natural  and  religious rights  to  the glory of God peace on earth  and  "good will towards men"  can possibly be maintained if such persons are admitted to a share of  legistative  authority who do not acknowledge the  only foundations  on which alone that happy  constitution  is built  because they pay  the divine honour that is  due  to their  Lord  and  Saviour  and to  the holy spirit  their  "other comforter"  So that both these sects of prosessed  Unitarians  as well as their  Unitarian  brethern the  Mahome∣tans    are by mistaken notions of the  divine unity  seduced from perceiving and acknowledging the declarations throughout the holy scriptures of the unquestionable existence of  three  divine persons in  one  only divine nature or  Godhead  The old Ari∣ans though their sect was probably represented by that  "fallen star"  which opened the  bottom∣ess lpit  for the emission of the  armed locusts  of the Arabian heresy  more strictly Unitarians  than themselves  Since I wrote the above remark respecting the  Mahometans  and  Arians  a more striking accomplishment of the prophecy re∣specting the  fallen star that opened the bottomless pit  has occurred to me in the character of  Nestorius  archbishop of Constantinople and metropolitan of the greek church whose doctrine was in effect still  "more Unitarian than"  that of  Arius  for the consequences of his denying the miraculous birth of our Lord and asserting that  "Christ born of the Virgin Mary was not the son of God"  must necessarily be that he was  "a mere man"  and  nothing but a man  according to the openly declared notions of our modern Socinians which in this point is strictly  Mahometan  With this false and  antichristian  doctrine  "the third part of the rivers and fountains of waters"  viz the sources of  the nations  and the  people  of the  Greek  Empire the  third  great monarchy was  embittered  and prepared for the  scorpion  like scourge of  mahometan  tyranny  On account of this blasphemous doctrine  Nestorius  was deposed by the judgement of a great counsel of his  peers  the  christian bishops  from his dignity as  archbishop  of the greatest city at that time in christendom and from being  metropolitan  as it were of the  Greek Empire  the  third  great monarchy and therefore he might truly be said to have  fallen  from the highest elevation of ecclesiastical dignity so that no prophetical type could more amply prefigure this rejection than  "the falling of a flar from heaven"  the hea∣ven or  firmament  of the then amply  established  episcopal authority throughout the Roman empire And the  Unitarian  doctrine of this  fallen star  I mean  Unitarian  in the  Mahometan  and  Socinian  sense of that term seems also to have been the  very "key"  whereby  "the bottomlels pit"  was opened to let out the noxious and diabolical vapour of  Mahometanism  for it is really  the leading  and first incul∣cated tenet in all the public professions of that baneful heresy And it is remarkable that a  Nestorian  monk  Sergius  professing the same blasphemous doctrine this  "key of the bottomless pit"  forged by  Nestorius  should actually have been an assistant to  Mahomet  in producing his pretended revelations and it is still more remarkable that all the  scorpionlike  scourges of the  Maho∣metan  conquest first LAWLESS TYRANNY and the suppression of all  popular rights  secondly ROBBERY and WAR notoriously sanc∣tioned or authorized by this pretended religion against  all  nations and people that do not receive their doctrine and thirdly the fatal  renewal  of the old  pagan  oppressions of  slaveholding  and  slavedeal∣ing  Such diabolical enormities may surely be compared to the dark exhalations of  "the bottomless pit"  and therefore our English promoters of  slaveholding  and  slavedealing  who have carried these  Mahometan  oppressions to a greater excess even than the  Mahometans  themselves have ample reason to dread the approaching time of  divine retribution  when God will  destroy the destroyers of the earth  and shall cause those that now  "lead into captivity"  and surely likewise all their abettors"to be  led into captivity  "  which had been happily extinguished by the general influence of  christian  benevolence should have compleatly pervaded all those eastern and southern regions of the  third  Empire wherever the doctrines of  Nestorius  had been previously adopted and had  embit∣tered  the  rivers  and  fountains  of the waters to prepare them for this signal  retribution  justly due to such antichristian apostates who deny the true  rock  on which the  catholic church  is built viz that  "Jesus is the Christ the Son of the living God"  or as St John has expressed the  peculiar sonship  or filiation of Christ viz "  the  ONLY BEGOT∣TEN SON  which is in the bosom of the father  " John i compare with ver and chap iii and  All the arguments produced by the learned  Vitringa  to prove that  Arius  was the  fallen star  are certainly much more applicable to  Nestorius  as being an  archbishop  and  metropolitan of the empire  and therefore more fitly prefigured by a  star  And that the smoke from  "the bottomless pit"  which was let out by this  fallen star  was really the mist or diabolical darkness of  Mahometanism  seems to have been very fairly proved by our learned countryman Joseph Mede  allowed indeed that  Christ was God  yet they supposed him to be so in  an inferior de∣gree  by which they unwarily acknowledged a  su∣perior God  and an  inferior God  i e  more Gods  than  one  contrary to the  true Unitarian doctrine  of  the primitive churches  which always held and asser∣ted  the unity of God  like the church of England to this day as much as they held it necessary to ac∣knowledge the  three divine persons  both of which doctrines are inevitable and indispensible while we profess to regulate our faith by the testimonies of the holy scriptures as handed down to us with∣out presuming to exercise the Socinian expedient of lopping off or altering as a supposed  corruption  or  interpolation  every text of scripture that opposes the system or set of notions that we happen to have adopted And therefore the  true Unitarian  christian who acknowledges but  one Godone Jehovahone divine nature    or  Godhead  and at the same time nevertheless is convinced that  three divine persons  are really revealed to us under the title of  Jehovah  I need not here recite the proofs of these assertions because I have already produced a great variety of examples collected from the old as well as the new testament in my tract on the  "Law of nature and principles of action in man"  from p to p  in the old testament and under the title of  or  God  in the new testament and that the  supreme attributes  of the DIVINE NATURE are ap∣plied to each in both testaments will of course be aware also that each of these divine persons must necessarily be  "the great God"  and  the only potentate  as there is but  "one God"    one only supreme power  or  Godhead  So that the effect of my grammatical rule when applied to the two particular texts before men∣tioned viz Tit ii and Jude iv will not in the opinion of such true christians seem to exceed the truth  Especially when compared with the concurrent reasons and testimonies quoted in the note p EDITOR  Though the apostle Paul asserted to the Colos∣sians ii concerning Christ that  in him dwel∣leth  ALL  the fulness of the Godhead      "bodily"    a term of indisputable  per∣sonality  yet surely this was without the least dis∣paragement to the supreme divinity of the  almighty father  and of the  holy spirit  because they are also necessarily included in the same  or  Godhead  as there is but  one God  and therefore as  it pleased all fuiness to dwell  in the person of our  Lord Jesus  Col i we may more easily compre∣hend why he required  "that all"  men  should honour the son  EVEN AS  they honour the father  that is undoubtedly  with supreme honour  EVEN AS or  according as    "they honour the father"  And our Lord said expressly  He that honoureth not the son  that is according to the measure before declared"EVEN AS  they honour" or ought to ho∣nour the father    honoureth not the father which hath sent him  John v and he also claimed expressly  to be glorified with the father himself    "And now O father"  said he  GLORIFY THOU ME WITH THINE OWNGELF  with the glory which I had with thee before the world was  John xvii thereby asserting both his  preexistence  and  su∣preme dignity  Christians therefore who humbly receive these and the many other revelations of  Christ's divinity  have the less difficulty in acknow∣ledging the  doctrines of the ancient catholic churches  and the declarations of our  creeds  But let all other men likewise who profess to believe in the  name of Christ  earnestly enquire in the  first  place as the  first  means of progress to the true faith whe∣ther they are really  "willing"  for this is given is the true proof of  faith    to conform themselves to the  will  of  God  as revealed in all the most obvious declarations and injunctions of holy scripture and more particularly to the purity  which is expressly called  "the will of God"  viz the  sanctification of their bodies  For this is the  will of God  even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in  sanctification  and  honour  noth the lust of concupiscence even as the Gentiles which known  God that no one should go beyond or defraud his brother c  I Thess iv  which cannot other∣wise be capable of becoming  Temples  of  the holy Ghost  an indispensible state both of  body  and  mind  for all christians to maintain for in that case they may assuredly rely on God's absolute promise through Christ that  if any one shall be  WILLING  to do  HIS WILL  he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak  said our Lord  "from myself"  John vii  DEO SOLI GLORIA  A PLAIN MATTEROFFACT ARGUMENT FOR THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST  QUESTION  FOR what END did Christ COME INTO THE WORLD  A Christ was "manifested in the flesh that is was made manTO DIE FOR THE SINS OF MAN∣KINDto destroy the works of the devilto re∣deem us from all iniquity and to purity unto him∣self a peculiar people zealous of good works" Cor xv John iii Tit ii  Q Where was Christ before he came into this world and was manifested in the flesh  A He was in Heaven "He came down from Heaven He was with God his Father before the world was before the foundation of the world he was in the bosom of his Father and in his Father's Glory" John iii vi i xvii  Q How was his manifestation in the flesh made known to the world  A By the message of an angel to Mary his mo∣ther to Joseph and to certain shepherds  Q Under what name was be made known  A He was called JESUS a Saviour the Son of God the Son of the Highest  Q Who was the mother of Jesus  A The Virgin Mary  Q Was any prophesy fulfilled by the birth of Jesus Christ  A Yes "all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son and they shall call his name EMMANUEL which being interpre∣ted is GOD WITH US" Matt i Isaiah vii  Q What was Christ put to death for  A For blasphemy as the Jews thought it in calling himself the Son of God  Q In what did the Jews say the blasphemy con∣sisted  A In this that he being as they supposed a mere man called God his own Father thereby declaring himself to be equal with God and to be God John v x  Q What did Christ ever say of himself which im∣plied that he was God  A He said that he was one with God and par∣took of the glory of God before the world was that is from all eternity  Catechist Repeat the passage in which this is said  A "And now O Father glorify thou me with thine ownself with the glory which I had with thee before the world was" John xvii  Q What did Christ ever say of himself which im∣plied that he was equal with God  A He said that "he and his Father are one" that "the Father hath given all things into his power" that "what things soever the Father doeth these also doeth the Son likewise" that "the Father hath committed all judgment to the Son that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father" John x iii v v  Q Who were the first witnesses in Christ's time in proof of Christ's divinity  A His enemies the unbelieving Jews both the people and their rulers  Q Do you call the unbelieving Jews prior witnes∣ses to the Apostles  A Yes because this great truth THE DIVINTY OF CHRIST was hid from the Apostles as well as the rest of their countrymen till after Christ's RE∣SURRECTION FROM THE DEAD Christ first asserted himself to be God by calling God his Father and himself the Son of God in a sense which implied  that he was equal with God and was God for so even his unbelieving hearers understood itthe Jews condemned him to death for itthe Apos∣tles preached it  Q As Christ knew that this was the sense in which the Jews understood his testimony of himself when they first charged him with blasphemy for it did he at his trial attempt to deny the charge  A No he admitted the charge and confirmed it and died for it and appealed to the day of judgment as their future proof of it  Catechist Repeat the passage  A When "the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the Christ the Son of the Bles∣sed Jesus said I am and  as a proof of it  YE shall  at the last day  see  me  the Son of man fit∣ting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of Heaven" Mark xiv  Q If Christ had not been the Messiah the Son of God in the sense in which they understood him would he not have undeceived them  A If Jesus Christ had not been the Messiah the Son of God in the sense in which the Jews un∣derstood him he would have undeceived them to save his own life and to free them from a very great delusion  Q But Jesus Christ was put to death for calling himself the Son of God what then do you conclude  A I conclude that Jesus Christ really was what  they charged him with calling himself THE SON OF GOD and in the sense in which they understood him that is that he was EQUAL WITH GOD and was God  Q You say that in the lifetime of Christ the Apos∣tles appeared not to know that Christ was God what was their opinion after he rose from the dead  A Convinced by his resurrection from the dead according to his promise that he would  raise himself  from the dead they believed him to be "their Lord and ther God""the word made flesh" "God manifested in the flesh" in whom  dwelt ALL the fulness of the Godhead bodily  Em∣manuel" or "God with us""the creator and upholder of all things" who "in the beginning" of all things "was with God and was God" "the true God and eternal life" and "over all God blessed for ever" John xx John i Tim iii Coi ii Matt i John i Heb i John i John v Rom ix  Whatever difficulty may be found in the various readings of any of these passages it must vanish like a mist in the full light of their united evidence To them we may confidently add the very important testimonies which in the preceding remarks and examples Mr Sharp has most happily recovered from the erroneous constructions of the common version    Q Now tell me in few words what you collect from Christ's testimony of himself as attested by the Jews of  his own time condemned by the rulers but universally propagated by the Apostles  A The conclusion to be drawn from it is that Christ the Son of God is one with God and equal with God and is God Christ asserted it the Jews condemned him to die for it he sealed his testimony with his blood The Apostles convin∣ced by his resurrection from the dead believed it and preached it and died for it  Catechist The Jews then put Christ to death as an impostor and blasphemer and yet Christians have believed in him and worshipped him as the Son of God for almost eighteen hundred years How do you ac∣count for this  A It was in the decrees of God that Christ should die for the sins of mankind If the Jews had believed him to be the Son of God they would not have put him to deathif he had not been put to death as he was he would not have "borne our sins in his own body on the cross" that is he would not have died for our sins THE END for which he CAME INTO THE WORLDhe would not have given that great and inestimable proof of the truth of Scripture and of his own promises which HE did by rising from the dead and the Apostles would not have given that sure evidence of their own belief in Christ the ground and confirmation of OURS which THEY did by dy∣ing for their crucified Lord and Master  FINIS
