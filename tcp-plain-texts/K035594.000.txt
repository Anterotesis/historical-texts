ADVERTISEMENT  IN the very moment when I was concluding the Notes to this Elegy I received an Elegiac Poem on the same subject by a Gentleman whose extensive knowledge of Indian Literature and whose acquaintance with its lamented Patron induced me to peruse his Publication with peculiar eagerness There is so much poetical merit in the animated and graceful tribute which Mr MAURICE has paid to the memory of Sir WILLIAM JONES that had I seen it before the completion of these Stanzas it might have induced me to relinquish a subject preengaged by a Writer so peculiarly qualified to treat it with success Yet the literary excellence of Sir WILLIAM JONES appears to require some kind of homage from every man of letters and by the spirit of Mr MAURICE'S performance I am persuaded that our common regard for the Character we commemorate is so sincere and ingenuous that we must rejoice in a multiplicity of offerings to a name so entitled to univer+sal praise  ELEGY c  I  SCIENCE of late with quick maternal eye  Pensive and kind with Glory by her side  Watch'd every sail from INDIA to descry  That Son's return whose talents are her pride  II  Sudden across the tutelary Queen  Death's Angel pass'd and shook his potent dart  Then in stern triumph said Behold a scene  At once to wound and to console thy heart  III  Far off she finds her darling JONES inurn'd  INDIA'S mild sages dropping many a tear  With admiration into anguish turn'd  Mourn that enlighten'd Judge they joy'd to hear  IV  The Fane he rear'd to ASIATIC lore  On which his mind immortal lustre shed  Echoing the liberal voice of friendly SHORE  Sounds the sweet praises of the hero dead  V  The Hero who in fields of highest fame  Beyond his peers the dart of conquest hurl'd  Surpass'd ambitious AMMON'S weaker aim  And nobly grasp'd the intellectual world  VI  Thro' every province in that spacious sphere  His dauntless thoughts exulting Genius led  At whose bold march thro' deserts deep and drear  Darkness dispers'd and Difficulty fled  VII  O most accomplish'd of the favour'd few  Who to the heights of Learning's empire climb  Sharing with her in prospects ever new  A calm dominion over space and time  VIII  Early to thee obedient Language brought  Her keys commanding many a secret store  Youth of ingenuous and aspiring thought  'Tis thine she said these treasures to explore  IX  To thee reserved in ASIA'S richest spoil  Fancy and Wisdom will their wealth impart  Deck with their jewels won by letter'd toil  The throne of Virtue in thy steadfast heart  X  Glowing with youthful joy in Learning's seats  Thy mind embrac'd the glorious lot prescrib'd  And richly redolent of classic sweets  The mental persumes of the East imbib'd  XI  As spicy gales wak'd with delicious power  The pride of joy in GAMA'S gallant frame  When to his fervid hope in happy hour  They seem'd an earnest of eternal fame  XII  So and with stronger breathings of delight  The Muse of ASIA'S balmy flowers and fruit  Rais'd thy young spirit to pure Rapture's height  And promised Glory to thy keen pursuit  XIII  How patient Toil and eager Transport join'd  When Eastern bards awak'd thy kindred fire  And EUROPE saw thee with a skill refin'd  Adapt to ASIAN airs an ATTIC lyre  XIV  How ere thy mind could rest on Duty's rock  Thy early vigils patriot zeal evince  When thy free hand disdain'd not to unlock  A PERSIAN casket for a NORTHERN Prince  XV  But from thy spirit with just pride elate  What generous plaints of indignation burst  When Wisdom bade thee mark the scholar's fate  The child of Fancy by Delusion nurs'd  XVI  The quicksand covered by a tempting tide  Thy piercing eyes perceiv'd that latent snare  Where many a son of letter'd fame has died  Dupe of Delight and victim of Despair  XVII  Thou saw'st that often with insidious song  Sweet Learning to indulge a Syren's joy  Lures her fond slave from life's more active throng  Smiling to cheat and charming to destroy  XVIII  Thy genius soar'd the soft'ning spell above  With manly vigilance with noble spleen  And gave the Muse thy secondary love  Proclaiming Law thy life's acknowledg'd queen  XIX  Thou would'st be vassal only to the power  Who bears immutable Dominion's rod  Ruling the least and loftiest peace her dower  Her throne the bosom of her parent GOD  XX  She awful patroness with love sincere  Blest her young champion from sweet snares releas'd  And sent thee to ennoble and endear▪  Her ENGLISH empire in the radiant EAST  XXI  The sciences the arts and every power  That holds o'er earth beneficent controul  Hail'd thee so entering in their happiest hour  A scene adapted to thy fervid soul  XXII  With pensive zeal and exultation just  O'er that new scene thy active spirit ran  From Heav'n receiving as a glorious trust  The bright occasion of befriending man  XXIII  Thy country sent thee forth with joyous pride  Mix'd with maternal fears and fond concern  Of mental wealth Hope's sparkling eye descry'd  The richest freight in thy remote return  XXIV  Illusive vision He whose ample mind  Embrac'd the treasury of ASIAN thought  He to whom Science her rich depths consign'd  He dies untimely in the mine he wrought  XXV  No more can Fancy whom he us'd to chear  Take from his hand her scattered pearl new strung  Or Love or Friendship hope again to hear  Their songs of sweetness sweeter from his tongue  XXVI  Kind Heav'n yet bids them not too wildly grieve  Or deem too short the mortal path he trod  Did he not live to merit and receive  Praise from the world and recompence from God  XXVII  Let tender Truth to temper selfish Grief  Count the heap'd measure of his merits o'er  Nor blame the term of harvest as too brief  When Heav'n with plenitude has blest the store  XXVIII  Few were thy years to

trace  This course of transient being can display  And no appropriate charm has fail'd to grace  The morn or noon or ev'ning of thy day  XXX  Thy life a scene with pleasing wonder view'd  A perfect garden on a narrow plot  Whose bounds unseen the busy thought elude  While sweet Deception magnifies the spot  XXXI  What bright diversities that garden bore  Of all that Art can raise or Nature grant  There grew the palm that conscious virtue wore  There the Bard's laurel as an humbler plant  XXXII  Oh allaccomplished JONES how sweet how strong  Thy streams of music from the Muses' hill  Thine the loud torrent of her Epic song  And thine the murmur of her softest rill  XXXIII  Love's tender force and Fancy's sportive fire  Conspir'd to decorate the nuptial strain  When fondly reassum'd thy

Poet's genius and the Judge's heart  XXXV  For long ere THEMIS gave his glory birth  Or Eastern Muses idoliz'd his name  Thy welltrain'd youth attested all his worth  Thy friendship was the herald of his fame  XXXVI  Largely hast thou thy noble mansion grac'd  With volumes minist'ring to mental health  Thy treasury of books proclaims thy taste  Magnificent in literary wealth  XXXVII  And thou whose mental eye on Nature looks  Hast learn'd in busy life's contentious state  To read those rare illuminated books  The virtuous bosoms of the truly great  XXXVIII  But of the authors that adorn thy seat  And of the living hearts which thou hast read  In talents and in worth thou canst not meet  Superiors to thy friend so early dead  XXXIX  Wilt thou not SPENCER whose exalted mind  Delights to animate each graceful art  That triumphs over time by toil refin'd  Enshrining genius in Affection's heart  XL  Command chaste Sculpture with her marble scroll  Oblivion's torrent for that friend

humbler lot  Heav'n kindly cast on this fair ENGLISH ground  LXIX  In these dear native scenes to Pain a prey  Year after year he drew unvalue'd breath  And view'd the vital spark in dull decay  On a drear confine betwixt life and death  LXX  Weak in his frame as a dismantled tower  And his crush'd mind a partner in the fall  Robb'd of its little lustre use and power  A broken dial in a mould'ring

there's a virtuous pride  Tempering its anguish that would else destroy  The very pangs by which thy soul is tried  Thou would'st not change for apathy or joy  LXXVIII  Thou feel'st that Heav'n thy gratitude may claim  That thou hast liv'd a blameless happy wife  The cherish'd partner of as clear a name  As e'er won glory in the toil of life  LXXIX  For him if darkling mortals may presume  To judge the feelings of the blest above  E'en there he deems thy heart his richest tomb  His sweetest eulogy thy lasting love  LXXX  There Heav'n's tried servant and in service pure  His God he blesses for a kind decree  That makes him still thy guardian and secure  To share his bright beatitude with thee  LXXXI  Just mourner if too weak this plaintive song  Duly to honour whom our grief reveres  PardonI add as conscious of the wrong  To failing language more expressive tears  FINIS  NOTES TO THE  ELEGY  NOTE STANZA IV  "Echoing the liberal voice of friendly Shore"  THE honourable Sir JOHN SHORE who succeeded Sir WILLIAM JONES as president of the Asiatic society delivered in his first address to that assembly a very just and eloquent eulogium on his accomplished predecessorSome lines in the preceding stanza allude to the following passage in the discourse of Sir JOHN SHORE  The Pandits who were in the habit of attending him Sir WM JONES when I saw them after his death at a public Durbar could neither suppress their tears for his loss nor find terms to express their admiration at the wonderful progress he had made in their sciences  I shall embrace with pleasure every opportunity of illustrating this poem and of honouring the justly lamented personage whom it aspires to celebrate by unreserved quotation of the manly and graceful panegyric from which I have transcribed the preceding paragraph  NOTE STANZA VIII  "Early to thee obedient Language brought"  THE erudition of Sir WILLIAM JONES was admirable not only from its extraordinary extent but from having been acquired to an astonishing degree at a very early period of life  Before the expiration of his twentysecond year says his friend and eulogist he had compleated his Commentaries on the Poetry of the Asiatics although a considerable time afterwards elapsed before their publication  Sir JOHN proceeds to commend this work very justly as a compleat proof of the Author's consummate skill in a variety of languages and as a juvenile monument of taste talents and application without example Let me add that this early production discovers also a heart full of gentle affections and a mind that already conceived and expressed its ideas with singular energy and freedom I allude particularly to the very pathetic tribute of gratitude and praise which the Author paid in his Prooemium to his friend and instructor then recently deceased ROBERT SUMNER the master of Harrow school and to the two following passages of the book in the first he is speaking of satire in the second of heroic poetry  Atqui ut aperte dicam quod sentio valde invitus in poetarum chorum satyricos ut vocantur ascribo Nolo mansuetiarum musarum desiderari benevolentiam  Poeseos Asiat Comment cap    Quid de legibus poeticis sentiam quibusque causis adductus eas pro nihilo putem commodiorem inveniam exponendi locum  cap    NOTE STANZA XI  "The pride of joy in Gama's gallant frame"  WHEN the Portugueze Admiral VASCO DE GAMA was proceeding on his great enterprize the discovery of the East Indies after he had weathered the tremendous storms that assailed him  near the Cape he is said to have exulted in that omen and assurance of success which he found in the odours wafted to him from an invisible shore odours thus finely described by Milton with local exactitude  To them who sail  Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past  Mozambic off at sea northeast winds blow  Sabean odours from the spicy shore  Of Araby the Blest with such delay  Well pleas'd they slack their course and many a league  Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles  Paradise Lost Book IV ver  NOTE IV STANZA  "A Persian casket for a Northern Prince"  THE life of NADER SHAH an Eastern Manuscript brought to England by the King of Denmark It was translated into French at the request of that monarch by Sir WILLIAM JONES who at first declined the task  alledging for his excuse the length of the book the dryness of the subject the difficulty of the style c  but he was at last induced to undertake it by the most liberal motives and chiefly by the following consideration expressed in his own words  That it would be a reflection upon this country if the King should be obliged to carry the manuscript into France  The French version executed by our incomparable linguist was published in when the translator had attained only his th year  NOTE V STANZA  "What generous plaints of indignation burst"  THIS verse alludes to the following passage towards the close of an admirable Preface to the Life of NADER SHAH new modelled for the benefit of the English reader and published in  It is a painful consideration that the profession of Literature by far the most laborious of any leads to no real benefit or true glory whatsoever Poetry Science Letters when they are not made the sole business of life may become its ornaments in prosperity and its most pleasing consolation in a change of fortune but if a man addicts himself entirely to learning and hopes by  that  either to raise a family or to acquire what so many wish for and so few ever attain an honourable retirement in his declining age he will find when it is too late that he has mistaken his path that other labours other studies are necessary and that unless he can assert his own independence in active life it will avail him little to be favoured by the learned esteemed by the eminent or recommended even by kings  These reflections can hardly be suggested too frequently to the consideration of those ingenuous youths who happen to have conceived a very ardent passion for literature It was happy for our great Orientalist that his own peculiar energy of mind enabled him to form such reflections at an early period of life before the gates of professional prosperity were barred against his laudable ambition otherwise it is but too probable that with unexampled hoards of erudition united to a most benevolent temper he might have pined in a state of neglect and mortification instead of rising to be one of the most conspicuous and most useful characters in the polished age which his writings have contributed to enlighten and adorn  I cannot close this note without remarking that the Preface to the English Life of NADER SHAH which gave rise to it contains many excellent remarks on historical writing It was the custom of our universal scholar to delineate in a philosophic and masterly survey the province of literature to which the object of his immediate labour belonged Thus to his volume of Asiatic Poems he has added two admirable Essays on Poetry and his translation of ISAEUS is elucidated by a prefatory discourse and a commentary  replete with legal and classical information As a writer both of verse and prose his consummate knowledge of languages enabled him to vary and adapt his style to his subject with all the graces of exquisite propriety  NOTE STANZA XVIII  "Proclaiming Law thy life's acknowledg'd Queen"  AN allusion to the following elegant Latin verses in which Sir WILLIAM JONES bade adieu to the Muse and devoted himself to his profession  Vale Camena blandacultrix ingeni  Virtutis altrix mater eloquentiae  Linquenda alumno est laurus et chelys tuo  At O dearum dulcium dulcissima  Sea Suada mavis sive Pitho dicier  A to receptus in tua vivam side  Mihi sit oro non inutilis toga  Nec indiserta lingua nec turpis manus  An interesting address which proved as Sir JOHN SHORE affectionately observes most truly prophetic  NOTE STANZA XIX  "Her throne the bosom of her parent God"  THE ideas and language of this stanza are partly borrowed from the sublime panegyric on law with which the celebrated HOOKER concludes the first book of his Ecclesiastical Polity  NOTE STANZA XXII  "With pensive zeal and exultation just"  THESE lines allude to the following very pleasing description which Sir WILLIAM JONES has given of his approach to India in his first public discourse as President of the Asiatic Society  "When I was at sea last August on my voyage to this country which I had long and ardently desired to visit I found one evening on inspecting the observations of the day that India lay before us and Persia on our left while a breeze from Arabia blew nearly on our stern A situation so pleasing in itself and to me so new could not fail to awaken a train of reflections in a mind which had early been accustomed to contemplate with delight the eventful histories and agreeable fictions of this Eastern world It gave me inexpressible pleasure to find myself in the midst of so noble an amphitheatre almost encircled by the vast regions of Asia which has ever been esteemed the nurse of sciences the inventress of delightful and useful arts the scene of glorious actions fertile in the productions of human genius abounding in natural wonders and infinitely diversified in the forms of religion and government in the laws manners customs and languages as well as in the features and complexions of men I could not help remarking how important and extensive a field was yet unexplored and how many solid advantages unimproved"  Asiatick Researches  vol i p  These reflections led Sir WILLIAM by degrees to the foundation of the Asiatic Society and never was a man more happily qualified by nature and education to be the founder and the guide of such a respectable institution since in addition to his own singular talents for the rapid acquisition and ready communication of knowledge he was distinguished by such engaging manners as enabled him most happily to call forth and encourage the faculties of all around him His unrivalled erudition was so far from rendering him dogmatical or repulsive that no man ever spoke with more genuine modesty of his own merit no man could exert more candour and liberality in estimating the merit of others In his writings the rare extent of his knowledge is always accompanied by an equally rare sweetness and generosity of spirit which give a peculiar charm to his composition whenever he has occasion  to mention an author distinguished in the branch of literature immediately before him A striking instance of this spirit occurs to my recollection in his Essay on the Law of Bailments where he describes the legal treatises of a venerable French professor and judge M Pothier in a strain of applause uncommonly animated and graceful  NOTE STANZA XXVIII  "But from thy toil's variety and weight"  A YOUNG Student may find a most pleasing incentive to mental exertion in contemplating the very wonderful literary acquisitions and atchievements of Sir WILLIAM JONES a regular and minute enumeration and estimate of these we may hope to see from the leisure of some accomplished individual among his many Asiatic friends whom an intimate acquaintance with his extensive labours and an equal affection for his endearing virtues may engage in the office of his Biographer The Memorial of Sir JOHN SHORE is an excellent prelude to such a work Sir JOHN after mentioning his predecessor's most remarkable productions inserts in his discourse a paper entitled  "Desiderata"  a list of curious and important projected works relating to India Arabia China and Tartary On this paper of his departed friend he makes the following observation  "We are not authorized to conclude that he had himself formed a determination to compleat the works which his genius and knowledge had thus sketched the task seems to require a period beyond the probable duration of any human life but we who had the happiness to know Sir WILLIAM JONES who were witnesses of his indefatigable perseverance in the pursuit of knowledge and of his ardour to accomplish whatever he deemed important who saw the extent of his intellectual powers his wonderful attainments in literature and science and the facility with  which all his compositions were made cannot doubt if it had pleased Providence to protract the date of his existence that he would have ably executed much of what he had so extensively planned  It cannot be deemed useless or superfluous to enquire by what arts or method he was enabled to attain to a degree of knowledge almost universal and apparently beyond the powers of man during a lise little exceeding fortyseven years  "The faculties of his mind by nature vigorous were improved by constant exercise and his memory by habitual practice had acquired a capacity of retaining whatever had been once impressed upon it To an unextinguished ardour for universal knowledge he joined a perseverance in the pursuit of it which subdued all obstacles his studies began with the dawn and during the intermission of professional duties were continued throughout the day Reflection and meditation strengthened and confirmed what industry and investigation had accumulated It was a fixt principle with him from which he never voluntarily deviated not to be deterred by any difficulties that were surmountable from prosecuting to a successful termination what he had once deliberately undertaken  "But what appears to me to have enabled him to employ his talents so much to his own and the public advantage was the regular allotment of his time to particular occupations and a scrupulous adherence to the distribution which he had fixed hence all his studies were pursued without interruption or confusion Nor can I here omit remarking what may probably have attracted your observation as well as mine the candour and complacency with which he gave his attention to all persons of whatsoever quality talent or education he justly concluded that curious or important information might be gained from the illiterate and wherever it was to be obtained he sought and seized it"  In the very brief list of eminent men who have compleatly united the opposite advantages arising from a life of business and a life of meditation perhaps Cicero is the personage who may be most properly compared with Sir WILLIAM JONES The great Roman has been often considered as without a parallel in the diversity and magnitude of his mental accomplishments yet who will now hesitate to declare that in extent of erudition in elegance and energy of mind and above all in the tenderness and integrity of his private and public life he was far from being superior to our accomplished countryman  NOTE STANZA XXXII  "Thine the loud torrent of her Epic song"  THE commentaries on Asiatic poetry contain a very spirited Latin version of a passage from the Persian Heroic Poem of FERDUSI whom the poetical Commentator describes as a rival of Homer  Nullum est ab Europaeis scriptum poema quod ad Homeri dignitatem et quasi caelestem ardorem proprius accedat  A large portion of FERDUSI has since appeared in an English dress but I fear without obtaining in England either for the Persian Homer or the English Poet his translator the admiration due to original genius or the just recompence of elegant labour Let me add however that JONES'S specimen of the Persian Epic Poetry attracted the notice and obtained the praise of learned foreigners it is inserted by the Abate TODERINI in his copious and entertaining work entitled Letteratura Turchesea with the following commendation  "Ferdusi maraviglioso poeta epico onor della Persiana poesia nel suo libro Sha Nama eroicamente descrive le geste degli eroi  dei re Persiani Il Jones ne tradusse un lungo tratto Omeriano  bellissimo in versi Latini che sentono della maniera Virgiliana con cui adorno questo mio libro"  Toderini  tome p  NOTE STANZA XXXIII  "Usher'd young Althorp into Hymen's fane"  A SPRIGHTLY and graceful ode entitled "The Muse recalled" occasioned by the nuptials of Lord Viscount ALTHORP the present Earl SPENCER and Miss LAVINIA BINGHAM eldest daughter of CHARLES Lord LUCAN was printed at Strawberry Hill  NOTE STANZA XXXV  "Thy well train'd youth attested all his worth"  IN addressing his noble young friend on the most joyous occasion the high toned spirit of the Poet led him to blend indignant sentiments of public virtue with the gaiety of a nuptial song The ode contains a manly strain of freedom united to the elegance and delicacy with which it celebrates the peculiar talents of the lovely bride  "Each morn reclin'd on many a rose  "Lavinia's pencil shall disclose  "New forms of dignity and grace  "Th' expressive air th' empassioned face" c  May I be allowed to express a wish that the pencil so justly praised may employ itself in honouring the memory of him who spoke in these friendly verses his perfect sense of its power  NOTE STANZA XLII  "The daring hand of Aeschylus pourtray'd"            Aeschili Persae  ver  Methought two women stood before my eyes  Gorgeously vested one in Persian robes  Adorn'd the other in the Doric garb  With more than mortal majesty they moved  Of peerless beauty sisters too they seemed  Tho' distant each from each they chanc'd to dwell  In Greece the one on the Barbaric coast  The other  Potter's Translation  NOTE STANZA XLVIII  "Who raised to new renown their social band"  THE seven Arabian Poems which were suspended on the Temple at Mecca were translated and published by our Author in with an argument to each poem and the original annexed in Roman letters This publication is peculiarly endeared to those who love the memory of Sir WILLIAM JONES by containing his portrait well engraved by HALL from a picture of REYNOLDS  NOTE STANZA XLIX  "Pierc'd the deep moral of their mystic song"  IN the third volume of the Asiatic Researches the President inserted an admirable Dissertation on the Mystical Poetry of the Persians and Hindus  NOTE XVI STANZA  "Menu and Calidasa grace the scene"  FROM an ardent and truly noble desire to befriend the natives of that country where he was appointed to administer justice Sir WILLIAM JONES was led "to suggest to government a work of national utility and importance the compilation of a copious digest of Hindu and Mahommedan laws from Sanscrit and Arabic originals with an offer of his services to superintend the compilation and with a promise to translate itTo the superintendance of this work which was immediately undertaken at his suggestion he assiduously devoted those hours which he could spare from his professional duties  "During the course of this compilation and as auxiliary to it he was led to study the works of MENU reputed by the Hindus to be the oldest and holiest of legislators and finding them to comprize a system of religious and civil duties and of law in all its branches so comprehensive and minutely exact that it might be considered as the institutes of Hindu law he presented a translation of them to the government of Bengal"  Sir John Shore's Discourse  When Sir WILLIAM JONES enquired of "a very sensible Brahman which of the Indian dramas was most universally esteemed he answered without hesitation Sacontala supporting his opinion as usual among the Pandits by a couplet to this effect  "The Ring of Sacontala in which the th act and four stanzas of that act are eminently brilliant displays all the rich exuberance of Calidasa's genius"  This circumstance induced our great Orientalist to peruse and translate Sacontala which he has given to the public to use his own very just expressions "as a most pleasing and authentic picture of old Hindu manners and one of the greatest curiosities that  the literature of Asia has yet brought to light" I presume most English readers are familiar with the merits of this singular and admirable drama as it has lately been reprinted in a pocket volume  NOTE XVII STANZA  "Soon to its parent shell the gem restored"  THIS stanza is a free translation of an Asiatic eulogy on a celebrated Vizir of whose benevolent and philosophic character the reader may find a pleasing anecdote in POCOCK'S edition of ABUL FEREGEIn the Commentaries on Asiatic Poetry this little specimen of Eastern elegy is thus rendered in Latin verse  Illustris fuit ille margarita  Purâ luce nitens colore puro  Quam gemmae pretium latere questus  Conchae restituit Deus parenti  THERE is I trust no impropriety in applying to Sir WILLIAM JONES an Oriental encomium which he particularly admired and which I believe no individual in any quarter of the globe could more truly deserve  NOTE XVIII STANZA  "He drew and fashion'd for the public use"  I HAVE presumed without the knowledge of my friend to allude in this stanza to a monumental drawing of Mr FLAXMAN in which he has represented Sir WILLIAM JONES collecting information from the Pandits to settle the Digest of Hindu and Mahommedan Law  NOTE XIX STANZA  "Clasp'd a new science with a lever's zeal"  "HIS last and favourite pursuit says Sir JOHN SHORE was the study of Botany which he originally began under the confinement of a severe and lingering disorder which with most minds would have proved a disqualification from any application It constituted the principal amusement of his leisure hours In the arrangement of Linnaeus he discovered system truth and science which never failed to captivate and engage his attention and from the proofs which he has exhibited of his progress in Botany we may conclude that he would have extended the discoveries in that science The last composition which he read to this Society was a description of select Indian plants"  NOTE XX STANZA  "On a drear confine betwixt life and death"  A WRITER who has experienced great favour from the public may be thought I hope to discover more of gratitude than of vanity in thus touching upon a personal misfortune that condemned him to a long period of mental inactivity  NOTE XXI STANZA  "I fondly greeted with fraternal praise"  MAY I be permitted to remark that the Essay on Epic Poetry first published in contains the lines relating to the ever esteemed subject of this publication  O thou bright Spirit whom the Asian Muse  Had fondly steeped in all her fragrant dews▪  And o'er whose early song that mental feast  She breath'd the sweetness of the rifled East  Since independent honours high controul  Detach'd from poesy thy ardent soul  To seek with better hopes Persuasion's seat  Blest be those hopes and happy that retreat  Which with regret all British bards must see  And mourn a brother lost in losing thee  NOTE XXII STANZA  "Temper'd the judge and dignified the bard"  A MILD and rational piety may be regarded as the crowning excellence of a character compleatly accomplished This excellence was possessed in a very happy degree by the incomparable personage to whose honour this imperfect memorial is affectionately devoted I cite with peculiar pleasure on this article the testimony of his intelligent and worthy eulogist Sir JOHN SHORE who having mentioned the marvellous variety and extent of his predecessor's mental powers observes that "from the most renowned poets and philosophers of Greece Rome and Asia he could turn with equal delight and knowledge to the sublime speculations of BARROW and NEWTON With them also he professed his conviction of the truth of the Christian religion and he justly deemed it no inconsiderable advantage that his researches had corroborated the multiplied evidence of revelation by confirming the Mosaic account of the primitive world"  Let me add that it is possible he may have rendered infinitely greater services to religion by the admirable suggestion in the close of his Discourse on the Gods of Greece Italy and India He  there points out what occurred to him as the only promising mode of converting the Musulmans and Hindus to Christianity and perhaps the most worthy honour which the Asiatic Society could pay to the memory of Sir WILLIAM JONES would be to resume and realize his idea the experiment is easy and should it succeed in any degree that success will form the noblest eulogy of the beneficent spirit by whom it was suggested  FINIS  New Editions of the following have been lately published by  CADELL
