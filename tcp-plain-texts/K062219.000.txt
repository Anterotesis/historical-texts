 AMABELLA A POEM  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ROBSON BOOKSELLER AT THE FEATHERS IN NEW BOND STREET  M DCC LXVIII  TO MRS MONTAGU THIS LITTLE POEM WROTE AT HER SUGGESTION IN THE FORM OF AN ELEGIAC DIALOGUE WITH THE GREATEST ESTEEM FOR HER JUDGMENT IS INSCRIBED BY HER RESPECTFUL HUMBLE SERVANT  EDWARD JERNINGHAM  ADVERTISEMENT  THE subject of this poem is founded on a circumstance that happened during the late war A young lady not meeting with the concurrence of her relations in favour of an officer for whom she expressed her regard was prevailed upon by his solicitations to consent to a clandestine marriage which took place on the day he sat out to join his regiment abroad where he was unfortunately killed in an engagement  AMABELLA  HARMODIUS breath'd the rural air nor found  His ruddy health with length of years decrease  By duty prompted AMABELLA crown'd  His silver forehead with the wreath of peace  BY partial nature fram'd in beauty's mould  Adorn'd with ev'ry grace unspoil'd by art  To friendship's circle still did she unfold  The lovelier beauties of a feeling heart  ENDEAR'D to all she met each welcome day  By fortune's hand with various blessings fraught  When lo her gayety's accustom'd ray  Was quench'd untimely with the gloom of thought  WHAT fix'd the bosomthorn affliction knows  Where peace sat brooding as the gentle dove  What blasted on her cheek the summer rose  Or slow disease or unsuccessful love  REMAIN'D unknown'Twas by the many guess'd  That love to her soft vows had prov'd unkind  Beyond the pow'r of her weak frame oppress'd  Insanity o'erthrew her lovely mind  AT length recov'ring yet to grief devote  To solitude she gave th' unsocial day  Like a pale vot'ry from the world remote  Uncheer'd unvisited of pleasure's ray  OFT did HARMODIUS at her state dismay'd  Solicit from his child her secret pain  Her vague reply still from his question stray'd  And each repeated effort prov'd in vain  To speed the moments of the loit'ring hour  And by their plaintive strains perchance allur'd  Within a spacious myrtlewoven bow'r  Two turtle doves the pensive fair secur'd  "YE little captives wou'd she often say  "Tho' here secluded from the fields of air  "Thro' yonder vernal grove forbid to stray  "And join the kindred train that wanton there  "'GAINST you the gunner never lifts his arm  "Nor o'er this mansion does the falcon sail  "You live unconscious of the storm's alarm  "The rain impetuous and the beating hail  "NOR here by kind compassion unimpress'd  "The schoolboy ever rears his impious hand  "To fill with agony the feather'd breast  "And raze the little domes that love had plan'd"  THEIR harmless joys disease too soon effac'd  One fatal morn her Turturella's mate  She found with flagging wing subdued oppress'd  And just sinking at the blow of fate  WHILE down her cheek compassion's show'r distill'd  She gently rais'd it to her anxious breast  But death's cold blast life's crimson current chill'd  And thus the fair her breathless bird address'd  "ILLFATED turtle round whose peaceful bow'r  "The jocund loves so lately wont to play  "How sunk alas in youth's exulting hour  "To fell disease to death th' untimely prey  "How silent is the voice which void of art  "Along the tender day was heard to coo  "How still how frozen is the constant heart  "Which to its dear companion beat so true  "THAT dear companion that now widow'd dove  "To screen from every harm be mine the care  "And while she mourns her ne'er reviving love  "Her grief to me the mourner will endear  "LIKE thee a widow too condemn'd to mourn  "No more to me does life unfold its charms  "Death death forbids him ever to return"  She saidand sunk into th' attendant's arms  HER swift relapsing to her former state  With boding fears approach'd the serving train  This scene's dread period tremblingly they wait  Nor were their boding fears indulg'd in vain  AWAKNING from her trance around she threw  Distressful fair her much disorder d deyes  And wild'ring said"repeat that kind adieu  "Ah no from love to war to death he flies  "DID ye not hear the clash of hostile spears  "Ah mark ye not that breastplate stain'd with gore  "What groan was that which pearc'd these fearful ears  He falls he fallsmy warrior is no more  "NOR was Oh heav'n his AMABELLA near  "To sooth his Pain and echo sigh to sigh  "Drop on the gaping wound a balmy tear  "Kiss his cold lip and close his fading eye"  OF her distress th' alarm'd HARMODIUS taught  With trembling steps approach'd th' unconscious fair  "Give me he cried with grief paternal fraught  "Give me Oh AMABEL' to sooth thy care  "SAY what affliction has thy soul impress d  "Reveal what storm thy bosom'd calmness breaks  "Revealand thus relieve this anguish d breast  "The tender father to his daughter speaks  AMABELLA  "AH what avails the praise the brave obtain  "Thro' his white bosom rush'd the hostile steel  "'Twas his to swell the number of the slain  "And mine affliction's keenest point to feel"  HARMODIUS  "HER roving thought no trace of reason bears  "To her rack'd mind Oh heav'n thy peace impart  "A loving parent bathes thy cheek with tears  "HARMODIUS holds thee to his breaking heart"  AMABELLA  "To thee I grateful kneel Oh generous seer  "Who dost to one unknown thy care extend  "Along thy path may Peace her olives rear  "And heav'n in battle shield thy dearest friend  "FOR me who droop beneath misfortune's show'r  "I had a fathernow alas a foe  "Thou'lt blush to hearin sorrow's darkest hour  "He leaves his child abandon'd to her woe  "BUT to thy heart that's fram'd of softer mould  "What can to thee a wretch like me endear  "The spring the motive of thy love unfold  "Say say for me why flows that friendly tear  "YET soft awhilemethinks that hoary brow  That plaintive voiceAh bear with my distress  "Or much remembrance is effac'd or now  "A tender father's teardew'd cheek I press"  HARMODIUS  "ON knees of gratitude I bless the skies  "That AMABELLA to herself restore"  AMABELLA  "Ah wherefore dost thou joy thy daughter dies  "Support me to yon couchI can no more"  "I FEEL I feel the pulse of life retire  "Ah deign to hear thy dying child reveal  "What in rebellion to thy just desire  "Lock'd in her breast she dar'd so long conceal  "BY thee unsanction'd did I plight my love  "And all to thee unknown a bride became"  HARMODIUS  "HARMODIUS will to both a father prove"  AMABELLA  "To him thy pardon thou canst ne'er proclaim  "THREE fleeting hours had scarcely call'd me bride  "When he was summon'd to the martial plain  "And thereforgive these tearsin beauty's pride  "The much lamented valiant youth was slain  "WHAT tho' unworthy of thy care I prove  "To thy remembrance let thy child be dear  "Thy kind compassion let the daughter move  "When this weak frame shall press th' untimely bier"  MORE wou'd she sayher voice began to fail  From her faint eye life's ling'ring spark retir'd  The rip'ning cherry on her lip grew pale  She heav'd a sigh and in that sigh expir'd  FINIS
