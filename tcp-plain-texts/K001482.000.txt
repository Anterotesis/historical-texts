WOULD you live lads a life of jollity  Take a touch here of our quality  To us soldiers come  Here Bacchus of Mars beats the drum  While Venus attending  Our joy is befriending  Your zeal then to shew to the field and the fair  Quickly here to the standard of pleasure repair  Does the loud trumpet call to glory  Or flute to tell some am'rous story  Alike alert in ev'ry duty  Now war his passion and now beauty  He fights the foe or courts the fair  Can kindly love or bravely dare  And honour seek 'midst clashing arms  Well to deserve his mistress' charms  Would you live lads c  PLATOON  Finesounding wordshonour and fame  I says they're nothing but a name  Courage and merit are neglected  We gemmen soldiers an't respected  We're only thought by monkey beaux  With paper skulls and powder'd cloaths  And silks and sattins bags and fine tails  Fit only for the cat o' nine tails  CUDDEN  'Cod well zed corp'ralfolks may boast  But zummet's wronghere goes a toast  Here's may they long be zick i' their beds  Who first madejumping over heads  ALL  Bravo my boy  CUDDEN  Lawyer what zayst  LATITAT  I says o' th' great that bad's the best  And harkee  Whispers  CUDDEN  No  LATITAT  True  CUDDEN  Indeed  LATITAT  Fact  Sponge  CUDDEN  Good Lord  LATITAT  Gen'ral bankrupt act  CUDDEN  That's gwain to ruin thicker and faster  What's thy opinion friend schoolmaster  BIRCH  Why if they'd take th' advice of a fool  Your great ones should be sent to school  STUD  I says that while upon my grounds  They'll let me hunt my pack of hounds  It matters nothing what their ways are  What do you say to this friend Razor  RAZOR  I says take matters in the gross  As how I thinks we're shav'd too close  PLATOON  You think old Strap and Sudsyouyou  Did I command what would I do  I'd raise each soldier's pay diurnal  And ev'ry corp'ral make a col'nel  CLUMP  Cod well said corporal again  PLATOON  Plunder  PLUNDER  Here  PLATOON  Muster all the men  See their accoutrements are new  This ev'ning's fix'd for the review  When Phoebus shall in all his charms  Glitt'ring adorn the soldier's arms  AIR  This this my lad is a soldier's life  He marches to the sprightly fife  And in each town to some new wife  Swears he'll be ever true  He's here he's there where is he not  Variety's his envied lot  He eats drinks sleeps and pays no shot  And follows the loud tattoo  II  Call'd out to face his country's foes  The tears of fond domestic woes  He kisses off and boldly goes  To earn of fame his due  Religion liberty and laws  Both his are and his country's cause  For these thro' dangers without pause  He follows the loud tattoo  III  And if at last in honour's wars  He earns his share of danger's scars  Still he feels bold and thanks his stars  He's no worse fate to rue  At Chelsea free from toil and pain  He weilds his crutchpoints out the slain  And in fond fancy once again  Follows the loud tattoo  SCENE II  All go off except  CUDDEN  and  PLATOON  CUDDEN  Here jog a tiny bit this way  PLATOON  What say'st my hearty  CUDDEN  What do I zay  Can'st keep a secret be one's friend  PLATOON  Upon my sword  CUDDEN  Nay there's no end  When soldiers their fine oaths begin  Hark thee to meThou know'st our Jin  She loves this mazzard heredev'l fetch me  And yet I do not think she'll catch me  PLATOON  Why notshe's young  CUDDEN  She is and fairish  But lookee I knows all the parish  And spite o' their simp'ring smiles and frippery  There never was an eel so slippery  Besides in your ear I've had my will of her  And so I am more doubtful still of her  Now this is what I wants to do  To try our Jinso say but you  I'm with the other honest hearts  Listed and gwain to voreign parts  I soon shall by her wimp'ring see  If as she ought our Jin loves me  PLATOON  Enough said ladhere take this crown  As part o' th' listing money down  CUDDEN  Nay that's as easy done as spoke  'Twon't list me tho'  PLATOON  Pho that's a joke  CUDDEN  I understandyou'll say d'ye hear  That I am listed  PLATOON  Never fear  Nay zounds I'll swear it if that's all  Marchturn your toes outat roll call  Fail not tomorrow sir  CUDDEN  Ods curse it  How very natural he does it  AIR  Good Lord 'tis a wondersome sight to behold  The soldiers bedaub'd all with silver and gold  And to hear for miles off the loud drum and fife  How they thump 'em and blow 'em away for dear life  While the girls slyly watch to chuse him for a lover  Who readiest and best  Can turn on his heel  Can march and can rest  And shoulder to boot  And face to the right and to the left wheel  And present and make ready and fire and shoot  And come to a handsome recover  II  The moment a village the red coats come in  The wenches good Lord how they titter and grin  And 'teant only the young ones that crowd on the green  But all ages from seventy down to sixteen  While the girls c  SCENE III  The Village a poor House is seen  CLUMP  is working in a Stall underneath the Window  JUDE  is withinside ironing and  JENNY  fits on a Bench at the Door knitting  TRIO  Neighbour neighbour  Work away  What like labour  Makes us gay  The world is sad  It knows not why  Your poets in rhimes  May rail at the times  But since they're so bad  And no cure's to be had  'Tis better to laugh than to cry  But look behind  And you shall find  For one poor pleasureplagues a score  Nor is I fear  One whit more clear  The prospect should you look before  Then far beyond blind Fortune's pow'r  Live and enjoy the present hour  RECITATIVE  JUDE  I'faith I must not loiter so  Give me my basket  CLUMP  Ere you go  I would thou'd'st speak a good word for me  JUDE  Whence is it girl thy looks are stormy  T' our old friend Clumpwhen o' the sudden  They still clear up for that rogue Cudden  JENNY  Why mother if you will be told  I like not Clump because he's old  Besides my Cudden's smart and gay  And drinks and rakes all niggledy jay  O Cudden Cudden thou has won me  And then he's rich too  JUDE  Mercy on me  How she does rattleJenny Jenny  Don't be a foolish headstrong ninny  If thou say'st nay because Clump's poor  Thou ought'st not to be blest for sure  For as there's no state e'er so high  But has at times it's misery  So those in station e'er so low  Some sweet contented moments know  AIR  The world's a strange world child it must be confess'd  We all of distress have our share  But since I must struggle to live with the rest  By my troth 'tis no great matter where  We all must put up with what fortune has sent  Be therefore one's lot poor or rich  So there's but a portion of ease and content  By my troth 'tis no great matter which  II  A living's a living and so there's an end  If one honestly gets just enow  And something to spare for the wants of a friend  By my troth 'tis no great matter how  In this world about nothing we busied appear  And I've said it again and again  Since quit it one must if one's conscience is clear  By my troth 'tis no great matter when  SCENE IV  CLUMP JENNY  CLUMP  Oh dear our Jin  JENNY  What  CLUMP  Nan  JENNY  The brute  CLUMP  Pray let me get the length o' your foot  JENNY  How what win my affections you  CLUMP  Yes Inow prythee buckle too  JENNY  Oh no  CLUMP  And you're determin'd  JENNY  Yes  CLUMP  And why  JENNY  For reasons you can't guess  CLUMP  Nay where th' shoe pinches you may swear it  None know so well as them that wear it  JENNY  You're not my choice  CLUMP  Why aye that's true  But then you know often a shoe  That's ready made will fit some folk  As well as if 't had been bespoke  JENNY  And then such difference between  Our agesI am scarce sixteen  And you how much  CLUMP  But sixtythree  JENNY  And prythee how would that agree  CLUMP  Why just as if I put together  An old sole t' a new upper leather  JENNY  Ho ho it takes away the breath o' me  CLUMP  Od rot thee Jinthou'lt be the death o' me  AIR  Whenever I'm mending a shoe  Ev'ry thing in my stall that I view  To my doating remembrance brings you  While my heart in my bosom goes thump  The best callimanco's your hair  Your skin is the lining so fair  My awl to your eyes I compare  That wounded the heart of poor Clump  II  Your teeth which like ivory shew  Are the pegs in a white even row  Which I drive while at every blow  My heart in my bosom goes thump  Each object of you bears a part  Your wit that's so piercing and smart  Is my knifebut my lapstone your heart  Which will ne'er let you pity poor Clump  SCENE V  JENNY FANNY  JENNY  Thus I'm oblig'd to act the part  Of pleasure with an aching heart  For tho' I scoff at this poor elf  I'm not much better off myself  Ah Cousin Fanny trick'd out too  FANNY  I'm going child to the review  To see my soldier in the field  His bayonet draw his musquet wield  To see him to the rank repair  More willingly because I'm there  AIR  When in order drawn up and adorn'd in his best  If my soldier appears with more grace than the rest  If his gaiters are jet his accoutrements fine  If his hair's tied up tight and his arms brightly shine  Let him turn wheel or face march kneel stoop and stand  Anxious still to obey every word of command  Erect like an arrow or bending his knee  'Tis not for the gen'ral 'tis all to please me  II  If with smoke and with dust cover'd over by turns  To gain a sham height or false bastion he burns  If of danger in spite and regardless of fear  He rushes to fight when there's nobody near  In short let him turn wheel march c c  SCENE VI  PLATOON JENNY FANNY  RECITATIVE  FANNY  And see I scarcely sound love's drums  But at my call my soldier comes  PLATOON  My FannyWhat and Jenny here  I've news that shall thy spirits cheer  For which thou'lt give me ample thanks  Cudden shall pay thee for his pranks  JENNY  What pranks  FANNY  Nay coy it not to us  The best will be too amorous  Sometimes spite of the nicest care  When at our feet men sigh and swear  JENNY  I plainly see he has told all  Women should think before they fall  Lest they that hour survive and weep  Prudence by love was lull'd to sleep  AIR  A novice in love and a stranger to art  As pure as my wishes my unpractis'd heart  When I rose with the lark and outwarbled the thrush  Free from falshood or guile for I knew not to blush  Those past days I deplore  When innocence guarded my unfully'd fame  When to think and to act and commend were the same  When on my face  With artless grace  Danc'd frolick sport and pleasurenow no more  II  Ere I listen'd and lov'd ere man smil'd and betray'd  Ere by horror appall'd and of conscience afraid  Lost to each fond delight that e'er woman adorn'd  By a hardjudging world look'd at pity'd and scorn'd  Those past joys I deplore  Those joys ere by man's artful treach'ry forsook  Which guiltless and pleas'd with the world I partook  When on my face  With artless grace  Danc'd frolick sport and pleasurenow no more  PLATOON  Well cheer thy spiritshe's  JENNY  Well what of him  PLATOON  Nothing but you'll get all shut of him  He's listed  JENNY  Listed  PLATOON  With a view  As he believes just to try you  But if you'll give into my whim  The scheme shall pretty well try him  FANNY  What is't Platoon  PLATOON  What are those drums  As sure as murder here he comes  SCENE VII  JENNY FANNY CLUMP  aukwardly dressed as a Drummer  Why what the devil have we here  CLUMP  I spose I looks a little queer  Alter'd all over dress and phiz  Come you shall hear how the thing is  The cruelty of that there creature  Thinks Ias how no human nature  Can't ne'er support and so I goes  Quite whelm'd as one may say with woes  To drown myselfwhere was Istay  Oh meeting neighbour Mudge i'th' way  Says neighbour Mudgewer't me I'd liver  Than like blind puppies drown i' th' river  For a captain listgrow great in story  Go to the wars and die with glory  And so d' ye see without more mystery  That I may make a noise in history  I'm come 'tis true for I'm no hummer  To you to list me for a drummer  PLATOON  A charming thoughtJenny my heart  Speak girl can'st act a sprightly part  JENNY  I could once ere to reason blind  I lov'd and lost my peace of mind  PLATOON  And shalt again girlClump this way  Dost thou love

attention to her lover  Follow thee Clump the whole world over  AIR  Say Fanny wilt thou go with me  Perils to face by land and sea  That tongue can never tell ye  And wilt thou all these dangers scorn  Whilst in these arms  I hold thy charms  Enraptur'd ev'ry op'ning morn  When the drum beats reveillez  FANNY  II  Yes yes PlatoonI'll go with thee  In danger whatsoe'r it be  Believe 'tis truth I tell you  My constant mind shall peril scorn  Brave all alarms  So in my arms  I hold thee every op'ning morn  When the drum beats reveillez  PLATOON  III  Still Fanny wilt thou go with me  Suppose the cruel fates decree  Alas how shall I tell you  The news should comethy soldier fell  And thou shalt hear  Appall'd with fear  Next morn his fatal passing bell  When the drum beats reveillez  FANNY  IV  Still fearless will I go with thee  Resign'd to cruel fate's decree  And bravely this I tell you  When on the spot my soldier fell  I'd shed a tear  The world should hear  Mingling with his my passing bell  While the drum beat reveillez  BOTH  V  To the world's end I'd go with thee  Where thou artdanger ne'er can be  My joy no tongue can tell you  And sure such love may perils scorn  Brave all alarms  While in my arms  I hold thee ev'ry op'ning morn  When the drums beat reveillez  CLUMP  I'll do't my boyI'm ready for'n  PLATOON  He's coming sure as you are born  SCENE VIII  PLATOON

frock  And Master Cudden as for thee  Thy Jenny is no wife for me  CUDDEN  Not married thou'st a good escape  ClumpHarkee look before dost leap  For fear d'ye see thy wife should cheat thee  Curse it I'm sorry that I beat thee  AIR  'Twere better I took your advice my good neighbour  Henceforward my conduct I'll mend  With joy and content to my  last  will I labour  Still striving to make a good  end  And then as to love I'll ne'er think of a woman  No never I'll swear it by goles  But like methodist preachers on Kennington Common  I'll live by the mending of soles  II  Many battles I'll

CUDDEN  Away to the wars then a soldier I'll go  To find in each quarter a wife  I'll roar and I'll rant wench a little or so  But no one shall snap me for life  For in spite of their fanzies I'll say
