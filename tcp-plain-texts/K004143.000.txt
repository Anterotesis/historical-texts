 THE FAST A POEM TRANSLATED FROM THE PROPHET ISAIAH  By the Rev  JAMES MURRAY  Wherefore have we fasted and thou seest not  Isaiah lviii  Price d  THE FAST  ISAIAH LVIII  Cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their sins  Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinances of their God They ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in approaching to God  Wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not Wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no know∣ledge Behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure and exact all your labours  Behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness Ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high  Is it such a fast that I have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him Wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord  Is not this the fast that I have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppres∣sed go free and that ye break every yoke  Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh    IN lofty accents let thy voice be heard  And shew the tribes the mandates of the Lord  Through all the land proclaim what crimes abound  Let every word loud like a trumpet sound  Spare neither age nor sex nor low nor high  Let all the house of Jacob hear thy cry  For from the lowest cottage to the throne  All ranks of men in paths of vice have gone  They much profess but yet their meaning's naught  For not one word's an emblem of their thought  In shew fictitious they draw nigh to me  And act as if Jehovah did not see  With pomp and splendor void of soul and grace  They pay devotion in my holy place  A pleasure counterfeit smiles on each brow  And songs melodious from their lips do flow  That such as see them in this apish mode  Would almost swear they did delight in God  Yet all is fictionif you mark their course  They still proceed from evil deeds to worse  Their state devotion's all an action feign'd  For when they worship God curs'd self's their end  Their slumb'ring priests like hirelings serve for pay  And idly sleep and saunter out the day  Like drowsy idle shepherds who at noon  Stretch out their lazy limbs upon the down  And sleep securely in the heat of day  While all their flocks do wander far astray  And when the rav'ning wolves the sheep devour  The shepherd lies supine and sleeps secure  At last the sluggard wakes and as a proof  He loves the flock he cries and scolds the wolf  So thus the shepherds of the sacred fold  They cannot watch but loudly can they scold  Even God himself they are so void of grace  They even dare to scold him to his face  'How vain is it for us to fast and pray  'To waste our labour and lament a day  'To vex our souls for sin for though that we  'Do fast and pray Jehovah will not see  'Or if he sees us pays us no regard  'Nor thinks our labour worthy of reward  'Our schemes are baffl'd and our troops defeat  'And all our wisest projects are too late  'The chiefs of Bozrah who obey'd our laws  'Have now rebell'd and Libnah's join'd their cause  'Now both are rebels and defy our hosts  'Defeat our armies and invade our coasts  'Yet we have fasted many a weary day  'But now we find it vain to fast and pray'  THE WORDS OF THE ALMIGHTY  Can such profane dissemblers think that I  Will either hear their voice or mind their cry  For when ye seem to fast in outward shew  You seek not things above but things below  Your souls are lofty and your hearts are proud  This all your actions do proclaim aloud  For when ye fast and feign t' afflict your souls  You swing in pleasure and ye swill in bowls  And when ye come to bow before my throne  Ye make your servants drudge like slaves at home  You never fast but when ye mean to smite  And never pray unless for power to fight  No more ye mean when ye your sins confess  Than to bribe heav'n for freedom to oppress  Think ye that God all gracious ever will  Regard their litanies who pray to kill  To kill and whom your very flesh and blood  Should I regard you how could I be good  Cease thus profanely to invoke my aid  Or think I'll help to kill the souls I've made  Ye tyrants dread my thunder fear your God  And tremble at the lifting of my rod  Is it a solemn fast to please the Lord  To bow the head and next transgress my word  Can sackcloth sanctified conceal your sin  Or hide from me your ugliness within  All space I view and all the orbs that roll  Mine eyes behold and penetrate the whole  Your inmost thoughts their secret springs I see  Proceed from selfish vile hypocrisy  To me's a fast an acceptable day  When none but hypocrites do fast and pray  When bended necks and stubborn hearts draw nigh  To offer vain requests to the Most High  Cry loud and long yet for no other ends  Except to kill their foes enslave their friends  Who never bend their knees before my bar  Till sin and guilt have plung'd them deep in war  And then they think that I am so unjust  To slaughter righteous men to feed their lust  Their lust of power and when they steal my word  Maintain they have dominion from the Lord  Their legislature though reverse to mine  They yet eclept a government divine  Such is their power and impudence of face  They'd swear that Satan's power proceeds from grace  Even Saul Manasseh Ahab all these three  Pretended each they had their power from me  Yet they from me had power no other way  Than wand'ring slaves have power to go astray  For power to live and move implies no more  Than to preserve what I have made before  Abuse of power depends upon men's will  And all must blame themselves when they do ill  All just dominion hath its base in right  And shines selfevident like beams of light  Man's lusts apart all mankind must agree  That only righteous power proceeds from me  None need dispute who has a right to rule  The God of wisdom ne'er appoints a fool  When fools wear crowns and tyrants sceptres sway  Then subjects sin not though they disobey  When legislative power's oppos'd to right  Men are not rul'd by justice but by might  Force is no law and violence no rule  Who practice either must be knave or fool  The scheme of government which I approve  Is that which rules the heart of man by love  What's Aaron's race or David's line to me  When priests are proud and kings love tyranny  The poor man's interest and his soul's as dear  In my esteem as those of prince or peer  Kings were appointed legislatures made  Mens int'rests to preserve not to invade  How great their power how far their might should go  Are things quite plain not difficult to shew  The end of power is universal good  A thing conspicuous easy understood  First do no ill than all the good you can  This is the end of government to man  INFERENCES  Kings often do and princes oftimes pray  For power to rule with universal sway  For royal proclamations seldom come  Abroad unless to bring dominion home  When kings proclaim a fast the blind may spy  They have at least a vineyard in their eye  Ahab than whom a baser prince ne'er sway'd  A scepter o'er a nation whin'd and pray'd  Proclaim'd a fast at Jezebel's command  And issu'd humiliation through the land  But underneath this mask dark vengeance lay  And Naboth suffer'd when the court did pray  The royal monarch gain'd his point at last  And consecrated murder by a fast  The venal minister's of Ahab's court  Meant more by tasting than a simple sport  Like cunning politicians who conceal  Their dark designs against the commonweal  Who lest some prying folk should chance to know  Strike up some novel masquerade or show  Some Cocklane Ghost or if these fail at last  Amuse the people with a  public  fast  State humiliations are but state engines  Intended chiefly to mask o'er black crimes  I Kings xxi to    Fasts seldom from the royal power proceed  Unless the prince is sadly pinch'd indeed  Give monarch's troops and but the treas'ry fill  They'll leave the tribes of men to fast who will  A poor exchequer and the reg'ments thin  To monarch's always is the greatest sin  When loads of wealth are squander'd on their lust  And all the pond'rous sums they hold in trust  Are scatter'd far abroad to gather power  They call it treason to refuse them more  The subjects must not judge although they pay  How much the king and courtiers throw away  Implicit faith to courts is reckon'd due  And none have right to judge except a few  Whose int'rest always blinds their judgments so  They never err be't ill or good they do  Thus faith politic like men's creed at Rome  Is free to be explor'd by only  some  The ignoble vulgar must remain content  Though monarchs should mortgage the continent  Thus speak the proud but hear th' Eternal say  What men should ponder when they fast and pray  THE WORD OF THE LORD  'He who proclaims a fast ought first to free  'His subjects from all yokes of tyranny  'Loose all unrighteous bands both more and less  'And cease e'en  helpless beggars  to oppress  'Set prisons open and the hungry feed  'Bring water to the thirsty when they need  'Give wholesome covering to the naked poor  'To all in want set open wide the door  'When to your home your helpless friends repair  'Let them have always ready welcome there  'Nor suffer sycophants for to deny  'Your presence when a needy friend stands by  'Then shall thy glory like the morning ray  'Burst forth in splendor and increase like day  'Health like a bubbling fountain shall spring forth  'And pleasures flow from east south west and north  'The trump of Fame before thy face shall bear  'Thy high renown and glory close the rear  'And when thy orisons shall ascend on high  'Thy God propitious shall attend thy cry  'Grant all thy suits and thy requests receive  'And even ere you ask shall answer give  'Throw every yoke but legal bands away  'Nor meanly rule with arbitrary sway  'For threat'ning proclamations never can  'Insure obedience or regard from man  'How vain is it to think when kings command  'That men should run if they but wag their hand'  Thus spoke Jehovah to the Jews of old  And this the Prophets to the Fathers told  Isaiah lviii    PART II  E'ER since the time that monarchies began  And monarchs claim'd dominion over man  Princes who aim'd at arbitrary sway  And meant to make their villains all obey  Have brib'd an hireling priesthood first to blind  The human conscience and debase the mind  For ev'ry tyrant if he loose his purse  Will find some Balaam ready with a curse  Chearful to listen to his Lord's command  To scatter heaven's vengeance through the land  False prophets Hannaniah like to tell  When every thing is wrong that all is well  Whose power of face and vilest impudence  Exceed the utmost bounds of all pretence  They think no shame to tell the grossest lies  And publish fictions for true prophecies  E'en when an host advances in array  Will gravely swear they saw them run away  Make ign'rant fools believe for there are fools  At all times ready to be great men's tools  That if they bow their heads or bend the knee  In formal feigned vile hypocrisy  With bashful looks conceal the worst intents  That then they keep divine commandements  When Zedekiah erst o'er Judah reign'd  And God's own people all his laws profan'd  False prophets then▪ as well as prophets since  Told lies and flattery to that weak prince  They augur'd all things as the courtiers will'd  But never found their prophecies fulfil'd  E'en those who trusted to their prophecies  In sad experience found them all prove lies  When Salem's stately towers and walls around  In ruins lay quite level with the ground  The temple sack'd and its foundation till'd  Then were their godly prophecies fulfil'd  Their haughty monarch whose perverted mind  To truth and all true discipline was blind  Who to his flatt'ring sycophants gave ear  For his credulity he soon paid dear  He saw his kingdom lost his city ta'en  His dearest offspring in his presence slain  What now he saw was all foretold before  He saw it true alas he saw no more  The cruel Chaldean then put out his eyes  And in his blindness prov'd the prophecies  Helkiah's son of Aaron's sacred line  Of Anathoth by augury divine  In strongest emblems shew'd his dismal fate  At last hew saw the truth but ah too late  When Babel's warlike sons approached near  And fill'd the tribes of Judah all with fear  The wise foresaw the land's approaching doom  And trembled for their miseries to come  But Azur's faithless son an augur base  Who yet at court pass'd for a child of grace  Brib'd by the ministry to publish lies  Came forth with asses loads of prophecies  Preach'd final conquest over every foe  His lying pasquils o'er the country go  Industrious spread by ministerial tools  To gull th' unwary and to flatter fools  Full fifty thousand in a month were sold  From Salem to Beersheba I am told  And when the faithless people would not buy  The courtiers gave them out of courtesy  So sanguine they to blind the people's eyes  They turned pedlars of false prophecies  And Shephatiah Dh I would say  As Balaam preach'd and publish'd he did pay  The old false prophet in his chariot flew  And every lie he catch'd he dress'd it new  Curs'd as he went and as his curses flow'd  Held up his hands and turn'd his eyes to God  His sanctimonious phiz and sly grimace  Pass'd among partizans for signs of grace  So reverend like he vamped all his lies  That grossest falsehoods pass'd for prophecies  Thus courtiers prais'd him and the venal tribes  Who judge a cause by int'rest truth by bribes  Who rights divine or human will not see  Unless unlock'd by int'rest's golden key  Harden'd in sin and vainly puff'd with praise  He shew'd some marks which were not signs of grace  For which th' Almighty gave him in his ire  Nor son nor daughter to succeed their sire  Jer xxix    While things turn'd worse and worse and ev'ry day  Brought still new tidings of some fresh dismay  The king alarm'd and rous'd through fear at last  Turn'd first devote and then proclaim'd a fast  He call'd the priests and prophets to prepare  A scheme of fasting and a form of prayer  To try if heav'n would grant him power to kill  All those that were not subject to his will  Court priests and prophets when that sov'reign's cry  Run at their call and at their nod draw nigh  For royal mandates have a powerful zest  And like a mighty loadstone draw a priest  Even bishops feel their sympathetic force  And all who have their feelings in their purse  From Jearim to Beersheba all obey'd  Even judges fasted and attornies pray'd  One would have thought all Judah were sincere  For nought was heard but mighty peals of prayer  Like Ahab's priests they would not be said nay  Though God refus'd to hear yet still they pray  Than Hananiah none shew'd more zeal  In fervent fasting for the commonweal  With labour'd suits he pray'd and while he cry'd  The very God of battles he defy'd  Of Jewish valour vauntingly he spoke  And with a symbol brake the Chaldean yoke  Jer xxviii    Made all the tribes believe their foes would run  Like bats and owls before th' approaching sun  He prov'd still more that on that fatal day  When Nergal  Nergal a Chaldean officer  conquer'd that he ran away  Him fools believ'd and liv'd in hope to see  The Jews victorious and the Chaldeans flee  So strong their faith they boast how ev'ry Jew  Had conquer'd squadrons told they legions slew  At their approach their foes still run away  And yet the conquering tribes still lost the day  When heav'n's ang'ry frowns their hopes beguil'd  Then Hananiah swore Jehovah smil'd  Told how their foes were blasted since that day  The guilty Jews began to fast and pray  Yet ev'ry post brought tidings worse and worse  Oft' times the foot were slain sometimes the horse  All this was prov'd a victory complete  And those who vanquished were aye defeat  Such power has fasting in the hands of kings  It changes nature and the cause of things  Even sins are sanctified when princes pray  And light turns darkness darkness shines like day  All this a venal priesthood will declare  And consecrate plain murder lawful war  Even so it was in Ahab's pious reign  Baal's prophets pray'd till Naboth he was slain  Whate'er the prince desir'd with one accord  The priests insur'd him always from the Lord  Four hundred prophets in a lusty ring  As they obsequiously stood round the king  With rosy gills in cringing accents bless  And swore that Ramoth Gilead sure was his  But shall I prosper the vain prince reply'd  They all said prosper but the prophets ly'd  With hieroglyphic horns vain symbols those  To shew how wicked men would push their foes  These lying prophets with a solemn farce  Made foolish Ahab think himself was Mars  But when the awful day of battle came  He found their words and deeds were not the same  'Tis vain to fast and pray while men remain  Resolv'd to hold and all their sins retain  They can't be humble who resolve to sin  Nor are they pure who lodge vile thoughts within  'Tis no hard matter for to fast till four  Then feast on turtle when the fast is o'er  Where envy rules or proud ambition reigns  Religion's self is fetter'd fast in chains  Howe'er abstemious envious mortals are  With God and man they wage eternal war  Whole chapels crowded full of envious men  Are but an image of that dreary den  Envy's dark cave which erst the virgin found  In a dark vale and deep below the ground  Where Envy seated in her dark abode  Defil'd with ropy gore and clots of blood  Shut from the wind and from the wholesome skies  In a deep vale the dreary dungeon lies  Dismal and cold where not a ray of light  Invades the winter or disturbs the night  A pois'nous morsel in her teeth she chew'd  And gorg'd the flesh of vipers for her food  Minerva loathing turn'd away her eye  The hideous monster rising heavily  Came stalking forward with a sullen pace  And left her mangled offals on the place  Soon as she saw the goddess gay and bright  She fetch'd a groan at such a chearful sight  Livid and meagre were her looks her eye  In foul distorted glances turn'd awry  A hord of gall her inward parts possess'd  And spread a greenness o'er her cancer'd breast  Her teeth were brown with rust and from her tongue  In dangling drops the stringy poison hung  She never smiles but when the wretched weep  Nor lulls her malice with a moment's sleep  Restless in spite while watchful to destroy  She pines and sickens at another's joy  Foe to herself distressing and distress'd  She bears her own tormentor in her breast  She takes her staff hung round with wreaths of thorn  And sails along in howling tempests born  O'er fields and flowery meadows where she steers  Her baneful course a mighty blast appears  Mildews and blights the meadows are defac'd  The fields and flow'rs and the whole year laid waste  On mortals next and peopled towns she falls  And breathes a burning plague among their walls  Though men may fast and with much fervour pray  Malice and envy soon will guilt betray  He who commits a crime will quickly find  The pressing guilt lie heavy on his mind  Though bribes or favour should assert his cause  Pronounce him guiltless and elude the laws  None quits himself his own impartial thought  Will damn and conscience will record the fault  Each as his hands in guilt have been embru'd  By hellish horror ever is pursu'd  A virtuous heart and unstain'd innocence  Is man's best second guard and sure defence  But hear with patience a fam'd heathen's word  It may do good even to a fasting lord  Who fasts for power and when he fasts will pray  For might to make reluctant lands obey  And flimsy patriots if they will may hear  Some wholesome lessons for a patriot's ear  That man's a Sisyphus whom noise and strife  Seduce from all the soft retreats of life  To vex the government disturb the laws  Drunk with the fumes of popular applause  He courts the giddy crowd to make him great  And sweats and toils to mount the sov'reign seat  For still to aim at power and still to fail  Ever to strive and never to prevail  What is it but in reason's true account  To heave the stone against the rising mount  Which urg'd with labour and forc'd up with pain  Recoils and rolls impetuous down the plain  But mark him down a slave who humbly proud  With presents begs preferment from the crowd  That early suppliant who salutes the tribes  And sets the mob to scramble for his bribes  That some old dottard sitting in the sun  On holidays may tell what fates were done  But ye proud chiefs that thirst for sov'reign sway  Hear what an ancient Heathen bard doth say  'Some ask for envy'd pow'r which public hate  'Pursues and hurries headlong to their fate  'Down go their titles and their statues crown'd  'Are by base hands in the next river drown'd  'The guiltless horses and the chariot wheel  'The same effects of vulgar fury feel  'The smith prepares his hammer for the stroke  'While belching bellows hissing fire provoke  'Sejanus  Prime minister of Tiberius Caesar He had many triumphal chariots and statues erected to him but falling into disgrace they were all broken down and the Senate and people insulted over him as meanly as they had formerly flattered him  almost first of Roman names  'The great Sejanus crackles in the flames  'Form'd in the forge the pliant brass is laid  'On anvils and of head and limbs are made  'Pans cans and pisspots and such kitchen stuff  'Nor did their mean revenge think this enough  'They drag the image through the streets and loud  'Sound welcome to the gazing gath'ring crowd  "Adorn your doors with laurels and a bull  "Milk white and large lead to the capitol  "Sejanus with a rope is dragg'd along  "The sport and laughter of the giddy throng'  'Good Lord they cry what blackmoor lips he has  'How foul a smock and what a hanging face  'By Heav'n I never could endure his sight  'But say How came his monstrous crimes to light  'What is the charge and who the evidence  'There must be striking proofs of his offence  'Nothing at all of this but Caesar sent  'A threat'ning letter to the Parliament  'Nay Sirs if Caesar writ I ask no more  'He's guiltyand the question's out of door'  Now with Sejanus wouldst thou change thy fate  To be like him first minister of state  To have thy levees crowded with resort  Of a depending gaping servile court  Dispose all honours of the sword and gown  Raise with a nod and ruin with a frown  To hold thy prince in pupilage and sway  The monarch whom the conquer'd world obey  Yes I believe thou would'st be great as he  For every man's a fool to that degree  All wish the dire prerogative to kill  Even they would have the power that want the will  But would'st thou have thy wishes understood  To take the bad together with the good  Would'st thou not rather choose the small renown  To be the mayor of some poor paltry town  Bigly to look and barbarously to speak  To pound false weights and scanty measures break  Than be Sejanus so advanc'd in place  Then tumbled headlong to such mean disgrace  Great Hannibal within the balance lay  And tell how many pounds his ashes weigh  Him Afric was not able to contain  Whose length runs level with the Atlantic main  And weakens fruitful Nilus to convey  His sunbeat waters by so long a way  Spain first he won the Pyrenaeans past  And frozen Alps the mounds that nature cast  And with corroding juices as he went  A passage through the living rocks he rent  Though Italy was conquer'd and o'errun  Uneasy still he cry'd there's nothing done  Till level with the ground their gates are laid  And punic flags on Roman towers display'd  But what's his end O charming glory say  What rare fifth act to crown this huffing play  In one deciding battle overcome  He flies is banish'd from his native home  These heathen hints in an auspicious hour  May warning give to such as pray for power  To see the wancomplexion'd gambling crew  In church sit cloister'd fasting in a pew  Yawning and panting till the hour's are past  And longing more to break than keep their fast  To hear the long rob'd gentry squeaking say  Ah guilty  Miserere Domine  Is such a farce would almost spoil the grace  And pinch the skill of Aristophanes  To give their characters a striking hue  As they sit feign'dly fasting in the pew  By play men's tempers are unguarded made  And when the head's intent the heart's betray'd  Then base desires of gain then rage appears  Next blows and brawls arise and anxious fears  Then clamour and revellings reach the sky  While losing gamesters heaven and earth defy  Then horrid oaths are utter'd every cast  They grieve and curse and swear nay weep at last  And in a pet will even feign to fast  When lawyers fast and when that gamblers pray  Or when that bishops cast the tythes away  When haughty churchmen are not fond of power  Or when the strong do not the weak devour  Then shall dissemblers find it on record  That when they fast for strife they please the Lord  But why do  pious  nations in distress  Flee to the Lord and all their sins confess  Sins which they mean not ever to give o'er  While sin brings gain and vice increases power  Can such believe the great Almighty's blind  And does not see the errors of the mind  Or that hypocrisy and vile grimace  Is a fit off'ring to obtain his grace  While secret vice lies lurking in the mind  And guilty culprits to their faults are blind  Though they may bow and cringe and fast a day  In God's pure eye they neither fast nor pray  A pamper'd prelate finely deck'd in lawn  To fast and pray by six fine horses drawn  In a gilt coach and to confess the crimes  Of lords and scavengers in these bad times  Is so polite a mark of penitence  That drunken peers can scarcely take offence  But why not join in praise as well as fast  And thank the Lord for many favours past  For smiling springs dress'd in a verdant green  And gladsome summers which our eyes have seen  With richest autumns in effulgence gay  All nodding with a  cornu copiae  For twenty seasons past and some few more  The last was better than the year before  And now the present still excels the past  Yet peevish Britons will not praise but fast  Like children who for some conceiv'd affront  Will fast in spite if bid them eat they wont  Take penance on themselves 'cause Heav'n won't give  What their own pride unjustly would receive  Who are not grateful for all favours past  But mock Jehovah when they feign to fast  FINIS
