 ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM  VOLUME III  EDINBURGH Printed for A MILLAR London AND A KINCAID J BELL Edinburgh MDCCLXII  ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM  CHAP XIX COMPARISONS  COMPARISONS as observed above  Chap  serve two different purposes When addressed to the understanding their purpose is to instruct when to the heart their purpose is to give pleasure With respect to the latter a comparison may be employ'd to produce various pleasures by different means First by suggesting some unusual  resemblance or contrast second by setting an object in the strongest light third by associating an object with others that are agreeable fourth by elevating an object and fifth by depressing it And that comparisons may produce various pleasures by these different means appears from what is said in the chapter above cited and will be made still more evident by examples which shall be given after premising some general observations  An object of one sense cannot be compared to an object of another for such objects are totally separated from each other and have no circumstance in common to admit either resemblance or contrast Objects of hearing may be compared as also of taste and of touch But the chief fund of comparison are objects of sight because in writing or speaking things can only be compared in idea and the ideas of visible objects are by far more lively than those of any other sense  It has no good effect to compare things by way of simile that are of the same kind nor to contrast things of different kinds  The reason is given in the chapter cited above and the reason shall be illustrated by examples The first is a resemblance instituted betwixt two objects so nearly related as to make little or no impression  This just rebuke inflam'd the Lycian crew  They join they thicken and th' assault renew  Unmov'd th'embody'd Greeks their fury dare  And fix'd support the weight of all the war  Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian pow'rs  Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian tow'rs  As on the confines of adjoining grounds  Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds  They tugg they sweat but neither gain nor yield  One foot one inch of the contended field  Thus obstinate to death they fight they fall  Nor these can keep nor those can win the wall  Iliad xii  Another from Milton labours under the same defect Speaking of the fallen angels searching for mines of gold  A numerous brigade hasten'd as when bands  Of pioneers with spade and pickax arm'd  Forerun the royal camp to trench a field  Or cast a rampart  The next shall be of things contrasted that are of different kinds  Queen  What is my Richard both in shape and mind  Transform'd and weak Hath Bolingbroke depos'd  Thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart  The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw  And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage  To be o'erpower'd and wilt thou pupillike  Take thy correction mildly kiss the rod  And fawn on rage with base humility  Richard II act sc  This comparison has scarce any force A man and a lion are of different species and there is no such resemblance betwixt them in general as to produce any strong effect by contrasting particular attributes or circumstances  A third general observation is That abstract terms can never be the subject of comparison otherwise than by being personified  Shakespear compares adversity to a toad and slander to the bite of a crocodile but in such comparisons these abstract terms must be imagined sensible beings  I now proceed to illustrate by particular instances the different means by which comparison can afford pleasure and in the order above established I shall begin with those instances that are agreeable by suggesting some unusual resemblance or contrast  Sweet are the uses of Adversity  Which like the toad ugly and venomous  Wears yet a precious jewel in her head  As you like it act sc  Gardiner  Bolingbroke hath seiz'd the wasteful King  What pity is't that he had not so trimm'd  And dress'd his land as we this garden dress  And wound the bark the skin of our fruittrees  Lest being over proud with sap and blood  With too much riches it confound itself  Had he done so to great and growing men  They might have liv'd to bear and he to taste  Their fruits of duty All superfluous branches  We lop away that bearing boughs may live  Had he done so himself had borne the crown  Which waste and idle hours have quite thrown down  Richard II act sc  See how the Morning opes her golden gates  And takes her farewell of the glorious sun  How well resembles it the prime of youth  Trim'd like a yonker prancing to his love  Second Part Henry VI act sc  Brutus  O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb  That carries anger as the flint bears fire  Who much inforced shows a hasty spark  And straight is cold again  Julius Caesar act sc  Thus they their doubtful consulations dark  Ended rejoicing in their matchless chief  As when from mountaintops the dusky clouds  Ascending while the Northwind sleeps o'erspread  Heav'n's chearful face the lowring element  Scowls o'er the darken'd landscape snow and shower  If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet  Extend his ev'ningbeam the fields revive  The birds their notes renew and bleating herds  Attest their joy that hill and valley rings  Paradise Lost book  The last exertion of courage compared to the blaze of a lamp before extinguishing  Tasso Gierusalem canto    st    As the bright stars and milky way  Shew'd by the night are hid by day  So we in that accomplish'd mind  Help'd by the night new graces find  Which by the splendor of her view  Dazzled before we never knew  Waller  None of the foregoing similes as it appears to me have the effect to add any lustre to the principal subject and therefore the pleasure they afford must arise from suggesting resemblances that are not obvious I mean the chief pleasure for undoubtedly a beautiful subject introduced to form the simile affords a separate pleasure which is felt in the similes mentioned particularly in that cited from Milton  The next effect of a comparison in the  order mentioned is to place an object in a strong point of view which I think is done sensibly in the following similes  As when two scales are charg'd with doubtful loads  From side to side the trembling balance nods  While some laborious matron just and poor  With nice exactness weighs her woolly store  Till pois'd aloft the resting beam suspends  Each equal weight nor this nor that descends  So stood the war till Hector's matchless might  With fates prevailing turn'd the scale of fight  Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies  And fires his host with loud repeated cries  Iliad b xii  Ut flos in septis secretis nascitur hortis  Ignotus pecori nullo contusus aratro  Quem mulcent aurae firmat sol educat imber  Multi illum pueri multae cupiere puellae  Idem cum tenui carptus defloruit ungui  Nulli illum pueri nullae cupiere puellae  Sic virgo dum intacta manet dum cara suis sed  Cum castum amisit polluto corpore florem  Nec pueris jucunda maner nec cara puellis  Catullus  The imitation of this beautiful simile by  Ariosto canto    st  falls short of the original It is also in part imitated by Pope  Dunciad b l    Lucetta  I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire  But qualify the fires extreme rage  Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason  Julia  The more thou damm'st it up the more it burns  The current that with gentle murmur glides  Thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage  But when his fair course is not hindered  He makes sweet music with th' enamel'd stones  Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge  He overtaketh in his pilgrimage  And so by many winding nooks he strays  With willing sport to the wild ocean  Then let me go and hindernot my course  I'll be as patient as a gentle stream  And make a pastime of each weary step  Till the last step have brought me to my love  And there I'll rest as after much turmoil  A blessed soul doth in Elysium  Two Gentlemen of Verona act    sc    She never told her love  But let concealment like a worm i' th' bud  Feed on her damask cheek she pin'd in thought  And with a green and yellow melancholy  She sat like Patience on a monument  Smiling at Grief  TwelfthNight act sc  York  Then as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke  Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed  Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know  With slow but stately pace kept on his course  While all tongues cry'd God save thee Bolingbroke  Duchess  Alas poor Richard where rides he the while  York  As in a theatre the eyes of men  After a wellgrac'd actor leaves the stage  Are idly bent on him that enters next  Thinking his prattle to be tedious  Even so or with much more contempt mens eyes  Did scowl on Richard no man cry'd God save him  No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home  But dust was thrown upon his sacred head  Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off  His face still combating with tears and smiles  The badges of his grief and patience  That had not God for some strong purpose steel'd  The hearts of men they must perforce have melted  And barbarism itself have pitied him  Richard II act sc  Northumberland  How doth my son and brother  Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek  Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand  Even such a man so faint so spiritless  So dull so dead in look so wobegone  Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night  And would have told him half his Troy was burn'd  But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue  And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it  Second Part Henry IV act sc  Why then I do but dream on sov'reignty  Like one that stands upon a promontory  And spies a faroff shore where he would tread  Wishing his foot were equal with his eye  And chides the sea that sunders him from thence  Saying he'll lave it dry to have his way  So do I wish the crown being so far off  And so I chide the means that keep me from it  And so I say I'll cut the causes off  Flatt'ring my mind with things impossible  Third Part Henry VI act sc  Out out brief candle  Life's but a walking shadow a poor player  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage  And then is heard no more  Macbeth act sc  O thou Goddess  Thou divine Nature how thyself thou blazon'st  In these two princely boys they are as gentle  As zephyrs blowing below the violet  Not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough  Their royal blood inchaf'd as the rud'st wind  That by the top doth take the mountainpine  And make him stoop to th' vale  Cymbeline act sc  The sight obtained of the city of Jerusalem by the Christian army compared to that of land discovered after a long voyage Tasso's  Gierusalem canto    st  The fury of Rinaldo subsiding when not opposed to that of wind or water when it has a free passage  canto    st    As words convey but a faint and obscure notion of great numbers a poet to give a high notion of the object he describes with regard to number does well to compare it to what is familiar and commonly known Thus Homer  Book l  compares the Grecian army in point of number to a swarm of bees In another passage  Book l  he compares it to that profusion of leaves and flowers which appear in the spring or of insects in a summer's evening And Milton  As when the potent rod  Of Amram's son in Egypt's evil day  Wav'd round the coast up call'd a pitchy cloud  Of locusts warping on the eastern wind  That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung  Like night and darken'd all the land of Nile  So numberless were those bad angels seen  Hovering on wing under the cope of hell  'Twixt upper nether and surrounding fires  Paradise Lost book  Such comparisons have by some writers  See Vidae Poetic lib l  been condemned for the lowness of  the images introduced but surely without reason for with regard to numbers they put the principal subject in a strong light  The foregoing comparisons operate by resemblance others have the same effect by contrast  York  I am the last of Noble Edward's sons  Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first  In war was never lion rag'd more fierce  In peace was never gentle lamb more mild  Than was that young and princely gentleman  His face thou hast for even so look'd he  Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours  But when he frown'd it was against the French  And not against his friends His noble hand  Did win what he did spend and spent not that  Which his triumphant father's hand had won  His hands were guilty of no kindred's blood  But bloody with the enemies of his kin  Oh Richard York is too far gone with grief  Or else he never would compare between  Richard II act sc  Milton has a peculiar talent in embellishing the principal subject by associating it with others that are agreeable which is  the third end of a comparison Similes of this kind have beside a separate effect they diversify the narration by new images that are not strictly necessary to the comparison they are short episodes which without distracting us from the principal subject afford great delight by their beauty and variety  He scarce had ceas'd when the superior fiend  Was moving toward the shore his pond'rous shield  Ethereal temper massy large and round  Behind him cast the broad circumference  Hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb  Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views  At ev'ning from the top of Fesole  Or in Valdarno to descry new lands  Rivers or mountains in her spotty globe  Milton b  Thus far these beyond  Compare of mortal prowess yet observ'd  Their dread commander He above the rest  In shape and gesture proudly eminent  Stood like a tow'r his form had yet not lost  All her original brightness nor appear'd  Less than archangel ruin'd and th' excess  Of glory obscur'd as when the sun newrisen  Looks through the horizontal misty air  Shorn of his beams or from behind the moon  In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds  On half the nations and with fear of change  Perplexes monarchs  Milton b  As when a vulture on Imaus bred  Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds  Dislodging from a region scarce of prey  To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids  On hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs  Of Ganges or Hydaspes Indian streams  But in his way lights on the barren plains  Of Sericana where Chineses drive  With sails and wind their cany waggons light  So on this windy sea of land the fiend  Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey  Milton b  Yet higher than their tops  The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung  Which to our general sire gave prospect large  Into this nether empire neighbouring round  And higher than that wall a circling row  Of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit  Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue  Appear'd with gay enamel'd colours mix'd  On which the sun more glad impress'd his beams  Than in fair evening cloud or humid bow  When God hath show'r'd the earth so lovely seem'd  That landscape and of pure now purer air  Meets his approach and to the heart inspires  Vernal delight and joy able to drive  All sadness but despair now gentle gales  Fanning their odoriferous wings dispense  Native perfumes and whisper whence they stole  Those balmy spoils As when to them who sail  Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past  Mozambic off at sea Northeast winds blow  Sabean odour from the spicy shore  Of Arabie the Blest with such delay  Well pleas'd they slack their course and many a league  Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles  Milton b  With regard to similes of this kind it will readily occur to the reader that when the resembling subject or circumstance is once properly introduced in a simile the mind passes easily to the new objects and is transitorily amused with them without feeling any disgust at the slight interruption Thus in fine weather the momentary excursions of  a traveller for agreeable prospects or sumptuous buildings chear his mind relieve him from the langour of uniformity and without much lengthening his journey in reality shorten it greatly in appearance  Next of comparisons that aggrandize or elevate These make stronger impressions than any other sort the reason of which may be gathered from the chapter of grandeur and sublimity and without reasoning will be evident from the following instances  As when a flame the winding valley fills  And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills  Then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies  Fires the high woods and blazes to the skies  This way and that the spreading torrent roars  So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores  Arou  d him wide immense destruction pours  And earth is delug'd with the  anguine show'rs  Iliad xx  Through blood through death Achilles still proceeds  O'er slaughter'd heroes and o'er rolling steeds  As when avenging flames with fury driv'n  On guilty towns exert the wrath of Heav'n  The pale inhabitants some fall some fly  And the red vapours purple all the sky  So rag'd Achilles Death and dire dismay  And toils and terrors fill'd the dreadful day  Iliad xxi  Methinks King Richard and myself should meet  With no less terror than the elements  Of fire and water when their thund'ring shock  At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven  Richard II act sc  I beg peculiar attention to the following simile for a reason that shall be mentioned  Thus breathing death in terrible array  The closecompacted legions urg'd their way  Fierce they drove on impatient to destroy  Troy charg'd the first and Hector first of Troy  As from some mountain's craggy forehead torn  A rock's round fragment flies with fury born  Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends  Precipitate the pond'rous mass descends  From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds  At every shock the crackling wood resounds  Still gath'ring force it smoaks and urg'd amain  Whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain  There stopsSo Hector Their whole force he prov'd  Resistless when he rag'd and when he stopt unmov'd  Iliad xiii  The image of a falling rock is certainly not elevating  See chap  Yet undoubtedly the foregoing image fires and swells the mind It is grand therefore if not sublime And that there is a real though delicate distinction betwixt these two feelings will be illustrated from the following simile  So saying a noble stroke he lifted high  Which hung not but so swift with tempest fell  On the proud crest of Satan that no sight  Nor motion of swift thought less could his shield  Such ruin intercept Ten paces huge  He back recoil'd the tenth on bended knee  His massy spear upstaid as if on earth  Winds under ground or waters forcing way  Sidelong had push'd a mountain from his seat  Half sunk with all pines  Milton b  A comparison by contrast may contribute to grandeur or elevation not less than by resemblance of which the following comparison of Lucan is a remarkable instance  Victrix causa diis placuit sed victa Catoni  Considering that the Heathen deities possessed a rank but one degree above that of mankind I think it scarce possible by a single expression to elevate or dignify more one of the human species than is done by this comparison I am sensible at the same time that such a comparison among Christians who entertain juster notions of the Deity would justly be reckoned extravagant and absurd  The last article mentioned is that of lessening or depressing a hated or disagreeable object which is effectually done by resembling it to any thing that is low or despicable Thus Milton in his description of the rout of the rebelangels happily expresses their terror and dismay in the following simile  As a herd  Of goats or timorous flock together throng'd  Drove them before him thunderstruck pursu'd  With terrors and with furies to the bounds  And crystal wall of heav'n which op'ning wide  Rowl'd inward and a spacious gap disclos'd  Into the wasteful deep the monstrous sight  Strook them with horror backward but far worse  Urg'd them behind headlong themselves they threw  Down from the verge of heav'n  Milton b  In the same view Homer I think may be defended in comparing the shouts of the Trojans in battle to the noise of cranes  Beginning of book  and to the bleating of a flock of sheep  Book l  and it is no objection that these are low images for by opposing the noisy march of the Trojans to the silent and manly march of the Greeks he certainly intended to lessen the former Addison  Guardian No  imagining the figure that men make in the sight of a superior being takes opportunity to mortify  their pride by comparing them to a swarm of pismires  A comparison that has none of the good effects mentioned in this discourse but is built upon common and trifling circumstances makes a mighty silly figure  "Non sum nescius grandia consilia a multis plerumque causis ceu magna navigia a plurimis remis impelli  Strada de bello Belgico  "  By this time I imagine the different purposes of comparison and the various impressions it makes on the mind are sufficiently illustrated by proper examples This was an easy work It is more difficult to lay down rules about the propriety or impropriety of comparisons in what circumstances they may be introduced and in what circumstances they are out of place It is evident that a comparison is not proper upon every occasion a man in his cool and sedate moments is not disposed to poetical flights nor to sacrifice truth and reality to the delusive operations of the imagination far less is he so disposed when oppressed with cares or interested in some important transaction  that occupies him totally The region of comparison and of all figurative expression lies betwixt these two extremes It is observable that a man when elevated or animated by any passion is disposed to elevate or animate all his objects he avoids familiar names exalts objects by circumlocution and metaphor and gives even life and voluntary action to inanimate beings In this warmth of mind the highest poetical flights are indulged and the boldest similes and metaphors relished  It is accordingly observed by Longinus in his treatise of the Sublime that the proper time for metaphor is when the passions are so swelled as to hurry on like a torrent  But without soaring so high the mind is frequently in a tone to relish chaste and moderate ornament such as comparisons that set the principal object in a strong point of view or that embellish and diversify the narration In general when by any animating passion whether pleasant or painful an impulse is given to the imagination we are in that condition wonderfully disposed to every sort of figurative expression and in particular to comparisons  This in a great measure is evident from the comparisons already mentioned and shall be further illustrated by other examples Love for example in its infancy rousing the imagination prompts the heart to display itself in figurative language and in similes  Troilus  Tell me Apollo for thy Daphne's love  What Cressid is what Pandar and what we  Her bed is India there she lies a pearl  Between our Ilium and where she resides  Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood  Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar  Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark  Troilus and Cressida act sc  Again  Come gentle Night come loving blackbrow'd Night  Give me my Romeo and when he shall die  Take him and cut him out in little stars  And he will make the face of heav'n so fine  That all the world shall be in love with Night  And pay no worship to the garish sun  Romeo and Juliet act sc  The dread of a misfortune however imminent involving always some doubt and uncertainty agitates the mind and excites the imagination  Wolsey  Nay then farewell  I've touch'd the highest point of all my greatness  And from that full meridian of my glory  I haste now to my setting I shall fall  Like a bright exhalation in the evening  And no man see me more  Henry VIII act sc  But it will be a better illustration of the present head to give examples where comparisons are improperly introduced I have had already occasion to observe that similes are not the language of a man in his ordinary state of mind going about the common affairs of life For that reason the following speech of a gardiner to his servants is extremely improper  Go bind thou up you dangling apricocks  Which like unruly children make their sire  Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight  Give some supportance to the bending twigs  Go thou and like an executioner  Cut off the heads of toofastgrowing sprays  That look too lofty in our commonwealth  All must be even in our government  Richara II act sc  The fertility of Shakespear's vein betrays him frequently into this error There is the same impropriety in another simile of his  Hero  Good Margaret run thee into the parlour  There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice  Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula  Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse  Is all of her say that thou overheard'st us  And bid her steal into the pleached bower  Where honeysuckles ripen'd by the sun  Forbid the sun to enter like to favourites  Made proud by princes that advance their pride  Against that power that bred it  Much ado about nothing act sc  Rooted grief deep anguish terror remorse despair and all the severe dispiriting passions are declared enemies perhaps not to figurative language in general but undoubtedly to the pomp and solemnity of comparison  Upon this account the simile pronounced by young Rutland under terror of death from an inveterate enemy and praying mercy is unnatural  So looks the pentup lion o'er the wretch  That trembles under his devouring paws  And so he walks insulting o'er his prey  And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder  Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword  And not with such a cruel threat'ninglook  Third part Henry VI act sc  Nothing appears more out of place or more aukwardly introduced than the following simile  Lucia  Farewell my Portius  Farewell though death is in the word  forever  Portius  Stay Lucia stay what dost thou say  forever  Lucia  Have I not sworn If Portius thy success  Must throw thy brother on his fate farewell  Oh how shall I repeat the word  forever  Portius  Thus o'er the dying lamp th' unsteady flame  Hangs quivering on a point leaps off by fits  And falls again as loath to quit its hold  Thou must not go my soul still hovers o'er thee  And can't get loose  Cato act sc  Nor doth the simile which closes the first act of the same tragedy make its appearance with a much better grace the situation there represented being too dispiriting for a simile A simile is improper for one who dreads the discovery of a secret machination  Zara  The mute not yet return'd Ha 'twas the King  The King that parted hence frowning he went  His eyes like meteors roll'd then darted down  Their red and angry beams as if his sight  Would like the raging Dogstar scorch the earth  And kindle ruin in its course  Mourning Bride act sc  A man spent and dispirited after losing a battle is not disposed to heighten or illustrate his discourse by similes  York  With this we charg'd again but out alas  We bodg'd again as I have seen a swan  With bootless labour swim against the tide  And spend her strength with overmatching waves  Ah hark the fatal followers do pursue  And I am faint and cannot fly their fury  The sands are number'd that make up my life  Here must I stay and here my life must end  Third part Henry VI act sc  Far less is a man disposed to similes who is not only defeated in a pitch'd battle but lies at the point of death mortally wounded  Warwick  My mangled body shews  My blood my want of strength my sick heart shews  That I must yield my body to the earth  And by my fall the conquest to my foe  Thus yields the cedar to the ax's edge  Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle  Under whose shade the ramping lion slept  Whose topbranch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree  And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind  Third part Henry VI act sc  Queen Katharine deserted by the King and in the deepest affliction upon her divorce could not be disposed to any sallies of imagination and for that reason the following  simile however beautiful in the mouth of a spectator is scarce proper in her own  I am the most unhappy woman living  Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity  No friends no hope no kindred weep for me  Almost no grave allowed me like the lily  That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd  I'll hang my head and perish  King Henry VIII act sc  Similes thus unseasonably introduced are finely ridiculed in the  Rehearsal  Bayes  Now here she must make a simile  Smith  Where's the necessity of that Mr Bayes  Bayes  Because she's surpris'd that's a general rule you must ever make a simile when you are surprised 'tis a new way of writing  A comparison is not always faultless even where it is properly introduced I have endeavoured above to give a general view of the different ends to which a comparison may contribute A comparison like other human productions may fall short of its end and of this defect instances are not  rare even among good writers To complete the present subject it will be necessary to make some observations upon such faulty comparisons I begin with observing that nothing can be more erroneous than to institute a comparison too faint a distant resemblance or contrast fatigues the mind with its obscurity instead of amusing it and tends not to fulfil any one end of a comparison The following similes seem to labour under this defect  Albus ut obscuro deterget nubila coelo  Saepe Notus neque parturit imbres  Perpetuos sic tu sapiens finire memento  Tristitiam vitaeque labores  Molli Plance mero  Horace Carm l ode  Medio dux agmine Turnus  Vertitur arma tenens et toto vertice supra est  Ceu septem surgens sedatis amnibus altus  Per tacitum Ganges aut pingui flumine Nilus  Cum refluit campis et jam se condidit alveo  Aeneid ix  Talibus orabat talesque miserrima fletus  Fertque refertque soror sed nullus ille movetur  Fletibus aut voces ullas tractabilis audit  Fata obstant placidasque viri Deus obstruit aures  Ac veluti annoso validam cum robore quercum  Alpini Boreae nunc hinc nunc flatibus illinc  Eruere inter se certant it stridor et alte  Consternunt terram concusso stipite frondes  Ipsa haeret scopulis et quantum vertice ad auras  Aethereas tantum radice in tartara tendit  Haud secus assiduis hinc atque hinc vocibus heros  Tunditur et magno persentit pectore curas  Mens immota manet lacrymae volvuntur inanes  Aeneid iv  K Rich  Give me the crownHere cousin seize the crown  Here on this side my hand on that side thine  Now is this golden crown like a deep well  That owes two buckets filling one another  The emptier ever dancing in the air  The other down unseen and full of water  That bucket down and full of tears am I  Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high  Richard II act sc  King John  Oh Cousin thou art come to set mine eye  The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burnt  And all the shrowds wherewith my life should sail  Are turned to one thread one little hair  My heart hath one poor string to stay it by  Which holds but till thy news be uttered  King John act sc  York  My uncles both are slain in rescuing me  And all my followers to the eager foe  Turn back and fly like ships before the wind  Or lambs pursu'd by hungerstarved wolves  Third Part Henry VI act sc  The latter of the two similes is good The former because of the faintness of the resemblance produces no good effect and crowds the narration with an useless image  The next error I shall mention is a capital one In an epic poem or in any elevated subject a writer ought to avoid raising a simile upon a low image which never fails to bring down the principal subject In general it is a rule that a grand object ought never to be resembled to one that is diminutive however delicate the resemblance may be It is the peculiar character  of a grand object to fix the attention and swell the mind in this state it is disagreeable to contract the mind to a minute object however elegant The resembling an object to one that is greater has on the contrary a good effect by raising or swelling the mind One passes with satisfaction from a small to a great object but cannot be drawn down without reluctance from great to small Hence the following similes are faulty  Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroculus' care  Invade the Trojans and commence the war  As wasps provok'd by children in their play  Pour from their mansions by the broad highway  In swarms the guiltless traveller engage  Whet all their stings and call forth all their rage  All rise in arms and with a general cry  Assert their waxen domes and buzzing progeny  Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms  So loud their clamours and so keen their arms  Iliad xvi  So burns the vengeful hornet soul all o'er  Repuls'd in vain and thirsty still of gore  Bold son of air and heat on angry wings  Untam'd untir'd he turns attacks and stings  Fir'd with like ardour fierce Atrides flew  And sent his soul with ev'ry lance he threw  Iliad xvii  Instant ardentes Tyrii pars ducere muros  Molirique arcem er manibus subvolvere saxa  Pars aptare locum tecto et concludere sulco  Jura magistratusque legunt sanctumque senatum  Hic portus alii effodiunt hic alta theatris  Fundamenta locant alii immanesque columnas  Rupibus excidunt scenis decora alta futuris  Qualis apes aestate nova per florea rura  Exercet sub sole labor cum gentis adultos  Educunt foetus aut cum liquentia mella  Stipant  et dulci distendunt nectare cellas  Aut onera accipiunt venientum aut agmine facto  Ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent  Fervet opus redolentque thymo fragrantia mella  Aeneid i  To describe bees gathering honey as resembling the builders of Carthage would have a much better effect  Tum vero Teucri incumbunt et littore celsas  Deducunt toto naves natat uncta carina  Frondentesque ferunt remos et robora sylvis  Infabricata fugae studio  Migrantes cernas totaque ex urbe ruentes  Ac veluti ingentem formicae farris acervum  Cum populant hyemis memores tectoque reponunt  It nigrum campis agmen praedamque per herbas  Convectant calle angusto pars grandia trudunt  Obnixae frumenta humeris pars agmina cogunt  Castigantque moras opere omnis semita fervet  Aeneid iv  The following simile has not any one beauty to recommend it The subject is Amata the wife of King Latinus  Tum vero infelix ingentibus excita monstris  Immensam sine more furit lymphata per urbem  Ceu quondam torto volitans sub verbere turbo  Quem pueri magno in gyro vacua atria circum  Intenti ludo exercent Ille actus habena  Curvatis fertur spatiis stupet inscia turba  Impubesque manus mirata volubile buxum  Dant animos plagae Non cursu segnior illo  Per medias urbes agitur populosque feroces  Aeneid vii  This simile seems to border upon the burlesque  An error opposite to the former is the introducing a resembling image so elevated  or great as to bear no proportion to the principal subject The remarkable disparity betwixt them being the most striking circumstance seizes the mind and never fails to depress the principal subject by contrast instead of raising it by resemblance and if the disparity be exceeding great the simile takes on an air of burlesque nothing being more ridiculous than to force an object out of its proper rank in nature by equalling it with one greatly superior or greatly inferior This will be evident from the following comparisons  Fervet opus redolentque thymo fragrantia mella  Ac veluti lentis Cyclopes fulmina massis  Cum properant alii taurinis follibus auras  Accipiunt redduntque alii stridentia tingunt  Aera

 Loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring  So roar'd the lock when it releas'd the spring  Odyssey xxi  Such a simile upon the simplest of all actions that of opening a lock is pure burlesque  A writer of delicacy will avoid drawing his comparisons from any image that is nauseous ugly or remarkably disagreeable for however strong the resemblance may be more will be lost than gained by such comparison Therefore I cannot help condemning though with some reluctance the following simile or rather metaphor  O thou fond many with what loud applause  Did'st thou beat heav'n with blessing Bolingbroke  Before he was what thou wou'dst have him be  And now being trimm'd up in thine own desires  Thou beastly feeder art so full of him  That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up  And so thou common dog didst thou disgorge  Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard  And now thou wou'dst eat thy dead vomit up  And howl'st to find it  Second Part Henry IV act sc  The strongest objection that can lie against a comparison is that it consists in words only not in sense Such false coin or bastard wit does extremely well in burlesque but is far below the dignity of the epic or of any serious composition  The noble sister of Poplicola  The moon of Rome chaste as the isicle  That's curdled by the frost from purest snow  And hangs on Dian's temple  Coriolanus act sc  There is evidently no resemblance betwixt an isicle and a woman chaste or unchaste But chastity is cold in a metaphorical sense and an isicle is cold in a proper sense and this verbal resemblance in the hurry and glow of composing has been thought a sufficient foundation for the simile Such phantom similes are mere witticisms which ought to have no quarter except where purposely introduced to provoke laughter Lucian in his dissertation upon history talking of a certain author makes the following comparison which is verbal merely  This author's descriptions are so cold that they surpass the Caspian snow and all the ice of the north  Virgil has not escaped this puerility  Galathaea thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae  Bucol vii  Ego Sardois videar tibi amarior herbis  Ibid  Gallo cujus amor tantum mihi crescit in horas

the word  drown  for there is no real resemblance betwixt being drown'd at sea and dying of grief at land But perhaps this sort of tinsel wit may have a propriety in it when used to express an affected not a real passion which was the Queen's case  Pope has several similes of the same stamp I shall transcribe one or two from the  Essay on Man  the gravest and most instructive of all his

sincerity as to fact is doubtful we strike out truth by the confrontation of different accounts as we strike out sparks of fire by the collision of flints and steel  Let us vary the phrase a very little and there will not remain a shadow of resemblance Thus for example  We discover truth by the confrontation of different  accounts as we strike out sparks of fire by the collision of flints and steel  Racine makes Pyrrhus say to Andromaque  Vaincu chargé de fers de regrets consumé  Brulé de plus de feux que je n'en allumai  Helas fusje jamais si cruel que vous l'etés  And Orestes in the same

qu'un mouton  Helas helas  Elle est cent fois mille fois plus cruelle  Que n'est le tigre aux bois  Again  Helas l'amour m'a pris  Comme le chat fait la souris  A vulgar Irish ballad begins thus  I have as much love in store  As there's apples in Portmore  Where the subject is burlesque or ludicrous such similes are far from being improper Horace says pleasantly  Quanquam tu levior cortice  L ode  And Shakespear  In breaking oaths he's stronger than Hercules  And this leads me to observe that beside the foregoing comparisons which are all serious there is a species the end and purpose of which is to excite gaiety or mirth Take the following examples  Falstaff speaking to his page  I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one  Second Part Henry IV

as fame goes  Had corns upon his feet and toes  Was not by half so tender hooft  Nor trod upon the ground so soft  And as that beast would kneel and stoop  Some write to take his rider up  So Hudibras

to serve them as some do lords learn  their  titles  and then brag of their acquaintance  Tale of a Tub  Box'd in a chair the beau impatient sits  While spouts run clatt'ring o'er the roof by fits

and grammarians Tropes and figures have indeed been multiplied with so little reserve as to make it no easy matter to distinguish them from plain language A discovery almost accidental made me think of giving them a place in this work I found that the most important of them depend on principles formerly explained and I was glad of an opportunity to show the extensive influence of these principles Confining myself therefore to figures that answer this purpose I am luckily freed from much trash without dropping so far as I remember any figure that merits a proper  name And I begin with Prosopopoeia or personification which is justy intitled to the first place  SECT I PERSONIFICATION  THis figure which gives life to things inanimate is so bold a delusion as to require one should imagine very peculiar circumstances for operating the effect And yet in the language of poetry we find variety of expressions which though commonly reduced to this figure are used without ceremony or any sort of preparation I give for example the following expressions  Thirsty  ground  hungry  churchyard  furious  dart  angry  ocean The epithets here in their proper meaning are attributes of sensible beings What is the effect of such epithets when apply'd to things inanimate Do they raise in the mind of the reader a perception of sensibility Do they  make him conceive the ground the churchyard the dart the ocean to be endued with animal functions This is a curious inquiry and whether so or not it cannot be declined in handling the present subject  One thing is certain that the mind is prone to bestow sensibility upon things inanimate where that violent effect is necessary to gratify passion This is one instance among many of the power of passion to adjust our opinions and belief to its gratification  Chap part  I give the following examples Antony mourning over the body of Caesar murdered in the senatehouse vents his passion in the following words  Antony  O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth  That I am meek and gentle with these butchers  Thou art the ruins of the noblest man  That ever lived in the tide of times  Julius Caesar act sc  Here Antony must have been impressed with some sort of notion that the body of  Caesar was listening to him without which the speech would be foolish and absurd Nor will it appear strange after what is said in the chapter above cited that passion should have such power over the mind of man Another example of the same kind is where the earth as a common mother is animated to give refuge against a father's unkindness  Almeria  O Earth behold I kneel upon thy bosom  And bend my flowing eyes to stream upon  Thy face imploring thee that thou wilt yield  Open thy bowels of compassion take  Into thy womb the last and most forlorn  Of all thy race Hear me thou common parent  I have no parent elseBe thou a mother  And step between me and the curse of him  Who waswho was but is no more a father  But brands my innocence with horrid crimes  And for the tender names of  child  and  daughter  Now calls me  murderer  and  parricide  Mourning Bride act sc  Plaintive passions are extremely solicitous for vent A soliloquy commonly answers  the purpose But when a passion swells high it is not satisfied with so slight a gratification it must have a person to complain to and if none be found it will animate things devoid of sense Thus Philoctetes complains to the rocks and promontories of the isle of Lemnos  Philoctetes of Sophocles act sc  and Alcestes dying invokes the sun the light of day the clouds the earth her husband's palace  c  Alcestes of Euripides act sc  Plaintive passions carry the mind still farther Among the many principles that connect individuals in society one is remarkable it is that principle which makes us earnestly wish that others should enter into our concerns and think and feel as we do  See this principle accounted for chap  This social principle when inflamed by a plaintive passion will for want of a more complete gratification prompt the mind to give life even to things inanimate Moschus lamenting the death of Bion conceives that the birds the fountains the trees lament with him The shepherd  who in Virgil bewails the death of Daphnis expresseth himself thus  Daphni tuum Poenos etiam ingemuisse leones  Interitum montesque feri sylvaeque loquuntur  Eclogue v  Again  Illum etiam lauri illum etiam flevere myricae  Pinifer illum etiam sola sub rupe jacentem  Maenalus et gelidi fleverunt saxa Lycaei  Eclogue x  Again  Ho visto al pianto mio  Responder per pietate i sassi e l'onde  E sospirar le fronde  Ho visto al pianto mio  Ma non ho visto mai  Ne spero di vedere  Compassion ne la crudele e bella  Aminta di Tasso act sc  Earl Rivers carried to execution says  O Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison  Fatal and ominous to Noble peers  Within the guilty closure of thy walls  Richard the Second here was hack'd to death  And for more slander to thy dismal seat  We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink  Richard III act sc  King Richard having got intelligence of Bolingbroke's invasion says upon his landing in England from his Irish expedition in a mixture of joy and resentment  I weep for joy  To stand upon my kingdom once again  Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand  Though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs  As a long parted mother with her child  Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting  So weeping smiling greet I thee my earth  And do thee favour with my royal hands  Feed not thy sovereign's foe my gentle earth  Nor with thy sweets comfort his rav'nous sense  But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom  And heavygaited toads lie in their way  Doing annoyance to the treach'rous feet  Which with usurping steps do trample thee  Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies  And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower  Guard it I pr'ythee with a lurking adder  Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch  Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies  Mock not my senseless conjuration Lords  This earth shall have a feeling and these stones  Prove armed soldiers ere her native king  Shall faulter under foul rebellious arms  Richard II act sc  Among the ancients it was customary after a long voyage to salute the natal soil A long voyage was of old a greater enterprise than at present the safe return to one's country after much fatigue and danger was a circumstance extremely delightful and it was natural to give the natal soil a temporary life in order to sympathise with the traveller See an example  Agamemnon  of Aeschilus act in the beginning Regret for leaving a place one has been accustomed to has the same effect  Philoctetes of Sophocles at the close    Terror produceth the same effect A man to gratify this passion extends it to every thing around even to things inanimate Speaking of Polyphemus  Clamorem immensum tollit quo pontus et omnes  Intremuere undae penitusque exterrita tellus  Italiae  Aeneid iii  As when old Ocean roars  And heaves huge surges to the  trembling  shores  Iliad ii  And thund'ring footsteps  shake  the sounding shore  Iliad ii  Then with a voice that  shook  the vaulted skies  Iliad v  Racine in the tragedy of  Phedra  describing the seamonster that destroy'd Hippolitus conceives the sea itself to be inspired with terror as well as the spectators or more accurately transfers from the spectators their terror to the sea with which they were connected  Le flot qui l'apporta recule epouvanté  A man also naturally communicates his joy to all objects around animate or inanimate  As when to them who sail  Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past  Mozambic off at sea northeast winds blow  Sabean odour from the spicy shore  Of Araby the Blest with such delay  Well pleas'd they slack their course and many a league  Chear'd with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles  Paradise Lost b  I have been profuse of examples to show what power many passions have to animate their objects In all the foregoing examples the personification if I mistake not is so complete as to be derived from an actual conviction momentary indeed of life and intelligence But it is evident from numberless instances that personification is not always so complete Personification is a common figure in descriptive poetry understood to be the language of the writer and not of any of his personages in a fit of passion In this case it seldom or never comes up to a conviction even momentary of life and intelligence I give the following examples  First in  his  east the glorious lamp was seen  Regent of day and all th' horizon round  Invested with bright rays jocund to run  His  longitude through heav'n's high road the gray  Dawn and the Pleiades before  him  danc'd  Shedding sweet influence Less bright the moon  But opposite in levell'd west was set  His  mirror with full face borrowing  her  light  From  him  for other light  she  needed none  Paradise Lost b l  The chastity of the English language which in common usage distinguishes by genders no words but what signify beings male and female gives thus a fine opportunity for the prosopopoeia a beauty unknown in other languages where every word is masculine or feminine  Night's candles are burnt out and jocund day  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountaintops  Romeo and Juliet act sc  But look the morn in russet mantle clad  Walks o'er the dew of you high eastward hill  Hamlet act sc  It may I presume be taken for granted that in the foregoing instances the personification either with the poet or his reader amounts not to a conviction of intelligence nor that the sun the moon the  day the morn are here understood to be sensible beings What then is the nature of this personification Upon considering the matter attentively I discover that this species of personification must be referred to the imagination The inanimate object is imagined to be a sensible being but without any conviction even for a moment that it really is so Ideas or fictions of imagination have power to raise emotions in the mind  See appendix containing definitions and explanation of terms  and when any thing inanimate is in imagination supposed to be a sensible being it makes by that means a greater figure than when an idea is formed of it according to truth The elevation however in this case is far from being so great as when the personification arises to an actual conviction and therefore must be considered as of a lower or inferior sort Thus personification is of two kinds The first or nobler may be termed  passionate personification  the other or more humble  descriptive personification  because seldom or  never is personification in a description carried the length of conviction  The imagination is so lively and active that its images are raised with very little effort and this justifies the frequent use of descriptive personification This figure abounds in Milton's  Allegro  and  Penseroso  Abstract and general terms as well as particular objects are often necessary in poetry Such terms however are not well adapted to poetry because they suggest not any image to the mind I can readily form an image of Alexander or Achilles in wrath but I cannot form an image of wrath in the abstract or of wrath independent of a person Upon that account in works addressed to the imagination abstract terms are frequently personified But this personification never goes farther than the imagination  Sed mihi vel Tellus optem prius ima dehiscat  Vel pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras  Pallentes umbras Erebi noctemque profundam  Ante pudor quam te violo aut tua jura resolvo  Aeneid l  Thus to explain the effects of slander it is imagined to be a voluntary agent  No 'tis Slander  Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue  Outvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breath  Rides on the posting winds and doth belie  All corners of the world kings queens and states  Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave  This viperous Slander enters  Shakespear Cymbeline act sc  As also human passions Take the following example  For Pleasure and Revenge  Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice  Of any true decision  Troilus and Cressida act sc  Virgil explains fame and its effects by a still greater variety of action  Aeneid iv  And Shakespear personifies death and its operations in a manner extremely fanciful  Within the hollow crown  That rounds the mortal temples of a king  Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits  Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp  Allowing him a breath a little scene  To monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks  Infusing him with self and vain conceit  As if his flesh which walls about our life  Were brass impregnable and humour'd thus  Comes at the last and with a little pin  Bores through his castlewalls and farewell king  Richard II act sc  Not less successfully is life and action given even to sleep  K Henry  How many thousands of my poorest subjects  Are at this hour asleep O gentle Sleep  Nature's soft nurse how have I frighted thee  That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down  And steep my senses in forgetfulness  Why rather Sleep ly'st thou in smoky cribs  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee  And hush'd with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber  Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great  Under the canopies of costly state  And lull'd with sounds of sweetest melody  O thou dull god why ly'st thou with the vile  In loathsome beds and leav'st the kingly couch  A watchcase to a common larumbell  Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast  Seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains  In cradle of the rude imperious surge  And in the visitation of the winds  Who take the ruffian billows by the top  Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them  With deaf'ning clamours in the slipp'ry shrouds  That with the hurly Death itself awakes  Can'st thou O partial Sleep give thy repose  To the wet seaboy in an hour so rude  And in the calmest and the stillest night  With all appliances and means to boot  Deny it to a king Then happy low lie down  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown  Second Part Henry IV act sc  I shall add one example more to show that descriptive personification may be used with propriety even where the purpose of the discourse is instruction merely  Oh let the steps of youth be cautious  How they advance into a dangerous world  Our duty only can conduct us safe  Our passions are seducers but of all  The strongest Love he first approaches us  In childish play wantoning in our walks  If heedlessly we wander after him  As he will pick out all the dancing way  We're lost and hardly to return again  We should take warning he is painted blind  To show us if we fondly follow him  The precipices we may fall into  Therefore let Virtue take him by the hand  Directed so he leads to certain joy  Southern  Hitherto our progress has been upon firm ground Whether we shall be so lucky in the remaining part of the journey seems doubtful For after acquiring some knowledge of the subject when we now look back to the expressions mentioned in the beginning  thirsty  ground  furious  dart and such like it seems as difficult as at first to say what sort of personification it is Such expressions evidently raise not the slightest conviction of sensibility Nor do I think they amount to descriptive personification in the expressions mentioned we do not so much as figure the ground or the  dart to be animated and if so they cannot at all come under the present subject And to show this more clearly I shall endeavour to explain what effect such expressions have naturally upon the mind In the expression  angry ocean  for example do we not tacitly compare the ocean in a storm to a man in wrath It is by this tacit comparison that the expression acquires a force or elevation beyond what is found when an epithet is used proper to the object for I have had occasion to show  Chap  that a thing inanimate acquires a certain elevation by being compared to a sensible being And this very comparison is itself a demonstration that there is no personification in such expressions For by the very nature of a comparison the things compared are kept distinct and the native appearance of each is preserved It will be shown afterward that expressions of this kind belong to another figure which I term  a figure of speech  and which employs the seventh section of the present chapter  Though thus in general we can precisely distinguish descriptive personification from what is merely a figure of speech it is however often difficult to say with respect to some expressions whether they are of the one kind or of the other Take the following instances  The moon shines bright in such a night as this  When the sweet wind did gently  kiss  the trees  And they did make no noise in such a night  Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan wall  And sigh'd his soul towards the Grecian tents  Where Cressid lay that night  Merchant of Venice act sc  I have seen  Th'  ambitious  ocean swell and rage and foam  To be exalted with the threat'ning clouds  Julius Caesar act sc  Jane Shore  My form alas has long forgot to please  The scene of beauty and delight is chang'd  No roses bloom upon my fading cheek  No laughing graces wanton in my eyes  But haggard Grief leanlooking sallow Care  And pining Discontent a rueful train  Dwell on my brow all hideous and forlorn  Jane Shore act sc  With respect to these and numberless other instances of the same kind whether they be examples of personification or of a figure of speech merely seems to be an arbitrary question They will be ranged under the former class by those only who are endued with a sprightly imagination Nor will the judgement even of the same person be steady it will vary with the present state of the spirits lively or composed  Having thus at large explained the present figure its different kinds and the principles from whence derived what comes next in order is to ascertain its proper province by showing in what cases it is suitable in what unsuitable I begin with observing upon passionate personification that this figure is not promoted by every passion indifferently All dispiriting passions are averse to it Remorse in particular is too serious and severe to be gratified by  a phantom of the mind I cannot therefore approve the following speech of Enobarbus who had deserted his master Antony  Be witness to me O thou blessed moon  When men revolted shall upon record  Bear hateful memory poor Enobarbus did  Before thy face repent  Oh sovereign mistress of true melancholy  The poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me  That life a very rebel to my will  May hang no longer on me  Antony and Cleopatra act sc  If this can be justified it must be upon the Heathen system of theology which converted into deities the sun moon and stars  Secondly After a passionate personification is properly introduced it ought to be confined strictly to its proper province that of gratifying the passion and no sentiment nor action ought to be exerted by the animated object but what answers that purpose Personification is at any rate a bold figure and ought to be employed with great reserve The passion of love for example  in a plaintive tone may give a momentary life to woods and rocks that the lover may vent his distress to them but no passion will support a conviction so far stretched as that these woods and rocks should be living witnesses to report the distress to others  Ch'i' t'ami piu de la mia vita  Se tu nol sai crudele  Chiedilo à queste selve  Che te'l diranno et te'l diran con esse  Le fere loro e i duri sterpi e i sassi  Di questi alpestri monti  Ch'i' ho si spesse volte  Inteneriti al suon de' miei Iamenti  Pastor fido act sc  No lover who is not crazed will utter such a sentiment it is plainly the operation of the writer indulging his imagination without regard to nature The same observation is applicable to the following passage  In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire  With good old folks and let them tell thee tales  Of woful ages long ago betid  And ere thou bid goodnight to quiet their grief  Tell them the lamentable fall of me  And send the hearers weeping to their beds  For why the senseless brands will sympathise  The heavy accent of thy moving tongue  And in compassion weep the fire out  Richard II act sc  One must read this passage very seriously to avoid laughing The following passage is quite extravagant the different parts of the human body are too intimately connected with self to be personified by the power of any passion and after converting such a part into a sensible being it is still worse to make it be conceived as rising in rebellion against self  Cleopatra  Haste bare my arm and rouze the serpent's fury  Coward flesh  Would'st thou conspire with Caesar to betray me  As thou wert none of mine I'll force thee to't  Dryden All for Love act  Next comes descriptive personification upon which I must observe in general that  it ought to be cautiously used A personage in a tragedy agitated by a strong passion deals in strong sentiments and the reader catching fire by sympathy relishes the boldest personifications But a writer even in the most lively description ought to take a lower flight and content himself with such easy personifications as agree with the tone of mind inspired by the description In plain narrative again the mind serious and sedate rejects personification altogether Strada in his history of the Belgic wars has the following passage which by a strained elevation above the tone of the subject deviates into burlesk  "Vix descenderat a praetoria navi Caesar cum foeda illico exorta in portu tempestas classem impetu disjecit praetoriam hausit quasi non vecturam amplius Caesarem Caesarisque fortunam  Dec l  "  Neither do I approve in Shakespear the speech of King John gravely exhorting the citizens of Angiers to a surrender though a tragic writer has much greater latitude than a historian  Take the following specimen of this speech  The cannons have their bowels full of wrath  And ready mounted are they to spit forth  Their ironindignation 'gainst your walls  Act sc  Secondly If extraordinary marks of respect put upon a person of the lowest rank be ridiculous not less so is the personification of a mean object This rule chiefly regards descriptive personification for an object can hardly be mean that is the cause of a violent passion in that circumstance at least it must be an object of importance With respect to this point it would be in vain to set limits to personification taste is the only rule A poet of superior genius hath more than others the command of this figure because he hath more than others the power of inflaming the mind Homer appears not extravagant in animating his darts and arrows nor Thomson in animating the seasons the winds the rains the dews He even ventures to animate the diamond and doth it with propriety  That polish'd bright  And all its native lustre let abroad  Dares as it sparkles on the fairone's breast  With vain ambition emulate her eyes  But there are things familiar and base to which personification cannot descend In a composed state of mind to animate a lump of matter even in the most rapid flight of fancy degenerates into burlesk  How now What noise that spirit's possess'd with haste  That wounds th' unresisting postern with these strokes  Shakespear Measure for Measure act sc  The following little better  Or from the shore  The plovers when to scatter o'er the heath  And sing their wild notes to the list'ning waste  Thomson Spring l  Speaking of a man's hand cut off in battle  Te decisa suum Laride dextera quaerit  Semianimesque micant digiti ferrumque retractant  Aeneid x  The personification here of a hand is insufferable especially in a plain narration not to mention that such a trivial incident is too minutely described  The same observation is applicable to abstract terms which ought not to be animated unless they have some natural dignity Thomson in this article is quite licentious Witness the following instances out of many  O vale of bliss O softly swelling hills  On which  the power of cultivation  lies  And joys to see the wonders of his toil  Summer l  Then sated  Hunger  bids his brother  Thirst  Produce the mighty bowl  Nor wanting is the brown October drawn  Mature and perfect from  his  dark retreat  Of thirty years and now  his honest front  Flames in the light refulgent  Autumn l  Thirdly it is not sufficient to avoid improper subjects Some preparation is necessary in order to rouze the mind The imagination  refuses its aid till it be warmed at least if not inflamed Yet Thomson without the least ceremony or preparation introduceth each season as a sensible being  From brightening fields of aether fair disclos'd  Child of the sun refulgent Summer comes  In pride of youth and felt through Nature's depth  He comes attended by the sultry hours  And everfanning breezes on his way  While from his ardent look the turning Spring  Averts her blushful face and earth and skies  Allsmiling to his hot dominion leaves  Summer l  See  Winter  comes to rule the vary'd year  Sullen and sad with all his rising train  Vapours  and  clouds  and  storms  Winter l  This has violently the air of writing mechanically without taste It is not natural that the imagination of a writer should be so much heated at the very commencement and at any rate he cannot expect such ductility in his readers but if this practice can be justified by authority  Thomson has one of no mean note Vida begins his first eclogue in the following words  Dicite vos Musae et juvenum memorate querelas  Dicite nam motas ipsas ad carmina cautes  Et requiesse suos perhibent vaga flumina cursus  Even Shakespear is not always careful to prepare the mind for this bold figure Take the following instance  Upon these taxations  The clothiers all not able to maintain  The many to them 'longing have put off  The spinsters carders fullers weavers who  Unfit for other life compell'd by hunger  And lack of other means in desp'rate manner  Daring th' event to th' teeth are all in uproar  And  Danger  serves among them  Henry VIII act sc  Fourthly Descriptive personification ought never to be carried farther than barely to animate the subject and yet poets are not easily restrained from making this phantom of their own creating behave and act in every respect as if it were really a sensible  being By such licence we lose sight of the subject and the description is rendered obscure or unintelligible instead of being more lively and striking In this view the following passage describing Cleopatra on shipboard appears to me exceptionable  The barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne  Burnt on the water the poop was beaten gold  Purple the fails and so perfumed that  The winds were love sick with 'em  Antony and Cleopatra act sc  Let the winds be personified I make no objection But to make them lovesick is too far stretched having no resemblance to any natural action of wind In another passage where Cleopatra is also the subject the personification of the air is carried beyond all bounds  The city cast  Its people out upon her and Antony  Inthron'd i' th' marketplace did sit alone  Whistling to th' air which but for vacancy  Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too  And made a gap in nature  Antony and Cleopatra act sc  The following personification of the earth or soil is not less wild  She shall be dignify'd with this high honour  To bear my Lady's train lest the base earth  Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss  And of so great a favour growing proud  Disdain to root the summerswelling flower  And make rough winter everlastingly  The Two Gentlemen of Verona act sc  Shakespear far from approving such intemperance of imagination puts this speech in the mouth of a ranting lover Neither can I relish what follows  Omnia quae Phoebo quondam meditante beatus  Audiit Eurotas jussitque ediscere lauros  Ille canit  Virgil Buc vi  The chearfulness singly of a pastoral song will scarce support personification in the lowest degree But admitting that a river gently flowing may be imagined a sensible being listening to a song I cannot enter into the conceit of the river's ordering his laurels to learn the song Here all resemblance  to any thing real is quite lost This however is copied literally by one of our greatest poets early indeed before maturity of taste or judgement  Thames heard the numbers as he flow'd along  And bade his willows learn the moving song  Pope's Pastorals past l  This author in riper years is guilty of a much greater deviation from the rule Dullness may be imagined a deity or idol to be worshipped by bad writers but then some sort of disguise is requisite some bastard virtue must be bestowed to give this idol a plausible appearance Yet in the  Dunciad  dullness without the least disguise is made the object of worship The mind rejects such a fiction as unnatural for dullness is a defect of which even the dullest mortal is ashamed  Then he great tamer of all human art  c  Book i  The following instance is stretched beyond all resemblance It is bold to take a part  or member of a living creature and to bestow upon it life volition and action after animating two such members it is still bolder to make them envy each other for this is wide of any resemblance to reality  De nostri baci  Meritamente sia giudice quella  c  Pastor Fido act sc  Fifthly The enthusiasm of passion may have the effect to prolong passionate personification but descriptive personification cannot be dispatched in too few words A minute description dissolves the charm and makes the attempt to personify appear ridiculous Homer succeeds in animating his darts and arrows but such personification spun out in a French translation is mere burlesk  Et la fléche en furie avide de son sang  Part vole à lui l'atteint et lui perce le flanc  Horace says happily  "Post equitem sedet atra Cura"  See how this thought degenerates  by being divided like the former into a number of minute parts  Un fou rempli d'erreurs que le trouble accompagne  Et malade à la ville ainsi qu'à la campagne  En vain monte à cheval pour tromper son ennui  Le Chagrin monte en croupe et galope avec lui  The following passage is if possible still more faulty  Her fate is whisper'd by the gentle breeze  And told in sighs to all the trembling trees  The trembling trees in ev'ry plain and wood  Her fate remurmur to the silver flood  The silver flood so lately calm appears  Swell'd with new passion and o'erflows with tears  The winds and trees and floods her death deplore  Daphne our grief our glory now no more  Pope's Pastorals iv  Let grief or love have the power to animate the winds the trees the floods provided the figure be dispatched in a single expression Even in that case the figure seldom has a good effect because grief or love of the pastoral kind are causes rather too faint for so violent an effect as imagining the winds  trees or floods to be sensible beings But when this figure is deliberately spread out with great regularity and accuracy through many lines the reader instead of relishing it is struck with its ridiculous appearance  SECT II APOSTROPHE  THis figure and the former are derived from the same principle If to gratify a plaintive passion we can bestow a momentary sensibility upon an inanimate object it is not more difficult to bestow a momentary presence upon a sensible being who is absent  Hinc Drepani me portus et illaetabilis ora  Accipit Hic pelagi tot tempestatibus actus  Heu genitorem omnis curae casusque levamen  Amitto Anchisen  hic me pater optime fessum  Deseris  heu tantis nequicquam erepte periclis  Nec vates Helenus cum multa horrenda monerer  Hos mihi praedixit luctus non dira Celaeno  Aeneid iii  This figure is sometimes joined with the former things inanimate to qualify them for listening to a passionate expostulation are not only personified but also conceived to be present  Et si fata Deûm si mens non laeva fuisset  Impulerat ferro Argolicas foedare latebras  Trojaque nunc stares Priamique arx alta maneres  Aeneid ii  Helena  Poor Lord is't I  That chase thee from thy country and expose  Those tender limbs of thine to the event  Of nonsparing war And is it I  That drive thee from the sportive court where thou  Wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark  Of smoky muskets O you leaden messengers  That ride upon the violent speed of fire  Fly with false aim pierce the still moving air  That sings with piercing do not touch my Lord  All's well that ends well act sc  This figure like all others requires an agitation of mind In plain narrative as for example in giving the genealogy of a family it has no good effect  Fauno Picus pater isque parentem  Te Saturne refert tu sanguinis ultimus auctor  Aeneid vii  SECT III HYPERBOLE  IN this figure we have another effect of the foregoing principle An object uncommon with respect to size either very great of its kind or very little strikes us with surprise and this emotion like all others prone to gratification forces upon the mind a momentary conviction that the object is greater or less than it is in reality The same effect precisely attends figurative grandeur or littleness Every object that produceth surprise by its singularity is always seen in a false light while the emotion subsists circumstances are exaggerated beyond truth and it is not till after the emotion subsides that things appear as they are A writer taking advantage of this  natural delusion enriches his description greatly by the hyperbole And the reader even in his coolest moments relishes this figure being sensible that it is the operation of nature upon a warm fancy  It will be observed that a writer is generally more successful in magnifying by a hyperbole than in diminishing a minute object contracts the mind and fetters its power of conception but the mind dilated and inflamed with a grand object moulds objects for its gratification with great facility Longinus with respect to the diminishing power of a hyperbole cites the following ludicrous thought from a comic poet  "He was owner of a bit of ground not larger than a Lacedemonian letter  Chap of his treatise on the sublime  "  But for the reason now given the hyperbole has by far the greater force in magnifying objects of which take the following specimen  For all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed for ever And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a  man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered  Genesis xiii  Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret  Gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas  Aeneid vii  Atque imo barathri ter gurgite vastos  Sorbet in abruptum fluctus rursusque sub auras  Erigit alternos et sidera verberat undâ  Aeneid iii  Horrificis juxta tonat Aetna ruinis  Interdumque atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem  Turbine fumantem piceo et candente favilla  Attollitque globos flammarum et sidera lambit  Aeneid iii  Speaking of Polyphemus  Ipse arduus altaque pulsat Sidera  Aeneid iii  When he speaks  The air a charter'd libertine is still  Henry V act sc  Now shield with shield with helmet helmet clos'd  To armour armour lance to lance oppos'd  Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew  Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries  And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise  With streaming blood the slipp'ry fields are dy'd  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide  Iliad iv  The following may also pass though stretched pretty far  Econjungendo à temerario ardire  Estrema forza e infaticabil lena  Vien che si' impetuoso il ferro gire  Che ne trema la terra e'l ciel balena  Gierusalem cant st  Quintilian  L cap in fin  is fensible that this figure is natural  "For" says he "not contented with truth we naturally incline to augment or diminish beyond it and for that reason the hyperbole is familiar even among the vulgar and illiterate"  And he adds very justly  "That the hyperbole is then proper when the subject of itself  exceeds the common measure"  From these premisses one would not expect the following conclusion the only reason he can find for justifying this figure of speech  "Conceditur enim amplius dicere quia dici quantum est non potest meliusque ultra quam citra stat oratio"  We are indulged to say more than enough because we cannot say enough and it is better to be over than under In the name of wonder why this slight and childish reason when immediately before he had made it evident that the hyperbole is founded on human nature I could not resist this personal stroke of criticism intended not against our author for no human creature is exempt from error but against the blind veneration that is paid to the ancient classic writers without distinguishing their blemishes from their beauties  Having examined the nature of this figure and the principle on which it is erected I proceed as in the first section to some rules by which it ought to be governed And in the first place it is a capital fault to introduce an hyperbole in the description  of an ordinary object or event which creates no surprise In such a case the hyperbole is altogether unnatural being destitute of surprise the only foundation that can support it Take the following instance where the subject is extremely familiar  viz  swimming to gain the shore after a shipwreck  I saw him beat the surges under him  And ride upon their backs he trode the water  Whose enmity he flung aside and breasted  The surge most swoln that met him his bold head  'Bove the contentious waves he kept and oar'd  Himself with his good arms in lusty strokes  To th' shore that o'er his waveborn basis bow'd  As stooping to relieve him  Tempest act sc  In the next place it may be gathered from what is said that an hyperbole can never suit the tone of any dispiriting passion Sorrow in particular will never prompt such a figure and for that reason the following hyperboles must be condemned as unnatural  K Rich  Aumerle thou weep'st my tenderhearted cousin  We'll make foul weather with despised tears  Our sighs and they shall lodge the summercorn  And make a dearth in this revolting land  Richard II act sc  Draw them to Tyber's bank and weep your tears  Into the channel till the lowest stream  Do kiss the most exalted shores of all  Julius Caesar act sc  Thirdly a writer if he wish to succeed ought always to have the reader in his eye He ought in particular never to venture a bold thought or expression till the reader be warmed and prepared for it For this reason an hyperbole in the beginning of any work can never be in its place Example  Jam pauca aratro jugera regiae  Moles relinquent  Horat Carm lib ode  In the fourth place the nicest point of all is to ascertain the natural limits of an hyperbole beyond which being overstrained it  has a bad effect Longinus in the abovecited chapter with great propriety of thought enters a caveat against an hyperbole of this kind He compares it to a bowstring which relaxes by overstraining and produceth an effect directly opposite to what is intended I pretend not to ascertain any precise boundary the attempt would be difficult if not impracticable I must therefore be satisfied with an humbler task which is to give a specimen of what I reckon overstrained hyperboles and I shall be also extremely curt upon this subject because examples are to be found every where No fault is more common among writers of inferior rank and instances are found even among those of the finest taste witness the following hyperbole too bold even for an Hotspur Hotspur talking of Mortimer  In single opposition hand to hand  He did confound the best part of an hour  In changing hardiment with great Glendower  Three times they breath'd and three times did they drink  Upon agreement of swift Severn's flood  Who then affrighted with their bloody looks  Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds  And hid his crisp'd head in the hollow bank  Bloodstained with these valiant combatants  First Part Henry IV act sc  Speaking of Henry V  England ne'er had a King until his time  Virtue he had deserving to command  His brandish'd sword did blind men with its beams  His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings  His sparkling eyes replete with awful fire  More dazzled and drove back his enemies  Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces  What should I say his deeds exceed all speech  He never lifted up his hand but conquer'd  First Part Henry VI act sc  Lastly an hyperbole after it is introduced with all advantages ought to be comprehended within the fewest words possible As it cannot be relished but in the hurry and swelling of the mind a leisurely view dissolves the charm and discovers the description to be extravagant at least and perhaps also ridiculous This fault is palpable  in a sonnet which passeth for one of the most complete in the French language Phillis is made as far to outshine the sun as he outshines the stars  Le silence regnoit sur la terre et sur l'onde  L'air devenoit serain  c  Collection of French epigrams vol p  There is in Chaucer a thought expressed in a single line which sets a young beauty in a more advantageous light than the whole of this muchlaboured poem  Up rose the sun and up rose Emelie  SECT IV The means or instrument conceived to be the agent  IN viewing a group of things we have obviously a natural tendency to bestow all possible perfection upon that particular object which makes the greatest figure The emotion raised by the object is by  this means thoroughly gratified and if the emotion be lively it prompts us even to exceed nature in the conception we form of the object Take the following examples  For Neleus' sons Alcides'  rage  had slain  A broken rock the  force  of Pirus threw  In these instances the rage of Hercules and the force of Pirus being the capital circumstances are so far exalted as to be conceived the agents that produce the effects  In the following instance hunger being the chief circumstance in the description is itself imagined to be the patient  Whose hunger has not tasted food these three days  Jane Shore  As when the  force  Of subterranean wind transports a hill  Paradise Lost  As when the  potent rod  Of Amram's son in Egypt's evil day  Wav'd round the coast upcall'd a pitchy cloud  Of locusts  Paradise Lost  SECT V A figure which among related objects extends properties of one to another  THis figure is not dignified with a proper name because it has been overlooked by all writers It merits however place in this work and must be distinguished from those formerly handled as depending on a different principle  Giddy brink jovial wine daring wound  are examples of this figure Here are expressions that certainly import not the ordinary relation of an adjective to its substantive A  brink  for example cannot be termed  giddy  in a proper sense neither can it be termed  giddy  in any figurative sense that can import any of its qualities or attributes When we attend to the expression we discover that a  brink  is termed  giddy  from producing that effect in those who stand on it In the same manner a wound is said to be daring  not with respect to itself but with respect to the boldness of the person who inflicts it and wine is said to be jovial as inspiring mirth and jollity Thus the attributes of one subject are extended to another with which it is connected and such expression must be considered as a figure because it deviates from ordinary language  How are we to account for this figure for we see it lies in the thought and to what principle shall we refer it Have poets a privilege to alter the nature of things and at pleasure to bestow attributes upon subjects to which these attributes do not belong It is an evident truth which we have had often occasion to inculcate that the mind in idea passeth easily and sweetly along a train of connected objects and where the objects are intimately connected that it is disposed to carry along the good or bad properties of one to another especially where it is in any degree inflamed with these properties  See chap part sect  From this principle is derived the figure under consideration  Language invented for the communication of thought would be imperfect if it were not expressive even of the slighter propensities and more delicate feelings But language cannot remain so imperfect among a people who have received any polish because language is regulated by internal feeling and is gradually so improved as to express whatever passes in the mind Thus for example a sword in the hand of a coward is in poetical diction termed  a coward sword  the expression is significative of an internal operation for the mind in passing from the agent to its instrument is disposed to extend to the latter the properties of the former Governed by the same principle we say  listening  fear by extending the attribute  listening  of the man who listens to the passion with which he is moved In the expression  bold deed  or  audax facinus  we extend to the effect what properly belongs to the cause But not to waste time by making a commentary upon every expression of this kind the best way to give a complete view of the subject is to  exhibit a table of the different connections that may give occasion to this figure And in viewing this table it will be observed that the figure can never have any grace but where the connections are of the most intimate kind  An attribute of the cause expressed as an attribute of the effect  Audax facinus  Of yonder fleet a  bold  discovery make  An impious mortal gave the  daring  wound  To my  adventrous  song  That with no middle flight intends to soar  Paradise Lost  An attribute of the effect expressed as an attribute of the cause  Quos periisse ambos  misera  censebam in mari  Plautus  No wonder fallen such a  pernicious  height  Paradise Lost  An effect expressed as an attribute of the cause  Jovial wine Giddy brink Drowsy night Musing midnight Panting height Astonish'd thought Mournful gloom  Casting a dim  religious  light  Milton Comus  And the  merry  bells ring round  And the  jocund  rebecks sound  Milton Allegro  An atribute of a subject bestowed upon one of its parts or members  Longing arms  It was the nightingale and not the lark  That pierc'd the  fearful  hollow of thine ear  Romeo and Juliet act sc  Oh lay by  Those most ungentle looks and angry weapons  Unless you mean my griefs and killing fears  Should stretch me out at your  relentless  feet  Fair Penitent act  And ready now  To stoop with  wearied  wing and  willing  feet  On the bare outside of this world  Paradise Lost b  A quality of the agent given to the instrument with which it operates  Why peep your  coward  swords half out their shells  An attribute of the agent given to the subject upon which it operates  Highclimbing hill  Milton  A quality of one subject given to another  Icci  beatis  nunc Arabum invides  Gazis  Hora Carm l ode  When sapless age and weak unable limbs  Should bring thy father to his  drooping  chair  Shakespear  By art the pilot through the boiling deep  And howling tempest steers the  fearless  ship  Iliad xxiii  Then nothing loath th' enamour'd fair he led  And sunk transported on the  conscious  bed  Odyss viii  A  stupid  moment motionless she stood  Summer l  A circumstance connected with a subject expressed as a quality of the subject  Breezy summit  'Tis ours the chance of fighting fields to try  Iliad i  Oh had I dy'd before that wellfought wall  Odyss v  From this table it appears that the expressing an effect as an attribute of the cause is not so agreeable as the opposite expression The descent from cause to effect is natural and easy the opposite direction resembles retrograde motion  See chap    Panting height  for example  astonish'd thought  are strained and uncouth expressions which  a writer of taste will avoid For the same reason an epithet is unsuitable which at present is not applicable to the subject however applicable it may be afterward  Submersasque  obrue puppes  Aeneid i  And mighty  ruins  fall  Iliad v  Impious sons their  mangled  fathers wound  Another rule regards this figure That the property of one object ought not to be bestowed upon another with which it is incongruous  K Rich  How dare thy joints forget  To pay their  awful  duty to our presence  Richard II act sc  The connection betwixt an awful superior and his submissive dependent is so intimate that an attribute may readily be transferred from the one to the other But awfulness cannot be so transferred because it is inconsistent with submission  SECT VI Metaphor and Allegory  A Metaphor differs from a simile in form only not in substance In a simile the two different subjects are kept distinct in the expression as well as in the thought in a metaphor the two subjects are kept distinct in thought only not in expression A hero resembles a lion and upon that resemblance many similes have been made by Homer and other poets But instead of resembling a lion let us take the aid of the imagination and feign or figure the hero to be a lion By this variation the simile is converted into a metaphor which is carried on by describing all the qualities of a lion that resemble those of the hero The fundamental pleasure here that of resemblance belongs to thought as distinguished from expression There is an additional pleasure which arises from the expression  The poet by figuring his hero to be a lion goes on to describe the lion in appearance but in reality the hero and his description is peculiarly beautiful by expressing the virtues and qualities of the hero in new terms which properly speaking belong not to him but to a different being This will better be understood by examples A family connected with a common parent resembles a tree the trunk and branches of which are connected with a common root But let us suppose that a family is figured not barely to be like a tree but to be a tree and then the simile will be converted into a metaphor in the following manner  Edward's sev'n sons whereof thyself art one  Were sev'n fair branches springing from one root  Some of these branches by the dest'nies cut  But Thomas my dear Lord my life my Glo'ster  One flourishing branch of his most royal root  Is hack'd down and his summerleaves all faded  By Envy's hand and Murder's bloody axe  Richard II act sc  Figuring human life to be a voyage at sea  There is a tide in the affairs of men  Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune  Omitted all the voyage of their life  Is bound in shallows and in miseries  On such a full sea are we now afloat  And we must take the current when it serves  Or lose our ventures  Julius Caesar act sc  Figuring glory and honour to be a garland of fresh flowers  Hotspur  Would to heav'n  Thy name in arms were now as great as mine  Pr Henry  I'll make it greater ere I part from thee  And all the budding honours on thy crest  I'll crop to make a garland for my head  First Part Henry IV act sc  Figuring a man who hath acquired great reputation and honour to be a tree full of fruit  Oh boys this story  The world may read in me my body's mark'd  With Roman swords and my report was once  First with the best of note Cymbeline lov'd me  And when a soldier was the theme my name  Was not far off then was I as a tree  Whose boughs did bend with fruit But in one night  A storm or robbery call it what you will  Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves  And left me bare to weather  Cymbeline act sc  I am aware that the term  metaphor  has been used in a more extensive sense than I give it but I thought it of consequence in matters of some intricacy to separate things that differ from each other and to confine words within their most proper sense An allegory differs from a metaphor and what I would chuse to call  a figure of speech  differs from both I shall proceed to explain these differences A metaphor is defined above to be an operation of the imagination figuring one thing to be another An allegory requires no operation of the imagination nor is one thing figured to be another it consists in chusing a subject having properties or circumstances resembling those of  the principal subject and the former is described in such a manner as to represent the latter The subject thus represented is kept out of view we are left to discover it by reflection and we are pleased with the discovery because it is our own work Quintilian  L cap sect  gives the following instance of an allegory  O navis referent in mare te novi  Fluctus O quid agis fortiter occupa portum  Horat lib ode  and explains it elegantly in the following words  "Totusque ille Horatii locus quo navim pro republica fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus portum pro pace atque concordia dicit"  There cannot be a finer or more correct allegory than the following in which a vineyard is put for God's own people the Jews  Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it Thou didst cause it to take deep root and it filled the  land The hills were covered with its shadow and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars Why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all which pass do pluck her The boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast doth devour it Return we beseech thee O God of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the vineyard thy right hand hath planted and the branch thou madest strong for thyself  Psalm  In a word an allegory is in every respect similar to an hieroglyphical painting excepting only that words are used instead of colours Their effects are precisely the same A hieroglyphic raises two images in the mind one seen which represents one not seen An allegory does the same The representative subject is described and it is by resemblance that we are enabled to apply the description to the subject represented  In a figure of speech neither is there any fiction of the imagination employ'd nor a representative subject introduced A figure of speech as imply'd from  its name regards the expression only not the thought and it may be defined the employing a word in a sense different from what is proper to it Thus youth or the beginning of life is expressed figuratively by  morning of life  Morning is the beginning of the day and it is transferred sweetly and easily to signify the beginning of any other series life especially the progress of which is reckoned by days  Figures of speech are reserved for a separate section but a metaphor and allegory are so much connected that it is necessary to handle them together the rules for distinguishing the good from the bad are common to both We shall therefore proceed to these rules after adding some examples to illustrate the nature of an allegory Horace speaking of his love to Pyrrha which was now extinguished expresses himself thus  Me tabulâ sacer  Votivâ paries indicat uvida  Suspendisse potenti  Vestimenta maris Deo  Carm l ode  Again  Phoebus volentem praelia me loqui  Victas et urbes increpuit lyrâ  Ne parva Tyrrhenum per aequor  Vela darem  Carm l ode  Queen  Great Lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss  But chearly seek how to redress their harms  What though the mast be now blown overboard  The cable broke the holdinganchor lost  And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood  Yet lives our pilot still Is't meet that he  Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad  With tearful eyes add water to the sea  And give more strength to that which hath too much  While in his moan the ship splits on the rock  Which industry and courage might have sav'd  Ah what a shame ah what a fault were this  Third Part Henry VI act sc  Oroonoko  Ha thou hast rous'd  The lion in his den he stalks abroad  And the wide forest trembles at his roar  I find the danger now  Oroonoko act sc  The rules that govern metaphors and allegories are of two kinds those of the first kind concern the construction of a metaphor or allegory and ascertain what are perfect and what are faulty those of the other kind concern the propriety or impropriety of introduction in what circumstances these figures may be admitted and in what circumstances they are out of place I begin with rules of the first kind some of which coincide with those already given with respect to similes some are peculiar to metaphors and allegories  And in the first place it has been observed that a simile cannot be agreeable where the resemblance is either too strong or too faint This holds equally in a metaphor and allegory and the reason is the same in all In the following instances the resemblance is too faint to be agreeable  Malcolm  But there's no bottom none  In my voluptuousness your wives your daughters  Your matrons and your maids could not fill up  The cistern of my lust  Macbeth act sc  The best way to judge of this metaphor is to convert it into a simile which would be bad because there is scarce any resemblance betwixt lust and a cistern or betwixt enormous lust and a large cistern Again  He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause  Within the belt of rule  Macbeth act sc  There is no resemblance betwixt a distempered cause and any body that can be confined within a belt Again  Steep me in poverty to the very lips  Othello act sc  Poverty here must be conceived a fluid which it resembles not in any manner Speaking to Bolingbroke banish'd for six years  The sullen passage of thy weary steps  Esteem a foil wherein thou art to set  The precious jewel of thy homereturn  Richard II act sc  Again  Here is a letter lady  And every word in it a gaping wound  Issuing lifeblood  Merchant of Venice act sc  The following metaphor is strained beyond all endurance Timurbec known to us by the name of Tamarlane the Great writes to Bajazet Emperor of the Ottomans in the following terms  Where is the monarch who dares resist us where is the potentate who doth not glory in being numbered among our attendants As for thee descended from a Turcoman sailor since the vessel of thy unbounded ambition hath been wreck'd in the gulf of they selflove it would be proper that thou shouldst take in the sails of they temerity and cast the anchor of repentance in the port of sincerity and justice which is the port of safety lest the tempest of our vengeance make thee perish in the sea of the punishment thou deservest  Such strained figures it is observable are  not unfrequent in the first dawn of refinement The mind in a new enjoyment knows no bounds and is generally carried to excess till experience discover the just medium  Secondly whatever resemblance subjects may have it is wrong to put one for another if they bear no mutual proportion Where a very high and a very low subject are compared the simile takes on an air of burlesk and the same will be the effect where the one is imagined to be the other as in a metaphor or made to represent the other as in an allegory  Thirdly these figures a metaphor in particular ought not to be extended to a great length nor be crowded with many minute circumstances for in that case it is scarcely possible to avoid obscurity It is difficult during any course of time to support a lively image of one thing being another A metaphor drawn out to any length instead of illustrating or enlivening the principal subject becomes disagreeable by overstraining the mind Cowley is extremely  licentious in this way Take the following instance  Great and wise conqu'ror who wheree'er  Thou com'st dost fortify and settle there  Who canst defend as well as get  And never hadst one quarter beat up yet  Now thou art in thou ne'er will part  With one inch of my vanquish'd heart  For since thou took'st it by assault from me  'Tis garrison'd so strong with thoughts of thee  It fears no beauteous enemy  For the same reason however agreeable at first long allegories may be by their novelty they never afford any lasting pleasure witness the  Fairy Queen  which with great power of expression variety of images and melody of versification is scarce ever read a second time  In the fourth place the comparison carried on in a simile being in a metaphor sunk and the principal subject being imagined that very thing which it only resembles an opportunity is furnished to describe it in terms taken strictly or literally with respect to its imagined nature This suggests  another rule That in constructing a metaphor the writer ought to confine himself to the simplest expressions and make use of such words only as are applicable literally to the imagined nature of his subject Figurative words ought carefully to be avoided for such complicated images instead of setting the principal subject in a strong light involve it in a cloud and it is well if the reader without rejecting by the lump endeavour patiently to gather the plain meaning regardless of the figures  A stubborn and unconquerable flame  Creeps in his veins and drinks the streams of life  Lady Jane Gray act sc  Copied from Ovid  Sorbent avidae praecordia flammae  Metamorphoses lib ix  Let us analize this expression That a fever may be imagined a flame I admit though more than one step is necessary to come at the resemblance A fever by heating the body resembles fire and it is no stretch to imagine a fever to be a fire  Again by a figure of speech flame may be put for fire because they are commonly conjoined and therefore a fever may also be imagined a flame But now admitting a fever to be a flame its effects ought to be explained in words that agree literally to a flame This rule is not observed here for a flame  drinks  figuratively only not properly King Henry to his son Prince Henry  Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts  Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart  To stab at half an hour of my frail life  Second Part Henry IV act sc  Such faulty metaphors are pleasantly ridiculed in the  Rehearsal  Physician  Sir to conclude the place you fill has more than amply exacted the talents of a wary pilot and all these threatening storms which like impregnate clouds hover o'er our heads will when they once are grasp'd but by the eye of reason melt into fruitful showers of blessings on the people  Bayes  Pray mark that allegory Is not that good  Johnson  Yes that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable  Act sc  Fifthly The jumbling different metaphors in the same sentence or the beginning with one metaphor and ending with another is commonly called a mixt metaphor Quintilian bears testimony against it in the bitterest terms  "Nam id quoque in primis est custodiendum ut quo ex genere coeperis translationis hoc desinas Multi enim cum initium a tempestate sumpserunt incendio aut ruina finiunt quae est inconsequentia rerum foedissima"  L cap §  K Henry  Will you again unknit  This churlish knot of allabhorred war  And move in that obedient orb again  Where you did give a fair and natural light  First Part Henry IV act sc  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer  The stings and arrows of outrag'ous fortune  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles  And by opposing end them  Hamlet act sc  In the sixth place It is unpleasant to join different metaphors in the same period even where they are preserved distinct It is difficult to imagine the subject to be first one thing and then another in the same period without interval the mind is distracted by the rapid transition and when the imagination is put on such hard duty its images are too faint to produce any good effect  At regina gravi jamdudum saucia cura  Vulnus alit venis et caeco carpitur igni  Aeneid iv  Est mollis flamma medullas  Interea et tacitum vivit sub pectore vulnus  Aeneid iv  Motum ex Metello consule civicum  Bellique causas et vitia et modos  Ludumque fortunae gravesque  Principum amicitias et arma  Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus  Periculosae plenum opus aleae  Tractas et incedis per ignes  Subpositos cineri doloso  Horat Carm l ode  In the last place It is still worse to jumble together metaphorical and natural expression or to construct a period so as that it must be understood partly metaphorically partly literally The imagination cannot follow with sufficient ease changes so sudden and unprepared A metaphor begun and not carried on hath no beauty and instead of light there is nothing but obscurity and confusion Instances of such incorrect composition are without number I shall for a specimen select a few from different authors  Speaking of Britain  This precious stone set in the sea  Which serves it in the office of a wall  Or as a moat defensive to a house  Against the envy of less happier lands  Richard II act sc  In the first line Britain is figured to be a precious stone In the following lines Britain divested of her metaphorical dress is presented to the reader in her natural appearance  These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing  Will make him fly an ordinary pitch  Who else would soar above the view of men  And keep us all in servile fearfulness  Julius Caesar act sc  Rebus angustis animosus atque  Fortis adpare sapienter idem  Contrahes vento nimium secundo  Turgida vela  The following is a miserable jumble of expressions arising from an unsteady view of the subject betwixt its figurative and natural appearance  But now from gath'ring clouds destruction pours  Which ruins with mad rage our halcyon hours  Mists from black jealousies the tempest form  Whilst late divisions reinforce the storm  Dispensary canto  To thee the world its present homage pays  The harvest early but mature the praise  Pope's imitation of Horace b  Oui sa pudeur n'est que franche grimace  Qu'une ombre de vertu qui garde mal la place  Et qui s'evanouit comme l'on peut savoir  Aux rayons du soleil qu'une bourse fait voir  Molliere L'Etourdi act sc  Et son feu depourvû de sense et de lecture  S'éteint a chaque pas faute de nourriture  Boileau L'art poetique chant l  Dryden in his dedication to the translation of  Juvenal  says  When thus as I may say before the use of the loadstone or knowledge of the compass I was sailing in a vast ocean without other help than the polestar of the ancients and the rules of the French stage among the moderns  c  There is a time when factions by the vehemence of their own fermentation stun and disable one another  Bolingbroke  This fault of jumbling the figure and plain expression into one confused mass is not less common in allegory than in metaphor Take the following example  Heu quoties fidem  Mutatosque Deos flebit et aspera  Nigris aequora ventis  Emirabitur insolens  Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aureâ  Qui semper vacuam semper amabilem  Sperat nescius aurae Fallacis  Horat Carm l ode  Lord Halifax speaking of the ancient fabulists  "They says he wrote in signs and spoke in parables all their fables carry a double meaning the story is one and entire the characters the same throughout not broken or changed and always conformable to the nature of the creature they introduce They never tell you that the dog which snapp'd at a shadow lost his troop of horse that would be unintelligible This is his Dryden's new way of telling a story and confounding the moral and the fable together"  After instancing from the hind and panther he goes on thus  "What relation has the hind to our Saviour or what notion have we of a  panther's bible If you say he means the church how does the church feed on lawns or range in the forest Let it be always a church or always a clovenfooted beast for we cannot bear his shifting the scene every line"  A few words more upon allegory Nothing gives greater pleasure than this figure when the representative subject bears a strong analogy in all its circumstances to that which is represented But the choice is seldom so lucky the resemblance of the representative subject to the principal being generally so faint and obscure as to puzzle and not please An allegory is still more difficult in painting than in poetry The former can show no resemblance but what appears to the eye the latter hath many other resources for showing the resemblance With respect to what the Abbé du Bos  Reflexions sur la Poesie  c  vol sect  terms mixt allegorical compositions these may do in poetry because in writing the allegory can easily be distinguished from the historical part no person  mistakes Virgil's Fame for a real being But such a mixture in a picture is intolerable because in a picture the objects must appear all of the same kind wholly real or wholly emblematical The history of Mary de Medicis in the palace of Luxenbourg painted by Rubens is in a vicious taste by a perpetual jumble of real and allegorical personages which produce a discordance of parts and an obscurity upon the whole witness in particular the tablature representing the arrival of Mary de Medicis at Marseilles mixt with the real personages the Nereids and Tritons appear sounding their shells Such a mixture of fiction and reality in the same group is strangely absurd The picture of Alexander and Roxana described by Lucian is gay and fanciful but it suffers by the allegorical figures It is not in the wit of man to invent an allegorical representation deviating farther from any appearance of resemblance than one exhibited by Lewis XIV  anno  in which an overgrown chariot intended to represent that of the sun is  dragg'd along surrounded with men and women representing the four ages of the world the celestial signs the seasons the hours  c  a monstrous composition and yet scarce more absurd than Guido's tablature of Aurora  In an allegory as well as in a metaphor terms ought to be chosen that properly and literally are applicable to the representative subject Nor ought any circumstance to be added that is not proper to the representative subject however justly it may be applicable figuratively to the principal Upon this account the following allegory is faulty  Ferus et Cupido  Semper ardentes acuens sagittas  Cote  cruentâ  Horat l ode  For though blood may suggest the cruelty of love it is an improper or immaterial circumstance in the representative subject water not blood is proper for a whetstone  We proceed to the next head which is to examine in what circumstances these figures  are proper in what improper This inquiry is not altogether superseded by what is said upon the same subject in the chapter of comparisons because upon trial it will be found that a short metaphor or allegory may be proper where a simile drawn out to a greater length and in its nature more solemn would scarce be relished The difference however is not considerable and in most instances the same rules are applicable to both And in the first place a metaphor as well as a simile are excluded from common conversation and from the description of ordinary incidents  In the next place in any severe passion which totally occupies the mind metaphor is unnatural For that reason we must condemn the following speech of Macbeth  Methought I heard a voice cry Sleep no more  Macbeth doth murther sleep the innocent sleep  Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of Care  The birth of each day's life sore Labour's bath  Balm of hurt minds great Nature's second course  Chief nourisher in life's feast  Act sc  The next example of deep despair beside the highly figurative style hath more the air of raving than of sense  Calista  Is it the voice of thunder or my father  Madness Confusion let the storm come on  Let the tumultuous roar drive all upon me  Dash my devoted bark ye surges break it  'Tis for my ruin that the tempest rises  When I am lost sunk to the bottom low  Peace shall return and all be calm again  Fair Penitent act  The metaphor I next introduce is sweet and lively but it suits not the fiery temper of Chamont inflamed with passion Parables are not the language of wrath venting itself without restraint  Chamont  You took her up a little tender flower  Just sprouted on a bank which the next frost  Had nip'd and with a careful loving hand  Transplanted her into your own fair garden  Where the sun always shines there long she flourish'd  Grew sweet to sense and lovely to the eye  Till at the last a cruel spoiler came  Cropt this fair rose and rifled all its sweetness  Then cast it like a loathsome weed away  Orphan act  The following speech full of imagery is not natural in grief and dejection of mind  Gonsalez  O my son from the blind dotage  Of a father's fondness these ills arose  For thee I've been ambitious base and bloody  For thee I've plung'd into this sea of sin  Stemming the tide with only one weak hand  While t'other bore the crown to wreathe thy brow  Whose weight has sunk me ere I reach'd the shore  Mourning Bride act sc  The finest picture that ever was drawn of deep distress is in Macbeth  Act sc  where Macduff is represented lamenting his wife and children inhumanly murdered by the tyrant Struck with the news he questions the messenger over and over not that he doubted the fact but that his heart revolted against so cruel a misfortune After struggling some time with his grief he turns from his wife and children to their savage  butcher and then gives vent to his resentment but still with manliness and dignity  O I could play the woman with mine eyes  And braggart with my tongue But gentle Heav'n  Cut short all intermission front to front  Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself  Within my sword's length set himIf he 'scape  Then Heav'n forgive him too  This passage is a delicious picture of human nature One expression only seems doubtful In examining the messenger Macduff expresses himself thus  He hath no childrenall my pretty ones  Did you say all what all Oh hellkite all  What all my pretty little chickens and their dam  At one fell swoop  Metaphorical expression I am sensible may sometimes be used with grace where a regular simile would be intolerable but there are situations so overwhelming as not to admit even the slightest metaphor It requires great delicacy of taste to determine with firmness whether the present case be of that nature I incline to think it is and  yet I would not willingly alter a single word of this admirable scene  But metaphorical language is proper when a man struggles to bear with dignity or decency a misfortune however great The struggle agitates and animates the mind  Wolsey  Farewell a long farewell to all my greatness  This is the state of man to day he puts forth  The tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms  And bears his blushing honours thick upon him  The third day comes a frost a killing frost  And when he thinks good easy man full surely  His greatness is a ripening nips his root  And then he falls as I do  Henry VIII act sc  SECT VII Figure of Speech  IN the section immediately foregoing a figure of speech is defined  "The employing  a word in a sense different from what is proper to it"  and the new or uncommon sense of the word is termed  the figurative sense  The figurative sense must have a relation to that which is proper and the more intimate the relation is the figure is the more happy How ornamental this figure is to language will not be readily imagined by any one who hath not given peculiar attention I shall endeavour to display its capital beauties and advantages In the first place a word used figuratively together with its new sense suggests what it commonly bears and thus it has the effect to present two objects one signified by the figurative sense which may be termed  the principal object  and one signified by the proper sense which may be termed  accessory  The principal makes a part of the thought the accessory is merely ornamental In this respect a figure of speech is precisely similar to concordant sounds in music which without contributing to the melody make it harmonious I explain myself by examples  Youth  by a figure of speech is termed  the morning of life  This  expression signifies  youth  the principal object which enters into the thought but it suggests at the same time the proper sense of  morning  and this accessory object being in itself beautiful and connected by resemblance to the principal object is not a little ornamental I give another example of a different kind where an attribute is expressed figuratively  Imperious ocean  Together with the figurative meaning of the epithet  imperious  there is suggested its proper meaning  viz  the stern authority of a despotic prince Upon this figurative power of words Vida descants with great elegance  Nonne vides verbis ut veris saepe relictis  Accersant simulata aliundeque nomina porro  Transportent aptentque aliis ea rebus ut ip sae  Exuviasque novas res insolitosque colores  Indutae saepe externi mirentur amictus  Unde illi laetaeque aliena luce fruantur  Mutatoque habitu nec jam sua nomina mallent  Saepe ideo cum bella canunt incendia c  edas  Cernere diluviumque ingens surgentibus undis  Contrà etiam Martis pugnas imitabitur ignis  Cum furit accensis acies Vulcania campis  Nec turbato oritur quondam minor aequore pugna  Confligunt animosi Euri certamine vasto  Inter se pugnantque adversis molibus undae  Usque adeo passim sua res insignia laetae  Permutantque juvantque vicissim mutua sese  Altera in alterius transformat protinus ora  Tum specie capti gaudent spectare legentes  Nam diversa simul datur è re cernere eadem  Multarum simulacra animo subeuntia rerum  Poet lib l  In the next place this figure possesses a signal power of aggrandising an object by the following means Words which have no original beauty but what arises from their sound acquire an adventitious beauty from their meaning A word signifying any thing that is agreeable becomes by that means agreeable for the agreeableness of the object is communicated to its name  See chap part sect  This acquired beauty by the force of custom adheres to the word even when used figuratively and the beauty received from the thing it properly signifies is communicated to the thing which it is made to signify  figuratively Consider the foregoing expression  Imperious ocean  how much more elevated it is than  Stormy ocean  Thirdly this figure hath a happy effect in preventing the familiarity of proper names The familiarity of a proper name is communicated to the thing it signifies by means of their intimate connection and the thing is thereby brought down in our feeling  I have often regretted that a factious spirit of opposition to the reigning family made it necessary in public worship to distinguish the King by his proper name One will scarce imagine who has not made the trial how much better it sounds to pray for our Sovereign Lord the King without any addition  This bad effect is prevented by using a figurative word instead of one that is proper as for example when we express the sky by terming it  the blue vault of heaven  For though no work made with hands can compare with the sky in magnificence the expression however is good by preventing the object from being brought down by the familiarity of its proper name With respect to the degrading familiarity of proper names Vida has the following passage  Hinc si dura mihi passus dicendus Ulysses  Non illum vero memorabo nomine sed qui  Et mores hominum multorum vidit urbes  Naufragus eversae post saeva incendia Trojae  Poet lib l  Lastly by this figure language is enriched and rendered more copious In that respect were there no other a figure of speech is a happy invention This property is finely touched by Vida  Quinetiam agricolas ea fandi nota voluptas  Exercet dum laeta seges dum trudere gemmas  Incipiunt vites sitientiaque aetheris imbrem  Prata bibunt ridentque satis surgentibus agri  Hanc vulgo speciem propriae penuria vocis  Intulit indictisque urgens in rebus egestas  Quippe ubi se vera ostendebant nomina nusquam  Fas erat hinc atque hinc transferre simillima veris  Poet lib l  The beauties I have mentioned belong to every figure of speech Several other beauties peculiar to one or other sort I shall have occasion to remark afterward  Not only subjects but qualities actions effects may be expressed figuratively Thus  as to subjects  the gates of breath  for the lips  the watery kingdom  for the ocean As to qualities  fierce  for stormy in the expression  Fierce winter altus  for profundus  altus puteus altum mare Breathing  for perspiring  Breathing plants  Again as to actions the sea  rages  Time will  melt  her frozen thoughts Time  kills  grief An effect is put for the cause as  lux  for the sun and a cause for the effect as  boum labores  for corn The relation of resemblance is one plentiful source of figures of speech and nothing is more common than to apply to one object the name of another that resembles it in any respect Height size and wordly greatness though in themselves they have no resemblance produce emotions in the mind that have a resemblance and led by this resemblance we naturally express worldly greatness by height or size One feels a certain uneasiness in looking down to a great depth and hence depth is made to express any thing disagreeable by excess as  depth  of grief  depth  of despair Again height of place and time long past produce similar feelings and hence the expression  Ut altius repetam  Distance in past time producing a strong feeling is put for any strong feeling  Nihil mihi antiquius nostra amicitia  Shortness with relation to space for shortness with relation to time  Brevis esse laboro obscurus fio  Suffering a punishment resembles paying a debt hence  pendere poenas  Upon the same account light may be put for glory sunshine for prosperity and weight for importance  Many words originally figurative having by long and constant use lost their figurative power are degraded to the inferior rank of proper terms Thus the words that express the operations of the mind have in all languages been originally figurative The reason holds in all that when these operations came first under consideration there was no other way of describing them but by what they resembled It was not practicable to give them proper names as may be done to objects that can be ascertained by sight and touch A  soft  nature  jarring  tempers  weight  of wo  pompous  phrase  beget  compassion  assuage  grief  break  a vow  bend  the eye downward  shower  down curses  drown'd  in tears  wrapt  in joy  warm'd  with eloquence  loaden  with spoils and a thousand other expressions of the like nature have lost their figurative sense Some terms there are that cannot be said to be either purely figurative or altogether proper originally figurative they are tending to simplicity without having lost altogether their figurative power Virgil's  Regina saucia cura  is perhaps one of these expressions With ordinary readers  saucia  will be considered as expressing simply the effect of grief but one of a lively imagination will exalt the phrase into a figure  To epitomise this subject and at the same time to give a clear view of it I cannot think of a better method than to present to the reader a list of the several relations upon which figures of speech are commonly founded This list I divide into two tables one of subjects expressed figuratively and one of attributes  FIRST TABLE Subjects expressed figuratively  A word proper to one subject employed figuratively to express a resembling subject  There is no figure of speech so frequent as what is derived from the relation of resemblance Youth for example is signified figuratively by the  morning  of life The life of a man resembles a natural day in several particulars The morning is the beginning of day youth the beginning of life the morning is chearful so is youth  c  By another resemblance a bold warrior is termed the  thunderbolt  of war a multitude of troubles a  sea  of troubles  No other figure of speech possesses so many different beauties as that which is founded on resemblance Beside the beauties above mentioned common to all sorts it possesses in particular the beauty of a metaphor or of a simile A figure of speech  built upon resemblance suggests always a comparison betwixt the principal subject and the accessory and by this means every good effect of a metaphor or simile may in a short and lively manner be produced by this figure of speech  A word proper to the effect employ'd figuratively to express the cause  Lux  for the sun  Shadow  for cloud A helmet is signified by the expression  glittering terror  A tree by  shadow  or  umbrage  Hence the expression  Nec habet Pelion umbras  Ovid  Where the dun umbrage hangs  Spring l  A wound is made to signify an arrow  Vulnere non pedibus te consequar  Ovid  There is a peculiar force and beauty in this figure The word which signifies figuratively the principal subject denotes it to be a cause by suggesting the effect  A word proper to the cause employ'd figuratively to express the effect  Boumque labores  for corn  Sorrow  or  grief  for tears  Again Ulysses veil'd his pensive head  Again unmann'd a show'r of  sorrow  shed  Streaming  Grief  his faded cheek bedew'd  Blindness  for darkness  Caecis erramus in undis  Aeneid iii  There is a peculiar energy in this figure similar to that in the former The figurative name denotes the subject to be an effect by suggesting its cause  Two things being intimately connected the proper name of the one employ'd figuratively to signify the other  Day  for light  Night  for darkness Hence A sudden night  Winter  for a storm at sea  Interea magno misceri murmure pontum  Emissamque Hyemem sensit Neptunus  Aeneid i  This last figure would be too bold for a British writer as a storm at sea is not inseparably connected with winter in this climate  A word proper to an attribute employ'd figuratively to denote the subject  Youth  and  beauty  for those who are young and beautiful  Youth and beauty shall be laid in dust  Majesty  for the King  What art thou that usurp'st this time of night  Together with that fair and warlike form  In which the  Majesty  of buried Denmark  Did sometime march  Hamlet act sc  Or have ye chosen this place  After the toils of battle to repose  Your weary'd  virtue  Paradise Lost  Verdure  for a green field  Summer l  Speaking of cranes  To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring  And all the  war  descends upon the wing  Iliad iii  Cool  age  advances venerably wise  Iliad iii  The peculiar beauty of this figure arises from suggesting an attribute that embellishes the subject or puts it in a stronger light  A complex term employ'd figuratively to denote one of the component parts  Funus  for a dead body  Burial  for a grave  The name of one of the component parts instead of the complex term  Taeda  for a marriage The  East  for a country situated east from us  Jovis vestigia servat  for imitating Jupiter in general  A word signifying time or place employ'd  figuratively to denote a connected subject  Clime  for a nation or for a constitution of government Hence the expression  Merciful clime Fleecy winter  for snow  Seculum felix  A part for the whole  The  pole  for the earth The  head  for the person  Triginta minas pro capite tuo dedi  Plautus  Tergum  for the man  Fugiens tergum  Ovid  Vultus  for the man  Jam fulgor armorum fugaces  Terret equos equitumque vultus  Horat  Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus  Tam chari  capitis  Horat  Dumque virent  genua  Horat  Thy growing virtues justify'd my cares  And promis'd comfort to my  silver hairs  Iliad ix  Forthwith from the pool he rears  His mighty  stature  Paradise Lost  The silent  heart  which grief assails  Parnell  The peculiar beauty of this figure consists in marking out that part which makes the greatest figure  The name of the container employ'd figuratively to signify what is contained  Grove  for the birds in it Vocal  grove Ships  for the seamen Agonizing  ships Mountains  for the sheep pasturing upon them Bleating  mountains Zacynthus Ithaca c  for the inhabitants  Ex moestis domibus  Livy  The name of the sustainer employ'd figuratively to signify what is sustained  Altar  for the sacrifice  Field  for the battle fought upon it Wellfought  field  The name of the materials employ'd figuratively to signify the things made of them  Ferrum  for  gladius  The names of the Heathen deities employ'd figuratively to signify what they patronise  Jove  for the air  Mars  for war  Venus  for beauty  Cupid  for love  Ceres  for corn  Neptune  for the sea  Vulcan  for fire  This figure bestows great elevation upon the subject and therefore ought to be confined to the higher strains of poetry  SECOND TABLE Attributes expressed figuratively  When two attributes are connected  the name of the one may be employ'd figuratively to express the other  Purity and virginity are attributes of the same person Hence the expression  Virgin  snow for pure snow  A word signifying properly an attribute of one subject employ'd figuratively to express a resembling attribute of another subject  Tottering  state  Imperious  ocean  Angry  flood  Raging  tempest  Shallow  fears  My sure divinity shall bear the shield  And edge thy sword to  reap  the glorious field  Odyssey xx  Black omen  for an omen that portends bad fortune  Ater  odor  Virgil  The peculiar beauty of this figure arises from suggesting a comparison  A word proper to the subject employ'd to express one of its attributes  Mens  for  intellectus Mens  for a resolution  Istam oro exue mentem  When two subjects have a resemblance by a common quality the name of the one subject may be employ'd figuratively to denote that quality in the other  Summer  life for agreeable life  The name of the instrument made to signify the power of employing it  Melpomene cui liquidam pater  Vocem cum  cithara  dedit  The ample field of figurative expression display'd in these tables affords great scope for reasoning and reflection Several of the observations relating to metaphor are applicable to figures of speech These I  shall slightly retouch with some additions peculiarly adapted to the present subject  In the first place as the figure under consideration is built upon relation we find from experience and it must be obvious from reason that the beauty of the figure depends on the intimacy of the relation betwixt the figurative and proper sense of the word A slight resemblance in particular will never make this figure agreeable The expression for example  drink down a secret  for listening to a secret with attention is harsh and uncouth because there is scarce any resemblance betwixt  listening  and  drinking  The expression  weighty crack  used by Ben Johnson for  loud crack  is worse if possible a loud sound has not the slightest resemblance to a piece of matter that is weighty The following expression of Lucretius is not less faulty  "Et lepido quae sunt  fucata  sonore"  i  Sed magis  Pugnas et exactos tyrannos  Densum humeris  bibit  aure vulgus  Horat Carm l ode  Phemius let acts of gods and heroes old  What ancient bards in hall and bow'r have told  Attemper'd to the lyre your voice employ  Such the pleas'd  ear will drink  with silent joy  Odyssey i  Strepitumque exterritus  hausit  Aeneid vi  Write my Queen  And with mine eyes I'll  drink  the words you send  Cymbeline act sc  As thus th' effulgence tremulous I  drink  Summer l  Neque  audit  currus habenas  Georg i  O Prince Lycaon's valiant son reply'd  As thine the steeds be thine the task to guide  The horses practis'd to their lord's command  Shall  hear  the rein and answer to thy hand  Iliad v  The following figures of speech seem altogether wild and extravagant the figurative  and proper meaning having no connection whatever  Moving  softness freshness  breathes breathing  prospect  flowing  spring  dewy  light  lucid  coolness and many others of this false coin may be found in Thomson's  Seasons  Secondly the proper sense of the word ought to bear some proportion to the figurative sense and not soar much above it nor sink much below it This rule as well as the foregoing is finely illustrated by Vida  Haec adeo cum sint cum fas audere poetis  Multa modis multis tamen observare memento  Si quando haud propriis rem mavis dicere verbis  Translatisque aliunde notis longeque petitis  Ne nimiam ostendas quaerendo talia curam  Namque aliqui exercent vim duram et rebus iniqui  Nativam eripiunt formam indignantibus ipsis  Invitasque jubent alienos sumere vultus  Haud magis imprudens mihi erit et luminis expers  Qui puero ingentes habitus det ferre gigantis  Quam siquis stabula alta lares appellet equinos  Aut crines magnae genitricis gramina dicat  Poet l iii  Thirdly in a figure of speech every circumstance ought to be avoided that agrees with the proper sense only not the figurative sense for it is the latter that expresses the thought and the former serves for no other purpose but to make harmony  Zacynthus green with evershady groves  And Ithaca presumptuous boast their loves  Obtruding on my choice a second lord  They press the Hymenean rite abhorr'd  Odyssey xix  Zacynthus here standing figuratively for the inhabitants the description of the island is quite out of place It puzzles the reader by making him doubt whether the word ought to be taken in its proper or figurative sense  Write my Queen  And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send  Though ink be made of gall  Cymbeline act sc  The disgust one has to drink ink in reality  is nothing to the purpose where the subject is drinking ink figuratively  In the fourth place to draw consequences from a figure of speech as if the word were to be understood literally is a gross absurdity for it is confounding truth with fiction  Be Moubray's sins so heavy in his bosom  That they may break his foaming courser's back  And throw the rider headlong in the lists  A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford  Richard II act sc  Sin may be imagined heavy in a figurative sense but weight in a proper sense belongs to the accessory only and therefore to describe the effects of weight is to desert the principal subject and to convert the accessory into a principal  Cromwell  How does your Grace  Wolsey  Why well  Never so truly happy my good Cromwell  I know myself now and I feel within me  A peace above all earthly dignities  A still and quiet conscience The King has cur'd me  I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders  These ruin'd pillars out of pity taken  A load would sink a navy too much honour  Henry VIII act sc  Ulysses speaking of Hector  I wonder now how yonder city stands  When we have here the base and pillar by us  Troilus and Cressida act sc  Othello  No my heart is turn'd to stone I strike it and it hurts my hand  Othello act sc  Not less even in this despicable now  Than when my name fill'd Afric with affrights  And froze your hearts beneath your torrid zone  Don Sebastian King of Portugal act  How long a space since first I lov'd it is  To look into a glass I fear  And am surpris'd with wonder when I miss  Grey hairs and wrinkles there  Cowley vol p  I chose the flourishing'st tree in all the park  With freshest boughs and fairest head  I cut my love into his gentle bark  And in three days behold 'tis dead  My very written flames so violent be  They've burnt and wither'd up the tree  Cowley vol p  Ah mighty Love that it were inward heat  Which made this precious Limbeck sweat  But what alas ah what does it avail  That she weeps tears so wond'rous cold  As scarce the asses hoof can hold  So cold that I admire they fall not hail  Cowley vol p  Je crains que cette saison  Ne nous amenne la peste  La gueule du chien celeste  Vomit feu sur l'horison  A fin que je m'en délivre  Je veux lire ton gros livre  Jusques au dernier feüillet  Tout ce que ta plume trace  Robinet a de la glace  A faire trembler Juillet  Maynard  In me tota ruens Venus  Cyprum deseruit  Horat Carm lib ode  Almeria  O Alphonso Alphonso  Devouring seas have wash'd thee from my sight  No time shall rase thee from my memory  No I will live to be thy monument  The cruel ocean is no more thy tomb  But in my heart thou art interr'd  Mourning Bride act sc  This would be very right if there were any inconsistence in being interred in one place really and in another place figuratively  From considering that a word employ'd in a figurative sense suggests at the same time its proper meaning a fifth rule occurs That to raise a figure of speech we ought to use no word the proper sense of which is inconsistent or incongruous with the subject for no incongruity far less inconsistency whether real or imagined ought to enter into the expression of any subject  Interea genitor Tyberini ad fluminis undam  Vulnera  siccabat  lymphis  Aeneid x  Tres adeo incertos caeca caligine  soles  Erramus pelago totidem sine sidere noctes  Aeneid iii  The foregoing rule may be extended to form a sixth That no epithet ought to be given to the figurative sense of a word that agrees not also with its proper sense  Dicat Opuntiae  Frater Megillae quo  beatus  Vulnere  Horat Carm lib ode  Parcus deorum cultor et infrequens  Insanientis  dum sapientiae  Consultus erro  Horat Carm lib ode  Seventhly The crowding into one period or thought different figures of speech is not less faulty than crowding metaphors in that manner The mind is distracted in the quick transition from one image to another and is puzzled instead of being pleased  I am of ladies most deject and wretched  That suck'd the honey of his music vows  Hamlet  My bleeding bosom sickens at the sound  Odyss i  Ah miser  Quantâ laboras in  Charybdi  Digne puer meliore  flammâ  Quae saga quis te solvere Thessalis  Magus  venenis  quis poterit deus  Vix illigatum te triformi  Pegasus expediet  Chimaerâ  Horat Carm lib ode  Eighthly If crowding figures be bad it is still worse to graft one figure upon another For instance  While his keen falchion drinks the warriors lives  Iliad xi  A falchion drinking the warriors blood is a figure built upon resemblance which is passable But then in the expression  lives  is again put for blood and by thus grafting one figure upon another the expression is rendered obscure and unpleasant  Ninthly Intricate and involved figures that can scarce be analized or reduced to plain language are least of all tolerable  Votis incendimus aras  Aeneid iii  Onerantque canistris  Dona laboratae Cereris  Aeneid viii  Vulcan to the Cyclopes  Arma acri facienda viro nunc viribus usus  Nunc manibus rapidis omni nunc arte magistra  Praecipitate  moras  Aeneid viii  Huic gladio perque aerea suta  Per tunicam squalentem auro latus  haurit  apertum  Aeneid x  Semotique prius tarda necessitas  Lethi corripuit gradum  Horat Carm lib ode  Scribêris Vario fortis et hostium  Victor Maeonii carminis  alite  Horat Carm lib ode  Else shall our fates be number'd with the dead  Iliad v  Commutual death the fate of war confounds  Iliad viii and xi  Speaking of Proteus  Instant he wears elusive of the rape  The mimic force of every savage shape  Odyss iv  Rolling convulsive on the floor is seen  The piteous object of a prostrate Queen  Ibid iv  The mingling tempest waves its gloom  Autumn  A various sweetness swells the gentle race  Ibid  A sober calm fleeces unbounded ether  Ibid  The distant waterfall swells in the breeze  Winter  In the tenth place When a subject is introduced by its proper name it is absurd to attribute to it the properties of a different subject to which the word is sometimes apply'd in a figurative sense  Hear me oh Neptune thou whose arms are hurl'd  From shore to shore and gird the solid world  Odyss ix  Neptune is here introduced personally and not figuratively for the ocean the description therefore which is only applicable to the ocean is altogether improper  It is not sufficient that a figure of speech be regularly constructed and be free from blemish it requires taste to discern when it is proper when improper and taste I suspect is the only guide we can rely on One however may gather from reflection and experience that ornaments and graces suit not any of the dispiriting passions nor are proper for expressing any thing grave and important In familiar conversation they are in some measure ridiculous Prospero in the  Tempest  speaking to his daughter Miranda says  The fringed curtains of thine eyes advance  And say what thou seest yond  No exception can be taken to the justness of the figure and circumstances may be imagined to make it proper but it is certainly not proper in familiar conversation  In the last place though figures of speech have a charming effect when accurately constructed and properly introduced they ought however to be scattered with a sparing hand nothing is more luscious and nothing consequently more satiating than redundant ornament of any kind  CHAP XXI Narration and Description  HORACE and many writers after him give instructions for chusing a subject adapted to the genius of the author But rules of criticism would be endless did one descend to peculiarities in talent or genius The aim of the present work is to consider human nature in general and to explore what is common to the species The choice of a subject comes not under such a plan but the manner of execution comes under it because the manner of execution is subjected to general rules These rules respect the things expressed as well as the language or expression which suggests a division of the present chapter into two parts first of thoughts and next of words I pretend not to justify this division as entirely accurate In discoursing  of the thoughts it is difficult to abstract altogether from words and still more difficult in discoursing of the words to abstract altogether from thought  The first observation is That the thoughts which embellish a narration ought to be chaste and solid While the mind is intent upon facts it is little disposed to the operarations of the imagination Poetical images in a grave history are intolerable and yet Strada's Belgic history is full of poetical images These being discordant with the subject are disgustful and they have a still worse effect by giving an air of fiction to a genuine history Such flowers ought to be scattered with a sparing hand even in epic poetry and at no rate are they proper till the reader be warmed and by an enlivened imagination be prepared to relish them in that state of mind they are extremely agreeable But while we are sedate and attentive to an historical chain of facts we reject with disdain every fiction This Belgic history is indeed wofully vicious both in matter and form it is stuffed with  frigid and unmeaning reflections as well as with poetical flashes which even laying aside the impropriety are mere tinsel  Vida  Poet lib l  following Horace recommends a modest commencement of an epic poem giving for a reason that the writer ought to husband his fire This reason has weight but what is said above suggests a reason still more weighty Bold thoughts and figures are never relished till the mind be heated and thoroughly engaged which is not the reader's case at the commencement Shakespear in the first part of his history of Henry VI begins with a sentiment too bold for the most heated imagination  Bedford  Hung be the heav'ns with black yield day to night  Comets importing change of times and states  Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky  And with them scourge the bad revolting stars  That have consented unto Henry's death  Henry the Fifth too famous to live long  England ne'er lost a king of so much worth  The passage with which Strada begins his history is too poetical for a subject of that kind and at any rate too high for the beginning of a grave performance A third reason ought to have not less influence than either of the former A man who upon his first appearance endeavours to exhibit all his talents is never relished the first periods of a work ought therefore to be short natural and simple Cicero in his oration  pro Archia poeta  errs against this rule his reader is out of breath at the very first period which seems never to end Burnet begins the history of his own times with a period long and intricate  A third rule or observation is That where the subject is intended for entertainment solely not for instruction a thing ought to be described as it appears not as it is in reality In running for example the impulse upon the ground is accurately proportioned to the celerity of motion in appearance  it is otherwise for a person in swift motion seems to skim the ground and scarcely to touch it Virgil with great taste describes quick running according to its appearance and thereby raises an image far more lively than it could have been by adhering scrupulously to truth  Hos super advenit Volsca de gente Camilla  Agmen agens equitum et florentes aere catervas  Bellatrix non illa colo calathisve Minervae  Foemineas assueta manus sed praelia virgo  Dura pati cursuque pedum praevertere ventos  Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret  Gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas  Vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tumenti  Ferret iter celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas  Aeneid vii  This example is copied by the author of  Telemachus  Les Brutiens sont legeres à la course comme les cerfs et comme les daims On croiroit que l'herbe même la plus tendre n'est point foulée sous leurs pieds à peine laissent ils dans le sable quelques traces de leurs pas  Liv  Again  Déja il avoit abattu Eusilas si léger à la course qu'à peine il imprimoit la trace de ses pas dans le sable et qui devançoit dans son pays les plus rapides flots de l'Eurotas et de l'Alphée  Liv  Fourthly In narration as well as in description facts and objects ought to be painted so accurately as to form in the mind of the reader distinct and lively images Every useless circumstance ought indeed to be suppressed because every such circumstance loads the narration but if a circumstance be necessary however slight it cannot be described too minutely The force of language consists in raising complete images  Part sect  which cannot be done till the reader forgetting himself be transported as by magic into the very place and time of the important action and be converted as it were into a real spectator beholding every thing that passes In this view the narrative in an epic poem ought to rival a picture  in the liveliness and accuracy of its representations no circumstance must be omitted that tends to make a complete image because an imperfect image as well as any other imperfect conception is cold and uninterresting I shall illustrate this rule by several examples giving the first place to a beautiful passage from Virgil  Qualis  populeâ  moerens Philomela sub umbrâ  Amiss  s queritur foetus quos durus  arator  Observans nido  implumes  detraxit  Georg lib l  The poplar plowman and unfledged though not essential in the description are circumstances that tend to make a complete image and upon that account are an embellishment  Again  Hic viridem Aeneas  frondenti ex ilice  metam  Constituit signum nautis  Aeneid v  Horace addressing to Fortune  Te pauper ambit sollicita prece  Ruris colonus te dominam aequoris  Quicumque Bithynâ lacessit  Carpathium pelagus carinâ  Carm lib ode  Illum ex moenibus hosticis  Matrona bellantis tyranni  Prospiciens et adulta virgo  Suspiret Eheu ne rudis agminum  Sponsus lacessat regius asperum  Tactu leonem quem cruenta  Per medias rapit ira caedes  Carm lib ode  Shakespear says  Henry V act sc    "You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice by fanning in his face with a  peacock  's father"  The peacock's feather not to mention the beauty of the object completes the image An accurate image cannot be formed of this fanciful operation without conceiving a particular feather and the mind is at some loss when this is not specified in the description  Again  "The rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drown'd a bitch's blind puppies fifteen i' th' litter  Merry Wives of Windsor act sc  "  Old Lady  You would not be a queen  Anne  No not for all the riches under heaven  Old Lady  'Tis strange a threepence bow'd would hire me old as I am to queen it  Henry VIII act sc  In the following passage the action with all its material circumstances is represented so much to the life that it could not be better conceived by a real spectator and it is this manner of description which contributes greatly to the sublimity of the passage  He spake and to confirm his words outflew  Millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs  Of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze  Far round illumin'd hell highly they rag'd  Against the Highest and fierce with grasped arms  Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war  Hurling defiance toward the vault of heav'n  Milton b  A passage I am to cite from Shakespear falls not much short of that now mentioned in particularity of description  O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome  Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft  Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements  To towers and windows yea to chimneytops  Your infants in your arms and there have sat  The livelong day with patient expectation  To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome  And when you saw his chariot but appear  Have you not made an universal shout  That Tyber trembled underneath his banks  To hear the replication of your sounds  Made in his concave shores  Julius Caesar act sc  The  Henriade  of Voltaire errs greatly against the foregoing rule every thing is touched in a summary way without ever descending to the circumstances of an event This manner is good in a general history  the purpose of which is to record important transactions but in a fable which hath a very different aim it is cold and uninteresting because it is impracticable to form distinct images of persons or things represented in a manner so superficial  It is observed above that every useless circumstance ought to be suppressed To deal in such circumstances is a fault on the one hand not less to be avoided than the conciseness for which Voltaire is blamed on the other In the  Aeneid  Lib l  Barce the nurse of Sichaeus whom we never hear of before or after is introduced for a purpose not more important than to call Anna to her sister Dido And that it might not be thought unjust in Dido even in this trivial incident to prefer her husband's nurse before her own the poet takes care to inform his reader that Dido's nurse was dead To this I must oppose a beautiful passage in the same book where after Dido's last speech the poet supposing her  dead hastens to describe the lamentation of her attendants  Dixerat atque illam media inter talia ferro  Collapsam aspiciunt comites ensemque cruore  Spumantem sparsasque manus It clamor ad alta  Atria concussam bacchatur fama per urbem  Lamentis gemituque et foemineo ululatu  Tecta fremunt resonat magnis plangoribus aether  Lib l  As an appendix to the foregoing rule I add the following observation That to raise a sudden and strong impression some single circumstance happily selected has more power than the most laboured description Macbeth mentioning to his lady some voices he heard while he was murdering the King says  There's one did laugh in's sleep and one cry'd Murder  They wak'd each other and I stood and heard them  But they did say their prayers and address them Again to sleep  Lady  There are two lodg'd together  Macbeth  One cry'd God bless us and Amen the other  As they had seen me with these hangman's hands  Listening their fear I could not say Amen  When they did say God bless us  Lady  Consider it not so deeply  Macbeth  But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen  I had most need of blessing and Amen  Stuck in my throat  Lady  These deeds must not be thought  After these ways so it will make us mad  Macbeth  Methought I heard a voice cry  Sleep no more  Macbeth doth murder sleep  c  Act sc  Describing Prince Henry  I saw young Harry with his beaver on  His cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm'd  Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury  And vaulted with such ease into his seat  As if an angel dropt down from the clouds  To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus  And witch the world with noble horsemanship  First Part Henry IV act sc  King Henry  Lord Cardinal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss  Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope  He dies and makes no sign  Second Part Henry VI act sc  The same author speaking ludicrously of an army debilitated with diseases says  Half of them dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces  To draw a character is the masterstroke of description In this Tacitus excels his figures are natural distinct and complete not a feature wanting or misplaced Shakespear however exceeds Tacitus in the sprightliness of his figures some characteristical circumstance is generally invented or laid hold of which paints more to the life than many words The following instances will explain my meaning and at the same time prove my observation to be just  Why should a man whose blood is warm within  Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster  Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice  By being peevish I tell that what Anthonio  I love thee and it is my love that speaks  There are a sort of men whose visages  Do cream and mantle like a standing pond  And do a wilful stillness entertain  With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion  Of wisdom gravity profound conceit  As who should say I am Sir Oracle  And when I ope my lips let no dog bark  O my Anthonio I do know of those  That therefore only are reputed wise  For saying nothing  Merchant of Venice act sc  Again  Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice his reasons are two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search  Ibid  In the following passage a character is completed by a single stroke  Shallow  O the mad days that I have spent and to see how many of mine old acquaintance are dead  Silence  We shall all follow Cousin  Shallow  Certain 'tis certain very sure very  sure Death as the Psalmist saith is certain to all all shall die How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair  Slender  Truly Cousin I was not there  Shallow  Death is certain Is old

remembrance of such places and goes to them by his note There is no hiding you in the house  Merry Wives of Windsor act sc  Congreve has an inimitable stroke of this kind in his comedy of  Love for Love  Ben Legend  Well father and how do all at home how does brother Dick and brother Val  Sir Sampson  Dick body o'me Dick has been  dead these two years I writ you word when you were at Leghorn

contradictions some are guilty of downright inconsistencies and some even rave like madmen Against such capital errors one cannot be warned to better purpose than by collecting instances The first shall be of a contradiction the most venial of all Virgil speaking of Neptune  Interea magno misceri murmure pontum  Emissamque hyemem sensit Neptunus et imis  Stagna refusa vadis  graviter commotu

And thinks himself but Sleep  Dryden All for Love act  Reasons that are common and known to every person ought to be taken for granted to express them is childish and interrupts the narration Quintus Curtius relating the battle of Issus  Jam in conspectu sed extra teli jactum utraque acies erat quum priores Persae inconditum et trucem sustulere clamorem Redditur et a Macedonibus major exercitus impar numero sed jugis montium vastisque saltibus repercussus  quippe semper circumjecta nemora petraeque quantamcumque accepere vocem multiplicato sono referunt  Having discussed what observations occurred upon the thoughts or things expressed I proceed to what more peculiarly concern the language or verbal dress The language proper for expressing passion is the subject of a former chapter Several observations there made are applicable to the present subject particularly That words are  intimately connected with the ideas they represent and that the representation cannot be perfect unless the emotions raised by the sound and the sense be concordant It is not sufficient that the sense be clearly expressed the words must correspond to the subject in every particular An elevated subject requires an elevated style what is familiar ought to be familiarly expressed a subject that is serious and important ought to be cloathed in plain nervous language a description on the other hand addressed to the imagination is susceptible of the highest ornaments that sounding words metaphor and figurative expression can bestow upon it  I shall give a few examples of the foregoing doctrine A poet of any genius will not readily dress a high subject in low words and yet blemishes of this kind are found even in some classical works Horace observing that men perfectly satisfied with themselves are seldom so with their condition introduces Jupiter indulging to each his own choice  Jam faciam quod vultis eris tu qui modo miles  Mercator tu consultus modo rusticus hinc vos  Vos hinc mutatis discedite partibus eia  Quid statis nolint atqui licet esse beatis  Quid causae est merito quin illis Jupiter ambas  Iratus buccas inflet neque se fore posthac  Tam facilem dicat votis ut praebeat aurem  Serm lib sat l  Jupiter in wrath puffing up both cheeks is a ludicrous expression far from suitable to the gravity of the subject every one must feel the discordance The following couplet sinking far below the subject is not less ludicrous  Not one looks backward onward still he goes  Yet ne'er looks forward farther than his nose  Essay on Man ep iv  On the other hand to raise the expression above the tone of the subject is a fault than which none is more common Take the following instances  Orcan le plus fidéle à server ses desseins  Né sous le ciel brûlant des plus noirs

language swells frequently above his subject I give an example  Mr le Comte de Boulainvilliers et Mr l'Abbé Dubos ont fait chacun un systeme dont l'un semble être une conjuration contre le tiersetat et l'autre une conjuration contre la noblesse Lorsque le Soleil donna à Phaéton son char à conduire il lui dit Si vous montez trop haut vous brulerez la demeure céleste si vous descendez trop bas vous

The following passage intended one would imagine as a receipt to boil water is altogether  burlesque by the laboured elevation of the diction  A massy caldron of stupendous frame  They brought and plac'd it o'er the rising flame  Then heap the lighted wood the flame divides  Beneath the vase and climbs around the sides  In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream  The boiling water bubbles to the brim  Pope's Homer book xviii  In a passage near the beginning of the th book of Telamachus one feels a sudden bound upward without preparation which accords not with the subject  Claypso qui avoit été jusqu'à ce moment immobile et transportée de plaisir en écoutant les avantures de Télémaque l'interrompit pour lui faire prendre quelque repos Il est tems lui ditelle que vous alliez goûter

because it lies open to the same censure but the force of authority is great  At regina gravi jamdudum saucia cura  Vulnus alit venis caeco carpitur igni  Multa viri virtus animo multusque recursat  Gentis honos haerent infixi pectore vultus  Verbaque nec placidam membris dat cura quietem  Postera Phoebea lustrabat lampade terras  Humentemque Aurora polo dimoverat umbram  Cum sic unanimem alloquitur malesana sororem  Lib iv  Take another example where the words rise above the subject  Ainsi les peuples y accoururent bientôt en foule de toutes parts le commerce de cette ville étoit semblable au flux et reflux de la mer Les trésors y entroient comme les flots viennent l'un sur l'autre Tout y etoit apporté et en sortoit librement tout  ce qui y entroit étoit utile toute ce qui en sortoit laissoit en sortant d'autres richesses en sa place La justice sevére presidoit dans le port au milieu de tant de nations La franchise la bonne foi la candeur sembloient du haut de ces superbs tours appeller les marchands des terres les plus éloignées chacun des ces marchands  soit qu'il vint des rives orientales où le soleil sort chaque jour du sein des ondes soit qu'il fût parti de cette grande mer où le soleil assé de son cours va eteindre ses feux  vivoit plaisible et en sureté dans Salente comme dans sa patrie  Telemaque l  The language of Homer is suited to his subject not less accurately than the actions and sentiments of his heroes are to their characters Virgil in this particular falls short of perfection his language is stately throughout and though he descends at times to the simplest branches of cookery roasting and boiling for example yet he never relaxes a moment from the high tone  See Aeneid lib i  In adjusting his language to his subject no writer equals Swift I can recollect but one exception which at the same time is far  from being gross The journal of a modern lady is composed in a style where sprightliness is blended with familiarity perfectly suited to the subject In one passage however the poet assumes a higher tone which corresponds neither to the subject nor to the tone of language employ'd in the rest of that piece The passage I have in view begins  l    "But let me now a while survey"  c  and ends at  l    It is proper to be observed upon this head that writers of inferior rank are continually upon the stretch to enliven and enforce their subject by exaggeration and superlatives This unluckily has an effect opposite to what is intended the reader disgusted with language that swells above the subject is led by contrast to think more meanly of the subject than it may possibly deserve A man of prudence beside will be not less careful to husband his strength in writing than in walking a writer too liberal of superlatives exhausts his whole stock upon ordinary incidents and reserves no share to  express with greater energy matters of importance  Montaigne reflecting upon the then present modes observes that there never was at any other time so abject and servile prostitution of words in the addresses made by people of fashion to one another the humblest tenders of life and soul no professions under that of devotion and adoration the writer constantly declaring himself a vassal nay a slave so that when any more serious occasion of friendship or gratitude requires more genuine professions words are wanting to express them    The power that language possesses to imitate thought goes farther than to the capital circumstances above mentioned it reacheth even the slighter modifications Slow action for example is imitated by words pronounced slow labour or toil by words harsh or rough in their sound But this subject has been already handled  Ch sect    In dialoguewriting the condition of the speaker is chiefly to be regarded in framing the expression The centinel in  Hamlet  interrogated about the ghost whether his watch had been quiet answers with great  propriety for a man in his station  "Not a mouse stirring  One can scarce avoid smiling at the blindness of a certain critic who with an air of selfsufficiency condemns this expression as low and vulgar A French poet says he would express the same thought in a more sublime manner  "Mais tout dort et l'armée et les vents et Neptune"  And he adds  "The English poet may please at London but the French every where else"  "  I proceed to a second remark not less important than the former No person of reflection but must be sensible that an incident makes a stronger impression on an eyewitness than when heard at second hand Writers of genius sensible that the eye is the best avenue to the heart represent every thing as passing in our sight and from readers or hearers transform us as it were into spectators A skilful writer conceals himself and presents his personages In a word every thing becomes dramatic as much as possible Plutarch  de gloria Atheniensium  observes that Thucydides makes his reader a spectator and inspires him with the same passions as if he were an eyewitness I am intitled to  make the same observation upon our countryman Swift From this happy talent arises that energy of style which is peculiar to him he cannot always avoid narration but the pencil is his choice by which he bestows life and colouring upon his objects Pope is richer in ornament but possesses not in the same degree the talent of drawing from the life A translation of the sixth satire of Horace begun by the former and finished by the latter affords the fairest opportunity for a comparison Pope obviously imitates the picturesque manner of his friend yet every one of taste must be sensible that the imitation though fine falls short of the original In other instances where Pope writes in his own style the difference of manner is still more conspicuous  Abstract or general terms have no good effect in any composition for amusement because it is only of particular objects that images can be formed  See chap  Shakespear's style in that respect is excellent Every article  in his descriptions is particular as in nature and if accidentally a vague expression slip in the blemish is extremely discernible by the bluntness of its impression Take the following example Falstaff excusing himself for running away at a robbery says  By the Lord I knew ye as well as he that made ye Why hear ye my masters was it for me to kill the heirapparent should I turn upon the true prince Why thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules but beware instinct the lion will not touch the true prince instinct is a great matter I was a coward on instinct I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life I for a valiant lion and thou for a true prince But by the Lord lads I am glad you have the money Hostess clap to the doors watch tonight pray tomorrow Gallants lads boys hearts of gold all the titles of good fellowship come to you What shall we be merry shall we have a play  extempore  First Part Henry IV act sc  The particular words I object to are  instinct is a great matter  which make but a poor figure compared with the liveliness  of the rest of the speech It was one of Homer's advantages that he wrote before general terms were multiplied the superior genius of Shakespear displays itself in avoiding them after they were multiplied Addison describes the family of Sir Roger de Coverley in the following words  You would take his valet de chambre for his brother his butler is grayheaded his groom is one of the gravest men that I have ever seen and his coachman has the looks of a privy counsellor  Spectator N  o    The description of the groom is less lively than of the others plainly because the expression being vague and general tends not to form any image  "Dives opum variarum  Georg l ii  "  is an expression still more vague and so are the following  Maecenas mearum  Grande decus columenque rerum  Horat Carm l ode  et side Teîa  Dices laborantes in uno  Penelopen vitreamque Circen  Horat Carm l ode  In the fine arts it is a rule to put the capital objects in the strongest point of view and even to present them oftener than once where it can be done In historypainting the principal figure is placed in the front and in the best light an equestrian statue is placed in a centre of streets that it may be seen from many places at once In no composition is there a greater opportunity for this rule than in writing  Sequitur pulcherrimus Astur  Astur equo fidens et versicoloribus armis  Aeneid x  Full many a lady  I've ey'd with best regard and many a time  Th' harmony of their tongues hath

proverb The fathers have eaten four grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge As I live saith the Lord  God ye shall not have occasion to use this proverb in Israel If a man keep my judgements to deal truly he is just he shall surely live But if he be a robber a shedder of blood if he have eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbour's wife if he have oppressed the poor and needy have spoiled by violence have not restored the pledge have lift up his eyes to idols have given forth upon usury and have taken increase shall he live he shall not live he shall surely die and his blood shall be upon him Now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his father's sins and considereth and doth not such like that hath not eaten upon the mountains hath not lift up his eyes to idols nor defiled his neighbour's wife hath not oppressed any nor withheld the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with a garment that hath not received usury nor increase that hath executed my judgments and walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live The soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not

criticism Suppose we were at a loss about the reason might not taste be sufficient to justify them At the same time one must be devoid of understanding not to be sensible that they make the narration dramatic and give an air of truth by making things appear as passing in our sight  A concise comprehensive style is a great ornament in narration and a superfluity of unnecessary words not less than of circumstances a great nuisance A judicious selection of the striking circumstances cloathed in a nervous style is delightful In this style Tacitus excels all writers ancient and modern Instances are numberless take the following specimen  Crebra hinc praelia et saepius in modum latrocinii per saltus per paludes ut cuique fors aut virtus temere proviso ob iram ob praedam jussu et aliquando ignaris ducibus  Annal lib §  If a concise or nervous style be a beauty tautology must be a blemish And yet writers fettered by verse are not sufficiently careful to avoid this slovenly practice they may be pitied but they cannot be justified Take for a specimen the following instances from the best poet for versification at least that England has to boast of  High on his helm celestial lightnings play  His beamy shield emits a living ray  Th' unweary'd blaze incessant streams supplies  Like the red star that fires th' autumnal skies  Iliad v  Strength and omnipotence invest thy throne  Iliad

epithets such as  humid  in the last citation are by Quintilian disallowed to orators but indulged to poets  Lib cap §  because his favourite poets in a few instances are reduced to such epithets for the sake of versification For instance  Prata canis albicant pruinis  of Horace and  liquidos fontes  of Virgil  As an apology for such careless expressions it may well suffice that Pope in  submitting to be a translator acts below his genius In a translation it is hard to require the same spirit or accuracy that is chearfully bestowed on an original work And to support the reputation of this author I shall give some instances from Virgil and Horace more faulty by redundancy than any of those above mentioned  Saepe etiam immensum coelo venit agmen aquarum  Et foedam glomerant

represented by colours or by words What is the cause of this difference The cause with respect to painting is obvious A good picture whatever the subject be is agreeable because of the pleasure we take in imitation the agreeableness of imitation overbalances the disagreeableness of the subject and the picture upon the whole is agreeable It requires a greater compass to explain the cause with respect to the description of an ugly object To connect individuals in the social state no one particular contributes more than language by the power it  possesses of an expeditious communication of thought and a lively representation of transactions But nature hath not been satisfied to recommend language by its utility merely it is made susceptible of many beauties that have no relation to utility which are directly felt without the intervention of any reflection  See chap  And this unfolds the mystery for the pleasure of language is so great as in a lively description to overbalance the disagreeableness of the image raised by it  See chap part  This however is no encouragement to deal in disagreeable subjects for the pleasure is out of sight greater where the subject and the description are both of them agreeable  The following description is upon the whole agreeable though the subject described is in itself dismal  Nine times the space that measures day and night  To

situation waste and wild  A dungeon horrible on all sides round  As one great furnace flam'd yet from those flames  No light but rather darkness visible  Serv'd only to discover sights of wo  Regions

the idea of such an object Every thing horrible ought therefore to be avoided in a description Nor is this a severe law the poet will avoid such scenes for his own sake as well as for that of his reader and to vary his descriptions nature affords plenty of objects that disgust  us in some degree without raising horror I am obliged therefore to condemn the picture of sin in the second book of

not to be sufferable in a representation not even Shakespear's masterly hand can make the picture agreeable  Though the objects introduced in the following scenes are not altogether so horrible as Sin

Aeneid lib iii  CHAP XXII Epic and Dramatic Compositions  TRAGEDY differs from the epic more in form than in substance The ends proposed by each are instruction and amusement and each of them copy human actions as means to bring about these ends They differ in the manner only of copying Epic poetry deals in narration Tragedy represents its facts as transacted in our sight In the former the poet introduces himself as an historian in the latter he presents his actors and never himself  The dialogue in a dramatic composition separates it so clearly from other compositions that no writer has thought it necessary to search for any other distinguishing mark But much useless labour has been bestowed to distinguish an epic poem by some such mark Bossu defines this poem to be  "A composition in verse intended to form the manners by instructions disguised under the allegories of an importantaction"  which will exclude every epic poem founded upon real facts and perhaps include several of Esop's fables Voltaire reckons verse so essential as for that single reason to exclude the adventures of Telemachus See his  Essay upon Epic Poetry  Others affected with substance more than with ornament hesitate not to pronounce that poem to be epic It is not a little diverting to see so many shallow critics hunting for what is not to be found They always take for granted without the least foundation that there must be some precise criterion to distinguish epic poetry from every other species of writing Literary compositions run into each other precisely like colours in their strong tints they are easily distinguished but are susceptible of so much variety and take on so many different forms that we never can say where one species ends and another begins As to the general taste there is little reason to doubt that a work where heroic actions are related in an elevated style will without further requisite be deemed an epic poem    This difference regarding form only may be thought slight but the effects it occasions are by no means so What we see makes a stronger impression than what we learn from others A narrative poem is a story told by another facts and incidents passing upon the stage come under our own observation and are beside much enlivened by action and gesture expressive of many sentiments beyond the reach of language  A dramatic composition has another property independent altogether of action A dialogue makes a deeper impression than a narration because in the former persons express their own sentiments whereas in the latter sentiments are related at second hand For that reason Aristotle the father of critics lays it down as a rule That in an epic poem the author ought to take every opportunity to introduce his actors and to confine the narrative part within the narrowest bounds  Poet ch sect  Homer understood perfectly the advantage of this method and his poems are both of them in a great measure dramatic Lucan runs to the opposite extreme and is guilty of a still greater fault the  Pharsalia  is stuffed with cold and languid reflections the merit of which the author assumes to himself and deigns not to share with his personages Nothing can be more impertinent than a chain of such reflections which suspend the battle of Pharsalia after the leaders had made their speeches  and the two armies are ready to engage  Lib from line to line    Aristotle from the nature of the fable divides tragedy into simple and complex But it is of greater moment with respect to dramatic as well as epic poetry to found a distinction upon the different ends attained by such compositions A poem whether dramatic or epic that hath no tendency beyond moving the passions and exhibiting pictures of virtue and vice may be distinguished by the name of  pathetic  But where a story is purposely contrived to illustrate some important lesson of morality by showing the natural connection betwixt disorderly passions and external misfortunes such composition may be denominated  moral  The same distinction is applicable to that sort of fable which is said to be the invention of Aesop A moral it is true is by all critics considered as essential to such a fable But nothing is more common than to be led blindly by authority Of the numerous collections I have seen the fables that clearly inculcate a moral make a very small part In many fables indeed proper pictures of virtue and vice are exhibited but the bulk of these collections convey no instruction nor afford any amusement beyond what a child receives in reading an ordinary story  It indeed conveys moral instruction  with a perspicuity that is not exceeded by the most accurate reasoning and makes a deeper impression than any moral discourse can do To be satisfied of this we need but reflect that a man whose affections are justly balanced hath a better chance to escape misfortunes than one who is a slave to every passion Indeed nothing is more evident than the natural connection that vice hath with misery and virtue with happiness and such connection may be illustrated by stating a fact as well as by urging an argument Let us assume for example the following moral truths That discord among the chiefs renders ineffectual all common measures and that the consequences of a slightlyfounded quarrel fostered by pride and arrogance are not less fatal than those of the grossest injury These truths may be inculcated by the quarrel betwixt Agamemnon and Achilles at the siege of Troy In this view it ought to be the poet's chief aim to invent proper circumstances  presenting to our view the natural consequences of such discord These circumstances must seem to arise in the common course of human affairs no accidental or unaccountable event ought to be indulged for the necessary or probable connection betwixt vice and misery is learned from no events but what are governed by the characters and passions of the persons represented A real event of which we see no cause may be a lesson to us because what hath happened may again happen but this cannot be inferred from a story that is known to be fictitious  Many are the good effects of such compositions A pathetic composition whether epic or dramatic tends to a habit of virtue by exciting emotions that produce good actions and avert us from those that are vicious or irregular  See chap part sect  It likewise by its frequent pictures of human woes humanizes the mind and fortifies us in bearing our own misfortunes A moral composition must obviously produce the same good effects because by being moral it doth  not cease to be pathetic It enjoys beside an excellence peculiar to itself for it not only improves the heart as above mentioned but instructs the head by the moral it contains For my part I cannot imagine any entertainment more suited to a rational being than a work thus happily illustrating some moral truth where a number of persons of different characters are engaged in an important action some retarding others promoting the great catastrophe and where there is dignity of style as well as of matter A work of this kind has our sympathy at command and can put in motion the whole train of the social affections We have at the same time great mental enjoyment in perceiving every event and every subordinate incident connected with its proper cause Our curiosity is by turns excited and gratified and our delight is consummated at the close upon finding from the characters and situations exhibited at the commencement that every circumstance down to the final catastrophe is natural and that the whole in conjunction make a regular chain of causes and effects  Considering an epic and dramatic poem as the same in substance and having the same aim or end it might be thought that they are equally fitted for the same subjects But considering their difference as to form there will be found reason to correct that thought at least in some degree Many subjects may indeed be treated with equal advantage in either form but the subjects are still more numerous for which one of the forms is better qualified than the other and there are subjects proper for the one and not for the other To give some slight notion of the difference as there is no room here for enlarging upon every article I observe that dialogue is better qualified for expressing sentiments and narrative for displaying facts These peculiarities tend to confine each within certain limits Heroism magnanimity undaunted courage and the whole tribe of the elevated virtues figure best in action tender passions and the whole tribe of sympathetic affections figure best in sentiment What we feel is the most remarkable in the latter what we perform is the most remarkable in the  former It clearly follows that tender passions are more peculiarly the province of tragedy grand and heroic actions of epic poetry  In Racine tender sentiments prevail in Corneille grand and heroic manners Hence clearly the preference of the former before the latter as dramatic poets Corneille would figure better in an heroic poem    I have no occasion to say more upon the epic considered as peculiarly adapted to certain subjects But as dramatic subjects are more complex I must take a narrower view of them which I do the more willingly in order to clear a point thrown into great obscurity by critics  In the chapter of emotions and passions  Part  it is occasionally shown that the subject best fitted for tragedy is the story of a man who has himself been the cause of his misfortune But this man must neither be deeply guilty nor altogether innocent The misfortune must be occasioned by a fault incident to human nature and therefore venial Misfortunes of this kind call forth the whole force of the social affections and  interest the spectator in the warmest manner An accidental misfortune if not extermely singular doth not greatly move our pity The person who suffers being innocent is freed from the greatest of all torments  viz  the anguish of mind occasioned by remorse  Poco é funesta  Laltrui fortuna  Quando non resta  Ragione alcuna  Ne di pentirsi né darrossir  Metastasio  A criminal on the other hand who brings misfortunes upon himself excites little pity for a different reason His remorse it is true aggravates his distress and swells the first emotions of pity but then our hatred to the criminal blending with pity blunts its edge considerably Misfortunes that are not innocent nor highly criminal partake the advantages of each extreme they are attended with remorse to embitter the distress which raises our pity to a great height and the slight indignation we have at a venial fault detracts not sensibly  from our pity For this reason the happiest of all subjects for tragedy if such a one could be invented would be where a man of integrity falls into a great misfortune by doing an innocent action but which by some singular means he conceives to be criminal His remorse aggravates his distress and our compassion unrestrained by indignation rises to its highest pitch Pity comes thus to be the ruling passion of a pathetic tragedy and by proper representation may be raised to a height scarce exceeded by any thing felt in real life A moral tragedy takes in a larger field for beside exercising our pity it raises another passion selfish indeed but which deserves to be cherished equally with the social affections When a misfortune is the natural consequence of some wrong bias in the temper every spectator who is conscious of some such defect in himself takes the alarm and considers that he is liable to the same misfortune This consideration raises in him an emotion of fear or terror and it is by this emotion frequently reiterated in a variety of moral tragedies that the  spectators are put upon their guard against the disorders of passion  The commentators upon Aristotle and other critics have been much graveled about the account given of tragedy by this author  "That by means of pity and terror it refines in us all sorts of passion"  But no one who has a clear conception of the end and effects of a good tragedy can have any difficulty about Aristotle's meaning Our pity is engaged for the persons represented and our terror is upon our own account Pity indeed is here made to stand for all the sympathetic emotions because of these it is the capital There can be no doubt that our sympathetic emotions are refined or improved by daily exercise and in what manner our other passions are refined by terror I have just now said One thing is certain that no other meaning can justly be given to the foregoing doctrine than that now mentioned and that it was really Aristotle's meaning appears from his th chapter where he delivers several propositions agreeable to the doctrine as here explained These at the same time I the rather chuse  to mention because so far as authority can go they confirm the foregoing reasoning about the proper subjects for tragedy His first proposition is That it being the province of tragedy to excite pity and terror an innocent person falling into adversity ought never to be the subject This proposition is a necessary consequence of his doctrine as explained a subject of this nature may indeed excite pity and terror but the former in an inferior degree and the latter in no degree for moral instruction The second proposition is That we must not represent a wicked person emerging from misery to good fortune This excites neither terror nor compassion nor is agreeable in any respect The third is That the misfortunes of a wicked person ought not to be represented Such representation may be agreeable in some measure upon a principle of justice but it will not move our pity or any degree of terror except in those of the same vicious disposition with the person represented His last proposition is That the only character fit for  representation lies in the middle neither eminently good nor eminently bad where the misfortune is not the effect of deliberate vice but of some involuntary fault as our author expresses it  If one can be amused with a grave discourse which promiseth much and performs nothing he may see this subject treated by Brumoy in his  Theatre Grec  Preliminary discourse on the origin of tragedy  The only objection I find to Aristotle's account of tragedy is that he confines it within too narrow bounds by refusing admittance to the pathetic kind For if terror be essential to tragedy no representation deserves that name but where the misfortunes exhibited are caused by a wrong balance of mind or some disorder in the internal constitution Such misfortunes always suggest moral instruction and by such misfortunes only can terror be excited for our improvement  Thus Aristotle's four propositions above mentioned relate solely to tragedies of the moral kind Those of the pathetic kind are not confined within so narrow limits Subjects fitted for the theatre are not in such plenty as to make us reject innocent  misfortunes which rouse our sympathy though they inculcate no moral With respect to subjects of this kind it may indeed be a doubtful question whether the conclusion ought not always to be happy Where a person of integrity is represented as suffering to the end under misfortunes purely accidental we depart discontented and with some obscure sense of injustice for seldom is man so submissive to the course of Providence as not to revolt against the tyranny and vexations of blind chance he will be inclined to say This ought not to be I give for an example the  Romeo and Juliet  of Shakespear where the fatal catastrophe is occasioned by Friar Laurence's coming to the monument a minute too late Such a story we think of with regret we are vexed at the unlucky chance and go away dissatisfied This is a temper of mind which ought not to be cherished and for that reason I vote for excluding stories of this kind from the theatre The misfortunes of a virtuous person arising from necessary causes or from a chain of unavoidable circumstances will I am apt to think  be considered in a different light Chance affords always a gloomy prospect and in every instance gives an impression of anarchy and misrule A regular chain on the other hand of causes and effects directed by the general laws of nature never fails to suggest the hand of Providence to which we submit without resentment being conscious that submission is our duty  See essays on the principles of morality edit p  For that reason we are not dissatisfied with the distresses of Voltaire's  Mariamne  though redoubled on her till the moment of her death without the least fault or failing on her part Her misfortunes are owing to a cause extremely natural and not unfrequent the jealousy of a barbarous husband The fate of Desdemona in the  Moor of Venice  affects us in the same manner We are not so easily reconciled to the fate of Cordelia in  King Lear  the causes of her misfortune are by no means so evident as to exclude the gloomy notion of chance In short it appears that a perfect character suffering under misfortunes is qualified  for being the subject of a pathetic tragedy provided chance be excluded Nor is it altogether inconsistent with a moral tragedy it may successfully be introduced as an underpart supposing the chief place to be filled with an imperfect character from which a moral can be drawn This is the case of Desdemona and Mariamne just now mentioned and it is the case of Monimia and Belvidera in Otway's two tragedies  The Orphan  and  Venice preserv'd  I had an early opportunity to unfold a curious doctrine That fable operates on our passions by representing its events as passing in our sight and by deluding us into a conviction of reality  Chap part sect  Hence in epic and dramatic compositions it is of importance to employ every means that may promote the delusion such as the borrowing from history some noted event with the addition of circumstances that may answer the author's purpose The principal facts are known to be true and we are disposed to extend our belief to every circumstance  But in chusing a subject that makes a figure in history greater precaution is necessary than where the whole is invented In the first place no circumstances must be added but such as connect naturally with what are known to be true history may be supplied but it must not be contradicted In the next place a pure fable entirely new with respect to the persons as well as the incidents may be supposed an ancient or a modern story But if the poet build upon truth the subject he chuses must be distant in time or at least in place for he ought by all means to avoid the familiarity of persons and events nearly connected with us Familiarity ought more especially to be avoided in an epic poem the peculiar character of which is dignity and elevation Modern manners make but a poor figure in such a poem  I would not from this observation be thought to undervalue modern manners The roughness plainness and impetuosity of ancient manners may show better in an epic poem without being better fitted for society But without regard to this circumstance it is the familiarity of modern manners that unqualifies them for a lofty subject The dignity of our present manners will be better understood in suture ages when they have become ancient    After Voltaire no writer it is probable will think of erecting an epic poem upon a recent event in the history of his own country But an event of this kind is perhaps not altogether unqualified for tragedy It was admitted in Greece and Shakespear has employ'd it successfully in several of his pieces One advantage it possesses above fiction that of more readily engaging our belief which tends above any other particular to raise our sympathy The scene of comedy is generally laid at home familiarity is no objection and we are peculiarly sensible of the ridicule of our own manners  After a proper subject is chosen there appears to me some delicacy in dividing it into parts The conclusion of a book in an epic poem or of an act in a play cannot be altogether arbitrary nor be intended for so slight a purpose as to make the parts of equal length The supposed pause at the end of every book and the real pause at the end of every act ought always to coincide with some pause in the action In this respect  a dramatic or epic poem ought to resemble a sentence or period in language divided into members that are distinguished from each other by regular pauses or it ought to resemble a piece of music having a full close at the end preceded by imperfect closes that contribute to the melody Every act therefore ought to close with some incident that makes a pause in the action for otherwise there can be no pretext for interrupting the representation It would be absurd to break off in the very heat of action against this every one would exclaim The absurdity still remains though the action relents if it be not actually suspended for some time This rule is also applicable to an epic poem though there a deviation from the rule is less remarkable because it is in the reader's power to hide the absurdity by proceeding instantly to another book The first book of the  Paradise Lost  ends without any regular close perfect or imperfect it breaks off abruptly where Satan seated on his throne is prepared to make a speech to the convocated host of the fall'n angels and the second book begins  with the speech Milton seems to have copied the  Aeneid  of which the two first books are divided much in the same manner Neither is there any proper pause at the end of the fifth book of the  Aeneid  There is no proper pause at end of the seventh book of  Paradise Lost  nor at the end of the eleventh  Hitherto I have carried on together the epic and dramatic compositions I proceed to handle them separately and to mention circumstances peculiar to each beginning with the epic kind In a theatrical entertainment which employs both the eye and the ear it would be a monstrous absurdity to introduce upon the stage invisible beings in a visible shape But it has been much disputed whether such beings may not be properly introduced in an epic poem If we rest upon the authority of practice we must declare for the affirmative and Boileau  Third part of his art of poetry  among many other critics is a stout champion for this sort of machinery But waving authority which is apt to impose  upon the judgement let us draw what light we can from reason I begin with a preliminary remark That this matter is but indistinctly handled by critics It is laid down above that several passions incite the mind to animate its objects  Chap sect  the moral virtues become so many goddesses and even darts and arrows are inspired with life and action But then it must not be overlooked that such personification being the work of imagination is descriptive only and assumes not even an appearance of truth  Ibid  This is very different from what is termed  machinery  where deities angels devils or other supernatural powers are introduced as real personages mixing in the action and contributing to the catastrophe and yet these two things are constantly jumbled together in the reasoning The poetical privilege of animating insensible objects for the sake of description cannot be controverted because it is founded on a natural principle But has the privilege of machinery if it be a privilege the  same good foundation Far from it nothing can be more unnatural Its effects at the same time are deplorable First it gives an air of fiction to the whole and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections and to move our passions  See chap part sect  This of itself is sufficient to explode machinery whatever entertainment it may give to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination And next were it possible to disguise the fiction and to delude us into a notion of reality which I think can hardly be an insuperable objection would still remain which is that the aim or end of an epic poem can never be accomplished in any perfection where machinery is introduced Virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully but by the actions of those who are endued with passions and affections like our own that is by human actions And as for moral instruction it is evident that we can draw none from beings who act not upon the same principles with us A fable in Aesop's  manner is no objection to this reasoning His lions bulls and goats are truly men under disguise they act and feel in every respect as human beings and the moral we draw is founded on that supposition Homer it is true introduces the gods into his fable and he was authorised to take that liberty by the religion of his country it being an article in the Grecian creed that the gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs I must however observe that Homer's deities do no honour to his poems Fictions that transgress the bounds of nature seldom have a good effect they may inflame the imagination for a moment but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste Let me add that of whatever use such fictions may be to a mean genius an able writer has much finer materials of Nature's production for elevating his subject and making it interesting  Boileau a strenuous advocate for the Heathen deities as observed declares against angels and devils though supported by the religious creed of his country One would be apt to imagine that a critic famed  for his good taste could have no other meaning than to justify the employing Heathen deities for enlivening or elevating the description But as the Heathen deities make not a better figure in poetical language than angels and devils Boileau in pleading for the former certainly meant if he had any distinct meaning that these may be introduced as actors And in fact he himself is guilty of this glaring absurdity where it is not so pardonable as in an epic poem In his ode upon the taking of Namur he demands with a most serious countenance whether the walls were built by Apollo or Neptune and in relating the passage of the Rhine  anno  he describes the god of that river as fighting with all his might to oppose the French monarch This is confounding fiction with reality at a strange rate The French writers in general run into this error wonderful that they should not be sensible how ridiculous it is  That this is a capital error in the  Gierusalleme liberata  Tasso's greatest admirers must acknowledge A situation can never  be intricate nor the reader ever in pain about the catastrophe so long as there is an angel devil or magician to lend a helping hand Voltaire in his essay upon epic poetry talking of the  Pharsalia  observes judiciously  "That the proximity of time the notoriety of events the character of the age enlightened and political joined with the solidity of Lucan's subject deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction"  Is it not amazing that a critic who reasons so justly with respect to others can be so blind with respect to himself Voltaire not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior beings introduces them into the action In the sixth canto of the  Henriade  St Louis appears in person and terrifies the soldiers in the seventh canto St Louis sends the god of Sleep to Henry and in the tenth the demons of Discord Fanaticism War  c  assist Aumale in a single combat with Turenne and are chased away by a good angel brandishing the sword of God To blend such fictitious personages in the same action with mortals  makes a bad figure at any rate and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry IV This singly is sufficient to make the  Henriade  a shortliv'd poem were it otherwise possessed of every beauty I have tried serious reasoning upon this subject but ridicule I suppose will be found a more successful weapon which Addison has applied in an elegant manner  "Whereas the time of a general peace is in all appearance drawing near being informed that there are several ingenious persons who intend to shew their talents on so happy an occasion and being willing as much as in me lies to prevent that effusion of nonsense which we have good cause to apprehend I do hereby strictly require every person who shall write on this subject to remember that he is a Christian and not to sacrifice his catechism to his poetry In order to it I do expect of him in the first place to make his own poem without depending upon Phoebus for any part of it or calling out for aid upon any of the muses by name I do likewise positively  forbid the sending of Mercury with any particular message or dispatch relating to the peace and shall by no means suffer Minerva to take upon her the shape of any plenipotentiary concerned in this great work I do further declare that I shall not allow the destinies to have had an hand in the deaths of the several thousands who have been slain in the late war being of opinion that all such deaths may be very well accounted for by the Christian system of powder and ball I do therefore strictly forbid the fates to cut the thread of man's life upon any pretence whatsoever unless it be for the sake of the rhyme And whereas I have good reason to fear that Neptune will have a great deal of business on his hands in several poems which we may now suppose are upon the anvil I do also prohibit his appearance unless it be done in metaphor simile or any very short allusion and that even here he be not permitted to enter but with great caution and circumspection I desire that the same rule may be extended to his  whole fraternity of Heathen gods it being my design to condemn every poem to the flames in which Jupiter thunders or exercises any other act of authority which does not belong to him In short I expect that no Pagan agent shall be introduced or any fact related which a man cannot give credit to with a good conscience Provided always that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to several of the female poets in this nation who shall still be left in full possession of their gods and goddesses in the same manner as if this paper had never been written"  Spectator N  o    The marvellous is indeed so much promoted by machinery that it is not wonderful to find it embraced by the bulk of writers and perhaps of readers If indulged at all it is generally indulged to excess Homer introduces his deities with no greater ceremony than his mortals and Virgil has still less moderation an overwatched pilot cannot fall asleep and drop into the sea by natural means the two  lovers Aeneas and Dido cannot take the same bed without the immediate interposition of superior powers The ridiculous in such fictions must appear even through the thickest vail of gravity and solemnity  Angels and devils serve equally with the Heathen deities as materials for figurative language perhaps better among Christians because we believe in them and not in the Heathen deities But every one is sensible as well as Boileau that the invisible powers in our creed make a much worse figure as actors in a modern poem than the invisible powers in the Heathen creed did in ancient poems The reason I take to be what follows The Heathen deities in the opinion of their votaries were beings elevated one step only above mankind actuated by the same passions and directed by the same motives therefore not altogether improper to mix with mankind in an important action In our creed superior beings are placed at such a mighty distance from us and are of a nature so different that with no propriety can they appear with us upon the same stage Man is a creature so much inferior  that he loses all dignity when set in opposition  There seems to be no doubt that an historical poem admits the embellishment of allegory as well as of metaphor simile or other figure Moral truth in particular is finely illustrated in the allegorical manner It amuses the fancy to find abstract terms by a sort of magic converted into active beings and it is delightful to trace a general proposition in a pictured event But allegorical beings should be confined within their own sphere and never be admitted to mix in the principal action nor to cooperate in retarding or advancing the catastrophe This would have a still worse effect than the introduction of invisible powers and I am ready to assign the reason An historical fable affords entertainment chiefly by making us conceive its personages to be really existing and acting in our presence in an allegory this agreeable delusion is denied for we must not imagine an allegorical personage to be a real being but the figure only of some virtue or vice otherwise the allegory is lost The impression  of real existence essential to an epic poem is inconsistent with that figurative existence which is essential to an allegory and therefore no method can be more effectual to destroy the impression of reality than to introduce allegorical beings cooperating with those whom we conceive to be really existing The loveepisode in the  Henriade  Canto  is insufferable by the discordant mixture of allegory with real life This episode is copied from that of Rinaldo and Armida in the  Gierusalemme liberata  which hath no merit to intitle it to be copied An allegorical object such as fame in the  Aeneid  and the temple of love in the  Henriade  may find place in a description but to introduce Discord as a real personage imploring the assistance of Love as another real personage to enervate the courage of the hero is making these figurative beings act beyond their sphere and creating a strange jumble of discordant materials  viz  truth and fiction The allegory of Sin and Death in the  Paradise Lost  is I presume  not generally relished though it is not entirely of the same nature with what I have been condemning The  Paradise Lost  is not confined to the history of our first parents and in a work comprehending the atchievements of superior beings there is more room for fancy than where it is confined to human actions  What is the true notion of an episode or how is it to be distinguished from what is really a part of the principal action Every incident that promotes or retards the catastrophe must be a part of the principal action This clears the nature of an episode which may be defined  "An incident connected with the principal action but which contributes not either to advance or retard it"  The descent of Aeneas into hell doth not advance or retard the catastrophe and therefore is an episode The story of Nisus and Euryalus producing an alteration in the affairs of the contending parties is a part of the principal action The familyscene in the sixth book of the  Iliad  is of the same nature by Hector's retiring from the field of battle to visit his  wife the Grecians got liberty to breathe and even to press upon the Trojans It being thus the nature of an episode to break the unity of action it ought never to be indulged unless to refresh and unbend the mind after the fatigue of a long narration This purpose of an episode demands the following properties It ought to be well connected with the principal action it ought to be short and it ought to be lively and interesting  Next upon the peculiarities of a dramatic poem And the first I shall mention is a double plot being naturally led to it by what is said immediately above One of these double plots must be of the nature of an episode in an epic poem for it would distract the spectator instead of entertaining him if he were forc'd to attend at the same time to two capital plots equally interesting An underplot in a tragedy has seldom a good effect because a passionate piece cannot be too simple The sympathetic emotions once roused cling to their objects and cannot bear interruption  when a subject fills the mind it leaves no room for any separate concern  Racine in his preface to the tragedy of  Berenice  is sensible that simplicity is a great beauty in tragedy but mistakes the cause  "Nothing says he but verisimilitude pleases in tragedy but where is the verisimilitude that within the compass of a day events should be crowded which commonly are extended through months"  This is mistaking the accuracy of imitation for the probability or improbability of future events I explain myself The verisimilitude required in tragedy is that the actions correspond to the manners and the manners to nature When this resemblance is preserved the imitation is just because it is a true copy of nature But I deny that the verisimilitude of future events meaning the probability of future events is any rule in tragedy A number of extraordinary events are it is true seldom crowded within the compass of a day but what seldom happens may happen and when such events fall out they appear not less natural than the most ordinary accidents To make verisimilitude in the sense of probability a governing rule in tragedy would annihilate this sort of writing altogether for it would exclude all extraordinary events in which the life of tragedy consists It is very improbable or unlikely pitching upon any man at random that he will sacrifice his life and fortune for his mistress or for his country yet when this event happens supposing it agreeable to the character we recognize the verisimilitude as to nature whatever want of verisimilitude or of probability there was  a priori  that such would be the event  Variety is more tolerable in comedy which pretends only to amuse without totally occupying  the mind But even here to make a double plot agreeable a good deal of art is requisite The underplot ought not to vary greatly in its tone from that which is principal passions may be varied but discordant passions are unpleasant when jumbled together This is a solid objection to tragicomedy For this reason I blame the  Provok'd Husband  all the scenes that bring the family of the Wrongheads into action being ludicrous and farcical agree very ill with the sharpness and severity of the principal subject exhibiting the discord betwixt Lord Townly and his lady The same objection touches not the double plot of the  Careless Husband  the different subjects are sweetly connected and have only so much variety as to resemble shades of colours harmoniously mixed But this is not all The under plot ought to be connected with the principal action so as to employ the same persons the intervals or pauses of the principal action ought to be filled with the underplot and both ought to be concluded together This is the case of the  Merry Wives of Windsor  Violent action ought to be excluded from the stage While the dialogue runs on a thousand particulars concur to delude us into an impression of reality genuine sentiments passionate language and persuasive gesture The spectator once engaged is willing to be deceived loses sight of himself and without scruple enjoys the spectacle as a reality From this absent state he is roused by violent action he wakes as from a pleasing dream and gathering his senses about him finds all to be a fiction Horace delivers the same rule and founds it upon the reason given  Ne pueros coram populo Medea trucidet  Aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius Atreus  Aut in avem Progne vertatur Cadmus in anguem  Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi  The French critics as it appears to me misapprehend the reason of this rule Shedding blood upon the stage say they is barbarous and shocking to a polite audience This no doubt is an additional reason for excluding bloodshed from the  French stage supposing the French to be in reality so delicate But this evidently is not the reason that weighed with the Greeks that polite people had no notion of such delicacy witness the murder of Clytemnestra by her son Orestes passing behind the scene as represented by Sophocles Her voice is heard calling out for mercy bitter expostulations on his part loud shrieks upon her being stabb'd and then a deep silence I appeal to every person of feeling whether this scene be not more horrible than if the deed had been committed in sight of the spectators upon a sudden gust of passion According to the foregoing reasoning of the French critics there is nothing to exclude from the stage a duel occasioned by an affair of honour because in it there is nothing barbarous or shocking to a polite audience yet a scene of this nature is excluded from the French stage which shows without more argument that these critics have misapprehended the rule laid down by Horace If Corneille in representing the affair betwixt Horatius and his sister upon which murder  ensues behind the scene had no other view than to remove from the spectators a scene of horror he certainly was in a capital mistake for murder in cold blood which in some measure was the case as represented is more horrible even where the conclusive stab is not seen than the same act performed on the stage by violent and unpremeditated passion as suddenly repented of as committed I heartily agree with Addison  Spectator No  that no part of this incident ought to have been represented but reserved for a narrative with all the alleviating circumstances possible in favour of the hero This is the only method to avoid the difficulties that unqualify this incident for representation a deliberate murder on the one hand and on the other a violent action performed on the stage which must rouse the spectator from his dream of reality  I shall finish with a few words upon the dialogue which ought to be so conducted as to be a true representation of nature I  talk not here of the sentiments nor of the language for these come under different heads I talk of what properly belongs to dialoguewriting where every single speech short or long ought to arise from what is said by the former speaker and furnish matter for what comes after till the end of the scene In this view the whole speeches from first to last represent so many links all connected together in one regular chain No author ancient or modern possesses the art of dialogue equal to Shakespear Dryden in this particular may justly be placed as his opposite He frequently introduces three or four persons speaking upon the same subject each throwing out his own sentiments separately without regarding what is said by the rest I give for an example the first scene of  Aurenzebe  Sometimes he makes a number club in relating an event not to a stranger supposed ignorant of it but to one another for the sake merely of speaking Of this notable sort of dialogue we have a specimen in the first scene of the first part of the  Conquest of Granada  In the second part of the same tragedy  scene second the King Abenamar and Zulema make their separate observations like so many soliloquies upon the fluctuating temper of the mob It puts one in mind of a pastoral where two shepherds are introduced reciting couplets alternately each in praise of his own mistress as if they were contending for a prize  The bandying sentiments in this manner beside an unnatural air has another bad effect It stays the course of the action because it is not productive of any consequence In Congreve's comedies the action is often suspended to make way for a play of wit But of this more particularly in the chapter immediately following  CHAP XXIII The three Unities  THE first chapter unfolds the pleasure we have in a chain of connected facts In histories of the world of a country of a people this pleasure is but faint because the connections are slight or obscure We find more entertainment in biography where the incidents are connected by their relation to one person who makes a figure and commands our attention But the greatest entertainment of the kind is afforded by the history of a single event supposing it to be interesting The history of one event produceth a more entire connection among the parts than the history of one person In the latter the circumstances are not otherwise connected than by their relation to that person in the  former the circumstances are connected by the strongest of all relations that of cause and effect Thus the circumstances of a single event having a mutual connection extremely intimate form a delightful train we survey with peculiar pleasure a number of facts that give birth to each other and we pass with ease and satisfaction from the first to the last  But this subject merits a more particular discussion When we consider the chain of causes and effects in the material world independent of purpose design or thought we find a train of incidents in succession without beginning middle or end Every thing that happens is both a cause and an effect it is the effect of something that goes before and the cause of one or many things that follow One incident may affect us more another less but all of them great and small are so many links in the universal chain The mind in viewing these incidents cannot rest or settle ultimately upon any one but is carried along in the train without any close  But when the intellectual world is taken under view in conjunction with the material the scene is varied Man acts with deliberation will and choice he acts with a view to some end glory for example or riches or conquest the procuring happiness to individuals or to his country in general and he proposes means and lays schemes to attain the end proposed Here is recognised a capital end or event connected with subordinate events or incidents by the relation of causation In running over a series of subordinate events we cannot rest upon any one because they are presented to us as means only leading to some end But we rest with satisfaction upon the ultimate event because there the purpose the plan the aim of the chief person or persons is completed and brought to a final conclusion This indicates a beginning a middle and an end of what Aristotle calls  an entire action  Poet cap See also cap  The story naturally begins with describing those circumstances which move the distinguished person to form a plan in  order to compass some desired event The prosecution of that plan and the obstructions carry the reader into the heat of action The middle is properly where the action is the most involved and the end is where the event is brought about and the design accomplished  A design or plan thus happily perfected after many obstructions affords wonderful delight to the reader And to produce this delight a principle mentioned above  Chap  mainly contributes a principle that disposes the mind to complete every work commenced and in general to carry every thing to its ultimate conclusion  I have given the foregoing example of a plan laid down and completed because it affords the clearest conception of a beginning a middle and an end in which consists unity of action and indeed stricter unity cannot be imagined than in this case But an action may have unity or a beginning middle and end without so intimate a relation of parts The catastrophe  may be different from what is intended or desired which is frequently the case in our best tragedies The  Aeneid  is an instance of means employ'd to produce a certain event and these means crowned with success The  Iliad  is formed upon a different model It begins with the quarrel betwixt Achilles and Agamemnon it goes on to describe the several effects produced by that cause and ends in a reconciliation Here is unity of action no doubt a beginning a middle and an end it must however be acknowledged that the  Aeneid  is more happy in point of connection The mind hath a propensity to go forward in the chain of history it keeps always in view the expected event and when the incidents or underparts are connected together by their relation to the event the mind runs sweetly and easily along them This pleasure we have in the  Aeneid  But it is not altogether so pleasant as in the  Iliad  to connect effects by their common cause for such connection forces the mind to a continual retrospect looking backward is like walking backward  But Homer's plan is still more imperfect for another reason That the events described are but imperfectly connected with the wrath of Achilles as their cause His wrath did not exert itself in action and the misfortunes of his countrymen were but negatively the effects of his wrath by depriving them of his assistance  If unity of action be a capital beauty in a fable imitative of human affairs a double action must be a capital defect by carrying on together two trains of unconnected objects For the sake of variety we indulge an underplot that contributes to the principal event But two unconnected events are a great deformity and it lessens the deformity but a very little to engage the same actors in both Ariosto is quite licentious in this particular he carries on at the same time a plurality of unconnected stories His only excuse is that his plan is perfectly well adjusted to his subject for every thing in the  Orlando Furioso  is wild and extravagant  To state facts according to the order of time is the most natural and the most  simple method a method however not so essential in an historical fable especially as not to yield to some conspicuous beauties  See chap  If a noted story cold and simple in its first movements be made the subject of an epic poem the reader may be hurried into the heat of action reserving the preliminaries for a conversationpiece if it shall be thought necessary This method at the same time being dramatic hath a peculiar beauty which narration cannot reach  See chap  Romancewriters who give little attention to nature deviate in this particular among many from a just standard They make no difficulty of presenting to the reader without the least preparation unknown persons engaged in some adventure equally unknown In  Cassandra  two personages who afterward are discovered to be the heroes of the story start up completely armed upon the banks of the Euphrates and engage in a single combat  I am sensible that a commencement of this sort is much relished by certain readers disposed to wonder Their curiosity is raised and they are much tickled in its gratification But curiosity is at an end with the first reading because the personages are no longer unknown and therefore at the second reading a commencement so artificial loses all its power even over the vulgar A writer of genius loves to deal in lasting beauties    A play analyzed is a chain of connected facts of which each scene makes a link Each scene accordingly ought to produce some incident relative to the catastrophe or ultimate event by advancing or retarding it If no incident be produced such a scene which may be termed barren ought not to be indulged because it breaks the unity of action A barren scene can never be intitled to a place because the chain is complete without it In the  Old Bachelor  the d scene of act and all that follow to the end of that act are mere conversationpieces without any consequence The th and th scenes act  Double Dealer  the th th th th and th scenes act  Love for Love  are of the same kind Neither is  The Way of the World  entirely guiltless of such scenes It will be no justification that they help to display characters It were better like  Dryden in his  dramatis personae  to describe characters beforehand which would not interrupt the chain of action But a writer of genius has no occasion for such artifice he can display the characters of his personages much more to the life in sentiment and action How successfully is this done by Shakespear in whose works there is not to be found a single barren scene  Upon the whole it appears that all the facts in an historical fable ought to have a mutual connection by their common relation to the grand event or catastrophe And this relation in which the  unity  of action consists is equally essential to epic and dramatic compositions  How far the unities of time and of place are essential is a question of greater intricacy These unities were strictly observed in the Grecian and Roman theatres and they are inculcated by the French and English critics as essential to every dramatic composition In theory these unities are also acknowledged by our best poets though their practice is seldom correspondent they are often forc'd to take liberties which they  pretend not to justify against the practice of the Greeks and Romans and against the solemn decision of their own countrymen But in the course of this inquiry it will be made evident that the example of the ancients ought upon this point to have no weight with us and that our critics are guilty of a mistake in admitting no greater latitude of place and time than was admitted in Greece and Rome  Suffer me only to premise that the unities of place and time are not by the most rigid critics required in a narrative poem In such a composition if it pretend to copy nature these unities would be absurd because real events are seldom confined within narrow limits either of place or of time And yet we can follow history or an historical fable through all its changes with the greatest facility We never once think of measuring the real time by what is taken in reading nor of forming any connection betwixt the place of action and that which we occupy  I am sensible that the drama differs so far from the epic as to admit different rules  It will be observed  "That an historical fable which affords entertainment by reading solely is under no limitation of time or of place more than a genuine history but that a dramatic composition cannot be accurately represented unless it be limited as its representation is to one place and to a few hours and therefore that no fable can be admitted but what has these properties because it would be absurd to compose a piece for representation that cannot be justly represented"  This argument I acknowledge has at least a plausible appearance and yet one is apt to suspect some fallacy considering that no critic however strict has ventured to confine the unities of place and of time within so narrow bounds  Bossu after observing with wonderful critical sagacity that winter is an improper season for an epic poem and night not less improper for tragedy admits however that an epic poem may be spread through the whole summer months and a tragedy through the whole sunshine hours of the longest summerday  Du poeme epique l    chap  At this rate an English tragedy may be longer than a French tragedy and in Nova Zembla the time of a tragedy and of an epic poem may be the same    A view of the Grecian drama and a comparison betwixt it and our own may perhaps help to relieve us from this dilemma If they be differently constructed as shall by and by be made evident it is possible that the foregoing reasoning may not be applicable with equal force to both This is an article that with relation to the present subject has not so far as I know been examined by any writer  All authors agree that the first notion of tragedy in Greece was derived from the hymns in praise of Bacchus which were sung in parts by a chorus Thespis to relieve the singers and for the sake of variety introduced one actor who gave a narrative of the subject and sometimes represented one or other personage Eschylus introducing a second actor formed the dialogue by which the performance became dramatic and the actors were multiplied when the subject represented made it necessary But still the chorus which gave a beginning to tragedy was considered as an essential part of its constitution In the first scene generally are unfolded the preliminary  circumstances that lead to the grand event This scene is by Aristotle termed the  prologue  In the second scene where the action properly begins the chorus is introduced which as originally continues upon the stage during the whole performance Sophocles adheres to this plan religiously Euripides is not altogether so correct In some of his pieces it becomes necessary to remove the chorus But this is seldom done and when done matters are so ordered as that their absence is but momentary The chorus often mix in the dialogue and when the dialogue happens to be suspended the chorus during the interval is employ'd in singing Nor does the removal of the chorus when that unusual step is risked interrupt the representation They never leave the stage of their own accord but at the command of some principal personage who constantly waits their return  Thus the Grecian drama is a continued representation without any interruption a circumstance that merits attention A continued representation without a pause affords  not opportunity to vary the place of action and has withal a very short duration To a representation so confined in place and time the foregoing reasoning is strictly applicable A real or feigned action that is brought to a conclusion after considerable intervals of time and frequent change of place cannot accurately be copied in a representation that admits of no latitude in either Hence it is that the unities of place and of time were or ought to have been strictly observed in the Grecian tragedies This is made necessary by the very constitution of their drama for it is absurd to compose a tragedy that cannot be justly represented  Modern critics who for our drama pretend to establish rules founded on the practice of the Greeks are guilty of an egregious blunder The unities of place and of time so much vaunted were in Greece as we see a matter of necessity not of choice I am now ready to show that if we submit to these fetters it must be from choice not necessity This will be evident upon taking a view of the construction  of our drama which differs widely from that of Greece whether more or less perfect is a separate question which shall be handled afterward By dropping the chorus an opportunity is afforded to split our drama into parts or acts which in the representation are distinguished by intervals of time and during these intervals the stage is totally evacuated and the spectacle suspended This construction qualifies our drama for subjects spread through a wide space both of time and of place The time supposed to pass during the suspension of the representation is not measured by the time of the suspension nor is any connection formed betwixt the box we sit in and the place where things are supposed to be transacted in our absence and by that means many subjects can be justly represented in our theatres for which there was no place in those of ancient Greece This doctrine may be illustrated by comparing a modern play to a set of historical pictures let us suppose them five in number and the resemblance will be complete Each of the pictures resembles an act in one  of our plays There must necessarily be the strictest unity of place and of time in each picture and the same necessity requires these two unities during each act of a play because during an act there is no interruption in the spectacle Now when we view in succession a number of such historical pictures let it be for example the history of Alexander by Le Brun we have no difficulty to conceive that months or years have passed betwixt the subjects exhibited in two different pictures though the interruption is imperceptible in passing our eye from the one to the other We have as little difficulty to conceive a change of place however great In this matter there is truly no difference betwixt five acts of a modern play and five such pictures Where the representation is suspended we can with the greatest facility suppose any length of time or any change of place The spectator it is true may be conscious that the real time and place are not the same with what are employ'd in the representation even including the intervals But this is a work of reflection and by the same reflection  he may also be conscious that Garrick is not King Lear that the playhouse is not Dover cliffs nor the noise he hears thunder and lightning In a word during an interruption of the representation it is not more difficult for a spectator to imagine himself carried from place to place and from one period of time to another than at once when the scene first opens to be carried from London to Rome or from the present time two thousand years back And indeed it must appear ridiculous that a critic who makes no difficulty of supposing candlelight to be sunshine and some painted canvasses a palace or a prison should affect so much difficulty in imagining a latitude of place or of time in the story beyond what is necessary in the representation  There are I acknowledge some effects of great latitude in time that ought never to be indulged in a composition for the theatre Nothing can be more absurd than at the close to exhibit a full grown person who appears a child at the beginning The mind rejects as contrary to all probability  such latitude of time as is requisite for a change so remarkable The greatest change from place to place hath not altogether the same bad effect In the bulk of human affairs place is not material and the mind when occupied with an interesting event is little regardful of minute circumstances These may be varied at will because they scarce make any impression  But though I have thus taken arms to rescue modern poets from the slavish fetters of modern critics I would not be understood to justify liberty without any reserve An unbounded licence with relation to place and time is faulty for a reason that seems to have been overlooked it never fails to break in upon the unity of action In the ordinary course of human affairs single events such as are fit to be represented on the stage are confined to a narrow spot and generally employ no great extent of time We accordingly seldom find strict unity of action in a dramatic composition where any remarkable latitude is indulged in these particulars I must say farther that a composition which employs but one  place and requires not a greater length of time than is necessary for the representation is so far the more perfect because the confining an event within so narrow bounds contributes to the unity of action and also prevents that labour however slight which the mind must undergo in imagining frequent changes of place and many intervals of time But still I must insist that the limitation of place and time which was necessary in the Grecian drama is no rule to us and therefore that though such limitation adds one beauty more to the composition it is at best but a refinement which may justly give place to a thousand beauties more substantial And I may add that it is extremely difficult I was about to say impracticable to contract within the Grecian limits any fable so fruitful of incidents in number and variety as to give full scope to the fluctuation of passion  It may now appear that critics who put the unities of place and of time upon the same footing with the unity of action making them all equally essential have not attended to the nature and construction of the  modern drama If they admit an interrupted representation with which no writer finds fault it is plainly absurd to condemn the greatest advantage it procures us that of representing many interesting subjects excluded from the Grecian stage If there needs must be a reformation why not restore the ancient chorus and the ancient continuity of action There is certainly no medium for to admit an interruption without relaxing from the strict unities of place and of time is in effect to load us with all the inconveniencies of the ancient drama and at the same time to withhold from us its advantages  And therefore the only proper question is whether our model be or be not a real improvement This indeed may justly be called in question and in order to a fair comparative trial some particulars must be premised When a play begins we have no difficulty to enter into the scene of action however distant it be in time or in place We know that the play is a representation only and the imagination with facility accommodates itself to every circumstance Our situation is very different  after we are engaged It is the perfection of representation to hide itself to impose upon the spectator and to produce in him an impression of reality as if he were spectator of a real event  Chap part sect  Any interruption annihilates this impression he is roused out of his waking dream and unhappily restored to his senses So difficult it is to support this impression of reality that much slighter interruptions than the interval betwixt two acts are sufficient to dissolve the charm In the th act of the  Mourning Bride  the three first scenes are in a room of state the fourth in a prison This change is operated by shifting the scene which is done in a trice But however quick the transition may be it is impracticable to impose upon the spectators so far as to make them conceive that they are actually carried from the palace to the prison They immediately reflect that the palace and prison are imaginary and that the whole is a fiction  From these premisses one will be naturally led at first view to declare against  the frequent interruptions in the modern drama It will occur  "That every interruption must have the effect to banish the dream of reality and with it to banish our concern which cannot subsist while we are conscious that all is a fiction and therefore that in the modern drama sufficient time is not afforded for the fluctuation and swelling of passion like what is afforded in the Grecian drama where there is no interruption"  This reasoning it must be owned has a specious appearance but we must not turn fainthearted upon the first repulse let us rally our troops for a second engagement  Considering attentively the ancient drama we find that though the representation is never interrupted the principal action is suspended not less frequently than in the modern drama There are five acts in each and the only difference is that in the former when the action is suspended as it is at the end of every act opportunity is taken of the interval to employ the chorus in singing Hence it appears that  the Grecian continuity of representation cannot have the effect to prolong the impression of reality To banish this impression a suspension of the action while the chorus is employ'd in singing is not less operative than a total suspension both of the representation and action  But to open a larger view I am ready to show that a continued representation without a single pause even in the principal action so far from an advantage would be really an imperfection and that a representation with proper pauses is better calculated for moving the audience and making the strongest impressions Representation cannot very long support an impression of reality when the spirits are exhausted by close attention and by the agitation of passion an uneasiness ensues which never fails to banish the waking dream Now supposing an act to employ as much time as can easily be given with strict attention to any incident a supposition that cannot be far from the truth it follows that the impression of reality would not be prolonged beyond the space of an act even supposing  a continued representation Hence it appears that a continued representation without any pause would be a bad contrivance it would break the attention by overstraining it and produce a total absence of mind In this respect the four pauses have a fine effect By affording to the audience a seasonable respite when the impression of reality is gone and while nothing material is in agitation they relieve the mind from its fatigue and consequently prevent a wandering of thought at the very time possibly of the most interesting scenes  In one article indeed the Grecian model has greatly the advantage its chorus during an interval not only preserves alive the impressions made upon the audience but also prepares their hearts finely for new impressions In our theatres on the contrary the audience at the end of every act are in a manner solicited to withdraw their thoughts from what has been passing and to trifle away the time the best way they can Thus in the intervals betwixt the acts every warm impression is banished and the spectators begin the next act cool and indifferent  as at the commencement of the play Here is a gross malady in our theatrical representations but a malady that luckily is not incurable To revive the Grecian chorus would be to revive the Grecian slavery of place and time But I can figure a detached chorus coinciding with a pause in the representation as the ancient chorus did with a pause in the principal action What objection for example can there lie against music betwixt the acts vocal and instrumental adapted to the subject Such detached chorus beside admitting the same latitude that we enjoy at present as to time and place would have more than one happy effect it would recruit the spirits and it would preserve entire the tone if not the tide of passion The music that comes first ought to accord with the tone of the preceding passion and be gradually varied till it accord with the tone of the passion that is to succeed in the next act The music and the representation would both of them be gainers by their conjunction which will thus appear Music that accords with the present tone  of mind is upon that account doubly agreeable and accordingly though music singly hath not power to raise any passion it tends greatly to support a passion already raised Further music though it cannot of itself raise a passion prepares us for the passion that follows by making chearful tender melancholy or animated impressions music has power to dispose the heart to various passions Of this power the first scene of the  Mourning Bride  is a shining instance without the preparation of soft music in a melancholy strain it would be extremely difficult to enter all at once into Almeria's deep distress In this manner music and representation support each other delightfully the impression made upon the audience by the representation is a fine preparation for the music that succeeds and the impression made by the music is a fine preparation for the representation that succeeds It appears to me clear that by some such contrivance the modern drama may be improved so as to enjoy the advantage of the ancient chorus without its slavish limitation of place and time And as to  music in particular I cannot figure any plan that would tend more to its improvement Composers those for the stage at least would be reduced to the happy necessity of studying and imitating nature instead of indulging according to the present fashion in wild fantastic and unnatural conceits But we must return to our subject and finish the comparison betwixt the ancient and the modern drama  The numberless improprieties forc'd upon the Grecian dramatic poets by the constitution of their drama are of themselves one should think a sufficient reason for preferring that of the moderns even abstracting from the improvement proposed To prepare the reader for this article it must be premised that as in the ancient drama the place of action never varies a place necessarily must be chosen to which every person may have access without any improbability This confines the scene to some open place generally the court or area before a palace which excludes from the Grecian theatre transactions within doors though these commonly are the most  important Such cruel restraint is of itself sufficient to cramp the most pregnant invention and accordingly the Grecian writers in order to preserve unity of place are reduced to woful improprieties In the  Hippolytus  of Euripides  Act sc  Phedra distressed in mind and body is carried without any pretext from her palace to the place of action is there laid upon a couch unable to support herself upon her limbs and made to utter many things improper to be heard by a number of women who form the chorus What is still worse her female attendant uses the strongest intreaties to make her reveal the secret cause of her anguish which at last Phedra contrary to decency and probability is prevailed upon to do in presence of this very chorus  Act sc  Alcestes in  Euripides  at the point of death is brought from the palace to the place of action groaning and lamenting her untimely fate  Act sc  In the  Trachiniens  of Sophocles  Act  a secret is imparted to Dejanira the wife  of Hercules in presence of the chorus In the tragedy of  Iphigenia  the messenger employ'd to carry Clitemnestra the news that Iphigenia was sacrificed stops short at the place of action and with a loud voice calls the Queen from her palace to hear the news Again in the  Iphigenia in Tauris  the necessary presence of the chorus forces Euripides into a gross absurdity which is to form a secret plot in their hearing  Act at the close  and to disguise the absurdity much courtship is bestowed on the chorus not one woman but a number to engage them to secrecy In the  Medea  of Euripides that princess makes no difficulty in presence of the chorus to plot the death of her husband of his mistress and of her father the King of Corinth all by poison It was necessary to bring Medea upon the stage and there is but one place of action which is always occupied by the chorus This scene closes the second act and in the end of the third she frankly makes the chorus her confidents in ploting the murder of her own  children Terence by identity of place is often forc'd to make a conversation within doors be heard on the open street the cries of a woman in labour are there heard distinctly  The Grecian poets are not more happy with respect to time than with respect to place In the  Hippolytus  of Euripides that prince is banished at the end of the fourth act In the first scene of the following act a messenger relates to Theseus the whole particulars of the death of Hippolytus by the seamonster This remarkable event must have employ'd many hours and yet in the representation it is confined to the time employ'd by the chorus upon the song at the end of the th act The inconsistency is still greater in the  Iphigenia in Tauris  Act sc  The song could not exhaust half an hour and yet the incidents supposed to have happened in that time could not naturally be transacted in less than half a day  The Grecian artists are not less frequently obliged to transgress another rule derived  also from a continued representation which is that the place of action must constantly be occupied for the very least vacuity is an interruption of the representation Sophocles with regard to this rule as well as others is generally correct But Euripides cannot bear such restraint he often evacuates the stage and leaves it empty for others in succession  Iphigenia in Tauris  after pronouncing a soliloquy in the first scene leaves the place of action and is succeeded by Orestes and Pylades They after some conversation walk off and Iphigenia reenters accompanied with the chorus In the  Alcestes  which is of the same author the place of action is void at the end of the third act It is true that to cover this irregularity and to preserve the representation in motion Euripides is extremely careful to fill the stage without loss of time But this is still an interruption and a link of the chain broken for during the change of the actors there must always be a space of time when we cannot justly say that the stage is occupied by either set It makes indeed a more remarkable interruption  to change the place of action as well as the actors but that was not practicable upon the Grecian stage  It is hard to say upon what model Terence has formed his plays Having no chorus there is a cessation in the representation at the end of every act But advantage is not taken of this cessation even to vary the place of action The street is always chosen where every thing passing may be seen by every person and by this choice the most sprightly and interesting parts of the action which commonly pass within doors are excluded witness the last act of the  Eunuch  He hath submitted to the same slavery with respect to time In a word a play with a regular chorus is not more confined in place and time than his plays are Thus a zealous sectary follows implicitly ancient forms and ceremonies without once considering whether their introductive cause be still subsisting Plautus of a bolder genius than Terence makes good use of the liberty afforded by an interrupted representation he varies the place of action upon all occasions when the variation suits his purpose  The intelligent reader will by this time understand that I plead for no change of place in our plays but after an interval nor for any latitude in point of time but what falls in with an interval The unities of place and time ought to be strictly observed during each act for during the representation there is no opportunity for the smallest deviation from either Hence it is an essential requisite that during an act the stage be always occupied for even a momentary vacuity makes an interval Another rule is not less essential it would be a gross breach of the unity of action to exhibit upon the stage two separate actions at the same time and therefore to preserve this unity it is necessary that each personage introduced during an act be linked to those in possession of the stage so as to join all in one action These things follow from the very conception of an act which admits not the slightest interruption The moment the representation is intermitted there is an end of that act and we have no other notion of a new act but where after a pause or interval the representation  is again put in motion French writers generally speaking are extremely correct in this particular the English on the contrary are so irregular as scarce to deserve a criticism actors not only succeed each other in the same place without connection but what is still worse they frequently succeed each other in different places This change of place in the same act ought never to be indulged for beside breaking the unity of the act it has a disagreeable effect After an interval the mind can readily accommodate itself to any place that is necessary just as readily as at the commencement of the play but during the representation the mind rejects change of place From the foregoing censure must be excepted the  Mourning Bride  of Congreve where regularity concurs with the beauty of sentiment and of language to make it one of the most complete pieces England has to boast of I must acknowledge however that in point of regularity this elegant performance is not altogether unexceptionable In the four first acts the unities of place and time are strictly observed  but in the last act there is a capital error with respect to unity of place In the three first scenes of that act the place of action is a room of state which is changed to a prison in the fourth scene the chain of the actors withal is broken for the persons introduced in the prison are different from those who made their appearance in the room of state This remarkable interruption of the representation makes in effect two acts instead of one and therefore if it be a rule that a play ought not to consist of more acts than five this performance is so far defective in point of regularity I may add that even admitting six acts the irregularity would not be altogether removed without a longer pause in the representation than is allowed in the acting for it requires more than a momentary interruption to enable the imagination readily to accommodate itself to a new place or to prorogation of time In  The Way of the World  of the same author unity of place is preserved during every act and a stricter unity of time during the whole play than is necessary  CHAP XXIV Gardening and Architecture  THE books that have been composed upon architecture and upon embellishing ground abound in practical instruction necessary for a mechanic but in vain would we rummage them for rational principles to improve our taste In a general system it might be thought sufficient to have unfolded the principles that govern these and other fine arts leaving the application to the reader but as I would neglect no opportunity of illustrating these principles I propose to give a specimen of their application to gardening and architecture being favourite arts though I profess no peculiar skill in either  Gardening was at first an useful art in the garden of Alcinoous described by Homer we find nothing done for pleasure  merely But gardening is now improved into a fine art and when we talk of a garden without any epithet a pleasure garden by way of eminence is understood The garden of Alcinoous in modern language was but a kitchengarden Architecture has run the same course It continued many ages an useful art merely before it aspired to be classed with the fine arts Architecture therefore and gardening must be handled in a twofold view as being useful arts as well as fine arts The reader however will not here expect rules for improving any work of art in point of utility It is no part of my plan to treat of any useful art as such But there is a beauty in utility and in discoursing of beauty that of utility ought not to be neglected This leads us to consider gardens and buildings in different views they may be destined for use solely for beauty solely or for both Such variety in the destination bestows upon gardening and architecture a great command of beauties complex not less than various which makes it difficult to form an accurate taste in these arts And hence  that difference and wavering of taste which is more remarkable here than in any art that has but a single destination  Architecture and gardening cannot otherwise entertain the mind than by raising certain agreeable emotions or feelings and before we descend to particulars these arts shall be presented in a general view by showing what are the emotions or feelings that can be raised by them Poetry as to its power of raising emotions possesses justly the first place among the fine arts for scarce one emotion of human nature is beyond its reach Painting and sculpture are more circumscribed having the command of no emotions but what are produced by sight They are peculiarly successful in expressing painful passions which are display'd by external signs extremely legible  See chap  Gardening beside the emotions of beauty by means of regularity order proportion colour and utility can raise emotions of grandeur of sweetness of gaiety melancholy wildness and even of surprise or  wonder In architecture regularity order and proportion and the beauties that result from them are still more conspicuous than in gardening But with respect to the beauty of colour architecture is far inferior Grandeur can be expressed in a building perhaps more successfully than in a garden but as to the other emotions above mentioned architecture hitherto has not been brought to the perfection of expressing them distinctly To balance this defect architecture can display the beauty of utility in the highest perfection  But gardening possesses one advantage which never can be equalled in the other art A garden may be so contrived as in various scenes to raise successively all its different emotions But to operate this delicious effect the garden must be extensive so as to admit a slow succession for a small garden comprehended at one view ought to be confined to one expression  See chap  it may be gay it may be sweet it may be gloomy but an attempt to mix these would create  a jumble of emotions not a little unpleasant For the same reason a building even the most magnificent is necessarily confined to one expression  Architecture considered as a fine art instead of rivaling gardening in its progress toward perfection seems not far advanced beyond its infantstate To bring it to maturity two things mainly are wanted First A greater variety of parts and ornaments than it seems provided with Gardening here has greatly the advantage it is provided with such plenty and such variety of materials that it must be the fault of the artists if the spectator be not entertained with different scenes and affected with various emotions But materials in architecture are so scanty that artists hitherto have not been successful in raising emotions other than those of beauty and grandeur With respect to the former there are indeed plenty of means regularity order symmetry simplicity and with respect to the latter the addition of size is sufficient But though it be evident that every building ought to have a certain character or expression  suitable to its destination yet this is a refinement which artists have scarce ventured upon A death's head and bones employ'd in monumental buildings will indeed produce an emotion of gloom and melancholy but every ornament of this kind if these can be termed so ought to be rejected because they are in themselves disagreeable The other thing wanted to bring the art to perfection is to ascertain the precise impression made by every single part and ornament cupolas spires columns carvings statues vases  c  For in vain will an artist attempt rules for employing these either singly or in combination until the different emotions or feelings they produce be distinctly explained Gardening in this particular hath also the advantage The several emotions raised by trees rivers cascades plains eminences and other materials it employs are understood and the nature of each can be described with some degree of precision which is done occasionally in the foregoing parts of this work  In gardening as well as in architecture simplicity ought to be the governing taste Profuse ornament hath no better effect than to confound the eye and to prevent the object from making an impression as one entire whole An artist destitute of genius for capital beauties is naturally prompted to supply the defect by crowding his plan with slight embellishments Hence in gardens triumphal arches Chinese houses temples obelisks cascades fountains without end and hence in buildings pillars vases statues and a profusion of carved work Thus a woman who has no just taste is apt to overcharge every part of her dress with ornament Superfluity of decoration hath another bad effect it gives the object a diminutive look An island in a wide extended lake makes it appear larger but an artificial lake which must always be little appears still less by making an island in it  See appendix to part chap    In forming plans for embellishing a field an artist void of taste deals in straight lines  circles squares because these show best upon paper He perceives not that to humour and adorn nature is the perfection of his art and that nature neglecting regularity reacheth superior beauties by distributing her objects in great variety with a bold hand A large field laid out with strict regularity is stiff and artificial Nature indeed in organized bodies comprehended under one view studies regularity which for the same reason ought to be studied in architecture but in large objects which cannot otherwise be surveyed than in parts and by succession regularity and uniformity would be useless properties because they cannot be discovered by the eye  A square field appears not such to the eye when viewed from any part of it and the centre is the only place where a circular field preserves in appearance its real figure  Nature therefore in her large works neglects these properties and in copying nature the artist ought to neglect them  Having thus far carried on a comparison betwixt gardening and architecture I proceed to rules peculiar to each and I begin  with gardening The simplest idea of a garden is that of a spot embellished with a number of natural objects trees walks polish'd parterres flowers streams  c  One more complex comprehends statues and buildings that nature and art may be mutually ornamental A third approaching nearer perfection is of objects assembled together in order to produce not only an emotion of beauty essential to gardens of every kind but also some other particular emotion grandeur for example gaiety or any other of those above mentioned The most perfect idea of a garden is an improvement upon the third requiring the adjustment of the several parts in such a manner as to inspire all the different emotions that can be raised by gardening In this idea of a garden the arrangement is an important circumstance for it has been shown that some emotions figure best in conjunction and that others ought always to appear in succession and never in conjunction I have had occasion to observe above  Chap  that when the most opposite emotions  such as gloominess and gaiety stillness and activity follow each other in succession the pleasure on the whole will be the greatest but that opposite or dissimilar emotions ought not to be united because they produce an unpleasant mixture  Chap part  For that reason a ruin affording a sort of melancholy pleasure ought not to be seen from a flowerparterre which is gay and chearful But to pass immediately from an exhilerating object to a ruin has a glorious effect for each of the emotions is the more sensibly felt by being contrasted with the other Similar emotions on the other hand such as gaiety and sweetness stillness and gloominess motion and grandeur ought to be raised together for their effects upon the mind are greatly heightened by their conjunction  See the place immediately above cited    Kent's method of embellishing a field is admirable It is painting a field with beautiful objects natural and artificial disposed like colours upon a canvas It requires indeed more genius to paint in the  gardening way In forming a landscape upon a canvas no more is required but to adjust the figures to each other an artist who lays out ground in Kent's manner has an additional task which is to adjust his figures to the several varieties of the field  One garden must be distinguished from a plurality and yet it is not obvious wherein the unity of a garden consists A notion of unity is indeed suggested from viewing a garden surrounding a palace with views from each window and walks leading to every corner But there may be a garden without a house In this case I must pronounce that what makes it one garden is the unity of design every single spot appearing part of a whole The gardens of Versailles properly expressed in the plural number being no fewer than sixteen are indeed all of them connected with the palace but have scarce any mutual connection they appear not like parts of one whole but rather like small gardens in contiguity Were these gardens at some distance from each other they would have a better effect Their junction breeds confusion  of ideas and upon the whole gives less pleasure than would be felt in a slower succession  Regularity is required in that part of a garden which joins the dwellinghouse for being considered as a more immediate accessory it ought to partake the regularity of the principal object  The influence of this connection surpassing all bounds is visible in many gardens left in their original form of horizontal plains forc'd with great labour and expence perpendicular faces of earth supported with massy stone walls terracewalks in stages one above another regular ponds and canals without the least motion and the whole surrounded like a prison with high walls excluding every external object At first view it may puzzle one to account for a taste running cross to nature in every particular But nothing happens without a cause Perfect regularity and uniformity are required in a house and this idea is extended to its accessory the garden especially if it be a small spot incapable of grandeur or much variety The house is regular so must the garden be the floors of the house are horizontal and the garden must have the same position in the house we are protected from every intruding eye so must we be in the garden This it must be confessed is carrying the notion of resemblance very far But where reason and taste are laid asleep nothing is more common than to carry resemblance beyond proper bounds  But in proportion to the distance from the house considered as  the centre regularity ought less and less to be studied In an extensive plan it hath a fine effect to lead the mind insensibly from regularity to a bold variety giving an impression of grandeur And grandeur ought to be studied as much as possible even in a more confined plan by avoiding a multiplicity of small parts  See chap  Nothing contributes more to grandeur than a right disposition of trees Let them be scattered extremely thin near the dwellinghouse and thickened in proportion to their distance distant eminences to be filled with trees and laid open to view A small garden on the other hand which admits not grandeur ought to be strictly regular  Milton describing the garden of Eden prefers justly the grand taste to that of regularity  Flowers worthy of paradise which not nice art  In beds and curious knots but Nature boon  Pour'd forth profuse on hill and dale and plain  Both where the morning sun first warmly smote  The open field and where the unpierc'd shade  Imbrown'd the noontidebow'rs  Paradise Lost b  In the manner of planting a wood or thicket much art may be display'd A common centre of walks termed  a star  from whence are seen a number of remarkable objects appears too artificial to be agreeable The crowding withal so many objects together lessens the pleasure that would be felt in a slower succession Abandoning therefore the star being stiff and formal let us try to substitute some form more natural that will lay open all the remarkable objects in the neighbourhood This may be done by openings in the wood at various distances which in walking bring successively under the eye every object as by accident Some openings display single objects some a plurality in a line and some a rapid succession of them In this plan the mind at intervals is roused and cheared by agreeable objects and the scene is greatly heightened by the surprise it occasions when we stumble  as it were upon objects of which we had no expectation  As gardening is not an inventive art but an imitation of nature or rather nature itself ornamented it follows necessarily that every thing unnatural ought to be rejected with disdain Statues of wild beasts vomiting water a common ornament in gardens prevails in those of Versailles Is this ornament in a good taste A  jet d'eau  being purely artificial may without disgust be tortured into a thousand shapes but a representation of what really exists in nature admits not any unnatural circumstance These statues therefore in the gardens of Versailles must be condemned and yet so insensible has the artist been to just imitation as to have display'd his vicious taste without the least colour or disguise A lifeless statue of an animal pouring out water may be endured without much disgust But here the lions and wolves are put in violent action each has seized its prey a deer or a lamb in act to devour And yet instead of extended claws and open mouth the whole as by a hocuspocus trick is converted  into a different scene the lion forgetting his prey pours out water plentifully and the deer forgetting its danger performs the same operation a representation not less absurd than that in the opera where Alexander the Great after mounting the wall of a town besieged turns about and entertains his army with a song  In gardening every lively exhibition of what is beautiful in nature has a fine effect on the other hand distant and faint imitations are displeasing to every one of taste The cutting evergreens in the shape of animals is a very ancient practice as appears from the epistles of Pliny who seems to be a great admirer of this puerile conceit The propensity to imitation gave birth to this practice and has supported it wonderfully long considering how faint and insipid the imitation is But the vulgar great and small devoid of taste are entertained with the oddness and singularity of a resemblance however distant betwixt a tree and an animal An attempt in the gardens of Versailles to imitate  a grove of trees by a group of  jets d'eau  appears for the same reason not less ridiculous  In laying out a garden every thing trivial or whimsical ought to be avoided Is a labyrinth then to be justified It is a mere conceit like that of composing verses in the shape of an axe or an egg The walks and hedges may be agreeable but in the form of a labyrinth they serve to no end but to puzzle A riddle is a conceit not so mean because the solution is a proof of sagacity which affords no aid in tracing a labyrinth  The gardens of Versailles executed with infinite expence by men at that time in high repute are a lasting monument of a taste the most vicious and depraved The faults above mentioned instead of being avoided are chosen as beauties and multiplied without end Nature it would seem was deemed too vulgar to be imitated in the works of a magnificent monarch and for that reason preference was given to things unnatural which probably were mistaken for supernatural I have often amused  myself with a fanciful resemblance betwixt these gardens and the Arabian tales Each of them is a performance intended for the amusement of a great king in the sixteen gardens of Versailles there is no unity of design more than in the thousand and one Arabian tales and lastly they are equally unnatural groves of  jets d'eau  statues of animals conversing in the manner of Aesop water issuing out of the mouths of wild beasts give an impression of fairyland and witchcraft not less than diamondpalaces invisible rings spells and incantations  A straight road is the most agreeable because it shortens the journey But in an embellished field a straight walk has an air of stiffness and confinement and at any rate is less agreeable than a winding or waving walk for in surveying the beauties of a fine field we love to roam from place to place at freedom Winding walks have another advantage at every step they open new views In short the walks in a field intended for entertainment ought not to have any appearance of a road My intention  is not to make a journey but to feast my eye with the beauties of art and nature This rule excludes not long straight openings terminating upon distant objects These beside variety never fail to raise an emotion of grandeur by extending in appearance the size of the field An opening without a terminating object soon closes upon the eye but an object at whatever distance continues the opening and deludes the spectator into a conviction that the trees which confine the view are continued till they join the object Straight walks also in recesses do extremely well they vary the scenery and are favourable to meditation  An avenue ought not to be directed in a straight line upon a dwellinghouse better far an oblique approach in a waving line with single trees and other scattered objects interposed In a direct approach the first appearance continues the same to the end we see a house at a distance and we see it all along in the same spot without any variety In an oblique approach the intervening objects put the house seemingly  in motion it moves with the passenger and appears to direct its course so as hospitably to intercept him An oblique approach contributes also to variety the house being seen successively in different directions takes on at every step a new figure  A garden on a flat ought to be highly and variously ornamented in order to occupy the mind and prevent its regretting the insipidity of an uniform plain Artificial mounts in this view are common but no person has thought of an artificial walk elevated high above the plain Such a walk is airy and tends to elevate the mind it extends and varies the prospect and it makes the plain seen from a height appear more agreeable  Whether should a ruin be in the Gothic or Grecian form In the former I say because it exhibits the triumph of time over strength a melancholy but not unpleasant thought A Grecian ruin suggests rather the triumph of barbarity over taste a gloomy and discouraging thought  Fountains are seldom in a good taste Statues of animals vomiting water which  prevail every where stand condemned A statue of a whale spouting water upward from its head would in one sense be natural as whales of a certain species have that power The design however would scarce be relished because its singularity would give it the appearance of being unnatural There is another reason against it that the figure of a whale is in itself not agreeable In the many fountains in and about Rome statues of fishes are frequently employ'd to support a large basin of water This unnatural conceit cannot be otherwise explained than by the connection betwixt water and the fish that swim in it which by the way is a proof of the influence that even the slighter connections have on the mind The only good design for a fountain I have met with is what follows In an artificial rock rugged and abrupt there is a cavity out of sight at the top the water convey'd to it by a pipe pours or trickles down the broken parts of the rock and is collected into a basin at the foot it is so contrived as to make the water fall in sheets or in rills at pleasure  Hitherto a garden has been treated as a work intended solely for pleasure or in other words for giving impressions of intrinsic beauty What comes next in order is the beauty of a garden destined for use termed  relative beauty  See these terms defined chap  and this branch shall be dispatched in a few words In gardening luckily relative beauty need never stand in opposition to intrinsic beauty All the ground that can be requisite for use makes but a small proportion of an ornamented field and may be put in any corner without obstructing the disposition of the capital parts At the same time a kitchengarden or an orchard is susceptible of intrinsic beauty and may be so artfully disposed among the other parts as by variety and contrast to contribute to the beauty of the whole In this respect architecture is far more intricate as will be seen immediately for there it being often requisite to blend intrinsic and relative beauty in the same building it becomes a difficult task to attain both in any perfection  As gardening is brought to greater perfection in China than in any other known country an account of the means practised by Chinese artists to inspire all the various emotions of gardening will be a fine illustration of the foregoing doctrine In general it is an indispensable law with them never to deviate from nature but in order to produce that degree of variety which is pleasing every method is used that is consistent with nature Nature is strictly imitated in the banks of their artificial lakes and rivers which sometimes are bare and gravelly sometimes covered with wood quite to the brink of the water To flat spots adorned with flowers and shrubs are opposed others steep and rocky We see meadows covered with cattle ricegrounds that run into the lakes groves into which enter navigable creeks and rivulets These generally conduct to some interesting object a magnificent building terraces cut in a mountain a cascade a grotto an artificial rock and other such inventions Their artificial rivers are generally serpentine sometimes narrow noisy and rapid sometimes  deep broad and slow and to make the scene still more active mills and other moving machines are often erected In the lakes are interspersed islands some barren surrounded with rocks and shoals others inriched with every thing that art and nature can furnish Even in their cascades they avoid regularity as forcing nature out of its course the waters are seen bursting out from among the caverns and windings of the artificial rocks here an impetuous cataract there many lesser falls and in its passage the water is often impeded by trees and heaps of stones that seem brought down by the violence of the current Straight lines generally avoided are sometimes indulged in order to take the advantage of any interesting object at a distance by directing openings upon it  Sensible of the influence of contrast the Chinese artists deal in sudden transitions and in opposing to each other forms colours and shades The eye is conducted from limited to extensive views and from lakes and rivers to plains hills and woods to dark and gloomy colours are opposed  the more brilliant the different masses of light and shade are disposed in such a manner as to render the composition distinct in its parts and striking on the whole In plantations the trees are artfully mixed according to their shape and colour those of spreading branches with the pyramidal and the light with the deep green They even introduce decay'd trees some erect and some half out of the ground  Taste has suggested to Kent the same artifice The placing a decay'd tree properly contributes to contrast and also produces a sort of pity grounded on an imaginary personification  In order to heighten contrast much bolder strokes are risked They sometimes introduce rough rocks dark caverns trees ill formed and seemingly rent by tempests or blasted by lightning a building in ruins or half consumed by fire But to relieve the mind from the harshness of such objects they are always succeeded by the sweetest and most beautiful scenes  The Chinese study to give play to the imagination They hide the termination of their lakes the view of a cascade is frequently  interrupted by trees through which are seen obscurely the waters as they fall The imagination once roused is disposed to magnify every object  Nothing is more studied in Chinese gardens than to raise wonder or surprise In scenes calculated for that end every thing appears like fairyland a torrent for example convey'd under ground producing an uncommon sound that puzzles a stranger to guess what it may be and to increase our wonder by multiplying such uncommon sounds the rocks and buildings are contrived with cavities and interstices Sometimes one is led insensibly into dark caverns terminating unexpectedly in a landscape inriched with all that nature affords the most delicious At other times beautiful walks insensibly conduct us to a rough uncultivated field where bushes briers and stones interrupt the passage when we look about for an outlet some rich prospect unexpectedly opens to view Another artifice is to obscure some capital part by trees or other interposed objects our curiosity is raised to know what lies beyond and after a few  steps we are greatly surprised with some scene totally different from what was expected  I close these cursory observations upon gardening with a remark that must touch every reader Rough uncultivated ground dismal to the eye inspires peevishness and discontent May not this be one cause of the harsh manners of savages In a field richly ornamented are collected beautiful objects of various kinds Such a field displays in full lustre the goodness of the Deity and the ample provision he has made for our happiness which must fill every spectator with gratitude to his Maker and with benevolence to his fellowcreatures Other fine arts may be perverted to excite irregular and even vicious emotions but gardening which inspires the purest and most refined pleasures cannot but promote every good affection The gaiety and harmony of mind it produceth must naturally incline the spectator to communicate his satisfaction to others by acts of humanity and kindness  Having finished what occurred on gardening I proceed to rules and observations that more peculiarly concern architecture Architecture being an useful as well as a fine art buildings and parts of buildings must be distinguished into three kinds  viz  what are intended for utility solely what for ornament solely and what for both A building intended for utility solely such as detached offices ought in every part to correspond precisely to that intention The least deviation from use though contributing to ornament will be disagreeable For every work of use being considered as a means to an end its perfection as a means is the capital circumstance and every other beauty in opposition is neglected as improper and impertinent In things again intended for ornament such as pillars obelisks triumphal arches beauty solely ought to be regarded A Heathen temple must be considered as merely ornamental for being dedicated to some deity and not intended for habitation it is susceptible of any figure and any embellishment that fancy can suggest and beauty require The great difficulty  of contrivance respects buildings that are intended for pleasure as well as for use These ends employing different and often opposite means are with difficulty reconciled In palaces and other buildings sufficiently extensive to admit a variety of useful contrivance regularity justly takes the lead But in dwellinghouses that are too small for variety of contrivance utility ought to prevail neglecting regularity so far as it stands in opposition to convenience  Intrinsic and relative beauty being founded on different principles must be handled separately and I begin with relative beauty as of the greater importance  The proportions of a door are determined by the use to which it is destined The door of a dwellinghouse which ought to correspond to the human size is confined to seven or eight feet in height and three or four in breadth The proportions proper for the door of a barn or coachhouse are widely different Another consideration enters To study intrinsic beauty in a coachhouse or barn intended merely for use is obviously improper But a dwellinghouse  may admit ornaments and the principal door of a palace demands all the grandeur that is consistent with the foregoing proportions dictated by utility It ought to be elevated and approached by steps and it may be adorned with pillars supporting an architrave or in any other beautiful manner The door of a church ought to be wide in order to afford an easy passage for a multitude The wideness at the same time regulates the height as will appear by and by The size of windows ought to be proportioned to that of the room they serve with light for if the apperture be not sufficiently large to convey light to every corner the room is dark and gloomy Steps of stairs ought to be accommodated to the human figure without regarding any other proportion these steps accordingly are the same in large and in small buildings because both are inhabited by men of the same size  I proceed to consider intrinsic beauty blended with that which is relative A cube in itself is more agreeable than a parallelopipedon which will constantly hold in small  figures But a large building in the form a cube appears lumpish and heavy while the other figure set on its smaller base is by its elevation more agreeable and hence the beauty of a Gothic tower But let us suppose this parallelopipedon destin'd for a dwellinghouse to make way for relative beauty Here utility prevails over elevation and a parallelopipedon inconvenient by its height is set upon its larger base The loftiness is gone but that loss is more than compensated by additional convenience and for that reason the form of a building spread more upon the ground than raised in height is always preferred for a dwellinghouse without excepting even the most sumptuous palace  With respect to the divisions within utility requires that the rooms be rectangular for otherwise void spaces will be left of no use A hexagonal figure leaves no void spaces but then it determines the rooms to be all of one size which is extremely inconvenient A cube will at first be pronounced the most agreeable figure and this may hold in a room of a moderate size  But in a very large room utility requires a different figure The chief convenience of a great room is unconfined motion This directs us to the greatest length that can be obtained But a square room of a great size is inconvenient by removing far from the hand chairs and tables which when unemploy'd must be ranged along the sides of the room Utility therefore requires a large room to be a parallelogram This figure at the same time is the best calculated for receiving light because to avoid crosslight all the windows ought to be in one wall and if the opposite wall be at such distance as not to be fully lighted the room must be obscure The height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet has little or no relation to utility and therefore proportion is the only rule for determining the height when above that number of feet  As all artists who deal in the beautiful are naturally prone to entertain the eye they have great opportunity to exert their taste upon palaces and sumptuous buildings where as above observed intrinsic beauty ought to have the ascendant over that which  is relative But such propensity is unhappy with respect to private dwellinghouses because in these relative beauty cannot be display'd in any perfection without abandoning intrinsic beauty There is no opportunity for great variety of form in a small house and in an edifice of this kind internal convenience has not hitherto been happily adjusted to external regularity I am apt to believe that an accurate coincidence here is beyond the reach of art And yet architects always split upon this rock for they never will give over attempting to reconcile these two incompatibles How else should it be accounted for that of the endless variety of private dwellinghouses there is not one to be found that is generally agreed upon as a good pattern The unwearied propensity to make a house regular as well as convenient forces the architect in some articles to sacrifice convenience to regularity and in others regularity to convenience By this means the house which turns out neither regular nor convenient never fails to displease The faults are obvious  and the difficulty of doing better is known to the artist only  "Houses are built to live in and not to look on Therefore let use be preferred before uniformity except where both may be had"  Lo Verulam essay    Nothing can be more evident than that the form of a dwellinghouse ought to be suited to the climate and yet no error is more common than to copy in Britain the form of Italian houses not forgetting even those parts that are purposely contrived for air and for excluding the sun I shall give one or two instances A colonnade along the front of a building hath a fine effect in Greece and Italy by producing coolness and obscurity agreeable properties in warm and luminous climates The cold climate of Britain is altogether averse to this ornament A colonnade therefore can never be proper in this country unless when employ'd to communicate with a detached building Again a logio opening the house to the north contrived in Italy for gathering cool air is if possible still more improper for this climate Scarce endurable in summer it in  winter exposes the house to the bitter blasts of the north and to every shower of snow and rain  Having discussed what appeared necessary to be said upon relative beauty singly considered or in combination with intrinsic beauty the next step is to view architecture as one of the fine arts and to examine those buildings and parts of buildings that are solely calculated to please the eye In the works of nature grand and magnificent variety prevails The timid hand of art is guided by rule and compass Hence it is that in works which imitate nature the great art is to hide every appearance of art which is done by avoiding regularity and indulging variety But in works of art that are original and not imitative such as architecture strict regularity and uniformity ought to be studied so far as consistent with utility  In buildings intended to please the eye proportion is not less essential than regularity and uniformity for we are so framed by nature as to be pleased equally with each of these By many writers it is taken for granted that in all the parts of a building  there are certain strict proportions which please the eye precisely as there are certain strict proportions of sound which please the ear and that in both the slightest deviation is equally disagreeable Others again seem to relish more a comparison betwixt proportion in numbers and proportion in quantity and hold that the same proportions are agreeable in both The proportions for example of the numbers and are agreeable and so say they are the proportions of a room the height of which is feet the breadth and the length This point with relation to the present subject being of importance the reader will examine it with attention and impartiality To refute the notion of a resemblance betwixt musical proportions and those of architecture it might be sufficient to observe in general that the one is addressed to the ear the other to the eye and that objects of different senses have no resemblance nor indeed any relation to each other But more particularly what pleases the ear in harmony is not the proportion of the strings of the instrument but of the sounds that  these strings produce In architecture on the contrary it is the proportion of different quantities that pleases the eye without the least relation to sound Beside were quantity here to be the sole ground of comparison we have no reason to presume that there is any natural analogy betwixt the proportions that please in a building and the proportions of strings that produce concordant sounds I instance in particular an octave the most complete of all concords An octave is produced by two strings of the same tension and diameter and as to length in the proportion of one to two I do not know that this proportion will be agreeable in any two parts of a building I add that concordant notes are produced by wind instruments which as to proportion appear not to have even the slightest resemblance to a building  With respect to the other notion instituting a comparison betwixt proportion in numbers and proportion in quantity I urge that number and quantity are so distinct from each other as to afford no probability of any natural relation betwixt them Quantity  is a real quality of every substance or body number is not a real quality but merely a conception that arises upon viewing a plurality of things in succession Because an arithmetical proportion is agreeable in numbers have we any reason to conclude that it must also be agreeable in quantity At this rate a geometrical proportion and many others ought also to be agreeable in both A certain proportion may coincide in both and among an endless variety of proportions it would be wonderful if there never should be a coincidence One example is given of this coincidence in the numbers and but to be convinced that it is merely accidental we need but reflect that the same proportions are not applicable to the external figure of a house and far less to a column  That we are framed by nature to relish proportion as well as regularity is indisputable but that agreeable proportion like concord in sounds is confined to certain precise measures is not warranted by experience on the contrary we learn from experience that various proportions are equally  agreeable that proportion is never tied down to precise measures but admits more and less and that we are not sensible of disproportion till the difference betwixt the quantities compared become the most striking circumstance Columns evidently admit different proportions equally agreeable The case is the same in houses rooms and other parts of a building And this opens an interesting reflection The foregoing difference betwixt concord and proportion is an additional instance of that admirable harmony which subsists among the several branches of the human frame The ear is an accurate judge of sounds and of their smallest differences and that concord in sounds should be regulated by accurate measures is perfectly well suited to this accuracy of perception The eye is more uncertain about the size of a large object than of one that is small and in different situations the same object appears of different sizes Delicacy of feeling therefore with respect to proportion in quantities would be an useless quality It is much better ordered that there should be such a latitude with  respect to agreeable proportions as to correspond to the uncertainty of the eye with respect to quantity  But this scene is too interesting to be passed over in a cursory view all its beauties are not yet display'd I proceed to observe that to make the eye as delicate with respect to proportion as the ear is with respect to concord would not only be an useless quality but be the source of continual pain and uneasiness I need go no farther for a proof than the very room I possess at present every step I take varies to me in appearance the proportion of the length and breadth At that rate I should not be happy but in one precise spot where the proportion appears agreeable Let me further observe that it would be singular indeed to find in the nature of man any two principles in perpetual opposition to each other This would precisely be the case if proportion were circumscribed like concord for it would exclude all but one of those proportions that utility requires in different buildings and in different parts of the same building  It is ludicrous to observe all writers acknowledging the necessity of accurate proportions and yet differing widely about them Laying afide reasoning and philosophy one fact universally agreed on ought to have undeceived them that the same proportions which please in a model are not agreeable in a large building A room feet in length and in breadth and height is well proportioned but a room feet wide and high and long looks like a gallery  Perrault in his comparison of the ancients and moderns  p  is the only author who runs to the opposite extreme maintaining that the different proportions assigned to each order of columns are arbitrary and that the beauty of these proportions is entirely the effect of custom This bewrays ignorance of human nature which evidently delights in proportion as well as in regularity order and propriety But without any acquaintance with human nature a single reflection might have convinced him  of his error that if these proportions had not originally been agreeable they could not have been established by custom If a thing be universal it must be natural  To illustrate the present point I shall add a few examples of the agreeableness of different proportions In a sumptuous edifice the capital rooms ought to be large for otherwise they will not be proportioned to the size of the building On the other hand a very large room in a small house is disproportioned But in things thus related the mind requires not a precise or single proportion rejecting all others on the contrary many different proportions are made equally welcome It is only when a proportion becomes loose and distant that the agreeableness abates and at last vanisheth In all buildings accordingly we find rooms of different proportions equally agreeable even where the proportion is not influenced by utility With respect to the height of a room the proportion it ought to bear to the length and breadth is extremely arbitrary and it cannot be otherwise considering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a  room when it exceeds or feet In columns again even architects must confess that the proportion of height and thickness varies betwixt diameters and and that every proportion betwixt these two extremes is agreeable But this is not all There must certainly be a further variation of proportion depending on the size of the column A row of columns feet high and a row twice that height require different proportions The intercolumniations must also differ in proportion according to the height of the row  Proportion of parts is not only itself a beauty but is inseparably connected with a beauty of the first magnitude Parts that in conjunction appear proportional never fail separately to produce similar emotions which existing together are extremely pleasant as I have had occasion to show  Chap part  Thus a room of which the parts are all finely adjusted to each other strikes us with the beauty of proportion It produceth at the same time a pleasure far superior The  length the breadth the height the windows raise each of them separately an emotion These emotions are similar and though faint when felt separately they produce in conjunction the emotion of concord or harmony which is extremely pleasant On the other hand where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth the mind comparing together parts so intimately connected immediately perceives a disagreement or disproportion which disgusts But this is not all Viewing them separately different emotions are produced that of grandeur from the great length and that of meanness or littleness from the small breadth which in union are disagreeable by their discordance Hence it is that a long gallery however convenient for exercise is not an agreeable figure of a room We consider it like a stable as destined for use and expect not that in any other respect it should be agreeable  Regularity and proportion are essential in buildings destined chiefly or solely to please the eye because they are the means to produce intrinsic beauty But a skilful artist  will not confine his view to regularity and proportion He will also study propriety which is perceived when the form and ornaments of a structure are suited to the purpose for which it is appointed The sense of propriety dictates the following rule That every building ought to have an expression corresponding to its destination A palace ought to be sumptuous and grand a private dwelling neat and modest a playhouse gay and splendid and a monument gloomy and melancholy A Heathen temple has a double destination it is considered chiefly as a house dedicated to some divinity and in that respect it ought to be grand elevated and magnificent it is considered also as a place of worship and in that respect it ought to be somewhat dark or gloomy because dimness produces that tone of mind which is suited to humility and devotion A Christian church is not considered as a house for the Deity but merely a place of worship it ought therefore to be decent and plain without much ornament a situation ought to be chosen humble and retired because the congregation during  worship ought to be humble and disengaged from the world Columns beside their chief destination of being supports contribute to that peculiar expression which the destination of a building requires columns of different proportions serve to express loftiness lightness  c  as well as strength Situation also may contribute to expression conveniency regulates the situation of a private dwellinghouse but as I have had occasion to observe  Chap  the situation of a palace ought to be lofty  And this leads me to examine whether the situation of a great house where the artist is limited in his choice ought in any measure to regulate its form The connection betwixt a great house and the neighbouring grounds though not extremely intimate demands however some congruity It would for instance displease us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country congruity requires a polished field for such a building and beside the pleasure of congruity the spectator  is sensible of the pleasure of concordance from the similarity of the emotions produced by the two objects The old Gothic form of building seems well suited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was invented The only mistake was the transferring this form to the fine plains of France and Italy better fitted for buildings in the Grecian taste But by refining upon the Gothic form every thing in the power of invention has been done to reconcile it to its new situation The profuse variety of wild and grand objects about Inverary demanded a house in the Gothic form and every one must approve the taste of the proprietor in adjusting so finely as he has done the appearance of his house to that of the country where it is placed  The external structure of a great house leads naturally to its internal structure A large and spacious room receives us commonly upon our entrance This seems to me a bad contrivance in several respects In the first place when immediately from the open air we step into such a room its size in appearance is diminished by contrast it  looks little compared with the great canopy the sky In the next place when it recovers its grandeur as it soon doth it gives a diminutive appearance to the rest of the house passing from it every apartment looks little This room therefore may be aptly compared to the swoln commencement of an epic poem  Bella per Emathios plusquam civilia campos  In the third place by its situation it serves only for a waitingroom and a passage to the principal apartments And yet undoubtedly the room of the greatest size ought to be reserved for company A great room which enlarges the mind and gives a certain elevation to the spirits is destined by nature for conversation Rejecting therefore this form I take a hint from the climax in writing for another form that appears more suitable My plan is first a handsome portico proportioned to the size and fashion of the front this portico leads into a waitingroom of a larger size and this again to the great  room all by a progression from small to great If the house be very large there may be space for the following suit of rooms first a portico second a passage within the house bounded by rows of columns on each side connected by arcades third an octagon room or of any other figure about the centre of the building and lastly the great room  Of all the emotions that can be raised by architecture grandeur is that which has the greatest influence on the mind It ought therefore to be the chief study of the artist to raise this emotion in great buildings But it seems unhappy for architecture that it is necessarily governed by certain principles opposite to grandeur the direct effect of regularity and proportion is to make a building appear less than it is in reality Any invention to reconcile these with grandeur would be a capital improvement in architecture  Next of ornaments which contribute greatly to give buildings a peculiar expression It has been a doubt with me whether a building can regularly admit any ornament  but what is useful or at least appears to be useful But considering the double aim of architecture a fine as well as an useful art there is no good reason why ornaments may not be added to please the eye without any relation to use This liberty is allowed in poetry painting and gardening and why not in architecture considered as a fine art A private dwellinghouse it is true and other edifices where use is the chief aim admit not regularly any ornament but what has the appearance at least of use but temples triumphal arches and other buildings intended chiefly or solely for show may be highly ornamented  This suggests a division of ornaments into three kinds  viz  ornaments that are beautiful without relation to use such as statues in niches vases basso or alto relievo next things in themselves not beautiful but possessing the beauty of utility by imposing on the spectator and appearing to be of use blind windows for example the third kind is where the thing is in itself beautiful and also takes on the appearance  of use the case of a pilaster With respect to the second it is an egregious blunder to contrive the ornament so as to make it appear useless If a blind window therefore be necessary for regularity it ought to be so disguised as not to be distinguished from the real windows If it appear to be a blind window it is disgustful as a vain attempt to supply the want of invention It shows the irregularity in a stronger light by signifying that a window ought to be there in point of regularity but that the architect had not skill sufficient to connect external regularity with internal convenience  From ornaments in general we descend to a pillar the chief ornament in great buildings The destination of a pillar is to support really or in appearance another part termed  the architrave  With respect to the form of this ornament I observe that a circle is a more agreeable figure than a square a globe than a cube and a cylinder than a parallelopipedon This last in the language of architecture is saying that a column is a more agreeable figure than a  pilaster For that reason it ought to be preferred all other circumstances being equal Another reason concurs that a column annexed to a wall which is a plain surface makes a greater variety than a pilaster There is an additional reason for rejecting pilasters in the external front of a building arising from a principle unfolded above  Chap    viz  a remarkable tendency in the mind of man to advance every thing to its perfection as well as to its final issue If I see a thing obscurely in a dim light and by disjointed parts my curiosity is roused and prompts me out of the disjointed parts to compose an entire whole I suppose it to be for example a horse My eyesight being obedient to this conjecture I immediately perceive a horse almost as distinctly as in daylight This principle is applicable to the case in hand The most superb front at a great distance appears a plain surface approaching gradually we begin to perceive inequalities these inequalities advancing a few steps more take  on the appearance of pillars but whether round or square we are uncertain our curiosity anticipating our progress cannot rest in suspense we naturally suppose the most complete pillar or that which is the most agreeable to the eye and we immediately perceive or seem to perceive a number of columns if upon a near approach we find pilasters only the disappointment makes these pilasters appear disagreeable when abstracted from that circumstance they would only have appeared somewhat less agreeable But as this deception cannot happen in the inner front inclosing a court I see no reason for excluding pilasters there when there is any reason for preferring them before columns  With respect now to the parts of a column a bare uniform cylinder without base or capital appears naked and scarce agreeable it ought therefore to have some finishing at the top and at the bottom Hence the three chief parts of a column the shaft the base and the capital Nature undoubtedly requires a certain proportion among these parts but not limited within  precise bounds I suspect that the proportions in use have been influenced in some degree by the human figure the capital being conceived as the head the base as the feet With respect to the base indeed the principle of utility interposes to vary it from the human figure the base must be so proportioned to the whole as to give the column the appearance of stability  In architecture as well as in gardening contradictory expressions ought to be avoided Firmness and solidity are the proper expressions of a pedestal carved work on the contrary ought to be light and delicate A pedestal therefore whether of a column or of a statue ought to be sparingly ornamented the ancients never ventured any bolder ornament than the bassorelievo  To succeed in allegorical or emblematic ornaments is no slight effort of genius for it is extremely difficult to dispose them so in a building as to produce any good effect The mixing them with realities makes a miserable jumble of truth and fiction  See chap sect  In a  bassorelievo on Antonin's pillar rain obtained by the prayers of a Christian legion is expressed by joining to the group of soldiers a rainy Jupiter with water in abundance running from his head and beard De Piles fond of the conceit carefully informs his reader that he must not take this for a real Jupiter but for a symbol which among the Pagans signified rain an emblem ought not to make a part of the group representing real objects or real events but be detached from it so as even at first view to appear an emblem But this is not all nor the chief point Every emblem ought to be rejected that is not clearly expressive of its meaning if it be in any degree obscure it never can be relished The temples of Ancient and Modern Virtue in the gardens of Stow appear not at first view emblematical and when we are informed that they are so it is not easy to gather their meaning The spectator sees one temple in full repair another in ruins but without an explanatory inscription he may guess but cannot be certain that the former being dedicated to Ancient  Virtue the latter to Modern Virtue are intended a satire upon the present times On the other hand a trite emblem like a trite simile is disgustful  See chap  Nor ought an emblem more than a simile to be founded on low or familiar objects for if the objects be not agreeable as well as their meaning the emblem upon the whole will not be relished A room in a dwellinghouse containing a monument to a deceased friend is dedicated to Melancholy Its furniture is a clock that strikes every minute to signify how swiftly time passes upon the monument weeping figures and other hackney'd ornaments commonly found upon tombstones with a stuff'd raven in a corner verses on death and other serious subjects inscribed all around The objects are too familiar and the artifice too apparent to produce the intended effect  The statue of Moses striking a rock from which water actually issues is also in a false taste for it is mixing reality with representation Moses himself may bring  water out of the rock but this miracle is too much for his statue The same objection lies against a cascade where we see the statue of a watergod pouring out of his urn real water  It is observed above of gardening that it contributes to rectitude of manners by inspiring gaiety and benevolence I add another observation That both gardening and architecture contribute to the same end by inspiring neatness and elegance It is observed in Scotland that even a turnpikeroad has some influence of this kind upon the low people in the neighbourhood They acquire a taste for regularity and neatness which is display'd first upon their yards and little inclosures and next within doors A taste for regularity and neatness thus gathering strength comes insensibly to be extended to dress and even to behaviour and manners  CHAP XXV Standard of Taste  "THAT there is no disputing about taste"  meaning taste in its most extensive sense is a saying so generally received as to have become a proverb One thing indeed is evident that if the proverb hold true with respect to any one external sense it must hold true with respect to all If the pleasures of the palate disdain a comparative trial and reject all criticism the pleasures of touch of smell of sound and even of sight must be equally privileged At this rate a man is not within the reach of censure even where insensible to beauty grandeur or elegance he prefers the Saracen's head upon a signpost before the best tablature of Raphael or a rude Gothic tower before the finest Grecian building nor where he prefers the smell of a  rotten carcass before that of the most odoriferous flower nor jarring discords before the most exquisite harmony  But we must not stop here If the pleasures of external sense be exempted from criticism why not every one of our pleasures from whatever source derived If taste in the proper sense of the word cannot be disputed there is as little room for disputing it in its figurative sense The proverb accordingly comprehends both and in that large sense may be resolved into the following general proposition That with respect to the sensitive part of our nature by which some objects are agreeable some disagreeable there is not such a thing as a  good  or  bad  a  right  or  wrong  that every man's taste is to himself an ultimate standard without appeal and consequently that there is no ground of censure against any one if such a one there be who prefers Blackmore before Homer selfishness before benevolence or cowardice before magnanimity  The proverb in the foregoing instances is indeed carried very far It seems difficult  however to sap its foundation or with success to attack it from any quarter For in comparing the various tastes of individuals it is not obvious what standard must be appealed to Is not every man equally a judge of what is agreeable or disagreeable to himself Doth it not seem odd and perhaps absurd that a man  ought not  to be pleased when he is or that he  ought  to be pleased when he is not  This reasoning may perplex but in contradiction to sense and feeling will never afford conviction A man of taste must necessarily feel the reasoning to be false however unqualified to detect the fallacy At the same time though no man of taste will subscribe to the proverb as holding true in every case no man will venture to affirm that it holds true in no case Subjects there are undoubtedly that we may like or dislike indifferently without any imputation upon our taste Were a philosopher to make a scale for human pleasures with many divisions in order that the value of each pleasure may be denoted by the place it occupies he would not think of making divisions  without end but would rank together many pleasures arising perhaps from different objects either as being equally valuable or differing so imperceptibly as to make a separation unnecessary Nature hath taken this course so far as appears to the generality of mankind There may be subdivisions without end but we are only sensible of the grosser divisions comprehending each of them many pleasures of various kinds To these the proverb is applicable in the strictest sense for with respect to pleasures of the same rank what ground can there be for preferring one before another If a preference in fact be given by any individual it cannot be taste but custom imitation or some peculiarity of mind  Nature in her scale of pleasures has been sparing of divisions she hath wisely and benevolently filled every division with many pleasures in order that individuals may be contented with their own lot without envying the happiness of others many hands must be employ'd to procure us the conveniencies of life and it is necessary that the  different branches of business whether more or less agreeable be filled with hands A taste too nice and delicate would obstruct this plan for it would crowd some employments leaving others not less useful totally neglected In our present condition happy it is that the plurality are not delicate in their choice They fall in readily with the occupations pleasures food and company that fortune throws in their way and if at first there be any displeasing circumstance custom soon makes it easy  The proverb will be admitted so far as it regards the particulars now explained But when apply'd in general to every subject of taste the difficulties to be encountered are insuperable What shall we say in particular as to the difficulty that arises from human nature itself Do we not talk of a good and a bad taste of a right and a wrong taste and upon that supposition do we not with great confidence censure writers painters architects and every one who deals in the fine arts Are such criticisms absurd and void of foundation Have the foregoing expressions familiar in all languages  and among all people no sort of meaning This can hardly be what is universal must have a foundation in nature If we can reach this foundation the standard of taste will no longer be a secret  All living creatures are by nature distributed into classes the individuals of each however diversified by slighter differences having a wonderful uniformity in their capital parts internal and external Each class is distinguishable from others by an external form and not less distinguishable by an internal constitution manifested by certain powers feelings desires and actions peculiar to the individuals of each class Thus each class may be conceived to have a common nature which in framing the individuals belonging to the class is taken for a model or standard  Independent altogether of experience men have a sense or conviction of a common nature or standard not only in their own species but in every species of animals And hence it is a matter of wonder to find any individual deviating from the common nature of the species whether in its internal  or external construction a child born with an aversion to its mother's milk is a matter of wonder not less than if born without a mouth or with more than one  See Essays on morality and natural religion part essay ch    With respect to this common nature or standard we are so constituted as to conceive it to be  perfect  or  right  and consequently that individuals  ought  to be made conformable to it Every remarkable deviation accordingly from the standard makes an impression upon us of imperfection irregularity or disorder it is disagreeable and raises in us a painful emotion monstrous births exciting the curiosity of a philosopher fail not at the same time to excite aversion in a high degree  Lastly we have a conviction that the common nature of man is invariable not less than universal we conceive that it hath no relation to time nor to place but that it will be the same hereafter as at present and as it was in time past the same among all nations and in all corners of the  earth Nor are we deceived giving allowance for the difference of culture and gradual refinement of manners the fact corresponds to our conviction  This conviction of a common nature or standard and of its perfection is the foundation of morality and accounts clearly for that remarkable conception we have of a right and a wrong taste in morals It accounts not less clearly for the conception we have of a right and a wrong taste in the fine arts A person who rejects objects generally agreeable and delights in objects generally disagreeable is condemned as a monster we disapprove his taste as bad or wrong and we have a clear conception that he deviates from the common standard If man were so framed as not to have any notion of a common standard the proverb mentioned in the beginning would hold universally not only in the fine arts but in morals upon that supposition the taste of every man with respect to both would to himself be an ultimate standard But the conviction of a common standard being made a part of our nature we intuitively conceive a taste to be right or good if conformable  to the common standard and wrong or bad if disconformable  No particular concerning human nature is more universal than the uneasiness a man feels when in matters of importance his opinions are rejected by others Why should difference in opinion create uneasiness more than difference in stature in countenance or in dress The sense of a common standard is the only principle that can explain this mystery Every man generally speaking taking it for granted that his opinions agree with the common sense of mankind is therefore disgusted with those of a contrary opinion not as differing from him but as differing from the common standard Hence in all disputes we find the parties each of them equally appealing constantly to the common sense of mankind as the ultimate rule or standard Were it not for this standard of which the conviction is universal I'cannot discover the slightest foundation for rancor or animosity when persons differ in essential points more than in points purely indifferent With respect to the latter which are not supposed to be regulated  by any standard individuals are permitted to think for themselves with impunity The same liberty is not indulged with respect to the former for what reason other than that the standard by which these are regulated ought as we judge to produce an uniformity of opinion in all men In a word to this sense of a common standard must be wholly attributed the pleasure we take in those who espouse the same principles and opinions with ourselves as well as the aversion we have at those who differ from us In matters left indifferent by the standard we find nothing of the same pleasure or pain A bookish man unless sway'd by convenience relisheth not the contemplative more than the active part of mankind his friends and companions are chosen indifferently out of either class A painter consorts with a poet or musician as readily as with those of his own art and one is not the more agreeable to me for loving beef as I do nor the less agreeable for preferring mutton  I have said that my disgust is raised not by differing from me but by differing  from what I judge to be the common standard This point being of importance ought to be firmly established Men it is true are prone to flatter themselves by taking it for granted that their opinions and their taste are in all respects agreeable to the common standard But there may be exceptions and experience shows there are some There are instances without number of persons who cling to the grosser amusements of gaming eating drinking without having any relish for more elegant pleasures such for example as are afforded by the fine arts Yet these very persons talking the same language with the rest of mankind pronounce in favour of the more elegant pleasures they invariably approve those who have a more refined taste and are ashamed of their own as low and sensual It is in vain to think of giving a reason for this singular impartiality against self other than the authority of the common standard Every individual of the human species the most groveling not excepted hath a natural sense of the dignity of human nature  See chap    Hence every man is esteemed and respected in proportion to the dignity of his character sentiments and actions And from the instances now given we discover that the sense of the dignity of human nature is so vigorous as even to prevail over selfpartiality and to make us despise our own taste compared with the more elevated taste of others  In our sense of a common standard and in the pleasure individuals give us by their conformity to it a curious final cause is discovered An uniformity of taste and sentiment in matters of importance forms an intimate connection among individuals and is a great blessing in the social state With respect to morals in particular unhappy it would be for mankind did not this uniformity prevail it is necessary that the actions of all men be uniform with respect to right and wrong and in order to uniformity of action it is necessary that all men think the same way in these particulars if they differ through any irregular bias the common sense of mankind is appealed to as the rule and it is the province of judges  in matters especially of equity to apply that rule The same uniformity it is yielded is not so strictly necessary in other matters of taste men though connected in general as members of the same state are by birth office or occupation separated and distinguished into different classes and are thereby qualified for different amusements variety of taste so far is no obstruction to the general connection But with respect to the more capital pleasures such as are best enjoy'd in common uniformity of taste is necessary for two great ends first to connect individuals the more intimately in the social life and next to advance these pleasures to their highest perfection With respect to the first if instead of a common taste every man had a taste peculiar to himself leading him to place his happiness upon things indifferent or perhaps disagreeable to others these capital pleasures could not be enjoy'd in common every man would pursue his own happiness by flying from others and instead of a natural tendency to union remarkable in the human species union would be our  aversion man would not be a consistent being his interest would lead him to society and his taste would draw him from it The other end will be best explained by entering upon particulars Uniformity of taste gives opportunity for sumptuous and elegant buildings for fine gardens and extensive embellishments which please universally Works of this nature could never have reached any degree of perfection had every man a taste peculiar to himself there could not be any suitable reward either of profit or honour to encourage men of genius to labour in such works The same uniformity of taste is equally necessary to perfect the arts of music sculpture and painting and to support the expence they require after they are brought to perfection Nature is in every particular consistent with herself We are formed by nature to have a high relish for the fine arts which are a great source of happiness and extremely friendly to virtue We are at the same time formed with an uniformity of taste to furnish proper objects for this high relish if uniformity of taste did not prevail the  fine arts could never have made any figure  Thus upon a sense common to the species is erected a standard of taste which without hesitation is apply'd to the taste of every individual This standard ascertaining what actions are right what wrong what proper what improper hath enabled moralists to establish rules for our conduct from which no person is allowed to swerve We have the same standard for ascertaining in all the fine arts what is beautiful or ugly high or low proper or improper proportioned or disproportioned And here as in morals we justly condemn every taste that swerves from what is thus ascertained by the common standard  The discovery of a rule or standard for trying the taste of individuals in the fine arts as well as in morals is a considerable advance but completes not our journey We have a great way yet to travel It is made out that there is a standard but it is not made out by what means we shall prevent mistaking a false standard for that of nature If from opinion and practice we endeavour to ascertain the standard of nature  we are betray'd into endless perplexities Viewing this matter historically nothing appears more various and more wavering than taste in the fine arts If we judge by numbers the Gothic taste of architecture will be preferred before that of Greece and the Chinese taste probably before both It would be endless to recount the various tastes of gardening that have prevailed in different ages and still prevail in different countries Despising the modest colouring of nature women of fashion in France daub their cheeks with a red powder Nay the unnatural swelling in the neck a disease peculiar to the inhabitants of the Alps is relished by that people But we ought not to be discouraged by such untoward instances For do we not find the like contradictions with respect to morals was it not once held lawful for a man to expose his infant children and when grown up to sell them for slaves was it not held equally lawful to punish children for the crime of their parents was not the murder of an enemy in cold blood an universal practice what stronger instance can be given  than the abominable practice of human sacrifices not less impious than immoral Such aberrations from the rules of morality prove only that men originally savage and brutish acquire not rationality or any delicacy of taste till they be long disciplined in society To ascertain the rules of morality we appeal not to the common sense of savages but of men in their more perfect state and we make the same appeal in forming the rules that ought to govern the fine arts In neither can we safely rely on a local or transitory taste but on what is the most universal and the most lasting among polite nations  In this very manner a standard for morals has been established with a good deal of accuracy and so well fitted for practice that in the hand of able judges it is daily apply'd with general satisfaction The standard of taste in the fine arts is not yet brought to such perfection And there is an obvious reason for its slower progress The sense of a right and a wrong in action is conspicuous in the breast of every individual almost without exception The sense of a  right and a wrong in the fine arts is more faint and wavering it is by nature a tender plant requiring much culture to bring it to maturity in a barren soil it cannot live and in any soil without cultivation it is weak and sickly I talk chiefly with relation to its more refined objects for some objects make such lively impressions of beauty grandeur and proportion as without exception to command the general taste There appears to me great contrivance in distinguishing thus the moral sense from a taste in the fine arts The former as a rule of conduct and as a law we ought to obey must be clear and authoritative The latter is not intitled to the same authority since it contributes to our pleasure and amusement only Were it more strong and lively it would usurp upon our duty and call off the attention from matters of greater moment Were it more clear and authoritative it would banish all difference of taste a refined taste would not form a character nor be intitled to esteem This would put an end to rivalship and consequently to all improvement  But to return to our subject However languid and cloudy the common sense of mankind may be with respect to the fine arts it is yet the only standard in these as well as in morals And when the matter is attentively considered this standard will be sound less imperfect than it appears to be at first sight In gathering the common sense of mankind upon morals we may safely consult every individual But with respect to the fine arts our method must be different a wary choice is necessary for to collect votes indifferently will certainly mislead us those who depend for food on bodily labour are totally void of taste of such a taste at least as can be of use in the fine arts This consideration bars the greater part of mankind and of the remaining part many have their taste corrupted to such a degree as to unqualify them altogether for voting The common sense of mankind must then be confined to the few that fall not under these exceptions But as such selection seems to throw matters again into uncertainty we must be more explicit upon this branch of our subject  Nothing tends more than voluptuousness to corrupt the whole internal frame and to vitiate our taste not only in the fine arts but even in morals It never fails in course of time to extinguish all the sympathetic affections and to bring on a beastly selfishness which leaves nothing of man but the shape About excluding persons of this stamp there will be no dispute Let us next bring under trial the opulent whose chief pleasure is expence Riches coveted by most men for the sake of superiority and to command respect are generally bestow'd upon costly furniture numerous attendants a princely dwelling every thing superb and gorgeous to amaze and humble all beholders Simplicity elegance propriety and every thing natural sweet or amiable are despised or neglected for these are not at the command of riches and make no figure in the public eye In a word nothing is relished but what serves to gratify pride by an imagined exaltation of the possessor above those he reckons the vulgar Such a tenor of life contracts the heart and makes every principle give way to selfinterest Benevolence  and public spirit with all their refined emotions are little felt and less regarded And if these be excluded there can be no place for the faint and delicate emotions of the fine arts  The exclusion of classes so many and various reduces within a narrow compass those who are qualified to be judges in the fine arts Many circumstances are necessary to form a judge of this sort there must be a good natural taste this taste must be improved by education reflection and experience it must be preserved alive by a regular course of life by using the goods of fortune with moderation and by following the dictates of improved nature which gives welcome to every rational pleasure without deviating into excess This is the tenor of life which of all contributes the most to refinement of taste and the same tenor of life contributes the most to happiness in general  If there appear much uncertainty in a standard that requires so painful and intricate a selection we may possibly be reconciled to it by the following consideration That  with respect to the fine arts there is less difference of taste than is commonly imagined Nature hath marked all her works with indelible characters of high or low plain or elegant strong or weak These if at all perceived are seldom misapprehended by any taste and the same marks are equally perceptible in works of art A defective taste is incurable and it hurts none but the possessor because it carries no authority to impose upon others I know not if there be such a thing as a taste naturally bad or wrong a taste for example that prefers a groveling pleasure before one that is high and elegant Groveling pleasures are never preferred they are only made welcome by those who know no better Differences about objects of taste it is true are endless but they generally concern trifles or possibly matters of equal rank where the preference may be given either way with impunity If on any occasion the dispute go deeper and persons differ where they ought not a depraved taste will readily be discovered on one or other side occasioned by  imitation custom or corrupted manners such as are described above  If after all that is said the standard of taste be thought not yet sufficiently ascertained there is still one resource in which I put great confidence What I have in view are the principles that constitute the sensitive part of our nature By means of these principles common to all men a wonderful uniformity is preserved among the emotions and feelings of different individuals the same object making upon every person the same impression the same in kind at least if not in degree There have been aberrations as above observed from these principles but soon or late they always prevail by restoring the wanderers to the right track The uniformity of taste here accounted for is the very thing that in other words is termed the common sense of mankind And this discovery leads us to means for ascertaining the common sense of mankind or the standard of taste more unerringly than the selection above insisted on Every doubt with relation to this standard occasioned by the practice of different nations  and different times may be cleared by applying to the principles that ought to govern the taste of every individual In a word a thorough acquaintance with these principles will enable us to form the standard of taste and to lay a foundation for this valuable branch of knowledge is the declared purpose of the present undertaking  APPENDIX Terms defined or explained  CONSIDERING the things I am conscious of some are internal or within my mind some external or without Passion thinking volition are internal objects Objects of sight of hearing of smell of touch of taste are external  The faculty by which I discover an internal object is termed an internal sense the faculty by which I discover an external object is termed an external sense This distinction among the senses is made with reference to their objects merely for the senses external and internal are equally powers or faculties of the mind  But as self is an object and the only one that cannot be termed either external  or internal the faculty by which I am conscious of myself must be distinguished from both the internal and external senses  By sight we perceive the qualities of figure colour motion  c  by the ear we perceive the qualities high low loud soft by touch we perceive rough smooth hot cold  c  by taste we perceive sweet sour bitter  c  by smell we perceive fragrant stinking  c  Qualities from our very conception of them are not capable of an independent existence but must belong to something of which they are the qualities A thing with respect to its qualities is termed a subject or  substratum  because its qualities rest as it were upon it or are founded upon it The subject or  substratum  of visible qualities is termed  substance  of audible qualities  sound  of tangible qualities  body  In like manner  taste  is the  substratum  of qualities perceived by our sense of tasting and  smell  is the  substratum  of qualities perceived by our sense of smelling  Substance and sound are perceived existing in a certain place often at a considerable  distance from the organ But smell touch and taste are perceived at the organs of sense  Objects of internal sense are conceived to be attributes deliberation reasoning resolution willing consenting are internal actions passions and emotions are internal agitations With regard to the former I am conscious of being active with regard to the latter I am conscious of being passive  Again we are conscious of internal action as in the head of passions and emotions as in the heart  Many actions may be exerted internally and many effects produced of which we are not conscious When we investigate the ultimate cause of animal motions it is the most probable opinion that they proceed from some internal power and if so we are in this particular unconscious of our own operations But consciousness being imply'd in the very conception of deliberating reasoning resolving willing consenting these operations cannot go on without our knowledge The same is the case  of passions and emotions for no internal agitation is denominated a passion or emotion but what we are conscious of  The mind is not always in the same state it is at times chearful melancholy severe peevish These different states may not improperly be denominated  tones  An object by making an impression produceth an emotion or passion which again gives the mind a certain tone suited to it    Perception  and  sensation  are commonly reckoned synonymous terms signifying the consciousness we have of objects but in accurate language they are distinguished The consciousness we have of external objects is termed  perception  Thus we are said to perceive a certain animal a certain colour sound taste smell  c  The consciousness we have of pleasure or pain arising from external objects is termed  sensation  Thus we have a sensation of cold of heat of the pain of a wound of the pleasure of a landscape of music of beauty of propriety of behaviour  c  The consciousness we have of internal action such as deliberation resolution choice is  never termed either a perception or a sensation    Conception  ought to be distinguished from perception External things and their attributes are objects of perception relations among things are objects of conception I see two men James and John the consciousness I have of them is a perception but the consciousness I have of their relation as father and son is termed a  conception  Again perception relates to objects really existing conception to fictitious objects or to those framed by the imagination    Feeling  beside denoting one of the external senses has two different significations Of these the most common includes not only sensation but also that branch of consciousness which relates to passions and emotions it is proper to say I have a feeling of cold of heat or of pain and it is not less proper to say I have a feeling of love of hatred of anger or of any other passion But it is not applied to internal action for it is not proper to say that a man feels himself deliberating or resolving In a sense less common feeling is put for the thing that is felt and in this sense it is a general  term for every one of our passions and emotions  That we cannot perceive an external object till an impression be made upon our body is probable from reason and is ascertained by experience But it is not necessary that we be made sensible of the impression It is true that in touching tasting and smelling we feel the impression made at the organ of sense but in seeing and hearing we feel no impression We know indeed by experience that before we perceive a visible object its image is spread upon the  retina tunica  and that before we perceive a sound an impression is made upon the drum of the ear and yet here we are not conscious either of the organic image or the organic impression nor are we conscious of any other operation preparatory to the act of perception All we can say is that we see that river or hear that trumpet  Yet a singular opinion that impressions are the only objects of perception has been espoused by some philosophers of no mean rank not attending to the foregoing peculiarity in the senses of seeing and hearing that we perceive objects without being conscious of an organic impression or of any impression See the treatise upon human nature where we find the following passage book p sect  "Properly speaking it is not our body we perceive when we regard our limbs and members so that the ascribing a real and corporeal existence to these impressions or to their objects is an act of the mind as difficult to explain"  c    Objects once perceived may be recalled to the mind by the power of memory When I recall an object in this manner it appears to me the same as in the original survey only more faint and obscure For example I saw yesterday a spreading oak growing on the brink of a river I endeavour to recall it to my mind How is this operation performed Do I endeavour to form in my mind a picture of it or representative image Not so I transport myself ideally to the place where I saw the tree yesterday upon which I have a perception of the tree and river similar in all respects to the perception I had of it when I viewed it with my eyes only more obscure And in this recollection I am not conscious of a picture or representative image more than in the original survey the perception is of  the tree itself as at first I confirm this by another experiment After attentively surveying a fine statue I close my eyes What follows The same object continues without any difference but that it is less distinct than formerly This indistinct secondary perception of an object is termed  an idea  And therefore the precise and accurate definition of an idea in contradistinction to an original perception is  "That perception or consciousness of a real object which a person has by exercising the power of memory"  Every thing one is conscious of whether internal or external passions emotions thinking resolving willing heat cold  c  as well as external objects may be recalled as above by the power of memory  From this definition of an idea the following proposition must be evident That there can be no such thing as an innate idea If the original perception of an object be not innate which is obvious it is not less obvious that the idea or secondary perception of that object cannot be innate And yet to prove this selfevident proposition Locke has bestowed a whole book of his treatise upon human understanding So necessary it is to give accurate definitions and so preventive of dispute are definitions when accurate Dr Berkeley has taken great pains to prove another proposition equally evident That there can be no such thing as a general idea All our original perceptions are of particular objects and our secondary perceptions or ideas must be equally so    The original perceptions of external objects are either simple or complex A sound may be so simple as not to be resolvable into parts so may a taste and a smell A perception of touch is generally compounded of the more simple perceptions of hardness or softness joined with smoothness or roughness heat or cold  c  But of all the perceptions of external sense that of a visible object is the most complex because the eye takes in more particulars than any other organ A tree is composed of its trunk branches leaves it has colour figure size every one of these separately produceth a perception in the mind of the spectator which are all combined into the complex perception of the tree  The original perception of an object of sight is more complete lively and distinct than that of any other external sense and for that reason an idea or secondary  perception of a visible object is more distinct and lively than that of any other object A fine passage in music may for a moment be recalled to the mind with tolerable accuracy but the idea of any other object and also of sound after the shortest interval is extremely obscure  As the range of an individual is commonly within narrow bounds of space opportunities seldom offer of an enlarged acquaintance with external objects Original perceptions therefore and their corresponding ideas are a provision too scanty for the purposes of life Language is an admirable contrivance for supplying this deficiency for by language the original perceptions of each individual may be communicated to all and the same may be done by painting and other imitative arts It is natural to suppose that the most lively ideas are the most susceptible of being communicated to others This holds more especially when language is the vehicle of communication for language hitherto has not arrived at any greater perfection than to express clear and lively ideas Hence it is that poets and orators  who are extremely successful in describing objects of sight find objects of the other senses too faint and obscure for language An idea thus acquired of an object at second hand ought to be distinguished from an idea of memory though their resemblance has occasioned the same term to be apply'd to both This is to be regretted for when knowledge is to be communicated by language ambiguity in the signification of words is a great obstruction to accuracy of conception Thus nature hath furnished the means of multiplying ideas without end and of providing every individual with a sufficient stock to answer not only the necessities but even the elegancies of life  Further man is endued with a sort of creative power he can fabricate images of things that have no existence The materials employ'd in this operation are ideas of sight which may be taken to pieces and combined into new forms at pleasure their complexity and vivacity make them fit materials But a man has no such power over any of his other ideas whether of the external or internal  senses he cannot after the utmost effort combine these into new forms his ideas of such objects are too obscure for this operation An image thus fabricated cannot be called a secondary perception not being derived from an original perception the poverty of language however as in the case immediately above mentioned has occasioned the same term  idea  to be apply'd to all This singular power of fabricating images independent of real objects is distinguished by the name  imagination  As ideas are the chief materials employ'd in thinking reasoning and reflecting it is of consequence that their nature and differences be understood It appears now that ideas may be distinguished into three kinds first Ideas or secondary perceptions properly termed  ideas of memory  second Ideas communicated by language or other signs and third Ideas of imagination These ideas differ from each other in many respects but the chief foundation of the distinction is the difference of their causes The first kind are derived from real existences that have been objects of our  senses language is the cause of the second or any other sign that has the same power with language and a man's imagination is to himself the cause of the third It is scarce necessary to add that an idea originally of imagination being convey'd to others by language or any other vehicle becomes in the mind of those to whom it is convey'd an idea of the second kind and again that an idea of this kind being afterward recalled to the mind becomes in that circumstance an idea of memory  Human nature is not so constituted as that its objects are perceived with indifferency these with very few exceptions raise in us either pleasant or painful emotions External objects at the same time appear in themselves agreeable or disagreeable but with some difference betwixt those which produce organic impressions and those which affect us from a distance When we touch a soft and smooth body we have a pleasant feeling as at the place of contact and this feeling we distinguish not at least not accurately from the agreeableness of the body itself The same holds  in general with regard to all the organic impressions It is otherwise in hearing and seeing A sound is perceived as in itself agreeable and at the same time raises in the hearer a pleasant emotion an object of sight appears in itself agreeable and at the same time raises in the seer a pleasant emotion These are accurately distinguished The pleasant emotion is felt as within the mind the agreeableness of the object is placed upon the object and is perceived as one of its qualities or properties The agreeable appearance of an object of sight is termed  beauty  and the disagreeable appearance of such an object is termed  ugliness  But though beauty and ugliness in their proper and genuine signification are confined to objects of sight yet in a more lax and figurative signification they are apply'd to objects of the other senses They are sometimes apply'd even to abstract terms for it is not unusual to say  a beautiful theorem a beautiful constitution of government  But I am inclined to think that we are led to use such expression by conceiving  the thing as delineated upon paper and as in some sort an object of sight  A line composed by a precise rule is perceived and said to be regular A straight line a parabola a hyperbola the circumference of a circle and of an ellipse are all of them regular lines A figure composed by a precise rule is perceived and said to be regular Thus a circle a square a hexagon an equilateral triangle are regular figures being composed by a rule that determines the form of each When the form of a line or of a figure is ascertained by a rule that leaves nothing arbitrary the line and the figure are said to be perfectly regular this is the case of the figures now mentioned and it is the case of a straight line and of the circumference of a circle A figure and a line are not perfectly regular where any part or circumstance is left arbitrary A parallelogram and a rhomb are less regular than a square the parallelogram is subjected to no rule as to the length of sides other than that the opposite sides be equal the rhomb is subjected to no rule as to its angles other than that the opposite angles be  equal For the same reason the circumference of an ellipse the form of which is susceptible of much variety is less regular than that of a circle  Regularity properly speaking belongs like beauty to objects of sight like beauty it is also apply'd figuratively to other objects Thus we say  a regular government a regular composition of music  and  regular discipline  When two figures are composed of similar parts they are said to be uniform Perfect uniformity is where the constituent parts of two figures are precisely similar to each other Thus two cubes of the same dimensions are perfectly uniform in all their parts An imperfect uniformity is where the parts mutually correspond but without being precisely similar The uniformity is imperfect betwixt two squares or cubes of unequal dimensions and still more so betwixt a square and a parallelogram  Uniformity is also applicable to the constituent parts of the same figure The constituent parts of a square are perfectly uniform its sides are equal and its angles  are equal Wherein then differs regularity from uniformity for a figure composed of similar or uniform parts must undoubtedly be regular Regularity is predicated of a figure considered as a whole composed of resembling or uniform parts uniformity again is predicated of these parts as related to each other by resemblance We say a square is a regular not an uniform figure but with respect to the constituent parts of a square we say not that they are regular but that they are uniform  In things destined for the same use as legs arms eyes windows spoons we expect uniformity Proportion ought to govern parts intended for different uses We require a certain proportion betwixt a leg and an arm in the base the shaft the capital of a pillar and in the length the breadth the height of a room Some proportion is also required in different things intimately connected as betwixt a dwellinghouse the garden and the stables But we require no proportion among things slightly connected as betwixt the table a man writes on and the dog that follows him  Proportion and uniformity never coincide things perfectly similar are uniform but proportion is never applied to them the four sides and angles of a square are equal and perfectly uniform but we say not that they are proportional Thus proportion always implies inequality or difference but then it implies it to a certain degree only the most agreeable proportion resembles a  maximum  in mathematics a greater or less inequality or difference is less agreeable  Order regards various particulars First in tracing or surveying objects we are directed by a sense of order we conceive it to be more orderly that we should pass from a principle to its accessories and from a whole to its parts than in the contrary direction Next with respect to the position of things a sense of order directs us to place together things intimately connected Thirdly in placing things that have no natural connection that order appears the most perfect where the particulars are made to bear the strongest relation to each other that position can give them Thus parallelism is the strongest relation  that position can bestow upon straight lines If they be so placed as by production to intersect each other the relation is less perfect A large body in the middle and two equal bodies of less size one on each side is an order that produces the strongest relation the bodies are susceptible of by position The relation betwixt the two equal bodies would be stronger by juxtaposition but they would not both have the same relation to the third  The beauty or agreeableness of an object as it enters into the original perception enters also into the secondary perception or idea An idea of imagination is also agreeable though in a lower degree than an idea of memory where the objects are of the same kind But this defect in the ideas of imagination is abundantly supply'd by their greatness and variety For the imagination acting without control can fabricate ideas of finer visible objects of more noble and heroic actions of greater wickedness of more surprising events than ever in fact existed And by communicating these ideas in words painting sculpture  c  the influence of the imagination is not less extensive than great  In the nature of every man there is somewhat original that serves to distinguish him from others that tends to form a character and with the concurrence of external accidents to make him meek or fiery candid or deceitful resolute or timorous chearful or morose This original bent is termed  disposition  Which must be distinguished from a  principle  no original bent obtains the latter appellation but what belongs to the whole species A principle makes part of the common nature of man a disposition makes part of the nature of this or that man A  propensity  comprehends both for it signifies indifferently either a principle or a disposition    Affection  signifying a settled bent of mind toward a particular being or thing occupies a middle place betwixt propensity on the one hand and passion on the other A propensity being original must exist before any opportunity be offered to exert it affection can never be original because having a special relation to a particular object  it cannot exist till the object be presented Again passion depends on the presence of the object in idea at least if not in reality when the idea vanishes the passion vanishes with it Affection on the contrary once settled on a person is a lasting connection and like other connections subsists even when we do not think of it A familiar example will clear the whole There may be in the mind a propensity to gratitude which through want of an object happens never to be exerted and which therefore is never discovered even by the person who has it Another who has the same propensity meets with a kindly office that makes him grateful to his benefactor an intimate connection is formed betwixt them termed  affection  which like other connections has a permanent existence though not always in view The affection for the most part lies dormant till an opportunity offer of exerting it in this circumstance it is converted into the passion of gratitude and the opportunity is greedily seized for testifying gratitude in the most complete manner    Aversion  I think must be opposed  to affection and not to desire as it commonly is We have an affection for one person we have an aversion to another the former disposes us to do good to its object the latter to do ill  What is a sentiment It is not a perception for a perception signifies our consciousness of external objects It is not consciousness of an internal action such as thinking suspending thought inclining resolving willing  c  Neither is it a conception of relation amongst objects or of their differences a conception of this kind is termed  opinion  The term  sentiment  is appropriated to those thoughts that are suggested by a passion or emotion    Attention  is that state of mind which prepares a man to receive impressions According to the degree of attention objects make a stronger or weaker impression  Bacon in his natural history makes the following observations Sounds are meliorated by the intension of the sense where the common sense is collected most to the particular sense of hearing and the sight suspended Therefore sounds are sweeter as well as greater in the night than in the day and I suppose they are sweeter to blind men than to others and it is manifest that between sleeping and waking when all the senses are bound and suspended music is far sweeter than when one is fully waking    In an indolent state or in a reverie objects make but a slight impression far from what they make when they command our attention In a train of perceptions no single object makes such a figure as it would do single and apart for when the attention is divided among many objects no single object is intitled to a large share Hence the stillness of night contributes to terror there being nothing to divert the attention  Horror ubique animos simul ipsa silentia terrent  Aeneid  Zara  Silence and solitude are ev'ry where  Through all the gloomy ways and iron doors  That hither lead nor human face nor voice  Is seen or heard A dreadful din was wont  To grate the sense when enter'd here from groans  And howls of slaves condemn'd from clink of chains  And crash of rusty bars and creeking hinges  And ever and anon the sight was dash'd  With frightful faces and the meagre looks  Of grim and ghastly executioners  Yet more this stillness terrifies my soul  Than did that scene of complicated horrors  Mourning Bride act sc  And hence it is that an object seen at the termination of a confined view is more agreeable than when seen in a group with the surrounding objects  The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark  When neither is attended and I think  The nightingale if she should sing by day  When ev'ry goose is cackling would be thought  No better a musician than the wren  Merchant of Venice  In matters of slight importance attention in a great measure is directed by will and for that reason it is our own fault if trifling objects make any deep impression Had we power equally to withhold our attention from matters of importance we might be proof against any deep impression But our power fails us here an interesting object seizes and fixes the attention beyond the possibility of control and while our attention is thus forcibly attached by one object  others may solicit for admittance but in vain for they will not be regarded Thus a small misfortune is scarce

class of individuals enjoying qualities in common is termed a  genus  a subdivision of such class is termed a  species  Again that circumstance which distinguisheth one genus one species or even one individual from another is termed  a  modification  the same particular that is termed a  property  or  quality  when considered as belonging to an individual or a class of individuals is termed a  modification  when considered as distinguishing the individual or the class from another A black skin and soft curled hair are properties of a negro the same circumstances considered as marks that distinguish a negro from a man of a different species are denominated  modifications  Objects of sight being complex are distinguishable into the several particulars that enter into the composition these objects are all of them coloured and they all have length breadth and thickness When I behold a spreading oak I distinguish in this object size figure colour and sometimes motion viewing a flowing river I distinguish colour figure and constant motion a dye has colour black spots six plain surfaces all equal and uniform The objects of touch have all of them extension Some of them are felt rough some smooth some of them are hard some soft With respect to the other senses some of their objects  are simple some complex a sound a taste a smell may be so simple as not to be distinguishable into any parts others are perceived to be compounded of different sounds different tastes and different smells  The eye at one look can take in a number of objects as of trees in a field or men in a crowd as these objects are distinct from each other each having a separate and independent existence they are distinguishable in the mind as well as in reality and there is nothing more easy than to abstract from some and to confine our contemplation to others A large oak with its spreading branches fixes our attention upon itself and abstracts us from the shrubs that surround it In the same manner with respect to compounded sounds tastes or smells we can fix our thoughts upon any one of the component parts abstracting our attention from the rest But the power of abstraction is not confined to objects that are separable in reality as well as mentally it also takes place where there can be no real separation The size the figure the colour of a tree are inseparably connected  and cannot exist independent of each other the same of length breadth and thickness and yet we can mentally confine our observations to one of these neglecting or abstracting from the rest Here abstraction takes place where there cannot be a real separation  This power of abstraction is of great utility A carpenter considers a log of wood with regard to hardness firmness colour and texture a philosopher neglectting these properties makes the log undergo a chymical analysis and examines its taste its smell and its component principles the geometrician confines his reasoning to the figure the length breadth and thickness In general every artist abstracting from all other properties confines his observations to those which have a more immediate connection with his profession  Hence clearly appears the meaning of an  abstract term  and  abstract idea  If in viewing an object we can abstract from some of its parts or properties and attach ourselves to others there must be the same facility when we recall this object to the  mind in idea This leads directly to the definition of an abstract idea  viz  "A partial view of a complex object limited to one or more of the component parts or properties laying aside or abstracting from others"  A word that denotes an abstract idea is called an  abstract term  The power of abstraction is bestowed upon man for the purposes solely of reasoning It tends greatly to the facility as well as clearness of any process of reasoning that withdrawing from every other circumstance we can confine our attention to the single property we desire to investigate  Abstract ideas may I think be distinguished into three different kinds all equally subservient to the reasoning faculty Individuals appear to have no end and did we not possess the faculty of distributing them into classes the mind would be lost in an endless variety and no progress be made in knowledge It is by the faculty of abstraction that we distribute beings into  genera  and  species  finding a number of individuals connected by certain qualities common to all we give a name to these  individuals considered as thus connected which name by gathering them together into one class serves in a curt manner to express the whole of these individuals as distinct from others Thus the word  animal  serves to denote every being which hath selfmotion and the words  man horse lion c  answer similar purposes This is the first and most common sort of abstraction and it is of the most extensive use by enabling us to comprehend in our reasoning whole kinds and sorts instead of individuals without end The next sort of abstract ideas and terms comprehends a number of individual objects considered as connected by some occasional relation A great number of persons collected together in one place without any other relation but merely that of contiguity are denominated  a crowd  in forming this term we abstract from sex from age from condition from dress  c  A number of persons connected by being subjected to the same laws and to the same government are termed  a nation  and a number of men subjected to the same military  command are termed  an army  A third sort of abstraction is where a single property or part which may be common to many individuals is selected to be the subject of our contemplation for example whiteness heat beauty length roundness head arm  Abstract terms are a happy invention it is by their means chiefly that the particulars which we make the subject of our reasoning are brought into close union and separated from all others however naturally connected Without the aid of such terms the mind could never be kept steady to its proper subject but would perpetually be in hazard of assuming foreign circumstances or neglecting what are essential In a word a general term denotes in a curt manner certain objects occasionally combined We can without the aid of language compare real objects by intuition when these objects are present and when absent we can compare them by means of the ideas we have of them but when we advance farther and attempt to make inferences and draw conclusions we always employ  abstract terms even in thinking It would be as difficult to reason without them as to perform operations in algebra without signs for there is scarce any reasoning without some degree of abstraction and we cannot abstract to purpose without making use of general terms Hence it follows that without language man would scarce be a rational being  The same thing in different respects has different names With respect to certain qualities it is termed a  substance  with respect to other qualities a  body  and with respect to qualities of all sorts a  subject  it is termed a  passive subject  with respect to an action exerted upon it an  object  with respect to a percipient a  cause  with respect to the effect it produces and an  effect  with respect to its cause  INDEX  The volumes are denoted by numeral letters the pages by figures  ABstract idea  defined iii Abstract ideas of different kinds iii  Abstraction  power of iii Its use iii  Abstract terms
