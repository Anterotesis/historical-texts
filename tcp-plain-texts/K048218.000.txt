 OATLANDS OR THE TRANSFER OF THE LAUREL  A POEM  BY JOHN O'KEEFFE  London  PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT OPPOSITE BURLINGTONHOUSE PICCADILLY  OATLANDS OR THE TRANSFER OF THE LAUREL  A POEM  REASON a dame not often in the wrong  Bethought for much to think is Reason giv'n  On what is ill and what is left undone  And how dispos'd of all the gifts of Heav'n  Perceiving Fortune off could fling her hood  And stop to cast on knaves a partial eye  And that when come where blushing merit stood  Up went her bandage and she pass'd him by  Within a sacred grove to peace consign'd  A branch by Fortune from the Laurel torn  Was straight into a graceful wreath entwin'd  She said"by Victory let this be worn"  To Victory the sculptur'd arch was rais'd  High o'er the smoaking ruins of a town  And bells rang loud and every window blaz'd  And tuneful minstrels sang her vast renown  And on her forehead Glory was inscrib'd  In glittering letters great of beaming gold  Fair Honor's fount she seem'd to have imbib'd  In sooth her form was gracious to behold  And blasts were puff'd from trump of vaunting Fame  That Justice to her had the wreath decreed  Yet Reason doubts the gay Virago's claim  If  sans  desert why wear the lib'ral meed  Let Emulation for that wreath contend  Let youthful ardour pant to reach the goal  A gilded prize may be the purpos'd end  Or fierce Ambition only fire the soul  In proud cathedrals why Te Deum raise  Say why to Victory the choral joy  Such songs indeed were pure immortal praise  Did God create for man but to destroy  "Her conquests rapine are" sage Reason cry'd  "Her flash of Glory all illusive vain  "Her fairfac'd Honor fallacy and pride  "And crimson slaughters do her hands distain  "Should lightheel'd Vanity for trinkets pine  "She makes of Victory a pliant tool  "To work a star or riband wondrous fine  "Reward of cowardknave or valiant fool  "Before the rustic youth can form a choice  "Some trick conveys him to a foreign land  "By custom braz'd in carnage can rejoice  "The brutal hero of a cutthroat band  "The perfect gen'ral shews his needled star  "The mangled private may go hang or beg  "Dispute his charter to the trade of war  "He swears and shews it in his wooden leg  "Fire pest and famine doth she give mankind  "Is Vict'ry then the Laurel won by thee  "The sovereign good O Wisdom let me find  "I hold this evergreen her honor'd fee  "'Tis Charity that wipes the briny tear  "Which Vict'ry bids adown the cheek to flow  "That lifts with smiles the mourner from the bier  "And puts aside the bitter cup of woe  "Perish her hopes of Industry the bane  "That turn the ploughshare to a murd'rous sword  "And make the ruffian once a simple swain  "Atchieve exploits by earth and heaven abhorr'd  "The husband and the parent she hath slain  "Widows and orphans Victory hath made  "Untill'd nor waving ears adorn the plain  "For Desolation marks her ruthless trade"  Few know where bashful Charity doth hide  Full seen of Heav'n she shrinks from mortal ken  And many a devious round and far and wide  Did Reason seek her 'mid the haunts of men  Quoth Wisdom "Reason thou'rt as Fortune blind  "For just decision idly thus to roam  "When Charity beneficent and kind  "Dwells near at hand and OATLANDS is her home  "'Tis not alone with paltry gold to part  "Or chase pale sorrow from the cottage door  "She there stores treasur'd moral in the heart  "God's own appointed agent for the poor"  Blithe on a velvet turf of mossy green  Where Na√Øds from the silver Thames resort  Surrounded by her playful charge was seen  The lovely mistress  The Dutchess of York  of their harmless sport  Far Vice and Folly fly at her command  And sure success attends her sweet employ  And as the mental buds to flowers expand  She views her labours with a mother's joy  To little acts let great ones lowly bend  Where rank by pride is only understood  To works angelic her white thoughts ascend  Aspiring to the height of doing good  Reason convinc'd that Charity benign  Of OATLAND's grove had made her lov'd retreat  Bade Victory her Laurel Crown resign  To lie at beauteous FREDERICA's feet  Nature her noblest task had well perform'd  Endow'd the babe with intellectual grace  The lambent spark that all his bosom warm'd  Shone full confess'd in air shape limb and face  In culture Fortune take an ample share  Or else the plant may wither in the bloom  Why genius that with Phosper might compare  Condemn to waste a lamp within the tomb  Not that each shrub can hang with golden fruit  Or roses issue from the humble sod  But Reason best can lift him from the brute  When man shall know that he's the work of God  Or say that nature leaves her work most crude  Still more it stands in need of polish'd aid  Untaught we view our kind a savage rude  And wonder at the monster we have made  But wealth can cherish draw the talents forth  A sun which Fortune's cold neglect supplies  Then more than mines the bounteous heart is worth  That gives what sordid penury denies  Hail heavenly FREDERICA God of all  Pour every blessing on the gentle fair  Should ills assail anticipate her call  Who takes the helpless infant to her care  THE END
