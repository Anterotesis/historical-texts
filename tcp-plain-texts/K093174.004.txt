II and III Price s d each  SIXTEENTH EVENING  PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE  A STORY  THEODORE  was a boy of lively parts and engaging manners but he had the failing of being extremely impatient in his temper and inclined to extremes He was ardent in all his pursuits but could bear no disappointment and if the least thing went wrong he threw up what he was about in a pet and could not be prevailed upon to resume it His father Mr  Carleton  had given him a bed in the garden which he had cultivated with great delight The borders were set with double daisies of different colours next to which was a row of auriculas and polyanthuses Beyond  were stocks and other taller flowers and shrubs and a beautiful damask rose graced the centre This rose was just budding and  Theodore  watched its daily progress with great interest One unfortunate day the door of the garden being left open a drove of pigs entered and began to riot on the herbs and flowers An alarm being sounded  Theodore  and the servant boy rushed upon them smacking their whips The whole herd in affright took their course across  Theodore  's flowerbed on which some of them had before been grazing Stocks daisies and auriculas were all trampled down or torn up and what was worst of all a large old sow ran directly over the beautiful rose tree and broke off its stem level with the ground When  Theodore  came up and beheld all the mischief and especially his favourite rose strewed on the soil rage and grief choaked his utterance After standing a while the picture  of despair he snatched up a spade that stood near and with furious haste dug over the whole bed and whelmed all the relics of his flowers deep under the soil This exertion being ended he burst into tears and silently left the garden  His father who had beheld the scene at a distance though somewhat diverted at the boy's childish violence yet began seriously to reflect on the future consequences of such a temper if suffered to grow up without restraint He said nothing to him at the time but in the afternoon he took him a walk into a neighbouring parish There was a large wild common and at the skirts of it a neat farmhouse with fields lying round it all well fenced and cultivated in the best manner The air was sweetened with the beanflower and clover An orchard of fine young fruit trees lay behind the house and before it a little garden gay with all the flowers  of the season A stand of beehives was on the southern side sheltered by a thick hedge of honeysuckle and sweetbriar The farmyard was stocked with pigs and poultry A herd of cows with full udders was just coming home to be milked Every thing wore the aspect of plenty and good management The charms of the scene struck  Theodore  very forcibly and he expressed his pleasure in the warmest terms This place said his father belongs to a man who is the greatest example I know of patient fortitude bearing up against misfortune and all that you see is the reward of his own perseverance I am a little acquainted with him and we will go in and beg a draught of milk and try if we can prevail upon him to tell us his story  Theodore  willingly accompanied his father They were received by the farmer with cordial frankness After they were seated Mr  Hardman  says Mr  Carleton  I have often heard of part  of your adventures but never had a regular account of the whole If you will favour me and my little boy with the story of them we shall think ourselves much obliged to you Lack a day sir said he there's little in them worth telling of as far as I know I have had my ups and downs in the world to be sure but so have many men beside However if you wish to hear about them they are at your service and I can't say but it gives me pleasure sometimes to talk over old matters and think how much better things have turned out than might have been expected Now I am of opinion said Mr  C  that from your spirit and perseverance a good conclusion might always have been expected You are pleased to compliment sir replied the farmer but I will begin without more words  You may perhaps have heard that my father was a man of good estate He thought of nothing poor man but  how to spend it and he had the uncommon luck to spend it twice over For when he was obliged to sell it the first time it was bought in by a relation who left it him again by his will But my poor father was not a man to take warning He fell to living as he had done before and just made his estate and his life hold out together He died at the age of five and forty and left his family beggars I believe he would not have taken to drinking as he did had it not been for his impatient temper which made him fret and vex himself for every trifie and then he had nothing for it but to drown his care in liquor  It was my lot to be taken by my mother's brother who was master of a merchant ship I served him as an apprentice several years and underwent a good deal of the usual hardship of a sailor's life He had just made me his mate in a voyage up the Mediterranean when we had the misfortune to be wrecked on  the coast of Morocco The ship struck at some distance from shore and we lay a long stormy night with the waves dashing over us expecting every moment to perish My uncle and several of the crew died of fatigue and want and by morning but four of us were left alive My companions were so disheartened that they thought of nothing but submitting to their fate For my part I thought life still worth struggling for and the weather having become calmer I persuaded them to join me in making a kind of raft by the help of which with much toil and danger we reached the land Here we were seized by the barbarous inhabitants and carried up the country for slaves to the emperor We were employed about some public buildings made to work very hard with the whip at our backs and allowed nothing but water and a kind of pulse I have heard persons talk as if there was little in being  a slave but the name but they who have been slaves themselves I am sure will never make light of slavery in others A ransom was set on our heads but so high that it seemed impossible for poor friendless creatures like us ever to pay it The thought of perpetual servitude together with the hard treatment we met with quite overcame my poor companions They drooped and died one after another I still thought it not impossible to mend my condition and perhaps to recover my freedom We worked about twelve hours in the day and had one holiday in the week I employed my leisure time in learning to make mats and flag baskets in which I soon became so expert as to have a good many for sale and thereby got a little money to purchase better food and several small conveniencies We were afterwards set to work in the emperor's gardens and here I showed so much goodwill and attention that I got into  favour with the overseer He had a large garden of his own and he made interest for me to be suffered to work for him alone on the condition of paying a man to do my duty I soon became so useful to him that he treated me more like a hired servant than a slave and gave me regular wages I learned the language of the country and might have passed my time comfortably enough could I have accommodated myself to their manners and religion and forgot my native land I saved all I could in order to purchase my freedom but the ransom was so high that I had little prospect of being able to do it for some years to come A circumstance however happened which brought it about at once Some villains one night laid a plot to murder my master and plunder his house I slept in a little shed in the garden where the tools lay and being awakened  by a noise I saw four men break through the fence and walk up an alley towards the house I crept out with a spade in my hand and silently followed them They made a hole with instruments in the housewall big enough for a man to enter at Two of them had got in and the third was beginning to enter when I rushed forward and with a blow of my spade clove the skull of one of the robbers and gave the other such a stroke on the shoulder as disabled him I then made a loud outcry to alarm the family My master and his son who lay in the house got up and having let me in we secured the two others after a sharp conflict in which I received a severe wound with a dagger My master who looked upon me as his preserver had all possible care taken of me and as soon as I was cured made me a present of my liberty He would fain have kept me with him but my  mind was so much bent on returning to my native country that I immediately set out to the nearest seaport and took my passage in a vessel going to Gibraltar  From this place I returned in the first ship for England As soon as we arrived in the Downs and I was rejoicing at the sight of the white cliffs a manofwar's boat came on board and pressed into the king's service all of us who were seamen I could not but think it hard that this should be my welcome at home after a long slavery but there was no remedy I resolved to do my duty in my station and leave the rest to providence I was abroad during the remainder of the war and saw many a stout fellow sink under disease and despondence My knowledge of seamanship got me promoted to the post of a petty officer and at the peace I was paid off and received a pretty sum for wages and prizemoney  With this I set off for London I had experienced too much distress from want to be inclined to squander away my money so I put it into a banker's hands and began to look out for some new way of life  Unfortunately there were some things of which I had no more experience than a child and the tricks of London were among these An advertisement offering extraordinary advantages to a partner in a commercial concern who could bring a small capital tempted me to make enquiry about the matter and I was soon cajoled by a plausible artful fellow to venture my whole stock in it The business was a manufacture about which I knew nothing at all but as I was not afraid of my labour I set about working as they directed me with great diligence and thought all was going on prosperously One morning on coming to the office I found my partners  decamped and the same day I was arrested for a considerable sum due by the partnership It was in vain for me to think of getting bail so I was obliged to go to prison Here I should have been half starved but for my Moorish trade of matmaking by the help of which I bettered my condition for some months when the creditors finding that nothing could be got out of me suffered me to be set at liberty  I was now in the wide world without a farthing or a friend but I thanked God that I had health and limbs left I did not choose to trust the sea again but preferred my other new trade of gardening so I applied to a nurseryman near town and was received as a daylabourer I set myself cheerfully to work taking care to be in the grounds the first man in the morning and the last at night I acquainted my employer with all the practices I had observed in Morocco and got  him in return to instruct me in his own In time I came to be considered as a skilful workman and was advanced to higher wages My affairs were in a flourishing state I was well fed and comfortably lodged and saved money into the bargain About this time I fell in company with a young woman at service very notable and well behaved who seemed well qualified for a wise to a working man I ventured to make an offer to her which proved not disagreeable and after we had calculated a little how we were to live we married I took a cottage with an acre or two of land to it and my wife's savings furnished our house and bought a cow All my leisure time I spent upon my piece of ground which I made very productive and the profits of my cow with my wages supported us very well No mortal I think could be happier than I was after a hard day's  work by my own fireside with my wise beside me and our little infant on my knee  After this way of life had lasted two or three years a gentleman who had dealt largely with my master for young plants asked him if he could recommend an honest industrious man for a tenant upon some land that he had lately taken in from the sea My master willing to do me a kindness mentioned me I was tempted by the proposal and going down to view the premises I took a farm upon a lease at a low rent and removed my family and goods to it one hundred and fifty miles from London There was ground enough for money but much was left to be done for it in draining manuring and fencing Then it required more stock than I was able to furnish so though unwilling I was obliged to borrow some money of my landlord who  let me have it at moderate interest I began with good heart and worked late and early to put things in the best condition My first misfortune was that the place proved unhealthy to us I fell into a lingering ague which pulled me down much and hindered my business My wife got a slow fever and so did our eldest child we had now two and another coming The poor child died and what with grief and illness my wife had much ado to recover Then the rot got among my sheep and carried off the best part of my flock I bore up against distress as well as I could and by the kindness of my landlord was enabled to bring things tolerably about again We regained our health and began to be seasoned to the climate As we were cheering ourselves with the prospect of better times a dreadful storm aroseit was one night in FebruaryI shall never forget itand drove the spring tide  with such fury against our seabanks that they gave way The water rushed in with such force that all was presently a sea Two hours before daylight I was awaked by the noise of the waves dashing against our house and bursting in at the door My wife had lain in about a month and she and I and the two children slept on a ground floor We had just time to carry the children up stairs before all was afloat in the room When day appeared we could see nothing from the windows but water All the outhouses ricks and utensils were swept away and all the cattle and sheep drowned The sea kept rising and the force of the current bore so hard against our house that we thought every moment it must fall We clasped our babies to our breasts and expected nothing but present death At length we spied a boat coming to us With a good deal  of difficulty it got under our window and took us in with a servant maid and boy A few clothes was all the property we saved and we had not left the house half an hour before it fell and in a minute nothing was to be seen of it Not only the farmhouse but the farm itself was gone  I was now again a ruined man and what was worst I had three partners in my ruin My wife and I looked at one another and then at our little ones and wept Neither of us had a word of comfort to say At last thought I this country is not Morocco however Here are good souls that will pity our case and perhaps relieve us Then I have a character and a pair of hands Things are bad but they might have been worse I took my wife by the hand and knelt down She did the same I thanked God for his mercy in saving our lives and prayed that he would continue to protect us We  rose up with lightened hearts and were able to talk calmly about our condition It was my desire to return to my former master the nurseryman but how to convey my family so far without money was the difficulty Indeed I was much worse than nothing for I owed a good deal to my landlord He came down upon the news of the misfortune and though his own losses were heavy he not only forgave my debt and released me from all obligations but made me a small present Some charitable neighbours did the like but I was most of all affected by the kindness of our late maidservant who insisted upon our accepting of a crown which she had saved out of her wages Poor soul we had always treated her like one of ourselves and she felt for us like one  As soon as we had got some necessaries and the weather was tolerable we set out on our long march  My wife carried her infant in her arms I took the bigger child upon my back and a bundle of clothes in my hand We could walk but a few miles a day but we now and then got a lift in an empty waggon or cart which was a great help to us One day we met with a farmer returning with his team from market who let us ride and entered into conversation with me I told him of my adventures by which he seemed much interested and learning that I was skilled in managing trees he acquainted me that a nobleman in his neighbourhood was making great plantations and would very likely be glad to engage me and he offered to carry us to the place As all I was seeking was a living by my labour I thought the sooner I got it the better so I thankfully accepted his offer He took us to the nobleman's steward and made known our case The steward wrote to my old master for a character  and receiving a favourable one he hired me as a principal manager of a new plantation and settled me and my family in a snug cottage near it He advanced us somewhat for a little furniture and present subsistence and we had once more a  home  O Sir how many blessings are contained in that word to those who have known the want of it  I entered upon my new employment with as much satisfaction as if I was taking possession of an estate My wife had enough to do in taking care of the house and children so it lay with me to provide for all and I may say that I was not idle Besides my weekly pay from the steward I contrived to make a little money at leisure times by pruning and dressing gentlemen's fruit trees I was allowed a piece of waste ground behind the house for a garden and I spent a good deal of labour in bringing it  into order My old master sent me down for a present some choice young trees and flower roots which I planted and they throve wonderfully Things went on almost as well as I could desire The situation being dry and healthy my wife recovered her lost bloom and the children sprung up like my plants I began to hope that I was almost out of the reach of further misfortune but it was not so ordered  I had been three years in this situation and increased my family with another child when my Lord died He was succeeded by a very dissipated young man deep in debt who presently put a stop to the planting and improving of the estate and sent orders to turn off all the workmen This was a great blow to me however I still hoped to be allowed to keep my little house and garden and I thought I could then maintain myself  as a nurseryman and gardener But a new steward was sent down with directions to rack the tenants to the utmost He asked me as much rent for the place as if I had found the garden ready made to my hands and when I told him it was impossible for me to pay it he gave me notice to quit immediately He would neither suffer me to take away my trees and plants nor allow me any thing for them His view I found was to put in a favourite of his own and set him up at my expence I remonstrated against this cruel injustice but could obtain nothing but hard words As I saw it would be the ruin of me to be turned out in that manner I determined rather hastily to go up to London and plead my cause with my new Lord I took a sorrowful leave of my family and walking to the next market town I got a place on the outside of the stage coach  When we were within thirty or forty miles of London the coachman overturned the carriage and I pitched directly on my head and was taken up senseless Nobody knew any thing about me so I was carried to the next village where the overseer had me taken to the parish workhouse Here I lay a fortnight much neglected before I came to my senses As soon as I became sensible of my condition I was almost distracted in thinking of the distress my poor wife who was near lyingin must be under on my account not hearing any thing of me I lay another fortnight before I was fit to travel for besides the hurt on my head I had a broken collarbone and several bruises My money had somehow all got out of my pocket and I had no other means of getting away than by being passed to my own parish I returned in sad plight indeed and found my wife very ill in bed My  children were crying about her and almost starving We should now have been quite lost had I not raised a little money by selling our furniture for I was yet unable to work As soon as my wife was somewhat recovered we were forced to quit our house I cried like a child on leaving my blooming garden and flourishing plantations and was almost tempted to demolish them rather than another should unjustly reap the fruit of my labours But I checked myself and I am glad I did We took lodgings in a neighbouring village and I went round among the gentlemen of the country to see if I could get a little employment In the mean time the former steward came down to settle accounts with his successor and was much concerned to find me in such a situation He was a very able and honest man and had been engaged by another nobleman to superintend  a large improveable estate in a distant part of the kingdom He told me if I would try my fortune with him once more he would endeavour to procure me a new settlement I had nothing to lose and therefore was willing enough to run any hazard but I was destitute of means to convey my family to such a distance My good friend who was much provoked at the injustice of the new steward said so much to him that he brought him to make me an allowance for my garden and with that I was enabled to make another removal It was to the place I now inhabit  When I came here Sir all this farm was a naked common like that you crossed in coming My Lord got an enclosure bill for his part of it and the steward divided it into different farms and let it on improving leases to several tenants  A dreary spot to be sure it looked at first enough to sink a man's heart to sit down upon it I had a little unfinished cottage given me to live in and as I had nothing to stock a farm I was for some years employed as head labourer and planter about the new enclosures By very hard working and saving together with a little help I was at length enabled to take a small part of the ground I now occupy I had various discouragements from bad seasons and other accidents One year the distemper carried off four out of seven cows that I kept another year I lost two of my best horses A high wind once almost entirely destroyed an orchard I had just planted and blew down my biggest barn But I was too much used to misfortunes to be easily disheartened and my way always was to set about repairing them in the best manner I could and leave  the rest to Heaven This method seems to have answered at last I have now gone on many years in a course of continued prosperity adding field to field increasing my stock and bringing up a numerous family with credit My dear wife who was my faithful partner through so much distress continues to share my prosperous state and few couples in the kingdom I believe have more cause to be thankful for their lot This Sir is my history You see it contains nothing very extraordinary but if it impresses on the mind of this young gentleman the maxim that patience and perseverance will scarcely fail of a good issue in the end the time you have spent in listening to it will not entirely be lost  Mr  Carleton  thanked the good farmer very heartily for the amusement and instruction he had afforded them and took leave with many expressions  of regard  Theodore  and he walked home talking by the way of what they had heard  Next morning Mr  C  looking out of window saw  Theodore  hard at work in his garden He was carefully disinterring his buried flowers trimming and cleaning them and planting them anew He had got the gardener to cut a slip of the broken rosetree and set it in the middle to give it a chance for growing By noon every thing was laid smooth and neat and the bed was well filled All its splendour indeed was gone for the present but it seemed in a hopeful way to revive again  Theodore  looked with pleasure over his work but his father felt more pleasure in witnessing the first fruits of farmer  Hardman  's story  SEVENTEENTH EVENING  ON METALS  PART  George  and  Harry  with their Tutor one day in their walk were driven by the rain to take shelter in a blacksmith's shed The shower lasting some time the boys in order to amuse themselves began to examine the things around them The great bellows first attracted their notice and they admired the roaring it made and the expedition with which it raised the fire to a heat too intense for them to look at They were surprised at the dexterity with which the smith fashioned a bar of iron into a horseshoe first heating it then hammering it well on the anvil cutting off a proper length bending it  round turning up the ends and lastly punching the nailholes They watched the whole process of fitting it to the horse's foot and fastening it on and it had become fair some minutes before they shewed a desire to leave the shop and proceed on their walk  I could never have thought says  George  beginning the conversation that such a hard thing as iron could have been so easily managed  Nor I neither said  Harry    Tut  It was managed you saw by the help of fire The fire made it soft and flexible so that the smith could easily hammer it and cut it and bend it to the shape he wanted and then dipping it in water made it hard again  G  Are all other metals managed in the same manner  T  They are all worked by the help of fire in some way or other either in melting them or making them soft  G  There are a good many sorts of metals are there not  T  Yes several and if you have a mind I will tell you about them and their uses  G  Pray do Sir  H  Yes I should like to hear it of all things  T  Well then First let us consider what a metal is Do you think you should know one from a stone  G  A stoneYes I could not mistake a piece of lead or iron for a stone  T  How would you distinguish it  G  A metal is bright and shining  T  Truebrilliance is one of their qualities But glass and crystal are very bright too  H  But one may see through glass and not through a piece of metal  T  Right Metals are brilliant but opake or not transparent The thinnest plate of metal that can be made  will keep out the light as effectually as a stone wall  G  Metals are very heavy too  T  True They are the heaviest bodies in nature for the lightest metal is nearly twice as heavy as the heaviest stone Well what else  G  Why they will bear beating with a hammer which a stone would not without flying in pieces  T  Yes that property of extending or spreading under the hammer is called  malleability  and another like it is that of bearing to be drawn out into a wire which is called  ductility  Metals have both these and much of their use depends upon them  G  Metals will melt too  H  What will iron melt  T  Yes all metals will melt though some require greater heat than others The property of melting is called  fusibility  Do you know any thing more about them  G  No except that they come out of the ground I believe  T  That is properly added for it is the circumstance which makes them rank among  fossils  or minerals To sum up their character then a metal is a brilliant opake heavy malleable ductile and fusible mineral  G  I think I can hardly remember all that  T  The  names  may slip your memory but you cannot see metals at all used without being sensible of the  things  G  But what are  ores  I remember seeing a heap of iron ore which men were breaking with hammers and it looked only like stones  T  The  ore  of a metal is the state in which it is generally met with in the earth when it is so mixed with stony and other matters as not to show its proper qualities as a metal  H  How do people know it then  T  By experience It was probably accident that in the early ages discovered that certain fossils by the force of fire might be made to yield a metal The experiment was repeated on other fossils so that in length of time all the different metals were found out and all the different forms in which they lie concealed in the ground The knowledge of this is called  Mineralogy  and a very important science it is  G  Yes I suppose so for metals are very valuable things Our next neighbour Mr Sterling I have heard gets a great deal of money every year from his mines in Wales  T  He does The mineral riches of some countries are much superior to that of their products above ground and the revenues of many kings are in great part derived from their mines  H  I suppose they must be gold and silver mines  T  Those to be sure are the most valuable if the metals are found in tolerable abundance But do you know why they are so  H  Because money is made of gold and silver  T  That is a principal reason no doubt But these metals have intrinsic properties that make them highly valuable else probably they would not have been chosen in so many countries to make money of In the first place gold and silver are both  perfect metals  that is indestructible in the fire Other metals if kept a considerable time in the fire change by degrees into a powdery or scaly matter called a calx You have melted lead I dare say  G  Yes often  T  Have you not then perceived a drossy film collect upon its surface after it had been kept melting a while  G  Yes  T  That is a calx and in time the whole lead would change to such a substance You may see too when you have heated the poker redhot fome scales separate from it which are brittle and drossy  H  Yesthe kitchen poker is almost burnt away by putting it in the fire  T  WellAll metals undergo these changes except gold and silver but these if kept ever so long in the hottest fire sustain no loss or change They are therefore called  perfect metals  Gold has several other remarkable properties It is the heaviest of all metals  H  What is it heavier than lead  T  Yesabove half as heavy again It is between nineteen and twenty times heavier than an equal bulk of water This great weight is a ready means of discovering counterfeit gold coin  from genuine for as gold must be adulterated with something much lighter than itself a false coin if of the same weight with the true will be sensibly bigger Gold too is the most ductile of all metals You have seen leafgold  G  Yes I bought a book of it once  T  Leafgold is made by beating a plate of gold placed between pieces of skin with heavy hammers till it is spread out to the most degree of thinness And so great is its capacity for being extended that a single grain of the metal which would be scarce bigger than a large pin's head is beat out to a surface of fifty square inches  G  That is wonderful indeed but I know leaf gold must be very thin for it will almost float upon the air  T  By drawing gold out to a wire it may be still further extended Goldwire as it is called is made with silver overlaid with a small proportion of gold and they are drawn out together In the wire commonly used for laces and embroidery and the like a grain of gold is made completely to cover a length of three hundred and fiftytwo feet and when it is stretched still farther by slatting it will reach four hundred and one feet  H  Prodigious What a vast way a guinea might be drawn out then  T  Yes the gold of a guinea at that rate would reach above nine miles and a half This property in gold of being capable of extension to so extraordinary a degree is owing to its great tenacity or cohesion of particles which is such that you can scarcely break a piece of gold wire by twisting it and a wire of gold will sustain a greater weight  than one of any other metal equally thick  H  Then it would make very good wire for hanging bells  T  It would but such bellhanging would come rather too dear Another valuable quality of gold is its fine colour You know scarce any thing makes a more splendid appearance than gilding And a peculiar advantage of it is that gold is not liable to rust or tarnish as other metals are It will keep its colour fresh for a great many years in a pure and clear air  H  I remember the vane of the church steeple was new gilt two years ago and it looks as well as at first  T  This property of not rusting would render gold very useful for a variety of purposes if it were more common It would make excellent cooking utensils water pipes mathematical instruments clockwork and the like  G  But is not gold soft I have seen pieces of gold bent double  T  Yes it is next in softness to lead and therefore when it is made into coin or used for any common purposes it is mixed with a small proportion of some other metal in order to harden it This is called its  alloy  Our gold coin has onetwelfth part of alloy which is a mixture of silver and copper  G  How beautiful new gold coin is  T  Yesscarce any metal takes a stamp or impression better and it is capable of a very fine polish  G  What countries yield the most gold  T  South America the East Indies and the coast of Africa Europe affords but little yet a moderate quantity is got every year from Hungary  G  I have read of rivers rolling sands of gold Is there any truth in that  T  The poets as usual have greatly exaggerated the matter however there are various streams in different parts of the world the sands of which contain particles of gold and some of them in such quantity as to be worth the search  H  How does the gold come there  T  It is washed down along with the soil from mountains by the torrents which are the sources of rivers Some persons say that all sands contain gold but I would not advise you to take the pains to search for it in our common sand for in more senses than one  gold may be bought too dear  H  But what a fine thing it would be to find a gold mine on one's estate  T  Perhaps not so fine as you imagine for many a one does not pay the cost of working A coal pit would probably be a better thing Who do  you think are the greatest goldfinders in Europe  H  I don't know  T  The gypsies in Hungary A number of halfstarved halfnaked wretches of that community employ themselves in washing and picking the sands of some mountainstreams in that country which contain gold from which they obtain just profit enough to keep body and soul together whereas had they employed themselves in agriculture or manufactures they might have got a comfortable subsistence Gold almost all the world over is first got by slaves and it makes slaves of those who possess much of it  G  For my part I will be content with a silver mine  H  But we have none of those in England have we  T  We have no silver mines properly so called but silver is procured  in some of our lead mines There are however pretty rich silver mines in various parts of Europe but the richest of all are in Peru in South America  G  Are not the famous mines of Potosi there  T  They are Shall I now tell you some of the properties of silver  G  By all means  T  It is the other  perfect  metal It is also as little liable to rust as gold though indeed it readily gets tarnished  H  Yes I know our footman is often obliged to clean our plate before it is used  T  Plate however is not made of pure silver any more than silver coin and silver utensils of all kinds An alloy is mixed with it as with gold to harden it and that makes it more liable to tarnish  G  Bright silver I think is almost as beautiful as gold  T  It is the most beautiful of the white metals and is capable of a very fine polish and this together with its rarity makes it used for a great variety of ornamental purposes Then it is nearly as ductile and malleable as gold  G  I have had silverleaf and it seemed as thin as goldleaf  T  It is nearly so That is used for silvering as goldleaf is for gilding It is common too to cover metals with a thin coating of silver which is called plating  H  The child's saucepan is silvered over on the inside What is that for  T  To prevent the victuals from getting any taint from the metal of the saucepan for silver is not capable of being corroded or dissolved by any of  the liquids used for food as iron or copper are  H  And that is the reason I suppose that fruitknives are made of silver  T  It is but the softness of the metal makes them bear a very poor edge  G  Does silver melt easily  T  Silver and gold both melt more difficulty than lead not till they are above a common red heat As to the weight of silver it is nearly one half less than that of gold being only eleven times heavier than water  H  Is quicksilver a kind of silver  T  It takes its name from silver being very like it in colour but in reality it is a very different thing and one of the most singular of the metal kind  G  It is not  malleable  I am sure  T  No when it is quick or fluid as it always is in our climate But a very  great degree of cold makes it solid and then it is malleable like other metals  G  I have heard of  killing  quicksilver pray what does that mean  T  It means destroying its property of running about by mixing it with somewhat else Thus if quicksilver be well rubbed with fat or oil or gum it unites with them losing all its metallic appearance and fluidity It also unites readily with gold and silver and several other metals into the form of a kind of shining paste which is called an  amalgam  This is one of the ways of gilding or silvering a thing Your buttons are gilt by means of an amalgam  G  How is that done  T  The shells of the button which are made of copper are shaken in a hat with a lump of amalgam of gold and quicksilver till they are all covered over with it They are then put into a sort  of fryingpan and held over the fire The quicksilver being very volatile in its nature flies off in the form of a smoke or vapour when it is heated leaving the gold behind it spread over the surface of the button Thus many dozen are gilt at once with the greatest ease  H  What a clever way I should like vastly to see it done  T  You may see it any day at Birmingham if you happen to be there as well as a great many other curious operations on metals  G  What a weight quicksilver is I remember taking up a bottle full of it and I had like to have dropt it again it was so much heavier than I expected  T  Yes It is one of the heaviest of the metalsabout fifteen times heavier than water  G  Is not  mercury  a name for quicksilver I have heard them talk of  the mercury rising and falling in the weather glass  T  It is You perhaps may have heard too of  mercurial medicines  which are those made of quicksilver prepared in one manner or another  G  What are they good for  T  For a great variety of complaints Your brother took some lately for the worms and they are often given for breakingsout on the skin and for sores and swellings But they have one remarkable effect when taken in a considerable quantity which is to loosen the teeth and cause a great spitting This is called salivation  H  I used to think quicksilver was poison  T  When it is in its common state of running quicksilver it generally does neither good nor harm but it may be prepared so as to be a very violent medicine or even a poison  G  Is it useful for any thing else  T  Yesfor a variety of purposes in the arts which I cannot now very well explain to you But you will perhaps be surprised to hear that one of the finest red paints is made from quicksilver  G  A red paintwhich is that  T  Vermillion or cinnabar which is a particular mixture of sulphur with quicksilver  H  Is quicksilver found in this country  T  No The greatest quantity comes from Spain Istria and South America It is a considerable object of commerce and bears a high value though much inferior to silver Wellso much for metals at present We will talk of the rest on some future opportunity  THE PRICE OF A VICTORY  GOOD news great news glorious news cried young  Oswald  as he entered his father's house We have got a complete victory and have killed I don't know how many thousands of the enemy and we are to have bonfires and illuminations  And so said his father you think that killing a great many thousands of human creatures is a thing to be very glad about  Os  NoI do not quite think so neither but surely it is right to be glad that our country has gained a great advantage  F  No doubt it is right to wish well to our country as far as its prosperity can be promoted without injuring the rest of mankind But wars are very seldom to the real advantage of any  nation and when they are ever so useful or necessary so many dreadful evils attend them that a humane man will scarcely rejoice in them if he considers at all on the subject  Os  But if our enemies would do us a great deal of mischief and we prevent it by beating them have not we a right to be glad of it  F  Alas we are in general little judges which of the parties has the most mischievous intentions Commonly they are both in the wrong and success will make both of them unjust and unreasonable But putting that out of the question he who rejoices in the event of a battle rejoices in the misery of many thousands of his species and the thought of that should make him pause a little Suppose a surgeon were to come with a s  ling countenance and tell us triumphantly that he had cut off half a dozen  gs to daywhat would you think of    Os  I should think him very hardhearted  F  And yet those operations are done for the benefit of the sufferers and by their own desire But in a battle the probability is that none of those engaged on either side have any interest at all in the cause they are fighting for and most of them come there because they cannot help it In this battle that you are so rejoiced about there have been ten thousand men killed upon the spot and nearly as many wounded  Os  On both sides  F  Yesbut they are  men  on both sides Consider now that the ten thousand sent out of the world in this morning's work though they are past feeling themselves have left probably two persons each on an average to lament their loss either parents wives or children Here are then twenty thousand people made unhappy at one stroke on their account This however is hardly  so dreadful to think of as the condition of the wounded At the moment we are talking eight or ten thousand more are lying in agony torn with shot or gashed with cuts their wounds all festering some hourly to die a most excruciating death others to linger in torture weeks and months and many doomed to drag on a miserable existence for the rest of their lives with diseased and mutilated bodies  Os  This is shocking to think of indeed  F  When you light your candles then this evening  think what they cost  Os  But every body else is glad and seem to think nothing of these things  F  Truethey do  not  think of them If they did I cannot suppose they would be so void of feeling as to enjoy themselves in merriment when so many of their fellowcreatures are made miserable Do you not remember when  poor  Dickens  had his leg broken to pieces by a loaded waggon how all the town pitied him  Os  Yes very well I could not sleep the night after for thinking of him  F  But here are thousands suffering as much as he and we scarce bestow a single thought on them If any one of these poor creatures were before our eyes we should probably feel much more than we now do for all together Shall I tell you a story of a soldier's fortune that came to my own knowledge  Os  Yespray do  F  In the village where I went to school there was an honest industrious weaver and his wife who had an only son named  Walter  just come to man's estate  Walter  was a good and dutiful lad and a clever workman so that he was a great help to his parents One unlucky day having gone to the next  market town with some work he met with a companion who took him to the alehouse and treated him As he was coming away a recruiting serjeant entered the room who seeing  Walter  to be a likely young fellow had a great mind to entrap him He persuaded him to sit down again and take a glass with him and kept him in talk with fine stories about a soldier's life till  Walter  got fuddled before he was aware The serjeant then clapt a shilling in his hand to drink his majesty's health and told him he was enlisted He was kept there all night and next morning was taken before a magistrate to be sworn in  Walter  had now become sober and was very sorry for what he had done but he was told that he could not get off without paying a guinea smartmoney This he knew not how to raise and being likewise afraid and ashamed to face his friends he took the oath and bounty money and marched away with  the serjeant without ever returning home His poor father and mother when they heard of the affair were almost heartbroken and a young woman in the village who was his sweetheart had like to have gone distracted  Walter  sent them a line from the first stage to bid them farewell and comfort them He joined his regiment which soon embarked for Germany where it continued till the peace  Walter  once or twice sent word home of his welfare but for the last year nothing was heard of him  Os  Where was he then  F  You shall hear One summer's evening a man in an old red coat hobbling on crutches was seen to enter the village His countenance was pale and sickly his cheeks hollow and his whole appearance bespoke extreme wretchedness Several people gathered round him looking earnestly in his face Among these a young woman having gazed at him a  while cried out my  Walter  and sainted away  Walter  fell on the ground beside her His father and mother being fetched by some of the spectators came and took him in their arms weeping bitterly I saw the whole scene and shall never forget it At length the neighbours helped them into the house where  Walter  told them the following story  "At the last great battle that our troops gained in Germany I was among the first engaged and received a shot that broke my thigh I fell and presently after our regiment was forced to retreat A squadron of the enemy's horse came galloping down upon us A trooper making a blow at me with his sabre as I lay I lifted up my arm to save my head and got a cut which divided all the sinews at the back of my wrist Soon after the enemy were driven back and came across us again A horse set his foot on my side and  broke three of my ribs The action was long and bloody and the wounded on both sides were left on the field all night A dreadful night it was to me you may think I had fainted through loss of blood and when I recovered I was tormented with thirst and the cold air made my wounds smart intolerably About noon next day waggons came to carry away those who remained alive and I with a number of others was put into one to be conveyed to the next town The motion of the carriage was terrible for my broken bonesevery jolt went to my heart We were taken to an hospital which was crammed as full as it could hold and we should all have been suffocated with the heat and stench had not a fever broke out which soon thinned our numbers I took it and was twice given over however I struggled through But my wounds proved so difficult to heal that it was almost a twelvemonth before  I could be discharged A great deal of the bone of my thigh came away in splinters and left the limb crooked and useless as you see I entirely lost the use of three fingers of my right hand and my broken ribs made me spit blood a long time and have left a cough and difficulty of breathing which I believe will bring me to my grave I was sent home and discharged from the army and I have begged my way hither as well as I could I am told that the peace has left the affairs of my country just as they were before but who will restore me my health and limbs I am put on the list for a Chelsea pensioner which will support me if I live to receive it without being a burden to my friends That is all that remains for  Walter  now"  Os  Poor  Walter  What became of him afterwards  F  The wound of his thigh broke out afresh and discharged more splinters  after a great deal of pain and fever As winter came on his cough increased He wasted to a skeleton and died the next spring The young woman his sweetheart sat up with him every night to the last and soon after his death she fell into a consumption and followed him The old people deprived of the stay and comfort of their age fell into despair and poverty and were taken into the workhouse where they ended their days  This was the history of  Walter the Soldier  It has been that of thousands more and will be that of many a poor fellow over whose fate you are now rejoicing Such is the  price of a Victory  EIGHTEENTH EVENING  GOOD COMPANY  BESURE  Frederick  always keep  good company  was the final admonition of Mr  Lofty  on dismissing his son to the university  I intreat you  Henry  always to choose  good company  said Mr  Manly  on parting with his son to an apprenticeship in a neighbouring town  But it was impossible for two people to mean more differently by the same words  In Mr  Lofty  's idea good company was that of persons superior to ourselves in rank and fortune By this alone he estimated it and the degrees of comparison better and best were made  exactly to correspond to such a scale Thus if an esquire was  good  company a baronet was  better  and a lord  best of all  provided that he was not a  poor  lord for in that case a rich gentleman might be at least as good For as according to Mr  Lofty  's maxim the great purpose for which companions were to be chosen was to advance a young man in the world by their credit and interest those were to be preferred who afforded the best prospects in this respect  Mr  Manly  on the other hand understood by  good  company that which was improving to the morals and understanding and by the  best  that which to a high degree of these qualities added true politeness of manners As superior advantages in education to a certain point accompany superiority of condition he wished his son to prefer as companions those whose situation in life had afforded them the opportunity of being well educated but he was far from  desiring him to shun connections with worth and talents wherever he should find them  Mr  Lofty  had an utter aversion to  low company  by which he meant inferiors people of no fashion and figure shabby fellows whom nobody knows  Mr  Manly  equally disliked  low company  understanding by it persons of mean habits and vulgar conversation  A great part of Mr  Manly  's good company was Mr  Lofty  's low company and not a few of Mr  Lofty  's very best company were Mr  Manly  's very worst  Each of the sons understood his father's meaning and followed his advice  Frederick  from the time of his entrance at the University commenced what is called a  Tufthunter  from the tuft in the cap worn by young noblemen He took pains to insinuate himself into the good graces of all the young men of high fashion in his college  and became a constant companion in their schemes of frolic and dissipation They treated him with an insolent familiarity often bordering upon contempt but following another maxim of his father's  "one must stoop to rise"  he took it all in good part He totally neglected study as unnecessary and indeed inconsistent with his plan He spent a great deal of money with which his father finding that it went in  good company  at first supplied him freely In time however his expences amounted to so much that Mr  Lofty  who kept good company too found it difficult to answer his demands A considerable sum that he lost at play with one of his noble friends increased the difficulty If it were not paid the disgrace of not having discharged a  debt of honour  would lose him all the favour he had acquired yet the money could not be raised without greatly embarrassing his father's affairs  In the midst of this perplexity Mr  Lofty  died leaving behind him a large family and very little property  Frederick  came up to town and soon dissipated in  good company  the scanty portion that came to his share Having neither industry knowledge nor reputation he was then obliged to become an humble dependent on the great flattering all their follies and ministring to their vices treated by them with mortifying neglect and equally despised and detested by the rest of the world  Henry  in the mean time entered with spirit into the business of his new profession and employed his leisure in cultivating an acquaintance with a few select friends These were partly young men in a situation similar to his own partly persons already settled in life but all distinguished by propriety of conduct and improved understandings From all of them he learned somewhat valuable but he was more particularly  indebted to two of them who were in a station of life inferior to that of the rest One was a watchmaker an excellent mechanic and tolerable mathematician and well acquainted with the construction and use of all the instruments employed in experimental philosophy The other was a young druggist who had a good knowledge of chymistry and frequently employed himself in chymical operations and experiments Both of them were men of very decent manners and took a pleasure in communicating their knowledge to such as shewed a taste for similar studies  Henry  frequently visited them and derived much useful information from their instructions for which he ever expressed great thankfulness These various occupations and good examples effectually preserved him from the errors of youth and he passed his time with credit and satisfaction He had the same misfortune with  Frederick  just as he was ready  to come out into the world of losing his father upon whom the support of the family chiefly depended but in the character he had established and the knowledge he had acquired he found an effectual resource One of his young friends proposed to him a partnership in a manufacture he had just set up at considerable expence requiring for his share only the exertion of his talents and industry  Henry  accepted the offer and made such good use of the skill in mechanics and chymistry he had acquired that he introduced many improvements into the manufactory and rendered it a very profitable concern He lived prosperous and independent and retained in manhood all the friendships of his youth  THE DOG BAULKED OF HIS DINNER  A TALE  THINK yourself sure of nothing till you've got it  This is the lesson of the day  In metaphoric language I might say  Count not your bird before you've shot it  Quoth proverb "'twixt the cup and lip  There's many a slip"  Not every guest invited sits at table  So says  my  fable  A man once gave a dinner to his friend  His friendhis patron I should rather think  By all the loads of meat and drink  And fruits and jellies without end  Sent home the morning of the feast  Jowler  his dog a social beast  Soon as he smelt the matter out away  Scampers to old acquaintance  Tray  And with expressions kind and hearty  Invites him to the party  Tray  wanted little pressing to a dinner  He was in truth a gormandizing sinner  He lick'd his chops and wagg'd his tail  Dear friend he cried I will not fail  But what's your hour  We dine at four  But if you come an hour too soon  You'll find there's something to be done  His friend withdrawn  Tray  full of glee  As blithe as blithe could be  Skipt danc'd and play'd full many an antic  Like one half frantic  Then sober in the sun lay winking  But could not sleep for thinking  He thought o'er every dainty dish  Fried boil'd and roast  Flesh fowl and fish  With tripes and toast  Fit for a dog to eat  And in his fancy made a treat  Might grace a bill of fare  For my Lord May'r  At length just on the stroke of three  Forth sallied he  And thro' a wellknown hole  He slily stole  Pop on the scene of action  Here he beheld with wondrous satisfaction  All hands employ'd in drawing stuffing  Skewering spitting and basting  The redfac'd cook sweating and puffing  Chopping mixing and tasting  Tray  skulk'd about now here now there  And peep'd in this and smelt at that  And lick'd the gravy and the fat  And cried O rare how I shall fare  But Fortune spiteful as Old Nick  Resolv'd to play our dog a trick  She made the cook  Just cast a look  Where  Tray  beneath the dresser lying  His promis'd bliss was eyeing  A cook while cooking is a sort of fury  A maxim worth rememb'ring I assure ye  Tray  found it true  And so may you  If e'er you chuse to try  How now quoth she what's this I spy  A nasty cur who let him in  Would he were hang'd with all his kin  A pretty kitchen guest indeed  But I shall pack him off with speed  So saying on poor  Tray  she flew  And dragg'd the culprit forth to view  Then to his terror and amazement  Whirl'd him like lightning thro' the casement  THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS  TutorGeorgeHarry  H  WHAT plant is that man gathering under the hedge  G  I don't know but boys call the stalks kexes and blow through them  H  I have seen them but I want to know the plant  G  Will you please to tell us Sir what it is  T  It is hemlock  G  Hemlock is poison is it not  T  Yes in some degree and it is also a medicine That man is gathering it for the apothecaries  H  I should like to know it  T  Well thengo and bring one    Harry  fetches it  G  I think I have seen a great many of this sort  T  Perhaps you may but there are many other kinds of plants extremely like it It is one of a large family called the  umbelliferous  which contains both food physic and poison It will be worth while for you to know something about them so let us examine this hemlock closely You see this tall hollow stalk which divides into several branches from each of which spring spokes or  rundles  as they are called of flowerstalks You see they are like rays from a circle or the spokes of a wheel  H  Or like the sticks of an umbrella  T  True and they are called  umbels  which has the same derivationIf you pursue one of these rundles or umbels you will find that each stick or spoke terminates in another set of smaller stalks each of which bears a single small flower  G  They are small ones indeed  T  But if you look sharply I dare say your eyes are good enough to distinguish that they are divided into five leaves and furnished with five chives and two pistils in the middle  H  I can see them  G  And so can I  T  The pistils are succeeded by a sort of fruit which is a twin seed joined in the middle as you may see in this rundle that is past flowering Here I divide one of them into two  G  Would each of these grow  T  Yes Wellthis is the structure of the flowering part of all the umbelliferous tribe Now for the leaf Pluck one  H  Is this one leaf or many  T  It is properly one but it is cut and divided into many portions From this midrib spring smaller leaves set opposite each other and from the rib of each of these proceed others  which themselves are also divided These are called doubly or trebly pinnated leaves and most of the umbelliferous plants but not all have leaves of this kind  H  It is like a parsley leaf  T  Trueand parsley is one of the same tribe and hemlock and others are sometimes mistaken for it  G  How curiously the stalk of this hemlock is spotted  T  Yes That is one of the marks by which it is known It is also distinguished by its peculiar smell and by other circumstances which you can only understand when you have compared a number of the tribe I will now tell you about some others the names of which you are probably acquainted with In the first place there are carrots and parsnips  H  Carrots and parsnipsthey are not poisons I am sure  G  I remember now that carrots have such a leaf as this  T  They have It is the  roots  of these you know that are eaten But we eat the  leaves  of parsley and fennel which are of the same class Celery is another the  stalks  of which are chiefly used made white by trenching up the earth about them The stalks of Angelica are used differently  H  I know howcandied  T  Yes Then there are many of which the  seeds  are used There is carraway  H  What the seeds that are put in cakes and comfits  T  Yes They are warm and pungent to the taste and so are the seeds of many others of the umbelliferous plants as coriander fennel wild carrot angelica anise cummin and dill All these are employed in food or medicine and are good for warming or strengthening the stomach  G  Those are pleasant medicines enough  T  They are but you will not say the same of some others of the class which are noted medicines too such as the plant yielding asafetida and several more from which what are called the fetid gums are produced  G  Asafetidathat's nasty stuff I know does it grow here  T  No and most of the sweet seeds I before mentioned come from abroad too Now I will tell you of some of the poisons  H  Hemlock is one that we know already  T  Yes Then there is another kind that grows in water and is more poisonous called WaterHemlock Another is a large plant growing in ditches with leaves extremely like celery called HemlockDropwort Another common in drier situations and distinguished by leaves less divided  than most of the class is CowParsnep or Madnep Of some of these the leaves of others the roots are most poisonous Their effects are to make the head giddy bring on stupidity or delirium and cause violent sickness The Athenians used to put criminals to death by making them drink the juice of a kind of hemlock growing in that country as you may read in the life of that excellent philosopher Socrates who was killed in that manner  H  What was he killed for  T  Because he was wiser and better than his fellowcitizens Among us it is only by accident that mischief is done by these plants I remember a melancholy instance of a poor boy who in rambling about the fields with his little brothers and sisters chanced to meet with a root of HemlockDropwort It looked so white and nice that he was tempted to eat a good deal of it  The other children also eat some but not so much When they got home they were all taken very ill The eldest boy who had eat most died in great agony The others recovered after suffering a great deal  G  Is there any way of preventing their bad effects  T  The best way is to clear the stomach as soon as possible by a strong vomit and large draughts of warm water After that vinegar is useful in removing the disorder of the head  H  But are the roots sweet or pleasant that people should be tempted to eat them  T  Several of them are There is a small plant of the tribe the root of which is much sought after by boys who dig for it with their knives It is round and called earthnut or pignut  G  But that is not poison I suppose  T  No but it is not very wholesome I believe however that the roots of the most poisonous become innocent by boiling I have heard that boiled hemlock roots are as good as carrots  H  I think I should not like to eat them however But pray why should there be any poisons at all  T  What we call poisons are only hurtful to particular animals They are the proper food of others and no doubt do more good than hurt in the creation Most of the things that are poisonous to us in large quantities are useful medicines in small ones and we have reason bestowed upon  us  to guard us against mischief Other animals in general refuse by instinct what would prove hurtful to them You see beneath yonder hedge a great crop of tall flourishing plants with white flowers They are of the umbelliferous family and are called wild Cicely or Cowweed The latter name is given  them because the cows will not touch them though the pasture be ever so bare  H  Would they poison them  T  Perhaps they would at least they are not proper food for them We will go and examine them and I will show you how they differ from hemlock for which they are sometimes mistaken  G  I should like to get some of these plants and dry them  T  You shall and write down the names of them all and learn to know the innocent from the hurtful  G  That will be very useful  T  It will Remember now the general character of the umbelliferous class The flowerstalks are divided into spokes or umbels which are again divided into others each of them terminated by a small fiveleaved flower having five chives and two pistils succeeded  by a twin seed Their leaves are generally finely divided You will soon know them after having examined two or three of the tribe Remember too that they are a  suspicious race  and not to be made free with till you are well acquainted with them  THE KID  ONE bleak day in March  Sylvia  returning from a visit to the sheepfold met with a young kidling deserted by its dam on the naked heath It was bleating piteously and was so benumbed with the cold that it could scarcely stand  Sylvia  took it up in her arms and pressed it close to her bosom She hastened home and showing her little foundling to her parents begged she might rear it for her own They consented  and  Sylvia  immediately got a basket full of clean straw and made a bed for him on the hearth She warmed some milk and held it to him in a platter The poor creature drank it up eagerly and then licked her hand for more  Sylvia  was delighted She chafed his slender legs with her warm hands and soon saw him jump out of his basket and frisk across the room When full he lay down again and took a comfortable nap  The next day the kid had a name bestowed upon him As he gave tokens of being an excellent jumper it was  Capriole  He was introduced to all the rest of the family and the younger children were allowed to stroke and pat him but  Sylvia  would let nobody be intimate with him but herself The great mastiff was charged never to hurt him and indeed he had no intention to do it  Within a few days  Capriole  followed  Sylvia  all about the house trotted by her side into the yard ran races with her in the home field fed out of her hand and was a declared pet and favourite As the spring advanced  Sylvia  roamed in the fields and gathered wild flowers with which she wove garlands and hung them around her kid's neck He could not be kept however from munching his finery when he could reach it with his mouth He was likewise rather troublesome in thrusting his nose into the mealtub and flourbox and following people into the dairy and sipping the milk that was set for cream He now and then got a blow for his intrusion but his mistress always took his part and indulged him in every liberty  Capriole  's horns now began to bud and a little white beard sprouted at the end of his chin He grew bold enough to put himself in a fighting posture  whenever he was offended He butted down little  Colin  into the dirt quarreled with the geese for their allowance of corn and held many a stout battle with the old turkeycock Every body said  Capriole  is growing too saucy he must be sent away or taught better manners But  Sylvia  still stood his friend and he repaid her love with many tender caresses  The farmhouse where  Sylvia  lived was situated in a sweet valley by the side of a clear stream bordered with trees Above the house rose a sloping meadow and beyond that was an open common covered with purple heath and yellow furze Further on at some distance rose a steep hill the summit of which was a bare craggy rock scarcely accessible to human feet  Capriole  ranging at his pleasure often got upon the common and was pleased with browzing the short grass and wild herbs which grew there Still however  when his mistress came to seek him he would run bounding at her call and accompany her back to the farm  One fine summer's day  Sylvia  after having finished the business of the morning wanted to play with her kid and missing him she went to the side of the common and called aloud  Capriole Capriole  expecting to see him come running to her as usual No  Capriole  came She went on and on still calling her kid with the most endearing accents but nothing was to be seen of him Her heart began to flutter What can be become of him Surely somebody must have stolen himor perhaps the neighbour's dogs have worried him Oh my poor  Capriole  my dear  Capriole  I shall never see you againand  Sylvia  began to weep  She still went on on looking wistfully all around and making the place echo with  Capriole Capriole  where are you my  Capriole  till at length she  came to the foot of the steep hill She climbed up its sides to get a better view No kid was to be seen She sat down and wept and wrung her hands After a while she fancied she heard a bleating like the wellknown voice of her  Capriole  She started up and looked towards the sound which seemed a great way over head At length she spied just on the edge of a steep crag her  Capriole  peeping over She stretched out her hands to him and began to call but with a timid voice lest in his impatience to return to her he should leap down and break his neck But there was no such danger  Capriole  was inhaling the fresh breeze of the mountains and enjoying with rapture the scenes for which nature designed him His bleating was the expression of joy and he bestowed not a thought on his kind mistress nor paid the least attention to her call  Sylvia  ascended as high as she could towards him and called louder  and louder but all in vain  Capriole  leaped from rock to rock cropt the fine herbage in the clefts and was quite lost in the pleasure of his new existence  Poor  Sylvia  staid till she was tired and then returned disconsolate to the farm to relate her misfortune She got her brothers to accompany her back to the hill and took with her a slice of white bread and some milk to tempt the little wanderer home But he had mounted still higher and had joined a herd of companions of the same species with whom he was frisking and sporting He had neither eyes nor ears for his old friends of the valley All former habits were broken at once and he had commenced free commoner of nature  Sylvia  came back crying as much from vexation as sorrow The little ungrateful thing said sheso well as I loved him and so kindly as I treated him to  desert me in this way at lastBut he was always a rover  Take care then  Sylvia  said her mother how you set your heart upon  rovers  again  HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT  Robinet  a peasant of Lorrain after a hard day's work at the next markettown was returning home with a basket in his hand What a delicious supper shall I have said he to himself This piece of kid well stewed down with my onions sliced thickened with my meal and seasoned with my salt and pepper will make a dish fit for the bishop of the diocese Then I have a good piece of a barley loaf at home to finish with How I long to be at it  A noise in the hedge now attracted his notice and he spied a squirrel nimbly  running up a tree and popping into a hole between the branches Ha thought he what a nice present a nest of young squirrels will be to my little master I'll try if I can get it Upon this he set down his basket in the road and began to climb up the tree He had half ascended when casting a look at his basket he saw a dog with his nose in it ferreting out the piece of kid's flesh He made all possible speed down but the dog was too quick for him and ran off with the meat in his mouth  Robinet  looked after himWell said he then I must be content with soupmeagreand no bad thing neither  He travelled on and came to a little public house by the road side where an acquaintance of his was sitting on a bench drinking He invited  Robinet  to take a draught  Robinet  seated himself by his friend and set his basket on the bench close by him A tame  raven which was kept at the house came slily behind him and perching on the basket stole away the bag in which the meal was tied up and hopped off with it to his hole  Robinet  did not perceive the theft till he had got on his way again He returned to search for his bag but could hear no tidings of it Well says he my soup will be the thinner but I will boil a slice of bread with it and that will do it some good at least  He went on again and arrived at a little brook over which was laid a narrow plank A young woman coming up to pass at the same time  Robinet  gallantly offered her his hand As soon as she was got to the middle either through fear or sport she shrieked out and cried she was falling  Robinet  hastening to support her with his other hand let his basket drop into the stream As soon as she was safe over he jumped in and recovered it but when he took it  out he perceived that all the salt was melted and the pepper washed away Nothing was now left but the onions Well says  Robinet  then I must sup tonight upon roasted onions and barley bread Last night I had the bread alone Tomorrow morning it will not signify what I had So saying he trudged on singing as before  NINETEENTH EVENING  EYES AND NO EYES OR THE ART OF SEEING  WELL  Robert  where have you been walking this afternoon said Mr  Andrews  to one of his pupils at the close of a holiday  R  I have been Sir to Broomheath and so round by the windmill upon Campmount and home through the meadows by the river side  Mr  A  Well that's a pleasant round  R  I thought it very dull Sir I scarcely met with a single person I had rather by half have gone along the turnpike road  Mr  A  Why if seeing men and horses is your object you would indeed be better entertained on the highroad But did you see  William  R  We set out together but he lagged behind in the lane so I walked on and left him  Mr  A  That was a pity He would have been company for you  R  O he is so tedious always stopping to look at this thing and that I had rather walk alone I dare say he is not got home yet  Mr  A  Here he comes Well  William  where have you been  W  O Sir the pleasantest walk I went all over Broomheath and so up to the mill at the top of the hill and then down among the green meadows by the side of the river  Mr  A  Why that is just the round  Robert  has been taking and he complains of its dullness and prefers the highroad  W  I wonder at that I am sure I hardly took a step that did not delight me and I have brought my handkerchief full of curiosities home  Mr  A  Suppose then you give us some account of what amused you so much I fancy it will be as new to  Robert  as to me  W  I will Sir The lane leading to the heath you know is close and sandy so I did not mind it much but made the best of my way However I spied a curious thing enough in the hedge It was an old crabtree out of which grew a great bunch of something green quite different from the tree itself Here is a branch of it  Mr  A  Ah this is Misseltoe a plant of great fame for the use made of it by the Druids of old in their religious rites and incantations It bears a very slimy white berry of which birdlime may be made whence its Latin name of  Viscus  It is one of those plants  which do not grow in the ground by a root of their own but fix themselves upon other plants whence they have been humorously styled  parasitical  as being hangerson or dependants It was the misseltoe of the oak that the Druids particularly honoured  W  A little further on I saw a green woodpecker fly to a tree and run up the trunk like a cat  Mr  A  That was to seek for insects in the bark on which they live They bore holes with their strong bills for that purpose and do much damage to the trees by it  W  What beautiful birds they are  Mr  A  Yes they have been called from their colour and size the English parrot  W  When I got upon the open heath how charming it was The air seemed so fresh and the prospect on every side so free and unbounded Then it was all covered with gay flowers  many of which I had never observed before There were at least three kinds of heath I have got them in my handkerchief here and gorse and broom and bellflower and many others of all colours that I will beg you presently to tell me the names of  Mr  A  That I will readily  W  I saw too several birds that were new to me There was a pretty greyish one of the size of a lark that was hopping about some great stones and when he flew he showed a great deal of white above his tail  Mr  A  That was a wheatear They are reckoned very delicious birds to eat and frequent the open downs in Sussex and some other counties in great numbers  W  There was a flock of lapwings upon a marshy part of the heath that amused me much As I came near them some of them kept flying round and round just over my head and crying  pewit  so distinctly one might almost fancy they spoke I thought I should have caught one of them for he flew as if one of his wings was broken and often tumbled close to the ground but as I came near he always made a shift to get away  Mr  A  Ha ha you were finely taken in then This was all an artifice of the bird's to entice you away from its nest for they build upon the bare ground and their nests would easily be observed did not they draw off the attention of intruders by their loud cries and counterfeit lameness  W  I wish I had known that for he led me a long chase often over shoes in water However it was the cause of my falling in with an old man and a boy who were cutting and piling up turf for fewel and I had a good deal of talk with them about the manner of preparing the turf and the price it sells at They gave me too a creature I never  saw beforea young viper which they had just killed together with its dam I have seen several common snakes but this is thicker in proportion and of a darker colour than they are  Mr  A  True Vipers frequent those turfy boggy grounds pretty much and I have known several turfcutters bitten by them  W  They are very venomous are they not  Mr  A  Enough so to make their wounds painful and dangerous though they seldom prove fatal  W  WellI then took my course up to the windmill on the mount I climbed up the steps of the mill in order to get a better view of the country round What an extensive prospect I counted fifteen church steeples and I saw several gentlemen's houses peeping out from the midst of green woods and plantations and I could trace the windings of the river all along the low  grounds till it was lost behind a ridge of hills But I'll tell you what I mean to do Sir if you will give me leave  Mr  A  What is that  W  I will go again and take with me Carey's county map by which I shall probably be able to make out most of the places  Mr  A  You shall have it and I will go with you and take my pocket spying glass  W  I shall be very glad of that Wella thought struck me that as the hill is called  Campmount  there might probably be some remains of ditches and mounds with which I have read that camps were surrounded And I really believe I discovered something of that sort running round one side of the mount  Mr  A  Very likely you might I know antiquaries have described such remains as existing there which some suppose to be Roman others Danish  We will examine them further when we go  W  From the hill I went straight down to the meadows below and walked on the side of a brook that runs into the river It was all bordered with reeds and flags and tall flowering plants quite different from those I had seen on the heath As I was getting down the bank to reach one of them I heard something plunge into the water near me It was a large waterrat and I saw it swim over to the other side and go into its hole There were a great many large dragonflies all about the stream I caught one of the finest and have got him here in a leaf But how I longed to catch a bird that I saw hovering over the water and every now and then darting down into it It was all over a mixture of the most beautiful green and blue with some orange colour It was somewhat less than a thrush  and had a large head and bill and a short tail  Mr  A  I can tell you what that bird wasa kingfisher the celebrated halcyon of the ancients about which so many tales are told It lives on fish which it catches in the manner you saw It builds in holes in the banks and is a shy retired bird never to be seen far from the stream where it inhabits  W  I must try to get another sight of him for I never saw a bird that pleased me so much WellI followed this little brook till it entered the river and then took the path that runs along the bank On the opposite side I observed several little birds running along the shore and making a piping noise They were brown and white and about as big as a snipe  Mr  A  I suppose they were sandpipers one of the numerous family of birds that get their living by wading  among the shallows and picking up worms and insects  W  There were a great many swallows too sporting upon the surface of the water that entertained me with their motions Sometimes they dashed into the stream sometimes they pursued one another so quick that the eye could scarcely follow them In one place where a high steep sandbank rose directly above the river I observed many of them go in and out of holes with which the bank was bored full  Mr  A  Those were sandmartins the smallest of our four species of swallows They are of a mousecolour above and white beneath They make their nests and bring up their young in these holes which run a great depth and by their situation are secure from all plunderers  W  A little further I saw a man in a boat who was catching eels in an odd way He had a long pole with  broad iron prongs at the end just like Neptune's trident only there were five instead of three This he pushed straight down among the mud in the deepest parts of the river and fetched up the eels sticking between the prongs  Mr  A  I have seen this method It is called spearing of eels  W  While I was looking at him a heron came flying over my head with his large flagging wings He lit at the next turn of the river and I crept softly behind the bank to watch his motions He had waded into the water as far as his long legs would carry him and was standing with his neck drawn in looking intently on the stream Presently he darted his long bill as quick as lightning into the water and drew out a fish which he swallowed I saw him catch another in the same manner He then took alarm at some noise I made and flew away slowly to a wood at some distance where he settled  Mr  A  Probably his nest was there for herons build upon the loftiest trees they can find and sometimes in society together like rooks Formerly when these birds were valued for the amusement of hawking many gentlemen had their  heronries  and a few are still remaining  W  I think they are the largest wild birds we have  Mr  A  They are of a great length and spread of wing but their bodies are comparatively small  W  I then turned homeward across the meadows where I stopt awhile to look at a large flock of starlings which kept flying about at no great distance I could not tell at first what to make of them for they rose all together from the ground as thick as a swarm of bees and formed themselves into a kind of black cloud hovering over the field After taking a short round they settled again and presently rose again  in the same manner I dare say there were hundreds of them  Mr  A  Perhaps so for in the fenny countries their flocks are so numerous as to break down whole acres of reeds by settling on them This disposition of starlings to fly in close swarms was remarked even by Homer who compares the foe flying from one of his heroes to a  cloud  of stares retiring dismayed at the approach of the hawk  W  After I had left the meadows I crossed the corn fields in the way to our house and passed close by a deep marle pit Looking into it I saw in one of the sides a cluster of what I took to be shells and upon going down I picked up a clod of marle which was quite full of them but how sea shells could get there I cannot imagine  Mr  A  I do not wonder at your surprise since many philosophers have been much perplexed to account for the same appearance It is not uncommon  to find great quantities of shells and relics of marine animals even in the bowels of high mountains very remote from the sea They are certainly proofs that the earth was once in a very different state from what it is at present but in what manner and how long ago these changes took place can only be guessed at  W  I got to the high field next our house just as the sun was setting and I stood looking at it till it was quite lost What a glorious sight The clouds were tinged purple and crimson and yellow of all shades and hues and the clear sky varied from blue to a fine green at the horizon But how large the sun appears just as it sets I think it seems twice as big as when it is over head  Mr  A  It does so and you may probably have observed the same apparent enlargement of the moon at its rising  W  I have but pray what is the reason of this  Mr  A  It is an optical deception depending upon principles which I cannot well explain to you till you know more of that branch of science But what a number of new ideas this afternoon's walk has afforded you I do not wonder that you found it amusing it has been very instructive too Did  you  see nothing of all these sights  Robert  R  I saw some of them but I did not take particular notice of them  Mr  A  Why not  R  I don't know I did not care about them and I made the best of my way home  Mr  A  That would have been right if you had been sent of a message but as you only walked for amusement it would have been wiser to have sought out as many sources of it as possible But so it isone man walks through the world  with his eyes open and another with them shut and upon this difference depends all the superiority of knowledge the one acquires above the other I have known sailors who had been in all the quarters of the world and could tell you nothing but the signs of the tipplinghouses they frequented in different ports and the price and quality of the liquor On the other hand a Franklin could not cross the channel without making some observations useful to mankind While many a vacant thoughtless youth is whirled throughout Europe without gaining a single idea worth crossing a street for the observing eye and inquiring mind finds matter of improvement and delight in every ramble in town or country Do  you  then  William  continue to make use of your eyes and  you Robert  learn that eyes were given you to use  WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN  PapaLucy  P  YOU remember Lucy that I explained to you some time ago what was the cause that things fell to the ground  L  O yesIt was because the ground drew them to it  P  True That is a consequence of the universal law in nature that bodies attract each other in proportion to their bulk So a very small thing in the neighhourhood of a very large one always tends to go to it if not prevented by some other power WellYou know I told you that the sun was a ball a vast many times bigger than the ball we inhabit called the earth upon which you properly asked how then it  happened that the earth did not fall into the sun  L  And why does it not  P  That I am going to explain to you You have seen your brother whirl round an ivory ball tied to the end of a string which he held in his hand  L  YesAnd I have done it myself too  P  Well thenyou felt that the ball was continually pulling as if it tried to make its escape  L  Yes and one my brother was swinging  did  make its escape and flew through the sash  P  It did so That was a lesson in the  centrifugal  motion or that power by which a body thus whirled continually endeavours to fly off from the centre round which it moves This is owing to the force or impulse you give it at setting out as if you were going to throw it away from you The string  by which you hold it on the contrary is the power which keeps the ball towards the centre called the  centripetal  power Thus you see there are two powers acting upon the ball at the same time one to make it fly off the other to hold it in and the consequence is that it moves directly according to neither but between both that is round and round This it continues to do while you swing it properly but if the string breaks or slips off away flies the ball on the other hand if you cease to give it the whirling force it falls towards your hand  L  I understand all this  P  I will give you another instance of this double force acting at the same time Do not you remember seeing some curious feats of horsemanship  L  Yes  P  One of them was that a man standing with one leg upon the saddle and riding full speed threw up balls  into the air and catched them as they fell  L  I remember it very well  P  Perhaps you would have expected these balls to have fallen behind him as he was going at such a rate  L  So I did  P  But you saw that they fell into his hand as directly as if he had been standing quite still That was because at the instant he threw them up they received the motion of the horse straight forwards as well as the upright motion that he gave them so that they made a slanting line through the air and came down in the same place they would have reached if he had held them in his hand all the while  L  That is very curious indeed  P  In the same manner you may have observed in riding in a carriage that if you throw any thing out of the window it falls directly opposite just  as if the carriage was standing still and is not left behind you  L  I will try that the next time I ride in one  P  You are then to imagine the sun to be a mighty mass of matter many thousand times bigger than our earth placed in the centre quiet and unmoved You are to conceive our earth as soon as created launched with vast force in a straight line as if it were a bowl on a green It would have flown off in this line for ever through the boundless regions of space had it not at the same instant received a pull from the sun by its attraction By the wonderful skill of the Creator these two forces were made exactly to counterbalance each other so that just as much as the earth from the original motion given it tends to fly forwards just so much the sun draws it to the centre and the consequence is that it takes a course  between the two which is a circle round and round the sun  L  But if the earth was set a rolling like a bowl upon a green I should think it would stop of itself as the bowl does  P  The bowl stops because it is continually rubbing against the ground which checks its motion but the ball of the earth moves in empty space where there is nothing to stop it  L  But if I throw a ball through the air it will not go on for ever but it will come down to the ground  P  That is because the force with which you can throw it is much less than the force by which it is drawn to the earth But there is another reason too which is the resistance of the air This space all around us and over us is not empty space it is quite full of a thin transparent fluid called air  L  Is it  P  Yes If you move your hand quickly through it you will find something resisting you though in a slight degree And the wind you well know is capable of pressing against any thing with almost irresistible force and yet wind is nothing but a quantity of air put into violent motion Every thing then that moves through the air is continually obliged to push some of this fluid out of the way by which means it is constantly losing part of its motion  L  Then the earth would do the same  P  No for it moves in  empty space  L  What does not it move through the air  P  The earth does not move  through  the air but carries the air along with it All the air is contained in what is called the  atmosphere  which you may compare to a kind of mist or fog clinging all round to the ball of the earth and  reaching to a certain distance above it which has been calculated at about fortyfive miles  L  That is above the clouds then  P  Yes all the clouds are within the atmosphere for they are supported by the air Wellthis atmosphere rolls about along with the earth as if it were a part of it and moves with it through the sky which is a vast field of empty space In this immense space are all the stars and planets which have also their several motions There is nothing to stop them but they continually go on by means of the force that the Creator has originally impressed upon them  L  Do not some of the stars move round the sun as well as our earth  P  Yes those that are called  planets  These are all subject to the same laws of motion with our earth They are attracted by the sun as their centre and form along with the earth that assemblage  of worlds which is called the  solar system  L  Is the moon one of them  P  The moon is called a  secondary  planet because its immediate connexion is with our earth round which it rolls as we do round the sun It however accompanies our earth in its journey round the sun But I will tell you more about its motion and about the other planets and stars another time It is enough at present if you thoroughly understand what I have been describing  L  I think I do  DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR SUNDAY MORNING  IT was Sunday morning All the bells were ringing for church and the streets were filled with people moving in all directions  Here numbers of welldressed persons and a long train of charity children were thronging in at the wide doors of a large handsome church There a smaller number almost equally gay in dress were entering an elegant meetinghouse Up one alley a Roman Catholic congregation was turning into their retired chapel every one crossing himself with a finger dipt in holywater as he went in The opposite side of the street was covered with a train of quakers distinguished by their plain and  neat attire and sedate aspect who walked without ceremony into a room as plain as themselves and took their seats the men on one side and the women on the other in silence A spacious building was filled with an overflowing crowd of Methodists most of them meanly habited but decent and serious in demeanour while a small society of Baptists in the neighbourhood quietly occupied their humble place of assembly  Presently the different services began The churches resounded with the solemn organ and with the indistinct murmurs of a large body of people following the minister in responsive prayers From the meetings were heard the slow psalm and the single voice of the leader of their devotions The Roman Catholic chapel was enlivened by strains of music the tinkling of a small bell and a perpetual change of service and ceremonial A profound silence and unvarying look and posture  announced the selfrecollection and mental devotion of the Quakers  Mr  Ambrose  led his son  Edwin  round all these different assemblies as a spectator  Edwin  viewed every thing with great attention and was often impatient to inquire of his father the meaning of what he saw but Mr  Ambrose  would not suffer him to disturb any of the congregations even by a whisper When they had gone through the whole  Edwin  found a great number of questions to put to his father who explained every thing to him in the best manner he could At length says  Edwin  But why cannot all these people agree to go to the same place and worship God the same way  And why should they agree replied his father Do not you see that people differ in a hundred other things Do they all dress alike and eat and drink alike and keep the same hours and use the same diversions  Aybut those are things in which they have a right to do as they please  And they have a right too to worship God as they please It is their own business and concerns none but themselves  But has not God ordered particular ways of worshipping him  He has directed the mind and spirit with which he is to be worshipped but not the particular form and manner That is left for every one to choose according as suits his temper and opinions All these people like their own way best and why should they leave it for the choice of another Religion is one of the things in which  mankind were made to differ  The several congregations now began to be dismissed and the street was again overspread with persons of all the different sects going promiscuously to their respective homes It chanced that a poor man fell down in the street  in a fit of apoplexy and lay for dead His wife and children stood round him crying and lamenting in the bitterest distress The beholders immediately flocked round and with looks and expressions of the warmest compassion gave their help A Churchman raised the man from the ground by lifting him under the arms while a Dissenter held his head and wiped his face with his handkerchief A Roman Catholic lady took out her smelling bottle and assiduously applied it to his nose A Methodist ran for a doctor A Quaker supported and comforted the woman and a Baptist took care of the children  Edwin  and his father were among the spectators Here said Mr  Ambrose  is a thing in which  mankind were made to agree  TWENTIETH EVENING  ON METALS  PART  TutorGeorgeHarry  F  WELLhave you forgot what I told you about metals the other day  G  O no  H  I am sure I have not  T  What metals were they that we talked about  G  Gold silver and quicksilver  T  Suppose then we go on to the rest  G  Pray do  H  Yes by all means  T  Very well You know  copper  I don't doubt  G  O yes  T  What colour do you call it  G  I think it is a sort of reddish brown  T  True Sometimes however it is of a bright red like sealing wax It is not a very heavy metal being not quite nine times the weight of water It is pretty ductile bearing to be rolled or hammered out to a very thin plate and also to be drawn out to a fine wire  H  I remember seeing a halfpenny that had been rolled out to a long ribbon  G  Yes and I have seen half a dozen men at a time with great hammers beating out a piece of copper at the brazier's  T  Copper requires a very considerable heat to melt it and by long exposure to the fire it may be burned  or calcined for it like all we are now to speak of is an  imperfect  metal  H  And it rusts very easily does it not  T  It does for all acids dissolve or corrode it so do salts of every kind whence even air and common water in a short time act upon it for they are never free from somewhat of a saline nature  G  Is not verdegris the rust of copper  T  It isa rust produced by the acid of grapes But every rust of copper is of a blue or green colour as well as verdegris  H  And are they all poison too  T  They are all so in some degree producing violent sickness and pain in the bowels They are all too extremely nauseous to the taste and the metal itself when heated tastes and smells very disagreeably  G  Why is it used then so much in cooking and brewing and the like  T  Because it is a very convenient metal for making vessels especially large ones as it is easily worked and is sufficiently strong though hammered thin and bears the fire well And if vessels of it are kept quite clean and the liquor not suffered to stand long in them when cold there is no danger in their use But copper vessels for cooking are generally lined on the inside with tin  G  What else is copper used for  T  A variety of things Sheets of copper are sometimes used to cover buildings and of late a great quantity is consumed in sheathing ships that is in covering all the part under water the purpose of which is to protect the timber from the worms and also to make the ship sail faster by means of the greater smoothness and force with  which the copper makes way through the water  H  Money is made of copper too  T  It is for it takes an impression in coining very well and its value is a proper proportion below silver for a a price for the cheapest sort of commodities In some poor countries they have little other than copper coin Another great use of copper is as an ingredient in mixed metals such as bellmetal cannonmetal and particularly brass  H  But brass is yellow  T  True it is converted to that colour by means of another metallic substance named  zinc  or  spelter  the natural colour of which is white A kind of brown stone called  calamine  is an ore of zinc By filling a pot with layers of powdered calamine and charcoal placed alternately with copper and applying a pretty strong heat the zinc is driven in vapour out of the calamine  and penetrates the copper changing it into brass  G  What is the use of turning copper into brass  T  It gains a fine goldlike colour and becomes harder more easy to melt and less liable to rust Hence it is preferred for a variety of utensils ornamental and useful Brass does not bear hammering well but is generally cast into the shape wanted and then turned in a lathe and polished Wellthese are the principal things I have to say about copper  H  But where does it come from  T  Copper is found in many countries Our island yields abundance especially in Wales and Cornwall In Anglesey is a whole hill called Parismountain consisting of copper ore from which immense quantities are dug every year Now for  iron  H  Ay that is the most useful of all the metals  T  I think it is and it is likewise the most common for there are few countries in the world possessing hills and rocks where it is not met with more or less Iron is the hardest of metals the most elastic or springy the most tenacious or difficult to break next to gold the most difficultly fusible and one of the lightest being only seven or eight times heavier than water  G  You say it is difficult to break but I snapt the blade of a penknife the other day by only bending it a little and my mother is continually breaking her needles  T  Properly objected But the qualities of iron differ extremely according to the method of preparing it There are forged iron cast iron and steel which are very different from each other Iron when first melted from its ore has little malleability and the vessels and other implements that are made of it in that state by casting into moulds are  easily broken It acquires toughness and malleability by  forging  which is done by beating it when red hot with heavy hammers till it becomes ductile and flexible Steel again is made by heating small bars of iron with woodashes charcoal bone and horn shavings or other inflammable matters by which it acquires a finer grain and more compact texture and becomes harder and more elastic Steel may be rendered either very flexible or brittle by different manners of  tempering  which is performed by heating and then quenching it in water Steel is iron in its more perfect state  G  All cutting instruments are made of steel are they not  T  Yes and the very fine edged ones are generally tempered brittle as razors penknives and surgeon's instruments but swordblades are made flexible and the best of them will bend double without breaking or becoming  crooked The steel of which springs are made have the highest possible degree of elasticity given them A watchspring is one of the most perfect examples of this kind Steel for ornaments is made extremely hard and closegrained so as to bear an exquisite polish Common hammered iron is chiefly used for works of strength as horseshoes bars bolts and the like It will bend but not straighten itself again as you may see in the kitchen poker Cast iron is used for pots and cauldrons cannons cannonballs grates pillars and many other purposes in which hardness without flexibility is wanted  G  What a vast variety of uses this metal is put to  T  Yes I know not when I should have done if I were to tell you of all  H  Then I think it is really more valuable than gold though it is so much cheaper  T  That was the opinion of the wise Solon when he observed to the rich king Croesus who was showing him his treasures  "he who possesses more iron will soon be master of all this gold"  H  I suppose he meant weapons and armour  T  He did but there are many nobler uses of this metal and few circumstances denote the progress of the arts in a country more than having attained the full use of iron without which scarcely any manufacture or machinery can be brought to perfection From the difficulty of melting it out of the ore many nations have been longer in discovering it than some of the other metals The Greeks in Homer's time seem to have employed copper or brass for their weapons much more than iron and the Mexicans and Peruvians who possessed gold and silver were unacquainted with iron when the Spaniards invaded them  G  Iron is very subject to rust however  T  It is so and that is one of its worst properties Every liquor and even a moist air corrodes it But the rust of iron is not pernicious on the contrary it is a very useful medicine  G  I have heard of steel drops and steel filings given for medicines  T  Yes iron is given in a variety of forms and the property of them all is to strengthen the constitution Many springs are made medicinal by the iron that they dissolve in the bowels of the earth These are called  chalybeate  waters and they may be known by their inky taste and the rustcoloured sediment they leave in their course  H  May we drink such water if we meet with it  T  Yes it will do you no harm at least There is one other property of iron well worth knowing and that is  that it is the only thing attracted by the magnet or loadstone  G  I had a magnet once that would take up needles and keys but it seemed a bar of iron itself  T  True The real loadstone which is a particular ore of iron can communicate its virtue to a piece of iron by rubbing it nay a bar of iron itself in length of time by being placed in a particular position will acquire the same property  G  Is all the iron used in England produced here  T  By no means Our extensive manufactures require a great importation of iron Much is brought from Norway Russia and Sweden and the Swedish is reckoned particularly excellent Wellnow to another metal I dare say you can tell  me  a good deal about  lead  H  I know several things about it It is very heavy and soft and easily melted  T  True those are some of its distinguishing properties Its weight is between eleven and twelve times that of water Its colour is a dull bluish white and from this livid hue as well as its being totally void of spring or elasticity it has acquired a sort of character of dulness and sluggishness Thus we say of a stupid man that he has a  leaden  disposition  G  Lead is very malleable I think  T  Yes it may be beat out into a pretty thin leaf but it will not bear drawing into fine wire It is not only very fusible but very readily calcined by heat changing into a powder or a sealy matter which may be made to take all colours by the fire from yellow to deep red You have seen red lead  G  Yes  T  That is calcined lead exposed for a considerable time to a strong flame Lead may even be changed into glass by a moderate heat and there is a good deal of it in our finest glass  G  What is white lead  T  It is lead corroded by the steam of vinegar Lead in various forms is much used by painters Its calces dissolve in oil and are employed for the purpose of thickening paint and making it dry All lead paints however are unwholesome as long as they continue to smell and the fumes of lead when melted are likewise pernicious This is the cause why painters and plumbers are so subject to various diseases particularly violent colics and palsies The whitelead manufacture is so hurtful to the health that the workmen in a very short time are apt to lose the use of their limbs and be otherwise severely indisposed  H  I wonder then that anybody will work in them  T  Ignorance and high wages are sufficient to induce them But it is to be lamented that in a great many manufactures the health and lives of individuals are sacrificed to the convenience and profit of the community Lead too when dissolved as it may be in all four liquors is a slow poison and the more dangerous as it gives no disagreeable taste A salt of lead made with vinegar is so sweet as to be called the sugar of lead It has been too common to put this or some other preparation of lead into four wines in order to cure them and much mischief has been done by this practice  G  If lead is poisonous is it not wrong to make waterpipes and cisterns of it  T  This has been objected to but it does not appear that water can dissolve any of the lead Nor does it readily rust in the air and hence it is much used to cover buildings with as well as  to line spouts and watercourses For these purposes the lead is cast into sheets which are easily cut and hammered into any shape  H  Bullets and shot too are made of lead  T  They are and in this way it is ten times more destructive than as a poison  G  I think more lead seems to be used than any metal except iron  T  It is and the plenty of it in our country is a great benefit to us both for domestic use and as an article that brings in much profit by exportation  G  Where are our principal leadmines  T  They are much scattered about our island The west of England produces a good deal in Cornwall Devonshire and Somersetshire Wales affords a large quantity Derbyshire has long been noted for its leadmines and so have Northumberland and Durham  And there are considerable ones in the southern part of Scotland Now do you recollect another metal to be spoken about  G  Tin  T  True Tin resembles lead in colour but has a more silvery whiteness It is soft and flexible like lead but is distinguished by the crackling noise it makes on being bent It melts as easily as lead and also is readily calcined by keeping it in the fire It is the lightest of the metals being only seven times heavier than water Tin may be beat into a thin leaf but not drawn out to wire  G  Is tin of much use  T  It is not often used by itself but very frequently in conjunction with other metals As tin is little liable to rust or to be corroded by common liquors it is employed for a lining or coating of vessels made of copper or  iron The saucepans and kettles in the kitchen you know are all tinned  G  Yes How is it done  T  By melting the tin and spreading it upon the surface of the copper which is first lightly pitched over in order to make the tin adhere  H  But what are the vessels made at the tinman's Are not they all tin  T  No  Tinned  ware as it is properly called is made of thin iron plates coated over with tin by dipping them into a vessel full of melted tin These plates are afterwards cut and bent to proper shapes and the joinings are soldered together with a mixture of tin and other metals Another similar use of tin is in what is called the silvering of pins  G  Whatis not that real silvering  T  No The pins which are made of brass wire after being pointed and headed are boiled in water in which graintin  is put along with tartar which is a crust that collects on the inside of wine casks The tartar dissolves some of the tin and makes it adhere to the surface of the pins and thus thousands are covered in an instant  H  That is as clever as what you told us of the gilding of buttons  T  It is Another purpose for which great quantities of tin used to be employed was the making of pewter The best pewter consists chiefly of tin with a small mixture of other metals to harden it and the London pewter was brought to such perfection as to look almost as well as silver  G  I can just remember a long row of pewter plates at my grandmother's  T  You may In her time all the plates and dishes for the table were made of pewter and a handsome range of pewter shelves was thought a capital ornament for a kitchen At present this trade is almost come to nothing through  the use of earthen ware and china and pewter is employed for little but stills and barber's basons and porter pots But a good deal is still exported Tin is likewise an ingredient in other mixed metals for various purposes but on the whole less of it is used than of the other common metals  G  Is not England more famous for tin than any other country I have read of the Phoenicians trading here for it in very early times  T  They did and tin is still a very valuable article of export from England Much of it is sent as far as China The tinmines here are chiefly in Cornwall and I believe they are the most productive of any in Europe Very fine tin is also got in the peninsula of Malacca in the East Indies Wellwe have now gone through the metals  G  But you said something about a kind of metal called zinc  T  That is one of another class of mineral substances called  semimetals  These resemble metals in every quality but ductility of which they are almost wholly destitute and for want of it they can seldom be used in the arts except when joined with metals  G  Are there many of them  T  Yes several but we will not talk of them till I have taken some opportunity of showing them to you for probably you may never have seen any of them Now try to repeat the names of all the metals to me in the order of their weight  H  There is first  gold  G  Then  quicksilver lead silver  H  Copper iron tin  T  Very right Now I must tell you of an odd fancy that chymists have had of christening these metals by the names of the heavenly bodies They have called gold  Sol  or the Sun  G  That is suitable enough to its colour and brightness  H  Then silver should be the moon for I have heard moonlight called of a silvery hue  T  Trueand they have named it so It is  Luna  Quicksilver is  Mercury  so named probably from its great propensity to dance and jump about for  Mercury  you know was very nimble  G  Yeshe had wings to his heels  T  Copper is  Venus  G  Venus  surely it is scarcely beautiful enough for that  T  But they had disposed of the most beautiful ones before Iron is  Mars  H  That is right enough because swords are made of iron  T  True Then tin is  Jupiter  and lead  Saturn  I suppose only to make out the number Yet the dulness of lead might be thought to agree with that planet which is most remote from  the sun These names childish as they may seem are worth remembering since chymists and physicians still apply them to many preparations of the various metals You will probably often hear of  martial lunar mercurial  and  saturnine  and you may now know what they mean  G  I think the knowledge of metals seems more useful than all you have told us about plants  T  I don't know that Many nations make no use at all of metals but there are none which do not owe a great part of their subsistence to vegetables However without enquiring what parts of natural knowledge are  most  useful you may be assured of this that all are useful in some degree or other and there are few things that give one man greater superiority over another than the extent and accuracy of his knowledge in these particulars One person passes all his life upon the earth a  stranger to it while another finds himself at home every where  WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR  PRAY Papa said  Sophia  after she had been a long while teased with the flies that buzzed about her ears and settled on her nose and forehead as she sat at workPray what were flies made for  For some good I dare say replied her Papa  S  But I think they do a great deal more harm than good for I am sure they plague me sadly and in the kitchen they are so troublesome that the maids can hardly do their work for them  P  Flies eat up many things that would otherwise corrupt and become  loathsome and they serve sor food to birds spiders and many other animals  S  But we could clean away every thing that was offensive without their help and as to their serving for food I have seen whole heaps of them lying dead in a window without seeming to have done good to any thing  P  Well then Suppose a fly capable of thinking would he not be equally puzzled to find out what men were good for This great twolegged monster he might say instead of helping us to live devours more food at a meal than would serve a whole legion of flies Then he kills us by hundreds when we come within his reach and I see him destroy and torment all other animals too And when he dies he is nailed up in a box and put a great way under ground as if he grudged doing any more good after his death than when alive  Now what would you answer to such a reasoning fly  S  I would tell him he was very impertinent for talking so of his betters for that he and all other creatures were made for the use of man and not man for theirs  P  But would you tell him true You have just been saying that you could not find out of what use flies were to us whereas when they suck our blood there is no doubt that we are of use to them  S  It is that which puzzles me  P  There are many other animals which we call  noxious  and which are so far from being useful to us that we take all possible pains to get rid of them More than that there are vast tracts of the earth where few or no men inhabit which are yet full of beasts birds insects and all living things These certainly do not exist there for his use alone  On the contrary they often keep man away  S  Then what are they made for  P  They are made to be happy It is a manifest purpose of the Creator to give being to as much life as possible for life is enjoyment to all creatures in health and in possession of their faculties Man surpasses other animals in his powers of enjoyment and he has prospects in a future state which they do not share with him But the Creator equally desires the happiness of all his creatures and looks down with as much benignity upon these flies that are sporting around us as upon ourselves  S  Then we ought not to kill them if they are ever so troublesome  P  I do not say that We have a right to make a reasonable use of all animals for our advantage and also to free ourselves from such as are hurtful to us So far our superiority over them may fairly extend But we should never  abuse them for our mere amusement nor take away their lives wantonly Nay a goodnatured man will rather undergo a  little  inconvenience than take away from a creature all that it possesses An infant may destroy life but all the kings upon earth cannot restore it I remember reading of a goodtempered old gentleman that having been a long time plagued with a great fly that buzzed about his face all dinnertime at length after many efforts caught it Instead of crushing it to death he held it carefully in his hand and opening the window  "Go said heget thee gone poor creature I wo'nt hurt a hair of thy head surely the world is wide enough for thee and me"  S  I should have loved that man  P  One of our poets has written some very pretty lines to a fly that came to partake with him of his wine They begin  Busy curious thirsty fly  Drink with me and drink as I  Welcome freely to my cap  Could'st thou sip and sip it up  S  How pretty I think they will almost make me love flies But pray Papa do not animals destroy one another  P  They do indeed The greatest part of them only live by the destruction of life There is a perpetual warfare going on in which the stronger prey upon the weaker and in their turns are the prey of those which are a degree stronger than themselves Even the innocent sheep with every mouthful of grass destroys hundreds of small insects In the air we breathe and the water we drink we give death to thousands of invisible creatures  S  But is not that very strange If they were created to live and be happy why should they be destroyed so fast  P  They are destroyed no faster than others are produced and if they enjoyed life while it lasted they have had a good bargain By making animals the food of animals providence has filled up every chink as it were of existence You see these swarms of flies During all the hot weather they are continually coming forth from the state of eggs and maggots and as soon as they get the use of wings they roam about and fill every place in search of food Meantime they are giving sustenance to the whole race of spiders they maintain all the swallow tribe and contribute greatly to the support of many other small birds and even afford many a delicate morsel to the fishes Their own numbers however seem scarcely diminished and vast multitudes live on till the cold weather comes and puts an end to them Were nothing to touch them they would probably become so numerous as to starve  each other As it is they are full of enjoyment themselves and afford life and enjoyment to other creatures which in their turn supply the wants of others  S  It is no charity then to tear a spider's web in pieces in order to set a fly at liberty  P  None at allno more than it would be to demolish the traps of a poor Indian hunter who depended upon them for his dinner They both act as nature directs them Shall I tell you a story  S  O yespray do  P  A venerable Bramin who had never in his days eaten any thing but rice and milk and held it the greatest of crimes to shed the blood of any thing that had life was one day meditating on the banks of the Ganges He saw a little bird on the ground picking up ants as fast as he could swallow Murderous wretch cried he what scores  of lives are sacrificed to one gluttonous meal of thine Presently a sparrowhawk pouncing down seized him in his claws and flew off with him The Bramin at first was inclined to triumph over the little bird but on hearing his cries he could not help pitying him Poor thing said he thou art fallen into the clutches of thy tyrant A stronger tyrant however took up the matter for a falcon in midair darting on the sparrowhawk struck him to the ground with the bird lifeless in his talon Tyrant against tyrant thought the Bramin is well enough The falcon had not finished tearing his prey when a lynx stealing from behind the rock on which he was perched sprung on him and having strangled him bore him to the edge of a neighbouring thicket and began to suck his blood The Bramin was attentively viewing this new display of retributive justice when a sudden roar shook the air and a huge tyger rushing  from the thicket came like thunder on the lynx The Bramin was near enough to hear the crashing bones and was making off in great terror when he met an English soldier armed with his musket He pointed eagerly to the place where the tyger was making his bloody repast The soldier levelled his gun and laid the tyger dead Brave fellow exclaimed the Bramin I am very hungry said the soldier can you give me a beefsteak I see you have plenty of cows here Horrible cried the Bramin what I kill the sacred cows of Brama Then kill the next tyger yourself said the soldier  THE END
