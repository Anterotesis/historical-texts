 THE SHAKSPEARE GALLERY  c  ERRATUM  P l  for  o'erblane'd  read  o'erblanch'd  THE SHAKSPEARE GALLERY A POEM BY MR JERNINGHAM  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ROBSON NEW BONDSTREET  MDCCXCI  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN BOYDELL LORD MAYOR OF THE CITY OF LONDON THIS POEM IS INSCRIBED BY HIS OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT  EDW  D  JERNINGHAM  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following Poem does not pass any judgment upon the Pictures that are now exhibited in the Gallery but attempts to point out new subjects for future exhibitions And in the delineation of new subjects attention is paid to the principle laid down by our great Painter in his notes to the translation of Fresnoy by Mr MASON  That palpable situation is preferable to curious sentiment as the Painter speaks to the eye  The encouragement that is now so liberally extended to Painting will soon decide the question  Whether or no our Painters are adequate to the task they are called upon to perform MACKLIN'S exhibition is also a splendid and arduous undertaking It is another Lyceum in which riyal Artists may contend for fame and emolument  SHAKSPEARE GALLERY  c  As mus'd the Prophet near mild CHEBAR'S stream  EZEKIEL Chap th    And pray'd his God to dart th' enlight'ning gleam  Abruptdescending from his airy height  A form angelic rush'd upon his sight  With smiling lip he cheer'd the hallow'd Sire  And bad his soul to Heav'n's best gift aspire  Then with strong hand he grasp'd his silver hair  And swift convey'd him thro' the yielding air  Along th' unwinged region of the sky  The dread mysterious deep abyss on high  There Inspiration her bright cloud withdrew  And pour'd her visions on his daring view  Then on his rapturekindled eye arose  Those forms of splendor those terrific shows  With which he peopled his celestial dream  And swell'd his proud magnificence of theme  To ENGLAND's Leading Bard thus Genius came  Envelop'd in a robe of holy flame  And bore him with a whirlwind's rapid force  Beyond the solar road and starry course  From which far tow'ring and tremendous height  While now he hovers with suspended flight  The Poet view'd as on a spacious plain  Of human passions the long shadowy train  As flings the noonsun his clear beams from high  On the dim tribes he darts his radiant eye  'Twas then the favor'd Bard receiv'd the lore  Whose mystic veil was ne'er remov'd before  That revelation to his instinct giv'n  That ray from GOD the energy of Heav'n  To his illumin'd sight was then consign'd  The deep recesses of the Human Mind  The evervarying path of tortuous Art  And the dark passage to the Tyrant's heart  Th' umbrageous winding of the thorny road  That leads to quickey'd Jealousy's abode  The gath'ring storms that o'er Resentment roll  The swelling waves that toss the fearful soul  The calm that breathes around the Infant's rest  The rugged cavern of the Murd'rer's breast  The dread materials by the Furies brought  With which are forg'd Despair's tempestuous thought  The shaft that mingling pleasure with the pain  Bathes in the blood that warms the Lover's vein  Oh Thou th' IMPERIAL GENIUS of our land  Take a fresh garland from thy country's hand  Triumphs unknown she hastens to proclaim  And stamp a newborn era on thy fame  Too long as with the iron power of Fate  Hath Custom bolted the Historic Gate  Enlighten'd BOYDELL bursts th' opposing bar  On their rude hinge the pond'rous portals jar  While the rapt Arts salute with loud acclaim  This rich accession to their rising name  Genius of PAINTING thy bright car ascend  Bid glowing Energy thy steps attend  Triumphant ride thro' th' unrifled land  And seize thy plunder with victorious hand  Thou too who favor'st the Promethean toil  Genius of SCULPTURE share the sacred spoil  Let Fancy lift thy blazing urn on high  Whose flame thy bold hand ravish'd from the sky  And on its side with flow'rets breathing round  Let the immortal name of BANKS be found  See the altorelievo in the front of the gallery which does honor to modern Statuary  Oft have we heard the pure of taste complain  Of mawkish Portraiture's eternal reign  Of exhibitions which the art disgrace  And pall the eye with many a vacant face  Let Miniature erect her fairy school  And 'mid her gewgaws unmolested rule  Let her bright dome each pleas'd Narcissus seek  To her let Beauty hold her summer cheek  In fond allusion to the month of May  Let her the youthful bride's gay form display  Let her delineate on her iv'ry plane  The nuptial simper of the happy swain  From these we turn to scenes of higher aim  Where EagleGenius soars to nobler game  Where Fancy Reason Taste in one conjoin'd  Unfold the workings of th' impassion'd mind  Now to the laurell'd academic band  To ev'ry artist's emulative hand  Munificence upholds her sacred prize  And bids the daring reach it from the skies  While Expectation lifts the thought on high  Methinks I view with a prophetic eye  In solemn state ascend that splendid Dome  Where the proud Arts shall find an equal home  Where at the opening of some glorious day  The English mind its treasures shall display  While they whose taste is sway'd by Rigor's rule  Shall mark the wonders of the Albion School  Another gallery is to be erected for the purpose of receiving the whole collection when completed  If time shou'd e'er obliterate the gold  Of SHAKSPEARE'S language cast in Vigor's mould  Here shall invested in their various guise  The throng of his departed Forms arise  The splendid forms his mind luxuriant drew  The bold creations he held forth to view  As from their grave shall burst the num'rous host  And on these walls a new existence boast  Here shall be seen in all its charms array'd  Th' impressive figure of VERONA's maid  JULIET  Clos'd in the dreary vault where sleep the dead  Wrapp'd in the nightdress of the fun'ral bed  She breaks abruptly from her iron trance  And sends around a terrorrolling glance  A mournful solitary lamp shall throw  A sickly glimm'ring o'er the house of woe  And shall the wretched PARIS give to view  Stretch'd on te ground with mien of ghastly hue  Then shall a deeper spectacle display  And hang o'er ROMEO with reluctant ray  Disclosing his wan lips devoid of breath  And faintros'd cheek still beautiful in death  Then shall the beam with weaken'd effort shed  A fading glory on the FRIAR's head  She too shall ornament the pictur'd scene  The destin'd victim of ITALIAN spleen  IMOGEN    See the base wretch perform his treach'rous part  With all the subtlety of finish'd art  Behold him bending o'er the sleeping maid  Her holy form to his research betray'd  Eager some secret notice to retai  With rav'nous aim he lifts the slender veil  And leering marks by Nature's hand imprest  The mole cinquespotted on her snowy breast  Whose scatter'd drops to the rapt eye excel  The crimson spots within the cowslip's bell  Here too as patient as the meekey'd dove  Shall stand the maid who "never told her love  VIOLA  "  Who to her coy and fearful bosom true  As th' unseen worm that pales the blossom's hue  Still let concealment on her beauty prey  Like snow dissolving silently away  Beneath the roof of a monastic pile  Thro' the recesses of the length'ning isle  A monument shall strike the mournful eye  An imag'd Pity shall stand drooping nigh  And where the lov'd lamented ashes sleep  Unruffled Patience her long vigil keep  Now at the magic Painter's wild command  Girt with the sea ascends th' Enchanted Land  There stands Simplicity's endearing child  MIRANDA    That artless Maid the flow'ret of the wild  Beside the margin of the wavevex'd shore  While all around conflicting thunders roar  With unbound tresses flutt'ring to the wind  Her eye expressive of her tortur'd mind  She views the vessel by the surges tost  Now seennow lostnow foundnow once more lost  Till madly rushing on the pointed rock  Its bosom riven with the forceful shock  Beyond the stretch of naval art to save  Down down it hurries to the watery grave  Now PROSPERO comes with magic arts endu'd  His sable garb with hieroglyphics strew'd  Long care long study solitude profound  Has deepen'd on his brow reflection's wound  His longdescending hair o'erblanch'd with age  Becomes the Sorc'rer and adorns the Sage  Ah view him at that dread momentous hour  While he abjures his necromantic pow'r  Within the ring of Incantation's ground  Elves Fairies Spirits Demons flock around  Beneath his foot behold the potent wand  Doom'd ne'er again to grace his lifted hand  Behold the volume which with myst'ry fraught  Predestination's darkling edicts taught  And breath'd its solemn whispers on the mind  With dust o'erspread and to neglect consign'd  Yet then the distant scenery imparts  A dire remembrance of his former arts  The bright sun fading in his full career  The wild stars madly starting from their sphere  The stormencumber'd sky the swelling main  Th' uprooted cedars stretching o'er the plain  The mountain loosen'd by convulsive throe  With ruin rushing to the vale below  And the pale wretch reversing Nature's doom  Abruptly rising from the rifted tomb  What glowing Artist with bold hand shall claim  To draw oh ARIEL thy resplendent frame  Thou tricksy Spirit with benignant smile  Thou playful meteor of th' Enchanted Isle  Not like a seanymph rob'd in sickly green  With dappled wings as on the Stage thou'rt seen  A gay transparency shalt thou appear  Thy form celestial melting into air  With foot lighttouching some fantastic height  Prompt to depart and stretching to thy flight  Yet ere we sail from this Enchanted Isle  Let other scenes our ling'ring steps beguile  There stands ANTHONIO the suggesting fiend  And half reveals his purpose to his friend  His bosom swells his madd'ning eyeballs roll  And shew the workings of his inmost soul  All that his lawless wild conceptions dare  In various forms hang hov'ring in the air  A sword freshtainted with ALONZO's blood  A sceptre swimming in a crimson flood  A crown with dazzling ornaments o'erspread  And lightly floating o'er SEBASTIAN's head  While in the distance rising o'er the bay  Imperial Naples shall her tow'rs display  Lo now advancing on the mimic scence  Comes forth to view the fam'd Egyptian Queen  ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA Act st Scene d at the end    While anxious doubts her Soldier's mind perplex  Behold her rise instructive to her sex  Ah not superior for the female heart  Endures with fortitude the suff'ring part  Tow'ring beyond the flight of tim'rous love  She bids her Warrior from her sight remove  She points her finger to the martial plain  Points to the active and the daring train  The threat'ning axes which the Fasces bear  The gorgeous streamers swelling to the air  Of busy legions the thick murm'ring swarms  The thronging shields and highemblazon'd arms  Th' encumbering elephant the rapid steed  And spoils of former conquest Glory's meed  Flush'd Conquest riding in his trophied car  And all the dread magnificence of war  Now shall the fell tremendous act be done  The Thane  MACBETH  appearsthe warning clock strikes One  His daring wild imaginings create  Such the hot chaos of his mental state  The air born dagger and display to view  The point obscene distain'd with crimson hue  Still as we gaze shall new creations rise  And varying sceneries prolong surprise  Ere yet the skylark leaves his lowly bed  Bright on the mistencircled mountain's head  See jocund Day on airy tiptoe strand  And ope the gates of Heav'n with radiant hand  Now like two lions litter'd

While PRIAM bending at the weight of age  Rever'd parental patriarchal Sage  Half credits half rejects the tragic tale  Till terrors o'er his fading hopes prevail  Whence yonder radiant form that charms the eye  'Tis Expectation riding thro' the sky  A swordlike instrument she waves around  Enwreath'd with coronets with chaplets bound  Prepar'd for HENRY and his faithful train  Eager to urge
