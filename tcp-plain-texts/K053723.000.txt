Attendant on the Queen  Miss BRANGIN  KNIGHTS SOLDIERS PEASANTS c  SCENE a Castle and its Vicinity situated in a Forest in Germany  TO THE Queen's most Excellent Majesty THIS OPERA IS HUMBLY DEDICATED By HER MAJESTY's Most faithful and Most obedient Subject  LEO MACNALLY  Temple  Nov    PREFACE  THIS Opera was written upon the spur of the occasion a circumstance which may palliate though not excuse its faults The subject of the fable remains as in the original but a few alterations have been made in its construction and the writer has attempted to heighten the characters by a colouring of humour  FEW pieces have experienced a more extraordinary persecution Previous to its appearance the Manager and Writer were pestered with anonymous letters threatening its destruction by the force of party for their daring to attempt an emulous opposition to the Romance under the same title then preparing at  Drury Lane  and after it appeared several of the prints teemed with severe animadversions and abuse  ONE critic displayed his judgment with great ingenuity and candour he opened his old school satchell and quoted both Greek and Latin to point out passages analogous to classic ideas every literal error of the press was produced and animadverted on with astonishing ability he found prosaic lines in the poetry and poetic thoughts in the prose but above all he made this great discovery that the sentiments of  loyalty  breathed through the dialogue were inimical to the British constitution  As men of sensibility  feel  when their generosity is brought forward this critic shall not be put to the blush but be permitted to indulge in the secret satisfaction arising from his friendly exertions  RICHARD COEUR DE LION A COMIC OPERA  The Songs marked thus {inverted ⁂} are Translations

you a second wife here  LA BRUCE  Oh no my first wife rest her soul is at peace in that earth whereon she waged eternal war and for her sake I am resolved never to venture upon another  SONGLA BRUCE  Irish Tune  I HAD a wife of my own  Still with her tongue she chatter'd on  Never could let me alone  Clamper'd scolded and clatter'd on  Blockhead ape cuckold and drone  With these soft words she

have no intention of hiding your handsome face in a convent  BERENGERIA  And why not sir  LA BRUCE  Because I think those who are in wish to get out and the doors of them ought to be shut against all virgins who are not either so old so ugly or so illnatured as to despair of getting husbandsand that such places are only proper retreats for bad faces  BERENGERIA  But there virtue is sure of an
