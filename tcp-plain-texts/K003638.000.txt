Offering sensible that you have always shewn a tender regard wherever you have perceived the least Ray of Genius and I shall be extremely happy if your Grace should find the least appearance of it in what I have sent you as it is from so obscure a Bard you will be  pleased to accept of it as one of the meanest Flowers among the many that form the wreath upon your Grace's brow placed there by Virtue and Humility if I should be so happy as to have it prove acceptable it will confer the highest honour on  Your GRACE's Most Humble And Obedient Servant GEORGE SAVILLE CAREY  AN EVENING's WALK  _ONE summer's eve when ev'ry swain was hous'd  When Sol had scarce one glimmer left behind  Each little star faint glitt'ring cast a ray  And spangled o'er the dusky robe of night  Fond of the scene I wander'd far from home  O'er leafless lawns and flowerbreeding vales  Till weary nature slacken'd in my steps  And made me halt upon a friendly bank  Calm thro' a bridge there ran a peerless stream  That scarcely mov'd the ozier's slender wand  Here I took my stand and view'd the solemn scene  The bat had been an hour on the wing  Chasing the nightfly and the buzzing gnat  The purblind owl had left the ancient tower  Prowling with flossy wing along the mead  Anon as out of Chaos shot a ray  Of chearing light quiv'ring o'er the hills▪  As yet too weak to struggle with the dark  Or as th' Egyptian queen far off beheld  Shot her first beams on the Italian shore  Her brilliant train reflecting on the waves  Making the Tybur like a golden sea  Clouds that o'erhung the horizon unseen  Appear'd in view like silverskirted troops  Waiting the uprise of the queen of night  Slow she approach'd and smil'd upon the world  Op'ning fresh landscapes to my wond'ring eyes  Philomel now chear'd the embow'ring grove  The woodlark too mistaking it for day  Join'd her sweet notes with emulating strains  Near to my left there stood an ancient pile  By wasting time and savage war defac'd  Like a reduc'd and hoaryheaded chief  Commanding awe even in destruction  On its slinty sides deepdy'd ivy clung  Its roof was capt with velvetgrounded moss  And round its base wild weeds and flowers grew  The stinging nettle with the briars blend  The secret haunt of adders and of toads  Thro' the wide breaches of the rockbuilt walls  Pale Cynthia beam'd her lucid columns down  Upon the verdant slope in lines direct and clear  Reflecting on a dimpled brook below  A solemn silence now o'erspread the globe  Save when the minnew wanton'd on the stream  And left a circle spreading to the brink  Anon as wind from out some hollow cave  A deepfelt sigh from out the ruins came  As from a heart just bursting with its load  Which streight was answer'd with a voice of woe  Like sorrow soothing the more sad despair  A while I stood in doubt to know the cause  Or to retreat lest some deluding fiend  Aping the voice of grief meant to destroy  At length resolv'd with caution I approach'd  O melting sight my wounded heart ran o'er  And empty'd at my eyesA mournful pair  The woeful part ners of affliction sat  On the low basis of a mould'ring urn  And open'd to my view a tragic scene  Conceal'd I stood observing their distress  She in her lap an infant cherub held  A lovely boy the offspring of their loves  Her eyes were bent with sorrow on the babe  While in her face the little dear one smil'd  And then with tears of misery and love  She clung him eager to her throbbing breast  The wretched husband on her neck reclin'd  Striving to chear his melancholy dame  Feigned a hope tho' foreign to his heart  But when he found despair had seiz'd her soul  His tears burst forth and bath d his manly cheeks  And on his bended knees he trembling fell  Lifting his eyes with anguish 'gainst the sky  With invocations loud and agonizing sighs  Imploring heaven for a ray of peace  Till his loud accents shook the vaulted roof  And reft his tortur'd breastI cou'd no more  But flying to his aid with heart distress'd  He fix'd his eyes with furious glare upon me  And threaten'd me with death if I advanc'd  Like the fierce tyger assail'd by hunters  In his dreary den he stood defensive o'er his young  Shielding 'em from danger With humble voice  And friendly tears I mov'd him to attend  And listen patient to the voice of pity  Joy then with fear and admiration mix'd  O'erspread each face and as I spake they blest  Hope like the sun that clouds had long o'erveil'd  Flush'd on their cheeks extinguishing despair  Ye woeful pair let your suspicions cease  If the base world has put ye out of door  If friends forsake and creditors pursue  If you once more can trust a thought to hope  And think it possible to meet a friend  Tell me your story and you yet shall find  That fate relents and ceases to afflict  Tho' here to you a stranger I appear  To mercy I am none to see another wretched  Makes me wretched too by serving others  I still myself oblige and meet reward  Ample reward a tranquil happiness  Seeing others so by me made happy  I'd rather wipe the tear of grief away  Than add a ruby to a monarch's crown  And win a Prince's promise for my pains  If fate's not giv'n you over to despair  And you'll accept of friendship once again  Chear your sad heartslet ev'ry fear subside  Nor doubt a stranger yet may prove a friend  If you'd be happy tell me but in what  I'll try my ev'ry means to make ye so  Thou gracious being if thou art human  For thou speak'st with a celestial tongue  Let me embrace theeO pardon me too  That I assail'd thee with the threat of death  When thou but meant to save me from his shaft  For O thy words were welcome to my soul  As mollient dews that fall upon the mead  When parching Sol has curled each verdant blade  Thou hast preserv'd to me the dearest rose  That ever scented gale the sweetest bud  That ever eye beheld or tempted death to kill  This drooping fair one and her smiling boy  For they have suffer'd more than I dare tell  And to repeat is more than I can bear  She once alas was fortune's favourite  And Minerva's pride the tender fondling  Of a wealthy pairO sad remembrance  Provoking tears when will ye cease to flow  These eyes have long been strangers to a smile  Excuse me friend if they disgust thee  We sing of others woe but cry our own  My heart has gushed at a thousand veins  To see the sufferings of a matchless wife  There was a time when this forsaken held  At such an hour would have giv'n delight  When solitude and night would give a scope  To thought and yield a pleasing melancholy  To the jaded mind o'ercharg'd with pleasure  And variety but now how dreary and sorlorn  It seems and as we tell our mournful tale  With double horror echoes back each word  Mocking adversity in hollow sounds  Telling us over what is death to hear  Such tale as mine good friend I oft have read  Such woeful scenes have oft been play'd  With sympathizing heart I've heard and seen  And dropp'd a tear for the oppress'd and brave  But ere I'd slept the fiction fled my breast  And time would leave no traces on the mind  When we become the objects of distress  Remembrance stamps it with an iron seal  Upon our hearts and ev'ry thought is death  But to my story 'tis my friend's desire  I am no stranger to this gloomy pile  I oft have paid a visit to these walls  And oft admir'd the romantic form  When the fair morn invited me abroad  When fertile nature dasy'd ev'ry hill  And ev'ry meadow blush'd a purple hue  When thrushes sang and linnet charm'd the grove  My heart then drank in pleasure at my eyes  And felt no interrupter by the way  No wretched thought to dash it back again  My father was a man of wealth and note  And held a mansion in a village by  A better ne'er gave being to a son  I having read of mighty things abroad  Of ancient Rome and grand Cairo's court  The wealth of India and Egyptian wilds  With thirst for novelty and desire  I urg'd my father and at length prevail'd  That he would let me venture on a tour  And prove the truth of hist'ry and report  'Tis six years since I left my native home  Since when so many wonders I have seen  That curiosity at last grew sick  Returning home I cross'd the mighty Alps  A deadly sickness seiz'd me on the way  And made me seek for succour and a  friend  A greater rarity than all I'd met  An ample dwelling open'd to my view  To which I bent my way and shelter ask'd  And was receiv'd at once a welcome guest  With mild compassion they beheld my state  And strove to chear me with a friendly voice  Dismounting here I would have enter'd in  But that my feet their wonted use deny'd  My limbs gave way and let me to the ground  When this dear fair came running to my aid  She rais'd me up and led me careful in  And ev'ry day a true attendance paid  When I was strugling with the pangs of death  And with consoling hope she'd drop a tear  Imploring heaven to preserve my life  Her supplications did at length prevail  No sooner had I▪ conquer'd one compeer  But found my heart was with another ta'en  Love to whom I soon submitted and embrac'd  And made my hostess partner of my life  But here partaker in affliction too  Her father was a Briton once of wealth  And held a mansion in that happy isle  Till revolution and domestic broils  Destroy'd his lands and plunder'd all he had  Save a few stores in secret he had saved  Putting himself and family to flight  To seek for refuge in a foreign land  The action robb'd the good man of his life  And in distress the mournful widow left  With this fair comforter to buffet life  And shield her from a base ensnaring world  Here eighteen months I liv'd in social joy  And in the desert found the dearest wife  The kindest mother ever man cou'd boast  Her better spirits so outworn by grief  That made her frame like frozen lillies fade  Recline and droop unto the earth again  Not having heard one tiding from my friends  For many a day we for England made  And ere we reach'd the shore the wind blew high  And frowning Neptune on the surface foam'd  Throwing up wat▪ry m  untains in our way  And in his anger dash'd us on a rock  Some twenty perish'd in the yawning deep  But we escap'd to meet a harder fate  We sav'd our lives but saw our cargo sink  No sooner had I stepp'd with pleasure on the shore  But met the tidings of my father's death  From one misfortune often comes a crowd  For some malignant enemy of mine  Inform'd the good man I had long been dead  And ere he died he chose another heir  And left him all his fortune and estate  Here each glaring circumstance arose  And fill'd me with surprise I ask'd his name  "Landore he cry'd a wealthy neighbour here"  Landore ye mighty Gods how just  I am that heir thy worthy father chose  And for his friendship and his love to me  I'll give his son his fortune back again  I had enough before to make me happy  And but resign that superflux to him  Which fate had chosen me steward to a while  To quit my claim upon a just demand  THE PEASANT and ANT A FABLE  THE fields were ripen'd all around  And Ceres' head with corn was crown'd  Pomona with her fruits array'd  And Plenty coy muchenvied maid  Her horn of bounty careless held  And dropp'd a gift in ev'ry field  A peasant walking thro' the grain  Was heard to murmur and complain  His face was wan and meagre grown  And hunger stamp'd him with a frown  A laden ant was passing by  And with her small insectic eye  She look'd upon the abject man  And with revilings thus began  "Art not asham'd ungrateful clown  Amongst such crops thy wants to own  Whilst smiling plenty round thee stands  Inviting thy unwilling hands  Thou poor incorrigible knave  Thy sloth will bring thee to the grave  Benevolence is thrown away  On such as thou art ev'ry day  How canst thou ever think to thrive  Except with industry thou'lt strive  To help thyself when there is giv'n  Before thine eyes such stores from heav'n  Had I one opportunity  Like this I'd lay such plenty by  In such a season I'd provide  Enough for all my days beside  But I'm oblig'd each day to roam  Many a furlong from my home  And cry good luck whene'er I pick  From off the ground a single stick  Or in some long and rutty lane  I find by chance a single grain  Had I the art and strength like you  To reap to thresh to bake and brew  I would not murmur or complain  At winter's snow or summer's rain  Which heav'n in each season sends  To answer all its wiser ends"  "Thou boasting thing the clown reply'd  Thou little crawling piece of pride  Or stop thy foul reproaching breath  This moment else shall be thy death  For all thy counsel's mere pretence  To shew thy mighty share of sense  Thy industry and insolence  Thou would'st not in this manner prate  Wert thou like me of human state  Were what I've reap'd and what I've sown  Like what thou gather'st  all my own  My barns should ev'ry one be stor'd  And I as well as thee would hoard  I own the seasons plenty send  Were men like ants each other's friend  I would not now come murm'ring here  Were food and raiment not so dear  Those times you sure must own are bad  When there's no victuals to be had  When Nature sends her stores at large  And Earth does all her gifts discharge  'Tis not by God but man deny'd  Who feasts in luxury and pride  For see yon infant starving dies  With all this bounty 'fore his eyes"  THE APOLOGY  There is no reason to comment  The Moral is most evident  SUNDAY A POEM  HAIL holy day by heav'nly laws design'd  A consolation to all human kind  To man and brutes a day of peace and rest  Wou'd man but own his duty and be blest  As when the harp in Jesse's golden days  Tun'd ev'ry Sabbath to Jehovah's praise  By holy prophets and by virgins strung  When truth and faith inspir'd ev'ry tongue  Or when his son with eloquence divine  The greatest favorite of the sacred  Nine  Made the proud Saul whene'er he touch'd his strings  Bow his stiff neck and own the King of Kings  Observe the present agehow vain how strange  How true sang he who told us "all things change"  A puny race of infidels and fools  True slaves to vice and fashion's gaudy tools  Strangers to virtue enemies to fame  Except in foreign dress or foreign name  My Lord sends forth his hopeful heir to roam  To foreign climes to bring new fashions home  Caught with their manners and their taste he burns  And after six years travel he returns  A flimsy fop a coxcomb and a fool  A greater dunce than when he left the school  Quick at intrigue to gamble or to sight  A debauchee if not a ste  Britain and France with emulation try  T' outdo each other in absurdity  For here at home what vast excess we see  In city fops and city quality  Is there a folly introduc'd at court  But streight on swiftest pinions of report  It thro' the city in a trice is fann'd  And introduc'dfor taste at second hand  With cards and routs their Sunday is employ'd  And ev'ry Christian virtue is destroy'd  Mode will bewitch all eyes may plainly see  And nothing charms like flimsy gaiety  In all degrees at ev'ry age we find  There's nought like fashion captivates the mind  Do but observe the rich Sir Traffick's wife  Old and deform'd upon the verge of life  With fulsome art she rolls her faded eyes  And thinks to make a conquest ere she dies  While in their dress there's no distinction seen  'Tween sixtysix and she of gay sixteen  But to my theme my muse at random strays  And with a tedious prelude she delays  My better meaning and perverts my plan  I'll tack about and to it like a man  We raise subscriptions and new churches build  But heaven knows how seldom they are fill'd  Shou'd Sunday shine a summer's day and fair  Behold what legions round the town repair  What flocks to Richmond and to Windsor drive  And buz and sip like drones about a hive  At every welcome tavern which they meet  Affecting bucks and asses prove complete  On hackney'd steeds the giddy blockheads fly  Who kindly drag 'em home perhaps and die  Of all the slaves dame nature's giv'n us here  There's none so noble treated so severe  As the kind steed that's ever yet been curst  To have his last load greater than his first  When worn with hunger slav'ry and age  Finds still a harder journey to engage  Than when in youth and vigour he wou'd bear  My Lord a mile or two to take the air  But such is fate when useless and grown old  To some unfeeling monster he is sold  Each needy wretch his thirst for taste declares  Whene'er he speaks but more by what he wears  Oft is the fancy of some brainless prig  Couch'd in the choice of his enormous wig  And oft we learn the tenor of the fair  By the sly glance or belleaffected air  Is there a nymph that Fortune will not own  That beauty might indeed have stamp'd have shown  Behold her sailing in the pink of taste  Trump'd up with powder frippery and paste  Resolv'd 'gainst fortune beauty's force to try  The greatest powers now beneath the sky  Rather than fate her conquest shou'd impede  She'll not retreat tho' virtue's sure to bleed  Behold what droves to Bagnigge Wells repair  Crowding together  for the sake of air  And strictly keeping  Sunday's weekly fair  Sunk in a vale this fair retreat is plac'd  And with two mountains on each side is grac'd  That has for ages there in loads been thrown  Receiving all the rubbish of the town  Smooth thro' its flat a muddy riv'let streams  And down its sides a wholsome churchyard teems  Here close pent up by thousands we repair  And praise the water liquor and the  air  Here lovesick couples ev'ry Sunday run  They marry next and find themselves undone  Soon shifts the scene the passion next is cloy'd  And all their promis'd happiness destroy'd  Behold a pair that but two years ago  She a coquette and he a city beau  Now look with sorrow at their former state  And curse the burden of their present fate  Marry'd they walk indifferent and grave  Whilst worldly cares their ev'ry thought enslave  He at a distance from the crowd retires  She at a distance leaves her gay desires  See selfadmir'd Miss of four feet high  Display her charms and with an ogle try  To captivate some dull unwary spark  She often shoots but seldom hits the mark  For should the rogue some imperfection spy  Her crooked legs or bolster'd shape awry  If the high shoulder which she'd fain conceal  Some thoughtless turn shou'd cruelly reveal  No new device how well soe'er 'tis dress'd  Will win the lover to her strutting breast  If such a wretch wou'd deal in Hymen's laws  Let her throw off her frippery and gauze  Nor vainly try with selfimagin'd charms  To win the lover to her stunted arms  To charm with person never make pretence  But try to please with gravity and sense  Plain be your dress seem conscious of defect  Let love subside and try to win respect  Shou'd some grave friend of sixty seek a wife  A needful helpmate at the verge of life  Who's with your virtues not your person mov'd  Its better far by such to be approv'd  Than try with  such a form  to make a prize  Or hope in vain to charm a lover's eyes  Who will but rally flatter and despise  Devote no more your Sunday to intrigue  Nor longer keep your vanity in league  For where the person and the mind's awry  We seldom find it catch a lover's eye  Let not White Conduit Bagnigge or the Spaw  One Sunday more your vain attention draw  Where swarms of fools of coxcombs bucks and beaux  Adore themselves and next themselves their clothes  Where belles repair to catch and to be caught  That never yet gave being to a thought  You on whom fortune has been pleas'd to smile  Lay by your giddy pleasures for a while  Regard the cries of nature in distress  Confine awhile your appetite and dress  Where fortune's giv'n enough and some to spare  Let the remainder be the poor man's share  EPIGRAM ON LORD G  MY Lord has often said he scorns  The wretch who'd fain conceal his horns  And from his heart quite full of glee  He wish'd all cuckolds in the sea  A merry wag pleas'd with the whim  Reply'd my Lord  Pray can you swim  AN ELEGY On the DEATH of Mr RICHARD CROSS  FAREWELL kind youth my friend farewell  Since fate  will  have it so  Cease cease the solemn passing bell  Nor aggravate my woe  In plaintive notes my muse shall sing  Thy merits and thy name  And on her weak but grateful wing  She'll bear thee up to fame  What tho' obscure thou spent thy days  A friend to virtue's cause  Thy merits still demand my lays  To whisper thy applause  The lonely bud that blows obscure  Beneath the spreading thorn  Often preserves a scent more pure  Than what the top adorn  I little thought my dearest friend  To see thee dead so soon  For who could think the day wou'd end  Before it well was noon  Thy noon of life an ev'ning prov'd  Thy sun ran quickly down  Thy morning was by all belov'd  Thine eve without a frown  Thro' life with even pace thou steer'd  Without one single foe  By friends belov'd by truth rever'd  Lest envy made them so  But who could be a foe to thee  A friend to all mankind  Whose breast was all tranquility  With harmony combin'd  How oft have I at peep of dawn  Thy friendly summons heard  And with thee trod the verdant lawn  Before the sun appear'd  From Richmond hill to Twick'nham dale  How often have we stray'd  Charm'd with the thrush and nightingale  That sang in Dysart's shade  When cloudy mists from off the brooks  Proclaim'd a summer's day  With glee we talk'd of men and books  And argu'd time away  Whene'er a wild romantic scene  Has struck our wand'ring eyes  And where the magic circle's been  Great Shakespear would arise  Where gentle Zephyrs blew serene  As thro' the copse we steer'd  Or when some garden we have seen  Great Milton has appear'd  When nature dasy'd o'er the lawn  And blossom'd ev'ry tree  The humble Thompson's Muse would dawn  Like pure simplicity  When o'er the hill we've chanc'd to stray  And view'd some mansion by  Oft with a smile I've heard thee say  "Its wealthy Lord must die"  Thou envy'd not the proud his wealth  His luxury and pride  Thy only boon a little health  But that the fates deny'd  Thy honest ear would ne'er attend  The vile detractor's lye  But with a manly zeal defend  Both friend and enemy  Oft when the lark had clos'd her wings  The Moon began her reign  I've heard thee touch thy magic strings  And play thy usual strain  Scarce had the Thames sent up a breeze  Or dews fall'n on the ground  But thro' the gentle waving trees  I heard the pleasing sound  Enraptur'd have I stood alone  Beneath a cooling shade  With extacy I've caught each tone  In soft piano's play'd  But now the ev'ning charms no more  No more the morn delights  Since morn nor ev'ning can restore  Thee back again to sight  No more shall I at break of day  Thy friendly summons hear  Nor with thee o'er the woodlands stray  Before the Sun appear  In sad remembrance o'er thy tomb  Thy requiem will I sing  When night with dull and awful gloom  Shall spread her raven wing  A POOR MAN's QUERIES Addressed to his FRIEND  OUR betters seem to make a rout  To find the cause of famine out  Pretend the myst'ry is too great  To tell us why we have no meat  Nor can our ablest Stsn's head  Find out the cause we have no bread  The reason's plain I tell you why  I don't believe they ever try  But should they want to lay a tax  Upon our heavyladen backs  There is not one but knows the way  To do it for us any day  Like dog i'the fair they shift about  Today in place tomorrow out  Nor shall you find the best resign  Without some motive or design  To wriggle into better bread  Then can you think he'll plague his head  About such things as you or I  Who were but born to starve and die  QUERY I  Were they like you and I to feel  An appetite without a meal  Say would they not soon find the way  To move this obstacle away  II  Would forestallers and regrators  Until now have 'scap'd their betters  If some great rogue 'tween you and I  Had not giv'n them authority  Thieves are seldom hang'd for stealing  Where my Lord's a fellow feeling  III  If one knave should chance to swing  O that wou'd be a happy thing  In such a case 'tis ten to four  But he'd impeach a hundred more  And then I'd lay you nine to ten  That half of them were Nn  Or such to whom we give the name  For they by birth assume the claim  And have not in reality  The smallest claim to quality  Titles that once were bravely won  That have thro' generations run  May grace at last a worthless fool  Perhaps some haughty fav'rite's tool  In some base office exercis'd  And by his countrymen despis'd  THE FATAL INCIDENT  'TIS full six months cry'd Aladin  Since Emina I've seen  Say was it not a sorry sin  To leave my fairy queen  Say was it not a sorry sin  To force me so away  And make me plod thro' thick and thin  "O'er hills and far away"  To make me soldier 'gainst my will  And go the lud knows where  And what's alas more cruel still  To force me from my dear  'Tis fourteen days since last I heard  Or had one single line  And she's forsa'en me I'm afraid  But sure the fault's not mine  We parted at this very stile  I thought I shou'd have dy'd  I took my leave and all the while  The lovely creature cry'd  Plague on the man be who he will  That first the wars began  But may he be more plagued still  That schem'd the Militia plan  Why shou'd they fix on me forsooth  That ne'er got drunk and swore  There's Ralph and Hal aye and in truth  I cou'd name twenty more  There's Thomas now as great a rake  As ever trod the lea  He got with barn at our last wake  Poor Sally Mapletree  Our Joe got drunk and beat his wife  Until she scarce cou'd see  And yet for all upon my life  They needs must fix on me  But I'll no longer time delay  With thinking what is past▪  I'm glad I've got so safe away  To see my love at last  O how my heart with fancy throbs  To think we soon shall meet  From her the Rose its colour robs  The Hyacinth its sweet  I shall be 'sham'd to see her too  In this strange soldier's dress  But if her heart like mine be true  She'll not love me the less  I'll e'en across the Churchyard now  And see my Emina  She lives at foot of yonder brow  Where yon white lambkins play  Here stands the Church where she and I  Together oft have been  And hope once more yet ere I die  To go with her again  When she some morning by my side  O wou'd it were today  Shall go a maid but turn a bride  Dress'd like the queen of May  Then luck attend I'll e'en away  In this same soldier's trim  Desire will not let me stay  To make myself more prim  Ah me what name's on yonder stone  That meets my tortur'd sight  'Tis Emina's 'tis her's alone  Then to the world good night  For like the barbedshafted dart  It plunges thro' my breast  Fast bleeds within my wounded heart  But here I'll give 'em rest  O cruel fate I cannot bear  To look upon her grave  Strike me to earth nor longer spare  A lovedestracted slave  Alas I feel my blood retire  My eyes grow dim apace  The fates have heard my last desire  We'll in the grave embrace  A PASTORAL Written on the DEATH of Mr C CHURCHILL and Mr R LLOYD The latter dying soon after the news of the former's death  JONNY and ROBIN  JONNY  AH Robin hast thou heard the news  Our blithest swain is dead  The greatest fav'rite of the Muse  Is in the Churchyard laid  ROBIN  Thou dost not sure my
