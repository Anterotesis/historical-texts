 THE CASE OF ENGLAND AND THE  PROTESTANT INTEREST  SInce the present condition of the Kingdom and the whole Protestant Interest by the conjunction of  France  and  Spain  abroad and a a more horrid combination of several at home must needs affect with the most melancholy Reflections all true English Hearts such as have any real love or zeal for their Religion or their native Country I cannot think it amiss to present a short and impartial View  o such as have not considered the same  In the beginning of the last Age the Protestant Interest in  Europe  was more than a Match for the Roman Catholick the Kingdom of  Bohemia  was almost all Protestant near half the Subjects of  Hungary  of  Austria  and  Moravia  were Protestant and did many times defend themselves by  against the Emperor himself when oppress'd by him for the sake of their Religion That in  Germany  the Houses of  Newburgh  were Protestant the  Palatinates  for the most part of them Protestant of the strictest sort the  Saxons  entirely Protestant and being hearty unanimous and seated in the midst of  Germany  were a Bulwark and Defence to the Protestants of many other lesser States as often as they were oppress'd for their Religion by their own or their neighbouring Princes That many of the Subjects of  Bavaria Bamburgh Cologn Wurtzburgh  and  Worms  were Protestants Besides these  that the Protestants of  France  were so powerful as to maintain or Civil Wars in defence of their Religion and always came off with advantage The  Vaudois  in  Italy  were all of them Protestant and great numbers of the Inhabitants of the  Spanish  Low Countries were of the Reform'd Religion Besides  England  and  Holland  and the Northern Kingdoms of  Denmark  and  Sweden  and Dutchy of  Brandenburgh  were entirely Protestant But now instead of this is not the Protestant Power destroyed almost over  Europe  The whole Kingdom of  Bohemia  entirely Popish Are not the Protestants of  Poland Austria Moravia  utterly destroyed Is not their destruction now carrying on and almost finish'd in  Hungary  In  Germany  the  Newburghers  of Protestants are become fierce Enemies of the Protestant Religion The Protestants of  Bavaria Bamburgh Cologn Wurtzburgh  and  Worms  are all destroyed In  France  the  Spanish  Low Countries  Savoy  and  Vaudois  after long and mighty Struggles the Religion is utterly extinguished Against the poor  Palatinates  the Persecution is now carrying on with its usual barbarity and their Neighbours the  Saxons  are so far from being able to help them that they are under the fearful Apprehensions of suffering the like from their own Prince lately turned Roman Catholick to obtain the Kingdom of  Poland  so soon as his Wars with  Sweden  and other troubles created him by his Polish and Lithuanian Subjects will give him leave Besides this two Northern Princes have given great cause to suspect their conversion to the Romish Religion That  Sweden  by its separation from the rest of  Europe  by the  Baltick  is unable to give assistance to the Protestants in any part of  Europe  without the consent of the  German  Princes bordering on the Baltick which will never be granted by Papists in favour of the Protestants  Thus the Protestant Religion which had spread it self over almost all  Europe  which had gain'd the entire possession of some Countrys the greater part of others and mighty Interest in most has through the restless malice and endeavours of its Enemies been subverted and destroyed in Country after County till it is at last reduced to a little Corner of what it once possest  England  and  Holland  And do we think our Enemies will not accomplish what they have thus prosperously carried on so far our utter Destruction Is it not high time then to think our selves in danger to look about us to enquire what it is hath thus weakend us brought us so near our ruin what measures will certainly accomplish it and what we must take for the prevention of it  The Romish Methods of converting the Protestants have been in all Countries the same  viz  Confiscation of their Estates Goals and Imprisonments I  re and Sword dragooning and massacring and inflicting the most inhuman torments that rage and fury cou'd invent upon such whose resolution and zeal for their Religion cou'd not be moved by the former means  If this be the true case of  England  and the Protestant Religion then what is wanting to give the finishing stroke to our destruction but only an ability in the King of  France  to break the Powers of  England  and  Holland  And when we consider how in the year the King of  France  marched his Army through the midst of  Flanders  fell directly upon  Holland  then unprovided enter'd their strongest Towns like open Villages some without defence or almost denial most of them without any blows at all and all of them with very few and made himself Master of three parts of  Holland  in months time for which Sir  W T  K  C  II's Ambassador then in  Holland  tells us the reason was That the  Dutch  then not suspecting such a thing had no FieldArmy sufficient to encounter their Enemies or succour any Town That walled Towns will not defend the men within unless the hearts of the Men will defend their Walls That no Garison will make any resolute defence without the prospect or hopes at least of relief 'Tis true that the  French  King having then all  Flanders  on his back garison'd with  Spanish  Troops then his implacable Enemies a powerful Army of the  German  Princes matching upon him down the  Rhine Spain  and  England  alarm'd by his successes preparing to attack him on all quarters was glad to vomit up all again and return home with as much precipitancy as he had invaded them least the Provisions and retreat of his Army through  Flanders  should be cut off But now the case is otherwise he has possess'd himself of  Flanders  extended his Dominion to the very Frontiers of  Holland  Spain  is all united to him some  German  Princes then his Enemies are now become his Friends others enter'd into conditions of Neutrality with him  And should he now by a fatal Battle which God of his infinite mer  break the  Dutch  Army which they have with infinite Charge and matchless Vigour gather'd up from  Denmark Brandenburgh  and other remote Countries of  Germany  might he not enter the heart of their Country And whence then can their strong Cities and Towns depend upon relief May he not as formerly enter 'em like open Villages May he not as formerly possess himself of their whole Country in less than one Campaign It was the opinion of that great Statesman Sir  WT  That  Polland  wou'd make a stout resistance in any quarrel remote from their own doors but that which enables them their Wealth to carry on a foreign War with Vigour wou'd in a War at home render 'em defenceless Rich and populous Towns are not fit for Sieges or were ever known to make any long and resolute defence If this be our case if the whole power of the Protestant Religion rests now in a manner in  England  and  Holland  if the destruction of  England  as well as of our holy Religion must inevitably follow the loss of  Holland  If  Holland  by one unfortunate Battle might happen to be lost in one Campaign or less Are we not in a most sad and deplorable Condition  and if some Men are without their Fears Have we not the greater reason to fear for our selves our Religion and our Country What shou'd we judg of those who tell us 'tis too early yet for  England  to declare The Enemy has raised his Armies furnish'd his Magazines and 'tis too early for us to think of raising a Man The Enemy is before our Outworks and 'tis too soon for us to prepare our selves to be on our guard Will not those Men tell us when  Holland  is lost 'twill then be too late To what purpose will they say now do you think of raising Forces Is not the  French  King Master of  Holland  Possess'd of all their Ports Where will you land 'em To what use will you put 'em Does not such Language as this plainly shew the intention of the Authors Is it not plainly to deliver us blindfold bound hand and foot into the Enemies hand Is not their design now so visible as not to be disguised Do not some of the Party begin to throw off the Mask and tell us 'Twill not be well with us till our old Master returns till the Government returns to its natural Channel And are not those that were the very Tools and Instruments of Popery and Arbitrary Power in former Reigns and that owe their Lives to Acts of Indempnity in this industriously represented by some as the Patriots of their Country and by a strange kind of Paradox those that have been always hearty for the Church and were for defending of it when others were for pulling it down that were hearty for the King's Accession to the Throne and to his Person and Government ever since are represented as betrayers of us as having sold us to  France  Would it not be a piece of rare refin'd Policy if  France  could hang up her greatest Enemies under the Nation of her dearest Friends and give Encouragement to her antient Frien  under the Notion of being her Enemies  Let us therefore while it is yet in our power as we tender our Religion and our Country use our utmost Endeavours by all legal ways to assu  his Majesty and his Government against all his and our Enemies both at home and abroad and in the words of our Liturgy let us offer up our most servent Prayers to God Amighty  Give peace in our time O Lord because there is none other that figureth for us but only thou O God
