 ARMINIUS  OR THE CHAMPION OF LIBERTY  A TRAGEDY  WITH AN HISTORICAL PREFACE  BY ARTHUR MURPHY ESQ  Arminius Liberator haud dubie Germaniae et qui non primordia Populi Romani sicut alii Reges Ducesque

Price s d  Where may be had THE AUTHOR's OTHER WORKS  PREFACE  THE following Poem was written in the course of the last summer Why it was not offered to the Stage it is unnecessary to mention If it could in any degree answer the purpose for which it was originally designed it would not be as perhaps now is the case a mere trifle offered to the Public The Author is conscious that his powers are neither equal to the subject nor to the zeal with which he undertook it Removed though he is from the political world he could not in his private retreat be altogether inattentive to the various events which in the last seven years have changed the face of Europe and under the savage conduct of a Nation of professed Atheists counteracted the order of Providence in the formation of  Civil Society  Nihil est illi Principi Deo qui omnem hunc Mundum regit quod quidem in terris fiat acceptius quam Concilia Coetus que hominum jure Sociati quoe  CIVITATES  appellantur  Somn Scip S iii  He saw the Monarchy of France overturned by the fury of a Democratic Faction who have since reduced their whole Nation to a state of Slavery not to be paralelled in the Records of History FIVE MEN called the DIRECTORY have silenced the Legislature of their country they transported Seventy of the Members to perish on a foreign shore and from that time have not suffered their NATIONAL ASSEMBLY to enter into a Debate or to pass a single Law  The Usurpers at first covered their ambition with the mask of Patriots struggling for Liberty and as soon as they found themselves possessed of Power they destroyed LIBERTY ITSELF With men of their stamp the practice has been uniformly the same from the days of Tacitus to the present hour  Ut Imperium evertant  LIBERTATEM praeferunt sr Everterint LIBERTATEM IPSAM aggrediuntur  Annal Lib xvi S  When the Revolution began in France the People of England did not look much deeper than the surface the love of innovation was for some time thought to be zeal for civil liberty and by great politicians and eminent orators it was called The FABRIC OF HUMAN WISDOM That doctrine was spread far and wide and honest men were deceived by appearances In the mean time a JACOBIN PARTY was formed in various parts of England by CONSTITUTIONAL CLUBS and CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES Republicans in their hearts they pretended to act with ardour for the Constitution They talked of the RIGHTS OF MAN of REFORM OF PARLIAMENT and UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE while in secret they wished for nothing so much as to see the horrors of French Anarchy introduced into this kingdom They knew that in a thunderstorm the dregs of the barrel rise to the top They had read in the fable that when the oak and the cedar were felled to the ground the bramble reigned over the forest Having nothing to lose they hoped in a convulsion of the state that they should find their private advantage The same views and principles in every age and country  have been the motives of all pernicious citizens The English JACOBINS as well as the FRENCH may find their picture drawn by the masterly pencil of Tacitus  Falso  LIBERTATIS  nomen obtendi ab Ã¼s qui  PRIVATIM DEGENERES  in publicum  EXITIOSI  nihil spei nisi per discordias habeant  Ann Lib xi S  While our homebred Factions were employed at  Sheffield Norwich Manchester London  and other places in laying the seedplots of Rebellion this country was on a sudden involved in a just a necessary an UNAVOIDABLE War Unavoidable it must be called since the REGICIDES thought fit to be the AGGRESSORS This point has been warmly controverted and much ink has been lavished on the subject The present writer does not mean to enter the lists with any person whatever he only claims a right to think for himself and with all possible brevity to exhibit the light in which things appeared to him  It has been said that Great Britain provoked the war by the recall of her Ambassador But that event took place after the th of  August when the King of France was suspended from all the functions of his office and sent with the Royal Family a prisoner to the Temple The credentials of the Ambassador were then no longer valid With whom was he to transact business Was it to be matter of indifference whether he negotiated with the King to whom he was sent or with the BRISSOTS the MARATS the ROBESPIERES and the rest of that Pandaemonium Would such a conduct have been suited to the honour of the British Nation It would have been nothing short of a decided part in the internal affairs of France Had LORD GOWER remained at Paris he would have been in a precarious situation He had seen the massacre of the th of August Was he to wait for that of the d of September when no less than three thousand men women and children were most barbarously murdered The French have lately shewn that they can trample on the rights of ambassadors They confined the ambassador of Portugal in a prison and might have behaved with equal insolence to LORD GOWER In such a juncture his Majesty thought it became his dignity to send letters of recall declaring at the  same time that he would not interfere in the internal government of that kingdom If the French who are now  affiliating  that is enslaving GENEVA will enquire for the works of BURLAMAQUI they will find that the recall of an ambassador or a refusal to receive one may proceed from various causes without being deemed a sufficient provocation of war It should seem that the French themselves were of that opinion since it appears that M LE BRUN at that time Minister for Foreign Affairs in his answer to the communication made to him by LORD GOWER expressed his wish  that a full reciprocity of justice and goodwill might subsist between the two countries  With what sincerity the Republican Anarchists acted on that occasion may be inferred from their Decree of the th November by which they promised fraternity and support to the People of every country who wished to overturn their Government It is almost superfluous to add that in answer to  Frost  and  Joel Barlow  the President of the Convention hoped the day was not far distant  when he should send congratulations to a similar National Convention in England  It is well known that an inundation of French Jacobins whom their  o'ercloy'd country vomited forth  to propagate their detestable principles infested every part of London In such a period the ALIEN BILL was a wife and necessary measure and it may now well be a question whether it ought not to be declared perpetual Whenever a Peace shall be concluded a banditti of Frenchmen under the pretext of trade and commerce will be sent over to wage a war of principles against the Government  In the latter end of the year the demagogues of Paris were resolved on two grand objects namely the murder of their King and a war with Great Britain The former was executed on the st of January on the th of the same month M Chauvelin received orders to depart Though it was well known that long before that time he had renounced his King who had sent him hither and sworn fidelity to his new masters and though his machinations in this country were well known he was notwithstanding suffered to remain as long as Lewis XVI was permitted to live His  credentials expired with his martyred Sovereign His character of ambassador was terminated by the fatal murder of his most Christian Majesty To have received him with new credentials from the regicides would have been incompatible with the moral dignity of the British Nation  The rulers of Paris having destroyed their King proceeded to their longprojected war against Great Britain In their debate on that subject on the st of February it was asserted by one of their orators  That the watchful conduct of the British Ministers their fears and jealousies afforded proofs  of the  progress of the opinions and principles of the French Revolution  See Debrett's Collection of Addresses from English Clubs published in the year  Is not that avowal from the mouth of an enemy a full justification of the ALIEN BILL It was further asserted by  Brissot  that the British Ministers for the sake of the trade and commerce of England observed a STRICT NEUTRALITY If corroborating proof of this pacific disposition were necessary we have the authority of the MARQUIS DE BOUILLE That great Officer known and  respected throughout Europe informs us that he attended the King of Prussia and the Emperor Leopold at Pilnitz on the d of August when these two powers formed a Treaty of Alliance and in the month of September following he was received in the Cabinet at Vienna and there the Emperor told him that he had been waiting for answers from the Courts of  Russia Spain England  and the principal Sovereigns of Italy and had at length received them and was  assured of the assistance and cooperation of all those powers  EXCEPT ENGLAND which had expressed its determination to OBSERVE A STRICT NEUTRALITY  See the Marquis de Bouille's Memoirs of the French Revolution page  What in the mean time was the real disposition of the French towards Great Britain Mr HARPER one of the Representatives in the American Congress has laid open the intrigues the stratagems and overbearing insolence of the French from the very beginning of the Revolution He tells us in express terms that their grand object was to destroy the trade of Great Britain  And  this was to be effected by setting fire to the four corners of Europe and exciting the People in every quarter to insurrection against their Government A project so atrocious in its end and so abominable in its means has never been conceived before And while all this was going on the Convention in order to hoodwink England was making to her the most solemn assurances of pacific intentions It even carried its dissimulation to the almost incredible length of requesting the mediation of England to bring about a Peace with Prussia and the Emperor In the mean time their instructions to  GENET  their Envoy to America shewed that it was their manifest object to draw the United States into a war with Great Britain Those instructions were dated January d Supplementary instructions were delivered by the same person January th Louis XVI was guillotined January st Chauvelin was ordered to quit England January th and war was declared against England on the st of February following If the dismissal of Chauvelin was the occasion of the war as France alledged why those instructions on the d of January so long before the dismissal  The Leaders of Opposition in England have long persisted in the error of regarding only the  DECLARATIONS  of France and wholly overlooking her  ACTIONS  See Harper's Pamphlet Page    If the war was at first unavoidable it is now just and necessary as appears from the behaviour of the Directory to LORD MALMESBURY That Nobleman invested with the character of Plenipotentiary offered in the very outset of the negotiation at  Lisle  the terms of Peace drawn up in the form of a Treaty which the enemy had they been in earnest might have embraced with little or no delay but contrary to all precedent they recalled at the end of near three months the Plenipotentiaries who possessed the thread of the whole negotiation and sent two new Agents to  Lisle  with a settled design in the most abrupt manner to end all further Treaty Those new Agents by a note dated the th of September desired to know whether Lord Malmesbury had powers to give up to France and her Allies all places conquered by Great Britain They were told by his Lordship that a decisive answer in the  negative had been given on the th of July preceding This was of no weight A Peer of Great Britain and a Plenipotentiary Ambassador was ordered in the most insolent manner to go and return that is to fetch and carry for an insolent Directory who have emerged from obscurity to be the tyrants of their country This demand of a general restitution is the more extravagant because after the three great and glorious victories unparalleled in the British Annals by LORD HOWE over the French by LORD ST VINCENT over the Spaniards and lastly by LORD DUNCAN over the Dutch it is not in their power to retake any one place that has been conquered from them Rafts and gunboats will not be able to cope with the British Navy  It has been asked in the House of Commons  "Are we to persist in the war for the possession of the Cape of  GOOD HOPE  the Island of  CEYLON  and Trincomale"  The following Extract from the Marquis de Bouille's Memoirs will be a sufficient answer to the question "In the summer of " says that great General  when I was preparing to set out from BERLIN to RUSSIA I received an  order from Government to return to Paris On my arrival there the Minister acquainted me with a project relative to the East Indies The object was to unite the French and Dutch forces in an attack upon the English possessions to restore to the Princes of the Country the Provinces conquered from them by the English and to obtain and secure for the two nations Factories and Commercial Establishments which were to be free to the whole world The means employed to secure success to this enterprize were an army of men independent of the garrisons already in that country twenty millions of livres in specie and a Naval force able to oppose that of the English in the East Indies TRINCOMALE in the Island of CEYLON was the place destined for the rendezvous of the troops and the repository of the military magazines One third of the forces as well as of the sums necessary and the stores and provisions of every kind were to be furnished by the Dutch who requested that I should have the command of the expedition In the Revolution broke out in Holland but was suppressed  pressed by the entry of a Prussian army under the command of the DUKE OF BRUNSWICK All the bonds which united FRANCE and HOLLAND were dissolved the former basely abandoning her Ally and thus the vast project of the conquest of the Indies vanished into air  The Marquis de Bouille's Memoirs Page    It is to be observed that the above project was in not more than a year after a General Peace when nothing had occurred that could give umbrage to France The same rooted aversion to this country 'still subsists and is openly avowed by the Directory and after this statement is TRINCOMALE an object of importance to this country Shall it be given up to be the rendezvous of the enemy's troops and the repository of their magazines To do it were to be  felo de se  Ever since the return of Lord Malmesbury the Directory have waged a war of Billinsgate against this country With scurrility calumny and the grossest falsehoods they have attempted to traduce and vilify a great nation celebrated throughout Europe for its  humanity no less than its valour They have declared that the English are a generous people labouring under a bad government and they are determined to give them on the the Royal Exchange a better constitution Infatuated men They had in the beginning of their Revolution the British Constitution as a model to imitate but they preferred Anarchy As Montesquieu expresses it they had BYZANTIUM before their eyes and they built CHALCEDON They have  affiliated  HOLLAND BELGIUM the States of Italy and GENEVA and they have robbed and plundered them all It now remains for them to destroy the Commerce of Great Britain and to erect their TRICOLOURED FLAG on the Royal Exchange For this purpose they have solicited subscriptions in their own exhausted country but by that measure they rouzed the spirit of the British Nation All degrees and ranks of men have conspired with emulation to strengthen the hands of Government and from the Contributions paid in at the Bank three things are manifest First that the people are united with one mind one heart one hand against the  attempts of a French banditti Secondly that this is an opulent country ready and willing to strengthen the hands of Government And thirdly the Voluntary Subscriptions shew that all ranks and orders of men repose entire confidence in his Majesty's Councils and his present Ministers The consequence of this unanimity and firmness it is hoped will be the support of the extensive commerce of this country and the empire of the sea  Quicunque Mundi terminus obstitit  Hunc tangat armis visere g stiens  Qua parte debacchentur Ignes  QuÃ¢ Nebulae pluviique Rores  Horace Lib III Ode  The situation it must be granted forms an awful period and requires collected vigour nothing less than the whole force of the community And yet at the same time we still hear a clamour for RADICAL REFORM That men of eminence in the state should at length join in such a cry is not a little surprizing It may therefore not be improper to remind them that on the trial of HARDY at the Old Baily a letter to him  from the Society at  Norwich  was produced containing the following passage  Whether it is the private design of the several Societies to rip  UP MONARCHY BY THE ROOTS  and place  DEMOCRACY  in its stead  What was the answer  The Committee offer you every assistance in their power but request that your questions for the future may relate chiefly to  REFORM OF PARLIAMENT  Hardy's Trial by Gurney Vol I Page  This the Corresponding Society avow as their ostensible object but conceal their intention with regard to Monarchy When men of rank and ability allow themselves after all their efforts to adopt the same clamour they run the risk of being thought to follow HARDY'S advice Whose advice they follow when their voice is raised against every measure of Government it is impossible to say The suspension of the HABEAS CORPUS ACT is called a violent step nothing less than a violation of the Constitution an encroachment on the liberty of the subject and in short a manifest prelude to the reign of terror The reason assigned for this intemperate language is that no proof of existing  plots against the State has been produced in Parliament But that the Jacobins at  Manchester  and other places have been engaged in a conspiracy against this country is evident beyond the possibility of a doubt And surely the power of providing for the safety of a whole people is inherent in the frame and spirit of the Constitution Let us hear what a WHIG of the OLD SCHOOL has said upon the subject  It is an absurdity to imagine that those who have the authority of making laws cannot suspend any particular law when they think it expedient for the public When therefore any law does not conduce to this great end the very observation of it would endanger the community and that law ought to be laid asleep for a limited time by proper authority Every government must in its nature be armed with such a power There cannot be a greater instance of this than in the old Commonwealth of Rome who flattered themselves with an opinion that their government had in it a due temper of the Regal Noble and Popular Power represented by the Consuls the Senators and the Tribunes Nevertheless in this government when the Republic was threatened  with danger they thought fit for the common safety to appoint a Temporary Dictator invested with the whole power of the Three Branches who when the danger was over retired again into the community and left the government in its natural situation The  HABEAS CORPUS ACT  was passed towards the end of  Charles II  and since that time has been suspended twice under the reign of  William and Mary  once under King  William  and once in the reign of Queen  Anne  and again in the year    And besides every unprejudiced man will consider how mildly and equitably this power has been used The persons confined have been treated with all possible humanity and abridged of nothing but the liberty of ruining themselves and their families  See the Freeholder No  What Mr ADDISON has said of the Ministers of GEORGE I may be applied to the Councils of his present Majesty when the  Habeas Corpus Act  was suspended four years ago The whole body of the people have equal confidence on the present occasion But after all ADDISON it may be said was a party writer  MONTESQUIEU was neither WHIG nor TORY His words are  Si la puissance legislative se croyoit en danger par quelque Conjuration Secrette contre L'Etat ou quelque Intelligence avec les Enemis du dehors Elle pourroit pour un tems court et limitÃ© permettre Ã  a puisance ExÃ©cutrice de faire arrÃ¨ter les Citoyens suspects qui ne perdroient Leur LibertÃ¨ pour un tems que pour la conserver pour toujours  L'Esprit des Loix Lib xi Cap vi  The clamour of a few against the present suspension of the law is not the only mischief of the times A MONSTER IN POLITICS has lately stalked forth as formidable as that described by LUCRETIUS  Horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans  This Phantom is  The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE  a FOURTH ESTATE set up in a country that has been for ages governed by the Legislative Authority of THREE If there is such a new order it is of course paramount to KING LORDS and COMMONS and by consequence  there is an end of our boasted Constitution But where has this  SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE  ever existed At ATHENS the people had a share in the government and the citizens of Rome by their TRIBUNES assumed and exercised enormous influence but they had no SOVEREIGN MAJESTY In process of time they both wrought their own ruin The subjects of Great Britain are much wiser they delegate their whole authority to their Representatives and beyond that power they claim no authority If  The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE  ever existed in any part of the known world it must have been in a pure unmixed and persect DEMOCRACY And where can such a government be traced Polybius says  Rust is the inbred bane of iron and worms of wood and as those substances at last fall a prey to the evils that are congenial to their nature in the  same manner every  SINGLE KIND OF GOVERNMENT  breeds within itself some certain vice which soon causes its destruction Thus  ROYALTY  degenerates into Tyranny  ARISTOCRACY  into Oligarchy and  DEMOCRACY  into Savage  Violence  See Polybius Book vi Chap i    Such is the natural progress of the simple forms of government A mixed limited Monarchy has in its well tempered contexture the means within itself of checking every mischief and till a wild Democracy has overturned all wholesome laws  The SOVEREIGN MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE  is gigantic nonsense  full of sound and fury signifying nothing    The REFORM projected by the JACOBINS of this country would beyond all doubt  rip up the Constitution by the roots  At such a time the Author of the following Scenes thought if he could recall the minds of men to the origin and antiquity of the Constitution under which the people have enjoyed their rights their property and their liberty for above five hundred years his labours might have some tendency to stop the progress of the new philosophy and check the spirit of innovation Our form of government as Motesquieu has truly observed came to this country from the woods of Germany  L'Esprit des Loix Book  GAUL was reduced to a state of slavery while Germany displayed a spirit of independance  Arminius was the Great Hero of Germany TACITUS tells us That  he fought with alternate vicissitudes of fortune a man of warlike genius and beyond all question the deliverer of Germany He had not like the Kings and Generals of a former day the infancy of Rome to cope with he had to struggle with a great and flourishing Empire he attacked the Romans in the meridian of their glory he stood at bay for a number of years with equivocal success sometimes victorious often defeated but in the issue of the war STILL UNCONQUERED  Annal Lib II S  It was from that northern hive that our Saxon ancestors brought with them the same spirit of liberty and a plan of civil government They had experienced in their own country the disadvantages of the general suffrage of the people in a mass they had occasionally tried the more practicable mode of representation  Ut missis Legatis in Commune Consultarent Libertas an Pax Placeret  They had recourse to the same expedient in England The WITTENAGEMOT was accordingly established  consisting of the King the Barons and the Saxon Freemen The inferior orders of the people were still in bondage but the remedy was soon applied Letters of enfranchisement were granted not only to individuals but to the inhabitants of towns and cities who were admitted by their Representatives to a voice in the Great Council of the Nation The consequence was that the kingly power the privileges of the nobility and clergy and the rights of the commons were so happily blended that "I believe" says Montesquieu  so happy a form of Government never presented itself to the mind of man  L'Esprit des Loix Lib xi Cap vi viii    The Great Council of the Nation called under the ANGLO SAXON GOVERNMENT the WITTENAGEMOT in process of time took the name of PARLIAMENT and from that period has been the  Palladium  of British Liberty a noble fabric which our internal enemies would fain demolish by what they call a RADICAL REFORM  It is however to be hoped that a veneration for the antiquity of so glorious a Constitution and a due sense of the blessings  which mankind have enjoyed under it will animate all true Englishmen against their enemies whether foreign or domestic  The Author of Arminius has had the pleasure of working under a great master and in the Notes annexed to the Tragedy he has cited the passages which he has imitated because he knows that the sentiments will come with weight and authority from the great writer of political history That he has not been able to execute up to his own ideas and wishes he is too conscious but for a wellmeant endeavour no apology can be required  Published by BARKER and

Castle in View Colours flying on the Ramparts with  S P Q R  in large Letters German Tents Officers and Soldiers on the Heath  GOTHMUND  on Guard to him  EGBERT  EGBERT  HOW long must we protract this ling'ring siege  I hate all dull delay prompt execution  And manly vigour are the soldier's glory  GOTHMUND  Egbert 'tis true dispatch and sudden onset  Are the great springs of war but well you know  We have in Inguiomer a gallant chief  Fam'd for his warlike genius long distinguish'd  By his heroic ardour ever active  In the embattled field still rushing on  Prompt eager fierce and where the battle rages  Opposing ev'ry danger  EGBERT  In the field  I grant you Gothmund his renown is great  Arminius scarce outshines him But my friend  Where now that warlike spirit Tame inactive  We dream away the time and let that castle  Hold us at bay You know we might ere now  Have storm'd the works  GOTHMUND  Our numbers are too thin  To conquer by assault our little army  Was ill prepar'd To spare the lives of men  Our General chose to form a close blockade  And hop'd ere this by famine to reduce  A feeble garrison  EGBERT  So judg'd our Chief  For that he plann'd his measures but we know  Th' envenom'd hate the more than deadly feud  That like a pentup sire inflames Segestes  Ere since Arminius wedded to his daughter  Veleda is a pris'ner in the castle  By force her father seiz'd her dragg'd her with him  And there detains her obstinately bent  Never to let her husband see her more  GOTHMUND  No never  Distress and famine may consume them both  Content he'll perish with her  GOTHMUND  But Arminius  Will soon be here he comes by rapid marches  With a vast host the German world in arms  And then my friend then we may storm the works  One bold assault shall end this tedious siege  SCENE II  Enter a Soldier  EGBERT  Soldier that look impatient  SOLDIER  On my station  At yonder eastern gate I saw this arrow  Rise high in air and soon with quick descent  Fall on the outside of the castle wall  Short of th' intended mark It bore this paper  Brac'd round with care    He gives the paper    EGBERT  Reads    "Segestes summon all your firmest vigour  "Inspire your garrison let no distress  "Compell you to surrender With his legions  "Caecina is at hand to raise the siege  "Pass but an hour and he will bring relief"  What traitor has done this  GOTHMUND  Perhaps the deed  Of those deserters from the tribes of Gaul  Who came but yesterday with specious seeming  To join our banners  EGBERT  The whole Gallic race  Conquer'd by Caesar to their masters kneel  And crouch in bondage Proud of being stil'd  Th' Allies of Rome they cast a jealous eye  On all the states where liberty is cherish'd  But chief on Germany whose true born sons  Maintain their laws their independent rights  Brave unsubdued and undebas'd by slavery    Looks at the paper    This may be Gallic fraud but should the news  Authentic prove what then will Inguiomer  GOTHMUND  My friend no more Lo where he comes this way  SCENE III  Enter  INGUIOMER  with Officers and Soldiers  EGBERT  The presence of our Chief almost dispells  The sudden gloom that overcasts us all  These sudden tidings  INGUIOMER  Speak nor hold me thus  In wonder and suspense  EGBERT  Peruse that paper  INGUIOMER  And is it this alarms you Let me see it    Reads to himself  EGBERT  An arrow's flight was deftin'd to convey  The tidings to Segestes but this soldier  Safe to my hands deliver'd it  INGUIOMER  This paper  May be the stratagem of old Segestes  Caecina with his legions He advances  To raise the siege It is Segestes  That sent his lying arrow through the air  In hopes by false intelligence to check  The ardour of our troops and save from ruin  From certain ruin yon devoted walls  EGBERT  Might I advise 'twere best prepare this moment  To storm the works a feeble garrison  Will not resift a general assault  SCENE IV  Enter another Soldier  INGUIOMER  Ha with that airthose looksthat wild surprize  What have you seen What heard Speak tell me all  SOLDIER  The Romans are at hand with eager speed  They sweep along the vale  INGUIOMER  Deceive me not  SOLDIER  I would not do it They are now in sight  On the high summit of yon woodcrown'd hill  That fronts the western sun a sudden blaze  Of arms of shields and helms glanc'd o'er the field  I saw their banners and their glitt'ring eagles  Display'd in proud array  INGUIOMER  Could you descry  Their numbers  SOLDIER  No I could not of their strength  No certain estimate can yet be made  O'er the fam'd causeway long since made by Drusus  Their troops advanc'd I saw their cavalry  Forth issuing from the wood that skirts the plain  If their whole army was display'd to view  Their number is but small On solid ground  Perhaps their General may pitch his camp  INGUIOMER  What ho my faithful followers ourself will view  The number and the posture of their troops  Should they advance a wide extended marsh  Lies foul and deep before them On that spot  If they advance 'tis fix'd to give them battle  Their men and horses  a  on the slimy soil  Will fall a sacrisice and with their blood  Deluge the crimson marl  EGBERT  In stagnate pools  We have th'advantage there a German soldier  Fights in his element  INGUIOMER  While I go forth  'Tis yours brave Egbert to arrange your guards  Around the castle Let the heralds summon  Segestes to surrender Should he dare  Still to hold out a general assault  Shall whelm himself his castle and his friends  In one prodigious ruin  Exit followed by soldiers Warlike music  SCENE V EGBERT GOTHMUND  Soldiers c  EGBERT  At length he takes th' alarm but still his valour  I fear is rouz'd too late  GOTHMUND  Mean time my friend  I'll walk my round and visit ev'ry post  EGBERT  Observe both armies let me know their motions  GOTHMUND  If ought of moment happen you shall hear it  Exit  SCENE VI  EGBERT  Now let the herald summon to the walls  The proud Segestes  A trumpet sounds three times  A SOLDIER  From the rampart  Why that piercing clangor  What does your signal mean  EGBERT  To call Segestes  To hear our terms of peace  SOLDIER  Lo here at hand  Segestes come  SEGESTES  From the rampart  What now does Egbert mean  Why am I summoned to the walls  EGBERT  In pity  To all the wretched miserable Band  Whom you with fix'd hostility detain  Within those walls imprison'd I have call'd you  To treat in friendly parley  SEGESTES  Speak your purpose  EGBERT  Lay down your arms and with welltim'd submission  Atone for errors past throw wide your gates  A general pardon will restore you all  To your lov'd friends to life and liberty  With open arms your country will receive you  SEGESTES  Mistaken artful man is this a time  To lure us to your purpose Lo See there  Far as my eye can strain I see the Romans  On yonder plain that terminates the forest  I see their eagles their embodied legions  O'er the wide field their spears their shields and javelins  Flash sudden gleams of fire  EGBERT  There they must halt  And there encamp Should they attempt to wade  Through seas and pools they'll meet with sure destruction  Or ere they bring relief our scaling ladders  Shall stand against your walls our men shall form  Their military shell to sap your works  Burst down your gates with ruinous assault  And in one general havoc all your friends  Will glut the soldiers rage  SEGESTES  In vain proud man  In vain these menaces even now I see  The legions form their lines Behold see there  The battle is begun From yonder tow'r  I can survey the fortune of the field  You have my answer  Exit from the walls  SCENE VII  EGBERT  If the foe advances  To try the issue of a fierce engagement  I dread his skill and his superior judgment  There Inguiomer may fail Impetuous fury  And rashness oft have marr'd his noble daring  Gothmund what news Your looks denote your fear  Have the two armies met  SCENE VIII  To him  GOTHMUND  GOTHMUND  They have at first  The day was ours and gallant Inguiomer  Mow'd down the Roman ranks The fight  Was in the marshes fierce and obstinate  But on the marshy ground the Roman horses  Could find no footing goaded by their wounds  They made the soil more slipp'ry by their blood  And with their carcasses the troopers lay  All in one purple heap  EGBERT  And what has turn'd  The fortune of the field  GOTHMUND  The foe retreated  Back to the solid plain Elate with victory  Our men pursued them There our enterprize  Has met a check and ruin may insue  SCENE IX  Enter  SEGESTES  on the Rampart  SEGESTES  My friends I come to warn you of your fate  Though foes in war yet you are Germans still  Break up your camp or sure destruction hangs  On your devoted heads A band of Romans  From the high waving forest where they lay  Lodg'd in close ambush down the steep descent  Rush'd on th' astonish'd foe I see them now  They charge they fight they dye their swords in blood  They bear down all they follow and they conquer  Germans be warn'd by me depart at once  Fly from the fury of a conqu'ring foe  Exit  SCENE X  Enter a German Officer  OFFICER  Haste Egbert let us fly the day is lost  The Roman arms prevail our broken ranks  In wild confusion fly  EGBERT  And Inguiomer  Say what of him  OFFICER  He sounded a retreat  To the Visurgis he directs his course  On t'other side Arminius is arriv'd  Sound a retreat retire ere yet the Romans  Hew down the bridge  EGBERT  This terrible disaster  Has ruin'd all the siege at length is rais'd  Withdraw my friends flight is our only safety  Exit with the rest  SCENE XI  A Shout within a triumphant March is sounded Enter  CAECINA  followed by Officers the Eagles and Colours with  S P Q R  in large Letters  CAECINA  This day my fellowsoldiers this great day  Has added lustre to the Roman name  The genius and good auspices of Rome  Have led us on to conquest by your valour  Not the foe only but the rugged nature  Of this wild savage country has been conquer'd  The castle is reliev'd now let our friends  Throw wide their gates and here with grateful hearts  Hail their deliverers    The folding Gates are thrown open the Soldiers march forward and after them  SEGESTES  CAECINA  Segestes you are welcome welcome to your friends  To life and liberty  SEGESTES  If ardent zeal  By me exerted in the cause of Rome  Claims your regard I have not toil'd in vain  CAECINA  Your zeal is known and felt Germanicus  Wife just and equitable and still intent  On all th' events of war no sooner learn'd  That by  b  Arminius you were here pent up  Than by his orders with a chosen band  O'er a long track of moors and fens and forests  I march'd to your relief  SEGESTES  The virtues of your chief  I honour and esteem He has my thanks  CAECINA  Of his regard you will have further proof  For worth like yours new honours are intended  SEGESTES  I want no honours While I thus address you  You see a man who knows nor guilt nor fear  The Deified Augustus  c  in the class  Of Roman citizens enroll'd my name  Proud of that title I have since remain'd  Faithful to Rome and yet my country's friend  The friend of Germany My voice was ever  For peace with Rome for harmony and friendship  Between both nations  CAECINA  Had your voice been heard  SEGESTES  I had no influence that flaming brand  That torch of discord that ambitious chief  Arminius wing'd with the vaunt lightning's speed  In ev'ry region call'd aloud to arms  To arms against Segestes and his friends  To arms against the Romans Ev'n now  He rushes forward like the lion rouz'd  Lashing his sides and goaded on to fury  'Tis said he brings all Germany in arms  CAECINA  To blast his frantic hopes Germanicus  By rapid marches from the distant Rhine  Comes with his vet'ran troops Are all your friends  Releas'd from yonder castle  SEGESTES  They went forth  At th' Eastern gate  CAECINA  Did Segimund your son  Endure the hardships of the siege  SEGESTES  With grief  And burning blushes I recall his name  He has revolted  d  three whole years have pass'd  Since last these eyes beheld him He I fear  Has join'd Arminius Lo our train of women  Comes forth in slow procession  SCENE XII  A Number of Women from the Castle and after them  VELEDA  in pensive Silence her Hands strained to her Bosom and her Eyes fixed on her Womb e  SEGESTES  Lo Veleda  You there behold my daughter  CAECINA  There I see  In that fair form in that majestic mien  Each blooming grace and dignity of mind  SEGESTES  She was my only joy my best delight  My lov'd Veleda till with treach'rous arts  Arminius stole her from her father's arms  CAECINA  Afflicted fair why does that cloud of sorrow  Obscure those eyes and bend you to the earth  Like some fair flower beneath the beating rain  That droops its languid head Dispell your grief  And let those eyes no more be dimn'd with tears  VELEDA  Tears have forgot to flow their source is dry  Despair is now the portion of a wretch  Whom you have robb'd of all her soul holds dear  CAECINA  Why charge my conduct  VELEDA  Wedded to Arminius  Why am I sever'd from him  CAECINA  That you know  Was by your father's order  VELEDA  Even now  I bear the fruit of our connubial loves  And must my infant must my blameless child  Be born in slavery  CAECINA  Germanicus  Will soon be here The virtues of the Prince  His tender sympathy his social love  Will soften all your cares and give you comfort  VELEDA  Think you a heart like mine a German heart  That without liberty deems life a burthen  Think you a mind so form'd will bear to live  A day an hour in execrable bondage  Is that the comfort Rome affords the wretched  CAECINA  Ungen'rous thought for you a safe retreat  Shall be assign'd in the delightful clime  Of Italy where grief and busy care  No more shall cloud the sunshine of your days  VELEDA  And can the charms of luxury and vice  Can warmer suns and soft Italian seasons  Lull to repose a mind upon the rack  Infuse a base oblivion of my friends  And my lost husband In our boisterous clime  Fair liberty can soften all our cares  'Midst forests rocks and fens and hills of ice  It is our sun It gilds the horizon round  CAECINA  To  SEGESTES  I see the spirit of Arminius  Not of her father kindles in her breast  And thus inflames a weak deluded mind  Veleda hear me  VELEDA  Must I hence be dragg'd  A wretched captive with my babe unborn  Far from my native land And do you Romans  Unsheathe your swords to triumph o'er a woman  Do you wage war with infants in the  womb  CAECINA  Speak your request  VELEDA  Restore me to my husband  CAECINA  Segestes Speak your will  SEGESTES  'Tis yours to judge  Yours to decide which has the strongest claim  Her husband or her father She is the wife  Of fierce Arminius  f  and she sprung from me  CAECINA  Since sprung from you she merits gentle treatment  Arminius will be struck with Roman virtue  Veleda you are free a chosen band  In safety shall conduct you to your friends  Exit with Officers c  SCENE XIII SEGESTES VELEDA  SEGESTES  Alas my daughter can you leave me thus  VELEDA  And will you linger in this hostile camp  SEGESTES  The duty that a daughter owes her parent  VELEDA  Our country is our parent 'tis to her  Our love our duty all our faculties  Our wealth our pow'r our very lives are due  She is the common mother of us all  To you she calls to you she lifts her hands  She tears her hair implores you not to plunge  A Roman Javelin in her matron breast  Enter an Officer  OFFICER  A chosen band is ready to conduct you  To the Visurgis' banks  VELEDA  Alas my father  Here must I leave you  SEGESTES  Go farewell my child  VELEDA  Yet ere we part should the embattled armies  Meet in fierce conflict let my warning voice  Withhold you from the field whether you fall  Or conquer friends in a fierce civil war  Die by the hands of friends remember still  'Tis kindred blood that stains the crimson plain  SEGESTES  Farewell my child  VELEDA  Looking after him  Farewell perhaps for ever  May all the Gods of Germany direct him  Exit  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  An open Plain with the German Camp at the further end German Soldiers in different Groupes  EGBERT GOTHMUND  EGBERT  GOTHMUND this hurry this tumultuous uproar  Is big with doubt and fear and wild distraction  GOTHMUND  The harbinger perhaps of victory  EGBERT  Would it were true This soldier may inform us  Enter a Soldier  SOLDIER  Far as my eye could stretch I saw our men  From yonder western bank march o'er the bridge  GOTHMUND  Perhaps some canton sends auxiliary force  To join Arminius's army  Enter  SEGIMUND  EGBERT  Segimund  What have you seen What tidings do you bring us  SEGIMUND  From yon steep hill imbrown'd with waving woods  I saw the Roman eagles saw their legions  On the embattled plain I saw them rush  With force resistless on the broken ranks  Of our inferior numbers Flush'd with victory  They hung upon our rear till the Visergis  Check'd their career of slaughter Lo this way  The valiant Inguiomer  SCENE II  Enter  INGUIOMER  followed by Officers and Soldiers  INGUIOMER  Ye Gods of Germany forgive your soldier  If overpow'r'd by number I retreated  To save my gallant warriors from the sword  What man could dare I ventur'd Witness for me  This blunted sabre and this shiver'd javelin  And this my shield with honourable marks  Pierc'd and indented  SEGIMUND  In your country's cause  Your zeal and ardour have been long the theme  Of gen'ral praise  INGUIOMER  Yet to be thus compell'd  To raise the siege afflicts and goads my heart  It withers all my laurels  SEGIMUND  Does my father  Follow the Roman banners  INGUIOMER  Yes Segestes  Is fix'd in guilt Ere this brave Segimund  The castle has surrender'd to the Romans  SEGIMUND  And is Veleda is my sister left  To pine in bondage Must Arminius's wife  Be led in sad captivity to Rome  INGUIOMER  Too sure she must her father wills it so  SEGIMUND  This vile indignity with tenfold rage  Will fire our gallant chief will kindle fury  In ev'ry German breast and send the javelin  Launch'd with redoubled vigour to its mark  INGUIOMER  Thou brave young man had your heroic virtue  Inspir'd Segestes he had now been happy  Lov'd by Arminius honour'd by his country  But now the tainted rebel brands his name  SEGIMUND  He seiz'd me in his arms and from my friends  Bore me unconscious yet of tender years  To join the Romans  a  At the Ubian altar  Administer'd an oath an impious oath  To lift me in his league against my country  Three years have pass'd fine last these eyes behold him  I scarce should know him now As soon as reason  Dawn'd on my soul I saw the horrid guilt  Of waging war against my native land  I fled through forests drear I lurk'd in caves  And roam'd from place to place from state to state  Till late I join'd the standard of Arminius  INGUIOMER  Yonder I see him Lo he comes this way  SCENE III  Enter  ARMINIUS  Officers and Soldiers  ARMINIUS  My fellowwarriors my brave gallant friends  Ye gen'rous sons of freedom you are welcome  To the Visurgi's banks Arminius  With open arms receives you Though repuls'd  By the superior numbers of the foe  You have dar'd noblyInguiomer thou brave  Heroic chief th' invader will not long  Enjoy his victory I come in force  To check his pride from all the German states  Far as the Danube to the Northern ocean  I bring embodied nations to the field  INGUIOMER  I form'd a close blockade but still Segestes  The base the willing slave of his new masters  Scorn'd to capitulate Meantime Caecina  Advanc'd against me with superior numbers  My little army call'd aloud to battle  I led them on  ARMINIUS  I know it Inguiomer  I know each circumstance you've acted bravely  And has Segestes with his garrison  March'd forth to swear fidelity to Rome  INGUIOMER  So says the voice of fame  SEGIMUND  And there my sister  My lov'd Veleda she must there remain  In sad captivity  ARMINIUS  Thou generous youth  Thou worthy son of an ignoble father  Much I esteem your ardour much I honour  Your early virtue But your keen reflection  Plants daggers in my heart Arminius's wife  Led in captivity Distracting thought  Come dire revenge inspire me with the rage  Of the stern God of War that I may pour  Destruction of th' Italian spoiler's head  And whelm his legions in one mangled heap  A sacrifice to vengeance  INGUIOMER  You have rouzed  All that is man within me for that scene  Of glorious havoc for that just revenge  My bosom pants Come lead me to the onset  I burn to follow through the thickest ranks  And there to vie with your heroic deeds  ARMINIUS  Inguiomer we oft have fought together  And seen each other's volour In my tent  A council shall be held We there will plan  The time and order of our grand assault  Caecina is deliver'd by the gods  He and his army to the slaught'ring sword  This moment Segimund do you go forth  And issue orders that our scouts may range  The country round and with due care explore  The motions of the enemy their works  And station of their camp  SEGIMUND  Forthwith your orders  Shall be obeyed    Exit  SEGIMUND  INGUIOMER  A warlike soul like thine  Thinks nothing done while aught is unperform'd  One glorious onset will consummate all  And that I see is lab'ring in your breast  The time for fiery expedition calls  One blow decides the war By cold delay  We hazard all for should Germanicus  ARMINIUS  Does he alarm you  INGUIOMER  In the adverse camp  He is expected with his vet'ran legions  So say the pris'ners whom our troops have led  O'er the Visurgis it is sure intelligence  ARMINIUS  Have you not heard the great the glorious tidings  Germanicus in a career of victory  Far as th' Amisia's banks  Now the  Ems  near  Embden  had led his legions  He there made halt he paus'd and saw the danger  Of tracing back his steps far as the Rhine  Midst hostile nations all in ambush waiting  To hang upon his rear The coward fled  For shelter to his ships he spread his sails  And trusted to the waves The Northern ocean  Vast in circumference tempestous deep  Gave him no refuge Soon a storm arose  And heav'd the mountain billows to the sky  His fleet was scatter'd  b  some in distant isles  Were dash'd on pointed rocks by whirlwinds driv'n  The rest have perish'd in the brawling surge  INGUIOMER  So perish all who dare invade our country  ARMINIUS  Where now GermanicusUpon some rock  Perhaps he rolls his eyes around the wat'ry main  And there surveys the wreck of all his hopes  His boasted eagles in the roaring deep  All sunk and swallow'd up No aid from him  Caecina can expect In yonder camp  We hold another  c  Varus and his legions  SCENE IV  Enter  SEGIMUND  ARMINIUS  Why Segimund that eager hasteWhat means  That sudden clangor  A trumpet is heard at a distance  SEGIMUND  As I took my station  Far as the verge of yonder level plain  My straining eye perceiv'd a welloar'd galley  Cross the Visurgis From the highest mast  The olive branch the harbinger of peace  Was manifest to view  ARMINIUS  The olive branch  This Inguiomer is Roman policy  In their distress they are the friends of peace  INGUIOMER  Lo they are near at hand might I advise  Admit them to a calm a patient hearing  SCENE V  Enter  MARCUS  with Roman Soldiers and Standards  MARCUS  To thee Arminius our brave Roman chief  Sends me with terms of kind and friendly import  To thee too Inguiomer he proffers friendship  Oft have I seen you in the ranks of war  Enacting prodigies of valour  ARMINIUS  Say  Unfold your purpose Why approach our camp  MARCUS  Caecina means to prove the moderation  That sways his councils and by me he sends  A present that he knows will glad your heart  He sends your wife Lo where Veleda comes  Enter  VELEDA  MARCUS  Once more she's yours  Takes her hand  I thus resign her to you  ARMINIUS  Can this be possible Surprize and wonder  O'erpow'r each facultyOnce more Veleda  Thus do I see youWhat no God could promise  We are allow'd to meet again in life  I shall go wild with joy And do I see you  Once more restor'd to these fond circling arms  VELEDA  My brave my honour'd husband Once again  Free'd from captivity releas'd from bondage  A German wife whose  d  hymeneal gods  Form all her bliss her only joy on earth  Revisits her lost husband in his arms  Enjoys her sacred rightsthis rapture swells  Above all bounds and thus in tears of joy  Will force its way  Embracing him  ARMINIUS  Thou dear thou tender pledge  Of constancy and love To fold thee thus  Is joy and victory Not ev'n the day  That saw me triumph o'er three slaughter'd legions  And Germany reliev'd from proud oppression  When not a Roman Eagle hover'd o'er us  And with one loud acclaim consenting nations  Hail'd me "the brave deliverer of Germany"  Not ev'n that day with such sincere delight  Inspir'd my soul as that which now transports me  When Gracious Gods When thus I call you mine  Embracing her  And did your father did that haughty rebel  Resign you to me  VELEDA  No it was his wish  With pride and fix'd hoftility to you  To hold me still in bondage but Caecina  With mild humanity releas'd me to you  My brother here Here in Arminius' camp  Seeing Segimund  The soldier of his country  SEGIMUND  Oh My sister  Your great example in my country's cause  Inspires my soul with more than common ardour  VELEDA  Thou brave thou gen'rous youth  They embrace  MARCUS  Caecina scorns to wage a war with women  Though adverse in the field he still regards  A husband's rights and sends you back your wife  ARMINIUS  To own an obligation to a Roman  To me is thraldom Yet he has my thanks  MARCUS  Caecina means to give you stronger proof  That moderation governs all his actions  If you will listen to his just proposals  By his ambassador he means to offer  Fair terms of peace  VELEDA  I had forgot Your brother  Who came the leader of a Raman cohort  To see me safe deliver'd to your arms  Explain'd the Roman General's design  ARMINIUS  Where is my brother now  MARCUS  Close to yon bank  He halted with his men  ARMINIUS  Inform your General  When hostages in form have been exchang'd  By his ambassador he then may send  His overtures of peace  MARCUS  I shall report  Your answer to Caecina  ARMINIUS  Will you grace  Your Roman name by one more liberal act  MARCUS  Speak your request  ARMINIUS  My brother's near at hand  You Romans call him Flavius Will you grant  One friendly interview Though leagu'd with Rome  He is my brother still  MARCUS  Withdraw your guards  To Inguiomer deliver up your sabre  That no rude outrage may disturb your meeting  ARMINIUS  I promise it  gives up his sabre  you have my plighted faith  MARCUS  Together you may hold a friendly parley  He shall attend you here  ARMINIUS  You have my thanks  Farewell Veleda Segimund conduct her  To my pavillion You my friends retire  They go out  SCENE VI  ARMINIUS  alone  Since he revolted to the Roman banners  Four times the sun hath made his annual round  And in that time these eyes have not beheld him  Inspire me Gods with mild persuasive speech  With words of pow'r to wake each tender feeling  And melt into his heart But lo he comes  SCENE VII ARMINIUS FLAVIUS  e  ARMINIUS  I wish'd to see a brother By that name  Can I address you while that Roman garb  Declares hostility and speaks the man  Who has renounc'd his friends abjur'd his country  And bears a heart that to the pulse of nature  Answers no more  FLAVIUS  Accuse me not unjustly  I meet Arminius with a brother's love  ARMINIUS  Say you behold me with the pious love  You owe your country and with joy with rapture  Arminius springs to clasp you in his arms  FLAVIUS  Though I come hither from the adverse camp  And follow Caesar's standard yet my country  The welfare of all Germany the peace  And happiness of millions strongly plead  Here in this bosom those the pow'rful motives  That urge me to the war  ARMINIUS  And by that war  Is slavery the boon you mean to grant  To your devoted country For those bright  Those noble motives does that burnish'd helm  Display its lustre  FLAVIUS  This high plumed helmet  taking it off  Germanicus with his own warlike hand  Plac'd on my brow  ARMINIUS  And that unseemly scar  That marks your forehead and deforms your visage  What gen'rous hand bestow'd it  FLAVIUS  On the banks  Of the Adrana  Now the  Eder  in the  Landgravate of Hesse  where the Cattian nation  After a battle obstinately fought  Gave way at length to the undaunted valour  Of veteran troops I saw a Roman press'd  By a fierce German with his lifted sabre  When instantly I flew to his relief  And then receiv'd this honourable wound  But sav'd a Roman citizen from death  ARMINIUS  For that exploit that great heroic deed  What was your recompence  FLAVIUS  A civic crown  f  A military chain and other honours  That grace the Roman's valour  ARMINIUS  Did those honours  Glare in your eye and lure you from your country  FLAVIUS  They are my noblest pride  ARMINIUS  With a sneering laugh    You have the wages  Of a slave cheaply bought  g  FLAVIUS  Controul this violence  I have not merited this keen reproach  ARMINIUS  And do those baubles pay you for your treason  Contempt and laughter mix with indignation  Thou base deserter  FLAVIUS  Brother if you knew  The Roman character  ARMINIUS  Full well I know it  The nations of the world too long have groan'd  Beneath their iron rod And shall your Caesars  Your Caesars deified and for their crimes  Enroll'd among the Gods of Rome shall they  Who trample on their Senate and their people  Demand the homage of a freeborn race  And bid the Northern world embrace the yoke  FLAVIUS  Germanicus is lov'd where'er he's known  He leads the armies of Imperial Rome  To fame and victory Where now the spirit  Of the TUBANTES and the CATTIAN state  They have submitted and the Roman chief  Ensures his conquest by the arts of peace  He wins all hearts he calls the wand'ring savage  From fens from forests and from hills of snow  To settled mansions teaches them to form  New laws new cities to enjoy the sweets  Of civil union and of polish'd life  ARMINIUS  Their arts of polish'd life are Roman vices  The baits of luxury the balefull charm  That mingles in the cup delicious poison  To sweeten slavery  FLAVIUS  No more I'll bear  This torrent of abuse  ARMINIUS  With patience hear me  I now descend to humble supplications  I now conjure you by the sacred ties  Of honour by the love  h you owe your  country  Atone for what is past renounce your treason  By me your mother prays implores beseeches you  Not to betray your family and friends  Think of the vast renown of leading armies  To serve your country To that glorious conduct  Will you prefer the vile detested name  Of a deserter a perfidious traitor  FLAVIUS  Here break we off here end this impious strain  Against the lords and sov'reigns of the world  The friends of human kind Opposing them  'Tis you betray the interests of humanity  Hither I came disarm'd or my good falchion  Should vindicate the cause of Roman virtue  ARMINIUS  Presumptuous man I dare thee to the field  What ho bring forth my arms  Enter  MARCUS  MARCUS  Controul this rage  On terms of peace this interview was granted  Flavius withdraw you're wanted at your post  FLAVIUS  Farewell Arminius may we never meet  In the embattled field  Exit with Marcus  ARMINIUS  Thou traitor go  And 'midst the armed files avoid my sword  And yet must brothers meet in adverse arms  In kindred blood must they imbrue their javelins  'Tis ever thus when discontent and faction  Brood over fancied ills and fire with rage  Sons against fathers brothers against brothers  'Tis horror all and worse than civil war  End of the Second Act  ACT III  SCENE I  The German Camp  VELEDA SEGIMUND  VELEDA  OH Segimund to see you thus my brother  Arm'd in your country's cause to see you here  Here in Arminius's camp once more restor'd  To your best friends your country and your gods  Expands my tow'ring soul above all bounds  My joy wants words 'tis speechless ecstacy  SEGIMUND  Thanks to the gods who lent a ray of truth  To light and guide me to the paths of honour  I saw my father's guilt I saw him join'd  In a flagitious league against his country  There ceas'd a father's power there clos'd for ever  All his authority in vice and treason  I ow'd him no obedience  VELEDA  Your first duty  You owe your country and you now discharge it  Dear to your friends ennobled by your virtue  SEGIMUND  Oh had my father and Arminius's brother  Glow'd with due feeling for their country's wrongs  And in their bosoms own'd the sacred flame  Of public liberty we then together  Might join Arminius and together tread  The paths of war with mutual ardour fir'd  All gen'rous rivals in the field of glory  VELEDA  Alas vain hope Segestes views Arminius  With deadly hate implacable and fierce  Fix'd in his heart it gangrees there like poison  With that fell fury he made me his pris'ner  SEGIMUND  And did he mean to drag you in his train  Through all the horrors of wide wasting war  VELEDA  No I was destin'd to a distant clime  To some Italian city there he said  Perpetual spring and sunenliven'd scenes  Would teach me to abhor our northern tempests  There wean me from my friends and from the love  I bear Arminius But oh not for me  Gay gilded scenes and bright Italian suns  No let me wander on the mountains' ridge  Roam through the forest in the rapid bark  Ply the tough oar and glide along the stream  Give me my humble claybuilt tenement  Free from a master let me call it mine  That thought though tempests gather o'er my head  Will warm my heart amidst eternal snows  SEGIMUND  Arminius by his care those rights will guard  Ere long he means to give a loose to war  Gods should my father join the hostile ranks  My heart recoils with horror at the thought  VELEDA  Dispel your fears nor thus anticipate  Imaginary ills  SCENE II  To them  ARMINIUS  VELEDA  Arminius welcome  Your presence sooths my soul to peace and joy  ARMINIUS  Oh my Veleda By your late misfortunes  Endear'd and now more welcome to my arms  It joys me much to find you thus engag'd  In parley with your brother Segimund  Observe her well her councils will direct  And guide your steps she differs from her father  SEGIMUND  She breathes the energy of truth and virtue  Your camp to me is the true school of honour  ARMINIUS  Heroic youth with an observant eye  I've mark'd your zeal for liberty your prompt  Undaunted valour and your love of glory  The noblest gift a German chief can give  Shall grace your merit Go to my pavillion  And by my orders you will there receive  A warlike horse  a  with a victorious lance  Deep ting'd with Roman blood  SEGIMUND  This gen'rous proof  Of your esteem shall with the love of fame  Inspire my soul and kindle all its fires  ARMINIUS  A grand exploit a vast a glorious enterprize  Will soon take place To you shall be assign'd  A post of honour Inguiomer has help'd  To plan our measures he will tell you all    Exit  SEGIMUND  SCENE III  ARMINIUS VELEDA  VELEDA  With pride I see a brother's early virtue  ARMINIUS  Your gen'rous spirit animates his frame  One soul informs you bothVeleda tell me  Do you bring with you to your husband's arms  Unblemish'd honour Do you now return  Pure and immaculate unstain'd unviolated  By the proud spoiler the Italian robber  VELEDA  No ruffian dar'd with brutal violence  Assault my virtue torn from your embrace  Life had no charms and death had lost his terror  That was my safe guard she who dares to die  Protects herself the guardian of her honour  ARMINIUS  Thou best of women in the hour of peace  My joy my comfort in the embattled field  The brave inspirer of all martial deeds  To hear thy voice to have thee in the rear  The witness of my conduct  b  the applauder  Of ev'ry gallant action gives an edge  To my keen falchion nerves my lifced arm  And gives fresh ardour in my country's cause  VELEDA  Our nuptial rites instructed me in all  The rigid duties of a German wife  The sword the shield the spear and other gifts  Were the firm bonds  c  of our connubial union  Our hymenial gods From them I learn'd  It was my contract my religious vow  To be your partner in all toil and danger  To share your pains and dare with you in war  ARMINIUS  You have dar'd nobly with me in the shock  Of the embattled lines one thought of thee  Wing'd with the light'ning's speed has sent me forward  Into the thickest danger From the field  Your care receiv'd me rouz'd my drooping strength  Reviv'd my spirit as you counted o'er  Each honourable scar and dress'd my wounds  VELEDA  Then in those moments to embrace my soldier  To count with praise his honourable wounds  Apply the healing balm of plants and flow'rs  And aromatic shrubs was the delight  The tender office of a faithful wife  Who saw her hero in his country's cause  Defying danger prodigal of blood  The great deliverer of Germany  ARMINIUS  Grant me that triumph ye benignant gods  Crown me with that renown I then shall say  I've liv'd enough  d  for nature and for glory  VELEDA  Glory like yours no injuries of time  Will e'er extinguish in immortal bloom  Your dearbought laurels will for ever flourish  Your zeal for liberty shall be the theme  Of the whole northern world To fame like yours  The bards of Germany  e  shall tune their harps  And in immortal strains send down your name  To future times and with their pious hymns  Their sacred minstrelsy by your example  Inflame posterity to brave exploit  SCENE IV  To them  INGUIOMER  ARMINIUS  What tidings Inguiomer  INGUIOMER  I've seen the posts  The camp the works and numbers of the foe  Where the Visurgis pours a shallower stream  Join'd by a chosen band I forded over  And watch'd the motions of CAECINA's army  On a long narrow neck of solid ground  With fens and marshes round him close pent up  Upon an isthmus in the wat'ry waste  Their legions are inclos'd I saw their soldiers  All busy at the works entrenchments ramparts  And mounds of turf thrown up with sudden haste  Are now their only hope  ARMINIUS  Caecina there  Is insulated there imprison'd close  By fens and marshes By my special order  A chosen band already stand prepar'd  To issue forth and gain by diff'rent roads  The summit of yon hills there to unsluice  All the whole store of long collected waters  And deluge all the vale  INGUIOMER  The Romans then  May look aghast and shudder at their fate  ARMINIUS  The sun declining slopes his western wheels  And deep'ning into gloom the lazy clouds  Promise a night to veil the face of things  The troops design'd to circle round the hills  And lie in ambush there are they drawn up  And ready for their enterprize  INGUIOMER  They are all eager for the march yet ere they start  They wish to hear your animating voice  And from yourself receive their final orders  ARMINIUS  My gallant friends shall hear me Inguiomer  I go with joy to see their warlike spirit  I leave you now Veleda at the dawn  A glorious scene of havoc and revenge  A noble spectacle shall glad your eyes  Trust to my care you still shall live in freedom  Exit  SCENE V VELEDA INGUIOMER  VELEDA  Looking after him  By you defended by your gen'rous efforts  Protected guarded Germany is safe  From the oppressor's rod In him we see  The godlike spirit of those ancient worthies  Who toil'd or bled for liberty and laws  INGUIOMER  Years have elaps'd since by his patriot ardour  Expell'd exterminated the Romans fled  Beyond the Rhine Their boasted Emperor  Their deified Augustus dar'd no more  Invade the land his schemes of wild ambition  By one great overthrow he saw defeated  He pass'd his days in misery of heart  Wept for his loss and like a puny infant  Cried "Varus Varus  f  give me back my legions"  VELEDA  Oh may Tiberius who usurps the name  Of Caesar may that fell that savage tyrant  That monster of iniquity and fraud  Before the dawn relumes the purpled East  Oh may Arminius give him ample cause  To mourn his slaughter'd legions may he shed  The tear of bitt'rest anguish on the rack  Of a mind torn and goaded by his crimes  INGUIOMER  This very night we storm the Roman camp  Our plan is form'd our measures are concerted  Your brother will lead on a chosen band  A brave battalion There the gen'rous youth  May by his deeds immortalize his name  VELEDA  I doubt him not Within his bosom glows  The hero and the patriot Since the Gods  Restor'd me to my friends this very day  I saw my brother busy at his post  I paus'd and listen'd to him then I heard  The language of his heart A train of bards  With fervent zeal in flow procession came  Chaunting their heav'nly strains "My brother cried  "Come see me fighting in my country's cause  "If victory attends me  g  to your annals  "Add a young warrior if I fall in battle  "Record my memory"  INGUIOMER  He gives an earnest  Of matchless worth the rival of Arminius  SCENE VI  To them GOTHMUND  GOTHMUND  A barge with streamers waving to the wind  Has cross'd the river and ev'n now she lies  Closs anchor'd near the shore The Roman chief  Sends his ambassador  INGUIOMER  And have you seen  Arminius  GOTHMUND  With some chosen officers  He holds a Council in his tent and there  I could not tresspass on his privacy  VELEDA  Be mine that task from me he will not deem it  Illjudg'd intrusion I will seek him straight  Exit  GOTHMUND  Ere this the Deputy has reach'd our camp  Think you he brings such equitable terms  As may conciliate peace between the nations  And close the scene of carnage and destruction  INGUIOMER  'Tis fit he should have audience But in vain  I fear he comes Our frantic foes  Enur'd to war with mad ambition fir'd  And flush'd with hope of universal empire  Will ne'er agree to give the world a peace  On the broad base of justice and the laws  That bind consenting nations  SCENE VII  The back Scene draws In the middle a Throne raised with Turf A warlike March Soldiers walk forward and line the Stage on both sides  ARMINIUS  following and takes his Seat  ARMINIUS  At length the Roman general sees the streights  To which his scanty numbers are reduc'd  Destruction hovers o'er him in despair  Which he calls lenity and Roman virtue  By his ambassador he offers terms  But what ambassadorThat hoary traitor  Segestes is his delegate By him  He hopes to grace his cause that vile deserter  That foe to liberty that friend of Rome  Brings his insidious overtures He comes  To varnish o'er the slavery he loves  Conduct him hither let the traitor enter  SCENE VIII  Enter Soldiers bearing Ensigns and Eagles and after them  SEGESTES  ARMINIUS  Ere now Segestes we have often met  On better terms together we have sought  Th' embattled foe our hearts with equal ardour  Panting for glory and our pointed javelins  Thirsting for hostile blood But now that bond  Of gen'rous union is dissolv'd for ever  SEGESTES  Judge not too rashly Still this bosom glows  With social love still feels the sympathy  Of kind affections anger and resentment  For my lost daughter now subside in peace  Foes in the field in private we are friends  ARMINIUS  Friendship is founded on the noblest basis  On generous sentiment and public virtue  On truth on honour and congenial minds  Treason and honour never can embrace  Now speak your embassy I long to hear  The orator of Rome  SEGESTES  My embassy  Aims at the peace of Germany and Rome  Wide wasting war too long has made the land  A scene of desolation Helpless widows  Afflicted virgins and unhappy orphans  Are bath'd in tears Your fields are cover'd o'er  With the unburied limbs of slaughter'd soldiers  Romans and Germans all your sacred groves  Are levell'd in the dust and all your rivers  Surcharg'd with blood run purple to the sea  ARMINIUS  But whence those horrors Say with truth declare  Who were the authors of that wild destruction  SEGESTES  To trace our mutual errors to their source  And on the Roman or Cheruscan name  To fix the cause is not within my province  I come the harbinger of peace I come  To state the message of the Roman chief  It is his wish by justice and by mercy  Not by the sword to win consenting hearts  To call the wand'ring German to the arts  Of polish'd manners and of social life  'Tis on this basis he would raise his trophies  His truest glory  ARMINIUS  Still I'm lost in darkness  Wherefore this torrent of superslous speech  If your new masters call it eloquence  And Roman oratory still to us  'Tis the mere pomp of words and vain parader  You come to offer peace declare your terms  SEGESTES  Thus then Caecina by my voice informs you  Let the Visurgis be the western boundary  Of the Cheruscan state From thence the country  Far as the Albis  Now the ELBE  whose impetuous course  Empties its current in the Northern sea  Shall be your vast domain  ARMINIUS  Yet tell me more  Th' extensive region from the Western bank  SEGESTES  Far as the Rhine the nations shall submit  To the mild sway the wisdom and the laws  By which the glory of Imperial Rome  Means to reform and humanize the world  ARMINIUS  Rising  Is this the boasted justice of your masters  And is it thus they humanize the world  SEGESTES  Where'er they penetrate fair order dawns  ARMINIUS  Where'er they penetrate oppression follows  SEGESTES  The whole Cheruscan state is granted to you  You wage no war for conquest  ARMINIUS  The Cheruscans  Wish for no conquest conquest is the aim  Of murd'rer's flush'd with insolence and pride  The fell ambition of the haughty Romans  Gave us in evil hour Between the Rhine  And the Visurgis to behold their eagles  Their lictors tribunes  h  and their vile collectors  Exactions tributes cruelty and lust  Rapine and murderThese are their exploits  A band of robbersAre the nations rich  Happy and thriving  i  Roman avarice  Becomes their foe Do they endure distress  And pine in want Roman ambition still  Aims at new victory To them alike  The wealth and poverty of nations all  Must fall before your sov'reigns of the world  To rob and ravage is their art of war  And when they've made a solitude around them  They call it peace  SEGESTES  Their offer now imports  A firm a lasting peace Within your limits  Live safe and uninvaded Rome is willing  On terms to grant a vast extensive region  ARMINIUS  Rising  Think you I mean to merchandize  k  the war  To barter part of Germany By sale  And vile exchange to traffic for our own  Go tell your General my last resolve  Coming forward  Let him give back my country let him give  To freeborn men their unmolested rights  Their plan of laws their temples and their gods  From the Visurgis let him call his legions  Repass the Rhine and on the side of Gaul  Enjoy the bank which your divine Augustus  Vainly call'd Germany there let him dwell  In sullen majesty and let his Eagles  No more like Vultures hover o'er our heads  Let him do this Arminius grants him peace  SEGESTES  This haughty answer with redoubled fury  Will light the flame of war and once again  Wide wasting slaughter shall stalk o'er the land  ARMINIUS  Go and inform Caecina tell your Gen'ral  Till I have chas'd his robbers and freebooters  Back to the Rhine my sword shall ne'er be sheath'd  And if the Romans will not leave a space  A scanty space where I can live in freedom  Arminius for himself will find  l  a spot  Where he can die with honour  SEGESTES  Must I bear  This answer to Caecina  ARMINIUS  End we here  This war of words All parley now is clos'd  Conduct the traitor to his Roman friends    Exit  SEGESTES  with his Train  INGUIOMER  We thank you brave Arminius for this zeal  This gen'rous ardour for our sacred rights  ARMINIUS  'Tis yours my friends 'tis yours this very night  To prove by valour that the Gods reserve us  To be asserters of the public weal  And ere the dawn by one collected blow  To wreak our vengeance on the Roman race  End of the Third Act  ACT IV  SCENE I  The German Camp still continues  ARMINIUS INGUIOMER  ARMINIUS  THAT treach'rous slave the Ambassador of Rome  Has had his answer  INGUIOMER  When Caecina hears  The energy of truth the firm decision  That liberty inspir'd his heart will shrink  And shudder at the ruin that surrounds him  ARMINIUS  The blow must soon be struck the hour draws nigh  Time presses we are call'd his parting ray  The sun has spent and in suffusion red  His glaring orb is quench'd clouds roll on clouds  And night hangs low'ring on the drowsy world  Propitious to our purpose  INGUIOMER  All things favour  Our grand assault On yonder eastern bank  O'er the Visurgis where our bridge was join'd  To the main land the head has been destroy'd  By Roman caution but our boats and platforms  Well chain'd together will secure our march  ARMINIUS  By Heav'n this night Caecina and his legions  Shall share the sate of Varus once again  We shall exterminate the Roman race  Some strong emotion some prophetic ardour  Expands my breast and o'er informs my soul  I feel the god imagination burns  And colours to my sight a glorious scene  A scene of victory I see their camp  Floating in gore their tow'rs and ramparts storm'd  Their mangled bodies in one purple heap  Cov'ring the plain to feed the region kites  SCENE II  Enter  SEGIMUND  ARMINIUS  Segimund you come in time where are your friends  Gothmund and Egbert  SEGIMUND  Both with hasty step  Pursue me hither  ARMINIUS  Have you seen my orders  Duly obey'd  SEGIMUND  I have the men collected  Wait in their tents impatient for the signal  To issue forth and on the open plain  Form their battalions  SCENE III  Enter  GOTHMUND  and  EGBERT  ARMINIUS  Gothmund you are welcome  And you brave Egbert Inguiomer you see  The warlike chiefs who by my choice are destin'd  To burst the barriers of the Roman camp  And let wild uproar loose  INGUIOMER  Confide in them  Their valour in the field has oft been prov'd  ARMINIUS  Thus then my friends you Segimund must lead  A brave a chosen well compacted band  To storm the eastern gate Against the foe  Use his own arts The military shall  Form with your bucklers under that advance  To sap their walls and to hew down their gates  Those barriers levell'd rush undaunted forward  Enter their camp lead on your valiant troops  And plant your swords in ev'ry breast you meet  SEGIMUND  This night shall prove me worthy of your choice  ARMINIUS  Egbert 'tis yours to head a strong reserve  And follow in the rear support the ranks  And heap new terror on the astonish'd foe  You Gothmund must assault the western gate  A brave a warlike a well chosen number  Of fierce battalions will obey your signals  INGUIOMER  There at the head of well embodied squadrons  I plant my standard to watch all events  All turns and all vicissitudes of war  And if the foe alarm'd should sally forth  He'll rush on sure destruction  ARMINIUS  At the head  Of my division I shall circle round  To the wide open vale and in the woods  That skirt the borders find a station fit  For my battalions there in ambush wait  To intercept Caecina in his flight  And give his legions to the slaughtering sword  SEGIMUND  Our duty calls we'll seek our sev'ral posts  And form our lines  ARMINIUS  Yet stay another word  Remember all to move in silent order  Let not a stir no voice no sound be heard  Let ev'ry soldier hush his pent up valour  Till in one moment one collected blow  You burst upon 'em To conceal our march  A night of vapours hovers o'er our heads  While you advance let shouts and hideous tumult  Warsongs and howlings sound throughout our camp  With horrid uproar let fires blaze to heav'n  And dart a sudden lustre o'er all the field  Veleda comes my valiant friends farewell    Exeunt  INGUIOMEP SECIMUND EGDERT  and  GOTHMUND  SCENE IV ARMINIUS VELEDA  ARMINIUS  Approach Veleda in this awful moment  Big with the fate of Germany your presence  Brings joy and comfort Sure some pow'r above  Watch'd over all your ways some guardian god  From his religious grove sail'd through the air  To shelter innocence and give you back  To a fond husband's arms  VELEDA  And yet forgive me  Though with your words you charm my list'ning ear  And soothe each ravish'd sense to dear delight  Forgive Veleda if alarming fears  Come like the raven o'er some wretches' cottage  Foreboding ill this sad this aching breast  Ev'n in your presence mingles grief with rapture  ARMINIUS  Where now Veleda where thy wonted firmness  Is this a time for weak dejected passions  This night you know we storm the Roman camp  And bury all in ruin  VELEDA  In that rage  Of unrelenting slaughter my poor father  Ye gods if possible forgive his crimes  My father there may undistinguish'd fall  And add his body to the purple heap  ARMINIUS  Waste not a thought on him degen'rate man  He has long since renounc'd the tender ties  That bind in union parents sons and friends  All moral rectitude all virtue lost  What hope remains In a corrupted heart  Crimes grow on crimes the mind debas'd engenders  Pride faction murder stratagems and treason  Such is Segestes  VELEDA  He's my father still  ARMINIUS  He is a slave a Roman slave a vile  Deserter dead to honour and the love  He ow'd his country that supreme of laws  Nature's great edict in the human heart  VELEDA  Yet for a father tears will force their way  ARMINIUS  Restrain your tears your sorrow is illtim'd  Say have you seen my squadrons are they rang'd  In order for their march  VELEDA  Drawn up in ranks  They wait the signal Fires as you directed  Blaze through the camp and as they dart around  Their sudden light'ning on the burnish'd arms  I saw the soldiers' looks Each ardent eye  Flashes with martial fire In silence fix'd  Each warriour medidates his deeds of valour  His brave exploits in fancy ere he starts  His javelin quivers in a Roman's heart  ARMINIUS  Brave warlike men I go this moment  To let them know the order of their march  But see where Inguiomer  VELEDA  Our tunefull bards  And all our German wives  a  resolv'd to urge  The grand assault and animate the fray  Are now assembled I must

have gome my round  Through the wide camp A nobler show of war  Was ne'er display'd Impatient of delay  They wield their javelins and demand the signal  ARMINIUS  Anon our march begins Well Segimund  You come in haste  Enter  SEGIMUND  SEGIMUND  I've summon'd all the chiefs  To meet you here This way they bend their steps  ARMINIUS  I first must see the troops of my division  The men require my presence With dispatch  My orders shall be giv'n so tell the chiess  You Inguiomer receive them let them here  Wait my return A moment brings me to you  Exit  SCENE VI INGUIOMER SEGIMUND  SEGIMUND  The Gods in justice to mankind lead on  A terrible example to the pride  And the ambition of these fierce invaders  Who well deserve their fate They taste at Rome  The sweets of liberty yet hither come  To the Visurgis' banks to trample on the necks  Of independent nations  INGUIOMER  There my friend  You are deceiv'd you know not all the truth  Rome is no longer free her fam'd Republic  Is now no more her boasted liberty  Yields to a tyrant and long since she fled  Far from soft seasons and Italian skies  To dwell in our tempestuous Northern clime  Henceforth a Scythian  b  and a German blessing  SEGIMUND  As such we'll cherish it The warriors come  SCENE VII  Enter German Officers and Soldiers They Line one side of the Stage the  BARDS  at the top and the Women behind them with  VELEDA  in the Centre  INGUIOMER  My friends I read impatience in your looks  The God of war inspires uncommon ardour  Soon will Arminius  SEGIMUND  Lo the hero comes  SCENE VIII  Enter  ARMINIUS  ARMINIUS  My fellowwarriors you brave gen'rous band  A great occasion calls us to the field  A glorious enterprize Let us go forth  The champions of our country We are summon'd  By the loud voice of nature ev'ry motive  That can excite and animate our valour  All causes that inflame the heart of man  Conspire this night to draw the avenging sword  From hence I date the liberty of Germany  The REQUISITION of the proud invader  No more shall force our sons to join their standard  And in a mass to fight their foreign wars  No more our virtuous wives and virgin daughters  Shall suffer brutal lust and violation  The Romans are surrounded close besieg'd  No means of flight By the immortal gods  They are deliver'd victims to our swords  A trumpet sounds  INGUIOMER  That sound proclaims the signal for the march  ARMINIUS  'Tis as I order'd Oh my gallant friends  My brave associates if your country's cause  Glows in your bosoms if you feel the glory  Of your renown'd forefathers if the flame  The sacred flame of liberty inspires you  If you prefer the plan of ancient laws  To foreign tyrants and a foreign yoke  Now grasp your javelins now unsheathe your swords  In me behold your Gen'ral in the field  Behold your fellowsoldier follow me  Follow Arminius I will marshal you  To fame to liberty immortal glory  A warlike march  Exit followed by all  The Bards come forward singing    Hark warriors harkThat voice again  A warning voice heard you the sound  To arms it cries to arms ye freeborn men  To arms the woods  To arms the floods  To arms to arms the echoing hills rebound    The thunder rolls the light'nings glare  The gods are rushing to the plain  Their chariots glitter in the air  Death in his shroud  Rides in a cloud  And liberty calls forth her martial train    Ye warriors seek th' embattled throng  For freedom who his zeal displays  His fame shall live in sacred song  And tuneful rhyme  To latest time  The Bards of Germany shall sound his praise  Exeunt  The Women come forward singing  VELEDA  in the centre  Yes go ye gen'rous band  Firm champions of the land  O'er all the field  Your javelins wield  Where'er you rush still in the rear  Your wives and daughters you shall hear  Our warsongs and our cries  Shall rend th' astonish'd skies  Till you unsluice a crimson flood  And stretch th' invaders welt'ring in their blood    Exeunt  VELEDA  following them  SCENE IX  The Roman Camp  MARCUS VALERIUS  MARCUS  A night of such impenetrable darkness  I scarce remember  VALERIUS  'Tis a night of horror  But safe from danger  MARCUS  Still at ev'ry post  We must keep careful watch  SCENE X  Enter  CAECINA  CAECINA  In this deep gloom  This more than midnight horror have you mark'd  A stir a motion from the adverse camp  MARCUS  There the barbarians sacrifice the hours  To joy and revalry and wild carousals  At intervals we hear them hills and valleys  Ring with the hideous roar Their blazing fires  At times illumine the incumbent clouds  And shew their distant camp  VALERIUS  From a deserter  Just now arriv'd I learn their secret councils  He is a Gaul by birth  CAECINA  Where is he now  VALERIUS  At hand he waits your pleasure  CAECINA  Lead him hither  Exit Valerius  We must break up our camp Germanicus  Can bring us no relief The brawling waves  Have sunk his ships  c  and he perhaps is lost  An hour before the dawn we must depart  Marcus let all be ready for our march  Exit Marcus  SCENE II CAECINA  and  DUMNORIX  one of the  GAULS  CAECINA  You come resolv'd to join the Roman banners  DUMNORIX  My name is Dumnorix the friend of Rome  I hate Arminius and his wild ambition  CAECINA  When did you leave his camp  DUMNORIX  This very day  When Inguiomer before your conqu'ring sword  Cross'd the Visurgis Then Arminius  Inflam'd to madness burning for revenge  Vow'd the destruction of the Roman name  CAECINA  Means he this night to try the chance of war  DUMNORIX  This night his troops must rest Tomorrow's sun  Will light him to the onset  CAECINA  For this news  You have my thanks  DUMNORIX  I came with nobler views  Say but the word and ev'n this very night  Arminius may be conquer'd  CAECINA  Name the means  DUMNORIX  By a mix'd goblet dash'd with secret aconite  Or a barb'd arrow ting'd with deadly poison  I can dispatch him  CAECINA  Would'st thou thus instruct  A Roman Gen'ral in the trade of murder  A fell design like yours in elder times  Was offer'd to the Senate  d  That august  That great assembly scorn'd it with disdain  And caution'd Pyrrhus to protect his life  Such was the virtue of the Roman state  It still survives We conquer sword in hand  And wage no war by murder or by poison  DUMNORIX  My friends from Gaul have sworn  CAECINA  Go seek your friends  DUMNORIX  The glory may be mine  CAECINA  Away no more    Exit  DUMNORIX  Detested perfidy  MARCUS  Entering  What ho to arms  Muster our forces sound there sound th' alarm  SCENE XII CAECINA MARCUS  CAECINA  Ha Marcus speak what fraud what stratagem  MARCUS  While the barbarians riot in their camp  Their troops in silent order have advanc'd  And now invest our ramparts  Enter  VALERIUS  VALERIUS  Haste or all is lost  At the Praeterian gate collect our strength  CAECINA  Be that my care go where our works are weak  There make your firmest stand  Exit followed by soldiers  Enter a  SOLDIER  SOLDIER  Marcus this way  Haste

and quit this mournful scene  VELEDA  Alas my Segimund no crime is thine  It is the guilt of tumult and revolt  The epidemic madness of the times  When discontent and jealousy and faction  When strife and wild ambition sow the seeds  Of partyrage when civil discord arms  Sons against fathers  f  brothers against brothers  Then kindred blood is spilt then horrors multiply  And nature shudders at a sight like this  Pointing to the dead bodies  MARCUS  My duty calls me hence you must depart  VELEDA  Yet grant my pray'r and by one gen'rous act  Shew that you Romans feel the touch of nature  Let me bear hence the bodies in our camp  Let me interr them let me lay together  My father and my brother and with tears  Pay the last office to their cold remains  In life divided let one grave unite them  MARCUS  It shall be so I yield to your request  Soldiers bear hence the bodies  They are carried off  VELEDA  For this kindness  Accept my thanks They both are now at peace  From this sad spectacle this scene of woe  All Germany may learn the dire effects  That flow from partyrageThis day may give  A lesson to the world and teach the nations  That civil union is their truest bliss  And late posterity when these disasters  Shall be recorded by th' historic muse  May learn by our example to avoid  These fatal errors Over crimes like these  Oh may they shed a salutary tear  And fathers sons and families unite  One voice one heart to guard their native land  End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE I  The German Camp  CHELDERIC TREBANTES  Both of them Gauls  TREBANTES  CHELDERIC these Germans made a bold assault  But Roman discipline repell'd the fury  Of wild barbarians  CHELDERIC  For this night they've conquer'd  But in broad daylight what must be their fate  Their little army cannot meet the numbers  With which Arminius covers all the plain  As well the level shore may stand the fury  Of the rough northern sea when lash'd by winds  It rolls its mountain billows on the land  TREBANTES  And yet if our proposal has been heard  If from the Roman Dumnorix has met  With due applause a cheap an easy victory  Will end the war  CHELDERIC  And lo our hero comes  SCENE II  To them  DUMNORIX  CHELDERIC  Dumnorix you're welcome  DUMNORIX  To avoid  All prying eyes I've walk'd a weary round  Through woods and fens  CHELDERIC  And does the Roman chief  Approve our plot  DUMNORIX  Is thus Caecina known  Govern'd by scruples by fantastic rules  Of pride of honour and dry musty maxims  He talk'd I know not what of ancient Rome  And scorns our proferr'd aid  CHELDERIC  Shortsighted man  His low contracted spirit will not see  That victory obtain'd by fraud or valour  Ensures success  a  and cover'd stratagem  Alike with laurels decks the hero's brow  DUMNORIX  Caecina is no general I talk'd  With the brave leaders of th' allies from Gaul  All with one voice applaud our enterprize  They promise bright rewards no more at present  I hear the sound of steps this way advancing  We will confer in private  SCENE III  To them  GOTHMUND  GOTHMUND  Our whole army  Is under arms all at their prÃ²per posts  What keeps you from your station  DUMNORIX  Has Arminius  Enter'd the camp  GOTHMUND  Not yet do you go forth  And join your standards loiter here no more    Exeunt  DUMNORIX CHELDERIC TREBANTES  What mean those Gauls What brings them thus together  They meditate some dark design perhaps  To be deserters to the Roman camp  SCENE IV INGUIOMER GOTHMUND  GOTHMUND  What of Arminius  INGUIOMER  Frequent messengers  With eager speed come posting to the camp  Arminius is at hand to me he sends  His orders all must rest upon their arms  Ready for action when occasion calls  GOTHMUND  His warlike spirit never knows a pause  No danger can deter him nought can check  His active genius till he tow'rs above  Whate'er oppos'd his course  INGUIOMER  Tomorrow's dawn  We'll see him with determin'd vigour  Rush to the field and thunder through the war  SCENE V  To them  EGBERT  EGBERT  Marcus the Roman officer has gain'd  A passport to the camp He says he brings  A message of high import from Caecina  INGUIOMER  Conduct him hither    Exit  EGBERT  On his narrow isthmus  Besieg'd and sore beset perhaps the Roman  Means to capitulate  SCENE VI  Enter  MARCUS  MARCUS  Caecina sends me  To claim an audience of Arminius  INGUIOMER  He soon will join us here What is your errand  MARCUS  Our Gen'ral sends this letter to your Chief  A letter fraught with matters of high moment  INGUIOMER  Say do you come to offer terms of peace  MARCUS  Soon as Arminius sees the generous spirit  That sways directs and guides Caecina's heart  Your Chief may think hostilities should cease  And with the sympathy of noble minds  Unite in ties of friendship  INGUIOMER  This to me  Is a dark mystery unfold your purpose  MARCUS  Here in your very camp a plot is form'd  Against Arminius's life no more has reach'd  My ear that letter will disclose the whole  Gives the letter  Here ends my embassy the time demands  That I return with speed to join our friends  INGUIOMER  Egbert be it yours to guard him hence  Give him safe conduct to the Roman camp    Exeunt  MARCUS  and  EGBERT  SCENE VII INGUIOMER GOTHMUND  GOTHMUND  A dark conspiracy against the life  Of our brave Chief here in our very camp  INGUIOMER  You hear it gods and does your thunder sleep  Will you not send your forked lightning down  Wing'd with red vengeance on the traitor's head  GOTHMUND  Soon as Arminius  Sound of trumpets  INGUIOMER  In good time he comes  That trumpet's clangour speaks the Chief's arriv'd  SCENE VIII  Enter  ARMINIUS  attended by guards  ARMINIUS  Inguiomer these checks but serve to animate  The martial spirit of a warlike race  INGUIOMER  Protected by the friendly gloom of night  Caecina and his army stood at bay  Around their camp no glim'ring ray of light  Shew'd us their works mean time our lamps and torches  Made us a mark for all their missive weapons  Our lights extinguish'd courage then was useless  Disorder and consusion follow'd None could see  Where to assault I sounded a retreat  ARMINIUS  Wisely you judg'd tomorrow's orient sun  Shall see his legions overwhelm'd in ruin  INGUIOMER  Since then an officer has brought this letter  It is address'd to you  ARMINIUS  To me a letter  Give it let me see it  Reads  The sense of honour that governs the mind of a Roman general will be seen in this letter I write to caution you against a foul conspiracy A Gaul this day deserted from your army The villain has set a price upon your life and for that reward is ready to end your days by poison I need not tell you that I rejected his offer with indignation An enemy in the field I scorn  the trade of a base assassin Be upon your guard against clandestine enemies Farewell  If this be true I can almost allow  A Roman still may have a sense of honour  If any Gauls are lurking in our army  GOTHMUND  Their number is not great but I have watch'd them  With an observant eye  ARMINIUS  They are a traiterous race  Had they made head against the Roman arms  Like men who knew the value of their liberty  Th' imperial Eagles soon had wing'd their flight  To their Italian realms and slavery  Repass'd their Alpine hills to dwell at Rome  And with their senate kneel at Caesar's feet  INGUIOMER  They fought in parties and the whole was conquer'd  ARMINIUS  All civil union was to them unknown  Strangers to liberty and now subdued  To crouch in bondage the ambitious slaves  Would raise the tree of tyranny and overturn  In every state in all the nations round them  The laws that hold society in peace  INGUIOMER  We must be wary Gothmund we must look  With circumspective eyes watch ev'ry motion  All secret meetings and by due attention  Mar this detested project  ARMINIUS  For his conduct  Caecina claims both gratitude and praise  But has he sent that false perfidious Gaul  Back to our camp  GOTHMUND  The traitor still is there  ARMINIUS  Let a well chosen officer be sent  To tell Caecina that his gen'rous action  Reflects a lustre on his name but still  To crown the deed with glory the assassin  Must be deliver'd up to justice tell him  'Tis my request  INGUIOMER  Soon as the slave arrives  A strict enquiry will afford a clue  To guide us through the maze of their designs  And trace the Gauls who tamper'd in the treason  ARMINIUS  Gothmund do you select some trusty officer  To bear our message let him strait depart    Exit  GOTHMUND  INGUIOMER  Caecina will comply  ARMINIUS  And if he does  I in my turn will act a gen'rous part  His little army shall have leave to march  Free unmolested to the distant Rhine  I'll sheath the sword and for such splendid merit  Spare the effusion o'en of Roman blood  How wears the night  INGUIOMER  'Tis now the second watch  ARMINIUS  Are the troops all arrang'd as I directed  INGUIOMER  They're under arms and at their sev'ral posts  All watchful stand impatient to renew  The charge and though repuls'd with joy they find  They have sustain'd no loss  ARMINIUS  They have sustain'd  A loss we all must feel and long must mourn  That brave heroic youth the gallant Segimund  Whose early virtues were by all admir'd  Who won each soldier's love whose spring of life  Promis'd an harvest of immortal glory  He is no more  INGUIOMER  No hostile hand subdued him  ARMINIUS  Alas I know the whole disast'rous story  I've seen Veleda she has told me all  I left her paying the last funeral rites  To her lov'd brother to her father too  She grants sepulchral honours though his crimes  Drew vengeance on his head Veleda's virtue  Is ever lovely and adorns her name  She mourns a father lost and while to him  She pours the heartfelt tribute of her tears  Her filial piety demands our praise  SCENE IX  To them  GOTHMUND  GOTHMUND  Your orders are obey'd I have dispatch'd  A deputation to the adverse camp  ARMINIUS  The time now calls for action Inguiomer  We will go forth to visit ev'ry post  And with true ardour fire the soldier's breast    Exeunt  ARMINIUS  and  INGUIOMER  GOTHMUND  Would that this treach'rous Gaul were in our pow'r  Upon the rack the slave shall die in torment  And his accomplices shall share his fate  SCENE X  To him  VELEDA  VELEDA  Oh 'tis too muchthis agony of mind  It is too muchit pierces to the quick  It rends each tremb'ling nerve about the heart  GOTHMUND  Veleda why this violence of sorrow  VELEDA  Oh Gothmund the adventures of this night  GOTHMUND  Do they afflict you The dun shades of night  Shelter'd the foe we sounded a retreat  But at the dawn Arminius will revenge it  His plan is form'd already  VELEDA  Well I know  Arminius has resources in his vast  His warlike genius But with all his valour  Can he assuage my sorrows I have lost  More than the treasury of words can tell  More than imagination can conceive  My brother Segimund He's lost for ever  GOTHMUND  For him our men are overwhelm'd with sorrow  We all lament his fate  VELEDA  I know all must  But bitter anguish is for me alone  I found him in the moment of his victory  Gash'd mangled bleeding gasping on the ground  Like a fair flow'r in all its blushing honours  Shorn by the scythe and with'ring in its bloom  GOTHMUND  It was his own rash act he knew no guilt  VELEDA  It was his father's crime his father fell  In arms against his country Segimund  Unconscious struck the blow for justice  But the affections of a heart like his  Pierc'd to his soul and drove him to despair  Dear youth he's lost and with him ev'ry virtue  Heroic ardour honour truth and love  And ev'ry grace that could adorn his youth  To full perfection rising all is vanish'd  All all is lost for ever ever lost  GOTHMUND  Arminius still remains his tender care  Will minister relief and heal your woes  VELEDA  Arminius is the idol I adore  But busy memory will know no rest  A much lov'd brother will be ever present  His lovely image still will glide before me  But these sad eyes must never more behold him  I've wash'd his wounds and bath'd him with my tears  Over his clay cold corse I've thrown my mantle  Close to his side I've laid his warlike javelin  And as he order'd stretch'd his father by him  In his cold grave he rests but worth like his  Will ever live and with his fame enrich  The annals of his country  A deep Groan is heard from a distance  Hark that sudden groan  GOTHMUND  Be not alarm'd you soon shall know the cause  Exit  VELEDA  Almighty Gods if from your stores of wrath  Your awful will prepares some new affliction  Suspend your purpofe spare a wretch like me  Gothmund you look aghast  Enter  GOTHMUND  GOTHMUND  I scarce can speak  My blood recoils my tongue denies its office  VELEDA  Ha what disaster speak relieve my fears  GOTHMUND  On his tribunal as Arminius stood  In act to animate the list'ning soldiers  While torches cast their vivid blaze around him  A barbed arrow from some ambush'd villain  Flew to its destin'd mark and pierc'd his heart  VELEDA  Let me this moment fly to his relief    Exit  VELEDA  GOTHMUND  Relief I fear is vain speak Egbert fay  How fares Arminius  Enter  EGBERT  EGBERT  All who boast their skill  In medicinal lore exert their art  To draw the arrow from his bleeding wound  Enter  VELEDA  VELEDA  Oh what a spectacle of woe and horror  This way they lead him what a sight is there  Pale pale and wan ye gods protect his life  SCENE THE LAST ARMINIUS  is led forward  INGUIOMER  Officers Women and Soldiers round him  ARMINIUS  Assist me lend your aid conduct me forward  A little onwardhere here set me down  VELEDA  Arminius speak 'tis your Veleda calls  How fare you now  ARMINIUS  Oh I am sick at heart  My strength decays fair daylight closes o'er me  Approach draw near let me once more behold you  VELEDA  My feeble frame gives way my flutt'ring heart  Throbs wild with agony it sinks within me  Gods is there no reliefCompose your spirits  Rest may restore you  ARMINIUS  Oh no rest for me  The barbed arrow pierc'd too deep too deep  They wrench'd it out they made a breach in nature  They tore my frame asunder  VELEDA  To these wounds  The healing art may minister relief  ARMINIUS  Nought can avail the swift the subtle poison  VELEDA  Poison  ARMINIUS  It burns it rankles in my veins  VELEDA  Oh let me with these lips draw forth the venom  The deadly aconite  c  let me imbibe  That I may save all that my heart adores  ARMINIUS  You are too goodthe poison is diffus'd  Through all my frameit burns an inward fire  Consumes my veins those pangs must end me soon  Enter  EGBERT  EGBERT  Inguiomer our Herald is return'd  The treach'rous Gaul he finds is in our camp  His name is Dumnorix  GOTHMUND  That slave is seiz'd  With his accomplices they all shall suffer  Whate'er the keenest torture can inflict  ARMINIUS  Let not a thought of me let no resentment  Inspire revenge and cruelty proceed  As justice warrants and the laws direct  EGBERT  The Romans in despair have fled their camp  Already they have cross'd the narrow isthmus  And urge by rapid marches tow'rd the Rhine  ARMINIUS  Assist me raise me up All gracious pow'rs  Ye guardian gods of Germany to you  I lift my hands to you in gratitude  I bow thus lowly down to you I offer  My humble adorationI have liv'd  To see my country free once more to see  The Roman Eagles and their boasted legions  In terror wing their flight across the Phine  They are exterminated they are gone  They've vanish'd from the landI die content  Falls back in his chair  VELEDA  Is there no help to save so dear a life  Bring ev'ry aida pale a livid hue  Spreads o'er his featuressee his eyes are fix'd  ARMINIUS  Raise me once again Now mark my words  Should the ambition of aspiring Rome  Muster her legions should her arms prevail  And leave no spot where freedom can reside  Bear to my Saxon friends my last advice  Let them embark for Britain there they'll find  A brave a hardy race who by their valour  Made Caesar from their coast unfurl his sails  And save his legions by inglorious flight  INGUIOMER  Your orders shall be faithfully perform'd  ARMINIUS  Yet morewhen landed on that happy shore  Let my friends join in union with the natives  Britons and Saxons there may form one people  And from the woods  d  of Germany import  A form of government a plan of laws  Wise just and equitable laws of force  To guard the gen'ral weal and on the base  Of public liberty of social order  And equal justice raise the noblest fabric  Of civil union like their own proud cliffs  'Midst wild commotions still to stand unshaken  And be in time the envy of the world  VELEDA  My spirits sink I faint support me  Leans on a Woman's arm  INGUIOMER  Ev'n now  When flutt'ring life is on the wing to leave him  The safety of his friends claims all his care  ARMINIUS  Raising himself  Another word it is my warning voice  Let Britons guard their coast against the Gauls  And never never let that treach'rous race  NOR THEIR DESCENDANTS to the latest time  Obtain a footing on their seagirt isle  Let Britons seize the trident of the main  And plunge th' invaders in the roaring surge  A band of slaves who would reduce mankind  To their own level and enslave the world  An hoard of savages freebooters murderers  Who trample on all laws who own no gods  Whom in a mass their country disembogues  By depredations to lay waste their neighbours  And spread rebellion anarchy and ruin  VELEDA  Alas these strong exertions are too much  They waste his vital spiritSeebehold him  He faints he dies and oh must I survive him  ARMINIUS  I burn I burn that pang 'tis past and yet  Thus ling'ring on the margin of both worlds  A ray of light perhaps breaks in upon me  A time may come when Germany shall send  A royal race allied to Britain's kings  To reign in glory o'er a willing people  I see the radiant aera dawn I see  The great event when in a distant age  A monarch sprung from that illustrious line  Shall guide the state give energy to laws  And guard the rights of man his throne encircl'd  Adorn'd illumin'd by a train of virtues  That win all hearts and arm each honest hand  In the great cause of freedom and the laws  For which their ancestors in ev'ry age  Toil'd fought and bravely conquer'd then bequeath'd  Seal'd with their blood a glorious legacy  A SACRED TRUST to all succeeding times  Sinks back in his chair  VELEDA  Alas he dies is there no art to soften  These mortal pangs Support him Inguiomer  Assuage his sorrows lull him to repose  ARMINIUS  Farewell my friendsfarewellI can no more  Life ebbs apace my weary nature sinks  Yet ere I die Veleda once again  VELEDA  My feeble frameconduct me lead me to him  ARMINIUS  My eyes are dimwhere are you reach your hand  Offers his hand falls back and dies  INGUIOMER  There fled the best the purest noblest spirit  That e'er inform'd the patriot breast  VELEDA  To me  What now is life I will not linger here  In this bad world a miserable wretch  Condemn'd to solitude and endless woe  Give me this dagger    snatches it    now Arminius now  I comeI follow thee  Going to strike  INGUIOMER  Restrain this rage this frantic wild despair  Holds her arm  VELEDA  Offset me freeyou shall not chain me down  In agony of mind in restless misery  Oh let me follow himArminius no  No nothing shall divorce us  Raising her arm  A FEMALE ATTENDANT  Horror forbear I must arrest your arm  The blow that ends you murders innocence  A mother still should hear the voice of nature  VELEDA  Why hold me thusand yet those tender accents  FEMALE ATTENDANT  Think of the infant whom you still support  The precious babe that waits to see the light  VELEDA  My precious babe  Looking tenderly at her  FEMALE ATTENDANT  'Tis yours to rear and cherish it  VELEDA  My unborn babe that waits to see the light  Melts into tears and her dagger fulls  INGUIOMER  This is thy triumph pow'rful nature this  Thy gen'rous instinct thou prime source of virtue  VELEDA  Oh what a precipice of guilt and horror  Have I escap'd My child destroy'd by me  Ev'n by the mother's handunbidden tears  You choak all utt'rance the bare image strikes  It cleaves my very heartArminius now  Farewell awhile you point me back to life  You bid me here endure the load of grief  To rear the tender charge you have bequeath'd me  That duty done perhaps the gods may send  A son to emulate your great example  Grant me that pray'r and then with joy with transport  From this sad dreary world I'll wing my flight  To trace your path in yon empyreal skies  Lies by the body  INGUIOMER  There died the friend of liberty and man  The champion of his countryO'er his relicks  A grand a splendid monument shall rise  Deck'd with the spoils of many a wellfought field  With Roman Eagles and Imperial banners  The trophies of his wars The hallow'd mould  The sons of Germany with pilgrim feet  Shall oft revisit with their tears embalm  His claycold ashes and then sighing say  At length Arminius rests from toil and danger  With all his country's blessings on his head  FINIS  NOTES ON THE TRAGEDY OF ARMINIUS  ACT I
