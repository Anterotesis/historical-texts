 THE ATHENAID A POEM  VOL II  THE ATHENAID A POEM  BY THE AUTHOR OF LEONIDAS  VOL II  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXVII  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the ELEVENTH  TH' unloosen'd anchors to the waves resign  The Delphian keels while Auster's friendly breath  Their burden light'ning soon to Sunium shews  The spreading sails Two vessels riding there  Receive embarking warriors On the beach  Looks Medon stedfast By almighty Jove  He cries aloud Themistocles I see  O Haliartus O my holy friend  We must not leave unvisited a shore  Which holds that living trophy to our view  The victorchief at Salamis The skiff  Is launch'd they land Themistocles begins  The salutation Hail Oileus' son  Thou rev'rend host of Athens Timon hail  Your unexpected presence here excites  A pleasing wonder Whither do ye steer  These well remember'd vessels which convey'd  Thee first of Locrians with our Attic bard  To Salamis from Delphi In that course  Was Timon captive made whom freed at last  My joyful arms embrace The Locrian here  To Atalanté in Euboean streights  We steer another of Oilean race  Through bounteous Heav'n a refuge there obtains  My brother good Leonteus with a band  Of gallant Locrians ready at my call  To lift their bucklers in defence of Greece  But why remote from Athens on the strand  Of naked Sunium do I see the son  Of Neocles so recently by me  At Sparta left Themistocles replies  Forbear enquiry now O virtuous branch  Of that ennobled stock th' Oilean house  If e'er my conduct merited thy praise  If thou believ'st me studious of the fame  Which follows manly deeds forbear to doubt  Th' unwearied further efforts of my limbs  My heart my talents Secrecy matures  Time brings the labour of the mind to birth  Were those first steps reveal'd which restless thought  Constructing some vast enterprize ascends  How wild a wand'rer Medon would appear  The policy of man But gen'rous chief  Whose valour whose experience might assure  A prosp'rous issue to a bold exploit  Say should I open on some future day  To thy discerning sight the clearest track  Where to success one glorious stride might reach  Wouldst thou be ready at my call He paus'd  From such a mouth such captivating words  Insinuate sweetness through the Locrian's ear  Who feels th' allurement yet by prudence rul'd  This answer frames Through such a glorious track  Whoever guides may challenge Medon's aid  Thou prove that guide my steps shall follow close  Unless by Aristides call'd whose voice  Commands my service Cool th' Athenian hides  The smart his wounded vanity endures  And manly thus unchang'd in look rejoins  I ask no more I rest my future claim  On Medon's valour only to support  What Aristides shall approve farewell  Avail thee straight of these propitious winds  In Atalanté known to me of old  What force thou can'st assemble dread no wants  I will be watchful to supply them all  They part Now Medon under hoisted sails  Remarks unwonted transport on the cheek  Of Haliartus O my peasant weeds  His joy exclaims how gratefully you rise  In my remembrance now From you my hopes  Forebode some benefit to Greece Dear lord  Forbear enquiry by yon hero warn'd  In secrecy my thoughts till form'd complete  Lie deeply bury'd Timon smil'd and spake  I know full often enterprises bold  Lie in the womb of mystery conceal'd  Thus far th' Athenian hero and thyself  Raise expectation but I further know  His faculties are matchless thou art brave  Unerring Medon like my god is wise  Thence expectation soars on steady wings  O light of Greece Themistocles exert  Thy boundless pow'rs mature thy pregnant plan  Whene'er the glorious mystery unveils  Me and my Delphians thou shalt find prepar'd  The turbulent Euripus swift they plough  In pleasing converse thus and clasp in hope  Their anxious friends on Atalanté's shore  When ev'ry mast was hid by Sunium's cape  Thus to his faithful minister the son  Of Neocles Sicinus hast thou seen  My followers on board The treasures brought  From Xerxes those my spoils of war supply  The arms the stores Sicinus has thy care  Deposited in safety Yes replies  Th' entrusted servant Now thyself embark  His lord enjoins who musing thus remains  If my attempt to further I have won  This gallant Locrian frankly I confess  My debt to fortune but this casual boon  I can forego if wantonly her hand  Resumes Themistocles alone can trace  A path to glory Tow'rds the land he turns  Proceeding thus Now Attica farewell  A while farewell To thee Barbarian gold  Themistocles resorts my bosom guest  Whom Aristides in disdain would spurn  By thee O gift of Xerxes I will raise  The weal of Athens and a fresh increase  To my own laurels Uncontroll'd supreme  Is Aristides He the Attic youth  In phalanx bright to victory may lead  Minerva's bird Xanthippus may display  To Asia trembling at their naval flag  A private man Themistocles will reach  Your summits fellow citizens preferr'd  To his command Ye chosen heroes wait  For breezy spring to wanton in your sails  Then range your vig'rous files and pamper'd steeds  Themistocles amid septentrion snows  Shall rouse despair and anguish from their den  Of lamentation poverty shall blaze  In radiant steel pale misery shall grasp  A standard Athens thy rejected son  Extorted aid from tyranny shall draw  On his own greatness to establish thine  Swift he embarks like Neptune when he mounts  His rapid conch to call the tempests forth  Upturn the floods and rule them when they rage  The third clear morning shews Eretria's port  Among Euboean cities once superb  Eretria now in ashes She had join'd  Th' Athenians bold invaders who consum'd  The capital of Lydia to revenge  Ionian Greeks enthrall'd Eretria paid  Severe atonement to Hystaspes' son  Incens'd Darius To a Cissian plain  A central space of his unbounded realm  Far from their ancient seat which flames devour'd  He her exterminated race confin'd  Sad captives never to revisit more  Their native isle A silent wharf admits  Themistocles on shore a void extent  Where sons of Neptune heretofore had swarm'd  No mooring vessel in the haven rode  No footstep mark'd the ways sole inmates there  Calamity and horror as enthron'd  Sat on o'erwhelming ruins and forbade  The hero passage till a seeming track  Presents half bury'd in surrounding heaps  Of desolation what appears a dome  Rais'd to some god Themistocles observes  A shatter'd porch whose proud supporters lie  In fragments save one column which upholds  Part of a sculptur'd pediment where black  By conflagation an inscription maim'd  Retains these words "To eleutherian Jove"  Th' Athenian enters follow'd by his train  In arms complete Excluded was the day  By ruins pil'd externally around  Unless what broken thinlyscatter'd rays  Shot through th' encumber'd portal Soon they stand  Amidst obscuring dusk in silence all  All motionless in wonder while a voice  Distinct in tone delivers through the void  These solemn accents Eleutherian god  Since no redeemer to Eretria fall'n  Thy will vouchsafes why longer dost thou keep  Thy aged servant on a stage of woe  Why not release him why not close his eyes  So vainly melting o'er his country lost  Ten years are fled the morning I have hail'd  In sighs alone have laid my head on thorns  Of anguish nightly visited in dreams  By images of horror which employ  Each waking moment To have seen destroy'd  From their foundations my paternal streets  The holy structures burn a people forc'd  In climates new and barbarous to dwell  Was sure enough to sufferIt is time  To give my patience rest The plaintive sound  Draws on th' Athenian who perceives a gleam  Palequiv'ring o'er a solitary lamp  Perceives a rev'rend sire resembling Time  Down to whose girdle hangs the snowy fleece  Of wintry age Unaw'd his lamp he rais'd  A dim reflection from the polish'd arms  Reveal'd the warrior whom he thus bespake  Whate'er thou art if hostile or a friend  A god a mortal or a phantom vain  Know that my state no change can render worse  All change make better Father soft replied  Th' advancing chief take comfort I am come  Thy country's saviour follow in the day  See who I am Between the op'ning band  He leads the senior through the dusky porch  Whom he accosts before th' unclouded sun  Then vertical Rest father and behold  Themistocles of Athens While the priest  So by his fillet sacerdotal known  In wonder paus'd th' artificer divine  Of wiles to catch the sudden turns of chance  Frames in a momentary cast of thought  This bright device of fiction to allure  A holy mind O worthy of the god  Thou servant pure of Jupiter I mourn  Like thee Eretria not like thee despond  Attend thou righteous votary to heav'n  I from the day of Salamis o'ertoil'd  While courting slumber in a vision saw  The sapient issue of th' almighty sire  His best belov'd Minerva Still the sound  Of her gorgonian shield my ears retain  While earnest striking on its rim her spear  The virgin warrior spake Triumphant son  Of Neocles remember in thy joy  The miseries of others Go redeem  Eretria fall'n whose noble remnant arm'd  Sev'n ships exhausting all their slender stores  To fight for Athens on this glorious day  As from the sooty gate of direful Dis  Deliver'd Theseus when to cheering day  He reascended on Alcides look'd  Who for his lov'd companion pierc'd the gloom  Of Erebus th' Eretrian's grateful eyes  Thus on the son of Neocles were fix'd  In ecstacy of joy These fervent words  He utter'd Heav'n hath giv'n thee to destroy  Presumptuous foes O favour'd by the gods  Who give thee now to save despairing friends  That allrejoicing in thy trophies new  Great as thou art thy gen'rous soul may prove  How far beyond the transports conquest yields  Are those resulting from benignant deeds  More grateful chief is charity's sweet voice  Than Fame's shrill trumpet in the ear of Jove  Who will on such humanity as thine  Accumulate his blessings If my name  Thou ne'er hast heard or hearing hast forgot  Know that from lib'ral Cleobulus sprung  I am Tisander Interrupting swift  Th' Athenian here Thy own thy father's name  To me illustrious pontiff well are known  My recent banner in the summer's gale  Thou must remember on th' Eretrian coast  Eretrian warriors under Cleon's charge  In ships by me supply'd undaunted fought  At Artemisium and an earnest gave  Of their late prowess From their chief from all  Thy celebrating countrymen I heard  Of thee Tisander and thy name retain  Proceed To him the priest Flow first my tears  Of that brave band whatever now remains  Have nought but prowess left Alas how few  Escap'd thy fell exterminating hand  When treachery surrender'd to thy pow'r  Darius Sons of husbandry lay hid  In woods and caverns of the nobler class  Some on the main were absent Priest of Jove  I was releas'd a pious beardless prince  Nam'd Hyperanthes on my rank and years  Look'd with compassion living I extol  My dying breath shall bless him I have dwelt  Within my temple mourning o'er this waste  Here annually collected Lo the day  Of that severe solemnity is nigh  Th' unhappy reliques of Eretrian blood  Accompany my tears Thou knowst they sail'd  At thy appointment on Athenian decks  They and the men of Styra from that port  For Salamis In glory they return'd  To want and horror desert found their land  Their crops their future sustenance destroy'd  Their huts consum'd their cattle swept away  Their progeny their wives flagitious act  Of Demonax in Oreus late replac'd  Her tyrant foul a slave to Xerxes' throne  His scourge in rich Euboea halfreduc'd  To this dire monster's sway by royal aid  Of endless treasure and Barbarian bands  Such is our state Too scanty are the means  Of willing Styra to relieve such wants  Our wealthier neighbours of Carystus vend  Not give in hoarded grain in flocks and herds  Abounding them a sordid chief controlls  Nicomachus An oligarchy rules  Geraestus small but opulentO Jove  I see brave Cleon yonder from his head  He rends the hairwhat gestures of distress  He beats his troubled bosom wrings his hands  Not heeding great Themistocles he points  On me alone a wild distracted look  Say Cleon Swift with shiv'ring lips and pale  Th' Eretrian leader interrupting vents  His tortur'd thoughts Tisander can thy pray'rs  Repel grim famine rushing on the blast  Of barren winter Three disastrous days  Will lay the combatants for Greece in dust  Behind them leaving nothing but a name  For Salamis to publish Lo they come  A dying people suppliant to repose  Within thy fane their fleshdivested bones  Yet such a tomb their fainting voices cry  May those Eretrians envy who are doom'd  To lodge their captive limbs in Asia's mold  He ends in sighs Behold a ghastly troop  Slow through the ruins of their native streets  In languid pace advance So gath'ring shoals  Of ghosts from hour to hour through endless time  The unrelenting eye of Charon views  By sickness plague and famine by the sword  Or heartcorroding sorrow sent from light  To pass the black irremeable floods  Of Styx Cecropia's hero cast a look  Like Phoebus heav'nlygentle when aton'd  Th' infectious air he clear'd awak'ning gales  To breathe salubrious o'er th' enfeebled host  Of Agamemnon as from death they rose  Yet to assert their glory Swift the chief  Bespake Sicinus Haste unlaid the ships  Three talents bring they Cleon shall be thine  Seek those in every part who vend not give  The gifts of Ceres in profusion bear  The gifts of Pan the grape's reviving juice  To these my fellow warriors who have seen  My banner streaming twice have lent their aid  To my renown meantime our naval food  Shall be their portion vesture now shall cheer  Their limbs My brave companions I have brought  The spear and buckler for your manly hands  Your strength restor'd shall feel the glorious weight  Of crested helms Tisander let them rest  Within thy shelt'ring temple not to sink  Beneath distress but vig'rous soon renew  Their practis'd race of honour Pass my friends  Be mute expression of your joy I wave  Again tomorrow you and I will meet  Tisander happy entertains his guests  Twelve hundred countrymen the last remains  Of populous Eretria Plenty's boon  Alert the Attic mariners diffuse  To all and cordial tend their wants discreet  Sicinus curbs excess The tidings brought  Of his performance from a short repast  Dismiss'd his lord applauding who serene  Stretch'd on his naval pillow slept till dawn  He rose To him Sicinus Will my lord  Permit his servant with an active band  Of sailors these obstructions to remove  Or so dispose that feeblest steps may find  A passage free to good Tisander's fane  That through its wonted apertures the round  Of that huge pile where Jupiter should dwell  Now dark as Pluto's palace may admit  The light of heav'n Yet further we must search  For coverts dry if such the greedy flames  Have left among these ruins to secure  The various stores which Cleon may transport  To him his lord Go monitor expert  Accomplish what thou counsel'st Tow'rds the fane  Himself not slow proceeds Before the front  On scatter'd fragments of their ancient homes  Th' Eretrians pale with longcontinu'd want  Are seated Thick as winterfamish'd birds  Perch on the boughs which icicles encrust  Yet chirp and flutter in th' attemp'ring sun  These at the hero's presence wave their hands  Unite their efforts in acclaim not loud  But cordial rather in a gen'ral sigh  Of gratitude The charitable care  Of his best warriors some of noblest birth  Impart their help like parents to a race  Of tender infants Onc f might approv'd  In battle hardiest of the naval breed  Th' Eretrians worn by hunger scarce retain  The slender pow'rs of childhood One by one  Themistocles consoles them and devotes  In condescension sedulous the day  To kindness not impolitic In these  His piercing genius fit materials saw  To build another structure of renown  Ere he retires Tisander thus he greets  Wilt thou O father on my board bestow  An evening hour My moments all belong  To this yet helpless people said the priest  Such pious care through me shall heav'n reward  Exclaims the chief as round him he remarks  The toiling sailors soon thou guardian good  Of wretched men committed to thy charge  Soon shall thy temple reassume its state  Prepare an altar Hecatombs again  Shall smoke ere long Eretria cast aside  Her widow'd garb and lift her festive palms  To eleutherian Jove This utter'd swift  He seeks his vessel while the sun descends  Calm as in summer through an ether clear  Aurora leads the day A cheerful sound  Of Oxen lowing from the hollow dales  Which tow'rds Carystus wind of bleeting sheep  Yet nearer driven across the Eretrian plain  Awake Themistocles His couch he leaves  Revisiting the temple there enjoys  The gen'ral transport Plenty on the wing  Is nigh the comforts of her fruitful horn  To pour on desolation Cleon comes  Accosting thus Themistocles My task  Is well accomplish'd through the lib'ral zeal  Of Hyacinthus near a youth unlike  His sire Nicomachus That subtile chief  Of our Carystian neighbours is behind  Escorting laden carriages of grain  Thy purchase nought his sordid hand bestows  He curious more than friendly in our need  Or of thy name respectful to explore  Not help or pity hither bends his course  Conduct the father to my ship reply'd  Themistocles sure yonder is the son  Thou hast describ'd ingenuous are his looks  Like him whose name he bears his beauteous form  Might charm the beaming god once more to court  A mortal's friendship but dejection pale  O'ercasts his hue strange melancholy dims  His youthful eye too modest or unmann'd  By languor child of grief he stops and bows  In distant seeming awe which wounds my soul  I must salute him Noble youth receive  My hand Themistocles of Greece expects  No such obeisance from a fellow Greek  The majesty of Athens might exact  That conquer'd tyrants in my presence brought  Low as the dust should crouch beneath her chief  A start of anguish Hyacinthus gave  At these last words then silent bow'd again  His decent brow not awe but latent ills  Seem'd to control his tongue Th' observant chief  Defers enquiry to its season due  To Cleon's charge consigns him and retires  To his own galley Waiting for the sire  He meditates a moment on the son  I see advantage in this youth's distress  My plan is form'd He hastens to unbar  His copious treasure thence in dazzling show  He spreads four silver talents on his board  O'er them a mantle throws and brief again  Thus ruminates Now Plutus who canst sap  The strongbas'd tow'r and soften rigid hearts  Smile on this juncture Aristides scorns  Thy deity Themistocles invokes  Thy precious succour From profoundest woe  Disconsolate Eretria thou hast rais'd  Now by a sordid instrument give life  To dull Carystus Sudden in his view  By Cleon brought who instantly withdraws  Nicomachus appears and thus begins  The Salaminian victor I salute  Charg'd by Carystus happy is my lot  To venerate the chief and touch the hand  Which humbled Asia Doth Euboea see  Thee visitant illustrious to rebuild  Eretria then instruct her to confine  That pow'r and pride her neighbours felt of old  Th' Athenian here Euboea sees me come  Both to upraise Carystian and depress  But to exalt thy state my friend I wish  Wish thy possessions equal to thy worth  Behold Uplifting to the greedy eye  Of avarice the mantle he pursues  Behold four silver talents Them accept  Which in this casket to thy trusted slaves  I will deliver now I only ask  Of thy deepfounded influence to warm  Supine Carystus For thyself and Greece  Unite with mine thy standard Further note  If at my summons thou produce in arms  Thy citizens auxiliar from this hand  Expect four added talents but the hopes  Of no unpractis'd leader who perceives  His enterprize assur'd dare promise more  A share Nicomachus of spoil in war  To pass thy own belief By present gain  By more in promise not by glory fir'd  Nicomachus rejoins A thousand spears  Shall wait thy earliest notice While he spake  He snatch'd the casket shut the treasure close  Then rush'd to seek his confidential slave  Who takes the precious charge With placid looks  The cool the politic Athenian sat  Like some experienc'd pilot who serene  In skilful guidance of the steady helm  Enjoys the favour smooth of gale and tide  Combin'd to waft o'er ocean's fickle breast  His gliding keel and lodge her costly freight  Secure at length in harbour Now he spake  To his reent'ring guest Carystian friend  Thou hast a son welldisciplin'd to war  Brave lib'ral wise I doubt not wilt thou trust  To my society a while his youth  He is the object of my vows to heav'n  Nicomachus exclaims in passion feign'd  My soul's delight the rapture of my eye  If he were absent ev'ry hour my age  Would feel a growing burden Come rejoins  Th' Athenian him I only would detain  My messenger of order to thy walls  On him another talent would bestow  The gymnic school and letters cries the sire  He follows heeds not treasure by his hand  Send me the talent never let him know  The charge he bears This said he loudly calls  To Hyacinthus who had gain'd the deck  Him ent'ring thus addresses Son the chief  Of Athens great Themistocles demands  Thee for companion As a casual gleam  Breaks through th' unrav'lling texture of black clouds  Which long on winter's sullen face have hung  So darts a ray of gladness through the gloom  Of Hyacinthus by the Attic chief  Not unobserv'd Intent on swift return  Th' exulting father bids to both farewel  Remaining day Themistocles employs  Among his sailors in th' Eretrian streets  Inspects the necessary toil pursu'd  With unremitted vigour then retires  To due refection Cleon is a guest  With Hyacinthus still by grief devour'd  Which all his efforts strive in vain to hide  Her heavy wing no sooner night outspreads  Than to Sicinus they are giv'n in charge  While to his couch Themistocles repairs  End of the Eleventh Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the TWELFTH  NOW in the zodiac had the sun o'erpass'd  The tenth fair sign The new succeeding month  Though not by Flora nor Vertumnus deck'd  Nor green in hue though first of winter's train  Oft with unsully'd skies irradiate cheers  The prone creation and delights mankind  The birds yet warble on the leafless sprays  The placid surface glaz'd by clearest light  In crystal rivers and transparent lakes  Or ocean's smooth cerulean bosom shews  The finny tribes in play The active son  Of Neocles uprises and descries  A dawn which promis'd purity of air  Of light and calmness tempting sloth herself  To action Thus he rous'd his native fire  Of this kind season not a moment lose  Themistocles Sicinus ever nigh  He call'd Provide two receptacles sure  Each to contain twelve talents bring my arms  Produce a second suit resembling mine  Send Hyacinthus let my chosen band  Of Attic friends and Sparta's fifty youths  My followers be ready for a march  Soon Hyacinthus enters still he shews  The perturbation of a mind oppress'd  By some conceal'd misfortune while beneath  The shade of sorrow on his front appear'd  Excelling graces Him the chief bespake  Gay in his look and sprightly in his tone  Her eastern hill behold the morning mounts  In radiance scatter'd from the liquid gems  On her loose mantle but the heart of youth  In ev'ry season should rejoice in clouds  Not less than sunshine whether nature's voice  Be hoarse in storms or tune to whisp'ring gales  Her vernal music Sharp some inward grief  When youth is sad yet fortune oft deceives  The inexperienc'd by imagin'd ills  Or light which counsel of the more mature  Can lightly heal Unlock thy lib'ral mind  To me a guardian pregnant of relief  Beyond thy father countrymen or friends  Impart thy cares The sighing guest replied  To thy controul my service I devote  O scourge of tyrants but retain my grief  Which thou O first of mortals or the king  Of high Olympus never can redress  Sicinus interrupts his lord's commands  Are all accomplish'd Now Carystian friend  Resembling me in stature size and limbs  The son of Neocles proceeds accept  That suit of armour I have tried it well  Receive a shield familiar to my arm  He next instructs Sicinus Thou receive  Twelve talents hasten to the neighb'ring walls  Of stately Chalcis populous and rich  Queen of Euboean cities in whose port  The twenty ships of Athens yet remain  Which Chalcis borrow'd and equipp'd for war  Of her bold race four thousand we beheld  Distinguish'd late in Artemisium's fight  At Salamis yet later First approach  The newmade archon in a rev'rent style  Timoxenus most potent in that state  A dubious timid magistrate unlike  Nearchus Cordial salutation bear  To him my brave associate do not turn  Thy back on Chalcis till thy prudence brings  Intelligence of weight th' Athenian keels  With grain abundant and materials lade  That friendly roofs th' Eretrians may obtain  Before grim winter harrow up these streights  Unnavigable soon This said he arms  Begirt by warriors to the temple speeds  And greets the priest In gladsome thought I see  The goddess Health whitehanded crimsoncheek'd  As from a silver car in roseate  uds  Look on thy people dropping on their lips  Restoring dew she bids them taste and live  The convalescent piously employ  In labours where my naval band shall join  To free th' encumber'd temple to repair  To cover dwellings lest the winter bring  New hardships Martial exercise I leave  To Cleon's care while ten revolving suns  Of absence I must count Now father take  This hand a hand which fortune and thy god  Have ever favour'd which shall soon convert  The annual day of mourning in thy fane  To festival solemnity of joy  Bless'd by Tisander rapid he departs  Young Hyacinthus follows who in arms  Once by his patron worn to ev'ry eye  Presents a new Themistocles but such  As when th' allurement of his early bloom  He not unconscious of the charm display'd  To Attic damsels Cloudless on their march  Apollo shoots a clear and tepid ray  A scatter'd village in Carystian bounds  To rural hospitality admits  The wearied warriors Hyacinthus guides  His great protector to a shelt'ring fane  Of Juno styl'd connubial stately round  Old beech extend a venerable shade  Through ages time had witness'd to their growth  Whose ruddy texture disarray'd of green  Glows in the purple of declining day  They pass the marble threshold when the youth  With visage pale in accents broken spake  Unequall'd man behold the only place  For thy reception fit for mine He paus'd  A gushing torrent of impetuous grief  O'erwhelm'd his cheeks now starting on he rush'd  Before the sacred image wrung his hands  Then sinking down along the pavement roll'd  His body in distraction would have dash'd  His forehead there Themistocles prevents  Uplifts and binds him in a strong embrace  When thus in eager agony the youth  Is not thy purpose godlike man to crush  The tyrant Demonax in torture cut  The murd'rer short that he may feel the pangs  Of death unnatural Young man replies  Th' Athenian grave to know my hidden thoughts  Dost thou aspire retaining still thy own  Still in my presence thy distemper drinks  The cup of misery conceal'd and seems  Rejecting friendship's salutary hand  To court the draught which poisons Canst thou hope  Mysterious youth my confidence yet none  Wilt in Themistocles repose His look  His tone in feign'd austerity he wrapp'd  So Aesculapius bitter juice apply'd  From helpful plants his wisdom had explor'd  The vehicles of health In humble tears  Which melted more than flow'd the mourner thus  Forgive me too regardless of thy grace  Of all forgetful save itself my grief  Deserves thy frown yet less than giddy joy  Which grown familiar wantons in the smile  Of condescension Ah that grief will change  Reproof to more than pity will excite  A thirst for vengeance when thy justice hears  A taleUnfold it interpos'd the chief  To one who knows the various ways of men  Hath study'd long their passions and their woes  Nor less the med'cines for a wounded mind  Then Hyacinthus Mighty chief recal  Thy first successes when Euboea's maids  Saw from her shores Barbarian pendants low'r'd  To thine and grateful pluck'd the flow'rs of May  To dress in chaplets thy victorious deck  Then at thy gen'rous instigation fir'd  The men of Oreus from their walls expell'd  Curst Demonax their tyrant On a day  Ah source of short delight of lasting pain  I from the labour of a tedious chace  O'erspent by thirst and heat a forest gain'd  A rill meandring to a green recess  I track'd my wonder saw a damsel there  In sumptuous vesture couch'd on fragrant tufts  Of camomile amid surrounding flow'rs  Reposing Tall erect a figure stern  Was nigh all sable on his head and brow  Above his lip and shadowing his cheeks  The hair was brisled fierce but frank his eye  A grim fidelity reveal'd his belt  Sustain'd a sabre from a quiver full  On sight of me an arrow keen he drew  A wellstrung bow presented my approach  Forbidding loudly She upstarting wak'd  My aspect surely gentle when I first  Beheld Cleora more of hope than fear  Inspir'd she crav'd protectionWhat ye fates  Was my protectionO superior man  Can thy sublimity of soul endure  My tedious anguish Interposing mild  Th' Athenian here Take time give sorrow vent  My Hyacinthus I forbid not tears  He now pursues her suppliant hands she rais'd  To me astonish'd hearing from her lips  That Demonax was author of her days  Amid the tumult his expulsion caus'd  She from a rural palace where he stor'd  Well known to her a treasure with a slave  In faith approv'd with gold and gems of price  Escap'd All night on fleetest steeds they rode  Nor knew what hospitable roof to seek  My father's sister Glaucé close behind  This fane of Juno dwelt her priestess pure  My kindest parent To her roof I brought  O Glaucé whatO dearest most rever'd  To thee I brougnt Cleora Horror pale  Now blanch'd his visage shook his loos'ning joints  Congeal'd his tongue and rais'd his rigid hair  Th' Athenian calm and silent waits to hear  The reassum'd narration O ye flow'rs  How were ye fragrant forth in transport wild  Bursts Hyacinthus O embow'ring woods  How soft your shade's refreshment Founts and rills  How sweet your cadence while I won the hand  Of my Cleora to the nuptial tie  By spotless vows before thy image bound  O Goddess hymeneal O what hours  Of happiness untainted dear espous'd  Did we possess kind Glaucé smil'd on both  The earliest birds of morning to her voice  Of benediction sung the gracious found  Our evening heard content our pillow smooth'd  Ev'n Oxus so Cleora's slave was nam'd  Of Sacian birth with grim delight and zeal  Anticipates our will My nuptials known  Brings down my father whose resentment warm  Th' affinity with Demonax reproves  A helpless vagabond a hopeless wretch  For now thy sword at Salamis prevail'd  This storm Cleora calm'd the gen'rous fair  Before my father laid her dazzling gems  She gave he took them all return'd content  Left us too happy in exhaustless stores  Of love for envious fate to leave unspoil'd  Meantime no rumour pierc'd our tranquil bow'r  That Demonax in Oreus was replac'd  That he two golden talents to the hand  Which should restore Cleora had proclaim'd  To me was all unknown Two moons complete  Have spent their periods since one evening late  Nicomachus my presence swift requir'd  A dying mother to embrace By morn  I gain'd Carystus by the close of day  A tender parent on my breast expir'd  An agitation unexpected shook  My father's bosom as I took farewell  On my returnI can no moreYes yes  Dwell on each hideous circumstance my tongue  With horror tear my heartstrings till they burst  Poor Hyacinthus hath no cure but death  The sun was broad at noon my recent loss  Lamenting yet asswaging by the joy  To see Cleora soon ne'er left before  A tedious interval to me I reach'd  My home th' abode of Glaucé Clos'd the door  Forbids my passage to repeated calls  No voice replies two villagers pass by  Who at my clamours help to force my way  I pass one chamber strangled on the floor  Two damselministers of Juno lie  I hurry on a second where my wife  Was in my absence to partake the couch  Of Glaucé shews that righteous woman dead  The dear impression where Cleora's limbs  Sleep had embrac'd I saw the only trace  Of her the last these eyes shall e'er behold  Her name my accents strong in frenzy sound  Cleora makes no answer Next I fly  From place to place on Sacian Oxus call  He is not there A lethargy benumbs  My languid members In a neighb'ring hut  Lodg'd by the careful peasants I awake  Insensible to knowledge of my state  The direful tidings from Carystus rouse  My friends Nicanor to my father's home  Transports me Ling'ring torpid I consum'd  Sev'n moons successive when too vig'rous youth  Recall'd my strength and memory to curse  Health sense and thought My rashness would have sought  Cleora ev'n in Oreus there have fac'd  The homicide her sire forbid withheld  Nicanor I deputed When I march'd  To bid thee welcome on the way I met  That friend return'dPersist my falt'ring tongue  Rehearse his tidings pitying Heav'n may close  Thy narrative in deathThe Sacian slave  Produc'd Cleora to her savage sire  So fame reports all Oreus so believes  But this is trivial to the tragic scene  Which all beheld Her hand the tyrant doom'd  To Mindarus a Persian lord the chief  Of his auxiliar guard but she refus'd  And own'd our union which her pregnant fruit  Of love too well confirm'd The monster blind  With mad'ning fury instantly decreed  That deadliest poison through those beauteous lips  Should choak the springs of life My weeping friend  Saw her pale reliques on the fun'ral pyre  I am not madev'n that relief the gods  Deny me All my story I have told  Been accurate on horror to provoke  The stroke of death yet live Thou must exclaims  The chief humanely artful thou must live  Without thy help I never can avenge  On Demonax thy wrongs Ha cries the youth  Art thou resolv'd to lift thy potent arm  Against the murd'rer Yes th' Athenian said  I will do more thy virtue will uphold  Whose perseverance through such floods of woe  Could wade to bid me welcome Gen'rous youth  Trust to the man whom myriads ne'er withstood  Who towns from ruin can to greatness raise  Can humble fortune force her fickle hand  To render up the victim she hath mark'd  For shame and sorrow force her to entwine  With her own finger a triumphant wreath  To deck his brow Themistocles who drives  Despair and desolation from the streets  Of fall'n Eretria and from eastern bonds  Afflicted Greece at Salamis preserv'd  He will thy genius to his native pow'rs  Restore will make thee master of revenge  For thy own wrongs to glorious action guide  Thy manly steps redressing as they tread  The wrongs of others Not the gracious voice  Of Juno speaking comfort from her shrine  Not from his tripod Jove's prophetic seed  Imparting counsel through his Pythian maid  Not Jove himself from Dodonaean groves  By oracles of promise could have sooth'd  This young but most distinguish'd of mankind  Among the wretched as the wellwrought strain  Of thy heartsearching policy expert  Themistocles like some wellpractis'd son  Of learn'd Machaon o'er a patient's wound  Compassionate but cool who ne'er permits  His own sensation to control his art  But said th' Athenian soldiers must refresh  As well as fast nor keep incessant watch  They quit the temple In the dwelling nigh  Deepmusing Hyacinthus lightly tastes  The light repast On matted tufts they stretch  Their weary'd limbs Themistocles had arm'd  With elevated thoughts his pupil's mind  Which foils at intervals despair His eyes  The transient palm of sleep would often seal  But oft in dreams his dear espous'd he sees  A livid spectre an empoison'd cup  She holds and weepsthen vanishes Revenge  In bloody sandals and a dusky pall  Succeeds Her stature growing as he gaz'd  Reveals a glory beaming round her head  A sword she brandishes the awful sword  Which Nemesis unsheathes on crimes He sees  Connubial Juno's image from the base  Descend and pointing with its marble hand  Before him glide A sudden shout of war  The yell of death Carystian banners wav'd  An apparition of himself in arms  Stir ev'ry sense The dreadful tumult ends  The headless trunk of Demonax in gore  He views in transport Instantly his couch  Shoots forth in laurels vaulting o'er his head  The walls are hung with trophies Juno comes  No longer marble but the queen of heav'n  Clad in resplendency divine She leads  Cleora now to perfect bloom restor'd  Who beck'ning opens to th' enraptur'd eye  Of Hyacinthus doating on the charm  Her breast of snow whence pure ambrosial milk  Allures an infant from an amber cloud  Who stoops and round her neck maternal clings  He to embrace them striving wak'd and lost  Th' endearing picture of illusive air  But wak'd compos'd His mantle he assum'd  To Juno's statue trod and thus unlock'd  His pious breast O goddess though thy smile  Which I acknowledge for the hours of bliss  I once possess'd a brief exhausted term  Could not protect me from malignant fate  Lo prostrate fall'n before thee I complain  No more My soul shall struggle with despair  Nor shall the furies drag me to the grave  Thou punishment dost threaten to the crime  Which hath defac'd my happiness on earth  Themistocles my patron is thy boon  Who will fulfil thy menace I believe  There is a place hereafter to admit  Such purity as hers whose blissful hand  Thou didst bestowI lostI know my days  With all their evils of duration short  I am not conscious of a black misdeed  Which should exclude me from the seat of rest  And therefore wait in pious hope that soon  Shall Hyacinthus find his wife and child  With them to dwell forever He concludes  Regains the chamber and Aurora shines  End of the Twelfth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the THIRTEENTH  WHEN Hyacinthus first his couch forsook  Themistocles in care had follow'd close  But secretly had noted well the pray'r  To Juno sent and part approving part  Condemning heard Accoutr'd now in mail  The young Carystian to his list'ning friend  Relates the wonders of his recent dream  Th' Athenian while most cordial in the care  Of Hyacinthus whom his woes endear'd  Still weigh'd his use This answer he devis'd  To ease the grief he pitied and preserve  The worth essential to his own designs  What thou hast told Carystian fires my breast  It was a signal by Saturnia held  To animate thy rage and prompt thy arm  To action She requires not goddess wise  Humiliation scorns the sluggish mind  Whose thoughts are creeping to Elysian rest  They hush no throbs of anguish while it rends  The mangled heartstrings no not more than staunch  A bleeding wound or quench a fever's flame  We earn Elysium and our evils here  Surmount alike by action Manly toil  Repels despair Endurance of a storm  Which rocks the vessel marches long and swift  A river pass'd while enemies in front  By whirls of javelins chase the rapid ford  A rampart scal'd the forcing of a camp  Are cures of sorrow In her vision clear  So did heav'n's empress intimate this morn  Me too she visited in sleep her voice  My waking thoughts confirm'd Cleora lives  Else why the goddess thus Arise O son  Of Neocles of this afflicted youth  Be thou sure guide to rescue his espous'd  The profanation of my rites chastise  The fiction wraps in credulous delight  The young Carystian's confidence who feels  Circaean magic from his patron's eye  His tongue and gesture He quicksighted turns  To swift advantage his delusion thus  Come let me try thy vigour I am bound  To neighb'ring Styra fly before thy friend  Among that gen'rous people who their all  Two gallies sent to Salamis proclaim  Themistocles approaches Like a dart  Lanc'd from the sinews of a Parthian's arm  Without reply th' inspir'd Carystian flew  Cas'd as he was in steel Meantime the chief  Salutes his Attic and Laconian bands  His captivating presence both enjoy  Which else no eye most piercing might discern  Not ev'n the hundred neversleeping lights  Which on the margin of her parent flood  Incessant watch'd the progeny transform'd  Of Inachus the Argive watry god  Where undistinguish'd in the grazing herd  His daughter wept nor he that daughter knew  A speechless suppliant Recommenc'd the march  Exhausts the day Beneath a holy roof  Which rose to Ceres they their shelter'd limbs  To rest and food resign There gently swell'd  Th' encircling ground whence fair the morning smil'd  On little Styra who no queen superb  Of wide dominion like a rural nymph  In decency of garb and native locks  Her humble circuit not unlovely shews  She from Athenian boundaries of old  Her first inhabitants deriv'd and pours  Her sons now forth Themistocles to greet  Their eldest parent's hero Lampon bold  Accosts him Me the weak but willing hand  Of Styra late enabled to enrol  My name with thine unconquerable son  Of Neocles Though feeble is her sword  Her sinews boast of Attic vigour still  Oh that her means were equal to her love  A lib'ral welcome thou and these should find  But yon Geraestian oligarchy foe  To equity and freedom from our meads  Have newly swept our plenty Ardent here  Themistocles By heav'n my Styrian host  Not thrice shall day illuminate your skies  Ere double measure shall these petty lords  Repay to Styra I am come to crush  Their usurpation in Geraestus fix  Her ancient laws and rouse her martial race  Against the Persian and the Persian's friends  Array thy force Tomorrow's early sun  Shall see us march and ere his second noon  The bird of Athens shall her talons lift  Against the walls of these presumptuous thieves  They have no walls Eudemus takes the word  A righteous brave Geraestian exil'd late  By hospitable Styra late receiv'd  A forest thick surrounds them which affords  One scanty passage but the ax and bill  Apply'd with vigour soon will open ways  Sev'n hundred natives can Geraestus arm  Who will not fight to rivet on their necks  A galling yoke more fast The whole defence  Our oligarchal tyrants have to boast  Are poor Barbarians scarce three hundred strong  Sav'd from the wrecks of those advent'rous ships  Which round Euboea's rude Capharean cape  Had been detach'd thy navy to surround  In Artemisium's conflict Now apart  Themistocles to Hyacinthus spake  While in his care he lodg'd a casket seal'd  Which held the talent promis'd to his sire  This for thy father tell him I require  The stipulated bands' immediate march  I wish to see them under thy command  Thou know'st Diana's celebrated fane  At Amarynthus if thou canst young friend  Be there before me Pleas'd the youth departs  As in excursion from their waxen homes  A hive's industrious populace obey  The tinkling sound which summons all to swarm  So when the trumpet's wellknown voice proclaims  To arms the Styrians round the banner'd staff  Which Lampon rais'd are gather'd There enjoin'd  To reassemble at a stated hour  Their clinking armour in their homes they cleanse  They whet their spears and falchions to chastise  Geraestian rapine Ere the morning breaks  Four hundred join Themistocles He bends  To Amarynthus seat of Dian pure  His rapid course Her edifice sublime  Which overtops her consecrated bow'r  The second noon discovers Just arriv'd  Carystian helmets round the temple shine  By Hyacinthus and Nicanor led  Joint captains Staid Nicanor was the friend  Return'd from Oreus who the tidings brought  Of poor Cleora's fate Th' Athenian hails  The young commander Gladly do I find  Thy speed surpassing mine but swift explain  Who is the priestess in this pure abode  Then Hyacinthus She Eudora nam'd  For sanctity of manners rank and birth  Through this wellpeople'd island is renown'd  Authority her handmaid Her rich fane  With sumptuous off'rings shines the wealthiest towns  Her intercession at the thrones of heav'n  Obsequious court and dread her brow severe  Of elevated stature awful port  She from Briareus worshipp'd in our walls  Proud origin derives She twangs the bow  The javelin lances through the tusky boar  Chac'd o'er the temple's wide domain of wood  Tall nymphs attend her while the eyes abash'd  Of her own vassals shun her stately step  Ah couldst thou win her favour Haste replies  The ready chief to great Eudora say  Themistocles of Athens humbly sues  To kiss the border of her hallow'd stole  He calls the martial harness from his limbs  Attentive slaves unclasp ablution pure  From limpid streams effaces ev'ry stain  Of his laborious march a chlamys flows  Loose from his shoulders Casting from his brow  The plumed casque uncover'd he ascends  The massy steps of that stupendous fane  In admiration of the glories there  Through cedar valves on argent hinges pois'd  He passes where his own distinguish'd form  No ornament excells In gold the shapes  Of wreaths and garlands crescents stars and suns  Hung round the columns on the pavement broad  Engraven tripods vases statues busts  Of burnish'd brass and silver were dispos'd  In graceful order Pictures where the lips  Seem speaking limbs to act and looks express  The various passions which in varying hues  Exalt the human aspect or degrade  Enrich the walls Orion writhes his bulk  Transfix'd by arrows from th' insulted queen  Of chastity Devour'd by rav'nous hounds  His own Actaeon's metamorphos'd head  Reclines in blood his newlybranching horns  Unbid by Oeneus to th' Aetolian feast  There on her vengeful Calydonian boar  Looks Phoebe down while red her crescent darts  A flame of anger through disparting clouds  Compell'd to lave her violated limbs  Disrob'd Calisto on the fountain's brink  There weeps in vain her virgin vow profan'd  Here deeds of Mercy smile Appeas'd the queen  Folds in the mantle of a silver mist  Pale Iphigenia from the holy knife  At Aulis wafts and substitutes the doe  A fullatoning victim Here she quits  Her Tauric dome unhospitably stain'd  With blood of strangers O'er th' entrusted keel  Of sad Orestes who her image bears  To chace the Furies from his haunted couch  A guardian bland she hovers Through its length  Magnificent the midmost isle conveys  The terminating sight where deep and wide  A luminous recess halfcircling shews  Pilasters chisell'd and a sumptuous freeze  An elevated pavement yet below  The sight whose level skims a surface broad  Of marble green sustains the goddess form  In Parian whiteness emblem of her state  In height five cubits Purity severe  O'ershades her beauty Elegantly group'd  Without confusion dryads oreads round  With nymphs of lakes and fountains fill the space  Lo not unlike the deity she serves  Eudora stands before her and accosts  Th' advancing hero thus I trust thy soul  Some great some righteous enterprize conceives  Else nothing less might justify the din  Of arms around me and these banners proud  Fix'd in my presence on religious ground  Inviolably sacred I would know  Themistocles thy purpose He one knee  Obsequious bends his lips approach the hem  Of her pontific robe nor she forbids  He then replied I should not have besought  Thy condescension priestess had my soul  Less than a righteous enterprize conceiv'd  Deserving sanction from thy holy pure  Allinfluencing wisdom to thy feet  I bring my standard and my sword devote  Spontaneous to thy service While I cast  My wond'ring eyes on this enrich'd abode  On thee its chief embellishment and know  That impious neighbours in Geraestus rule  Foul pillagers and miscreants horror thrills  Thy soldier's bosom from a town oppress'd  Them to extirpate his vindictive arm  Themistocles exalts Eudora look'd  Applauding Go and prosper she rejoin'd  Of this attentive piety O chief  Whom glory crowns thou never shalt repent  Dismiss'd he rested under twilight grey  Renew'd his course Meridian Phoebus view'd  Compact battalions from their shields and helms  Shoot flames of terror on Geraestian woods  A guard was station'd where the narrow path  Gave entrance thither Hyacinthus led  A chosen troop and fierce in accent spake  Train'd to an oar vile remnants of a wreck  Drop ye Barbarian vagabonds those arms  From your ignoble mercenary hands  Th' invincible Themistocles requires  Immediate passage Dubious paus'd their chief  A low Pamphylian rower In contempt  From his inverted spear a pond'rous blow  The youth discharg'd removing all suspence  Prone fell the ruffian like the victim beast  Stunn'd by a brawny sacrificer's blow  Before an altar's fire His troop disperse  The Styrians active by the prudent son  Of Neocles instructed beat the wood  Wielding the bill and ax in wary dread  Of ambush No resistance checks the march  The speeding legion penetrates the shades  Thence rushing dreadful on Geraestus spreads  A blaze of steel So fiery sparks conceal'd  Long in some ancient mansion's girding beam  There gath'ring force unseen a passage break  For conflagration to devour a town  Eudemus joins Themistocles and thus  Behold our miscreant oligarchy rest  On supplication now their sole defence  The injur'd people follow hear the cry  Of imprecation Sev'n flagitious men  By rapine lust and homicide deform'd  Those olive boughs profaning by their touch  Come to pollute thy presence They approach  To whom th' Athenian stern in visage spake  Ye little tyrants who in crimes aspire  To emulate the greatest do ye come  To render up your persons else expect  That populace to seize you and a pile  Of stones to crush your execrable heads  He turns away The fife and trumpet sound  The sev'n surrender mute Eudemus glad  Secures them giv'n to Styra's band in charge  Reviv'd Geraestus to her public place  Which heretofore the people wont to fill  In free assembly as her guardian god  Receives the Attic hero All the way  He passes curses on the tyrants heap'd  He list'ning hears from children for their sires  From wives for husbands mothers for their sons  The various victims of unlawful pow'r  Dishonour'd damsels early robb'd of fame  An orphan train of heritage despoil'd  Indignant husbands of their wives depriv'd  Their joint upbraidings sound By all the gods  Th' Athenian bitterly sarcastic spake  Black spirits your fertility in vice  Deserves my wonder in this narrow spot  You are distinguish'd in the sight of heav'n  By multifarious crimes above the king  Who hath all Asia for his ample range  Be not offended my Geraestian friends  Ere I restore your franchise I will try  If chains and dungeons can allay these flames  Of unexampled wickedness Thou hear'st  Eudemus Now Geraestians you are free  Elect Eudemus archon of the wealth  Those wretches gather'd part to public use  To suff'rers part distribute I demand  But this requital you have felt the woes  Of tyranny obtaining from my hand  Redress that hand enable to preserve  The liberty of others Greece demands  From you that succour which this happy day  She hath by me imparted He withdraws  From acclamations and assenting hearts  To give Eudemus counsel Night is spent  He swiftly back to Amarynthus flies  Each tyrant follows from his dungeon drawn  The sun spectator of his chains and shame  He dreads in horror conscious of his guilt  He shrinks at day like Cerberus when dragg'd  By Hercules from hell Th' accepted chief  His captives ranging in Eudora's sight  Unfolds their dire variety of crimes  Left to her sentence awful she decides  He who oppresses who enslaves mankind  Himself should feel enthralment shame and stripes  Let these to some fell traficker in slaves  Be sold transported in remotest climes  To witness Greek severity on vice  So by my voice should Xerxes be condemn'd  So shall the monster Demonax The means  I find Themistocles in thee Elate  To hear this great authoritative dame  The chief replies Thy mandate is my law  Thy equity is mine Her stately brow  Unbending she concisely questions thus  How shall Eudora's favour mark thy worth  Thy blessing grant he answers well appris'd  That asking little best attains to all  I may do more she said thy ripen'd thoughts  Impart hereafter my extent of aid  Diana must determine Now farewell  He press'd no further tow'rds Carystus turn'd  His march and reach'd her portals while the sun  Wanted three hours to finish his career  There was a temple to Briareus built  The son of Titan In th' enormous shrine  His image vast to thirty cubits rose  In darkest marble Terror thick with curls  O'erlaid the forehead thick th' engraven beard  The spacious chest o'ershadow'd fifty shields  As many maces of refulgent brass  The hundred hands upheld Broad steps around  The pedestal ascended that before  Th' outstretch'd Titanian feet religious fear  Accumulated off'rings might dispose  So to propitiate the tremendous god  In single state before this image stood  Nicomachus the archon to receive  His son triumphant with Cecropia's chief  They now had pass'd th' expanded gates and slow  Approach'd the shrine in military pomp  Along th' extensive isle The walls and dome  Replied to fifes and trumpets to the clink  Of manacles and fetters piercing sound  Which told the wearer's guilt Till now unmark'd  A figure grim and ghastly from the crowd  Darts and a poniard plunging in the breast  Of old Nicomachus himself ascends  The pedestal and lifting his red steel  On high between the god's gigantic feet  Intrepid takes his station Terror dims  Each gazing eye th' illusive medium swells  His size in fancy'd magnitude he tow'rs  Another son of Titan As he stands  Intent to speak Themistocles alone  Of all th' assembly master of himself  Cool gives a sign when thus th' assassin speaks  In phrase barbaric and a soften'd look  I am that Oxus whom suspicion marks  A traitor to Cleora Mistress dear  At this a torrent gushes from his eyes  Thou knew'st me faithful Listen gracious lord  Thou tend'rest consort of the tend'rest wife  O Hyacinthus listen to my tale  Thou too wilt own me faithful On the night  Thy first of absence from Cleora's bed  No more thy love to bless assassins forc'd  Kind Glaucè's dwelling me they bound my voice  They barr'd the priestess and her blameless maids  They strangled Mounted on a rapid steed  One bore Cleora two robust and fell  Were my unresting guards Through trackless woods  Not far we journey'd Demonax was near  Just march'd to waste Eretria's neighb'ring land  Conducting me to loneliest shades my guides  Remain'd a while conferring One I knew  Was Dacus Dacus whom thy sire preferr'd  In trust to all his menials Words like these  He utter'd 'Thus Nicomachus enjoin'd  'Transporting Oxus to obscurest wilds  'Destroy conceal him there Access by night  'To Demonax obtain by earnest suit  'From him exact a promise to declare  'That Oxus brought his daughter then set free  'Was sent rewarded to his Sacian home  'Receive the gold proclaim'd depart Be sure  'No other name than Oxus pass your lips'  This said they gor'd me with repeated wounds  I sunk before them they believ'd me dead  Deep in a pit o'ergrown with brambles thick  They left me Woodmen haply passing heard  My piercing groans in pity to a hut  They bore me herbs medicinal and time  Restor'd my strength His garment he unfolds  The crimson horrors of his num'rous scars  To shew Carystians I my vital breath  Among the Saces on the Caspian drew  A Genius dwells a native in the lake  Who in his function rising from the deep  Reveals fou lmurder Purple are his wings  His hue is jet a diamond his eye  His hair is inextinguishable flame  Whatever man his visitation warns  Neglects to right the dead he haunts he drives  To horrid frenzy On a whirlwind borne  To me in momentary flight he came  In terrors clad uncommon o'er my couch  His clatt'ring pinions shook His mandate high  I have obey'd the soulest murd'rer slain  Now mistress dear sole object of my zeal  Where'er thou art if fleeting on some cloud  A bright aerial spirit if below  Among the Genii of the earth or seas  Dost trace the caves where shine carbuncles pure  Or pluck the coral in cerulean grots  Thy faithful slave shall follow still perform  With his accustom'd vigilance thy will  This said he struck the poniard through his breast  The blows repeating till he pierc'd the heart  Then on the crimson'd pedestal reclin'd  His dying limbs nor groan'd What thoughts were thine  Nicomachus To thee are open'd wide  Death's portals cold thy blood begins to flow  An injur'd son beside thee strives to doubt  That he who gave him being now descends  To sure damnation for so black a crime  But thou remov'st all doubt Thy sister's ghost  Before thee seems to glide and point thy way  To Erebus Briareus' hundred hands  To brandish serpents lashing from his fane  A fordid grovelling parricide to hell  At length amid confession of thy guilt  The furies snatch thee from the light of heav'n  To that eternal gloom The fainting limbs  Of Hyacinthus forth Nicanor bears  Religious dread beholds the shrine impure  With homicide nor knows what man what god  Must be consulted or what rite perform'd  To purge from deeds thus ominous the fane  Till recollection prompts a sudden hope  That wise and great and favour'd from above  Themistocles may succourHe is gone  In double consternation all disperse  Night drops her curtain on the sleepless town  End of the Thirteenth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the FOURTEENTH  BRIGHT morning sheds no gladness on the face  Of pale Carystu  who in visions fram'd  By superstitious fear all night had seen  Briareus lift his hundred hands to crush  His fane polluted from the base to rend  Each pillar'd mass and hurl the fragments huge  Against her tow'rs Anon is terror chang'd  To wonder which consoles her Through her gates  Amid the lustre of meridian day  In slow procession solemnly advance  A hundred youths in spotless tunics white  Sustaining argent wands A vig'rous band  Of sacerdotal servitors succeed  Who draw by turns the silvergraven shape  Of Dian lofty on a wheeling stage  Of artificial verdure Virgins tall  A guard surround her each in flowing snow  Of raiment gather'd in a rosy knot  Above one knee They tread in sandals white  O'erlac'd by roseate bands behind their necks  Of lilly's hue depend their quivers full  Hands which can string their tough and pond'rous bows  Eyes darting beams severe discover strength  Unbroke by wedlock hearts by love untam'd  Soft light the silver crescents on their heads  Diffuse Eudora follows in her car  Across her shoulders hangs a quiver large  Fullfac'd a crystal moon illumes her hair  Penthesilea's Amazonian arm  Had scarce the nerves to bend Eudora's bow  Her port her aspect fascinate the sight  Before her passing tow'rs and temples seem  To sink below her level she becomes  The single object eminent her neck  Her arms the vestment shuts from view prophane  Low as her feet descends the sacred stole  Eight purpleharness'd steeds of milky hue  Her axle draw Before her footstool sits  The vanquisher of Xerxes to the reins  Of argent lustre his obsequious hand  Themistocles applies A hundred guards  In burnish'd steel and plumes like ridges new  Of winter's fleeces not unmartial rank'd  Behind her wheels the city's widest space  They reach To all the people swarming round  In awful state the priestess thus began  Impiety and parricide which spilt  In Juno's sight her servant Glaucè's blood  Your god by double homicide profan'd  May well dismay Carystus Lo I come  Afflicted city in thy day of woe  Both to propitiate and conciliate heav'n  Learn first no off'ring of a hundred bulls  Not clouds of incense nor exhausted stores  Of richest wine can moderate his wrath  Which visits children for the sire's offence  And desolates whole nations for the crimes  Of kings and chiefs unless by double zeal  By violence of virtue man disarm  The jealous thunderer Happy is your lot  The capital offender still survives  On him inflicted vengeance by your hands  Men of Carystus will from Jove regain  And multiply his blessings on yourselves  Your sons and daughters Swear then old and young  Swear all before the freshpolluted shrine  Ere you remove the carnage from that fane  Unite your valour by a gen'ral oath  That you will strengthen this Athenian's arm  Whom I from Dian in the awful name  Of all the gods and goddesses adjure  To quell the monster Demonax by heav'n  By earth detested parricide and scourge  Tyrannic o'er Euboea At these words  She fix'd an arrow in her mighty bow  Then rising said against an impious head  Incens'd Diana thus her war declares  A cloud lowhanging instant by the force  Of springing wind a boreal course began  Tow'rds Oreus thither bent Eudora's eye  Swift from her sounding string through folds obscure  Of that thick vapour as it fleets away  The arrow imperceptibly descends  To earth Fortuitous a sulph'rous spark  Flash'd from the cloud A prodigy exclaim'd  Themistocles the holy shaft is chang'd  To Jove's own bolt and points the forked flame  On Demonax Swear swear the people shout  A gen'ral exhortation rends the cope  Ethereal Prompted by the subtil voice  Of her prevailing counsellor again  Eudora solemn You for once my friends  Must supersede the strictness of your laws  Though Hyacinthus has not reach'd the date  Prescrib'd to those who wield the rule supreme  Elect him archon Gallant injur'd youth  Sage pious him Diana best approves  Him her unerring counsels will inspire  Me too her priestess in your need she lends  I will promulge the sacred oath to all  I from pollution will your town redeem  Unanimous consent is heard Her car  She leaves Before Briareus in her words  Sons fathers youth and age enlist their spears  Meantime th' Athenian to Nicanor's home  Resorts He passes to the chamber sad  Whence Hyacinthus utters these complaints  Dost thou Nicanor parallel with mine  The Oedipean horrors or the pangs  Felt by the race of Pelops and deserv'd  Thus wouldst thou waken patience in a breast  Which feels affliction far surpassing theirs  Feels undeserv'd affliction Whom O Jove  By error lust or malice have I wrong'd  Cut short my bloomtorment me here no more  Let Rhadamanthus instantly decide  If with Cleora I must taste of bliss  Or with a father drink eternal woe  Here for a murder'd wife my eyes to stream  Shall never cease andexecrable sire  Not grief but all which furies can excite  Rage detestation horror I must feel  For thee my origin of lifewhat life  Yet O thou spirit damn'd the wretch thy son  The wretch a father's cruelty hath made  Perhaps might spare a tearbut Glaucè's ghost  Thy righteous hallow'd sister's ghost forbids  One drop of pity on thy pains to fall  She skrieks aloud curse curse thy father's dust  Themistocles now enter'd At his look  Which carry'd strange ascendancy a spell  Controlling nature was the youth abash'd  As if his just sensations were a shame  Or his complaints to reach that hero's ear  Were criminal He falt'ring spake Thou god  Of Hyacinthus passion thou dost awe  Thy presence humbles frenzy and despair  No thy own manly fortitude alone  Shall chase despair and frenzy from thy breast  Serene Themistocles reply'd Arise  Thou newcreated archon private cares  To interfere with public neither men  Nor gods allow nor justice nor the sense  Of thy own wrongs Young friend the noble toil  Of mind and body in this righteous cause  Will give thee rank with heroes Thou assist  Nicanor share the glory By the hand  He led the passive youth The people met  Their young their honour'd magistrate in joy  Eudora bless'd them then in solemn zeal  The purifying rites perform'd and left  Reviv'd Carystus To her holy seat  While on the way her goddess radiant shone  Themistocles attended then by dawn  Back to Eretria swiftly press'd his march  Not Aeolus the king of winds could still  Their gust nor Neptune smooth his troubled waves  Nor Jove the raging thunderbolt compose  More than divine Themistocles had tam'd  Oppression terror anguish and despair  This had Geraestus in her evil day  The panicaw'd Carystians this had prov'd  Not less than sad Eretria Her he finds  Rejoicing like some widow late forlorn  Who in the house of mourning with a train  Of pining orphans  titute had  But by a hand beneficent uprais'd  Ungirds the humble sackcloth from her loins  Nor longer sprinkles ashes on her head  Amid reviving plenty Such the change  Among the Eretrians through the copious aid  Sicinus lent within Chalcidic walls  Still sedulous abiding Ev'ry face  The gladd'ning touch of rosytinctur'd health  Illumines Now from ruins clear'd the streets  By stable feet of passengers are trod  Th' impending season's turbulence to foil  Works under Cleon's and Tisander's eye  Begun the vig'rous populace inspir'd  By their protector's presence now pursue  With industry to match the beaver breed  Laborious and sagacious who construct  By native art their mansions to repel  Congealing air and hoary drifts of snow  In winter's harsh domains From day to day  The toil continued Early on a morn  A stranger came in body all deform'd  In look oblique but keen an eastern garb  Enwrapp'd his limbs distorted from his tongue  Fell barb'rous accents He address'd the chief  In Grecian phrase which falter'd on his tongue  I am a Tyrian trafficker in slaves  Returning home from Libya have been forc'd  By dang'rous winds to this Euboean coast  For shelter Watching for a friendly gale  I learn'd from fame that warrior thou dost wield  A sword which prospers and its captives dooms  To servitude Themistocles commands  The sev'n Geraestian tyrants from his ship  Where at the bottom they had gnash'd their teeth  In chains unslacken'd To the merchant then  Without a price these miscreants from our climes  Remove the farthest hence will best repay  The obligation For a master chuse  The most ferocious savage on the wilds  Of horrid Scythia or the Caspian bound  Secure conductors he appoints a band  To chain them fast aboard Each irksome step  They count in curses O'er Euboea lost  Not as their native region but the seat  Of pow'r and crimes triumphantly enjoy'd  They weep still criminal in tears But soon  When from the harbour distance had obscur'd  The wellrow'd bark the fetters from their limbs  The merchant orders who another tone  Another mien assuming thus began  Geraestian lords redemption you derive  From Demonax of Oreus Me the first  Among his council Lamachus by name  He sent to practice on the wily chief  Of Athens wiles which undermine his own  They land at Dium thence to Oreus march  Where Demonax admits them as he sat  In secret council 'Your disasters known  'Obtain'd our instant succour What intends  'Themistocles' This answer is return'd  Not less great prince Themistocles intends  Than thy destruction Of Eretrian blood  All who survive Geraestus Styra join  Against thy throne Carystus from her walls  Will pour battalions by Eudora fir'd  The Amarynthian priestess hath declar'd  War in Diana's name The lab'ring hind  Will quit the furrow shepherds from their flocks  Youths from their sport the keeper from his herd  Will run to arms at her commanding voice  So prevalent the sound The tyrant turns  To Mindarus the Persian Let us march  Swift to destroy the serpent in his egg  To him the Persian Demonax forgets  That winter's rigour chills the soldier's blood  Dost thou not hear the tempest while it howls  Around us Ev'n Mardonius active bold  Now rests in covert of Thessalian roofs  Nor fights with nature Shall my gen'ral hear  That I conduct the race of hottest climes  In freezing rain and whirlwinds to assail  A strongwall'd town protected by a chief  For valour skill and stratagem renown'd  With all th' unsparing elements his guard  Again the tyrant Mindarus confine  Thy Asiatics till the roses bud  While I in howling storms in damps or frost  Will head my own Euboeans Heav'n forbid  The wary Lamachus subjoins My lord  Repose no trust without thy foreign bands  In these new subjects Gods th' alluring guile  Of that Athenian would dissolve thy ranks  To his own hostile banner would seduce  Half thy battalions Demonax again  Then policy with policy shall war  Among th' Eretrians publish from their hands  This virulent Athenian I require  Bound and deliver'd to my will their wives  Their children else late captives of my sword  Shall from their state of servitude be dragg'd  To bleed th' immediate victims of my wrath  Then Mindarus Should great Mardonius hear  That I such inhumanity permit  He would exert his full monarchal pow'r  My guilty limbs condemning to a cross  In fury foaming Demonax exclaims  I am betray'd Thee Mindarus the son  Of that stern prince who laid Eretria waste  Thee Xerxes future sov'reign of the world  Appointed my supporter in this isle  That I a branch from his imperial root  Might grow a splendid vassal of his throne  My cause his service now thy heart disowns  Perverse thy sword abandons Of my friends  Thou best requited most ingrate Preferr'd  Once to have been my son of treasures vast  The destin'd heir my successor in sway  Dost thou desert me and protect my foes  But to Mardonius to the mighty king  I will accuse thee By th' infernal pow'rs  Themistocles hath gain'd thee or thou fear'st  To face that captain on the field of war  His breast the Persian striking thus in tears  Dost thou recall thy parricide to wound  My inmost bosom though another held  My dear Cleora by the holiest ties  I would have struggled with despairing love  But sink o'erwhelm'd by horror of that deed  Which blasting such perfection calls on heav'n  For punishment unbounded If thou fall'st  It is the hand of Horomazes weighs  To earth a body overcharg'd with guilt  Dost thou upbraid me undeserving man  Forgetting recent service Who restor'd  Thy scepter lost what captain hath reduc'd  Orobia Dium half Euboea's towns  But Mindarus He these atchievements past  Regrets but while appointed by his prince  Will urge his duty to accomplish new  Then come the season for a warrior's toil  Themistocles shall see my banner guide  Twelve thousand spears shall see my early sword  To gen'ral battle or to single fight  Defy th' experience of his pow'rful arm  He said and left the council All withdrew  But Lamachus The tiger when escap'd  Or fell hyaena from an eager chace  Of dogs and hunters feels not more dismay  Mix'd with a thirst insatiate of revenge  Than shook the monster Demonax who thus  To Lamachus Insulted and controul'd  By an audacious stranger do I rule  In Oreus longer By a poison'd draught  Or midnight poniard Mindarus shall die  Ariobarzanes second in command  Will serve me best The counsellor subjoins  If secret poison or a midnight blow  Would remedy the grievance I would try  Their instant operation but reflect  Twelve thousand warriors masters of thy fate  Who love their gen'ral living on his death  Might prove too harsh inquisitors At least  His courage use once more on open foes  A valiant leader makes the soldier brave  So have we found in Mindarus Reserve  Assassination for a greater mark  Themistocles The tyrant quick Proclaim  Five golden talents on his head the price  Discreet though wicked Lamachus again  Wouldst thou incense all Greece whose navy rules  The main Howe'er triumphant in the field  No timely help Mardonius could extend  The genius of Themistocles the nymph  Of Salamis indignant by his side  Would range from state to state Their loud alarm  Would send the whole confederated fleet  Before the earliest breezes of the spring  To pour vindictive myriads on our coast  Then what our doom No Demonax my lord  These sev'n Geraestians while thy recent grace  Transports their minds and blows the embers hot  Of rage at recent insult let us league  Against this formidable man by oaths  Before the furies in their neighb'ring cave  Thyself be present Yes the monster said  I will be present though Cleora's ghost  Be there and that vile produce which disgrac'd  Her virgin zone Remembrance of his guilt  He rous'd to strengthen fury and revenge  There was a cavern in the bowels deep  Of naked rock by Oreus where the stern  Eumenides possess'd a dusky shrine  And frown'd in direful idols from the time  That Titan's offspring o'er Euboea reign'd  The enemies of Jove Around it slept  A stagnant water overarch'd by yews  Growth immemorial which forbade the winds  E'er to disturb the melancholy pool  To this the fabled residence abhorr'd  Of hellsprung beings Demonax himself  Predominating daemon of the place  Conducts the sev'n assassins There no priest  Officiates single there as Charon grim  A boatman wafts them to the cavern's mouth  They enter fenc'd in armour down the black  Descent o'er moist and lubricated stone  They tread unstable Night's impurest birds  With noisome wings each loathing visage beat  Of each the shudd'ring flesh through plated steel  By slimy efts and clinging snakes is chill'd  Cold creeping toads beset th' infected way  Now at the cave's extremity obscene  They reach the sisters three

the wicked and deform'd  An ewe in dye like ebony he gor'd  The dark abyss receiv'd a purple stream  Next to the dire conspirators he held  A vessel o'er the brim their naked arms  They stretch'd he pierc'd the veins th' envenom'd blood  A fit libation mix'd for hell he pour'd  Down the deep cleft then falt'ring half dismay'd  At his own rites began Ye injur'd men  Of wealth and honours violently spoil'd  Implacably condemn'd to bonds and rods  By insolent Themistocles before  These dreadful goddesses you swear his death  You vow by every means revenge can prompt  In secret ambush or in open fight  By day by night with poison sword or fire  Else on your heads you imprecate the wrath  Of these inexorable pow'rs They swore  Meantime the object of their impious oaths  Whate'er his future

Not Medon's sister of th' Oetaean hill  Though beauteous like the goddesses she serves  Exceed Acanthè she may almost vye  With Amarantha's celebrated form  The pride of Delphian Timon To behold  The

energy of wiles  Alluring wiles to melt the proudest fair  In his approach he moves the genuine sire  Of all the Graces on Acanthè's hand  To print his lips Invited by that hand  Close to her lovely side of her alone  He sits observant while the rich repast  Continu'd Soon his vigilance perceiv'd  That her unsated ear devour'd his words  That from her lip an equal spell enthrall'd  Her doating

To sueif yet thy gentleness should deem  Too curious too importunate her suit  Thy host Timoxenus at least indulge  That o'er his festive hall th' achievements high  Which Salamis and Artemisium saw  Though now but whisper'd from thy gracious lips  May sound hereafter loud The wily chief  Ne'er disinclin'd to celebrate his deeds  Now to this lovely auditress whose aid  His further fame requir'd a

Chalcis But thy sword  Offensive drawn shall utterly confound  The homicide thy neighbour Ah replies  Timoxenus alarm'd thou little know'st  The might of Oreus Demonax can range  Twelve thousand warriors cull'd from Asia's host  Of train'd Euboean youth and lightarm'd slaves  A multitude innum'rous on the plain  His own exactions and the Persian's boons  O'erload his treasure When the annual sun  In his new course three monthly terms hath fill'd  Expect Mardonius from Thessalia's bounds  On Greece to pour invasion Ah what help  Should we exchange tranquillity for war  From her own wants could Attica supply  What LacedaemonCool th' Athenian here  Weigh well the grace your Polyphemus dy'd  In carnage grants reserving for his last  Most precious morsel your Chalcidian wealth  Shall this

blessing such a child  As thy Acanthè he thy vengeance dreads  O paragon of fathers dreads thy sword  Unsheath'd with mine Presumption I disclaim  Or want of def'rence to the wise like thee  Accept this roll contemplate there the force  Of Amarynthus of Carystus large  Geraestus and Eretria add the spears  Of Delphian Timon of that hero fam'd  Oilean Medon who my signal watch  From Atalantè's isle Remote the time  For action then deliberate I wait  Without impatience thy resolves mature  Retir'd Acanthè whose enlighten'd mind  Was bless'd with native talents as her form  With beauty strives a while in reason's scale  To weigh th' importance of this high attempt  Propos'd when something whispers canst thou doubt  Themistocles a moment Can his sword  Do less than conquer Where the pow'rful arm  The valour where the policy to vie  With him whose faculties no man can reach  No god raise higher These conceptions prove  A guide to fancy half the sleepless night  Through all th' enchanting scenery of thought  Which recollection of his brilliant deeds  His courage might humanity and grace  His gentle manners and majestic frame  Exhibits lovely dazzling and sublime  To melt her softness and her wisdom blind  Envelop'd now by slumber in a dream  Which overleaps all measur'd time and space  She sees the laurell'd hero as return'd  From subjugated Oreus On his spear  The gory head of Demonax he bears  Her yet untainted purity of heart  Which in sincerity of grief had mourn'd  Cleora's fate applauds the just award  By Nemesis and Themis on the guilt  Of parricide Her nobleness of soul  Enjoys the blessings which Euboea reaps  From such a conquest but no vision kind  Would interpose a warning to allay  Excess of transport at the conqu'ror's sight  From fair Acanthè's own retreat at night  A wellembellish'd gallery's long range  Bounds on the splendid chamber which admits  Themistocles to rest Acanthè here  When magisterial duties from his home  Her father call'd had entertain'd the guest  By morn and feasted all and every morn  On rich profusion of his Attic words  The sun was ris'n and summon'd from her couch  To this accustom'd interview the fair  Not meeting straight the object of her search  As each preceding morn she feels a pain  That he is absent With a voice though low  His chamber sounds to listen she disdains  Back to her own by delicacy led  In cautious tones Sicinus with his lord  Was thus discoursing In my wonted walk  To watch events since thy arrival here  I met Nearchus Haste he said apprise  Themistocles that long ere op'ning day  His potent friends Timoxenus conven'd  Heads of his faction They refuse to arm  Some I suspect are tainted by the gold  Of Demonax the major part in all  Obey the timid archon I have strength  Which when Themistocles commands shall try  To force compliance from the coward's breast  But would Acanthè noble dame espouse  The glorious cause her prevalence could guide  His doating fondness and controul his fears  Enough replies Themistocles Again  The learned tutor fervent and sincere  If thy persuasive eloquence could win  Her noble spirit to direct her sire  It would be well But O resistless man  Let thy persuasion moderate its charm  Let not a gen'rous lady's peace of mind  Become the victim of her winning guest  The laws of hospitality revere  Remember too the hymeneal vow  Remember thy Timothea fair and kind  Who bore those children pupils of my care  She now in Athens at thy absence pines  Misjudging friend Timothea never pines  When I am urging my career of fame  Returns the chief Euboeans must be freed  She shall know all and knowing will commend  Go charge Nearchus to suppress all thought  Of violence his valour shall have scope  Dy'd in Barbarian not in civil blood  Thus he wellcaution'd that in Chalcis pow'r  Aristocratic both in wealth and strength  Outweigh'd the people Then a splendid gem  Of all his spoils the richest he selects  And from his chamber o'er the sounding plank  Which floors the echoing gallery proceeds  Behold Acanthè not the orient sky  Forth from its amber gates in summer's prime  The goddesswidow of Tithonus sends  More fragrant nor in blushes more to charm  A new emotion heaves her gentle breast  Of swelling snow Th' Athenian distant mute  Remains To speak her hesitating lips  A while though prompted by her heart delay  When shap'd by chance this elegant request  Flows from her unpremeditated thoughts  So much oblig'd already courteous guest  By thy narration I have cause to blush  While I solicit a recital new  Of one exploit distinguish'd from the rest  When Ariabignes fell before thy sword  In sight of Greece Themistocles requir'd  No repetition of the flatt'ring suit  But in transcendent energy of style  Impress'd the bright achievement on her mind  More deep than ev'n by novelty before  Thus he concluded Doubly now I bless  Th' auspicious hour when my successful hand  Despoil'd the bravest chief in Asia's host  Of this my humble off'ring to adorn  The fairest head in Greece He said the gem  Presenting graceful which she turn'd aside  Rejecting not the giver but the gift  And answer'd thus To heaps of richest gems  To all the tribute pour'd at Persia's throne  Thy words alone thy converse I prefer  Her look perusing earnest he proceeds  Dost thou refuse a token of regard  From one thy hospitable hand hath bless'd  Beyond th' expression of his grateful tongue  When at this hour departing he again  Perhaps may ne'er behold theeAh depart  She in unguarded consternation sighs  Th' Athenian here in seeming sadness thus  Alas thy father I too surely know  Will never join my arms can I remain  Till this fair city populous and rich  This mansion thy inestimable worth  Become the prey of DemonaxThis heav'n  Will ne'er permit she eagerly replies  Thou wilt protect meGuardian to distress  Thou wilt not hurry to desert a friend  Whose hospitable kindness thou hast prais'd  Fill fill with pow'rful argument the mouth  Of me thy suppliant for another week  My words Timoxenus regards The chief  By interruption sooths her troubled mind  I came to save thee If another week  Thou wilt employ I will I will she said  Do thou but stay my father I will bind  To thee whom victory can ne'er forsake  They part his chamber he regains not long  He meditates Acanthè grants her aid  Spontaneous Now to elevate her soul  By dignity of thought and gen'rous hope  Of glory purchas'd by a noble deed  He thus contrives On tablets fair and large  For her deportment tow'rds a doating sire  His ready style instruction copious draws  Clos'd in these words 'Among the guardians heav'n  'To Greece hath destin'd an exalted mind  'Enrolls Acanthè let her constant feet  'Pursue her leading

Chalcis Daily hourly he surveys  The martial toil Acanthè's presence aids  His prudence leads her through these active scenes  He talks on military themes alone  And pictures freedom trampling on the

ATHENAID  BOOK the SIXTEENTH  THAT month severe unfolding to the sun  A frosty portal whence his steeds renew  Their yearly round was clos'd O'ercome at night  By toil uncommon lay th' Athenian chief  In early sleep profound which early freed  His eyes again In suffocating fumes  He wakes Upstarting round his limbs he wraps  Th' external garment and Sicinus calls  Who slept not distant He unbars a door  Which shews the gallery in flames Down sinks  The crackling floor A main sustaining beam  From end to end transverse another stands  Yet unconsum'd Lo trembling in his view  Acanthè inextinguishable flames  Between them rage A moment he devotes  To eye the gulph which menaces with death  Him and his hopes in him the Grecian weal  Would Aristides hesitate thus long  To save the meanest I before me see  On life's last verge a creature half divine  Urg'd by that thought along the burning beam  He rushes swift He catches in his arms  The looserob'd fairone clinging round his neck  Returning not like Orpheus who regain'd  Eurydicè and lost with matchless strength  He holds his prize above the pointed spires  Of fiery volumes which on either side  Assail his passing steps The son of Jove  Not more undaunted through the livid blaze  Of Pluto's mansion bore the victim pure  Of conjugal affection back to life  Alcestis Lo Sicinus stops his feet  In their mid course Thy chamber flames he cries  Speed o'er this traverse beam yon open door  Leads to a passage yet unscorch'd He guides  The hero follows danger here augments  As through a swelling tide he wades through fire  Which scath'd his brows his blazing beard and hair  Nor spar'd the garments of his precious charge  Yet her unhurt through that befriending door  His unrelax'd rapidity conveys  Of pain regardless to the public street  He thence descends no populace is here  That front vulcanian fury had not reach'd  The other draws the throng confusion there  Prevails uproar and terror On he speeds  Through frozen air and falling flakes of snow  Unwearied still his lovely burden holds  Acanthè fainting her uncover'd breast  Unless that ringlets of her locks unbound  Let fall at times their loose and silky threads  Against his cheek with marble coldness press'd  At last the dwelling of Nearchus nigh  Affords a refuge On a friendly bed  But not of rest Themistocles in pain  Extends his limbs Acanthè female slaves  Receive and cherish Absent is their lord  Who at the head of military files  In haste collected early but in vain  Had issued forth The palace is consum'd  Timoxenus to shelter he conducts  The archon trembling for his daughter's fate  Beholds her safe and feels no other loss  Now all salute Themistocles but first  Sicinus spake Infernal arts have laid  Thy palace waste Timoxenus I saw  Sulphureous glutinous materials blaze  Close to the chamber of my lord's repose  From lips nigh parch'd by torture of his pains  Themistocles began My earthly term  If heav'n requir'd me now to close enough  I have atchiev'd to fill the trump of fame  To have preserv'd thy daughter gen'rous host  Would crown my glory Medon is not far  Well would that chief my vacant post supply  Were I remov'd But friends my hurts are light  Which common succour of Machaon's art  Will soon repair yet publish you my state  As dang'rous words and looks observe keen spies  To Oreus send Thus

her all  I have been faithful to my nuptial vow  Yet have succeeded Let th' Athenians know  My force and destin'd enterprize forbear  Of them to crave assistance let them act  As humour sways Cleander shouldst thou meet  In kindest greetings tell him I should prize  Troezenian succourTo its healing folds  I am solicited by sleepFarewell  Not so Acanthè's troubles are compos'd  When lenient balm of Morpheus steep'd the cares  Of other bosoms in the midnight damps  She quits a thorny pillow Half array'd  With naked feet she roams a spacious floor  Whence she contemplates that retreat of rest  Inclosing all her wishes hapless fair  Without one hope there stifling sighs she melts  In silent tears The sullen groan of winds  Which shake the roof the beating rain she hears  Unmov'd nor heeds stern winter who benumbs  Her tender beauties in his harsh embrace  O Love to vernal sweets to summer's air  To bow'rs which temper sult'ry suns at noon  Art thou confin'd To rills in lulling flow  To flow'rs which scent thy arbours of recess  To birds who sing of youth and soft desire  All is thy empire ev'ry season thine  Thou universal origin of things  Sole ruler oft a tyrant Stealing steps  Full frequent draw Acanthè to the door  Of her preserver While he sleeps and pain  Excites no groan to wound her list'ning ear  Anxiety abates but passion grows  Then recollecting his intrepid strides  Through fiery surge devouring as he pass'd  His hair majestie wreathing round his limbs  In torment which none else to save her life  Would face or could endure unguarded thought  In murm'ring transport issues from her lips  To boundless obligation can I shew  Less than unbounded gratitudeBase tongue  Dar'st thou the name of gratitude profane  Which is a virtueOh thou impious flame  Within my breast not gratitude hath blown  Thee from a spark to so intense a heat  Deprav'd Acanthè vagabond impure  Of night from honour and its laws estrang'd  A robber's criminal desire of spoil  Thou feel'st a rage of sacrilege to force  The sanctuary of Hymen and that fire  Which law religion men and gods protect  Quench on his altar by the hand of vice  She could no more A parting cloud reveal'd  The moon Before the silver light she dropp'd  On her bare knee enfeebled by the cold  There fix'd and freezing from that awful pow'r  Of chastity she seem'd invoking help  When newlywaken'd by her piercing moan  With smarting limbs Themistocles had left  His pillow keener his internal pang  To see an image of despair the work  Of his fallacious art On his approach  At once the worn remains of spirit fled  From her cold bosom heaving now no more  The twilight glimmers on the rear of night  His painful arms uplift her from the floor  And to her couch with decency of care  Commit her lifeless charms To sense restor'd  Just as the morn's exploring eye unclos'd  Acanthè faint and speechless by a sign  Forbids his presence cautious he retires  Now she indulg'd her agonies of shame  And selfreproach With horrid visions teem'd  Her agitated brain blackrob'd despair  Stalk'd round her curtains in his double grasp  A bloody poniard and empoison'd bowl  To her sad choice upholding but ere long  That thirsty parching malady which boils  The putrid blood and ravages like fire  Invades her frame Whole days whole nights she saw  A tender sire beside her pillow mourn  Her beauties wasting hourly in his view  To gentler forms delirium then would change  The moon so lately to her aid invok'd  She saw descending from her lucid sphere  Assume her shape of goddess who inspir'd  A soothing thought to seek for health and peace  At her propitious oracle not rob  So kind a father of his only joy  Meantime the tidings vague of Chalcis burn'd  And great Themistocles destroy'd had fame  Proclaim'd aloud through each Euboean town  Save where Sicinus passing to his port  Of embarkation spreads a milder tale  Alarming still Eretria scarce confines  Tisander's falt'ring age but Cleon thence  From Styra Lampon hastes Geraestus sends  Eudemus Hyacinthus feels no more  His own distress and rapid as the bird  Of Jupiter through heav'n's aerial way  Flies to his guardian friend Eudora skill'd  In healing juices condescends to mount  Herself the sacred axle and her state  Displays in Chalcis worshipping her wheels  The archon waits respectful on her steps  When she salutes th' Athenian still recluse  From public view though nigh restor'd He bends  The knee before her Him with stately grace  She raises then addresses Glad I see  Thy convalescence to impart my help  Became a duty So Diana will'd  By me consulted in her solemn grove  Mysterious where an impulse warn'd my soul  That none but thou can set Euboea free  Protect the temples and her tyrant quell  He kiss'd her sacred vestment and replied  I now perceive how pow'rful are thy pray'rs  To them so favour'd by the gods I owe  My preservation which O learn'd and wise  Forestalls thy skill Ah since thy face hath deign'd  To cheer this city by a long abode  Complete the blessing As to ancient Troy  Was that Palladian image sent from heav'n  Be thou to Chalcis At thy presence known  Pale Demonax will shrink But first apply  Thy lenient succour to my friend's distress  Whose daughter pines in sickness and deserves  Thy full regard most holy and benign  To sad Acanthè's couch the archon leads  Eudora Soon from Oreus tidings stern  Awake the native terrors in his heart  In haste he greets Themistocles O guest  Fierce Demonax assembles all his force  But first will try an embassy expect  Within three days the tyrant's fell demands  Which not accepted bring th' avenging waste  Of his redoubled fury on our heads  Is he so poor in counsellors began  Th' Athenian calm Amid disabling storms  In this rough season will th' insensate brute  Drag to the field his Asiatic host  He thinks me dead remember thou my friend  Themistocles is living nor conceive  The rash disturb'd and selftormenting breast  Of such a tyrant whom the furies haunt  Hath fortitude and conduct to withstand  Themistocles in arms Not halfreviv'd  Subjoins the archon Thou alas may'st want  The brave auxiliars promis'd to thy arms  To thee alike unfriendly are the storms  Which lock our harbours not a bark can sail  Illustrious Medon dares not plough the surge  From Atalantè nor on Attic shores  Of our distress can Aristides hear  True answers firm Themistocles though stung  Nor shall we want him Is not Cleon here  Nearchus Lampon sharers of success  In my preceding conflicts Of no price  Is staid Eudemus Hyacinthus brave  Is not Eudora present sacred dame  Who will her face majestical unveil  Among confederated ranks to bless  The Eleutherian banner and inspire  Your populace with all religion's flame  Yon despicable embassy prepare  To answer nobly or let me be heard  Now to this chamber summon all my friends  Timoxenus conven'd them Swift the chief  Dispatch'd them ardent to their native states  Thence their collected citizens in arms  The guardians of Chalcidic walls to lead  Three days elaps'd the embassy arriv'd  Amid the senate on his chair of state  The archon sat Th' Athenian's sure support  Behind is planted Fierce in tone and look  Th' Orēan herald represents his lord  Ye men of Chalcis Demonax requires  That you acknowledge Xerxes that your gates  A Persian garrison admit Be wise  Refusal draws perdition on your heads  Timoxenus turns pale his falt'ring lips  Make no reply Th' indignant senate mourn  Their state dishonour'd by a timid chief  When timely steps Themistocles in sight  Whose name is murmur'd through th' applauding court  As at the aspect of a single cloud  Known by the trembling seaman to contain  Destructive blasts the sail he swiftly furls  With anxious wish for shelter in the lee  Of some still shore the herald thus relax'd  His alter'd features Arrogance abash'd  Foreboded ruin from that mighty arm  In vigour brac'd by unexpected health  In act to speak the hero stretch'd his hand  To fear and impotent distress he seem'd  Extending refuge like a poplar tall  Whose grateful branches cool the green descent  To some pellucid fountain where his course  Th' o'erweary'd passenger suspends to slake  His eager thirst beneath such friendly shade  Bent to provoke the tyrant and mislead  His rashness thus Themistocleshis look  Transpierc'd the humbled herald while he spake  Begone base Greek from Chalcis In her name  Defiance bear to Demonax whose head  Shall on the gate of Oreus be affix'd  Thine to some trafficker in slaves be sold  To Oreus back th' astonish'd herald flies  On whose report his impious lord incens'd  Blasphemes the gods The Furies he invokes  To them a human sacrifice devotes  His first Chalcidian captives From his host  Two chosen myriads on the plain he pours  Brave Mindarus by duty to his king  Compell'd to service which his sword abhors  Ariobarzanes second in command  Barbarian homicide whose joy is blood  The sev'n Geraestians sworn to deeds of hell  With Lamachus of foul mishapen frame  Attend the tyrant spreading to rude storms  His banner fell So Satan from the north  Of heav'n his region once with Moloc grim  Beëlzebub and Nisroc led the host  Of impious angels all the destin'd prey  Of Tartarus Meanwhile th' Athenian sat  Serene in Chalcis his auxiliar bands  Successively arriv'd Eretria sent  Twelve hundred spears Carystus doubled those  Beneath her standard Amarynthus rang'd  Eudora's vassals Styra cas'd in steel  Five hundred warriors tried seven hundred more  Geraestus Chalcis from her loins supplied  Four thousand youths Nearchus was their chief  Th' Athenian's care had trac'd the region round  A level champaign tow'rds septentrion skies  Extends its western border is the frith  Whose shore is bold and press'd by waters deep  A line of anchor'd vessels which o'erlook  The land the chief disposes here whose crews  Were menials train'd to missile weapons light  Full opposite and cross the plain he mark'd  A quarry parent of the domes and tow'rs  Exalting Chalcis o'er Euboean towns  The subterranean passages by all  Inscrutable but lab'ring hinds who cleave  Earth's marble womb he garrisons with bands  From that rough breed supported by a force  Of heavymail'd Chalcideans left in charge  To bold Nearchus So the watchful bees  Within their hive lie dangerous on guard  Against invasion of their precious stores  Their industry and state By morn the care  Of active scouts proclaims the adverse host  Not far though yet unseen The trumpet sounds  To fight Eudora mounts her car and wields  The arms of Dian Through the spacious streets  Where under ensigns of their sev'ral states  The warriors blaze in steel from band to band

thoughts her country's cause  She felt heroic talents she admir'd  Him who possess'd them all her heart recall'd  Though with abated passion All his tale  Of Salamis the stratagem deriv'd  From conjugal affection from the sight  Of forms belov'd to animate the brave  Recurr'd she summon'd to her languid bed  The most distinguish'd matrons them besought  To mount the walls and overlook the fight  In all its terrors Imitate she said  The Attic dames that Chalcis may partake  Of Attic glory They approving went  O mortals born to err when most you smart  With selfreproach on guilty passion's wound  Attempt one act of virtue then your breasts  Will like Acanthè's now enjoy a calm  In supplication thus her wonder breaks  Ye lights who shining on my darkness deign  To lift the veil of error from my eyes  Protecting pow'rs accept Acanthè's pray'r  For this her native city for a sire  Too kind for great Themistocles who draws  The sword of JusticeNow with purer lips  I sound his nameAnd O illustrious dame  Of all Athenian excellence the flow'r  Bless'd in a hero's love the precious gift  Of hymeneal Juno couldst thou know  What I have suffer'd by an envious flame  What still I suffer while remorse awakes  A thought of thee thy gen'rous soul would melt  In pity ev'n forgiveness when I vow  To ev'ry chaste divinity invok'd  That I will see Themistocles no more  This victory accomplish'd renders back  Her virtue late a captive which recalls  Affections pure and sanctity of mind  Still thoughts and hope restorative of peace  But on a diff'rent victory intent  Themistocles within Chalcidic walls  Contains his ready host nor means to throw  The portals open nor display the face  Of battle till the enemies in sight  Yield full advantage in his choice of time  So in his deep concealment of green reeds  On Ganges' margin or the flaggy strand  Of Niger's flood from Aethiopia roll'd  The alligator vigilant maintains  His fraudful ambush that unwary steps  May bring the prey to his voracious jaws  End of the Sixteenth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the SEVENTEENTH  SICINUS long by unpropitious winds  Lock'd in Geraestus to their fickle breath  Halfadverse still impatient spread the sail  Six revolutions of the sun he spent  To gain Phaleron To his lord's abode  He swiftly pass'd when chance his wond'ring eyes  On Aristides fix'd An open space  Reveal'd the hero issuing sage commands  Th' omnipotent artificer of worlds  From chaos seem'd with delegated pow'r  To have entrusted that selected man  From ashes lo a city new ascends  One winter's indefatigable toil  Of citizens whose spirit unsubdu'd  Subdues calamity Each visage wears  A cheerful hue yet solemn Through the streets  Successive numbers from adjacent fields  Drive odorif'rous loads of plants and flow'rs  Which please the manes Amaranth and rose  Fresh parsley myrtle and whate'er the sun  Now not remote from Aries in his course  Call'd from the quick and vegetating womb  Of nature green or florid from their seats  Of growth are borne for pious hands to weave  In fun'ral chaplets From the Grecian states  To honour Athens their deputed chiefs  Cleander foremost throng the public place  Whence Aristides with advancing speed  Salutes Sicinus Welcome is thy face  Good man thou know'st from Athens long estrang'd  Now doubly welcome In thy looks I read  Important news Retiring from the crowd  Swift in discourse but full Sicinus ran  Through all the feries of his lord's exploits  Which drew this question Has thy patron ought  To ask of Aristides Silent bow'd  Sicinus Smiling then the chief pursu'd  Do thou attend the ceremonial pomp  Of obsequies to morrow when the slain  At Salamis receive their just reward  From us survivors by their glorious fall  I have detain'd thee from Timothea long  The first entitled to thy grateful news  Now to that matron whom beyond himself  He priz'd Sicinus hastens At her loom  He finds her placid o'er a web whose glow  Of colours rivall'd Iris where intent  She wove th' atchievements of her lord Her skill  Had just portray'd Sandauce in the arms  Of Artamanes when her children's doom  Congeal'd her breast Themistocles in look  Expresses all that subtlety humane  Which cozen'd superstition of her prey  His godlike figure dignifies the work  Two boys two lovely little maids surround  Th' illustrious artist while their eyes pursue  Their mother's flying fingers in delight  Attentive But their tutor once in view  From absence long regretted light with joy  To him they bound Sicinus melts in tears  Of soft affection They around him lift  Their gratulating voices on his neck  Cling and contend for kisses from those lips  Approv'd in kindness as a flutt'ring brood  With chirping fondness nature's sweetest note  Inclose their feather'd parent who attunes  Her tender pipe and spreads endearing plumes  Sicinus cries Timothea thou dost bring  Auspicious tidings from my hero I  Expect no less Unaided by the state  A private man like Hercules he went  In his own pow'rs confiding and secure  Sit down thou witness of my husband's worth  Thyself a proof of his discerning choice  In thee good man by me and mine rever'd  Discreet and faithful No Sicinus spake  Thou art that proof most faithful most discreet  Most excellent of women Come she said  Suppress my praises let me hear of none  But his and copious let thy story flow  Glad through his whole heroic theme the sage  By time to Attic eloquence inur'd  Expatiates large where loftiness of plan  Sustain'd by counsel with exhaustless art  Pursu'd now brought to valour's final proof  Must end in sure success His lord's commands  Observing strict Acanthè's precious worth  In talents form and manners he describes  How she the aid of Chalcis had procur'd  Her favour how Themistocles had won  If he pursue to victory his plan  Timothea said and borrow from her hand  The means of glory and the gen'ral good  Tell him that I can imitate with joy  Andromachè who foster'd on her breast  Her Hector's offspring by a stol'n embrace  Not such thy lot sole mistress of a form  Match'd by perfection of the mind alone  Sicinus cheerful answer'd I attest  To this my firm belief th' allruling sire  Let Horomazes be his name or Jove  Thou giv'st me transportThou hast leave to smile  My good Sicinus she repliesBut heav'n  I too attest that transport I conceive  Less for my own than fair Acanthè's sake  So amiably endow'd so clear in fame  Her purity resigning she alas  Had prov'd the only suff'rer Woman fall'n  The more illustrious once the more disgrac'd  Ne'er can resume her lustre Laurels hide  A hero's wanton lapse The Greeks would bless  The guile which serves them but to endless shame  The gen'rous auth'ress of that service doom  Thou said'st my husband from Cleander's sword  Solicits help Cleander is my guest  With Ariphilia ready in this port  His squadron lies he plough'd the seas in quest  Of earliest action for the common cause  Come they are waiting for the night's repast  She rose Sicinus follow'd and renew'd  In Ariphilia's and Cleander's ear  The wondrous narrative but cautious veils  Acanthè's love Timothea's looks approv'd  He then concluded Thus to battle rous'd  The force of half Euboea cas'd in steel  Against the tyrant Demonax I left  But in the chace of that devouring wolf  On thee relies Themistocles for help  Undaunted chief of Troezen He replies  Should I withhold it by th' immortal gods  The titles both of soldier and of friend  Were mine no longer Ariphilia then  Sweet as a vernal flow'r in early prime  A Grace in manner Hebè in her form  Say gentle sage of Delphi's rev'rend priest  Of Haliartus and Oïleus' son  Kind guests of mine no tidings dost thou bear  He answers Them in Atalantè's isle  The turbulent Euripus yet confines  They soon fair matron to thy lord and mine  Will add their strength and level from its base  The tyrant's hold Amid this converse sweet  The warriorpoet Aeschylus appears  A grateful visitant to all He spake  Fair dame admit me introducing men  Who saw thy gallant consort yester morn  Erecting trophies men themselves renown'd  Oïlean Medon and Apollo's priest  Long lost whom I unknowing of their fate  Have clasp'd in transport as Laertes' son  When he review'd his metamorphos'd friends  In Circe's island to their pristine forms  Uprising by her charms Timothea glad  Salutes the ent'ring heroes Medon known  Before Leonteus Delphi's holy seer  With Artemisia's brother strangers all  But of deportment to command regard  Then spake the Locrian First of matrons hail  On Salaminian sands we parted last  I have been long in Atalantè's isle  Sequester'd but determin'd to attend  The fun'ral honours which the morning pays  To brave Athenians slain an hour serene  To cross the strait Euripus I embrac'd  For Chalcis There thy consort fresh I found  In gather'd palms from Demonax o'erthrown  That day in battle Hear the glorious tale  Which from Themistocles himself I learn'd  He wellinform'd the chiefs in either host  Distinctly told their history their names  Their birth and deeds on Hyacinthus most  As most esteem'd enlarg'd That hapless youth  Was husband to Cleora daughter she  Of Demonax was poison'd by her sire  Survey this tablet which before my sight  Thy hero took with readiness of skill  Delineating the fight Shew this he said  To my Timothea friendly thou explain  This part is Chalcis this a champaign wide  Here flows the sea there winds a quarry dark  Conceive a river by impetuous floods  O'erswol'n and spread irregular and wild  Beyond its bounds tumultuous thus the foes  At first appear'd Expecting to surprise  Themselves surpris'd at unexpected bands  Through open'd portals issuing to the plain  Are forc'd dishearten'd by a toilsome march  To range their numbers for immediate fight  The wary son of Neocles suspends  Th' attack till bursting drifts of southern clouds  Beat on the faces of his harrass'd foes  A storm of blinding sleet then rushes down  In three deep columns Of th' Orēan line  The right which Mindarus conducting wheels  Along the sea's flat margin sore is gall'd  By unremitted show'rs from bows and slings  On wellrang'd vessels Lamachus commands  The left Nearchus from the quarry pours  An ambush'd force and breaks the hostile flank  Compact of vet'rans cull'd from ev'ry state  That wedge of war whose bristly front display'd  Athenian spears and Spartan mingling beams  Themistocles the leader slow but sure  Bears down the center At a second breach  The line gives way to Cleon at a third  To swift Carystians Not a life is spar'd  By wrong'd incens'd Eretrians not a life  By Hyacinthus boiling with revenge  For his Cleora while her cruel sire  Exerts a desp'rate valour to revive  Hope in an army spiritless by toil  By sudden onset broken at the name  And sight of thy Themistocles abash'd  The rout is gen'ral In the bloody chace  Five thousand slain the conquerors despoil  Thy husband prudent in success preserves  Two thousand heads all Persian to redeem  Eretrian captives from the tyrant's bonds  He thus defeated not subdu'd retir'd  To Oreus Pow'rful remnants of his host  He draws within her circuit furnish'd well  From boundless treasure threatens there to hold  A firm defence till summon'd by the spring  Mardonius quit Thessalia and employ  The whole confederated pow'r of Greece  That threat Themistocles will render vain  Exults Timothea he unfinish'd leaves  No toil begun Again the Locrian chief  Now my first duty is discharg'd the next  To Ariphilia from her guest is due  O soft in virtue elegantly fair  Cleander's favour'd paranymph retains  Thy hospitable kindness ever dear  Thine too my gallant host by Neptune bless'd  In his own priestess and with brightest fame  On his own floods adorn'd The pleasing hours  All spend in mutual gratulation sweet  Till for the morn's solemnity they part  Below th' Aegalean mountain where the king  Of humbled Asia on his golden throne  Was seated late spectator of his shame  At Salamis a level space extends  To Neptune's border Green Psittalia there  Full opposite exhibits high and large  A new erected trophy Twenty masts  Appear the tallest of Phoenician pines  In circular position Round their base  Are massive anchors rudders yards and oars  Irregularly pil'd with beaks of brass  And naval sculpture from Barbarian sterns  Stupendous by confusion Crested helms  Above bright mail habergeons scal'd in gold  And figur'd shields along the spiry wood  Up to th' aerial heads in order wind  Tremendous emblems of gigantic Mars  Spears bristling through the intervals uprear  Their points obliquely gilded staves project  Embroider'd colours darts and arrows hang  In glitt'ring clusters On the topmost height  Th' imperial standard broad from Asia won  Blaz'd in the sun and floated in the wind  Of smooth Pentelic marble on the beach  Where flow'd the brine of Salamis a tomb  Insculptur'd rose Achievements of that day  When Asia's navy fell in swelling forms  Fill'd on three sides the monument The fourth  Unfinish'd open'd to th' interior grave  Now through Minerva's populace who kept  Religious silence first whitevested maids  Who from the strand of Salamis had seen  The patriots slain their sepulchre approach  With wreaths

Aristides mounts  Near him on ev'ry side are seats assign'd  To strangers held in honour Medon there  Leonteus Timon and the brother known  Of Caria's queen Cleander numbers more  From states ennobled in their names are seen  The godlike man uprises on the tomb  His eyes he fixes first their lustre mild  He then diffuses o'er th' assembly vast  Where not a tongue is heard nor gesture seen  So through unclouded skies the argent lamp  Of Dian visits with her light benign  A surface broad of water where no breeze  Excites a swell nor sighs among the reeds  Your fathers wise and lib'ral he

hath profan'd your ancestors in dust  Lo on a cross Leonidas affix'd  His patriot bones expos'd to bleaching winds  By that Barbarian Xerxes Kings alone  Obtuse of mind illiberal the brutes  Of human

Nicanor staid  Who unoppos'd the strong defile secur'd  There shall my banner strengthen'd by the youth  Of Aegae soon be planted there shall wait  Till each auxiliar thou hast nam'd arrive  Then pour on Demonax the storm of war  Let Troezen's squadron and th' Athenian ride  Before his port Cleander have the charge  Speed back to Chalcis publish these resolves  They part Not long Themistocles delay'd  To gain the mountains nor three days were pass'd  When brave Nearchus Haliartus bold  Th' illustrious brothers of Oïlean race  Great Aeschylus and Timon with their bands  Arriv'd and join'd him at the strong defile  Which now contain'd his whole collected force  Thence he descended on a morning fair  First of that month which frequent sees the sun  Through vernal show'rs distill'd from tepid clouds  Diffuse prolific beams o'er moisten'd earth  To dress her lap exuberant and fresh  With flow'rs and verdure Terrible the bands  Succeeding bands expatiate o'er the fields  So when an earthquake rives a mountain's side  Where stagnant water gather'd and confin'd  Within a deep vacuity of rock  For centuries hath slept releas'd the floods  In roaring cataracts impetuous fall  They roll before them shepherds and their flocks  Herds and their keepers cottage fold and stall  Promiscuous ruins floating on the stream  Are borne to plains remote Now Oreus lifts  Her stately tow'rs in

Athenian veterans he form'd  A square battalion which the martial bard  Rang'd on the seabeat verge the other wing  Is Medon's charge where thirty shields in file  Compose the Locrian column Ere the word  Is giv'n for onset thus his wonted guard  Themistocles addresses If a troop  In sable cuirass and with shields impress'd  By death's grim figure at my head should aim  Let them assail me be it then your care  Postponing other duty to surround  To seize and bear them captives from the fight  He march'd himself the cent'ral phalanx led  The floating crimson of his plumage known  Minerva's bird his crest whose terrors shook  The bloody field of Chalcis soon proclaim  Themistocles Now targets clash with shields  Barbarian sabres with Cecropian swords  Euboean spears with spears in sudden shock  Bellona mingles Medon first o'erthrew  Thessalia's line his temp'rate mind was stung  By indignation Timon bath'd his lance  In their perfidious blood Leonteus gor'd  Their dissipated ranks A chosen troop  To their assistance Lamachus advanc'd  Him Haliartus met his sinewy arm  Which could have quell'd Lycaon first of wolves  The Erymanthian or Aetolian boar  Smote to the ground the

o'erturn'd  The other Mindarus in vain oppos'd  Undaunted efforts Pallas seem'd to fire  Her own Athenians Neptune in the shape  Of Aeschylus seem'd landed from his conch  To war as once on Troy's Sigaean strand  Or to have arm'd the warriorpoet's grasp  With that strong weapon which can rock the earth  Not in the center suddenly prevail'd  Themistocles the sev'n Geraestians leagu'd  By hell combining their assassin points  Against the hero for a while delay'd  His progress firmly their united blows  His shield receiv'd So Hercules endur'd  The sev'nfold stroke of Hydra but the zeal  Of Iolaüs to assist that god  In his tremendous labour was surpass'd  By each Athenian each Laconian guard  Who never left Themistocles They watch'd  The fav'ring moment with a hundred spears  They hedg'd the traitors round forbade escape  Clasp'd and convey'd them living from the field  Still Demonax resists while near him tow'rs  Ariobarzanes moving rock of war  In weight and stature Of Euboeans forc'd  By savage pow'r to battle numbers low'r  Surrend'ring banners some to Cleon some  To humble Styra's wellconducted sword  And thine sad youth a while by glory taught  To strive with anguish and suspend despair  Cleora's husband Mindarus appears  Who warns the tyrant timely to retreat  Ere quite envelop'd by the wheeling files  Of Aeschylus and Medon Lo in front  More dang'rous still amid selected ranks  Themistocles The monster gnash'd his teeth  His impious voice with execrations hoarse  Assail'd the heav'nly thrones his buckler firm  He grasp'd receding to th' Orēan wall  Where under vaulted sheets of missive arms  Whirl'd on his fierce pursuers through the gates  He rush'd to shelter Thus a mighty boar  Of Calydonian strength long held at bay  The hunter's point evading and the fangs  Of staunchest hounds with undiminish'd ire  Red in his eyes and foaming from his jaws  Impetuous plunges in accustom'd woods  Th' Athenian chief who sees th' incessant storms  Of darts and arrows from the rampart's height  Retreats but swift his numbers now enlarg'd  By yielding thousands of Euboean race  Distributes round th' invested town to guard  Each avenue and station From the sea  Cleander threatens In his evening tent  The gen'ral views the captives frowns condemn  The sev'n Geraestians to their former chains  The hero smiles on Lamachus the prize  Of Haliartus and familiar thus  Again my Tyrian trafficker in slaves  I greet thee Son of Lygdamis what praise  To thy distinguish'd efforts is not due  This precious head to my disposal yield  He then proceeds to Lamachus apart  Now take thy freedom villain to my use  See thou employ it else expect to die  Your land remember and your sea are mine  Soon on the head of Demonax this arm  Shall dash yon bulwarks what I speak is fate  Thou hast thy option go Sicinus hear  This man is free conduct him through the camp  Now from his friends sequester'd on a couch  Which never care disturbs he slept till dawn  When rous'd by heralds from the town again  The leaders he conven'd Before them came  Arbactus fierce Barbarian who began  Themistocles of Athens in the name  Of Mindarus the Persian I defy  Thy arm to combat in the listed field  The same defiance to thy boldest chiefs  Ariobarzanes sends If you prevail  The royal host shall quit Euboea's isle  Which shall submit to Xerxes if you fall  Up Hyacinthus Haliartus start  Indignant First the young Carystian spake  Are they so gross in ignorance to hope  Themistocles will stoop to single fight  With twiceo'erthrown Barbarians who unsafe  Behind a rampart tremble at his pow'r  But if the Persian Mindarus would try  A Grecian's single valour O permit  Themistocles thy soldier to assert  The Grecian fame The friend of Medon next  The same permission I implore O chief  Invincible thyself that all this host  May witness my fidelity to Greece  Themistocles subjoins Barbarian go  Provide thy champions ours thou seest prepar'd  For honour not decision of the doom  Reserv'd for Demonax whose final lot  Lies in my breast alone The herald back  To Oreus speeds The prudent chief pursues  My Hyacinthus all thy wrongs I feel  But if resentment can afford the grace  I ask thee lend to policy thy arm  Take Mindarus thy captive From thy proofs  Of might and firmness Haliartus brave  My wish is lifted high in hope to see  Ariobarzanes gasping at thy feet  He rises Straight embattled on the plain  His army shews a formidable gleam  To Demonax Still num'rous for defence  Barbarian warriors and Thessalian throng  The battlements of Oreus Through the gates  In solemn pace and slow a herald train  Precede their champions Heralds from the camp  Produce th' illustrious Haliartus clad  In richest arms the gift of Caria's queen  A twig of flend'rest laurel twisted round  A shepherd's crook in portraiture adorn'd  His modest buckler Grim his foe advanc'd  In mail bloodcolour'd with a targe of gold  Ariobarzanes Hyacinthus next  Appears in tried habiliments of war  Which on his dearest patron Mars had seen  In Marathonian fields A plumage black  Denoting grief he carries on his shield  A female image and the form of Death  Who blasts her graces Mindarus approach'd  In armour studded bright with orient gems  His buckler too a shape of beauty pale  Stretch'd on a fun'ral pyre exhibits sad  Of pearl her limbs of rubies were the flames  Ere they engage the Persian warrior thus  Since my encounter whether through disdain  Or policy I know not is refus'd  By your commander not through fear I know  Do thou in courtesy disclose thy name  Thy rank in Grecian armies May'st thou prove  In lustre such as Mindarus would chuse  To be th' opponent of a satrap's arm  Then tremble satrap at my name the name  Of Hyacinthus fierce the youth returns  Cleora's husband whom thy barb'rous love  Hath wrong'd whom hellborn Demonax hath damn'd  To everduring torment shakes this lance  By vengeance pointed and invet'rate hate  Young man rejoins the Persian on thy grief  I drop a pitying tear while thou dost wrong  Me clear of wrong to thee No barb'rous love  Was mine unconscious of your nuptial tie  Till she confess'd it to her savage sire  My flame was holy not a thought impure  To violate a right could taint my breast  But that I lov'd her Hyacinthus sure  He who her dear perfections knew so well  Must wave his wonder that her fate o'erwhelms  My spirit never to revive I feel  That my disastrous passion caus'd her doom  Blame both our fortunes not my guiltless heart  If yet thy anguish can a moment look  Compassionate on mebut I forgive  Unjust reproaches from a grief like thine  Which should which must exceed my own my own  Exceeding after thine all other woe  Now Hyacinthus melted but observ'd  That during this sad interview the spear  Of Haliartus at his feet had laid  Ariobarzanes dead Heartstung by shame  At his inaction with so many chiefs  With such an army and the godlike son  Of Neocles spectators he begins  The fight but recollects that friend's request  The Persian more effeminate desponds  At past defeats and present grief renew'd  Whose weight though lighter he less firmly bore  Than did the hardy Greek his heavier share  Of woe Yet fearless he maintains the strife  With native force devoid of gymnic skill  In which confiding Hyacinthus oft  Inverts his spear and levels bloodless strokes  Still vigilant to ward the hostile point  Oft o'er his buckler glancing though impell'd  By active strength At last a pond'rous blow  Full on the Persian's front descends a groan  Is heard throughout the rampart as he falls  The groan redoubles as the victor bears  That leader captive to th' investing camp  To his own tent Themistocles admits  The Persian's batter'd but unwounded limbs  He praises Hyacinthus he consoles  The noble foe commends to healing rest  And at returning morn salutes him thus  If thee unransom'd Mindarus I send  To Oreus canst thou pity her estate  Curs'd in a monster Canst thou feel the wound  Of thy own glory longer to support  The worst of men excluded by his crimes  From heav'n's protection and the laws of faith  Wilt thou to spare whole rivulets of blood  Greek and Barbarian render to my arms  The town and thus procure thyself a name  To live for ever by a righteous act  Delighting gods and mortals Thee my ships  Shall land in safety on thy native shore  The king will praise thee for his army sav'd  Which shall partake my clemency Reject  All hope good Persian to withstand my arm  I am Themistocles The satrap starts  From languor thus Athenian I confess  Thy greatness thy ascendency have felt  But will endure whate'er a victor's pow'r  Inflicts on captives rather than pollute  My loyal faith to Xerxes from my king  I took my charge and never will betray  The crimes of Demonax I know myself  Have prov'd their horrors in Cleora's fate  I lov'd ador'd her excellence her thread  His impious rage dissever'd on her tomb  My tears have daily flow'd Retain me still  Thy captive never to revisit more  Her father's hateful mansion Heav'n permit  By thy vindictive arm but heav'n forbid  That ever by disloyalty of mine  Th' infernal author of her death may fall  The barbarism of loyalty which binds  Men to a monarch but the monarch leaves  Free to his lusts his cruelty and rage  Th' enlighten'd Greek despis'd yet now deplor'd  In one by nature gifted to deserve  A better lot from heav'n Not less aware  Of democratic jealousy which hurls  From fortune's summit heroes to the dust  He press'd no further cautious not to wound  A gallant mind whose friendship won he meant  To use in wants such fortune might create  He leaves Sicinus near him while his care  Exhausts the light in traversing the camp  To view the works His evening orders hold  Each band in arms while anxious in his tent  He sits deepmusing whether to attempt  The town that night by storm or patient wait  For some event less bloody casual boon  Of time and fortune Wasteful is delay  But precious too his soldiers such brave lives  The full completion of his vast design  Requires Thus dubious till the second watch  Throughout the camp is toll'd and clouded heav'n  Drops down her sable veil he sits when lo  Before him stands his monitor unknown  The venerable figure which he saw  At Aegae Staid Sicinus is the guide  Who swift retires but watches faithful nigh  Themistocles the stranger solemn spake  Thee I have trusted thou hast trusted me  Nor either hath repented Who I am  Now learn By friendship's sacred ties by blood  To thy best friend Eudora I am bound  Elephenor am call'd pontific seer  Of Jupiter in Oreus Timely warn'd  By her most urgent mandate to repose  All confidence in thee and lend my aid  Nor less admonish'd by Tisander sage  I help'd thee first with counsel now I bring  Effectual succour Demonax though foil'd  Hath still a pow'rful remnant of his host  To man his walls and desp'rate will defend  Select two thousand spears avoid delay  A secret passage known to holy steps  Alone o'er town and tyrant will complete  Thy bloodless conquest Swift the Attic chief  O father sacred in my ear the sound  Of good Tisander's great Eudora's names  Thy former warnings I have prov'd sincere  To merit gratitude and trust He calls  Sicinus bids him summon all the chiefs  Of Locris and Carystus they appear  To Hyacinthus and Nicanor then  Themistocles Attend with all your bands  This rev'rend guide intelligence transmit  As you advance His orders are perform'd  Next he exhorts th' Oilean brethren thus  Nor passes favour'd Haliartus by  You with your Locrians follow to support  These friends lest ambush and deception lurk  Beneath a promise of assur'd success  This said himself forth issues to prepare  The gen'ral host for action ev'n that night  If fair occasion summons when he meets  Troezene's leader Is Cleander here  Themistocles began Momentous sure  The cause which sends thee from thy naval charge  To him Cleander Anchor'd as I lay  A slender skiff when darkness first prevail'd  Approach'd my galley To an earnest suit  For conference I listen'd and receiv'd  On board a man of Oreus all in limbs  Deform'd in lineaments all rude whose name  Is Lamachus To render up this night  A sep'rate fort he proffers which commands  The town and harbour if thy faith be pledg'd  Him and Thessalia's garrison to land  Safe on her neighb'ring coast Thy will to learn  I come he waits His proffer I accept  Rejoins th' alert Athenian and the doom  I had prepar'd for those degen'rate Greeks  Postpone Cleander to his station flies  Serene th' Athenian in array contains  His army cool with expectation mute  So in deceitful quiet oft the main  Before the glazing light of Dian spreads  A mirrour smooth the ruler of the winds  Anon from troubled clouds and ocean's god  From his tempestuous chariot give the sign  For wild commotion then the surging brine  Assails the loftiest tops of reeling masts  Foams on the rocks and deluges the beach  End of the Eighteenth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the NINETEENTH  THE morning breaks Nicanor sudden greets  The gen'ral welcome tidings in these words  He utters loud The citadel is won  The tyrant slaughter'd With our sacred guide  A rugged winding track in brambles hid  Half up a crag we climb'd there stooping low  A narrow cleft we enter'd mazy still  We trod through dusky bowels of a rock  While our conductor gather'd as he stepp'd  A clue which careful in his hand he coil'd  Our spears we trail'd each soldier held the skirt  Of his preceding comrade We attain'd  An iron wicket where the ending line  Was fasten'd thence a long and steep ascent  Was hewn in steps suspended on the sides  Bright rows of tapers cheer'd our eyes with light  We reach'd the top there lifting o'er his head  A staff against two horizontal valves  Our leader smote which open'd at the sound  Behind me Hyacinthus on the rock  Sunk sudden down pronouncing in his fall  Cleora I on Hyacinthus call'd  Is this Cleora's husband cried the priest  Descend my Pamphila my wife descend  She came a rev'rend priestess tender both  With me assisting plac'd my speechless friend  Within a cleft by me unmark'd before  Which seem'd a passage to some devious cell  Me by the hand Elephenor remov'd  Precipitate a grating door of brass  Clos'd on my parting steps Ascend he said  Make no enquiry but remain assur'd  His absence now is best I mount I rise  Behind a massy basis which upheld  Jove grasping thunder and Saturnia crown'd  Who at his side outstretch'd her scepter'd hand  The troops succeeding fill the spacious dome  Last unexpected thence more welcome rose  Detach'd from Medon with five hundred spears  Brave Haliartus who repair'd the want  Of my disabled colleague Now the priest  Ye chiefs auxiliar to the gods profan'd  And men oppress'd securely you have reach'd  The citadel of Oreus The dark hour  Befriends your high attempt Let one possess  The only entrance from the town below  The other swift the palace must surprise  Where Demonax lies slumb'ring if his guilt  Admits of rest and dreams not of your spears  With small resistance from a drowsy guard  I seiz'd the gate the palace soon was forc'd  By Haliartus Demonax maintain'd  From door to door fierce combat till he sunk  Blaspheming ev'ry pow'r of heav'n and hell  On his own couch beneath repeated wounds  Delv'd in his body by the Carian sword  Whose point produc'd the sever'd head in view  These news Sicinus to Eudora bear  Themistocles began Before her feet  Fall grateful kiss for me her hallow'd robe  My venerable friend Tisander hail  To her to him this victory we owe  Salute Timoxenus my noble host  Greet his excelling daughter let them hear  Of brave Nicanor and the Carian sword  Which closing at a blow this dang'rous war  Preserves so many Greeks Carystian chief  Accept from me good tidings in return  For thine Intelligence this hour hath brought  That vigilant Cleander hath possess'd  The naval fort an inlet to the town  For this whole army pouring from our ships  Successive numbers if the Persian bands  Yet meditate resistance Not to give  Their consternation leisure to subside  Against the walls each standard shall advance  He said and gave command The diff'rent chiefs  Head their battalions Oreus trembling sees  Encircling danger heralds in their pomp  Dread summoners are nigh Her foreign guard  Depriv'd of wonted leaders at the fall  Of Demonax aghast in thought behold  Death in the conquer'd citadel extend  His hideous arms to beckon from the fleet  Cleander's valour and from swarming tents  Themistocles On his approach the gates  Are thrown abroad From all the Persian bands  Their javelins shields and banners on the ground  Pale fear deposits Thus the yielding masts  Of all their canvass mariners divest  When Aeolus is riding on a storm  To overwhelm the vessel which would drive  In full apparel to resist his ire  Th' Athenian though triumphant in his joy  Omits no care To Aeschylus awhile  The charge supreme transferring he ascends  The citadel the Carian victor there  Conducts him o'er the palace shews the corse  Of Demonax his treasury unspoil'd  By chosen Locrians guarded Pleas'd the chief  Embraces Haliartus Friend he said  Though late acquir'd inestimable friend  How shall I praise thee but my bosom wrapt  In long concealment now to thee alone  Disclos'd shall warrant my profess'd regard  Know that whatever thou hast heard or seen  Of my Euboean labours are no more  Than preparation for a wider stage  Of action Gold one necessary means  Thou hast provided but I want a man  Of hardy limbs and vig'rous bold discreet  Who all the Persian quarters would explore  On either side Thermopylae would trace  Whate'er employs Mardonius what the time  He takes the field and where his gather'd stores  Of war deposits Thessaly provok'd  Long since my just resentment Ere the king  Of Asia pass'd the Hellespont I led  Ten thousand Greeks her passes to defend  By her deserted and betray'd I march'd  Unprofitably back The Carian here  Had I endowments equal to my will  I were that man Accept me as I am  Vers'd in those borders me whose faithful zeal  Leonidas experienc'd and approv'd  So let Themistocles My rustic weeds  I can resume to range th' Oetaean crags  The fields of Locris and Thessalia's plains  Thou art that man th' Athenian quick rejoin'd  Then hold thee ready Sudden in their birth  Are my resolves and when mature have wings  This said he visits Aeschylus below  Judicious he in stations had dispos'd  The various bands the pris'ners were secur'd  Throughout th' Orēan streets and dwellings reign'd  Tranquillity and order Him the son  Of Neocles bespake Tomorrow's dawn  Shall see thee honour'd as becomes a chief  Whom Aristides nam'd and Athens chose  To save Euboea I defer till night  Our consultations I not wanted here  Will reascend the citadel the voice  Of friendship calls me to a tender care  He seeks the fane Elephenor he greets  Applause to him in gratitude unfeign'd  Presenting next his earnest lips enquire  Of Hyacinthus Here the rev'rend man  First know his dear Cleora is alive  I priest of Jove and Pamphila my wife  Who to th' Olympian empress in this seat  Of blended rites are ministers when told  That Demonax had doom'd his child to death  Solicited her pardon in the names  Of both divinities At both he spurn'd  While we contriv'd this stratagem Her nurse  By us admonish'd in due time declar'd  Cleora dead The body of a slave  A youthful maiden recently expir'd  Was for Cleora carried to the flames  While her we shelter'd in a secret cell  From human sight from sight of day conceal'd  These pow'rs alike offended at th' intent  As perpetration of an impious deed  Have sent thee forth their instrument of wrath  Divinelyprompted hero Wilt thou shed  On Hyacinthus and Cleora's bliss  Thy guardian smile This utter'd down the steps  He guides th' Athenian to the hidden cell  By his Cleora Hyacinthus sat  The youthful husband o'er the snowy breast  Which lull'd and cherish'd a reposing babe  The blooming father o'er that precious fruit  Hung fondly Thoughtful ecstasy recall'd  His dream at Juno's temple where he saw  The visionary bosom of his bride  Disclose maternal to an infant new  That pillow smooth of lillies Wan her cheek  Told her confinement from the cheerful day  Six moons in deep obscurity she dwelt  Where as a seanymph underneath a rock  Or Indian genie in the cavern'd earth  Her cell in conchs and coral she had dress'd  By gracious Pamphila supply'd to cheat  Time and despair The loom her patient art  Had plied her own sad story had begun  Now to conclude in joy The starting youth  Beholds his patron rushes on his breast  In transport thus Redeemer of my peace  Balm of my grief of happiness my source  My health of mind and body is thy gift  If in his anguish Hyacinthus felt  His obligation in the hour of bliss  To what excess must gratitude expand  His bosom now Cleora and my child  I owe to thy protectionthis is she  This is my goddess this my light my joy  Deriv'd from thy humanity Thou god  Of Hyacinthus tutelary god  Thou from the pit of horror didst upraise  My limbs for ever to its bottom chain'd  Without thy helpful hand without thee death  Had been my portion never had I liv'd  To see Cleora never known this day  But will my gen'ral overlook my fault  Thy soldier in his subterranean march  Tow'rds this retirement threw a casual glance  Which met Cleora's Down the shield and spear  Dropp'd from my hands disabled life forsook  My heart which irrecoverably lost  All sense of duty both to thee and Greece  By me alone deserted Bless that chance  Themistocles replies and leads aside  Th' attentive youth Perhaps these gods ordain'd  In compensation of thy long distress  In recompense of pure and constant love  That to Cleora thou unstain'd with blood  Blood of her father by another slain  Shouldst be restor'd nor taint with horrors new  This thy new hymen Aeschylus by morn  Will sit in judgment righteous but severe  On each Euboean criminal the dead  Not less than living Instantly remove  To thy Carystian home thy wife and babe  Whate'er can pass in Oreus must offend  Her eye and ear Then turning to the fair  From warlike toils thy consort I dismiss  He who so nobly signaliz'd his sword  In single combat and the open field  And prov'd his valour equal to his love  All future palms to others may resign  Whatever comforts time and peace can yield  Are due to both your suff'rings nor an hour  Shalt thou be cloister'd in this rueful cell  Elephenor discreet and rev'rend man  Let thy kind clue conduct their secret steps  With presents laden tokens of my love  Cars shall attend them at the cavern's mouth  Thou add thy blessing that their newborn day  May never set in sorrow Thus the chief  Relax'd from busy care amid success  Which not a shade of obstacle o'erhangs  Spake as he felt remunerating full  For all his service Hyacinthus brave  His knees embracing thus Cleora spake  I have not utt'rance for my grateful heart  If thou dismiss us never more to see  Thy guardian face our day will set in grief  In smiles th' Athenian dissipates that fear  Long ere thy husband's magisterial term  Is finish'd I have further still to crave  From him as archon not as soldier help  This to Carystus would alone direct  My footsteps else amid domestic joys  To see thy days illumin'd precious time  Themistocles would borrow from his charge  Thus in the grateful fairone he secur'd  Another friend if wanted to support  His vast designs which gath'ring on his mind  Speed his departure with a kind farewell  The cars he orders from the tyrant's stores  Rich presents draws to Aeschylus returns  With him in conf'rence spends remaining day  Aurora hears Themistocles command  Stern proclamation by the trumpet's voice  For judgment on the guilty All in chains  The tyrant's hated counsellors are brought  Save Lamachus by faith of treaty safe  Bound to Thessalian shores but chief the sev'n  Geraestian ruffians their assassin heads  Hang hopeless down Amid the widest space  In Oreus lofty a tribunal stands  Which Aeschylus ascends commander high  Of troops enroll'd by Athens So her son  Disgrac'd but courting favour new devis'd  Her democratic jealousy to sooth  The various chieftains through this glorious war  So late distinguish'd round the solemn seat  Conspicuous wait Themistocles himself  At the right hand of Aeschylus He sits  Like Minos sage whose justice gain'd from Jove  Th' appointment awful to condemn or spare  His fellow mortals in the world below  When now th' accusers and accus'd were heard  Thus spake the warriorpoet Crimes like these  The legislator punishes with death  Let us attempt within our scanty sphere  Far as we may to imitate the gods  In punishment deserv'd Through those abodes  Which Hades governs long the vulture gnaws  Long is the toil of Sisyphus to fill  Their leaking vases long the murd'rous seed  Of Danaus must strive By labour pain  And shame continu'd let flagitious men  Long wish to end their suff'rings not enjoy  That wish'dfor period in a single pang  This heavy sentence on assassin heads  On foul atrocious counsellors of ill  Lo I pronounce An ignominious brand  Imprint on every forehead plunge them chain'd  Debas'd by vile impurity of garb  In deep Chalcidian quarries give them food  Just for endurance of continued toil  With daily stripes that cruelty may feel  What she inflicts on others and impell'd  By desperation court relief in death  Before the gate of Oreus on a cross  Extend the limbs of Demonax the flesh  Let kites deform let parching air the bones  Of that despotic malefactor bleach  Avenging man and vindicating heav'n  Flow next a strain more pleasing through the ear  A strain delightful to that fav'ring god  Who first created laurel to adorn  The good and brave A chaplet from his tree  Ten captives ten selected suits of arms  To ev'ry leader one Barbarian slave  A sabre targe whatever to the field  Accouters one Barbarian I allot  To ev'ry soldier Phoebus will supply  His laurel too encompassing your brows  Ye gen'rous people But a splendid store  Of tripods urns and images provide  For great Eudora and th' Eretrian seer  That your triumphal off'ring may emblaze  Euboea's fanes nor less with honours greet  Elephenor your genius of success  Eudora's portion thou heroic priest  Phoebean Timon to her presence bear  I need but name Acanthè to attract  Your veneration for Acanthè chuse  Sweet paragon of Chalcis from your spoils  The costly tissue of Barbaric looms  And dazzling gems that gratitude may vie  With obligation Haliartus bright  In recent glories from a tyrant slain  Thou at her feet the precious tribute lay  For me if servant of Cecropia's state  I have upheld her justice and renown  Your approbation is the sole reward  Which I solicit or will bear away  On my returning keel He ceas'd In roar  Surpassing waves which beat the craggy strand  Amidst a tempest from the gen'ral host  Broke forth applause The mistocles subjoin'd  Awhile my friends your labours I suspend  Go to your homes to kind expecting wives  Recount your trophies let your children see  Paternal mansions hung with Asian spoils  Remember still that valour must not sleep  That law restor'd and freedom are not firm  While Asia's trumpet sounds a blast in Greece  Two days elapse Timoxenus arriv'd  From Chalcis joyful gratulation brings  Solicitous th' Athenian first enquires  Of fair Acanthè's state The father fond  Thus answers Wasting malady is fled  But hath behind it left indiff'rence cold  To ev'ry joy Thy wife a bracelet sent  These words the bearer Hallartus brought  Charg'd by Timothea elegant and wise  "From me this present when Acanthè takes  "Say how I prize her elevated mind  "Enabling my Themistocles to quell  "The hateful breed of tyrants Further say  "The man engaging her connubial hand  "I should esteem the favorite of heav'n"  I heard approving on the grateful hint  A secret hour I chose my daughter's ear  I thus address'd "My only child and hope  "Shall no sweet offspring cheer a grandsire's age  "Shall my possessions to a stranger pass  "My blood be lost for ever Shall this war  "Thy work Acanthè which a father's love  "In all to thee complying at thy suit  "Commenc'd produce no here to console  "Thy widow'd couch" "The sacrifice of life  "Of my ideal or my real peace  "Is due to such a father" she exclaim'd  In pious fervour "Arguments to urge  "Against thy plea my age and thine forbid  "But ah dear parent my capricious fate  "Presents no suitor to thy child's esteem"  The Amarynthian priestess whose controul  Surpasses mine with sternness oft enforc'd  My just desire At length my daughter thus  On my departure "I obey consult  "Themistocles let him a consort name  "Who best hath serv'd him in this righteous war"  Ne'er yet ill chance or sorrow from the son  Of Neocles drew tears His soul reflects  On this transcendent fair one who had chang'd  The violence of passion to respect  So confidential dress'd in sweetest grace  So far beyond his merits tow'rds a heart  Of purest texture late by him misled  To error now to purity restor'd  By native honour At th' affecting thought  He turns those eyes till then of stedfast look  On all events and objects turns aside  To hide their oozing dews yet soon he spake  None can I name but wise Timothea's choice  To bear her present Haliartus brave  Who hath avow'd to Aeschylus and me  A veneration for thy matchless child  But he appointed to a service high  Like Hercules must labour yet to gain  The sum of bliss For three successive moons  He must continue mine The past events  In copious strains the hero now rehears'd  Concluding thus The army I disband  Great Aeschylus for Athens straight embarks  I shall remain in Oreus to compose  This troubled city thou resume thy way  The criminals transported in thy train  Lock in the quarries to Acanthè all  Unravel her and Chalcis too prepare  For due reception of that happy man  Whom Jove hath honour'd in a tyrant's death  Whom Juno soon in nuptial ties will bless  And all Euboea to Acanthè sends  With tokens rich of public praise and love  With joy Timoxenus assents the morn  Sees him depart at Chalcis he arrives  Performing all Themistocles enjoin'd  Now ev'ry temple breathes perfumes prepar'd  Are chosen victims colonnades and gates  With chaplets hung the garden's flow'ry growth  Each scented produce of luxuriant fields  The maids and matrons bear to welcome home  Triumphant warriors Now th' expected gleams  Of armour tinge the champaign's utmost verge  Near and more near the military pomp  At large develop'd o'er the green expanse  Spears bucklers helmets plumes Barbaric spoils  In trophies pil'd on hollowsounding cars  Grow on the sight Through Chalcis lies the march  Those in abode the most remote precede  Geraestian banners first Eudemus shews  With Lampon follow Styra's gallant troop  The Amarynthian and Carystian bands  Nicanor leads th' Eretrians now become  Once more a people with their wives and race  At length redeem'd to Cleon's orders move  In blooming garlands had the mothers deck'd  Their children's heads whom tripping through the streets  Spectatress equal to the loftiest scene  Eudora blesses Sweet Acanthè melts  In tears of gladness while her father nigh  Awakes attention to a num'rous train  Her native friends whom brave Nearchus heads  These are thy warriors fondly cries the sire  To whom Eudora Who is he in state  Pontifical a holy man in arms  Three hundred Delphians then were passing by  Phoebean branches twisted round their spears  Behind them lodg'd on axles rolling slow  Were vases tripods images and busts  Spoils of the palace Demonax had rais'd  Thou seest replies Timoxenus a form  To Phoebus dear the venerable form  Of Timon priest and soldier From that car  He will descend to kiss thy sacred hand  Before thy feet a precious tribute lay  For thy pure goddess sister of his god  But look my sweet Acanthè on the man  Themistocles hath chosen to revive  My drooping years Preceded by a troop  Of youths whom Medon ever kind hath cull'd  From all his Locrian files to grace his friend  Preceded by a trophy which displays  The silver mail of Demonax his shield  His helm of gold his variegated arms  And spear in length ten cubits which upholds  The tyrant's head his victor meets our eyes  Th' illustrious son of Lygdamis She cast  Not an impassion'd but revering glance  On one whose might victorious had dissolv'd  Euboean thraldom one of noble frame  In feature comely and in look serene  Whom her sole guide the all controlling son  Of Neocles had destin'd for her lord  Her dream recurs the tyrant's head she sees  Th' exploit sublime though not by him achiev'd  Whom partial fancy on her pillow shew'd  Her everwakeful loftiness of mind  Admires impartial and applauds the hand  Which dealt the glorious blow Her awful brow  The priestless softens to a smile and thus  Is this suitor whom my hero chose  For bright Acanthè Favour'd by the gods  Themistocles in ev'ry action proves  He cannot err Acanthè hears and press'd  By duty's insurmountable controul  Aw'd by Eudora's majesty austere  Resolves to meet him with becoming grace  But of his virtue make one trial more  The Delphian priest and Haliartus quit  Their chariots them Timoxenus receives  To his rich mansion and a sumptuous board  Eudora there with curious eyes and voice  Explores and questions oft the Carian brave  His Delphian friend observing in these words  Besought him O distinguish'd by the gods  Who have in thee their care of virtue shewn  Since from Euboea thou must soon depart  Lose not the present hour These matchless dames  Must hear thy wond'rous narrative at large  For singular thy fortunes with events  Are interwoven to delight the ear  Affect the heart and win th' applauding tongue  That all may honour thy desert supreme  Like me so much thy debtor Straight complies  The modest Carian list'ning silence reigns  In native windings from his Lydian fount  As various flow'd Maeander here along  A level champaign daisypainted meads  Or golden fields of Ceres here through woods  In green arcades projecting o'er his banks  There shut in rock which irritates the stream  Here by low hamlets there by stately towns  Till he attained the rich Magnesian seat  Thence with augmented fame and prouder floods  Roll'd down his plenteous tribute to the main  So through the mazes of his fortune winds  In artless eloquence th' expressive strain  Of Haliartus from his peasant state  To scenes heroic Humble still in mind  Compell'd to follow truth's historic clue  He ends in glory which his blushes grace  Nor less they grace these frank and manly words  Which to Acanthè singly he directs  Such as I am thou elevated fair  Who hast Euboea's liberty restor'd  Her grateful off'rings to thy feet I bring  With them an humble suppliant to thy smile  That he may rank thy soldier in thy name  His own distinguish and achieving well  The task by great Themistocles impos'd  Deserve Acanthè's favour She replies  With virtuous art Can soldiers never know  Satiety of fame must her career  Be still beginning never be complete  Must ev'ry passion yield to thirst of praise  Should I request thee wouldst thou for my sake  Thy new attempt relinquish to enjoy  Thy ample portion of acquir'd renown  In peace at Chalcis Haliartus then  Not love of fame which oft'ner frowns than smiles  Not victory nor spoil inflate my breast  All unaspiring Sense of duty pure  Of obligation which I owe to Greece  Themistocles and Medon rules supreme  Within my soul O first of mortal fair  Thou of his peace thy servant might'st deprive  But wert thou fairer than the Paphian queen  In each excelling art like Pallas skill'd  Her paragon in wisdom thy request  Should thus be answer'd from a bleeding heart  To my performance of the trust repos'd  The only bar is fate Astonish'd gaz'd  Timoxenus nor knew the timid sire  That his Acanthè's breast then first conceiv'd  A spark of passion but a spark divine  Such as for heroes goddesses have felt  As Thetis glow'd for Peleus Thus the fair  O most deserving of that hero's choice  To which alone Acanthè left her fate  Weigh'd in the balance nor deficient found  Thou more than worthy of a hand like mine  Go but return triumphantly return  Lord of Acanthè of my truth unchang'd  Accept this pledge She gave he kiss'd her hand  Eudora's vestment while the solemn scene  Her looks approv'd with fervent lips he touch'd  Then clasping glad Timoxenus retir'd  To hoist his canvass in the morning gale  End of the Nineteenth Book  THE ATHENAID  BOOK the TWENTIETH  AN April zephyr with reviving sweets  From gay Euboea's myrtleborder'd meads  Perfumes his breath scarce ruffling in his course  The pearly robe of morn A ready skiff  The Carian hero mounts the gale though soft  To him is adverse From a rapid keel  Of Oreus lo Sicinus lifts a sign  Of salutation Haliartus joins  The faithful man and joyfully relates  His acquisition of Acanthé's hand  To good Sicinus grateful sounds the tale  Who thus replies To Athens I proceed  No sooner march'd the warriors to their homes  Than disengag'd from public care my lord  Address'd me thus Sicinus spread the sail  To Athens fly my wife and offspring waft  To my embraces that while gentle rest  Remits the labours of my limbs disarm'd  I with Timothea she with me may share  The past success and taste of present joy  Thee Haliartus she esteems thy fame  Exploits and fortune will augment her bliss  But of this friendly gale a moment more  I must not lose His vessel sails along  The other slowly with laborious strokes  Of oars contends for passage till broad noon  Flames on the laurell'd poops and colours gay  Of Athens and Troezene on whose decks  Emblaz'd with spoils and trophies Phoebus pours  His whole effulgence Back to Attic strands  They steer in view To fifes and trumpets clear  From ev'ry vessel in a blended sound  Reply the concave shores Now sudden shifts  The wind and checks their progress but permits  Glad Haliartus close behind the helm  Of Aeschylus to pass The choral notes  Of triumph then were hush'd The warriorbard  Who had so well accomplish'd all his charge  Like Jove in judgment on the plain like Mars  Sat in oblivion of his arms which lay  Beside him O'er the Heliconian hill  In thought he wander'd and invok'd the Muse  To sing of civic harmony The Muse  To Aristides and the conqu'ring son  Of Neocles united touch'd the lyre  With melody rejoicing at their names  The Attic warriors throng'd the silent decks  The shrouds and yards Attention clos'd their lips  Their minds were open'd Musical and learn'd  Minerva's chosen people had been wont  To hear his numbers in the tragic scene  Sententious weight of poesy combin'd  With music's pow'rful spell there tam'd the rude  Abash'd the vicious and the good refin'd  Oh Artemisia Haliartus sigh'd  While at the strain his progress he delay'd  How canst thou splendid vassalage prefer  In barb'rous climes the residence of slaves  To Greece the land of freedom arts and arms  The legislator's and the hero's seat  The guardian pure of equity and laws  The nurse of orphans helpless and oppress'd  Of all whom Phoebus and the Muses lift  Above the rank of mortals Greece I owe  More than my birth and being to thy love  My sentiments I owe Adopted child  For thee my better parent now I go  To hazard all in voluntary zeal  Ev'n the possession of Acanthè's charms  On Atalantè's seabeat verge he lands  Swift he collects his peasant weeds the crook  The pipe and scrip thus musing Ancient garb  Thou dost remind me of Oïleus good  Dost summon all my gratitude to prove  That he who benefits receives and feels  A grateful sense is happy From his side  His arm and temples he ungirds the sword  The shield releases and unclasps the helm  These he commits Sophronia to thy care  Spouse of Leonteus mother of the race  Oïlean Them in tenderness embrac'd  He leaves with blessings reembarks and prints  His bounding feet on Locris Hermes thus  In shepherd's weeds his deity conceal'd  By Jove's appointment on the flow'ry meads  Of Inachus alighting where he stole  On watchful Argus and his hundred eyes  Eluding rescu'd from her bestial form  Afflicted Io Like the mountain roe  The son of Lygdamis in speed excell'd  He had he run for Atalanta's love  Would have rejected Cytherea's aid  Nor of her swiftness to beguile the fair  Before her steps the golden apples thrown  He quits the shore impatient on he flies  Unquestion'd rank'd among the Locrian hinds  All Persian subjects now A midnight course  To Oeta's wellknown mountains he prefers  Through winding vallies sprinkled with his tears  In memory of past events He finds  The track to Mycon's hut that goatherd hears  The sound of footsteps through the morning dew  He sees he flies to Meliboeus clings  Around his neck The seeming shepherd thus  Kind friend inform me of Melissa's weal  To him the swain In wonder thou wilt hear  That no Barbarian dares ascend this hill  Th' attempt with death Mardonius would chastise  Benign Masistius who his freedom gain'd  From gen'rous Medon to his sister thus  The benefit repays He often views  Thermopylae inspects th' obsequious band  Which guards the cavern'd passage to our fane  The fane he visits Pleas'd Melissa greets  The gentle Persian who delights to speak  Of Aristides righteous and humane  Of Medon's valour on Psittalia's isle  Who made Masistius captive Thus at times  The tedious winter's melancholy hours  She sooth'd depriv'd of thee superior swain  At times convers'd with Mycon She hath tun'd  My pipe to music purify'd my tongue  Refin'd its language and my soul enlarg'd  Despairing never of the public weal  To Aristides virtuous guardian pow'r  Of Greece she strikes her celebrating chords  So will she Mycon to the conqu'ring son  Of Neocles our second guardian pow'r  Cries Haliartus but too long I wait  To hail my holy mistress She rejoins  The swain hath left this mountain Forty days  Since I beheld Masistius are elaps'd  His welcome hand before Melissa plac'd  A woman rather deity in form  The hoary temple with her beauty seem'd  Illumin'd regal was her state her spouse  The youthful king of Macedon was by  She in Melissa's presence cast aside  Her majesty a suppliant in these words  Whose strong impression I retain she spake  "Most gracious learn'd and prudent of thy rank  "In Greece the highest I in Delphi born  "Phoebean Timon's child a pious suit  "Both in my father's and Apollo's name  "To thee prefer Trachiniae's neighb'ring walls  "Contain the object of my tend'rest care  "Sandaucè thither from Emathian bounds  "For help convey'd Masistius will confirm  "Whate'er I utter in Sandaucè's praise  "Her virtues more than equal her estate  "Of princess Xerxes' sister but her woes  "Almost exceed her virtues Nature droops  "Beneath its burden sickness wastes her youth  "Resists all med'cine while her feeble frame  "To dissolution verges O belov'd  "By ev'ry Muse illumining thy mind  "With ev'ry science holy woman fam'd  "Among these nations for benignant deeds  "Vouchsafe descending from thy pure abode  "To grant thy healing aid" Masistius then  "This is the princess who her husband saw  "Slain at her feet her infants doom'd to death  "By Euphrantides never since that day  "The wound inflicted on her gentle heart  "Admitted cure" The charitable suit  Prevail'd and soon Trachiniae's gates receiv'd  The priestess borne in Amarantha's car  Here Haliartus Hast thou never seen  Among the Persians who frequent this hill  A youth in rosy vigour by the name  Of Artamanes known I have returns  The goatherd he with Amarantha came  Seem'd doubly anxious for Melissa's help  To yon afflicted princess urg'd the suit  In Medon's name his friend and saviour styl'd  Who made him captive on Psittalia's shore  But on his cheek the roses thou dost paint  No longer bloom his visage worn and pale  Denotes some inward malady or grief  Now Meliboeus to my longing ear  Thy history unfold We parted last  Thou mayst remember on this fatal spot  The gentle Agis from this point survey'd  Yon froth of torrents in their stony beds  Yon shagged rocks and that disastrous pass  Beneath us whence Barbarian numbers huge  O'erwhelm'd Thermopylae But first accept  Refreshment Under hairy boughs of pines  A rustic board he piles with oaten loaves  Dry'd fruits and chestnuts bubbling nigh a spring  Supplies their bev'rage Here th' illustrious son  Of Lygdamis recounts a copious tale  To wond'ring Mycon but his birth conceals  And consanguinity with Caria's queen  He stops to note the narrow passage throng'd  With laden mules and camels Mycon then  These are my constant spectacle his host  Mardonius now assembles He transports  Alpenus yonder Locrian town receives  The gather'd produce of Thessalia's fields  Nicaea's fort contains an equal store  Preparatives for war Where lies the camp  The Carian questions On the Malian plain  Which Oeta's cliffs command the swain reply'd  New tents on clear Spercheos daily rise  Of Persians banded from their winter holds  Thou shalt behold them follow Both proceed  Along the green expanse Melissa lov'd  Where genial spring had form'd of tufted shrubs  A florid cincture to the lucid pool  Behind the dome inviolable seat  Of all the Muses Thence harmonious nymphs  Part of Melissa's ministerial choir  Left in their function with mellifluent voice  To harps in cadence true enchant the soul  Of Haliartus doubly charm'd to hear  Leonidas the theme With numbers sweet  His praise inwoven by Melissa's skill  Was their diurnal song But sorrow soon  Invades a breast where gratitude presides  The time and place to Haliartus rise  Where he and Medon took their last farewell  Of that devoted hero In a sigh  The Carian thus O wellremember'd scene  Once to these eyes delectable Thy flow'rs  Have lost their odour thy crystalline pool  Is dull in aspect to my sad'ning sight  You cannot sooth melodious maids the pain  Of recollection starting at the name  Your measures sound Beneath yon solemn beech  Regret sits weeping Lacedaemon's king  There of terrestrial music heard the last  From Aeschylus the last of banquets shar'd  With good Oïleus' daughter Mycon here  Suppress this grief the priestess has forbid  All lamentation for that hero's fate  Who died so glorious Follow to the cliff  They soon attain a high projecting point  When Haliartus in a second sigh  Here stood Melissa from her sacred lips  The queen of Caria hence endur'd reproof  Hence did the great Leonidas explore  Th' advancing Persians when his prudent care  The trees and marble fragments had amass'd  Which from the mountain overwhelm'd below  Such multitudes of foes But Mycon speak  What is that cross beside the public way  Ah Meliboeus let thy spirit grieve  Like mine exclaims in gushing tears the swain  Lo Xerxes' coward vengeance Thou behold'st  Leonidas suspended on that cross  As oft when lightning strikes the human frame  The wound though imperceptible destroys  Each vital pow'r throughout the stiff'ning limbs  Which still retain their posture rigid thus  Is Haliartus riveted to earth  He seems nor utters sound nor breathes nor moves  His ghastly eyeballs Now when Mycon thrice  His name repeated briefly he replies  I am benumb'dConduct me to a cell  Where I may slumberTend thy herdExpect  Me at thy home A mossy cave is nigh  There Mycon leaves him Haliartus stays  Not slumb'ring but when Mycon is remote  Darts from the shelter traverses a wood  Descends a crag which bounds the upper straits  Thence winds his rapid journey to the cross  Which stands a witness of Barbaric rage  His ardent zeal to free those honour'd bones  Admits no pause The midnight watch is past  Importunate and hateful birds obscene  Are gather'd round disturb'd their grating shrieks  They mix and clatter their illomen'd wings  A station'd guard is rous'd resistless force  Surrounds the Carian seizes leads him bound  Before the chieftain of a camp advanc'd  He at the sight of Haliartus charg'd  With guilt whose punishment is death commands  Th' accusing soldiers to retire and thus  Alas hath sorrow so impair'd the hue  Of Artamanes that oblivion masks  His face from Haliartus Thee I know  Thee Meliboeus once benignant swain  My comforter in bondage when we plough'd  The Grecian seas in Delphian Timon's bark  Was not I present when the genuine seed  Of Lygdamis in thee Aronces trac'd  But O illustrious brother of a queen  Ador'd in Asia what disastrous star  Thy midnight steps misguided to incur  The king's immutable decree of death  Thy bold attempt was virtuous but his will  Hath made thy virtue criminal Thy head  At his own peril Artamanes still  Shall guard thy liberty accept myself  Will be thy guide to safety Ah replies  The gen'rous son of Lygdamis and clasps  The meritorious Persian I perceive  Still unimpair'd thy virtues but receive  Thy noble proffer back For my behoof  Not with its shadow danger shall approach  My friend thy pris'ner let me rest till morn  A lib'ral garb is all the boon I crave  Then to Mardonius lead me tell my crime  No grace solicit who I am conceal  In tears replied the satrap Then thou diest  The royal edict cannot be controll'd  It can return'd the Carian rest assur'd  My preservation in myself I bear  Oh that with equal certainty my pow'r  Might from thy bosom chace that inmate new  Whate'er it be which violates thy peace  Thy early youth disfigures and consumes  Its fruit unripe Ah tell me is it grief  For some dead friend or sickness or the smart  Of injury or love Acanthè wak'd  That tender thought which soften'd on the tongue  Of Haliartus From the Persian's breast  A sigh deep note of agony which riv'd  His gentle heart accompanied these words  Endear'd associate in affliction past  Thou and thou only dost unlock the breast  Of Artamanes It is love my friend  The object once possessing ev'ry charm  Exterior still each beauty of the soul  By malady incurable devour'd  From day to day is hast'ning to the tomb  Oh long deplor'd Sandaucè thee my steps  Shall follow closeMy passion is unknown  To her peculiar was her state and mine  Too delicate at first for me to speak  For her to hear My hopes malignant time  Hath wasted since my health in her decay  But while my heart is bleeding for my love  The sluice grows wider and to friendship pours  A stream enlarg'd Thy dangerAh permit  That I reveal thy origin and rank  Thy sister's name can shake the king's decree  No Artamanes by th' immortal gods  Rejoins the Carian of my just attempt  I if succeeding all the merit knew  If taken knew my ransom But the stars  Half through their circles run suggest repose  May griefasswaging heaviness of sleep  Embalm thy eyelids and like mine thy breast  Feel no disquiet mayst thou rise again  Saluting hope the harbinger of peace  Stretch'd on a carpet Haliartus slept  Not so the troubled Persian long disus'd  To lenient rest Before the dawn he rose  Among the Greek auxiliars he procur'd  Apparel fair of Greece His Carian guest  Attir'd he guided o'er the Malian beach  To that august pavilion which contain'd  The royal person once Mardonius now  In all the state of Xerxes save the crown  Thus Artamanes See a hapless man  Who hath attempted to remove the corse  Of Sparta's king That hapless man must die  Returns the gen'ral Xerxes so ordain'd  Not I Then absent on a charge remote  Mardonius knew not nor approv'd when known  Th' indignity that noble corse sustain'd  To him the Carian Mindarus to death  With hecatombs of nobles thou decreest  Who in Euboea will appease my ghost  Ha who art thou in agitation spake  The satrap Guard bid Lamachus approach  Our visitor so recent from that isle  He was not far the son of Gobryas thus  Address'd him ent'ring Note that stranger well  Why dost thou start Themistocles can boast  No bolder warrior Lamachus exclaim'd  I was his captive in th' Orēan fight  Again the Carian Truth for once he speaks  I dragg'd him bound my captive on that field  Ariobarzanes felt me further learn  By me the savage Demonax was slain  But to have rescu'd from inhuman wrong  The mortal part of that transcendent man  Who living shook all Asia with dismay  Had been my proudest boast Mardonius then  By Horomazes I admire and prize  Thy gen'rous flame brave warrior Under charge  Of Artamanes in Trachiniae's round  Awhile remain Now Lamachus ascend  Some ready bark revisit yonder isle  This Greek for Mindarus exchange redeem  The rest of Asia's nobles I allot  For each a talent In these words salute  Themistocles "To Athens I have sent  "Young Alexander Macedonia's prince  "Ambassador of friendship I would call  "Themistocles ally himself may name  "But Persia's bounty shall exceed his price  "This if his Attic arrogance rejects  "Tell him Mardonius who disdains a war  "Of oars and sails the dubious ocean's sport  "Will give him battle on the plains of Thebes"  Though Artamanes joyfully beholds  His friend in safety with a trembling step  Trachiniae's gates he passes to the roof  Which holds Sandaucè Ent'ring he perceives  Melissa She transported at the sight  Of Haliartus thus began O friend  Dear to my sire to all th' Oïlean house  What unexpected ecstacy were mine  At thy appearance ifAh Persian lord  Sandaucè sweet Sandaucè yields to fate  Her dying lips on Artamanes call  Soft gratitude o'erflows her gentle breast  Her wish is eager ere she breathe her last  To see her friend and guardian Ending here  She moves before him with unstable feet  With other prompters anguish and despair  He follows Pallid on her mournful couch  The princess lies her infants weep around  Bright Amarantha in disorder'd garb  Unloosen'd hair and frantic with distress  Stands nigh The graces sadden on her front  Her beauteous eyes a gushing torrent pour  Like overswelling fountains once serene  The lucid mirrors to encircling flow'rs  Now troubled by a storm which levels round  The growth of shade and scatters on their face  Uprooted shrubs in bloom Her languid lips  At length unclosing thus Sandaucè spake  Omniscient God of nature let me lift  My voice appealing When before me lay  Autarctus slaughter'd when these babes condemn'd  By cruel rites to sacrifice were led  Did not the creature of thy tend'rest mold  Feel as a wife a mother and receive  A cureless wound Thy providence uprais'd  A kind protector through my lengthen'd walks  Of grief till now they terminate in death  If to his gen'rous purity of care  Assiduous kind and pious time hath rais'd  Within my breast a secret soft return  Was this an error Hath my heart abus'd  The sensibility thou gav'st Alone  Art thou my judge Creator I obey  Before thy awful presence thou dost call  Sandaucè's youth unconscious of a crime  My debt avow'd of gratitude I pay  By this confession of my fleeting breath  To Artamanes O illustrious youth  Supreme in rank in virtue still more
