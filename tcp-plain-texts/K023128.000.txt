shall bound my last  Why    will you break the Sabbath of my days  Now sick alike of Envy and of Praise  Publick too long ah let me hide my Age  See modest    Cibber now has left the Stage  Our Gen'rals now    retir'd to their Estates  Hang their old Trophies o'er the Garden gates  In Life's cool evening satiate of applause  Nor    fond of bleeding ev'n in BR  's cause    A Voice there is that whispers in my ear  'Tis Reason's voice which sometimes one can hear  " Friend Pope be prudent let your    Muse take breath  " And never gallop Pegasus to death  " Lest stiff and stately void of fire and force  " You limp like Blackmore on a Lord Mayor's horse'  Farewel then    Verse and Love and ev'ry Toy  The rhymes and rattles of the Man or Boy  What    right what true what fit we justly call  Let this be all my carefor this is All  To lay this    harvest up and hoard with haste  What ev'ry day will want and most the last  But ask not to what    Doctors I apply  Sworn to no Master of no Sect am I  As drives the    storm at any door I knock  And house with Montagne now or now with Lock  Sometimes a    Patriot active in debate  Mix with the World and battle for the State  Free as young Lyttleton her cause pursue  Still true to Virtue    and as warm as true  Sometimes with Aristippus or St Paul  Indulge my Candor and grow all to all  Back to my    native Moderation slide  And win my way by yielding to the tyde    Long as to him who works for debt the Day  Long as the Night to her whose love's away  Long as the Year's dull circle seems to run  When the brisk Minor pants for twentyone  So slow th'    unprofitable Moments roll  That lock up all the Functions of my soul  That keep me from Myself and still delay  Life's instant business to a future day  That    task which as we follow or despise  The eldest is a fool the youngest wise  Which done the poorest can no wants endure  And which not done the richest must be poor    Late as it is I put my self to school  And feel some    comfort not to be a fool    Weak tho' I am of limb and short of sight  Far from a Lynx and not a Giant quite  I'll do what MEAD and CHESELDEN advise  To keep these limbs and to preserve these eyes  Not to    go back is somewhat to advance  And Men must walk at least before they dance  Say does thy    blood rebel thy bosom move  With wretched Avarice or as wretched Love  Know there are Words and Spells which can controll      Between the Fits this Fever of the soul  Know there are Rhymes which    fresh and fresh apply'd  Will cure the arrant'st Puppy of his Pride  Be    furious envious slothful mad or drunk    Slave to a Wife or Vassal to a Punk  A Switz a Highdutch or a Lowdutch    Bear  All that we ask is but a patient Ear    'Tis the first Virtue Vices to abhor  And the first Wisdom to be Fool no more  But to the world no    bugbear is so great  As want of figure and a small Estate  To either India see the Merchant fly  Scar'd at the spectre of pale Poverty  See him with pains of body pangs of soul  Burn through the Tropic freeze beneath the Pole  Wilt thou do nothing for a nobler end  Nothing to make Philosophy thy friend  To stop thy foolish views thy long desires  And    ease thy heart of all that it admires  Here Wisdom calls    "Seek Virtue first be bold  " As Gold to Silver Virtue is to Gold"  There London's voice    "Get Mony Mony still  " And then let Virtue follow if she will"  This this the saving doctrine preach'd to all  From    low St James's up to high St Paul  From him whose    quills stand quiver'd at his ear  To him who notches Sticks at Westminster  BARNARD in    spirit sense and truth abounds  " Pray then what wants he" fourscore thousand pounds  A Pension or such Harness for a slave  As Bug now has and Bestia fain would have  BARNARD thou art a    Cit  with all thy worth  Bestia and Bug Their  Honours  and so forth  Yet every    child another song will sing  " Virtue brave boys 'tis Virtue makes a King"  True conscious Honour is to feel no sin  He's arm'd without that's innocent within  Be this thy    Screen and this thy Wall of Brass  Compar'd to this a Minister's an Ass    And say to which shall our applause belong  This new Court jargon or the good old song  The modern language of corrupted Peers  Or what was spoke at    CRESSY and POITIERS    Who counsels best who whispers "Be but Great  " With Praise or Infamy leave that to fate  " Get Place and Wealth if possible with Grace  " If not by any means get Wealth and Place  For what to have a    Box where Eunuchs sing  And foremost in the Circle eye a King  Or    he who bids thee face with steddy view  Proud Fortune and look shallow Greatness thro'  And    while he bids thee sets th' Example too  If    such a Doctrine in St James's air  Shou'd chance to make the welldrest Rabble stare  If honest S* take scandal at a spark  That less admires the    Palace than the Park  Faith I shall give the answer    Reynard gave  " I cannot like Dread Sir your Royal Cave  " Because I see by all the Tracks about  " Full many a Beast goes in but none comes out"  Adieu to Virtue if you're once a Slave  Send her to Court you send her to her Grave  Well if a King's a Lion at the least  The    People are a manyheaded Beast  Can they direct what measures to pursue  Who know themselves so little what to do  Alike in nothing but one Lust of Gold  Just half the land would buy and half be sold  Their    Country's wealth our mightier Misers drain  Or cross to plunder Provinces the Main  The rest some farm the Poorbox some the Pews  Some keep Assemblies and wou'd keep the Stews  Some    with fat Bucks on childless Dotards fawn  Some win rich Widows by their Chine and Brawn  While with the silent growth of ten per Cent  In Dirt and darkness    hundreds stink content  Of all these ways if each    pursues his own  Satire be kind and let the wretch alone  But show me one who has it in his pow'r  To act consistent with himself an hour  Sir Job    sail'd forth the evening bright and still  " No place on earth he cry'd like Greenwich hill"    Up starts a Palace lo th' obedient base  Slopes at its foot the woods its sides embrace  The silver Thames reflects its marble face  Now let some whimzy or that    Dev'l within  Which guides all those who know not what they mean  But give the Knight or give his Lady spleen  " Away away take all your scaffolds down  " For Snug's the word My dear we'll live in Town"  At am'rous Flavio is the    Stocking thrown  That very night he longs to lye alone    The Fool whose Wife elopes some thrice a quarter  For matrimonial Solace dies a martyr  Did ever    Proteus Merlin any Witch  Transform themselves so strangely as the Rich  " Well but the    Poorthe Poor have the same itch  They change their    weekly Barber weekly News  Prefer a new Japanner to their shoes  Discharge their    Garrets move their Beds and run  They know not whither in a Chaise and one  They    hire their Sculler and when once aboard  Grow sick and damn the Climatelike a Lord    You laugh half Beau half Sloven if I stand  My Wig all powder and all snuff my Band  You laugh if Coat and Breeches strangely vary  White Gloves and Linnen worthy Lady Mary  But when    no Prelate's Lawn with Hairshirt lin'd  Is half so incoherent as my Mind  When each Opinion with the next at strife  One    ebb and flow of follies all my Life  I    plant root up I build and then confound  Turn round to square and square again to round    You never change one muscle of your face  You think this Madness but a common case  Nor    once to Chanc'ry nor to  The Doctor of Bedlam  Hales apply  Yet hang your lip to see a Seam awry  Careless how ill I with myself agree  Kind to my dress my figure not to Me  Is this my    Guide Philosopher and Friend  This He who loves me and who ought to mend  Who ought to make me what he can or none  That Man divine whom Wisdom calls her own  Great without Title without Fortune bless'd  Rich    ev'n when plunder'd    honour'd while oppress'd  Lov'd    without youth and follow'd without power  At home tho' exil'd    free tho' in the Tower  In short that reas'ning high immortal Thing  Just    less than Jove and    much above a King  Nay half in Heav'n    except what's mighty odd  A Fit of Vapours clouds this Demigod
