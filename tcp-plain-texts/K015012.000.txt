 THE CASE OF Mr  LAW  Truly Stated In Answer to a Pamphlet entitul'd A LETTER to Mr LAW  LONON  Printed for A MOORE near St  Paul's  and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price Sixpence  The CASE of Mr LAW truly stated  SIR  _THERE has been a Pamphlet publish'd here entitiled  A Letter  to you Mr  Law  which has partly banter'd you and partly flatter'd you in a kind of a flourishing but superficial Way leaving us altogether in the Dark at the Close as to the Author's Meaning  or indeed whether he has any Meaning or no  other than to have you spoken of and made a little obnoxious and this indeed seems to be the principal Design of the Book if as I say above there is any real Design in it or if not this then by setting out your great Capacities and perhaps more than your own Modesty will suffer you to acknowledge prepare us to expect some great Things from you here and to receive them well when they shall be proposed  I have observ'd among the Boys in our Streets  with your Pardon for the Allusion  when sometimes one more quarrelsome  than his Fellows falls upon another and offers him any Violence that the ordinary return of the injur'd Boy is thus  Let me alone I don't meddle with you  The natural Justice in that Reply  however Boyish  is very pungent and as this Book call'd a Letter or the Letter call'd a Book has thus offer'd you a Piece of simple empty unmeaning Violence it would be a full Answer for Mr  Law  to say to the rhetocial Author no more than this  Let me alone I don't meddle with you  But since Mr  Law  is come among us and though he does  not meddle  with us we  will meddle  with him give me leave Sir to address you in another manner perhaps with more Plainness and fewer Flourishes yet with more Justice to you and as much to our selves In order to this I must first ask your leave to follow him a little in his too partial History of your late Transactions  abroad as also  in his Parallel with ours at home  What you did in  France  and how or to what extravagance Things were run up there is nothing at all to us besides if this Author's History of you is just  viz  that your Scheme was right and that the extravagant advance of things was against your Judgment and opposed by you with all your Might but that you were overruled  by those  who had an Influence at Court at that Time  and who had worse Designs  I say  if his History is just all the Disasters which have happen'd there are nothing at all to you But on the contrary he supposes you had been able to have carry'd on all your Schemes with Success and every thing would have answer'd it self and that you were so far from being the Instrument of Ruin to the  French  Nation that they were only ruin'd by your being overrul'd by those  that had an Influence as Court at that Time  If this be true all his long Blank may be filled up without any Prejudice to your Character or without putting any Body in Apprehension either of what you may do or of what others may project to do by your Means or by your Assistance among us  This Book call'd a Letter gives a long Detail of your Abilities  'your Skill in Calculations your being a Man whose Talent and Genius lay particularly in Figures who had thereby a superior and uncommon Skill in those Games which depend chiefly on Calculation who had visited most of the Courts of  Europe  and made your Observations of every thing relating to the Management of their Finances'  And after he has thus set you off is every Jot as favourable to  your Projects intimating that they were such as would have supported themselves and that the Principles on which they were founded were good that the whole Structure was overthrown by nothing but the excessive Rise of the Stock run up by the rash and sudden Humour of the People not only of  France  but even of all the Nations of  Europe  who in such prodigious Numbers flock'd at that time to  Paris  to get into them  Now Sir not to flatter you with all these fine Things which I humbly presume to say you know your self to be false and which you cannot but smile at the reading of knowing how unfairly tho' to your Advantage your Case is there stated give me leave with all Decency and Respect to your Person to tell the World that if  Mr  Law  himself  was to give a true and genuine History of himself with respect to the part which he acted in  France  it would be quite another way and he would acknowledge that great part of those fine Things which are said of him in the said Letter either are not true in Fact or ought to have quite another Turn given them seeing they are set in a wrong Light and our Eyes are turned from a true to a delusive Perspective in our View both of his Conduct and of his Design  Previous to this Sir give me leave to say that all this which the Letter has been pleased to say of Mr  Law  and of his Designs is no more or less but what may and perhaps with the same Justice be said of the late Directors of the  SouthSea  Company of whom since our Eyes have been open to some of the secret Movements of that Affair we have said so many gross Things and whom we have treated with such Contempt  It cannot be said nor as I have heard was it ever pretended that Sir  John Blunt  or the abdicated Mr  Knight  could imagine or did suppose that ever the Stock of the  SouthSea  could rise to so surprizing a Height as by the Avarice and Humour of the People afterwards appeared they have not been charg'd with forming any Schemes upon a suppos'd Advance of such a Magnitude nor indeed was it possible they should all the Rise was Astonishment and Surprize Nor can it be deny'd but that Sir  John Blunt  himself pretended to be against the Advance of the Stock and was heard in the height of his Prosperity very often to say  that the Madness of the People wou'd ruin them all  On the other hand neither did Mr  Law  in  France  forbear to make use of and  form as great and  if I may say so  as impracticable Projects upon the Foot of the popular Madness of the People and perhaps worse in their Kind than ever Sir  John Blunt  or the Directors form'd here which Projects unwieldly in themselves and unable to perform added their Weight to the Overthrow of Mr  Law  and his Schemes when but a minute Accident gave them a Check even just as those others did to Sir  John Blunt  and his Schemes when they received a Shock from a like Accident as the other  And now Sir as this Part may unfold some Arcana both in your Management among the  French  Courtiers and in the Management of our C among the  SouthSea  Directors which are not yet fully penetrated by us no not by some of those who were very nearly concerned in them give me leave to run a short Parallel between the two Schemes or rather between the Management respectively on either Side and we shall see into the Reason of the Overthrow of both perhaps farther than we ever saw yet  Mr  Law  's first Step  says the Letter  was to establish a Bank which receiving and paying considerable Sums for the Government lending Money at the low Interest of  per Cent  discounting Bills issuing a great Number of Notes payable at Demand and causing those Notes to be answer'd with the utmost Exactness rais'd its Credit to such a height as made its Notes be    or  per Cent  better than Specie  and all the Designs to ruin the Credit of that Bank or its Director gain'd the highest Reputation to both  The first Step Sir  John Blunt  and the Directors of the  SouthSea  Company took was to make a Proposal to the Parliament for the paying the Publick Debts of the Nation by ingrafting all the Debts of the Publick into the  SouthSea  Stock and enabling the Government to discharge the Funds by reducing the Interest to  per Cent  and by yielding to the Government out of the Advance made upon the Stock a Sum of Millions in Money in a certain Time  Had either Mr  Law  or Sir  John Blunt  contented themselves with the utmost that they cou'd either expect from these several Establishments or so much as believe to be possible at that Time they had still retain'd the general Applause of the Country they were in and not the  first  been forc'd to fly from the Fury of the Rabble and the  last  be attainted sorefaulted confiscated and hated  But to go on Mr  Law  finding himself at the Head of a Bank whose Credit as above was  per Cent  better than Specie a thing never heard of in  England  Fate and his working Head push'd him upon innumerable Projects some of them impracticable and imaginary as the  Missisipps  others of them vast immense and unmanagable as that of raising the general Farms Four Millions a Year and yet throwing off all the burthensome Part of the Taxes and giving them up to the People such as the Duties upon Flesh Fish Fruit Wine and Fuel taking the Management of the whole Revenue of  France  upon themselves and dismissing  Collectors TollGatherers  and other Officers who subsisted on the Spoils of the People all which was done not with a real View to be able to support it by any other Way than the Publick Fame and Credit of the Scheme for that was impossible but to raise up the Credit to a stupendious Height and so to perform if he really intended to perform all those impossible Things out of the Plunder of those People whose Avarice dup'd them into such a Frenzy as to give  per Cent  for Shares in his Bubble  How then can any Man say that Mr  Law  oppos'd the Rising of Stock Mr  Law  could not but know that advancing a small real Value  by Credit  to a great imaginary Value was the only Way to support all those vast Undertakings and that if that Credit lasted or so long as it lasted those Undertakings might be upheld and therefore it was that he every Day went into some new Project broach'd some new Proposal however monstrous and impracticable to keep up the Spirits of the People which he had rais'd in so surprizing a Manner  such was  the undertaking Coinage for Nine Years the Farm of  Tobacco  the  East India  Company and the  Missisippi such was  the undertaking Eighteen Hundred Millions of Publick Debts and the managing the whole Publick Revenue  such was  erecting Manufactures making Canals and Navigations building new Cities  and the like  The Author of the Letter forgets or perhaps was not enough in the Secret of Mr  Law  's History to mention his grave Resolution to crush entirely all the  English  Stocks and sink their Credit and the several wise Measures not to say cunning Measures he entered into for the performing it and in which he was bit by some Gentlemen who understand  English  Stocks better than he did and in which simple Project to say no worse of it he  lost about One Hundred and Sixty Thousand Pistoles which he paid Difference Money in all which I never saw any of his Craft except it was in taking Care that  France  should not hear of it in which also he was more beholden to the Modesty of the  English  Gentlemen he was concern'd with who valued their Money enough but despis'd the Gasconade of it than to his own Policy  Come we back to the long Scene of Management in  France  while the Stock kept up its prodigious Height How many new Creations of Stock Fifty Millions at once did Mr  Law  crave at a Time till Millions of New Stock was granted him all to be sold at the monstrous Advance which the Stock then went at  It cannot be doubted that had Millions of Stock been actually transferred and sold at the Price which it then was advanc'd to namely from to  per Cent  it must have enabled Mr  Law  not only to have paid off all the Publick Debts and done all the great Things he had proposed but even an hundred Times as many he might not only have peopled  Missisippi  but  America  and have planted a New World if he could have found Land to place it on and the Purchase of what he had so created could not have  been paid for by all the Money Plate and Jewels in  Europe  Let us go back to the Directors of the  SouthSea  Company they prompted by the same surprizing Advance upon their Stock went on in their Degree to innumerable vast Conceptions How many Projects and Schemes lay before them No less than taking in the  East India  Company and their Trade the  African  Company and their Trade the  Bank  and their Business and at last all the Customs By their Credit they were to dissolve the Taxes at once clear the Revenue of all its Anticipations they were to advance all the Money the Parliament would have occasion to grant and the World began to think once they would make themselves Parliament Government and every Thing What they might have done or rather what they might not have done that Way or what Mr  Law  might not have done in  France  had they both gone on is scarce to be express'd but  Nascitur ridiculus Mus  The Parallel goes on still both were overturn'd by their own Bulk the unperforming Machines blew themselves up by the Force of their own Motion and the Projectors are overwhelm'd with them  So Engineers that spring an illcharg'd Mine Sink in the Ruin of their own Design  As Mr  Law  to supply the monstrous Demands which he had brought upon his Company by taking upon them Millions of Debts coined every Day new Grants of Stock which the Humour of the  Messeurs de Quincampoix  early found Chapmen to take off at the most prodigious and extravagant Prices so our Directors form'd as often as they thought fit new Subscriptions upon their Stock to the Tune of or Millions at a Time and at the prodigious Advance of to  per Cent  which the Gentlemen crowding every Day to  Exchange Alley  found Means to take off their Hands at the most monstrous and extravagant Prices that they could have the Face to put them up at and at an Advance beyond it  They do the Directors of the  South Sea  Company Injustice in the highest Degree who pretend to say that they cou'd not have answer'd the highest Dividend that they ever propos'd and for the longest Time that it was ever propos'd namely Years had all the Money for which those Subscriptions were taken in at been either paid to them or secur'd to be paid to them And I appeal to the Men of Figures let them be as partial as they please if they are but just to cast up what a Subscription of Millions and a half at  and Millions at  per Cent  as was talk'd of at that time would not have done The only Injustice done by the Directors in making those Proposals of Dividends was that it was evident these Subscriptions on which they were founded like Mr  Law  's new Millions of coin'd Stock could never be paid for that it was impossible and that not all the Money or Credit of the Nation cou'd perform it  And this made the Directors by a weak and scandalous Loan part with all the Money and Paper they had to the Tune of Millions to support the Circulations of Things in the Town which as they did no doubt see or might have seen could never have been paid and which yet if they had not done their Stock could not have held up its Head a Week together  It may be true and I believe it would have been true that if the Company had stood and had proposed a fifth Subscription at or even at  per Cent  it would have been subscrib'd and  per Cent  or perhaps  per Cent  would have been paid in tho' to have done it the Company must not only have issued all the Money and Bills they had but all the circulating Cash and all the Paper  Credit of the Nation must have been strain'd to the utmost  But it must also have been true that after the Company had been thus possess'd of the whole Treasure of the Kingdom if they had not found some way or other to have issued it again every time a new Payment on those Subscriptions had been due those Payments cou'd not have been made The Reason is plain that like a Board of Play when the Box has got all the Money of the Gamesters if it does not think fit to lend it out to them again the Game is at an End they can play no more So those Men having thus possess'd all the Cash of the Nation  that is to say all that cou'd be come at  all that was to be had and all the Credit also that the Men of Credit were able to answer if they did not think fit to issue it again on some foot or other  the Play would have been at an End  no Men could have made good their Payments and all sorts of Confusion would have follow'd  This was exactly parallel to Mr  Law  's Case in  France  who likewise made a Dividend upon his Stock when it was about  per Cent  intimating that he was able to do the like in proportion to any Advance which the Stock might have been rais'd to as doubtless he wou'd have  done had all the Stock which he daily created been purchased at the advanc'd Price which it was current at when created and paid for too for what might not he do who could create Fifty or an Hundred Millions of Stock when he pleased and sell it immediately at  per Cent  All the Difficulty was that indeed he might while the Humour of the People lasted sell his Stock at that Price but that all the Wealth of  Europe  could not pay for it and so as I said before the Machine burst it self by its own Weight and the Violence of its own Motion  And shall any Man come now and compliment you Mr  Law  with telling the World how equal your Genius is to the vast Designs you had laid and that it was only your being overrul'd by those who had an Influence at Court that overthrew it all  To be plain Sir and not to injure Truth or you so much the Case was only this that those People who had the Influence at Court finding that you had laid Schemes too large for the whole Treasure of the World to answer and that you only screw'd up the adventurous Humour of the People by starting every Day new Surprizes new Oceans for them to launch out into so supporting one Chimera by another building Infinite opon  Infinite which it was evident must sink all at last into infinite Confusion  I say  seeing this they thought fit to give a Check to the Velocity of the Motion in hopes to have let Things fall gently and gradually But the Machine being unweildy and all the Parts depending upthe Progression of the foremost like a strong Current hastily and effectually stop'd the Waters at the first Check overflow'd all the Country round them and still not able to find a Vent forward reverted with an Ebb a thousand Times more surious than the Flux which first brought them on and it was then no wonder that Mr  Law  could not stand it 'twas really more a Wonder that those Great Men whose Act and Deed that Catastrophe was had Power left to carry him off  as they did  And I believe Sir you are the first Man that ever came clear off if you may think your self safe from the Resentment of a whole Nation and with so much of the Ruins of their Country in his Pocket  Just thus Sir has it been here in its Kind Happy had it been if the Great Persons concern'd here of whom Sir  John Blunt  and his Fraternity have been little more than the Shadow had  as much in time  and from the same Principle of Concern for the publick Good put a check to the  monstrous Growth of Things which they could not but foresee and  Mr  Aislabie  tells us  he did foresee would at last blow up and end in Confusion and Destruction  But on the contrary they went on to the last Gasp till they were overwhelm'd by their own Folly and by that Envy which was only the blinded Child of unbounded Avarice and Ambition as I shall shew presently  The Fall of your Machine I have touch'd at already the Author of the Letter seems not at all to see the Nature of it and is quite wide of the Occasion and hinting only at the Instruments as if they were scarce known in which by the way he is also mistaken places it to the account of a mere Trifle namely that the first Adventurers began to think of  realizing their Stock  and converting the prodigious Gains they had made into Specie And this  says he  brought such a Demand upon the Bank as it was impossible to answer  How poor and mean a Description is here of the most flagrant Cheat in the World and which was just then offer'd in the Face of the Sun the like of which was enough to alarm all the World The meaning of it all was  in short nothing more or less than this  that the Great Men who were first in this monstrous Adventure  of yours and who had as you say come in at  per Cent  under Par and stood now at  per Cent  above Par knowing very well that it was  as above  impossible to be supported but must at last fall all to pieces and come to nothing began to think it high time to be satisfy'd  and sell out  vesting their vast Stocks in the Bank and from thence as you say drawing such great Sums in Specie that it was impossible the Bank or even the whole Kingdom should answer them  This was indeed done with less Art than in  England  it was immediately seen in the  Rue de Quincampoix  that the Great Men and particularly the first Projectors began to sell out their Stock and buy Estates nay the great Mr  Law  on whose Example so much depended was not so politick in this part as Sir  John Blant  but bought Estates Lordships Palaces nay as I have heard even Roy alties and Principalities I hope no Man will place that part among his Prudentials or as a Testimony of his most accomplish'd Genius If Mr  Law  did not foresee that his selling our and the other Peoples selling out who were look'd upon to be in the main Secret of the Affair would at least he an Example to others to do the like and that the Alarm once taken it would soon  bring more Sellers to Market than Buyers the Consequence of which must be a Fall of the Price which would be fatal as Death I say if he did not foresee this he could not be the Great Man the World at that Time esteem'd him to be and if he did foresee it and yet openly acted so he must be supposed to see himself at the End of the Adventure and like a skilful Pilot who seeing first the unavoidable Wreck of the Ship he is in makes Provision for his own Safety and takes care to get something too out of the Cargo for himself But neither of these Suppositions give us any Idea of Mr  Law  to his Advantage whether we speak of his Capacity or of his Integrity  Come we then to the  Circumstances  which overthrew our  SouthSea  Fabrick here which are in Proportion the same That which gave them the first Blow was likewise a Trifle and from which even the longest Head among them did not expect the Consequence that happen'd nay it was seen without Doors before it was seen within if we may believe some who were Witnesses to the Surprize it was even to those who struck the Blow when they found the Wound was felt where it was not intended The Case was this  Avarice an unwearied and impatient  Vice finding the Scheme on which her great Advantages were built rival'd  as it was then call'd  by petty Bubbles of rising Fame and not brooking any such Thing as to see Part of the Gain going besides her Mill grown insolent by her Success and grasping the whole World in her Imagination she grew also uneasy at their Success and though she soar'd infinitely above them all ought to have disdain'd them or that  being her self a Bubble  she ought to have encourag'd the universal Humour of Bubbling I say Avarice impatient thus to be mated or so much as rival'd stir'd up her old Ancestor  Envy  to fall upon them and in a Word to make use of her Friends to suppress all the other Bubbles of the Town  In consequence of this Project came out a Publication and Process was order'd to be issued out by Writ of  Scire Facias  against several of the Projects that were then on Foot such as  YorkBuildings British Copper Welch Copper Lustring  and others and the two Companies since called the  Royal Exchange  and the  London Assurances  were threaten'd with the same  But the Influence of this Design run quite counter to what was intended and Things began presently to take another Turn for as this immediately struck  a mortal Blow upon the Stocks of all those Companies which were already very high and that a prodigious Number of Contracts were made for thier Stock and afterwards became void by their never being able to open their Books the People were immediately oblig'd to sell off their  SouthSea  Stock to support their Credit which had receiv'd such a Blow in these Bubbles  But it did not end here For  This brought such a prodigious Quantity of Stock to Market that it was impossible Buyers should be found to take it off which as it always is when there are more Sellers than Buyers made Stock immediately fall and which was still worse  It check'd the adventurous Humour of the People gave them a Shock made them sick of Bubbles in general and made them suggest that the  SouthSea  it self being by the extravagant Greatness become a Bubble also might some time or other meet with a like Shock and thus withdrawing universally from every Thing the Catastrophe began and has ever since gone on to what we see it is at present  All this while as was afterwards discovered the Great Men who were in the  Secret who knew that one time or other it must all blow up were like your Great Men in  France realizing their Stock  that is to say turning it into Specie and buying Estates with it for which they gave most extravagant Rates such as the Sellers almost blush'd to ask for them paying for them as much as possibly they could in  SouthSea  Stock so to cover the Transferring such large Sums of Stock the better  Now all the Difference between Mr  Law  and the Great Men in  France  and the Directors in  England  was that he did it openly and unwarily and thereby gave the Alarm which overthrew their whole Scheme but our People did it subtily and privately and that our Alarm coming another way as above they were not found out till afterward  And thus I have run a Parallel between the two Schemes and the Management on either Side as far as it concerns Mr  Law  in which I think I do Mr  Law  no Injury if I say that the Letter Writer has made a wide Deviation from his true Character and that tho' his Genius was really very much bent upon Figures and Calculations and that he had at first just Notions of Credit and Cash and of forming Projections for the carrying those Undertakings which related to a Bank yet  he was bold enterprizing rash and adventurous beyond the Reach of the Plan on which he proposed to act that he attempted impracticable Things and supported them by launching into more Things equally impracticable so that there was a Necessity for him at last  to sink  as I have said  in the Ruins of his own Design  that finding this Necessity approaching and inevitable he  sold out  and amassed an infinite Treasure in Specie Part of which he remitted that is conveyed out of the Kingdom and with other Parts of which he purchased Palaces Estates Honours and Lands without Number and when in the Consequence of this the People began to be alarm'd and did the like and that the Bank stop'd the Stock sunk and all fell into Confusion he got leave to run away to avoid the just Resentment of a ruin'd Nation  And now Sir I appeal to your self whether this is not a fairer Account of the Fact and a truer History of Mr  Law  than what the Letter has undertaken or than what he has introduced as from  Paris  and that tho' you are not flatter'd no Injury is done you in it nor any Hurt intended you  It remains now to enquire here with the same Plainness into what the Writer of  the Letter would only suggest whether maliciously or not I will not determine namely that Mr  Law  being arrived here  all these Things  may be the Consequence of his coming hither which ought to be written down in the four Lines which he has left Blank in his Letter intimating  if we please to take it so for he leaves every one to take it as he will  that Mr  Law  may be employ'd on great Designs here among us  whether to good or hurt he'd likewise leave us to conjecture  This I must needs say I think is doing you a great deal of Injury and exposing you to very great Hardships and Resentments one way or other as People may be prompted by their Fears or Hopes to suggest  Now in this Sir I may perhaps do you an unexpected Piece of Justice and am not out of Hopes of meriting much of your Favour by it at least I will undertake to deliver Mr  Law  from all the Prejudices and Jealousies which seem to be rising against him among us and this you will be further satisfy'd of in the reading these Sheets wherein if I effectually make it appear that all that is suggested of Mr  Law  as to what he may do here is groundless and that it is impossible that he should ever be able to do either  good  for us  or hurt  to us  I shall  Tout de une Coup  remove all the Jealousies and ill Will that I see some People begin to entertain of him and tho' it may be suggested that then I shall  vote him useless  which they say is indeed making him a meer Invalid and bespeaking a Cell for him at  Chelsea  or at  Greenwich  yet  I say  I shall make him full Amends by delivering him from the Clamours of the People and stoping the Mouths of these speechmaking Enemies which he might otherwise find very troublesome to him on all Occasions making his Native Country a true  Assylum  to him as it is to a great many harmless worthless Gentlemen beside  Nor is there here any need to enter into Arguments from your good Character and the general Principle which your Friends say you have acted by and so endeavour to prove that you will do us no harm since I have that more solid Argument to make use of namely the Reputation of your Sense your Understanding and Penetration for having once laid it down as a Fundamental and prov'd it past Contradiction that it is impossible you should do either good or hurt to us I leave your Character of a Man of Sense and Judgment to vouch for you that you will  not attempt it and it would be the greatest Satyr imaginable upon Mr  Law  and an Affront which my Regard for him will not suffer me to offer him to insinuate that he will venture to embark in any thing which his Understanding must tell him is impossible We are a Nation credulous enough and have been censur'd for our Folly in the Conduct of our private Affairs by all the wiser People of  Europe  and our late  SouthSea  Follies give but too much Reason for us to acknowledge that the Reproach is just and had the great Mr  Law  acted in the Place of the less politick Mr  Knight  or the still less able Mr  Cg  I know not to what farther Extremes we might have run  I acknowledge that in the height of our jobbing Madness many People as amaz'd and surpriz'd would frequently start a little and offer the idle Question  Where will all these Things end  But there was not a Man that did or perhaps durst boldly take Pen and Ink and shew by just Calculations where they MUST end and what Destruction attended them and of which it might have  even then  been said they were not only possible to be the Consequences but that it was impossible to be otherwise I say no Body durst be  so free and honest for he was sure to be run down by the popular Rage of the Day on one hand and check'd perhaps insulted by Power on the other Hand nor do I say thus much without good Reasons  But had any of those wise Men who  like Prophets that prophecy after a Thing is come to pass have since shewn us how impossible it was those Things should end otherwise than they did  had Zeal enough for their Country's Good and to have adventured to say as much and with as clear Demonstrations of it beforehand as they did afterward however they might have been treated  then  they would have obtain'd a double share of Reputation  now  as well for their Honesty as their Penetration  But we must take Things as they are and as Nature presents them to us Fate and our National Precipitations determin'd us at that Time to be a Prey to our Deluders and which is worse to be the  Fools  of  Fools  for really the Managers however by the Insatuation of the Times they prevail'd to impose upon us to such a Degree yet it must be acknowledg'd us'd no great Cunning in deceiving us The Baits were laid so superficially and the Hook appeared so open that had we not  been blinded by a voracious Avarice it had been impossible to have brought a whole Nation to be plundered as they were even running into the Pit with their Eyes open  It is reported that a certain Fish which we deal much in Abroad is so eager for the Prey that if a Hook be but cover'd with a bit of red Cloth instead of Flesh they swallow it all at once and are taken without any Bait at all we were indeed taken in those Days without a Bait we were a Temptation to our selves our own Avarice led us on and we came to the  SouthSea  House so eager to be undone that there was no need to lay Traps and Plots to deceive us  The Use I make of this for I am not entring into the History of it is not to show how mad we were then but to show how sensible we are of it now and to let you see Sir that the Train being now fir'd and blown up there is no need to fear we shall a second Time be drawn in That we can no more be Bubbleriden that we shall not bite at a  red Rag  now and if all the Men of Figures and Men of Art in  Europe  were to Angle for us they would catch no more  Guageons  here the Season is over the Moonblind People are effectually cur'd the Frenzy is abated  not the sharpest Jobber of the Town can reach us or overreach us now no not the great Mr  Law  if he thinks he can he may go to work when he pleases but he will soon see his Engines will not work the Season for National Delusion is over He may as well raise a Harvest in Winter as raise the adventurous Temper again among the People after the Shocks and Damps to their Courage which they have lately receiv'd As the adventuring Temper of the People is check'd and the Edge of their Courage that Way taken off so Mr  Law  must give me leave to say and lay a great Stress upon it too that the Tools to work with on such Occasions I mean  Money  and  Credit  Mr  Law  was certainly right in his Postulata which the Letter to him says to his Praise  p  were the Principles which he went upon in his great Undertaking namely  That Trade depended on Money  That Credit was equal to Money  That the Credit of the Royal Bank supported by the Whole Species of all and form'd into one  Great Trading Company  had infinite Advantage over Credit in the Hands of private Traders  That consequently such Credit might be extended much farther than private Personal Credit  That Paper might supply the Place of Silver and was even better qualify'd to be us'd as Money  I say these are all solid and undoubted Axioms in the Affairs of Trade or Revenues Funds National Treasure and such like Things and are worthy of the Genius of the Great Mr  Law  when acting in  France  where Credit never shew'd much of her Face before  tho' here  with your Pardon  these Things are common Topicks that every StockJobber is Master of  But what is all this to be talk'd of now And I wonder that the Letter Writer cou'd mention them after what he had said  p  of the deplorable Condition of our Native Country  See his Words  "You will find our Trade lost our Credit ruin'd our Money in the Hands of the basest Men among us and the Innocent and Deluded still groaning under the Oppressions of the Wicked and Insatiable  Now Sir after this is it not a most preposterous Thing an Absurdity and merits Ridicule to the highest Degree to hear the same Writer talk of any Danger from Mr  Law  What can be more inconsistent Mr  Law  indeed laid down the great and undoubted Particulars above as  compleat Propositions and he was right and upon these he founded all the great Things he did in  France For Example  he set up a Bank amassed Money and erected Credit on these Three what might he not do and much greater Things he might have done if his Genius which this Man extols so much had been equal to his Undertaking  But what is this to his setting his Wheels to work among us who this Man says have neither Trade Money or Credit If the best Engineer or Millwright in the Nation were to build a Watermill and make it a most beautiful compleat Piece of Work that ever was seen yet if he has no Water to drive it 'tis a Thing without Life useless and fit for nothing For Mr  Law  to set his Wit to work upon a Scheme of Credit may be a fine Thing and I am ready to do Mr  Law  Justice with my utmost Skill but what can this do among us whose Credit is ruin'd Do Gamesters invite People to play that have no Bank or do Merchants invite Men to buy that have no Credit  Again as we have no Credit so we have no Money and what have we to fear being cheated of who have nothing to lose  Contabit vacuus coram latrone viator  If we had a flowing Cash and a high Credit we might indeed be jealous of a Man sam'd for an extraordinary Genius which I take to be only fine Words for something else and a mannerly way of calling a Gentleman a Bite and a Sharper which I shall not imitate I say Mr  Law  may be all that this Gentleman says of him tho' I shall not say I believe it of him But if Mr  Law  was sharper than he and Forty more as cunning as himself they could never raise a Project to the hurt of those People who have neither Money or Credit  If Mr  Law  will set up the finest Project in the World upon a Foundation of Nothing we will come all into it and bring Nothing to his Nothing and let him see what he will make of us there can be no Danger on our Side  I remember an old Verse of a Gentleman who having lost what he had at Play listed himself for a Soldier and his Friends perswading him against it and telling him of the Danger he wrote this to them in Answer  What cares he to die Sir that can't tell how to live  I turn the Case to the Point in hand Projects are a Game let Mr  Law  set up as many as he pleases we may all come into them For  What care they to Game Sir who nothing have to lose  This is argued upon the Author's own Hypothesis namely that our Trade is lost our Money gone our Credit ruin'd if this be true what can Mr  Law  make of us what can he get by us So we may effectually clear him of having any Design upon those of whom nothing is to be gotten  But least it should be suggested that this is only catching at the Advantage given in Argument but has no solid Weight in it for that the Assumption may be denied and 'tis apparent we have both Trade and Money and Credit though not much of the latter  To come then to the other side of the Proposition and prove that as he will not attempt us because nothing is to be got by us so he cannot hurt us if he  should attempt it because our Eyes are now open we are the burnt Children who shall always dread the Fire we have been bit once and it was our Masters the * * * * and our Masters the * * * * * and our Masters the * * * * * 's Fault but if we are bit again it will be our own Faults and no Body's else And on this Account only I am far from being of their Opinion and would have none be jealous of Mr  Law  I say let Mr  Law  go to work and if he has not spent all his Ammunition in  France  and exported all his Policy and exhausted his calculating Genius there let him try his Hand among us let him go to work with us and see what he can make of it and welcome I say that what between those who have no Money to lose and those who having lost so much are made too cunning to lose any more we have nothing to fear from Mr  Law  In the next place and to conclude all Here are no Materials for Mr  Law  to work with here are no more Funds to bring in as there are no more Fools to subscribe them so there are no Things for them to subscribe  It is true that our Credit has suffered a Blow a deep Wound tho' I hope not a mortal Wound On the other Hand it  is not to be reviv'd by any Project I say not by any the whole World cannot restore Credit in  England  to what it has been but by the Assistance of the One Article call'd Time which does not consist with any Company's  d'Eclas  either Mr  Law  or any Man in the World can bring forth  Our Credit has been lost by Knavery by Tricking and false Dealing and nothing but the Reverse of the Chicane which is Honesty can restore it and this Honesty must be approv'd to be the prevailing general Practice of the Age as the other has been before it can introduce Credit Honesty and Credit went away together and they must come together or not at all the Allusion will be found to be just and the Consequence is plain that till by Length of Time we recover our Honesty of Dealing we shall never fully restore our Credit and till Credit is restor'd there's no Foundation for a Man of Genius to build upon to do us or himself any Good and I take Mr  Law  to be too wise a Man to pretend to form any new Undertaking here as both we and himself are now circumstanc'd in the World  I might have mention'd here that the particular Jealousy People have of Mr  Law  upon Account of the late Undertaking in  France  and that little Credit he has obtained for Integrity in his Part is another Obstruction to his making any Attempt and especially seeing the Letter wrote to compliment him so much and perhaps to prepare us to think better of him has so ill come off in his Panegyrick and endeavouring to prove him the Great Genius that he would have him be thought to be he has neither clear'd him as an honest Man or as a wise Man I cou'd explain my self to Mr  Law  's Disadvantage but I forbear till further Occasion may be given which however I foresee will not be long  I am SIR Your Humble Servant  FINIS
