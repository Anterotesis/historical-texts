Pen Ink and Paper  Enter  CONSTANCE  hastily meeting  LISETTE  Constance  LISETTE Lisette who do you think I have just seen  Lis  Your old guardian I suppose  Con  Do you think I should look thus pleasant if it was  he  I meant  Lis  Who then our jailor who keeps the keys  Con  What poor Jeffrey ha ha hahow you talk  Lis  No no I guess who you mean the young Marquis De Lancy and he has passed so frequently under your window within these few days that I am amazed your guardian with all his suspicions has not observed him  Con  He has walked by above ten times within this hour and every time with his eyes fixed up to the lattice of my window and I had no heart to remove from it for every time he saluted me with the most respectful bow  Lis  Was his valet with him  Con  No but I saw another person in deep conversation with him a strange looking man who appeared like one of the faculty for his dress very much resembled that of my guardian's  Lis  Who wou'd it be  Con  But what most surprised me he had a letter in his hand which he respectfully held up to me but I could not reach it  Lis  I know who it isLa Fluer valet to the Marquis disguised as a doctor and I have no doubt but under that disguise he will find means to introduce himself to your old guardian and perhaps be brought into the very house and if I can assist his scheme I will for is it not a shame the doctor should dare here in Paris to forbid both you and your servant to stir from home lock us up and treat us as women are treated in Spain  with anger  Con  Never mind Lisette don't put yourself in a passion for we can learn to plot and deceive and treat him as men are treated in Spain  Lis  Right Madam and to prove I am not less inclined than yourself to Spanish manners I am as much in love as you are  Con  Not with the Marquis  Lis  Do you think I don't know better where it is my duty to love I am in love with his man  Con  I wish I knew the contents of that letter he held out to me  Lis  That you are belovedadmired I can tell every word in itI know every sentence as well as if I had read itand now madam it is my advice you sit down and answer it directly  Con  Before I have read it  Lis  Yes yes give your answer at the time you receive his letterconsider how convenient it will  be to give the one while you take the otherwe are so watched you know that we ought to let no opportunity pass for fear we should never get another and therefore when he finds means to send his letter you must take the same to return yours  Con  But if my guardian should even know I had written to a gentleman  Lis  I'll write for youand should there be any discovery the letter will be in my hand writing not yourswe must lose no timethe Doctor is abroad at present and it must be both written and delivered before his return  She sits at the table and begins to write  Con  But my dear Lisette  Lis  Don't put me out  Con  What are you saying  Lis  writing  What you are thinking  Con  You don't know my thoughts  Lis  I doAnd here they are in this letter  Con  Let me look at it  Lis  No don't examine your thoughts I beg you won't  solds the letter and rises  besides you have no time to read it I must run to the garden gate and deliver it immediatelythe worst difficulty is having for near an hour to supplicate this poor simple decrepit'd fool of the old Doctor's to open me the garden gate for a moment  Jeffrey calls  Con  The Doctor has lately appointed Jeffrey his apothecaryhe is busy preparing of medicines and will be angry at being disturb'd  Lis  No matterit may save the life of some of his Master's patients  Enter  JEFFREY  a bandage on his left Eye and one on his right Leg  Jef  You made me overthrow the whole decoction  Lis  Great Apothecary  Con  And alone worthy the physician under whom you have received instructions  Jef  I am very sorry I overthrew the decoction for it was for my usemy leg is in pain still and I am not yet satisfied the dog was not mad  Lis  I tell you I am sure he was not and had you suffer'd him to live it would have prov'd so  Jef  My master order'd me to kill him  Lis  Merely to make you believe he was mad and to shew his skill by pretending to preserve you from the Infection  Jef  Nay don't speak against my master  Lis  Who was it undertook to cure your eyes  Jef  He and thank heaven Lisette I shall not suffer any more from that  Lis  Why then do you wear a bandage  Jef  To hide the place where it was  Lis  And is it thus the Doctor cured you  Jef  He was so kind to put my left eye out in order to save the right  Con  Well still you are more fortunate than the God of Love for he has no eyes at all  Jef  And I shallhave two very soon for my master has promis'd me to buy me one at the great manufactory which will be much handsomer than either of my othera very handsomer glass one  Lis  And if the Doctor will remake you thus  piece by piece in time my dear Jeffrey you may become a very pretty manbut you know Jeffrey I love you even as you are  Jef  Love methat's a good jokeLisette I am afraid you want something of me you speak to me so plesantly  Lis  Want something of youhow cou'd such an idea enter your head  Jef  Because when you don't want something of me you huff me and cuff mefrom morning to night eh eh you look no more as you do now why if I was dying I durst hardly speak to you  Lis  Well henceforward you shall have no reason to complain But do you know Jeffrey I have a littlefavour to ask of you  Jef  Aye I thought so  Con  My dear Jeffrey we will make you any recompence  Jef  What is it you want if I can do it without offending my master I will  Lis  If you don't tell him he'll never know it  Jef  But I tell him every thinghe pays me my wages for tellingand I must not take them without earning them  Con  If money is of such value to you here take my purse  Jef  No it is not money I want it is something else  Lis  What what then  Jef  looking at  Lisette  with affection  Oh Mrs Lisette you know what I  but you always denied me  Lis  Pshaw if I cou'd grant it indeed without  my master knowing of it  Jef  Oh I won't tell him of that I protest  Con  Well Jeffrey what is your favour  Jef  Just one salute of Mrs Lisette  Lis  Oh if that's all after you have oblig'd us you shall have twenty  Jef  But I had rather have one now than the twenty you promise after  Lis  Come then make haste if it must be so  Jef  afer saluting her  Oh the first kiss of the girl one loves is so sweet  Lis  Now you are ready to comply with our request  Jef  Tell me what it is  Lis  To give us the key of the garden gate  Jef  I am very sorry I can't oblige you  Lis  Why not  Jef  For several reasons  Lis  Tell me one  Jef  In the first place I have not got the keymy master took it with him when he went out  Lis  You know you tell a falschood he has not got itis this your bargain and your gratitude  Jef  Nay if you are angry at that give me the kiss again  Lis  Ugly foolish yet artful and cunning wretch leave the room you make love to me indeed Why I always hated you laugh'd at you and despised you  Jef  I know thatdid not I tell you when you spoke so kindly to me you wanted something how then could you expect me to oblige you  Lis  I shall ever detest the sight of you  Jef  Unless you want something and then you'll call me againand then I shall kiss you again ha ha ha  Exit shewing the key  Lis  I never was so provok'd in my life  Con  My dear Lisette If our two lovers the Marquis and his Servant prove no more fortunate in their schemes than we have been in ours I fear I must according to his desire marry the Doctorand you Jeffrey  Lis  I marry Jeffreyhere comes the Doctor  Enter  DOCTOR  Doc  What an indignityI can't put up with itI can't bear itI'm ready to choak with passion  Con  Dear Sir what is the matter  Doc  I am disgraced ruined and undone  Con  And what has caused it Sir  Doc  A conspiracy of the blackest kindman's weakness is arrived to its highest summit and there is nothing wanting but merit to draw upon us the most cruel persecution  Lis  Ah I understandthe faculty have been conspiring against you  Doc  They have refused to grant me a diplomaforbid me to practice as a physician and all because I don't know a parcel of insignificant words but exercise my profession according to the rules of  reason  and  nature  Is it not natural to die then if a dozen or two of my patients have died under my hands is not that natural  Lis  Very natural indeed  Doc  But thank heaven in spite of the scandalous  reports of my enemies I have this morning nine visits to make  Con  Very true Sir a young ward has sent for you to attend his guardianthree nephews have sent for you to attend their uncles very rich menand five husbands have sent for you in great haste to attend their wives  Doc  And is not that a sign they think what I can dois it not a sign they have the highest opinion of my skill and the faculty shall see I will rise superior to their machinationsI have enter'd upon a project that I believe will teaze themI have made overtures to one of their profest enemies a man whom they have crushed and who is the chief of a sect just sprung up of which perhaps you never heard for simply by the power of Magnetism they can cure any ill or inspire any passion  Con  Is it possible  Doc  Yesand every effect is produced upon the frame merely by the power of the Magnet which is held in the hand of the physican as a wand of a conjuror is held in his and it produces wonders in physic equally surprising  Con  And will you become of this new sect  Doc  If they will recieve meand by this time the President has I dare say recieved my letter and I wait impatiently for an answer  Enter  JEFFRY  Jef  A Doctor at the door desires to speak with you  Doc  A Doctor in my house  Lis  I dare say it is the Magnetizing Doctor you have been writing to  Doc  Very likelyI dare say 'tis Doctor Mystery shew him in Jeffry  Jef  Please to walk this way Sir  Enter  LA FLUER  dress'd as a Doctor  Exit  Jeffry  La Fluer  Doctor I hope I have your pardon that tho' no farther acquaintance than by letter I thus wait upon you to pay my respects  Con  to  Lisette  It it the same I saw with the Marquis  Lis  aside  And it is La Fluer his valet  La Fluer  And to assure you that I and all my brethren have the highest respect for your talents and shall be happy to have you a member of our society  Doc  I presume Sir you are Doctor Mystery author and first discoverer of that healing and sublime Art Animal Magnetism  La Fluer  I am  Doc  And it will render you immortalmy curiosity to become acquainted with the forms and effects of your power is scarcely to be represled a moment will you indulge me with the smallest specimen of your art just to satisfy my curiosity  La Fluer  You are then intirely ignorant of it  Doc  Intirely  La Fluer  And so am I  aside  Hemhemyou must know Doctor  Doc  Shall I send the women out of the room  La Fluer  By no meansno no but I will shew both you and them a specimen of my art directly  You know Doctor their is an universal fluid which spreads throughout all nature  Doc  A fluid  La Fluer  Yes a fluidwhich isafluidand you know Doctor that this fluidgenerally called a fluid is the most subtile of all that is the most subtleDo you understand me  Doc  Yes yes  La Fluer  It ascends on high  looking down  and descends on low  looking up  penetrates all substances from the hardest metal to the softest bosomyou understand me I precieve  Doc  Not very well  La Fluer  I will give you a simile then  Doc  I shall be much oblig'd to you  La Fluer  This fluid is like a riverYou know what a river is  Doc  Yes certainly  La Fluer  This fluid is like a river thatthatrunsthatgoesthatgently glidessososowhile there is nothing to stop itBut if it encounters a mound or any other impedimentbooboobooit bursts forthit overflows the country roundthrows down villages hamlets houses trees cows and lambs but remove obstacles which obstruct its course and it begins again softly and sweetly to flowthusthusthusthe fields are again adorned and every thing goes on as well as it can go onThus it is with the  Animal  Fluid which fluid obeys the command of my art  Doc  Surprising art but what are the means you employ  La Fluer  Merely gesturesor a simple touch  Doc  Astonishing give me some proof of your art directly do satisfy my curiosity  La Fluer  I willand by holding this wand in which is a Magnet in a particular position I will so direct the fluid that it shall immediately give you the most exeruciating rheumatism which will last you a couple of hours I will then change it to the goutthen to strong convulsionsand after into a raging fever in this manner shall your curiosity become satisfied  holds up his wand as if to Magnetise  Doc  Hold Doctor I had rather see the experiment on some one else  La Fluer  Oh then Sir I have now at my house a patient whom the faculty have just given up as incurable and notwithstanding his disorder is of a most violent and dangerous kind I will have him brought here and I will teach you to perform his cure yourself  Doc  By the power of Magnetism  La Fluer  By the power of Magnetism  Doc  That wou'd do me infinite honor indeedbut why bring him to my housepray who is he  La Fluer  A young man of quality  Con  Dear Sir let him be brought hither and let me see the cure perform'd  Doc  Takes  La Fluer  aside  I cant say I approve of a young man being brought into my housefor you must know Doctorthat young lady is to be my wifeas we are not exactly of an age another may make an impression  La Fluer  Consider my patent's state of health he is like a dying man  Doc  But he'll be well after I have cured him  La Fluer  Very true  Doc  wispering  La Fluer  Pray Doctor is it true what they report that he who is once in possession of your art can if he pleases make every woman who comes near him in love with him  La Fluer  Truecertainly it is  Con  Why this wispering I am ignorant what are the virtues of your art Doctor but I am sure it has not that of rendering you polite  La Fluer  Pardon madamI was but instructing the Doctor in some particulars of which you may hereafter have reason to be satisfied  Lis  I doubt that Sir unless your art cou'd render this solitary confinement we are doomed to agreable  La Fluer  Before the end of the day you shall prefer it to all the false pleasures of the gay world for what are more false than the pleasures derived from balls masquerades and theatres  Doc  Very true  Lis  Well I must own I love a Theatre  La Fluer  The worst place of all to frequentonce in my life I was present at a theatrical representation but such a piece did I see ah the most dangerous for a young woman to be present at  Lis  eagerly crossing  Pray Sir what was it  La Fluer  An honest Gentleman of about years age was before the audience in love with a young  lady of whom he had brought up from her infancy and whom he meant make his wife  Doc  Very natural  La Fluer  A young Gentleman of the neighbourhood because he was young rich and handsome imagined he would suit the lady better  Doc  Just like them all  La Fluer  He therefore disguifed his Valet who under the mask of friendship introduced himself to this good man the guardian  Doc  A villain he deserv'd to be hang'd  La Fluer  And seiz'd the moment when he embraced him as I now embrace youto stretch out his hand while it was behind him and convey a letter to the Lady's waiting maid  La Fluer  embraces the  Doctor  and exchanges Letters with  Lisette Lisette  gives the the letter she receives to  Constance La Fluer  puts the other into his pocket  Lis  And she gave him anotherI have seen the play myselfand it was very well acted  La Fluer  And is it not scandalous to put such examples before young people  Con  And pray Doctor do you think I am not under sufficient confinement that you take the same methods to make me still more unhappy  La Fluer  to the  Doctor  Why does your ward dislike confinement  Doc  Because she dislikes me  La Fluer  Are you sure of that  Doc  Yes I think I am  Con  I am dying with curiosity to read my letter  aside and exit  La Fluer  This wand shall cause in her sentiments the very reverse in this is a Magnet which shall change her disposition take it  gives the wand  and while you keep it she will be constrained to love you with the most ardent passion  Doc  I thank you a thousand times  quite in rapture  Lis  Excellent  Exit  Doc  Her maid has overheard us  La Fluer  No no but take me into another apartment and I will explain to you what at present you are not able to comprehendafter which you will permit me to step home and fetch my patient hither  Doc  Certainlywhen I am in possession of my ward's affection I can have nothing to apprehend from himAnd you are sure she will now become favorable to meyou are sure I shall attract her  La Fluer  Yes sureby the Loadstone  Exit  END OF ACT FIRST  ACT II  SCENE  Another Apartment in the  DOCTORS  house  Enter  CONSTANCE  and  LISETTE  Lisette  I Overheard it alland he has given your guardian the wand in which you heard him say the Magnet was contain'dand while he keeps it it is to Magnetise you and force you to love him in spite of yourself  Con  All this agrees with the letter he has given  me from his master in which the Marquis informs me by what accident that letter my guardian sent to the Doctor who professes Magnetism fell into his hands and immediatly gave him the idea of disguising his valet and sending him hither under the name of that Doctor but where is La Fluer now  Lis  Just left your guardian and gone home to bring the patient you heard him speak ofand I would lay a wager that very patient is no other than the Marquis himself  Con  But for what end is all this  Lis  That they have planned you may depend upon itfor the present you have nothing to do but to pretend an affection for your guardian  Con  It will be difficult to feign a passion my heart revolts at  Lis  Never fear your good actingbesides I will take equal share in it  Con  How you  Lis  I'll fall in love with the Doctor as well as youif the Magnetism affects youwhy not have the same power over me and if it makes you  love  him it shall make me  adore him  Con  Hush here he comes  Enter  DOCTOR  with the wand  Doc  aside  What he has told seems so very surprising that nothing but proofs can thoroughly convince meand now for the proof  locks at  Con  Lis  aside to  Constance  He ogles you cast a tender look and accompany it with a sigh  Con  Sighing  Alas  Doc  My dear Constance my lovely wardwhat what makes you sigh weariness of your confinement I suppose  Con  Ah Sir  fighing  Doc  Come come I confess the restraint you have been under has been too much and I am not surprised you have taken a dislike to me  Con  A dislike to youAh Sir  fighing  Oh guardian  going to speak turnsaway and hides her face  Dec  aside  I believe it will do Come come Constance do not sigh and make yourself uneasy you shall not live many weeks thus retir'd for I am thinking of marrying you very soon  turns eagerly to him  to a fine young Gentleman  turns from him  Con  Ah Cruel  near crying  Doc  What did you say if I have the good fortune to be beloved by you let me have the happiness to hear it from yourself  Con  Yes cruel mansome invincible power compels me in spite of my resistanceyesI love you  Lis  And I adore you  Doc  starting  What you too I did not expect that  Lis  No mine is not merely a love but a ragea violenceI doat to distractionlove you to the Joss of my health of spirits of rest and life  Con  If you do not take pity on the passion which burns in my heart  with tenderness  Lis  If you can be regardless of the flames which consume me with violence  Con  Can you be insensible of my tender pleadings  Lis  Take care how you turn my affection to hatred  Doc  goes from between them  aside  What a terrible situation I have got myself intothe effects of the Magnetism is very natural it acts upon one as well as another but Lisette's love is very troublesome I'll call Jeffry in and give up part of my power to him he wall take the wand for a shew minutes and charm Lisette  Con  Why do you thus run from me is this the return my love demandsbut be not uneasy death shall deliver you from an object whose passion you despise  turns from him  Doc  Oh that you could but read what is written in my heart  Lis  Ah Sir behold the state  kneels  to which you have reduced a poor inocent if I am treated with kindness I am naturally soft gentle and tender but if I am neglected  rising  by all that's great and precious I will do some strange thing either to you or my rival  Doc  This Lisette is so furious she makes me tremble I must put an end to her affection Jeffry  Enter  JEFFRY  Jef  Here Sir what do you want with me  Doc  Take this and carry it to my study  gives the wand  Jef  Yes Sirdirectly  crosses  Doc  Stop a moment Jeffry stop a moment  Jef  Two or three moments if you please  Doc  aside  Now we shall see what effect it has  Lis  to  Constance  I see through this design let us fall in love with Jeffry  Con  With all my heart  Doc  Well Jeffryandandhow do you do Jeffry  Jef  Pretty well considering my leg where the dog bit me and considering I can only see with one eye  Lis  But even that misforturne does not prevent your looking very agreable Jeffry  Doc  aside  It succeeds she's taken  Con  Who can resist that amiable figure dearest Jeffry  Jef  Ha ha ha ha ha  Doc  aside  This is as bad as the other  Jef  I think the mad dog has bit us all  Lis  Is it posible  you  can love Jeffry no no your situation forbids it take take my master I resign him to you  Con  No I resign him to you  Lis  I will not have him  Doc  This is a very disagreeble situation  Lis  Jeffry will you be deaf to my passion  Con  Yes I am sure he will prefer me  Jef  No I won't I have been in love with her this twelve months and I'll make choice of her  Con  Then what will become of me  Doc  I can bear this no longer give that  snatches the wand  And do you make up some medicines  Jef  Ah my dear Lifette you have made me so happy I must shake hands  offers to take her hand she slaps his face  Lis  Learn to behave with more reserve for the future  Jef  Ecod I think you have not behaved with much reserve did not you hang upon me and said you lov'd me  Lis  Love you behold my master and do not imagine I can love any but him  Con  No who can love any but him  Doc  This is worse and worsewhere is the Doctor if he does not come and give me some relief I am a ruined man  a loud knocking  Jeffry see if that is him  Exit  Jeffry  I have no doubt but it is and with him the young patient on whom I am to prove my skill Constance and you Lisette leave the room for the present  Con  Yes if you will go with me but how do you think it is possible for me to leave youa feeling which I cannot explain  Lis  And one I cannot explain  Doc  But I am going to prescribeand it is improper  Enter  LA FLUER  leading the  MARQUIS  dress'd in a handsome robe de chamber and night cap the  Doctor  draws the chair  La Fluer  This Doctor is your patientThis is the renouned physician from whom you are to expect a cure  Doc  He looks surprisingly well considering how much he has suffered  La Fluer  That renders his case the more dangerousI would rather a patient of mine should look ill and be in no danger than look well and be in imminent danger  Mar  To conceive the sufferings I have undergone a being must be transform'd he must be more before he can conceive what have feltfor months have I led this agonizing lifebut I am told Doctor you can put an end to my disorderyou have in your possession that which can give me easebut by what science you are master of so great a power I own is beyond my comprehension  La Fluer  Dear Sir you

authority with these females to leave us to ourselves  Con  I can't go  Lis  Nor I  La Fluer  I b  eve it is very true  goes and feels their pulses  no the can't gonothe force of the attraction will not suffer them to go  to the  Doctor  What do you think of the power of Magnetsm now  Doc  It has double the power I desire and I wish it not to  act  on Lisette  Con  to  Lis  I hope the Marquis is not really ill  La Fluer  I will remedy that  whispers the  Doctor  while the  Marquis  makes signs of love to  Constance  she gets nearer to his chair  now attend to what I am going to do I will turn the whole affection of the maid upon myself  Doc  I will be very much oblig'd to you  La Fluer  wispers the  Doctor  again  Mar  in a lwo voice to  Constance  One word only will you be mine shou'd my scheme prove successfull  Con  What is it  Mar  I have no time to say but answer me will you be mine  Con  I will  Doc  in a low voice to  La Fluer  Very well extremely well this will do very well and now deliver me from her love as soon as you can  La Fluer  I must approach her and 'tis done  goes to  Lisette  makes signs of Magnetism then in a wisper  I am inlove with you seign to be so with me  Lis  I am in carnest without seigning  La Fluer  So much the better it will appear more natural  returns to the  Doctor  It's done observe how she looks at me  During this the  Marquis  and  Constance  are exchanging sighs  Doc  What an art  La Fluer  But I will shew its power in a manner yet more astonishing  Con  to the  Marquis  in a low voice  I was on the point of being married to my guardian  Doc  Is it possible  Mar  forgetting himself and in warmth  Distraction that must never be  Doctor  turns to him in surprise  Lisette  p  ceiving  Lis  Oh heavens look to the patient  La Fluer  of his

detestable heart come on monster and acknowledge thy conqueror expiring under this hand  Doc  I'll go into the next room it is me I believe he has a mind to kill  La Fluer  But he has no weapon don't be afraid  Con  to  La Fluer  Oh dear Sir relieve him from this terrible fit  Doc  Do I beg you will  La Fluer  I cannot wholly relieve him at present but you shall see me change the manner of his ravings behold my power  pretends to magnetise  See his countenance changes his looks express tenderness now it is no longer fury that transports him but the soft languor of love now pervades his senses  Mar  looking at  Constance  Oh charming Arpasia  La Fluer  Arpasia was the name of his first love he fancies himself near to her  Marquis  rises from his chair and kneels to  Constance  Mar  Is it you then whom I behold but alas you do not suspect what I have suffered in your absence and I only retain my lise in the pleasing hope of one day passing it with you and rendering yours as happy as my own what am I to think of this silence you do not answer to my tender complaints Ah you hate me▪  u despise me b  t dread the effects of this  ▪ I feel that it is in my power to accomplish all  ▪  sing  Lis  He is a going into his roving fit again pray madam speak to him if it is but a  ord  Mar  Speak to me one word if it is o  ly one word  La Fluer  Your ward is afraid of dis  iging you but give her leaf to speak to him if  one word only to be witness to a scene so novel    La Fluer  Pshaw pshaw she looks at you for consent tell her she may say yesjust yes  Do  But why suffer her to speak  La Fluer  Consider you are in possession of the Magnet and nothing can prevent the power of that charm  Mar  Ah cruel ought I thusto wait for a word from those lips you wish then to behold me die  Doc  Well well answer him yes  Mar  Do you love me  Con  Yes  Mar  kisses her hand  I am transported  Doc  endeavouring to separate them  Hold hold this is a fit as powerful to me as it is to you  Lis  Dear Sir let him alone he may fall into his rage again  Mar  What thrilling transport rushes to my heart all nature appears to my ravished eyes more beautiful than poets ever formed his Aurora dawns the feather'd songsters chant their most melodious strains the gentle zephyrs breath their choicest perfumes and the inspiring scene intoxicates my very soul  Doc  Come change this fit into another  Mar  And you who listen to me partake my joy come and dwell with me under the shady branches of the river side come lovely shepherdess  takes hold of  Constance  come young shepheard  takes hold of the  Doctor  mingle in the dance  Lif  Come young shepherd  takes hold of the  Doctor  with one hand then  La Fluer  with the other  Doc  I can't dance  Man  In vain you refuse press with gentle steps the mossy banks and join in the rural pastime  takes  them round the stage and exit the  Doctor  awkwar  and unwillingly  END OF ACT SECOND  ACT III  SCENE  The  DOCTOR's  House  Enter  LISETTE  and  LA FLUER  Lisette  BUT when is this farce to end  La Fluer  My master now he is introduced will take advantage of some circumstances to obtain either by force or stratagem the Doctor's consent to his wishes and as he finds he is beloved by the young lady which before he was in doubt of  Lis  Pshaw he might easily have guessed her sentiments A young woman weary of confinement as she was is easily in love with the first young man who solicits her affections  La Fluer  And may I hope you love me  Lis  Aye Sir I am weary of confinement like my mistress  La Fluer  A thousand thanks my dear Lisette  Lis  But while Jeffry keeps the keys of every door no creature can either go out or enter without his leave  La Fluer  And is there no way to get rid of him  Lis  Yes a thought strikes me this moment a couple of days ago one of our neighbours dogs bit him and our doctor merely to shew his skill in the cure persuaded him the dog was mad suppose we make the Doctor himself believe he was really so and that poor  Enter  DOCTOR  Doc  He has had another fit but I have just now  left him in a sound sleep which come upon him as suddenly as any of his waking paroxysms  La Fluer  If that is the case he must be left alone we will not disturb him  Lis  aside to  La Fluer  When I return be sure to confirm whatever I shall say  Doc  What have you persuaded her to leave you▪  La Fluer  Yes for a little while  Doc  Why too much of love is something tedious I come once more to talk with you Doctor upon this surprising art which though you have taken such great pains to explain I am still far from comprehending so much as I think I ought  La Fluer  I will before long give you such proof  Enter  LISETTE  followed by  JEFFRY  Lis  O save me save me or I am a deal woman  Doc  What's the matter  Jef  This is no joke and I won't take it as such  Lis  goes between  La Fluer  and  Doctor  Have a care of him speak low he'll be at us  Doc  Will be at us  Lis  in a low voice  Jeffry is mad  Doc  What do you say  Lis  I found him in his bed gnawing the bed clothes and when he saw me he wou'd have gnawed me too  the  Doctor  turns to him  don t look at him Sir don't look at him  Doc  Why I don't think this possible the dog that bit him was not  Lis  Indeed Sir he was as mad as ever  La Fluer  Indeed the poor creature looks as if some horrible infection had seized him  Doc  Why I can't say but I think he does  Lis  And I'll give you the true proof immediately  takes a glass of water and throws it on him  Jef  What's that for how dare you use me thus  in great
