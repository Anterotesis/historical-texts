 THE MERCER OR Fatal Extravagance BEING A TRUE NARRATIVE Of the LIFE of Mr  Wm DENNIS  MERCER in  Cheapside  LONDON  The Occurrences herein related are well worthy the Observation of the READER and proper to be Regarded by every Mechanick in  Great Britain  Written by Mrs CHARKE Author of the Life of  Henry Dumont  Esq  And Miss  Charlotte Evelyn  c c  LONDON  BAILEY PRINTER N  o    Leadenhall Street  THE MERCER OR Fatal Extravagance  _OF all the Follies and Vices incidental to mankind none can be deem'd more Contemptively Erroneous than that of Living beyond our Fortunes and running into expensive Dignities superior to the Sphere of Life in which Providence has placed us The World has been and daily continue to be convinced of the truth of this assertion yet so prevalant is this Folly I may call it even a Crime that either thro' weakness of Judgement or ill placed Ambition  very near three parts of the World are guilty of it to their own Prejudice and those whom they are concern'd with  The following Sheets contain a genuine Account of an unhappy instance of this kind and it's fatal consequences which give me leave to hope may happily prevent any future Ills of this Nature And tho' Histories are so commonly made the Entertainment of the Publick that Truth and Falsehood are equally regarded and past by by the Reader only as Fabulous but this Narrative has a Claim to Reflection as it Unfortunately happen'd in the Reign of King  Charles  the First and was the ruin of two worthy Families whose Branches are still in being one of whom gave me a sufficient Account as give them by Tradition and are now notwithstanding the length of Time since the dreadful event unhappy Sufferers thro' the Indiscretion of their Ancestors  In the foremention'd Reign there was a Gentleman whose name was  Weston  a worthy Person of a large Estate near the City of  Canterbury  who had been Father of many Children but it pleased Heaven to  deprive him of all except one Daughter his last born on whom he bestow'd all that a fond Fater could to make her a perfectly Accomplish'd young Lady As she was heiress to a very considerable Estate Mr  Weston  was resolv'd to Qualify her in such a manner as to double the value of her Fortune by instilling into her Mind such Principles as would not only secure her own Happiness but that of the Person who should be destin'd her Partner for Life  Her beauty Merit and Fortune from fifteen Years of Age assembled a numerous train of Admirers but as her heart was not affected by any of them 'till she was above seventeen her Father would not insist on a Union with any 'till she had met with the Man she thought she could be truly happy with rather preferring his Daughter's Peace of Mind than her interest as he could make a worthy Husband entirely easy in point of Circumstances whom gratitude as well as Love wou'd he conceiv'd compel him to use his Child well not only by the Possession of a blooming Amiable Creature but receiving an Advantage of Fortune the want of which has too often made way for a Fool while a Man of Sense has been deprived of  an Opportunity of tenderly making amends for  Deficiency  Among the number of Mr  Weston's  acquaint  he was Visited by one Mr  Dennis  of his a great Goldsmith in  LombardStreet  this Gentleman's Intimacy  to take with him to  Canterbury  his  nly Son accompany'd with his Daughte  agreeable young Lady and a school  of Miss  Weston's  as he had a very great Friendship for her Father he heartily wish'd an alliance between the two Families and as the two Ladies had contracted a very great Esteem for each other he thought his Daughter might kindly become her Brother's Advocate but that was entirely needless for the Moment Miss  Weston  and young  Dennis  met they received a Reciprocal Tenderness tho' each was ignorant of the effect of their Interviews at that time and secretly Languish'd for each other 'till Miss  Weston  in her private Conferrences with Miss  Dennis  innocently artlesly discover'd the passion she had for her Brother who had not fail'd before that time to make an open Declaration to his Sister of the fond Regard he conceiv'd at first sight  for her agreeable Friend This did not long remain a Secret in the Family for Miss  Dennis  immediately inform'd her Pappa who communicated the Affair to Mr  Weston  and in short with all due regard to the modest Fears of the Enamour'd young Lady the old Gentleman contriv'd very speedily to Crown the happy Lover's wishes by a Publick Solemnization of their Nuptials at  Canterbury  Cathedral  In a short time after Mr  Dennis  Set up his Son in a Silk Mercer's Shop giving him a Fortune of four thousand Pounds in ready Cash besides Two thousand more in Stock  Tho' this was a genteel Fortune 'twas unequal to the young Lady's whose Father gave her on the Day of Marriage ten Thousand Pounds in Bank Notes and at his Death left her ten Thousand more  In a few Weeks after the young couple were married they open'd a very Grand Shop in the City and Mr  Dennis  placed with his Son as his Foreman one Mr  Arnold  an elderly discreet Man who had serv'd in that  Capacity with young  Dennis  's master who having acquired a Competent Fortune left off Trade and retir'd into the Country  Mr  Arnold  was a worthy Man who having a very large Family and meeting with misfortunes in Trade was in his early Days so so unhappily reduc'd as to be oblig'd to throw up his Business that without Scandal or reproach he might do Justice to his Creditors tho' he himself suffered greatly from many to whom he had largely intrusted his Goods for very considerable sums  But as he was a Man of almost unprecedented Principles of honour he rather chose to lead a life of servitude than meanly buffet with ill fortune to support at best a broken Reputation  Young  Dennis  receiv'd his instructions in Trade from Mr  Arnold  who tutor'd him in so gentle a Manner it occasion'd a great Regard and Tenderness on both sides and gave the good Man such a power over  Dennis  that he strictly adher'd to what he advised or proposed and thought himself under a certain  obligation to pay him the Respect due to Father and was as fearful of Offending the Friendship of the one as of disobeying the Commands of the other  But Alass Time which brings forth all strange and unaccountable things wrought a fatal change in the disposition of this thoughtless young man who instead of following the worthy examples of his industrious friend soon after his kind father had settled him in such a manner as enabled him in a few years to acquire an immense fortune he grew tired of business and too fond of every pleasurable expence that could possibly Conspire to effect his ruin and destroy his fame the first step towards his destruction was to set up an equipage and furnish both his town and country house suitable to the dignity of a man of quality as the family increased as it did every year by the birth of a child additional servants were provided and every needful expence was swell'd into a superfluity  Among the rest of the follies he run into the encouragement of a set of hangers on who made him their daily bread was not the least  And the only virtue that remained untainted in him was a tender fondness for his wife and children which indeed each had an undoubted claim to the former for her uncommon merit in regard to her husband and the World in general the other from their inoffended innocence  Mr  Arnold  perceiving his master's growing ruin took upon him to use the Priveledge of friendship to warn of the dreadful consequences of persisting in a continuation of this course of life but he had the mortification to find him cold and unwilling to hear or regard the tender admonitions he frequently made use of  At last Mr  Dennis  who was ready dress'd for a journey to his country house one morning rang the bell at which summons a youth who was a turnover Apprentice to him instantly appeared and receiv'd an order from his master for Mr  Arnold  to send him up a bill or cash for fifty pounds instead of the money Mr  Arnold  sent his respects and that he would wait upon him himself in a few momets which accordingly he did carrying  with him his book of accompts instead of answering the demand made by the apprentice When Mr  Arnold  enter'd the room Mr  Dennis  perceiv'd the marks of real sorrow in his countenance which shock'd him but he still endeavour'd to hide it from the other and demanded the money upon which Mr  Arnold  look'd at him very stedfastly fetch'd a deep figh desir'd him to look over those accompts and judge how much reason he had to suppose that 'twas possible for him to expect such a draught to be answer'd and after shewing him the accounts which he knew he would himself inspect he sat down by him and with an almost broken heart insisting on his knowing the shameful misery he had reduced himself too and thus address'd him  "'Tis now Sir the seventh year of your marriage Six of which you have cruelly spent in the Perpretation of your ruin your wife's fortune and your own with your stock in trade inclusive is lavishly wasted in Extravagances far beyond your right to run into had you been possess'd of double the sum and give me leave to add that the figure you have  made in life has given such offence to people of superior fortunes it has lost you three parts of your customers and farther let me inform you sir those Persons who can afford to lay out large sums in your shop will naturally think it a high piece of presumption in you to put yourself upon a footing with them who are kind enough to lay out that with you for a support which you basely and luxuriously waste in needless and unwarrantable pleasures and unnecessary grandeur 'tis true Sir the character of a Gentleman can never be degraded by being a worthy tradesman but then the tradesman has no right to run into those excesses which even a man of Quality must blush at if he exceeds the limitation of his fortune Pardon me Sir for this painful friendly liberty but the concern I feel for yourself and family enforces me to tell you in the plainest terms you are absolutely undone  Mr  Dennis  was too sensible of the means he had used to prove the truth of his friend's assertion and conservently remained silent for some time at last conscious of his error he  broke through his confusion intreating Mr  Arnold  to conceal the dreadful situation of his affairs from Mrs  Dennis  who was entirely innocent and ignorant of them The fortune said he which she brought me obliged me in honour to regard it as a more than sufficient competence to support her without exposing her to the care and fatigue of my business and tho' I have thro' a mistaken pride and ridiculous ambition to set myself above myself undone my family she poor soul never was the least incentive to the ruin in which I have inconsiderately involv'd myself What shall I do the coach now waits at the door to carry her with my Sster to  Woodford  where we propose to remain 'till after Christmas but the concern I justly labour under renders me incapable of pursuing my intent or making any reasonable excuse to her for not going with her  Mr  Arnold  overjoy'd to find he had wrought such an effect on his mind promised to use his utmost endeavour to soften the rigour of his fortune and find an excuse to Mrs  Dennis  that should appear so plausible she should go to her country house without her  Spouse or the least suspicion of the cause that detain'd him  He had scarce told his master his design than Mrs  Dennis  enter'd the room and with her usual sweetness of temper fondly smiling on her husband tenderly accused him of delay informing him the coach had waited a considerable time and the little Pratlers waited with impatience for Papa to mount and set forward to  Woodford  Mr  Arnold  who was ever a sincere and valuable friend to prevent his friend's confusion directly told her he was fearful his master must follow her for he had receiv'd a letter to inform him Mr  Edgeworth  who was a Merchant and betroth'd to Miss  Dennis  was arriv'd from the  Indies  at  Gravesend  and lay there dangerously ill and intreated Mr  Dennis  to come forthwith to settle some affairs between them in regard to himself and his Sister but intreated a concealment of the danger he was in to Miss  Dennis  whom he lov'd more than life till either Death or a Recovery should make it necessary for her to know it  Mrs  Dennis  easily credited the report and testified a sincere concern for the news faithfully promising to keep the secret from her Sister and earnestly injoining her Husband to follow her with the utmost Expedition  He led her to the Coach and took leave when she was gone Mr  Arnold  assured him 'twas highly proper for him to abscond plainly proving to him his person was in danger if he remain'd at home a day longer adding that he had from time to time put off his Creditors partly with distributing money and partly by fair promises but that the demands were so great the cash was exhausted and their patience tired out therefore Sir said he let me advise you as your horses are now ready leave the Servants at home who were ready to attend you and take Mr William with you meaning the Apprentice you know he is an honest youth and loves you too well to betray any trust you repose in him and tho' I have endeavour'd to conceal your unhappy mismanagement from him as much as possible yet his constant assiduity in his business has laid open to him as much as painfully convinces him that all is not right  tho' he modestly conceals by even the most distant hints even to me that he knows any thing of the matter but his grateful heart hourly obliges him to remember your kindly preventing him from being turn'd over to Mr  Oswald  who would have made his life hateful to him as to his other apprentices and thinks he can never sufficiently repay the obligation you confer'd on him by your kind acceptation of him to serve the remaining part of his time with you  Now Sir added Mr  Arnold  wherever you please to go or whatever you think proper to transact you may safely trust him with and i'm certain he will with the utmost fidelity communicate it to me who will make it my immediate busienss to summon all your Creditors and if possible gain time enough by prudent conduct to retrieve all yet  Mr  Dennis  thankfully received Mr  Arnold  's friendly advice and set out with his young apprentice undetermin'd what course to steer but in the end he happen'd to stop at a lone genteel Inn upon  Blackheath  where after they had refresh'd themselves as it was  near town forexpedition's sake Mr  Dennis  concluded to make that house his repository till he heard what progress Mr  Arnold  had made in his affairs in London accordingly William was dispatch'd home to inform Mr  Arnold  where his master resided and continued for three days before he heard from his faithful friend who made the best use of his time to bring the creditors to a Composition but in vain the extravagant course of Life Mr  Dennis  had led and bearing himself with a losty pride by scarcely bargaining but referring it to Servants had so exasperated them they were resolved to put the Law in force against him to the utmost extremity and accordingly one morning the Shop had not been open above half an hour before there enter'd an execution against Body and Goods  All that Mr  Arnold  could do in this extremity was to send poor afflicted William with the following Letter  SIR  I Need not apologize for my silence these three Days past as I have been carefully employ'd with the strictest diligence to accommodate your affair which was the only motive for my keeping you in suspence as I could not part from poor William whose business it was to keep at home while I was encountering a set of inexorable wretches who notwithstanding their good opinion of me was deaf to all I propos'd But alas how shall I express the Grief of heart I sustain in being oblig'd to excite the same distress in you By informing you your effects were this day fiez'd on and your person equally liable had not you taken my advice by your present concealment which is the only consolation I can possibly receive in this dreadful exigence I am under such confusion and concern I can only injoin you to send back the melancholy Messenger with utmost haste to  Sir  Your truly Afflicted and Obedient Servant Samuel Arnold  PS  my mistress sent the Groom to know the reason of your absence but I fram'd such an excuse in it she can't in the least suspect the occasion and I am inform'd your Father is going down to morrow on particular Business to you but what it is I am yet to learn  Mr  Dennis  for some few moments remain'd unable to express his grief but by his looks and the poor faithful Boy who brought the unwelcome News was equally incapable of uttering his concern till a flood of tears the dictates of his honest heart issued from his eyes and tenderly convinc'd Mr  Dennis  of the anguish of Soul the generous Youth endur'd for the wreck'd fortune of his unhappy master  Mr  Dennis  could not collect himself sufficiently to write and only sent the lad back again to Mr  Arnold  with his thanks for his care and concern assuring him that his only hope was death for his relief with this odd disjointed message the youth return'd to  London  Mr  Arnold  was concern'd but not much surpriz'd as he considered the dreadful Agitation or Mind this ungreatful Man must naturally feel from the result of his ungovernable Folly  In this Intervel of time Mr  Dennis  had sent word to his Daughter that he should pay her a visit and bring with him a person whom he said wou'd be no unwelcome Guest to the Family in General but not mentioning who it was they could not conceive who it should be however at the time appointed Mr  Dennis  arrived at  Woodford  accompanied by his worthy Friend Mr  Edgeworth  who naturally on his arrival paid his first compliments to his intended Father in Law who inform'd him his beloved  Harriet  was gone to his Brothers Country House to pass the Christmas there and that if his impatient Desire to see his betroth'd Spouse could hold out till the day following he would with pleasure attend him thither Mr  Edgeworth  was oblig'd in Complaisance to Mr  Dennis  to wait a few Hours which the fond Imagination of seperated Lovers lengthen into Ages However away they went next Morning and  to the inexpressible Surprize of Mrs  Dennis  and her Sister  from various motives  who should they behold but Mr  Edgeworth  Mrs  Dennis  did not know whether she should Congratulate him on his Recovery of his Health as well as his return to  England  ae she saw nothing in his Countenance that bore the least Appearance of the violent and dangerous Indisposition describ'd by Mr  Arnold  what to think she know not but the poor Lady began to grow excessively uneasy when upon asking her Father in Law when she saw Mr  Dennis  who replied not for several Days past but concluded to have found him with her and farther enquiring how long Mr  Edgeworth  had been landed and being inform'd but the day before she began to be extreamly uneasy as Mr  Arnold  's Letters to her had been still a Confirmation of his being with the very Gentleman who was then present and so far from stopping at  Gravesend  they never quitted the Ship till they got to  Deptford  where she then lay Mrs  Dennis  retir'd to write during which Time Mr  Edgeworth  renew'd his Addresses to Miss  Harriet  and the Sunday following was fix'd for the Wedding The Generous Lover  made a voyage extraordinary to make himself a more acceptable match for the young Lady and happily succeeded in his design by bringing home in his last adventure as much as compleated with what he had got before A Thirty Thousand Pounder Mrs  Dennis  dispatch'd a servant to  London  with all imaginable haste and tho' full of distracted thoughts on her Husband's account behaved with infinite good Breeding and as much seeming chearfulness as her anxious thoughts could possibly admit  The unhappy Mr  Dennis  remain'd in a most disconsolate condition at  Blackheath  and reflecting on the sorrow he knew his poor Wife must endure when she should become acquainted with his miserable Circumstances and the pain of separation from her drove him almost distracted in the violence of his agony he had been two or three times overheard by his Landlord to exclaim against himself and urge the heniousness of his crime in the strongest Terms and vowing ven+geance on himself for being the cruel Author of those Ills he was too sensible his dear Wife and little Innocents too soon would feel the dreadful effects of  The Landlord to whom he thought himself a stranger broke in upon his Grief and greatly apologizing for his intrusion begged his permission to endeavour to assuage the extremity of his uneasiness by unfolding the real cause of his assuring him to the extent of his Power he would be of service to him at the same time giving him to understand he was no stranger to his Person This alarmed Mr  Dennis  as he wished to be concealed and telling the Landlord as he had the advantage of him begged to know when and where he became acquainted with him upon which the other withdrew and in about ten minutes sent in the following Letter directed to Mr  Dennis  SIR  AS I am assured tho' you are lately become an unfortunate Man I am convinced you are a man of honour and as I am truly concerned for an injury I did you two years ago by stopping you upon Enfield Chase I have enclos'd two Bank Notes of a hundred Pounds each which is the exact sum I enforc'd from you My Success on  the road has enabled to quit it yet methinks I should be sorry Mr  Dennis  should be distressed when his natural Courage and a small share of resolution may repair his Fortune as it has done that of his obliged and real Friend  PS  After this Confession of my Crime and kind commiseration of your Distress I need not Sir enjoin you to Secrecy or fear the consequences that might possibly arise from being in the power of one who is not possess'd of an equal share of honour with yourself  On Perusal of the Letter Mr  Dennis  was struck into astonishment and could not resolve within himself what Answer he should make to his Landlord's advice in order to repair his fortune for notwithstanding he had run thro' various Indiscretions he could not easily be subborned to part with his Honesty and purchase Wealth at the expence of Fame or the hazard of an Ignominious Death He was too sensible of the Sorrows he had drawn upon himself and Family without heaping more wretchedness upon them by an everduring Infamy therefore resolved not to listen to such a  flagrant piece of advice so called for the Landlord and thanked him for his concern assuring him the Secret should be for ever buried in his Bosom but desired him never more to urge the Subject and that he would not be thought guilty of compounding with Felony insisted on returning the Notes which the Landlord begged he would not but the other insisted upon it upon which the Landlord as streniously insisted that he would make his House his own and as freely Command all that was in it Mr  Dennis  thankfully informed him that he was obliged to him for his offer but that he was under no necessity at that time to accept on it while they were conversing poor  William  arrived with the second shocking Account that the Creditors had sent their emissaries to  Woodford  and that they had even taken the Watch from Mrs  Dennis  's side so the sad Catastrophe was no longer a Secret to the whole Family  Old Mr  Dennis  was so violently exasperated he refused the least Assistance towards his Son's Redemption yet pitied his unhappy Daughter in Law and behaved very tender towards her and her Children as a fond Father  possibly could intreating her to go home with him and strongly urged her though 'twas his own Child to endeavour to forget him but her fondness was too powerful to listen to his Advice which in the mood the old Gentleman was in he order'd his Coach and went away highly displeased at his Daughter's refusal of his offer Mr  Edgeworth  who had a sincere regard for young  Dennis  which was greatly strengthened by the inviolate fondness he had for his Sister kindly and generously resolved to repair his Fortune by bringing his Creditors to a Composition or if that failed he resolved to pay his Debts and give him a Term of Years to make him an Acknowledgment  Miss  Harriet  took this as the highest proof of his Regard to her tho' she was sorty he should hazard any part of his Fortune to serve her Relation and that she wanted no such severe proofs of his Passion for her for such she term'd it as it was doubtful whether it would ever be in her Brother's power to make him a suitable return but these fears did not prevent his generous design which he put into immediate Execution the moment he got  to Town and with Mr  Arnold  's assistance every Creditor was paid to the full extent the amount of which came to upwards of Fourteen Thousand Pounds  Mr  Dennis  upon receiving the News of  Woodstock  being surrounded with his Creditors he grew desperate and madly and resolved to take the Advice of his Landlord who directly furnished him with Arms and a Horse that had been trained up to that Business and having dispatched  William  to Mr  Arnold  he set out and was not heard of for two or three Days in which time Mrs  Dennis  Mr  Edgeworth  Mr  Arnold  and Miss  Harriet  went down to bring him but to their great mortification he was gone before their Arrival which distracted his poor Wife who had plumed herself up with the hopes of being restored to her much lov'd Husband the Landlord told them it was possible he might return in a Day or two befori which he did not expect him but where he was gone he was entirely Ignorant  Mr  Edgeworth  prevailed on Mrs  Dennis  go to Town again faithfully promissing  her to go every Day in search till he found him which he did and in about four Days time Mr  Dennis  return'd to his Landlord's again and having met with great success in his new fatal Expedition he set out towards  London  and met a Gentleman on the Road within two miles of his Lodging and without any hesitation clap'd on his Mask and bid him Deliver which the Gentleman refusing he immediately shot him thro' the Head and robbed him of a considerable Booty among which was a Letter Case all which he rode hastily off with leaving the Deceas'd weltering in his Blood upon the Road the Body was soon found and carried into the first house to be owned and the Horse who stood by his dead Master was also convey'd thither  As soon as Mr  Dennis  got to the Inn where he had lodged from the time he went from his own house he directly sat down to count  Booty which in Cash was upwards of Twenty Guineas but on perusing the Letter Case and finding in it Receipts for his own Debts pay'd by his worthy friend and intended Brother in Law his Distraction consequently arose by an inexpressible height▪  there was no more room left for deliberate Reflection in so desperate a Case and Madness raging he directly snap'd a Pistol at his head which miss'd Fire and the Landlord coming that Instant into the Room he was prevented making a second attempt but within an hour was taken by some of the People who were sent out in search of the Murderer and the house which he was in being greatly suspected to be a Receptacle for highwaymen that was the first they routed nor had they much trouble in quest of their Man for he directly own'd the Robery and Murder quietly surrendering himself to the rigour of the Law the Penalties of which he thought too little for his Crime  As he had attempted his Life proper care was taken to prevent his destroying himself and as soon as he was committed to  Newgate  a sufficient Guard was set over him on that Account  Miss  Harriet  was directly seized with a violent Fever for the loss of an honourable Lover barbarously depriv'd of Life by the hand of her unhappy Brother whose shameful  End anticipitated the Decrees of Heaven in regard to both and in a few days gave a fatal Period to that young Lady who expir'd in the height of Madness  Mrs  Denais  had not so happy a Relief for she lingered in Anguish and Despair till the Morning her hapless Spouse was to be executed during whose Confinement she constantly attended him contrary to the Commands of his and her own Father who took the Children down into the Country that they might not be pointed at as the unhappy Ofsprings of their unfortunate Father what added to the immoderate Grief of this Inconsolable Creature was the knowledge of her Husband being Coddemned to be hung in Chains on Account of the Murder  The Night before his Execution she persisted in staying in the  PressYard  on the outside of the Cell where her destin'd Husband lay as soon as he was brought forth in the Morning in order to receive his Fate with speechless Grief she fell into his Arms with the tenderest Marks of deep and silent Sorrow  in this conflict of Despair and Love expired  This shocking scene drew Tears from each Spectator and sent the Dying Husband quite delirious to his shameful End Mr  Arnold  who at his request attended his last Moments soon after died with Grief And poor Mr  William  the Apprentice who had many Obligations to Mr  Dennis  grew into a settled Melancholly which he never overcame the Parents of this unhappy Couple lived but few Years after this dreadful Catastrophe one retire from Business and the other languish'd out a miserable Life at his country seat where he denied himself the benefit of Light from the fatal Hour of his Daughters Death  This Story is too True to be distrusted or Disregarded by the Reader or those who may hear it told and as every Person who breaths may be liable to the same dreadful Misfortune 'tis not to be deem'd an Offence to relate the sad consequences arising from Illplac'd pride and unreasonable Ambition The strongest Motive that could possibly induce me to publish this Melancholly was an Observation I  have made for many Years of the presumptiae Vanity daily increasing and prompting many Persons in Trade to live up to the State of those whose Birth and Fortune might justifie the running into such Expences as must naturally terminate in the Ruin of Trading Families and be the unhappy cause of Multiplying the numerous Indigent who but for this failing in Parents might live comfortably to themselves and be generally beneficial to the World  FINIS
