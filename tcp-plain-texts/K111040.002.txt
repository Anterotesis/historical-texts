Truth the Pomp attend  And deathless Honour to his Race descend  MEMOIRS OF Mrs  PILKINGTON  SO being entered on a new Scene I proceed I got as far as  Chester  but as it was Winter the Stage Coach set out but once a Week namely on  Mon∣day  and as I did not land till  Tuesday  I had near a Week to stay at an Inn an Expence my poor Pocket could not well afford But Providence sent me a timely Relief for as I was sitting with my Land∣lady by her Kitchen Fire a Gentleman came in who knew me he was going to  Ireland  and the Wind proving contrary  he was a Fellow Prisoner as I may call it with me and a very agreeable one he proved for he never permitted me to pay a Farthing My Landlady who was really a Gentlewoman and he and I di∣verted away the Time with Ombre Read∣ing and Pratling very tolerably And as the Gentleman knew my Misfortunes and had known all my Family he very gene∣rously and not without many Apologies gave me three Guineas a very seasonable Assistance Thus we may see that  Each good the virtuous Soul itself denies  The watchful Care of Providence supplies  By this I was enabled to travel I learned with great Pleasure that a Member of Par∣liament and two Gentlemen of the Law had taken Places in the Coach and hoped for an agreeable Journey but sadly dis∣appointed I was for certainly three such Brutes I never saw they affronted me every Moment because I was born in  Ire∣land  and I believe they had not the Cho∣lick for they made themselves very easy  But the worst Circumstance of all was that they used to sit up drinking all Night and forced me to pay my Club for their Wine though I never even saw it  They were great  Walpolians  and many a Trick in the Elections did they relate before me taking it for granted that I was a Fool At last they very civilly de∣manded of me what Business I had to  Lon∣don  So resolving to divert myself I told them I was going there in hopes Sir  Robert  would marry me this made them very merry they laughed at my Folly and I at theirs At length we picked up a  Welch  Parson of whom I had the Ho∣nour of making a Conquest which afford∣ed us great Entertainment for about fifty Miles I always permitted him to pay my Club but like a true Levite he began to offer a little more of his Civility than I was willing to accept of so finding that would not do he made me a Present of a Gingerbreadnut curiously wrapt up in white Paper and after making me give him a Promise to write to him he left us  As my FellowTravellers had observed his amorous Behaviour and saw him de∣liver his Present they earnestly requested to know what it was so to oblige them I shewed it When we came to  St Al∣bans  we were met by a Gentleman in a Coach and Six whom they stiled the great Mr  Midton  of  ChirkCastle  in  Denbigh∣shire  who was related to them all so they went into his Coach and I got two Fe∣male Companions However we all baited at the same Inn at  Barnet  and this prodigious Man insisted on having the Ladies for his Guests and laying hold of my Hand he swore that little  Hibernian  Nymph should dine with him so up Stairs we all went where he entertained us with an Account of his ample Estate saying it was much larger than the Duke of  Bedford  's but how unworthy he was to possess it the Sequel will shew  My Adventures with the  Welch  Parson made him laugh very heartily and he in∣sisted on my keeping my Promise in writ∣ing to him assuring me he would take care  the Letter should go safe So by way of Amusement I scribbled as follows  SIR  Your Gingerbread unbroken  Remains a true Love Token  I Am assured by your honourable Coun∣trymen that you pass for a Wit in  Wales  it is therefore my sincere Advice to you never to quit it lest the rest of the World should be malicious enough to re∣fuse you your due Praise As for the Favour you offered to me why you offer∣ed it like a Priest and I refused it like a Fool if you write to me direct To the Right Honourable the Lady  Wlple  in  Downingstreet Westminster  I will en∣deavour to prevail on my Spouse elect to send you a Fiddle and a Hogshead of good  October  to entertain your Parishioners every  Sunday  I am sweet Sir Crape Yours  Mr  Midton  said he thought I could read Men as well as Sir  Robert  But now  Came the Reckoning when the Feast was o'er  The dreadful Reck'ning and we smil'd no more  For our Grandee made us pay our Club 'tis true indeed he writ something to make me amends which was this  My Charmer  IF you will leave a Line for me at  Brownjohn  's CoffeeHouse in  Or∣mond Street  and give me a Direction where to find you you shall find a Friend in  J Mn  But really I never did so we parted and I never saw him more The Sample he had given of the Narrowness of his Heart was sufficient to disgust me and tho' I am not fond of making national Reflections yet I would of all things  never trust a  Welchman  lest as  Falstaff  says of the  Welch  Fairy he should trans∣form me into a Piece of toasted Cheese  At length I got to  London  where after having paid all Demands I had three Guineas left with which the next Day I took a Lodging in  BerryStreet St James  's  I wrote to  Ireland  to no purpose it seemed for I never got any Answer so in a very short Time I was in great Dis∣tress and knew not what to do Having heard Mr  Edd Wple  was a very humane Gentleman I wrote to him and he sent me a Letter in return wherein he promised to wait on me the next Evening and accordingly came nay and sate with me three Hours at the End of which Time he told me he did not know how he could possibly be of any Service to me I told him I had some Poems which I intended to print by Sub∣scription and if he would do me the Ho∣nour of promoting it it was all the Fa∣vour I desiredHe answered if he undertook it he should certainly neglect  it but however he would give me some Money so he pulled out his Purse and took out five Guineas Would not any Person have then thought themselves sure of them but according to the old Pro∣verb  Many a thing falls out between the Lip and the Cup  the Gentleman took a second Thought and put the Guineas in his Purse again assuring me it was not convenient for him to part with them  And indeed I believe he is a Beast without a Heart for this is his constant Answer to every Person as I have fre∣quently observed when those whom he chose for Friends and Companions wanted but the smallest Assistance from him So he  For Poets open Table kept  But ne'er consider'd where they slept  Himself as rich as fifty Jews  Was easy tho' they wanted Shoes  Swift  On this I arose and told him as I perceived it was not in his Inclination to do  me any Service I would no longer take up his important Time and civilly dis∣missed him  Mr  Dodsley  ventured to print THE TRIAL OF CONSTANCY by which I got about five Guineas and a much greater Happiness the Favour and Friendship of the POET LAUREAT I was advised to enclose one of them to him which I did in as genteel a Letter as I knew how to write The good Gentleman came to visit me and did me every Act of Friendship in his Power it is to his un∣wearied Zeal in my Behalf that I owe that I yet live to thank him for  Had I not been by him supply'd  I must a thousand Times have dy'd  I must not here omit that when the Poem was published I enclosed two of them to Mr  Wlple  who wrote me a Letter of Thanks and that was all  Mem  he owes me Two Shillings  As I wanted to make Interest with the Great I took a Lodging in  St James  's  Street  exactly opposite to  White  's Choco∣latehouse where happening to see Capt  Meade  go in I wrote over to him and he was so kind to give me an Invitation to his House which was within a small Mile from  HamptonCourt  a delightful Walk through  BushyPark  leading to it This saved me a great deal of Expence for as the Parliament was now broke up  London  was quite empty and Mr  Cibber  being gone to  Tunbridge  I could not 'till the Return of Winter hope to gain any Sub∣scribers so I went into the Country with great Pleasure  The Captain had a very sweet Dwelling a pretty Wife and four lovely Children We went to Church the following  Sunday  Dr  Hales  was Minister of the Parish and it was customary with him whenever he saw a Stranger in his Congregation to pay them a Visit so after Evening Prayer we were honoured with his Company Capt  Meade  told him I was his Sister Parson and Sister Writer a merry Sort of an Introduction The Doctor asked me what I wrote and the Captain an∣swered  for me that I was going to pub∣lish a Volume of Poems by Subscription I told the Doctor my Writings might amuse but his made the World the wiser and the better as I had had the Pleasure of reading them I turned the Discourse to Natural Philosphy on which the Doctor gave us an Invitation to a Course of Ex∣periments the next Day Tho' nothing I then saw was new to me yet his Reflec∣tions on every Object were as by them he demonstrated the Divinity and wrapt in holy Extasy he soared above this little terrene Spot and like a true High Priest led his Auditors up to the Holiest of Holies  After this sacred Banquet with which my Soul was so elevated that I could not avoid paying him my Acknowledgments in I believe an enthusiastic Strain we walked into the Garden where we were entertained with some fine Fruit Cream Wine  c  a rural Collation  The Doctor asked me if I had any printed Proposals for my Poems to which he promised not only to subscribe himself but also to use his Interest for me I told  him I had and that I would give him some when I came to Prayers the next Morning  But I could not sleep all Night so at Daybreak I arose and walked into  BushyPark  I sat down by the Side of a fine Cascade and listened to the tunefullyfall∣ling Waters so long that methought they became vocal and uttered articulate Sounds 'till lulled by them I fell in∣sensibly asleep when suddenly I imagined the WaterNymph to whom this Spring belonged arose before me with a lovely Countenance and a transparent azure Robe and putting a Paper into my Hand disappeared I thought I read it and as I presently awoke I remembered all the Lines so having a Pencil and Sheet of Paper in my Pocket I wrote them down  To the Reverend Dr  HALES  HAIL holy Sage whose compre∣hensive Mind  Not to this narrow Spot of Earth confin'd  Thro' num'rous Worlds can Nature's Laws explore  Where none but NEWTON ever trod before  And guided by Philosophy divine  See thro' his Works th' Almighty Maker shine  Whether you trace him thro' yon rolling Spheres  Where crowned with boundless Glory he appears  Or in the Orient Sun's resplendent Rays  His setting Lustre or his Noontide Blaze  New Wonders still thy curious Search at∣tend  Begun on Earth in highest Heav'n to end  O while thou dost those Godlike Works pursue  What Thanks from Humankind to Thee are due  Whose Error Doubt and Darkness You remove  And charm down Knowledge from her Throne above  Nature to Thee her choicest Secrets yields  Unlocks her Springs and opens all her Fields  Shews the rich Treasure that her Breast contains  In azure Fountains or enamell'd Plains  Each healing Stream each Plant of vir∣tuous Use  To thee their Medicinal Pow'rs produce  Pining Disease and Anguish wing their Flight  And rosy Health renews us to Delight  When You with Art the Animal dissect  And with the microscopic Aid inspect  Where from the Heart unnumber'd Ri∣vers glide  And faithful back return their purple Tide  How fine the Mechanism by Thee dis∣play'd  How wonderful is ev'ry Creature made  Vessels too small for Sight the Fluids strain  Concoct digest assimilate sustain  In deep Attention and Surprize we gaze  And to Life's Author raptur'd pour out Praise  What Beauties dost Thou open to the Sight  Untwisting all the Golden Threads of Light  Each Parent Colour tracing to its Source  Distinct they live obedient to Thy Force  Nought from Thy Penetration is con∣ceal'd  And LIGHT Himself shines to Thy Soul reveal'd  So when the Sacred Writings You dis∣play  And on the mental Eye shed purer Day  In radiant Colours Truth array'd we see  Confess her Charms and guided up by Thee  Soaring sublime on Contemplation's Wings  The Fountain seek whence Truth eter∣nal springs  Fain would I wake the consecrated Lyre  And sing the Sentiments Thou didst in∣spire  But find my Strength unequal to a Theme  Which asks a  Milton  's or a Seraph's Flame  If thro' weak Words one Ray of Reason shine  Thine was the Thought the Errors only mine  Yet may these Numbers to thy Soul im∣part  The humble Incense of a grateful Heart  Trifles with GOD himself Acceptance find  If offer'd with Sincerity of Mind  Then like the Deity Indulgence shew  Thou most  like Him  of all his Works be∣low  After this pleasing Reverie I returned home and had sufficient Time to trans∣cribe the Lines fair and dress myself ere the Bell rung for Morning Prayer As we were coming out of Church I gave the Poem and some Proposals made up in a Pacquet to the Doctor who came in the Evening to visit us and brought an∣other Clergyman with him who was the Minister of  Henley upon Thames  they both subscribed to me and took a good many of the Proposals which they disposed of to Persons of Distinction  So having got a little Money and Capt  Meade  being commanded on Duty to the  Tower  for six Months we all came to  London  where finding my Lodging emp∣ty I once more returned to  St James  's  My good Friend Mr  Cibber  was my first Visitor He had got about four Gui∣neas for me and told me he was assured by a Gentleman of  Ireland  who frequented  White  's that my Husband was a Poet and that all I had to publish were only some Trifles I had stolen from him which had greatly injured me  "But said he to set that Right you must take some Subject that has never yet been touched upon dress it poetically and send the Lines to  White  's"  This was really a hard Task but as my Credit was now at Stake I was obliged to exert myself and the next Day sent him the following Lines  To Mr  CIBBER  WHEN You advis'd me Sir to chuse  Some odd new Subject for the Muse  From Thought to Thought unpleas'd I chang'd  Thro' Nature Art and Science rang'd  Yet still could nought discover New  Till happily I fix'd on You  Your Stoic Turn and chearful Mind  Have mark'd You out of all Mankind  The oddest Theme my Muse can find  Like other Men you nothing do  The World's one Round of Joy to You  The Wise the Weak the Sot the Sage  Your Hours can equally engage  Tho' Sense and Merit are Your Choice  You can with gayest Fops rejoice  Can taste them all in Season fit  And match their Follies or their Wit  Truth has in you so fix'd her Seat  Not all your Converse with the Great  Has yet misled you to Deceit  Your Breast so bare so free from Blame  Why sure your Heart and Tongue's the same  Most Hearts the harder grow with Years  But yours yet lends th' Afflicted Tears  Has Merit pin'd in Want and Grief  Your bounteous Hand has brought Relief  To you where Frailty shades the Soul  One shining Grace commends the whole  Can no Experience make you wiser  Nor Age convert you to a Miser  New too in other Points I find you  Where modern Wits are thrown behind you  Some praise a Patton and reveal him  You paint so true you can't conceal him  Their gawdy Praise undue but shames him  While yours by Likeness only names him  Not Wit that libels makes you grave  At what you smile my Sense wou'd rave  While jealous Bards by Dunces stung  With Verse provok'd aveng'd the Wrong  With an uncommon Candour you  Such Bards more humanely subdue  Calm and compos'd your conscious Spirit  Can celebrate with Praise their Merit  Thus yielding conquer for sure Nature  Must feel such Praise sting worse than Satyr  Still am I warm'd to sing your Oddness  Your Singularity in Goodness  When to the Wealthy and the Great  Adorn'd with Honours and Estate  My Muse forlorn has sent her Pray'r  Shunn'd were the Accents of Despair  'Till your excited Pity sped her  And with collected Bounties fed her  Chear'd her sad Thoughts like genial Spring  And tun'd once more her Voice to sing  Bear then her grateful Notes and be  Yourself her Theme and Harmony  Cou'd she like yours exalt her Lays  Polite Artificer of Praise  From the sweet Song you'd jealous grow  And guard the Laurel on your Brow  If which I know these Facts are true  Confess at least the Verse is new  That publicly speaks well of you  This met with a very favourable Recep∣tion and Mr  Cibber  shewed it to all the  Noblemen at  White  's as a Means to engage them to subscribe to me which to oblige him many of them did and to make it public Mr  Cibber  inserted it in a Pam∣phlet of his own called the  Egotist  or  Colley upon Cibber  The next Day a pleasant droll Gentleman who was so old that he had been Page to King  James  when he was Duke of  York  insisted on Mr  Cibber  's introducing him to me which accordingly he did This Gentleman who was a Colonel in the first Regiment of Foot Guards had by Nature all that Education gives to others neither had his Years in the least deprest the Vi∣vacity or Gallantry of his Spirit He said a thousand witty Things in half an Hour and at last with as great Gravity as his comic Face would admit of said that he wished I would take him into Keep∣ing I answered I had really never seen any Person with whom I was better enter∣tained and therefore if he would make over all his real and personal Estate to me and dispose of his Regiment and give me the Money I would keep him  out of it He swore a good Oath he be∣lieved me and liked me for my Sinceri∣tyI could relate a Number of pleasant Stories of this old Gentleman but as his Wit generally bordered on Indecen∣cy and sometimes on Prophaneness they are not proper for a female Pen  He used to hire me to write Love Let∣ters to him which as a Proof of his being a young Man he shewed at  White  's Lord  Wmth  was curious to see the Writer upon which he brought his Lordship and Lord  Augstus Ftz Ry  since dead to visit me They bantered me on my Taste in writing so many fine Things to an old Fellow when so many young ones themselves in particular would be proud of themI assured their Lordships I would oblige them on the same Terms I did the Colonel who always paid me hand∣somely for my Compliments  This turned all their Raillery on the Co∣lonel who with great good Humour con∣fessed the Truth  "Why Colonel said Lord  Fz Ry  you told us you sup∣ported  this Lady"  "Ay returned he but you know I am an old Lyar"  The Noblemen insisted on my telling them how much a piece the Colonel gave me for writing Billetdoux to him The Colonel answered that his Money had been fatal to my Family for that he had lent my Uncle Colonel  Mead  twenty Guineas one Night at the Groom Porters who died the next Morning of an Apoplectic Fit and so said he  "out of pure Af∣fection to my dear little one here I am very cautious how I give her any be∣sides added he very archly I could not be convinced of the Sincerity of her Passion for me if she made any De∣mands on my Pocket"  Lord  Wmth  asked me how I approved of this Doctrine I answered the Colonel had so genteel and witty a manner of excusing his Avarice that should he ever grow generous we should lose a thousand Pleasantries  Each of the Noblemen gave me a Guinea by way of Subscription to my Poems they pressed hard on the Colonel  for his Contribution which for the Rea∣sons aforesaid he absolutely refused  This gave Occasion to the following Lines which lest the Colonel should not communicate I inclosed to Lord  FzRy  To the Hon Colonel  DNCBE  SINCE so oft to the Great of my Favours you boast  When you know you enjoy'd but some Kisses at most  And those as you say never ought to be sold  For Love's too divine to be barter'd for Gold  Since this is your Maxim I beg a Re∣ceipt  To know how without it a Lover can eat  For tho' the fine Heroes we read in Ro∣mances  Subsisted whole Weeks upon amorous Fancies  And yet were so strong if those Writers say true  That Dragons and Giants some thou∣sands they slew  Those Chiefs were of Origin surely divine  And descended from  Jove  as direct as a Line  But in our corrupted degenerate Days  We find neither Heroes nor Lovers like these  Our Men have scarce Courage to speak to a Lass  'Till they've had a full Meal and a chir∣rupping Glass  And so much in myself of the Mortal I find  That my Body wants Diet as well as my Mind  Now pray Sir consider the Case of your Mistress  Who neither can kiss nor write Verses in Distress  For  Bacchus  and  Ceres  we frequently prove  Are Friends to the Muses as well as to Love  Lord  Astus  did not fail to shew the Lines to all the Noblemen at  White  's who heartily bantered the Colonel on his Gene∣rosity to his Mistress  The next Day as I was sprinkling some Flowerpots which stood on very broad Leads under the Diningroom Window Colonel  Dncbe  the Duke of  Bltn  and the Earl of  Wnchea  stood filling out Wine and drinking to me So I took up the Pen and Ink full in their View and as I was not acquainted with any of them except the Colonel I sent over to him these Lines  YOUR rosy Wine  Looks bright and fine  But yet it does not chear me  The Cause I guess  Is surely this  The Bottle is not near me  You shew that Sight  To give Delight  If I may truly judge ye  But would ye move  My Wit or Love  I beg Sir I may pledge ye  Lord  Wnchea  bid the Colonel send me all the Wine in the House  "Ah said the Colonel that might in∣jure her Health but I will send her one Bottle of  Burgundy  to chear her Spirits"  Accordingly the Waiter brought it the Noblemen all gathered to the Window so he filled me out a Glass which mak∣ing them a low Reverence I drank and retired  But the Colonel resolving to have Share quickly followed his Bottle he came in a desperate ill Temper cursed the Kg D of  Cld  the whole My and me into the Bargain I asked him whether giving me a Bottle of Wine had grieved him so much He said No but that he had been fifty Years in the Army and was but Lieute∣nantColonel and that the D of  Cld  had put a young Fellow over his Head He pulled down his Stocking and shewed me where he had been shot through the Leg at the Siege of  Lisle  then he opened his Bosom on  which he had several honourable Scars and swore heartily that were it not in a Time of War he would throw up his Commission I could not but agree that his Resentment had but too just a Foun∣dation  "But dear Sir I had no hand in all this"  "No said he but I did not know any Person to whom I could speak my Mind freely or who would bear my Peevishness but you"  "Well Sir said I an you were as pee∣vish as an Emperor I'll bear it all since you please to bestow it on meBut I believe we had as good drink our  Burgundy  and we will new model the Government according to our Fancies"  He sat very pensive said his Head aked then rose in a surly Sort of a manner and went over to  White  's  Whether any thing he had met with there pleased him I know not but about Nine at Night as I sat writing I heard his Voice on the Stairs crying  "Poke after me my Lord poke after me"  So I bid my Maid light the Colonel up He brought with him his Grace of  Mlbgh  a lovely Gentleman he presented him to me by his Title which was honoured by his wearing it The D saluted me but what shall I now say I think my boasted Constancy of Mind quite forsook me I trembled at his Touch and though I knew not why was more disordered at Sight of him than ever I had been before in my Life The Colonel asked me what was the Matter I said I believed I had drank too much Tea which joined to the unex∣pected Honour he had now conferred on me put me into a little Flutter  His Grace laid hold of my Hand and kissed it saying it was the sweetest Thing in Nature to put a Lady into a little Hurry of Spirits  "and so said he Colonel I shall meet you at  White  's either tonight or tomorrow Morn∣ing for I have a mind to have a little Chat with this Lady alone"  The Colonel knew his Duty too well to disobey a  Mlbgh  and left us wishing his Grace Success  Now indeed for the first Time I was afraid of myself but was infinitely more so when his Grace told me he had learned from the Colonel that I was in some Distress and opening his PocketBook presented me with a Bank Note on Sir  Francis Child  for Fifty Pounds  This was the Ordeal or fiery Trial Youth Beauty Nobility of Birth and unsought Generosity attacking at once the most desolate Person in the World His Grace I believe guessed at my Ap∣prehensions by the Concern which was but too visible in my Countenance and generously assured me that he was above making any hard Conditions that I might look up with Chearfulness and not rivet my Eyes to the Floor but consider him as a sincere and disinterested Friend  This quite revived me and gave me an unusual Flow of Spirits which highly pleased my illustrious Benefactor He de∣sired I would write something merry to the Colonel who at his Departure charged me not to wrong his Bed So to please his Grace and also to convince him I  could write I gave him in about ten Minutes the following Lines  STREPHON  tonight his  Chloe  told  He had the Headach and grew old  Tho' well she knew her artful Swain  But counterfeited Age and Pain  To hide his cold declining Passion  His Want of Love and Inclination  For  Chloe  's Face so often seen  Put her poor  Strephon  in the Spleen  Nor could her Wit or Neatness please him  Or all her Smiles or Prattle raise him  He left the pensive Nymph alone  His painful Absence to bemoan  Strephon  beware lest in return  With a new Flame your  Chloe  burn  Consider I have  Spnr  seen  And quickly lay aside your Spleen  Or by the God of Verse I vow  With Antlers I'll adorn your Brow  No City Knight shall boast a Pair  More large more branching or more fair  Their Horns are gilt but yours shall be  As naked as a blasted Tree  So Sir no more of your Deception  For I am blest with quick Perception  Phoebus  has given me piercing Eyes  To look thro' Falshood and Disguise  Then lay aside this little Art  I have and I will keep your Heart  His Grace was very well pleased with my Gaity and undertook to deliver the Letter himself so we parted each of us I believe satisfied with ourselves and our own Conduct  I know at least I was for upon calling my Heart to account for the Trouble it had given me I found by the Symptoms there was something very like Love had seized it  The Colonel came in the Morning and brought with him Mr  Trvr  Brother to the Dss of  Mlbgh  whom he introduced to me and then merrily asked me if I was going to re∣ward his constant tender Flame with a  great staring Pair of Horns I told him he deserved them for his ill Temper but however as he made me full amends by the Honour of making me known to so great and good a Man as he had recom∣mended me to I would take some Time to consider of the Matter  Mr  Trvr  desired to know which of the  Spnr  's it was I threatned the Colonel with I told him I wrote any thing by way of Amusement but either of them would serve my Turn  The Colonel called me a merry Madcap Mr  Trvr  assured me he was at my Service and would hornisy the Colonel whenever I pleased I told him I was ob∣liged to him for his kind Offer and would certainly apply to him if I found myself in any Distress and in the mean Time I hoped as an earnest of his future Favour he would be so kind as to subscribe to my Poems which accordingly he did  My Readers may now imagine I was in a fair Way of growing rich but in∣deed it was far otherwise as I paid a Gui∣nea a Week for my Lodging kept a Ser∣vant  was under a Necessity of being always dressed and had besides so many distressed Persons of my own Country who did me the Honour to take a Dinner with me and in return for my Easiness said every thing of me which they thought could injure or expose me that being naturally liberal and till I heartily suffered for my Folly no very great Oeconomist I rather ran out than saved  And as I have thrown some Sort of Reflection on the  English  I must beg leave to be equally free with my own Country Folks Take Notice I except the Nobility and Gentry of each Kingdom who I real∣ly believe in Honour Valour or Genero∣sity of Spirit are not be matched in any Part of the habitable Globe Yet partial as I may be to my native Country the  English  and  Irish  seem to have different Characteristics The lower Part of the People of  England  are blunt and honest the lower Part of the People of  Ireland  civil and deceitful Nor did I ever suffer in  England  either in point of Fortune or  Reputation but either by the Thefts or the Tongues of the  Irish  My Landlady came up one Morning very chearful and told me her Daughter's Husband Dr  Trnll  who had not been to see her for two Years on account of some Difference they had told her he would as he was to preach at  St James  's Chapel next Day being one of the Chap∣lains to his Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales  take up his Lodging in her House that Night I congratulated hereupon it but observing by her Looks that she was under some Uneasiness I asked her the Cause of it after some Hesitation and a Number of Apologies she told me she had no Accommodation for him but by giving him her own Bed and begged I would for a Night give her leave to sleep with me and my Maid to which I readily con∣sented but recollecting what a miserable Bed she had in a dark Closet very unfit for a Gentleman to lie in I told her I would with great Pleasure leave my A∣partment for the Doctor which was as may be presumed by the Price a genteel  one and for a Night take up my Resi∣dence with her She seemed overjoyed at the Proposal and as I had some little Trifle to buy I went out and did not return till about Six in the Evening so not meeting any body in the Way below Stairs I went up to my own Apartment where I found the Doctor reading and the old Gentle∣woman fast asleep  I begged pardon for my Intrusion and the old Dame told him how much he was indebted to my Complaisance in quitting my Apartment to oblige him with it I could have wished she had been silent in this particular for as she had not apprized him of it before he was too polite to suffer it nor could any Entreaties of mine prevail on him to accept my Offer  Presently after being gone down Stairs he sent his Compliments up and begged I would lend him a Book to amuse him∣self till Bedtime so being willing to cul∣tivate the good Opinion he seemed to have conceived of me I sent him my own Po∣ems in Manuscript which pardon my Vanity did not fail to confirm it  The next Day which was  Sunday  as soon as Afternoon Service was over he very kindly paid me a Visit and seemed so well pleased with my Prattle that it was Midnight before either of us thought of Repose But I do assure my Readers his Motherinlaw kept us Company  He entertained me with an Account of whatever he had met with curious in his Travels His Remarks on every Subject were delivered with Modesty and Judgment in a flowing and elegant Style He was so kind to promise me the Favour of taking a Dish of Coffee with me in the Morning which produced a merry Adventure  The Noblemen at  White  's having heard that I was married to a Clergyman and seeing one walking to and fro in my Din∣ingroom supposed it must be the very identical Parson and that he was come to make up Matters with me so none of them would venture over lest it should incur his Displeasure against me but Colonel  Dncbe  whose Curiosity was up re∣solved at a Distance to reconnoitre the  Ground and bring them a faithful Account of the Enemy's Situation for so he stiled the Parson  There was a very grand Milliner's Shop next Door to my Lodging from whence I received a Message that a Lady just come from  Ireland  desired to speak with me upon which I immediately went full of Hope to receive some Account of my Children I there found the Colonel who told me he was the Lady and with his usual Gaity added that if I questioned his Sex I need but permit him to be my Bedfellow for a Week and I should never know any thing to the contrary  I answered I really believed him in∣asmuch as I had known a Gentleman young enough to be his Grandson who had lived with me in all the peacable Innocence of a Man of Threescore like a civil careless Husband as he was  As the Colonel was acquainted with my History he laughed heartily and said  "He must be some damned Parson for nobody said he but one belonging to  the Church could have had half that Continency But my dear little one for that was the Name he always called me I have some News to tell you I desire you may brush up your Counte∣nance your Fire and yourself because you are likely to have some very grand Visitors tomorrow no less than Mr  Sthe  the Earl of  Wnchea  and his Brother Mr  Fch  "  The Colonel then told me the Reason of his sending for me in that manner was that he had observed a Pason walking in my Room and asked who it was I told him it was Dr  Tbull  no way re∣lated to me  As this Adventure with the Clergyman afforded great Matter of Diversion at  White  's I cannot help here relating ano∣ther I was in very great Distress and was advised to apply to the then Lord Archbishop of  York  now by the Grace of God Lord Archbishop of  Canterbury  I say by the Grace of God because I be∣lieve he never was yet excelled by any of the primitive Bishops a Person in whom  the Beauty of Holiness fully appears I went to his House in  Kensingtonsquare  and to my infinite Surprize had free Ac∣cess to his Grace without even a Question being asked I presented him with the fol∣lowing Lines  This Poem was written just at the Begin∣ning of the Rebellion in which his Grace like a true Son of the Church militant had nobly taken up Arms in the Defence of Liberty Property and the Protestant Reli∣gion  Having been obliged to the Right Ho∣nourable  Henry Pelham  I thought it not improper to include two such great and eminent Persons in one Poem which was as follows  To his Grace the Lord Archbishop of  YORK  AS God who now does as in Times of old  His high Behests to righteous Men unfold  And from thick Mists purging the visual Ray  Beams on his chosen Sons celestial Day  Late to the pious Prelate YORK re∣veal'd  What from the Sons of  Belial  lay con∣ceal'd  The Many flown with Insolence and Wine  Unfit such Ears to hear of Things Di∣vine  Behold oh chosen Messenger of Grace  Said God the Wickedness of human Race  Britain  behold my oncelov'd fav'rite Isle  Lo all Impurities her Face defile  Why are there Pray'rs or public Fasts proclaim'd  My Pow'r is mock'd at and my Word blasphem'd  Think they vile Worms with Arts or glossing Lines  To 'scape my Vengeance or deceive my Eyes  No as to Idol Lusts their Bodies bow  So shall their Limbs the foreign Fields be∣strew  Nay ev'n the proud Metropolis shall feel  The redhot Vengeance and the mur∣d'rous Steel  Then holy YORK the Lord of Life bespoke  Oh gracious God this dread Decree re∣voke  Wilt Thou with Wisdom Justice Mercy crown'd  Alike the Virtuous and the Vile con∣found  Twenty perhaps in  Britain  may'st Thou find  Who keep thy Laws and write them on their Mind  All sure shall perish by thy mighty Word  But wilt Thou speak in Wrathfar be it from Thee Lord  To him JEHOVAH By Myself I swear  For Twenty's Sake the Kingdom will I spare  Oh be not angry while I plead again  Perhaps not Twenty may be found but Ten  Ten Men whom no Temptation can sub∣due  True to Religion to it's Altars true  To him JEHOVAH As thy Soul doth live  Find me but One and  England  I forgive  View then oh Lord yon Minister of State  See him in ev'ry Action Good and Great  Stemming Corruption with an out∣stretch'd Hand  Who but Himself the Torrent can withstand  See Him like  Nile  diffusing Bounty round  To bless a barren an ungrateful Ground  Thro' various Channels Pleasure to impart  To raise the Fall'n to chear the dying Heart  Too oft alas in the translucent Wave  Do Crocodiles and wily Serpents lave  Studious to poison the delightful Stream  Which unpollute flows onand mindful whence it came  Conscious of Thee it's sacred hidden Source  To reunite thy Bounty bends it's Force  Wisely thou speak'st the living Lord reply'd  Nor be thou righteous Advocate de∣ny'd  Superior Worth arrests the lifted Rod  So dear is Virtue in the Sight of God  Nor will I Vengeance on the Guilty take  But  England  spare for YORK and PELHAM's Sake  I told the Servant when I delivered them it was not a Petition He said if it were his Grace never refused one and shewed me into a handsome DrawingRoom In a few Minutes his Grace en∣tered with a sweet and placid Air but looked so young that I never once ima∣gined him to be the Archbishop having joined the associate Idea of Wrinkles Ava∣rice and Pride to that Titlein which I found myself happily for once mista∣ken As it was early in the Morning he  said he was sure I had not breakfasted and bid one of the Servants bring some Tea and desire his Cousin to come and keep the Lady Company As it was near half an Hour before I saw her his Grace asked me who I was I answered which was Truth I was a Gentleman's Daugh∣ter of the Kingdom of  Ireland  that I had when I was very young been married to a Clergyman that I had three Children living His Grace taking it for granted that I was a Widow which Mistake it was by no Means my Interest to clear up demanded of me what I had to sup∣port us I answered Nothing but Po∣etry He said that was a Pity because let it be ever so excellent Genius was sel∣dom rewarded or encouraged I very gayly repeated the Dean's Lines  What Hope of Custom in the Fair  When not a Soul demands the Ware  When you have nothing to produce  For private Life or public Use  Swift's Rhapsody  His Grace could not avoid smiling as he plainly perceived by the Chearfulness and Freedom of my Behaviour and by my only saying Sir to him that I was igno∣rant of his Dignity But the Entrance of his Relation a wellbred Lady of about fifty Years of Age who as his Grace is a Batchelor managed his domestic Affairs threw me into inconceivable Confusion as I then plainly perceived I had been very familiarly chatting with so great a Man  I made my Apology in the best Man∣ner I could and as he was truly sensible that I neither intended or meant Disre∣spect to him he easily pardoned me But as we drank Tea said he wished my Mistake had but continued a little longer that he might have had the Pleasure of hearing me unawed and uncontrolled I own I was quite abashed at so odd a Cir∣cumstance for while I imagined his Grace to be perhaps a Chaplain to the Lord Archbishop of  York  I said any thing without Reserve but of a sudden found my Spirits fail which brought  Shakespear  's Lines into my Mind  And what have Kings that Privates have not too  Save Ceremony general Ceremony  And what are thou thou Idol Ceremony  What kind of God art thou that sufferest more  Of mortal Griefs than do thy Worship∣pers  What are thy Rents What are thy Comings in  Oh Ceremony shew me but thy Worth  What is thy Soul of Adoration  Art thou aught else but Place Degree and Form  Creating Fear and Awe in other Men  Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd  Than they in fearing thee  His Grace was so humane to make me a handsome Present at my Departure and assured me he would always be a Friend to me  However I did not make a second Ap∣plication to him 'till such Time as the Royal Bounty is to be petitioned for  is at  Christmas  though it is not distributed 'till  Easter  As I knew at that Season of the Year it was impossible for me to be at  Kensington  e'er his Grace would be at  Westminster  I waited at the Door of the RobingRoom 'till I was almost frozen holding a Petition inclosed in a Letter in my Hand a Gentleman who is Doorkeeper to the House of Lords taking Compassion on me told me I had better come into the Lobby an Offer I readily accepted of and sat down in a Window There were several Noblemen most of whom knew me by Sight walking in it as the House was not yet met The first Prelate who entered was the Lord Bishop of  Norwich  a venerable Gentleman whose graceful grey Hairs the Hand of Time had silvered As he past by I made him a Courtesy on which he stopt and with great Civility asked me if that Letter was for him I answered it was for his Grace of  York  on which he very kindly wished me Success His Grace next entered and with his wonted Goodness asked me where I had been Adding that it had  been a great Loss to me that he did not know where to find me and accepting of my Letter said he hoped I had there given him a proper Direction so bowing as fast as I courtesied he went to take his Seat at the Right Hand of that Power he had so nobly supported and no doubt will at the last great Day having truly approved himself  Christ  's faithful Soldier and Champion fighting under the sacred Banners of the Captain of his Salvation hear those comfortable Words  Well done thou good and faithful Servant enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord  As the Earl of  Chsterld  heard every Word his Grace spoke to me he made himself very merry at  White  's telling Mr  Cibber  and Colonel  Dncbe  that I was true to the Gown and delivered a Billetdoux to the handsomest politest and bravest Prelate in  Europe  that I had given him a Direction where to find me and highly applauded my Choice  But no Virtue is above the Reach of a little pleasant Raillery and as some of the Noblemen demanded an Explanation  of this Affair I with my usual Sincerity told them the Truth on which they all agreed in praising his Beneficence and Af∣fability and the handsome Manner in which he bestowed his Bounties  I hope if these  Memoirs  should ever fall into his Grace's Hands who is an uni∣versal Reader he will pardon me for using his Name which I shall never do but with the utmost Respect and Gratitude  As I had imagined his Grace to be Lord High Almoner I addressed him as such and waited on him again at  West∣minster  his Grace told me the Bp of  Sy  had been so kind to accept of my Petition and that I must wait on him the next Morning at his House in the  Temple  So accordingly I went in full Spirits imagining on the Recommenda∣tion of so excellent a Person I should both have a civil Reception and also my Desire answered  It snowed very fast and I knocked se∣veral Times e'er I could gain Admis∣sion at length an old Porter ventured to turn the unoiled Hinges a little which  grated very harshly and seemed to par∣take of the Spirit of their unhospitable Master who according to my Country∣man's Bull opened the Door to keep the People out for this was fully verified here he asked me what I knocked so often for and being I suppose doubtful that I might steal one of the Oak Chairs in the Hall shut it again in my Face the Inclemency of the Air and the Vexa∣tion of my Mind made me give a thun∣dering Rap the Door was once more opened and I assured the Porter if he would be so kind as to deliver that Letter for me to his Lord to whom I was re∣commended by his Grace of  York  I would give him Half a Crown which Promise of a Perquisite softened him into Consent for as Mr  Gay  observes  This Reason with all is prevailing  He took the Letter into the Parlour when presently an old Man with a most unprelatical Countenance for it was full of Carbunckles and Knobs and Flames of  Fire came out with my Letter in his Hand and with an imperious Voice de∣manded of me whether I wrote it As the Times were full of Violence and Blood it being as I observed at the Beginning of the late Rebellion I stood confounded and knew not what Answer to make which he observing asked me was my Name  Meade  To which an∣swering in the affirmative he cried  "Yow are a Foreigner and we have Beggars enow of our own"  "No my Lord returned I I was born in  Ireland  which is not a foreign Country but equally a Part of his Majesty's Dominions with  GreatBritain  "  "Why said he very politely you lye but as you say yow are in Distress there's Half a Crown for yow"  I thanked his Lordship and turning to the Porter told him as I had given him some Trouble I hoped he would accept of that Part of the Royal Bounty which had been promised to me his Lordship was pleased to tell me I was a saucy proud impertinent Person which  having neither any farther Hopes or Fears about him I little regarded  All the Way Home as cold as it was and as much vexed as I was at the old Brte's Behaviour I could not avoid laughing at his odd Figure so much re∣sembling that of the  Spanish  Friar where  His great Belly swaggered in State before him and his little gouty Legs came limping after oh he is a huge Tun of Divinity and were he any way given to Holiness I would swear by his Face my Oath should be By this Fire but he is indeed but for the Fire in his Face the Son of utter Dark∣ness oh he is a perpetual Triumph an everlasting Bonsire  Then again I thought of Dr  Swift  's Lines  Gd dn me they bid us reform and repent  But Zds by their Looks they never keep  Lent  I hope the Reader will pardon me for inserting Oaths as I have so great an Au∣thority to quote for them  As the Parliament did not sit during the Holydays I waited on his Grace of  York  who immediately gave me Audience He asked me what Success I had with the Lord Almoner and as I had sped mar∣vellous illfavouredly I related every Cir∣cumstance as near as I could remember of our Conversation One in particu∣lar which I before omitted and was that he said  "Would the Lord Arch∣bishop of  York  speak to yow Woman"  His Grace smiled and said  "It was the first Time he ever learned it was beneath the Dignity of a Bishop to speak even to a Beggar as Humliity was their best Orna∣mentWell What more"  "Not much my Lord only he demanded If I knew no other Person besides your Grace to recommend me to him And as I really was convinced I had brought him my Credentials from the highest I did not use any other Name"  By this Time the Lady beforementioned came to Breakfast and I was obliged to relate the Story to her they both laughedand his Grace assured me the Bp of  Sy  was a very honest ManI told him  "I did not suspect him to be a Pickpocket but that I looked on that to be but a very moderate Praise where every other social and Christian Virtue was required"  He said I made nice Dis∣tinctions but he himself would take Care of the Affair and so he put a couple of Guineas into my Hand on which I said  "God Almighty bless your Grace"  which again made him smile and myself also on Reflection that instead of im∣ploring his Blessing I had given him mine I returned to  London  as I ought also from this long Digression to relate what passed between me and the Noble∣men whom Colonel  Dncbe  said would come and visit me  When I expected three but one came a very old gouty Gentleman whose Name I do not think proper to insert the rest  had intended me the same Favour but he insisted it seems on coming alone which after a little Raillery they per∣mitted him to do but protested that if he stayed long they would follow himthough our Conversation was entirely about indifferent Matters during an Hour he stayed with me yet he and I were as heartily b  tered and I had as many Ex∣minations about his Behaviour to me as if he had been a young gay gallant Gen∣tleman the Reason of which was that he used to reprove others for their In∣temperance or Indecency So they took it into their Heads he was a sly Sinner and would have bribed me highly to tell a Lye of him I assured them provided they would but give me leave to inform him of it I would say what they pleased for I was fully of Opinion that if a Lye would do me Grace he would permit me to gild it with the happiest Terms I had  They told my Story to the good old Gentleman who kindly sent me over three Guineas by the Hand of my honoured Benefactor Mr  Cibber  I was at this Time applied to by Mr  Vctr  to write an Ode on the Princess of  Wales  's Birth Day which as he kept a TeaWarehouse in  PallMall  near her Court would he said at least gain him her Royal Highness's Custom so to ob∣lige him as I had really done when he was in very low Circumstances in  Ireland  some Years before I wrote as follows  An  ODE  on the BirthDay of her Royal Highness the Princess of  WALES  In∣tended for Music  LIGHT of the World with purest Beams adorn  The Front of Heav'n and gild the sacred Morn  Come from thy Chamber in the East  In richest Gold and Purple drest  Bright as the Royal Fair who on this Day was born  Say in all thy glorious Round  Hast thou so much Beauty found  Tho' Nature spreads for Thee her Charms  Her fairest

your downy Pinions bear  The joyful Tidings thro' the balmy Air  That Heav'n indulgent to  Britannia  's Isle  Created for her lov'd her Godlike Heir  This matchless Virgin this illustrious Fair  In whom the Virtues and the Graces smile  What Joy oh Royal Youth was thine  When You beheld the Nymph Divine  Like  Venus  rising from the Sea  While round officious  Cupids  play  Neptune  confess'd his Breast before  So rich a Treasure never bore  He hush'd the noisy Winds to sleep  And smooth'd the Surface of the Deep  Hymen  quick thy Taper light  Join whom Love before had join'd  And in blissful Bonds unite  Heart to Heart and Mind to Mind  The noblest Pair that ever yet  In sweet connubial Transports met  AIR  As when the Sun awakes the Year  And bids the Blooms their Sweets dis∣close  In vernal Lustre rob'd appear  The Lilly and the newblown Rose  So from this pure this hallow'd Flame  Behold the num'rous Offspring rise  Of future Bards the blissful Theme  And Rapture of a Nation's Eyes  Let Hymns of Praise to Heav'n ascend  For this propitious Store  Oh still the Royal Race defend  And  Britain  asks no more  What Success this met I know not but Mr  Vctr  soon after applied to me for a  Lilliputian  Ode on the Birth∣day  of his Royal Highness Prince GEORGE which I gave him as follows  NATURE wake  Muses speak  Clothe the Spring  Touch the String  Cupids  sport  Round the Court  Like the Prince  Charms dispense  Whose early Ray  Gives  Britain  Promise of resplendent Day  The flow'ry Prime  Delights a Time  The hopeful Bloom  Sheds rich Perfume  Then Fruits appear  To crown the Year  So lovely Boy  Thy Spring employ  That thy sweet Youth  Be crown'd with Fruits of Wisdom Virtue Truth  Ye to whose Care  Britannia  's Heir  Is now consign'd  To form his Mind  O to your Trust  Be firmly just  Let Flatt'ry ne'er  Infect his Ear  So shall he be  Worthy to rule a People Brave and Free  Oft let him trace  His Godlike Race  Their noble Story  Inspiring Glory  His Parents Eyes  With glad Surprize  Shall view a Son  Worthy their Throne  And  Albion  bless  The Royal Progeny's desir'd Increase  I know not what Reward the Gentle∣man got for these but he gave me five Shillings and as since my Return to  Ire∣land  he was twice so civil to write me  Word I was a Fool I must insist on it he was a much greater to apply to a Fool for Wit  And if he disputes these Facts let him but finish the Comedy of  Le Païsan Parvenu  in the same Stile I wrote the first Act for him and I will own myself to be the Dunce he so freely calls me  I must here

and a Cassock to cover it  But once more to return to  Albion  I had laid out a Couple of Guineas on a little curious Picture which I bought to sell again but was advised to present it to the Lord Almoner who they said had a Taste for Painting He generously ac∣ceepted of my Favour but neither made me any Return from his own Bounty nor his Majesty's so I had no great Reason to say he deserved the Character of an honest Man  On the Change of the Ministry I wrote the following Lines  To the Rt Hon  HENRY PELHAM  Esq  AMIDST contending Parties Strife for Sway  Eager to rule reluctant to obey  How just how noble must his Conduct seem  Whom all unite to honour and esteem  This blissful Fate this Happiness divine  Has Heaven reserv'd to crown a Life like Thine  This the Reward sublimer Virtues claim  Unenvy'd Honours and unspotted Fame  Integrity in fairest Light confess'd  Lives in the sacred Centre of thy Breast  Oh never never from her Laws depart  So reign confess'd the Friend of ev'ry Heart  Fix'd on her solid Base thy Worth shall stand  And  Britons  bless thy delegated Hand  Ev'n restless Faction shall ensure thy Peace  And only Heav'n thy Happiness increase  I shewed these Lines to Mr  Cibber  who liked them so well that he undertook to deliver them for me  The next Morning early he did so and then call'd upon me and giving me five Guineas asked me whether I thought them a sufficient Reward for my Poetry I told him I readily did Well then said he Mr  Pelham  distinguished thus  "There are Five Guineas for the Lady's Numbers and Five more for the good Advice they contain and tell her I hope God will always give me Grace to follow it"  There was a Statesman when comes such another  Not seeing Mr  Cibber  for a Fortnight after this Instance of his Friendship and Humanity I wrote to him the following Lines  To Mr  CIBBER  SINCE You became so great a Stranger  My Muse and Life have been in Dan∣ger  Consider both on You depend  As their inspiring faithful Friend  And shou'd your guardian Care decrease  Their animating Fires must cease  Since Novelties alone delight you  I've found a Method to excite you  A Scheme untry'd before to move you  'Tis plainly to confess I love you  Now look not with Surprize or Cold∣ness  Nor call this Declaration Boldness  For mine's a Flame divinely pure  For ever fitted to endure  From ev'ry grosser Thought refin'd  A Love for your accomplish'd Mind  Mr  Cibber  sent me Word he was going to the Masquerade but would see me next Day which gave rise to the follow∣ing Lines  To  COLLEY CIBBER  Esq  CAN now a Masquerade delight you  What are it's Charms that can invite you  Have not your Eyes to Age survey'd  The medley World in Masquerade  Where Friendship's Masque conceals the Knave  And Cowards wear the Masque of Brave  The Masque of Love we frail Ones find  Worn when our Ruin is design'd  The Patriot's Masque conceals  Sedition  And soft Humility's  Ambition    Ev'n you sometimes the Masque will wear  And what you are not oft appear  Rally your Faults with Wit and Spirit  And make your Folly masque your Merit  Come undisguis'd then come reveal'd  To me and Truth let Folly yield  And leave the Masque to Fools conceal'd  Mr  Cibber  received these Lines with his usual Partiality to me and my Per∣formances  And here it may not be amiss to give a particular Character of this Gentleman as no Man has ever been more satyrized or less deserved it  And I think I cannot do it in a bet∣ter Manner than I have used in describing Dr  Swift  that is to give him to my Readers in his Words and Actions as near as I can recollect them during the Time I had the Honour of being known to him And if the petty Scribblers should say that I never knew him any more than I did the Dean of St  Patrick  'swhy they only take away Merit from me with one Hand to give it to me with the other and must at least afford me the Praise of inventing with Probability that I have not  Drawn Bears in Water Dolphins in the Trees  But am uniform in my Characters and  Paint  Achilles  as  Achilles  was  As I have mentioned a poetical Intro∣duction to this Gentleman's Favour I must give a particular Account of his first Visit He ran up Stairs with the Vivacity of a Youth of Fifteen and making me a courtly Bow said he was sure I did not known him I answered  Not to know him would argue myself un∣known  "And prithee said he why did not you come to my House the Moment you came to  London  "  "Upon my Word Sir that would have been a modest Proof of  Irish  Assurance how could I hope for a Reception"  "Pshaw said he Merit is a sufficient Recommendation to me"  I cour∣tesied and as we both stood  "Sit down said he be less ceremonious to be better bred come shew me your Writings"  I obeyed and upon his reading the Poem called  Sorrow  he burst into Tears and was not assumed to give the flowing Virtue manly Way he desired a Copy of itwhich I gave him  and now his Curiosity was raised to know who I was I told him mine was a long and mournful Story unfit for a Soul so humanized as his  Where dwelt the pitying Pang the ten∣der Tear  The Sigh for suff'ring Worth the Wish preferr'd  For Humankind the Joy to see them blest  And all the social Offspring of the Heart  Mr  Cibber  assured me my fine Compli∣ment should not excuse me for he was fully determined to have my History from my own Lips and desired I might come and breakfast with him next Morn∣ing and begin  Accordingly I waited on him and wonderfully was he delighted with my Account of Dr  Swift  he had the Patience to listen to me three Hours without ever once interrupting me a most uncommon Instance of good Breeding es∣pecially from a Person of his Years who  usually dictate to the Company and en∣gross all the Talk to themselves For as Dr  Young  observes  A Dearth of Words a Woman need not fear  But 'tis a Task indeed to learn to hear  In that the Skill of Conversation lies  'Tis that must prove you both polite and wise  And I do assure my Readers the Gentle∣man neither yawned scratched his Head beat Tatoo with his Foot nor used any such ambiguous Givingout to note that he was weary  So far from it that tho' he was engaged to dine with the Duke of  Grftn  he had forgot it 'till his Ser∣vant came in to dress him he strictly charged me to come to him the next Morning and set my Spout a going for so he merrily called my Mouth  I obeyed his most kind Command and by way of Introduction told him a  Story Dr  Swift  related to me which was as follows  A Gentleman met a Friend in the Street whom he had not seen for some Years he began to give him an Account of what had befallen him since their Se∣paration from each other a Care happened to intervene upon which they took diffe∣rent Streets seven Years past and it so befel they met just in the same Place when without the least Ceremony he proceeded in his Story "And as I was telling you said he"  c  I was going to proceed when Mr  Cibber  interrupted me I was said he at the Duke of  Rchmnd  's last Sum∣mer when his Daughter a most accom∣plished young Lady and a very early Ri∣ser sat reading in a beautiful Portico about Six in the Morning I accosted the fair Creature and asked her the Subject of her Contemplation So in a most ele∣gant and agreeable Stile she related to me Part of a very entertaining Novel she held in her Hand and I believe in bet∣ter Words than the Author wrote it A  Summons to Breakfast broke off her most agreeable Narration  The next Morning I saw the Charmer in the same Portico who took up the Story at the very Word she had broke off and concluded it  As  Ireland  is now graced with this illus∣trious Fair One in whom Virtue Beauty Modesty Taste and every Excellence unite I hope for her Pardon for presu∣ming to mention her  And tho' as she will soon see her no∣ble Father was a beneficent Patron to me I hate Flattery so much that I would not on that Account pay her a Compliment beyond what was due to her elevated Sta∣tion did not her superior Virtues command it  Never yet were seen a more tender or a more lovely Pair than the Duke and Dutchess of  Richmond  with their bloom∣ing Progeny like newblown Roses smi∣ling around them an Instance Wedlock may be happy even among the Great when mutual Love and mutual Honour join  Here Love his golden Shafts employs here lights  His constant Lamp and waves his pur∣ple Wings  Reigns here and revels  And it is with infinite Pleasure I learn that Lord and Lady  Kildare  are as great an Example in conjugal Fidelity Piety and Generosity as their noble Parents  This Digression I am certain will be excused  I went on with my Story to Mr  Cibber  who at last in flowing Spirits cried  "Zds write it out just as you re∣late it and I'll engage it will fell"  Every Poem as I occasionally introdu∣ced them he made me give him a Copy of and communicated them to the Earl of  Chesterfield  who positively insisted on it that I must understand  Greek  and  Latin  otherwise I never could write  English  so well Mr  Cibber  said he had not enquired but that he would that Mo∣ment And accordingly came and told  me what my Lord had said I assured him I was ignorant of every Language except my Mothertongue but that if he would be so kind to present my Respects to his Lordship and let him know that Dr  Swift  had taught me  English  I was certain he would allow I had an excel∣lent Tutor to which his Lordship readily acquiesced  But alas though my Honours were very great my Profits were very small The dismal Return of Summer for so it was to me robbed me of every Friend and as I could not take up with mean Company I was as solitary in  London  as the Pelican in the Wilderness I acquainted Dr  Trnbull  with my melancholy Situ∣ation and prevailed on him to write to Mr  Pn  to remit to me what was due on the Agreement between us About ten Days after the Postman brought a Letter marked from  Dublin  to the Doctor he happened to be at  Ken∣sington  so I paid for it and knowing he had no Acquaintance in  Ireland  I ven∣tured  to open it it was wrote in a TextHand the Contents of it were as follow  SIR  IN the Absence of my Client Mr  P  I received your Letter and he would have you to know the Woman you mention is not his Wife nor has he any thing to say to the infamous Wretch she fled from  Ireland  where she ought to have been executed for kill∣ing her Father three of her Bastards and poisoning her Husband It does not be∣come a Clergyman to countenance a com∣mon Prostitute if she owes you any Money you may put her in Jail for I do assure you it will never be paid by Mr  Pn  I am Sir Your's J WALSH  Could one believe that any thing less than infernal Malice could have forged such an Accusation against an innocent Person My very Blood thrilled with Horror to think there could be such a Monster of my Species I am sure he  Shou'd never pray more abandon all Remorse  On Horrors Head Horrors accumulate  Do Deeds to make Heaven weep all Earth amaz'd  For nothing can he to Damnation add  Greater than this  Tho' I was far from the least Appre∣sion that the evil Facts I was charged with as to killing all my Family would meet with any Credit yet Mr  Pn  's denying me to be his Wife and the De∣claration that I was not intitled to any thing from him might hurt mine I sup∣pressed the Letter for a Day or two 'till learning by Accident that the Lord Bi∣shop of  Kilmore  now Lord Archbishop of  Tuam  to whose Family my Father had the Honour of being Physician and to whose Humanity I am infinitely indebted which with the utmost Respect and Gratitude I take this public Opportunity of acknow∣ledging was in  London  I took the Li∣berty of addressing myself to him as the Daughter of a Gentleman whom I was sensible his Lordship regarded my Ap∣plication was not in vain for though he that Day set out for  Ireland  he not only sent me a handsome Present but gave it in so genteel so polite a Manner with his Compliments that it added tenfold Weight to his Favour  When my Lord's Gentleman came to me Providence so ordered that Dr  Tbull  was drinking Coffee with me and upon this Encouragement of a Prelate's taking Compassion on my lost Estate I ventured to communicate to him Mr  Walsh  's Letter the Doctor lifted up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven and seemed as much shocked at the Perfidiousness of the Wretch as I had been for whoever wrote the Letter it was certainly done by  Mr  Pn  's Direction but no Won∣der when he had sworn I was dead and was actually married to another he tried every Method to destroy me And to convince the World I do not wrong him I here present them with a Letter I re∣ceived from  Ireland  and communicated to the present Primate who knows it was not a forged but a genuine One  MADAM  I Beg pardon for giving you this Trou∣ble though whether it can be any to you I know not having been so often as∣sured by him who ought to have the best Cause of Knowledge that you were long since dead but to my great Surprize I was informed by a Gentleman of Distinc∣tion lately come from  London  that he saw you that you were very well and lived in  St James  's  Street  The Cause of my Writing to you may seem odd but this it is  Mr  Pn  has for some Time past paid his Addresses to a young Lady who is the Daughter of my most intimate  Friend to whom I have often heard him with repeated Oaths not only confirm your Death but that also of his two younger Childrenthe latter is already found to be a base Falsehood and should it appear that he has attempted to impose a greater on us there is no Penalty the Law can inflict which he shall not suf∣fer nor shall my Resentment ever lessen or abate as he has justly merited it  I beg Madam if you yet exist you will favour me with an Answer and let me know whether there were any Terms of Agreement between you and Mr  Pn  on your Separation and be assured neither Money nor Friends shall be wanting to support your Interest and though I have not the Pleasure of being known to you you will find a real Friend in  DAVID LAMBERT  Direct to me at the  Globe CoffeeHouse Dublin  I answered this Letter the Moment I re∣ceived it which was three Weeks after the Date and never heard of the Gentle∣man more nor know I whether he exists or not  And as Mr  Pn  has since my Return to  Ireland  accused me of at∣tempting to injure him with the Primates as he stiles them I fairly own I sent Mr  Walsh  's Letter to the late Lord Primate  Hoadly  and Mr  Lambert  's Letter to the present Lord Primate who as he says in his most stupid Epistle scorned to counte∣nance me and gave him my Letter and my List of Subscribers also with full Power to do to them what he pleased And truly Mr Parson so do I but if nei∣ther the Lord Lieutenant nor any of the principal Persons of Distinction in this Kingdom who have honoured me with their Regard should be willing to bear an Insult from you how can you help your∣self Why Man we are in a Protestant Country and disdain to be Priestridden  Finding myself unable to pay so high a Rent as I stood at I discharged my  Lodging and Servant and went to board and lodge at a very genteel House in  Greenstreet GrosvenorSquare  my Land∣lord was Valet de Chambre to the Earl of  Stair  and his Wife a top Laundress which in  London  is a very profitable Employment  As she washed for several Persons of Distinction she used on a  Sunday  to in∣vite the HeadServants of Noblemen's Fa∣milies to Dinner at which I never took Umbrage for you are sure from them to learn every Circumstance relating to their Lords and Ladies and many entertaining Stories of their particular Humours and Gallantries did I learn so true is it that either good or evil Fame proceeds from our Domestics and no Wonder as they have a better Opportunity than the rest of the World to watch our unguarded Hours and comment on our Frailties  Amongst others Sir  John Ligonier  's Gentleman as they stiled him which Name his generous Master soon after en∣titled him to by giving him a Commis∣sion dined with us he looked very at∣tentively  at me and put me into Confu∣sion by telling my Landlady she had to his Knowledge a Gentlewoman Lodger  After Dinner my Landlord brought in a large Bowl of Punch Pipes and Tobacco upon which I made my  Exit  I had not long been in my DressingRoom which opened into a very sweet Garden when Mr  Parkinson  for so was this Person called followed me He told me he hated Drink and Tobacco and would be infinitely obliged to me for a Dish of Tea which as my Curiosity was raised by the Words he had let drop at Din∣ner I readily consented to give him  He had he told me frequently seen me in  Stephen'sGreen  and was in  Dublin  at the Time of my Separation from my Husband and that Numbers of People la∣mented my hard Fate I told him I had not found it so for that I could not even get what was due to me from thence nor an Answer to any Letter I ever wrote  He then asked me how I got any Sup∣port especially as he had learned from the Family that I lived very retired I in∣genuously  told him I had no other For∣tune than my Pen and at his Request shewed him some of my Writings he told me his Master delighted in Poetry and was one of the most generous Gentle∣men living and that he was certain if I applied to him he would be a Friend to me I was easily prevailed on to write to him to beg he would do me the Honour of subscribing to me and sent him such of my Rhymes as I myself had the best Opinion of The General wrote me a very polite Answer and as he lived but a few Doors from my Lodging gave me the next Evening the Honour of a Visit  This Gentleman is so universally known beloved honoured and esteemed that I dare not attempt his Character being as∣sured my best Painting would fall infi∣nitely short of the excellent Original Nor was I at all surprized that he should be a Fa∣vourite of the Fair who was adorned with Honour Generosity Valour and yet even Female Softness and Complacency added to the Charms of a most graceful and majestic Person  And if in an advanced Age he shone so brightly what must he have done in his first Bloom when  His kindling Cheeks with purple Beau∣ties glow'd  His lovely sparkling Eyes shot martial Fires  Dreadful as  Mars  and as his  Venus  charming  I dare say half the Ladies would have cried out with  Phoedra  O Godlike Form O Extasy and Trans∣port  This worthy Gentleman subscribed to me for Twelve Books and also engaged the late Duke of  Argyle  the Earl of  Stair  the Lord  Cobham  and several other  Eng∣lish  Noblemen to do me the same Ho∣nour  So the Almighty raised me Friends even in a strange Land and proved my Husband tho' a Priest no Prophet who  declared I should starve to which indeed his best Endeavours have not been wanting  But he should have remembered the Words of holy  David I have been young and now am old yet never saw I the Righ∣teous Man forsaken nor his Seed begging their Bread  My dear Father had by his many good Works entailed a Blessing on my honest Endeavours and as Mr  Cibber  used to say when I wrote any thing that pleased him  "The Gift of the great God to you preserves you"  which as I never sold nor prostituted it to unworthy Ends I humbly hope his Mercy will afford to me as long as I have any Being  This timely Assistance enabled me not only to live but to pursue my writing which no Person can ever do well while their Minds are like  Martha  's troubled with many Things  A few Days after this a very genteel pretty Woman took a Lodging in the same House with me She was with Child and her Husband was as she said a Lawyer and was gone the Circuit so  finding the City not agree with her she moved to better Air As she had very good Furniture my Landlady made no Scruple to accept of her without farther Enquiry and I was well pleased to think I should have an agreeable Companion  Her Manner of Life greatly surprized me for in two Months Time she never once went abroad nor did any human Creature come to visit her  At length about two o'Clock one Morning a Gentleman came who she she said was her Husband she let him in herself and he left her early in the Morning so that none of the Family saw him he repeated his nocturnal Visits seve∣ral Times after the same Manner in the Dead still and Middle of the Night which appeared to me rather to wear the Face of an Amour than lawful Matri∣mony  At length the Gentleman failed in his Attendance and the Lady said he was gone into the Country  The Nightly Knocking at the Door did cease  The noiseless Hammer rusted there in Peace  Some Weeks past over without either a Message or a Letter coming from the supposed Husband upon which she fell into a deep Melancholy which though she seemed to attribute to her Apprehen∣sion of the approaching Hour I could ea∣sily perceive had some more secret and latent Cause  And as in my Life I had never seen a more retired or modest Person I had the utmost Compassion for her and judged if she was among the Number of the Unfor∣tunate some uncommon Villainy had been practised against her  As we were very intimate I frequently surprized her in Tears and at last I ventured to beg her to acquaint me with the Cause of her Affliction assuring her it was not an impertinent Female Curiosity which urged me on but a real Desire to  be serviceable to her which perhaps by some Means or other Providence might point out  She burst into Tears and fondly em∣bracing me told me she wanted a Friend to unbosom herself to and added that if I would be her Bedfellow that Night she would relate to me her unhappy Story  Wished for Night came and my fair Friend kept her Promise  I am said she the Daughter of an emi∣nent Merchant who by his extraordinary good Nature in being Surety for others hospitable Spirit and very great Losses at Sea was obliged to live in a more narrow Compass than suited the Generosity of his Mind my Mother dying when I was but twelve Years of Age my Father made me Mistress of the House which he said would teach me to be an Oeconomist and to know how to govern one of my own When I was about fourteen Years of Age a wealthy Packer a very handsome Man courted me my Father ingenuously told him he could give him but five hun∣dred  Pounds with which if he was satis∣fied and that I had no Objection to it he should be very glad to have him for a Soninlaw  Mr  Hrnl  for so was he called assured him he would gladly take me without a Portion but my Father insisted on his Acceptance of it as it would help to furnish a House  Whatever may be thought at  St James  's these who converse with the Traders of  London  will find they neither want Sense nor Politeness and I liked Mr  Hl  so well that I was very glad of being so happily disposed of  My Husband took a House commo∣dious for his Business and for four Years during which Time I had four Children we lived in great Harmony  But in the mean Time I had the Mis∣fortune of losing my dear Father who lest the little Remainder of his Fortune as a Portion for my younger Sister and ap∣pointed my Husband to be her Guardian  One Day he told me he was afraid he should not be able to keep such good  Hours as he had done being chosen a Member of the Philosophic Club in which were many Gentlemen of Distinc∣tion whose Acquaintance it was greatly his Interest to cultivate and to whom it was an Honour to be known so he hoped it would not give me any Uneasiness I answered he had always been so indulgent to me I must be ungrateful indeed to take Offence or be uneasy at any thing he was pleased to do he seemed trans∣ported with my Answer kissed me and said I was the best Wife living Little did I think what Villainy he was perpetra∣ting against me  He now stayed out several Nights en∣tirely and if he came at all it was not 'till Four or Five in the Morning which being unacquainted with Jealousy gave me no other Concern than the Fear that Irre∣gularities might prejudice his Health but I have often been surprized at his coming Home so sober and that he did not ap∣pear drowsy after such long watching  One Morning in particular he no sooner entered but he called for his Ri∣ding  Dress and told me he was going with a Gentleman into the Country for a few Days so giving me his Purse in which were forty Guineas he desired I would carefully observe his Business in which I was now a pretty good Proficient  Three Months Time elapsed and tho' I wrote to him according to his own Di∣rection I never received an Answer  I was now filled with the most gloomy Apprehensions one Time concluding he had been murdered a thousand Fears presented themselves to my Imagination 'till lost and bewildered I could fix on nothing My Friends persuaded me to ad∣vertise him which accordingly I did  Some Days after a very well drest young Gentleman desired to see me I shewed him into the Parlour where he demanded of me whether I was Mr  Hl  's Wife I said yes upon which to my great Surprize he asked me could I prove it I assured him I could  "That is all I want Madam"  I begged he would explain those dark Speeches inasmuch as they quite terrified  me  "Madam said he my Name is  Lcky  I have a good Estate and am newly called to the Bar your Hus∣band has inveigled away my Sister and married her she is under Age and has fifteen thousand Pounds to her Fortune she shall prove her Marriage and if you do not prove your prior one what can the World think of you"  I was so astonished at this Account that I fainted awaythe Gentleman called the Servants to my Assistance and stayed by me 'till I came to myself the Agonies I felt are only known to those who have truly and tenderly loved dread∣ful Alternative either to prosecute a be∣loved Husband to Death or be myself deemed an infamous Woman  Here the poor Creature had so renewed her own Anguish and so awakened all my Woes that our Eyes streamed social and mingled their sympathetic Waters 'till insensibly the dewyfeathered Sleep closed up our Eyelids  I longed as much for the next Night as the  Sultan  in  The Arabian Nights En∣tertainment  did to hear the charming  Sche∣razade  's fine Stories at length it came and the Lady proceeded  I begged a Day or two to consider on so important an Affair and also to con∣sult with my Friends what was most ad∣viseable for me to do and then I would return a positive Answer so having an Uncle in  Bondstreet  I sent my Houshold Furniture there Dear Madam said I what did you do with your Children Oh returned she I never had one that lived above a few Days That said I was happy I think so now said she though I did not then I told my Uncle all my mournful Story who advised me bv all Means to vindicate myself and not fall a Prey to so consummate a Villain  I stayed with my Uncle who was a Widower my Sister married and Mr  H  would not pay her her For∣tune as she had not asked his Consent  My Uncle would not permit either a Let∣ter or a Message to be delivered to me but kept me a perfect Prisoner how∣ever there was a young Lady in the Neighbourhood whom he had some In∣clination to marry and whom he fre∣quently brought as a Companion to re∣lieve my solitary Hours  One Evening she insisted on my coming to drink Tea with her my Uncle urged me to it I went Judge of my Surprize when I found there my Husband's Mother and Sister all drowned in Tears they told me he was confined in  Newgate  had taken the PrisonFever and declared he could not die in Peace unless he saw me  I loved too well to refuse his Request upon which they immediately hurried me into a Coach and there indeed he was the Lawyer had arraigned him for his Life and he must take his Trial  He looked so dejected and seemed so sincerely penitent and I alas so sincerely loved him that I even consented to stay with him in his Confinement he acknow∣ledged  his Fault but very artfully insinu∣ated that it did not proceed from any Change in his Affection but that his Cir∣cumstances were so distressed that he had no other Means to retrieve them that his Death could be of no Service to methat I knew myself to be his lawful Wife that he would always support me in short he used every tender and prevailing Argument to keep me from appearing against him and Heaven knows I had no Inclination to do it  When his TrialDay came his second Wife fully proved her Marriage to him but like the real Mother I chose to give her all sooner than divide him so she triumphed over me and as I had given up the Cause none of my Friends would give me any Assistance I am now in the oddest Situation imaginable even a kept Mistress to my own Husband for upon no other Terms would he give me any Relief nor do I know whether to stile myself innocent or guilty for my Conde∣scension to him  As my Tenderness for him made me appear in a bad Light to the World ever ready to censure even our best Actions I dare not in my present Condition let any Person who knows me see me lest they should think of me worse than I deserveI have had no Supply from him for a considerable Time he has prohibited my writing to him at his House and now dear Madam advise me what to do  There was something so peculiarly un∣happy in this poor Creature's Fate that it might puzzle a wiser Head than mine to comply with her Request I considered it every way without being able to form any Scheme for her Relief  At length she told me he kept an Of∣fice on  LudgateHill  where he was always to be found at Nine in the Morning as his second Wife was too fine a Lady to bear one in the House she imagined if I could see him I might work on his Compassion I readily consented to do any thing which might be serviceable to her and rising early next Morning she  gave me a Letter to him which I pro∣mised not to deliver but into his own Hand  Accordingly I set out on my Embassy and found the Gentleman such as she had described him a polite handsome Man of above thirty Years of Age he was alone and received me very civilly I presented the Letter but seemed ignorant of the Contents I could easily perceive he was much disturbed however with a marvellous Assurance he said he could not give Charity to every Body that he had often assisted that unfortunate Person that she ought to work for her Bread as many of her Betters did and a Number of such inhuman Speeches common on those Occasions I told him her present Condi∣tions did not enable her to perform any but Needlework and that he who put her into it should support her he asked me what I meant Nothing but Honesty if a Man gets a Child he ought to take care of it What said he would you have me father a Bastard She could not  I am sure have One by you and would not I am convinced have One by any Body else He bade me explain myself I told him he perfectly understood me and therefore it was not necessary but that if he pleased I would tell Mrs  Hl  the second of his Midnight Visits to his Wife The Wretch seemed confounded and seeing I knew him so well thought he had best be quiet especially as a Gen∣tleman came in before whom he did not care to be exposed so he called me to the Staircase and putting a Couple of Guineas into my Hand said aloud Madam I shall take care and mind your Directions I begged he would and so we parted But I am well convinced it was Fear not Love that made him send her even that Trifle  This unhappy Lady died a few Hours after she was brought to Bed the Infant also died and I hope though her Hus∣band by her Lenity once escaped a Hal∣ter justly due to him he has by this Time inherited it for I would have such Offenders so cut off  I grew so melancholy at the Loss of my Companion that I did not even care for writing but amused myself entirely with reading and my not having a Li∣brary of my own made me a constant Customer to a Shop in the Neighbour∣hood where they hired out Books by the Quarter this brought me into an Ac∣quaintance with the Persons who kept it sensible wellbred People One Day I received a Letter from Mrs  Ryves  for that was their Name that she had some very agreeable Friends with her and that they wanted a Hand at Quadrille so she hoped I would be of their Party I was very glad of any Recreation and as they lived but in  BrookStreet  directly went I was shewn into a Parlour where sat an old Man whom I knew to be a  GrubStreet  Writer and a young Gentleman in a very plain Dress whom I also supposed to be in the same Class they were playing Crib∣bage for a Farthing a Game and instead of Counters scored with Chalk they had also an Alehouse Pot with some Porter  in it standing by them and the Room smelled strong of Tobacco from these Appearances I conceived a very con∣temptible Opinion of the Company and would have retired had I known how to do it civilly but as at my Entrance I had told Mrs  Ryves  I was entirely dis∣engaged that Evening I could by no means get off and could only hope for some little Amusement by hearing what those Underlings in Arts and Sciences might have to say  For ev'ry Object of Creation  May furnish Hints for Contemplation  The Scene however was changed the disagreeable Part of the Decoration re∣moved and a Quadrille Table introduced  The younger Gentleman proposed our playing for Nothing  "Pshaw said I then we shall all cheat"  "I would no more do that said he than give a Vote against my Country"  This surpri∣zed me told him I hoped as he ex∣pressed such a Spirit of Patriotism he had  a Seat in the House He said he had the Honour of representing the ancient City of  Canterbury  that his Father was Ad∣miral  Rocke  and that he was married to the Sister of the Lord  Guilford Dudley  a Lady unmatched in Wit and Beauty I told him I was glad to find one Person of Distinction who was not ashamed to do Justice to the Merits of his Lady  "I should be a Scoundrel said he to refuse it she gave me the Preference to a Man of a much larger Fortune to whom her Friends had destined her an Obligation never to be forgot by a grateful Spirit"  This Gentleman had such an uncommon generous way of think∣ing that instead of minding the Game I was quite attentive to him which he ob∣serving said  "Take away the Cards they are only fit to amuse such as are incapable of tasting a more rational Entertainment"  I was very glad of thisthe old Scrib∣bler walked into the Shop to recreate him∣self  with Tobacco and Porter and Mrs  Ryves  went to get us some Chatinspiring Liquor Green Tea  I told Mr  Rooke  if I had been any way wanting in Respect to him I hoped he would attribute it to my Ignorance of his Station and the Company and Situa∣tion I found him in  He assured me I had committed no Offence nor did he believe it was in my Nature But said he as you have re∣marked on the Company you must know my Wife and Lord  Sthwll  's Sisters went this Morning to  Greenwich  I had some Business which prevented my waiting on them when that was over I went to  MountStreet CoffeeHouse  in order to pick up some Company to dine with me and finding none I asked the old Man who refused me as Mrs  Ryves  had engaged him I told him I would go dine with himas I had in the Shop read your Apology for the Minister I was greatly surprised to hear it was the Product of a Lady's Pen when I seemed to question  it they proposed sending for you which being very agreeable to me was imme∣diately done so Madam this is the His∣tory of the Day  I thanked the Gentleman for his Com∣plaisance in relating it  The Tea put him into such high Spirits that he finding me a Sort of a Politician told me many entertaining Stories about Sir  Robt Wl  's various Schemes to have always the Majority of the House on his Side of which as many as I can re∣collect that were humorous I present my Readers with  The First was this One Sir  Cldy Mcdl  a  Scots  Baronet without a Foot of Estate was returned duly elected for what Shire I have forgot however he came to  London  took a HackneyCoach and drove to Sir  Robt  's the Servants said he was engaged but Sir  Cldy  insisted on his carrying up his Name and lest he should forget it he jumped out of the Coach and running up Stairs after him delivered his Embassy  himself Sir  Robt  welcomed him and like a Courtier told him he should be glad to serve him  "Nay nay Mon returned he I came na here for Com∣pliments I ha ne Siller to get a Lodg∣ing so I'll e'en stay here till you give me some"  So Sir  Robt  chose to give him his Purse rather than be plagued with his Impertinence  The Earl of  Prbh  a Pen∣sioner told Sir  Robt  he was always at a Loss how to vote inasmuch as he did not understand the Debatesand was so near sighted that when the House divided he knew not of which Side to goSir  Robt  bade him always follow the Bi∣shops It happened on the Convention Scheme three or four of the Bishops rose and the Earl seeing them move he ac∣cording to his Master's Direction followed them and voted pointblank against his his Interest  Mr  Rooke  seeing how much I was pleased proceeded  A  Scots  Peer who was also a Pen∣sioner and a remarkable fat Man came one Morning according to Custom to Sir  Robt  's Levee and without the least Ceremony laid hold of his Ribbon Sir  Robt  could not readily disengage him∣self and the Nobleman lugged him to the Window in which sousing him∣self down he happened to have an Escape which carried with it so loud a Report that it threw the whole Company into Laughter  Very well my Lord said the Minister pray what have you farther to say  "Why this it is Sir  Robt  I owe Fifteen Hundred Pounds and by Gd if you don't give it to me I'll go to∣morrow to the House and vote ac∣cording to Conscience"  'Tis to be presumed his Demand was complied with in private though laughed at in public as he always voted with Sir  Robt  Mr  Rocke  finding me attentive pro∣ceeded The late Duke of  Whton  was a Man of infinite Variety and Humour  at the Time of the Discovery of  Atter∣bury  's  Plot  as they called it which was proved by decyphering Letters and tor∣turing the harmless Alphabet into Treason the Duke saw a Man at the Door of the ParliamentHouse selling Hornbooks Sir  Robt  's Equipage stopped and the Duke laying hold of him as he alight told him he was surprised he did not send that Fellow to  Newgate  who was selling such a Libel on the Ministry  "Why said Sir  Robt  my Lord those are Hornbooks"  "Treason by G replied the Duke as I will convince you"  so holding him he ran on  A  stands for an  Army  and  B  for a  Bench  C  stands for a  Court  and  D  for a  Drench  E  I won't interpret that  F  stands for gay  France  which we hope will not swerve  And  G  stands for  George  whom God long preserve  P  stands for the  Px  the  Pretender  the  Pope  And  R  stands for  Robin  and  Ribbon  and  Rope  said he pulling him by the blue String the Minister could not help himself and being naturally of a pacific Temper took this as quietly as he did Gnrl  Chchll  's lying with his W  fe  As I had never heard the Story I beg∣ged he would relate it Why said he Sir  Rbrt  went out very early one Morning to the House but having forgot some Paper of Importance to the dirty Work of the Dayhe returned Home for it and passing through his Wife's Apartment to his Closet what should he see but his serene Spouse and the General in amorous Dalliancethe General AllHero as he was jumped out of Bed and besought Mercy from as he supposed his incensed Rival but the good Man resembling  Cato  in one Point  Who if a Friend or so should chance to need her  Would recommend her as a special Breeder  said carelesly  "Prithee what does the Fool mean you look very warm get into Bed again or you'll catch Cold"  Mr  Rooke  seeing me so well diverted with this Story proceeded to another As I have said he mentioned the Duke of  Whrtn  you are to know he had an Intrigue with Mrs  P  now Ctess of  B  one Morning as they were in Bed together he recollected that he had promised to write a Letter to a Friendso he called for a Pen Ink and Paper but being at a Loss for a WritingDesk made the Lady turn up her Postes and dated his Letter from sweet  Pggy Plty  's  c c c  Here entered our kind Host and brought us in a Paper called the  Champion  in which was a very humorous Piece of Advice to all who went to Ct to wear Shields on their Bus this was so  Mal  à propos  that it raised out Mirth Said Mr  Rooke  his M's own was in Dan∣ger the other Night As how Sir Why said he Sir  Robt  not chusing to hurt the Kingdom by the K's using foreign Commodities when we had so much cheaper and better at Home recom∣mended to him Miss  Skrrt  as an HandMaiden his M liked her so well that he invited her to sup with him in the Ctess of  Yh  's Apart∣ment where growing a little more fond of his young Mistress than the old One could bear she arose and as the K leaned over the Table drew the Chair from under him and let M come souse to the Ground Oh what a Fallingoff was there He all enraged rose again kicked first the Css next his Hat and retired to his Apartment marvelously distempered with Choler  Well Sir said I surely Sir  Rt  was a most necessary Servant that would even Sir  Pandarus  of  Troy  become and that for his own Daughter to oblige his M but an able Politician will turn  his Hand to any thing where Profits may accrue and Mr  Gay  observes that  In Pimps and Politicians  The Genius is the same  And yet who could suspect a Man of his Reverence and Station for the most vile and servile of all Employments  Oh sy said he don't disgrace so noble an Occupation I assure you the Knight's Complaisance to the General proved the Means of saving his own Life for on the Excise Scheme the People were so incensed that they determined to put him to Death and yet make it seem Chance Medley Accordingly as he was going down to St  Stephen  's  Steps  into our il∣lustrious SteHouse one Man pushed him so hard that he tumbled on his Face and a Number of Persons determined to run over him and trample him to Death but the General who was with him drew his Sword and swore the first who ad∣vanced should die on Point of  Fox  No body ventured to encounter a  Chll  so the Prime Mster escaped  Ah said I that was God's Mercy and ten Thousand Pities Faith said he and so it was  Mr  Rooke  now began to be a little in∣quisitive who I was I told him my Name was  Meade  for by that I always went in  London  so that the numerous Stories of Mrs  Pn  's being in Ta∣verns Bagnio's  c  which my Husband says be can prove  Mem  he lyes never appertained to me but to his own Csin  Ny Pn  whose Father lives in  PillLane  and who is herself as common a Prostitute as ever traversed the Hundreds of  Drury  I do this to convince him I scorn to rob any of his illustrious Family of their noble Atchievements and according to the old Proverb '  Tis but proper to set the Saddle on the right Horse  or rather Mare for I think she much resembles one  But to return  Mr  Rooke  asked me if I was related to Capt  Meade  I told him he was my Uncle's Son He said he was a worthy little Fellow that he knew him very well and had made him his Confidant in his Amour with his Lady  Time stole insensibly away with such agreeable Amusement we sat till the small Hours without Drowsiness nor did we de∣sire the Aid of  Bacchus  to keep up our Spirits  I humbly hope no body will attempt to decypher my Initials for I do assure them the great  M  is an innocent Letter and does not like  Mitching Mal∣licho  mean Mischief  I told Mr  Rooke  I was going to pub∣lish a Book by Subscription he said he was sure it must be good so he gave me a Guinea and promised to use his Interest for me  He told me he would come and visit me the first Hour he had to spare I an∣wered I hoped he would soon find one Well then said he I'll tell you how I pass the Day and do you find one  I rise about Nine drink Coffee not that I like it but that it gives a Man the Air of a Politician for the same Reason al∣ways read the Newsthen I dress and about Twelve go to the  CocoaTree  where I talk Treason from thence to St  James  's CoffeeHouse where I praise the Ministry then to  White  's where I talk Gallantry so by Three I return Home to Dinner after that I read about an Hour and digest the Book and the Dinner to∣getherthen I go the Opera or Play  VauxHall  or  Ranelagh  according to the Season of the Year from thence Home to Supper and about Twelve to Bed  I smiled at the Gentleman's whimsical Description of his passing the Day and told him he had by his own Account three or four Hours to bestow on me as the Hour he talked Treason the Hour he was loyal or the Hour in which he read  "Ay said he very gaily or what think you of the last Flour wherein I go to Bed"  "Oh Sir you are so much better enga∣ged it would not only be Wickedness but Folly also to think of that at all"  Well depend on it said he I'll see you to∣morrow so we took Leave forever for the very first News I heard next Morning was that Mr  Rooke  a little while after he arose fell down in an Apoplectic Fit and instantly expired  I never was more shocked than at his untimely Fate Heavens all Wit Life and Gaiety at Night and dead in the Morning I wept for him as a Friend and such I am sure he would have been to me had he lived I found by these two me∣lancholy Events there was nothing serious in Mortality all was but Toys I frequently recollected Dr  Delany  's beautiful Lines on seeing himself in the Glass  When I revolve this evanescent State  Of short Duration and uncertain Date  My Being and my Stay dependent still  Not on my own but on another's Will  I ask myself as I my Form review  Which is the real Shadow of the two  Mrs  Ryves  was also much touched for the Loss of this Gentleman and indeed  so was every body who knew him She and I went one Afternoon to walk in  St James  's  Park  but finding myself weary she proposed going to a Physician's House in  Westminster  a Widower and her Rela∣tion where we could get a Dish of Tea and rest ourselves I agreed the Doctor was at Home and a very polite Gentle∣man I found by the Furniture of the Room he was a  Virtuoso  it being adorned with Books Medals Paintings dried Butterflies and Tomes of Casuistry  The Dean mentions it as a Praise to  Vanessa  that  She witb Address each Genius held  To that wherein they most excell'd  So making others Wisdom known  She pleas'd them and improv'd her own  For no sooner did the Doctor perceive that I knew  Mark Anthony  from  Julius Caesar  and  Brutus  from both but he related a great Part of the  Roman  History to me even from the first  Punic  War to the Death of  Julius  My Readers may venture to believe it was not new to me who had from my Childhood been if I may use the Word a perfect Devourer of Books and I found them both sweet to the Palate and nou∣rishing Food to the Mind  It has been observed as a Piece of re∣fined Policy in  Gondamore  the  Spaniard  that he used to talk bad  Latin  to King  James  I who being a Pedant rather than a Prince had so much Pleasure in as he thought setting this  Machiavel  right that to oblige his Pupil he complimented him with the Head of that learned and brave Man Sir  Walter Raleigh  I have often successfully practised the same Art and gained many Friends by seeming to take their Instruction with Pleasure to acknowledge their Superiority of Understanding on which even Fools pride themselves is I believe the most delicate way of flattering ever yet thought of as  Cassius  says of  Caesar  And when I tell him he hates Flattery  He says he does being then most flattered  Very few People are Virtue Proof there all like  Achilles  have a mortal Heel and though  'Tis an old Maxim in the Schools  That Flattery's the Food of Fools  Yet now and then your Men of Wit  Will condescend to taste a Bit  Swift  I found the good Doctor fallible here to my great Happiness as it made him my Friend and under God his Skill and Care soon after saved my Life  The Gentleman made us stay to Supper finding when the Wind was in one particu∣lar Point I was as wise as  Hamlet  and knew a Hawk from a Handsaw  At Supper I told him I was an  Amicus  akin to the Faculty being a Physician's Daughter upon which he arose and said he must salute his Niece and that if ever I should fall sick he claimed the Ho∣nour of attending me We stayed toge∣ther till Twelve very chearfully and then parted in Peace  I have observed if my Life had any Sunshine it was but a faint and watery Gleam too soon overcast for in a very few Days I was seized with a violent Fe∣ver it took me with cold shivering Fits and remembering the Doctor's Claim I sent for him He had me bled and ordered me to go to Bed I did not see him till next Morning by which time I was quite lightheaded and crying out for my Chil∣dren when the Doctor came I told him he had stolen them from me and carried them to Mr  Pn  on this he opened my Bosom for which I also quarrelled and said he was a very impudent Fellow he smiling said I had a very fair Skin but that he was under a Necessity of making free with it otherwise he could not answer for my Life and as it seems it was full of purple Spots he ordered a large Blister for my Back and one for each Arm what past for some Days in which they were renewed I know not being quite insensible even to Pain but when the Fever abated and Reason once  more reassumed her Throne what Frail Machines are we when Sickness can dis∣place her They assured me I raved in∣cessantly for my dear little Ones and fell into such Fits of Crying and Lamentation for them that it put them in Mind of  Rachel  mourning for the Loss of her Chil∣dren who refused to be comforted be∣cause they were not  So as it has been often observed that there is Truth in Wine I found there was Truth in Madness the Cause that hurts the Brain or the reigning Passion of the Soul then manifests itself and as my Be∣loved were evermore present to my Ima∣gination it was no Wonder that their Names dwelt ever on my Tongue  When these Things were told me I as one newly awakened from Sleep remem∣bered some wild disjointed incoherent Ideas which had possessed my Soul even during it's lethargic State such as that Mr  Pn  was going to offer some violent Injury to our Children but of what Kind I knew not it was fled like the Remembrance of a Guest which tarrieth  but a Day I might have as well have endeavoured to find out the Path which the light Bird had with his Wings beat in the buxom Air or the Track of a Ship when with it's crooked Keel it divides the briny Waves which immediately unite again or seize old  Time  and bid him bring me back one Moment past as hope to recollect what was for ever lost in Oblivion  Indeed I have frequently had these su∣pernatural Sollicitings or a Kind of Indi∣cation of whatever was to befal me before it happened Nay what is more surpri∣zing I have read a History to me quite new and it has occurred to me that I myself had been some way principally concerned in the most material Transactions of it tho' they were past a thousand Years  Had I lived in the Days of  Pythagoras  I believe I should have been of his Opi∣nion and have imagined  That all Things are but altered nothing dies  And here and there th' unbody'd Spirit flies  Nay I should have been afraid to kill a Woodcock lest I should disinherit the Soul of my Granddame  If my Reader thinks me whimsical let him judge by the Event  A Woman in whose Garden I had once walked in  Ireland  the first Day I was able to sit up and very weak I was after so long Sickness even while my kind Physician was rubbing my Temples with  Hungary  Water to recover me out of a fainting Fit rushed into the Room and without the least Ceremony cried out  "Do you know what that Villain has done"  As I neither knew her nor who she spoke of I was quite startled and asked her who she talked about or what she meant  "That Villain  Pn  says she who has sold your two younger Children for Slaves to  New York  "  This was such a monstrous Crime I could scarce give any Credit to it for even admit∣ting what he had so cruelly charged me with in Regard to his Bed was Truth how had their helpless Innocence offended  him I observed to the Doctor my Ra∣vings were ominous and portended some dire Calamity  The Doctor apprehending this Shock might make me relapse begged of the Person who gave it to retire which after several Asseverations that what she said was Fact as indeed it was and that she had brought it out in that Manner to haste me if possible to prevent their un∣happy Fate she did  As the Doctor was not only a Man of excellent Understanding but also of great Humanity I told him as he had been so kind to administer to the Health of my Body he must now if possible administer to a Mind diseased and as it was impos∣sible for him to prescribe Remedies with∣out knowing the Distemper and it's Ori∣ginal I gave him my Story in a few Words and he advised me to write to  Ireland  to the Rulers and Bishops which I did that very Night and pro∣videntially the Letters were delivered Time enough to prevent the Children being sold to Slaverythe Affair was  enquired into and Mr  Pn  was obliged to refund to the Master of the KidShip the Golden Earnest he had received as the Price of the Innocent  What to me was most surprizing was that Mr  Pn  's Mother was one of the Contrivers of this infernal Plot Grand∣mothers being usually more indulgent to their Grandchildren than even their Mo∣thers but as she who would have made a Prey of them is not long since dead even of the Disease that  Herod Peter the Cruel  and other malignant Wretches fell by I can only bid her adieu and chari∣tably hope she has escaped the Judgment of the next World as it fell on her in this  These Facts are so publickly known that for the Evidence of them I could pro∣duce even a Cloud of Witnesses were it necessary  And yet who that beheld this Man clad in holy Vesture at the Altar appear∣ing like whiterobed Innocence with Eyes upturned to Heaven could believe him capable of all Manner of Crimes  Perjury Perjury in the highest Degree  Cruelty Cruelty in the sternest Degree  He may indeed like  Richard  III prove himself by these to be a Man who when his Mother upbraids him with his mani∣fold Acts of savage Tyranny she says  No Beast so fierce but knows some Touch of Pity  Rich  But I know none and therefore am no Beast  And indeed Mr  Pn  may again say with him that he has nothing  But the plain Devil and dissembling Looks  To back his Cause  Oh that  Ithuriel  's heav'nly temper'd Spear  Would make the Fiend in his own Shape appear  Or pluck the holy Furr from off his Back and let the World for once see what the Inside of a wicked Priest is made of  As I received no Account from  Ireland  I knew not what to think sometimes I flattered myself that the Woman had be∣lied him at other Times reflecting on his intolerable Barbarity to the poor Crea∣tures whom Distress alone made me leave immured within his inhospitable Walls too rough a Cradle for my pretty Ones my very Heart died within me and I am as well assured as that I live that it was not the Fear of God but the Fear of a Halter hindered him from embruing his own Hands in their vital Blood  But enough of the Wretch who if he can disprove me ought to do it he attributes his Silence to Contempt of me but it is well known he neither wants Wit nor Words nor Impudence to bring him off It is strong Conviction with Proof as full and evident as Day against him ties up his guilty Tongue  At length I thought of writing to  Wrsle  as I had learned he was in  Dublin  He wrote me Word that the Children were all well that he had given an ApprenticeFee with my Daughter to a Milliner and had taken my youngest Son to himself that old Mr  Pn  and my Mother were dead and my last Child which being but an Infant I could not carry to  London  with me that he had got a famous ossified Man and was going to carry him to  Paris  for a Shew to which Place he earnestly invited me to accompany him  I hoped by this Letter that Mr  Pn  had been wronged with re∣gard to the Children under his Care and tho' some humane Tears fell for the Loss of my Mother and my Child yet con∣sidering how desolate they both were I en∣vied rather than deplored their Fate  The Child here mentioned was that which Mr  Pn  disclaimed and advised me to leave upon the Parish  And now I do assure my Readers I was also sincerely sorry for the Death of old  Mr  Pn  inasmuch as he always treated me with a fatherly Tenderness was excessively fond of my Children was a Man of a great uncultivated Genius and tho' I have mentioned his keeping an Alehouse I did not mean it in any Dis∣respect to his Memory for he was the Son of a Gentleman tho' by various Mis∣fortunes he was reduced to take up so low an Occupation but nothing can be justly deemed scandalous which is not dishonest And I am well convinced had he lived he never would have consented to the in∣human Barbarity of his Son  Adieu and take thy Praise with thee to Heav'n  So many melancholy Incidents had be∣fallen me in this solitary Place that I de∣termined to change my Lodging and was recommended by a Stationer's Wife to a single Gentlewoman who kept a Milliner's Shop in  Fleetstreet  she was a jolly likely Dame of about Forty very gay we liked each other so well that we soon  made a Bargain and for a few Days I was very well pleased with the Change as the Variety of that busy Part of  London  amused my Mind But I soon found that I was got into very bad Hands and that my new Landlady was neither better nor worse than a mercenary Town Jilt who being pretty well known herself and consequently despised wanted something new to produce to her Customers  I think I never saw any Person in my Life who did not possess one good Quality except this Creature for Woman is a Term too gentle for her who had not even Decency to hide her Shame  To give my Reader a Taste of her Cleanliness She told me herself she had not combed her Head for three Years which I believe was true because she was not Mistress of a Comb except when she made free with mine than which no∣thing could be more offensive to me so that her Hair tho' naturally fine being quite matted on a filthy Haircap seemed to be a Composition of raw Silk and Moss such as I remember to have stolen a Lock  of from the H  ad of Good Duke  Hum∣phrey  at  St Albans  three hundred Years after his Death Shifts she had two as yellow as Canvas but they were sleeveless no Matter for thar she sold readymade Cambrick Sleeves and could easily pin on a Pair for she never took any farther Trouble about them I think I must for the rest refer my Reader to the Lady's Dressingroom for  In such a Case few Words are best  And  Strephon  bids us guess the rest  I really 'till I saw this Wretch ima∣gined the Dean had only mustered up all the dirty Ideas in the World in one Piece on Purpose to affront the Fair Sex as he used humorously to stile old Beggarwomen and CinderPickers  This makes me digress to relate a Com∣pliment of his to some Ladies who supped with him of which I had the Honour to be One The Dean was giving us an Ac∣count of some Woman who he told us was the nastiest filthiest most stinking old  Bch that ever was yet seen except the Company Ladies except the Company for that you know is but civil We all bowed could we do less  From the Time I had the Misfortune of being her Tenant she invited every Person she had any Acquaintance with to see me as tho' I had been some outlandish Monster or wonderful Curiosity Amongst the rest she prevailed on the now Ld Chf Jstce  Ee  then a Stu∣dent in  GraysInn  a fine Gentleman po∣etically turned and somewhat too much upon the effeminate or delicate Order to bear whatever was not quite refined to venture into her DiningRoom where I sat scribbling I was for retiring but that was not permitted The Gentleman who was dressed in black Velvet and had the Air of a Person of Distinction said he hoped as his Visit was intended entirely to me I would not be so unkind as to refuse it  I said I did not know how I was enti∣tled to such an Honour but since he was pleased to bestow it on me I should with Gratitude accept of it My Hostess for  that Name by her Bulk far above the common Size of Females she seemed to deserve prudently left the Stranger and I to ourselves under Pretence that she must at∣tend her Shop Mr  Ee  seeing my Table covered with written Papers told me my Room resembled that of a Law∣yer and asked me Leave to read my Contemplations to which I agreeing he had the Complaisance to seem entertained when to my unspeakable Confusion the Brute returned and cried  "What will you treat the Lady with"  Any thing she chuses"  returned he and seemed as much confounded as I was  "Pray Madam what do you like"  "No∣thing at present Sir but what I have ordered some Coffee"  as it was but Five o'Clock in the Afternoon and as the Gentleman was remarkable for Sobriety he approved of my Taste He offered to pay for it  "I told him I did not sell it and that he could not more highly ag∣grieve me"  My Landlady sent it up but did not think proper to partake of our Repast of  which I was very glad he looked on me with Eyes of great Compassion especially as he observed the Tears springing from mine for indeed I was quite shocked he asked me how I became acquainted with a Person so very unlike myself I told him I was a Stranger and knew very little of her as he gave Credit to my Words he advised me to quit her House assuring me she was a Procuress and as he said kept a Shop only to disguise her real Occupation  He had scarce finished his friendly Cau∣tion when Madam entered again with two very large Lobsters in one Hand and a Bottle of Wine in the other she laid a very foul Table Cloth dressed her Fish and invited us to partake which we refusing she eat them all herself drank the Bottle of Wine and very modestly desired the Gentleman to pay for them to which he acquiesced  This Scene made us laugh heartily for she fed with such keen Dispatch and drank so often that she seemed like a starved Pierot devouring all before her  Her Rage of Hunger being now as we hoped suppressed she once more left us and Mr  Ee  said  "I hope you are now convinced Madam that at least your Reputation will be un∣done if you continue here"  I answered  "It was but too true but that at pre∣sent I saw no Method of Relief as she owed me Money which she never was bashful in borrowing by which means I was ill provided to remove and had agreed to take it out in Board and Lodging"  Here Madam once more rushed in when to my great Surprize she asked Mr  Ee  would he give her a roasted Fowl and Sausages for Supper He told her after so plentiful a Meal as she had just made he was sure she did but jest She affirmed she was in earnest and that if he would not there was a Gentleman below that would  Mr  Ee  who had a Mind to hold more Talk with me asked me what Part of the House belonged to me She answered with matchless Impudence a  very good Bedchamber which she sup∣posed we should have no Objection to as we liked each other so well  I seemed not to take the Meaning of her Speech and not having the least Appre∣hension of any Incivility being offered to me by a Person of good Breeding and Humanity I told the Gentleman he should be very welcome if he pleased to walk into itas it was on the same Floor he said I did him great Honour and that he would wait on me  However to avoid the evil Comments which wicked Persons judging others by themselves are ever ready to make I left the Door wide open to the no small Mor∣tification of my Landlady and her new Guest as they were obliged to pass by it  And what should he be but some drunken Swabber or Boatswain whose Tarpaulin Compliments of which we heard every Word distinctly for some time diverted us 'till at last their Talk became so of∣fensive that as I had left the Door open in Point of Decency I was now on the same Account obliged to shut it  The Gentleman once more urged the Necessity of my Departure from this vil∣lainous Woman assuring me if I would but change my Lodging and send a Line to him with a Direction where to find me he would do every thing in his Power to serve distressed Merit as he was please to term it  And that nothing might be wanting to enable me to do it he in a very polite Manner obliged me to accept of two Guineas as a Subscription to my Wri∣tings  This ingenious Gentleman entertained me with the Recital of several beautiful poetical Compositions of his own and finding I was not quite tasteless but at least endeavoured to give them due Praise he stayed with me 'till Ten o'Clock no unseasonable Hour as it was in the Month of  June  when either being hungry himself or willing to entertain me he insisted on my Permission to send to the  Devil Tavern  for some Supper a Meal I never chuse but in Complaisance to my Benefactor and also as a Means of en∣gaging  his further Conversation which was truly elegant I with some Reluc∣tance submitted to Our one Maid be∣ing gone for the other Bowl of Punch for the Sailor the Gentleman went and be∣spoke it himself  I could not in his Absence but reflect how much the unhappy Part of Women disappoint even their own Ends for when they throw off the Appearance of Modesty and shew the mercenary Prosti∣tute unveiled no Man of common Under∣standing can have the least Regard for them Mr  Addison  observes of some Wo∣man who kept a noted House of civil Reception that she said no Girl was fit even for her who was past blushing Well said the Dean in the following Lines  O Decency coelestial Maid  Descend from Heaven to Beauty's Aid  Tho' Beauty may beget D  sire  'Tis thou must fan the Lover's Fire  To hold him in Delusion still  And make him fancy what you will  And I do assure my Reader I did not forget to return Thanks to the Almighty who had enabled me to live by his Gifts to me for sure I am that I could raise no Money by vile Means  By Heav'n I had rather coin my Heart for Gold  And drop my Blood for Drachma's  Shakespeare  Mr  Ee  's Return broke off my Contemplation he had ordered a slight but elegant Repast with a Flask of  Cham∣paigne  we supped together with great Pleasure and except the dissonant and unharmonious Noise made by our Neigh∣bours who were now got so merry that they did what they called sing we had no Interruption but talked of History Poetry and every Muselike Theme called all the mighty Dead before us rejudged their Acts commented on the Works of  Milton Shakespear Spencer  and all the  British  Classics  Refin'd Delight and fitted to endure  But what can human Happiness secure  Delany  The Star that ushers in the rosy Dawn began to reassume her Empire o'er the Dusk and drowsy World the Bell tolled One a Signal of Departure to my amiable Guest whose kind Injunctions in regard to my Removal I promised to obey  The Maid whom her Mistress half starved and though she was really her Betters used so ill that she downright hated her told me that the Sailor and she were gone to Bed together both dead drunk  And yet this Creature would talk of Virtue nay go to Church but to say the Truth she only went there to pick up a Gallant  As I was not in the least sleepy I dis∣missed the Servant and  Revolving in my clouded Soul  The various Turns of Things below  Now and then a Sigh I stole  And Tears began to flow  I open'd the Window looked at the Moon  Riding near her highest Noon  Like One who had been led astray  Thro' the Heav'ns wide pathless Way  And oft as if her Head she bow'd  Stooping thro' a fleecy Cloud  In short I was wrapped in a pleasing Fit of Melancholy and had I been in the Country midst vernal Airs and Blooms should have attuned my rural Minstrelsy to some high Theme but alas Ease and Retirement those Friends to the Muse ever were denied to me being in a popu∣lous City pent amidst the busy Hum of Men obliged to work for daily Bread and often not obtaining even that poor Pittance  Oh that I could now retire that some charitable Hand would bestow on my poor  Remains of Life even but a Clay Habita∣tion in some sequestered Scene where  On ev'ry Thorn delightful Wisdom grows  In ev'ry Rill a sweet Instruction flows  How happy should I think myself  My Readers will I hope acknow∣ledge I deal candidly with them when I not only acquaint them with my Actions but reveal to them even the inmost Re∣cesses of my Soul as freely as to Heaven  At length remembering that Nature requires a Time of Rest I thought it but meet to indulge the pleasing Heavi∣ness or in plainer Language I went to Bed and enjoyed the Honeydew of Sleep 'till it was very late in the Day  It seems the Maid had on purpose to mortify her Mistress told her how genteely Mr  Ee  had entertained me which though she herself had been guilty of such foul Intemperance and swinish Gluttony raised her Indignation to such a Height  that she downright affronted me telling me I had no Business with her Gallant Why said I sure you had him all to your∣self I did not interfere for I supposed she meant honest Tar but it seems I was mistaken for it was Mr  Ee  whom she had so politely dismissed and whom now she had called a hundred Scrubs as∣suring me she could never make any thing of him and really I believed her and by what I then saw of her Temper I am certain had she known he had made me a Present I should not have escaped with∣out a good Beating  Well said she at last I warrant I had a better Chap than your fine Beau this was speaking pretty plain my Man gave me a Crown and Victuals and Liquor enough Now be sincere what did that Mr  Maiden  give you For what said I I have nothing to sell you who keep a Shop and are in the way of Trade may easily dispose of five Shillings Worth of Goods  The Wretch knew not what Answer to make to me to acknowledge herself a Prostitute as I did not seem to think her one was too vile even for her and to have given but the most remote Hint that she suspected any evil Correspondence between Mr  Ee  and me laid her absolutely at our Mercy  However she turned off the Discourse with what Mr  Addison  terms a HorseLaugh an excellent Expedient to supply the Lack of Brains and which whoever can secure on their Side are sure of Victory for who can stand it let it be ever so in∣judiciously bestowed  This I have very lately experienced when one  Wdwrd  a Player got the Laugh against me who never vied with his superior Excellence only by saying  What shall a Tumbler set me thus adrift  I the Successor of immortal  Swift  Oh that his Words had been true that he had bequeathed to me the precious Legacy of his Wit and Learning  Or that when all sublim'd he rose to Heaven  I had inherited his sacred Mantle  Then midst the Prophets might I in Strains  Such as delight the Ear of God pour forth Unfetter'd Harmony  But to descend to this terrene Spot I drest and wandered forth in quest of a new Lodging not well knowing this Part of the Town I past through a very clean Court all inhabited by Jewellers and just opposite to the End of it saw on the Window of what they in  London  call a Twist Shop a Bill up to let the first Floor The Woman of the House shewed me the Apartment the Furniture was not only new but rich and I concluded the Price would be too high for me but to my great Surprise the Woman of the House agreed not only to furnish me with Linen but also with Plate and China for Five Shillings a Week there was but one In∣convenience which was that there was no Passage into the House but through the  Shop to which if they did not object I had no Cause It so fortuned that the Countess of  Essex  's Woman whom I had known at the Laundress's beforemen∣tioned came in and gave me so high a Character that we agreed on my taking Possession of my new Apartment the next Day  I went from this to a Friend's to Dinner and did not return Home till Ten at Night but never in my Life was I more highly provoked for lo my Land∣lady and some Fellow or other were in my Bed the Maid never apprized me of it being willing to expose her brutal Mis∣tress to the utmost but shewed me into the Chamber  I am certain I was infinitely more ashamed than she was for she called to me to sit down on the Bed side but I hastened out and as I could not take up with her Bed I was obliged to sit up all Night  Pretty soon in the Morning a Woman came to see me she and I packed up my Clothes called a Porter and made him carry them to my new Abode and as I  hoped never to see the Wretch again I did not bid her Adieu  My Landlord was a MasterTaylor in very good Circumstances and his Wife a very sober modest Woman  I past a Week over very calmly when remembering my Promise to Mr  Ee  I wrote a Line to him but as I did not know what Street I was in I enquired of my Landlady who with very great Re∣luctance told me it was  DruryLane  I was extremely concerned at this Piece of Information which she observed and as∣sured me I might enquire into her own and her Husband's Character that they had kept their Lodgings empty sooner than let them to any idle Person though they could have had a good Price for them and a great deal more to the same effect all which though I did most sted∣fastly believe yet I held it no proper Place for me of all Persons in the World to reside in  Women whose Characters are unble∣mished or who have their Husbands  with them as Guardians to it may do a thousand Things which those who have fallen on evil Days and evil Tongues in Prudence must avoid  I did not directly tell my Landlady that I must leave her being resolved if pos∣sible not to remove till I could find a Place where I could be fixed  Accordingly I once more took my Way to  St James  's and called upon my old Landlady there Her first Floor was let but the second being tolerably genteel we as we had always been on very friendTerms soon made a Bargain for it and I was to enter on it as soon as my Week for the other was up The very Air of  St James  's always pleased me and indeed I received so many Favours from the Nobili∣ty that I had just Cause to prefer it to any other Part of  London  This happened to be some public Festi∣val which as I did not recollect I sat with the good old Gentlewoman till Even∣ing when on my return Home there was a large Bonfire and a great Crowd at the  TempleGate I stopped a little being star∣tled and not well knowing how to pass by when an old Gentleman very well drest ask∣ed me where I was going I told him which was Truth I had mistaken my Way being a Stranger He said if I'd let him know where I lived he would wait on me Home I was almost ashamed to do it yet considering they were creditable Peo∣ple where I lodged I ventured to inform him My Landlord happened to be his Taylor so he readily conducted me to his House the People saluted him and ask∣ed him for his Lady and Family Why said he this is one of them she is a near Relation to my Wife I was surprized at this new Kindred and could not tell whether the old Gentleman spoke Truth or not though I could not recollect I had ever seen him be∣fore yet as the Landlord treated him with the highest Respect I thought it not con∣venient to contradict him so I invited him in and wondered where this would end  My Landlady lighted us up to my Din∣ingroom he told her I had dined at his  House and that after so long a Walk I must needs be dry and therefore desired her to get him a Bottle of Wine and a Plate of  Scotch  Collops from some particular Tavern he directed her to  As I found the old Gentleman did not stick at telling one Lye I concluded all he said was false as it really was  She no sooner departed but he asked me whether he was not an able Politician I said he was a merry Gentleman and I hoped as I had the Honour of being his Cousin he would let me know who he was lest I should be asked any cross Questions and our Accounts should vary  He told me his Name and where he lived that he had a considerable Estate and also a good Employment under the Government all of which did not make him happy because Heaven had not blessed him with a Child  He then asked me who I was for he said he was sure I had had a good Edu∣cation As I had no reason to doubt of his Sincerity I told him my Story with which he seemed much affected and in  Conclusion I assured him I was more un∣happy in having Children from whom in all probability I was for ever separated than he could be who never had one  Here my Landlady brought in Supper to which he invited her to stay our Con∣versation turned on general Topics it grew pretty late when to my great Astonish∣ment the Gentleman said  "Cousin I think you told me you wanted Mo∣ney I have a good deal of your's in my Hands though not much about me at present however here are a couple of Guineas when you want Fifty you know where to come"  Would I did thought I but it was no time for me to refuse them  When he went away I knew not what to think of this odd Adventure sometimes I fancied it was a Dream and dreaded to wake lest the Gold should vanish then I began to flatter myself that perhaps some Relation had left me a Legacy but hav∣ing never since my Distress received the smallest Favour from one of them I could hardly hope they should now feel any com∣punctuous  Visitings of Nature who were all to me remorseless as the Sea  In short the more I thought the more I was perplexed and could only humbly hope that the protecting Hand of him who  Doth the Raven feed  Yea providentially catereth for the Spar∣row  Assisted me to live for some good End  Best to his Wisdom known  So recommending myself to his paternal Care who had Compassion on my Sor∣rows I went to my Repose  Early next Morning the Woman of the House told me there was a Lady wait∣ing for me in the Diningroom so I arose and who should it be but my late odious Landlady  My Reader may judge how welcome she was She told me there was a Gentle∣woman waiting for me at her House who had Business of the utmost Consequence and very much to my Advantage to im∣part  to me Though I scarce gave Credit to her yet Curiosity made me accompany her Home where I beheld a marvellous illfavoured old Woman her Chin which had on it a comely black Beard almost met her Nose there not being a Tooth in the Way to bar their Union I am sure had  Don Quixote  seen her he would have endeavoured to disenchant her Mustachio's Her Eyes were black and fierce her Back nobly prominent her Dress tawdry and take her for all in all I hope I never shall look upon her Like again I was doubtful whether it was not a Man in Woman's Clothes but if it were a Crea∣ture of the Feminine Gender I concluded it must be a Witch and that the Study of the Black Art had made her so hairy about the Face that she had need of a Barber But to proceed She accosted me very ci∣villy in a deep  Connaught  Brogue told me she knew all my good Family and lived in the same Parish with me in  Dublin  I soon grew tired of her fulsome Flattery to me and them and desired to know her Commands she told me my Lord  Gl∣wy  had a great Regard for my Fa∣ther and was very desirous of seeing meand would be a Friend to me and if I would dine with her next Day he would meet me I now began to guess at my Lady's Occupation and gave her a point blank Denial not but that I should have been glad to see his Lordship as I knew he had a Regard for my Father but a Woman must appear in a comtemptible Light when introduced to a Nobleman by one of the Devil's Agents So I left Madam to her Meditations and departed to her no small Discomfort for it was a gol∣den Guinea out of her Way as it seems my Lord's Price was two one of which he presented to Madam Procuress and the other to the Lady who granted him a Fa∣vour  This infernal Embassadress had taken on her the Name of  Cunningham  being as she said ruined by a Gentleman of that Name who had recommended her to se∣veral of the  Irish  Noblemen as a very necessary Person Oh how detestable it is  to feed a Maw or clothe a Back by such a filthy Vice  Well at the appointed Time I re∣turned to  St James  's and the first Day I was there I was honoured with a Letter from Lord  Glwy  as follows  MADAM  I Thought I had had the Honour of be∣ing known to you but find I have been imposed upon if you will permit me to pay my Respects to you this Evening I will unfold this Mystery to you and am very sincerely  Madam  Your most obedient Servant G  I returned my Compliments to his Lord∣ship and gladly excepted of the Honour of his Company  About Six he came and related to me the Trick Mrs  Cunningham  had put on  him he told me he had employed her to find me out having a Curiosity to see a Person he had so often heard of both at  White  's and in  Ireland  that the Appoint∣ment was made and a Lady introduced to him whom by his Description of her I knew to be the odious Mrs  Smith  my shocking Landladyhe said he was much disappointed when he saw her but the Lady was very kind nay so kind that he could not resist her  As you stood at your Window this Morning Colonel  Dnebe  asked me knowing I was one of the Commis∣sioners of  Ireland  whether I knew you I answered noWhy said he that is a little  Irish  Muse a Physician's Daugh∣ter and a Parson's Wife an eloped one I have been told but she won't confess that on this I asked your Name the Colonel said it was  Pilkington  but you were usually called Mrs  Meade  I then found I had been deceived and wrote immediately to you  I told his Lordship I had the Honour of having many Representatives which  had been of very great Disadvantage to my Character inasmuch as they were pretty liberal of their Favours which were placed to my Account though I knew nothing of the Matter My Lord said that was hard but he hoped now he had found the real Mrs  Pilkington  she would not be inexorable To turn off this Sort of Dis∣course I talked of public Affairs which put my Lord in the Head of making me pacquet Commissioner  Thmpsn  then Candidate in the Election for the City of  Yrk  with old  English  Rhymes after the Manner of Mother  Shipton  's Pro∣phecies to inform him of the Defeat he was to meet with in that Year I had the good Fortune to divert him with my co∣mical Stuff so well that he left me a Task which was to translate a  French Chanson à boire  he gave me a couple of Guineas and promising to be a frequent Visitor he took his Leave  I do assure my Readers I was very glad to be retained as his Lordship's Muse and Secretaryan Employment both of Honour and Profit  I continued in Favour some Time and we bantered half the Nobility either about their LoveIntrigues or Parliamentary Af∣fairs all of which were well known to his Lordship who honoured me with his Con∣fidence and Instruction  But as all Happiness fades away an un∣foreseen Accident blasted mine  My Lord was seized with a Fever which confined him some Days the first Time he was able to go Abroad he wrote me Word he would pass the Evening with me About his appointed Hour somebody tapped at the Diningroom Door which I opened when instead of my Lord en∣tered Colonel  Dncbe  and Mr  Spncr  whom the Colonel pre∣sented to me and made his  Exit  This Nobleman was no more like his Brother than I to  Hercules  for the first Thing he did was to doublelock the Door put the Key in his Pocket and by main Strength oblige me to sit on his Knee I told him I expected Lord  Gl∣wy  but that had no Effect for he swore he should not have Admittance he  said he was as well entitled to a Lady's Favour as any Lord It was to no Purpose for me to assure him my Lord never asked any but what were consistent with Ho∣nour He gave no Credit to my Words and seeing he had set me weeping he said my Lord was very happy in my Love but that he was not worthy of it being an Inconstant but as for me added he I do not come to pay you one Visit but to make you mine for ever to raise such Me∣rit above Distress and to make you as happy as I can  Sir returned I your Goodness deserves my Acknowledgment but your Meaning seems doubtful on what Terms am I to receive those Advantages On the easiest and sweetest in the World said he give me your Love in return it is all I wish and running on with Lord  Hastings  's Speech in his Midnight Visit to poor  Jane Shore  he cried  Be kind my charming Mistress to my Wishes  And satisfy my panting Heart with Beauty  It was in vain for me to remonstrate that he had a fine young Lady of his own that I was not worth the Pains he took that I was not handsome He said I pleased him and that to him was Beauty which he was resolutely determined to possess if not by Consent he would make use of Force  And truly the Gentleman would soon have convinced me he was the stronger had not Lord  Glwy  knocked at the Door he swore I should not open it My Lord called to me and said he would break the Door open I begged of Mr  Spncr  to permit me to let him in and that if he would stay a Moment I would frame some handsome Excuse to dis∣miss him  He gave me the Key and went into the Bedchamber I opened the Door for Lord  Glwy  who brought with him the Earl of  Mddx  a fine Gentleman Lord  Glwy  was either very angry or affected to appear so and really I knew not what Apology to  make only to say I had been asleep The Noblemen seated themselves to the no small Vexation of Mr  Spncr  Lord  Glwy  asked me who was in the Bedchamber I said Nobodywell Madam said he I know you are a Lady of Veracity but for once I presume to doubt it so saying he made to the Door which stood open and Mr  Spncr  clapped it in his Face doubledlocked it withinside and to my great Happiness went out of another Door down Stairs this I was very glad of be∣ing apprehensive of a QuarrelLord  Glwy  was in a violent Pas∣sion and insisted on my telling him what Fellow as he called him affronted him So to satisfy him I very ingenuously told him the whole Story to the infinite Mirth of Lord  Mddx  who I thought would have died with Laughter for amongst other Accidents I had in the Fray lost a little  Paris  Cap I wore and as my Hair was very thick never missed it  But whatever I could say would by no Means pacify Lord  Glwy  he  called me twenty ungrateful Devils and Jilts and I know not what which sur∣prized me the more as I never in my Life imagined he loved me and consequently could not form any Idea of his being jea∣lous but I suppose his Pride was piqued at being locked out which was the real Cause of his Resentment  Lord  Mddx  in vain pleaded my Cause till at last an odd Whim of his turned our Tragedy to a Farce  Lord  Mddx  it seems liked an  Italian  Singer on whom Lord  Ry∣md  a very small Gentleman with a Mind in Proportion to his diminutive Fi∣gure had wrote a very stupid Satire he begged of me to write a LoveLetter to him for he was it seems a Man of Gal∣lantry and his Answer I was to commu∣nicate at  White  's  As I was a perfect Stranger to his Cha∣racter the Nobleman dictated a fine En∣comium on his Learning Wit Poetry Beauty  c  all of which united had it seems made a Conquest of me unheard unseen and made me extremely ambitious  of being known to so accomplished a No∣bleman we also gave him some Poetry and a Direction where to find his most enamoured Nymph This done the Letter was dis∣patched away to  Bondstreet  and the Messenger brought Word I should have an Answer in the Morning  I know whoever reads this may very possibly censure me but all who are de∣pendant on the Favours of the Great must comply with their Whimsies it is enough if we are so conscientious as not to be made a Slave to their Vices as  Rbt Ngt  Esq  civilly asked me to be  Now as I have mentioned this Fellow for such is the Term his Behaviour to me merits who am in this in the same Mind with  Pope  I do not mean a Fellow of T C D  That  Worth makes the Man and want of it the Fellow  The rest is all but Leather and Prunella  I hope my Reader will allow me to give them a short Sketch of him with Regard  to me and also of the Mortification I had the Happiness of giving him  My Father attended his first Wife Lady  Ella Pkt  and I had I believe passed twenty Evenings in his Company in  Dublin  he had published a Poem written by the Rev Mr  Sterling  called  Happiness  as his own and another on his Conversion from  Popery  inscribed to  Wm Py  now Earl of  Bh  to whose Piety he was indebted for his being drawn out of Error This gave me a fine Opportunity of paying him a Com∣pliment which I sent to  White  's he sent me Word he would wait on me that Eve∣ning accordingly he came  After his first Salutation he very po∣litely asked me if I could help him to a W telling me he had married an ugly old Devil for Money whom he hated and wanted a Girl to take into Keeping which he depended on my Skill to chuse for him I thanked him for the honourable Employment he recommended to me but assured him it was not in my Power to serve him as I never conversed  with Women He told me he would not be a Friend to me on any other Terms I said I was sorry for it so making him a Reverence I left the Room He stayed in it some Time hoping I suppose I was gone of his Errand but finding I did not return he went away but to do him Justice he left Half a Gui∣nea on the Table as a Recompence for the Affront he had given me  He wanted it seems to be admitted as a Member of the Club at  White  's their Way of Election is by ballotting and one black Bean is sufficient to overturn any Man's Pretension to that Honour I told my Story so effectually that they all con∣cluded him unfit for Society and as many Friends as he imagined he had amongst three hundred Nobles and as vast a For∣tune as his Wife had brought him he had but one white Bean in the whole Draught  However I return him Thanks for his Ten and Sixpence to shew my Gratitude  But to return to my little Lord  Rymd  Early next Morning as I was drinking Tea his Valet de Chambre  said he must speak to me I desired he might come in he was a  Frenchman  who contrary to the rest of his Country was as boorish as an  English  Farmer he threw down a Letter on the Table  "Dere my Lord send a you dat"  I opened it and read as follows  MADAM  BY your Stile you ought to be a Gen∣tlewoman but I have met with Things of this Kind which did not an∣swer Expectation I have sent my Man to see you whom I always trust and so may you if he likes you and you will come where I appoint for I never venture to visit any Woman I will meet you  I am  MADAM  Your's RYMD  While I was perusing this gallant Epistle the  Frenchman  looked sharp about he even opened the Corner Cup∣board then he demanded of me what did I want with his Lorde I could not resist my Inclination to laugh at which he grew choleric and swore Garzoon he should never come which I being quite easy about he went away muttering some∣thing  I sent his Letter which was wrote in a very bad Hand and almost every Word misspelt to Lord  Mddx  who shewed it to the Company at  White  's on whom it took the same Effect it had done on me for they all laughed heartily at  JackaDandy  a Nickname Lord  Mx  had bestowed on him  These two merry Noblemen who had set me on this Scheme would fain have prevailed on me to send another Letter to  JackaDandy  but I told them I did not approve of a Man governed by his Man and one who seemed to be a Coward into the Bargain Lord  Mddx  then  me Lord  Rymd  had some Reason to be fearful how he made an Assignation as he had once the Misfortune to be taken in by a Billetdoux and when he went to the appointed Place instead of a fine Lady found a Couple of sturdy Fellows who gave him a very good Cudgelling  This put me in mind of a merry Story told me in  London  of Col  Cnnm  who took Delight in paying his Addresses to young Ladies merely for Amusement and no sooner did he perceive he had gained their Affection but he despised his Conquest  As the Noblemen knew him I related one Story to them out of many of a pleasant Revenge a forsaken Nymph took on him  This Lady was of exceeding good Birth very well accomplished and of unblemished Reputation but not of Fortune equal to his however he seemed so fond that she supposed that would be no Obstacle and intirely devoted herself to the Pleasure of loving him which he no sooner perceived but he grew cold civil and respectful  and at last went to  London  without so much as bidding her Farewel  Her Stepfather Brigadier  Vsy  having some Call there took his Lady and her Children with him where though Miss  At  for that was the Lady's Name frequently saw the Colonel at Court he never took the least Notice of her but seemed as never acquainted This as we may presume sufficiently grieved her she made her Complaint to a Female Confidante a Lady of Quality and a Wo∣man of Spirit between them they con∣trived at least to give his Vanity a terri∣ble Mortification  They wrote to him a Letter as from a married Dutchess who was fallen in Love with him at Court the Chairman had Di∣rections to wait for his Answer but they took Care that he should not be able to guess who sent itall that the Colonel could discover was that it was given to him in the Street and he was ordered to leave the Answer at a Mercer's where it would be safe delivered to the Person who wrote the Letter  This Secrecy made him quite sure he had gained the Heart of some highborn Fair he failed not to send a passionate and tender Return for so great an Honour as the unknown Charmer had done him The Ladies received it and were glad to find the Gudgeon swallow the Bait so gree∣dily Next Night he took care to dress himself with the utmost Magnificence and as he is really a graceful Person he made no doubt but the Lady would by some favourable Glance discover herself to him to this End he went to Court and strictly examined the Countenance of every Lady of Quality there to no Purpose which only made him suppose the Lady extremely discreet and careful of her Re∣putation  His imaginary Mistress made several Appointments with him then sent him Word her Lord was come to Town or some Apology 'till at last tired with their Sport they resolved to finish it  To this End he received a Letter that the Lady could not find out any Place where she could without Danger of Dis∣covery  meet him except at his own House but begged that he might not let any of his Servants be in the Way that she would come in a Chair exactly at Ten one small Tap at the Door being the Signal for Happiness  Never did KnightErrant propose to himself more Glory in the finishing of an Adventure than did our happy Colonel at his near approaching Bliss he had framed to himself an Idea of a perfect Beauty kind tender and formed for Love his Answer was all Rapture and Acknow∣ledgment  His Apartments were filled with Wax Lights himself curled perfumed and dressed to such Advantage who could re∣sist that beheld him He punctually o∣beyed the Ladies Commands in dis∣missing all the Servants with Orders not to appear and waited the happy Minute with the Impatience of a real Lover every Moment he looked at his Watch and thought the Hours Ages  At length the long wished for Signal was given he flew to receive the Fairone  when a Porter delivered a Bandbox into his Hand and without speaking a Word to him vanished Never was any Man in greater Confusion than he at opening it he there found not only all his own soft Epis∣tles but also a little Doll in a Chair with a Letter in her Hand directed to him the Purport of which was to let him know he was a conceited Coxcomb to suppose any Woman of Quality had the least Re∣gard for him and that the Lady who held that was a Mistress good enough for him  The Noblemen thanked me for my Narration and wished the Trick had been put on  JackaDandy  such a Lady being a much more suitable Match for him than the Colonel however we all agreed that this was no Tax on the Gentleman's Un∣derstanding  Since let a Man be ne'er so wise  He may be caught with sober Lyes  And that his Appearance might captivate a Lady without any Miracle  Lord  Mddx  did me the Honour to subscribe and assured me he would pre∣vail  on as many of his Friends as he could to do me the same Favour  Next Day Colonel  Duncombe  asked me did I know such a Gentleman of  Ireland  as  Lfts He  Esq  I said I did particularly well as my Brother and he were inseparable Companions in the Col∣lege he told me there was a Parcel of Letters freed by the Earl  Thomond  then just dead lying for him at  White  's and that he should be very glad to see him to learn some Account of the Particulars of Lord  Thomond  's Death with whom he had for many Years a strict Friendship  As I had learned by Accident where Mr  He  lived I wrote to let him know what the Colonel said he sent me a Letter of Thanks and that he would do himself the Honour of meeting the Colonel the next Evening at my Apart∣ment  It so fortuned that my kind Benefactor Mr  Cibber  came over with the Colonel and a little after came Mr  He  his Politeness and the many pleasing Inci∣dents of our younger Days gave me  infinite Delight as it was a Proof that I was not an Impostor and convinced the Auditors I had once been in Esteem even in my own Country  After a good deal of agreeable Chat wherein Mr  He  took an Opportunity of mentioning his having when he was in the College spent his whole Year's Al∣lowance in making one grand Ball and that as on this Occasion he was in Dis∣grace with his own Father he quartered himself on mine praising his elegant man∣ner of living and the kind Reception he always received from him which as he said he must ever acknowledge to his Family Mr  Cibber  said he hoped as I was the only desolate Person belonging to it he would be so good as to assist me He asked how it was in his Power Why returned he this poor Lady is obliged to publish her Writings by Subscription and I dare say a Gentleman of her own Coun∣try who has so fine a Fortune and knows her so many Years will at least be as kind as Strangers have been to her With∣out  doubt Sir said Mr  He  it is the Duty of every Gentleman to do it so rising he told me he was very sorry he was under an Engagement to the Duke of  Devonshire  but that he would take ano∣ther Opportunity of paying his Respects to me which same Opportunity as he never found in  London  I hope he will in  Ireland  and have such a Dependance on his Honour that I am certain he will keep it in being my Friend  As I had the Honour of being once a kind of a Favourite to Alderman  Barber  I judged him a very proper Person both as he had been a Printer and was also a Man of considerable Interest to apply to both to increase my Subscription and to put me into a Method of getting my Wri∣tings printed as cheap as I could to this end I wrote him a very respectful Letter but received no Answer I followed it with a Second still he was silent at length I found a Method to make him speak to me for recollecting the best Part of a very severe Satyr Mr  Pn  had  wrote on him I let him know I had it on which he invited me to his House re∣ceived me very kindly apologized for his Silence being ill of the Gout which had hindered him from answering me and as∣sured me as soon as he was able to go abroad he would present me as a Compa∣nion to the Dutchess of  Buckingham  who had promised to take one of his Recom∣mendation and who he said being in the Decline of Life and having no Children would he was certain if I had the good Fortune to please her remember me in her Will but unhappily for me the Al∣derman died a few Days after nor did the Dutchess long survive him  So vanished my Hopes  A short time after this Disappointment which sensibly affected me my Landlady told me there was an ugly squinting old Fellow who said he had Business of the utmost Consequence and must speak to me I bid her shew him up and found he answered her Description he asked me was my Name  Meade  I said yes why  then said he I am come to inform you that there is a Legacy of five hundred Pounds left you by one Mr  Clark  who died last Week at  St Edmondsbury  but the Lady I was ordered to inquire for is Mr  Pn  's Wife are you the Person I told him the Direction was very right but that I neither was related to nor even ac∣quainted with any Person of the Name of  Clark  from whom I had the smallest Rea∣son to hope for such a Favour Nay Madam returned he as you have changed your Name why may not he Upon this he shewed me a Letter to my Fancy au∣thentic wherein I was desired if living to wait on Counsellor  Clark  in  EssexStreet  in the  Strand  who had Orders to pay me the Money on Proof I was Mrs  Pil∣kington  I knew not what to make of all this I was in hopes the fickle Goddess who is well represented standing on a Wheel was for once in a good Humour with me and was resolved to make me amends for her former Caprice or to speak more seriously that the Supreme Almighty Being that Power who  Builds Life on Death on Change Du∣ration founds  And gives th' eternal Wheels to know their Rounds  had taken Compassion on my Sufferings  While I was lost in musing on this odd Adventure the old Fellow asked me very gaily if I would give him my Company to  Richmond  and take a Dinner with him I told him I never went abroad with Per∣sons I did not know especially Men he told me he was very capable of being ser∣viceable to me and that it was also in my Power to be so to him in what Sir Why I have received from  Ireland  from your Husband the Life of Alderman  Barber  wherein there is an Account of the Amours of  Cadenus  and  Vanessa  to which the Alderman was privy and related them to Mr  Pn  Now I have been informed you have some Letters of the Dean's which may embellish the Work and also a true Character of the Alderman written by his Chaplain I will make you  a handsome Consideration for them if you will give them to me to publish  This Discourse surprized me almost as much as the first I therefore begged he would not hold me any longer in Suspence but let me know who I conversed with He answered his Name was  Edmund Curl  upon which in spite of Vexation and the Disappointment of my newborn Hope I could not forbear laughing at the fine Scheme he had laid to trick me out of any valuable Manuscripts I might possibly pos∣sess so making him a Courtesy I said Farewel Legacy  I should not trouble the Reader with this Story but that I have been charged with writing the Life of the Alderman and as I shall answer it to God I never even saw it in my Life not but Curiosity would have engaged me to read it espe∣cially as I heard it was very well wrote but at the Time it was published I was a Prisoner in the  Marshalsea  and really had not a Crown to spare for a Book  As Mr  Curl  swore heartily that his Letter with regard to the Legacy was  genuine I went the next Day to Coun∣sellor  Clark  there was indeed an old Gen∣tleman of his name newly dead at  St Ed∣monsbury  who had Children and Grand∣children Heirs at Law sufficient to in∣herit his Fortune and as it happened he died intestate  However I comforted myself that Mr  Curl  had not made a Fool of me as he has done of many a better Writer and se∣cured me a Prisoner in his poetical Garret which the ingenious Mr  Fielding  charm∣ingly ridicules  But oh the dismal Summer which ever was attended with Want and all it's gloomy Train not only to me but many Persons who seem in good Circumstances left me quite desolate and obliged me to take a cheaper Lodging which I did in the House of one Mrs  Trifoli  in  Dukestreet St James  's a most extraordinary painted up bedizenedout old Woman whose Husband was a  German  Quack not then in  England  from which it seems his Wife had obliged him to fly for robbing her of a Deed of Settlement he had made to  her at Marriage but to say the Truth I think that was a Blessing to the poor Man for she was a very Devil incarnate un∣merciful and cruel to the last Degree I dare say she never in her Life gave even a Cup of Water or a Morsel of Bread to keep a poor Creature from starving  Her Custom was to live upon her Lodgers even when she knew they were desolately poor inasmuch that if one of them sent but for a Pint of SmallBeer she would intercept it in the Way and drink half of it but indeed she was very civil for she always sent them Word she drank their Healths and so she did in reality by depriving them of the Means of pre∣serving it  Being sadly distressed by this avaritious Wretch I was advised to apply to Dr  Mead  who was a Man of Taste and had sixty thousand Pounds left him to give in such Charities as he thought proper Ac∣cordingly I wrote him a moving Tale of my Distress which had so good an Effect that he sent me Word he would wait on me himself the next Day but not keeping his Word I addrest him in the following Lines  To Doctor  MEAD  SCARCE was the heavenly Virgin higher blest  When visited by a coelestial Guest  Hail'd by the glorious Messenger of Grace  And honour'd high above the human Race  Scarce stronger Rapture cou'd his Words impart  Than those which lately extasy'd my Heart  When You God's noblest Image here below  Your honour'd Presence promis'd to bestow  My Hope reviv'd I wak'd the silent String  The Muse once more attun'd her Voice to sing  Pleas'd that tho' long deprest by adverse Fate  She yet found Favour with the Good and Great  And that her melancholy flowing Strain  To Gen'rous MEAD was not addrest in vain  Oh Thou the Muses Judge the Muses Friend  Say must those Hopes in Disappointment end  Must ev'ry beauteous bright Idea fade  And Death enwrap me in his silent Shade  Death the poor suff'ring Wretch's last Re∣lief  Led in by paleey'd Want and pining Grief  Would Heav'n but one assisting Friend supply  How quickly might he bid those Sorrows fly  Whose Wisdom cou'd my Industry direct  And as that merited his Aid protect  Not thus with endless Application griev'd  And tho' so oft supported ne'er reliev'd  Pardon the bold Presumption of my Pray'r  Courage is oft extracted from Despair  The drowning Wretch struggles for Life awhile  Nor God nor Man condemns his anxious Toil  But if tempestuous Billows round him rise  And Heav'n all Pity all Relief denies  Lost in the Ocean he forgotten dies  I sent these Rhymes to the Doctor and in return was desired to come to his House in  Ormondstreet  at Four o'Clock that Afternoon  Now were my Hopes high raised high as the Spring Tide to which the Ebb quickly succeeds as it did with me I fancied vainly fancied at least ten Guineas in my Pocket and had like the Man with his Basket of Glasses turned them into Trade and purchased in my Mind an easy Subsistence for Life but I was a little mis∣taken in the Matter as the Sequel will shew I dressed myself very neatly and waited on the Doctor when I knocked at his Door a Footman with his Mouth very full and a Bone in his Hand opened it and in an  Irish  Accent demanded my Business I told him I wanted to speak to the Doctor  "By my own Shoul said he my Maishter will not be spoke to by Nobody"  Well then Friend if you please to let him know Mrs  Meade  is here I believe he will speak to me  "Mishtrish  Maide  replied he Arah are you vanting Charity and taakes up my Maishter's Name to claim  Kin with him well stay there I'll tell him"  So he went into a back Par∣lour but was quite confounded when the Doctor instantly came out and gave him a severe Reprimand for letting me stand in the Hall and I am very certain had I thought it worth my While to have ac∣quainted the Docter with his Insolence he would have been discharged A proper Caution to Liverywearing Fellows to speak with Civility to every Body  The Doctor shewed me into a handsome Streetparlour adorned with several Curio∣sities of which here needs no Account He asked me for Sir  John Meade  whom because he remembered he expected I should though he died two Years before I was born when I told him so he seemed displeased And really I remember that good Mr  Cibber  in his pleasant Way scolded me once for not remembering King  Charles  II though my Father was born in the Reign of King  William  As my Answers to the Doctor with re∣lation to the whole Family of the  Meades  were sufficient to convince him I was not an  Impostor he asked me how he could serve me I told him I had some Poems to publish but for Want of a little Money to pay for the Printing of them I could not proceed  "Poems returned he why did you ever know any Person get Mo∣ney by Poetry"  Yes Sir several Mr  Pope  in particular"  "Oh Lud Lud said he grinning horribly and squinting hideously what Vanity thou hast can you write like him"  I was quite abashed and really knew not what to say for some Moments for my Reader may easily perceive I could not but be sensible I had made a foolish Speech un∣aware to myself however upon Recollec∣tion I assured him I did not presume to put myself in any Degree of Comparison with so justly an admired Writer but that perhaps on Account of my Sex I might find a little Favour  Well said he there are a Couple of Gui∣neas for you This though far short of my Expectations was a little present Relief and as the Gentleman was under no Obliga∣tion  to reward or encourage me I very gratefully accepted of them and yet  Proud was the Muse I serv'd unbred to wait  A willing Stranger at a Great Man's Gate  And here gentle Reader give me Leave to trespass a Moment on your Patience to make one Remark which is that amongst all the Persons who are celebrated for be∣ing charitable I never met one really so and the most humane and beneficent are those whose Characters have been so at∣tacked for their Humanity that at last they have even been ashamed of welldoing  I remember Dr  Swift  told me he saw a Beggar attack at Bishop who charitably from his Abundance spared him a Half∣penny and said God bless you presently after he attacked Brigadier  Groves  who threw Half a Crown to him and bade Gd dm him which said he do you think the Beggar prayed for at Night  But as I have mentioned Dr  Meade  who was so much in Love with Mr  Pope  for saying  And Books for  Meade  and Rarities for  Sloane  I think I must give them also a Sketch of Sir  Has  to whom the Doctor advised me to apply as an Encourager of Arts I travelled down to  Chelsea  to wait upon him it snowed violently insomuch that I who had only a Chintz Gown on was wet to the Skin The Porter  memoran∣dum  better bred than his Master to whom I had sent up a Compliment which as he did not deserve I shall not do him the Ho∣nour to insert invited me into his Lodge where after about two Hours Attendance I was at length permitted to enter to his Supreme Maj  sty but sure the Pope him∣self in all his pontifical Robes never was half so proud I was conducted by an Es∣cort thro' six or seven Rooms one of which was entirely wainscotted if I may so term it with China but like the Idol to whom  a stately Temple was consecrated which a Traveller attracted by it's outward Mag∣nificence thought to find an adorable Deity in and on Search found a ridiculous Monkey so I saw an old Fellow whom I am very well convinced never saw me for he did not even vouchsafe to turn his Eyes off a Paper he was writing to see who came in till at last a BeggarWoman entered with a sore eyed Child the In∣side of whose Eyelids he very charitably tore out with a Beard of Corn under which cruel Operation the Girl fainted but he said that was good for her It may be so for by twoheaded  Janus  Nature has fra∣med strange Doctors in her Time  Some who will bid us live on Pulse and Water  And others of such Vinegar Aspect  They would not wag their Jaws in Way of Smile  Tho'  Nestor  swore the Jest were laugh∣able  Of this latter Sort was Sir  Hns  Tho' I had sent him up a Letter which lay before him he asked me what I wanted if I had bad Eyes he said he would brush them up for Charity but as they happened to be tolerably good I excused myself by tel∣ling him I had brought him that Letter and indeed I was quicksighted enough to find out that his Honour as the Beggarwoman called him was a conceited ridi∣culous imperious old FoolHe then considered my Letter over and finding by the Contents Dr  Mead  had recommended me to him said  "Poor Creature I sup∣pose you want Charity there is Half a Crown for you"  I could hardly resist a strong Inclination I had to quoit it as  Falstaff  says into his Face like a Threepenny Shovelgroat and was only con∣strained by the Consideration that I had never a Shilling in my Pocket and that little as it was I could eat for it  I have here done with the Great Sir  Hns Slne  Br of  Okm  and return to Dr  Meade  I had forgot to tell my Readers that re∣juicing at my Success when I returned from his House I threw the two Guineas up and had the Misfortune to lose one in a Chink of the Room the Board my Land∣lady would never permit me to remove lest as she said I should spoil her Floor This trivial Accident gave me a great deal of Uneasiness as it put me out of Power of paying and quitting her according to my Intention  However as I was obliged to live by my Wits which indeed were almost at an End I formed a Scheme to write a Pane∣gyric on  Pp  Lord  Hk  then newly created Ld Hh Cr of  Ed  I did not address him in the Manner I had done a great many of the Nobility that is with my one Poem which I sent all round like the Bishop's Pastoral Letter it was as  Swift  says  In another Reign  Change but the Name 'twill do again  I wrote a fire new one for himself which was really paying him a higher Compliment  than he deserved as my Readers may per∣ceive hereafter I had compleated the Poem and sent it to him he desired me to come to him on  Sunday  that being his only leisure Time  Accordingly I waited on him at Eight o'Clock on  Sunday  Morning the House had rather the Appearance of Desolation and Poverty than that of the Ld Chllr of  Brn  He had Complai∣sance enough to send his MaceBearer to keep me Company till such time as a Pair of Foldingdoors flew open and my Lord appeared in his Robes ready to go to Church he bowed down to the Ground to me and asked me if I would drink a Dish of Chocolate with him which you may not doubt I accepted of and was surprized to find myself though sunk in the most abject Poverty sitting with so great a Man  So for my Labour I got a Dish of  Mem Chocolate  a Word used by a very emi∣nent Comedian one Mr  Foote  for Satire  Chocolate which I now return with the  utmost Humility to his Ldp again  So my Lord went to Church where I also went I there saw Doctor  Meade  who perceiving his Lordship made me a low Bow made one four times as low and I could very hardly refrain laughing at them both and thinking  That all this World's a Stage and  All the Men and Women merely Actors  And that  If ev'ry just Man that now pines with Want  Had but a moderate and beseeming Share  Of that which lewdly pamper'd Luxury  Now heaps upon some Few with vast Excess  Nature's full Blessings would be well dis∣pens'd  In unsuperfluous even Proportion  And she no Whit encumber'd by her Store  And then the Giver would be better thank'd  His Praise due paid for swinish Glut∣tony  Ne'er looks to Heav'n amidst his gorgeous Feast  But with besotted base Ingratitude  Crams and blasphemes his Feeder  Milton's Comus  Well I could find no Remedy for the Consumption of my Purse nor borrow to linger out the Disease any where but from the Pawnbroker but he was always cha∣ritable  However I concealed my Distress with the utmost Care from my Landlady called every Morning for the Teakettle though I had no Teathen I said I was enga∣ged to dine abroad and took a solitary Walk to  WestminsterAbby  and ranged the solemn Isles alone envying those who rested in Peace from their Labours till at last having been three Days and three Nights without Food of any kind Heaven pardon me a melancholy Thought came into my Head that it was better to die at once than die daily and that as I could  not Fardles bear it was best to make my own  Quietus  and no longer strive to keep up a frail and feverish Being And here indeed I own I had been unmindful of the Crown which Virtue gives  After this mortal Coil to her true Ser∣vants  Despair vanquished me quite nay so art∣ful was the Enemy as even to persuade me I had a Right to dispose of my own Life especially when there did not seem even a Possibility of preserving it Filled with gloomy Ideas I took my usual Walk and took notice of the Corner between the Monuments of  Shakespear  and  Rowe  where I wished to be interred and that Mr  Pope  's Lines  How lov'd bow honour'd once avails me not  To whom related or by whom begot  An Heap of Dust alone remains of me  'Tis all I am 'tis all the Proud shall be  might be my Epitaph I really found room for Meditation even to Madness  In this Temper I went into  St James  's  Park  and seated myself by  Rosamond  's Pond the Moon apparent Queen un∣veiled her peerless Light and I waited in the silent Shade resolved to execute my dreadful Purpose as soon as I could do it without Observation when a young Lady and an old one both very well dressed seated themselves by me they in an ele∣gant Stile began to praise the sweet and solemn Beauties of the Moonlight Scene the Winds gently whispered through the fragrant Limetrees just then in full Flower and indeed though they were not vernal Airs they might have dissipated all Anguish but Despair Finding that not∣withstanding my Taciturnity the Ladies would enter into Conversation with me I could not in Point of good Breeding re∣fuse to return them Answers with as much Politeness as I was Mistress of till at length we were so pleased with each other that Time insensibly flying we found we were locked into the  Park  but the Ladies  whose Garden opened into it insisted on my accompanying them to Supper  We were let in at a Backdoor by a Servant in Livery to a very genteel House where on a Sopha sat a very handsome Man in a Gold Brocade NightGown to whom the young Lady presented me and said he was her Spouse the Cloth was ready laid and a cold Supper on the Table I would very fain have pre∣vailed on the Lady to permit me to go through her House home for I could ea∣sily perceive the Gentleman's Civility was quite forced and that he was impatient to revenge on his Wife the Liberty she had taken of inviting a Stranger in which in∣deed I believe she did on no other Ac∣count but that she thought Decency would prevent him from giving her a Beating of which it seems he was very liberal though he was but a Footman when the Lady married him and threw herself and twenty thousand Pounds away upon him as I afterwards learned  But as the late Earl of  Pembroke  ob∣served when he was told a Maid of Ho∣nour  who was very handsome was in Love with him notwithstanding he was an old Humpback'd Man but one of in∣finite Wit said  "Faith it may be so Women have strange Fancies"  I though foodless never spent three Hours more disagreeably especially as this House brought back to my Mind the Fear and Terror I always felt in Mr  Pn  's to which if my Father Mother or any Friend came it threw me into Agonies being well assured they would never de∣part without receiving some gross Affront such as the two following Stories trivial as they are may serve to illustrate  One  Alhallow  's Eve a Night of Plea∣sure and Disport in  Ireland  among the young Maidens and Batchelors my Brother and Sister who had invited some Persons agreeable to their own Age to celebrate it with them very fairly begged of us old Folks to go abroad to oblige them and myself also I begged of Doctor  Delany  who dined with us and my Father and Mother to come home with me and try  if we could not be as chearful as they I no sooner proposed the Scheme than they all agreed to it As my Father was no SupperMan I had ordered a Custard to be made for him and having a barnstable Oven it was put into it to bake  While we were amusing ourselves in a∣greeable Chat entered Mr  Pn  like the Description of Winter  Striding the gloomy Blast  and observing a Smoak occasioned by the lighting of the Oven he descended to ex∣amine the Contents thereof found the Custard eat most part of it and sent the Remainder out of Doors telling us to our Faces we should not liquor our Chops at his Expence though  memorandum  my dear Father always sent his Supper and Wine before him whenever he vouchsafed us the Honour of a Visit  The second Instance of my Spouse's Goodnature was that though he had no less than thirteen Hens he knowing I liked a newlaid Egg for my Supper watched  the Henroost close and every Egg was in a Basket sent to the Widow  Wrrn  covered with a Damask Napkin of which she got no less than eighteen given to me by Brigadier  Meade  At length one Even∣ing when my Husband was abroad my Brother and Sister came to visit me when the Clock struck Ten I concluded Mr  Pn  would not come home to Supper and I had the Impudence to eat two Eggs they were scarce down when he came in my Brother had sent for a Bottle of Wine and invited his Reverence to drink a Glass but  Mem  He says in one of his Letters that the Nobility scorned me and my vile Insinuations and Impudence  he scorned us and our vile Insinuations and as he always kept an exact Reckoning for his Poultry he very magisterially or∣dered his Eggs to be got ready this was a Thunderclap to me however as it was in vain to attempt to hide my Guilt I was forced to confess the horrid Fact upon which he stood aghast as though he had seen Churchyards yawn and Hell itself breathe forth Contagion to the World  What said he did you eat my black Hen's Egg Could not any other satisfy your dirty Guts I wish the Devil was in the Egg and that it had choaked you  I answered he had preferred his chari∣table Wish too late and lest it should take any Effect I drank a Glass of my Bro∣ther's Wine that I might digest all toge∣ther  Oh let the World judge how happy I was But to return  Though my  Park  Adventure had di∣verted the Execution of my sad Scheme for one Evening yet as it had brought me no Relief I still kept my Purpose and resolved to fulfil it the next To this End I came and sat in the same Place I made several Attempts to throw myself in and still when I came near the Water the Fear of something after Death puzzled the Will I examined my Heart strictly to know what gross Offence I had ever committed that it should  Please Heav'n to try me with Afflictions  To steep me in Poverty up to the very Lips  Give to Captivity me and my utmost Hopes  For had I ever refused my Morsel to the Hungry or ever filled the Widow's Eyes with Tears I should not wonder at it Quite lost in these melancholy Reflec∣tions I was waked as from a Dream by a very well dressed Gentleman who tapped me on the Shoulder and said Lord can this be Mrs  Pilkington  I looked at him earnestly and recollecting I had seen his Face before answered it was all the Re∣mains of her that was Mrs  Pilkington  May I presume Madam to ask on what Intention you are sitting her I fancy he perceived by my Looks the Disorder of my Soul which I believe was strongly pictured there I begged he would leave me to myselfBut he insisted on my going along with him to the  Royal Vineyard  which was not far offit was in vain to refuse him he would take no Denial When we were got about half way I very se∣riously demanded of him who he was He answered he was Capt  Hamilton  who had  once the Honour of seeing me at my Uncle  Van Lewen  's in  Cork  and who should think himself very happy if it was any way in his power to serve me We got a cold Fowl and some Ham of which I eat a little and took a Glass or two of  Cham∣paigne  and I found it revive me very much We then fell into Discourse and I very sincerely related to him my unhappy Situation and the Peril his Appearance had delivered me from My Story affected him so much that it drew Tears from him  After we had regaled ourselves it grow∣ing late we left the  Park  and he was so kind to see me to my Lodging where putting a couple of Guineas into my Hand we parted and he promised to see me next Morning but I saw him no more  I am sure when Mr  Pn  comes to this part of my Story he will wish the Gentleman had been buried sooner than he should do him so ill an Office as that of saving my Life but I among other things was born to let the World see what the Inside of a Priest is made of  Prompt or to stab or saint to save or damn  Heav'n's  Swiss  who fight for any God or Man  Pope  Take notice I always except the good and valuable part of the Clergy whom nobody more highly respects and honours than I sincerely do for when they possess like  Berkley  every Virtue under Heaven who can refuse it  I once more began to believe myself un∣der the Favour and Protection of the Al∣mighty as his Hand though to me in∣visible visibly led me through various Mazes perplexed with Error and deter∣mined whatever Sufferings he was pleased to inflict to bear them with Resignation and never permit them to triumph over a Christian Faith  And a severe and cruel Trial of my Constancy I quickly experienced there was a young Woman who lodged in the Gar∣ret whom I not only to the utmost of my Power supported as she was my Countrywoman  and in great Distress but also as she said she was related to the Lord  Powerscourt  her Maiden Name as she told me was  Craggs  his Lordship may better know whether this was true or false than I can presume to do however I had often made her a Confidante to my Distress which she as constantly revealed to my in∣exorable Landlady who one Day pre∣tending great Compassion told me what a Snake I harboured in my Bosom and said as she had learned from her that I had se∣veral valuable Things in Pawn she would release them and keep them in her own Hands till such time as I could pay her the Trifle I owed her I thought this a kind Offer and with great Acknowledg∣ment accepted of it Oh what a Fool was I to suspect such a  Jew  of any Remorse I gave her a Line to the Pawnbroker em∣powering her to receive whatever he had of mine and out of my two Guineas paid her one She laid out two Guineas took the Goods into her own Hands and e'er she came Home took out a Writ against me for the Money she had paid for them  This was on a  Friday  it rained exces∣cessively all Day to which I attributed both her staying and the extreme Low∣ness and Dejection of Spirit I laboured un∣der I called to Mrs  Craggs  to bear me Company but as she had told my Chri∣stian Name to my Landlady in order to have me properly arrested she did not think convenient to come to me  At length the old Beldam returned and in a merry way asked me Did not I think she had run away with my things I answered nothey were not worth her while She complained of being very dry upon which I was weak enough to treat her with some Porter  My Reader will please to observe I was at this time employed in writing a Tragedy called  The Roman Father  from the Story of  Virginius  and  Virginia  two Acts of which I had finished but as at the same time there were two bad Plays wrote on that Subject I did not think pro∣per to go on with it it was lying on my Window and after some Chat with the  old Woman being very much depressed in Spirit I went to Bed  Early next Morning to my no small Surprize entered a Couple of illfavoured Fellows the Sight of whom struck Terror to my Soul I demanded their Business one of them answered  "Get up you  Irish  Papist Bitch and come along with us"  The other who had employed himself in looking over my Papers cried  "Ay the  Irish  Whore here is something a∣bout some  Roman  Father that's the Pope and be damn'd to you is it"  I was for some time quite speechless but when I recovered Strength enough to speak I begged of them to leave the Room till I put on my Clothes but my Landlady coming in at that instant cried  "You're damn'd modestdon't quit the Place"  The Fellows who had more Decency than she looked out at the Window while I dressed myself in which Time my Agony was inconceivable they called a Coach and thrusting me into it conveyed me to the House of an Officer of Mace at  Cha∣ringcross  as I happened to have a Gui∣nea  in my Pocket I called for a Room and a Pint of Wine and then considered if I had one Friend I could apply to My dear Mr  Cibber  was out of Town as were likewise most of the Nobility however I saw young Mr  Cibber  go by the Window and sent to him but like all the World when he heard my Condition he would not come near me My whole Debt was Forty Shillings O what could I do but give my Tears Vent which was my only Relief and next Day after paying twenty Shillings I was conveyed to the  Marshalsea  Prison I sat withinside of the Lodge for some Minutes quite stupified till at length a Man came and asked me if I was a Prisoner which it seems he did not be∣fore know I told him I was upon which he brought me into a Room where a Par∣cel of Wretches seized me and sung a long Song about Garnish and were going to pull my Clothes off till a Servant who had seen me before said  "For God's sake don't use Dr  Meade  's Wife ill"  Upon this a most ugly Woman came up and said  "Gd dn you you Bh do you  pretend to be Dr  Meade  's WifeI am his Wife"  I begged to be heard which was granted I told her my Name was  Meade  and my Husband a Clergy∣man in  Ireland  "Oh that's a different Case said she going off"  They were kind enough to take my Word for some Drink and a good decent Woman said she would accept of me for a Chum as they call it She brought me into a little dirty Apartment where without examin∣ing any thing I in Despair threw myself down on a Bed I saw there and resolved never to rise again Three Days and Nights past during which Time I never tasted Food of any sort At length the Companion of my Misery pressed me to take a little Refreshment which I was per∣suaded do and seeing so many People in my own Condition at length reconciled me to think of making myself as easy as possible and leave myself to the Disposi∣tion of Divine Providence One Morning a Friend came to visit me by whom I sent a Letter to Dr  Mde  telling him my Distress and among other Things these Lines  CAN alas the plaintive Pray'r  Dictated by Grief sincere  Hope to reach a friendly Ear  Will thy kind and bounteous Heart  Sympathize while I impart  Such Affliction as before  Never hapless Woman bore  I made no doubt but I should be re∣lieved and waited impatiently for the An∣swer which was as follows  To Mrs  MEADE  in the  Marshalsea  Ormondstreet  October  MADAM  I Have so many Applications for Cha∣rity that it is impossible for me to re∣lieve all those from your Country alone are very numerous The Family of the  Meades  there are very rich and should take care of their needy Branches I have for the last Time sent you a Guinea  I am Your humble Servant  R M  I kept the Original of this by me with a Resolution when I should these unlucky Deeds relate not to omit it This was soon gone I had many to satisfy I then wrote to  Henry Furnese  Esq  who in a polite manner sent me a Guinea which doubled the Obligation  For oh believe me 'tis a dreadful Task  To generous Minds to be compell'd to ask  More dreadful still to have a Suit deny'd  Or take a niggard Alms giv'n with Con∣tempt and Pride  I was by this supported till my dear Mr  Cibber  came to Town who was no sooner acquainted with my Misfortune than he sent me a Guinea all changed into Sixpences lest it should tempt some one to pick my Pocket this was an Instance of singular Humanity but he has often said when he did good to People in Distress it was only to ease his own Mind which would other∣wise have been on the Rack Oh Heavens what innate Goodness must dwell in that Breast  Seeing the Woman that accused me for being the Doctor's Wife lying dead drunk in the Puddle I asked my Companion who she was Madam I'll tell you said she She was a Servant to Dr  Mde  who had a Child by her and supported her in his House for some time at length they parted and he was to allow her five Guineas a Week But the Doctor marry∣ing his present Lady began to be remiss in his Payments which enraged Madam to such a Degree that forgetting Decency she went to his House and in Presence of all his Servants abused and exposed him to the utmost of her power  Upon this the Doctor stepped into his Chariot and ordered it to drive to her Lodging where finding she was indebted to her Landlord one Mr  Bradstt  famous for being a Spy for the D of  C  he desired him to arrest and put her in Jail This artful Fellow al∣ledged it would be very expensive but the Doctor having Charitymoney enough to supply such Exigencies said he valued not the Expence so she was secured Upon  this the poor Wretch was arrested and thrown into Jail and from time to time  Bradstt  got three hundred Pounds of the Doctor for keeping her there till at length the Doctor growing weary of the Expence consented to her Releasement but she had so entirely devoted herself to drinking that she died a few Days after she obtained her Liberty  And so let this be booked among other of his good Works such as combing the Ladies Heads  c c  I think it is a great Pity that every cha∣ritably disposed Person is not his own Al∣moner since it is a thousand to one whe∣ther that which was intended to help the Distrest and Innocent is not applied to the Service of LUXURY and VICE I am sure to my own Knowledge in several Instances it has been so by the Dctr who has many Affairs of the same Nature on his Hands and to quote his favourite Mr  Pope  Now in such Exigencies not to need  Upon my Word you must be rich indeed  A noble Superfluity it craves  Not for yourself but for your Whores and Knaves  I remember twenty Years ago to have heard Dr  Delany  say from the Pulpit it was a glorious thing for a Man to be his own EXECUTOR I dare say he never preached but what he practised and ex∣cept that eternal Treasure which he has wisely laid up in store where neither Moth nor Rust can corrupt nor Thieves break thro' and steal Whenever he comes to pay his Mortal Debtwhich Hour be far awayall he will have left on this side of a blessed and glorious Immortality will be a Shower of Orphans and of Wi∣dows Tears to bedew the consecrated Earth where his honoured Remains shall rest in Peace till summoned to partake of that Bliss prepared by the Almighty be∣fore all Worlds for Souls like his  As I have frequently observed to my Readers that I was glad to run away from such a disagreeable Theme as my Misfor∣tunes I hope for their Pardon though I  am obliged to return to them again and give them an Account even of so dismal a Place as a Jail  Our HeadTurnkey happened to have been a Servant to Alderman  Barber  and like  Joseph  I found Favour in the Sight of my Keeper as he had seen me in better Days  For  Certes  I had look'd on better Days  And had with holy Bell been knoll'd to Church  And sat at good Men's Feasts and wip'd the Eye  Of Drops which sacred Pity had en∣gender'd  This Man took great Compassion on me and as on every  Friday  which is Courtday the Prisoners are all locked up in their re∣spective Apartments lest when the Gates are thrown open for the Admission of the Judge and Lawyers any of them should make their Escape I was always indul∣ged in the Liberty of hearing the Trials which as a Court of Judicature was a  Scene I had never before beheld greatly amused me  And indeed I quickly perceived Sir  Richard Steele  was not mistaken when he said the first second and third Excellence of a Lawyer was Tautology  Yet this was but a transitory Relaxation once in a Week the Horror of my Con∣dition returned with double Violence the Moment I heard the Key turn for my Con∣finement  If Mr  Pn  should alledge that I have been severe on him in my Writings let him but consider the Extremity that he drove a worthy Gentleman's Daughter to nurtured in Ease and Plenty and if he does not acquit me I am sure the rest of the World will  We had a sort of a Chappel belonging to the Jail where Dr  Friend  a Clergy∣man Brother to Dr  Friend  the Physician obliged us with Divine Service every  Sun∣day  This Gentleman was himself a Pri∣soner in the  King'sBench  and after all the Grandeur he had once lived in was now so low reduced as even to be beholden  to such an unfortunate Creature as I for Sixpence which unfortunate as I was I could not refuse to so fine an Orator a G  ntleman and by all Accounts only undone by boundless Generosity and Hos∣pital  ty  The first Day I heard him preach I was charmed with his Elocution but the rest of the Congregation mad and drunk bade him hold his Tonguehe indeed like  Orpheus  played to Wolves and Bears nor were they half so obliging to him as the Storms were to  Arion  neither could he though uttering dulcet and harmonious Sounds make the rude Crowd grow civil with his Song  This fine Gentleman I often invited to my lonely Mansionhe was not a lit∣tle surprised to hear my mournful Storyand indeed it somewhat alleviated my Sorrow to find such a CompanionPoor Gentleman Death has released him I am sure I should have done it had the Almighty given me a Power equal to my Inclination to serve him  However I may praise God that I was under him the happy Instrument of Good to Numbers of my wretched Fellowcrea∣tures since by one pathetic Memorial I wrote for them the sorrowful Sighing of the Prisoners reached the Hearts of the Le∣gislative Powers and obtained an Act of Grace for them  But as it was now near  Christmas  and the Act was not to take Place till the  June  following I used my utmost Endeavours to procure my own Liberty for oh what anxious Moments must have passed between that dreadful Interval of Time On a se∣cond Application to Mr  Cibber  he used all his Power with the Great for me and as he had been used to move their Passions did it effectually on my Behalf insomuch than no less than sixteen Dukes contributed a Guinea apiece towards my Enlargement  When I read over these Words  Discharge from your Custody the Body of  c as I was by nine Weeks Confinement Sickness and Fasting rendered quite weak the joy∣ful Surprise made me faint away several Times and indeed my kind Benefactor  had like to have frustrated his own gene∣rous Design of preserving me  However after all Debts Extortions and Dues were paid I had just thirteen Shillings left with which Sum I was once more permitted to breathe the open Airand go where I pleased  As soon as I got as far as  LondonBridge  I found my Head turn quite giddy and my Legs fail me insomuch that I went into a Jeweller's Shop who perceiving my weak Condition permitted me to sit down in it I begged of him to let some of his Servants call a Coach for me which he civilly complied with when I was got into it I was at a Loss where to bid the Coachman drive me till at last recollecting that all my Writings All the little all which might make my fu∣ture Fortune were in the Possession of Mrs  Trifoli  the Woman who had cast me into Misery unspeakable which not to teize my Readers I have slightly passed over for what Entertainment can it possibly give to the curious learned or polite Reader to hear from me what every  Person who has ever been in a Jail can relate as well as I  Well I was carried to her House where as I told her I did not know where to lodge that Night she kindly accepted of me for a Bedfellow but a very bad one I found for she as my Spirits were quite fatigued no sooner found I was fast asleep but she picked my Pocket  When I awoke in the Morning she asked me to give her some Tea on which taking up my Pocket to give her Money to go for it I found I had none when I complained of this Usage she told me she was too charitable to permit me to sleep with her and now this was her Reward so she insisted on my turning out of her Doors and truly I knew not where to  Inform my unacquainted Feet  Thro' the blind Mazes of a tangled World  So I went dirty as I came out of Jail to Mr  Cibber  for I ought before to have observed that this Wretch not only secured my Person but my Clothes also insomuch that I had not a Shift to change me till  out of what Charity was sent me I bought a second one in the Jail  However he received me with as much Regard and Kindness as though I had been ever so well drest but he charged me not to give him Thanks for any Thing he had done to serve me but to praise God who as he said had given me Me∣rit  "For Child said he were you stupid insensible or wicked I should never have had the smallest Compassion for you"  He asked me what I now intended to do I assured him I did not know for that I neither had a Lodging nor what was yet worse a Shilling to get one  "Well said he I have a little Money in Store for you I told your melancholy Story to the Duke of  Richmond  and he gave me Five Guineas for you there they are"  This was a Lottery Prize to one in my unhappy Situation I could not though prohibited forbear the warmest Expres∣sions of Gratitude both to his Grace and Mr  Cibber  to the Duke I wrote a Letter  of Acknowledgment and provided myself with a Lodging in  Westminster  and as it was on  Christmas  Eve I obtained my Li∣berty on  NewYear  's Day I published in the  Gazette  the following Lines  To  COLLEY CIBBER  Esq  LOST in a Prison's joyless Gloom  Chearless and dreary as the Tomb  Where on the Bed of Care I lay  And wept the lonely Hours away  When ev'ry Hope and Wish was fled  But to be number'd with the Dead  You like a Messenger of Grace  Spoke my despairing Soul to Peace  Wip'd off the Tear from Sorrow's Eye  Bid Bars and Bolts strong warded fly  Bounty the AngelMen revere  Wrought Miracles of Mercy there  Say shall those Deeds forgotten die  Or lost in cold Oblivion lie  May Heav'n no longer guard that Breath  You rescu'd from untimely Death  Than Gratitude attunes my Lays  In sweetest Notes to hymn your Praise  Nor can the Song offend the Ear  Thus offer'd from a Soul sincere  Enlarg'd once more with Joy I view  The circling Sun his Course renew  May He whose Wisdom guides the Spheres  Proportion Blessings to thy Years  To Thee may rosybosom'd Spring  Pleasure and Health and Plenty bring  Till Time with gentle Steps convey  Thy Soul to Realms of endless Day  Where Cherubims for Thee with Care  Unenvy'd deathless Wreaths prepare  Those modest Virtues You conceal  Shall Heav'nborn Charity reveal  And mortal Goodness to improve  Unite You can immortal Love  Oh let your Gaiety excuse  My serious melancholy Muse  This World appears a Dream to me  Afflictions teach Philosophy  And thus alone a Christian Heart  It's grateful Raptures can impart  My dear old Friend was pleased with my Sense of his Goodness to me only he told  me my Lines were more proper to be ad∣dressed to an Archbishop than to him who had nothing to boast of more than a little common Humanity  Well being now freeand with five Guineas in my Pocket in flowing Circum∣stances I began to consider in what Man∣ner I should improve them so I wrote to his Grace of  Mh  who like Lord  Kingsborough  knows not how to give one Guinea by way of Relief he immediately sent me Ten sealed up in a very genteel Letter with his best Wishes and Compli∣ments to me who was now so rich as I  But as  Shakespear  observes  There is a Tide in the Affairs of Men  Which taken at the Height is prospe∣rous  But slighted the Residue of their Lives  Is bound in Shallows and in Miscry  So I just then heard a Clergyman was in  England  who was a near and intimate Friend of my Father's him I addressed and was ordered to go to Mr  Richardson  a Printer in  Salisburycourt  for an An∣swer to my Letter  As I had never formed any great Idea of a  Mem  Not our present Set of Printers who are many of them Gentlemen and Persons in good Cir∣cumstances prrticularly my own  Printer by those I had seen in  Ireland  I was very negligent of my Dress any more than making myself clean but was extremely surprised when I was directed to a House of a very grand outward Ap∣pearance and had it been a Palace the beneficent Master deserved it  I met a very civil Reception from him and he not only made me break∣fast but also dine with him and his agree∣able Wife and Children After Dinner he called me into his Study and shewed me an Order he had received to pay me twelve Guineas which he immediately took out of his Escrutore and put it into my Hand but when I went to tell them over I found I had fourteen and suppo∣sing the Gentleman had made a Mistake I was for returning two of them but he  with a Sweetness and Modesty almost pe∣culiar to himself said he hoped I would not take it ill that he had presumed to add a Trifle to the Bounty of my Friend  I really was confounded till recollecting that I had read  Pamela  and been told it was written by one Mr  Richardson  I asked him whether he was not the Au∣thor of it He said he was the Editor I told him my Surprize was now over as I found he had only given to the incompa∣rable  Pamela  the Virtues of his own worthy Heart  When he reads these Lines as read them I am certain he will even for the Writer's sake let him reflect that at least his Bread was not scattered on the Water but that though I have no other Way of shewing my Gratitude for his boundless and repeated Acts of Humanity to me and my Children but Words mere Words yet if every Word of mine could charm down Blessings on him  Then never shou'd Misfortune cross his Foot  But Peace shou'd be within his Walls and Plenty  Health and Happiness his constant At∣tendants  And now that I might if possible avoid the Misery of extreme Want I re∣solved to turn my Stock into Trade and after long Consideration thought nothing would suit my Inclination so well as a PamphletShop nor no Place was so pro∣per for my Purpose as  St James  's  Street  where I should be in the Center of my noble Benefactors to this end I walked through it and finding one to be let which answered my Purpose I directly agreed to give the Landlord twentyone Pounds a Year for a Shop Parlour and Kitchen but the Landlord insisted upon my paying a Quarter's Rent beforehand which though a little hard upon me as I not only had the Shop to stock but Fur∣niture of all Kinds to buy I complied with  So Reader here was a new Scene and I for the first of my Family took my Place behind a Counter  Having met with a very great Bargain of Prints which were sold under Distress and having some Knowledge in that Way I resolved also to deal in them so having decorated out my Windows with them to the best Advantage early on  Monday  Morning I entered on my new Employ  The first Person who entered was Lord  Pstn  dress'd  à la mode de Paris  with long sloped double Ruffles such as the La∣dies wear he took down the Print of  Shakespear  's Monument and though it was marked Price Eighteenpence he bade me a Groat for it which as it had cost me a Shilling I could by no means take so he went away very much displeased and truly I began to be out of Conceit with my Occupation  As my dear Mr  Cibber  had made me a present of fifty of his last Answer to Mr  Pope  I sat down to read it and found it so full of Spirit and Humour that just as it had thrown me into a hearty Fit of  Laughter a Clergyman entered who asked me what I had got new I told him  my present Situation  He looked earnestly on me and said he was very sure of that  "But Madam said he all are not born to be happy in this World however they may merit it which plainly demon∣strates a future State where Rewards and Punishments will be impartially dis∣tributed but why should I tell this to Mrs  Pilkington  who may better in∣struct her Teacher"  I begged of the Gentleman to inform me where I had had the Honour of seeing him He told me he was Son to Colonel  Stuart  who lived next Door to my Father before I was married and when he himself was in the College I then recollected that he used every Day to send me some poetical Praise and as I never before had an Op∣portunity of thanking him for his elegant Compliments I took it now  As he was desirous of giving me Hansel as they call it I recommended Mr  Cibber  's Letter to him as a Cure for the Spleen a Distemper most studious and learned Per∣sons  are apt to fall into he took the Ghost's Word for the Excellence of the Performance and gave me a Guinea I was going to give him Change but he would not accept of it so promising to be a constant Customer for whatever I sold and wishing me all Success he de∣parted  Mem  The Clergyman infinitely more generous than the Peer  As my Obligations to Mr  Cibber  were ever present to my Mind I wrote to him the following kind of Paraphrase on an Ode of  Horace  To Mr  CIBBER  Donarem pateras  Hor  DID Fortune wait upon my Hand  Cou'd I her various Gifts command  Her noblest Offering wou'd I give  To Him whose Bounty bade me live  A golden Goblet richly chas'd  Close by a mantling Vine embrac'd  Whose Fruitage round the Brim should shine  And seem to yield the sparkling Wine  Or radiant Gems of Value rare  Shou'd speak my Gratitude sincere  For thy far nobler Gift to me  Inestimable LIBERTY  Tho' Poets boast a fair Estate  They seldom deal in Gems or Plate  For yet in all  Parnassus  Mold  There ne'er appear'd one Vein of Gold  We toil and labour all our Days  For a few Sprigs of barren Bays  They Thunderproof its Rage defy  Yet touch'd by Envy blasted die  Yet Verse can consecrate a Name  And worthy Deeds consign to Fame  Oh cou'd I raise a Song sublime  Triumphant over Fate and Time  Thy Virtue in the Lays divine  Should with immortal Lustre shine  Let others place phantastic Joys  In orient Trinkets splendid Toys  While your exalted Soul refin'd  Like Heav'n accepts the GRATEFUL MIND  I sent these Lines to my dear Gentleman who presently came to me as I was once more in his Neighbourhoodand in his chearful way said  "Faith Child you have praised me so that I think it is the least I can do to make you eat for a Fortnight"  so he gave me three Guineas  As my Mind was now a little at Peace I began to think of my dear Children whom nothing but my Incapacity of doing them Service and a Supposition that their Father took proper Care of them could ever divert my Thoughts from even a Moment so strong is maternal Love at least if every Mother loves like me For really and I hope it is a pardonable Frail∣ty my very Life is treasured in him whom I may properly stile my only Child and were he to die I should not long sur∣vive him  I know not of what impenetrable Stuff his Father's Heart was made of that could let such a Son not only want the Advan∣tages of Education which had it not been  in his Power to pay for it it was in his own Power to bestow on him so far as instructing him in the Knowledge of  Latin  and  Greek  which  Cato  would not permit his Son to be indebted to a Slave forand yet  Cato  was at least as good and a much greater Man than the Parson surely this he might have doneNo on the contrary he chose to expose him at Nine Years of Age to every Calamity in Life and that he did not turn Thief or Pickpocket was due to God's restraining Grace and providential Care of him  And here I must in Vindication of my Child declare he never was undutiful or disrespectful to me as his Father has falsly and cruelly reported he is like all Per∣sons of his Age so full of Mirth and over∣flowing Spirits that I am certain the Dulness his Father brings as an Excuse for taking him from School never was his Fault  For he is  All my Mirth my Exercise my Matter  He makes my  July  's Days short as  De∣cember  And with his varying Playfulness kills in me  Thoughts which would thick my Blood  Though I am sure only that he has too much Respect for his Father to throw any Reflection on him yet he might properly say  He let me feed with his Hinds debar'd me of a Place in his Love and as much as was in him mined my Gentility by base Education  And I may say with Truth the Boy is gentle though  Never school'd learn'd full of noble Device  And of all Sorts enchantingly belov'd  Shakespear As you like it  But to return I wrote to  Ireland  to my eldest Son who either through Fear of his Father's Anger or an illnatur'd Spirit derived from him did not think me worth an Answer however he shewed the Letter to his Sister who in her low Stile sent me an affectionate Letter Before it reached me I heard Mr  Are  was come to  London  and having been told my Child was bound Apprentice to him I did not doubt but I should find him with him so I went to wait on him he received me very politely and told me my Son had left him and was gone to  Scotland  When I demanded how they came to part He said he had pawned some of his Music Books and that he had complained to his Father of him who asked what they might be worth It is to be presumed that they were valued to the utmost they cost upon which Mr  Pn  ever tender said he was glad to hear that the Theft as he termed it amounted to Death intreating Mr  Are  to prosecute the Child for such he then was and declaring that no∣thing in the World would give him greater Satis∣faction  than to hear that the Dog was hang'd  Mr  Are  said Mr  Pn  's In∣humanity quite shocked himso he corrected the Boy very severely upon which he ran away from him that he had since received a Letter from him which he shewed to me and from thence I got a Direction where to write to him I was as may be supposed infinitely disturbed at this Account of my Son I wrote to him that very Night and informed him of what Mr  Ae  had said I begged of him to come to me and that as his Master had highly commended his musical Talents I hoped by Mr  Cibber  's Interest to get him engaged at one of the Theatres  About ten Days after having just paid my Rent and bought some ShopGoods on which I had laid out every Penny I was worthas I had stuck up on my Shop Window  Letters written here on any Subject except the Law Price Twelvepence Petitions also drawn at the same Rate  Mem  Ready Money no Trust  A Man came in very badly drest with a greasy Leather Apron before him he looked over some Prints when the Post∣man brought me a large Pacquet marked  Edinburgh  as I had no Money I was in terrible Confusion especially as the Fellow cried  "Come Mistress don't keep me waiting"  I said I must send out for Change Oh said he I never go without it where's your Piece Upon this the Leatherapron'd Gentleman for such he was drew out a Handful of Gold and throwing down a Guinea said  "There take your Money"  and what was yet more surprizing he insisted on my taking the Change for he determined he said to have me his Debtor  Upon this I began to have a very different Opinion of my new Customer than what his first Appearance gave me and therefore civilly entreated his Permission to peruse my Letter to which he agreeing I had not read above ten Lines when I burst into Tears so the Gentleman insisted on my laying it aside while he stayed telling me  I must so far oblige him as to write a LoveLetter for him  Upon this I invited him into the Parlour and told him he must make me his Confi∣dant He said he had never mentioned Love to the Lady that as to her Person she was very agreeable but that her Mind far surpassed it So having my Instruc∣tions I quickly finished my Task greatly to his Satisfaction insomuch that he pro∣tested I must give him Leave to send for a Flask of  Champaigne  to raise my Spirits which indeed were greatly oppressed  By the time he had drank a Glass or two he began to talk of  Homer Horace Milton  and all the Poets sung an  Italian  Song and soon convinced me that Dress was put on merely to disguise a fine Gen∣tleman which it was no way in his Power to do I told him so and asked him why he walked in Masquerade  He smiled at my Question but assured me he was neither better or worse than a HousePainter and that his Name was  Tom Brush  This put me in Mind of an Adventure I once had in  Ireland  when one of the finest Gentlemen in it came to visit me in a Grazier's Coat and told me his Name was  Tom Long  the Carrier though he hap∣pened to be an  English  Baronet with a large Estate and a great Employment  But I have been a Lady of Adventure and almost every Day of my Life produces some new one I am sure I ought to thank my loving Husband for the Opportunity he has afforded me of seeing the World from the Palace to the Prison for had he but permitted me to be what Nature cer∣tainly intended me for a harmless hous∣hold Dove in all human Probability I should have rested contented with my humble Situation and instead of using a Pen been employed with a Needle to work for the little ones we might by this time have had  Now after all my strange Vicissitudes of good and evil Fortune I sincerely de∣clare that were I to have my Wish tho' I should not now in the Decline of Life be able to struggle through Misfortunes as in  it's first sprightly Career yet as by the Bounty Compassion and Kindness of all my noble and honoured Benefactors I have the unspeakable Happiness of being set above the low Distresses of Life  Now pleas'd Remembrance builds Delight on Woe  Pope's Homer  I think I am glad that there has been such strong Proof made of my Constancy without which I had scarce known how duly to praise that eternal Goodness who evermore gave me Strength adequate to the severe Afflictions he was pleased to try me with Be then all Praise to him who  From seeming Evil still educes good  And better still from thence and better still  To infinite Perfection  Well when Mr  Brush  departed I read my dear Child's Letter which was as fol∣lows  Edinburgh  Sept  My dear dear MOTHER  NO Tongue can express the Joy which the Receipt of your kind Letter in∣spired me with to find a long lost Trea∣sure for I was so positively assured you were dead that I can hardly believe my Eyes when I see your dear and well∣known Hand and read your beloved Name which I have kissed a thousand Times If it be Delusion may I never be undeceived  You desire me to give you a particular Account of whatever has befallen me since I had the Misfortune of loosing you my dearest and only Friend for I with all Duty and Gratitude remember your fond Affection to me It is to you I am indebted that I can either read or write or know any part of my Duty either to God or Man for I do assure you my Father neither in∣structed me himself nor tho' Mr  Baldrick  whom my Grandfather put me to School to when the good old Man was dead would have taught for me nothing would  he permit me to go School because one Day a Boy threw a Stone at me and I throwing another at him happened to break a Pane of Glass in an Alehouse Window for which the People followed me home and made my Father pay a Groat for it  Upon this I received a most inhuman Correction from him which was repeated every Morning and Night for six Days to∣gether he stripped off all my Clothes though in the Depth of Winter and locked them up leaving me without any Covering but my Shirt in the dark Back Kitchen which as you may remember was in the Winter overflowed with Water charging the Servants not to give me a Morsel of Food and that I am alive is due to God's Providence who I hope preserved me to be a Comfort to you  However the Servants though they had but a Groat a Day allowed them to live upon used to give me Share of their Bread and ButterMilk and when my Father was abroad would permit me to warm my Body at the Kitchen Fire nay and as my Father said it was too much Indulgence  for me to sleep with his Footman the poor Fellow used to let me lie down in the Day where I spent most of my Time and was neither allowed Pen Ink or Book to a∣muse me  I will in some time give you a full His∣tory but at present shall confine my∣self to Mr  Ae  's Affair I lived with him some time before I was bound Ap∣prentice in which I was used very well but as soon as that was done the Scene was changed Mrs  Ae  who was prodi∣giously fond of Gin used to take so much of it that she seldom knew what she did and would often persuade her Husband to believe well or ill of me just as she was drunk or sober It was in one of these Fits she was when  Tommy Le  landed who is really a worthless conceited Fellow and because he thought I did not sufficiently admire his fine singing used by way of Fun to set Mrs  Ae  on to abuse me and Mr  Ae  who is really a goodnatured Man I was discharged from fetching Halfquarterns to my Mistress and there being an old Box in the Garret in which  Mr  Ae  kept some MusickBooks she went up to examine it and said there were some of them stole He who did not know what number of Books there was in it said there was none gone upon which without the least Ceremony she struck him in the Face swearing by the great God if he did not correct me she would do it herself I who was not far off and heard this Discourse made the best of my way out of the House which Mrs  Ae  taking as a Proof of Guilt and a villai∣nous Maid she had joining with her she searched the House and swore she had lost many things as Brass Candlesticks Bottles  c  all this poor Mr  Ae  was obliged to agree to for Quietness sake When I had staid a Day away I wrote to him telling him I was surprized at his Suspi∣cions of me and that I was willing to re∣turn He came directly with the Messen∣ger and brought me home I stayed there till Night when Mr  Le  com∣ing in and hearing I was there called for his Horsewhip and Mr  Ae  his Wife and  Le  were beating me for three  Hours to make me confess what I had done with the Books swearing they would cut me to Death if I did not own I was forced one time to say that I sold them another that I gave them away to get a little Respite so when they had made me confess to what they pleased I was put to Bed and locked in in order to be sent to  Newgate  next Day  I stayed all Night never slept and all the next Day did not eat a Morsel In the Evening they were rehearsing  Comus  when I shot back the Lock of my Prison and finding the other Door open I took off my Shoes and crept down stairs got to the Street and run five Streets Length in my Stockings What Advantage the Maid might make of finding the Door open and me gone I know not as Mrs  Ae  said she had lost some of her Jewels Things the poor Woman never had in her Life and so far I was from a Thought of taking any thing of theirs that I did not take my Hat a Shirt or any thing else with me Now all the Reason I can ever devise for her using me so was I believe  because I once saw her and  Le  toying on the Bed together So now my Dear Mother as I fear I have taken up too much of your Time already I shall conclude with assuring you  I am With the greatest Tenderness Respect and Duty Your affectionate Son J PILKINGTON  This Account of my poor Child's Suf∣ferings threw me into what they call  An Histerick Cholick  under which I languished many Days but my Hour was not yet come nor had my Sorrows reached their Summit But of that in due place  But to return to my Seat behind the Counter where I was tolerably content with my Situation except for the Concern I felt for my Children from whom I could seldom disengage my Thoughts although the sad Remembrance grieves my  Soul I must proceed I went to indulge a pleasing Fit of Melancholy into  Westmin∣sterAbbey  Where breathing Paint and speaking Marbles shew  What Worthies form the hallow'd Mold below  I wandered through the Cloysters reading the Inscriptions till it grew duskish I hastened to the great Gate but was infi∣nitely shocked to find I was locked into the solitary Mansions of the Dead I called a∣loud to no purpose except to fright myself with my own Voice reverborated through  Long sounding Isles and intermingled Graves  'Tis scarce in the power of Imagination to paint the Horror which possessed me es∣pecially as by the Glimpses of the Moon the Statues which had before been Subjects of Amusement to me now looked dread∣ful when each Molehill Ant swelled to a huge  Olympus  I knew not what to do  but if possible take Sanctuary at the Altar  I went up to the Iron Wicket which opens into that part of the Abbey where Divine Service is performed and to my unspeakable Happiness pulled it open I thought to sit down in one of the Pews till Morning till recollecting the Church was full of Rats my Terrors were again re∣newed and I had Inclination to go into the Isles yet how strong a Passion is Fear the very Look of them terrified me till at length gathering Courage even from De∣spair I went to the Communion Table took off from thence a Carpet which co∣vered it and thinking I could no where be so secure from those Vermin as in the Pulpit I with great Difficulty dragged it up where finding also a Velvet Cushion I seated myself and laid the Cushion un∣der my Head wrapping even my Face up with the Carpet  I endeavoured all in my Power by the Force of Reason and Religion to conquer the Terrors which seized me I reflected that God was every where and able to  defend me that he was not slow to hear nor impotent to save and also that the Church was peculiarly under his Care as consecrated to Acts of Holiness and both relying on his Providence and commit∣ting to his Protection I found my Mind as tranquil and composed as if I had been at home in my Bed and fell into a deep Sleep And here tho' I may be thought whimsical or superstitious for it I cannot avoid relating my Dream produced no doubt by the same Set of Ideas which had possessed my waking Thoughts and still held their place in Sleep  I imagined myself to be exactly where I was and that suddenly the Graves gave up their mighty dead who walked in mar∣tial Array before me I thought by some secret intuitive Knowledge I became ac∣quainted not only with their Names but also with their Aspects Many crowned Heads and sceptered Hands stalked by me in venerable Majesty  Henry  V clad in Armour drew in a particular manner my Attention insomuch that I could not for∣bear blessing him I thought he smiled  and with a placid Air returned my Salu∣tation and said  "I should have been Great if when I had conquered  France  I had not married the perfidious Daugh∣ter of it who at the Age of Thirtyfour poisoned me This Crime of hers has been truly visited on all our unhappy Race who are now quite extinct"  I said Thanks Gracious Monarch He disappeared and two Persons struggling for a Diadem next approached Death Desolation and Ruin were spread around them till at length a surlylooking Fel∣low destroyed them both and all their Friends  I mourned at this sad Scene when lo a Hero appeared who held in one Hand red Roses and white so blended that they looked lovely to the Eye he seemed once or twice to smell to them when instantly the Flowers faded and died while in their Place appeared a large Bag of Money  Next came a squat squarefaced King who held in his righthand four bloody Heads one of whom I thought I knew to  be that of  Anna Bullen  and the other that of the Marquis of  Surrey  A sweetly blooming Youth whose Por∣trait was just at my Back in the Pulpit ap∣peared and vanished like my Dream out of which I startled by the Chimes finding the Bell tolled Four and knowing the early Service did not begin till Six I once more endeavoured to compose myself to Rest  I must reassume my Dream just where it broke off as it really occurred to me A lovely Lady made her Entrance holding  Plato  in one Hand and the Bible in the other two Men by Force put a Crown on her Head at which she seemed ter∣rified when immediately came a Woman with a Countenance like  Maegara  attended by a Train of Fellows with Cords Axes and Hatchets Wheels and other Imple∣ments of Death and Torture waited on again by Persons who by their holy Vestments I hoped would be at least hu∣mane but alas instead of comforting the lovely Lady they forced the abovesaid Fury who seemed for once inclined to pity  her to permit those savage and inhuman Butchers to cut off the loveliest the most learned Head that ever from the prime Creation adorned a Woman  But to the unspeakable Happiness of  GreatBritain  this detestable Wretch told me as I thought that  Philip  of  Spain  poi∣soned her in Hopes of marrying her Sister  Elizabeth  then a Prisoner in the Tower  I was tired with these shadowy crowned Heads passing by me like those in  Macbeth  and wished to see the sweetly inspired Lau∣relwreathed Poets advance my Wish was immediately gratified and a merry old Fellow appeared who was as it were in Jest lashing a whole Swarm of Friars  Piec'd patch'd and pyebal'd linseywoolsey Brothers  Bareheaded sleeveless some and shirtless others  Pope  And though the Blows were dealt pretty smart they affected to smile at them  Next appeared a Queen to whom a Gentleman with a sweet but melancholy Countenance humbly presented a Volume of inimitable Poetry as he was the Prince of Poets in his Time His  Gloriana  re∣ceived it graciously and putting her Hand in her Pocket gave him a large Bag I sup∣posed it had been filled with Gold but the Poet opening it found nothing in it but Grains su  h as they feed the Hogs with of which he put a large Handful into his Mouth and instantly dropped down  The Concern I felt for him awaked me the Bell tolling for Morning Prayer and the Sexton missing the Carpet and suppo∣sing the Church had been robbed was al∣most beside himself till I called to him and bade him not be frighted there was nothing gone the Man stared at me I begged him to come and help me down for I found myself so weak I could scarce move  I then told him by what odd Accident I came there He seemed amazed that I out∣lived it and swore heartily he would not have been in my Place for all the World  I begged of him to get somebody to call me a Chair he went himself for one and with great Goodnature brought from his own House a small Phial with some Cherrybrandy in it and a Teacup in his Pocket I am sure I wanted a Cordial and there∣fore took a little of it though not with∣out obliging him to accept of Payment for it  When I returned Home my Servant who had sat up for me all Night was amazed to see me so pale and dirty for the old Carpet had sufficiently soiled my Apparel but lest she should conceive a bad Opinion of me I told her where I had been and went to Bed I slept for two Hours and awoke extremely ill notwith∣standing which I cleaned myself and went into my Shop  A young Gentleman but very gravely drest was my first Customer he asked me the Price of an old Print in the Window and seemed surprized at my asking Half a Crown for it assuring me it was not worth a Groat I said I was sure he was too good a Judge not to know the Value of  any Print taken out of  Montfaucon  's An∣tiquities He said he wondered why since I knew the Value of the Author I should be so tasteless as to cut one of them out of the Work which in many Places served to illustrate it particularly in the Medals I assured him I had not done it but had bought them amongst a Number of others The Gentleman perceiving I spoke very faintly said he believed I was not well I assured him I was so ill it was with in∣finite Difficulty I spoke at all he demanded of me who was my Physician I said I had none since my dear Father died who was one of the Faculty Then Madam said he allow me to have that Honour so feeling my Pulse he ordered me to be bled which greatly relieved my poor Head which with the Agitation of Spirit I had suffered over Night aked ready to split As this Gentleman gave me his Attendance as long as I had the least Complaint I should I think be highly ungrateful not to acknowledge my Obligation to Dr  Lawson  And indeed I must here say I never met with more learned more generous or more humane Gentlemen than Physicians yet as no general Rule is without an Excep∣tion Dr  Wlkr  refused me a Sub∣scription altho' every other Physician had on my dear Father's Account relieved his unhappy Family but he alledged it would disoblige Mr  Pn  I know not but it might yet how he came to fear him more than the rest of the World did that I know not but any Excuse will serve a Man to save five Shillings perhaps he could not spare them as it is more than probable were he see'd according to his Skill he might not be worth a single  Marvedi  and for many Reasons he ought not to be severe on any Woman's Cha∣racter let him amend the Females of his own Family first a Task I fear he will never be able to perform  I might also give the same Advice to Dr  Ons  whose two Sisters took a solitary Walk over  EssexBridge  every Evening perhaps to say their Prayers  But to return to  Albion  I had one Even∣ing been invited abroad and at my Return my Servant told me there had been two very fine Gentlemen to visit me who would not leave their Names but said they would come the next Morning Accord∣ingly they did one of whom I knew to be Lieutenant  Southwel  since dead and the other the Ld Vt  Dle  Mr  Southwel  who had been many Years acquainted with me seemed rejoiced to see me but my Lord looked on me with the utmost Contempt nay with such an Air as I had never before met with from any Gentleman and cried  "Prithee come away I thought you were to take me to a Girl of Sixteen"  though  mem  he was at that time married to his present Lady who is by all Accounts a very great Beauty I assured his Lordship I had been once Sixteen but as it happened six∣teen Years had rolled over since that bloom∣ing Season and that to my great Morti∣fication I could not arrest old Father  Time  Mr  Southwel  very politely said I should be always young but my Lord  urging his Departure he whispered me that he would come and pass the Evening with me  He kept his Word and gave me a long Detail of the Calamities he had suffered on Board a ManofWar where because some saucy Fellow called him a  Bastard  and he in Return broke his Head the Captain confined him sixteen Weeks to his Cabin but learning that he was very ill he per∣mitted him to come upon Deck he was supported by two Men weak cold and trembling as he assured me and ready to faint so that he was obliged to sit down upon which the Captain demanded how he dare to sit down in his Presence or to wear his Hat so he first knocked it off and then threw it into the Sea  These Indignities said he so highly provoked me that I retired to my Cabin resolved if ever I set my foot on Shore to call the Captain to an Account for them Accordingly as soon as we were on  English  Ground I challenged him for which Of∣fence I was mulcted eighteen Months pay so here is the History of poor  Dick  for you  I was sensibly touched with his Narra∣tion and could not help reflecting how ter∣ribly it must be to Gentlemen of Family and Education to bear with Insults from Wretches so far beneath them as those Marine Commanders frequently are who are perhaps advanced for being abject and no sooner are they advanced but they be∣come insolent Tyrants  And indeed I believe this is eternally the Case for it is a constant Remark that the worst Masters and Mistresses are those who have been Servants themselves they know what Frauds they have committed when in the like Situation and conse∣quently pry into such low Affairs as Per∣sons of genteel Birth and generous Educa∣tion could never think of and even if they were informed of them would chuse to overlook  Mr  Southwel  then told me Lord  Dle  had abused me all Day tho' for what Cause I know not but with blunt  Ben  in  Love for Love  I merrily told my Sea Officer that as for my Lord's Love or Liking I valued it not of a Rope's  End and that mayhap I liked him as little as he did me  I almost forced him to drink a Pint of Wine with me and would have also forced Half a Guinea on him but his Spirit would not admit of that  I was so highly provoked at Lord  Dle  's Insolence and Pride so lit∣tle becoming the Character of a Nobleman that I could not forbear writing some Lines on so proper a Subject for Satire which Mr  Southwel  had snatched from me and directly carried to his Lordship  I went next Morning to wait on Ad∣miral  Anson  with a Petition from the Sister of his Valet de Chambre who hap∣pened to be the first Man shot in his first Sea Engagement to whom beside a Part of the Prize then taken there was seven Years Wages due I was shewn into the Back Parlour of a small House in  HanoverSquare  It was well adorned with Books in Glass Cases even from the Ceiling to the Floor and on this Occasion as I had a thousand Pounds worth of Jewels left with me by Mr  Fisher  whose Father kept a  Shop in  Castlestreet Dublin  to dispose off for him knowing how much Dress com∣mands Respect I put a pair of Diamond Earrings into my Ears tied on a Diamond Solitaire and as for Lace and every other Appurtenance to suit those Ornaments I had them of my own  My glittering Appearance and being in a Chair soon b  ought the Admiral down in a rich Undress as he supposed by the Account delivered of me I must be a Wo∣man of Quality my Eyes were fast en∣gaged to the Books when he entered he begged my Pardon for his  Dishabille  I turned and said I was glad for once to see Learning and Valour so happily united  But no sooner did he find that I had only a Petition to deliver but his Coun∣tenance changed to the severe and he told me he believed People thought he had brought Home the Wealth of the  Indies  whereas he had not a single Shilling to com∣mand no more than the meanest Sailor aboard the Money being all as he said paid into the Treasury from whence no  Man without the utmost Difficulty could extract one single Farthing of it and hav∣ing the Word of so great a Man I really believed it A sad Discouragement to all Sailors to venture their Lives when even their very Admirals are not rewarded  However as I told the Admiral the Woman was actually starving he gave me a Guinea for her  When I returned Home I found in my Shop Lord  Dle  Mr  Skeffington  since dead and another Gentleman waiting for me Lord  Dle  asked what he had done to provoke me to write with so much Bitterness against him Nay my Lord what had I done to disoblige you or occasion your bestowing on me such gross Abuse as Mr  Southwel  assured me you did My Lord said upon his Honour it was false and taking me by the Hand assured me he would be a Friend to me provided I gave him no more of my Pen but as from that Hour to this he never did me any kind of Service I think the Obligation void on my Side and there∣fore  present my Readers with the follow∣ing Sketch of his inimitable Character  To the Right Honourable the Ld Vt  DLE  SATYRIC Muse let me prevail  On thee to picture  Dle  Fierce as the surly northern Gale  Is proud contemptuous  Dle    What makes the Artist rot in Jail  Trusting the baseborn  Dle    The Rosecheek'd Nymph turns wan and pale  Touch'd by infectious  Dle    Light Gossamer would turn the Scale  Weigh'd 'gainst the Wit of  Dle    Nay were thy Virtues put to Sale  A Mite o'errates them  Dle  Honour and Equity shall fail  E'er practis'd once by  Dle    For Hell may  Charon  hoist his Sail  O'er  Styx  to waft curst  Dle  In short my Subject now grows stale  I'm tir'd with Rhymes to  Dle    So were each Fault and Vice combin'd  That e'er debas'd the human Mind  To sum up all the black Detail  I'd name the Scoundrel  Dle  And now my Ld as I believe I am the first Poet who ever celebrated the illustrious Name of  St Ldgr  which Name by your supposed noble and rightwell remembered Father's Account you are as much intitled to as I am to that of  Plantagenet  I hope you will according to your true Nobility give me a hand∣some Reward for this extraordinary Pane∣gyric  And here I cannot avoid relating that I believe the true Cause of his Ldp's Aversion to me was this A little Time after I was separated from my Hus∣band as it was quite the Mode to attack me he employed one of his infernal Agents to inform me he should be glad to drink a Dish of Tea with me I told the Wretch I did not know his Ldp and there∣fore hoped he would excuse me  But the  Harridan  being resolved not to lose her Reward told my Ld I would meet him somewhere indeed I do not know the Place and introduced to him a great lusty masculine Woman dressed in a Calimanco Cap and Cloak or long Ridinghood I believe his Ldp wondered that such a Creature had made any Noise in the World so telling her he was sorry he had given her the Trouble of coming there he gave her a Guinea and hastly departed  A few Nights after this  Wrsdle  had  The Cure for a Scold  altered from  Shakespear  's  Taming of a Shrew  into a Ballad Opera by Mr  Pn  played for his own Benefit I wrote a flaming Pro∣logue to it in Honour of my fair Coun∣trywomen and  Wrsdle  insisted on my going to see it assuring me he would have a Lettice secured entirely for me or any Friends I should please to bring and would himself take care of placing me and also guarding me safe out for really I was very much afraid of receiving some Insult  On these Promises I ventured to go when behold the Lettice was full but that was no Matter the Ladies though my in∣timate Friends quickly decamped and Mrs  Dubg  the Fidler's Wife de∣clared she had like to faint at the Sight of the  odious Creature  the Rev Mr  Grn  also took to his Heels so I had indeed the whole Lettice for me and my Company which were two young Misses Daughters to my Landlady  My  Gorgon  Face instead of turning my Enemies into Stone clapped Wings to their Feet and made them fly down Stairs like so many feathered  Mercuries  Parson and all tho' he was bulky and tipsy and dull and so forth tho' indeed those Qualities might make him descend with the greater Velocity and give him a natural Alacrity in sinking  However by their precipitant Flight I got the front Row  When the Play began I forgot to keep up my Fan and two Gentlemen of Dis∣tinction in the Pit bowed to me pre∣sently after the Orange Girl came up and  said a Gentleman desired I would accept of half a Dozen Oranges I asked who it was and she shewed me a Person dressed in Scarlet trimmed with Black as I did not know him I told her it was a Mistake and a young Girl who followed her in said that was Ld  Dle  and that the Compliment was intended for her but the Orange Girl calling her very fami∣liarly by her Name which was  Nancy Raymond  swore to the contrary for said she you know how you used my Ld They talked to one another in the vulgar Tongue being exceedingly well known to each other having both followed the same Occupation of Orange and Oyster Selling and both came up Stairs into the World  To compose the Animosity I bought some Fruit and though I really paid for it I doubt not but his Ldp did also  When the Play was over to which I most heartily repented that I went  Wrs∣dle  came to put me into a Chair said he would sup with me and kept his Word  I related to him the PlayHouse Adven∣ture and asked him what kind of a Man Ld  Dle  was He told me he was both a very loose and a very unge∣nerous Man Qualities which no way re∣commended him to me so being honoured with a second Message from him I with an absolute  Sir not I  dismissed me back the cloudy Messenger  But to return  The next Day a most ugly squinting mean looking Fellow whose good Clothes made his Awkwardness but the more con∣spicuous came in to buy some Prints his Mind was portrayed in his Countenance where Impudence and Ignorance seemed to vie for Preeminence however he spoke to me with great Civility and perceiving by his Accent that he was an  Hibernian  I asked him how long he had been in  London  Curiosity lead me into a great deal of Chat with him and as he knew every great Family in  Ireland  their Ser∣vants at least he was able to give me a good deal of Intelligence I then enquired whether Business or Pleasure had brought  him to  London  He said both and pull∣ing out his PocketBook told me he would surprize me I cannot say indeed but he did for he shewed me Dr  Swift  's Head engraven in Vellum not in size much larger than a small Locket such as they wear in Rings yet so extremely like the Original that there was no Occasion to write the Name under it Several more Pieces of the same curious Work he shewed to me and said he hoped to make his Fortune by them in  London  I told him I was afraid he would be disappointed as Painting and Statuary were the Taste of the  English  Nobility beside this is Work more suited to a Wo∣man than a Man if I could do it it might turn to Account to me Upon which of his own Accord he begged I would pass his Works for mine and that he would give me a third part of the Profit arising from the Sale of them he gave me to un∣derstand he very well knew who I was and that our united Interest might be ser∣viceable to each other an Offer I did not reject  As he had many fine Mantlings cut he could very quickly insert the Arms so I desired he would finish one for General  Chhl  he obeyed me and I wait∣ed on the old Gentleman with it and a few complimentary Lines which I have now forgot I sent in my Presents and the General desired I might be shewn in He was in a very magnificent Drawing∣room adorned with Stucco Work the op∣posite Door opened into a Garden full blownthe General was seated on a rich Sopha at a Table adorned with Dres∣singplate He desired I might sit down on a Sopha opposite to him and ordered his Servant to remove the Table there were several Vases filled with Flowers sweetly smelling round the Chamber and for my part I rather imagined I was in some  Asian  Palace than a House in  Gros∣venorstreet  He thanked me for my Present  "But Madam said he it is to me quite use∣less as all my House is Stucco Work however if you'll be so kind as to come up stairs with me we may perhaps find  some Place where a Nail may be driven without Injury"  As the old Gentleman doubted I might possibly mistake his Meaning he was go∣ing to explain himself upon which I took up the Picture and in very great Confusion made the best Speed out of his House  I had not walked above twenty Yards when one of the General's Footmen over∣took me who told me his Master was afraid I might fall in a Fever if I walked in the Heat of so warm a Day and there∣fore desired I would accept of a Guinea to pay my Chair I took it and returned my Compliments  As there was something humorous in the General's Behaviour I addressed him the next Day in the following Lines  To the Hon Gen  CHHL  FIVE Weeks Great  Chll  to my Cost  Cutting your Coat of my Arms I lost  I por'd my Eyes I soil'd my Rayment  Not doubting of a gen'rous Payment  When well I wot your whole Design  Was bent to quarter your's with mine  Curse on your plaguy Stucco Work  Sure 'twas invented hy some  Turk  To bid to Christian Art Defiance  And overturn each beaut'ous Science  No Nail forsooth their  Paste  must enter  Would one were stuck in the Inventor  But will a Chief of  Marlborough  's Strain  The Off'ring of the Muse disdain  Or give her Reason to complain  Should I be seiz'd by Bailiff's Setter  What must I say that you're my Debtor  Why if they threat me with a Jail  I'll surely send to you for Bail  The Muse and Hero ne'er should quar∣rel  Our Bays thrives best beneath your Laurel  Your Province is to shine in Fight  But our's your noble Acts to write  Achilles  ' Deeds had lost their Glory  'Till famous made by  Homer  's Story  Nor can You eternize your Name  'Till we consign your Praise to Fame  Want damps the Poets genial Fire  Bounty can Thoughts sublime inspire  So crusted o'er with Flint and Clay  The Di'mond scarce emits a Ray  'Till disencumber'd of the Mold  Polish'd with Art and set in Gold  Resplendent Glory it displays  And rivals  Phoebus  ' Noontide Blaze  I never received any Answer to these Lines but in a very short time after I heard the General was Dead  I gave the young Man both his Coat of Arms and the Guinea so we resolved next to address the Earl of  Stair  then Veldt Marshal  It is a very great Loss to me that by the Ignorance of my Daughter half of my Writings were burned for she never scru∣pled if even the Fire was bad to take a whole Bundle of them to enliven it but whether this may be any Loss to the World I must leave to their Judgment  I can recollect but very few Lines of the Poem to his Excellency which were as follows  To his Excellency the Earl of  STAIR  Arma Virumque cano  Virg Aen  IN  Rome  when all was Happiness and Ease  In the full Splendor of voluptuous Days  Their Chiefs neglected sought the silent Shade  'Till loudly summon'd to their Country's Aid  For when tempestuous Ills assault a Realm  They call their ablest Pilot to the Helm  To guard their Freedom to preserve their Fame  So Godlike  Stair  so  Cincinnatus  came  Alike illustrious in their Country's Cause  Guardians of dying Liberty and Laws  Accept my Lord this Off'ring nor re∣fuse  The varied Labours of an artless Muse  No H  rald can add Lustre to thy Birth  No Poet justly praise thy noble Worth  Yet let the fair Attempt Acceptance find  And my weak Sex plead to thy gen'rous Mind  What Wonders then may I hereafter do  At once protected and inspir'd by You  A very fine young Gentleman undertook to deliver my Present to the Earl and a Servant shewed me into a Parlour In a few Minutes the Gentleman returned and said my Lord desired to see me so he handed me up into a full Levee of Stars and different coloured Ribbons As I had never before been in so august an Assembly I was ready to die with Shame especially as there was not one of my own Sex to keep me in Countenance My Lord in a most polite manner thanked me for the Honour as he termed it I had done him and the Noblemen after his Example seemed to contend who should praise me most to which I could make no other Re∣turn than Courtesies and Blushes  At length the Earl of  Stair  said there was a Defect in the placing the Swords which go through the Veldt Marshal's Arms  which he would willingly have altered and brought me out a Print of the Noblemen's Arms who held the same Dignity in  France  as a Pattern I told his Lordship I could easily alter it  "Pray then do Madam returned he for I admire your Work so much that I would willingly have it quite compleat"  Accordingly it was finished and the next Morning I waited on his Excellency with it when to my great Surprize I had no Admission to him but a Footman brought down five Guineas to me  I was not a little surprized at this sudden Alteration in his Lordship's Mind But what had the Fool who did the Work done truly told Major  Elliotson  that I made a Hand of his Performances he told my Lordwho vexed at being im∣posed upon sent me the Trifle above∣mentioned which was not by any means a Payment for the Labour and Curiosity of the Work and what from a Person of his Station I should not have thought an extraordinary Reward even for the Lines  So finding the Folly of the Man I would not undertake to dispose of any more cut Vellum but left him to make his most of it  I should never have thought this Fellow worth speaking of only that my Husband has said he was my G  llant not that I owe any Reverence or Honour to him or re∣gard what he can say any more than the idle Wind but that I would not have such an Imputation laid on my Understanding to say I made Choice of a lowborn ugly illiterate Scoundrel No no Mr  Pn  may rest assured that if I would have done him the Honour to exalt his Horn like that of an Unicorn it should at least have been to me a  CornuCopia  But alas poor I have been for many Years a  Noun Substantive  obliged to stand alone which praise to the eternal Goodness I have done notwithstanding the various Efforts of my Enemies to destroy me many of whom I have lived to triumph over though they encompassed me on every Side like so many Bulls of  Basan  and though they should now kick up their  Heels like so many wild Asses in the Valley of  Geohron  though the Dunces should make Songs of me and though  Envy shou'd my fairest Deeds belie  I think it would not afflict me but that I should be able to convince them I had at least Patience Hope and Charity suffi∣cient to make them ashamed of the Injuries they have been weak and wicked enough to offer  Because I would now fairly challenge my most malicious Foes to answer from the Tribunal of their own Conscience what Provocation I ever gave them to use me ill  Whom have I defrauded or belyed Nay indeed of whom have I spoke half the Evil which it was in my Power to do There are few Characters immaculate and had I an Inclination to retaliate Injuries I am I believe able enough to do it  And sometimes one has so strong an In∣clination to it that it is hard to resist es∣pecially when a Lady of Quality that is  by Marriage for her Grandfather was a Smith at  Gn  and kept the Sign of the Horseshoe there as I have frequently heard the late Lord  Montgarret  relate could because I presumed to beg she would do me the Honour of being a Sub∣scriber to me a Privilege I thought a long Acquaintance might have entitled me to take order my Maid to be kicked and as I am really ashamed to use her Lady∣ship's Words on the Occasion being much too indecent for a Repetition methinks she might have spared them especially to one who knew her too  When she was a Maid if she e'er was a Maid  When afraid of a Man if she e'er was afraid  Heaven knows poor ******* had but the Leavings of half the Town but he botched up a broken Reputation with Matrimony an admirable Salve  As she was pleased to say my Life could be nothing but a continued Series of I am ashamed to speak the WordI dare say had it been so she would have purchased my Book sooner than the Bible to indulge her private Meditations especially if I had the wicked Art of paint∣ing up Vice in attractive Colours as too many of our Female Writers have done to the Destruction of Thousands amongst whom Mrs  Manly  and Mrs  Haywood  de∣serve the foremost Rank  But what extraordinary Passions these Ladies may have experienced I know not far be such Knowledge from a modest Woman Indeed Mrs  Haywood  seems to have dropped her former luscious Stile and for Variety presents us with the in∣sipid Her  Female Spectators  are a Col∣lection of trite Stories delivered to us in stale and wornout Phrases bless'd Re∣volution  Yet of the two less dang'rous is th' Offence  To tire the Patience than mislead the Sense  And here give me Leave to observe that amongst the Ladies who have taken up the Pen I never met with but two who de∣served the Name of a  Writer  the first is Madam  Dacier  whose Learning Mr  Pope  while he is indebted to her for all the Notes on  Homer  endeavours to depreciate the second is Mrs  Catherine Philips  the matchless  Orinda  celebrated by Mr  Cowly  Lord  Orrery  and all the Men of Genius who lived in her Time  I think this incomparable Lady was one of the first Refiners of the  English  Numbers Mr  Cowly  's though full of Wit have somewhat harsh and uncouth in them while her Sentiments are great and virtuous her Diction natural easy flow∣ing and harmonious  Love she wrote upon with Warmth but then it was such as Angels might share in without injuring their original Purity Her Elegy on her Husband's Daughter is a Proof of the Excellency and Tenderness of her own Heart rarely met with in a Stepmother nor could I ever read it without Tears a Proof it was wrote from her Heart  And dear  Orinda  gentle Shade sweet Poet Honour of thy Sex Oh if thou hast Power to do it inspire me for sure Thou art in the happy Bowers of Bliss praising that eternal Goodness who to the Loss of this World took Thee early away to adorn the Holiest of Holies where in Songs of Love not illessay'd below great Saint Thou continuest to celebrate thy Maker  Oh pour thy Spirit o'er my Lays  Coelestial Melody inspire  Sweet as the Royal Psalmist's Lyre  That I with Thee may hymn his Praise  I cannot except my own Countrywoman Mrs  Grierson  find out another female Writer whose Works are worth reading she indeed had a happy and wellimproved Genius I remember she wrote a very fine Poem on Bishop  Berkley's Ber∣mudian  Scheme the Plan of it was this She supposes that the Night before St  Paul  suffered an Angel appeared to comfort him with the future Prospect of the Church  and the Growth of Christianity the Angel informs him that in such a Year there shall be born in the Western Island a great Apostle who shall be known by this Token  'Tis he from Words first rids Philosophy  And lays the dull material System by  Affrights the daring Libertine to find  Naught round him but the pure allholy Mind  The blushing Sinner from his Covert draws  Of Matters various Forms and Motions Laws  His only Fortress from the Atheist takes  And his atomic World at once unmakes  I am sorry that I cannot recollect any more of this Poem or that the Prophecy con∣tained in it of the Bishop's converting the  Indians  was by the Avarice of some in Power frustrated for surely he was well fitted for that holy Mission having Learn∣ing and Innocence in Perfection Nor do I at all doubt that had this true Embassador  of  Christ  been enabled to pursue the sacred Purpose of his Soul but the Power of working Miracles would have been added to his other heavenly Gifts  I have been accused of writing bitterly against the Clergy I never did but when they forgot their own High Calling one B in particular says  "that I  Alexander  the Coppersmith have done him much Wrong in talking about Pence and Farthings and such small Coin whereas he has within these two and twenty Years given me the Sum total of sixteen Pounds  Irish  in hard Gold out of which had I been indus∣trious I might have made a comfortable Livelihood"  But I am afraid had he been in my Case he would have starved Happy for him his Father was born be∣fore him and  Happy is the Son whose Fa∣ther is gone to the Devil  is an old Pro∣verb But indeed now my L I take it a little unkindly that you should declare in public that you had me as well as my Maid  sur la Tapis  methinks tho' you are a Conjurer you need not be a  Blab Oh fy is it thus you return my generous Passion for by your own Ac∣count you did not pay me well why  Juggy Mackshane  the Chairman's Wife had a better Price from you and you made her Son a Parson while you quarrelled with mine for having his Bu  ton holes worked in the best Taste and told him he must be very wicked to be guilty of such Extravagance Were not you a little censorious think you Why you tho' in the Vauward of your Youth have yet a strong Dash of the Coxb and might excuse it in a Boy Well but as these said sixteen Pounds are so insisted on I acknow∣ledge to have received them and should have thanked you but that you sent me Word in  London  you did not know who I was and that it was very impudent in me to apply to you for Charity but lest you should again forget me I am willing to be your sweet Remembrancer And oh by our chaste Love I conjure you to make my Husband a Dean sure this you ought to do when you say you made him a Cuckhold besides you know it was in  that sweet Hope I yielded up my Heart then be a gentle Mediator between us plead for me as you did for the fair  Mrs  Pilkington  Quaker tho' Historians relate that your Lady would have been as well pleased had you been less assiduous in that Affair  And now I confess I am a little spite∣ful but it is only Jealousy send me an hundred Pounds to cure the Anguish your Infidelity has given me and I will try to conquer my hopeless illstar'd Passion  Your L's Poetry in my Praise I never can forget and as it would be a Loss to the World if any Part of so justly an admired Author's Works should be bu∣ried in Oblivion take oh World the following Lines  I scorn to drag about a Flame  For any She that thinks my Love Blame  I'll take a Resolution to be free  Without Return I scorn to burn  And oh I will be free  Your second Poem is I confess a little obscure yet no doubt may have much Meaning in it  Oh thou  Jow Jow Bow Wough  And indeed I remember another R R Author who entertained some very polite Company with the following Epi∣taph written as he assured us by himself it is very laconic  Here lies Major  Brady  and St  Comeen  Sure such a Saint and such a Major never were seen  If the curious Reader cannot digest this Heavenborn Verse why let him be gra∣minivercus and chew the Cud  But pray my L do not you think it was a little ill judged of you to attack my Character at the Expence of your own and to describe yourself as such a Cormo∣rant in Love that you must have two Fe∣males at once why  Turk Gregory  never did such Feats in Arms  Oh rav'nous Hell Kite  Wou'dst thou have Maid and Mistress  At one fell  This Word admits of various Readings some call it  Swoop  some  Souse  some  Swop  which latter I chuse  Swop  Truth is I am afraid this is apocryphal and will win no Credit especially as it was after your Expedition to the South of  France  when you were ill of the  c c c  But prithee now for I think I am en∣titled to talk a little familiarly to you do not boast of Abilities either of Mind or Body which you never had no Person living will believe you any more than they would me if I should tell them I had been a great Beauty when they could see no Remains of it  But you are as the good Man said of  Nero  a very Wag  Hang it why should you and I go to Loggerheads Order your Equipage to drive here tomorrow Morning and let us buss as we used to do and be Friends  Otherwise I have two or three Pieces  of the same Stuff of which I have given you Samples at your Service  Lord 'tis a strange Thing that all B will needs be Authors now would they avoid manifesting their Dulness we the illiterate might conclude they were Men of profound Erudition and that on that Account they were advanced to their high Stations but the Devil owes some of them a Shame and is when they do his Work an excellent Paymaster yet it is strange this same Dulness is not confined to them it descends to their Sons witness our celebrated Comedy  The Suspicious Husband  which but for it's neither hav∣ing one Character well drawn any Plot any thing like a Sentiment and wrote too in a gallimawfry Stile might be a good Performance but as long as it is stamped with a Name it passes current tho' Ster∣ling NoSense  But my Ld B tho' I have di∣gressed from you yet see my Love I re∣turn again Ah it was well I did not even from Scripture pick up an unsavory Si∣mile I am much offended that you should  say when I was last at Shrift with your Holiness that we had no better Accom∣modation for our Feast of Love but a Carpet whereas I insist on it that the Pe∣nance you enjoyned me was as easy as a Downbed could make it so here I inva∣lidate your Evidence in one Point and the rest of your Accusation naturally falls to the Ground  But being now tired at laughing at you I'll tell you an  Arabian  Tale There was a really generous Man who built a fine Pa∣vilion to which were an Hundred Open∣ings as the Poor had free access to it they were relieved by him at every Opening and Avenue they blessed his Goodness and his Fame flew far  There was in his Neighbourhood the Son of an old Miser who was left im∣mensely rich he was of a sordid Temper yet emulous of Praise so he built such an∣other Pavilion and in like Manner dis∣tributed Alms it so fortuned that one old Man attacked him seven times in the same Morning at seven of the Entrances he met him again at the eighth and asked  for an Alms at this he lost all Patience and cried  "Did not I seven times re∣lieve you"  "Ah quoth the poor Man Lord bless my Lord  Aboulcasem  I have walked three hundred times round his Pavilion been three hundred times relieved and yet I am certain he does not know my Face  So to apply the Story God bless my dear loved Lord  Kingsborough  who gives Hundreds without blowing a Trumpet be∣fore his good Deeds or defaming the Cha∣racters of those whom his Bounty blesses  I have often been surprized at one of our Cs which to shew my Charity I will insert  O Lord who alone workest great Mar∣vels send down upon our B and C the healthful Spirit of thy Grace  Marvellous  would it be indeed if they had either  Health Spirit  or  Grace  no Doubt but the learned Compilers of the Liturgy had their own Reasons for this supernatural Invocation but why nothing less than a  Miracle should bless these any more than any other Order of Men I leave to some future Commentators and hope they will oblige us with Annotations on this extra∣ordinary Ejaculation  I would not incur the Censure of the Cl so far as to give a Hint that they are not  sound  No no many of them are but then it is so sound as things that are hollow Impiety hath made a Feast of them and now that their Bones are mar∣rowless their Blood is cold and Specula∣tion dwells not in their Eyes they hate us Youth Gorbellied K Bacon fed ah would we had the shaking of their Bags I knew one of them who without the least Study wrote the following two elegant and learned Lines  Yon slanting Mountains glow with blue Marine  And yon cornuted Moons two Horns give shine  I know the Gentlemen had too much Mo∣desty and Diffidence of their own superior  Talents to give their Works to the Press but I hope as they are charitable they won't be displeased as they are above mak∣ing Money of their Performances that I should since they though but little serve to swell my Volume and no doubt will edify my Readers I think I have nothing to boast of as a Writer but a great Memory for if I could not have retained  Shakespear Milton  c and the great Authors I have last mentioned to give a Taste of their Wit when I was myself at a Loss I do not know how I could ever have com∣passed three Volumes of Memoirs  Indeed if I had printed all the Poetry that has been sent me for that purpose since I came to this Kingdom it would have proved as odd a Medley as any thing ever yet exhibited to publick View I suppose every one who fancied they had Wit had a mind to see how it would look in Print but I must beg to be excused Though the learned Mr  Timothy Ticklepitcher  pres∣sed very hard for a Place it would be a strong Proof of my Vanity to insert his anti sublime Compliments to me  Another poetical Gentleman wrote me a long Letter in a Text Hand which put me into a Palpitation of the Heart as I was about that time threatened for certain scan∣dalous Truths I have been guilty of relat∣ing with some Law and truly I hate that as much as Sir  John Falstaff  did Secu∣rity When I in plain  English  set down undeniable Facts they menace me with Law I would as lieve they would stop my Mouth with Ratsbane But I find I am like Sir  John  not only witty myself but am also the Occasion that Wit is in others there is not an Halfpenny Paper can peep its Head out but presently my Name must be dragged in by Head and Shoulders to grace it But to the Letter Having recovered my Spirits I read it over and found a great many Compli∣ments with a Promise that the profound Author would wait on me at Four o'Clock I never thought of it till the time appointed when  The punctual Devil kept his Word  I own I supposed he came to see if he could  Convey out of my Box of Hints by a Trick  Sincerely believing he dealt with Old Nick  And I always suspect Falshood to lurk un∣der a full Peruke He just came in with a huge fat Man as fat as Butter with him but would not stay for which Reason I will not print his fond Letter so I think I am even with him If I were any way given to be proud I think I have a great deal of Reason to be so since I cannot go any where as I am not very well known but I hear some Piece of my own History quite new I am seen in this Place and t'other Place and say something mighty witty to be sure  I do not wonder that Persons of For∣tune and Distinction of this Kingdom go to  England  to spend their Time and E∣states since here be you as chaste as Ice or pure as Snow thou shalt not escape Calumny especially among your halfbred halfwitted Gentry but  Let my unhappy Tale be falsely told  By the rash Young or the illnatur'd Old  Let ev'ry Tongue it's various Censures chuse  Absolve with Coldness or with Spite ac∣cuse  Fair Truth at last her radiant Beams shall raise  And Malice vanquish'd heighten'd Vir∣tue's  PRIOR  Praise  In  London  almost every one in the mid∣dling State of Life has some Employment or Diversion to kill their Time and here it is the reverse we are all Gentry where∣fore the Females have no Amusement but that of SLANDER  Where  Rufa  with her Comb of Lead  Whispers that  Sappho  's Hair is red  I should be very glad e'er they look for the Mote in my Eye they would be pleased to pull the Beam out of their own I could mention Numbers of these Scandalmon∣gers  who have said  "Oh Lord may be she'll put us down in her  Memorials  "  But goon incorrigible Dunces too contemp∣tible for my Notice All I shall beg of the  Men  is never to believe any thing that is said of me by a  Woman  as it is more than Four to One it is a LyeBut as the great  Milton  's Genius could even descend to Hell so I think I must mention one Mrs  Irdll  who hearing I got Money for my Work a thing she could never do exclaimed bitterly against me nay even kept her Bed for a Week on Account of it and wrote two or three very stupid Pa∣pers against me and though she could not shew her Wit at least shewed Envy Ma∣lice and all Uncharitableness  I know a very ingenious Gentleman who whenever he sees a Parcel of Females seated at their Tea names the Chamber  Pandaemonium  and Dr  Young  in one of his Satires says  Tea how I tremble at the dreadful Stream  As  Lethe  fatal to the Love of Fame  What Devastations on thy Banks are seen  What Shades of mighty Names that once have been  And I really cannot remember ever to have seen a Set of Ladies tippling this Li∣quor but Scandal strait ensued ay even amongst our new Teachers commonly called  Moravians  amongst whom I had in  London  the Misfortune to live and whom though they took themselves to be inspired I really always believed to be under the Delusion of  Satan  One of the holy Sisters once told me the Devil inspired  Milton  ay and me into the Bargain Truly she did his infernal Majesty the greatest Honour he ever yet received and I could not avoid thinking her either very ignorant or very wicked but I comforted myself with hoping that the former was her Fault and that she did not know how heinous a Sin she commit∣ted when she robbed the Maker of his Glory and attributed his best Gifts and Graces to the common Enemy of Man I  think I might justly apply to these Secta∣ries Mr  Pope  's Lines  'Tis your's a  Bacon  and a  Locke  to blame  A  Newton  's Genius and a Seraph's Flame  But oh with One Immortal One dis∣pense  The Source of  Newton  's Light and  Ba∣con  's Sense  Content each Emanation of his Fires  That beams on Earth each Science he inspires  Each Art he prompts each Charm he can create  Whate'er he gives is giv'n for you to hate  Go on by all divine in Man unaw'd  But learn ye Dunces not to mock your God  I believe these Wretches would be very proud of being persecuted but our Go∣vernors of the same Mind with the witty and gallant Emperor  Julian  vulgarly call∣ed the  Apostate  will neither hinder them to assemble nor preach any more  than he did the  Galileans  unless they preach Sedition and then they come under the Penalty of the Law  Poor  Julian  the Christians murdered him for not permitting them to murder each other St  Gregory  the Younger preaching old St  Gregory  's Funeral Ser∣mon forty Years after the Death of  Julian  when one would have thought Resentment might be also dead if he had any Cause for it has these remarkable Words  "And now says he here lies my Uncle dead who delivered you from the Persecution of that old Bullburning Tyrant  Julian  Now who had a greater Hand in his Death than my Uncle For once when he and his Captain of the Archers came in to hear Mass had he not suddenly gone away my Uncle would have kicked him"  The Translator says he had more Difficulty with this Passage than all the rest of the Work for he would fain have had the Kicking intended for the Captain of the Archers not being able to conceive that the Emperor of the World  should be afraid that an old Priest should kick him  But the old Priest prophesied that such a Day this Apostate should die and truly he took especial Care that his Prophecy should be fulfilled by hiring one of the Emperor's own Soldiers to put him to Death  I could say something more why should I not nay out it must I believe if my favourite Apostle St  Paul  had not behaved himself with more good Manners than our modern  New Lighters  he would not have  almost  persuaded his Auditors to be Chri∣stians how noble is his Answer on the Oc∣casion  But he was as remarkably a fine Gentle∣man as he was a Saint a Martyr and a Christian like Dr  Delany  whose preaching goes even to the dividing of the Blood and Spirit And let me here dear Sir beg you will fulfil a Promise you gave me many Years ago that you would at∣tend my last Moments if I send to you will you refuse to chear a dying Sinner with Hope of Peace and Pardon for the Doctrine of Damnation is now so universally recei∣ved  that Half the World are cast into Des∣pair  These poor Enthusiasts used in  London  to steal every thing they could lay their Hands on from me insomuch that at last they stole my one Pair of Shoes and yet they brought Scripture Authority for Theft for they said the Children of  Israel borrowed Jewels of Gold and Silver  of the  Egyptians  which they ran away with  and they spoiled the  Egyptians I remember I once menti∣oned this Passage to Dr  Delany  who understanding  Hebrew  perfectly turned over to it to there where it is very differ∣rently related For the  Egyptians  finding so many Plagues brought on them and particularly the Leprosy with which these People were all infected ordered them to depart but they declared they would not go unless their Hire was paid to them and also so many Changes of Apparel and Jewels of Gold given to support them in their Pilgrimage how they behaved them∣selves in the Wilderness is so well set forth in the  Old Testament  that it would puzzle a wiser Head than mine to know how they  became the peculiar Favourites of an im∣partial and unprejudiced Deity  Indeed it were to be wished that ei∣ther this learned and excellent Divine or some other of equal Abilities if such may be found would oblige the World with a new Translation of the  Old Testament  since as we now have it it seems filled with Incon∣gruities Indecencies and shocking Absur∣dities such as the Holy Spirit could never have dictated  whose Body is Light and whose Shadow Truth  I beg pardon for this rambling Digres∣sion and hope the Divines will not censure me for it as I only presume to give them Hints which their superior Knowledge may improve upon  And justify the Ways of God to Man  For I intend not this Address to the ig∣norant Part of the Clergy who would many of them be more fit to till the Earth than plant or water the Gospel but to the learn∣ed just and pious that they may remove Scruples from weak Minds  raise up those  that are fallen and finally beat down Satan under our Feet  which God of his infinite Mercy enable them to do through the Me∣rits and Mediation of our Lord  Jesus Christ  But once more to return to my Shop One Afternoon two young Gentlemen came into it one of whom asked me for some Tea I told him I did not sell any but that there was a CoffeeHouse next Door where he might be supplied He asked me would not I give a Dish of Tea to a Friend and Relation I said yes with Pleasure Why then said he this Gentleman is Dean  M  ade  's Son of  Cor    and my Name is  Blndn  as his Father was married to Brigadier  Meade's  Widow I gave them an Invitation into the Parlour and ordered some Tea to be got ready I was really very glad to see any Person from  Ireland  particularly those I was allied to nor could I conceive that they came in that manner only to insult a Woman who never of∣fended either of them indeed as for the Dean's Son I must acquit him for he did not affront me but I took it ill he should bring with him a Fellow he knew designed it  There was nothing gross indecent abu∣sive or unmannerly which this Wretch did not without the least Provocation say to me till at length though I am not really of a passionate Disposition I lost all Pa∣tience and thinking myself very much his Betters I asked him whether his Father continued to sell Buttermilk to the Poor at a Penny a Quart with his own Hand in a hard Season when every other Person gave their's away  Upon this he very politely threatened to kick me but as he was then at a great Di∣stance from his own Dunghill and I am sure I give  CastleBlndn  its proper Title when I stile it one I was not in the least intimidated and only bade him go shew his Slaves how choleric he was and  Make his Bondmen tremble  And here excuse me Sir if I give your Picture to the World When you make Love if any but the leadendarted  Cupid  ever touched your unworthy groveling base Heart your Argument is that of a  Highwayman's you bring a loaden Pistol clap it to the Fairone's Bosom and say  "De∣liver your Treasure or you are dead"  Could not you have taken your ancient Father the old Stick picker's Advice and have coaxed the Girl and have given her a Cherrycoloured Topknot but you  Were like the haughty hotbrain'd  Spa∣niard  Instead of Love you brought a Poignard  And filthy as your rotten Leg and more corrupted Soul must have been every thing you could produce for thou art the Quintessence of Filth and I am weary of writing when every thing base every thing low every thing insolent is the Theme and all comprised in pretty Master  Jacky Blndn  As I have mentioned an Attempt to write a Play which  Is a bold Pretence  To Learning Genius Wit and Eloquence  I present my Readers with an Act of it and would with great Pleasure finish it but that I am certain our present Manager would never permit it to be played m  ly because it was mine for since his Prejudice against me though how I incurred his Displeasure I know not carried him him so far as to say a Prologue I wrote for the King's BirthNight was Blasphemy I don't know but he may be ingenious enough to prove the Play to be HighTreason but lest my Readers should be∣lieve me capable of writing any thing like it I present them with the Lines  PROLOGUE  WHILE foreign Climes are rent with dire Alarms  The Shout of Battle and the Clang of Arms  Britannia  happy in her Monarch's Care  Enjoys at once the Fruits of Peace and War  And while her Thunders o'er the Ocean roll  And spread her rising Fame from Pole to Pole  Sees her victorious Fleets the Sea com∣mand  And Plenty Wealth and Pleasure bless the Land  Fair Science joyful lifts her laurell'd Head  The Muses in the Groves delighted tread  Or near the Azure Fount or haunted Spring  Their great INSPIRER and PROTECTOR sing  The Woods the Vales resound AUGUSTUS' Name  His glorious Actions and immortal Fame  Shou'd Heav'n th' inimitable  Shakespear  raise  To breathe Historic Truth in tuneful Lays  How wou'd the Poet in sublimer Strains  With GEORGE's Virtue elevate his Scenes  Transmit his Wisdom to the future Age  The noblest Theme that e'er adorn'd a Stage  Not the Great Ruler of the genial Year  Whose radiant Beams the whole Creation chear  Inspires such Joy such Rapture such De∣light  As swells each Bosom at their Monarch's Sight  Oh may our Loyalty this Bliss deserve  And Heav'n the Hero to our Hopes pre∣serve  I believe none but such a Conjurer as Mr  Sherridan  would have found out Blas∣phemy in these Lines and I am sorry he did not say they were as flat Burglary too as ever was committed but he is a Judge a Gentleman his Father was an Author ay and a Parson and for the signal Fa∣vours he has bestowed on me I return him these my Acknowledgments

found it was the Letter I wrote for  Tom Brush  neatly copied and directed to me and that lest it should miscarry he had brought it himself  I said it was a very genteel Piece of Gal∣lantry and quite now He told me he  was going to his Seat in the County of  Sur∣rey  the next Day and gave me a very kind Invitation to pass the Remainder of the Summer there but as he was a young gay single Gentleman I did not hold it convenient  Pray Madam said he do you never go to the Opera No really Sir not but that I love Music but it happens to be too expensive an Entertainment for me Well then Madam returned he I must insist on having the Honour of treating you to it on which he downright forced a Cou∣ple of Guineas on me and making me promise to correspond with him till his Re∣turn to  London  we parted  Unfortunately I lost his Direction and so had it not in my Power to keep my Word  And I do assure my Readers I did not go to the Opera wisely considering that two Pound two would be of infinitely more Service to me than it could possibly be to Mr  Heydeigger  But alas before the Return of Winter I had neither Shop nor almost an Habi∣tation  By what strange Reverse of For∣tune I was again reduced to the utmost Calamity and by what unexpected and sig∣nal Mercy delivered from it must as it is impossible for me to get it into the Com∣pass of this Volume be the Subject of a Third  I should be highly ungrateful not to ac∣knowledge the Favour and Bounty of the whole Body of the Nobility Clergy and Gentry of this Kingdom whose Goodness as it is my highest Pride to own so it shall ever be my utmost Ambition to merit and if their poor Servant can in the least contribute to their Entertainment she shall think herself overpaid or to use my dear Mr  Cibber  's Words  As for what's left of Life if yet 'twill do  'Tis at your Service pleas'd while plea∣sing you  But then mistake me not when you've enough  One thin Subscription shews all Parties off  Or Truth in homely Proverb to advance  I pipe no longer than you care to dance  But oh my loved honoured and ex∣cellent Lord  Kingsborough  where shall I find Words adequate to the Sense I have of your Goodness your unlimited Gene∣rosity thou kind Preserver of mine and my Son's Life  Did Eloquence divine adorn my Speaking  Tho' ev'ry Muse and ev'ry Grace should crown me  Why then ev'n then I should fall short  Of my Soul's Meaning  But as with You my Muse began with You also she must end yet not 'till I re∣late the following Story  I saw in  London  the truly elegant and beautiful Speech of a certain great Man not long since our supreme Governor here I was really so charmed with it that I wrote the following Lines which I shewed to Mr  Cibber  As his Excellency was re∣turned to  England  Mr  Cibber  was so well  pleased with them that as he was particu∣larly intimate with him he undertook to deliver them and said he did not doubt but he would give me a handsome Re∣ward To give this Thesis plainer Proof I put it to the Test  To his Excellency the Earl of  CHESTER∣FIELD  O THOU to bind whose awful Brow  Triumphant Laurels joy to grow  To whom the Sons of Science bend  As to the great inspiring Soul  That brightens and informs the whole  The Muses Patron Judge and Friend  Never did  Britain  's King before  A Substitute so noble find  Nor ever yet deputed Pow'r  With such transcendent Lustre shin'd  For when to grace  Hibernia  's Throne  The Godlike  Chesterfield  was giv'n  How did the joyful People own  Their Monarch's Love the Care of Heav'n  On thy exalted  His Speech to both Houses of  Parliament  in  Dublin  Speech  their Senates hung  And blest the Elocation of thy Tongue  'Tis  Stanhope  can alone untie  The  Gordian  Knot of Policy  He ev'ry Kingdom's Int'rest knows  Were to his Care the World consign'd  Th' Almighty's everlasting Mind  Might there secure his Trust repose  Thy Genius for all Stations fit  The Reins of Empire knows to guide  Nor less the sacred Realms of Wit  Acknowledge thee their Boast and Pride  So  Phoebus  rules the Chariot of the Day  And charms the Groves with his melodi∣ous Lay  How did of late the Nations fear  Sickness the Messenger of Fate  Would take thee to thy native Sphere  'Midst throned Gods to hold thy State  We fear'd a Soul so eminently wise  Was call'd to grace th' Synod of the Skies  But soon the Roselip'd Cherub Health  Commission'd by the Pow'r Divine  Restor'd  Britannia  's Dearest Wealth  The Glory of her Patriot Line  Oh may'st Thou long from better Worlds be spa  'd  And late receive thy Virtues full Reward  Ev'n I whom many Griefs oppress  Enraptur'd with thy flowing Strain  A while forget my own Distress  And Anguish ceases to complain  Such Charms to Heav'nborn Eloquence belong  And such the magic Force of sacred Song  I ought to have premised that just as I had finished this Poem  Wrsdle  came in and snatched it from me saying he would send it himself to his old Friend  Phil  p  I could not get it from him but as I remembered every Syllable of it I wrote it in a better Hand than that rough Draught I had given to Mr  Cibber  and having the Honour of his Correction who  is a fair and candid Critic sent it again to him  Wsdle  came in the Evening told me that the Earl sent him many Thanks and would be glad to see his old Friend  Upon this I asked  Wrsdle  to lend me Half a Crown to buy a Pair of Shoes which he absolutely refusing when he had convinced me he had fifty Guineas in his Pocket I though illshod was obliged to rest contented  Early next Morning I received from Mr  Cibber  the following short Epistle  MADAM  THE Poetry of poor People how∣ever it may rise in Value always sinks in the Price what might in happier Hours have brought you ten Guineas for it's intrinsic Worth is now reduced to two which I desire you will come and re∣ceive from the Hand of  Your old humble Servant COLLEY CIBBER  By this I found Mr  Wrsdle  had boasted of an Interest in his Excellency which he certainly never had for who would have even given me that small Re∣ward that had received the Poem before from another Hand would they not have laughed at me  I waited on Mr  Cibber  who told me he had given my Poem to his Excellency with these Words  "That if he had not thought it beautiful he would not have ta∣ken the Liberty of presenting it to him"  "As Dinner said he was just brought up my Lord put it into his Pocket In the Evening I reminded him of it He told me he was attack'd by all the World with paultry Rhimes which his Ld always best rewarded"  The next Day Mr  Cibber  attacked his Excellency again and asked him how he liked the Lines Upon which he said  "Oh I had forgot there's two Guineas for her but don't put them into your Sil∣ver Pocket lest you should make a Mistake and pay your Chair with them  So here Madam are the two Guineas for you"  As I was entirely indebted to Mr  Cibber  for this Bounty I return my Acknowledgements to Him  My dear Lord  Kingsborough  I never should have related this Story except by way of Contrast to your amiable Virtues for I may justly say with  Swift  My fav'rite Lord is none of those  Who owe their Virtue to their Stations  Or Characters to Dedications  His Worth altho a Poet said it  Before a Play would lose no Credit  Nor  Swift  would dare deny him Wit  Altho' to praise it I have writ  Just as I was writing about  Wrsdle  a Gentleman brought me a Pamphlet en∣tituled  A Parallel between Mrs  Pilking∣ton  and Mrs  Phillips  written by an  Ox∣ford  Scholar  as he tells us himself star∣ving in a Garret Pray Mr Scholar deal ingenously did not  Wrsdle  hire you to write it because he was indolent dull I  suppose you mean if he can write so much better than I let him give the World a Proof of his Abilities but it seems he is discontented that I have not sufficiently ex∣posed him Why let him have but a little Patience and my Life on't he shall have no Cause of Complaint on that Head but I cannot break in on the Order of Time so far as to give the World a second Act of him yet  Unity of Time and Place you know Mr Critick must be observed otherwise we must renounce the Stagyrite  If you intend your Performance for a Satire on me truly your Words are so clerkly couched that I cannot find any Sting in themYou say I admired the Dean for being a Brute  N B  You lye and none but a Villain would call him one I admired his Charity Wit Sense Taste  c  and to say he had Passions which ob∣scured for a while his shining and uncom∣mon Excellencies is no more than saying he was human and consequently liable to Error  Then you ask me how I dare mention Mr  Pope  Why truly like  Drawcansir  all this I can do because I dareI never refused doing Justice to his poetical Merits but all your Art can never per∣suade the World that he was not an en∣vious Defamer of other Men's good Parts and intolerably vain of his own How does he boast of his Acquaintance with the Great even to childish Folly The late Earl of  Peterborough  could not divert him∣self with pruning a Tree in his Garden but presently we are told of it in these high∣sounding unharmonious Words  And he whose Thunder storm'd th'  Iberian  Lines  Now forms my Quincunx and now prues my Vines  Why one would have thought he had hired the Earl for a Gardener  And as for his Gratitude let that appear by his Poem called  Taste  wherein he abuses the late Duke of  Chandos  for his Munificence to Writers whereof take the following Sample  His Wealth Lord  Timon  gloriously con∣founds  Ask'd for a Groat he gives an hundred Pounds  Or if three Ladies like a luckless Play  Takes the whole House upon the Author's Day  Was this any Defect in his Grace's Charac∣ter especialy in a poetical Eye No surely but I suppose Mr  Pope  was angry as he was not a Dramatick Writer that his Grace should bestow any Favour on them  He then proceeds to ridicule his Grace's Library and the Grandeur and Magnifi∣cence of his Improvements  And when up ten steep Slopes you've drag'd your Thighs  Just at his Studydoor he'll bless your Eyes  His Study with what Authors is it stor'd  In Books not Authors curious is my Lord  To all their letter'd Backs he turns you round  These  Aldus  printed these  De Sewel  bound  These Sir are  Elziver  's and those as good  For all his Lordship knows they are but Wood  For  Locke  or  Milton  'tis in vain to look  These Shelves admit not any modern Book  I suppose because he did not find his own Works there he resolved at all Hazards to depreciate his Betters Shall I proceed or have I said enough  To thee who hast not Ear nor Eye nor Soul to comprehend it  And now how dare you to abuse my Husband Why thou poor paultry Gar∣retteer thou starveling Bard if I have a Mind to do it myself what's that to you  The distant  Trojan  never injur'd thee  Pope's Homer  And suppose I've a Mind for to drub  Whose Bones is it Sir I must lick  At whose Expence is it you Scrub  You are not to find me a Stick  Poor Creature and as you say you are in Necessity I hope you will be relieved even by putting together  Figures illpair'd and Similies unlike  Letty  and  Conny  pious precious Pair  I suppose this this is an Allusion to  Nisus  and  Euryalus  but prithee learn more Wit  Than to make illcoupled Hounds  Drag different Ways in miry Grounds  For I am certain I never was a Match for Mrs  Philips  either in Beauty or in Art in both of which she reigns unrivalled and I as in Duty bound give her the Pre∣eminence But  I imagine this  Oxonian  sitting on his Bed  One greasy Stocking round his Head  While t'other he sits down to darn  With Threads of different colour'd Yarn  The Remnants of his last Night's Pot  On Embers plac'd to make it hot  But now if  Wdale  deign to drop  A Slice of Bread or Muttonchop  Mounting he writes and writing sings  While from beneath all  Grubstreet  rings  Swift  Ha have I guessed right thou wicked Scribbler that praisest the Worst best and Best worst thou art just fit to nurture Fools and chronicle Smallbeer  Now to criticize on your wonderful Work In the first Place you say all my Characters are well drawn easy natural and picturesque and yet after this high Compliment that I even made a dull Story entertaining by the Force of a spark∣ling Wit and retentive Memory why presently after I dwindle by the Force of your Pen into a mere Dunce And so though you promised us a Parallel you give us a Contrast you are a very witty Fellow I assure you and deal much in  the Surprizing And so you do not like my Poetry there was no Thought of pleasing you when it was writ but go to my Treasurer tell him I order him to give you three hundred Kicks in private and the Lord send you a b  tter Taste  Heyday the Devil rides on a Fiddle∣stick fresh News arrived all my Letters to  Wrsdle  to be published oh terrible well I hope he will publish every Poem that was inclosed in them that I may come by my own again let him return to me three Operas twentyfive Odes the Let∣ters I wrote for him the Poem which begins  To distant Climes while fond  Cleora  flies  And then he has my full Leave to publish every Letter of mine that he thinks will serve his Purpose but remember that if you and he should sit down and out of your own Loggerheads write Nonsense and offer it to the World as mine I enter my  Caveat  and will not adopt the spurious Issue So here I quit ye and upon mature  Deliberation am sorry I wasted so much Time Paper and Ink on so contemptible a Subject as either of ye  My Lord I beg Pardon for so long di∣gressing from my darling Theme but it was almost impossible for me not to  bestow those Libellers a Lash    For tho' tis hopeless to reclaim them  Scorpion Rods perhaps may tame them  Swift  And though it is not in reality worth while to pursue Grashoppers who die in a Season yet while their Noise offends me I cannot forbear it  And now my Lord and oh since you permit me to call you by that tender Name my Friend and let me add my Guardian Angel for surely very excellent has thy Favour been to me far surpassing that of Kindred as you generously bid me name my Wish to you and obtain it and as I broken with the Storms of Fortune for I may truly say with Holy  David  to my Creator  Even from my Youth up thy Terrors have I suffered with a troubled Mind and thou hast vexed me with all thy Storms  Have little to hope for on this Side Disso∣lution and have no other Concern about parting with a Life which has been but a continual Scene of Sorrow except that of leaving my Son unprovided for Let your Favour extend to him as your Station and Virtue must ever give you a powerful In∣terest use a Portion of it to get him some little Employment or Place which may give him Bread when I no more want it  I flatter myself he will not be entirely unworthy of your Goodness as he is of a generous humane and grateful Dispo∣sition  I must beg your Lordship's Pardon for praising my Son which indeed I should not do but that both his Father and Mr  Ae  endeavoured all in their Power to injure his Character the latter of whom is since convinced he wronged him  And here I must apologize for so long deferring the Publication of this Second Volume and as no Reason is so good as the true one take it as follows  When I came to  Ireland  I took a House near  BowBridge  as well for the Pleasure of a fine Art as to keep retired from busy Tongues but finding it was highly inconvenient to be at such a Distance from Printers Stationers  c  I took a FirstFloor in  AbbeyStreet  and having my own Furniture sent it there with Orders to the Men to put up the Beds which accordingly was done When I came in the Evening to take Possession of my new Habitation be∣hold all my Furniture was torn down and lying in Heaps in the Passage when I demanded the Cause of this I was told the Reverend Dr  Jn Vey  who it seems lodged in the House had by his own special Authority commanded the Goods should be thrown into the Street but the Landlord knowing himself liable to be called to an Account for what he had  received did not chuse to obey him in that Article  Well as my House was empty I knew not where I or my Child could sleep that Night but as I was not illbeloved in the Neighbourhood I left I went back to it where a good Woman gave me part of her Bed and her Husband my Son and two little Children of theirs lay together  Early next Morning my Son took a Lodging for me in  Bigbutterlane  my Goods damaged as they were were carried there but wot you well the Parson fol∣lowed them Dr  Vey  I mean told the People I was a very bad Woman and they were again left in the Passage so when I came there was no Entrance for me and I was obliged to return to the Place from whence I came  Mem  I was forty Shillings out of Pocket by this pious Divine I wish he would pay me  Next Day my Son took a Lodging for me in  Gol enlane  where the Woman no sooner understood I was Dr  Van Lewin  's Daughter who as she said saved her Life but she gladly accepted of me for a Lodger  but what with the Vexation of my Mind and the Cold I had got I fell into a violent Fever and was for many Weeks confined to my Bed till by the Care and Skill of Dr  Ould  I was once more enabled to pur∣sue my Work and as I am much indebted to his Humanity I take this Opportunity of acknowledging it  And now do I expect an Army of Cri∣tics to attack my poor Work and to save them the Trouble I will even do it my∣self altho' I own the Task to be a little un∣grateful But Mrs  Pilkington  notwith∣standing the Regard and Affection which I really have for you I must tell you what the World says of you but however I will give you fair Play and allow you to make the best Defence you can for your∣self Suppose you and I enter into a Dia∣logue I being the Accuser begin Ma∣dam your Story has nothing in it either new or entertaining the Occurrences are common trivial and such as happen every Day your Vanity is intolerable your Stile borrowed from  Milton Shakespear  and  Swift  whom you pretend to describe though you never knew him you tell us a Story of his Beef being overroasted and another of a mangy Dog fine Themes truly for my Part I wonder you ever got a Shilling for your curious Performance I am sure it is a Proof of the Stupidity of the  Boeotians  who tho' they have still done you the Honour to advertise in every Paper that you were not a Dunce proved themselves to be little better for taking so much Notice of you  Myself  Hold hold you charge me so fast you do not give me Leave to reply to your first Article I plead guilty my Story is dull enough it was therefore I strove to embellish it with such poetical Ornaments as I could beg borrow or steal I have known a Gentleman write a  Latin  Poem and every Line of it was borrowed from the Classicks yet this was esteemed a Beauty in him why then should it be deemed a Fault in your humble Servant Had I not an equal Right to make free with  Milton Swift  and  Shakespear  as he had with  Vir∣gil  and  Horace  I  O lud lud why the best Part of your first Volume is that which you wrote from yourself without these Auxiliaries  Myself  Oh upon my Word you com∣pliment now  I  Truly I did not intend it but we would rather have some of your own Stuff  Myself  Why I must bring you a Simile from what I do not much deal in that is Needlework do not Ladies buy coarse Canvass and work thereon Fruits Flowers Trees all Summer and all Autumn's Pride and should we say the Canvas would have been better without the Artist's curi∣ous Embroidery the same will hold in Painting  I  O come do not think to put us off at this Rate you give us Quotation on Quotation why we know the Works of other Writers and expected something en∣tirely new from your superior Pen  Myself  I am sorry it is not in my Power to oblige you but Kings and Prophets who lived before me have declared there was nothing new under the Sun  I  But you shew no Reverence either to Ermin Crape or Lawn  Myself  O I really do when the Wearers deserve them but I hope you would not have me pay Homage to the Things them∣selves Why then I may go and kneel down to all the Goods in the Shops because as the Author of  The Tale of a Tub  says in them we live move and have our Be∣ing  I  But have you no farther Regard to Station Is your licentious Pen to lash all Orders and Degrees of People are you to indulge your laughing and lashing Hu∣mour at every Bodies Expence  Myself  Why sure I have a Right to it have they not laughed and lashed me round This is but a Retaliation they were the first Aggressors no Person who did not deserve a Stripe ever got one from me Is Station a Privilege for doing every Thing Evil with Impunity If so let  Satan  on his burning Throne be honoured  I  Well upon my Word Mrs  Pil∣kington  I am weary of your Arguments you seem resolved to get the better of me and  that  my Readers may always be assured I will do when I am both Plaintiff and Defendant  And I assure my Readers that if my Third Volume is not filled with more sur∣prizing Events and i  finitely more enter∣taining than either of the foregoing I will for ever quit my Magic Art and  Deeper than did ever Plummet sound  I'll drown my Book  Shakespear  END of the SECOND VOLUME
