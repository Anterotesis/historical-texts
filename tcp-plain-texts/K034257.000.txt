 A CHARGE TO THE POETS By WILLIAM WHITEHEAD  Esq  POET LAUREAT  Quasi ex Cathedrâ loquitur  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY at Tully'sHead Pallmall And Sold by J HINXMAN at the Globe in Pater Noster Row MDCCLXII  A CHARGE TO THE POETS  FULL twenty years have roll'd ye rhiming band  Since first I dipp'd in ink my trembling hand  For much it trembled tho' th'obliging few  Who judge with candour prais'd the  "The danger of writing Verse" First printed in the year to which this Poem may be considered as a sequel  sketch I drew  And Echo answering from the public voice  Indulg'd as genius what I fear'd was choice  At length arriv'd at those maturer years  So rarely rais'd by hope or sunk by fears  I rest in peace or scribble if I please  In point of wealth not affluent but at ease  In point of what the world and you call fame  I judge but by conjecture much the same  But whether right or wrong I judge to you  It matters not the following fact is true  From nobler names and great in each degree  The pension'd Laurel has devolv'd to me  To me ye Bards and what you'll scarce conceive  Or at the best unwillingly believe  Howe'er unworthily I wear the crown  Unask'd it came and from a hand unknown  Then since my King and Patron have thought fit  To place me on the throne of modern wit  My grave advice my brethren hear at large  As Bishops to their Clergy give their charge  Tho' many a Priest who listens might afford  Perhaps more solid counsel to my Lord  TO YOU ye guardians of the sacred fount  Deans and Archdeacons of the double mount  That thro' our realms intestine broils may cease  My first and last advice is "Keep the peace"  What is't to you that half the town admire  False sense false strength false softness or false fire  Through heav'n's void concave let the meteors blaze  He hurts his own who wounds another's bays  What is't to you that numbers place your name  First fifth or twentieth in the lists of fame  Old Time will settle all your claims at once  Record the Genius and forget the Dunce  It boots us much to know observers say  Of what materials Nature form'd our clay  From what strange beast Prometheus' plastic art  Purloin'd the particle which rules the heart  If milky softness gliding through the veins  Incline the Muse to panegyric strains  Insipid lays our kindest friends may lull  Be very moral yet be very dull  If bile prevails and temper dictates satire  Our wit is spleen our virtue is illnature  With it's own malice arm'd we combat evil  As zeal for God's sake sometimes plays the devil  O mark it well does Pride affect to reign  The solitary tyrant of the brain  Or Vanity exert her quick'ning flame  Stuck round with ears that listen after fame  O to these points let strict regard be given  Nor  E coelo descendit    Juv  "KNOW THYSELF" in vain descend from Heaven  Do Critics teize youwith a smile I speak  Nor would suppose my brethren were so weak  'Tis on ourselves and not our foes or friends  Our future fame or infamy depends  Let envy point or malice wing the darts  They only wound us in our mortal parts  Besides 'tis much too late to go to school  Grown men will judge by Nature's noblest rule  Admire true beauties and slight faults excuse  Not learn to dance from  This is not intended as a reflection on either the Journals or the Reviews They are not the Masters but the Scholars the Grown Gen∣tlemen at whom the Author smiles and who he thinks had much better not pretend to judge at all than borrow opinions which never sit easy upon them  Journals and Reviews  If fools traduce you and your works decry  As many fools will rate your worth too high  Then ballance the account and fairly take  The cool report which men of judgment make  In writing as in life he foils the foe  Who conscious of his strength forgives the blow  They court the insult who but seem afraid  And then by answering you promote the trade  And give them what their own weak claims deny  A chance for future laughter or a sigh  YOU who as yet unsullied by the Press  Hang o'er your labours in their virgin dress  And YOU who late the public taste have hit  And still enjoy the honeymoon of wit  Attentive hear me grace may still abound  Whoever preaches if the doctrine's sound  If Nature prompts you or if friends persuade  Why write but ne'er pursue it as a trade  And soldom publish manuscripts disarm  The censor's frown and boast an added charm  Enhance their worth by  ming to retire  For what but few can prate of all admire  Who trade in verse alas as rarely find  The public grateful as the Muses kind  From constant feasts like fated guests we steal  And tir'd of tickling lose all power to feel  'Tis novelty we want with that in view  We praise stale matter so the Bard be new  Or from known Bards with exstucy receive  Each part new whim they almost blush to give  A life of writing unless wond'rous short  No wit can brave no genius can support  Some soberer province for your business chuse  Be that your helmet and your plume the Muse  Through Fame's long rubric down from Chaucer's time  Few fortunes have been rais'd by lofty rhime  And when our toils success no longer crowns  What shelter find we from a world in frowns  O'er each distress which vice or folly brings  Tho' Charity extend her healing wings  No Maudlin Hospitals are yet assign'd  For slipshod Muses of the vagrant kind  Where anthems might succeed to satires keen  And hymns of penitence to songs obscene  What refuge then remainswith gracious grin  Some practis'd Bookseller invites you in  Where luckless Bards condemn'd to court the town  Not for their parents' vices but their own  Write gay conundrums with an aching head  Or carn by defamation daily bread  Or friendless shirtless pennyless complain  Not of the world's but "Caelia's cold disdain"  Lords of their workhouse see the tyrants sit  Brokers in books and scockjobbers in wit  Beneath whose lash oblig'd to write or fast  Our confessors and martyrs breathe their last  And can ye bear such insolenceaway  For shame plough dig turn pedlars drive the dray  With minds indignant each employment suits  Our fleets want sailors and our troops recruits  And many a dirty street on Thames's side  Is yet by stool and brush unoccupied  Time was when Poets play'd the thorough game  Swore drank and bluster'd and blasphem'd for fame  The first in brothels with their punk and Muse  Your toast ye Bards "Pamassus and the stews"  Thank Heaven the times are chang'd no Poet now  Need roar for Bacchus or to Venus bow  'Tis our own fault if Fielding's lash  we  feel  Or like French wits begin with the Bastile  Ev'n in those days some few escap'd their fate  By better judgment or a longer date  And rode like buoys triumphant o'er the tide  Poor Otway in an alehouse dos'd and died  While happier Southern tho' with spots of yore  Like Plato's hovering spirits crusted o'er  Liv'd every mortal vapour to remove  And to our admiration join'd our love  Light lie his funeral turffor you who join  His decent manners to his art divine  Would ye whilst round you toss the proud and vain  Convuls'd with feeling or with giving pain  Indulge the Muse in innocence and ease  And tread the flowery path of life in peace  Avoid all authorsWhat th' illus  ious few  Who shunning Fame have taught her to pursue  Fair Virtue's heraldsyes I say again  Avoid all authors 'till you've read the men  Full many a peevish envious slandering elf  Is in his works Benevolence itself  For all mankind unknown his bosom heaves  He only injures those with whom he lives  Read then the Man Does truth his actions guide  Exempt from petulance exempt from pride  To social duties does his heart attend  As Son as Father Husband Brother Friend  Do those who know him love him if they do  You've  my  permission you may love him too  But chief avoid the boist'rous roaring sparks  The sons of fireyou'll know them by their marks  Fond to be heard they always court a croud  And tho' 'tis borrow'd nonsense talk it loud  One epithet supplies their constant chime  Damn'd  bad  damn'd  good  damn'd  low and  damn'd  sublime  But most in quick short repartee they shine  Of local humour or from plays purloin  Each quaint stale scrap which every subject hits  'Till fools almost imagine they are wits  Hear them on Shakespear there they foam they rage  Yet taste not half the beauties of HIS page  Nor see that Art as well as Nature strove  To place HIM foremost in th' Aonian grove  For there there only where the sisters meet  HIS Genius triumphs and the work's compleat  Or would ye sift more near these sons of fire  'Tis Garrick and not Shakespear they admire  Without his breath inspiring every thought  They ne'er perhaps had known what Shakespear wrote  Without his eager his becoming zeal  To teach them tho' they scarce know why to feel  A crude unmeaning mass had Johnson been  And a dead letter Shakespear's noblest seene  O come the time when diffidence again  Shall bind our youth in Nature's modest chain  Born in a happier age and happier clime  Old Sophocles  had  merit in his time  And so no doubt howe'er  we  flout his plays  Had poor Euripides in former days  Not like the moderns we confess but yet  Some seeming faults we surely might forget  Because 'twould puzzle even the wise to show  Whether those faults were real faults or no  To all true merit give it's just applause  The worst have beauties and the best have flaws  Greek French Italian English great or small  I own  my  frailty I admire them all  There are mistaking prejudice for taste  Who on one species all their rapture waste  Tho' various as the flowers which paint the year  In rainbow charms the changeful Nine appear  The different beauties coyly they admit  And to one standard would confine our wit  Some MANNER'D VERSE delights while some can raise  To fairy FICTION their exstatic gaze  Admire PURE POETRY and revel there  On sightless forms and pictures of the air  Some hate all RHIME some  seriously  deplore  That Milton wants that one enchantment more  Tir'd with th' ambiguous tale or antique phrase  O'er Spenser's happiest paintings loveliest lays  Some heedless pass while some with transport view  Each quaint old word which scarce Eliza knew  And eager as the fancied knights prepare  The lance and combat in ideal war  Dragons of lust and giants of despair  Why be it so and what each thinks the test  Let each enjoy but not condemn the rest  Readers there are of every class prepar'd  Each village teems each hamlet has its Bard  Who gives the tone and all th' inferior fry  Like the great vulgar here will join the cry  But be it mine with every Bard to glow  And taste his raptures genuine as they flow  Through all the Muse's wilds to rove along  From plaintive Elegy to Epic song  And if the sense be just the numbers clear  And the true colouring of the work be there  Again subdued by Truth's ingenuous call  I own  my  frailty I admire them all  Nor think I with the mob that Nature now  No longer warms the soil where laurels grow  'Tis true Our Poets in repose delight  And wiser than their fathers seldom write  Yet I but I forbear for prudent ends  Could name a list and half of them  my  friends  For whom posterity it's wreaths shall twine  And it's own Bards neglect to honour mine  Their Poets in their turn will grieve and swear  Perhaps with truth no Patron lends an ear  Complaints of times when merit wants reward  Descend like similies from Bard to Bard  We copy our distress from Greece and Rome  As in our Northern lays their flowrets bloom  We feel their breezes with their heats we burn  And plead prescription to rejoice or mourn  All present times are bad then cast your eyes  Where fairy scenes of bliss in prospect rise  As fond enthusiasts o'er the western main  With eager ken prophetical in vain  See the mixt multitudes from every land  Grow pure by blending virtuous by command  'Till phoenixlike a new bright world of gold  Springs from the dregs and refuse of the old  I'm no enthusiast yet with joy can trace  Some gleams of sunshine for the tuneful race  If Monarchs listen when the Muses woo  Attention wakes and nations listen too  The Bard grows rapturous who was dumb before  And every freshplum'd eagle learns to soar  Friend of the siner arts when Aegypt saw  Her second Ptolemy give Science law  Each Genius waken'd from his dead repose  The column swell'd the pile majestic rose  Exact proportion borrow'd strength from ease  And use was taught by elegance to please  Along the breathing walls as fancy flow'd  The sculpture soften'd and the picture glow'd  Heroes reviv'd in animated stone  The groves grew vocal and the  The Seven Poets patronised by Ptolemy Philadelphus are usually called by the name of that constellation  Pleiads shone  Old Nilus rais'd his head and wond'ring cried  Long live the King my Patron and my Pride  Secure of endless praise behold I bear  My grateful suffrage to my Sovereign's ear  Tho' war shall rage tho' Time shall level all  Yon colours sicken and yon columns fall  Tho' art's dear treasures feed the wasting flame  And the proud volume sinks an empty name  Tho' Plenty may desert this copious vale  My streams be scatter'd or my fountain fail  Yet Ptolemy has liv'd the world has known  A King of arts a Patron on a throne  Ev'n utmost Britain shall his name adore  "And Boyn be sung when it has ceas'd to flow" Addison  "And Nile be sung when Nile shall flow no more"  One rule remains Nor shun nor court the great  Your truest center is that middle state  From whence with case th' observing eye may go  To all which soars above or sinks below  'Tis yours all manners to have tried or known  T' adopt all virtues yet retain your own  To stem the tide where thoughtless crowds are hurl'd  The firm spectators of a bustling world  Thus arm'd proceed the breezes court your wing  Go range all Helicon taste every spring  From varying nature cull th'innoxious spoil  And whilst amusement sooths the generous toil  Let puzzled Critics with judicious spite  Descant on what you can or can not write  True to yourselves not anxious for renown  Nor court the world's applause nor dread it's frown  Guard your own breasts and be the bulwark there  To know no envy and no malice fear  At least you'll find thus Stoiclike prepar'd  That Verse and Virtue are their own reward  THE END
