 THE GHOST BY THE AUTHOR  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR and Sold by WILLIAM FLEXNEY near Gray'sInn Gate Holborn MDCCLXII  THE GHOST  _WITH eager search to dart the soul  Curiously vain from Pole to Pole  And from the Planets wand'ring spheres  T'extort the number of our years  And whether all those years shall flow  Serenely smooth and free from woe  Or rude Misfortune shall deform  Our life with one continual storm  Or if the Scene shall motley be  Alternate Joy and Misery  Is a desire which more or less  All men must feel tho' few confess  HENCE ev'ry place and ev'ry age  Affords subsistence to the Sage  Who free from this world and it's cares  Holds an acquaintance with the Stars  From whom he gains intelligence  Of things to come some ages hence  Which unto friends at easy rates  He readily communicates  AT its first rise which all agree on  This noble Science was CHALDEAN  That antient people as they fed  Their flocks upon the Mountain's head  Gaz'd on the Stars observ'd their motions  And suck'd in Astrologic notions  Which they so eagerly pursue  As folks are apt whate'er is new  That things below at random rove  Whilst they're consulting things above  And when they now so poor were grown  That they'd no houses of their own  They made bold with their friends the Stars  And prudently made use of their's  TO EGYPT from CHALDEE it travell'd  And Fate at MEMPHIS was unravell'd  Th' exotic Science soon struck root  And flourish'd into high repute  Each learned Priest O strange to tell  Could circles make and cast a spell  Could read and write and taught the Nation  The holy art of Divination  Nobles themselves for at that time  Knowledge in Nobles was no crime  Could talk as learned as the Priest  And prophesie as much at least  Hence all the fortunetelling Crew  Whose crafty skill mars Nature's hue  Who in vile tatters with smirck'd face  Run up and down from place to place  To gratify their friends' desires  From BAMPFIELD CAREW to MOLL SQUIRES  Are rightly term'd EGYPTIANS all  Whom we mistaking GYPSIES call  THE GRECIAN Sages borrow'd this  As they did other Sciences  From fertile EYGPT tho' the loan  They had not honesty to own  DODONA's Oaks inspir'd by JOVE  A learned and prophetic Grove  Turn'd vegetable Necromancers  And to all comers gave their answers  At DELPHOS to APOLLO dear  All men the voice of Fate might hear  Each subtle Priest on threelegg'd stool  To take in wise men play'd the fool  A Mystery so made for gain  E'en now in fashion must remain  Enthusiasts never will let drop  What brings such business to their shop  And that Great Saint we WHTFLD call  Keeps up the HUMBUG SPIRITUAL  AMONG the ROMANS not a Bird  Without a Prophecy was heard  Fortunes of Empires often hung  On the Magician Magpye's tongue  And ev'ry Crow was to the State  A sure interpreter of Fate  Prophets embodied in a College  Time out of mind your seat of knowledge  For Genius never fruit can bear  Unless it first is planted there  And solid Learning never falls  Without the verge of College walls  Infallible accounts would keep  When it was best to watch or sleep  To eat or drink to go or stay  And when to fight or run away  When matters were for action ripe  By looking at a  double tripe    When Emperors would live or die  They in an  Ass's scull  could spy  When Gen'rals would their station keep  Or turn their backs in  hearts  of  sheep    In matters whether small or great  In private families or state  As amongst us the holy Seer  Officiously would interfere  With pious arts and rev'rend skill  Would bend Lay Bigots to his will  Would help or injure foes or friends  Just as it serv'd his private ends  Whether in honest way of trade  Traps for Virginity were laid  Or if to make their party great  Designs were form'd against the State  Regardless of the Common Weal  By Int'rest led which they call zeal  Into the scale was always thrown  The will of Heav'n to back  their own    ENGLAND a happy land we know  Where Follies naturally grow  Where without Culture they arise  And tow'r above the common size  ENGLAND a fortunetelling host  As num'rous as the Stars could boast  MATRONS who toss the Cup and see  The grounds of Fate in grounds of Tea  Who vers'd in ev'ry modest lore  Can a lost Maidenhead restore  Or if their Pupils rather chuse it  Can shew the readiest way to lose it  GYPSIES who ev'ry ill can cure  Except the ill of being poor  Who charms 'gainst Love and Agues sell  Who can in Henroost set a spell  Prepar'd by arts to them best known  To catch all feet except their own  Who as to Fortune can unlock it  As easily as pick a pocket  SCOTCHMEN who in their Country's right  Possess the gift of  secondsight    Who when their barren heaths they quit  Sure argument of  prudent  wit  Which reputation to maintain  They never venture back again  By lies prophetic heap up riches  And boast the luxury of breeches  AMONG the rest in former years  CAMPBELL illustrious name appears  Great Heroe of futurity  Who  blind  could ev'ry thing  foresee    Who  dumb  could ev'ry thing  foretel    Who Fate with equity to sell  Always dealt out the will of Heaven  According to what price was given  OF SCOTTISH race in HIGHLANDS born  Possess'd with native pride and scorn  He hither came by custom led  To curse the hands which gave him bread  With want of truth and want of sense  Amply made up by impudence  A  succedaneum  which we find  In common use with all mankind  Caress'd and favour'd too by those  Whose heart with Patriot feelings glows  Who FOOLISHLY where'er dispers'd  Still place their native Country first  For ENGLISHMEN alone have sense  To give a  stranger  preference  Whilst modest merit of their own  Is left in poverty to groan  CAMPBELL foretold just what he wou'd  And left the Stars to make it good  On whom he had impress'd such awe  His dictates current pass'd for LAW  Submissive all his Empire own'd  No Star durst smile when CAMPBELL frown'd  THIS Sage deceas'd for all must die  And CAMPBELL's no more safe than I  No more than I can guard the heart  When Death shall hurl the fatal dart  Succeeded ripe in art and years  Another  fav'rite of the spheres  Another  and  Another  came  Of equal skill and equal fame  As white each wand as black each gown  As long each beard as wise each frown  In ev'ry thing so like you'd swear  CAMPBELL himself was sitting there  To  all  the happy Art was known  To tell  our  fortunes make  their own    SEATED in Garret for you know  The nearer to the Stars we go  The greater we esteem his art  Fools curious flock'd from ev'ry part  The Rich the Poor the Maid the Married  And those who could not walk were carried  THE BUTLER hanging down his head  By  ChamberMaid  or  CookMaid  led  Enquires if from his friend the Moon  He has advice of pilfer'd spoon  THE COURTBRED WOMAN OF CONDITION  Who to approve her disposition  As much superior as her birth  To those compos'd of common earth  With double spirit must engage  In ev'ry folly of the age  The  honourable  arts would buy  To pack the Cards and cog a Die  THE PARSON too for now and then  PARSONS are just like other men  And here and there a  grave  DIVINE  Has Passions such as yours and mine  Burning with  holy  lust to know  When FATE Preferment will bestow  'Fraid of detection not of sin  With circumspection sneaking in  To  Conj'rer  as he does to  Whore    Thro' some bye Alley or Backdoor  With the same caution  Orthodox    Consults the  Stars  and gets a  Pox    THE CITIZEN in fraud grown old  Who knows no Deity but Gold  Worn out and gasping now for breath  A Med'cine wants to keep off Death  Would know if THAT he cannot have  What Coins are current in the grave  If when the Stocks which by  his  pow'r  Would rise or fall in half an hour  For tho' unthought of and unseen  He work'd the springs behind the screen  By  his  directions came about  And rose to  Par  he should sell out  Whether he safely might or no  Replace it in the Funds  below    BY all address'd believ'd and paid  Many pursu'd the thriving trade  And great in reputation grown  Successive held the MAGIC throne  Favour'd by ev'ry darling passion  The love of Novelty and Fashion  Ambition Av'rice Lust and Pride  Riches pour'd in on ev'ry side  But when the prudent Laws thought fit  To curb this insolence of Wit  When Senates wisely had Provided  Decreed Enacted and Decided  That no such vile and upstart elves  Should have more knowledge than themselves  When Fines and Penalties were laid  To stop the progress of the trade  And Stars no longer could dispense  With  honour  farther influence  And Wizards which must be confest  Was of more force than all the rest  No certain way to tell had got  Which were Informers and which not  Affrighted SAGES were perforce  Oblig'd to steer some other course  By various ways these  Sons of Chance    Their Fortunes labour'd to advance  Wellknowing by unerring rules  KNAVES starve not in the  Land of Fools    SOME with high Titles and Degrees  Which wise Men borrow when they please  Without or trouble or expence  PHYSICIANS instantly commence  And proudly boast an equal skill  With those who claim the  right  to  kill    OTHERS about the Countries roam  For not ONE thought of going  home    With pistol and adopted leg  Prepar'd at once to rob or beg  SOME the more subtle of their race  Who felt some touch of  Coward  Grace  Who TYBURN to avoid had wit  But never fear'd deserving it  Came to their  Brother  SMLLT's aid  And carried on the CRITIC trade  ATTACH'D to Letters and the Muse  Some  Verses wrote and  some  wrote News  Those  each revolving Month are seen  The Heroes of a  Magazine    These  ev'ry morning great appear  In LEDGER or in GAZETTEER  Spreading the falshood of the day  By turns for FDN and for SY  Like SWISS their force is always laid  On that side where they best are paid  Hence mighty PRODIGIES arise  And daily MONSTERS strike our eyes  Wonders  to propagate the trade  More strange than ever BAKER made  Are hawk'd about from street to street  And Fools believe whilst Liars eat  Now armies in the Air engage  To fright a superstitious age  Now Comets thro' the Aether range  In Governments portending change  Now Rivers to the Ocean fly  So quick they leave their channels dry  Now monstrous Whales on LAMBETH shore  Drink the THAMES dry and thirst for more  And ev'ry now and then appears  An IRISH Savage numb'ring years  More than those happy Sages cou'd  Who drew their breath before the flood  Now to the wonder of all people  A  Church  is left without a  Steeple    A  Steeple  now is left in lurch  And mourns departure of the  Church    Which borne on wings of mighty wind  Remov'd a furlong off we find  Now wrath on Cattle to discharge  Hail stones as deadly fall and large  As those which were on EGYPT sent  At once their crime and punishment  Or those which as the Prophet writes  Fell on the necks of AMORITES  When struck with wonder and amaze  The  Sun  suspended stay'd to gaze  And from her duty longer kept  In AJALON his  Sister  slept  BUT if such things no more engage  The Taste of a politer age  To help them out in time of need  Another  TOFFS must  Rabbits  breed  Each pregnant Female trembling hears  And overcome with spleen and fears  Consults her faithful glass no more  But madly bounding o'er the floor  Feels hairs all o'er her body grow  By FANCY turn'd into a  Doe    Now to promote their private ends  NATURE her usual course suspends  And varies from the stated plan  Observ'd e'er since the World began  Bodies  which foolishly we thought  By Custom's servile maxims taught  Needed a regular supply  And without nourishment must die  With craving appetites and sense  Of Hunger easily dispense  And pliant to  their  wond'rous skill  Are taught like  watches  to stand still  Uninjur'd  for a month or more  Then  go on as they did before  The Novel takes the Tale succeeds  Amply supplies its author's needs  And BETTY CANNING is at least  With GASCOYNE's help a six months feast  WHILST in contempt of all our pains  The Tyrant SUPERSTITION reigns  Imperious in the heart of Man  And warps his thoughts from Nature's plan  Whilst fond CREDULITY who ne'er  The weight of wholesome doubts could bear  To Reason and Herself unjust  Takes all things blindly up on trust  Whilst CURIOSITY whose rage  No Mercy shews to Sex or Age  Must be indulg'd at the expence  Of  Judgment Truth  and  Common Sense    Impostures cannot but prevail  And when  old Miracles  grow stale  JUGGLERS will still the art pursue  And entertain the World with  New    FOR THEM obedient to their will  And trembling at their mighty skill  Sad SPIRITS summon'd from the tomb  Glide ghastly glaring thro' the gloom  In all the usual Pomp of storms  In horrid customary forms  A Wolf a Bear a Horse an Ape  As Fear and Fancy give them shape  Tormented with despair and pain  They roar they yell and clank the chain  FOLLY and GUILT for GUILT howe'er  The face of Courage it may wear  Is still a Coward at the heart  At fearcreated phantoms start  The PRIEST that very word implies  That he's both innocent and wise  Yet fears to travel in the dark  Unless escorted by his CLERK  BUT let not ev'ry Bungler deem  Too lightly of so deep a scheme  For reputation of the  Art    Each GHOST must act a proper part  Observe  Decorum's  needful grace  And keep the laws of  Time  and  Place    Must change with happy variation  His manners with his situation  What in the Country might pass down  Would be impertinent in Town  No SPIRIT of  discretion  HERE  Can think of breeding awe and fear  'Twill serve the purpose more by half  To make the Congregation laugh  We  want no ensigns of surprize  Locks stiff with gore and sawcer eyes  Give  us  an entertaining  Sprite    Gentle Familiar and Polite  One who appears in such a form  As might an holy Hermit warm  Or who on former schemes refines  And only talks by sounds and signs  Who will not to the eye appear  But pays her visit to the ear  And knocks so gently 'twould not fright  A Lady in the darkest Night  Such  is  Our  FANNY whose good will  Which cannot in the Grave lie still  Brings her on Earth to entertain  Her Friends and Lovers in COCKLANE  END OF THE FIRST BOOK  THE GHOST BOOK II  _A SACRED standard Rule we find  By Poets held time out of mind  To offer at APOLLO's shrine  And call on One or All the NINE  THIS Custom thro' a  Bigot  zeal  Which MODERNS of  fine Taste  must feel  For those who wrote in days of yore  Adopted stands like many more  Tho' ev'ry Cause which then conspir'd  To make it practis'd and admir'd  Yielding to Time's destructive course  For ages past hath lost its force  WITH  antient  Bards an INVOCATION  Was a true act of Adoration  Of Worship an essential part  And not a formal piece of Art  Of paultry reading a Parade  A dull Solemnity in trade  A pious Fever taught to burn  An hour or two to serve a turn  THEY talk'd not of CASTALIAN SPRINGS  By way of saying  pretty things    As  we  dress out our flimsy Rhimes  'Twas the RELIGION of the  Times    And they believ'd that  holy  stream  With greater force made FANCY teem  Reckon'd by all a true specific  To make the barren brain prolific  Thus  ROMISH CHURCH a scheme which bears  Not half so much excuse as theirs  Since FAITH  implicitly  hath taught her  Reveres the force of  Holy Water    THE PAGAN SYSTEM whether true  Or false its strength like  Buildings  drew  From many parts dispos'd to bear  In one great Whole their proper share  Each GOD of  eminent  degree  To some vast  Beam  compar'd might be  Each GODLING was a  Peg  or rather  A  Cramp  to keep the  Beams  together  And Man as safely might pretend  From JOVE the  thunderbolt  to rend  As with an impious pride aspire  To rob APOLLO of his  Lyre    WITH settled faith and pious awe  Establish'd by the voice of Law  Then  POETS to the MUSES came  And from their Altars caught the flame  GENIUS with PHOEBUS for his guide  The MUSE ascending by his side  With tow'ring pinions dar'd to soar  Where  Eye  could scarcely strain before  BUT why should WE who cannot feel  These glowings of a  Pagan  zeal  That wild  enthusiastic  force  By which above her common course  NATURE in  Exstasy  upborne  Look'd down on earthly things with scorn  Who  have no more regard 'tis known  For  their  Religion than  our own    And feel not half so fierce a flame  At CLIO's as at FISHER's name  Who  know these boasted  sacred streams  Were mere romantic idle dreams  That THAMES has waters clear as those  Which on the top of PINDUS rose  And that the FANCY to refine  Water's not half so good as Wine  Who  know if Profit strikes our eye  Should we drink HELICON quite dry  Th' whole fountain would not thither lead  So soon as one poor jug from TWEED  Who  if to raise poetic fire  The Pow'r of  Beauty  we require  In any public place can view  More than the GRECIANS ever knew  If  Wit  into the scale is thrown  Can boast a LENOX of our own  Why should  we  servile customs chuse  And court an  antiquated Muse  No matter why to ask a  Reason  In PEDANT BIGOTRY is Treason  IN the broad beaten turnpikeroad  Of  hackney'd Panegyric Ode    No  Modern Poet  dares to ride  Without APOLLO by his side  Nor in a  Sonnet  take the air  Unless his  Lady Muse  be there  SHE from some  Amaranthine  grove  Where little Loves and Graces rove  The Laurel to  my Lord  must bear  Or Garlands make for  Whores  to wear  SHE with soft  Elegeiac  verse  Must grace some  mighty Villain's  hearse  Or for some  Infant  doom'd by Fate  To wallow in a large estate  With Rhimes the Cradle must adorn  To tell the World a  Fool  is born  SINCE then our CRITIC LORDS expect  No hardy Poet should reject  Establish'd maxims or presume  To place much better in their room  By Nature fearful I submit  And in this dearth of Sense and Wit  With  nothing done  and  little said    By wild excursive FANCY led  Into a second Book thus far  Like some unwary  Traveller    Whom varied scenes of wood and lawn  With treacherous delight have drawn  Deluded from his purpos'd way  Whom ev'ry step leads more astray  Who gazing round can no where spy  Or house or friendly cottage nigh  And resolution seems to lack  To venture forward or go back  Invoke some GODDESS to descend  And help me to my journey's end  Tho' conscious all the while  Hears the petition with a smile  Before the glass her charms unfolds  And in  herself  MY  Muse  beholds  TRUTH GODDESS of celestial birth  But little lov'd or known on earth  Whose pow'r but seldom rules the heart  Whose name with hypocritic art  An errant stalking horse is made  A snug pretence to drive a trade  An instrument convenient grown  To plant more firmly FALSHOOD's throne  As Rebels varnish o'er their cause  With specious colouring of Laws  And  pious  Traitors draw the knife  In the KING's  Name  against his  life    Whether from  Cities  far away  Where  Fraud  and  Falshood  scorn thy sway  The faithful Nymph's and Shepherd's pride  With LOVE and VIRTUE by thy side  Your hours in harmless joys are spent  Amongst the Children of CONTENT  Or fond of gaiety and sport  You tread the round of ENGLAND's COURT  Howe'er my LORD may frowning go  And treat the  Stranger  as a  Foe    Sure to be found a welcome guest  In GEORGE's and in CHARLOTTE's breast  If in the giddy hours of Youth  My constant Soul adher'd to TRUTH  If from the Time I first wrote Man  I still pursued thy sacred plan  Tempted by Interest in vain  To wear mean Falshood's golden chain  If for a season drawn away  Starting from Virtue's path astray  All low disguise I scorn'd to try  And dar'd to sin but not to lie  Hither O hither condescend  ETERNAL TRUTH thy steps to bend  And favour  Him  who ev'ry hour  Confesses and obeys thy pow'r  BUT come not with that easy mien  By which you won the  lively  DEAN  Nor yet assume that Strumpet air  Which RABELAIS taught Thee first to wear  Nor yet that arch ambiguous face  Which with CERVANTES gave thee grace  But come in sacred vesture clad  Solemnly dull and truly sad  FAR from thy seemly Matron train  Be Idiot MIRTH and LAUGHTER vain  For WIT and HUMOUR which pretend  At once to please us and amend  They  are not for my present turn  Let them remain in  France  with STERNE  OF Noblest  City Parents  born  Whom Wealth and Dignities adorn  Who still one constant tenor keep  Not quite awake nor quite asleep  With THEE let formal DULNESS come  And deep ATTENTION ever dumb  Who on her lips her fingers lays  Whilst every circumstance she weighs  Whose downcast Eye is often found  Bent without motion to the ground  Or to some outward thing confin'd  Remits no image to the mind  No pregnant mark of meaning bears  But stupid without Vision stares  Thy steps let GRAVITY attend  Wisdom's  and  Truth's  unerring friend  For  One  may see with half an eye  That GRAVITY can never lie  And his arch'd brow pull'd o'er his eyes  With solemn proof proclaims him  Wise    FREE from all waggeries and sports  The produce of luxurious  Courts    Where Sloth and Lust enervate Youth  Come  Thou  a downright  City  TRUTH  The CITY which we ever find  A sober pattern for Mankind  Where  Man  in EQUILIBRIO hung  Is seldom Old and never Young  And from the Cradle to the Grave  Not Virtue's friend nor Vice's slave  As  Dancers  on the  Wire  we spy  Hanging between the Earth and Sky  SHE comes I see her from afar  Bending her course to  TempleBar  All sage and silent is her train  Deportment grave and garments plain  Such as may suit a  Parson's  wear  And fit the Headpiece of a  Mayor    BY TRUTH inspir'd  our  BACON'S force  Open'd the way to Learning's source  BOYLE thro' the works of NATURE ran  And NEWTON something more than man  Div'd into Nature's hidden springs  Laid bare the principles of things  Above the earth our spirits bore  And gave us Worlds unknown before  By TRUTH inspir'd when  Lauder  's spight  O'er MILTON cast the Veil of Night  DOUGLAS arose and thro' the maze  Of intricate and winding ways  Came where the subtle Traitor lay  And dragg'd him trembling to the day  Whilst HE O shame to noblest parts  Dishonour to the Lib'ral Arts  To traffic in so vile a scheme  Whilst HE  our Letter'd  POLYPHEME  Who had  Confed'rate  forces join'd  Like a base Coward skulk'd behind  By TRUTH inspir'd our  Critics  go  To track FINGAL in  Highland  snow  To form their own and others  Creed  From  Manuscripts  they cannot read  By TRUTH inspir'd we numbers see  Of each Profession and Degree  Gentle and Simple Lord and Cit  Wit without wealth wealth without wit  When PUNCH and SHERIDAN have done  To FANNY's  Ghostly Lectures  run  By TRUTH and FANNY now inspir'd  I feel my glowing bosom fir'd  Desire beats high in ev'ry vein  To sing the SPIRIT of COCKLANE  To tell just as the measure flows  In halting rhime half verse half prose  With more than mortal arts endued  How  She  united force withstood  And proudly gave a brave defiance  To  Wit  and  Dulness  in Alliance  THIS  APPARITION  with relation  To antient modes of  Derivation    This  we may properly so call  Although it ne'er appears at all  As by the way of  Inuendo    Lucus  is made  à non lucendo  Superior to
