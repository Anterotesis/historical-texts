 PHILANDER  A DRAMATIC PASTORAL  By the AUTHOR of the FEMALE QUIXOTE  LONDON Printed for A MILLAR in the Strand MDCCLVIII  Price ONE SHILLING  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD VISCOUNT CHARLEMONT  MY LORD  IT is generally expected that there should be some relation between the character of the patron and the nature of the work for which protection is solicited  BUT this law like many others is broken when it opposes the gratification of passions too strong for the restraints of regularity Ambition which often overpowers the judgment in questions of more importance has made me forget the disproportion between Your Lordship's name and a Dramatic Pastoral and I have ventured to lay before You a composition of little dignity in the design and perhaps of little elegance in the execution  YET for whatever we resolve we labour to find reasons  till in time we forget its impropriety I begin to hope that by offering to Your Lordship a performance of an airy and luxuriant kind which can at best hope only for excuse I expose myself less to the imputation of arrogance than if I had prefixed Your name to a piece more grave and oftentatious which might have been suspected of pretending to approbation  I am my Lord far from imagining that any of my ideas can be new to Your extensive knowledge or that I have attained any beauties of style or  sentiment adequate to Your delicacy of taste The merit of this Poem is but small in my own opinion and yet of the little praise which it may receive I must resign a part by confessing that the first hint was taken from the PASTOR FIDO and that the two songs marked with asterisks  See page and  were written by another hand  WHATEVER praise this confession may detract from my abilities it will add to my sincerity and I should discover little knowledge of Your Lordship if I should endeavour to  recommend myself rather by elevation of genius than by purity of manners  I am with great respect MY LORD Your Lordship's Most obliged Humble servant CHARLOTTE LENNOX  LONDON  Nov  PERSONS of the DRAMA  MONTANO Priest of  Apollo  PHILANDER his son in love with  Sylvia  THIRSIS his friend  SATYR  SYLVIA a huntress betrothed to  Philander  NERINA her friend  NYMPHS and SATYRS  SCENE ARCADIA  PHILANDER  ACT I  SCENE  An open plain with the prospect of a wood at a distance  Enter SYLVIA NERINA following  NERINA  _YOU shun me then my  Sylvia  SYLVIA  No my friend  Not you 'tis the fond voice of love I shun  Chuse any other theme and I will listen  Still as the night when not a zephyr stirs  The trembling leaves  NERINA  And why not talk of love  While that soft bloom glows on thy beauteous cheek  While thy eyes dart their undiminish'd rays  And every feature smiles with rosy youth  Youth the fit season for delight and joy  Ah trifler waste not thus the fleeting hours  The spring of life knows no return and age  The ceaseless winter of the human frame  Steals silent on to blast thy flow'ry prime  SONG  Ah waste not thus thy flow'ry prime  The vernal season of delight  Youth flies upon the wings of time  And age and winter are in sight  SYLVIA  Then let me seize each minute as it flies  Consume in varied sports the blissful day  Rise with the dawn and join the virgin train  Bound o'er the dewy vale dislodge the deer  Pursue with flying pace the nimble doe  And with the savage wage a distant war  NERINA  Ah foolish nymph begin the war at home  Within thy charming breast the savage lies  Covert too sweet for such a dang'rous foe  SONG  Would'st thou a greater monster quell  Than all our teeming woods e'er bore  Subdue thy pride that foe repel  And yield to love's persuasive lore  SYLVIA  Thee chaste  Diana  all my wishes claim  By choice thy vot'ry my whole life is thine  SONG  Oh goddess of the Sylvan reign  Where peace where innocence abide  My freedom is to wear thy chain  In serving thee my noblest pride  NERINA  Thy infantvows to young  Philander  given  Thou stand'st excluded from the virgin choir  SYLVIA  Philander  was my parent's choice not mine  My heart subscrib'd not to th' unhallow'd vow  That pass'd my infant lips urge it no more  NERINA  Montano  's heir  Montano Phoebus  ' priest  Dear to his patrongod and blest with wealth  Where could your choice have fix'd had it been free  But on your destin'd spouse  Arcadia  's boast  The secret wish of every blooming maid  SYLVIA  Take him who will this allaccomplish'd youth  My part in him I quit and sweet exchange  Be freedom mine mine the enchanting joys  These woods and forests yield this wellstrung bow  This sounding quiver pure delights supply  Be but my arrows fleet and just their aim  And I have all my wish  NERINA  Take heed fond maid  For love has arrows fleeter far and oh  More deadly too if pointed with despair  SONG  Think what the hapless virgin proves  Who loves in vain yet fondly loves  While modesty and female pride  The slighted passion seek to hide  For oh in vain the sigh's represt  That struggling heaves her anxious breast  In vain the falling tear's withheld  The conscious wish in vain repell'd  Her faded cheek and air forlorn  Coarse jests invite and cruel scorn  To hopeless love she falls a prey  And wastes in silent grief away  SYLVIA  With her own coldness  Cynthia  guards my breast  And the soft god can find no entrance there  SONG  Ye gentlybreathing zephyrs say  If as your airy course yon fly  Did you e'er meet with one so gay  So happy or so free as I  Ye softlymurm'ring streams declare  If on your banks you ever knew  A maid who own'd so little care  A heart to liberty so true  NERINA  Yet dread the anger of avenging gods  For broken vows and violated faith  SYLVIA  The gods are just they form'd me what I am  Cold and disdainful of the nuptial tye  They will not punish faults themselves have caus'd  But while forgetful of the promis'd chace  With thee the moments idly thus I waste  A bevy of bright nymphs already met  In yonder grove of oaks expect my coming  This day we hunt the stag  SONG  Celestial huntress deign to grace  Our sports and bless the morning chace  The goddess comes she comes and lo  I see her silverbeaming bow  I hear her rattling quiver sound  Her nymphs with chearful shoutings fill the place  And the glad echos from the hills rebound  Going  PHILANDER  meets her  PHILANDER  One moment stay  SYLVIA  Detain me not the morning wears apace  The nymphs expect me to the promis'd chace  PHILANDER  Ah quit the  Sylvan  war the hunter's toils  Love nobler trophies yields and sweeter spoils  Beauty like your's should these rough sports despise  Nor with your arrows conquer but your eyes  SYLVIA  Beauty's short conquests soon to bondage turn  The vanquish'd triumph and the victors mourn  With haughty sway his empire Love maintains  And all are vassals where a tyrant reigns  PHILANDER  Yet his soft power even gods themselves confess  'Tis his to conquer but 'tis his to bless  Then yield thee beauteous nymph and thou shalt prove  How faint all joys compar'd to mutual love  SYLVIA  Away presumptuous taint not my chaste car  With sounds  Diana  's handmaid must not hear  Hate ever be my part be thine despair  Away presumptuous and thy suit forbear  PHILANDER  SONG  Yes cruel maid I go to prove  The last sad effort of despair  One death shall this lost wretch remove  And thousands from thy scorn shall spare  Yet shall thy image bless my closing eye  And my last breath thy still lov'd name shall sigh  Exeunt  NERINA  Oh cruelty extreme ungrateful maid  Thus is it thus that faithful love is paid  SYLVIA  Cease chiding now my savage lover comes  The rude rough  Satyr  ah he's here already  Enter the SATYR  Ah  Sylvia  whither whither dost thou fly  Turn cruel maid too lovely  Sylvia  turn  Oh fairer than the fairest lillies thou  Erect and tall as alders thy soft skin  More sleek than orient shells and whiter far  Than falling snows turn turn thy starry eyes  And bless thy lover with their beauteous rays  SYLVIA  Great terror of these woods ah why on me  This lavish praise know thy own worth and woo  Some nymph if such there be whose wondrous form  Is lovely as thy own  SATYR  Insulting maid  This form despis'd by thee wants not its charms  If in the liquid mirror of the sea  I view myself aright this face of mine  A sanguine colour boasts these shaggy limbs  For strength and swiftness form'd and manly grace  SYLVIA  If charms like these want pow'r to gain my love  Blame my dull eyes and my still duller mind  SATYR  To charm those eyes the aid of art I'll try  To move that mind the force of gifts I'll prove  A pair of turtles callow from the nest  Court the soft soothings of thy lillyhand  Oh learn of them to love and pay my pains  SONG  Doves are  Venus'  birds and bear  Her chariot through the yielding air  Cupid  with their feathers wings  Those darts th' unerring archer flings  Yet his soft rage the wantons prove  And all their little life is love  SYLVIA  Melodious strains indeed your music  Satyr  Nought equals but your verse  SATYR  Do my songs please thee stay then and behold  A vintage measure and my skill applaud  As in the harmonious maze I lightly move  Here on the verdant turf recline while I  Summon my fellows to the antic round  Enter SATYRS  Ye dear companions of my rural joys  This paragon of nymphs this conquering fair  Deigns to behold our sports begin and shew  That  Satyrs  have their graces and can tread  With  Bacchanalian  skill the sprightly dance  Begin I say  SYLVIA  This lawless rout with terror chills my heart  Seize the first happy moment to retire    To  NERINA  DANCE of the SATYRS  Sylvia  and  Nerina  steal off when it is almost ended  SATYR  Ha gone break off the dance  She is not here whose eyes I sought to charm  Ah cruel nymph inexorable fair  Harder than tygers to be broke than rocks  More fix'd in thy disdain more haughty far  Than the vain peacock in its plumy pride  Why seek I thee with song and dance to move  Colder than fountains like the sliding streams  Impossible to hold but here I swear  By  Pan  great author of our race I swear  Since song nor dance nor gifts nor pray'rs can move  Thy stubborn soul by force I'll crown my love  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT the SECOND  SCENE  continues  Enter SYLVIA and NYMPHS as from hunting with bows and arrows  First NYMPH  GRace of our woods sure  Dian  's self directs  Thy still unerring dart  SYLVIA  Be her's the praise  Oh virgin huntress to thy fav'ring smile  Alone I owe that foremost in the chace  My shaft transfixes first the trembling prey  Thou speed'st the whistling arrow to its mark  Wing'd with thy swiftness o'er the plain I fly  And all my honours are deriv'd from thee  SONG  Cynthia  queen of rural pleasures  Pleasures which no guilt destroys  Thine are all health's choicest treasures  Thine are virtue's solid joys  Here the  Satyr  appears listening  SYLVIA  Now while the sun darts fierce the noontide blaze  Haste to the neighb'ring grove fair nymphs and shun  His fervid ray mean time in yonder vale  Where pines and cedars mingling grateful shade  And from the stream which slowly glides beneath  Excludes the light there will I bathe then taste  A short repose upon its flow'ry border  First NYMPH  Soft be thy slumbers gentle maid farewel  Exeunt  The  SATYR  comes forward  SATYR  So my coy  Nymph  I think I hold thee now  Safe in my toils go on securely go  To thy wellchosen privacy by  Pan  It fits my purpose well yes stubborn maid  There shalt thou find an unexpected guest  An injur'd lover bent on great revenge  SONG  I hate your sighing fawning lying  To cry each moment one is dying  In some sick puppy's tone  No while her pride looks most demurely  Let me invading clasp securely  What force has made my own  Exeunt  Satyr  Enter PHILANDER in a melancholy posture  PHILANDER  SONG  In vain I strive to fly  This soulconsuming care  My sorrow's always nigh  And present every where  In vain I seek the grove  There no repose I find  What shades can shut out love  Or cool the fever'd mind  That sweetlydashing stream  Those gales that whisper round  Increase the fatal flame  Enlarge the bleeding wound  The silent gloom of night  Adds horror to my grief  The gay return of light  To me brings no relief  Why do I wander thus in woods alone  Why vent to senseless trees my mournful plaints  Sigh to the fleeting wind with tears deface  The dimpled stream Oh  Sylvia  cruel maid  Thy pride a savage sacrifice demands  Nor will be satisfied with less than life  Enter THIRSIS  THIRSIS  I sought thee dear  Philander  PHILANDER  Oh my  Thirsis  Why seek a wretch who cannot find himself  Lost to each joy to fierce despair a prey  Fain would I shun all commerce with mankind  In these dark shades wear out the sad remains  Of hated life  THIRSIS  Oh love thou tyrant of the human breast  Fierce and remorseless as the prowling wolf  That nightly makes the helpless flock his prey  Falsly they call thee god of pleasing pains  Of gentle wishes and refin'd delights  Doubts fears and jealousies surround thy throne  Eternal sighs fan thy destructive fires  And broken hearts are thy sad sacrifice  PHILANDER  Such is indeed the fate of hopeless love  And such is mine  THIRSIS  You make yourself your fate  Love should be paid with love and hate with hate  PHILANDER  SONG  In vain my passion you reprove  This heart alas was form'd for love  His pains if not his joys to feel  Here the soft god has fix'd his throne  But oh 'midst sighs and tears alone  Nor deigns the wounds he makes to heal  THIRSIS  Oh bend not thus thy drooping head to earth  Like tender plants beneath the beating storm  This day thy father by thy griefs impell'd  With grateful off'rings seeks his patron god  Prostrate before his altar now he lies  And all his pious prayers ascend for thee  PHILANDER  To mine alas no pitying pow'rs enclin'd  Unheard and mingled with the vagrant wind  THIRSIS  Hope better now for see thy fire appears  A solemn joy upon his brow he wears  Some pleasing news he brings  PHILANDER  Be still my heart  Oh throb not thus can hope be painful too  Enter MONTANO  MONTANO  Oh thou to fierce despair a wretched prey  Muchlov'd lamented youth  PHILANDER  Illomen'd pity  Alas my father mourns my fate 'tis past  Hope is no more  MONTANO  I bring thee more than hope  My vows are heard thy wishes all are crown'd  No more the haughty maid shall fly thy love  PHILANDER  Oh sounds which might arrest the stroke of death  Call back the soul to her abandon'd seat  And give it more than life give immortality  MONTANO  With awful rev'rence hear the god's decree  At whose dread altars I so long have serv'd  Sylvia  by plighted vows thy lawful claim  Must either yield this day to be thy bride  Or by her death  PHILANDER  Oh love almighty love  What do I hear  MONTANO  Or by her death atone  For violated faith Thus dooms  Apollo  PHILANDER  Is this to crown my wishes oh my father▪  MONTANO  Rash youth repine not at the god's decree  But to the haughty fair reveal her sentence  This day to be a victim or a bride  Is all her fate allows  PHILANDER  SONG  Oh stop that deathdenouncing sound  Nor mix it with the passing air  Lest by some ruder zephyr found  'Tis wasted to the trembling fair  His own soft cause love best can plead  Or let me die or let me thus succeed  Exit  THIRSIS  Despair is in his eyes oh sage  Montano  Should the proud nymph persist in her denial  Her sentence urg'd would aggravate his woe  And but forgive my sad foreboding fears  Perhaps involve him in her wretched fate  MONTANO  Dismiss thy fears thy unexperienc'd youth  Reads not the secret heart of varying woman  Form'd to ensnare and practis'd to delude  She flies but flying hopes to be pursu'd  With doubling arts long keeps the doubtful field  And yields or seems to force alone to yield  END of the SECOND ACT  ACT the THIRD  SCENE  A Grove  SYLVIA discovered sleeping at a distance PHILANDER enters and gazes on her  PHILANDER  SHE sleeps and I may gaze securely now  Nor fear the lightning of her angry eyes  So looks the goddess of the silver bow  When by  Eurota  's lucid wave she lies  SONG  On those fair eyelids gentle sleep  Thy softest influence shed  Still in thy downy fetters keep  The lovely cruel maid  Ye sighing gales ye murm'ring streams  Ye tenants of the grove  Oh lengthen out her pleasing dreams  And tune her soul to love  Conceal'd I'll guard thy slumbers lovely maid  Lest some rude swain the sweet recess invade  Those charms a lover views with chasten'd fires  In vulgar breasts may kindle loose desires  Enter the SATYR looking about him  SATYR  Low murm'ring sounds I heard yet none are here  'Twas but the whispers of the am'rous breeze  That plays among the boughs  SYLVIA  awaking  What do I see  The brutal  Satyr  guard me chaste  Diana  SATYR  Aye you may call your goddess to your aid  She hears you not the music of her hounds  And beaglehorn will drown your feeble cries  SYLVIA  Ah whither would'st thou drag me cruel Sylvan  Help help some pitying power  Enter PHILANDER  PHILANDER  Vile monster hence  The  SATYR  runs off  PHILANDER  approaches  SYLVIA  who turns from him  PHILANDER  Oh stedfast hate yet hear me cruel maid  If to have sav'd thee from the brutal rage  Of that fierce Sylvan claims one kind regard  Turn turn and listen to my ardent vows  SYLVIA  Why will you still this hated theme pursue  Must I another Satyr find in you  Both persecutors in a different way  My honour he you would my heart betray  SONG  Love o'er the abject breast may reign  With all his light fantastic train  Of wishes cares and fond desires  Fears and hopes and jealous fires  Be mine from the soft folly free  Love has no charms like liberty  PHILANDER  Yet yet relent yield to a lover's prayer  SYLVIA  Away or this detested theme forbear  PHILANDER  What shall I say her stubborn mind to move  Declare her sentence no forbid it love  To her  Yet hear me  Sylvia  e'er it be too late  Speak one kind word for oh thy breath is fate  SYLVIA  Mark then my firm resolves and oh be thou  Celestial maid propitious to my vow  With thee an humble vot'ry to remain  Tho' last and meanest of thy virgin train  If cold and temp'rate as thy own mild ray  Thy shades I haunt and thy commands obey  Still goddess thy protection let me prove  And guard me from the sly seducer love  Exit  PHILANDER  Stay  Sylvia  stay and from these trembling lips  Hear the stern god's decreeAlas she flies  Swift as the trackless winds to death she flies  Death less abhorr'd than me  Enter NERINA  NERINA  Here  Sylvia  should be found but sure I heard  The plaintive voice of sorrow'tis  Philander  Alas poor youth he weeps I will observe him  PHILANDER  Why wears  The face of nature such a chearful smile  Why this soft verdure why this gaudy bloom  Fall horrors fall and make this beauteous scene  Dark as my gloomy souloh  Sylvia Sylvia  NERINA  Would she were here and heard thee  PHILANDER  Cold shadowy queen who laugh'st at lover's woes  Thy self unloving unbelov'd now save  From the sad doom incurr'd thy beauteous vot'ry  NERINA  approaching him  Alas what doom speak'st thou of  Sylvia  shepherd  PHILANDER  Ha sure the goddess' self inspires the thought  Haste haste  Nerina  seek thy cruel friend  Tell heroh heaven tell her

THIRSIS  THIRSIS  He's here how shall I speak the dreadful news  PHILANDER  Why art thou thus alarm'd say dearest  Thirsis  Alas 'tis the sad privilege of despair  To fear no worse  THIRSIS  She has refus'd you then  PHILANDER  She has and oh with such a fix'd disdain  Ungrateful maid then when my timely aid  Had sav'd her from a brutal Satyr's lust  Then to reject my humble suff'ring love  And in despite of former ties renew  Her vows to the rough goddess of the woods  THIRSIS  Horrid ingratitude would thou could'st hate her  PHILANDER  Hate her yes friend I'll tear her from my breast  Oh may she feel like me the pangs of love  Like me unpity'd mourn and sigh in vain  THIRSIS  The righteous gods to noblervengeance doom  The perjur'd maid  PHILANDER  Oh  Thirsis  there I'm lost  THIRSIS  Arcadia  groans beneath  Apollo  's frown  In thee his priest is scorn'd the wrathful god  Bends his dread bow o'er our devoted plains  And claims his victim  PHILANDER  Sylvia  then must die  THIRSIS  She must my friend e'en now with mild entreaty  Thy father urg'd her to perform her vow  Scornful she heard nor shook at the sad sentence  Which he with tears pronounc'd  PHILANDER  Yet hold my heart  Where is she now  THRISIS  I saw her guarded by the attending priests  In sad procession led tow'rds the temple  Her griev'd companions rend the air with cries  And beat their snowy breasts in wild despair  But she with haughty mien erect and firm  As the stern deity by her obey'd  Welcomes her fate nor can th'approach of death  Banish the colour from her cheeks or rage  And fierce disdain plant fresher roses there  PHILANDER  Oh  Sylvia  must thou die  THIRSIS  Alas my friend  You tremble you look pale think on your wrongs  Think on her scorn and th'impending curse  That threats  Arcadia  till the god's appeas'd  SOLEMN MUSIC  at a distance  PHILANDER  By all the pangs that rend this tortur'd breast  The sad solemnity is now begun  Ah friend farewel farewel my dearest
