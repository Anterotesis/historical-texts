The booby has scarce a thousand pounds a year in the world yet he spends above two thousand in equipage taste high life and jolly partiesbesides what his fool of a wise loses to that female sharper my Lady Kinnegad and her jolly party which if I may judge by my own wife is at least a good two thousand more so that by the rule of subtraction take four thousand pounds a year out of one and in a very little time nothing will remain but a goal or an escape in the packet on Connaught Monday  Enter  William  shewing in Counsellor  Hamilton  Will  Counsellor Hamilton    Exit  William  O'Dogh  Counsellor you are welcome to Dublin  Coun  Brother I am extremely glad to see you  O'Dogh  By my faith and so am I you Odzooks give us a kiss man I give you my honour I am as glad to see you in Dublin at this juncture as I should to see a hundred head of fat bullocks upon my own land all ready for Ballinasloe Fair  Coun  Sir your humble servant That is a great compliment from you brother I know  O'Dogh  It is a very true one I assure you  Coun  Well I see by the newspapers that my sister is returned from her coronation frolie and in health I suppose or you would have wrote me word had it been otherwise  O'Dogh  Yes yes she is in health indeed and returned with a vengeance  Coun  Pray what is the matter  O'Dogh  Ogho enough is the matter the devil an inhabitant in Swift's Hospital for Lunatics is in a worse pickle than she is  Coun  You surprise mein what respect pray  O'Dogh  Why with a distemper that she has brought over with her from England which will in a little time I am afraid infect the whole nation  Coun  Pray what may that be  O'Dogh  Sir it is called the Irish Fine Lady's delirium or the London vertigo if you were to hear her when the sit is upon heroh she is as madthe devil a thing in this poor country but what gives her the spleen and the vapoursthen such a phrenzy of admiration for every thing in Englandand among the rest of her madness she has brought over a new language with her  Coun  What do you mean by a new language  O'Dogh  Why a new kind of a London English that's no more like our Irish English than a coxcomb' fine gilded chariot like a Glassmanogue noddyWhy what name do you think she went by when she was in England  Coun  Why what name dare she go by but Dogherty  O'Dogh  Doghertyoghoupon my honour she startles when she hears the name of Dogherty and blushes and is as much ashamed as if a man had spoke bawdy to herNo no my dear she is no longer the plain modest goodnatured domestic obedient Irish Mrs O'Dogherty but the travelled rampant highlis'd prancing English Mrs Diggerty  Coun  Ha ha ha Mrs Diggerty ridiculous  O'Dogh  Ay ridiculous indeed to change her namewas there ever such impertinence But do you know brother among the rest of your sister's whims and madnesses that she is turned a great politician too concerning my name  Coun  Ha ha ha a politician IWhy how in the name of wonder and common sense can  politics and the name of Dogherty be connected  O'Dogh  O it's a wonder indeedbut strange as it is they are connectedbut very ridiculously as you may imagine  Coun  But prithee by what means  O'Dogh  Why you must know we are to have an election shortly for the county that I live in which young Lord Turnabout wants to carry for one of his own gang and as the election in a great measure depends upon my interest the young fox knowing the conceit and vanity of my wife has taken her by her favourite soible and tickled it up by telling her that if I direct my interest properly it would not be difficult to procure me a title Now sir this piece of flattery has stirred up such a rage of quality and title in her giddy head that I cannot rest night or day for her importunityin short she would have me desert my friends and sell myself my honour and my country as several others have done before me merely for a title only that she may take place of a parcel of foolish idle women and sink the antient name of Dogherty in the upstart title of Lady Thingum my Lady Fiddle F addle or some such ridiculous nonsense  Coun  But sir pray pause a little upon this businessmy sister's vanity I grant you may be ridiculousbut though you despise titles and oftentation yet as your interest can certainly make the member were I in your circumstances I would have a voice in the senate of my  countrygo into parliament for the county yourself  O'Dogh  Ogh I have been among them already and I know them all very well What signifies my sitting among hundreds of people with my single opinion all alone When I was there before I was stigmatized as a singular blockhead an impracticable fellow only because I would not consent to sit like an image and when the master of the puppets pulled the string of my jaw on one side to say aye and on t'other side to say no and to leap over a stick backwards and forwards just as the faction of party and jobbers and leaders and political adventurers directedah brother brother I have done with them alloh I have done with them all  Coun  What and after all your expence of opposing government right or wrong and supporting your patriots will you give them all up  O'Dogh  Indeed I willI was patriot mad I own like a great many other fools in this distracted countrysir I was so mad that I hated the very name of a courtier as much as an illiterate layswaddling methodist does that of a regular clergyman But I am cured of that folly for now I find that a courtier is just as honest a man as a patriotmy dear they are both made of the same stuff ah I have at last found out what sort of an animal a patriot is  Coun  Ayand pray brother what sort of an animal is he  O'Dogh  Why he is a sort of a political weathercock that is blown about by every wind of society which the foolish people are always  looking up at and staring and distracting themselves with the integrity of its vicissitudestoday it is blown by the rough rattling tempest of party next day by the tradewind of fly subtle veering faction then by the headlong hurricane of the people's hot foggy breath huzza boys down with the courtier up with the patriot 'till at last the smooth soft gentle warm breeze of interest blows upon it and from that moment it rusts to a point and never stirs afterso there is your puff patriot for youogh to the devil I pitch them all  Coun  Ha ha ha I am glad to find brother that you are come to that way of thinking at last and I wish you had had the same notions years ago it would have saved you many thousands  O'Dogh  Indeed and that it wouldhowever experience is an excellent tutor and as you are a young man and just coming into the world mine may be of some service to you take this judgment from me then and remember that an honest quiet country gentleman who out of policy and humanity establishes manufactories or that contrives employment for the idle and the industrious or that makes but a blade of corn grow where there was none before is of more use to this poor country than all the courtiers and patriots and politicians and prodigals that are unhangedso there let us leave them and return to my wife's business  Coun  With all my heart I long to have a particular account of her conduct  O'Dogh  O brother I have many grievances to tell you of but I have one that's more whimsical than all the rest  Coun  Pray what is it  O'Dogh  Why you must know brother I am going to be a cuckold as fast as I can  Coun  Ha ha ha that's a comical grievance indeed  O'Dogh  O stay 'till you hear the story and I'll engage you will say it is as comical a cuckoldom as ever was contrived  Coun  I am glad to find sir it is of so sacetious a naturepray let me hear this business  O'Dogh  Sit down then brother for I have got a little touch of my gout let us sit down for a moment and I will let you into the whole affair  Coun  Pray do sir for you have really raised my curiosity  sits  O'Dogh  You must know brother there is an English coxcomb in this town just arrived among us who thinks every woman that sees him is in love with him and this spark like another Paris of Troy has taken it into his head to make a Helen of my wife and a poor cuckoldy Menelaus of me  Coun  Ha ha ha Pray who is the spark  O'Dogh  Why the name of this cuckoldmaker is Mushroom but from his conceit and impertinence the women and jokers of this town have dignified him with the title of Count Mushroom Sir he is the son of a pawnbroker in London who having a mind to make a gentleman of his son sent him to the university  of Oxford where by mixing in the follies and vices of irregular youth he got into a most sanguine friendship with young Lord OldCastle who you know has a large estate in this country and of whose ancestors mine have held long and profitable leases which are now near expiringin short sir this same Count Mushroom and my Lord became the Pylades and Orestes of the age and so very fond was my Lord of him that out of sheer friendship to the Count he got his sister with child  Coun  Ha ha ha that was friendly indeed  O'Dogh  O yes it was what you may call modern friendship taste and bun tun and my Lord being a man of gratitude in return made him his agent in this country and sent him over to settle his affairs here And the Count and I being in treaty to renew the leases with my Lord and we not being able to agree upon the terms the coxcomb sends my wife a warm billedoux in which he very gallantly tells her that she shall decide the difference between us and settle the leases at her own price only upon the trifling condition that he may be permitted now and then to be the occasional lord of her ladyship's matrimonial manor  Coun  Impudent rascal And pray what says my sister to all this  O'Dogh  Why she does not know a word of the matter  Coun  No pray how came you to be acquainted with his letter then and his designs upon my sister  O'Dogh  Why there is the joke it was by the help of Katty Farrel my wife's woman by whose assistance I carry on a correspondence with the fellow in my wife's name unknown to her and by that means I shall not only detect and expose the fellow but get an excellent bargain of the leases which are to be signed this very day  Coun  But sir I hope you wont accept of leases upon those terms  O'Dogh  O I have no time to moralize with you on that point but depend upon it I will convince you before I sleep of the propriety of my taking the leases Lord what signifies it it is only a good bargain got from a foolish lord by the ingenuity of a knavish agent which is what happens every day in this country and in every country indeed  Enter  John  John  Sir Mr Mushroom and Mr Sharp the attorney are below  O'Dogh  O they are come about the leases I will wait on them John    Exit  John  Now brother you shall see one of the pertest and most conceited impudent coxcombs that has ever yet been imported into this land or that disgraced humanity  Mushroom  without  Mush  My compliments Mrs Katty to your lady I will be with her in the twinkling of a  star or in less time than a single glance of her own immortal beauty can pass to the centre of an amorous heart  O'Dogh  Orra now did you ever hear such cursed nonsense  Enter  Mushroom  Mush  My dear Diggerty I kiss your hands I am come on purposeI beg ten thousand pardonsI understood you were aloneyou

Diggerty  and  Hamilton  Coun  Madam madam you shall hear me  Mrs Dig  Was there ever so rude so abrupt a behaviourto force me from my company thus  Coun  Tis what your insolent disease demands the suddenness and abruptness of the  shock is the chief ingredient in the remedy that must cure you  Mrs Dig  What do you mean sir  Coun  I will tell you madamyou are not ignorant that your husband took you without a fortune that he generously gave the little our father left you to your younger sister with the benevolent addition of two thousand poundsyou know too that by marriage articles upon a separation or your husband's death you are entitled only to a hundred pounds a year which cautious pittance his prudence wisely insisted on as a necessary check upon the conduct of giddy female youth and thoughtless vanity when matched with the tempered age of sobriety and discretionnow madam I am commissioned to inform you that the doors are open and that the stipulated sum will be punctually paid you as your vicious appetite shall demand for know that neither your husband's love my affection nor a residence in this house can be enjoyed by you another hour but on the hard condition of a thorough reformation  Mrs Dig  Sir  Coun  Madam it is true for if female vanity will be mad husbands must be peremptory  Mrs Dig  Pray sir do not speak so loud  Coun  Why not  Mrs Dig  The company will hear you  Coun  I know itand I intend they shall  Mrs Dig  Oh oh oh I shall be ashamed for everpray do not speak so loudbless me brother you startle mewhat is it you mean  Coun  Will you hear what I have to say will you attend to the dictates of a brother's love with modest patience and virtuous candour  Mrs Dig  I will  Coun  Sit downknow then in your husband's judgment the sums you have squandered and those you have been cheated of by your female friends is your least offenceit is your pride your midnight revels insolence of taste rage of precedency that grieve him for they have made you the ridicule of every flirt and coxcomb and the scorn and pity of every sober person that knows your folly this reflects disgrace upon your friends contempt upon the spirit and credit of your husband and has furnished whispering suspicion with stories and implications which have secretly fixed an infectious stain upon your chastity  both rise  Mrs Dig  My chastity I defy the world  Coun  Aye madam you may defy it but she who does will find the world too hard a match for her  Mrs Dig  I care not what slander saysI will rely upon my innocence  Coun  But I will not madam nor shall youit is not sufficient for my sister your husband's wife or female reputation to rely on innocence alonewomen must not only be innocent they must appear so too  Mrs Dig  Brother I don't know what you mean by all this I beg you will explain  Coun  I willknow then this coxcomb Mushroom  Mrs Dig  Mushroom  Coun  Mushroomas a man of wit and spirit thought himself obliged to take some hints your levity had given him  Mrs Dig  I give him hintsbrother you wrong me  Coun  Pray hear methis spark I say like a true man of intrigue not only returns your hints with a letter of gallantry but bribes your own woman to deliver it  Mrs Dig  My woman  Coun  The same  Mrs Dig  I am ignorant of all this and will turn her out of the house this instant  Coun  Softly hear the whole the maid instead of carrying the letter to you delivers that and many others to her master who in your name hand stile and sentiment has answered them all and carried on an amorous correspondence with the gentleman even up to an assignation and now at this very instant the spark is preparing for the happy interview and has made the town the confidants of his good fortune  Mrs Dig  O heavens  Coun  Now judge what your husband brother and your friends must feel and what the world must think of her whose conduct could entitle a coxcomb to such liberties  Mrs Dig  Brother I shall make no defencethe story shocks me and though I know my own intentions yet what people may saybut be assured I shall be more prudent for the futureperhaps I have been to blamepray  advise meonly say what I shall do to be revenged upon the fellow for his impudence and what will convince my husband you and all the world of my innocence and I will do it I protest you have given such a motion to my heart and such a trouble and a trembling as it never felt before  Coun  It is a virtuous motionencourage itfor the anxiety and tears of repentance though the rarest are the brightest ornaments a modern fine lady can be deck'd in  Katty  and  O'Dogherty  without  O'Dogh  I shall be in here with the counsellor Katty and the moment he comes bring me word  Katty  I shall sir  Coun  Here your husband comes  Mrs Dig  I am ashamed to see him  Enter  O'Dogherty  O'Dogh  Well brother have you spoke to her  Coun  There she is sirand as she should bebathed in the tears of humility and repentance  O'Dogh  Ogh I am sorry to see this indeedI am afraid you have gone too far If I had been by I assure you brother you should not have made her cryYerrow Nancy child turn about and don't be crying there  Mrs Dig  Sir I am asham'd to see your facemy errors I acknowledgeand for the future  O'Dogh  Pooh poohI will have no submissions nor acknowledgments if you have settled every thing with your brother that is sufficient  Mrs Dig  I hope he is satisfiedand it shall be the business of my life  O'Dogh  Pooh pooh say no more I tell you but come give me a kiss and let us be friends at oncethereso in that kiss now let all tears and uneasiness subside with you as all fears and resentment shall die with me  Coun  Come sister give me your hand for I must have my kiss of peace too I own I have been a little fevere with you but your disease required sharp medicines  O'Dogh  Now we are friends Nancy I have a favour or two to beg of you  Mrs Dig  Pray command them  O'Dogh  Why then the first thing that I ask is that you will send away that French rascal the cook with his compots and combobs his alamodes and aladobes his crapandoes and frigandoes and a thousand outlandish kickshaws that I am sure were never designed for Christian food and let the good rough rumps of beef the jolly surloins the geefe and turkies cram fowls bacon and greens and the pies puddings and pasties that used to be perfectly shoving one another off of the table so that there was not room for the people's plates with a fine large cod too as big as a young aldermanI say let all those French kickshaws be banished from my table and these good old Irish dishes  be put in their places and then the poor every day will have something to eat  Mrs Dig  They shall sir  O'Dogh  And as to yourself my dear Nancy I hope I shall never have any more of your London English none of your this here's your that there's your winegars your weals your vindors your toastesses and your stone postesses but let me have our own good plain old Irish English which I insist upon is better than all the English English that ever coquets and coxcombs brought into the land  Mrs Dig  I will get rid of these as fast as possible  O'Dogh  And pray above all things never call me Mr Diggertymy name is Murrogh O'Dogherty and I am not ashamed of it but that damn'd name Diggerty always vexes me whenever I hear it  Mrs Dig  Then upon my honour Mr O'Dogherty it shall never vix you again  O'Dogh  Ogh that's right NancyO'Dogherty for everO'Doghertythere's a found for youwhy they have not such a name in all England as O'Doghertynor as any of our fine sounding Milesian nameswhat are your Jones and your Stones your Rice and your Price your Heads and your Foots and Hands and your Wills and Hills and Mills and Sands and a parcel of little pimping names that a man would not pick out of the street compared to the O'Donovans O'Callaghans O'Sullivans O'Brallaghans O'Shaghnesses O'Flahertys O'Gallaghers and O'Doghertys  Ogh they have courage in the very sound of them for they come out of the mouth like a storm and are as old and as stout as the oak at the bottom of the bog of Allen which was there before the floodand though they have been dispossessed by upstarts and foreigners buddoughs and sassanoughs yet I hope they will flourish in the Island of Saints while grass grows or water runs  Enter  Katty  Katty  Mr Mushroom is come sir  O'Dogh  What in his woman's
