 THE NUNNERY AN ELEGY In IMITATION of the ELEGY in a CHURCHYARD  Son pittore anche io  CORREGIO  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY at Tully'sHead PallMall Price Sixpence  THE NUNNERY  REtirement's Hour proclaims the tolling Bell  Each sacred Virgin follows its Decree  With meek Submission seeks her lonely Cell  And leaves the Grate to Solitude and me  Now shows the sinking Sun a fainter glare  And Silence thro' the Convent reigns confest  Save where some paleey'd Novice wrap'd in Pray'r  Heaves a deep groan and smites her guiltless breast  Save where in artless melancholy Strains  Some  Eloisa  whom soft Passion moves  Absorpt in Sorrow to the Night complains  For ever bar'd the  Abelard  she loves  Within those ancient Walls by Moss o'erspread  Where the relenting Sinner learns to weep  Each in her narrow Bed till Midnight laid  The gentle Daughters of Devotion sleep  No Stings of Conscience goad their easy Breast  No unrepented Crimes their Slumbers fright  No mournful Dreams invade their peaceful Rest  Nor shrouded Spectres stalk afore their Sight  Th' endearing Scenes of Life They all forego  Ev'n Hymen's Torch for Them must never blaze  The Husband's fond Embrace They ne'er shall know  Nor view their Image in their Children's' Face  Oft did they steal the flow'ry Robe of  May  To deck the Altar and the Shrines around  How fervent did They chant the pious Lay  While the deep Organ swell'd the sacred Sound  Let not the gay Coquette with Jest profane  Mock their veil'd Life and Destiny severe  Nor worldly Beauty with a Sneer disdain  The humble Duties of the Cloyster'd Fair  The glist'ning Eye The halfseen Breast of Snow  The coral Lip the clear vermilion Bloom  Awaits alike th' inexorable Foe  The Paths of Pleasure lead but to the Tomb  Forgive Ye Fair whom  Britain's  Sons admire  If This her meanest Bard incur your Blame  While He devotes not to your Praise the Lyre  But to the Convent dedicates his Theme  Can These partake the sprightlymoving Dance  Or in the Garb of Luxury appear  Can These e'er pierce the Lover with a Glance  Or grace the Tragic Scene with Pity's Tear  Perhaps in this drear Mansion are confin'd  Some whose accomplish'd Beauty cou'd impart  The soft Desire to the severest Mind  And wake to Extacy the throbbing Heart  But splendid Life in each Allurement drest  Attracts Them not tho' flush'd with youthful Bloom  Stern Pennance chills the Ardour of their Breast  And buries their Ambition in this Gloom  Full many a Riv'let steals its gentle Way  Unheard untasted by the thirsty Swain  Full many a  Philomel  attunes her Lay  And pours her plaintive Melody in vain  Some veil'd  Eliza  like the clouded Sun  May here reside inglorious and unknown  Some like  Augusta  might have rear'd a Son  To bless a Nation and adorn a Throne  From Flatt'ry's Lip to drink the Sweets of Praise  In Wit and Charms with other Belles to vie  In Circles to attract the partial Gaze  And view Their Beauty in th' Admirer's Eye  Their Lot forbids nor does alone remove  The Thirst of Praise but e'en their Vices chains  Forbids thro' Folly's Labyrinth to rove  And yield to Pleasure the unheeded reins  To raise mid Hymen's Joys domestic Strife  Or seek that Converse which They ought to shun  To break the sacred Ties of married Life  And give to many what they vow'd to one  Far from the Bustle of the splendid Throng  They tread Obscurity's sequester'd Vale  Where the white Hours glide silently along  Smooth as the Stream when sleeps the breezy Gale  Yet tho' they're sprinkled with ethereal Dew  With blooming Wreaths by Hands of Seraphs crown'd  Tho' Heav'n's eternal Splendors burst to View  And Harps celestial to their Ear resound  Still grateful Mem'ry paints the absent Friend  Not ev'n the World to their Remembrance dies  Their Midnight Orisons to Heav'n ascend  To stop the Bolt descending from the Skies  For who entranc'd in Visions from above  The Thought of Kindred razes from the Mind  Feels in the Soul no warm returning Love  For some endear'd Companion left behind  From Friendship's Breast reluctant they withdrew  And with a Sigh forsook their native Air  To their fond Parents when they bad Adieu  Gush'd from their Eye the tender filial Tear  For Thee who mindful of th' encloyster'd Fair  Dost in these Lines their artless Tale relate  If Chance in distant Time's revolving Year  Some kindred Spirit shall enquire thy Fate  Haply some aged Vestal may reply  "Oft have we seen Him 'ere  Aurora  's Ray  "Had faintly ting'd with red the op'ning Sky  "Hasten to Church and join the Matin Lay  "There at the Tomb where  Eloisa  lies  "He'd read th' Inscription and her Fate condole  "Then in his Breast as Scenes of Grief arise  "Sigh the kind Requiem to her gentle Soul  "Against yon Pillar careless now He'd lean  "Smiling at what his wayward Fancy moves  "Now drooping wan and pensive wou'd be seen  "As one abandon'd by the Fair He loves  "One Morn I miss'd Him in the aweful Dome  "Along the Isle and in the Sacristy  "Another came nor yet beside the Tomb  "Nor at the Font nor in the Porch was He  "The next we heard which did our Wonder move  "He was departed to return no more  "Yet lest the sudden Change we shou'd reprove  "These Lines He sent us from  Britannia  's Shore  "What Time in Transport lost the Na√Øad Throng  "First catch'd their  Akenside  's enchanting Lay  "And raptur'd Fancy listen'd to the Song  "Of laurel'd  Whitehead  and sweetplaintive  Gray"  The LETTER  A Vestal Fair Her Name I may'nt unfold  Has planted in my Breast the pleasing Dart  Who by relentless Vows if not controll'd  Wou'd own perchance a Sympathy of Heart  The growing Passion impotent to quell  Severe Discretion urg'd me to retreat  Now at my native rural Home I dwell  Where Contemplation keeps her lonely Seat  Seek not to draw me from this still Abode  Where the kind Muses to my Aid repair  And when the Thoughts of hapless Love corrode  Check the deep Sigh and wipe the trickling Tear  FINIS
