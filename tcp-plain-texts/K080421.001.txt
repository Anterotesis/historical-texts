 OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE CHIEFLY TO PICTURESQUE BEAUTY Made in the YEAR On several PARTS of GREAT BRITAIN PARTICULARLY THE HIGHLANDS of SCOTLAND  VOL I  By WILLIAM GILPIN A M PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEWFOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE STRAND  MDCCLXXXIX  TO THE EARL HARCOURT  MY LORD  BESIDES your Lordship's great attachment to the polite arts I have other reasons for placing your name before these papers If you will accept this address as an instance of my gratitude I leave it to the world to judge of it's propriety  In perusing these remarks your Lordship will be pleased to recollect they were written in the year  since which time many of the arti∣ficial scenes taken notice of in them have probably undergone great im∣provement In such instances I only shew how much has been done by shewing how much was wanting  The subject of these volumes my Lord is so nearly that of a late publication on the lakes and moun∣tains of Cumberland that similar ideas must of course frequently oc∣cur In this case I have en∣deavoured to vary my object by throwing different lights upon it and to vary my remarks by throwing them on different circumstances  In the work I have just alluded to many thought my language too luxuriantparticularly a friend of your Lordship's whose practice in versification makes his taste the more easily offended when prose deviat∣ing into poetical phrase transgresses it's proper bounds Your Lordship's correct judgment may probably like∣wise have taken offence on this head I can only say I endeavoured as I could to adapt my language to my subject and as  picturesque description  was rather a novel mode of writing I thought I had some little right to adopt my own But as I find many of my friends disallow my apology I submit conscious that  no man is a proper judge in his own case I have endeavoured therefore to make the following observations less liable to that objection  But however justly I may have been censured on this head I have heard other criticisms founded on plain ignorance of the subject Pic∣turesque ideas lie not in the com∣mon road of genius and learning They require perhaps a distinct fa∣culty to comprehend themat least they require more attention to the scenes of nature and the rules of art than men of letters in general unless stimulated by a peculiar in∣clination bestow upon them Such men therefore are improper judges  If your Lordship's name and coun∣tenance can skreen me from critics of this kind I shall rejoice at hav∣ing secured myself behind so good a shield  On the whole if my remarks are so fortunate as to meet your Lordship's approbation I have little doubt but it will be an earnest of the approbation of the public I am my Lord with great respect  Your Lordship's obliged and most obedient humble servant WILLIAM GILPIN  VICAR'S HILL  APRIL  TABLE OF CONTENTS TO VOLUME I  SECTION I  COUNTRY about Enfieldchace and through Hertfordshire

visit some of the more remarkable scenes in Scotland and in our journey through England some parts of it also which we had not seen be∣fore  Having passed the wild open country of Enfieldchace lately despoiled by act of par∣liament of it's trees and having left the sweet woodlands of Hertfordshire our views  became coarse and unpleasant The fa∣tiguing uniformity of them was here and there just relieved by a distance particularly at Al∣conburyhill  From hence among other remote objects that large piece of water called Whittlesey∣mere makes a considerable appearance stretch∣ing into length far to the right You get a sight of it from other parts of the road and if the foreground happen in any degree to rise you may see perhaps a point of land pushing out into the water but in general it appears only a long narrow slip without form The eye however makes some judgment of it's length which is two leagues tho none of it's breadth which is at least one It's di∣mensions are larger than most of the Cum∣berland lakes yet through it's want of ac∣companiments it's flat shores and vile neigh∣bourhood of fens and marshes of which it is the great drain few travellers desire to see more of it than is exhibited from the road  To the inhabitants of it's shores however it is a great source both of  use  and  amusement  It abounds with fish and the winds being more constant here than in a lake surrounded with mountains where they blow in gusts  and eddies a boat is more manageable and sailing a more agreeable amusement  In Danish times Whittleseymere was con∣sidered as a great inland sea and navigated only in cases of necessity Camden tells us from an old history of Ely that it was once the scene of a great calamity When Canute resided at Peterborough his children and others of the royal family had occasion to go to the abbey of Ramsey Whittleseymere lay di∣rectly in the way Here they embarked when  in the midst of their pleasant voyage and their singing and jollity the turbulent winds and a tempestuous storm arose  their vessel foun∣dered and the greatest part of the royal family perished  About the sixtyninth stone the view is beautifully confined by  Monk's woods  As we approach Stamford the country tho every where full of little varieties is on the whole rather flat  From Stamford we visited Burleighhouse which is a place of great magnificence It  has no advantage of situation being buried in the dip of a park which indeed possesses no where much agreeable scenery The house formerly was approached by descending avenues which were as displeasing as formality and awkwardness could make them Mr Brown was employed to reform them and if possible to give some air of elegance to the approach Much he could not do The situation of the house forbad and the unaccommodating form of the park Every thing however that was disgusting he has removed He has closed the avenues he has varied the slopes and has led the approach through a winding val∣ley in the very path which nature would have chosen as the easiest The magic of these improvements is such that it has given the house a new site It appears as you approach it to assume even an elevated sta∣tionBut the  scenery  about Burleigh is not the object it is the  house  chiefly which at∣tracts the traveller  Burleighhouse is one of the noblest mo∣numents of British architecture in the times of Elizabeth when the great outlines of magnificence were rudely drawn but unim∣proved by taste The architect till lately  was unknown as indeed we know very little of the architects of those days But the earl of Warwick has a book of original plans in his possession by John Thorpe from which it appears that he was the architect of Burleigh house It is an im∣mense pile forming the four sides of a large court and tho decorated with a variety of fantastic ornaments according to the fashion of the time before Grecian architecture had introduced symmetry proportion and elegance into the plans of private houses it has still an august appearance The inside of the court is particularly striking The spire is neither I think in itself an ornament nor has it any effect except at a distance where it contributes to give this whole immense pile the consequence of a town  How far the fashionable array in which Mr Brown has dressed the grounds about this venerable building agree with it's for∣mality and antique appendages I dare not take upon me to say A doubt arises whether the old decoration of avenues and parterres was not in a more  suitable  stile of ornament It is however a nice question and would admit many plausible arguments on both sides  The rooms are fitted up in that rich but solemn manner which the magnificence of the house requires Some of them indeed which had been long disused are now adorned in a lighter taste but their uniformity is lostThe grand staircase and many of the ceilings are painted by Verrio who spent twelve years we were informed in this work during which time he had a handsome pen∣sion a table kept and an equipage Verrio was a man of extraordinary pomp and had been so carressed by Charles the second that he thought himself a capital artist He was a painter as Mr Walpole justly observes whose  exuberant pencil was well adapted to adorn those public surfaces on which the eye never rests long enough to criticize  but he was certainly not worth the attention which lord Exeter paid him tho his works at Burleigh are confessedly the most correct of any he has left behind him  Painted ceilings however are at best I think but awkward ornaments not only as it is impossible to examine them without pain but also as the foreshortening of the figures which is absolutely necessary to give them any kind of effect is so contrary to what we  see in common life that it is disgusting Mr Pope also with his usual just taste suggests another objection to them He speaks of  the sprawling saints of Verrio and Laguerre  by which expression he seems to consider them as floundring in some strange medium we know not what which affords them no stable footing Figures indeed represented  in the clouds  are not so obvious to this ex∣ception We can bear however to see such an artist as Verrio employed on a ceiling but when we see a master like Rubens so engaged it is mortifying  Yet still a painted ceiling if the colours are rich and dark adds a pleasing solemnity to these antique mansions but we wish only for elegant ornamental scrolls It is merely the  general effect of the gloom  that pleases as in a chapel we are soothed with that solemn light which passes through painted glass tho we wish neither for figures nor any other form of creation  In rooms of a lighter taste as they are gene∣rally now fitted up in great houses more airy ceilings are suitable Lightness and gaiety in furniture is now the fashion cor∣responding more perhaps with the manners  of the times The manners of the great were formerly reserved grave and dignified Their apartments of course contracted a more solemn air They were hung with darker colours to which the furniture was adapted How far the manners of those days were more agreeable I know not but I have no scruple in giving the preference to their apartments Awkwardnesses there might be and certainly were I speak only of their  general air  The pictures in Burleighhouse of which there is great profusion are highly valued Indeed we seldom find a better collection They are in general pleasing In the chapel which is adapted rather to  amusement  than  devotion  hang several very shewy pictures Solomon's idolatry and Moses in the rushes both by Loti are such The altarpiece by P Veronese is more classical but it is so deficient as a  whole  that we could admire only some of the  parts  Among these the head of St James is wonderfully expressive The death of Seneca by L Giordano is esteemed one of the best pictures in the col∣lection but it is wanting both in  composition  and in  effect of light  Either of these requi∣sites  will contribute greatly to an  agreeable whole  but when a picture is deficient in  both  the eye cannot rest upon it with pleasure The passion of grief is indeed well distributed among the attendants of the dying philosopher but it is conveyed through the medium of very awkward characters  We must not leave this grand house without looking into the kitchen which is a noble room and decorated with the ensign armorial of hospitality an immense carcase of beef well painted  From Burleighhouse we visited a more retired mansion which this noble family possesses at Stamford The familyvault there is a curious scene of the kind Here lies the old statesman of queen Elizabeth with a numerous race of his descendants collected around him Even in these silent regions are found the vanities of dress The ancients of the house are clad in plain lead and stone but you trace the progress of fashion in the decorations of succeeding ages Many who came last from the upper regions are adorned in crimson velvet coronets and lace and  figure away in these cells of darkness One would think the grave had little to do with vanity but our foibles adhere to our last sand It has ever been so  quae gratia  fuit vivis  eadem sequitur tellure repostos  SECT II  FROM Stamford we proceeded to Newark through Colsterworth a neighbourhood famous for giving birth to Sir Isaac Newton This whole tract of country affords little that is amusing till we come to  Gunnersbyhill  from whence we have a very extensive view The grounds on which the eye immediately falls are level sheepwalks with few inter∣sections but no way offensive Distant views seldom enjoy this advantage The near grounds when cultivated are always formal and disgusting Here they were uncultivated and pleasing Beyond the sheepwalks a vast stretch of flat country inriched with a variety of indistinct objects melts into the horizon It consists only of the common features of a flat distance but they are uncom∣monly broad and ample  Through this country the Trent takes it's course tho it rarely  appears  in any part No river in England is subject to such wide and lasting inundations and on inspecting the map of the country as it lay now before us we wanted no geometrical level to convince us that when the waters of this sluggish stream become once swoln it's floods must be diffusive and of long continuance for there appears to be no where any descent to carry them off The scenery before us was finely varied when we surveyed it by floating lights which spreading over one part and another shewed us every part by turns No∣thing in landscape is more beautiful than these lengthened gleams  See other remarks on this subject in treating of the  floating lights  on Skiddaw near the close of these observations  The Dutch masters who painted from a flat country knew the force of their effect and often introduced them  When the distance consists as it does here of a vast  flat surface  the painter cannot well manage it without these adventitious lights It would be one heavy fatiguing tint And  yet  too many  of these gleams occasion what the artists call a  spottiness  in landscape Two at most are sufficient and if two there should always be a subordination between them The nearer may be broader and more vivid leaving the more distant a mere strip  When the distance tho very extensive is  not merely a flat  but is varied with pro∣minent parts it may support it's consequence tho the whole be in shadow It will itself produce variety A knoll may run out of such conspicuous size that according to the common rules of keeping it will naturally be invested with a deeper tint than the coun∣try which lies beyond it for as it's greater height intercepts a portion of that country it is seen against a part more remote than itself and will of course be tinted with a darker hue Thus also the spot or mote which the eye conceives to be a castle a clump of trees or some other object in the distance is tinted with a darker touch because in the same manner it is seen against a country more remote than itself and consequently lighter Even the folding of rising grounds over each other will pro∣duce  the same effect The nearer ground intercepting a valley will always appear darker Tho the inaccurate observer therefore may think a distant landscape when in shadow might be represented by one broad dash of  equal colour  excepting only what difference the gradation of shade occasions he is mistaken Simplicity and breadth are every where pleasing and particularly in distance but still if the  inequalities of a surface  are not attended to and marked by a discrimination however slight the picture may appear unnatural to an eye which may not have knowledge enough in keeping and the perspective of nature to suggest a reason  Under every circumstance a country re∣tiring into remote distance is among the most beautiful parts of landscape and is a very pleasing study to a lover of nature If he be a true disciple of nature and attend closely to all her variations of weatherof seasonsof morning and evening suns he will discover more and more her magical secrets in the illumination of distant objects He will see with what vivid touches of light she often marks each prominent partnearly as vivid as those upon the foregroundsAt  the same time the shadows being suppressed and every little detail the object takes it's proper place in the distance notwithstanding it's strong illuminationYet even in a distance he will observe a variety of little animated touches which give it life and spirit He will study nature's mode of expressing these touchesthe tuftings of the forest the rough∣ness of the mountain and the stillness of the lakeHe will observe also what disposition of sky gives that cold blue tint to a removed country which we sometimes seewhat again gives it that clearness in which the very delineation of every object may be dis∣cernedand what throws over it that greyish tint the sweetest of all hues that invest a distance and gives it that amusing indistinct∣ness which leads the imagination of the spectator to  body forth  The forms of things scarce seen  Turn them to shape and give to airy nothing  A local habitation  As we descended Gunnersby hill and saw more around it a distinct view of Belvoircastle opened on the left and we could have wished to have examined that noble repository  of the works of eminent masters but our time would not allow  As we got more into the flat country we found that however qualified it's objects were to melt into a beautiful distance it contain∣ed nothing engaging on the spot All the country through which the Trent flows as far as we could command it from the great road is unpicturesque  Newark was formerly defended by a castle which is now but an unpleasing ruin It has more the appearance of a dwelling than a for∣tress It was once however a considerable place and at the conclusion of the civil wars sustained a siege of seven months from the whole Scotch army during which period in the necessity of the times those shillings in the form of lozenges were stamped which are now found in collections of old coins They bear a crown on one side inscribed C R and on the other mark the occasion of their being struck Here also began that infamous treaty for the sale of the king who had delivered himself into the hands of the Scotch army of which the whole nation hath deservedly  of which the whole nation hath deservedly been ashamed ever since  From Newark the country still continues dreary and uninteresting When the road happens to make any little rise we had far to the right a distant view of Lincolncathe∣dral over the flats between it and the eye It is so noble a pile that it makes a respec∣table object at the distance of twenty miles But this extraordinary appearance is owing to a mere deception for tho the eye con∣siders it as standing in the plain it stands in fact upon a hill and the elevation of the ground being lost in the distance all it's height is added to the church The whole country between Newark and Lincoln is highly cul∣tivated and is famous for a breed of large sheep and heavy horses peculiar to itself A little after you pass Tuxford you see the deception in the situation of Lincolncathe∣dral It appears there plainly to stand at the point of a long ridge of elevated land rising above the flat country  In this neighbourhood lie a cluster of great houses Thoresby belongs to the celebrated  duchess of Kingston We rode through the park which has no advantages of situation The house we found shut up by the duchess's order  Welbeck the duke of Portland's seat we did not see It lay some miles out of the road  Clumberpark the seat of the duke of Newcastle disappointed us We expected an old magnificent house a park adorned with oaks that had seen a fourth or a fifth generation of their noble owners and other appendages of ancient grandeur But every thing is new the house is just built the woods just planted and the walks just planned Clumberpark will hardly be worth a tra∣veller's notice before the next century  A few miles farther lies Worksop This house is a singular instance of the spirit perseverance and disinterestedness of it's pro∣prietor the duke of Norfolk It had belonged formerly to the earls of Shrewsbury and was gone much into decay But the duke liking the situation and conceiving it to be a good centrehouse to his great estates in these parts resolved to restore it to it's ancient splendor He was now in years but for the advan∣tage of his heir the honourable Mr Edward  Howard he engaged in the work and having fitted it up in a very noble manner at the expence of thirty thousand pounds he was just preparing to take possession of it when on the d of October a fire left care∣lessly in the library caught hold of the flooring of the apartment and communi∣cating itself with great rapidity to the other chambers the whole edifice and all it's valuable furniture pictures and books were burnt to the ground The loss was estimated at an hundred thousand pounds  Such a catastrophe one should have ima∣gined might have checked the duke's farther designs in building but it only roused him Almost before the ashes of the old house were cold he engaged again in building a new one and taking his young heir in his hand he laid the foundation stone of a most magnificent pile on the th of March It was to consist of a centre and two wings With this work he went on so rapidly that the centre part as it now stands which is itself a complete palace extending three hun∣dred feet was finished in the year At that time Mr Edward Howard dying the  duke who built only for him dropt all farther thoughts of compleating his design  The house stands in the midst of an exten∣sive park but we saw nothing that tempted us to take more than a cursory view of it The approach seemed easy and beautiful  A few miles from Worksop on the bor∣ders of Yorkshire lies Aston where Mr Mason with a generosity rather singular has built at his own expence one of the most comfortable and elegant parsonagehouses in England The old house which is shrouded with trees is converted into offices while the new house consists intirely of excellent apartments In this sweet retreat we spent a day or two and from thence made an ex∣cursion to Rocheabbey a beautiful scene in the possession of the earl of Scarborough  SECT III  ROCHEABBEY stands in the centre of three vallies each of which is about a mile in length but otherwise their dimen∣sions as well as forms are different One is open another is close and a third still closer and rocky All of them are woody and each is adorned with it's little stream  A very small part of the abbey remains two fragments only of the transept of the great church The architecture is rather of a mixed kind but in general the Gothic prevails  These ruins and the scenery around them were in the roughest state when Mr Brown was employed to adorn them He is now at work and has nearly half compleated his intention This is the first subject of the kind he has attempted Many a modern palace he has adorned and beautified but  a ruin presented a new idea which I doubt whether he has sufficiently considered He has finished one of the vallies which looks towards Laughton spire he has floated it with a lake and formed it into a very beautiful scene But I fear it is too magnificent and too artificial an appendage to be in unison with the ruins of an abbey An abbey it is true may stand by the side of a lake and it is possible that  this  lake may in some future time become it's situation when the marks of the spade and the pickax are removed when it's osiers flourish and it's naked banks become fringed and covered with wood In a word when the lake itself is improved by time it may suit the ruin which stands upon it's banks At present the lake and ruin are totally at varianceThe spire which ter∣minates this view deserves particular notice as a very beautiful piece of Gothic architecture tho the ornament only of a country church It is also one of the most extensive land marks in England and may in some directions be seen at the distance of fifty miles  Mr Brown is now at work in the centre part of the three vallies near the ruin itself He has already removed all the heaps of rub∣bish  which lay around some of which were very  ornamental  and very  useful  also in uniting the two parts of the ruin They give something too of more consequence to the  whole  by discovering the vestiges of what once existed Many of these scattered appendages also through length of time having been co∣vered with earth and adorned with wild brushwood had risen up to the windows and united the  ruin to the soil  on which it stoodAll this is removed a level is taken and the ruin stands now on a neat bowlinggreen like a house just built and without any kind of  connection  with the ground it stands on There is certainly little judgment shewn in this mode of improvement I do not mean to place Mr Brown's works at Rocheabbey and those of a late improver of Fountain'sabbey  See observations on the mountains and lakes of Cum∣berland c v II p  in the same light At Fountain'sabbey every thing was done with a childish hand Here every thing is manly and in it's way masterly The  character  only of the scene is mistaken If Mr Brown  should proceed a step fartherpull down the ruin and build an elegant mansion every thing would then be right and in it's pro∣per place But in a  ruin  the reigning ideas are  solitude neglect  and  desolation  The environs of a house should partake of the elegance or grandeur of the mansion they adorn  because  harmony and propriety require it If there is force in  this  reason it surely holds equally true that a ruin should be left in a state of wildness and negligence Har∣mony and propriety require one as much as the other  Of what improvement then is the scenery of a ruin capable  Of some no doubt Tho we should not wish to adorn it with  polished nature  tho the shorn lawn the flowering shrub and the embellished walk are alien ideas yet many things  offensive  may be removed  Some part  of the rubbish or of the brushwood may be out of place and hide what ought to be seen The ground in many parts may be altered but discretely altered A path may wind but not such grand walks as are here intro∣duced rather for parade than contemplation and such certainly as the convent never knew  even in it's highest state of prosperity Trees also may be planted and water may be in∣troduced But a sort of negligent air should run through the whole and if art should  always be concealed  it should here be  totally hid  The precept conveyed in those beautiful lines cannot be  too religiously  applied to scenes like these  If art  E'er dares to tread 'tis with unsandal'd foot  Printless as if the place were holy ground  No sunk fence or netted barrier should re∣strain the flock Let them browze within the very precincts of the ruin It is a habi∣tation forsaken of men and resumed by nature and tho nature do not require a  slovenly  path to walk in yet she always wishes for one with  some degree of rudeness  about it  If the mansionhouse stand near the ruins you wish to adorn the ruins themselves will then become only  appendages  Neatness in part  must  be introduced Yet still even in this case one should wish to have the ruins in a sequestered place less adorned than the environs of a mansion ought to be  There is another species of improvement of which a ruin is susceptible but it is of  the most delicate kind Few ruins are exactly what we could wish We generally find a  deficiency  or a  redundancy  as far as  composition  is concerned The ruin we now consider from the squareness and uniformity of its two parts is heavy uniform and displeasing The parts are elegant in themselves but for want of contrast they form a disagreeable whole You can see them to advantage only from particular stands where one part is thrown behind another in perspective By the small alteration therefore of making either part  lower  or  higher  you might improve the composition but the operation would be exceedingly nice No picturesque hand durst  take away  But an addition might be made without much hazard because what you  add  you may like∣wise  remove  The  beauty of the composition  and the  harmony of the architecture  would be the two chief points to be attended to The ruins of Rocheabbey might receive great beauty from the fragment of a tower If this or any other prominent addition could happily be made it would certainly have a good effect but it would require great knowledge both of the ruin and it's deficient appendages to make it with propriety and verisimilitude  Of the three vallies which center in these ruins I have mentioned one only which Mr Brown has yet improved Both the others are beautiful but one of them which is a sort of rocky chasm is  in it's natural state  so pleasing that I should fear every touch of art would be injurious  I shall conclude these remarks on the im∣provement of ruins with a few beautiful  images of desolation  which the prophet Isaiah introduces in subjects of this kind  His  ruins have their proper accompaniments The pas∣sages I quote are interspersed in different chap∣ters but I shall bring them together in one view  "It shall never be inhabited neither shall the Arabian pitch his tent there nor the shepherd make his fold Thorns shall come up in it's palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof The cormorant and the bittern shall possess it The raven shall dwell there It shall be an habitation for dragons and a court for owls There the wild beasts of the desert shall meet The satyr shall cry to his fellow The screechowl shall find herself a place of rest and the vultures shall be gathered together every one with it's mate"  SECT IV  FROM Rocheabbey we proceeded to Wakefield and from thence to Leeds where we visited another scene of a similar kind the ruins of Kirkstallabbey which belong to the duke of Montague  Three miles from Leeds the river Aire taking it's course in an eastern direction passes through a valley which is about five miles in length and one in breadth The area of it is level This form gives a sluggishness to the stream which instead of sparkling over beds of pebbles as the northern rivers commonly do is adorned with reeds and sedges and waterlilies The hills which slope into the valley descend in different directions in some parts they are steep but in general their descent is easy Formerly  when this valley was the retreat of solitude all these hills were covered with wood which formed delicious bowers in various parts and descending in clumps around the abbey skreened it from inclement blasts Now these beautiful skreens are removed the abbey stands exposed and the ancient limits of the woods are scarce marked by a few scattered trees All the interval is divided into portions and furrowed by the plough  At the bottom of the valley near the southern bank of the river stand the ruins of the abbey a very large proportion of which is still left Almost the whole body of the great church remains which seems to want little except the roof The tower is still intire and the cross aile A variety of ruined buildings are scattered round the uses of which are guessed at rather than ascer∣tained Some of them are in sufficient repair to answer modern purposes On the south are the traces of a beautiful Gothic cloister  With regard however to the stile in general of the abbey of Kirkstall and it's picturesque form but little can be said It is composed of a sort of mixed architecture Here and there you see a piece of Gothic has been  added but in the greater part the Saxon heaviness prevails The pillars in the nave are massy and void of grace The form too of the ruin is unpleasing It is debased by the commonness of it You have merely the shell of an old church It is too perfect also We rather wish for that degree of dilapidation which gives conjecture room to wander and the imagination some little scope A certain degree of obscurity adds dignity to an object  The precincts of the abbey were formerly surrounded by a wall as abbeys generally were the vestiges of which may still be traced The circumference of the whole is about a mile drawn round in a semicircular form the river compleating the boundary on the south In one part of this boundary north∣west of the abbey stands a gate which seems to have been the grand entrance It is yet a considerable pile and makes an excellent farmhouse  As we were examining the ruins our guide pointed to a very narrow winding staircase at the west end of the church which led formerly to the roof Into this staircase he told us a cow pushing herself probably at first  to avoid the flies at length gained the top and was discovered by her owner looking through the broken arch of a window which he shewed us where a narrow shelf had formerly supported the roof The man had no expectation of seeing his beast again at the bottom without broken bones but such was her dexterity that with a very little assistance she got down by the same narrow passage by which she had ascendedAs this story belongs to the natural history of the place I have recorded it but rather I must confess with a view to discredit it than to authen∣ticate There are so many stories told of cows climbing up narrow staircases among ruins that they destroy each other One is told at Norwich and I remember at the abbey of Lanercost in Cumberland a cow not only got up a narrow staircase but rang a bell at an unseasonable hour by which she alarmed the whole neighbourhood Why this unwieldy animal is fixed on for these feats of activity I can assign no reason but that it makes the story more wonderful  From Leeds to Harrowgate the landscape is seldom interesting  See an account of this country in vol II p of Ob∣servations on the lakes and mountains of Cumberland c  but on crossing the river Need we found ourselves in a very pleasant country Few villages stand more agreeably than Ripley  The passage over the mountains of Stain∣more has very little in it that is amusing till we come to a flat near the close of it where tradition says Maidencastle formerly stood tho no vestiges of it now remain  From this elevated ground the eye com∣mands a noble sweep of mountainscenery The hills sloping down on both sides form a vast bay of wide and distant country which consists of various removes and is bounded at length by the mountains of Cumberland The lines are elegant and the whole picturesque as far as a distance inriched neither by wood nor any other object can be so The scene tho naked is immensely grand It has a good effect in it's present state uniting a dreary distance with the dreary country we had passed and the wild foreground on which we stood We might perhaps have a better  effect if the distance were more inriched The beauties of  contrast  would then succeed happily to those of  uniformity  at least if the middle ground or second distance were somewhat rough and the landscape proceeded gradually from that roughness into a rich distance  Appelbycastle Broughamcastle and other parts of the road between Appelby and Pen∣rith which is in general pleasing afforded us many views but we had travelled the country before as we had likewise the country about Carlisle  See observations on the lakes c vol II    SECT V  AT Longtown which is seven miles be∣yond Carlisle we crossed the Esk and soon entered Scotland taking the Langham road to Edinburgh The Esk is properly a Scottish river flowing along a small part only of the English border but along a con∣siderable part of the Edinburg road In a few miles it is joined by the Liddel and at the confluence of these streams a sort of pro∣montory is formed on which stand the ruins of a fort called in the country the  Strength of Liddel  It is supposed to have been a Roman station and was once the curb of the country It commands a very extensive view which presents if not a picture at least a map well adapted to mili∣tary speculation  In after times when other oppressors succeeded those of Rome prevailing factions  of Picts and Britons Scotts and English had it alternately in possession As con∣temptible as it now appears it was twice besieged by royal armies once under Edward the third of England and again under David the second of Scotland It is shocking to huma∣nity that few of these places can be found without some horrid tale annexed to them When David took the place he condemned the governor to death That might be justice but it could only be through the dictates of vengeance that he ordered his two sons to be butchered before his eyes as he was led to execution And yet David according to Buchanan was a prince  in omni virtutum genere ac in primis clementia memorabilis  In later ages this country wanted a stronger curb then such a fortress as the  Strength of Liddel  could impose It was an almost sin∣gular instance in the history of civil society that a paltry district should continue in an independent state between two powerful kingdoms inhabited by clans of banditti alike obnoxious to each and not to be sub∣dued by the police of both Their captains lived in fortified castles bad defiance to the power of a sheriff and feared only the attack  of regular troops The importance of these borderchiefs is well described in an old ballad which does honour to Johnny Armstrong who was in his day one of the most celebrated of them This hero having been sent for in the year by James the fifth who was then upon a progress to the borders came unexpectedly into the royal presence magni∣ficently apparelled and attended by a numerous train of followers The poet introduces him in this dignified manner  When Johnny came before the king  With his eightscore men so gallant to see  The king he moved his bonnet to him  For he thought he'd been a king as well as he  Numbers of the lower members of this plun∣dering community were executed every year both in England and Scotland but no depopulation ensued A livelihood from other men's labours and an asylum from the penal laws were powerful incentives to the idle and profligate of both kingdoms and fully repaired such casual depredations as were annually made by the hand of justice  In Edward the sixth's time about the year the affair of the  debatable land  as this coun∣try was called seems to have been taken into  serious consideration The plan was to divide it into two equal parts that each kingdom might introduce order into it's respective di∣vision Commissioners for this purpose were appointed and a letter is still preserved in which the English commissioners inform the council that  there be two small brooks in the debatable the one called Hawburn the other Woodhouseburn whereof the former falleth into the river Sark and the other into the river Esk and they wish the division might be made from the mouth of one of these brooks to that of the other  See Hayne's state papers p  This division they explain by a plan sent along with their letter  having  they say  three lines drawn across the debatable The first towards the seaside expresseth the division which the Scottish commissioners offered the second being the middle line and named by us  STELLATA LINEA  representeth the division whereof we now write and the third is that which our commissioners offered to the Scotts  The  stellata linea  seems to have been some abatement of what had been offered to the Scotts but the commissioners still think  that rather than leave the matter undone they should relent somewhat even of the said  STEL∣LATA LINEA  but so that the two houses of stone the one being Sandy Armstrong's the other Thomas Greme's may be within the limits of the English debatable  How far this good work proceeded does not appear it is certain however that it produced no effect for throughout the reign of Elizabeth we meet with numberless instances of the continuance of these border depredations Sufficient employment perhaps could not be found for these borderers in the infancy of arts and tillage which certainly meliorate the manners of a savage people and to a certain period at least till luxury is introdu∣ced supply the place of penal laws  As we passed through the  debatable land  we were often amused with the sweet vallies of the Esk which make the road generally pleasant if not interesting Most of these vallies are well wooded and the trees tho far from what may be denominated  timber  are yet sufficient to beautify the scene  In one of these retreats stands Gilnochall the ancient castle of Johnny Armstrong  We met with many of these little fortresses in different parts of the borders They are commonly built in the form of square towers The walls are thick the apertures for light small They are divided generally into three or four stories each containing only one apartment The lowest was the receptacle for cattle which were driven into it in time of alarm The family occupied the upper stories As these towers were chiefly meant as places of security against the banditti of the country the garrison had seldom more than the siege of an hour or two to sustain They could bear therefore crouding together and were not anxious about their magazines If they were attacked by any of the neigh∣bouring garrisons they could make no defence  Sir Robert Cary earl of Monmouth gives us an account in his memoirs written in the time of Elizabeth of his manner of attacking one of these old towers He was warden of the western march and lay with his garrison at Carlisle where hearing of an outrageous act committed by some Scotts he pursued them with twenty horse When he came  up with them he found they had taken refuge in a tower In this exigence his horse was of little use except to prevent an escape He sent therefore to Carlisle for a few foot and  presently set them at work to get up to the top of the tower and to uncover the roof and then some twenty of them to fall down together and by that means to win the tower The Scotts seeing their present danger offered to parley and opening the iron gate yielded themselves to mercy  Gilnochall is probably what the commis∣sioners call the  house of stone of Sandy Armstrong  It has still a castlelike form but it's situ∣ation which is under a woody hill is rather that of an abbey than of a castle As it had nothing however to do with the defence of the country but only to take care of itself a sequestered situation might suit it best  Besides the Esk we met with many rivu∣lets each of which in it's turn hath run purple to the sea with the blood of our ancestors If the borders were subject to constant ravages in the time of peace we may well suppose what they were in time of  war The borderers were expert in all the arts of rapine and plundering and having on both sides a national antipathy wanted only a pretence to indulge it The ravages that were committed when open hostility commenced between the two kingdoms by the regular garrisons of both were so ruinous and so frequent that we are astonished how countries so often desolated could be worth plundering  Among Haynes's state papers we have the history of one of these irregular cam∣paigns in the time of Henry the eighth under the title of  Exploits done upon the Scotts in the year  The first  exploit was done  on the d of July and the last on the th of November Between these two dates which include little more than four months is contained an account of ninetyseven dif∣ferent inroads into the borders of Scotland which no doubt were repaid in kind by the Scotts tho probably not in so full a measure In each of these details the actors are specified the time the scene the mischief done and the booty obtained As the paper is curious two or three out of the  ninetyseven exploits  may be worth transcribing  July Mr Clifford and his garrison burned a town called Bedroul with fifteen or sixteen steds  Houses  whereby they have gotten three hundred nolt  Blackcattle  six hundred sheep and much inside gear  Housholdgoods  In their coming home they fought with lord Farnyhurst and his company and took him and his son with three basses which lord Farnyhurst brought into the field with him  August Sir Ralph Evers with the garrisons of the middle marches of Tinedale and Ridsdale to the number of fourteen hundred men rode and burnt Jedworth and Ancramspittle with two other towns called East Nesbit and West Nesbit and won divers strong castlehouses and slew all the Scottish men in the same to the number of eighty and brought away two hundred and twenty head of nolt and four hundred sheep with much inside goods  August William Buncton and John Ordre and certain of the garrison of Ber∣wick burnt and spoiled the town of Dun∣glasse very sore and seized three hundred  and twenty nolt eight hundred sheep and much spoilage In their return they fought with the Scotts and put them to flight and slew Alexander Hume and forty other good men and took the laird of Anderwicke and his son Hamilton and sixty more pri∣soners  August Sir Brian Layton c ranged the woods of Woddon where they got many nags sheep and nolt and slew in the said woods thirty Scotts From thence they went to a tower of lord Buc∣cleugh's called the Mosshouse and smoked it very sore and took thirty prisoners and have brought away eighty nags two hun∣dred nolt and four hundred sheep and they burned the town of Woddon and many shielings and houses in the said wood and other steds and mills in their way  I need not multiply extracts from this horrid catalogue in which the pillage ruin and slaughter of thousands of individuals contri∣buting nothing to the sum of the war are related with as much indifference as the bringing in of a harvest We consider war as a necessary evil and pride ourselves now on making it like gentlemen Humanity  certainly requires us to alleviate it's miseries as far as we can But while our wars by land are tempered with generosity why are our wars by sea carried on like barbarians Taking the ships of an enemy it is true destroys resources so would plundering a country and carrying away it's inhabitants captive in the old style of Babylonish con∣quest From this however we refrain by land tho we practice it by sea The great point of difference between the two services in this respect lies here By land all  private plunderers  and morauders which are the most cruel kind of oppressors are  restrained  by sea they are  licensed  or in other words by sea we still practise the brutality of Scotch and English borderers  SECT VI  WE travelled along the banks of the Esk many miles and found several beautiful scenes Near Langham particularly it winds through groves which diversify the road and it's bed is finely channelled with rock  The banks of the Tiviot soon after received us and conducted us into a new country On the borders of the Esk our views had been in general confined within contracted vallies But now the country began to ex∣pand and assumed features intirely different The Tiviot takes it's course through wide vallies of smooth extended pasturage sloping down to it in all directions and in general forming beautiful lines tho otherwise void of all those circumstances and that variety  of objects particularly of wood which give beauty to landscape In some parts these vallies also are contracted but in a different manner from those of the Esk The same breadth of feature is still preserved which we had in the more open parts only it is here brought nearer the eye Tho the lofty skreens rush down precipitately to the river and contract the vallies you see plainly they are the parts of a largefeatured country and in a stile of landscape very different from those little irriguous vallies which we had left  The downy sides of all these vallies are covered with sheep which often appear to hang upon immense green walls So steep is the descent in some parts that the eye from the bottom scarce distinguishes the slope from a perpendicular Several of these mountainous slopes for some of them are very lofty are finely tinted with mosses of different hues which give them a very rich surface This however is the garb only which nature wears at this season of the year She has a variety of dresses for all seasons and all so becoming that when she deposits one and assumes ano∣ther  she is always adorned with beauties peculiar to herself  Hawick has a romantic situation among rocks sounding rivers cataracts and bridges all of which are very picturesque When we meet with objects of this kind the result of nature and chance what contempt do they throw upon the laboured works of art There is more picturesque beauty in the old bridge at Hawick than in the most elegant piece of newmade river scenery I mean not to assert that such an object would suit a piece of improved ground It would there be out of place All I mean is that the picturesque eye has that kind of fastidiousness about it that it is seldom pleased with any artificial attempts to please It must find it's own beauties and often fixes as here on some accidental rough object which the common eye would pass unnoticed  As we proceeded to Selkirk we found the road on the north of Hawick a perfect contrast to what we had passed on the south There  we were carried along the vallies and looked up to the hills Here we were carried along the hills and looked down upon the vallies Here too in general the mountains formed beautiful lines but as in historypainting figures without drapery and other appendages make but an indifferent group so in scenery naked mountains form poor composition They require the drapery of a little wood to break the simplicity of their shapes to produce contrasts to connect one part with another and to give that richness in landscape which is one of it's greatest ornaments We are told indeed that this was formerly a very woody countrythat it was called the  forest of Selkirk  and extended over great part of the southern counties of Scotland And yet if this information did not depend on good historical authority we might be led to dispute it For people are seldom at the trouble of felling a forest unless they want either the timber or the ground it stands on neither of which in the present case seems to have been wanted  These mountains however unadorned as they appear are by no means void of beauty We had several pleasing views along the val∣lies  particularly one towards Sunderland hall where the river Atric plays round the pro∣montories of several sweeping mountains which guide it's course  A little beyond the Atric we meet the Tweed which is here a river of no great consequence but it's deficiency in  grandeur  is made up in  beauty  We travelled along it's banks about a mile and in that short space were entertained with two or three pleasing views the most striking of which were at Yar and Ferney  The house at Yar which belongs to the duke of Buccleugh is no object nor is the river visible in this view but the road winds beautifully to a bridge beyond which the mountains make agreeable intersections  At Ferney we had a grand scene of moun∣tainperspective It is not often that these elevated bodies coincide with the rules of beauty and compositionless often indeed than any other mode of landscape In a level country the awkwardness of a line is hid But the mountain rearing it's opakeness against the sky shews every fault both in it's deli∣neation and combination with great exactness These mountains however had few faults to  shew They were both wellformed and well connected and shewed also in great perfection the beauties of gradationgradation in formgradation in lightand gradation in colour With these adjuncts which are among the most beautiful in landscape the exhibition could not but be pleasing One of the nearest of these mountains was inriched when we saw it with a deep purple tint which did not seem the production of any vegetable substance but rather some enamelled mineral stain  It is no little recommendation of the rivers we met with here that almost every one of them is the subject of some pleasing Scotch ditty which the scene raises to the memory of those who are versed in the lyrics of the country The elegant simplicity of the verse and the soothing melody of the music in almost all the Scotch songs is universally acknowledged  Tweedside  and  Atric's banks  are not among the least pleasing  Beyond the Tweed the country becomes again mountainous wild and uncultivated in which state it continues till within thirteen or fourteen miles of Edinburgh A little beyond Middleton before we descended the  higher grounds into the plain we had a view from the brow of the hill of the situation of that capital  The plain is bounded by the Pentland hills which in themselves are not magnificent but appeared considerably so to us through the medium of a light mist which began to overspread the distance Deceptions of this kind are very common in mountainous coun∣tries Under such a circumstance I have often conceived myself about to ascend some stupen∣dous mountain which dwindled on a nearer approach into a mere hill On the right of the Pentland hills arises Arthur's seat a rock which hangs over Edinburgh of peculiar appearance romantic but not picturesque It continues long the striking feature of the view neither the castle nor any part of the town appearing for some time  As we approach nearer the environs of Edinburgh become more distinct We get a view of the Forth and see the grounds about Musselborough and Dalkeith on the southern side of it and the mountains of Fifeshire on the northern  About six or seven miles on this side or Edinburgh we turned a little out of the way to visit Dalkeith house which belongs to the duke of Buccleugh It stands on a knoll overlooking a small river The knoll is probably in part artificial for an awkward square hollow hard by indicates that the knoll has been dug out of it Beyond the river are woods and a picturesque view of the town and church of Dalkeith But the house fronts the other way where it is not only confined but the ground rises  from it  It might have stood with great advantage if it had been carried two or three hundred yards farther from the river and it's front turned towards it A fine lawn would then have descended from it bounded by the river and the woods We often see a bad situation chosen but we seldom see a good one so narrowly missed  There are several pleasing pictures in Dalkeithhouse one of the most striking is a landscape by Vernet in Salvator's style It is a rocky scene through which a torrent rushes the foaming violence of the water is well expressed I have not often met with a picture of this fashionable master which I  liked better And yet it is not entirely free from the flutter of a French artist  Here and in almost all the great houses of Scotland we have pictures of queen Mary but their authenticity is often doubted from the circumstance of her hair In one it is auburn in another black and in another yellow Notwithstanding however this dif∣ference it is very possible that all these pictures may be genuine We have a letter preserved  See Hayne's state papers p  from Mr White a servant of queen Elizabeth to Sir William Cecil in which he mentions his having seen queen Mary at Tutbury castle "  She is a goodly personage  says he  hath an alluring grace a pretty Scottish speech a searching wit and great mildness Her hair of itself is black but Mr Knolls told me that she wears hair of sundry colours  "  This house was formerly like most of the great houses in Scotland built in the form of a castle It belonged then to the noble family of Douglas and was once the gloomy retreat of a celebrated chief of that namethe earl of Morton who was regent of the kingdom  nominally  under James but  really  under Elizabeth That artful princess having imprisoned Mary conducted the affairs of Scotland through this minister as she pleased Elizabeth was not nice in the choice of her instruments Moral failings in men of abilities were no blemishes Morton's cha∣racter is marked in history with those vices which unbounded ambition commonly ingrafts upon the  fiercer passions  cruelty and revenge to which we may add an insatiable avarice Popular odium at length overpowered him and he found it necessary to retire from public life This castle was the scene of his retreat where he wished the world to believe he was sequestered from all earthly concerns But the terror he had impressed through the country during his power was such that the common people still dreaded him even in re∣tirement In passing towards Dalkeith they generally made a circuit round the castle which they durst not approach calling it the lion's den While he was thus supposed to be employed in making his parterres and forming his terraces he was planning a scheme for the revival of his power It suddenly took effect to the astonishment of all Scotland  But it was of short continuance In little more than two years he was obliged to retreat again from public affairs and ended his life on a Scaffold  SECT VIII  AS we approached Edinburgh from Dal∣keith the country around is woody and cultivated but it is cultivated in the Numidian fashion  praeter oppido propinqua alia omnia vasta atque inculta  Sal Bell Jug    A nearer approach did not give us a more pleasing idea of the environs of Edinburgh We had always heard it represented as one of the most picturesque towns in Britain but people often consider  romantic  and  picturesque  as synonymous Arthur's seat which is still the principal object appears still as odd mishapen and uncouth as before It gave us the idea of a cap of maintenance in heral∣dry and a view with such a staring feature in it can no more be picturesque than a face with a bulbous nose can be beautiful The  town and castle indeed on the left make some amends and are happily introduced In front also between the eye and Arthur's seat stands an old castlelike building called Craigmiller which has a good effect It is celebrated for being the scene where the unfortunate Mary repenting her rash match with Darnley would often retire from the public eye and indulge her melancholy in private Here too her imagination might draw a parallel between the brutal manners of that prince and those of the allobsequious Bothwell for whom her passion at this time is said to have taken root  But the situation of Edinburgh tho it can∣not be called picturesque is very peculiar The castle stands so loftily that it was called by the Romans the  alatum castrum  or the winged castle as if it stood in the air The rock is perpendicular on every side but the cast from whence it descends gently in a ridge through the space of a mile and a half into the plain below On this ridge which contains room only for one ample street the town is built From this form it is easy to conceive the different appearances which  Edinburgh presents on going round it As you approach from the south it appears like a grand city of noble extent As you move to the right it's size gradually diminishes But when you view it from the Musselborough road which is in a direction due east the street is gone and the houses are all crouded together as if they had retreated under the walls of the castle And yet the appearance of the town and castle thus united by per∣spective into one vast object is extremely grand If they had been seen before from no other situation and the ground plot unknown the imagination would have been totally lost in developing so strange a production of art Formerly the whole town was surrounded by water from which the French gave it the name of  L'isleburgh  But now the water is entirely drained off  The antiquity of Edinburgh cannot be traced but it's history easily may No times but those of anarchy and aristocratic confu∣sion could have fixed on such a situation for a capitala situation so extremely inconve∣nient that the town would long ago have left the craggy ridge it occupies and have de∣scended into the plain below which lies  perfectly commodious to receive it if the magistrates whose interest it is to keep it where it stands had not forcibly prohibited it's removal notwithstanding which it is in one part spreading into a noble city con∣structed on modern rules of symmetry and convenienceIt was not however till late in the Scottish annals that Edinburgh be∣came the seat of empire A situation south of the Forth was thought too much exposed to English inroads and tho it has now been long considered as the capital of Scotland it was never except occasionally the residence of the Scottish kings Perth had that honour anciently and Sterling in more modern times  The castle is almost the only object of picturesque curiosity in Edinburgh They who go to see it are commonly satisfied with being carried  into  it where they find a num∣ber of patched incoherent buildings without any beauty Scarce any thing in it deserves the least attention except the views from the batteries which are very amusing par∣ticularly those over the ForthBut he who would see Edinburghcastle in perfection must go to the bottom of the rock it stands on and walk round it In this view the  whole appears a very stupendous fabric The rock which is in itself an amazing pile is in many parts nobly broken and tho in it's whole immensity it is too large an object for a picture unless at a proper distance yet many of it's craggy corners with their watchtowers and other appendages are very picturesque  One part is particularly pleasing in which the bridge over the Northloch which is a noble piece of architecture is introduced in the distance like a Roman aquaduct  Holyrood house is a grand palace occu∣pying a large square The front consisting of a round tower on each side of the gate is of ancient architecture The body of the edifice was constructed by Sir William Bruce since the Grecian orders were introduced The gallery is a noble room It is a hundred and fortyseven feet long and twentynine broad and has that dark solemn ap∣pearance in which grandeur and dignity so much consist It is adorned with a succession of an hundred and eleven kings from Fergus the first to James the seventha series which  carries the Scottish monarchy in the ordinary scale of calculation not indeed quite to the times of Noah but above two thirds of the way Be the authenticity of these princes however what it may as they are all painted by one hand which has been no despicable one and in a dark style suited to the solemnity of the place they have all together a uni∣form and pleasing effect In this palace we were shewn the blood of David Riziothe chamber where the queen sat at supper when he was killedthe private door through which Ruthven entered in complete armour and the room into which Rizio was dragged adjoining to that in which the queen sat Such was the barbarity of those times that the lord high chancellor of Scotland the guar∣dian of it's laws himself joined with a band of ruffians in perpetrating this murder  Holyrood house was formerly an abbey as well as a royal mansion and among it's appendages are the ruins of a Gothic chapel which was once very beautiful Divine ser∣vice had ceased in it since the time of the reformation but it had long continued to be the burial place of some of the best families in Scotland and in honour of this sacred trust  it was some years ago repaired But the architects employed in the repairs had very different ideas from those who had been employed in the original structure A mo∣dern heavy roof was thrown over light airy Gothic walls the consequence of which was it crushed them On the night of the d of December a crash was heard by the inhabitants of the neighbour∣ing district and in the morning the roof walls and monuments were all blended in one confused mass of irretrievable ruin  This chapel is said to have been the most beautiful specimen of Gothic architecture in Scotland except one which still exists at Roslin in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh which through an unhappy mistake we did not see It was built about the year which was the age of the purest Gothic and therefore we could easily give credit to what we were told of the beauty of it's con∣struction It's sides are supported by but∣tresses like King's Collegechapel and West∣minsterabbey but in a stile still richer than either of those structures  At Roslin also stand the ruins of a castle built on a projecting rock which overlooks  a deep valley The whole we were told affords a very beautiful scene  Arthur's seat presents an unpleasing view from every station Some formal part stares you in the face in every corner of Edin∣burgh You rarely meet even with a pic∣turesque fragment It's great regularity has in part been owing to the streets of London which were paved from it's bowels A girdle of quarry running round it adds to it's for∣mality  This rocky hill was once probably a pic∣turesque scene for it was once we were informed covered with wood But this was then thought so great a nuisance that we were told there is still existing an ancient record from which it appears that every man who would take buildingtimber from Arthur's seat should be indulged with the privilege of projecting his house over the street  SECT VIII  FROM Edinburgh we took the Sterling road along the Forth which afforded us a great variety of pleasing views  In one of the most pleasing the castle of Garvy is introduced standing near the wateredge at the point of a promontory which seems to be formed by the high lands on the northern side of the Forth This how∣ever is only it's apparent situation In fact it stands upon an island the insularity of which is intirely hid In this place the Forth becomes a narrow strait of about two miles over and Garvycastle which occupies the midchannel was intended for it's defence It commands a view of the whole Forthon the west as far as Sterlingand on the east as far as the isle of May On the southern shore of this strait stands Queen'sferry from whence the Forth widens again into a con∣siderable  bay on the west The whole scenery is indeed very pleasing and to those who had time to examine it as it deserves would afford very beautiful views  Hoptonhouse is the next great object we meet The first view of it from the road at a distance over a bay of the Forth is very picturesque It appears behind a sloping hill which hides one of it's wings The horizontal lines of the house and the diverg∣ing lines of the hill accord agreeablyA regular building always appears best when thus connected with some irregular object A new source of beauty arises from the con∣trast and indeed without it a regular building has seldom a good effect When the artist therefore is under the necessity of painting a modern house he is under the necessity also of breaking it's regularity at least with a few branches of trees if he have nothing else at hand Square lines and angles uncontrasted can never be picturesque  As we approach Hoptonhouse it's situ∣ation appears very grand It is seated on a magnificent lawn which forms a kind of  Situation of  HOPETON HOUSE  terrace along the Forth This lawn extends more than a mile in the front of the house and at the extremity of it the Forth which is still a noble estuary making a bold sweep winds round it and presents the appearance of a wide extensive lake interspersed with islands and enlivened with a variety of ship∣ping  Behind the house the ground is more various breaking into hills vallies and promontories which shoot into the Forth All the grounds to a considerable extent appear planted and adorned and the house is very judiciously flanked with wood against the north winds which attack it from the Forth  On this side as well as in front the Forth appears in various shapes assuming sometimes the form of a lake and sometimes of a river according to the point from which it is seen The former shape it assumes when it is seen in lengthened perspective the latter when it is viewed directly across Under both ideas it is equally grand  Around this vast and magnificent scenery arise mountains in various forms and at various distances In short the whole scene and all it's appendages on every side as far  as the eye can traverse is great and noble and the house is so fixed as to receive the full advantage of it's situation  With regard to  improvements  indeed little can be said  That is little could be said in the year when we saw it It may by this time have undergone many changes  The old ideas of formality still exist and have taken full possession of the environs of the house But they might easily be displaced There is so much depth in the woods so much variety in the ground and so much space on every side that the whole scene is capable of any im∣provement  The house is a very magnificent piece of architecture It was begun by Sir William Bruce the most celebrated architect  That is little could be said in the year when we saw it It may by this time have undergone many changes  the Scotch ever had and finished by Mr Adam The latter I believe added the wings which are a great ornament to it That wing which appears in the view next to the Forth is a range of stables The other which is hid is intended for a library but it is not yet finished When it is compleat it will be a  Colin Campbell tho a Scotchman was an English architect  very noble room Some of the other rooms also are grand but in general the apart∣ments are smaller than we should expect to find in so magnificent a structure nor does the contrivance of the house seem equal to the beauty of the architecture  The pictures of which there is a numer∣ous collection have been chosen with good taste but most of them were undersized Little pictures give a littleness even to a grand room A suitableness even in these things should be observed  From Hoptonhouse we still continued our ride along the Forth and were entertained for some miles with views of the woods and grounds belonging to the noble mansion we had left  Many natural beauties also we sawhills and promontories and winding bays which had a fine effect in nature and tho deficient in point of objects to characterize each scene they were still accommodated to the pencil A country may please the eye in all it's naked and unadorned rudeness but when a portion of it is selected for a view it's features must  be uncommonly striking if it can support itself without the ornament of some artificial object which both characterizes a scene and adds dignity to it The natural beauties of this country in a great degree rendered these appendages unnecessary We had many noble views formed by the Forth and it's lofty shores which would have made good pictures tho unsupported by artificial objects And yet in some parts we found objects also  One view of this kind we had which was very picturesque It was a view of Blacknesscastle which shooting a considerable way into the lake forms a bay between it and the eye This bay is one of the noblest inland harbours in Scotland and the castle was its defence It preserved also the communication by water between Sterling and Edinburgh In after times it became a state prison and if fame speaks truth could unfold during the religious dissentions of the country many a tale of cruelty  Objects often owe their happiest effects to accidental circumstances and among others as we have often observed to evening suns Let the picturesque traveller watch for these effects and attend closely to them when he  finds them accompanied with a noble land∣scape We had this accompaniment at Black∣nesscastle The sun was now set and the shades of evening were more and more effacing that ruddy glow which had not yet left the horizon Right against this fading splendor rose the towers of the castle The outline appeared very distinct but all the detail and surface were lost in obscurity while the land∣scape around was overspread with that grey and dubious tint which brought the whole into the exactest harmony  From hence we directed our course to Fal∣kirk At Linlithgow which lies in the road the kings of Scotland had formerly one of their noblest palaces in the number and grandeur of which they seem to have equalled any princes in Europe This palace stands on a rising ground running into a lake a situation which can rarely fail of pleasing but we were prevented by the weather from taking such a view of it as we wished In this palace was born the celebrated Mary queen of Scots  In Linlithgow the house is still shewn from whence the earl of Murray regent of Scot∣land  was shot as he passed along the street It was one of the most deliberate assassinations upon record Scotland during the impri∣sonment of Mary was divided by vio∣lent factions The earl of Murray and his adherents sided against the queen the house of Hamilton supported her A gentleman of this name and family inflamed both by party and a very flagrant private injury re∣solved to destroy the regent He had long attended his motions to find a favourable op∣portunity and at length determined to shoot him as he passed through Linlithgow in his way from Sterling to Edinburgh The regent was riding leisurely through the high street talking with a gentleman on his left hand when a musket was fired suddenly from a window on the right and the regent receiving the ball fell dead over his horse's neck The house from whence the blow came was immediately assaulted but the front door being barricaded could not immediately be forced Hamilton in the mean time mounted a swift horse which stood ready at a postern and escaped  From Falkirk we still continued our rout to Sterling In our way we crossed the great canal which forms the northern part of Scot∣land into an island by joining the frith of Clyde with that of Forth Busy man is ever at work grubbing the soil on which he exists sometimes casting up heaps and sometimes throwing them down A few centuries ago the bands of Agricola were as eager in raising this very spot into a rampart as our contem∣poraries are now in delving it into a canal Both works were great efforts of human power but the British seems to be the greater It was a mighty work no doubt to raise an earthen mound sufficient to confine a nation but it is still perhaps a greater work to in∣troduce a new element and bring the sloops of the ocean to land their cargoes among the inland mountains of the countryAs a useful and humane work however the modern one is beyond all doubt more respectable inasmuch as it is more conducive to the hap∣piness of mankind to open a communication between one country and another than to block a nation up in it's barbarity and shut  it out from every opportunity of knowledge and improvementIn a picturesque light I know not whether to call the Roman or the British work more disgusting Both equally deform the natural face of the coun∣try  In this neighbourhood are still to be traced the works of Agricola Some parts of the mound which he threw up and fortified between the Forth and the Clyde are still visible and known by the name of  Graham's dyke  The antiquarian also traces many forts in different parts where this mound ran ca∣pable of containing an army It is not how∣ever generally supposed that these were all the works of Agricola but that other gene∣rals who succeeded him made additions to what he had done  Among these remains on the banks of the Carron one of the most remarkable was an edifice the use and origin of which exceed∣ingly puzzled antiquarians It was a rotunda open at the top like the Pantheon at Rome tho of very inferior workmanship and dimen∣sions From the ground to the summit of the dome it measured twentytwo feetthe diameter in the inside was nineteen and an  half Boethius is the chief historian who gives us any account of it's more perfect state He tells us that it's area within was sur∣rounded by stone seatsthat on the south was an altar and that the floor had been tesselated The common people called it Ar∣thur's oven but many antiquarians have sup∣posed it to have been a temple built for the god Terminus by Agricola on his fixing here the boundaries of the Roman empire This valuable piece of antiquity was destroyed by the proprietor Sir Michael Bruce in the year for the sake of the stone with which it was constructed The deed raised such indignation in Dr Stukely that I have heard he drew Sir Michael carrying off his lap full of stones and the devil goading him along This drawing miserable as we may suppose it from such an artist was en∣graved I believe and published by the anti∣quarian society in their repertory  In the neighbourhood of the new canal are the great forges of the Carronworks which exhibit a set of the most infernal ideas In one place where coal is converted into coke  by discharging it of sulphur and the fire spread of course over a large surface the volumes of smoke the spiry flames and the suffocating heat of the glimmering air are wonderfully affecting How vast the fire is we may conceive when we are told it consumes often a hundred tons of coal in a day At night it's glare is inconceivably grand  In another part of these works we admired the massy bellows which rouse the furnaces They are put in motion by water and re∣ceiving the air in large cylinders force it out again through small orifices roaring with astonishing noise The fire of the furnace thus roused becomes a  glowing spot  which the eye can no more look at than at the sun Under such intense heat the rugged stone instantly dissolves in streams of liquid iron  Among the horrid ideas of this place it is not the least that you see every where black sooty figures wheeling about in iron wheelbarrows molten metal glowing hot  Within less than a mile from the Carronworks was fought the battle of Falkirk The workmen pointing out the place on a moor bad us observe upon the highest part of it two small houses together and one at a dis∣tance  between these they said the principal attack was made tho I believe  now  Falkirk∣moor is inclosed and cultivated and the scene of action perhaps scarcely to be traced  In    As we approach Sterling the Forth con∣tracting it's dimensions loses the form of an estuary and takes that of a river but we leave it's banks and afterwards have only distant views of it and these by degrees be∣came less frequent The country through which we travelled was in general flat and barren of objects except that here and there we had a mountain scene in the offskip In one part we saw the remains of an old fortress called Briscastle which rather diversified an uninteresting scene  SECT IX  THE castle of Sterling tho an object of great importance makes no appearance till we approach within three miles of it It has the air of the castle of Edinburgh only instead of the formality of Arthur's seat the background here is a simple mountain There is nothing very beautiful in the scenery around it but an object of such consequence will give dignity to any scene  As we approach nearer and the castle comes forward from the back ground it appears with still more dignity  Viewed upon the spot the  outside  of it is very inferior to the castle of Edinburgh The rock on which it stands has neither the height the circumference nor the broken surface of that superb fortress But if it be inferior on the outside it is infinitely grander  within  Edinburgh castle is only a collection  of barracks magazines and officers houses whereas in Sterlingcastle you find very noble remains of royal magnificence It was often the residence of the kings of Scotland Almost the whole minority of James the sixth under his tutor Buchanan was spent here and in troublesome times it was always a place of refuge to the distresses of majesty Accord∣ingly it contains all the accompaniments of a regal residence a palace a chapel and a parliament house The palace in the inside is totally without form being now converted into barracks but on the outside it is very richly and curiously adorned with grotesque figures The chapel is an elegant and simple pile and the parliament house is a very magnificent room it is one hundred and twenty feet in length and lofty in proportion At the entrance of the castle the palaces of the earls of Argyle and Mar stand like two royal supporters They are now indeed in ruins but they have once been very sump∣tuous buildings  The views from the castle are in general over a barren and uninteresting country but  amends is made by the superior excellence of one of them over the Forth which has always been esteemed the most celebrated view in Scotland It is not indeed picturesque but it is exceedingly grand and amusing You overlook a flat valley of vast extent stretching almost as far as Edinburgh through which the windings of the Forth are very intricate and curious From the castle gate to Alloa it is four miles by land but if you go by water it is above twenty Through a few of the first large peninsular sweeps the eye can follow the course of the river but afterwards all becomes confused and broken into patches of land and water At Alloa the river is a mile broad at Sterling it is contained within four arches Through the whole of this vast channel the tide winds as through a great gut But it is a sedgy impure stream the flux and reflux of the tide continually mixing the soil with it's waters and stirring up the mud It is navigated as far as Sterling by ships of seventy or eighty tons but if they trust to their sails alone through the course of this sinuous navigation they must wait for the benefit of every wind round the compass two or three times over  The valley through which the Forth makes these uncommon windings tho not a rich one is by no means barren It is varied with wood in several parts with villages also and other buildings among which the abbey of Cambuskenneth is conspicuous Of this ruin nothing now remains but a single tower On the right this valley which is wide in proportion to it's length is bounded only by high grounds but on the left it is more nobly confined by the mountains of Ochil and Clackmannan  There are few countries perhaps on the face of the earth of such narrow dimensions as Scotland which have been the scenes of a greater variety of military events Invasions from Norway from Denmark and from Irelandirruptions from the Roman barrier together with the various feuds and animo∣sities among the Scotch themselves which have been more frequent than among any other people have deluged the country through different periods in blood But above all the constant quarrels between the Scotch and English which were generally  decided in Scotland have made it a fertile scene of military events to which several have been added by rebellions since the union In fact you can hardly ascend any elevated ground without throwing your eye over the scene of some memorable action  As the castle of Sterling has for many ages been a fortress we are not surprized that it's neighbourhood abounds with scenes of this kind Many a siege it has sustained one through the space of a whole year against the puissant arms of Edward the first Not fewer I believe than a dozen fields of battle may be counted from it's walls Of the four great battles which were fought by the two first Edwards in support of their tyranny in Scotland three were in the vicinity of this castle  Within two years after the battle of Dunbar in which Edward the first broke the power of Scotland the spirit of Wallace roused the Scotch again to arms Edward was then in France but a large force under earl Warren endeavoured to quell them A battle was fought under the walls of Sterling in which Wallace was victorious  This success drew Edward out of France He entered Scotland at the head of a large army and at the memorable battle of Falkirk fought in the year broke it's power a second time  The famous battle of Bannocburn was the last of these four great battles and was fought within two miles of Sterling This was the most glorious action in the whole annals of Scotland as it entirely freed it from the English yokePhilip of Mowbray held this fortress for Edward the second which was almost the only fortress he possessed Mowbray was hard pressed by the Scotts and had pro∣mised to capitulate if he was not relieved by such a day Edward in the mean time resolved to relieve him and entered Scotland with an army much greater than had ever entered it before Many historians rate it at one hundred thousand men which number however is wholly incredible Early on the morning of the th of June the English army was descried from the castle marching in gallant array to relieve them The Scotch army well posted lay between The walls were crouded with anxious spectators Very soon the English cavalry led on by the earl  of Gloucester was seen to push forward and begin the attack But they were presently repulsed Immediately after the whole field was seen in confusion but from what cause could not at that distance be conjectured This confusion soon ended in a total rout The English army fled and the Scotts with all their force pursued The case was the horse had been decoyed into pitfalls where many of them being overthrown the rest fell back with confusion on the main body The disorder was still farther increased by the ap∣pearance of a new army marching round their flanks tho in fact it was artfully composed only of suttlers furnished with military en∣signs The lowest accounts make the English to have lost on that day ten thousand men The earl of Gloucester was killed and the king himself with difficulty escaped  As we stood upon the seven gun battery an old gunner shewed us the situation of the rebels and their intrenchments when they attacked the castle in the year Blakeney the governor brought two or three of his bat∣teries to bear upon a piece of rising ground between him and their works which he took it for granted they would endeavour to occupy  The spot is so near that you may throw a stone upon it from the walls Then feigning intimidation he ordered his men to lie close till the rebels among whom he saw every symptom of rashness and inexperience should advance their works to the destined ground As soon as they were well collected upon it such a terrible discharge of cannon and small arms burst at once upon them from various parts that seven hundred men were left dead upon the spot the rest fled with trepidation and the siege was instantly raised  SECT X  AS we left Sterling we had a fine retros∣pect of it in which the castle takes a more exalted station than any in which we had yet seen it  At Sterling we crossed the Forth and tra∣velling twenty four miles under the Ochil mountains on the north side of the river a tract of country affording little amusement we came to the town of Kinross with an intention to visit the scenes of Lochleven  This lake on the side next Kinross is bounded by a plain on the other side by mountains It is about eleven miles in cir∣cumference and is of a circular form but as the eye views it on a level it loses it's cir∣cular appearance and stretches into length forming many beautiful bays  Near the middle of the lake are two islands One of them is noted for pasturage the other which contains little more than an acre of ground is adorned with a castle which as a spot of peculiar beauty or perhaps rather of security was once a royal mansion  All the level side of the lake between the water and Kinross is occupied by open groves At the west end of the lake stands a handsome house delightfully situated belonging to the family of Bruce It was built in the reign of Charles the second by Sir William Bruce for his own residence and is esteemed a beautiful piece of architecture In this neigh∣bourhood there is another monument of his genius the house of the earl of Rothes near Lesley but we had not time to see it The gardens at Kinross run down to the mar∣gin of the lake which in all it's splendor is spread before them Sir William Bruce when he built the house made wide plan∣tations around it which are now come to maturity Indeed all it's appendages were so pleasing that I do not remember being often struck with a more beautiful scene which a sweet evening no doubt contributed greatly to improve If we had seen it under a gloomy  sky it might perhaps have lost some of it's beauties  I shall never forget the sweet composure of an evening walk along the margin of the lake shrouded on the right by an irregular screen of Mr Bruce's pines and open to the water on the left A soothing stillness ran through the scene It was one of those mild soft evenings when not a breath disturbs the air About sun set a light grey mist arising from the lake began to spread over the land∣scape Creeping first along the surface of the water it rose by degrees up the hills blending both together in that pleasing ambi∣guity through which we can but just distin∣guish the limits of each I do not call this the most beautiful mode of vision but it certainly exhibits in great perfection a gra∣duating tint which is among the most pleasing sources of beauty The mist becom∣ing thinner as it ascended the mountain the ground of course appeared gradually stronger as it emerged from it  Our view was still improved by picturesque figures upon the foreground Some fishermen were dragging a net to the shore which had been carried into the lake by a boat We  waited till the contents of the net were dis∣charged among which were some very fine trout We saw them again at supper and found afterwards that this species of fish which is more red than salmon is peculiar to this lake and tho a critic in eating would travel many miles to taste this delicate food in perfection we were informed it sold at the price of three farthings a pound  The castle which appeared floating on the lake was a happy circumstance in the scene pointing the view from every part It was important in itself and still more so by an association of ideas through it's connection with that unfortunate princess Mary queen of Scotts whose beauty and guilt have united pity and detestation through every part of her history  A late historian Mr Whitacre hath given the public some new lights on the history of Mary and thrown the guilt on Elizabeth  In this castle she was confined by the confederate lords after the murder of the king and her marriage with Bothwell  Her escape from it was effected thus The castle belonged to a gentleman of the name of Douglas to whose care the confederate lords  had intrusted her George Douglas his younger brother a youth of eighteen lived in the fa∣mily whom Mary singled out as the instru∣ment of her deliverance When she had se∣cured his heart she employed his abilities A plan was laid between them and executed on Sunday night the d of May Young Douglas contrived as his brother sat down to supper to secure the keys of the castle The queen stood ready at the gate which her faith∣ful conductor locked behind her and threw the keys into the lake A boat had been prepared and the oars of all the other boats were thrown adrift Every possibility of im∣mediate pursuit being cut off the queen reach∣ed the shore in security where lord Seaton and sir James Hamilton stood ready with swift horses to receive her  Every picturesque subject may be treated on canvas two ways The fact may be represented under it's plain circumstancesor it may be represented under an allegory These two modes of representation answer to history and poetry both of which may often adorn the same subject  In the  historical  representation of a fact the artist has only to observe the common rules  of his art He must attend to design com∣position light and shade expression and so forth But in the  allegorical  representation besides these something more is required The allegory must be just and consistent and demands another kind of knowledge be∣sides that of the principles of his art It may be formed either on a heathen or a christian plan but on either it must be both uniform in itself and agreeable to the mode of ma∣chinery which it adopts It is the neglect of this uniformity and propriety which renders the allegorical mode of treating a subject so often disgusting  Nobody hath contributed more to bring contempt on allegory than Rubens Nobody painted more in that mode and when he had to do with subjects intirely fabulous he ge∣nerally did well but in his attempts to alle∣gorize history he often failed In representing a marriage for instance he would not scruple to introduce a christian bishop performing the the ceremony while Minerva or the Graces perhaps waited as bridemaids Nothing can be more absurd than such a medley  If the subject be treated  historically  let the king or the prince give his daughter away  and let the gentlemen and ladies of the court attend in their proper dresses If it be treated in  heathen allegory  erect the temple of Hymen let the God himself appearrear the altar call in Juno pronubaand let as many of the gods and goddesses attend in their different capacities as may be thought convenient But if the allegory be  christian  dismiss the heathen deitiesintroduce christian virtues in their roomand deck the temple and altar with proper appendages Allegory thus treated is very pleasing and tho where the subject is grand and noble I should in general prefer a history piece wellpainted to the same subject treated equally well in allegory yet such subjects as a marriage for instance which af∣ford few circumstances of importance and little room for expression are best treated in the allegorical style The imagination of the painter must inrich the poverty of the sub∣ject  The little story of Mary's escape from Lochleven is one of these It is replete with circumstances which admit of allegory but are little adapted to history Love is the subject of it and lovestories which of all others are below the dignity of historical  representation are best consigned to allegory The narrative in this light might run thus from which the painter might choose his point of time and adorn his subject with such em∣blematical appendages as he liked best  But neither the walls of Lochleven castle nor the lake which surrounded it were bar∣riers against love Mary had those bewitching charms which always raised her friends She wore a cestus and might be said to number among her constant attendants the God of Love himself His ready wit restored her liberty Time and place were obedient to his will His contrivance laid the plan His address secured the keys and his activity provided the bark to which he led her with his own hand carrying the torch to guide her footsteps through the darkness of the nightCon∣fusion ran through the castle Hasty lights were seen passing and repassing at every win∣dow and traversing the island in all directions The laughing God the mean while riding at the poop with one hand held the helm and with the other waved his torch in triumph round his head The boat soon made the shore and landed the lovely queen in a port of security where Loyalty and Friendship wait∣ed to receive her  SECT XI  FROM Lochleven we continued our rout northward through a country of little curiosity About eight miles before we reach Perth we have a noble view from the higher grounds of an extensive valethe fertile coun∣try of Strathern through which the river Erne appears winding with many a meander till it enter the Tay This vale extends at least thirty miles and the eye commands it almost from end to end Of the beautiful situations it affords great advantage hath been taken by the gentlemen of the neighbourhood You see it in many parts marked with distant plantations and can often distinguish the buildings of which these plantations are the appendages Far to the west stands Drum∣mondcastle once the residence of the earls of Perthnow an illfated forsaken mansion  In an opposite direction beyond the Erne you distinguish a rich scene of plantation There the earl of Kinnoul has extended his woods on every side You may yet distinguish Duplincastle rising among them but soon the woods will totally obscure it In it's neighbourhood was fought the celebrated bat∣tle of Duplin in which the family of Hay like the Roman Fabii were almost cut off to a man From a passage in Claudian one would suppose the Erne to have been often before dyed with blood  Scotorum cumulos flevit glaci  lis Ierne  Beyond the vale of Erne which is a much richer landscape than is commonly found in Scotland the eye is still carried into a distance more remote It easily distinguishes where that river at the end of the vale enters the Tay which is now a grand estuary and is one of the principal features of the view You trace it if the day be clear as far as Dundee where mak∣ing a sudden turn it retreats behind the higher grounds This whole vast distance both of Strathern and of the vale of Tay is bounded by mountains as the Scotch views in general  are which add both ornament and dignity to them  We did not however see this landscape with full advantage The day was clear and a noontide sun in all it's dazzling brightness had spread over it that full profusion of light which is so unfavourable to landscape A per∣pendicular ray scarce allowed the existence of shade whereas to give the landscape it's full advantage the shadow not the light should have prevailed The mountains par∣ticularly should have been in shade In almost all cases the darkened mountain makes the most respectable figure except perhaps when under a morning or an evening sun you wish to tip it's prominent knolls with light Under the shadow of the mountains a gentle light spreading into the vale would have had a beautiful effect and as it decayed it might have marked two or three objects with splendor to carry on the idea to the end of the scene  We did not enter Strathern but left it on the right and made towards the moun∣tains of Moncrief  From these heights we had a retrospect of the same scenes only more extended The  vale of Erne which lay before to the north was now removed to the south but under this different aspect had still a better effect at least it was so much better enlightened when we now saw it that it appeared to much greater advantage In another direction the eye extended over the rich plains of Gowry and the Frith of Tay even to it's junction with the ocean  The high grounds where we now stood make a part of the Grampian hills which run through the middle of Scotland from Aberdeenshire in the east into Argyleshire in the west Some interruption no doubt they meet with and rarely I believe in any part swell into mountains of remarkable note but in the lowest parts they form a considerable rise and on the whole may be esteemed among the grand features of the country In a pictu∣resque light from the little specimen we saw of them they afford great variety of ground rising into wellshaped hills and sinking into beautiful vallies adorned with foaming rivulets which carry their succours on both sides of  the Grampian to the different rivers of emi∣nence their several divisions  But this country is still more remarkable as a scene of history than of picturesque beauty Here we trod what may almost be called classic ground where the last effort was made in defence of British liberty  As yet the Glota and Bodotria the friths of Clyde and Forth were the boundaries of the Roman power in Britain and the neck of land between these estuaries being for∣tified  See page  confined the barbarous inhabitants within it's bounds This curb they bore with impatience and determined to exert them∣selves in driving the Romans still farther from their frontiers In one of their incursions falling upon the ninth legion in the night they committed great slaughter  The wise and prudent Agricola who commanded the Roman legions seems to have had no great desire to carry his arms farther but being roused by these repeated insults he at length drew out his legions and marched them into the enemy's country ordering  his fleet which had sailed round the eastern coast of England from Sandwich and was then in the Forth to attend his march  The news of the Roman legions in motion soon drew together the whole force of the Britons under one of their ablest leaders What was the name of this commander in his own barbarous language we know not but in the Latin of Tacitus he takes the name of Galgacus This chief seizing the highest ground of the Grampian hills resolved there to wait the enemy A battle ensued the particulars of which we have at large in Tacitus The event was fatal to the Britons They had fought gallantly through the whole day but were at length intirely defeated with the loss of ten thousand of their men killed upon the spot  The next morning the Romans had a full view of the melancholy event The field was now silent and solitary Heaps of dead were lying round but not a single body of the enemy appeared either on the plain or in possession of any post while the country at a distance was seen from the heights involved in smoke as if it had been ravaged by an enemy The cause was soon discovered  The Britons flying from the field had them∣selves with barbarian fury set fire to their own houses and villages and many of them had even put to death their wives and chil∣dren  The description which Tacitus gives of the behaviour of the Britons after their defeat is so animated a picture of that irresolution and contention of various passions which we might expect in a fierce savage people under those circumstances that I cannot help transcribing it  Britanni palantes mixtoque virorum mulierumque ploratu trahere vulneratos vocare integros deserere domos ac per iram ultro incendere eligere latebras et statim relinquere miscere invicem consilia aliqua dein sperare aliquando frangi aspectu pignorum suorum saepius concitari satisque constabat saevisse quosdam in conjuges ac liberos tanquam misererentur  So innate a love of liberty burned within them that when that was lost they thought all was lost  The exact spot where this great battle was fought is not easily ascertained but from the investigation of learned antiquarians it is supposed to be somewhere among these hills and I have heard there is a place where the vale of Strathern unites with them which is to this day called  Galgachanmoor  Agricola having refreshed his troops marched with a slow and solemn motion through the country ordering his fleet to  sail round the island through the Orcades and Hebrides and along the western coast of England After a prosperous voyage it arrived safe at Sandwich in Kent if that be as it is supposed to be the  portus Trutulensis  of Tacitus from whence round the eastern coast it had joined the army of Agricola in the frith of Forth  This is commonly supposed to be the first account we have of the insularity of Britain Camden supposes it and indeed Tacitus seems rather to imply it when he tells us that the Britons were uncommonly alarmed at the ap∣pearance of the Roman fleet  lest if it should be found they were bounded by the sea they must re∣linquish their last hope which consisted in the igno∣rance of the Romans  So I interpret the concise expression of Tacitus  Britannos ipsa  tanquam aperto mar  s s  secreto ultimum victis perf  g  um cla  eretur  It is implied too in the story he tells us if I understand it rightly of the Usipian cohort  Vit Agric    On the other hand many writers before Tacitus speak of Britain as an island and Caesar gives us with surprizing accuracy the dimensions of itI can only reconcile  this difference by supposing that Agricola's voyage was the first  authenticated  circumna∣vigation of Britain and that all the accounts the Romans had before were founded on con∣jecture and vague report at least not on any knowledge of their own  Before I leave this account of Galgacus I cannot forbear a short remark on the elegant and judicious historian from whom we have it  The candor of criticism commonly allows the historian to put the intentions and views of generals into the form of speeches tho such speeches neither were nor could be spoken It is a graceful decoration of action and gives life to a character Of this the best models of history afford frequent examples But then manners and customs should be well observed A Roman should speak like a Roman and a barbarian like a barbarian But Tacitus seems in this particular to have forgotten his usual accuracy He has put a long and laboured speech into the mouth of Galgacus which had no kind of similitude to the manners of the Britons of that day even as he himself describes them Galgacus seems perfectly informed of the state and history of  mankind at that period and reasons from a variety of topics with so much elegance perspicuity and coherence of argument that Agricola himself who harangues his troops in the next page does not appear to more advantage An inadvertence of this kind is the more surprizing in Tacitus as such ad∣mirable rules with regard to  propriety of character  had just been fixed by a celebrated writer almost his contemporary  Si dicenti  erunt fortunis absona dicta  Romani tollunt equites peditesque cachinum  Aut f  mam sequere aut sibi conv  ientia finge  Respicere exemplar vitae mor  mque jubebo  Doct  m imitatorem et vivas hinc ducere voces  SECT XII  WE were now descending the mountains of Moncrief and as we approached Perth we had a beautiful view of that town and it's invirons Strathtay or the vale of Tay was spread before us It is a level plain of considerable extent skreened with woods and surrounded with mountains The Tay forming a grand stream winds through it and about the middle of the vale stands the town which with it's noble bridge and the whole scenery around forms a very amusing landscape  This view as we approach still nearer would be extremely picturesque were it not for one awkwardness which totally incapacitates it for the pencil The Tay runs in a direct line between parallel banks from the town to the eyeIn a foreground I think the pain∣ter tho copying nature need pay little atten∣tion to such awkwardnesses but may venture  to correct them A liberty of this kind must be taken it is impossible to compose a picture without it The translation must needs be bad if the idiom of the language into which you translate be not observed  Perth was once the capital of Scotland  See page  Here the courts of justice sat the parliament assembled and the king resided It was then defended by a strong castle and was remark∣able for being the only walled town in the kingdom It's dignity of course subjected it to many insults Whoever prevailed in Scot∣land had generally his eye first on Perth In the English wars it was always warmly con∣tested Each of the three first Edwards had possession of it and each of them lost it It had it's share also in the religious wars of And in the civil wars of the succeeding century it was besieged first by Montrose and afterwards by Cromwell It's last siege is said to have been the basis of it's glory Cromwell's soldiers being dispersed about the country introduced a spirit of industry un∣known before  The bridge at Perth which is but just finished is equal to any bridge we find on this side of Westminster But the bridge at Perth has undergone as many revolutions as the town It was swept away in the year by a pro∣digious flood which destroyed great part of the town itself Many lives were lost and the royal family escaped with difficulty in a boat Five times since that it hath met the same fate  At Perth every stranger must look through the window of Gowryhouse from whence James the sixth called for help when he feared assassination from the earl of Gowry Among all the doubtful facts which his∣tory hath endeavoured to develop this is one of the most mysterious Whether James intended to assassinate the earl of Gowry and his brother or whether those noblemen in∣tended to assassinate him is a point equally doubtful Circumstances the most improba∣ble attend both suppositions And yet the king was certainly attacked by the earl and the earl was certainly killed by the king's attendants These are the critical points which chiefly exercise the judgment and pene∣tration of the historian and it is very amusing to observe how admirably Dr Robertson has  developed this dark affair He first states the facts and shews the almost impossibility of either supposition When he has brought his reader into this dilemma who knows not what to think of the matter he takes up the facts againthrows a new light upon them on  another supposition  and makes it very clear that the earl of Gowry intended only to get James in his power who was in fact the property of each party as it gained the ascendant  Soon after we leave Perth we come in view of a place famous in story the ruins of Scone Tho we cannot apply here the first lines of Virgil's noble and very picturesque description of Latinus's palacethe grandeur of it's architectureand the dignity of it's accompanimentsthe  Tectum augustum ingens centum sublime columnis  Horrendum sylvis religione parentum c  we may however apply to it the following part of the description  Hinc sceptra accipere primos attollere fasces  Regibus omen erat  And yet Scone tho in a state of ruin was at least so far habitable in the year that the pretender found it sufficient to re∣ceive all his court where he affected to live with the splendor of majesty Preparations too were making for his coronation but they were interrupted by a body of the king's horse  The situation of Scone on the northern banks of the Tay as we rode along the op∣posite side appeared not unpleasant It is surrounded by distant mountains but lying low it has not that grandeur of situation which a palace demands  The celebrated stonechair the palladium of the Scottish empire which formerly had it's station here is now one of the appendages of royalty in Westminster abbey I have heard that a silly distich in the form of a prediction contributed not a little to reconcile many of the bigots of the Scotch nation to the union  Ni fallat fatum Scoti quocunque locatum  Invenient lapidem regnare tenenter ibidem  From Scone we proceeded to Dunkeld but met with nothing worth our notice till  we came within a few miles of it This tract of country however tho not beautiful is remarkable You pass over a very high and flat plain As you approach Dunkeld this wild unshapely desert begins to separate into parts and form itself into hills hung with wood and broken with rock But what is remarkable from these high grounds you  descend  into the  Highlands  for here the country begins which takes that denomina∣tion The road winding among the hills of this descent discovers new beauties as we advance We had a hasty view of the abbey of Dunkeldof a picturesque bridge over the Branof the mountains that inviron the wholeand other objects as we passed The several scenes shifted rapidly and we suffered them to pass as we proposed after∣wards to take a more distinct view of them There is something very amusing even in a hasty succession of beautiful scenes The imagination is kept in a pleasing perturbation while these floating unconnected ideas become a kind of waking dream and are often wrought up by fancy into more pleasing pictures than they in fact appear to be when they are viewed with deliberate attention  The object of our curiosity at Dunkeld was the seat of the duke of Athol From Inver we ferried over the Tay and in crossing had a grand view up the river It was a vista of rock and wood which in nature's hands was managed without any formality and made a scene of great beauty We landed in the duke's garden where a green walk along the side of the river brought us to his house It is a villa rather than a ducal mansion but being a favourite spot it has been the object of much attention and expence  Dunkeld was formerly both an archiepiscopal see and an abbey and the limits of the duke's improvements are those which formerly con∣fined the monks Nature has marked them with very decisive boundaries  This favoured spot for it is indeed a beau∣ful scene consists of a large circular valley the diameter of which is in some parts a mile in others two or three It's surface is various and some of the rising grounds  within the valley itself  would even be esteemed lofty if it were not for the grand skreen of mountains which circles the whole At the base of those towards the south runs the Tay in this place broad deep and silent The whole valley is  interspersed with wood both on the banks of the river and in it's internal parts and would have been a still more beautiful scene if art had done as much as nature Much indeed it has done but nothing well Cas∣cades and slopes and other puerilities deform a scene which is in itself calculated to receive all the grandeur of landscape The walks shew some contrivance and might with a few alterations be made beautiful Indeed the whole is capable of receiving any improve∣ment and may by this time have received it I speak of it only as it was a dozen years ago  The remains of the abbey shrouded in wood stand on the edge of the lawn but rather too near the house The solitude which naturally belongs to them and the embellishments which are necessary about a habitable mansion interfere rather too much with each other  See this idea more explained page  These ruins consist of the nave of the great church the two side ailes and the tower The architecture is a mixture of Gothic and Saxon yet elegant in it's kind The tower is handsome At the  west end we observed the peculiarity of a round ornamental window which is not exactly in the middle but appears as if it had been pushed aside by the point of the large one Part of the old cathedral is now the parish church and is very beautiful and very slovenly Near it is a square room the burying place of the dukes of Athol adorned with a tablet containing the arms of all their connections  Besides the church nothing of the abbey remains And indeed in most of the ruined abbeys both in England and Scotland we find the great church is the only part left which was owing to the piety of the times It was merit to destroy the  habitations of the monks  but it was profaneness to injure the  house of God  Thus Knox would exclaim  "Down with the nests and the rooks will fly off"  but his rage vented itself chiefly against the cells of the monks the abbey churches were generally spared Such was the piety also of temporal spoilers In a paper of Haynes's to which reference hath already been made  See page  when we find an instance of a  town or a village destroyed we often find it specified also that the church was left unin∣jured To this piety even amidst the rage of war and the zeal of reformation we are indebted for most of the ruins of abbeys that are yet left in Britain  Round one of the rocky mountains which skreen the valley of Dunkeld the duke has carried walks and has planted both that mountain and some others Many thousands of young pines are struggling for existence among the crannies of rocks and many thousands more which have gotten hold of the soil are flourishing greatly for the situa∣tion seems wonderfully agreeable to them but on so broad and lofty a base the whole has yet the appearance only of a green moss tinting the rocks and it will be a century before these woods thriving as they are will have consequence to break the lines of the mountains and give a proper degree of sylvan richness to the scene  On the top of one of the mountains behind the duke's house are five small lakes which communicate but we did not see them nor is their scenery probably of any value  Opposite to this moutain and making a part of the same circular skreen stands a hill celebrated in dramatic story the hill of Bir∣nam but it is now totally divested of wood Shakespear however is right in making it once a woody scene which it certainly was Of Dunsinane no vestiges remain except a deep double ditch The situation appears to have been very strong  SECT XIII  HAVING thus taken a view of that side of the Tay on which the house is placed we crossed it again to see the Hermi∣tage a name the duke has given to some improvements he has made on the Bran  Down the side of one of those mountains which forms the southern boundary of the valley of Dunkeld this river tumbles through a steep rocky channel and falls into the Tay at Inver A considerable part of the ground along it's course the duke has inclosed but his improvements are not suitable to the scene Nothing was required but a simple path to shew in the most advantageous manner the different appearances of the river which is uncommonly wild and beautiful and should have been the only object of attention In adorning such a path the native forest wood and natural brush of the place had  been sufficient Instead of this the path which winds among fragments of rock is decorated with knots of shrubs and flowers  Rocks and flowers no doubt make a con∣trast and contrast is a source of beauty But the pleasing contrast should be founded either in  harmony  or  propriety  In Horace's human head joined to a horse's neck there is contrast but it is such a contrast as the poet tells us every body would laugh at The contrast is just the same between  rocks  and  cultivated flowers  between the grandest works of nature and the prettiest little decorations of art We object not to wild flowers growing naturally among rocks They are  nature's decoration  and are nurtured in the soil that suits them We object only when we see  the hand of art laying them out in knots  Such ideas in scenes dedicated to grandeur and solitude are incon∣gruous  And yet  propriety  may sometimes happily unite ideas which in themselves are in∣harmonious A bull for instance grazing with flowers tied to his horns is absurd but lead him in the pomp of sacrifice to the altar and his flowers which connect him properly with the scene for that reason become him  Thus an elegant path round the environs of a house where you would naturally expect the decorating hand of art is pleasing  propriety  gives it  beauty  But in a wild rocky scene where you expect no human dwelling nor any thing but the naked print of nature's foot all appearance of  artificial ornament  offends  Having passed through this elaborate par∣terre half inclined to turn back at every step we came unexpectedly to an astonishing scene  The two rocky cheeks of the river almost uniting compress the stream into a very nar∣row compass and the channel which de∣scends abruptly taking also a sudden turn the water suffers more than common violence from the double resistance it receives from compression and obliquity It's efforts to disengage itself have in a course of ages undermined disjointed and fractured the rock in a thousand different forms and have filled the whole channel of the descent with fragments of uncommon magnitude which are the more easily established one upon the broken edges of another as the fall is rather  inclined  than  perpendicular  Down this abrupt channel the whole stream in foaming violence forcing it's way through the peculiar  and happy situation of the fragments which oppose it's course forms one of the grandest and most beautiful cascades we had ever seen At the bottom it has worn an abyss in which the wheeling waters suffer a new agitation tho of a different kind  This whole scene and it's accompaniments are not only grand but picturesquely beautiful in the highest degree The  composition  is per∣fect but yet the parts are so intricate so various and so complicated that I never found any piece of nature less obvious to imita∣tion It would cost the readiest pencil a summer day to bring off a good resemblance My poor tool was so totally disheartened that I could not bring it even to make an attempt The broad features of a mountain the shape of a country or the line of a lake are matters of easy execution A trifling error escapes notice But these high finished pieces of nature's more complicated workmanship in which the beauty in a great degree consists in the finishing and in which every touch is ex∣pressive especially the spirit activity clear∣ness and variety of agitated water are among the most difficult efforts of the pencil When the cascade falls in a pure unbroken sheet it  is an object of less beauty indeed but of much easier imitation  This grand view which I scruple not to call the most interesting thing of the kind I ever saw is exhibited through the windows of a summerhouse which I suppose gives name to the scene but it bears no resemblance to the idea of a  Hermitage  A more exact Hermitage had been a better decoration We can conceive a recluse to have chosen such a retreat and to have felt tranquillity of mind perhaps the more forcibly near the roar of a cataract It's noise might exclude every other idea and leave the mind to itselfBut such a summerhouse as this would not suit a recluse It is too much adorned  Among it's other ornaments the panes of the windows are in part composed of red and green glass which to those who have never seen deceptions of this kind give a new and surprizing effect turning the water into a cataract of fire or a cascade of liquid verdi∣grease But such deceptions are tricks below the dignity of scenes like this Coloured glasses may be amusing but I should rather wish to have them hung up in frames with handles to be used at pleasure than fixed in a  window and to impose the  necessity  of looking through them  The only picturesque glasses are those which the artists call Claud Loraine glasses They are combined of two or three different colours and if the hues are well sorted they give the objects of nature a soft mellow tinge like the colouring of that master The only use of these glasses which have little but in sunshine is to give a greater depth to the shades by which the effect is shewn with more force How far the painter should follow his eye or his glass in working from nature I am not master enough of the theory of colouring to ascertain In general I am apt to believe that the merit of this kind of modified vision consists chiefly in it's no∣velty and that nature has given us a better apparatus for viewing objects in a picturesque light than any the optician can furnish  From the Hermitage we continued our rout about a mile and a half farther up the river to see another grand scene upon the Bran at a place called the  Rumblingbrig  Here nature had almost formed a bridge of  rock which is finished by art Under it's arch the river makes a noble rush precipitating itself near fifty feet between the two cheeks of the rock which support the bridge The scenery too around it is very grand but it is also very local for all the ground at a little distance from the  Rumblingbrig  is a desert heath This bridge made us some amends for having lost through a mistake the sight of another of the same kind near Kinross tho the  rumblingbrig  there was much superior in grandeur to this as we were informed by those who had seen both  This scene is not among the duke's im∣provements but we entered them again about a mile above the grand cascade and were entertained with many beautiful pieces of rock scenery in our return to the HermitageAl∣most all the Scotch rivers are rapid and rocky as the rivers in mountainous countries commonly are but we thought the Bran superior in these respects to any we had seen It's whole course is a continued scene of violence op∣position and every species of agitation till it's impetuous waters find peace at length in the tranquillity of the Tay  Very little advantage however is taken of the romantic banks of this river The path might have been carried up one side of it and down the other straying artlessly to those parts where the most beautiful views are presented without any forced openings for∣mal stands white seats or other artificial introductions preparatory to the several scenes But this walk which has neither nature in it nor art carries you up and down in the same track It is fortunate however that you have such a variety of beautiful scenes that the eye is not disgusted with seeing them twice over  In a gloomy cell on the banks of the river we found an inscription which joined it's kindred ideas with those of the scene  Ah see the form which faintly gleams  'Tis Oscar come to cheer my dreams  On wreaths of mist it glides away  Oh stay my lovely Oscar stay  Awake the harp to doleful lays  And sooth my soul with Oscar's praise  Wake Oscian last of Fingal's line  And mix thy sighs and tears with mine  The shell is ceased in Oscar's hall  Since gloomy Cairbar saw thee fall  The roe o'er Morven playful bounds  Nor fears the cry of Oscar's hounds  Thy four grey stones the hunter spies  Peace to the hero's ghost he cries  As we passed along the higher banks we saw another inscription engraven upon a rock within the bed of the river and as we de∣scended to it we expected to see an account of some life preserved or some natural cu∣riosity found upon that spot but when we arrived at it we were informed in fair and handsome Roman characters that a hole in the rock near the inscription scooped as there were many by the vortices of the river was on such a day some years ago drunk full of punch by a set of gentlemen whose names are inscribed at length The atchieve∣ment appears to have been great in it's way but one should have been sorry to have met the name of a friend recorded on such an occasion  At Dunkeld we heard in all it's circum∣stances the melancholy tale of the late duke of Athol's death He had shewn no symp∣toms of despondency till within a few weeks of that event yet it was thought proper to  give his servants a caution over him His watchfulness however eluded theirs  It was about eight o'clock in a dark No∣vember night when he slipt out of a door which opens upon the lawn He was in∣stantly missed and lights were dispatched in all directions but without effect His bro∣ther was in the house The servants pri∣vately informed him A full hour was spent in fruitless search It was now thought ne∣cessary to inform the duchess Several hours passed in painful suspence Intelligence of no kind could be obtained Every one had his suspicions but no one durst avow them  Some time after midnight a fellow brought in the duke's hat which he had found by the side of the river This put an end to every glimpse of hope but the fatal event was not confirmed till late the next morn∣ing when the body was found in the Tay about three miles below the house  What it was that threw him into that dejection of spirits which occasioned this catastrophe or whether it was a malady of mind or body could never be explained No cause appeared either from his fortunes or any other circumstance He was one of the most  amiable noblemen in Scotland His life was not only innocent and domestic but correct and virtuous and what in men of his rank is more uncommon I have heard it was religi∣ous No man was more beloved nor did any man enjoy more of that serenity and cheerful∣ness which generally attend a benevolent and well regulated mind  When we see a man who has raised a sudden and princely fortune by the iron arts of op∣pression sinking after the heyday of enjoy∣ment is over into melancholy unable to en∣dure the horror of his own thoughts and arm∣ing his own hand against himself we are not surprized it is the natural course of things it is the serpent that recoils upon itself But when we see a man of virtue and piety under these terrors of mind when we see the ap∣pearance of guilt in the breast of innocence when we see that neither the highest fortunes nor even the cheerfulness of religion itself can secure the mind from these inbred horrors human nature stands abashed in the midst of all it's precarious enjoyments we revere the mys∣terious hand of heaven and learn a lesson of humility which nothing else in this world can give  SECT XIV  FROM Dunkeld we continued our journey to Blaircastle which is about twenty miles farther north The whole road is a continuation of picturesque scenery Through the first eight miles we accompanied the Tay which entertained us with all the playful variety that a river can exhibit Sometimes it came running up to the foreground Then it would hide itself beneath a woody precipice Then again when we knew not what was become of it it would appear in the distance forming it's meanders along some winding vale  When we leave the Tay we meet the Tummel which tho less wild in it's accom∣paniments performs it's evolutions with as much beauty One scene upon it's bank cal∣led aloud for the pencil We had many in which were greater beauties but they were mixed as is often the case with something  awkward But this view was almost purely pic∣turesque A broad sandbank stretched before the eye as a second distance round which the river formed an indented curve it's banks were well decorated and the view was closed in the fashion of Scotch landscape with beau∣tiful mountains  Mere  drawing  without  colouring  can at best only express the forms of objects and by adding a little light and shade endeavour to grace them with something of an  artificial effect  How much the face of nature must suffer from such partial imitation is evident as her colours and tints are her principal glory but they are so local so fugitive so mixed and indiscriminate that they must often be taken on the spot or lost The only  true  method of transferring the tints of nature is with your pallet in your hand and every painter who wishes to form himself as a colourist after nature must accustom himself to copy her features and complexion as he does those of other beauties from the life And in this operation it is his best method when it is in his power to watch the opportunity of the best lights for the face of nature like other  Yellow Red  Yellow Blue  Blue Red  Yellow Blue Red                                                                                                                                      faces appears to more advantage under some lights than under others  The next best method of catching the hues of nature is by tinting a drawing on the spot from which the artist may paint at his leisure But this is a very imperfect method as the hues of nature must greatly evaporate and lose their spirit in a second translation  To assist however in this matter I cannot help mentioning a method which might per∣haps be of some little use in fixing at least the coarser tints of nature where time and oppor∣tunity of doing it better are wanting Let the artist carry about with him a book on the leaves of which are exhibited in squares a va∣riety of different tints As all the tints of na∣ture are supposed to be mixed from three ori∣ginal colours yellow blue and red they may be classed under them With these tints the artist may compare the hues of nature and each square being numbered he may fix a few characteristic hues in his drawing by a refer∣ence to the number I call this however a mere succedaneum as there are a thousand variegated tints in nature which it would be impossible to fix in this way and indeed as the whole method is mere theory and was  never as far as I know applied to practice it might be found upon trial very inade∣quateThis digression was occasioned by a view upon the Tummel to which the co∣louring of a sandbank and it's harmonizing with the objects in it's neighbourhood gave a beauty that in a mere  uncoloured drawing  is entirely lost  The banks of the Tummel are chiefly pas∣toral but when it is joined by the Garry or rather received into it we had an ample speci∣men of the sublime The pass of Killicranky began now to open which is the great en∣trance into the highlands in these parts and may be called the Caledonian Thermopyle tho indeed what are generally called the high∣lands as I observed begin at Dunkeld This pass forms a very magnificent scene The vallies as we approach it are beautiful Two or three gentlemen have fixed their habi∣tations among them and seem to have made a good choice  As we enter the pass the mountains on each side expand in noble irregular wings The road takes the right and may be said to  traverse the  base  of the mountain when com∣pared with it's summit but when compar∣ed with it's  real base  it is raised to a giddy height It is a great addition to the scene to look down upon the river foaming among rocks diving into woods and forcing it's way among the huge fragments that have tumbled into it's channel from the mountain  Two of the scenes we met with in these wild regions were particularly picturesque In one the sloping corner of a mountain with the road winding round it forms the foreground the middle is occupied by a bridge over the Garry and some of the grand prominences of the pass fill the distance  The other consists chiefly of a second dis∣tance in which the river forms a sort of pool and the mountains a very pleasing combination around it  By this time we had nearly opened the pass which continues about a mile displaying in one part or other of it's ample curve every species of rough and picturesque scenery In general however as it's lofty skreens are brought very near the eye they are too large and refractory to be moulded into composition Innumerable parts of them may with little  trouble be hewn into good foregrounds but they afford few materials delicate enough for a distance  In a military light this entrance into the highlands has at all times been considered as a very formidable defile In the last rebellion a body of Hessians having been detached into these parts of Scotland made a full pause at this strait refusing to march farther It appeared to them as the  ne plus ultra  of habitable country  In king William's time it was marked with the destruction of a royal army The only spirited attempt in his reign in favour of the Jacobite cause was made by Clavers lord viscount Dundee This chief who was a man both of honour and enterprize collected a body of forces and set up the standard of the exiled prince With great zeal he importuned all the disaffected clans to join him but amidst the warmest professions he found only lukewarm assistance Mor∣tified by repeated disappointments and chagrin∣ed at having the whole burden of the war upon himself he was skulking about Lockabar with a few starved and ill armed troops hesitating what course to take when he received advice that general Mackay who  was in quest of him at the head of the English army was in full march towards the pass of Killicranky In the midst of despair a beam of hope inspired him He harrangued his men assured them of success roused them to action and fell upon Mackay as he filed out of the straits with so much judgment and well directed fury that in seven minutes the English infantry was broken and the horse in as many moreIn the article of victory Dundee was mortally wounded An old highlander shewed us a few trees under the shade of which he was led out of the battle and where he breathed his last with that intrepidity which is so nobly described by a modern Scotch poet  Poems by Robert Burns p  in an interview be∣tween death and a victorious hero  "Nae cauld fainthearted doubtings teaze him  "Death comes Wi' fearless eye he sees him  "Wi' bloody hand a welcome gies him  "And when he fa's  "His latest draught of breathing leaves him  "In faint huzzas"  Dundee was the life of a cause which in this short blaze of success expired  From the straits of Killicranky we soon arrived within the district of the Blair of Athol as this part of the country is called Blair∣castle which is the capital of this wide domain makes but a mean appearance It stands as you approach it under a mountain with a wood before it but the former is ill shaped and the latter which is chiefly of sir is formal  Mean however as this castle appears at pre∣sent in the light of a fortress it was once a place of high renown and has many a history annexed to it As it was the only fortress in these wild parts it was ever thought a place of consequence and had it's share in every disturbance of the times In many scenes of violence it was engaged during the feuds of aristocracy but it makes no figure in history before the civil wars of the last century In the year it ventured to check the career of that celebrated hero the marquiss of Mon∣trose but it paid dear for it's temerity He laid siege to it and took it by assault Ten years after it fell under the displeasure of Cromwell and experienced the same fate  But in the last rebellion it had better fortune Sir Andrew Agnew seized it with a body of seventy horse and held it for the king The rebels twice attacked it but each time without success  The late duke of Athol seeing his family seat thus subjected to so many insults on ac∣count of it's strength took a resolution to dismantle it that it might never again be an object of military concern He did not per∣haps sufficiently consider that if any future trouble should arise it is full as likely in it's present state of weakness to become a prey as in it's ancient state of prowess to have been made a fortress Be it as it will the pictu∣resque eye regrets the loss of it's towers and battlements and is hurt at seeing a noble castle transformed into an ordinary house  But tho Blaircastle appeared on our ap∣proach to stand under a mountain it changed it's situation as we arrived on the spot The mountains take a circular form around it and it stands seated on a plain as the word  Blair  in the Erse language implies We found also that notwithstanding it's outward appearance the apartments are noble and furnished in grand taste  The scenery about the house is inferior to that at Dunkeld and yet it is suitable to the grandeur of a great house and capable of much improvement The plain on which the house stands spreads about a mile in front and might be beautifully diversified with lawns and wood At present it is much injured by vistas and a kitchengarden which tho extraordinary in it's way is still a nuisance  At the end of the plain runs the Tilt a rapid and rocky stream but it is of no service in the view for it lies within such lofty banks that it is invisible till you arrive on the spot There the duke has conducted walks but I cannot say much in praise either of the artifice with which they are conducted or of their simplicity In the course of them you see the cascades of two or three streams which fall down the bank into the Tilt and are admired more than they deserve The bank is of lofty and broken rock and the streams are by no means inconsiderable yet the very circumstance of their falling  into the river  is a great disservice to them as capital ob∣jects It makes them appear smaller by bring∣ing them into comparison with a greater  stream It exhibits them also in an awkward situation for as they fall down the side of an extended bank they do not fill the eye like a river pouring down between rocks and seen as a simple object in one grand point of view One of them is called the Yorkcascade in compliment to the late archbishop Drummond and is admired for it's broken stages For myself I am more pleased with a simple construction That at Dunkeld indeed is infinitely broken but it is still one noble gush whereas this is frittered and divided into several distinct parts each of which makes a little separate whole  Having viewed the disposition of the ground in the front of the house we viewed it next on the other side where it is much more beautiful The mountains here approach nearer the house between two of which runs a valley about a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in breadth The sides and bottom of this valley are wholly filled with wood through which runs a rocky and sounding stream This beautiful piece of natural sce∣nery is improved as it ought to be A delightful walk about two miles in length is conducted round it and is in all it's  parts easy and natural except that here and there a semicircular parapet is set off from the walk to shew some parts of the river and rocks at the bottom They might have been shewn better by the simple and natural curve of the walk These prepara∣tory stations always injure the effect by exciting beforehand the expectation of it The charm of novelty is so far lost  Between this scenery and the house are a few acres which are laid out with more em∣bellishment but less taste What we chiefly admired here were some firs of the spruce kind which we thought the most picturesque we had ever seen They were indeed  a stately progeny of pines  With all their floating foliage richly robed  If Dunkeld appeared more the retired seat pleasure Blaircastle especially in it's ancient form was more the residence of the highland chieftain Here he was always found in the article of danger Here his clan mustered around him and here he fed them and kept their courage alive from his extensive pastures and vast ranges of forest  These wastes we wished much to visit and should have found great amusement in  traversing their extensive boundaries and ex∣amining their various inhabitantsin springing the ptarmigan and other heath birds that frequent them in hearing their various cries and notes and in seeing those herds of wild stags which are never seen in cultivated cha∣ses and among them the nimble roebuck bounding in it's native clime but so wide are these domains that we were informed we might have travelled twenty or thirty miles before we could have gratified our curiosity  SECT XV  FROM Blair to Taymouth which we proposed next to visit we found two roads one to the north by Donacardoc and the other to the south by repassing the straits of Killicranky The latter is the better road but we chose the former as leading through a new country  The first object that called our attention after we left Blair were the falls of the river Freer About two miles beyond Blair we were directed to leave the road on our right and to pursue the course of that river which as it comes tumbling down a lofty hill would shew us several fine cascades They were scarce worth so long and perpendicular a walk One of them indeed is a grand fall but it  is so naked in it's accompaniments and seen from so bad a point that upon the whole it is of little value  In our way to Donacardoc and beyond it the country in general is wild and moun∣tainous but the vallies are wide and ex∣tensive and as we passed along their sweeping sides many of the scenes were very noble The mountains retiring in different distances from the eye marshalled themselves in the most beautiful forms and expanded their vast concave bosoms to receive the most enchanting lights The picturesque traveller indeed if he finds the lights as we found them will be sufficiently rewarded for his trouble in tra∣versing this rough country The scenes on the right are those which will chiefly engage his attention  And here I cannot help disclosing what appears to me a truth tho so bold a one that it ought only perhaps to be opened to the initiated In the exhibition of distant mountains on paper or canvas unless you make them exceed their  real  or  proportional  size they have no effect It is inconceiv∣able  how objects lessen by distance Examine any distance closed by mountains in a ca∣mera and you will easily see what a poor diminutive appearance the mountains make By the power of perspective they are lessened to nothing Should you represent them in your landscape in so diminutive a form all dignity and grandeur of idea would be lost The case is a scrap of canvas compared with the vastness of nature's scale  misleads  the eye and if the  exact proportion  of the moun∣tain be observed it is so trifling that we cannot easily  persuade  ourselves it is the  repre∣sentative  of so vast and enormous a mass  If indeed the mountain always and in∣variably appeared  under one hue  the eye might in some degree learn to infer the distance from the colour and of course the bulk But this is not the case The colour of mountains is as various as the colour of the sky Light etherial blue which is the colour of the air is the hue thrown upon the most removed objects But the blue mountain can only be represented under the bright and colourless sky You would often wish to adorn your landscape with other appearances of nature in which the distant mountain assumes other  hues It is brown or it is purple or it is grey and all these in a variety of degrees So that colour is by no means a criterion of bulkBesides you often wish to introduce your mountain nearer than the distance at which it assumes aerial blue And when this is the case it's surface is subject to a still greater variety of tints and it's bulk is consequently with more difficulty ascertained from it's colour  Even  in nature  the eye is apt to make fre∣quent mistakes and often misjudges with regard both to bulk and distance notwith∣standing it is able to form comparisons from the various objects that appear in the extent of landscape around which may assist the judgment But in painting the eye has not this assistance It has only the objects of a very circumscribed spot to compare by and cannot therefore deduce the real size of the mountain for want of objects of comparison We must therefore enlarge the scale a little beyond nature to make nature look like her∣self If indeed the picture and nature should be brought together the deception will be apparent otherwise the  deception  appears the  reality  The celebrated boat of Raphael in the cartoon of the draught of fishes is a fiction somewhat of this kind in which the boat is represented much less than the truth lest the real truth should offend An object of the full size of a boat so near the eye would have ingrossed too much of the spectator's attention and the painter hoped the beauty of his figures would engage the eye so much as to pass over the inaccuracy If indeed the absurdity could have been removed with a lit∣tle contrivance it would certainly have been better As so great a master however found reason to make his object too little another artist by a parity of reason may make his object too large  The ancient columnal sculptures at Rome were accompanied with a degree of this ar∣tificial deception As the figures at the top of the column would be seen from the bottom diminished out of all proportion if they had been of the natural size the sculptors very properly made them much larger than the life so that the eye seeing them from the bottom conceived them to be of the proper size  As we left the wild country about Dona∣cardoc we met our old acquaintance the river Garry and were surprized to see it tho so much nearer it's source in better plight than it appeared at Killicranky Here it oc∣cupies a broad channel and makes an ample sweep but there tho it had received many considerable accessions it made no figure The case was it was there contracted and limited within narrow banks except in that part where it spreads into a pool so that altho it contained more water it made a less appearance  From the banks of the Garry we found more coarse country but it was of no con∣tinuance The steep sides of Glenlion received us and afforded us several views which were magnificent in their kind into the deep recesses of the dell where the river is sometimes seen but oftener only heard and where it's sequestered haunts are seldom interrupted by human curiosity The eye is often carried many fathoms below into these depths of  solitude and is as often arrested in midway by the spreading tops of trees from whence getting passage perhaps again through some opening among them it is baffled a second time by the darkness of the recess The splendid tints of sunshine  sleeping  as Shakespear phrases it upon the tops of the trees and the deep shadows be∣neath them afforded the strongest contrast and were blended with the most perfect harmony an effect which nature is wonderful in pro∣ducing but which art without great atten∣tion will fail in attempting It is much easier to carry off justly a light or shade and blend it gradually with it's opposite than to manage with just expression the extremes of either when brought into contact Amu∣sing as these views were they would have been more so if the edge of the precipice on which we travelled had been better guarded Our attention in some degree was engaged by our danger  Along the side of Glenlion we missed our road and instead of taking the direct way to Taymouth we went six miles round by general Wade's bridge This we had rea∣son to esteem good fortune What we missed we knew not but the country we  gained was uncommonly beautiful It is of that species which may be technically termed  a planovalley  Before us stretched a cham∣paign of four or five miles in length and near two in breadth Through the middle of it ran a winding road On the right it was skreened by a mountain wooded with clumps and varied with objects at such a distance as throws that equivocal veil over them in which the eye so much delights The conclusion only of this mountain could be introduced in a picture but the whole was beautiful in nature The opposite skreen of the valley was still bolder more rocky and equally picturesque The middle was occupied by a fine distance of retiring moun∣tains  At the bottom of the righthand mountain ran the Tay but it kept out of sight till we had passed the bridge It then took the lead among the objects that entertained us and presented us with two or three fine reaches in one of which especially the mountains water and wood combined with peculiar beauty in picturesque composition  LOCHTAY  Soon after we came to Kenmore which is a neat little town built by Lord Breadal∣bin at the foot of Lochtay Nothing can stand more sweetly the lake is spread on one side of it and on the other are Lord Breadal∣bin's improvements  The view of the lake from the rising grounds near the church is capital On the right a lofty mountain falls into the water and forms a grand promontory It's lines at the base are finely broken by a wooded island Another promontory projects from the opposite shore and both together form the water into a spacious bay Between the two promontories the distant mountains recede in perspective and the lake goes off in the form of another bay We seldom meet with a grander piece of lakescenery  Having taking this first view of the lake we embarked upon it expecting that as it's reaches opened our entertainment would in∣crease But having continued our voyage near a league we found no part equal to what we first saw  One inducement to this voyage was a cascade on the banks of the lake which had been represented to us as an uncom∣mon piece of scenery A pompous preface so often produces disappointment that expect∣ing a disappointment here we were agreeably surprized We found a very beautiful scene It is not indeed of so sublime a kind as that of the Hermitage at Dunkeld It is of a ta∣mer nature gliding down an excavated rock but meeting with interruption enough to give it variety It's accompaniments are very beautiful The rock it falls from is lofty and well broken and it graces the center of a little woody the∣atre which nature seems to have made on purpose for it and where it is shewn to much advantage Lord Breadalbin to whom it be∣longs introduces the stranger to it through a sort of subterranean passage the necessity of which did not appear It is an exhibition which wants no aid to give it consequence  In our return we had a view of the church and bridge of Kenmore and of the mountains and island in it's neighbourhoood but from so low a point they lost much of their digni∣ty We landed also upon the island but found little to amuse us  And yet this island small and contemptible as it appears has more than one history an∣nexed to it Here stood formerly a small but elegant priory dedicated by Alexander the first of Scotland to the memory of his belov∣ed queen who was the natural daughter of Henry the first of England At his death it was more liberally endowed and he entrusted the repose of his own soul as well as his queen's to the prayers of pious monks whom he established for that purpose in this religious retirement Often in the calm still hour of evening or before the sun had risen upon the mountains the boatman plying his course would rest on his oars to listen to the chanted hymn or early matins as they came floating in the breeze along the surface of the lake  In after times this island wore another face When the bravery of Montrose carried every thing before him in defence of the royal cause which was nearly in it's wane in England a numerous body of Campbells against whom the rigour of Montrose was chiefly directed took possession of this island where they forti∣fied themselves among the ruins Montrose took and garrisoned it and it continued in  the hands of the loyalists till when general Monk retook it It would now how∣ever be difficult to trace the least vestige in it either of religion or war  SECT XVI  HAVING finished our voyage we took a walk to Taymouth lord Breadal∣bin's seat where we met with little to engage our curiosity The house stands on a lawn between two mountains which open to the lake tho the architect has contrived to skreen it intirely from the view of the water The lawn is about a mile in breadth diversified with a great variety of ground Under the southern mountain a quarter of a mile be∣hind the house runs the Tay which tho not so grand a river as we found it at Dun∣keld is however a noble and rapid stream The banks of the river the lawn and the mountains around are all well cloathed with wood and the whole scene is capable of great improvement but when we saw it  In the year  nothing like taste had been exercised upon it  The house was formerly a turreted castle and is now by the addition of two wings a large convenient tho unpleasing mansion The grounds around it were laid out with little beauty and the walks were formal and ill contrived pacing under the paling of the park instead of winding around and taking such circuits as might shew the lake and mountains to most advantage There was a grand walk also beyond the Tay which had cost more than it deserved Indeed the walks on neither side of the river seemed intended to shew the scenery but rather as avenues to a few tawdry inelegant buildings which terminated them Nothing could shew a more thorough inattention to every idea of beauty and taste than the whole contrivance of the place  Perhaps no country in the world abounds more with grand situations especially in the highland parts of it than Scotland and per∣haps none of the Scotch nobility have a greater variety of noble situations than the earls of Breadalbin Whether they wished for ele∣vated or sheltered situationsfor views of wood of water or of mountainsthey had  choice of every kind When therefore we see a situation so unhappily chosen in the neighbourhood of such a scene as LochTay we are apt to think it required some inge∣nuity and contrivance to fix it The situ∣ation indeed in itself would not be so bad if we did not see every where around it situations that are so much better  Of all the views which a great house should wish to command I think  a noble distance  is the most desirable This was the opinion of Horace He commends the house  longos quae prospicit agros  And I think he is right  Distant views  if there is a good foreground are generally the most pleasing as they contain the greatest variety both in themselves and in their accidental variations But if you have before your windows a beautiful lake retiring among mountains into remote distance as lord Bread∣albin might have had adorned with woody banks and tufted islands while his house might have been skreened from the rough quarters of the sky it is all one would wish for in a situation  As we left lord Breadalbin's we had from the road near Maxwell's temple a very pic∣turesque view of the lake and it's environs The water bears only a small proportion but the promontories sweeping into it the islands detached from the main and a distant view of the grand mountain of Benavoir which occupies the head of the lake unite in form∣ing a very noble landscape  In this country originated the massacre of Glencoe The fact is noted but a detail of circumstances does not often find it's way into history  I believe Dr Smollet is the only  historian  who enters into the  detail  of this shocking affair  They who have never met with this detail will be shocked to find in the seventeenth century an action marked with such circumstances of horrid cruelty and treachery as are rarely found in the annals of a Roman or an Eastern despot  After the  act of settlement  had passed in Scotland as well as in England in favour of king William and the government ex∣pected submission from all it's subjects a number of the highlandclans bowed with  great reluctance to the new yoke Many ineffectual efforts having been made to bring them to a better mind the  ratio ultima regum  was at length resolved on and a proclama∣tion was issued which threatened them with military execution if they did not take the oaths before the beginning of the year This measure carried strong conviction into the Highlands and made several converts to the principles of the revolution Many how∣ever could ill brook the idea of what they esteemed so arbitrary a proceeding and among these the loudest was Macdonald of Glencoe This haughty chief in opposition to all the persuasions of his friends would exclaim with eager asseverations that he would suffer any extremity rather than submit "When I take arms against them he would cry let them send their military executioners but while my opinions keep at home they injure no man" Notwithstanding however this lofty language as the day of grace began to expire his fears for his wife his children and his dependents got the better of his indignation and he made his submission at Inverary be∣fore the sheriff of the county tho through  an unavoidable accident three or four days after the allotted period  This chief it seems in the violence of the times a little before the revolution had plun∣dered the lands of the earl of Breadalbin For this and some other acts of animosity that nobleman it is thought had devoted him to destruction and is accused of per∣suading king William to put him and all his clan under military execution as a terror to other disaffected parts of the Highlands No inquiry therefore was made whether Macdonald had submitted or would submit but a warrant for putting to death near two hundred innocent people was dispatched with as little ceremony as if it had been an order to apprehend a smuggler This horrid war∣rant having passed through all the usual forms was brought to the king who signed it it is said without scruple tho I think it is probable that Macdonald's  submission  was con∣cealed from him Bishop Burnet indeed  See his history of his own times  endeavours to make the king intirely ignorant of the whole affair He was rather dilatory the bishop says in business and used to put  off signing papers till they began to multi∣ply when he would sign them in a lump with too little examination In this preci∣pitate manner he gives us to understand the king signed the fatal warrant against the in∣habitants of Glencoe  From the king it was directed to the se∣cretary of state in Scotland who sent it in the course of business to the commanding officer of Argyle's regiment then in garrison at Fort William  Early in February a detachment from that corps took possession of the valley of Glencoe and when Macdonald inquired into their intention he was told it was friend∣ly and had in view only to levy the arrears of some illpaid taxes Upon this Macdo∣nald and his dependents laid aside all appre∣hensions as indeed having submitted to go∣vernment they had no grounds to harbour any and entertained the troops hospitably during the space of fifteen days  On the evening of the sixteenth day young Macdonald observed the guards were doubled and thought he saw something among the troops which he did not well understand He brought his suspicions to his father but  the old man endeavoured with jocularity to disperse them The youth however at the close of day drew his brother aside and carried him out privately among the soldiers to make observations Approaching a guard under the cover of the night they overheard a centinel tell his fellow that  It was a brutal work but their officers must answer for it  Upon this the two young men in terror made instantly to the  father's house but the bloody deed was begun As they approached they heard the report of fire arms they heard the shrieks of despair and saw the house surrounded by armed men Old Macdonald was shot through the head as he slept by his wife and at the same time a Highland gentleman who was then upon a visit to him tho he had the king's pro∣tection in his pocket The houses of the tenants and dependents of the family were surrounded also and every man butchered who was found A pillage ensued and all the wanton cruelty was practised which is customary at the sacking of a town  The women and children indeed were spared but such of them as had neither died of the fright nor had been butchered by mis∣take  were turned out naked at the dead of nighta keen freezing nightwith all their calamities about them into a waste covered with snow  When the morning rose the horrid deed appeared in all it's guilt Thirtyeight slaughtered bodies were drawn out and the women who had never attempted to fly were in general found either starved to death or expiring with their children under hedges It was thought that about a hundred of those destined to slaughter had escaped through the intelligence given them by their friends among the troops  This horrid affair was never sufficiently examined King William endeavoured to repel the odium from himself by throwing it upon the Scotch secretary who had exceeded he said his orders But various circumstances and especially the lenity shewn to all concerned in this business rendered such an apology very defective  The king sent orders says Burnet to inquire into the matter but when the letters writ upon this business were all examined which I myself read it appeared that so many were involved in the matter that  the king's gentleness prevailed on him to a fault and he contented himself with dismissing only the master of Stair from his service Indeed the not punishing this with due rigour was the greatest blot in this whole reign  We did not see the valley of Glencoe as it would have carried us too far out of our road but it is described as one of the most inte∣resting scenes in the whole country hung with rock and wood and abounding with beauties of the most romantic kind This valley is famous also for being the birth place of Oscian In it's wild scenes that bard is said to have caught his first poetic raptures Near it lies the country of Morven which Fingal hath turned into classic ground by his huntings and his wars  SECT XVII  FROM Kenmore we proposed great plea∣sure in our ride to Killin which was our next stage It lies at the head of the lake which is about fifteen miles long and as the road kept almost intirely by the water side we expected many beautiful scenes But we were disappointed We had seen the lake in it's greatest glory from Kenmore It never spreads into any considerable expanse of water but has the appearance rather of a river of unequal dimensions Where it is widest it seldom exceeds a mile but in general it is much narrower Nor are it's boundaries plea∣sing They exhibit no bold shores broken promontories nor other forms of beauty but are rather tame hills than picturesque moun∣tains Nor are they furnished with wood or other pleasing appendagesUpon the whole however as the evening was cold  sour and unpleasant it is probable that it tinged the landscape with similar ideas The effect is common A clear evening might have dispelled these gloomy visions which we attributed to the landscape and might have opened new beauties I have heard indeed judicious travellers who have seen it under a more favourable aspect speak of many grand views from advantageous stands along the shores of the lake Of this I have not the least doubt and am only unhappy in not being able to add my own testimony to what I have heard  As we approached Killin the country began to amend and pleased us in spite of the untoward medium of a drizzling rain through which we viewed it Many of the hills were cloathed with wood and some of them finely disposed skreening little irriguous vallies which played among them But as the evening grew worse and set in wet we could not examine the landscape as it deserved In general however the two ends of LochTay are certainly the most beautiful parts of it  The town of Killin is celebrated for being the receptacle of the bones of Fingal We  were shewn the place where tradition says they were buried but the traveller must view his tomb with the eye of faith Not the least monumental fragment remains  At Killin we heard the little history of a Highland migration Several expeditions of this kind to America from different parts of Scotland which were supposed to have been attended with success began to make a noise in the country and a discontented spirit got abroad even in those parts where no oppres∣sion could be complained of particularly in the domains of the earl of Breadalbin the happiness of whose tenants seems to have been among the principal sources of the happiness of their lord The  word was given  as it was phrased in the beginning of March and a rendezvous was appointed at Killin on the first of the ensuing May Here convened about thirty families making in all above three hundred people The first night they spent at Killin in barns and other outhouses which they had previously engaged Early the next morning the whole company was called together by the sound of bagpipes and the order of their march was settled Men women and children had all their  proper stations assigned They were all dressed in their best attire and the men were armed in the Highland fashion They who were able hired carts for their baggage the rest distributed it in proper proportions among the several members of their little families each of them in the patriarchal style  carrying provisions for the way  Then taking a long adieu of their friends and rela∣tions who gathered round them the music began to play and in the midst of a thousand good wishes mutually distributed the whole train moved on  Goldsmith in his deserted village gives a melancholy picture of a body of emigrants taking a last farewell of their country  Even now methinks as pondering here I stand  I see the rural virtues leave the land  Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail  That idly waiting flaps in every gale  Downward they move a melancholy band  Pass from the shore and darken all the strand  But these emigrants were of a different stamp Many of them were possessed of two or three hundred pounds and few of less than thirty or forty which at least shewed they had not starved upon their farms They were  a jocund crew and set out not like people flying from the face of poverty but like men who were about to carry their health their strength and little property to a better mar∣ket The first day's march brought them to LochLomond which is about twentyfive or thirty miles from Killin At the head of this lake they had provided vessels in which the greater part of them embarked and were carried by water twentyfour miles farther into the neighbourhood of Dunbar∣ton where they cantoned themselves till their transport vessel was ready at Grenock  We proposed also to visit LochLomond and Dunbarton but not by the rout of these emigrants which would have abridged our tour We chose a wider circuit by Tindrum and Inverary  From the pleasing environs of Killin we launched out into a wild country which na∣ture had barely produced but had done little to adorn Neither had art ever deigned to visit it except in the shape of a soldier work∣ing on a military road Even the cottage smoking among a few trees which almost every heath presents was not here to be found All was wide waste and rude to∣tally  naked and yet in it's simplicity often sublime the ground heaving like the ocean into ample swells and subsiding into vallies equally magnificent The ideas were grand rather than pleasing The imagination was interested but not the eye Here and there indeed a mountainscene fell within the rules of composition But in general we had few forms of picturesque beauty at least in the larger parts In the smaller we often found them in the winding of rivulets in their rocky beds and in their little bustling cascades of which we had great variety  The ground plot if I may so call it of this rude landscape was a wild valley  ascend∣ing  through the space of twenty miles from Killin to Tindrum It could not be called steep yet was generally steep enough to give rapidity to the rocky rivulet which adorned it This rivulet is one of the chief sources of LochTay but it does not assume the name of the Tay till it leave the lake About the middle of this ascent the country becoming flat we found the torrent arrested by a valley and formed into a small lake called LochDochart the shores of which afforded us some fine scenery both when we  saw it in extent for tho it was small it had dimensions sufficient for any landscape and when we saw only a portion of it In the former situation the distant hills made an agreeable boundary to the water In the lat∣ter we had a huge promontory hanging over a castle which stood upon an island at it's feet  The great picturesque use of islands in these situations is to break the tedious lines of such promontories and mountains as fall into the water But this island besides it's use in composition is itself an object of beauty It is decorated with wood and adorned with a castle  Castles in the middle of lakes tho not proper for regal fortresses were commonly chosen as seats of security by those chiefs who had the advantage of such situations The islandcastle could only be attacked by water In summer the lake could not af∣ford navigation to carry over a body of men and in winter the ice formed so exposed an approach that troops would hardly attempt it There was no covering above ground and the mattock could make none beneath This castle however was once stormed by the M'greggors in the midst of a frosty winter by a well contrived project They brought  a vast quantity of fascines to the edge of the lake with which they made a stout breastwork This they pushed before them along the smooth surface of the ice and being sufficiently defended by it from the shot of the castle they made good their landing if I may so speak and quickly overpowered the place which trusted more in it's situation than in the strength of it's garrison  About Tindrum we had attained the sum∣mit of our ascent This place is supposed to be one of the highest inhabited parts of Scotlandsome say of GreatBritain The word Breadalbin in which country we now travelled has that signification  Among the mountains which compose these wild scenes the mountains of Bendoran are the most conspicuous The countrypeople consider them as inchanted mountains Before the storm begins to rage they emit a hollow sound which forebodes it The shepherd knows it well and instantly shelters his flock Sounds however of this kind are not peculiar to mount Bendoran They are often mentioned among the signs of bad weather They were prognostics of ancient times  Altis  Montibus audiri fragor  At Tindrum the ground which had been rising from LochTay begins  immediately  to fall The Tay which takes it's source at the summit of this elevation runs due east and a little lake within a quarter of a mile of the fountains of the Tay discharges it's waters due west Along the banks of this little bustling stream we descended through a valley wild like that we had left behind and nearly in the same style of landscape but of quicker descent  Near Dalmaly the view opened upon a rich cultivated country at least such it appeared a sight we had not met with for many days We thought it could hardly be composed of the plains of Lorn tho that is the richest part of Argyleshire and lay directly before the eye but our maps seemed to place Lorn at too great a distance and we had no op∣portunity of inquiring The remote distance however was dubious and tho it appeared to us a cultivated scene it might have been through some deception in the light The  nearer grounds were varied by a part of LochAwe towards which we approached  LochAwe is one of the grandest lakes in Scotland It extends thirty miles and con∣tains near a dozen islands We skirted only it's northern shores but were much amused with what we saw On the opposite shore arises in appearance almost perpendicular to the lake the vast mountain of Crouachan near enough for the eye to distinguish it's woods and rocks Beneath it on an island stands the castle of Kilchurn which is a grand object under the impending gloom of the mountains This castle was built originally by the Lady of one of the Campbells who went to the holy wars Here in solitary retirement she mourned his absence and waited his return In after ages the castle of Kilchurn taking a more dignified form became the seat of the earls of Breadal∣bin and was admired chiefly for the view it commanded over the lake and over a rich vale bounded by lofty mountains It afterwards be∣came a fortress and when the rebellion broke out in the year was hastily fortified by Lord Breadalbin for the government and garrisoned to defend this pass into the Highlands which intention I believe it fully answered  Besides this island we had two others in view both woody and both very ornamental On one of them stood formerly a convent We had also a long extent of water before us The lake winds slowly and falls off in good perspective exhibiting a great variety of bays promontories and large peninsulas In many parts also the scenery around it was woody but yet on the whole it had rather an unpicturesque appearance The islands are formally stationed and many of the moun∣tainskreens which are unadorned with wood are tame and unbroken  We took two drawings however upon this lake In one of them two of the islands appeared with great advantage and the moun∣tainskreens behind them consisting only of simple parts were magnificent  The other view was more contracted and exhibited a large promontory under which stood the island with the ruins of Kilchurncastle The constituent parts of this latter view are the same as those we had observed upon LochDochart but it is one of nature's samenesses it is  alter et idem  There the island appeared connected with the promon∣tory under which it stood here it appeared  detached from the lake and connected with the foreground In each situation the islands broke the lines of the promontories and had a good effect But the island on LochAwe afforded the better picture  Both these lakes deserved more attention than we were able to pay them We wished to make a circuit round them and view them in various points The islands upon LochAwe however formal they might appear in some views would unquestionably have a fine effect in many other situations and pro∣montories which on one side appeared smooth tame and unadorned might appear broken animated and rich on another but our time was limited and we were obliged to satisfy our curiosity with little more than a view of such parts as the road presented  From the neighbourhood of LochAwe we pursued our rout to Inverarycastle the prin∣cipal seat of the duke of Argyle A very long and dreary ride had made us languish for the contrast of a little woody scenery when the forests rose as if by inchantment vast rich and luxuriant Whole mountains  in a great degree were covered with woods of ancient standing which sinking into their deep shadowy recesses or standing out boldly upon their knolls in broad masses enlightened by the sun wonderfully charmed the eye both with the greatness and novelty of the scene They seemed planted to exemplify the following precept  Does then the song forbid the planter's hand  To clothe the distant hills and veil with woods  Their barren summits No but it forbids  All poverty of cloathing Rich the robe  And amply let it flow that nature wears  On her throned eminence Where'er she takes  Her horizontal march pursue her step  With sweeping train of forest hill to hill  Unite with prodigality of shade  Some powerful hand it was evident had been at work in cloathing the naked sides of all these vast ridges and we might have known by the noble decoration of the scene that we were in the dominions of some po∣tent chieftain tho we had not known it by the geography of the country Every moment we looked when the castle would open to our view But we travelled at least four miles among these Alpine plantations before we arrived at it  Situation of  INVERARY CASTLE  SECT XVIII  INVERARYCASTLE fully answered the grandeur of the approach It seems equally adapted to all the purposes of great∣ness beauty and accommodation It stands upon a gentle rise the ground gradually sloping from it in various directions The area which surrounds it is spacious con∣taining two or three miles in circumference and is bounded behind the castle by a semicircular skreen of mountains rising in different forms some of them broken and others adorned with wood so that the castle stands in a kind of mountainrecess open in front where it commands a spacious view over LochFyne One of these mountains called Doniquaick is a noble spirited object It's sides are shaggy and broken and the inter∣stices of soil are filled with wood On it's summit stands a lonely watchtower which  like every thing characteristic has a good effect Had it been an ornamental building of any kind thus loftily seated it had been absurd  At the foot of this mountain runs the Aray a considerable stream It issues through a narrow valley behind the house and taking a semicircular sweep around it at the bottom of the lawn enters LochFyne  This lake which is the glory of the scene spreads into a noble bay before the front of the castle forming an irregular circle of about twelve or fourteen miles in circumference beautifully indented with a variety of penin∣sulas and surrounded by mountains It is an object not only beautiful in itself but it makes a fine contrast with the woods and mountains around it  LochFyne is a salt lake communicating with the sea at the distance of about twentyfive miles from Inverary castle but as the tide has no very great effect upon it here it has almost all the beauties of an inland lake and some which an inland lake cannot have particularly that of a very crouded navigation It is one of the favourite haunts of herring and at certain seasons of the year is frequented by innumerable shoals The countrypeople  express the quantities of this fish in strong language At those seasons they say the lake contains one part water and two parts fish In this single bay of the lake we were told that above six hundred boats are sometimes employed in taking them The groups of these little fishing vessels with their circling nets make a beautiful moving picture which is frequently varied by vessels of a larger size shooting athwart threading the several little knots of anchoring barks and making their  tacks  in every direction  The herringboats commonly take their station on the lake as the evening comes on and if all this moving picture should happen to be enlightened with a splendid sun set the effect is very fine The crews of these boats seem generally to be a cheerful happy race Among the implements of each boat the bag∣pipe is rarely forgotten the shrill melody of which you hear constantly resounding from every part except when all hands are at work On Sunday the mirth of the several crews is changed into devotion as you walk by the side of the lake if the evening be still you hear them singing psalms instead of playing on the bagpipe  The mountain of Doniquaick and the lake are two very harmonious neighbours in every point in which they are brought together We saw them contrasted in several forms and always beautifully One of the grandest views of the whole may be taken somewhere about the newinn The mountain of Doni∣quaicka bridge over the Araythe lake and the mountains which skreen it all unite in very pleasing composition  From the bay which LochFyne forms before the castle of Inverary run two grand openings one to the northeast into the country and the other to the southwest towards the sea but all appearance of these outlets is excluded from the castle by the folding of the mountains I mean not by this remark to express any peculiar excellence in the circular form of a bay This particular one indeed contains great variety and is very beautiful in it's kind but still there is in general more variety and more beauty in the fading distance of a lake going off in per∣spective  The castle of Inverary is new but con∣structed in the old castle form The ground plot is square and each corner is adorned  with a round tower In the middle rises a square one which is higher than the rest and gives a picturesque apex to the building The whole is grand and makes an appearance suitable to the scene Yet there are two very disgusting parts about it These are the square appendages which are tacked to each side of the middle tower for the purpose of furnishing the interior apartments of the castle with light The contrivance is awkward and greatly injures a noble pile The inside seems to be admirably divided into grand and convenient rooms but it is yet unfinished At the entrance is a guard chamber which in most private houses would be ridiculous but in a Highland castle is characteristic and gives an uncommon dignity  In one of the apartments we were struck with a number of small paintings in a fine old mellow style but all of them evi∣dently by the same hand Upon examining them more attentively we found them all copies from pictures we knew some of which were very modern Enquiring farther into the mystery we were informed they were all the work of the present duchess of Argyle and were in fact mezzotintoprints varnished  with gumcopal and painted on the back in a manner lately invented I have seen no invention of the kind that has so much merit Coloured prints are in general miserable daubings  The method here mentioned of colouring mezzotinto prints was at this time just invented and was sold under promise of secresy to many ladies    This noble castle was built by Archibald duke of Argyle who finished little more than the shell but his ideas seem to have been so grand that it is probable he would have struck out something beyond the taste of the times in the improvements around it if he had lived to complete his designs One great work he had in view was to remove the whole town of Inverary which was in∣deed a great nuisance to him Part of it had even straggled between the castle and the lake and the whole a dirty illbuilt hamlet was a disgrace to the scene With a grandeur of conception equal to his other designs the duke resolved to pull the whole down and rebuild it upon a peninsula in the lake about half a mile from his castle The situation was admirably chosen at least for the benefit  of the town tho it may still perhaps a little interfere with the views of the castle par∣ticularly of that down the lake towards the south The duke proceeded so far in his plan as to build a noble row of houses one of which is an inn and another a custom house but his death prevented the completion of this grand design  In his successor's time all operations were at a stand but the present duke has called his workmen again together He has already removed as much of the old town as was a nuisance to himself but whether he means to carry his predecessor's full intention into exe∣cution does not yet appear  I am informed that all the old town is now removed  About the castle however he is making great improvements and as far as he has yet done in a very good taste A grand walk is conducted over a noble bridge at the foot of Doniquaick and along the banks of the river from which an offset carries you in a spiral up the moun∣tain From the watchtower at the sum∣mit we were informed that one of the grandest views in Scotland is exhibited over  LochFyne and the neighbouring mountains But a wet morning prevented our seeing it  In a word as Inverarycastle has one of the noblest situations that can be conceived it will probably in a few years be as well worth visiting as any place in Britain if the improvements continue in the same style of simplicity and grandeur in which they are begun No place we had yet seen in Scot∣land if we except Hopetonhouse can bear the least comparison with it If we found fault with any thing it was with some little decorations and cascadework upon the river but as these things might have been executed be∣fore and may easily be altered all censure should cease till the whole be finished  We had now almost completed our tour through the Highlands of Scotland Inverary being the last town of any consequence we visited in that district and through our whole journey were greatly pleased both with the face of the country and with the manners of the inhabitants The former may pro∣bably have some effect upon the latter The  extremes of heat and cold produce nearly per∣haps the same effect The savage under a southern clime is languid and inert under a northern one benumbed and torpid It is in the middle regions that we find the boldest and most spirited exertions I speak of men in a barbarous state Civilization brings all to a level The early and un∣civilized native of this country seems to have had great vigour of mind and body but it was the vigour of a wild beast Indolence and activity took their turns in his breast Every passion had it's course and when it's rage was spent he sunk into sloth He was easily offended fierce in his anger and im∣placable in his revenge he shed blood without remorse  Some years ago an old manuscript was printed at Glasgow under the title of  Feuds and conflicts among the Scottish clans  It con∣tains many anecdotes very descriptive of the ancient manners of the country One little history I shall present to the reader from the materials  See page c and page c  which it furnishes and the coincident circumstances of the times It is  an account of the petty wars between Angus Macdonald of Kintire and Sir Laughlan Mac∣lean of the Isle of Mull and is both curi∣ous in itself and will give a better idea of the ancient state of the Highlands than any systematic inquiry It is likewise nearly connected with the scenes we are now sur∣veying The characters too are drawn from the life and well marked  SECT XIX  ABOUT two centuries ago it happened that Donald Gorme a gentleman of the isle of Sky proposing to visit his relation Angus Macdonald of Kintire was driven by adverse winds into Invernookbay in the isle of Jura This place belonged to Sir Laughlan Maclean who happened to be there himself at that time tho his principal residence was in Mull  In Jura also by an unusual concurrence of circumstances happened to lurk some outlaws whom Donald Gorme for certain offences had lately driven from their country These fugitives understanding to whom the vessel in the bay belonged and not having  it in their power to injure Gorme themselves contrived a very malicious scheme to draw upon him the resentment of Maclean In the silence of the night they drove some of Maclean's cattle towards the bay and carried them off not doubting but the suspicion would rest on Gorme  Suspicion is the evidence of barbarians Maclean a young fiery chief without farther inquiry collected his clan the next night fell upon Gorme and killed sixteen of his people Gorme himself and a few of his followers with difficulty escaped  When Angus Macdonald of Kintire to whom Gorme's visit had been intended heard of this disaster he was much distressed and the more as he was nearly related to both parties He was first cousin to Gorme and had married the sister of Maclean Fearing therefore the consequences of the affair he resolved to employ his good office in making it up  His first efforts were in the isle of Sky were he found Gorme not untractable From thence he sailed to Mull proposing an in∣terview with Maclean at CastleDuart the  place of his residenceBut his friends advised him to be cautious  As the Scottish government inclined to aristocracy it had ever been the regal policy to divide the clans and to this end the crown on feudal principles would often take the occasion of very slight pretences to grant some favoured chief a claim on the lands of his more obnoxious neighbour These grants being commonly obtained when families were at va∣riance gave a kind of sanction to their quar∣rels  A claim of this kind had formerly it seems been granted to the Macleans upon some lands in Ilay which belonged to the Macdonalds and tho the claim had long lain dormant and the families were now united by marriage yet the friends of Mac∣donald advised him not to put himself in the hands of a youth whose character was little known and whom for that reason it was imprudent to trust But Macdonald naturally frank and generous and unacquaint∣ed with fear could not conceive that a man whom he had never offended and whose sister he had married could possibly intend him ill He went therefore with all confi∣dence  to CastleDuart and even left the greatest part of his retinue behind  Maclean received him courteously and gave him hopes that Gorme's conditions might be the basis of an agreement and put an end to the unhappy affair between them But in the hour of retirement other thoughts possessed him The secret whispers of interest and am∣bition intervened and all scruples of integrity and honour were thrown aside Before the morn∣ing he had settled the whole affair in his own mind and with a confident air informed his astonished guest that he must expect to spend his future life in captivity unless he gave up all title to the disputed lands in Ilay The unfortunate Macdonald had no choice He was obliged to submit and to leave his son and brother as pledges of his faith  This act of perfidy roused all the spirit of Macdonald The affair of Invernookbay was forgotten The quarrel was now his own But being as cool as he was determined not the slightest whisper of discontent passed his lips All appearance of resentment was stifled till he could shew it with effect  It was necessary it seems for Maclean in person to take possession of those lands which had thus been ceded to him He  went therefore to Ilay and encamped his little company upon the ruins of a fort near the Kinnes which was the name of the lands he was going to possess  It was a custom among the highland chiefs to invite all strangers to their houses and make them welcome as long as their pro∣vision lasted When this was consumed the master of the family accompanied them to his next neighbour's where their visit was limit∣ed by the same necessity This chief also join∣ed the procession and thus they went on increasing their company and devouring the provisions of a whole district  Of this jovial custom and the inconvenient situation of the camp of Kinnes Macdonald took the advantage He offered Maclean the use of his own habitation at Mullintrea and describing his neighbours as disposed to mirth and jollity wished him to pay a friend∣ly visit among them observing that his retinue which was numerous and especially his hostages would effectually secure him from any affront  Credulity is as much the characteristic of a state of barbarism as suspicion Maclean with little hesitation complied and scrupled  not to accept an invitation from a man with whom he had just before broken every rite of hospitality  But other thoughts than those of merriment possessed the mind of Macdonald He had privately sent orders to his clan to rendezvous in arms at an appointed place and at mid∣night to surround a house which he had appropriated for the reception of Maclean The habitation of a highland chief was a little town consisting of various appendages many of which were detached  The carousal which had purposely been prolonged to a late hour was now over all were retired to rest and the highlandclan had taken their appointed stand around the lodgings of Maclean when Macdonald in a peremptory tone calling loud at the window of his guest ordered him to come down The alarmed chief started from his bed and seeing through the lattice the house surrounded by armed men he cursed his own imprudence gave up all for lost and opened the door holding the young son of Macdonald his hostage before his breast to prevent any sudden attack But Macdonald assured him that nothing against his life was intended  The possession of his person was all he desired and having obtained this he proclaimed liberty to all the rest of Maclean's followers Two of them only were excepted who were thought to have been their chief's principal advisers With these Macdonald made short work ordering fire to the outhouse in which they lodged and leaving them to perish in the flames  Maclean had scarce taken possession of his dungeon when a plot nearer home was contrived to compleat his ruin One of his near relations Allen Maclean thinking this a favourable opportunity to serve his own interest spread a report that Maclean had sent secret orders to put Macdonald's brother to death who had been left as an hostage in Mull In consequence of this he hoped that Macdonald would retaliate upon his prisoner while he himself being pre∣pared might seize the estate His contrivance miscarried in it's principal aim tho it had horrid consequences Macdonald believing the report massacred in his rage all the retinue of Maclean above eighty men who had not yet left the island Maclean himself  he spared reserving him probably for a more exemplary punishment  The superiority of Macdonald in this con∣test and his own personal abilities began now to raise the jealousy of the little court of Inverary The territories of Kintire which lay upon the shores of LochFyne were contiguous to those of Argyle and the large island of Ilay which belonged also to Macdonald was immediately upon the coast These insular possessions gave him the con∣  quence of a maritime power he had a navy in his ports and could have carried a sudden war up LochFyne to the very walls of In∣verary So potent a neighbour therefore became matter of just alarm Many councils were called and it was at length resolved to raise a body of forces ostensively to adjust the quarrel between these contending chiefs but really to check the power of Macdonald  The earl of Argyle however soon found he had embarked in a matter above his strength Macdonald had address in council and abilities in the field beyond the barbarism of the times in which he lived and put on so resolute a countenance that Argyle thought it prudent to draw back His attempts took  a safer channel He made an application to the king whom by certain arguments he induced to come forward in the affair James the sixth who was then king of Scotland menaced in his usual tone of magnificence but a highland chief tho of a secondary order would not easily at that day submit to a royal mandate when issued from such a prince as James  It happened however that Macdonald was himself at this time disposed to settle his dif∣ference with Maclean He had just engaged to assist the quarrel of a neighbouring chief upon the coast of Ireland and wished to transport himself into that country as soon as he could On some rigid conditions therefore and the delivery of several hostages Maclean was set at liberty  Neither prudence foresight nor contrivance mark the events of savage war every man seizes his prey like a wildbeast either by open force or by a sudden spring when it is off it's guard He considers not whether he is able to maintain the quarrel He begins it with temerity and thinks not beyond the first attackThus Macdonald had no sooner embarked for Ireland than Maclean incited probably by the counsel and assistance of  Argyle entered Ilay with fire and sword He had every reason to believe that Macdonald would put his hostages to instant death but he gave up every motive to the gratification of revenge  Macdonald however with unusual gener∣osity scorned to revenge a public quarrel upon a few unfortunate individuals The innocent blood he shed at Mullintrea had probably taught him this lesson of humanity But he was rapid in taking open vengeance He instantly transported his troops from Ire∣land into the isle of Mull which he burned ravaged and destroyed from one end to the other The clan Lean could make no re∣sistance flying before him like sheep whom the raging chief sometimes slaughtered in a scattered pursuit and sometimes driving them in bodies into corners of the island butchered in a promiscuous heap Cattle and every thing of value he carried off and left the place smoking under the effects of his vengeance  Nullum in barbaris saevitiae genus omittit ira et victoria  Tacitus    Maclean in the mean time was not back∣ward in retaliating but finding himself un∣able to cope with the prowess of Macdonald he had as usual recourse to perfidy  John Macean of the kindred of Macdonald had in peaceable times expressed a great at∣tachment to Maclean's mother who was then a blooming widow The disposal of a mo∣ther in marriage was it seems among the privileges of a highlandchief and Maclean was eager to bring on this match in expecta∣tion that it might be the mean of alluring his new fatherinlaw into a confderacy against Macdonald Macean heard with pleasure that his proposals would be accepted and came to Mull with great joy where the marriage was solemnized But after the nup∣tials when Maclean sounded him about a league against Macdonald the proposal was received with disdain Macean would not hear of acting so perfidious a part against his friend his patron and his near relation  In revenge for this disappointment Mac∣lean with a brutality almost unparalleled broke at midnight into Macean's chamber tore him from his bride put him to death  and killed eighteen of his men who ran to assist their chief  Barbarous as the country was an act like this was received with horror The massa∣cre at Mullintrea had thrown no odium on Mac∣donald He was pitied for a mistake But  Macean's nuptials  became a proverb to express every thing that was vile and shocking in human nature  This horrid deed seemed the expiring act of despair The credit which Maclean had lost accrued of course to Macdonald and all Scotland acknowledged the inequality of the contest between them The king saw it with concern and considered the chief who press∣ed before his peers as disturbing the balance of the aristocracy and trespassing on the royal authority  In this light Macdonald appeared at court where James incited by suspicion and jea∣lousy determined to curb his influence That prince ever inclined to an oblique path instead of boldly calling the man to account as he might legally have done who in the open defiance of law durst presume to re∣venge his own quarrel had recourse to an act of perfidy He pretended great zeal to serve  two kinsmen who ought to be so dear to each other he cajoled them with the kindest expressions and gave each of them a safe conduct to Edinburgh where he promised to make up the matter to the satisfaction of both The method he took to settle their differences if we except the perfidy of it was sensible enough He shut them both up together in Edinburghcastle and left them to manage the dispute by themselves This conference brought affairs to a speedy issue The two chiefs tired of their com∣pany and confinement made the king every promise he desired and to recover their li∣berty left their sons as hostages for their fu∣ture behaviour  A peace during several years ensued But the highland quarrel of those days was never worn out Macdonald growing old and leaving the management of his affairs to his son who was a mere youth the revenge and ambition of Maclean again took fire He got his old claims on Ilay confirmed and enlarged by a new grant from the crown and at the head of his clan entered the island  Young Macdonald hearing of his prepar∣ations raised forces likewise and appeared in Ilay at the same time Great endeavours were made by their common friends to prevent bloodshed and young Macdonald offered to give up half the disputed lands rather than have his father's age disturbed but Maclean reject∣ed the offer and proudly bad him prepare for battle  At the head of a small lake called Groinart these two little highlandbodies were drawn up and began one of those desperate conflicts which is seldom seen among regular troops Maclean's party were more numerous but Macdonald's were better soldiers having been trained in the Irish wars and long inured to discipline  The event of the battle was favourable to Macdonald By a feigned retreat that young chief disordered the enemy and wheeling suddenly round charged them with such un∣expected fury that after a brave tho ineffec∣tual defence they gave way A great slaugh∣ter ensued Three hundred were left dead upon the field near eighty of whom were of the kindred of Maclean and the dead body  of that restless and perfidious chief himself was found amidst the carnage  Before Maclean engaged in this enterprize he consulted one of the weird sisters of those uninlightened times and was answered that if he landed in Ilay on a thursday or drank of a well near Groinart he waged a war with fate Both these injunctions he transgressed A storm drove him upon the coast on a thursday and he drank of the well before he had inquired the name of the place  Thus ended this long dispute between the Madonalds and the Macleans and it ended as the disputes of those times commonly did in the death of one of the contending parties  Victory however did not secure repose to the brave Macdonald Other contests en∣sued The death of Maclean had thrown so much power into his hands that it ex∣cited anew the jealousy and ambition of the earl of Argyle That protent chief got a grant from the crown as was usual in those days of the disputed lands both in Kintire and in Ilay which Macdonald now possessed This produced a new series of wars which lasted many years between the Campbells  and the Macdonalds Old Angus Macdonald was dead but tho his son inherited his virtues the power of the house of Inverary at length prevailed and the lands in dispute were finally annexed to it's vast domains  This narrative places in a strong light the character of those barbarous timesthe spirit of aristocratic chiefsand the extensive mischief of their quarrels which were continually raging in some part of Scotland In the mean time the lower members of each little community were as frequently making depredations on their neighbours in a lower style and often indeed under the influence of their chiefs who inriched themselves at the hazard of their vassals or made them the instruments of some act of vengeance in which they did not care to appear openly themselves When the chief did not want the services of his clan they pillaged for themselves It was no uncommon thing we are told for a father to give as a dowry with his daughter what he could plunder in three Michaelmas moons  The arts of rapine generated the arts of defence Cattle were the great objects of  plunder and many ingenious modes of secur∣ing them were practised Among these arts we are told wonderful stories of the sagacity of the highlanders in tracing their cattle They could distinguish the track of their own beasts from any othereither by their number or by their different agesor by some other signs we are ignorant of and would pursue it through the territories of different clans with the certainty of hounds following their game Whenever the track was lost the owner of the land was obliged to recover it and if he could not he was sued for the damage This plea had by long custom obtained the force of law  SECT XX  HAVING thus shewn the unfavourable side of the highland character let us consider it next in a more pleasing light The whole system of manners indeed which belongs to it is now wholly changed You may travel through any part of Scotland and rarely hear of an atrocious deed Con∣tention among the chiefs is subsided and theft and rapine among the inferior orders are at an end  There are very few instances in the annals of human nature of a country so suddenly reclaimed After the battle of Culloden when the sovereignty of the highland chiefs was abolished by act of parliament this happy change immediately took place  But yet wise as this measure was it would have answered no end in reclaiming the man∣ners of the people if they had not been naturally of a virtuous cast They thieved not so much from principle as through the force of clanship When this was abolished the honest principles of nature revived And yet it is very certain that the prohibition of theft and rapine among barbarous nations makes no part of their moral code From the times of the ancient Greeks to the present Arabs the invasion of another's pro∣perty was never considered as having any criminality in it tho one would obviously be apt to suppose that justice should be among the first principles of nature At this very day the young Circassian prince is taught by his preceptor to ride to use his arms to steal and to conceal his thefts The word  thief  is a term of the utmost reproach but only as it implies detection He is afterwards led to more considerable and dangerous rob∣beries till his cunning his address and strength are supposed to be perfect  See Ellis's account of the Caucasian nations    The Scotch highlander was greatly addicted also to revenge and carried his quarrels as we have just seen to the last extremity But for this we can easily account it was chiefly through a desire to do himself justice and to repair wrongs for which the law but weakly executed would give him no redress This we see verified in the narra∣tive I have just given But one of the strongest illustrations of this remark is a story told of James Hamilton who assassinated the regent Murray  See page  After the assassination Ha∣milton fled into France where party then raged high A person there who knew him and who wished to assassinate the admiral Coligny but had not resolution to perpetrate the deed himself thought he could not apply to a properer man than Hamilton who had just committed an act of the same kind in his own country Hamilton shocked at the pro∣posal cried out "What Villain do you suppose me an assassin" and challenged him on the spot  But notwithstanding the proneness of the Scotch highlander to acts of revenge and  rapine he was in other respects in the worst of times a virtuous character He was faithful hospitable temperate and brave and if he did not easily forget an injury he was always esteemed grateful for a benefit How strict he was where confidence was reposed appears in a very strong light from that universal protection and fidelity which the pretender experienced after the battle of Culloden Tho the penalty for concealing him was so great and the reward for giving him up so tempting there was not a single man sound among such numbers whom he was obliged to trust who did not contribute all he could to conceal and succour him A fellow of the name of Kennedy to whom he was particularly obliged is often mentioned This man had virtue enough to resist the temptation of £ tho he was afterwards hanged I have heard for stealing a cow We are told also of a very celebrated robber of the name of Roy M'greggor who even formed thieving into a science and yet was one of the most benevolent men in the country and remarkable for his many acts of kindness and friendshipThere appears to be therefore in the Scotch highlander notwithstanding the  blemishes in his national character a good foundation of moral virtue A spurious kind of religion he always had but it disturbed the career of none of his passions It struck no root in his heart but appeared only in a few wild shoots of superstition He was a religious observer for instance of his oath but it was only when he had sworn by some∣thing which for some whimsical reason he deemed sacred his dagger perhaps or his father's soul but he would break an oath taken on a bible without scruple  A better direction hath now been given to minds thus in a degree prepared by superstition King George the second gave out of the forfeited estates £ a year which is still continued to erect schoolsto translate the bible into Erseand to maintain ministers and catechists The good effects of this bounty are very visible  It hath done a great deal but Mr Knox in his  Tour through the Highlands and Hebride Isles  tells us that much re∣mains yet to be done and that the difficulties which he enu∣merates of the missionary preachers are exceedingly great  Through the whole country we found not only a pleasing simplicity and civility of manners but a serious and religious  deportment among the common people which can hardly be conceived by those who are acquainted with the prophaneness and pro∣fligacy of the lower ranks near the capital A small Erse bible is the highlander's usual companion and it is common to see him reading it as he tends his cattle or rests upon the road We had frequently this pleasing sight It is common also when you enter his little cottage to see the mother spinning or knitting and the children stand∣ing round either reading in the bible or repeating their catechism  To this virtuous disposition of the high∣lander may be added what commonly accom∣panies a virtuous disposition an independent spi∣rit There are no poorrates in Scotland and indeed a relief of that kind would be but illrelished in the country While the English peasant will often forge pretences to live on the labour of others the Scotch highlander even in his real distresses will make his last effort and submit to any inconvenience before he will complain  To these remarks on the present character of the Scotch highlander I shall subjoin a pleasing picture of domestic life both as an  illustration of what I have said and as a contrast to the bloody scenes I presented a little above It is taken from a book of poems which I have just quoted by Robert Burns a bard as he calls himself from the plough but the images being caught from nature are such as must give pleasure to every feeling heart The whole indeed is equal to any praise  The Cotter's Saturday Night  November chill blaws loud with angry sugh  Sugh  is a very expressive word which we
