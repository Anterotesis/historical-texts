 GIDEON  OR The PATRIOT AN EPIC POEM  GIDEON OR The PATRIOT AN EPIC POEM IN TWELVE BOOKS Upon a HEBREW PLAN In Honour of the Two chief VIRTUES of a PEOPLE Intrepidity in FOREIGN WAR AND Spirit of DOMESTIC LIBERTY  With Miscellaneous NOTES and large REFLECTIONS Upon DIFFERENT SUBJECTS Critical Historical Political Geographic Military  and  Commercial  LONDON Printed for A MILLAR opposite  KatharineStreet  in the  Strand  MDCCXLIX  INTRODUCTION TO THE READER  _THE Author of this Poem had begun one on the Subject many Years ago but doubting whether in the Plan he was proceeding on he had enough express'd the Sense of one who had the Blessing to be born and educated in a Land of  Liberty  he had Discretion to stop short and has postpon'd its Publication for above three Times the Space prescrib'd by  Horace  for impartial Reexamination of a Poet's first ConceptionsHe now finds from the Result of this Deliberation that tho' his General Purpose then was right as but preferring the  Monarchic  to the  Popular  Forms of Government yet had he at That Time gone through his Work He was in Danger to have  err'd  in one particular Point of most essential Consequence restraining Monarchy to its  too simple Species  where It verges to and looks like Tyranny  Early Prejudices are imbib'd too deeply to be rooted out at once Experience and Reflection have since taught him to  conjoin  Ideas which before seem'd  inconsistent  and to know and own as he now does that Monarchy is there most nobly constituted where Crowns invest their Wearers with the most extensive Power to  guard  the Public Liberty without Inducement to expect Increase of Happiness or Glory from Attempts to  violate  it  There is  That  Difference and no other between the first and present Purpose of the PoemThe Fabric is the same as formerly but It has firmer Ground for its Foundation The  Hebrew System  is and must be  Monarchy  but It is  such  a Monarchy as GOD may be suppos'd without Affront to his best Attributes to have establish'd at the Head of a  Free  People whom he would not by a Waste of  useless  Miracles have brought up out of Slavery to an  Egyptian  Tyrant to have left 'em  Slaves again  in a worse Country under Tyrants of their own Fraternity  The Plan as it now stands is strictly consonant to This Idea And so little Difference could arise from the mistaken  Species  where the  Genus  was  monarchical  that almost every thing in the  Poetic  View retains its Place as in its first Production with Exception only to That nobler Taste of  Freedom  which the Writer ow'd to a disinterested silent and sincere Attachment never confess'd till now to the unconscious Object of it Here first and much too late his touch'd Heart call'd upon him to record the Obligation  It has been thought advisable to publish only Three Books at a Time and with the first the Notes belonging to it Partly by way of Specimen but chiefly because relative to the Design and general Constitution of the  Epic Species  The Notes to All the Books will last be publish'd by  Themselves and may be bound distinct from the Poetic Part or be annex'd to Each Book relatively making so  Two  Volumes at Election of the Reader who may also in this Method chuse to take or leave the  Notes  at his own PleasureThe Remaining Three Parts of the Poem will be publish'd in like manner as This First and at the shortest Distances which can consist with Care in the Revisal and Correction of so large a Work and where Variety of Subjects claim the closest Application of a Writer not insensible with what a Reverence Men should appear before the Public Eye who dare aspire to being held in View beyond the Dimness of a present Prospect  He presumes to call his present Prospect but a  dim  one without Arrogance or Satire being equally remote from dreaming too  sublimely  or too  despicably  of the Age and Nation he was doom'd to take his Fate inHe but too well knows 'em not the best dispos'd in any Kind for  giving Fame to Epic Poetry  yet must protest against so far misjudging his Cotemporaries as to suspect it possible that many should not now be living as completely qualify'd as in whatever other Time or Country to know how far a Poet has deserv'd their Notice and refuse it only where It ought not to be granted  For the Rest he casts his Hopes upon  Futurity  and having but a short Reserve of personal Claim to  Time  transfers his Expectation of Survival to this Child of Leisure His  Poetic Representative    He has nothing further here to add concerning it the  Notes  being very circumstantial and explanatory only that the Work which is of  Epic  or  Heroic  Species had for Object the chief Virtues of a People  Intrepidity  in foreign  War  and Spirit of domestic  Liberty    As for the  Notes  they are not merely of  poetical  or  critical  Intention but consist occasionally of enlarg'd Discourses upon different Subjects drawn from old and modern  History  to elucidate and give Examples to  political  Deductions which arise from  Incidents  remark'd upon They are also  Military Geographic  and  Commercial  and include Variety of other Subjects as the Reader will discover in their Progress  Among these Reflections it may possibly give Satisfaction to the Learn'd and Reverend Body of our  Clergy  in particular to see the following three Points touch'd in the new Lights here given them  st That the fine  Theocracy  of the  Mosaic  Institution was destroy'd in its Progression but by natural Consequence of one political Defect that has not been enough adverted to by Writers on that Subject  the Military Care disjoin'd from the Imperial    dly That the  Hebrew  Form of Government was never as it has by Mr  Harrington  and almost generally been suppos'd  a Popular Republic  but a plain  Hereditary Monarchy  the sovereign Power whereof was vested in the  HighPriest  's Person  And dly That with Exception only to this last  peculiar  Circumstance there arise great Probabilities toward finding in the first establish'd  Hebrew Model  the Original of All the manly  Celtic Forms  and in particular of That which constitutes the  present System in Great Britain  not relaxing from its known sound Principles  Thus much seem'd needful to premise What rests will follow with the  Notes  conjunctively Those on the first Book being publish'd previously because explanatory of the  General  Purpose  GIDEON OR The PATRIOT BOOK I  I  GLOWING pure with hallow'd Fire  Seek O Soul some heav'nly Theme  But bid no Muse thy Flights

pay with sharp Revenge their dull Disdain  And while to  Baal  and  Ashtaroth  they bow'd  Justly he bent their stubborn Necks to Pain  And left 'em Slaves to serve the  Men  whose  Gods  they serv'd in vain  Then  Gideon  wise and generous Leader rose  And taught faint  Israel  by his strange Success  That Loss of Freedom from  Corruption  flows  And  Virtue  's Sense restor'd repels Distress

perplex a struggling State  When Sons of Faction born to  miscompose    Dar'd proudly wanton bid Rebellion reign  Unvers'd in Rule while o'er their Friends they rose  To fall disgraceful at the Feet

Doubt God's wond'rous Paths to  see    What  human  Power shall I invoke for Aid  What PATRON to protect my Verse and me  And lead  lost Taste  through Discord's  eyeless  Shade  Why ask I this Shame on the low Desire  Not  Earth  's dim Fuel feeds celestial Fire  Shine clear my Soul shun  Flatt'ry  's reptile Way  Nor court th'imperious  Puddlers  of a  Day    On strong Foundation thy white Building raise  Nor  stain  thy Subject by misguided Praise  Not to  Pride  's  transient Phantoms  poorly kneel  But bid thy Work that hopes immortal Fame  Outsoaring  Arrogance  to  Worth  appeal

Israel  to her Western Coasts  To These old  Amalek  her Standards join'd  The  marching Hebrews  first and surest Foe  Thick as the  Locusts  in some  living Wind    A Tide of Death o'er all the Land they flow  Force and Famine with them go  Pangless they stain their Front with  Blood  and blot their Rear with  Woe    By God forsaken God's proud People  fly    Valiant no longer than obedient found  Hopeless to live and yet afraid to die  In  Caves  and dark Retreats they dwell on high  Thence prone look trembling with pale Horror round  While from th' expos'd inferior Ground  Their heavy Harvests load the plund'ring Foe  And for Support of Those they curse their Grapes and Olives grow  Dejected now their  Joshua  they forget  Nor longer warlike others Lands invade  Anxious now their own they quit  Poorly from reachless  Rocks  to borrow Aid  And hid in Safety's eyeless Dusk their boasted Glory shade  VIII  Westward from rev'rend  Jordan  's silv'ry Stream  Where Half the  Manasaean  Tribe their measur'd Portion found  Ophra  salutes the Morning's op'ning Beam  From the East Brow of an extended Round  Of highrais'd rugged and imperial Ground  Within th'extensive Circle copious  Plain    And safestretch'd  Pastures  highinclos'd remain  Impregnably secure beneath th'exterior  Mound    Far to the North below was  Jezreel  's Valley spread  Jezreel  by mighty Victories renown'd  'Twas on this Mountain's broad and fertile Head  JOASH the destin'd Hero's Father dwelt  Joash  whom homerais'd Harvests nobly fed  Who old in Ease no Blast of Care had felt  Crown'd with unenvy'd Plenty and Respect  He held a Power by no proud Faction check'd  And sole and nat'ral Monarch of the Place  Reign'd in paternal Majesty o'er all his happy Race  Hard by his House a rev'rend Oak there grew  Which there had flourish'd many a Cent'ry past  Long before  Israel  GOD or MOSES knew  Or from  Egypt  's Chain withdrew  This Tree a Shade o'er half the Mountain cast  Stretch'd on a Bench beneath th'expansive Gloom  Gideon  whose struggling Anguish long'd for Vent  Lay at the earliest Dawn of doubtful Light  A far Discerner unexpos'd to Sight  On mighty Ends in Contemplation bent  IX  The Morning rising over  Israel  's Spoils  Glow'd with a burning Blush to see her Shame  The wakeful Bees began their searchful Toils  And humm'd from Flow'r to Flow'r with tasteful Aim  High to the bright'ning Skies the soaring Lark  Rose warbling Welcome to the op'ning Day  Below with humbler Melody  Hopping from Bush to Bush from Tree to Tree  A Thousand Birds in mirthful Concert play  Slow from the Plain the melting Dew  To kiss the Sunbeams climbing rose  And bore sweet Odours upward as it flew  To guide their balmy Influence from the  Foes    Still some fresh Zephyr fann'd the fragrant Vale  And still a Thousand mingled Sweets rose with the spicy Gale  Along the Mountain's steep but blooming Side  The creeping Vine and scentful Myrtle spread  O'er the Rock's Margin high with frightful Pride  The overhanging  Palm  the Winds defy'd  And rais'd in dang'rous State its branchy Head  At the Hill's Foot with hoarse and murm'ring Sound  A winding Riv'let roll'd its pebbly Way  And ling'ring thro' th'enamell'd Vale delighting there to stray  Late it's loud Passage into  Jordan  found  Far on either Side the Brook  A rip'ning Harvest bent her golden Head  Bow'd to invite th'expected Reapinghook  And waving wanton o'er its airy Bed  Sadly at Distance pleas'd their Sight whose Taste it should have fed  X  All this fair Prospect with commanding Eye  The thoughtafflicted  Gideon  saw from high  Happy enough had this been  all  his View  But oh he saw the  Camp  of  Midian  too  Proudly spread in warlike Awe  Death's whole collected Pomp at once he saw  A mingled Horror glitter'd from below  Tents green white sanguine azure distant seen  Varied the Landschape with a threat'ning  Show  Whence gleamy Swords and Lances glow'd between  And fill'd with terrible Delight the sightalarming Scene  Here and there highmettled Steeds  Bound loose in wanton Exercise and neigh along the Meads  In other Parts the  scytharm'd Chariots  driven  Wheel round each other with elusive Skill  Formful of future Schemes to  kill  Swift ev'ry Way they wind at Signals given  And open wide and close again at Will  Their brazen Wheels with Din the Valley fill  And shoot their clatt'ring Echoes up the Hill  Then all at once with yet more thund'ring Noise  The tortur'd Drums and sprightly Trumpets join'd  Proudly proclaim the waking Conqu'ror's Joys  And swell their savage Triumph up the Wind  XI  Light from his Bench enrag'd young  Gideon  leapt  By Doubt and Shame and Grief and Anger press'd  GOD who till now he cry'd his Promise  kept    Leaves us abandon'd most when most distress'd  Why  thou immortal Leader of our Race  Why were thy Blessings heap'd upon this Land  The  Milk  and  Honey  of thy promis'd Grace  Flow'd ev'rywhere throughout each charmful Space  But oh they flow'd to our Destroyer's Hand  And  must  it  be  and can  no Help  be found  Said I no HelpDishonest Sound  There can there must there  shall  This galling Yoke  Which haughty  Midian  will not ease  Maywhen GOD and  Israel  please  From off our Necks at one determin'd Stroke  Be shook in Fury or by Strength be broke  But  who  alas what Hand shall guide the Blow  Heartless our Tribes indulge their patient Woe  Half with Treach'ry  aid  the  Foe  And false to Heaven and Us th' nvader  own  The other Half who hold their Country dear  Doubting GOD's Help because 'tis slowly shown  Wish well for Conscience and submit for Fear  Now were some  single Power  a general Bliss  What wanted  Israel  when possess'd of This  The Kings about us with uncurb'd Command  Timely directing save their Land  We too once prosper'd in a  Monarch  's Hand  Now misaspiring to be loosely great  Disjunctive Freedom but enslaves our State  In Governments where All would  rule  and None by Choice obey  Not soon indeed the selfdisturbing Storm  Yields to subside beneath a  Tyrant Sway  But Power so parcell'd melts in Broils away  And noisy Contest weak'ning  Awe  must gen'ral Strength betray  Is there a Man throughout all  Israel  's Names  Who dares not Hand to Hand assault a Foe  Singly  All are free and brave  Together  but one Coward and one Slave  Since allexcentric each the rest disclaims  Why look we wide th'apparent Cause to know  We to  defective Rule  our Mis'ries owe  Led by a  Lion  Sheep like Lions dare  And Lions led by  Sheep  like Sheep despair  He spoke and with a swift and manly Stride  Approach'd the Mountain's steepy Side  Sternly on  Midian  downward bent his Eyes  Glow'd as he gazing felt new Passions rise  And roll'd 'em sparkling to th' upbraided Skies  High beat his warm and wishdisorder'd Heart  And his hot Bosom tingled with the Smart  XII  While thus in busy Silence fix'd he gaz'd  Th'unfolding Heav'ns with streamy Brightness blaz'd  Panting his tongueless Terror  would  have spoke  But as he view'd th'effulgent Chasm amaz'd  Close at his Ear a bursting Thunder broke  And a Voice reach'd him from th'abandon'd Oak  He turn'd and in his lateleft Station saw  Calmly reclin'd a Youth divinely fair  Sitting like some familiar Friend some Partner of his Care  Pensive he lean'd his Head on his Lefthand  His smiling Eye shed Sweetness mix'd with Awe  His Righthand with a milkwhite Wand some Figure seem'd to draw  A nameless Grace was scatter'd thro' his Air  And o'er his Shoulders loosely flow'd his ambercolour'd Hair  As  Gideon  wond'ring tow'rd the Stranger drew  Th' immortal Visitor approach'd  Him  too  Hail happy Youth he cry'dGOD's  Chosen  hail  Thou Light of  Israel  her commission'd  Guide  Soon shall  thy Sword  o'er yon gay Power prevail  Hope boldlyGOD will war on  Gideon  's  Side    XIII  Whoe'er thou art the Hero sad reply'd  Who know'st so well th'unhappy  Gideon  's Name  Would thou couldst tell since GOD is on my Side  How comes it he permits my Country's Shame  Where is the  saving Rod  of  Moses  now  Where the lost Force of  Joshua  's warlike Hand  Where the  flash'd Flame  from nighthid  Sinai  's Brow  Oh for that foepreventing  Cloud  by Day  Or by Night that  fiery Ray    Which led our Fathers to this happy Land  What need of all this  Waste  of  Wonders  done  If here scarce seated we must fall at last  Why out of  Pharaoh  's Grasp was  Israel  won  Why the  Red Sea  miraculously past  Sure since our Lot's for  Ruin  cast  More nobly wretched 'twould appear  To be in  Egypt Slaves  than  here  Why now forsaking was he pleas'd to  chuse  Why call us  His  at  first  Never to have been blest were lightlier curst  Hopes from false Prospect cruelly amuse  Better ne'er know a Bliss than known to  lose  As for myself fain would I credit All  Long have I dar'd revolve proud  Midian  's Fall  But void of Means to suit th'ambitious Aim  The Curb of Fortune keeps my Courage tame  Of all our Tribe the poorest Race is mine  And of that poorest Race the meanest I  Be it suppos'd I should incline  War's dreadful Weight to try  Where is my  Pow'r  my  Interest  my  Fame  Will  Israel  's haughty Tribes be led by one without a  Name  XIV  The Angel interrupting here thus awfully reply'd  Israel  bold  Hebrew  has her GOD  defy'd    Since from affronted Heav'n th'ungrateful Race  Hope lost Assistance and would still prevail  Why have they broke GOD's Laws renounc'd his Grace  And poorly bow'd to  Ashtaroth  and  Baal  Were  These  the Gods who from th'  Egyptian  Land  Freed your lost Fathers with unhop'd Success  'Twixt  wavebuilt Walls  conducted 'em to  Idumaea  's Strand  Safe steer'd you thro' the pathless  Wilderness    Gave awful Pow'r to the  Mosaic Wand    All proud Attempts from hostile  Earth  to check  And govern  Heav'n  by its commission'd Beck  With  liquid Rock  to stream a springless Land  Call  manna'd Harvests  from th' unfruitful Sand  And save and bless you with a mighty Hand  Since stubborn for an empty  Idol  's sake  Your Articles with Heav'n you dar'd to break  What vain Presumption bids you judge it fit  Who slight the  Bond  should reap the  Benefit  Butthou would'st say Repentance dawns at last  That sadly conscious of their Error past  Groaning in Anguish of their Souls their Eyes to Heav'n they cast  How small th'Atonement and how great the Sin  Yet it suffices that they  late  begin  To  quit  th'ungrateful Paths they've wander'd in  Unutterably gracious GOD disdains  To feel a Pleasure in his Creatures Pains  Men who slight Heav'n but their  own Bliss  forsake  I the  Great Pard'ner  's Minister am sent  To arm Thee  Gideon  for thy brave Intent  Boldly resolve and safely undertake  Hail  Heav'n's illustrious Instrument  Thine  be the Ends on which thy Thoughts were bent  XV  Gideon  sigh'd sad and graceful bow'd his Head  Heedful to question ere he yet believ'd  So strange a Message tho' from Heaven receiv'd  The deepdiscerning  Nuncio  plainly read  Each Scruple in his arguing Fancy bred  Let me said he from yon forsaken Seat  Share that small Store thy Grief neglects to  eat    Gideon  with joyful Diligence obey'd  And humbly at his Feet the Napkin spread  And in neat Order hospitably laid  His little Treat of  Wine  and  Flesh  and  Bread  Yet doubtful and amaz'd at what he did  My Lord said he who Heav'n's high Will reveals  Stoops not I fear to taste of  mortal Meals  The Food of  Angels  is not  Flesh  of  Kid    XVI  Be taught reply'd th'  unbody'd  Guest from this Consent to know  Men to  Heav'n's Myst'ries  Faith implicit owe  Let the Command suffice nor Reason's Eye  With dang'rous Keenness seek the darken'd  Why    Where GOD has said  I'll have it so    All curious Inquisition must be spar'd  And nothing sought beyond what stands  declar'd    Be not in human Ignorance too scrupulously wise  But mindful that  obedient Faith  is Man's  best Sacrifice    He said and gently stretching out his Hand  Touch'd the spread Napkin with his snowy Wand  As from hot Furnaces the vap'ry Stream  Mounts thick and widens its evolving Steam  So when the Angel his Reproof had spoke  At the watch'd Summons of the Wand's soft Stroke  A springy  Flame  from the dry Surface broke  And cover'd and consum'd th'untasted Store  Lovely the Fire rose whirling mix'd with Smoke  Folding in glorious Volumes o'er and o'er  And upward on a curling Cloud the mounted Angel bore  Gideon  look'd after him and would have spoke  While ravish'd with the fierce Delight he saw him gently  soar  Till forc'd to give the th'outlength'ning Prospect o'er  His Eyes in wat'ry Brightness  wept  for Bliss they found no more  XVII  Musing a while and dumb with deep Suspense  Thus loud at last his Wonder broke its Way  Immortal GOD whose Glory's high Defence  Thy own Almighty Hand can best display  Thy  Hand beneath whose angry  Touch  whole Worlds would melt away  Can it be  possible  to one like  me  Without  Desert  of no  Degree    It should be left to draw the Sword for THEE  But dark and wond'rous ever were thy Ways  All different Means grow  equal  in  thy  Hand  And  all  Things  possible  where Man obeys  His  Maker  's high Command  Why  weigh  I thus Decrees I must  fulfil  'Twas holy Flame I find that did inspire  My Soul's ungovernable Fire  And That was  working Providence  which seem'd but  wild Desire    Hence then with Apprehensions and Delays  Hence with all doubted Want of human Skill  GOD if he meant me for his Praise  Will mould me to his Will  XVIII  While he yet spoke from  Ophra  's neighb'ring Walls  A winding Horn in short and sudden Calls  Invades his Ear with high and hoarse Alarms  And from the Town a mingled Tumult swarms  Of every Rank all Ages weak and strong  Flowing in Tides of Uproar thick along  Confus'dly arm'd and more confus'dly led  They seem'd with eager Threat'nings to pursue  A Party which along the Mountain's Side  In more Disorder fled  Gideon  in Haste to his near House withdrew  There with a Spear his warlike Hand supply'd  And join'd th'egressive Croud and follow'd too  XIX  This was a Party that from  Midian  's Camp  Had in the cov'ring Dusk of Night been sent  To climb the Mountain silent and unspy'd  And close conceal'd till Dawn with dire Intent  'Twixt the Cragg's bushy Clefts their Cohort hide  Till at the op'ning Portal rushing in  Surprize might force what  Siege  would  slowly  win  But  Joash  early rising every Day  Took Pleasure to behold the Morning break  To watch the first faint Shoots of Twilight play  And Night's dissolving Shades melt soft away  He while his fragrant Walk he meant to take  Round the known Borders of his welltill'd Farm  Undreaming Danger as unmeaning Harm  Down the Hill's Brow discern'd the Points of Spears  Suspiciously in sloping Covert bent  And saw the sheltry Bushes  shake  along the green Descent  His taught Experience catch'd prophetic Fears  Swift to the Town convey'd this strong Alarm  And rous'd th'unwary Multitude to  arm    XX  Prevented the discover'd Ambush rose  And fast retreated down the craggy Hill  Gideon  whose Breast predestin'd Honours fill  Doubly inspir'd in Presence of his Foes  Wing'd his swift Feet with Heav'n's remember'd Will  And now nighreaching gain'd upon 'em still  Oreb  a  Midian  Prince of warlike Fame  Who led this Party on their close Design  Saw their Retreat with mingled Rage and Shame  And labour'd earnestly and long to stop their headlong Flight  But neither Prayers nor Blows could now incline  His scatt'ring Files to bear the  Hebrew  's Sight  Mov'd  therefore by a brave and princely Mind  He let the rushing Numbers pass him by  Then following march'd securely slow behind  Oft  facing  with a fierce and flameful Eye  Himself an Army while his People fly  He  when he found his Rear too closely prest  Turn'd sudden in a steep and winding Way  Where scarce two meeting Friends could pass abreast  Such threddy Concave here deepnarrowing lay  And jutting  Rocks  and frightful  Steeps  hung horrid o'er the rest  Since like a tim'rous Herd said he yon Cowards haste away  Nor blush in  Arms  their Sov'reign to betray  Let 'em enjoy their Safety as they  may    'Tis now  their  Shame who dare their Charge reject  'Twere  mine  should I the Negligent neglect  'Tis a King's glorious Business to  protect    XXI  He said and o'er an Angle of the Path  Observ'd a  tott'ring Cliff  which loosely hung  Broke by longdrenching Rains and wint'ry Wrath  Acutely pendent 'twixt two Rock's rais'd Ends  Pond'rous it seems to  arch  the Road and a  roof'd Shadow  lends  High to one pointed Prop the Prince ascends  Long to the vast unweildy Weight with struggling Labour clung  And  down  at last  across  the  Path  the loady Barrier flung  Gideon  who just approach'd it as it fell  Strides back amaz'd and scarce believes his Sight  Whoe'er thou art he cry'd thou tim'st it well  And sure to do thy envy'd Courage Right  He who so bravely  flies  would nobly  fight    XXII  Scarce had he spoke when with a threat'ning Spear  Down on the bulwark Rock Prince  Oreb  leapt  Hebrew  he cry'd thou art not safe so near  Retire This Pass will be too strongly kept  Speaking aloft he shook his deatharm'd Lance  And to the shouting Thousands turn'd his Shield  The slowdescending Foes now scarce advance  But from th'o'ercrowded Steep in spiral Line  Aw'd and astonish'd at the fierce Design  Stand  gazing  at the Wonder they beheld  Dreadfully bright his gilded Armour shone  O'er his left Thigh a crooked Sword declin'd  A feath'ry Plume high from his Helmet rose  And loosely gay wav'd warlike in the Wind  Crimson with Sable mix'd halfshaded flows  Severely charming to his distant Foes  Of all the Press  Gideon  alone comes on  The rest in safe Defiance threat behind  Ignobly hurl their Jav'lins down in vain  Which clatt'ring on his Shield rebound and tremble back again  XXIII  Gideon  awhile revolv'd th'unequal War  And blush'd to see it basely wag'd from far  Then rais'd his Arm in Sign that He alone  Would make the gen'ral Hazard all his own  Hush'd was the Storm and  Oreb  smiling saw  One  threat'ning  Hebrew  near him draw  Yet cautious to prevent too bold Advance  Aimful he poiz'd and hurl'd his beamy Lance  Timely th'Approacher bow'd his watchful Head  And harmless let the pointed Tempest fly  But his reach'd  Station  felt th'Invader  nigh  Deep in the cliffy  Path  it Entrance found  And echoing its Design with thundring Sound  Jarr'd upward as it stood erect and  quiver'd  in the Ground  Gideon  sprung near and from beneath the Rock  Rising at Hand directs a speary Blow  The ringing Target yielded to the Shock  And the broadent'ring Steel broke thund'ring through  Half his bright  Sword  the dreadful  Oreb  drew  When  Fortune  blind Invertress of Event  Thus check'd th' impatient Speed his Ardour lent  Gideon  strongly from below  Dragg'd hard to disengage th' intangled Spear  Which while Prince  Oreb  's Shield retentive bound  Lightly th'Assaulter leaping from the Ground  Help'd by the Staff's Resistance firmly grasp'd  Reach'd the gain'd Rock surpriz'd the Foe and his arm'd Body clasp'd  To Heav'n a thund'ring Shout the  Hebrews  rais'd  Struck and astonish'd and transported gaz'd  Far flies th'incumber'd Shield wide hurl'd away  Lab'ring  each strives the other's Weight to  lift  Now  curvy Grapplings  every  Bend  assay  Now with a springy  Force  in Starts of Rage  From sinewy Curb their Joints they  disengage  Soon  clos'd again  with stormy Grasp they  meet    Arms fett'ring Arms and Feet perplexing Feet  Elusive long with new and wily Drifts  From Side to Side th' evasive Whirlwind shifts  They heave they drag they twist bend lift and strain  And tire each practis'd Nerve yet toil in vain  Fiercely at length  provok'd  at Art's Delay  Born for  plain  Conquest and the Glare of  Day  Strength's utmost Effort in  one  Proof to make  With Feet firm fix'd and stretch'dout Arms the Rock's loose Clefts they  shake    Sudden they feel their Prop's false Fabric  break  Timeworn the flaky Pediment's press'd  Slate    Splitting beneath the human Tempest's Weight  Roll'd one huge Fragment  down  while one vast Flake  Backward  reclining now scarce choak'd the Streight  Distant compell'd th'unclosing Warriors fall  And the freed Path unbars her Track to All  XXIV  Gideon  awhile long stunn'd  above Oreb  who  downward  fell  Roll'd Sev'n steep Paces ere his Feet he gain'd  But swift recov'ring with indignant Swell  Look'd back and saw surpriz'd that this dire Chance  Bursting the Pass he had so long maintain'd  Had left it open to his Foes Advance  Then hopeful hard Pursuit would now prove vain  Should the Persisters press his flying Train  Swift as a Tyger bounds he leaps away  Light and regardless where best Passage lay  Till near behind him came th'o'ertaking  Shout    Then paus'd he calm look'd heedfully about  Mark'd in the Mountain's Side a dusky  Cave    And enters there with slow Suspense his future Hope to save  XXV  As rapid Currents choak'd by floatmix'd  Mud    Check'd for a Moment smooth their troubled Flood  Then sluicing on to clear th' obstructed Way  With tenfold Force renew their sweepy Sway  So when the  Hebrews  saw the Passage free  In headlong  Cat'ract  down the Steep they  gush'd    And in rude Flow fast by the Cavern rush'd  Nor dreamt that  Oreb  could so near 'em be  To the Hill's outmost Verge at last they came  Where a broad Terras form'd by Nature spread  And round the Mountain rear'd a pensile  Plain    Hither by vain Pursuit the  Hebrews  led  Beheld th'escaping Foe the Valley gain  And safely there in rallying Line make Head  Thence at more Distance cross the forded Stream  Squadrons from  Midian  's Camp detach'd they view'd  Whose sunstruck Weapons flash'd a threat'ning Gleam  Then  Gideon  found it prudent to retreat  And timely wise reclimb'd the steep Ascent  But marching slowly with attentive Feet  Examin'd ev'ry Cavern as he went  From that in which Prince  Oreb  lay sudden an ent'ring File  With Eyes cast backward trembling outward flew  Close at their Heels came dreadful  Oreb  too  By Nature always eager to  pursue  But soon as  Gideon  he beheld and knew  He sheath'd his Sword and with a graceful Smile  Now  first  said he this Sword  in vain  I drew  But forc'd to yield 'tis best I yield to  you    The gen'rous  Hebrew  bowing mild reply'd  Fortune not always favours the most brave  Had  partial Vict'ry still sustain'd  your  Side  She would have robb'd me of wish'd Pow'r to  save    And you had wrong'd a  Hebrew Heart  untry'd  XXVI  While they were speaking and the should'ring Croud  Morosely insolent and rudely loud  Was climbing round all gaping for a View  As if the Conquest claim'd the  Insult  too  A second Chance diverts th'impatient Throng  For some who newly search'd the Cavern round  Noiseful return'd and with 'em dragg'd along  Ten weeping  Slaves  whom there conceal'd they found  Poor Fugitives of antient  Canaan  's Race  Once happy Owners of that promis'd Land  Where forc'd to give th'invading  Hebrews  Place  They now liv'd subject to  their  harsh Command  Severely us'd and tir'd with Length of Woe  The newfound Ten had from their Masters run  Drawn by the Nearness of the  gen'ral  Foe  To meditate Escape and Slav'ry shun  They might perhaps with  Midian  join'd be free  Worse than they were they knew they  could not be  And there's a kind of mournful  Ease  in  Change  of  Misery    XXVII  When to the Town the noisy Press  Return'd with  Shouts  their Triumph to express  Shouts the  Voice  of proud Success  Th'  assembled Elders  o'er the City  Gate    Sat wisely busy'd in serene Debate  On Questions which concern'd the Good of  Ophra  's little State  Sev'n was their Number and they chose to sit  In a bow'd  Crescent  's Form whose  Points  were fill'd  By Two of  Levi  's sacred Sonsbest skill'd  To judge of Laws in rev'rend Myst'ry writ  Sage in the  Centre  hoary  Joash  sat  Renown'd for Virtue and rever'd for Age  Th' assisting  Four  were Men of Years and Skill  Fam'd Themselves for shunning  Ill  And therefore thought best qualify'd to govern Other's Will  To These the Croud their Ten Deserters bring  And tell where found and on what Errand bent  To These they also shew the  captive King  But loud in ev'ry list'ning Ear they  Gideon  's Praises ring  Paint  how  he dar'd  act o'er  th'admir'd Event  And mock Prince  Oreb  's brave Resolve to stop their fierce Descent  XXVIII  Slow rose  Eliakim  the Town's High Priest  The ruling  Levite  and the Senate's Tongue  A Man who dar'd in Zeal to Heav'n bewail  Religion  lost  and  Hebrew  Fame  decreas'd  He well remember'd while he yet was young  How GOD enabled  Israel  to prevail  And sigh'd to see th'ungrateful People fail  Nor ever bow'd the Knee Himself to  Ashtaroth  or  Baal    Bless'd be our  Father  's GOD said he this Day  To whom All owing we would nothing pay  Gideon  methinks I feel thy Father's Joy  O may thy blooming Glory never fade  No Envy sure will budding Virtue shade  Soon does thy Country's Love thy Sword employ  The  Prince  Thy Captive by the Right of War  Dispose of at thy safe Discretion's Choice  And since all  Ophra  's Sons thy Debtors are  Accept our Thanks as from the  gen'ral Voice    Dare on fight prosper Heav'n shall bless thy Aim  This but the Dawning of thy destin'd Fame  For  You  and then he turn'd to  Canaan  's trembling Sons  Known Custom points us to your mournful Lot  Since ev'ry Slave who from his Master runs  Dies  guilty of an  added  Crime or not  He spoke and bending toward the bord'ring Seats  Ask'd if their Judgment full Concurrence lent  And then distinctly his  Decree repeats    And all the  Elders  rose at once to testify Consent  XXIX  Gideon  whose fearless Heart was form'd to  feel    Sharer  in ev'ry Woe he could not heal  Sigh'd pitying the poor Slave's  prevented  Flight  And bowing graceful spoke in Sorrow's Right  Who rev'rend Fathers after This will pause in Honour's Chace  The Prize so glorious and so short the Race  Too much you pay me for too little won  If but to act our  Duty  claims such Praise  For what alas has  Gideon  further done  We live I fear in unperforming Days  But your too kind Applause perhaps would raise  A  future  Worth by previous Praise  If wisely gen'rous you incline  To make that grateful Lesson  mine    Consenting  Will  holds modest Purpose dumb  And humbly takes your  present Thanks  for  Actions  yet to  come    One Cause mean while  not mine  I fain would plead  I cannot wish to see the  Wretched bleed  Who knows what Hardships in their friendless State  Had gall'd their patient Hearts ere yet they  fled  But  grant Them  guilty Law  mistakes  their Fate  Death in the  Happy  may create some  Dread  But the cold Grave is Mis'ry's restful  Bed    There are Oppressions of such monstrous Weight  That 'twere the happiest Freedom to be  dead    Such if their Wrongs we  lose  our stern Intent  And give 'em Ease from Painfor  Punishment  Judge not I pray you that I mispresume  Or pride myself to think you Favours  owe    If loving Mercy I deplore their Doom  Bring home an alien Danger THEN  appeal  Make the Case  yours  and  sentence  as you  feel    Israel Herself  was once a  Slave  Grant Heav'n if ever she again be so  She finds a  Moses  or a GODto save  If then our Fathers found it  hard  the Yoke to undergo  And having once been unoppress'd and free  Thought it their  Glory  and their  Right  to fly from Slavery  Instruct me rev'rend Rulers  why  These Men  Now in the Case that was  all Israel  's  then    Should merit  Death  for counting in their Claim  That noble  Thirst of Liberty  that first gave  Israel  FAME  XXX  He paus'dApproving  Joash  smil'd with Pride  And heard with kindred Joy his Offspring  blest    Eliakim  with weak but willing Stride  And Hands uplifted Sign of Zeal express'd  Came forward and to blushing  Gideon  cry'd  Close let me press Thee to my hopewarm'd Breast  No narrow Bounds of Custom Int'rest Will  Shall e'er confine the Reach of  Gideon  's Soul  A Mind so spacious and so stretch'd a Skill  Were sure design'd by Heav'n for  wide Controul  O  take  the  pardon'd Slaves  thy Mercy's Prize  Thou plead'st too  justly  to be heard  in vain    Henceforth their Fate in thy own Bosom lies  Bless'd in thy Service the sav'd Ten retain  What  happier can they wish  How  happier  be  Thou gav'st 'em Life and they shall live  for Thee    XXXI  Th'Assembly rose and the Remains of Day  Were in triumphant Pastime  nois'd  away  At length still Night her solemn Influence shed  And dewdrench'd Sable wrapt the Mountain's Head  Sleep's heavy Drag the Rage of Joy depress'd  And weary Tumult hush'd herself to Rest  But  Gideon  's active Mind was fram'd to  wake  His newgain'd Honour and the Angel's  Hail    Suffer'd  Him  no Rest to take  But led him pensive o'er the Grounds thro' Night's  opakest  Veil  So wand'ring wide he reach'd the Grove of  Baal    Westward upon the Mountain's Edge it stood  Where shap'd by Art a huge round  Hill  in  terrass'd Stages  rose  Whose farseen  Pyramid  Five  Plains compose  And ev'ry Stage was a small sep'rate Wood  The lowermost planted thick with baleful  Eugh    Could with brown Horror quench the Glare of Noon  But now from Night a deeper Dusk it drew  The fun'ral  Cypress  the next Stage o'erspread  The Third which narrowing upward wanted Room  For Trees of copious and untonsile Head  From deepting'd  Laurel  caught umbrageous Gloom  Round the Fourth Platform climbing  Ivy  crept  And into bushy Shade higharching grew  There in darktufted Roofs black Ravens slept  And  inbred Owls  which never Daylight knew  Flat like a  tabled Plain  the last high Stage  Nourish'd  one  tow'ring  Oak  which strongly stood  The timeswoln Growth of many a perish'd Age  And bore on one proud Trunk a spacious  Wood    Down o'er the shadow'd Groves above th'enormous Branches hung  And form'd a sheltry Arbour round the  Bole  Mov'd by the Wind with murm'ring Sweep they swung  And blew cool Horror over  Gideon  's  Soul    From Stage to Stage broad Steps of halfhid Stone  With curling  Moss  and blady Grass o'ergrown  Led to the Top where reign'd this Monarch Oak  'Twixt the black Boughs hung melancholy down  One glimm'ring Lamp dull'd by its own thick Smoke  Which feebly thro' a Lantern's Sides the bord'ring Darkness broke  XXXII  By the pale Radiance faintly scatter'd round  Full in the Centre of this awful Shade  Gideon  the Idol of the Grove survey'd  O'er a round Altar by green Foliage bound  A wooden Sculpture bore the  Sun  's broad Face  Hideously  kind  in Act of purpos'd Grace  Stretching thin Arms across th'o'ershadow'd Space  It gleam'd an added Horror round the Place  Speechless a while 'twixt mingled Grief and Shame  This Pageantry of Godhead he beheld  At length revoic'd by his remember'd  Aim    How long said he shall  Idol Faith  prevail  How long th'  Eternal  's Priests bow down to  Baal  And Stones and Blocks usurp th'Almighty's Name  Allpard'ning Heav'n I feel thy Wrongs  inspire  Burn  we this  Daemon  in his own dim Fire  Where can we better  Virtue  's Race begin  Than at th'eradicated  Shoot  of  Sin  XXXIII  So saying o'er the dusky Paths he back explor'd his Way  And silent to an outbuilt Hovel came  Where in safe Sleep his newgain'd Servants lay  They wake and hear him and mistake his Aim  Strain their stretch'd Eyes and trembling ask his  Name    Be hush'd he answer'd and dismiss your Fear  Only your  Patron  's Voice you hear  Rise and assist him in a just Design  Or no way dang'rous or the Danger  mine    For  You  This done I set you free  Fear not to trust your lategiven Lives with  Me    Be grateful 'twill adorn your Liberty  Uprush the summon'd Ten with glad Consent  Nor weigh nor question his Intent  Enough for  Them  that 'tis by  Gideon  meant  From a rough Store of rustic Instruments  Which next that Hovel opportunely lay  To ev'ry Hand a shining Axe he gave  Bad 'em be resolute and brave  And cautious march'd in silent Speed away  In a fair Pasture bord'ring on their Road  A milkwhite  Ox  in fragrant Plenty graz'd  Unbroken yet and alien to the  Goad    Chief of a chosen Breed by  Joash  rais'd  Him first they seize and having bound him strong  Drag him hardstruggling and displeas'd along  XXXIV  Instructively inform'd as  on  they went  Hast'ning and prompt they reach th'unhallow'd Grove  There to a Tree th'unwilling Victim tie  Then on the pious Mischief warmly bent  Each with contending Emulation strove  Laborious in Obedience to  outvye    First  Baal  's polluted Altar down they threw  And scatter'd wide the Fragments ev'ry Way  Next from disjointed Steps with Toil they drew  The massy Stones which in loose Pile they lay  A  purer  Altar of new Frame to raise  Sacred to a diviner Pow'r and more exalted Praise  Now to the Idol Form approaching nigh  Gideon  his Sword in zealous Transport drew  Witness he cry'd  sole  GOD who hear'st from  high    Witness the  Vengeance  from thy Servants due  Thou Baal  assert thy  Pow'r  and 'scape thy  Shame  Strike if thou can'st I thus thy  Cause  disclaim  Speaking he cleav'd the Image at a Blow  On either Side the parted Godhead fell  Winds o'er the Grove shrillshrieking Echoes blow  And all the  Daemons  of the Place groan'd helpless from below  Encourag'd by their Lord the shaking Train  To smaller Pieces hew the  chippy God  Atoning Fire the dreary Spoils maintain  And the dim Lamp no longer gleam'd in vain  Then at th'attentive Leader's waited Nod  Up the Grove's Edge the back'ning  Ox  they strain  XXXV  The mounting Fire now blaz'd in tow'ry Pride  When a fair Bowl by  Gideon  's Hand in previous Care supply'd  Apt for Libation Aid of Sacrifice  HighfillingHe upon the hissing Flame  Pour'd the warm Blood and prostrate bow'd to pray  Not these imperfect Rites said he Lord of the  Heart  despise  Call  'em  Ablution  and let  Israel  's Shame  Be from this Time for ever  wash'd away  He said when strait confirming  Thunder  roar'd  And cross whole Heav'n with loud Enlargement roll'd  Sudden the dazzling Gates of Light unfold  And while the kneeling Hero Grace implor'd  Show'rs of  thin Lustre  quiver'd thro' the Trees  The living Lights from ev'ry Quarter play  And the Grove radiates into flashing  Day    A while the Blaze hung o'er but by Degrees  Rose gently and in Distance flow'd away  Flat the Slaves astonish'd fell  And drown'd in the refulgent Torrent lay  With awemix'd Pleasure felt their Bosoms swell  And as th' ascending Glow unseal'd their Eyes  Trembling gaz'd after it to see it rise  And wid'ning upward more and more in soft'ning Shades decay  XXXVI  Recov'ring each on other wild they glare  Then humbly to their honour'd Patron kneel  Words tho' they want their Meaning to declare  They more want Coldness to forbear  For Joys by Transport will themselves reveal  Phurah  best taught of these devoted Men  At length found Voice for the collective  Ten    Bless'd be the GOD of this brave  Hebrew  Race  Fall our  false Gods  before his dreadful Face  Never could  Baal  thus vindicate his Name  Thus speak in Thunder and appear in Flame  O glorious Mortal thus by Heav'n approv'd  Leave us not  wretched  to be blindly  free    Since by the Great Almighty thus belov'd  'Twere to be  lost  to be disjoin'd from  Thee  And to serve  Gideon  and his GOD is noblest Liberty  He said and all his Fellows join'd his Pray'r  And begg'd with pious Tears permitted Stay  The gen'rous  Hebrew  found 'em worth his Care  If you  will  still be mine said he you  may    Nor shall you suffer by the Lot you chuse  Whom GOD invites  Man  ought not to refuse  But let us now my newmade Friends proceed  And finish well the Work we well began  So speaking round th'enormous Oak he ran  And by the Fire's pale Cast yet glimm'ring wide  Saw from that Quarter which oppos'd the  West    That there the Boughs o'erhung the Mountain's Side  Against whose Edge the grovy Summit prest  XXXVII  Once more his broad welltemper'd Blade he drew  And gash'd with all his Strength the knotty Tree  Then steely Axes following Two by Two  Relieving apt a long alternate Toil  Lab'ring with fruitless Pain they wond'ring see  From the tough Trunk's big Bulk backbounding Blows recoil  But still persisting with unweary'd Will  Wide toward the Root a yawning Wound they make  Whence scatt'ring Chips the bord'ring Bushes fill  Then late the nodding Oak begins to groan  The leafy Limbs in gen'ral Horror shake  Bending the ForestGiant breaks and is at once o'erthrown  Down rolls the tumbling Monster o'er the Rocks  And sweeps the Grove before it with its Sway  From Cliff to Cliff rebounds with frightful Shocks  And gores the groaning Mountain in its Way  Broad o'er the Plain below it  loads  the shadow'd Ground  And grazing Herds with stiffen'd Ear start trembling from the Sound  NOTES AND Miscellaneous REFLECTIONS ON The FIRST BOOK  BEFORE the Reader enters on the Notes in referential Order He will probably forgive a short Remark or two upon the Nature of this Kind of Poem The Age we live in so profusely overflowing in the Practice without stopping to consider Judgment that to common Apprehensions Poetry gives no Idea but of  Words with musical Cadences  that is to say plain Sense in  Rhyme  and  Measure    It may seem surprising that Pretenders to this Faculty few of us having been thought guilty of too little Sensibility should rest contented under the Injustice of so mortifying a ContractionA Poet when consider'd in this narrow Light were so contemptible a Creature that he must give Place to a good  Piper  who unquestionably has Power of raising  Sounds  much more melodious than Adjusters of mere  Words  are capable of equalling  The Truth is Numbers in their softest and most pleasing Fluency make up but one Part of the  Means  mistaken for the  End  They were design'd but as a Vehicle that should insinuate the instructive  Bitter  hid behind the Promise of  Delight  The Music having gain'd the Ear the Matter thence found Entrance to the Heart and there prevail'd against Distempers which but for the fine Disguise it came conceal'd in it had never reach'd with such Advantage there being a Reluctance in our Nature apt to rise against a plain Reproof as in our Taste against such Physic as is offer'd us too coarsely  All as far as this was well The worst was that this Sweetness in the Art expos'd it by Degrees to Profanation by the Ignorant Prompt Adventurers were so glad to find the  Pleasant  the most  Easy  that This Handmaid of supplanted Poetry like the treacherous  Mayors  of the  Palace  in  France  sat her down in and possess'd the Throne she was design'd but as a Servant to  The Learn'd will favour me with their Indulgence while I note for Satisfaction of some Readers of the Sex that will be always surest to hold Interest in a Poet's Purposes that  Epic  Poems are so call'd from a  Greek  Term for  speaking  because here the Verse runs  narratively  as Stage Poems on the contrary are call'd  Dramatic  ones from the same Tongue in Reference to their being  Acted    But it will be still more necessary that some  Definition  of this Species should be also given by an Attempter of it who has Modesty and wishes to avoid a Charge of high Presumption Critics having represented it in such a formidable Light that they could possibly have done no more had they been join'd in a Confederacy to prevent Attempts to write at all instead of furnishing Instructions how to write discerninglyIt will suffice to hear but one or two of These as Witnesses The Voice is all the same one Note throughout the whole Fraternity  It is says  Rapin  the most bold and greatest Work that human Wit is capable of All the Nobleness and all the Elevation of the most perfect Genius can hardly suffice to form one such as is requisite The Difficulty of finding together  Fancy  and  Judgment  Heat of Imagination and Sobriety of Reason Precipitation of Spirit and Solidity of Mind causes the Rarity of this Character's happy Temperament It requires great Images and yet a greater Wit to form themFinally there must be a Judgment so solid a Discernment so exquisite such perfect Knowlege of the Language in which he writes such obstinate Study profound Meditation and vast Capacity that scarce whole Ages can produce One Genius fit for an  Epic Poem  And it is an Enterprize so bold that it cannot fall into a wise Man's Thoughts but it must affright him  By this Time it grows needful that I hasten to cry out and own that the most  vain  and empty Wretch in Nature would be such a  Poet  as conceiving the tenth Part of these prodigious Difficulties in his Way which the  French  Critic had by overheating his Imagination taught himself to think were really there should notwithstanding such Belief have Arrogance enough to undertake a Work so terribly beyond his Compassunder which necessary Shield of honest Truth I will dare venture yet a little fartherinto what our own Sir  William Temple  has declar'd on the same Subject  I am apt says he in his  Essay  upon the Art we are considering to believe so much of the Genius of Poetry and of its Elevation in  Homer  's and  Virgil  's EPIC Works that I know not whether of all the Numbers of Mankind who live within the Compass of a thousand Years for One Man that is born capable of making such a Poet there may not be a thousand born  capable of making as Great Generals of Armies or Ministers of State as any the most renown'd in Story  Caveats  so highstrained as These have made it necessary for an Epic Undertaker to say something That may justify his Modesty A Definition of it therefore in the humbler Light I see it by may hope to shew it a less arduous Adventure and demonstrate that the Difficulty however certainly considerable is by no means so insuperable as These Gentlemen appear to think it Critical Systems reconcile two contradictory Extremes and are at once too  vast  and too  restrictive  The Cause is they lean with a too partial Biass toward a few Great Names to whose Example they would chain down Nature  Many Friends of Fancy on the other Side mistake for Epic Poems any Story told in Verse containing a wild Series of Romantic Incidents related of some Hero whom the Piece takes Name from But there are scarce two Things in Nature which more widely differ than these Histories in Verse from  Epic Poetry  I wish I could have satisfied myself with  Bossu  's Definition It had sav'd me the Presumption of attempting one myself But  His  appearing to be neither  full  nor  clear  and having never seen a better I am forc'd on the necessity of hazarding a new one of my own which will I fear be still defective  I take an  Epic Poem  then to mean some noble Lesson in Morality delivered under Colour of  One Action  which must be illustrious and important in Itself and in its Personages interest supernatural Powers in its Successes and be probably delightfully and surprisingly described in Verse with ornamental  Episodic Parts  depending on and rising naturally out of the main Tendency Throughout all which the Poet keeps no view before him but to strengthen by Example That one moral Lesson he proposes to imprint upon his Reader's Admiration  To explain This Definition by enlarging its ParticularsA Man who undertakes an  Epic Poem  is not to write a  History  but to propagate a  Moral Homer  for Example had conceiv'd such PurposeIt was not his Design to write the  Fall  of  Troy  That Story was already known and could have brought no Novelty but in the Pleasure of the VersesPleasure was not his chief End He aim'd to give  Advice  His Prospect was to teach the  Greeks  split into little independent States that  Union could recover Victory when Discord had transferr'd it to an Enemy  The  Grecian's  Triumph over  Troy  was then discours'd of with much Vanity through all their inconfederate Divisions  Homer  observ'd this Sense of  General Glory  and deriv'd a Story from it that would best enforce the Moral he prepar'd to teach 'em borrowing Names and Incidents from that remember'd and highboasted War but giving 'em a new and proper Turn for the Conveyance of his Moral onlyHad  Homer  not been born till  Alexander  had made  Greece  one Monarchy the Moral he would then have chosen had been the  prosperous Effect of Power in one wise and brave Man's Hand and what sure Benefits accrue from Subjects Loyalty  As we see  Virgil    living in a Time when the Republic of the  Romans  had given Place to Monarchy made it the Purpose of his Poem to reconcile his Countrymen to single Sovereignty in the Person of  Augustus  under Fiction of a Prince brave wise and pious who being guided by the favouring  Gods  establish'd on the Ruins of the old a new Foundation for Dominion of so much more Potency that the whole Empire of the World was by Decree of Heaven to be included in itFrom That new Empire then possess'd by Those he writ to All his Readers had deriv'd their Glory so that it was easy to induce them to confide in and to look for the same Blessings from  their  Change of Government which their great  Ancestors  had gain'd by Change of Country  To impress the Moral forcibly some  Action  is to be related pointing out an Instance in as strong a Light as possible where this insinuated Moral was prov'd good by an  Example  The Action must be  suitable  That is of Dignity adapted to the Greatness of Events wrought into it as Steps toward the Result last purpos'd It must be  single  That is unmix'd with other Actions of detach'd or independent Tendency There may be Incidents producing Incidents the more Variety the better but they must be such as serve but to bring forward and illustrate the One final Action which intends Example from the Work Neither is  this  Restriction any Nicety deduc'd from the particular Opinion of This Critic or of That It is a natural Necessity and a Law of Reason because Actions not producing one another as Effects from Causes raise unpointed and confus'd Reflections and divert and weaken an Attention which it is the Business of This Poem to bind down to one strong Object An Epic Poet of the  Ariostine  Model is a Traveller who if his Road lay strait through  Crete  would take the  Labyrinth  in his Journey  The Action may be  feign'd  or  real  If no Story fam'd in History can be directly levell'd to the Poet's Purpose He may then invent one to his Liking For the  Truth  here necessary consists not in the Reality of the Events but in the natural Veracity existing in the  Moral    It must be  illustrious  and  important  and the Persons animating it  Great Princes  or distinguish'd  Leaders  because Every Man submits to shrink at Consciousness of Dangers or Misfortunes which he sees have Power to punish Error in these  Rulers  of the  World  The Weakness of our Pride that looking down upon conceives Itself secure in its superior Situation from all abject Misery not daring to exempt itself from Menaces It must  look up  to but admitting in this Case the Apprehension of its own Exposure  It must interest supernatural Powers in its Successes  the Influence of wellinvented Circumstances of this Kind carrying  Terror  with it that excites a Reverence and induces Warmth from  enthusiastic  Awefulness into the Subject consonant to those Impressions we are educated to religious Sense of and which favour Disposition to derive All  Good  Propensities from  Heaven  and throw off upon the  Devil  all Instigations which propel to  bad  ones  It must be  probably delightfully  and  surprisingly  described in Verse  Probably  because whatever we suppose impossible we find unworthy our Attention  Delightfully  because Variety of wellmark'd Characters surprising Incidents smoothflowing Numbers Strength of Imagery exalted Thoughts and beautiful Expression keep awake our Expectation stimulate the Fancy and detain us to the Author's PurposeAnd  surprisingly  is added separately tho' a connected Consequence and unavoidable Result from such a wellmaintain'd Succession of unlook'd for and still varying Beauties  Episodes  are necessary Members of extended Action which without them would appear too short and general But all these Episodic Members must be  Limbs  not  Wens  They must unite with such Connexion that displacing any  One  will make the Rest imperfect and that  adding Any  would disgrace the Symmetry  In general the Note most capable of height'ning our Regard to and elucidating the asserted Force of  Epic Poetry  is from a Recollection that it comes down recommended to us by a Choice and Practice that to Reason joins the  best  AUTHORITY  And without  a Parable  spoke He not to them  Being ask'd by his Disciples WHY  speakest thou to Them in Parables  His Answer is  Because to  YOU  it is given to understand the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to  THEM  it is  NOT  given  That is the Obstinacy of these People's Minds misled by Habitudes of Evil makes it necessary that the Doctrine I would teach them should be cover'd and approach attractively where else the Pride that alienates their Hearts would rise against  Conviction  press'd too plainly and propos'd  without Disguise  as Humble Men like  you  are willing to receive it  It is probable the  Hebrews  carried with 'em out of  Egypt  this delightful Way of teaching It is clear at least that they arriv'd to great Perfection in it before  Greece  grew civiliz'd from rude Barbarity So far is it from true that  Homer  or some other Poet of his Country was Inventer of the  Epic  Species All the Books of the Old Testament abound with Instances which prove the Skill of  Hebrew Poets  And the Six hundred thousand Volumes in the  Ptolemaic Library  could hardly fail to have contain'd some of their Poems of this Kind in their due Length and Dignity  To shew how little Difference there is except in Ornament and Size between the Epic Poem as above defined and the short Parables I have been speaking of I will select  Two  only the first taken from the Mouth of  Christ Himself  The other I will go so far more backward for as to the Reign of  David  who was King of  Israel  so soon after the  Trojan War  that he must necessarily have liv'd before the Time of  Homer  to whom  Greece  would partially ascribe the Merit of poetically teaching moral Truth by Fable I shall give more Instances than one of the unwarrantable Presumption of those  Grecians  Vanity in arrogating to Themselves a Praise for Arts they borrow'd from the  Asiatic  People and the  Hebrews  in particular  The Persecution of the Prophets by the  Jewish Priests  was what  Christ  purpos'd to  reprove  but knew their Power was great and that the Pride It had inspir'd 'em with would render a distasteful Doctrine little Fruit if not engagingly insinuated Under this Conviction the Divine Reprover thus addresses them  There liv'd says he in a far Country a powerful Landowner who had planted Vineyards rais'd Inclosures and built habitable Farms on a detach'd Part of his Territory He let out These to Husbandmen and went Himself to where his chief Seat stood upon a very distant Tract of his PossessionsWhen the proper Season came the Lord sent Servants to demand his Rents grown due But those ungrateful Tenants trusting to the Distance for Security from due Revenge instead of Payment  murder'd  the Demanders They destroy'd in the same Manner other Servants sent with like Commission At last resolv'd to try their Boldness to the utmost His own  Son  was sent to whom it was suppos'd they could not dare refuse their Reverence But the Tenants on the Heir's Appearance hoping by  His  Death to make Themselves a lasting Title to the whole Inheritance determin'd on That execrable Deed and kill'd  Him also  The Auditors inflam'd to an impatient Indignation interrupt the Story in this Part of it and cry out angrily  The Lord should have destroyed Those wicked Wretches and let out his Vineyard to honester Husbandmen  And there condemn'd by their own Sentence and struck dumb by conscious Shame they catch the  Application  before  Christ  proceeds to make it for as the Text expresses it  They consider'd his Parable and perceiv'd that he spoke of  Them  In the second Instance  Nathan  reproaches  David  who had robb'd  Uriah  of his Wife and caus'd the Husband to be murder'd But the Prophet understanding well the Danger of the King's Resentment casts about to take him by Surprize and does it under this Disguise of  Parable    I am come says he to ask Relief from Royal Justice in Revenge of a poor Sufferer's Distress against the Cruelty of his Oppressor Two Men liv'd together one rich the other poor The rich Man had exceeding many Flocks and Herds but the poor Man had nothing save one little EweLamb which he had bought and nourish'd up and it grew up together with Him and with his Children It eat of his own Meat and drank of his own Cup and lay in his Bosom and was unto him as a Daughter And there came a Traveller to the Rich Man and he spar'd to take of his own Flock but took the Poor Man's Lamb and dress'd it for the Man that was come to him  What Effect this little Story presently produc'd the Sequel tells us  And  David  's Anger was greatly kindled against the Man And he said to  Nathan  As the Lord liveth the Man that has done This Thing shall surely die because he had no Pity  And  Nathan  said to  David  THOU  art the Man  He then proceeded safely and reproached him that he had tyrannically given way to an illegal Impulse of Desire forcing away the only Wife of a most faithful Subject notwithstanding the unlimited Variety of Women who were All His own Had  Nathan  spoke the Truth thus plainly at its opening It had prov'd perhaps of dangerous Consequence to his own Life but the Cloud of the Invention shielded him and the King's Passions having first been artfully secur'd in the Reproacher's Interest the Reproach'd who had confess'd a generous Sense of the Dishonesty while not consider'd as his own became asham'd to disavow his Virtue when the Guilt laid Claim to his Confession So  David  said to  Nathan    I have sinn'd against the Lord  It is impossible to produce a livelier or more pathetic Proof both of the Nature and the Power of  Epic Poetry  For it is evident that these Two  Parables  differ in nothing but their Want of Names Extent and Paint of Circumstance from the  Poems  of That Nomination  From their general Nature I proceed to the particular Consideration of this new Attempt upon the Plan of  Gideon    A Poet in an Age so factious as the Last has been must have been blind not to discern the Usefulness of recommending  Quiet  to a stormy Generation It were saying nothing to the Purpose to object that we are now remote from  Israel  's Case under no Yoke of Conquest and above all Danger from a foreign Enemy Civil Contest will be always the most likely Means of calling in and aiding the Attempts of such an Enemy We have seen too recent Proofs to doubt that Certainty But not to dwell unnecessarily upon our present happy Prospects our invaded Ancestors too often felt the Weight of such a Situation as had made a  Gideon  the most welcome Public BlessingCould they have  found  him and could all his  Miracles  have serv'd but to unite them in  one  Wish and  one  Endeavour far less lasting and less bloody had Those various Insults then been represented under the Disgrace whereof our History blushes while it tells the Triumphs of so many Conquests over usby  Romans Saxons Danes  and  Normans  Where therefore is the Nation to be found that better ought to like than Ours a strong  Example  to so sound a Moral as that  tho' Disunion should enslave a People joint Attachment to the Legal Government could soon recover and protect lost Liberty  To cloathe this Moral in an  Action  some such disunited People was to be made Choice of suff'ring under foreign Conquest from Effect of their Divisions and when every human Hope had fail'd 'em rais'd at once from their Despair by Union of an inconsiderable Number under a Restorer of their Laws and Freedom  This being what the Critics call the Allegorical or General Plan I never could have found a fitter  Action  to illustrate it than the Redemption of the  Hebrews  under  Gideon  's Conduct from the Yoke of foreign Conquest as impos'd with infinite Contempt and Cruelty by a confederate Body of  Arabian  Princes whom the sacred Writ distinguishes by the joint Name of  Midianites  For the Events of this great War are  there  so comprehensively related as to suit at once with the Design they are selected for and leave sufficient Scope for bold Invention and Embellishment in the particular Deduction Whereas the Scripture History of  David  Mr  Cowley  's Choice was a  completed  one as Mr  Rymer  has objected to it and is so circumstantially describ'd as to restrain a  Poet's Fancy Mr  Dryden  for this Reason could not have succeeded in That favourite Design of His for forming a new Epic Poem from the Story of our Civil Wars in the last Century Yet I remember he has somewhere told us that King  Charles  the Second whom he had acquainted with his Purpose very much approv'd it notwithstanding which I take it to have been to the Advantage of That Great Man's Memory that his Design was never executed The Story was too recent to be treated as it ought and the sublimest Beauties of Invention would have lost their Force on Readers in whom sad and deep Impressions from the Misery of the real Facts must needs have made All Fiction seem too  sportive  and an unbecoming Freedom taken with their solemn Sorrow It was the very Case of  Lucan  and his Subject barring out all Aids of the Poetic Kind at least Those warm ones which let loose Imagination his  Pharsalia  gain'd no Rank but among  Histories  and  Verse  indeed is all the Right of That great Work to be consider'd as a  Poem    The Mention here of Mr  Rymer  leads me to remember an Objection which I think he has unjustly made to Mr  Cowley  's Choice of Subject merely as a foreign one as if it were a Violation of that natural Respect a Poet owes his Country to look out of it for a great Character If Mr  Rymer  had no better Reason for this Censure than that since  Homer  was a  Grecian  and has writ of  Greeks  and  Virgil  being a  Roman  writ of  Romans  therefore Mr  Cowley  as an  Englishman  should have approv'd no other than an  English  Hero the Argument appears to me to be a very narrow and meanspirited oneNature is Nature everywhere and I should never look for any Force of manly Reasoning from a Soul not large enough to comprehend Mankind as One Fraternity However more is to be said in Favour of a  Hebrew  Subject than of All or Any of the Rest whateverThe Reverence we conceive from the Old Testament for Those Objects of God's more immediate Care has made Them  Every Body's Countrymen  Besides the many  Miracles  so terribly display'd among them are peculiar Helps to a Poetic Fancy and adorn their History above that of  Any  other Nation Their Country was the Scene too of our  Saviour  's Life and Sufferings a Reflection which entitles it to Veneration from All  Christians  And to add one smaller Circumstance that still gives Strength'ning to their Claim They were Inventers or at least Improvers and great Practisers of  Poetry  The  Song  of  Moses  their first Leader lists Him early in the Number  Miriam Deborah David Solomon  and innumerable other of their Nation were fine Poets And This ought methinks to recommend their Memory to the Respect of such who would be thought so after them  Having said this the Reader I believe will hardly be displeas'd to see a  Specimen  of  Hebrew Poetry  We meet with many noble ones in the Old Testament but they have the Misfortune to lie shadow'd under obsolete Translation One of our Critics has done Justice to the noble Images of these Originals when he declares that  there is nothing so soft so tender and pathetic and at  the same Time nothing so grand so majestic so terrible and so barmonious as the Poetic Part of the Bible to which All the Heathen Verse is flat and low    I look upon the  Song  of  Moses  which  Josephus  says was written in  Hexameter Verse  to have been a Kind of  Lyric Ode  because it seems to have been sung to some StringMusic and to certain measur'd Motions of the Body This is plainly gather'd from the Text  And  Miriam  the Prophetess the Sister of  Aaron  took a  Timbrel  in her Hand and all the Women follow'd her with  Timbrels  and with  Dances    And when  Moses  and the male Singers had open'd the Ode  Miriam  and the Women answer'd as a  Chorus    Sing ye to the Lord for He hath triumph'd gloriously The Horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea  I leave out the first Verse as conceiving it to have been but a General  Head  and begin at the next following  SONG of THANKSGIVING by  MOSES  On the Overthrow of  Pharaoh  in the  Red Sea    From  EXODUS Chap xv  The First Part only  I  Temples and Altars let us raise  Ours and our Father's GOD provokes our Praise  GOD is our Strength GOD is our Theme  Where  is  Egypt  's fall'n Esteem  Pharaoh  wakes from his proud  Dream    Wakes to feel a Warrior's Hand  Lord of a Power more vast than  His  that shakes his wond'ring Land  Vainly the following Foes  our  GOD defied  Their rapid Wheels in vain tore up the Strand  In vain they  mock'd  the waving Wand

more glowing than in any  Greek  or  Roman  WriterWhen  Longinus  seems to have been moved so strongly by That prais'd Exaltedness of Thought where  Moses  to express GOD's Power with Energy describes Creation not in its extended graduatory Progress but as starting to Existence  at a Word    Let  there  be  Light and there  was  Light  I half suspect with the  French Critic  He had heard of but  not seen  the  Hebrew Bible  He could never else have passed by the prodigious Greatness in the Paintings and Conception of the Ode foregoing and in many other Tracts of  Scripture Poetry  Would he have so profusely given his Admiration to this Passage out of  Homer    "At ev'ry Step th' immortal  Neptune  took  "The Mountains trembled and their Forests shook"  and have said nothing upon That of  David  Hills felt their GOD's  Approach  and veil'd in  Night    Sunk  thro' their trembling  Roots  to 'scape his Sight  We may pity then the  Grecian Vanity  that would divide the Honour of inventing Poetry between their  Orpheus Stesichorus Alcman Pindar  and a Number of their Countrymen whereas in Truth the oldest of all These who was  Orpheus  was but a Cotemporary with  Gideon  in whose Eleventh Year he went a young Man with the  Argonauts  to  Colchos  Now  Gideon  was Years  since Moses  and yet  Moses  died not till the Year of the World Fortyone years after writing the foregoing  Ode  which must have been at his first landing in  Arabia  after crossing the  Red Sea  in the World's Year So that the  Hebrews  had the practical Perfection of the  Lyric  Species for at least Years before the Birth of this Assumer  Orpheus  whom the  Greeks  pretend to have been its original Inventer  It is indeed the most unreasonable Improbability that  Greece  should have been skill'd in so refin'd an Art as  Poetry  when she was little better than a  Savage  so deficient in Improvements of this ornamental Quality that as St  Augustine  has noted the more necessary Use even of the  Grape  was still unknown to the politest of those People the  Athenians  till by  Dionysius  in the Time of  Moses  and a  Greek  Poet wanting  Wine  had miss'd a surer  Inspiration  than his  Muse  's  Ericthonius  of  Athens  was the first Instructor of his Countrymen to yoke their Beasts for  Plowing  and That not till  Joshua  's Days And it was then too that the Use of  Letters  was communicated to the  Greeks  by  Cadmus  from  Phoenicia  a close Borderer on the  Hebrews  Before that Time having no  Alphabet  how could they make Pretence to  Writing  The same national Vanity was manifest again in their asserting  Ida  and  Dactylus  who liv'd but after  Joshua  's Death during the Government of  Othoniel  to have discovered the first Use of  Iron  when 'tis plain from the Old Testament  Genesis  iv and that  Tubal Cain  above a Thousand Years before had  taught Artificers the Workmanship of  Iron  and  Brass And nothing can be more demonstrable from the so oftenmentioned  Chariots Weapons Armour  and vast Magazines of warlike Furniture of all Kinds which we read of among Kings of  Egypt  and  Assyria  than that the People of the  East  were exquisitely skill'd in such mechanic Knowlege at a Time when  Greece  had yet no Name among the Nations  Thucydides  their own Historian has confess'd that in these early Days wherein she would pretend to arrogate Inventions never Hers she was unciviliz'd and wholly rude her Lands uncultivated her Towns few and mean and the Employment of her  Heroes  and high  DemiGods  to rove for Robberies by Sea and Land steal Horses and make bold with other People's Cattle without Sense of Shame or Secrecy  But I forget the  Elegy  which Mr  Cowley  justly calls a most poetical and excellent one He purpos'd to have clos'd his  Davideis  with it It appears to me a Masterpiece of the  pathetic  Kind and I produce it as an Instance that the  Hebrews  were thus skilful in the  simple  Species which the  Greeks  too with their usual Modesty put in for the Invention of long after this fine Piece had been composed by  David    ELEGY by  DAVID  For the Death of  SAUL  and  JONATHAN    KINGS  Chap  i  I  O  Israel  how does all

 Soft and delightful  Partner  of my Soul  Two Halfs divided made us one dear  Whole    Vast was Thy Love and wonderful to  me  And never  Woman lov'd  as I lov'd THEE  I have said enough I hope to justify my Choice of  foreign  Action and a  Hebrew  one particularlyI come now to the new Structure of my Verse where I have us'd the Liberty of  varying  everywhere the  Measure  and of mixing in one Poem All the different Kinds that can be rank'd among  Heroic  What I hop'd from this Extent of Latitude was to derive Increase of  Power  as well as  Harmony  But as this Choice and Application of such bold Diversity of Numbers will require and merit some Defence I will begin it with a previous Note or two in Answer to a modern Cry that has been rais'd against the Use of  Rhyme  in general  It has been attack'd but since we learn'd to  read  and understand  Blank Verse  from Mr  Milton  's noble Work which by the way lay half an Age▪ at lea    unfelt unfriended  and  unnotic'd  in the Country It now casts so bright a Lustre on The Copy of it was with  Doubt  and  Hesitation  boughtfor infamous TEN POUNDS which not being made demandable but on Condition of a  new Impression  never was receiv'd at all Its Author having been in his neglected Grave near Thirty Years before his matchless Poem and  then  only by Effect of  One  Man's single Penetration drew the least Regard upon it from his Countrymen to the eternal Scandal be it noted of our highpresum'd Discernment and the miserable State of  Patronage  among usThis was the hospitable Welcome Blank Verse found in  England  And  now  so strangely can our Currents  turn  our Gentlemen of the new Light are indispos'd to  see  by  any other  They affect the Reputation of a Judgment too severe to be delighted by Effect of  Sounds  and would explode all Consonance of Termination as too trifling and effeminate for Ears of Understanding  What they have objected may I think be summ'd up in these few Particulars  Rhyme  was a  Goth  and came in with the  Runic  Impoliteness Rhyme is  unnatural  because it puts Constraint upon Expression Rhyme is  needless  because Blank Verse has nobler Harmony and gives complete Delight without it  As to the first of These 'tis quite mistaken Rhyme  did not  come in with those Barbarities they charge it to and if it  had  done so what nobler Parentage could It have been deriv'd from than the  same to which we owe our Plans of Liberty  But in Reality It had a far more antient Origin The  Hebrew  Poetry was writ with Rhyme The  Persian  and  Arabian  so peculiarly depended on this Ornament that they have a Kind of Poem in distinguish'd Reverence among them and call'd  Cacideh  deriv'd from immemorial Practice and devoted to the Praise of GOD and godlike Characters Its Frame contains from to Ladies the two leading Verses rhyme together and the Rest alternatively ke  ping▪ throughout but two Rhymes only So that these Poems run the long  st wh  n they light upon such Terminations as afford most Consonances There are many such of  Giami Hasis Schemi Enviri  and others Some of them appear to have been moderniz'd  Reductions  as our  Chaucer  's Works by  Dryden  their old Language being grown obscure in Both of the Countries abovementionedSo this Argument of Rhyme's Defect from want of due Antiquity will carry little Weight against it and might have an Answer still more pointed and particular if it deserv'd to be allow'd that Anything in its own Nature good could be the less so for its  Novelty    They call Rhyme  unnatural  because it puts Constraint upon Expression which however is  not true  for Poets have not only Liberty of  changing  stubborn Rhymes for ductile ones but are  oblig'd to do it  till they find such new ones as  assist  the Sense instead of stiffening or obscuring it But were there All the  Force  they would ascribe to it in this Objection from  Constraint  on the  Expression  what a  partial Eye  is Theirs who censure such Constraint as an unpardonable Slavery where authoriz'd by Custom in a  modern  Tongue yet see no Consequence  but That of a  pretended Beauty  where it borrows Sanction but from the same Authority of  Custom  in the Antient Languages  For not to rest upon their hard and troublesome Restraints to  Quantity  what Curb can possibly be more oppos'd to  Nature  and her easy Order of  Expression  than their interweaving Words and ranging them in so remote and dislocative a Position as the  patulae  in  Virgil  's Verse hereunder from the  fagi  it immediately related to for while the genuine Construction is  You Tityrus reposing under the Shade of a spreading Beech  the  Latin  was constrain'd before it could arrange the Line to Harmony to force it into this distorted Order  Tityre tu  patulae  recubans sub tegmine  fagi    That is in  English  of the same Position  Tityrus you  of a spreading  reposing under the Shade  Beech    What strange Perplexity is here by Custom which we can indulge without a Question thrown upon the  Sense  to liquidate the  Sound  and make the Measure  musical  Let the Reproachers of  constrain'd Expression  shew where  Rhyme  has ever wrung an  English  Verse into so cramp'd a Posture  So again in  Martial    Casta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Paeto  What a charming Figure in  our  Language does This  Latin  Licence make in the same literal Arrangement  Chast her Sword when had deliver'd Arria to Paetus  It must not be pretended that these Instances are  chosen  ones The very Genius of the  Roman  Tongue made such disjointed Shuffle of the Words for ever necessary And yet which of our Exploders of the  infinitely lessconstraining  Use of  Rhyme  would think it reasonable to condemn the not to be disputed Elegance of  Latin Verse  in Detestation of a Practice which is  visibly unnatural  Even their celebrated  Horace  notwithstanding his peculiar Claim to the  Concinnitas  and That  Curiosa Felicitas  so exquisitely fine in his Expression could no more sail free from the oblique Propulsion of this  Side Wind  that blew every  Roman  Poet wide of his true Course than Any weaker and more careless Pilot Witness his  Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium  Diis miscent superis  What would be thought of a Writer in  our  Tongue who when he was purposing to say clearly  Ivy Garlands the Rewards of learn'd Brows rank me  with the High Gods  should express it in this extraordinary Manner  Me of learned Ivy Garlands the Rewards Brows with the Gods rank high    Surely no Man who knowing  Latin  knows that such Constraint as This is unavoidable in all their Versification will pretend to argue against  Rhyme  that It can possibly deserve Explosion for a Fault It is not half so guilty of as This allow'd bad Practice which is notwithstanding overlook'd and held as  nothing  in Comparison with the acknowleg'd Graces in the Tongues it throws such Intricacy on  Rhyme then is neither  newer  in its Practice nor less  natural  in its Use than other Licences to Verse which yet its Enemies are very partially attach'd toWe will see in the  last  Charge whether It ought to be held  needless  from Superiority of Harmony or any nobler or more masculine Perfection in  Blank Verse  or Measure without Consonance  Lord  Roscommon  one of the first Fallers in with the Applause of  Milton  newly in  His  Time beginning to attract Consenters writes his  Essay on translated Verse  in the best  Rhyme  he found Himself at Leisure to afford it But drawing near the End and growing out of Humour with his Choice breaks out at once into a rapturous Declamation against  Rhyme  and  Bondage  in a Specimen which he picks here and there and pieces artfully together out of some of the sublimest Parts of  Paradise lost  to recommend Blank Verse where He Himself had just been disregarding it I think this Manner of proceeding not a fair one The strong Images which animate the glowing Lines he there selected would have made  Prose  Poetry They shake the Fancy and allow no Leisure to the Judgment to examine  Numbers  We are hurried on by the Exaltedness of Thought and rise above Perception of the Mechanism Would he have try'd the Cause impartially he might have found a thousand Lines in  Milton  every one of which had turn'd it quite to the Reverse of his Intention  But now to let the Reader see what Kind of Verse it is these Gentlemen would substitute in Place of Rhyme I take the following Pattern from the mention'd Lord's Translation of the  Ars Poetica    These are the likest Copies which are drawn  By the Original of Human Life  Sometimes in rough and undigested Plays  We meet with such a lucky Character  As being humour'd right and well pursu'd  Succeeds much better than the shallow Verse  And  chiming  Trifles of more studious Pens  We shall presently discern by only placing these lean Lines in the  prosaic  Order whether they have any Title to their Claim of PoetryVERSE in the  literal  Sense we must allow it to be call'd because we but derive the Word from  turning back  and These I own  do That  as oft as they have stretch'd themselves  to their due Length of Measure But observe how readily this Prose may be  unversified  These are the likest Copies which are drawn by the Original of Human Life Sometimes in rough and undigested Plays we meet with such a lucky Character as being humour'd right and well pursu'd succeeds much better than the shallow Verse and chiming Trifles of more studious Pens  If the Enemies to Rhyme had nothing better to produce in Room of it than  This  It would not fail to  live  and prosper nor indeed is there an Argument they use for the Defence of their Opinion but might better aid their Enemies and serve as most Deserters do with double Violence against its Masters Meanwhile It is a pleasant Kind of Tyranny they are for exercising over Reason First they warp to their own Side the Pretence of Right to Harmony and when they have apply'd all Sorts of Argument unjustly for their Service and left none for ours but what they think they may refuse us as of  Counsel for the Plaintiff  they would run us down full Cry as if we had no Weapons to defend ourselves withalIt puts me in Mind of an honest  Indian Traveller  who coming in hard Weather to ask something at the House of a Great Man and being bark'd at by his  Mastives  stoop'd for a Flint but found it frozen to the Surface Deliver me said he from the unreasonable People of this Country  They let loose their Dogs and fasten their Stones  In  Tragedy  Blank Verse may claim a  Preference  as coming nearer to our natural Mode of Speech and yet retaining Dignity enough by virtue of its Measure to exalt it above  Prose  But  Epic  Poets speak in Person and describeing at full Leisure are suppos'd to have due Time for  Ornament  and it will therefore be expected from them so that Blank Verse does not suit  Their  Use since where its Flatness is not animated as in Tragedy by restless Agitation of the Passions It must ever lean to one of these Extremes either degenerating to plain Prose as in the Example before us or becoming harsh affected stiff and obsolete as but too many Times it does in our Great  Milton  from a Purpose to induce Appearance of the  Venerable  where the  Sweet  was wan  ing  The delightful  Mean  is  Rhyme  It keeps Prose distant yet helps  Ease  as well as  Energy  for it was never meant to cramp Expression but lend Sound a Liveliness and what is evidently and indeed  peculiarly  a Benefit deriv'd from this connective Aid to Recollection is that by Retention of the  Rhyme  the Memory catching readily at the coherent  Matter  it becomes much easier to  hold  Ideas this way given us than in Any other Form of Words whatever▪  Mr  D  nnis  who was one of a too numerous Brotherhood who suffer Pangs in mortifying Lengths of  Labour  at the Birth of Every Rhyme and therefore naturally  hate  the Child that cost 'em too much Pain in its Delivery was for turning his broad Axe against our very Root of Argument and has denied that Rhyme is  musical  because says he there is  no Harmony in Unisons  The Face of this Pretence is specious but It ought before it can have real Weight to find some Poem where  All  Terminations close with the same Rhyme  repeated    No  one Note  indeed will make a  Tune  But as we hear with Pleasure the same Note sounded sometimes twice or thrice in solemn Compositions more especially and then give way to different ones the artful Intermixture of All which is  Music  so any tuneful Note tho' sounded separately and more than once is  Harmony  No JARRING Note can stand in Music  Discord  there must be but That Discordance is to rise from Oppositions  All harmonious  in their proper and disjunctive Particles and but differing not  clashing  into Melody by joint Concurrency of  Variations  not of  Inconsistencies  Neither will it be needful to confess that Rhymes are  Unisons  The Question is of no Importance or it would be easy to explain their Difference  Another Reason in Behalf of Rhyme is that no Language is so naturally form'd as  English  for receiving and becoming it The  Latin  Verse tormented and constrain'd as I have shewn it in Pursuit of Harmony could no way have admitted  This  which that it was not in its Genius constituted for or capable of we need no plainer Proofs than the sequester'd Muses of the  Monks  have furnish'd us if ever  Muse  at all inspir'd a  Monastery      Vir  honoratusjacet hîc  tumulatus    Qui prudens  gratus  justus fuit et  moderatus    And again  Hîc Vir

Church    Not even the  Greek  Tongue could have been capable of  Rhyme  nor had it truly the least want of itIt was so musically ductile so sonorously significant that it was naturally a full Tide of Harmony It seem'd to roll along like one of its own  Homer  's Torrents down the Side of a vast Mountain sparkling rapid and sounding in all Parts of its Passage  Yet fain would I with all the partial Fondness of a Lover set in Balance some  Defects  of this triumphant Rival of the Beauty I wish best to against That great Advantage which it would be Blindness to deny her claim to in the tuneful Texture of her Cadences I detest for Instance those abominable Aids call'd  Expletives  a mean and lazy Crutch which not the  lamest  Poet of  our  Nation now submits to heave himself along by They were the dull and insignificant  Stopgaps  of  Greek  Inclosures a Degree at least below the venerable  from whences for to's unto's  and fine  eke's  and  aye's  of our old cleric Compositions  But if Sincerity refuses Patience to a calm Surveyor of this  Grecian Licence  what would it not inspire Contempt to  say  against the servile Disposition of a Race call'd  Commentators  who would have the Privilege Their Poets us'd of mixing in one Piece their different  Dialects  and altering Accents at their Pleasure pass for an  Advantage  to their Poetry as if People long habituated to a Pronunciation the Reverse of many of those motley Rusticisms could in Reverence of a worthless Skill in weaving them together quit their natural Partiality to their own Mode of speakingOn the contrary rejected Idioms must have been extremely irksome to a polish'd Ear and left a Kind of coarse provincial  Brogue  upon the best Performances  Were an  English  Poet for Example to avail himself of this licentious Practice of the  Greek  ones in extending these five Words to  Numbers  and due Length of  MetreThese People were learned Writers  and admit he should be told that in some Counties of the  North  and  West  it was a Custom to give drawling Prolongation to their Syllables and open all the  Diphthongs  and that by Assistance of this  noble Privilege  He might spin out a Verse thus elegantly  Learned Writers These People were  Or because it would be Pity to want  Choice  of good Examples let it be suppos'd that the Three Words  meet glorious Occasion  were to be stretch'd out on some of these  Greek Tenters    Meet glorious Occasion  It is visible enough the Verses are fill'd up by Help of such a frightful  AngloGraecism  But from what Force of  Custom  could we reconcile such  Jargon  to a  London Ear  No Matter what Relief a lazy  Poet  might draw from it It would never give his  Reader  Satisfaction Yet allow it but to be suppos'd that  English  had been a  dead Language  for about a thousand Years and now but studied as a learn'd one for the Sake of antient Stores of Knowlege treasur'd up in its Remains in That Case even the manifest Absurdity above as grosly as it seems to shock us in a living Tongue had pass'd perhaps unnotic'd in the dead one or but brush'd us with a  faint  Perception  But Peace be to the  Manes  of the  Greek  and  Latin  Tongues Their very Faults are venerable from the early Prejudice that roots a Reverence in us for these first Imprinters of our School IdeasThe modern Languages have no such Right to Preference and their Defects may be observ'd more easily and censur'd with less Danger  Tassone  noting a most obvious one in the  Italian  Poetry  confesses with a candid Freedom that he knows not whether to impute it most to the Ill Fortune of his Country's Writers or a certain  Weakness  in the  Language  which says he  wants Energy and is unfit for high Expression  This Defect in That so favourite Tongue which stands acknowleg'd by their own Consent and Testimony chiefly flows from a Redundancy of  Vowels  which tho' sweet'ning a soft Sound  enervates  it  Italian  is the Language wherein  Love  would chuse to sigh or  Laughter  to be light and wanton It supplies with Fulness and Delight the Uses of Intrigue and Conversation but wants Weight and Spring for  Passion  and bends under the Demand of  Comprehensiveness  'Tis like the flowing of soft Sand in Hourglasses seeming liquid while confin'd to its  close Currency  but flies dispers'd and opens its loose Quality as soon as shaken out and trusted to hard Weather  Not to insist in this Place on the too offensive Frequency of their  Elisions  I make Haste to note another where the rash Condemners of our own Excess in  Monosyllables  will wonder I find Cause to charge it But I take their Poverty in That Particular alone to be the Reason why  Italian Rhymes  induce a Kind of leaping Levity upon the Terminations of their Verses They run generally in  Stanzas  the Rhymes  double  and the Structure in this Order  Capitano  Christo  Mano  Acquisto  Vano  Misto  Santi  Erranti  But disyllable or trisyllable Rhymes if I mistake not carry with 'em something of the  Burlesque  Air and suit more aptly with that grinning Face of Wit that loves to wear  Grimace  upon  good Sense  like  Hudibras  than with the grave and serious Majesty that ought to dignify the  Epic  Poetry  Both these Defects are  French  as visibly as they must be confess'd  Italian  But they find some Remedy in  France  in that their Accent frequently is plac'd on the  last  Syllable of their long Words and so their Rhymes appear to terminate more gravely than  Italian  ones which carry it upon their  last excepting one  Take an Example of this best Kind of  French  accenting from  Boileau    Amours  Discours  Unif  rme  Endorme  Ennuyer  Psalmodier  Lecteur  Achepteur  Here All the Rhymes depend upon the terminating Syllable But yet they are not careful to preserve this Benefit too frequently degenerating into  double  Rhymes like the  Italians  as in this of the same  Boileau    De la Foy d'un Chrestien les Mystéres terribles  D'Ornemens egayez ne sont point susceptibles  Et de vos Fictions le Mêlange coupable  Méme à ses Veritez donne l' Air de la Fable  I will  english  these four Lines as near as I can do it to the very  Trip  of the French  Cadence  that the Reader may conceive a proper Notion of their  debonair Heroics    Of the Faith of a Christian the terrible Myst'ries  Reject the gay Dress of impertinent Hist'ries  And the Fictions when mix'd tho' as well as you're able  To the pure Truth itself give the Air of a Fable  I judge with a too partial Ear or there is something so distastefully  alert  to use a Phrase of their own furnishing in the pert  Skipping  of this Verse a Kind of  Pausecheck'd Recoil  of Motion like the  Half whirl  of a Spinningwheel like the  unlacing  of a  Muse  as Mr  Hobbes  expresses it or to hit the Image better in  Lord Dorset  's Simile like the unvaried  Rumbling of a Wheelbarrow  that the Numbers of their serious Poems seem as illadapted to their Subjects as  Jigg Tunes  to a  Church Anthem  We may discover in their very Verse the  dapper Genius  of their Nation a Sort of spirited or animal Vivacity that dances gaily thro' the Fancy without stopping at the Judgment I except their few Examples which have been  by Nature too  excepted of a fierce yet steady Fire and a Reflection both  profound  and  volatile    Concerning other modern Tongues it will be needless to say much What has been hinted of  Italian  will effectually include the  Spanish  and the  Portuguese  the  German  must be own'd worth great Regard for its Antiquity and Manliness but will content itself with That just Praise and claim no Merit from its Harmony Whatever Roughness  English  may be thought to have retain'd is but of  Saxon Origin  and to acknowlege a too obvious Truth Poetry in  HighDutch  is like the  Nile  among its  Cataracts  It may be rapid and deep but 'tis tumbling and terrible It has its Course obstructed everywhere by Mountains it must clamber overTo carry Poetry still further North would be but dragging her to seek for Friends among her Enemies the  Goths  and  Vandals    The  English  then of modern Tongues is fitted best for Poetry Its copious Choice of  Monosyllables  which many have been rash enough to call a  Blemish  make it strong significant and comprehensive Its Derivatives from  Greek  and  Latin  have adorn'd it with Variety of Cadences and intermix'd its masculine Excess of Consonants with a melodious Fluency from interposing VowelsIt adorns and is adorn'd by  Rhyme  yet takes it in but as a Subject not obeys it as her Tyrant It is grave slow stately soft swift wanton or majestic It  has all the Lentor of Complaint and Pity yet has all the Transport of excursive Energy It is an inexhaustibly full Treasury supplied from the selected Tributes of whatever was most excellent in other Speeches but possesses them with so improv'd an Aptitude as to have made  That  HONEY which was raw  Juice  in the Flowers It drew it from  But I digress too far from what I had begun to say upon the Structure of my Verse which differs little from a Species Mr  Cowley  toward the Close of the last Century first reduc'd to Practice and misnam'd  Pindaric  But if he conceiv'd a  Greek  Name necessary  Dithyrambic  had I think express'd his Purpose better From the Latitude of so diversify'd a Numerosity there must arise a fuller Harmony than can consist with common Measure Else a Concert can be equall'd by a single Instrument our usual Coupletwriting sooner satiates by too frequent and too limited Returns of the same Measure Whereas in this perpetual Change of Cadence and new Course of Numbers the Attention is beat up provok'd and render'd lively the Ear everywhere reliev'd and Images of Actions Sounds or Things how different soever they may be are cloath'd with Words best suited to their Nature  The Compass and the Freedom of this Range of Verse have recommended its Attempt to many Practisers in  Odes  and such brief Sallies but too generally with bad Success They check'd the Gracefulness of Stepping by too visible a  Fear  to  fall  Like Children who first learn to go alone they took short tottering Starts and hung upon and rested at All stopping Places they could stretch their Hands to They confin'd their Muse too humbly to a  Lyric  Length of Leadingstrings and gave the snug set roundhead  Crop  to Stanzas that should flow out  cavalierly Pindaric  in short Measure is a Woman of Quality in Kneedeep Petticoats she may have very wellshap'd Feet but they can never be so fine as to atone the  Indecorum Lyric  Numbers carry songlike and familiar Levity quite inconsistent with the  Epic  Gravity A few bold Writers of  Pindaric Odes  have ventur'd nowandthen as far as the  Hexameter  but hardly dar'd so much as dream of the  Heptametrical  sevenfooted Line of fourteen Syllables Indeed the shortest Measure is too long unless That Length is fill'd with Meaning For nothing can be more ridiculous than a weak languishing Extent of Verse without proportion'd Vigour in the Sentiment Such Verse plays loose like some vast main Sail of a Ship that flags and flutters heavily upon the Prospect of a Breeze but presently falls back against the Mast for want of  Wind  to swell it into Energy It is in Poems such as These where as was paintedly express'd by Mr  Pope  but might have been  still more so  by his length'ning out his second Verse to the  Heptameter  Extent just mentioned and hereunder given it by an Addition only of the  two  small Words in  Roman  Characters  A needless Alexandrine ends the Song  And like a  weak and  wounded Snake drags its slow Length along  Mr  Dryden  who was willing enough to allow That Praise to Mr  Cowley  justly due to him for having introduc'd a new and noble Way of Writing is however of Opinion that much still was wanting to his Practice of That wish'd Perfection which This Kind of Verse seem'd capable of He instances the Roughness and the oftdeficient Numbers The Truth is Mr  Cowley  's Judgment not his  Ear  deceived him What his learn'd and Reverend Editor would represent as an Effect of generous Negligence in a too active Race of Fancy seeming to have been the cool and most deliberate Result of wrong Election we may plainly gather This from his own Note to the first Book of  Davideis  where he speaks of This strange Line  Nor can the Glory confine itself to the endless Space  It was in his Intention to express the Struggle of an overflowing Lustre labouring for  Room  in the whole Breadth of Heaven  I am sorry  says Mr  Cowley that it is necessary to admonish the most Part of Readers that it is not by  Negligence  that this Verse is so  loose long  and as it were  vast  It is to  paint  the Nature of the Thing which it describes which I would have observ'd in divers other Places that else will pass for very careless Verses  And then he names these following  Down a Precipice deep down he casts them All  And This  Like some fair Pine o'erlooking all th'ignobler Wood  Painting the Image by the  Sound  is questionless one of the liveliest Beauties of which Verse is capable But how far That is done by  running out of Measure  and admitting plain  Prose  as an Ornament in  Poetry  I leave to be determin'd by the Judgment of the Reader He will recollect that  Homer  was and  Virgil  in his Imitation everywhere ambitious of this verbal colouring but They neither of 'em thought it necessary to That End to  disarray  and  prosify  their Numbers On the contrary they rais'd and added to their Harmony by a melodious Latitude that circumscrib'd at once and dissipated by Effect of this allcomprehending Practice Mr  Cowley  needed not have started out of  Numerosity  to reach effectually the View before himFor Example  Nor finds the struggling Glory Room closepress'd o'er boundless Space  For the Second  Down o'er a Cliff's steep Precipice deep down he casts 'em all  For the Third  O'erlooking like some tow'ry Pine th' ignobler Underwood  And here are three successive Instances of the great Use and Benefit an  English  Poet has it in his Power to make by sparingly and always  aptly  daring to launch out into the long  Heptameter  Extent of Measure But there will be found too much  obstructive  VOID in this poetic  Saul  's big Armour if a  Dwarf  in Genius should attempt to wear it  Mr  Cowley  's Ear indulg'd him in another equally untuneful Practice which in Reverence to the neverfailing strong Characteristic of the Tribe of Imitators the  Implicites  in  His  Track have All with devious Diligence been careful not to start a Step from He too often plac'd his  Pauses  in the wrong Part of his Verse They should in the long Measures be found always posited exactly I subjoin an Instance of the Error  Lo how the Years to come a num'rous and wellfitted Quire  Here was nothing that resembled  Numbers  no Harmony at all unless the Reader paus'd at  Nume  in the Word  numerous  and if he  did  so pause in that divided Word he made a disagreeable  Hiatus  in the  Sense  and would have wounded a nice Ear as harshly as an old  Greek Expletive  How infinitely more majestically flows the Verse hereunder tho' the Measure is the same and Both are Mr  Cowley  'sfor no other Reason but because the Pause is here plac'd rightly  The Mountains shake and run about no less confus'd than They  Run about  indeed may want a little of the purpos'd Greatness from the too light  Vulgarity  of the Expression  Strive to fly  had been perhaps more aptly suited to both Sound and Image But I introduce the Verse in this Place only with a View to the right placing of its Pause so wrongly judg'd in the preceding one  That noble Writer seems to have been sensible of the Perplexity this Roughness of his Numbers nowandthen must throw a Reader into For he gives a most exact Description of  Pindaric  Verse as he then practis'd it in his  Ode  upon the  Resurrection    'Tis an unruly and a hardmouth'd Horse  Fierce and unbroken yet  Impatient of the Spur or Bit  Now prances stately and anon flies o'er the Place  Disdains the servile Law of any settled Pace  Conscious and proud of his own natural Force  'Twill no unskilful Touch endure  But flings Writer and Reader too that sits not sure  This was the true Condition under which he left it But if he had liv'd to give the needful Hand to what he so successfully had introduc'd 'tis probable he  would have so far chang'd his Practice that it had been nearlier describ'd in  This  from his fine  Ode  on  Liberty    The plain Heroic Strain let others take  Mine the  Pindaric  Way I'll make  The Matter shall be grave the Numbers loose and free  It shall not keep one settled Pace of Time  In the same Tune It shall not always chime  Nor shall each Verse just to his Neighbour rhyme  A thousand Liberties It shall dispense  But yet shall manage All without Offence  Or to the Sweetness of the Sound or Greatness of the Sense  A Species  once  I think was tried in  Tragic Poetry  not wholly differing from this new  Composite Order Aristotle  notes it of a Work of  Cheremon  a Scholar of  Socrates  The Piece was call'd the  Centaur  and compos'd he says of  All the different Sorts of Verse  He should have added  except long ones  For he disapproves That Practice in  dramatic  Works because  Iambics  and  Tetrameters  and such SHORT Measures were too skipping and too light for  serious  Poetry Our Language carries natural Gravity and might allow short Measures with less Lightness Yet they ought not to be often us'd in  Epic Writings  even of This new Sort and never but in Places where they help the Harmony without detracting from the Dignity  That This Poem is divided into  Twelve  Books was a Determination of so little Consequence that 'twere impertinent to offer at a Reason for it These are Points indifferent and in which a Poet will not need to strengthen his own Practice by Examples The Extent of his Design should be a Guide in his Division of it Mr  Cowley  professedly imitated  Virgil  in his Choice of Twelve Books to his  Davideis  tho' I think he might as justly have rejected  Virgil  's Number as He  Virgil  had rejected  Homer  's The Number of whose  Books  too the  Roman  would methinks more  gracefully  have been a Borrower of than of his  Episodes  and  Incidents  Sir  William D'avenant  springs quite aside from this old imitative Road but into an Extreme as wrong tho' opposite He is for neither  Books  nor  Proposition Invocation  or  Machinery  Like some of those stiffhearted  Puritans  who dirtied his own Times and would hear Sermons with their Hats upon their Heads in Defiance of  Church Ceremony  He divides his  Gondibert  into  Five Acts  as if it were a  Tragedy  and Each Act into  Cantos  which may hold he says the Place of  Scenes  This Method Mr  Hobbes  in a long prefatory Tract thought worth his Pains to justify but was I think Himself the sole Supporter of his Argument In Matters left indifferent the old Way if not  best  is sure to be the  modestest  For my Part if Division into Twelve Books needs more Reason than because the Subject offer'd Matter for That Number I should think it fully justified from the Division of That People  whom it treats of into their  Twelve Tribes  If still a stronger Reason should be ask'd for take it  thus  The Action of an  Epic Poem  ought not to be stretch'd beyond one Year and  Twelve  Months make up the Division of the Term so limitedAnd now I enter on the  Referential Notes  in Every Section mark'd progressively  Sect I L  Seek O Soul some Heavenly Theme  It was the Custom of  Greek  Poets to mix in one the  Proposition  and the  Invocation  The  Latins  and the Moderns mostly follow them propos'd their Subject first and then invok'd Assistance from the MusesIt becomes a  Christian  Poet better to begin with  Invocation  It is a Way more solemn and proportion'd to the Weight of an Address to  our Inspirer  not alone to pray his Aid in the Performance but his previous Guidance in the very Choice of what we go uponThat  Invocation  should by no means be omitted seems a Point agreed for many different Reasons A Work that has its first Foundation in a Moral Purpose owes a Reader says  Bossu  a good Example for his Piety and Veneration Add that many Things must be describ'd in Course of these Great Poems which the Poet not being thought in any reasonable Likelihood of coming to so full a Knowlege of by any common Means of Information He could never hope to give his Testimony Weight enough to merit  Faith  but from impressing first his Reader's Mind with a Conceit that Heaven infus'd itSir  William D'Avenant  then did ill to throw aside his  Prophet's Mantle  What the  Robe  is to the  Judge  the Poet owes to  Invocation    Sect I L  Redeem the Use of longlost Poetry  Every body knows that the Original of Poetry was in  the Worship of the Gods  and Celebration of their Glory It is equally notorious how degenerate It is since become in its too  beggarly  Flattery as Mr  Cowley  calls it of Great Men He adds in  idolizing  Women which last Observation to discredit Gallantry He was so fitted for and so excusable for painting I would certainly have let alone had I been Author of his MISTRESSTo  redeem  the  Use  of Poetry then is to restore it to the  Praise  of  God  to the Advancement of true  Virtue  and to Animation of those noblest  Passions  which lend Wings to human Ardour  Sect II L  Wilful they started from protective Grace  Among the many Arguments enforc'd by  Democratic  Writers against  Monarchy  It seems the most immodest one and the least founded upon Reason when they are for Listing  God Himself  into  Their  Party From what Appearance they deriv'd this Claim it is not easy to discover since the  Unity  of Power  ascribed to the Almighty by Themselves as well as their Opponents does not seem at all to favour any Preference of the remotest Form of Government on  Earth  from That which  Heaven  is rul'd by Yet there runs no Principle more universally asserted through the Writings of the warm Enthusiasts of the last unquiet Century than that GOD declared Himself aloud for the Republican System by his personal Command to  Moses  for prescribing  That selected Form  to his own chosen Race of People For they insist that the  Mosaic  Model was a  Popular  one They hold it too a Claim assigned them with so full a Right to their  political Freewill  that GOD submitted Laws and Propositions to the People's Confirmation or Refusal and became the  Civil Magistrate  of their  Theocracy  That when accordingly they found it proper to DEPOSE Him from his temporal Authority I use the very Word which  Oceana  and many other of their Treatises take Boldness to make free with and to chuse Themselves a King who should reign  with  them in His Stead GOD blam'd but their  Ingratitude  confessing and admitting their asserted  Right  to  SamuelIt is not  Thee  they have rejected but they have rejected  Me  that I should not reign over them  and that what is meant by  giving them a King  IN WRATH was a Reproach that they inclin'd to chuse a  King at all  and so but consequential Menace that Their Monarch should enslave 'em into a corrected Sense of That superior Happiness they parted with in Favour of him  This still continuing to be the Light wherein they see That  Hebrew Revolution  'twill be pulling down one Prop of their political Fabric to make plain in Course of these Reflections that the Government of  Israel  as assign'd by GOD was  not  a Commonwealth but an  Hereditary Monarchy  and that All the  Hebrew's  Miseries in those successive Slaveries they fell into for three hundred Years together were a natural Effect of Factions and Confusions which the  Princes  of their  Tribes  became divided by upon assuming to Themselves in their provincial Severalties a secular Direction of the  military  Power which in their first Institution was the  Sovereign  's  Prerogative exclusively  together with a Right of  Judicatory  in the last Appeal on  Civil  Causes only reserving to the Popular  Assent  or  Dissent  the Election or Rejection of new Laws originally to be brought before the  Congregation  and  enacted  by and with the People's Approbation and the  Regal Fiat  of the Sovereign Authority  I propose to leave it undeniable that This Sovereign Power was vested in the  High Priest  personally and that  Moses  plac'd it not in  his  defective Line but in his BROTHER's who had many  Children  down successively to whom descended the  Monarchic  with the  Sacerdotal  sole Supremacy and form'd That Species of Administration call'd  Theocracy  not to be understood as if GOD in his own immediate Person condescended to be  King in Israel  but as assisting with his  influential Presence  always virtually and sometimes openly and miraculously to inspire and actuate the High Priest's Determinations I pretend to make this System clear in all its Branches and to reconcile to it the whole Gradation of Events to That destructive Period under  Saul  at which Time  first the  Priestly  Power became  subordinate  to and dependent on the  temporal Royalty  as in the other Eastern Nations that lay nearest to 'em  It may merit Recollection that the  Papal  Claim to an  Infallibility in  Christian  Spirituals  has sometimes made such near Approach to take in  temporal Supremacy conjunctively  as in no very wide Degree to hold Itself remov'd from Prospect of a  new Theocracy  And nearer still was That of the old  Caliph  's Claim in the  Mahometan  first Outstart of  Enthusiasm    Sect II L  Then  GIDEON  wise and generous Leader rose    This Line begins the PROPOSITION and the Progress of the Section specifies the ACTION of the PoemIn its Opening it is  general  to teach in the Example of the Leader nam'd that the Inspir'd by Heaven are to apprehend no Danger from the most unequal Opposition all  divided  Power becoming weaker on Exertion while  united  moves  direct  and still grows stronger in That Motion The Proposition next descends to the  particular  declaring it to be the  Redemption  of  Israel  from her Yoke of foreign Conquest  It is a terrible Dust the  Critics  raise in their Disputes concerning the best Way of opening Propositions Every body agrees with them in recommending  Modesty  but  Fulness  too seems not at all unnecessaryI can be as unsatisfied with  Statius  as  Bossu  has been for his encumb'ring the Proposition of his  Achilleid  with Declarations  that his Hero had frighted the Thunderer  as also with his personal Boasts how nobly He the Poet had  exhausted Inspiration  insomuch that  Thebes  so sung by  Him  should reverence him as her  second Founder  In a just Dislike of This All Men of common Sense must join but from Effect of the same Sense they ought to quit his Cause I mean  Bossu  's when undiscerningly attach'd to every casual Choice of  Homer  or of  Virgil  he deduces an Authority to state  Their  Practice as a not to be disputed Standard for All  Epic  Plans to follow  There is a celebrated  Ipse dixit  which has been too long consented to upon this very Subject of the  Proposition  and which it is now high Time to weigh and find too light even after I confess it  Horace  's If I have any Notion what it is he means He either has meant evidently wrong or which 'twere bolder to suspect him guilty of has  misexpress'd  his own true Meaninghear him in  Lord Roscommon    Do not begin as That old  Scribler  did  Priam's  proud War and Fate I mean to sing  What  worth such Noise  produc'd this bellowing Bard  How much more just spoke  Homer  always wise  Muse paint the Man who after  Troys  great Fall  Manners  and  Men  and  num'rous Cities  saw  Not Smoke from Fire but Fire from Smoke HE draws  And from  This Flat  to dreadful Wonders tow'rs  To barking  Scyllas Cyclops  and  Charybdis  In the first Place I can see no Reason why because One Man has undertaken to describe a War and prov'd not equal to his Enterprize Another therefore should be  arrogant  in but proposing the same Subject And as to  Modesty  of Proposition for the want of which the Writer is here treated ill by  Horace  and accus'd of  Noise  and  Ostentation  I am frank enough to dare confess that the  Immodesty  if there is Any here lies too conceal'd for my Discernment Pray what could any Author who design'd That Subject have contriv'd to say upon it  less  when he was entering on the Proposition of it Where is the too much  Fire  in his Beginning Smoke in the Progress can be nothing to our Purpose why is there more of  Pomp  express'd or why more Expectation rais'd from a plain Promise to describe the Ruin of  one Town  and Death of  one Man  than to shew the  Manners  of  many Men  and treat on the Affairs of  many Cities  If we were not to expect Accounts of not alone the Things  Ulysses saw  but also  why  he saw them to what End then did  Homer  promise any thing about 'em in his Proposition If we were to entertain That Expectation certainly our Hopes are higher rais'd by  Homer  who assures us we shall hear of many Cities and of many Men than by the  other  who propos'd to set before us but the Ruin of one City and one Man's Destruction  There is a  Narrowness  in these implicit Reverencers They understand and follow in their Author's Rear with a too creeping and too blind Servility Who  reads  and is not  Horace  's Admirer and yet  who  shall be afraid of saying He would better have instructed us by some intelligible plain Precept on this Point of  Propositions  than by Two illunderstood and wide ExamplesTo conclude with my own humble Notion of the Matter He certainly proposes well who comprehends within his Proposition the Extent of his whole Meaning and adds nothing further And  He errs  as certainly who being scrupulously terrified by Words without a Reason is kept back by groundless Fear of saying more than This or That Man would have said upon the Subject and says  less  than his own Meaning calls for  Sect III L  Not to Pride's transient Phantoms poorly kneel  I would not be misunderstood in this Place as renouncing Reverence for the Age I live in or for Any Great Man who adorns it I  except  all such whose  Minds  are no Partakers in their  Greatness  What I mean by my unfashionable and not overpolitic  Abjuration  is no more than that I blush to find it is not thought below the Condescension of a Man of Genius to confine his Views to little Hopes and transient Interests from the Powerful His Business as I take it being rather to assert and vindicate  neglected Excellence  than to be poorly prostituting his  Hosannah to the  HIGHEST The Poet and the Priest Antiquity  so join'd 'em ought to guide their Ends  not  by the Humours Inclinations or immediate Passions of the Age they write in They should carry down their Prospect through  Futurity  and never rate their Recompence at all the lower from their  Person  's being doom'd to  die  before it reaches 'em  Sect VII L  Had restless  Midian  pour'd her swarthy Hosts    What People these  Midianites  were into what Nations divided how govern'd and where seated as also who are now their Descendents I shall have Occasion to describe in the next Book This Race had wasted  Israel  for seven Years within the last of which about the Time of Harvest the Poem takes Beginning that so the Unity of Action might be properly maintain'd in comprehending only their Redemption without Retrospect to their Invasion which had form'd  Two  different Actions and destroy'd the Regularity requir'd in  Epic Poetry  Critics believe they see that for this Reason only  Homer  commenc'd his  Iliad  in the tenth Year of the Siege and  Virgil  his  Aeneid  in the last Year of the Voyage No doubt they had been else incumber'd by Excess of Matter  Sect VII L  To These old  Amalek  her Standards join'd    This numerous and mighty Nation will have Place at large among the Notes of the succeeding Book They were the  Hebrew's first  and  surest  Enemies  First  because  They  first attack'd 'em in their March when they were  beaten  under  Moses  And  surest  as the  Israelites  receiv'd particular Command from GOD never to make Peace with the  Amalekites  but pursue till they had quite eradicated them And this at last they very nearly had accomplish'd after many hundred Years were past first What in this Affair I find least comprehensible is GOD's remembring for a People who Themselves had long forgot this Right to Vengeance They appear to have deserv'd it very little it being  after  their  Rejection  of His Care concerning them I am at some Loss therefore to account for the surprising Rigour of the Curse denounc'd on  Saul  by  Samuel  three hundred and fifty Years after the Injury receiv'd in Punishment of but a generous  Pity  shewn to  Agag  when his Prisoner As the Compassion was a Virtue and 'twere hard to think the  Prophet  's Love of  Vengeance  keener than the  King  's the Anger could arise but from a Recollection that such Mercy shewn to  Amalek  was a Contempt express'd of  Heaven  there standing out an unrepeal'd Decree for total Extirpation of That People  Sect VII L  Their heavy Harvests load the plund'ring Foe  From the Story of this War as in the Book of  Judges  It was predatory and incursive and the  Hebrews  after their first Contest had abandon'd all the Plains and open Country and secur'd themselves among their Fastnesses on rocky  Mountains while the Enemy maintaining Winter Quarters in some Cities which they held on Purpose made Excursions thence in Summer to destroy the Harvest burn the open Towns and Villages and carry off as Plunder People Cattle and whatever else fell into their Possession  Sect VIII L  Where Half the  MANASSAEAN  Tribe  c  Jordan  that rises in the  northern  Part of  Palestine  runs almost strait  South  through the whole Length of the Country nine Tribes and a Half of the Twelve in the Division made by  Joshua  of the conquer'd Lands had been allotted the Possession of That Tract between the western Shore of  Jordan  and the Neck of the  Levant  or  Syrian Sea  excepting only that the Coast Itself together with a Breadth of some Miles inward was possess'd by the  Philistines  and the rich and powerful trading States of  Tyre  and  Sidon  The other two Tribes and a Half being Those of  Reuben Gad  and one Half of  Manassah  held the Country lying Eastward along  Jordan  which was conquer'd first of All by  Moses  from the  Amorites  and their Allies But That Half Tribe of the  Manassans  which is here alluded to had their Allotment to the West of  Jordan  It was a long but narrow Slip of Land which trended from the River's Brink 'twixt  Issachar  and  Ephraim  almost to the Sea Coast abovemention'd On a Mountain toward the East End of this Slip of Land in Sight of  Jordan  stood the City of  Ophra Gideon  's Birthplace safe from Insults of an Enemy by its impregnable Situation At the Foot of this high Mountain open'd a large beautiful and fruitful Valley That of  Jezreel  where the  Midian  Army is suppos'd to lie encamp'd at This Time whence the Poem takes Beginning This Valley of  Jezreel  has been the Scene of many bloody Battles It was there our  Gideon  overthrew the  Midianites Saul  the  Philistines Achab  the  Syrians  And in more modern Times the  Tartars  the  Saracens    Sect VIII L  This Tree a Shade o'er half the Mountain cast  That there was a Tree and a Bench under it before  Joash  's House we have the Testimony of the Bible which informs us that an  Angel of God came and sat there  but that it was so large and old a Tree is a poetical Discovery That it was remarkable however for its Size and Situation may be gather'd from its being thought worth so particular a Notice in the  sacred Story  But because I have suppos'd it  many Ages old  and yet in its full Flourish It is necessary I say something in Defence and Honour of these venerable Children of the Earth  Pliny  tells us of  Oaks  growing in his Time suppos'd to have been coeval with the  World Itself  Their Roots says he were united and rais'd into Arches like the Gates of Cities and the Earth was swell'd about 'em into Mountains  Josephus  has made Mention of a Turpentine Tree that was thought as old as the Creation Mr  Maundrel  in his Journey to  Jerusalem  affirms He measur'd one  of the Few yet remaining  Cedars  of  Lebanon  and found it above twelve Yards round the Body and that at almost one hundred Foot high It spread out into five several Limbs the least of which would have been singly a great  Tree  Sir  Francis Drake  informs us that he measur'd a huge  MasticTree  in one of his Voyages that was  four and thirty Yards about  It is easy to infer These vegetable Giants must have borne the Growth of no small Number of AgesSt  Jerom  too relates that he had seen the very  Sycamore Tree Zacchaeus  climb'd into to look upon our  Saviour  when he rode in Triumph to  Jerusalem  But the  Tree of Trees  at last is an old  English Dryad  one that Mr  Evelyn  in his  Sylva  mentions with becoming  Gravity  and hands down to us the Record of such a  Magna Charta  in its Reverence as deserves to be remember'd and maintain'd to an immortal Length of Triumph And no Doubt It  will be so  by those bold Sons of Liberty who boast the Honour of their Birth within  due Distance  of its Shadow The abovenam'd Gentleman asserts from his own Knowlege that there is This pleasant Kind of Privilege annex'd to an old  Oak  which has Time out of Memory been the Glory of  Knoll Wood near Trely Castle  in  Staffordshire  The Shade of This Tree's Boughs he says is very ample and in due Respect to its Antiquity whoever will make Oath on Birth of any Child who must call nobody Its Father that This Child was actually begotten  within any Part of Its Shadow  the Offence is free and stands exempted from all Cognizance whether of civil or ecclesiastic MagistrateBut to return to the Longevity of Trees undignified by so indulg'd a  Sanctuary  Mr  Lawson  in his Tract of  Orchards  has brought reasonable Arguments to prove a  Pear  Tree's Life may be a  thousand Years  And truly if the Age of  Man  before the Flood was from Six hundred to Nine hundred Years it can be no great Rashness to imagine that an  Oak  so much more durable and solid in its Substance and not subject to the Dangers and Diseases which disorder human Bodies may be capable of living many thousand Years the Soil suppos'd  adapted  and no Accident arising that might interrupt or stop its Progress And thus much I thought it not amiss to note in Reference to the Age I have assign'd the  Oak of Gideon    Sect IX L  The Morning rising over  Israel  's Spoils    The Description which this Verse begins I took some Pains to make a pleasing one but would not have it thought I introduc'd it to make Way for OrnamentNot but  Description  is the  Life  of Epic Poetry and it is There as  Boileau  well observes the Poet ought to lavish all his Fancy and his Rhetoric yet if it serves no other End than mere  Delight  the Poem will be found to languish for the Race of  Action  is too coldly stopp'd in Favour of  detach'd Ideas  BOSSU writes much to say a very little to the Purpose in his Chapter of  Descriptions  Mr  Dennis  is more clear and hits the Point directly in one short Remark of his Discourse against  Prince Arthur Descriptions  says this Gentleman  ought never to be made in Epic Poems unless necessary which they never can be but in one of these two Cases either where of Use for giving us a reasonable Account of some Part of the Action whereby to make it  probable  or when they serve to  imprint strongly  some important Circumstance    It is in this last View that the Description of the Morning dawning over  Gideon  shadow'd by his Oak was introduc'd in order to impress a strong Conception not of the Place and Posture simply but of all the hostile Prospect opening before him to convey a local Image and transmit the Sense of Danger and of his Reflections on it from the  Hero  's to the  Reader  's Passions as we see in common Life how forcibly Regards of  Place  assist Imagination He who had seen  Edge Hill  or  Newberry  or  Naseby  would have found himself more strikingly attach'd in reading the Accounts our History records of those three Battles  Sect X L  Here and there highmettled Steeds  The Use I make of  Horse  in the Progression of this War being frequent and considerable I take Occasion from their first being mention'd in this Verse to assert the Use of  Cavalry  among the  Hebrews  lest some hasty  Doubt  perhaps might censure it as not in Practice in That early Period And the rather because  Homer  writing of a War much  later  makes no Mention in His Work of  Horsemen  but describes That noble Creature in no other Manner than as harness'd to the skirmishing little  Chariots  of his  Greek  or  Trojan  CaptainsHow this happen'd in the  Iliad  I am not able to account for tho' that his Countrymen were then unskilful to  back Horses  I can easily enough believe because not long before they had mistaken the first Horsemen they had ever seen for compound Creatures HalfMan HalfHorse and given 'em the Name of  Centaurs  from the Business they seem'd fondest of which was to steal their  Cattle  But that such too should have been the Case among the  Trojans  must not be so readily admitted  Troy  held the Empire then of  Asia Minor  and drew powerful Allies to her Assistance from so many distant Places that it is impossible to fancy they were All unskill'd in  Riding  when so many Ages before That the Wars all over  Asia  had been dreadfully distinguishable for the Number of their  Cavalry Ninus  the Founder of  Nineveh  had enter'd  Bactria  with Two hundred thousand  Horse  besides his Chariots which were above a Hundred thousand  Semiramis  his Wife who was the Builder of  Babylon  invaded  India  says  Suidas  with a Million of  Horsemen  and of  Chariots  arm'd with  Scyths  at the End of their Axle trees above a Hundred thousand also  It may be surmis'd that Horsemen in such Numbers in those early Ages probably were overrated by the Inaccuracy of Historians Let it be so It has no Force against the  Use  of Horse in War so antientlyIf therefore the  Assyrians  thus abounded in their Cavalry It must be past Dispute that bordering Nations also had the Use of 'em and cou'd not have come so far with Purpose to invade  the  Hebrews  without bringing Numbers in their ArmiesAs for the  Hebrews  Themselves  Scripture  is full of Instances how early They were able  Horsemen  and it had been strange indeed to find them otherwise when we remember they came out of  Egypt  where the  Pharaohs  were so generally powerful in Arms and so particularly furnish'd with fine  Cavalry  that  One  of 'em pursued the  Hebrew  People in their March to the  Red Sea  with  Fifty thousand Horse  says  Josephus  and Two hundred thousand Foot  besides  all the  Chariots  of  Egypt    Sect X L  In other Parts the Scytharm'd Chariots driv'n  Concerning these Chariots an antient and terrible Invention and of infinite Effect in those vast open  Plains  of  Asia  the most proper Place to speak at large will be in the Remarks upon the second Book and there a full Description will be found not only of the Chariots Themselves but of the different Ways of  using  and  avoiding  them and what Effects they  did  produce and might have been made capable of producing  Sect X L  The tortur'd Drums and sprightly Trumpets join'd  The Antients made great Use of  Drums  though differing in Shape and Mode of beating from the Ways in modern Practice They were not struck upon by  Sticks  but with strong Pulsion of the Hands alone and both at Top and Bottom being ornamented round their Rims with thickset Plates of jingling Brass And certainly such Drums must have deriv'd their Use from the most early Times having been found with the  Chinese  when first discover'd by the  Europaeans  And for the  Trumpet  there are such concurring Proofs of its Antiquity in  Holy Writ  that I was much surpriz'd at Mr  Pope  's Assertion in his Notes on  Homer  that it was not yet invented in the  Trojan War  That War was in the Time of  Abdon  's judging  Israel  and Trumpets were so long before in Use among the  Hebrews  that the  Ark  was never mov'd nor any Congregation summon'd but by the Sound of this known Instrument They had a Festival too call'd the Feast of  Trumpets  The Walls of  Jericho  fell down at Sound of  Joshua  's  Trumpets Gideon  blew a  Trumpet  and All  Abiezer  was gather'd after him  Moses  in the very Wilderness directs the making Silver  Trumpets  whose Shape and Dimensions suit exactly with Those now among usHow has Mr  Pope  then form'd this Notion that they knew no Use of Trumpets in the  Trojan  War Was it because he found it not in  Homer  Possibly his  Greeks  were yet too rude to have acquir'd the Practice in their Armies Possibly they held it too inspiring and exciting as we read that some of their vain Countrymen the  Lacedemonians  rejected it long after as a Stirrer up of Courage which it seems they had a mind to represent as naturally overactive in their ConstitutionTherefore march'd to Battles with the soft appeasing Sound of  Flutes  and  Flagelets  before 'em They would induce their Enemies to think They rather found it needful to correct the  overboiling of their Ardour than propel and irritate it  Virgil  however gives  Aeneas  a Trumpeter and says He had before belong'd to  Hector Virgil  therefore thought the Trumpet was of That Antiquity and out of all Dispute It was of older Origin  Sect XI L  Light from his Bench enrag'd young  Gideon  leapt    From  design'd  Effect of those fine Prospects which lay stretch'd before him For the natural and improv'd Embellishments of such a fruitful Valley when survey'd together with the Enemy whose Rapine held it from the famish'd Owners must inflame the Spirit of a suffering Observer into aggravated Sense of what he felt and  apprehended  for his Country The natural Consequence of such a Flame in such a Mind as  Gideon  's was the rousing all those Passions which break out in his Soliloquyand serve to open his true  Character  the Reader being yet a Stranger to it and It must have touch'd him in a fainter and less animateing Manner had It been in a cool Form of  Narrative  anticipated to him  Sect XI L  Now were some single Pow'r a gen'ral Bliss  The  Hebrews  after  Joshua  was dead concluded only a slight War of little Consequence in the South Parts of  Judah  during the Reign of  Phinehas  and then with one concurrent Lapse from any further Application to their instituted Modes of military Practice under general Attachment to  dependent Regulation  threw That Care in a  divided  Trust to their provincial Heads of Tribes who now had their allotted  Severalties  in Territory and in Civil and  Palatinate  Pretensions and fell in with the whole People's Disposition to improve and cultivate their  Lands  drinking as the Text expresses this Desertion of the Public Duty for the private Interest  Every Man under his own Vine and  eating  under his own Figtree    This universal Spirit of Defection met too little Opposition from a Want of due Attention in their  priestly Sovereigns  to the  Civil  Branch of their Prerogative and of the  Military  still more willingly as from their Turn of Education less adapted to its Duties They depended on the awful Influence of their divine Preeminence and their Possession of the  Ark of God  whereto lay All Appeals and to whose final Sentence in the  High Priest  's Voice the People were injoin'd implicit and direct Obedience under Penalty of  present Death by stoning  so they took no Care to educate some martial Genius such as  Joshua  's had been and to  attach him by his Interest  to sole Dependence on the Royal Safety under whose delegated Right to That Supremacy in warlike Exercise the Tribes had been till then enur'd and disciplin'd and held unitedly together  The Knot had long been loosening but Love of Ease and Taste of Luxury now all at once dissolv'd itTill this fatal Lure in their detach'd Divisions of the  Land  the Want of Property among Particulars sustain'd no other than the  general Interest Hope of the  future  from the State's Prosperity kept every Individual Easy in his  present  Indigency The joint Distress of their collective Body held it close compacted like a Heap of Pebbles in a watry Soil froze hard together The new Warmth of Selfdependency dissolving the Adhesion Every Offfalling Pebble became a  separate Body  and contributed no longer to the Texture of the  Universal  In this dispers'd Condition what before had been  immoveable  by virtue of its  Weight  lay liable thenceforth to be trod down by every Hoof and only magnified its Breadth to ruin its Consistency  Plenty in Ease was the first Step toward Anarchy It drew on Disregard of public Happiness The next was Wealth with Luxury to which succeeded Pride and That in natural Consequence produc'd Contempt of Law soon follow'd by Defiance of Authority The sure Result of All together was Dissension and ConfusionTurbulent Ambition set up Every  Tribe  to wish and act with views to Independency and under this relax'd Insensibility to National Coherence the Remainder of the  Canaanites  whom Avarice not Mercy had too indiscretely spar'd took Arms against so visible a Weakness and succeeded frequently in their Revolts till they not only brought this factious People to the lowest Pitch of Infamy but taught the Nations that surrounded 'em to think of and to treat 'em with  Contempt  than which no State can possibly be curs'd with an unhappier or more dangerous Condition  The Progress of all This was naturalIt help'd 'em little that they still had Strength enough to have repuls'd their Enemies The  Feet  and  Arms  like Those in the Old Fable of  Menenius Agrippa  thought it hard that they should work to  feed  the  Stomach  and destroy'd themselves in not sustaining what they were  sustain'd by  While those proud  Hebrews  multiplied their Claims into lean  Independencies Exemptions  and  Immunities  they were pluck'd One by One away like the Hairs of  Sertorius  's  HorseTail  which if pull'd at  All together  had been found irradicableIt is in Bodies Politic the same as in a Body Natural In the Rapidity of some wild Race a Man perceives a gaping  Pit  before him what a Happiness in such a Case to have the Seat of Counsel and of Power the same He sees the Ruin in the Moment that he shuns it in for Reason and Authority concurring in the Head put present Stop to the retracted Members and they stand  secur'd  upon the very Verge of their Precipitation But could we here suppose our Limbs stuck over with fine  Mouths  and  Eyes  like  Virgil  's Fame and the imaginary  Argus  and that every Mouth and Eye because it look'd a little like a  Face  would set up for a  Head  too and lay Claim to Privilege of Contradiction what Consequence could we expect to see from such a  Popular Balance  Clamour more than enough there could not fail to be to give  Alarm  to such a Body but the Monster's  Neck  would run the Hazard to be  broke  before each Member could be ask'd his Sentiment There could not well be fansied a more lively Emblem than when Reasoners for Monarchy compare a Commonwealth to That imaginary Serpent some old Writers dreamt of with seven Heads and but one Tail The turbulent Reptile would in spite of its big Hissing only  hang itself in every Hedge whereas with but one Head It would draw all its seven Tails  through  and find no Danger or Incumbrance  Sect L  How comes it He permits my Country's Shame  The leading Character in Epic Poetry must be distinguish'd not alone from other Characters of the same Poem but from other Poem's Heroes He is to be mark'd by some  Peculiar  of a noble Kind by which He would be  known  in every Company not only as a brave wise glorious Manbut as That very individual brave wise glorious ManWe are not satisfied by a too general Description even of a fine Woman but we listen with fullpointed Approbation when besides the Attributes She holds in Common with the other Beauties of her Sex we are brought closer to her Image by Communication of some one Peculiar Grace that teaches and  appropriates  HER separate Manner of  engaging  Then we form her to our Fancy and become acquainted with her Picture Thus in  Virgil  's Hero the Characteristic is  benevolent Piety  In  Homer  's It is  Fierceness  and in  Gideon Patriotism    Sect XIII L last  Will  Israel  's haughty Tribes be led  c  No Observation can be juster than is That of the Political Writers that  Authority is  POWER and  Reputation  is AUTHORITY The Nature of Things and Actions can be examin'd but by few their Appearance reaches  Many Machiavel  had Reason for his Observation that  the only Difficulty in Ascent to Greatness will be found at its Beginning  Never Man says he attain'd considerable Height from low Condition without infinite Fatigue and Danger from Opponents Repose a Milstone on the  very Border  of a Hill It there lies fix'd for ever if it wants the Impulse of some new  first Motion  Let That  Push  be given and not a  Rock  in its Descent will have the Strength to stop its Progress All That  Envy  which impels our Opposition when we cross the Way of some new  Riser  from the natural Stimulation of a Vanity that makes Comparison betwixt a Consciousness of our  own  Worth and  His  becomes extinguish'd in Amazement when we contemplate the  Hazards  of some terrible Reputation The Honours of a Man so dangerously rais'd we can no longer look upon with Malice we surrender 'em as but the  Perquisites  of the advent'rous Post he won 'em in and while Everybody  admires applauds expects  Resistance is discourag'd and falls in with Furtherance till now the Man whom All  believe  most capable  grows capable  in Consequence of that Admission  However equal therefore  Gideon  might in Nature have been form'd for Prosecution of his Purpose as to his unnoted and selfreap'd Advantages from Meditation Study Virtue Observation Courage or Experience It had been to disregard the common Course of Things had I made slight of those Restraints which heap up Mountains upon Mountains to raise  Bars  against  unaided Merit    I durst not under this Conviction dream his Virtue  rash  enough to have presum'd a Glory so unlikely and remote from his suppos'd Pretensions wanting Power Authority and Reputation till the GOD who had inspir'd him with adapted Qualities impell'd 'em also into Action by  Impression supernatural  or to take the Story in its literal Sense by the  Apppearance of an Angel  to encourage him  Sect XVI L  Be taught reply'd th' unbody'd Guest  c  Gideon  distrusted the Reality of so improbable a Charge tho' seemingly deriv'd from Heaven because the Vastness of its Depth was more than he could  sound  by the short Line of human Reason The Celestial Missionary discern'd this natural Struggle betwixt  Faith  and  Foresight  and removes it by a  Document  included in and made impressive by a MIRACLE  Reach me  said the Angel  yon neglected little Store of your last Night's Provision Gideon  in mere Respect to the Command complies with it in Doubt and Wonder at its Meaning and That Doubt and Wonder gave Occasion to the Angel to  enforce  the Credit of his Errand and exact the like implicit Reverence to it without bold Examinations of its human Probability I take the Liberty to look on This as the true Meaning of the Passage in the  Text  For certainly it could not be consistent with the Dignity of an Ambassador from God to order Meat and Broth to be pour'd out upon the Rock with that too trivial Purpose merely to  blow it up  that he might vanish in the Fire and leave  Gideon  in the SmokeWhereas ascending in the Flame after Delivery of so solemn and authoritative an Injunction must have answer'd fully the majestic View with which it seems to have been done and left the Doubter animated into a becoming Faith and Resolution  Sect XX L Oreb  a  Midian  Prince of warlike Fame    Too limited a Knowlege in Things military founded on a superficial Observation of the Pride and formulary Petulancies of  disputed Rank  and querulous Exceptions to or Emulations of  Detach'd Commands in modern War  will probably object against This Place that  Oreb  was a Person of  too high a Quality  to lead a  Party  out to lie in Ambush for Surprize of a small City But I recur to  antient  Practice and protest against defective TestimonyActions of most Renown were These Surprisals and light Ambushes  Ulysses  thus and  Diomede  go out disguis'd by Night as but  Discoverers  of the Enemy's Camp  Achilles  reproaches  Agamemnon  with his Backwardness upon Occasions of this Nature And we must not bring down  Gideon  's Days to  ours  and buckle Reason to Perversity of Will in faulty Adulation of Men's Pride and meaner Passions But to make a large Step from Antiquity which everywhere is crouded with Examples  Modern  Times have had their Proofs that noblest Spirits fly  above  these petty Loftinesses  Marshal Montluc  in his Commentaries prides himself upon  appearing personally at the Head of all such Enterprizes and ascribes his whole Good Fortune which was certainly the longest lasting and the happiest nay indeed the most unmatch'd and wonderful that ever was recorded to his resolute persisting in  This  single Practice the Duke of  Rohan  too in his military Work maintains with some Degree of Anger that it should be  question'd  that no General who is not prompt by his  own Presence  to promote the Execution of these little Services can ever bring his Soldiers either to That  Vigilance  or That  Opinion  of his Valour which are necessary to Authority And now of late in our own Times we saw good Proof of the Validity of That  French  General's Remark in the Successes of the  Earl of Peterborow  overrunning some of the best Provinces in  Spain  against the Opposition of an Army in Comparison with which  His own  might have been well mistaken for his  travelling Retinue  This illustrious Kind of Victory which Men obtain by inbred  Energy of Genius  is what  properly  deserves the Name of  Conquest  A Power of beating down one Force by an opposing Equal one can claim no other Title but of  Overthrow    Sect XXI L  Observ'd a tott'ring Cliff that loosely hung  Aristotle  is for the  Wonderful  in Poetry by which however I suppose he could not mean that we should disregard the  Probable  in Search of the  Miraculous  But if it must be look'd upon as reasonable that  Hector  in the Twelfth Book of  Homer  's  Iliad  could throw a Stone of Weight enough to burst the Gate of the  Greek's  Fortification before their Ships and throw it with such  Force  too as to break the Bars in Pieces and snap all the Iron Hinges which thund'ring Stroke had the Good Fortune to please  Tasso  so surprisingly that he made bold to borrow it for the Use of his  Rinaldo  against the Temple of  Jerusalem  if  This  I say can reasonably be believ'd it will be no great Difficulty for the Reader to allow it  likelier  that  Oreb  should push down a Cliff that hung half loose already Men who travel on the  Alpes  the Mountains of  Switzerland  or cross the  Pyrenees  or even among our own  Scotch  Alps or  Welsh  ones meet with nothing commoner than such huge Craggs broke off from upper Rocks and stop'd by some protuberating Point half over which they hang so loosely and so tott'ring that a very little Impulse from behind would serve to throw 'em downward tho' a Team or two of Oxen would have much ado to move 'em from a Place they lay on horizontally  Sect XXII L  Ignobly hurl their Jav'lins down in vain  This Weapon was a very antient one in Use among most Nations tho' 'tis now scarce known in  Europe  except only in the  Turkish  Part of it They call it there  Jeritt  and are extremely dext'rous in its Exercise The  Moors  too all through  Africa  retain the Use of it and so do the  Arabians  and some Nations of  East India  where it has the Name of  Zagai  The  Hebrew  Soldiers  and great Leaders kept 'em in their Hands by way of Ornament in Time of Peace  Saul  threw one of these Javelins at  Jonathan  while he sat at Table with him It was one of These that  Joab  thrust through  Absalom  They were brought early out of  Asia  into Use among the  Greeks  for we find few in  Homer  kill'd by any other Weapon Mr  Pope  translated unreflectingly in calling it a  Spear  What graceful Image can we form of  Hector brandishing two Spears  By Spear we are to understand a  Pike  Whereas the  Javelin  was but a short Staff for casting at a Distance The  Romans  call'd it  Pilum  and became so fond of it that they affected to be thought Inventors of its Use so much is certain that they met no Enemy who us'd this Weapon for what else can  Lucan  mean when in describing the  Pharsalian War  he tells us that  Piles threatened Piles  Had other Nations been  so  arm'd This might have been the Case in  any  of their Wars But since the Use was proper to the  Romans  to say  Javelins  against  Javelins  serv'd as strongly to express a  Civil  War as if he had said  Romans  against  Romans    The People of  Rome  could not have borrow'd it from  Greece  because we find in  Livy  that They us'd it before any Intercourse had yet been open'd with That Nation And beside the  Greeks  themselves had then disus'd the Javelin and been train'd to the  Egyptian  Practice of long  Pikes  of four and twenty Foot in Bodies which consisted of a Thousand in the Front and Sixteen Men in File sometimes reduc'd to only  Eight  in Depth the Ranks thereby extending to a double Length when they would shun the Danger of being charg'd in  Rear  by Enemies who might  outwing  them In this Order they compos'd a firm impenetrable and on plain Ground scarce resistible oblong Figure call'd a  Phalanx  where the Soldiers arm'd defensively with Helmets Tassets Corslets BrassBoots and Targets closing Ranks and propping and sustaining one another with their Pikes presented over the preceding Shoulders like the  Quills  of  Porcupines  'tis easy to imagine what Impression such a wellcompacted Weight was capable of making and how firmly It supported Charges from an Enemy unless where Ditches Hills or other Inequalities of Ground disturb'd and broke their Order into little Gaps or Intervals at which as in the Example of  Aemilius  against  Perses  at the Battle of  Pydna  the  Roman  Legionary  Maniples  forc'd Entrance and assaulting them in  Flank  with their short Swords gain'd frequent and considerable Victories  As to the  Pilum  'tis most probable the  Romans  had it with their  Trojan  Founders who no doubt brought into  Italy  All Weapons they had been accustom'd to before their Emigration  Vegetius  and  Polybius  Both describe this  Pilum  but a little  differently  As far as can be gather'd out of  Roman Tactics  It was a Staff of weighty Wood of four Foot long exclusive of the  Steel  one End of it was fasten'd into This Steel Head was triangular in Length two Foot and very sharply edg'd and pointed so that the whole Length of the Javelin was about  Six Foot  It was largest where remotest from the Iron though sometimes  they are describ'd as doubleheaded The poizing Place for Grasp was commonly about an Inch and a Quarter in Diameter  The Legionary Foot All carried this peculiar missile Weapon and could hurl it with surprising Aim and Force against an Enemy The Manner of their casting it was thusWhen the first Rank observ'd the Distance within Reach they threw their Javelins pointblank and sunk immediately upon one Knee to give the second Rank uninterrupted Sight who then threw also and knelt down to give the same Advantage to the  Third  And thus when  Ten  whole Ranks had thrown successively which was dispatch'd with an unceasing Swiftness and Agility They started up together with a general Shout drew All their Swords at once and so rush'd in upon the Enemy  What terrible Effects have been produc'd by Javelins we have innumerable Instances in History but none more worthy Notice than That Great one at  Pharsalia  where  Caesar  with his usual Skill foreseeing that  Pompey's Horse  compos'd of the most warm and fiery Spirits of the  Roman  Youth of the Patrician Houses would be endeavouring to fall in upon his Rear on That Wing where his own few Horsemen were exceedingly outreach'd by  Pompey  's He plac'd in oblique Line extending from behind the soexpos'd and threatened Flank of Cavalry six chosen Cohorts of his veteran  Foot  which made about Three thousand Men and order'd These when they receiv'd the Squadrons in their coming round upon 'em to aim All their Javelins  at the Faces only  of Those gay young Chargers It succeeded to his Wish The Horse came furiously  about  but starting unexpectedly on this Reserve of such experienc'd Wounders were receiv'd with so successive Showers of  Javelins  in their Eyes Cheeks Necks and Foreheads that unable to support the Horror of such maim'd and miserable Faces for the Horse had no  Vantbraces  to their Helmets they All turn'd their Backs precipitately and disordering their own  Foot  lost  Pompey  that important Day and gave the World to  Caesar    Sect L  Then  Gideon  found it prudent to retreat    There is no Chance and most especially in War which so effectually and suddenly destroys the Interests of Men as Want of due Discernment where to  stop  in the smooth Race of Fortune They see nothing but plain bowling Way before 'em and if they ever look  behind  it is not till their Rear is  broken in upon  There is an Eye on  every Side  of Prudence and she  sees  all round her  Gideon  who had so lately gain'd the Outset of his Influence by the Valour he had shewn in the Dispute with  Oreb  was to make Advantage of the favourable Opportunity As he was Leader in this hot Pursuit and saw that he was follow'd by his Countrymen without Regard to Consequence He might have push'd the Enemy beyond the Hill and made considerable Slaughter as they pass'd the River But how  there  should so disorderly a Body have resisted on  plain  Ground the Reinforcements coming up to the Assistance of the flying  Enemy In calm Debate within Himself he found the Hope of added Glory from the Conquest overbalanc'd by a Certainty of  losing That already His  in case of Disappointment and Defeat in Hazard for it He determines therefore to retreat and guard the Safety of the People with him on whose Favour he was now to build for All the Promise of his future Fortune  Sect XXVII L  Th' assembled Elders o'er the City Gate  The frequent Devastations brought upon the  Jews  first by the Princes of the East then by the  Roman Emperors  and in All Ages since by the Resentment and Revenge of  Christian  Zeal for ever warm against them have so irrecoverably destroy'd their  Records  that excepting their Remains of Law and History preserv'd in the Old Testament there can be nothing more obscure than the Formalities in Civil Government observ'd by this unhappy People Their  Priests  who were the sole Repositories of their Learning Faith and Ceremonies have been cut off almost to a Man in general and commission'd Massacres and Opportunities which This produc'd gave Room for Forgeries and infinite Impertinence and superstitious Dreamings to their  Rabbins  and their  Talmudists  Nor have the  Christian  Writers to say Truth clear'd more from the Confusion than appears to have been added to it  Josephus  liv'd at the same Time with  Christ's Apostles  and is one of our best Guides in Searches of this Nature but besides that he is often not so  full  as might be wish'd his Countrymen had undergone so many  Changes  before then that  Ten  Tribes of the  Twelve  were utterly extirpated and the Government and Customs of the other  Two  so different in many of their most considerable Circumstances from the Institutions left by  Moses  that for Matters of remote Antiquity we cannot safely rest on  his  Authority Thus much however may be gather'd from his Testimony and the  Hebrew Model  as remaining in the Bible that Each City had a  Senate  of her  Elders  that These were generally  Seven  with a  Levite  on each Hand for Exposition of their Law and to record as well as regulate Proceedings They sat exactly in the Form describ'd The  Place  above the City  Gate  to signify that Justice was to  guard  and  circumscribe  their Habitations These Senates of their Cities judg'd All Points of Right within their Districts but were under Check of an  Appeal  to  Capitals of Tribes  the Cause might there be heard again before the  Prince  of That particular Tribe who had Election also of his  City Senates  Lastly from these provincial Princes lay Appeal in final Termination to the  Sanhedrim  But till the general Defection alter'd the  Mosaic  Order Appeal lay from the  Sanhedrim  to the  HighPriest  and His Decision was the last and under Penalty of  Death  to be submitted toAll which shall be progressively made evident in Notes upon the Books to follow  Sect XXX L  Were sure design'd by Heav'n for wide Controul  The Accident that had so lately given Occasion of Applause on  Gideon  's Bravery returning with a  Royal  Prisoner and which had open'd to his Countrymen an unexpected Promise from his Virtues is the  Point of Sight  in his particular Case some  one  of which Men often are plac'd in by  Fortune  but whence if they have fit Discernment to make use of the Advantage they find All their future Way more easy They  dazle  by their sudden Splendor and prevent Inspection by Excess of Lustre Like Men who hold Darklanterns up before 'em they present a strong but undistinguishable  Glare  behind which They Themselves discern Things clearly through the Light which makes Those  blind  who  look against  them  Such a Light enlarg'd the Influence of  Gideon  's Virtues It is not from the Merit of the Truths he has been recommending that the Senators derive their Warmth of Admiration A Man to whom such Sentiments were natural would doubtless have express'd 'em many Times before when yet they had produc'd no such Effect in Favour of the Speaker But the Case is now grown different It is not to  Gideon  the Son of  Joash  their Fellow Citizen and old Acquaintance they have all this while been list'ning It is to  Gideon  made illustrious by Applause and Wonder of the People What had been common in the MAN was grown prodigious in the  Conqueror  and Words which were before thought only worth Neglect are found by this new Light to merit more than Admiration  Every Thing we have heard of Every Thing we admire will be found upon Reflection to have been the Gift of  Opportunity  Had not  Lucretia's Death  succeeded to her  Rape  or some equivalent Excitement rous'd the tillthen latent Indignation of the  Roman  People into Transport  Brutus  would still have been constrain'd to have  kept on  his Cloak of unexampled Dissimulation and the History of His Times had wanted one ferocious Instance that Disguise of Passions can consist with the most stern Inflexibility  In the same City the same Senate and same People who while under Hope or Fear from  Pompey  's Fortune gave Consent to all Indignities his Jealousy could heap on  Caesar  and who with a malignant Laziness suppos'd him in his Absence of no longer Consequence chang'd Disposition in a Moment and had now no Ear for any Thing but  CaesarCaesar  's Valour  Caesar  's Goodness  Caesar  's FortuneFor they saw All This by the  new Light  his unexpected March to  Rome  had lent 'em The terrible Success of so astonishing a Boldness taught 'em to consider as  invincible  a Courage that could meet such Danger with a steady Eye And That first daring Step drew Half the Nation from his Rival's Interest  Sect XXXI L  So wand'ring wide he reach'd the Grove of  Baal  Baal  was the  Sun  and  Ashtaroth  the  Moon  at least they were most generally so reputed But concerning these great Eastern Idols and the different Accounts in Writers of their Forms and Modes of Worship much more might be noted  than could be of Use or Pleasure hereIt will be All the Subject calls for to observe that they were generally plac'd on  Hills  with gloomy Groves surrounding them For they were worship'd in the open Air because it was suppos'd presumptuous to confine their  Gods  to Temples who were Omnipresent and illimitableTherefore when the  Hebrews  as they often did fell off to the Idolatry of their nextbord'ring Nations  They made them Images  says Scripture  and planted Groves about 'em and set up an Idol upon every high Hill and under every green Tree after the Abominations of the Kingdoms which were round about them    The Description of the Grove of  Baal  and of the  Image  was to be as full and circumstantial as it could be made first as it was a matter of Importance in the Story there having really been at  Ophra  such a Grove and Idol most of the Inhabitants and even  Gideon's Father  seeming to have been its Worshipers and secondly as there arose poetical Occasion for an Ornament from the Position Figure Grove and solemn Picture of the  Hill  which commonly was artificial many still remaining in some Parts of  Palestine    Sect XXXII L  Where can we better Virtue's Race begin  It is with a  prophetic  Spirit  Gideon  's Zeal transports him in this Place the sacred Text discovering that the Consequences of his cutting down the Grove of  Baal  became the Means of raising him to a Capacity of gathering into one collective Body That first military Strength to which he ow'd his own succeeding Triumphs and his Country's double Rescue from the  Arms  and  Idols  of their Enemy  Sect XXXIII L  Enough for Them that 'tis by  GIDEON  meant    From the Aid he here receives from the  Ten Slaves  whom he had taken in the Cave and saved their Lives when sentenc'd by the Senate there arises seasonable Opportunity to speak a Word or two concerning  Episodes  in general They never must deserve the Name which  Horace  gives the independent Parts of some of his Cotemporary's Pieces they are instead of the DISJECTI  membra Poetae  to be found  attach'd  as well as beautiful To heap together a wild Store of Incidents unlook'd for and surprising will require but the Assistance of a lively  Fancy  To chuse  which  is fit which not This is a Business for the  Judgment  There was some time since a  Sheep  with a fine  Topknot  on its Head There was a little after an  Hungarian Girl  who had a Sister  growing  to her  Back  Both These were Objects  unexpected  and  surprising  but they were however  Monsters  and offensively  unnatural  They were like the Poems of  Ariosto  and I wish I could not add some Passages in our Great  Spencer  's into which a fairy Dance of incoherent light Adventures of the most  Romantic  Model possibleif we except the  Tales  in the  Arabian Night's  unmatchable Extravaganciescrouded on and wedg'd themselves without Connection Cause or Consequence All loose and  separate in their Natures and yet ramm'd together by the Impulse of the Poet's Spirit In reading such a Poem I imagine it like looking down upon a  Sea  where long Successions of huge Surges after Surges foaming from all Quarters without Point of View to rest upon move  Horror  tho' at the same time they strike with a wild Kind of Wonder something  like  Delight The Whole amuses the Attention nothing leads it in particular A regular  Epic  Poet draws along the Mind as  Rivers  do the Sight however strong the Current and the Course tho' vast and winding yet the Flow itself is orderly the Force confin'd within its Banks and if it takes in  Episodical  Brooks it is to  deepen  not  divide  its Chanel  Should therefore this Deliverance of the  Slaves  have purpos'd nothing further than to set off  Gideon  and display his Generosity the Contrivance had been flat and wanted the Characteristic of an  Epic Episode  For while it could not be discern'd that It had any Influence toward Advance of the main Action the Reader would have thought their History too inconsiderable to atone for the Digression they misled him into But the Interest of these honest Men becomes intitled to our whole Attention and Concern as soon as we observe that from their Gratitude an Action is deriv'd that gives Foundation to the great one purpos'd by the Poem and reflect that no Men less oblig'd could have been drawn to a Participation in so menacing a Danger  It is probable in actual Truth that These ten Servants who the Text says aided  Gideon  in the Night for Fear of the Inhabitants of  Ophra  and the Rest of their own Family were Persons whom He had engag'd to his particular Interest by Effect of some uncommon Obligation It being impossible they should not have  foreseen  the Uproar and Resentment which attended their Presumption and no Ordinary Temptation had prevail'd on Men of Their expos'd Condition to provoke so visible a Hazard  It is the same again in That  next Episode  where the Defeat of  Oreb  's  Party  and His being made a  Prisoner  was not introduc'd to give a Proof of  Gideon's Bravery  but from Effect of its Exertion to possess him of the Public Admiration I repeat the Observation tho' already noted to imprint Remembrance of this not to be dispens'd with Requisite in  Episodes  that they  produce  and make Each other  necessary  and contribute All to the  Completion  of the  Epic Action    Sect XXXV L and  On the hissing Flame  Pour'd the warm Blood  I purposely  abridge  the ceremonial Rites of  Sacrifice  not only as the formal  Apparatus  for and Practice in 'em All  BurntOfferings PeaceOfferings SinOfferings  and the Rest may be particularly found in the  Mosaic Writings  but as  Gideon  in so unforeseen a Call to the Occasion could not be expected to have come prepar'd for the Formalities nor was he vested for it with the Right of  Priesthood  and He knew sufficiently by the Direction he proceeded under that His  Offering  could need no Punctuality to render it acceptable  But over and above All This there cannot be denied to rise offensive Images from a too long Detail of Cutting up of Beasts washing their Bowels broiling the Fat and such  carnific  Circumstances I consent with all my Heart to  Lord Roscommon  's Notion of this Matter  "For who without a  Qualm  has ever look'd  "On holy  Garbage  though by  Homer  cook'd  "Take foul Descriptions in which Light you will  "If  Like  they nauseate if  unlike  they're  ill    Sect XXXVII L    From the tough Trunk's big Bulk backbounding Blows recoil  I hope I need not apprehend this Line in Danger to be look'd upon as guilty of more  Roughness  than It very well can justify from what was touch'd in a preceding Note concerning the Assimilation of the  Sound  to the describ'd  Idea  But as the hard  Rebound  is owing here to the selected  Monosyllables  I ought to add in their Defence that us'd with any Choice or Care they are a Beauty and Advantage and both  tune  our Language and  enrich  it I will wish no plainer Proof  in Favour of  than Mr  Pope  has brought  against  them  And ten low Words oft creep in one dull Line  By the Way creep THROUGH had better answer'd his Intention than  creep  IN But if it had not been for our abundant Choice of Monosyllable Words how then could Mr  Pope  have  imitated  with so beautiful a Force the very Fault he was exposing The Truth is It is not a long String of such short Words that makes Verse  jar  upon the EarShort Syllables when they are  Words  may by judicious Intermixture of the  Vowels  with the Consonants succeed Each other with as smooth a Cadence as can Syllables which are but  Parts  of WordsThe studied Roughness in this Verse of Mr  Pope  's arises only from a refluent Reluctance of its Accents to concur in That  Insertion  into one Another which is necessary to make Words harmonious I could shew a thousand Monosyllable Lines in Mr  Dryden  's and great Numbers too in Mr  Pope  's  own Poems  than which nothing can be capable of a more exquisite  Smoothness  It is easy to derive the same Proof even from Blank Verse and  Milton  where it seems least reasonable to suppose too nice a Care of  Softness  from  Selection  of his  Syllables  In  Eve  's Reproach of  Adam  for Example Paradise lost the Ninth Book  Why should be mean me ill or seek to harm  She speaks it of the  Devil  and the Author therefore will be scarce conceiv'd to have  endeavour'd  this  sweet  Flow of Monosyllables Verse compos'd so never  carries Roughness where due Care is taken that the Syllables are  heavily  or  lightly  ACCENTED in just Proportion to the Sense they move with But in Mr  Pope  's the Words are purposely so  chosen  that Each Syllable requires  Emphatical Expansion  and in That Case there can be no  Music  for the very Reason that makes Difference betwixt the  Tolling out one Bell  and ringing a whole  Belfry    I have omitted a short Note which ought to have been plac'd in the Beginning The Reader will observe I commonly make Choice of the Appellative  Hebrews  The Word  Israelite  is no more fit for Poetry than  Children of Israel  To have call'd 'em  Jews  had been a visible Absurdity since That was a  posterior  Name on their Reduction to Two Tribes and the exclusive Kingdom of  Judah  only The other Ten Tribes till their final Extirpation own'd no Name but their Original one of  Israel  Their general Appellative among the bordering Aliens seems to have been  Hebrews  which effectually includes 'em All and was deriv'd to 'em from  Heber  Sixth in Ascent from  Abraham  and Second from  Arphaxad Noah  's Grandson  GIDEON OR The PATRIOT BOOK II  I

stooping through a Postern Gate  Which from the Tow'r led winding down the Hill  Gideon  descending with eductive Skill  Steers his Companion 'twixt the mazy Rocks  And the deep Cleavings of the Hill unlocks  Dark'ning and cool beneath th'incumbent Shade  Of goatbrowz'd Bushes which in Sylvan State  Bow'd by their own declining Weight  Hung deep'ning o'er the ragged Cliffs and in the Breezes

Shade to Shade  Each lending Other heedful Aid  Till from the Glooms of their untrodden Way  As Men from Night wake sudden into Day  They saw the silver Stream at Distance flow  And flash'd upon the op'ning Plain below  IX  Now on the Valley's Edge th'egressive Pair  Outstarting spy'd from far a dusty Cloud  Which wid'ning circled tow'rd 'em in the Air  And half conceal'd a wild and noisy Crowd  Through which the Ring of brazen Wheels was heard distinct and loud  When to the  River  unobserv'd they came  They found the  Charioteers  of  Oreb  there  Wat'ring their wanton Steeds with heedless Aim  Widedispers'd and loose they were  Thoughtless of Danger All and void of Care  The Prince beheld 'em with indignant Shame  His Pride felt Anguish and his Eyes shot Flame  Unwary Slaves he cry'dIs

ambush'd near  Wretches is yon strong Mountain held by  Friends  His People heard him with a glad Surprize  Mix'd in their Breasts the vary'd Passions rise  But Joy triumphant stifling Sense of Shame  A Storm of Shouts rose ceaseless to the Skies  Echoing the bord'ring Hills th'Alarm proclaim  And the wide Valley rings with  Oreb  's Name  X  High on an open Chariot's airy Seat  In State the Prince and  Gideon  onward ride  Reclosing swift th'outstarted Squadrons meet  And flow behind 'em like a following Tide  Pour'd from the Camp the mingled Nations roar  Sweeping tumultuous o'er the dusty Plain  Loose Horse and Foot in stretch'd Extent still length'ning more and more  In endless Chain of Triumph swell the Train  But when Both Swarms met mix'd upon the Green  And  Oreb  's highrais'd Chariot shone between  Should'ring the clam'rous Concourse gather'd round  And clogg'd his Progress and o'erwedg'd his Ground  Slow mov'd th'incumber'd Pomp through deaf'ning Noise  And the Prince

Congratulation too bow'd formal to the Ground  From Ev'ry Side at once the thund'ring Drum  Beat his hoarse Welcome while in shriller Sound  The Trumpet's soft and trembling Note flow'd undulating round  White on a smooth and gently rising Hill  Full in the Centre of the Camp was pitch'd  One crown'd Pavilion of unmatch'd Extent  Lin'd with an  azure  Field of Silk by  crimson  Groves enrich'd  Whence  gold  and  purple  Fruits in Clusters bent  Fed the charm'd Eye with feastful Ornament  Three Walls of circly  green  th'imperial Tent  Guarded at equal Distances invest  Wide round th'exterior Third lay far outspread  Smooth  Void  whose silent Range admits no vulgar Tread  For there th'associate  Monarch  's Feet the hallow'd Surface press'd  XII  Hither to Council while they bent their Way  In his right Hand Prince  Oreb Gideon  led  The graceful  Hebrew  march'd at Ease and gay  And from his Eyes a radiant Sweetness shed  Circled by Kings and taller by the Head  His native Majesty eclips'd their Pride  A Leopard's Skin the Paws together ty'd  Dreadfully gay was o'er his Shoulder spread  And to the Right slop'd pendent from his Side  A rich wideskirted Crimson Vest  O'erwrap'd with conscious Glow his manly Breast  Girt by a purple silverstudded Belt  In which his fated Sword at Freedom hung  While at each Step his Arm was gently swung  The lowpoiz'd Spear majestic seem'd to nod  And sway'd with threat'ning Grandeur as he trod  Cool o'er his fair and bloomenliven'd Face  A jetblack Plume wav'd slow with shadowy Grace  XIII  Now round the enter'd Umbrage

Grove of glitt'ring Spears rise round the dreadful Hill  From the Tentdoor a Chief his Jav'lin shook  And thrice distinctly sounded on his Shield  The watchful Guards the wellknown Signal took  And rung it downward through the wardress'd Field  Silenc'd the distant Soldiers sit and wait  Th' Event of All their Sov'reign's joint Debate  Gradual the floating Roar of War subsides  And sinking Clamour draws back All her Tides  Soft the sweet Trumpet's Echoes die away  And the yet murm'ring Drum unwilling sleeps  Through the still Air thinbody'd Whispers play  And voiceless o'er the

Unweary'd Veterans of fearless Heart  All deeply practis'd in War's bloodiest Art  Us'd to All Arms and try'd in ev'ry Part  These  Chariots  which upon their  Left  roll by  Obscur'd by Hills of Dust

Zalmunna  's Pow'r does All the King's excel  And what his Strength and what his Aim 'tis  Time  alone can tell  XXVII  But  This  Way now direct thy Eye  Where  Agag  on his silver Chariot rides  Shining far and seated high  Four milkwhite Coursers with hotpanting Sides  Vex'd to be curb'd and struggling with the Rein  Draw him disdainful o'er the smoaking Plain  This Prince is Lord of  Amalek  's wide State  His Seat is  Pharan  and his Empire great  Arabia  's midmost rocky Tract He sways  Peopled by one of  Ishmael  's wand'ring Stems  Call'd  Hagareens  from  Hagar Abra'm's Maid    The swarthy Mother of this rugged Race  Northward his Lands the windmov'd  Desart  hems  Where wandring  Hords  in  shifting Cities  dwell  Safe from the Sun beneath their  canvas Shade    Thence swift as  Roes  the Savage Wilds invade  To hunt the lordly  Lion  from his Cell  Three thousand Horse This crafty Monarch guides  Each a skill'd  Archer  who in rapid  Flight    Turns in his Seat and dext'rous as he  rides    Aims his Shaft  backward  with a dreadful Slight  And  flying  kills more surely than in  Fight    These in  two  dusky  Cornets  sweep along  Wings  to That  Centre  which between you see  Firmwedg'd with hardy  Foot  rang'd deep and strong  Four times Five thousand they are said to be  Abstemious Highlanders All rough of Soul  Patient of Toil but restive in Controul  XXVIII  Rash  Zebah  last brings up the gloomy  Rear    Impetuous as a Tempest arm'd with Hail  All Passions shake him in their Turns  but Fear  O'er his warm Hope no Danger can prevail  Mark with what martial Majesty he  treads  Arm'd with a Spear and looking fiercely round  Onfoot his Twenty thousand  Foot  he heads  And measures slowly the unheeded Ground  Four hundred noisy CHARIOTS  wing  this Band  And yonder boasting the same Chief's Command  Six thousand  Horsemen  loosely spread behind  Close  the gay  March  and with elated Mind  Lift their high Standards to the following Wind  Happy Arabia  's aromatic Plains  Stretch their sweet Bosoms where this Monarch reigns  There the rich Hills a  gummy  Harvest shed  And  Myrrh  and  Frankincense  the Groves o'erspread  Ev'n from their Beasts a musky Vapour flows  And the  Spicebreathing  Wind with am'rous Softness blows  From their broad Heaths  wild Thyme  and  Camomil    Their coarsest Air with breezy Fragrance fill  Physic's wide Want this  druggy  Tract supplies  Let the  sick Elephant  lie down to roll  From the crush'd Couch  balsamic Odours  rise  And the snuff'd Scent revives his savage Soul  XXIX  As when some sudden  News  alarms a State  Of threat'ning Consequence and full of Fear  All meaner Cares and Themes suspended wait  While  This alone  does worth Regard appear  But when by slow Degrees the Rumour  dies    And thoughtrecov'ring Crouds  expect  no more  Each to his proper Task his Care applies  And All is hush'd and languid as before  So while the Prince and  Gideon  heard the Noise  And saw the swarmy Legions passing by  No other Sound their hurry'd Ear employs  No other Object fills their busy Eye  But now the Army past the Sound scarce heard  And each chang'd Prospect roll'd in Dust away  Pleas'd they observe the Plains about 'em clear'd  The chearful Birds above their Chariot play  And Nature smiling round 'em  stilly  gay  Then  Oreb  rising from his ChariotSeat  Beck'ning gave Sign to a wellmounted Band  Which shadow'd by a Grove's serene Retreat  At Distance waited their lov'd Chief's Command  Sudden they move and closing in behind  The Prince reseated shakes the loosen'd Rein  Fleet his Horses as the Wind  With sounding Hoofs fly rapid o'er the Plain  XXX  While to the guarded Mountain's barr'd Ascent  Their eyedirected Way they bent  To  Gideon  thus the gen'rous  Oreb  spoke  Since my illustrious Friend declines to take  Such due Returns as grateful Sense would make  And merits  Honour  but for  Virtue  's Sake  What shall I do to shew him my Regard  Of Greatness I confess  above  Reward  It must be left to Time and Chance to find  Some  vast Occasion  for my Thanks design'd  Till when the Debt must rest unpaid to load my struggling Mind  Mean while and there he from his Finger drew  A  Ring  that glitter'd with a dazling Ray  From the most radiant  Gem  that ere in orient Quarries grew  Wear Thisin Mem'ry but of what I  owe    And that I  mean  to  pay    XXXI  Gideon  longpress'd at last averse gave Way  And smil'd with thankful Grace when hid below  On the Hill's Side appear'd a  Hebrew Band  Which by the late Attempt instructed well  Under a wary Chief's Command  Took Place the Night before to watch what pass'd  And future Mischief in th'Advance repel  These  Gideon  saw and from the Chariot stept  Swift after him Prince  Oreb  leapt  And with a zealous Warmth of Heart embrac'd  Then courteous took his Leave and all in Haste  Remounting turn'd his Horses tow'rd the  Host  And reach'd it soon and foremost shone conspicuous in his Post  GIDEON OR The PATRIOT BOOK III  I  WHILE to the Host his Way Prince  Oreb  bent  And urg'd his flying Coursers o'er the Plain  Gideon  climb'd slow the Mountain's steep Ascent  Oppress'd with Thought and anxious for th'  Event    Deep he revolv'd with soulafflicting Pain  What strange Success had crown'd his first Intent  Crown'd with Success  in vain    Should the chief Labour of his Hope imperfect still remain  The Foe remov'd might soon receive Alarm  And doubly fierce  return  should  Israel arm    Well had he mark'd and weigh'd their dreadful Skill  Their countless Numbers their rapacious Will  And All their fine and vary'd Arts to  kill    How should dejected  Israel  then make Head  Who  should effectual Summons spread  Or did they meet how hopeless still they would by HIM be  led  Much he reflected on the gen'rous Aid  Of  Oreb  's Friendship mixing Hope with Pain  For while ZALMUNNA's barb'rous  Pride  he weigh'd  ZEB's  Av'rice  AGAG's  Caution  ZEBAH's  Rage  Wisdom's cool Doubt awaken'd sad Presage  That One Man's Truth might leave Dependence  vain  Where fraudful Numbers  join'd  averse its Influence to restrain  Distracted thus amid the hurry'd Sway  Of crosscours'd Passions  clashingly  combin'd  Deeply perplex'd he climb'd his pensive Way  And now despairing human Schemes resign'd  Now thought of  Heav'n  and left all Doubt behind  II  But while in  Midian  's Camp his active Thought  Had wisely lab'ring trac'd his Country's Good  His Country's Sons by no such Virtue taught  With equal Ardour their own Bliss withstood  For 'mid th'o'ermantling Stillness of the Night  While  Gideon  late had hew'd the Grove's vast Oak  The Priest of  Baal  who on the Mountain's Side  Cavern'd in solitary Silence dwelt  Heard the loud Echoes bound from each bold Stroke  Which the Trunk repugnant felt  Saw the fierce Flame revolve its blazy Light  Whirl'd through the Gloom and trembling to his Sight  Scarce his astonish'd  Soul  believ'd  Th'alarming Witness which his  Senses  bore  Fearing yet longing to be undeceiv'd  Th'apparent Truth still nearer to explore  Cautious he climb'd the Hill with quiv'ring Knees  There safe behind the Shade of sheltry Trees  Chill'd with Amazement he had stood and watch'd  While  Gideon  and his faithful  Ten  their daring Task dispatch'd  III  But when the pious  Hebrew  left the Place  And silent Horror o'er the Ruin reign'd  Soft the Priest with tim'rous Pace  Crept from his Covert now no more restrain'd  And ghastly gazing o'er the naked Ground  On which the dying Embers faintly shin'd  View'd the accomplish'd Desolation round  There when no Remnant of his  God  he found  Soulfreezing Horror  ic'd  his coward Mind  Bath'd in the dewdrench'd Darkness of the Night  Trembling he stood unman'd with inward Dread  If an Owl scream'd he started into Fright  And shrunk from ev'ry sighing Wind that skimm'd his palsy'd Head  Slow the press'd Ground beneath him seem'd to  rise    Gradual a  Groan  broke mournful from below  Outroll'd a  dusky Form  that brush'd his Eyes  And gliding upward ceas'd not still to  grow  Huge as the  Oak  it rose from It appear'd  And its vast Reach unmeasurably rear'd  Deathlike It rais'd an Arm but half reveal'd  For ambient  Clouds  the  shadowy Dart  conceal'd  Two ghastly Meteors  lost  within its Head  With  emb'ry Glare  pal'd o'er its  spect'ry  Eyes  Sicklying the Sable with a bloodshot  Red    Whose glimm'ry Semblance in appearing  dies    Nothing distinct was seen yet each dark Part  Mov'd in convul sive  Writhe  and seem'd to  smart    IV  This was the  Guardian Daemon  of the Grove  Who 'gainst superior Pow'r too weakly strove  Forc'd from his Charge in tortur'd Shame withdrew  But now reproachful  vaunted  o'er the View    Wretch  too unmindful of my  Shrine  and  me  Why hast thou  suffer'd  this atrocious Deed  Trusting  Thy  Vigilance and Piety  Thee  my Grove's sacred Guardian I decreed  Myself from Care of my own Altar freed  But by thy Absence or Neglect  betray'd    Rising I find my holy Hill profan'd  Day  's influent Range supplants my fav'rite Shade  Burnt is my Image and my Honour stain'd  But  one  Way now canst thou Perdition  shun    And 'scape th'eternal Anguish of  my Hate  Detested  Gideon  this bold Act has done  Go while he dares  new Mischiefs  meditate  Go  rouse  the faithful Ministers of  Fate    Drag him expell'd from the  curs'd City  's Gate  Headlong go hurl him o'er the Mountain's Brow  So expiate  Ophra  's Guilt and save the State  From highdoom'd  Vengeance  that o'erhangs it now  This not perform'd presume no more to raise  Altars  or  Groves  to my insulted Praise  Unexpiated Sins move Heav'n in vain  Go act my Sentenceor my Rage sustain  V  So threat'ning mounted on a  Flash  he rose  And in a Peal of Thunder  tow'r'd  away  Kindling behind an Arch of Sulphur flows  And  streaks  his Passage with a  Trail  of  Day    Far from the Mount with gradual Slope he fell  And light'ning downward sought his native  Hell    Thus when in War the  deathembowell'd Ball  Slants upward o'er some hostile Mark to fall  In fiery Curve th'exploded Mischief flies  And sweeps thicksparkling through the measur'd Skies  Till on the destin'd Point its Weight declines  And bursting broad with flashful Force for circly Ruin shines  Who can describe the Pangs which now opprest  The panting Heathen's superstitious Breast  Aw'd and unsoul'd beneath th'unruly Fright  Still his Ears echo'd to the  Groans  of Night  Still the thin Phantom skimm'd before his Sight  Wildly devout and stung by frantic Zeal  Swift to the Remnant of the hallow'd Oak  Fearful  with wideextended Arms he ran  In pious Pity the mourn'd  Trunk  to  clasp    Weep its dry Wounds and warm 'em with his Grasp  So tir'd with Ecstasy and toil'd with Dread  While his agewasted Spirits flow'd away  Down sunk the sleepattracted Sage's Head  And senseless as his  Oak  supine he lay  VI  There while he slept unconscious what was done  High o'er his Weakness rose the smiling  Sun    When  Joash  mindful of the  Grove o'erthrown    Ent'ring the Town with wise and early Care  Anxious to make its  Motive  timely known  Found the sought  Senate  close assembled there  Of these  Eliakim  with fruitless Pain  Had long regretted  Israel left by  GOD  Long had he view'd her Rashness with Disdain  And trac'd  Destruction  in the Paths she trod  Yet taught by Pity to attemper Zeal  Patient he waited some adaptive Chance  That might contribute  Balm  her Wounds to heal  And her true Int'rest to his Hopes advance  He  lately busying many a trusty  Scribe    In secret Correspondence practis'd well  Had  one charg'd Levite  drawn from Ev'ry Tribe  Safely such Schemes to ponder and prescribe  As dang'rous  Distance  made it rash to  tell    Chiefly he wish'd more Weight in  Levi  's Scale  Conscious that  Freedom  must with  Faith  prevail  But little guess'd he 'midst his cool Design  How GOD on  Gideon  had vouchsaf'd to shine  Less dreamt He of the Idol Grove  destroy'd    Or what  new Wonders  his vast Views employ'd  Ev'n  now  deputed from the  sacred Race    Twelve aweful Delegates commission'd came  Men of high Wisdom and distinguish'd Grace  Propell'd by pulsive  Heav'n  beyond their  Aim    Now first in  Ophra  's  Senate  taking Place  They learnt from  Joash  what That Night was done  Learnt how an ANGEL had inspir'd  his Son    Baal  's  consecrated Altar  to destroy  Learnt with Astonishment too strong for Joy  That with commission'd Flame  His  shining Hand  Would rise his Country's blazing  Soul  and  free  th'illumin'd Land  VII  While they yet list'ning weigh'd th'alarming Tale  Th'  awaken'd Priest  with loud Complaint rush'd in  Roar'd the hot Wrath of  violated Baal    And urg'd due Vengeance on th'  alldamning Sin    The wise Assembly heard in dumb Disdain  Yet scarce contain'd the Warmth with which they glow'd  But now cool Caution they to Prudence ow'd  The People's Zeal they knew was fierce and  blind    Hence outward Marks of purer Fire restrain  Till Faith's rais'd Torch might  apt  Effulgence find  Grave  Joash  slowly rising from his Seat  Soft to th'impatient Priest this Answer made  No more thus  loud  thy boist'rous Prayer repeat  Heard were thy Words and shall be duly weigh'd  No Son of Mine I think has yet been known  Actor of any Deed he dar'd not own  Gideon  returning charge him to his Face  We  but  for  Justice  hold this aweful Place  VIII  'Tis as I fear'd  th'outrageous Voice reply'd  Guilt has its Judges  on its Side  And by th'Abettors of his Crime th'Offender must be try'd  O  Baal dread Pow'r  distinguish in thy Rage  Thou shouldst not canst not thus provok'd thy purchas'd Wrath  asswage  Let it but on thy  Foes  THESE FOES be bent  Nor with the Guilty strike the Innocent  Speaking he beats his quiv'ring Breast his priestly Vestments  rends  And madly frantic to the Streets with outstretch'd Arms descends  There on his Head the gather'd Dust he threw  And round him wide th'inquiring Rabble drew  To Ev'ry List'ner he repeats his Tale  Tells the God's Wrath and aggravates the Deed  Dwells on the dreadful  Apparition  seen  Varies his Accents and his Looks and trembles oft between  The frighted Multitude their Fate bewail  Howl to the Priest with  Baal  to intercede  And from his Vengeance Them and Theirs to screen  Loud and more loud the rising Tumult grew  At length All Ranks into Itself it drew  And roaring wild outswell'd Controul and Order overthrew  So into Towns besieg'd some stormy Night  A mischiefguided  Fireball  secret falls  It kindles first some Roof remote from Sight  Thence breaks augmented o'er the bord'ring Walls  Contiguous Houses  catch  th'infectious Flame  Which tow'ring upward meets the wafting  Wind  Then driv'n from Street to Street with hungry Aim  O'er the  whole Range  in blazing Sheets  inclin'd    Broad  Wasters  unresisted Passage find  Loud into gather'd Rage the mingled Fires  Combining curl to Heav'n with twisted Spires  United Help to  quench  now  vainly  aims  And crackling Ruin the wide Woe proclaims  IX  Alarm'd by frequent and increasing  Shouts    And terrify'd by Dread of vulgar Rage  The shock'd Assembly sat involv'd in Doubts  Measuring slow Means the Tumult to asswage  Till wise  Eliakim  reflecting well  That Popular Distaste to  soothing Arts    Remits  th'Intemp'rance of transported Hearts  Chose rather to  prevent  than to  repell    Down to the noisedistracted Streets he ran  Where by the gen'rous Love of Peace inspir'd  Feebly with faint Advance the Good old Man  Whelm'd in the Torrent of the Press began  To cool those Passions which the Priest had  fir'd    Oft in vain he strove to speak  Th'unlist'ning Rabble drown'd his Voice in  Roar  Tott'ring and push'd by Age and Anguish  weak    With stagg'ring Steps and Arms uprais'd he labour'd to implore  Sometimes the dumbly sullen Multitude  Aw'd by his Presence their wild Shouts  forbore  Then suddenly again grew loud and rude  And swell'd to stormier Madness than before  So on the angry ORIENT's  rais'd Degrees    Some Bark untimely trusts  repugnant  Seas  To the  black Whirlwind  shifts her heedful Helm  Careful to rise with ev'ry climbing Sweep  Which met transversely would her Side o'erwhelm  And plunge her found'ring in the foamy Deep  Now shocks her surgestruck  Stern  now shakes her  Head  There while she  stays  check'd motionless and dead  Loud o'er her  Quarter  roars with deaf'ning Sound  Some sidelong Blast that whirls her dreadful round  Now for awhile the slack'ning Wind gives way  And murm'ring Seas her answer'd Helm obey  Then all at once newwak'd again the mad'ning Tempests roar  Deluge aloft her cover'd Decks and wash her Topmasts o'er  So far'd  Eliakim  on ev'ry Side  Oppress'd and floated with the should'ring Tide  Now shortliv'd Silence listen'd to his Prayer  Now thick'ning Clamour storm'd his Ear and stunn'd him to Despair  X  Joash  who weigh'd his Int'rest in th'Event  Marks and  adopts Eliakim  's Distress  Following he seconds the good Seer's Intent  Fast after Him the rev'rend  Elders  press  And the  twelve Levites  All descend to try their joint Address  Aw'd by such strongcombin'd Authority  The Croud whom one Man's Influence fail'd to sway  Give back when they th'united  Congress  see  And falling off by slow Degrees melt murmuring away  But restless in his Idol's Cause to  fail    All Day  from House to House the Priest of  Baal    With lab'ring Malice  urg'd  the menac'd Fate  That lour'd incumbent o'er the guilty State  Paintive  he shap'd a thousand fansy'd Woes  Woes by their angry Deity resolv'd  Should they relax'd His  known  Command oppose  And in th'  Offence unpunish'd  fall involv'd  XI  Night  came and with a strong and sudden Blaze  The smother'd  Embers  into Contact fann'd  Furious broke out and shot rekindling Rays  That flash'd Destruction round on ev'ry Hand  Gath'ring with Swords and Clubs and Spears and Staves  Hoarse as a Sea the rising Rabble meets  With all its Tongues at once the Monster raves  And with the Roar of Rapine shakes the Streets  Like some  new Breach  too slightly stopt in Haste  And  pil'd  and  turf'd  to bar the watry Waste  At first effective the short Hope is try'd  The Bank triumphant checks th'assaulting Tide  But while with dimply Smile the Current glides  And edging on with treach'rous Smoothness slides  The sapping Moisture  mines  the Work  below    And trickling gradual  eats  and pierces slow  Then gath'ring  Strength  It flotes the soaky Mound  Loosens the Piles and heaves 'em from the Ground  And All the Bank gives Way at onceand all the Fields are  drown'd    XII  Eliakim  who judg'd the People's Rage  Would to the House of  Joash  drive their Aim  Found his precautious Hint no  vain  Presage  Thither  Baal  's  Priest  directs the kindled Flame  But near each  Portal  and the  Hall  of State  A faithful Guard in martial Order plac'd  Oft as the Rabble press'd withstood their Weight  Broke and repuls'd 'em and vindictive  chas'd    Oft thus dispers'd oft making Head again  In Ebbs and Flows of  Noise  the Night was spent  Varying from Hopes to Fears with pensive Pain  The Senate list'ning watch'd th' unsure Event  As Men wellhous'd in wintry Storms of Rain  Hear from  without  the show'ry Tempest  rise  Now in  calm Interval  the Wind blows  low    And soft and short Suspensions  hush  the Skies  Then the big Blasts and sluicy Drifts hoarse and impetuous grow  And the  strain'd Beams  in swelling Gales  groan conscious  from  below    The Morning came and cross'd the Senate's Hope  Which promis'd  Peace  with the returning Light  But Day restor'd restor'd the rebel  Scope    Of headstrong Range that had been curb'd by Night  For now grown bolder by their Number  seen    Fierce on the guarded  Hall  th'Assaulters press  The deeprang'd Soldiers firmly stretch'd  between    In warlike Posture each try'd  Pass  possess  Here had Contention drawn a crimson Flood  And civil Fury stain'd her Face with Blood  But mild  Eliakim  who coolly dar'd  Whose Heart at once was  cautious  and  prepar'd    From a high Gall'ry  fac'd  the raging Croud  Taught 'em by speechless  Signs  how Madness  err'd  Then gath'ring distant round they grew less loud  While the lov'd  Sage  thus charm'd the gaping Herd  XIII  AlasWhat Frenzy my misguided  Sons  Transports your honest but impatient Minds  Mistaking Zeal when It thus  blindly  runs  Never the Path to  Reason  finds  Furious Revenge toils hard for fruitless Ends  He must not cannot  fall  whom GOD defends  Oh be advis'd fear  Heav'n  not  Baal  my Friends  Curs'd as we are  but  for this  Idol Baal    Let not the Idol's  Priest  prevail  Now  ere Redemption's op'ning Path is trod  'Twere an  ill Time  t'offend a pard'ning GOD  Gideon  if  Him  These rash Resolves pursue  Not  uncommission'd  Sin's black Grove destroy'd  Great are the Wonders He was  born  to  do  Your Faith's Redeemer and your Freedom's too  Blast not the promis'd Blessing unenjoy'd  Nor  doubt  his Triumph since by  Heav'n  employ'd  Pensive of late beneath his Father's Oak  A  shining  ANGEL from the  op'ning Sky    Descending near him  God  's Great Purpose spoke  GOD SPOKEHear Heav'n's Decree proclaim'd from High  Israel  REQUIRES him and He  shall not die    XIV  He ceas'd to speak and the awesilenc'd Throng  Gaze on Each other with repentant Air  Some bow their Heads in conscious Shame Some gape with stupid  Stare  Some weep some pray but All for  Peace  declare  Baal  's  Priest  observ'd it disconcerted long  At last determin'd Craft's whole Force to try  Loud he broke out with a reproachful Eye    Is Baal grown pow'rless  since his Grove was  fell'd  Or by their  formless  fansy'd GOD  expell'd  That ye thus lightly  lose  your gen'rous Aim  And start and tremble at an  empty Name  Were  only Israel  's Natives bless'd with Eyes  Are All the mightier Nations round us  blind  Where dwells  this sad sole Sov'reign of the Skies  Whose  House  no People but the  Hebrews  find  Greater than  Baal  since he pretends to be  Why  fled  we from their Arms who  worship Baal  Sure Such a proud  unpartner'd  Pow'r as  He    Might lend his Vot'ries  Victory  If to inferior Gods you must not  bow    Let this Supreme one  save  you now  If boastful  Gideon  has an  Angel  seen  Ne'er let His Party  Baal  's  Resentment  fear  Since GOD's Arm stays him Who can  step between  Why flies he  Tumults  if his Call was clear  Follow  me  bravely We'll the Truth explore  If by our Hands he  falls  we cut short  Sin    And  Baal  shall frown no more  But if  His God  's Protection walls him in  And from doom'd Vengeance his curs'd Head  secures    Perish  even Baal  and  Gideon  's GOD be  yours  XV  He paus'd and the willwav'ring Multitude  Aw'd and hush'd but just before  Found their first Purpose suddenly renew'd  And burst assentive into savage  Roar    Thus o'er the blasted Heath where Storms have blown  The light thin  thistly  breathobeying  Down  Hangs on the Air a Plaything for the Wind  Moves to each Breeze and can  no Balance  find  Now softsustain'd  sinks  indolently  slow  Now  rises  rapid on the  Gale  and leaves the  Birds  below  Aptly the  Priest  in Choice of Season learn'd  The smiling Moment's op'ning  Dawn  discern'd  From the next Hand he snatch'd a glitt'ring  Spear  Haste to the Contest Each brave Soul said he  Gideon  and  Baal  dispute for  Israel  's  Fear    Whose Pow'r is greatest come resolv'd to see  Let  his  God fight for  Him  and  mine  for  me    XVI  So threat'ning to a PosternGate with Speed  He led the Way and after rush'd the Throng  That Gate he knew was watch'd with slacken'd Heed  For when of late the Croud swept thence along  With vow'd Resolve the Senate's Wall to force  Its Guard offcall'd to stem Distraction's Course  Swiftquitting That  Outpost  had march'd away  Prompt for Defence where likeliest Danger lay  By this new Chance surpris'd the Gate gave way  Through the wide Arch with throng'd and boist'rous Sway  Pours the mad Multitude in shouting Swarms  With horrid Faces wildly mix'd and ragecollected Arms  Fierce o'er the Mountain raves th'impatient Throng  And with the Rush of Ruin roars along  Sicilian Aetna  thus Eruption makes  When melted Sulphur swells her smoaky Lakes  Through the broad Mouth out burst the flaming Tides  And roll their blazy Torrents down her Sides  Rampant the fiery Streams unchanel'd flow  And scorching dreadful burn up Woods and  ride  the Plains below  XVII  Joash  who heard his House design'd for Prey  Thither protective wing'd his timely Way  There while with Vows and Pray'rs bestow'd in vain  He urg'd his Friends th  Approaches  to maintain  Gideon appear'd  returning from the Plain  To meet him trembling at his Sight the tender Father flies  Tells the near Dangerand with watry Eyes  Thus the safe Counsel of his Love applies  Go fated Youth return Thy Ruin shun  Never till now did I thy Presence  hate    Pity thy Father's Fears too  daring  Son  Nor to his Load of Woes add Thou the Weight  To make him Witness of Thy dreadful Fate  While he yet spoke the Noise grew  near  and  loud  And rising Dust proclaim'd th'arriving Croud  Gideon  observ'd it and with pious Care  Thus gen'rous interrupts his Father's Pray'r  Rev'rend and wise whose  Wishes  give me Laws  Fear  were  dishonest  in a Freeman's Cause  GOD tho' a weak and worthless Hand he chose  Forbids his Soldier to avoid his Foes  Let 'em come on They who in Numbers trust  Raise tow'ry Modelsbut they build with  Dust    He ceas'dbut  Joash  hopeless of Relief  Hung on his Neck with speechless Tears and  look'd  persuasive Grief  XVIII  Gideon  who held the Multitude in  View    Clos'd his sad Father's pale and trembling Hand  In his brave  Brother's  who  so charg'd  withdrew  Hous'd in safe Post to make defensive Stand  Then  fac'd  the Croud chose a conspicuous Place  And stood the great Protector of his Race  As when  Arabian Hunters  in full Cry  Run down the tim'rous  Stag  with preyful Eye  If turning short amid some winding Way  They start a  Lion  grimly couch'd for Prey  Sudden the Dogs shoot wide and cow'ring low  Creep trembling backward and their Chace forego  So the transported and tumultuous Throng  Hot in their Rage and rushing wild along  When unexpectedly they  Gideon  saw  Fell off confounded and oppress'd with Awe  GOD had impress'd him with a Stamp divine  And o'er his Features beam'd an aweful Shine  Back'ning they gaz'd at Distance on his Face  Admir'd his Posture and confess'd his Grace  His Right Hand grasp'd his planted Spear with nerv'd and manly Pride  His Left bent careless rested on his Side  Halffrown'd his Brow resentive Wrath to  feign    But his keen Eye smil'd cold with sharp Disdain  Sudden the  Priest  of  Baal  who stood most near  Felt his Joints loosen with resistless Fear  And  dropt insensibly  his useless Spear  The pitying Hero mark'd the Croud's Surprize  And slow disarm'd the Rigour of his Eyes  Yet with reproachful Air the Silence broke  And with high Voice and aweful Mien to the mix'd People spoke  XIX  Bloodthirsty Wasters of your Father's Fame  Haughty 'midst Woes and wanton ev'n in  Shame  Why stop you short Why  cools  your threat'ning Flame  Your  Souls  are worthy of your Aim  Baseness by  Nature  must all Danger  hate    Well add you therefore your whole coward Weight  To  crush  a Worth you  dare not imitate    Yet whence could all this Waste of Anger flow  Did it  to Baal profan'd  such Transport owe  Weak  is his Godhead if sustain'd by  You  Why does not  Baal  the  Foes of Baal  subdue  Omniscience sure like His th'Offender  knew  Why did He not  prevent  him too  Rash Foolsby blind and feeble Zeal  betray'd  Are Men their  God's Protectors  made  Shall  Baal  who could not  save Himself  find Pow'r to give  you Aid  Oh what a DIFF'RENT GOD your  Fathers  knew  No Help from  Earth  our  Great  JEHOVAH drew  From  His own Hand  His blastful Lightnings flew  The  dreadful Truth  when impiously deny'd  Proud  Corah Dathan  and  Abiram  try'd  Leagu'd against MOSESand misled like  you  While they  in Him  his GOD and Theirs defy'd  Deep in the swallowing Earth's wide Yawn o'erwhelm'd with Fire they dy'd  No  passive Baal  unprompt in his own Cause  Stood the dread  Founder  of your Laws  When warranting Success to  Joshua  's Arms  Ev'n at the  Horn  's unfear'd Alarms  Strong  Jericho  in trembling Horror  falls    And  Israel  enter'd her at Ease led o'er her  prostrate Walls    Was it  Baal  's Hand that baneful to your Foes  To timestretch'd Slaughter doom'd collected Force  Held back  twelve Hours th'impatient  Steeds of Night  And on the  Sun  's declining Track pour'd Floods of  length'ning Light  Ungrateful stubborn illdiscerning Men  Why are you  now  less blest than were your Fathers  then  Reigns  Amalek  more pow'rful in  your  Land  Than when you chas'd him o'er his  native Sand  But  four  of  Midian  's Kings remain our Foes  Five  against meek and ageworn  Moses  rose  Twelve thousand  Hebrews  Those five Kings  o'erthrew  These four base Diff'rence  twelve whole Tribes  pursue  Dream you that  Moab  's present Chiefs excell  That  Eglon  who by  Ehud  's  Poniard fell  Or will your  unman'd  Race in Bondage  wait    Till some brave WOMAN  rise  to save the State  Some  second Deb'rah  skilful to inspire  And warm our heartless Sex with  female Fire  Gosince you burn with such resistless Rage  Go in this Brav'ry and your  Foes  engage  Late when at hand their shadowy Legions lay  When on  yon Plain  with your best Plunder gay  Full in your  Sight  they shar'd your  Flocks  in Prey  And led your  Wives  and  Infants  Slaves away  Then  was a Time this  Fury  to display  But  you  for  warier  Charge reserv'd your Fire  To no such  dang'rous  Vict'ries  you  aspire  Basely secure from the proud Foe you  fly  And Those who would  efface  your  Shame  ingloriously defy  XX  He paus'dFor conscious Guilt with Terror mix'd  Oppress'd the aw'd and speechless Multitude  In murm'ring Wonder they had first been fix'd  But  silent Expectation  now ensu'd  When panting breathless 'twixt their Haste and Fear  The rev'rend  Elders  who pursu'd the Croud  Brought up the  sacred Twelve  These now drawn  near    Th'impressive Voice of  Gideon  sweetly loud  Wafted his charmful Music to their Ear  Then with impatient Rapture fir'd through the mov'd Throng they press'd  On the young Hero  laid  their  Hands  and his Great Purpose  bless'd  Loud Pray'rs and Praise to fav'ring Heav'n address'd  To Heav'n that reassum'd lost  Israel  's  Care    And shot bright Prospect through her dark Despair  XXI  Baal  's  Priest  by slow Degrees with straining Eyes  Wak'd into Reason and repell'd Surprize  Much his recov'ring Thought revolv'd the  Fright    That o'er his Soul rose cold at  Gideon  's Sight  Fain would he still conclude his Vision  true  Yet wonder'd then whence his  Confusion  grew  And why if  Baal inspir'd  his Breast he had not  arm'd  it too  Dim burnt His Zeal while check'd by conscious Awe  The rev'rend  Levite  's purer Flame he saw  His Taper form'd for gross and gloomy  Night    Absorb'd in  Day  's more pow'rful Shine lost half its trembling Light  At length exerting Force to speak his Doubt  Thus his faint Diffidence was murmur'd out  Much I applaud brave Youth your gen'rous Aim  Yet ah beware lest ardent Thirst of  Fame  Disguise  Ambition  with  Religion  's Name  Great was This GOD if what we hear from  you    And what was heard by our dead Fathers too  Be not far more  traditional  than  true    These  Wonders  Ages past  pretend  so  known    Why are they not to  us  poor Suff'rers shown  Ask  Baal  's  Believers  They  of Baal  unfold  Potent past Trophies pompously enroll'd  But one  new Proof  would more  convince  than  All  th'uncertain  old    He said and pleas'd Concurrence catch'd his Voice  The Croud th'Impression of his Doubt receive  Let  Gideon  's GOD they cry'd now  own  his Choice  Give us  one Miracle  and we  believe    XXII  Th'indignant Hero mark'd th'unfaithful Cry  But all unable to  comply    Pausingly thoughtful roll'd his angry Eye  Straitfrom a bushy Covert near behind  Rush'd a grim  Lion  furious after Prey  To rend some  Sheep  the hungry Beast design'd  From a fair Flock which there at Pasture lay  High o'er his Back his Tail turn'd upward wav'd  Rough and thorntangled hung his shaggy Main  His lank Sides pining  miss'd  the  Food  he crav'd  Red were his Eyes and sparkled on the Plain  He saw the Press and with discov'ring  Stare    Stood fix'd awhile in  savage Glare  Then with a  Roar  that shook the Mountain round  Sprung on and like a Tempest swept the Ground  This was a  Lion  that for many a Year  Had in the craggy Hill's dark Borders lain  And filling All the neighb'ring Towns with Fear  Was hunted oft in vain  By the swift Horsemen late encamp'd on  Jezreel  's grassy Plain  By frequent Danger taught to shun the  Vale    Where in Times past his Hunger had been fed  Hardpinching  heav'nsent  Want did now prevail  And led him searchful to the Mountain's Head  XXIII  The frighted Flock alarm'd together rise  And bleating helpless skip in Crouds away  Fierce in Pursuit the greedy Savage flies  And while amid the Multitude they for Protection stray  The Croud as much alarm'd as They  Roll o'er each other a promiscuous Prey  Close before  Gideon  's  Feet  with joyful Roar  The leaping Lion stretch'd his Paws and one poor Bleater  tore    Back stept the Hero and grasp'd hard his  Lance  And watch'd with lifted Arm his next Advance  Thou shalt not safe  return  said he that dar'st presume  thus near    In Spoil of Innocence to shake off Fear  Sudden he saw the Beast  in Act  to  rise  And swift as Thunder downward aim'd a Wound  Deep through the Monster's gaping Throat the  bury'd Weapon  flies  Vindictive Fires flash'd Lightning from his Eyes  Half an imperfect Roar its Passage found  And the  nail'd  Monster quiv'ring beat the Ground  XXIV  The ravish'd People their Applauses shout  And Every busy Tongue its Wonder told  To the dead Lion gath'ring  wide  about  Th'extended Monster they with Joy behold  Astonish'd at an Act so timely bold  Gideon  just then with glowing Foresight fir'd  Stoop'd by directive Heav'n inspir'd  And round him from the deathdisorder'd Ground  Gather'd a snowwhite  woolly  FLEECE the Lion's Paws had spread  Then freed his Spear from the retentive Wound  And wiping off th'  ensanguin'd Red    Wreath'd in a soft and milky Roll the Lance's shining Head  Approach ye stubborn Infidels said he  Ye who are  Lions  where  but Sheep  you see  And tim'rous  Sheep  where ye should  Lions  be  Once more  That  GOD who set your Fathers  free    Unworthy as you are will let yoa know  That  Israel  penitent may prosp'rous grow  XXV  This said in his Left Hand he took the Lance  And held it with its  woolly Crown  erect  Then rais'd his aweful Right with slow Advance  And bow'd his Rnee to Heav'n with deep Respect  Dumb the still Multitude attentive gaz'd  Hush'd expectant and amaz'd  While  Gideon  thus  invok'd  That GOD who his new Hope had rais'd  Thou sacred high unutterable Name  To whom lost  Israel  ow'd her antient Fame  From whose just Anger flows her present Shame  Pity thy devious People's harden'd Hearts  Grosly deceiv'd by  Hell  's too busy  Arts    Let some strong Influence  force  'em to believe  What their Soul sees not let their  Sense  conceive  If by thy Servant's weak and worthless Hand  Thou wilt  save Israel  and her Pow'r increase  Let  show'ry Rains  descend at Thy Command  And nothing DRY remain but this soft FLEECE  XXVI  Scarce the pow'rful Pray'r was spoke  When from the West a startling Thunder broke  Continuous and advancing still more strong  Gradual it roll'd its length'ning Burst along  Fast after it black gath'ring Clouds arise  And circling dusky sadden all the Skies  First a weak Wind with hollow Faintness  sings    And shakes soft Moisture from its  sleepy  Wings  Now the wet Breeze with more collected Force  Thickens its Breath and blows  direct  and  hoarse    Then the big Drops in drowning  Fierceness  fall  And  rushing Rains  come driving over All  Rebounding Torrents the hard Surface  dash  And smoaking Floods the darken'd Mountain wash  The People turn their Faces from the Show'r  And on their Backs feel the broad Cat'ract pour  Gideon  mean while upon the rising Ground  In a bright Ring the heav'ntaught Floods surround  On  Him  no straggling  Drop  presumes to fall  For o'er his  Fleece  a sunresembling  Ball  Rolls guardful round to  slope  the Show'r  away  And shows him glitt'ring in  abstracted Day  Behold ye unbelieving Souls he cry'd  See what a GOD you have defy'd  And learn from This  Who  fights henceforth on happy  Israel  's Side  The People shout to Heav'n their raging  Joys    And  Baal  's Priest trembling  sickens  at the Noise  XXVII  Once more  my GOD cry'd  Gideon  yet once more  Indulge the  vary'd Sign  their Doubts implore  Call off  these Rains unflote the delug'd Ground  And when All else is round me dry  wet  let the  Fleece  be found  Th'Almighty  heard  and swift as rapid Thought  Reverted Show'rs to Heav'n are caught  The beamy  Sun  again shoots  down  his Rays  And burns restor'd with a triumphant Blaze  The flaming Air ejects irradiate Heat  And crossflash'd Lightnings in descending meet  As when some sudden Whirlwind's circly Sweep  Drives the light Straws and lifts each scatt'ring Heap  Smoothing the Surface in its winding Way  So the keen Radiance curv'd and quiv'ring round  Mazy and wanton in its vary'd Play  Curls its flash'd Progress o'er the hissing Ground  And closeadhering to the steamy Soil  With its blue Tongues licks up the Flood and works with fiery Toil  The  Fleece  mean while which swelling Moisture fills  The raptur'd Croud behold with glowing Souls  From its soft Sides a  trickling Stream  distils  And down the Hill in a thin Current rolls  This when they saw they on their Faces fell  Struck with an  Awe  which Hope could scarce repell  They  felt  a painmix'd Joy they could not tell  But in joint Voice with gen'ral Ardor fir'd  Lead  us they cry'd Thou Chief by  Heav'n  inspir'd  Govern  our  State  for under  Thy  Command  Ophra  first blest shall bless th'awak'ning Land  Thus was the  People  's  Voice  the  Voice  of GOD  Gideon  smil'd graceful with assentive Nod  On to the  Town  said he Assembled there  These  rev'rend Sages  shall my Purpose  share    Aid  my Endeavours and  divide  my Care  XXVIII  Op'ning they  move  mid Triumph's wildest Noise  Ungovernably wanton in their Joys  Baal's Priest still foremost  leads the shouting Throng  Converted to the  other  best  Extreme  Leaping and turning as he pass'd along  The Praise of  Israel  's GOD was  now  his Theme  Next came the mix'd and swarming Multitude  With All their Tongues and All their Hands employ'd  Long Trains of Dust their peopled Path pursu'd  Then was a short respectful Space left  void    For the charm'd  Elders  two preceding two  'Mong'st  These  the good  Eliakim  o'erjoy'd  Oft turn'd the following Hero's  Face  with new Delight to  view  Arm'd with his  fleecy Spear  distinguish'd far  Gideon  adorn'd his happy  Father  's Side  Now burst o'erjoy'd from his domestic Bar  And fill'd with All a  Parent  's virtuous Pride  Near after  Gideon  the Twelve  Levites  came  Their Eyes on  Heav'n  in rev'rend  Wonder  bent  Their Souls contemplatively fir'd with GOD's decreed Intent  Last march'd the  Soldiers  rang'd in length'ning Band  These from the City had pursu'd the Throng  Hast'ning their menac'd Fury to  withstand    But charm'd now  hail  th'  Event  of purpos'd Wrong  Guard back their loudacknowleg'd  Lord  and martial mov'd along  XXIX  Ophra  regain'd to Council they ascend  Senate  and  Legates  share divided Place  Moony  they round their great  Deliv'rer  bend  Who fills the  Centre  with majestic Grace  Mild from his Eyes the radiant  Fire  to chase  A Smile of soft Humanity unbends his  placid  Face  As when by Night through some  still  Forest's Walks  A Swain from whom his fav'rite  Child  has  stray'd    'Twixt the dark Shrubs in  list'ning Silence  stalks  And joyful starts at ev'ry rustling Shade  Breathless turns short attentive to the  Wind    And hopes in ev'ry whistling Breeze an  Infant  's  Cry  to find  So tender and so  still  when  Gideon  spoke  Th'expecting Audience swallow'd Ev'ry Word  No breathing  Sigh  the solemn Silence broke  And scarce an airsuspended  Atom  stirr'd  XXX  Fathers of Israel  we have seen this Day  That if we  will  be bless'd we  may    GOD ever gracious has new Proof display'd  That Faith's Endeavour  cannot want  his Aid  Yet must not therefore Human Care be less  'Tis Ours to labour as 'tis His to  bless    Heav'n  but inspires us with a Will to  chuse    Reason  weighs Means and  Virtue  bids us use  Hail  venerable  Twelve  ye  Souls  of  Prayer  Rev'rend and holy as you are  Be it  your  Province  born  to claim That Care  To clear  Religion  's Stream from  idol Mud    And strike lost Brightness through her troubled Flood  My humbler Duty but prepares the Way  And bows th'awak'ning People to your Sway  Already to  my  Care They owe  That absent  Midian  seeks a  distant Foe    Should  Tyre  be  Hers  'tis for  our Safety  won  The  Rich  retains 'em and the  Poor  they  shun    Should they  miscarry  they  new Pow'rs  provoke  And Strength  divided  by less Strength is  broke    Zalmunna  Sov'reign of their haughty Host  Demands from Ev'ry Tribe one Chief dispatch'd  Envoys for  Israel  's Peace

And shine and prosper in th'Insulter's  Eye    Alliance  granted  we are free  deny'd    Be it  my  Task in  Arms  to check their Pride  But to wish'd  Peace  while All our Hopes are led  Wisely forearm'd your  martial  Influence try  And draw th'  array'd Allotments  to a Head  Known  tho' neglectful  These  can promptly  move  And our  old  Force of warlike  Order  prove  Nam'd and enroll'd Each comes when Summons goes  Rous'd by the fav'ring Absence of the Foes  These  to Conjunction  urge  on  Ophra  's  Hill    Send 'em  unexercis'd  the active  Will  Soon disciplines  Obedience  into

nigh  You  sacred  Seers  from Those four Districts sent  Remind your  Princes  that  our  first Alarms  Should they from  Tyre  call back the  Midian  Arms  Bring  through their Bosom  the revengeful  Foe  Thence must Their Safety from their  Courage  flow  That weigh'd Reflection wings their needful Speed  And since Tomorrow's Dawn may greet you  there    And heav'ncommission'd Wishes  soon  succeed  These  who shall find War's Every  Nerve  supply'd  From  Stores  my previous Care shall  here provide    Might with so swift Advance for  March  prepare  That on the  fifth  revolving Day  They may their Ensigns on these Hills display  Press  their Departure whose first Aid we need  For soon as  Midian  learns that  Israel arms    She may perhaps from  Tyre  's touch'd Wall  recede  To blast our Purpose with returning Swarms  Now rip'ning Harvest smiles on ev'ry Plain  To heap our Magazines with needful  Grain    Foes have 'tis true our ablest  Horse  destroy'd  But War's chief Strength is  Foot  not ill employ'd  Next  would my  Father  's Will indulge my Pray'r  He  to this Hope would lend his missive Care  He  first to OREB  Midian  's noblest King  Should bear precautious this credential  Ring    Say when His hospitable Eye your welcome Presence meets  Gideon  oblig'd the Royal Giver greets  Greets him with Claim of promis'd Friendship due  Say  Ophra  's
