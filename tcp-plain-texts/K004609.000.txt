 INCOGNITA  OR LOVE AND DUTY RECONCIL'D A NOVEL  By Mr CONGREVE  LONDON  Printed for  R Wellington  at the  Dolphin  and  Crown  in St  Paul  's Churchyard  ☞The Lovers Secretary Or The Adventures of  Lindamira  a Lady of Quality written with her own Hand to her Friend in the Country in Letters being a very entertaining History Price    TO THE Honoured and Worthily Esteem'd Mrs  Katharine Leveson  Madam  A Clear Wit sound Judgment and a Merciful Disposition are things so rarely united that it is almost inexcusable to entertain them with any  thing less excellent in its kind My knowledge of you were a sufficient Caution to me to avoid your Censure of this Trifle had I not as intire a knowledge of your Goodness Since I have drawn my Pen for a Rencounter I think it better to engage where though there be Skill enough to Disarm me there is too much Generosity to Wound for so shall I have the saving Reputation of an unsuccessful Courage if I cannot make it a drawn Battle But methinks the Comparison intimates something of a Defiance and savours of Arrogance  wherefore since I am Conscious to my self of a Fear which I cannot put off let me use the Policy of Cowards and lay this Novel unarm'd naked and shivering at your Feet so that if it should want Merit to challenge Protection yet as an Object of Charity it may move Compassion It has been some Diversion to me to Write it I wish it may prove such to you when you have an hour to throw away in Reading of it but this Satisfaction I have at least beforehand that in its greatest failings it may fly for Pardon to that Indulgence  which you owe to the weakness of your Friend a Title which I am proud you have thought me worthy of and which I think can alone be superiour to that  Your most humble and Obliged Servant CLEOPHII  THE PREFACE TO THE READER  Reader  SOME Authors are so fond of a Preface that they will write one though there be nothing more in it than an Apology for its self But to show thee that I am not one of those I will make no Apology for this but do tell thee that I think it necessary to be prefix'd to this Trifle to prevent thy overlooking some little pains which I have taken in the Composition of the following Story Romances are generally composed of the Constant Loves and invincible Courages of Hero's Heroins Kings and Queens Mortals of the first Rank and so forth where lofty Language miraculous Contingencies and impossible Performances elevate and surprize the Reader into a giddy Delight which leaves him  flat upon the Ground whenever he gives of and vexes him to think how he has suffer'd himself to be pleased and transported concern'd and afflicted at the several Passages which he has Read  viz  these Knights Success to their Damosels Mis  ortunes and such like when he is forced to be very well convinced that 'tis all a lye Novels are of a more familiar Nature Come near us and represent to us Intrigues in practice delight us with Accidents and odd Events but not such as are wholly unusual or unpresidented such which not being so distant from our Belief bring also the pleasure nearer us Romances give more of Wonder Novels more Delight And with reverence be it spoken and the Parallel kept at a due distance there is something of equality in the Proportion which they bear in reference to one another with that between Comedy and Tragedy but the  Drama  is the long extracted from Romance and History 'Tis the Midwife to Industry and brings forth alive the Conceptions of the Brain  Minerva  walks upon the Stage before us and we are more assured of the real presence of Wit when it is delivered  viva voce    Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem  Quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus quae  Ipse sibi tradit spectator  Horace  Since all Traditions must indisputably give place to the  Drama  and since there is no possibility of giving that life to the Writing or Repetition of a Story which it has in the Action I resolved in another beauty to imitate  Dramatick  Writing namely in the Design Contexture and Result of the Plot I have not observed it before in a Novel Some I have seen begin with an unexpected accident which has been the only surprizing part of the Story cause enough to make the Sequel look flat tedious and insipid for 'tis but reasonable the Reader should expect it not to rise at least to keep upon a level in the entertainment for so he may be kept on in hopes that at some time or other it may mend but the 'tother is such a balk to a Man 'tis carrying him up stairs to show him the Dining Room and after forcing him to make a Meal in the Kitchin This I have not only endeavoured to avoid but also have used a Method for the contrary purpose The design of the Novel is obvious after the first meeting of  Aurelian  and  Hippolito  with  Incognita  and  Leonora  and the difficulty is in bringing it to pass maugre all apparent obstacles within the compass of two Days How many probable Casualties intervene in opposition to the main Design  viz  of marrying two Couple so oddly engaged in an intricate Amour I leave the Reader at his leisure to consider As also whether every Obstacle does not in the progress of the Story act as subservient to that purpose which at first it seems to oppose  In a Comedy this would be called the Ʋnity of Action here it may pretend to no more than an Ʋnity of Contrivance The Scene is continued in  Florence  from the commencement of the Amour and the time from first to last is but three days If there be any thing more in particular resembling the Copy which I imitate as the Curious Reader will soon perceive I leave it to show it self being very well satisfy'd how much more proper it had been for him to have found out this himself than for me to prepossess him with an Opinion of something extraordinary in an Essay began and finished in the idler hours of a fortnight's time For I can only esteem it a laborious idleness which is Parent to so inconsiderable a Birth I have gratified the Bookseller in pretending an occasion for a Preface the other two Persons concern'd are the Reader and my self and if he be but pleased with what was produced for that end my satisfaction follows of Course since it will be proportion'd to his Approbation or Dislike  INCOGNITA  OR LOVE and DUTY RECONCIL'D  AƲRELIAN  was the only Son to a Principal Gentleman of  Florence  The Indulgence of his Father prompted and his Wealth enabled him to bestow a generous Education upon him whom he now began to look upon as the Type of himself an Impression he had made in the Gayety and Vigour of his Youth before the Rust of Age had debilitated and obscur'd the Splendour of the Original He was sensible That he ought not to be sparing in the Adornment of him if he had Resolution to beautifie his own Memory Indeed  Don Fabio  for so was the Old Gentleman call'd has been observ'd to have fix'd his Eyes upon  Aurelian  when much Company has been at Table and have wept through Earnestness of Intention if nothing hapned to divert the Object whether it were for regret at the Recollection  of his former self or for the Joy he conceiv'd in being as it were reviv'd in the Person of his Son I never took upon me to enquire but suppos'd it might be sometimes one and sometimes both together  Aurelian  at the Age of Eighteen Years wanted nothing but a Beard that the most accomplished  Cavalier  in  Florence  could pretend to He had been Educated from Twelve Years old at  Siena  where it seems his Father kept a Receiver having a large Income from the Rents of several Houses in that Town  Don Fabio  gave his Servant Orders That  Aurelian  should not be stinted in his Expenoes when he came up to Years of Discretion By which means he was enabled not only to keep Company with but also to confer many Obligations upon Strangers of Quality and Gentlemen who travelled from other Countries into  Italy  of which  Siena  never wanted store being a Town most delightfully situate upon a Noble Hill and very well suiting with Strangers at first by reason of the agreeableness and purity of the Air There also is the quaintness and delicacy of the  Italian  Tongue most likely to be learned there being many publick Professors of it in that place and indeed the very Vulgar of  Siena  do express themselves with an easiness and sweetness surprizing and even grateful to their Ears who understand not the Language  Here  Aurelian  contracted an acquaintance with Persons of Worth of several Countries  but among the rest an intimacy with a Gentleman of Quality of  Spain  and Nephew to the Archbishop of  Toledo  who had so wrought himself into the Affections of  Aurelian  thro' a Conformity of Temper an Equality in Years and something of resemblance in Feature and Proportion that he look'd upon him as his second self  Hippolito  on the other hand was not ungrateful in return of Friendship but thought himself either alone or in ill Company if  Aurelian  were absent But his Uncle having sent him to travel under the Conduct of a Governour and the two Years which limitted his stay at  Siena  being expired he was put in mind of his departure  His Friend grew melancholy at the News but considering that  Hippolito  had never seen  Florence  he easily prevailed with him to make his first Journey thither whither he would accompany him and perhaps prevail with his Father to do the like throughout his Travels  They accordingly set out but not being able easily to reach  Florence  the same Night they rested a League or two short at a  Villa  of the great Duke's called  Poggio Imperiale  where they were informed by some of his Highness's Servants That the Nuptials of  Donna Catharina  near Kinswoman to the great Duke and  Don Ferdinand de Rovori  were to be solemnized the next day and that extraordinary Preparations had been making for some time past to illustrate the Solemnity with Balls and Masques and other Divertisements  that a Tilting had been proclaim'd and to that purpose Scaffolds erected around the Spacious Court before the Church  Di Sancta Croce  where were usually seen all Cavalcades and Shews performed by Assemblies of the Young Nobility That all Mechanicks and Tradesmen were forbidden to work or expose any Goods to Sale for the space of three days during which time all Persons should be entertain'd at the Great Duke's Cost and publick Provision was to be made for the setting forth and furnishing a multitude of Tables with Entertainment for all Comers and Goers and several Houses appointed for that use in all Streets  This Account alarm'd the Spirits of our Young Travellers and they were overjoy'd at the prospect of Pleasures they foresaw  Aurelian  could not contain the satisfaction he conceiv'd in the welcome Fortune had prepar'd for his dear  Hippolito  In short they both Remembred so much of the pleasing Relation had been made them that they forgot to sleep and were up as soon as it was light pounding at poor Signior  Claudio  's Door so was  Hippolito  's Governour call'd to rouse him that no time might be lost till they were arriv'd at  Florence  where they would furnish themselves with Disguises and other Accoutrements necessary for the Prosecution of their Design of sharing in the publick Merriment the rather were they for going so early because  Aurelian  did not think fit to publish his being in the  Town for a time least his Father knowing of it might give some restraint to that loose they design'd themselves  Before Sun rise they entred  Florence  at  Porta Romana  attended only by two Servants the rest being le  t behind to avoid notice but alas they needed not to have used half that caution for early as it was the Streets were crowded with all sorts of People passing to and fro and every Man employ'd in something relating to the Diversions to come so that no notice was taken of any body a Marquess and his Train might have pass'd by as unregarded as a single Fachin or Cobler Not a Window in the Streets but echoed the tuning of a Lute or thrumming of a Gitarr For by the way the Inhabitants of  Florence  are strangely addicted to the love of Musick insomuch that scarce their Children can go before they can scratch some Instrument or other It was no unpleasing Spectacle to our Cavaliers who seeing they were not observ'd resolved to make Observations to behold the Diversity of Figures and Postu  es of many of these Musicians Here you should have an affected Vallet who Mimick'd the Behaviour of his Master leaning carelesly against the Window with his Head on one side in a languishing posture whining in a low mournful Voice some dismal Complaint while from his sympathizing  Theorbo  issued a Base no less doleful to the Hearers In Opposition to him was set up perhaps a  Cobler with a wretched Skeleton of a Gitarr battered and waxed together by his own Industry and who with three Strings out of Tune and his own tearing hoarse Voice would rack attention from the Neighbourhood to the great affliction of many more moderate Practitioners who no doubt were full as desirous to be heard By this time  Aurelian  's Servant had taken a Lodging and was returned to give his Master an Account of it The Cavaliers grown weary of that ridiculous Entertainment which was diverting at first sight retired whither the Lacquey conducted them who according to their Directions had sought out one of the most obscure Streets in the City All that day to the evening was spent in sending from one Brokers Shop to another to furnish them with Habits since they had not time to make any new  There was it happened but one to be got Rich enough to please our young Gentlemen so many were taken up upon this occasion While they were in Dispute and Complimenting one another  Aurelian  protesting that  Hippolito  should wear it and he on 'tother hand forswearing it as bitterly a Servant of  Hippolito  's came up and ended the Controversy telling them That he had met below with the  Vallet de Chambre  of a Gentlemen who was one of the greatest Gallants about the Town but was at this time in such a Condition he could not possibly be at the  Entertainment whereupon the Vallet had designed to dress himself up in his Master's Apparel and try his talent at Court which he hearing told him he would inform him how he might bestow the Habit for some time much more to his profit if not to his pleasure and so acquainted him with the occasion his Master had for it  Hippolito  sent for the Fellow up who was not so fond of his design as not to be bought off it but upon having his own demand granted for the use of it brought it it was very Rich and upon tryal as fit for  Hippolito  as if it had been made for him The Ceremony was preformed in the Morning in the great Dome with all Magnificence correspondent to the wealth of the great Duke and the esteem he had for the Noble Pair The next Morning was to be a Tilting and the same Night a Masquing Ball at Court To omit the Description of the universal Joy that had diffus'd it self through all the Conduits of Wine which convey'd it in large measures to the People and only relate those effects of it which concern our present Adventurers You must know that about the fall of the Evening and at that time when the  aequilibrium  of Day and Night for some time holds the Air in a gloomy suspence between an unwillingness to leave the light and a natural impulse into the Dominion of Darkness About this time our Hero's shall I say sally'd or slunk out of their Lodgings and steer'd toward the great Palace whither  before they were arriv'd such a prodigious number of Torches were on fire that the day by help of these Auxiliary Forces seem'd to continue its Dominion the Owls and Bats apprehending their mistake in counting the Hours retir'd again to a convenient darkness for Madam Night was no more to be seen than she was to be heard and the Chymists were of Opinion That her fuliginous Damps rarefy'd by the abundance of Flame were evaporated  Now the Reader I suppose to be upon Thorns at this and the like impertinent Digressions but let him alone and he'll come to himself at which time I think fit to acquaint him that when I digress I am at that time writing to please my self when I continue the Thread of the Story I write to please him supposing him a reasonable Man I conclude him satisfied to allow me this liberty and so I proceed  If our Cavaliers were dazled at the splendour they beheld without doors what surprize think you must they be in when entering the Palace they found even the lights there to be but so many soils to the bright eyes that flash'd upon 'em at every turn  A more glorious Troop no occasion ever assembled all the fair of  Florence  with the most accomp  i  hed Cavaliers were present and however Nature had been partial in bestowing on some better Faces than others Art was alike indulgent to all and industriously  supplyed those Defects she had left giving some Addition also to her greatest Excellencies Every Body appear'd well shap'd as it is to be supposed none who were conscious to themselves of any visible Deformity would presume to come thither Their Apparel was equally glorious though each differing in fancy In short our Strangers were so well bred as to conclude from these apparent Perfections that there was not a Masque which did not at least hide the Face of a Cherubim Perhaps the Ladies were not behind hand in return of a favourable Opinion of them for they were both well dress'd and had something inexpressibly pleasing in their Air and Mein different from other People and indeed differing from one another They fancy'd that while they stood together they were more particularly taken notice of than any in the Room and being unwilling to be taken for Strangers which they thought they were by reason of some whispering they observed near them They agreed upon an hour of meeting after the company should be broke up and so separately mingled with the thickest of the Assembly  Aurelian  had fixed his eye upon a Lady whom he had observ'd to have been a considerable time in close whisper with another Woman he expected with great impatience the result of that private Conference that he might have an opportunity of engaging the Lady whose Person was so agreeable to him At last he perceived they were broke off and the 'tother  Lady seem'd to have taken her leave He had taken no small Pains in the mean time to put himself in a posture to accost the Lady which no doubt he had happily performed had he not been interrupted but scarce had he acquitted himself of a preliminary bow and which I have heard him say was the lowest that ever he made and had just opened his Lips to deliver himself of a small Complement which nevertheless he was very big with when he unluckily miscarried by the interposal of the same Lady whose departure not long before he had so zealously pray'd for but as Providence would have it there was only some very small matter forgot which was recover'd in a short whisper The Coast being again cleared he took heart and bore up and striking sail repeated his Ceremony to the Lady who having obligingly returned it he accosted her in these or the like words  'If I do not usurp a priviledge reserved for some one more happy in your acquaintance may I presume Madam to entreat for a while the favour of your Conversation at least till the arrival of whom you expect provided you are not tired of me before for then upon the least intimation of uneasiness I will not fail of doing my self the violence to withdraw for your release  The Lady made him answer she did not expect any Body by which he might imagine her Conversation not of value to be bespoke and  to afford it him were but farther to convince him to her own cost He reply'd  'She had already said enough to convince him of something he heartily wish'd might not be to his cost in the end  She pretended not to understand him but told him  'If he already found himself grieved with her Conversation he would have sufficient Reason to repent the rashness of his first Demand before they had ended for that now she intended to hold Discourse with him on purpose to punish his unadvisedness in presuming upon a Person whose dress and mien might not may be be disagreeable to have wit I must confess reply'd  Aurelian  my self guilty of a Presumption and willingly submit to the Punishment you intend and though it be an aggravation of a Crime to persevere in its justification yet I cannot help defending an Opinion in which now I am more confirm'd that probable conjectures may be made of the Ingenious Disposition of the Mind from the fancy and choice of Apparel The humour I grant ye said the Lady or constitution of the Person whether melancholick or brisk but I should hardly pass my censure upon so slight an indication of Wit for there is your brisk Fool as well as your brisk Man of Sense and so of the Melancholick I confess 'tis possible a Fool may reveal himself by his Dress in wearing something extravagantly singular and ridiculous or in preposterous suiting of  Colours but a decency of Habit which is all that Men of best Sense pretend to may be acquired by custom and example without putting the Person to a superfluous expence of wit for the contrivance and though there should be occasion for it few are so unfortunate in their Relations and Acquaintance not to have some Friend capable of giving them advice if they are not too ignorantly conceited to ask it  Aurelian  was so pleased with the easiness and smartness of her Expostulation that he forgot to make a reply when she seem'd to expect it but being a Woman of a quick Apprehension and justly sensible of her own Perfections she soon perceived he did not grudge his attention However she had a Mind to put it upon him to turn the discourse so went on upon the same Subject  'Signior said she I have been looking round me and by your Maxim I cannot discover one Fool in the Company for they are all well drest This was spoken with an Air of Rallery that awakened the Cavalier who immediately made answer 'Tis true Madam we see there may be as much varietyof good fancies as of faces yet there may be many of both kinds borrowed and adulterate if inquired into and as you were pleased to observe the invention may be Foreign to the Person who puts it in practice and as good an Opinion as I have of an agreeable Dress I should be loath to answer for the wit of all about us I believe  you says the Lady and hope you are convinced of your error since you must allow it impossible to tell who of all this Assembly did or did not make choice of their own Apparel Not all said  Aurelian  there is an ungainess in some which betrays them Look ye there says he pointing to a Lady who stood playing with the Tassels of her Girdle I dare answer for that Lady though she be very well dress'd 'tis more than she knows His fair unknown could not forbear laughing at his particular distinction and freely told him he had indeed light upon one who knew as little as any body in the Room her self excepted Ah Madam reply'd  Aurelian  you know every thing in the World but your own Perfections and you only know not those because 'tis the top of Perfection not to know them How reply'd the Lady I thought it had been the extremity of knowledge to know ones self  Aurelian  had a little overstrain'd himself in that Complement and I am of Opinion would have been puzzl'd to have brought himself off readily but by good fortune the Musick came into the Room and gave him an opportunity to seem to decline an answer because the Company prepared to Dance he only told her he was too mean a Conquest for her Wit who was already a Slave to the Charms of her Person She thanked him for his Complement and briskly told him she ought to have made  him a return in praise of his Wit but she hoped he was a Man more happy than to be dissatisfy'd with any of his own Endowments and if it were so that he had not a just Opinion of himself she knew her self incapable of saying any thing to beget one  Aurelian  did not know well what to make of this last reply for he always abhor'd any thing that was conceited with which this seem'd to reproach him But however modest he had been heretofore in his own thoughts yet never was he so distrustful of his good behaviour as now being rally'd so by a Person whom he took to be of judgment Yet he resolved to take no notice but with an Air unconcerned and full of good humour entreated her to Dance with him She promised him to Dance with no body else nor I believe had she inclination for notwithstanding her tartness she was upon equal terms with him as to the liking of each others Person and Humour and only gave those little hints to try his Temper there being certainly no greater sign of folly and ill breeding than to grow serious and concerned at any thing spoken in rallery For his part he was strangely and insensibly fallen in love with her Shape Wit and Air which together with a white Hand he had seen perhaps not accidentally were enough to have subdued a more stubborn Heart than ever he was master of and for her Face which he had not seen he bestowed upon her the best his Imagination could furnish him with I  should by right now describe her Dress which was extreamly agreeable and rich but 'tis possible I might err in some material Pin or other in the sticking of which may be the whole grace of the Drapery depended Well they danced several times together and no less to the satisfaction of the whole Company than of themselves for at the end of each Dance some publick not of Applause or other was given to the graceful Couple  Aurelian  was amaz'd that among all that danced or stood in view he could not see  Hippolito  but concluding that he had met with some pleasing Conversation and was withdrawn to some retired part of the Room he forbore his search till the mirth of that Night should be over and the Company ready to break up where we will leave him for a while to see what became of his adventurous Friend  Hippolito  a little after he had parted with  Aurelian  was got among a knot of Ladies and Cavaliers who were looking upon a large Gold Cup set with Jewels in which his Royal Highness had drank to the Prosperity of the new married Couple at Dinner and which afterward he presented to his Cousin  Donna Catharina  He among the rest was very intent admiring the richness workmanship and beauty of the Cup when a Lady came behind him and pulling him by the Elbow made a sign she would speak with him  Hippolito  who knew himself an utter Stranger to  Florence  and every body in it immediately guessed  she had mistaken him for her acquaintance as indeed it happened however he resolved not to discover himself till he should be assured of it having followed her into a set Window remote from Company she address'd her self to him in this manner  Signior  Don Lorenzo  said she I am overjoy'd to see you are so speedily recovered of your Wounds which by report were much more dangerous than to have suffered your coming abroad so soon but I must accuse you of great indiscretion in appearing in a Habit which so many must needs remember you to have worn upon the like occasion not long ago I mean at the Marriage of  Don Cynthio  with your Sister  Atalanta  I do assure you you were known by it both to  Juliana  and my self who was so far concerned for you as to desire me to tell you that her Brother  Don Fabritio  who saw you when you came in with another Gentleman had eyed you very narrowly and is since gone out of the Room she knows not upon what design however she would have you for your own sake be advised and circumspect when you depart this place lest you should be set upon unawares you know the hatred  Don Fabritio  has born you ever since you had the fortune to kill his Kinsman in a Duel Here she paused as if expecting his reply but  Hippolito  was so confounded that he stood mute and contemplating the hazard he had ignorantly brought himself into forgot his design of informing the Lady of her  mistake  She finding he made her no Answer went on  'I perceive continued she you are in some surprize at what I have related and may be are doubtful of the Truth but I thought you had been better acquainted with your Cousin  Leonora  's Voice than to have forgot it so soon Yet in Complaisance to your ill Memory I will put you past doubt by shewing you my Face  with that she pulled off her Mask and discovered to  Hippolito  now more amaz'd than ever the most Angelick Face that he had ever beheld He was just about to have made her some answer when clapping on her Mask again without giving him time she happily for him pursu'd her Discourse For 'tis odds but he had made some discovery of himself in the surprize he was in Having taken him familiarly by the Hand now she had made her self known to him  'Cousin  Lorenzo  added she you may perhaps have taken it unkindly that during the time of your Indisposition by reason of your Wounds I have not been to visit you I do assure you it was not for want of any Inclination I had both to see and serve you to my power but you are well acquainted with the Severity of my Father whom you know how lately you have disobliged I am mighty glad that I have met with you here where I have had an Opportunity to tell you what so much concerns your Safety which I am afraid you will not find in  Florence  considering the great Power  Don Fabritio  and his  Father the Marquess of  Viterbo  have in this City I have another thing to inform you of That whereas  Don Fabio  had interested himself in your Cause in Opposition to the Marquess of  Viterbo  by reason of the long Animosity between them all hopes of his Countenance and Assistance are defeated For there has been a Proposal of Reconciliation made to both Houses and it is said it will be confirm'd as most such ancient Quarrels are at last by the Marriage of  Juliana  the Marquess's Daughter with  Aurelian  Son to  Don Fabio  To which effect the old Gentleman sent 'tother Day to  Siena  were  Aurelian  has been Educated to hasten his coming to Town but the Messenger returning this Morning brought word That the same day he arriv'd at  Siena Aurelian  had set out for  Florence  in Company with a young  Spanish  Nobleman his intimate Friend so it is believ'd they are both in Town and not unlikely in this Room in Masquerade  H  ppolito  could not forbear smiling to himself at th  se last Words For ever since the naming of  Don Fabio  he had been very attentive but before his Thoughts were wholly taken up with the Beauty of the Face he had seen and from the time she had taken him by the Hand a successive warmth and chilness had play'd about his Heart and surpriz'd him with an unusual Transport He was in a hundred Minds whether he should make her sensible  of her Error or no but considering he could expect no farther Conference with her after he should discover himself and that as yet he knew not of her place of abode he resolv'd to humour the mistake a little further Having her still by the Hand which he squeez'd somewhat more eagerly than is usual for Cousins to do in a low and undistinguishable Voice he let her know how much he held himself obliged to her and avoiding as many words as handsomly he could at the same time entreated her to give him her Advice toward the management of himself in this Affair  Leonora  who never from the beginning had entertain'd the least Scruple of distrust imagined he spoke faintly as not being yet perfectly recovered of his Strength and withal considering that the heat of the Room by reason of the Crowd might be uneasie to a Person in his Condition she kindly told him That if he were as inclinable to dispense with the remainder of that Nights Diversion as she was and had no other Engagement upon him by her consent they should both steal out of the Assembly and go to her House where they might with more freedom discourse about a business of that importance and where he might take something to refresh himself if he were as she conceiv'd him to be indisposed with his long standing Judge you whether the Proposal were acceptable to  Hippolito  or no he had been ruminating with himself how to bring  something like this about and had almost despair'd of it when of a suddain he found the success of his design had prevented his own endeavours He told his Cousin in the same key as before That he was unwilling to be the occasion of her Divorce from so much good Company but for his own part he was afraid he had presumed too much upon his recovery in coming abroad so soon and that he found himself so unwell he feared he should be quickly forc'd to retire  Leonora  stay'd not to make him any other reply only tipp'd him upon the Arm and bid him follow her at a convenient distance to avoid Observation  Whoever had seen the Joy that was in  Hippolito  's Countenance and the Sprightliness with which he follow'd his Beautiful Conductress would scarce have taken him for a Person griev'd with uncured Wounds She led him down a back pair of Stairs into one of the Palace Gardens which had a Door opening into the Piazza not far from where  Don Mario  her Father lived They had little Discourse by the way which gave  Hippolito  time to consider of the best way of discovering himself A thousand things came into his Head in a minute yet nothing that pleased him And after so many Contrivances as he had formed for the discovery of himself he found it more rational for him not to reveal himself at all that Night since he could not foresee what effect the surprize would have she must needs be in at the appearance of a  Stranger whom she had never seen before yet whom she had treated so familiarly He knew Women were apt to shriek or swoon upon such Occasions and should she happen to do either he might be at a loss how to bring himself off He thought he might easily pretend to be indisposed somewhat more than ordinary and so make an excuse to go to his own Lodging It came into his Head too that under pretence of giving her an account of his Health he might enquire of her the means how a Letter might be convey'd to her the next Morning wherein he might inform her gently of her mistake and insinuate something of that Passion he had conceiv'd which he was sure he could not have opportunity to speak of if he bluntly revealed himself He had just resolv'd upon this Method as they were come to the great Gates of the Court when  Leonora  stopping to let him go in before her he of a sudden fetch'd his Breath violently as if some stitch or twinging smart had just then assaulted him She enquired the matter of him and advised him to make haste into the House that he might sit down and rest him He told her he found himself so ill that he judged it more convenient for him to go home while he was in a condition to move for he fear'd if he should once settle himself to rest he might not be able to stir She was much troubled and would have had a Chair made ready and Servants to carry him home but he made answer he would  not have any of her Fathers Servants know of his being abroad and that just now he had an interval of ease which he hop'd would continue till he made shift to reach his own Lodgings Yet if she pleased to inform him how he might give an account of himself the next morning in a Line or two he would not fail to give her the thanks due to her great Kindness and withal would let her know something which would not a l  ttle surprize her though now he had not time to acquaint her with it She show'd him a little Window at the corner of the House where one should wait to receive his Letter and was just taking her leave of him when seeing him search hastily in his Pocket she ask'd him if he miss'd any thing he told her he thought a Wound which was not thorowly heal'd bled a little and that he had lost his Handkerchief His design took for she immediately gave him hers Which indeed accordingly he apply'd to the only Wound he was then griev'd with which though it went quite through his Heart yet thank God was not Mortal He was not a little rejoyc'd at his good Fortune in getting so early a Favour from his Mistress and notwithstanding the violence he did himself to personate a sick Man he could not forbear giving some Symptoms of an extraordinary Content and telling her that he did not doubt to receive a considerable Proportion of Ease from the Application of what had so often kiss'd her fair Hand  Leonora  who did not suspect the Compliment told him she should be heartily glad if that or any thing in her power might contribute to his recovery and wishing him well home went into her House as much troubled for her Cousin as he was joyful for his Mistress  Hippolito  as soon as she was gone in began to make his Remarks about the House walking round the great Court viewing the Gardens and all the Passages leading to that side of the Piazza Having sufficiently informed himself with a Heart full of Love and a Head full of Stratagem he walked toward his Lodging impatient till the arrival of  Aurelian  that he might give himself vent In which interim let me take the liberty to digre  s a little and tell the Reader something which I do not doubt he has apprehended himself long ago if he be not the dullest Reader in the World yet only for order sake let me tell him I say That a young Gentleman Cousin to the aforesaid  Don Fabritio  happened one night to have some words at a Gaming House with one  Lorenzo  which created a Quarrel of fatal Consequence to the former who was killed upon the Spot and likely to be so to the latter who was very desperately Wounded  Fabritio  being much concerned for his Kinsman vow'd revenge according to the ancient and laudable custom of  Italy  upon  Lorenzo  if he surviv'd or in case of his Death if it should happen to anticipate that much more swinging Death which he had in store  for him upon his next of Kin and so to descend Lineally like an  English  Estate to all the Heirs Males of his Family This same  Fabritio  had indeed as  Leonora  told  Hippolito  taken particular notice of him from his first entrance into the Room and was so far doubtful as to go out immediately himself and make enquiry concerning  Lorenzo  but was quickly inform'd of the greatness of his Error in believing a Man to be abroad who was so ill of his Wounds that they now despair'd of his recovery and thereupon returned to the Ball very well satisfied but not before  Leonora  and  Hippolito  were departed  So Reader having now discharg'd my Conscience of a small Discovery which I thought my self obliged to make to thee I proceed to tell thee that our Friend  Aurelian  had by this time danced himself into a Net which he neither could nor which is worse desired to untangle  His Soul was charm'd to the movement of her Body An Air so graceful so sweet so easie and so great he had never seen She had something of Majesty in her which appear'd to be born with her and though it struck an awe into the Beholders yet was it sweetned with a familiarity of Behaviour which rendred it agreeable to every Body The grandeur of her Mien was not stiff but unstudied and unforced mixed with a simplicity free yet not loose nor affected If the former seem'd to condescend the latter seem'd to aspire  and both to unite in the centre of Perfection Every turn she gave in dancing snatcht  Aurelian  into a Rapture and he had like to have been out two or three times with the following his Eyes which she led about as Slaves to her Heels  As soon as they had done dancing he began to complain of his want of Breath and Lungs to speak sufficiently in her Commendation She smilingly told him he did ill to dance so much then Yet in Consideration of the pains he had taken more than ordinary upon her account she would bate him a great deal of Compliment but with this Proviso That he was to discover to her who he was  Aurelian  was unwilling for the present to own himself to be really the Man he was when a suddain thought came into his Head to take upon him the Name and Character of  Hippolito  who he was sure was not known in  Florence  He thereupon after a little pause pretended to recal himself in this manner  'Madam it is no small demonstration of the entire Resignation which I have made of my Heart to your Chains since the secrets of it are no longer in my Power I confess I only took  Florence  in my way not designing any longer Residence than should be requisite to inform the Curiosity of a Traveller of the rarities of the Place Whether Happiness or Misery will be the Consequence of that Curiosity I am yet in fear and submit to your Determination but sure I am  not to depart  Florence  till you have made me the most miserable Man in it and refuse me the fatal Kindness of Dying at your Feet I am by Birth a  Spaniard  of the City of  Toledo  my name  Hppolito di Saviolina  I was yesterday a Man free as Nature made the first to day I am fallen into a Captivity which must continue with my Life and which it is in your Power to make much dearer to me Thus in obedience to your Commands and contrary to my Resolution of remaining unknown in this place I have inform'd you Madam what I am what I shall be I desire to know from you at least I hope thefree discovery I have made of my self will encourage you to trust me with the knowledge of your Person  Here a low bow and a deep sigh put an end to his Discourse and signified his Expectation of her Reply which was to this purposeBut I had forgot to tell you That  Aurelian  kept off his Mask from the time that he told her he was of  Spain  till the period of his Relation  'Had I thought said she that my Curiosity would have brought me in debt I should certainly have forborn it or at least have agreed with you beforehand about the rate of your discovery then I had not brought my self to the Inconveniency of being censur'd either of too much easiness or reservedness but to avoid as much as I can the extremity of either I am resolv'd  but to discover my self in part and will endeavour to give you as little occasion as I can either to boast of or ridicule the Behaviour of the Women of  Florence  in your Travels  Aurelian  interrupted her and swore very solemnly and the more heartily I believe because he then indeed spoke truth that he would make  Florence  the place of his abode whatever concerns he had elsewhere She advised him to be cautious how he swore to his Expressions of Gallantry and farther told him she now hoped she should make him a return to all the Fine Things he had said since she gave him his choice whether he would know whom she was or see her Face  Aurelian  who was really in Love and in whom Consideration would have been a Crime greedily embrac'd the latter since she assured him at that time he should not know both Well what follow'd Why she pull'd off her Ma  k and appear'd to him at once in the Glory of Beauty But who can tell the astonishment  Aurelian  felt He was for a time senseless Admiration had suppress'd his Speech and his Eyes were entangled in Light In short to be made sensible of his condition we must conceive some Idea of what he beheld which is not to be imagined till seen nor then to be express'd Now see the impertinence and conceitedness of an Author who will have a fling at a Description which he has Prefaced with an impossibility One  might have seen something in her Composition resembling the Formation of  Epicurus  his World as if every Atome of Beauty had concurr'd to unite an excellency Had that curious Painter lived in her days he might have avoided his painful search when he collected from the choicest pieces the most choice Features and by a due Disposition and Judicious Symmetry of those exquisite parts made one whole and perfect  Venus  Nature seem'd here to have play'd the Plagiary and to have molded into Substance the most refined Thoughts of inspired Poets Her Eyes diffus'd Rays comfortable as warmth and piercing as the light they would have worked a passage through the straightest Pores and with a delicious heat have play'd about the most obdurate frozen Heart until 'twere melted down to Love Such Majesty and Affability were in her Looks so alluring yet commanding was her Presence that it mingled awe with love kindling a Flame which trembled to aspire She had dancedmuch which together with her being close masked gave her a tincture of Carnation more than ordinary But  Aurelian  from whom I had every tittle of her Description fancy'd he saw a little Nest of Cupids break from the Tresses of her Hair and every one officiously betake himself to his task Some fann'd with their downy Wings her glowing Cheeks while others brush'd the balmy Dew from off her Face leaving alone a heavenly Moisture blubbing  on her Lips on which they drank and revell'd for their pains Nay so particular were their allotments in her service that  Aurelian  was very positive a young Cupid who was but just Penfeather'd employ'd his naked Quills to pick her Teeth And a Thousand other Things his Transport Represented to him which none but Lovers who have experience of such Visions will believe  As soon as he awaked and found his Speech come to him he employ'd it to this effect  ' 'Tis enough that I have seen a DivinityNothing but Mercy can inhabit these PerfectionsTheir utmost rigour brings a Death preferable to any Life but what they giveUse me Madam as you please for by your fair self I cannot think a Bliss beyond what now I feelYou Wound with Pleasure and if you Kill it must be with TransportAh Yet methinks to liveO Heaven to have Life pronounced by those Bless'd LipsDid they not inspire where they command it were an immediate Death of Joy  Aurelian  was growing a little too loud with his Admiration had she not just then interrupted him by clapping on her Masque and telling him they should be observed if he proceeded in his Extravagance and withal that his Passion was too suddain to be real and too violent to be lasting He replied Indeed it might not be very lasting with a submissive mournful Voice but it would continue  during his Life That it was suddain he denied for she had raised it by degrees from his first sight of her by a continued discovery of Charms in her Mein and Conversation till she thought fit to set Fire to the Train she had laid by the Lightning of her Face and then he could not help it if he were blown up  He begg'd her to believe the Sincerity of his Passion at least to enjoin him something which might tend to the Convincing of her Incredulity She said she should find a time to make some Trials of him but for the first she charged him not to follow or observe her after the Dissolution of the Assembly He promised to obey and entreated her to tell him but her Name that he might have Recourse to that in his Affliction for her Absence if he were able to survive it She desired him to live by all means and if he must have a Name to play with to call her  Incognita  till he were better informed  The Company breaking up she took her leave and at his earnest Entreaty gave him a short Vision of her Face which then dress'd in an obliging smile caused another fit of Transport which lasted till she was gone out of Sight  Aurelian  gathered up his Spirits and walked slowly towards his Lodging never remembring that he had lost  Hippolito  till upon turning the Corner of a Street he heard a noise of Fighting and coming near saw a Man make a vigorous Defence against two who pressed violently upon him He then  thought of  Hippolito  and fancying he saw the glimmering of Diamond Buttons such as  Hippolito  had upon the Sleeves of his Habit immediately drew to his Assistance and with that Eagerness and Resolution that the Assailants finding their unmanly odds defeated took to their Heels The Person rescued by the Generous Help of  Aurelian  came toward him but as he would have stoop'd to have saluted him dropp'd fainting at his feet  Aurelian  now he was so near him perceiv'd plainly  Hippolito  's Habit and step'd hastily to take him up Just as some of the Guards who were going the Rounds apprehensive of such Disorders in an Universal Merriment came up to him with Lights and had taken Prisoners the Two Men whom they met with their Swords drawn when looking in the Face of the Wounded Man he found it was not  Hippolito  but his Governour  Claudio  in the Habit he had worn at the Ball He was extreamly surpriz'd as were the Prisoners who confess'd their Design to have been upon  Lorenzo  grounding their Mistake upon the Habit which was known to have been his They were Two Men who formerly had been Servants to him whom  Lorenzo  had unfortunately slain  They made a shift to bring  Claudio  to himself and part of the Guard carrying off the Prisoners whom  Aurelian  desired they would secure the rest accompanied him bearing  Claudio  in their Arms to his Lodging He had not patience to forbear asking for  Hippolito  by the  Way whom  Claudio  assured him he had left safe in his Chamber above Two Hours since That his coming Home so long before the Divertisements were ended and Undressing himself had given him the Unhappy Curiosity to put on his Habit and go to the Palace in his Return from whence he was set upon in the Manner he found him which if he recovered he must own his Life indebted to his timely Assistance  Being come to the House they carried him to his Bed and having sent for Surgeons  Aurelian  rewarded and dismissed the Guard He stay'd the dressing of  Claudio  's Wounds which were many though they hop'd none Mortal and leaving him to his Rest went to give  Hippolito  an Account of what had happened whom he found with a Table before him leaning upon both his Elbows his Face covered with his Hands and so motionless that  Aurelian  concluded he was asleep seeing several Papers lie before him half written and blotted out again he thought to steal softly to the Table and discover what he had been employed about Just as he reach'd forth his Hand to take up one of the Papers  Hippolito  started up so on the suddain as surpriz'd  Aurelian  and made him leap back  Hippolito  on the other hand not supposing that any Body had been near him was so disordered with the Appearance of a Man at his Elbow whom his Amazement did not permit him to distinguish that he leap'd hastily to his Sword  and in turning him about overthrew the Stand and Candles Here were they both left in the Dark  Hippolito  groping about with his Sword and thrusting at every Chair that he felt oppose him  Aurelian  was scarce come to himself when thinking to step back toward the Door that he might inform his Friend of his Mistake without exposing himself to his blind Fury  Hippolito  heard him stir and made a full thrust with such Violence that the Hilt of the Sword meeting with  Aurelian  's Breast beat him down and  Hippolito  a top of him as a Servant alarmed with the noise came into the Chamber with a Light The Fellow trembled and thought they were both Dead till  Hippolito  raising himself to see whom he had got under him swoon'd away upon the discovery of his Friend But such was the extraordinary Care of Providence in directing the Sword that it only past under his Arm giving no Wound to  Aurelian  but a little Bruise between his Shoulder and Breast with the Hilt He got up scarce recovered of his Fright and by the help of the Servant laid  Hippotito  upon the Bed who when he was come to himself could hardly be perswaded that his Friend was before him and alive till he shew'd him his Breast where was nothing of a Wound  Hippolito  begg'd his Pardon a Thousand Times and curs'd himself as often who was so near to committing the last Execrable Act of Amicide  They dismiss'd the Fellow and with many Embraces congratulated their fortunate Delivery from the Mischief which came so near them each blaming himself as the Occasion  Aurelian  accusing his own unadvisedness in stealing upon  Hippolito Hippolito  blaming his own temerity and weakness in being so easily frighted to Disorder and last of all his blindness in not knowing his dearest Friend But there he gave a Sigh and passionately taking  Aurelian  by the Hand cry'd Ah my Friend Love is indeed blind when it would not suffer me to see youThere arose another Sigh a Sympathy seized  Aurelian  immediately For by the Way sighing is as catching among Lovers as yawning among the Vulgar Beside hearing the Name of Love made him fetch such a Sigh that  Hippolito  's were but Flyblows in Comparison that was answered with all the Might  Hippolito  had  Aurelian  ply'd him close till they were both out of Breath  Thus not a Word pass'd though each wondred why the t'other sigh'd at last concluded it to be only Complaisance to one another  Aurelian  broke the Silence by telling him the Misfortune of his Governour  Hippolito  rejoy'd as at the luckiest Accident which could have befallen him  Aurelian  wondred at his unseasonable Mirth and demanded the Cause of it he answered It would necessitate his longer stay in  Florence  and for ought he knew be the Means of bringing a happy Period to his Amour  His Friend thought him to be little better than a Madman when he perceiv'd him of a suddain snatch out of his Bosom a Handkerchief which having kiss'd with a great deal of Ardour he took  Aurelian  by the Hand and smiling at the Surprize he saw him in  'Your  Florentine Cupid  is certainly said he the most Expert in the World I have since I saw you beheld the most Beautiful of Women I am faln desperately in Love with her and those Papers which you see so blotted and scattered are but so many Essays which I have made to the Declaration of my Passion And this Handkerchief which I so zealously Caress is the Inestimable Token which I have to make my self known to her O  Leonora  continued he how hast thou stamp'd thine Image on my Soul How much dearer am I to my self since I have had thy Heavenly Form in keeping Now my  Aurelian  I am worthy thee My exalted Love has Dignified me and rais'd me far above thy poor former Despicable  Hippolito  Aurelian  seeing the Rapture he was in thought it in vain to expect a settled Relation of the Adventure so was reaching to the Table for some of the Papers but  Hippolito  told him Ifhe would have a little Patience he would acquaint him with the whole Matter and thereupon told him Word for Word how he was mistaken for  Lorenzo  and his Management of himself  Aurelian  commended his Prudence in not discovering himself and told him If  he could spare so much time from the Contemplation of his Mistress he would inform him of an Adventure though not so Accidental yet of as great Concern to his own future Happiness So related all that had happened to him with his Beautiful  Incognita  Having ended the Story they began to consider of the means they were to use toward a Review of their Mistresses  Aurelian  was Confounded at the Difficulty he conceived on his Part He understood from  Hippolito  's Adventure that his Father knew of his being in Town whom he must unavoidably Disoblige if he yet conceal'd himself and Disobey if he came into his Sight for he had already entertain'd an Aversion for  Juliana  in apprehension of her being imposed on him His  Incognita  was rooted in his Heart yet could he not Comfort himselfwith any Hopes when he should see her He knew not where she lived and she had made him no Promise of a second Conference Then did he repent his inconsiderate Choice in preferring the momentary Vision of her Face to a certain Intelligence of Her Person Every thought that succeeded distracted him and all the Hopes he could presume upon were within compass of the Two Days Merriment yet to come for which Space he hop'd he might excuse his remaining conceal'd to his Father  Hippolito  on the other side tho'  Aurelian  thought him in a much better Way was no less afflicted for himself The Difficulties which  he saw in his Friend's Circumstances put him upon finding out a great many more in his own than really there were But what terrified him most of all was his being an utter Stranger to  Leonora  she had not the least knowledge of him but through mistake and consequently could form no Idea of him to his Advantage He look'd upon it as an unlucky thought in  Aurelian  to take upon him his Name since possibly the Two Ladies were acquainted and should they communicate each other their Adventures they might both reasonably suffer in their Opinions and be thought guilty of Falshood since it would appear to them as One Person pretending to Two  Aurelian  told him there was but one Remedy for that which was for  Hippolito  in the same Manner that he had done to make use of his Name when he writ to  Leonora  and use what Arguments he could to perswade her to Secrecy least his Father should know of the Reason which kept him concealed in Town And it was likely tho' perhaps she might not immediately entertain his Passion yet she would out of Generosity conceal what was hidden only for her sake  Well this was concluded on after a great many other Reasons used on either Side in favour of the Contrivance they at last argued themselves into a Belief that Fortune had befriended them with a better Plot than their regular Thinking could have contriv'd So soon had they convinc'd themselves in what they were willing to believe  Aurelian  laid himself down to rest that is upon the Bed for he was a better Lover than to pretend sleep that Night while  Hippolito  set himself again to frame his Letter design'd for  Leonora  He writ several at last pitched upon one and very probably the worst as you may guess when you read it in its proper Place  It was break of Day when the Servant who had been employed all the foregoing Day in procuring Accoutrements for the Two Cavaliers to appear in at the Tilting came into the Room and told them all the Young Gentlemen in the Town were trying their Equipage and preparing to be early in the Lists They made themselves ready with all Expedition at the Alarm And  Hippolito  having made a Visit to his Governour dispatch'd a Messenger with the Letter and Directions to  Leonora  At the Signal agreed upon the Casement was opened and a String let down to which the Bearer having fastned the Letter saw it drawn up and returned It were a vain attempt to describe  Leonora  's Surprize when she read the Superscription  The Ʋnfortunate  Aurelian  to the Beautiful  LeonoraAfter she was a little recovered from her Amaze she recollected to her self all the Passages between her and her supposed Cousin and immediately concluded him to be  Aurelian  Then several little Circumstances which she thought might have been sufficient to have convinced her represented themselves to her and she was in a strange Uneasiness to think of her free Carriage to a Stranger  She was once in a Mind to have burn'd the Letter or to have stay'd for an Opportunity to send it again But she was a Woman and her Curiositiy opposed it self to all thoughts of that Nature At length with a fir  Resolution she opened it and found Word for Word what is under written  The LETTER  Madam  IF your fair Eyes upon the breaking up of this meet with somewhat too quick a Surprize make thence I beseech you some reflection upon the Condition I must needs have been in at the suddain Appearance of that Sun of Beauty which at once shone so full upon my Soul I could not immediately disengage my self from that Maze of Charms to let you know how unworthy a Captive your Eyes had made through mistake Sure Madam you cannot but remember my Disorder of which your Innocent Innocent though perhaps to me Fatal Error made a Charitable but wide Construction Your Tongue pursued the Victory of your Eyes and you did not give me time to rally my poor Disordered Senses so as to make a tolerable Retreat Pardon Madam the Continuation of the Deceipt and call it not so that I appeared to be other than my self for Heaven knows I was not then my self nor am I now my own You told me something that concern'd me nearly as to a Marriage my Father designed  me and much more nearly in being told by you For Heaven's sake disclose not to any Body your Knowledge of me that I may not be forced to an immediate act of Disobedience for if my future Services and inviolate Love cannot recommend me to your Favour I shall find more Comfort in the cold Embraces of a Grave than in the Arms of the never so much admired but by me dreaded  Juliana  Think Madam of th  se severe Circumstances I lie under and withal I beg you think it is in your and only in your Power to make them happy as my Wishes or much more miserable than I am able to imagine That dear inestimable tho' undesign'd Favour which I receiv'd from you shall this Day distinguish me from the Crowd of your Admirers that which I really applied to my inward bleeding Wound the welcome Wound which you have made and which unless from you does wish no Cure then pardon and have pity on O Adored  Leonora  him who is your's by Creation as he is Heavens though never so unworthy Have pity on  Your Aurelian  She read the Letter over and over then flung it by then read it again the Novelty of the Adventure made her repeat Curiosity and  take more than ordinary Pains to understand it At last her Familiarity with the Expressions grew to an Intimacy and what she at first permitted she now began to like She thought there was somewhat in it a little more serious than to be barely Gallantry She wondred at her own Blindness she fancy'd she cou'd remember something of a more becoming Air in the Stranger than was usual to  Lorenzo  This thought was parent to another of the same kind till a long Chain successively had Birth and every one somewhat more than other in Favour of the supposed  Aurelian  She reflected upon his Discretion in deferring the Discovery of himself till a little time had as it were weaned her from her perswasion and by removing her farther from her mistake had prepar'd her for a full and determinate Convincement She thought his Behaviour in personating a Sick Man so readily upon the first hint was not amiss and smil'd to think of his Excuse to procure her Handkerchief and last of all his sifting out the Means to write to her which he had done with that Modesty and Respect she could not tell how to find fault with it  She had proceeded thus far in a maze of Thought when she started to find her self so lost to her Reason and would have trod back again that path of deluding Fancy accusing her self of Fondness and inconsiderate Easiness in giving Credit to the Letter of a Person whose Face she never saw and whose first Acquaintance with her was a Treachery and he  who could so readily deliver his Tongue of a Lye upon a Surprize was scarce to be trusted when he had sufficient Time allow'd him to beget a Fiction and Means to perfect the Birth  How did she know this to be  Aurelian  if he were Nay farther put it to the Extremity What if she should upon farther Conversation with him proceed to Love him What Hopes were there for her Or how could she consent to Marry a Man already destin'd for another Woman Nay a Woman that was her Friend whose Marrying with him was to compleat the happy Reconciliation of Two Noble Families and which might prevent the Effusion of much Blood likely to be shed in that Quarrel Besides she should incurr share of the Guilt which he would draw upon him by Disobedience to his Father whom she was sure would not be consenting to it  'Tis strange now but all Accounts agree that just here  Leonora  who had run like a violent Stream against  Aurelian  hitherto now retorted with as much precipitation in his Favour I could never get any Body to give me a satisfactory Reason for her suddain and dexterous Change of Opinion just at that stop which made me conclude she could not help it and that Nature boil'd over in her at that time when it had so fair an Opportunity to show it self For  Leonora  it seems was a Woman Beautiful and otherwise of an exellent Disposition but in the Bottom a very Woman This last Objection this Opportunity of perswading Man to  Disobedience determined the Matter in Favour of  Aurelian  more than all his Excellencies and Qualifications take him as  Aurelian  or  Hippolito  or both together  Well the Spirit of Contradiction and of  Eve  was strong in her and she was in a fair Way to Love  Aurelian  for she lik'd him already that it was  Aurelian  she no longer doubted for had it been a Villain who had only taken his Name upon him for any ill Designs he would never have slip'd so favourable an opportunity as when they were alone and in the Night coming through the Garden and broad Space before the Piazza In short thus much she resolv'd at least to conceal the Knowledge she had of him as he had entreated her in his Letter and to make particular Remarks of his Behaviour that Day in the Lists which should it happen to Charm her with an absolute liking of his Person she resolv'd to dress her self to the best Advantage and muster up all her Graces out of pure Revenge to kill him down right  I would not have the Reader now be impertinent and look upon this to be force or a whim of the Author's that a Woman should proceed so far in the Approbation of a Man whom she never saw that it is impossible therefore ridiculous to suppose it Let me tell such a Critick that he knows nothing of the Sex if he does not know that a Woman may be taken with the Character and Description of a Man when general and extraordinary that she  may be prepossess'd with an agreeable Idea of his Person and Conversation and though she cannot imagine his real Features or manner of Wit yet she has a general Notion of what is call'd a fine Gentleman and is prepar'd to like such a one who does not disagree with that Character  Aurelian  as he bore a very fair Character so was he extreamly deserving to make it good which otherways might have been to his pre  es through an imprudent Indu  g  to our Friends merit we give so large a Description of his Excellencies that People more more room in their Expectation than the Intrinsick worth of the Man will fill which renders him so much the more despicable as there is emptiness to spare 'Tis certain though the Women seldom find that out for though they do not see so much in a Man as was promised yet they will be so kind to imagine he has some hidden excellencies which time may discover to them so are content to allow him a considerable share of their esteem and take him into Favour upon Tick  Aurelian  as he had good Credit so he had a good Stock to support it and his Person was a good promising Security for the payment of any Obligation he could lie under to the Fair Sex  Hippolito  who at this time was our  Aurelian  did not at all lessen him in appearing for him So that although  Leonora  was indeed mistaken she could not be said to be much in the wrong I could find in my Heart to beg the Reader's Pardon for this Digression if I  thought he would be sensible of the Civility for I promise him I do not intend to do it again throughout the Story though I make never so many and though he take them never so ill But because I began this upon a bare Supposition of his Impertinence which might be somewhat Impertinent in me to suppose I do and hope to make him amends by telling him that by the time  Leonora  was dress'd several Ladies of her Acquaintance came to accompany her to the place designed for the Tilting where we will leave them Drinking Chocolate till 'tis time for them to go  Our Cavaliers had by good Fortune provided themselves of two Curious Suits of Light Armour finely Enamelled and Gilt  Hippolito  had sent to  Poggio Imperiale  for a couple of fine led Horses which he had left there with the rest of his Train at his entrance into  Florence  Mounted on these and every way well Equipt they took their way attended only by two Lacqueys toward the Church  di Sancta Croce  before which they were to perform their Exercises of Chivalry  Hippolito  wore upon his Helm a large Plume of Crimson Feathers in the midst of which was artificially placed  Leonora  's Handkerchief His Armour was gilt and Enamell'd with Green and Crimson  Aurelian  was not so happy as to were any token to recommend him to the Notice of his Mistress so had only a Plume of Skycolour and White Feathers suitable to his Armour which was Silver Enamelled with Azure I shall not describe  the Habit of any other Cavaliers or of the Ladies let it suffice to tell the Reader they were all very Fine and very Glorious and let him dress them in what is most agreeable to his own Fancy  Our Gallants entred the Lists and having made their Obeysance to his Highness turned round to salute and view the Company The Scaffold was circular so that there was no end of the Delightful Prospect It seem'd a Glory of Beauty which shone around the Admiring Beholders Our Lovers soon perceiv'd the Stars which were to Rule their Destiny which sparkled a Lustre beyond all the Inferiour Constellations and seem'd like two Suns to distribute Light to all the Planets in that Heavenly Sphere  Leonora  knew her Slave by his Badge and blushed till the Lillies and Roses in her Cheeks had resemblance to the Plume of Crimson and White Handkerchief in  Hippolito  's Crest He made her a low Bow and reined his Horse back with an extraordinary Grace into a respectful Retreat  Aurelian  saw his Angel his Beautiful  Incognita  and had no other way to make himself known to her but by saluting and bowing to her after the  Spanish  mode she guess'd him by it to be her new Servant  Hippolito  and signified her apprehension by making him a more particular and obliging return than to any of the Cavaliers who had saluted her before  The Exercise which was to be perform'd was in general a running at the Ring and afterwards  two Cavaliers undertook to defend the Beauty of  Donna Catharina  against all who would not allow her preheminence of their Mistresses This thing was only design'd for show and form none presuming that any Body would put so great an affront upon the Bride and Duke's Kinswoman as to dispute her pretensions to the first place in the Court of  Venus  But here our Cavaliers were under a mistake for seeing a large Shield carry'd before two Knights with a Lady painted upon it not knowing who but reading the Inscription which was in large Gold Letters  Above the Insolence of Competition  They thought themselves obliged especially in the presence of their Mistresses to vindicate their Beauty and were just spurring on to engage the Champions when a Gentleman stopping them told them their mistake that it was the Picture of  Donna Catharina  and a particular Honour done to her by his Highness's Commands and not to be disputed Upon this they would have return'd to their Post much concerned for their mistake but notice being taken by  Don Ferdinand  of some Show of Opposition that was made he would have begg'd leave of the Duke to have maintained his Lady's Honour against the Insolence of those Cavaliers but the Duke would by no means permit it They were arguing about it when one of them came up before whom the Shield was born and demanded his Highness's Permission to inform those Gentlemen better of their mistake by  giving them the Foyl By the Intercession of  Don Ferdinand  leave was given them where upon a Civil Challenge was sent to the two Strangers informing them of their Error and withal telling them they must either maintain it by Force of Arms or make a publick acknowledgment by riding bear headed before the Picture once round the Lists The StrangerCavaliers remonstrated to the Duke how sensible they were of their Error and though they would not justifie it yet they could not decline the Combate being pressed to it beyond an honourable refusal To the Bride they sent a Complement wherein having first begg'd her pardon for not knowing her Picture they gave her to understand that now they were not about to dispute her undoubted right to the Crown of Beauty but the Honour of being her Champions was the Prize they sought for which they thought themselves as able to maintain as any other Pretenders Wherefore they pray'd her that if Fortune so far befriended their endeavours as to make them Victors that they might receive no other Reward but to be crown'd with the Titles of their Adversaries and be ever after esteem'd as her most humble Servants The excuse was so handsomly designed and much better express'd than it it here that it took effect The Duke  Don Ferdinand  and his Lady were so well satisfied with it as to grant their Request  While the running at the Ring lasted our Cavaliers alternately bore away great share of  the Honour That Sport ended Marshals were appointed for the Field and every thing in great form settled for the Combat The Cavaliers were all in good earnest but orders were given to bring 'em blunted Lances and to forbid the drawing of a Sword upon pain of his Highness's Displeasure The Trumpets sounded and they began their Course The Ladies Hearts particularly the  I  cognita  and  Leonora  's beat time to the Horses Hoof and hope and fear made a mock Fight within their tender Breasts each wishing and doubting success where she lik'd But as the generality of their Prayers were for the graceful Strangers they accordingly succeeded  Aurelian  's Adversary was unhorsed in the first Encounter and  Hippolito  's lost both his Stirrups and dropt his Lance to save himself The Honour of the Field was immediately granted to them and  Donna Catharina  sent them both Favours which she pray'd them to wear as her Knights The Crowd breaking up our Cavaliers made a shift to steal off unmarked save by the watchful  Leonora  and  Incognita  whose Eyes were never off from their respective Servants There was enquiry made for them but to no purpose for they to prevent their being discover'd had prepared another House distant from their Lodging where a Servant attended to disarm them and another carried back their Horses to the  Villa  while they walked unsuspected to their Lodging but  Incognita  had given command to a Page to dog 'em till the  Evening at a distance and bring her word where they were latest housed  While several Conjectures pass'd among the Company who were all gone to Dinner at the Palace who those Cavaliers should be  Don Fabio  thought himself the only Man able to guess for he knew for certain that his Son and  Hippolito  were both in Town and was well enough pleased with his humour of remaining  Incognito  till the Diversions should be over believing then that the surpize of his Discovery would add much to the Gallantry he had shown in Masquerade but hearing the extraordinary liking that every body express'd and in a particular manner the great Duke himself to the Persons and Behaviour of the unknown Cavaliers the Old Gentleman could not forbear the Vanity to tell his Highness that he believed he had an interest in one of the Gentlemen whom he was pleased to honour with so favourable a Character and told him what reason he had to believe the one to be his Son and the other a  Spanish  Nobleman his Friend  This discovery having thus got vent was diffused like Air every body suck'd it in and let it out again with their Breath to the next they met withal and in half an hours time it was talked of in the House where our Adventurers were lodged  Aurelian  was stark mad at the News and knew what search would be immediately made for him  Hippolito  had he not been desperately in Love would certainly  have taken Horse and rid out of Town just then for he could make no longer doubt of being discovered and he was afraid of the just Exceptions  Leonora  might make to a Person who had now deceived her twice Well we will leave them both fretting and contriving to no purpose to look about and see what was done at the Palace where their doom was determined much quicker than they imagined  Dinner ended the Duke retired with some chosen Friends to a Glass of Wine among whom were the Marquess of  Viterbo  and  Don Fabio  His Highness was no Stranger to the long Fewd that had been between the two Families and also understood what Overtures of Reconciliation had been lately made with the Proposals of Marriage between  Aurelian  and the Marquess's Daughter Having waited till the Wine had taken the effect proposed and the Company were rais'd to an uncommon pitch of Chearfulnes which he also encouraged by an Example of Freedom and Good Humour he took an opportunity of rallying the two grave Signior's into an Accommodation That was seconded with the praises of the young Couple and the whole Company joined in a large Encomium upon the Graces of  Aurelian  and the Beauties of  Juliana  The old Fellows were tickled with Delight to hear their Darlings so admired which the Duke perceiving out of a Principle of Generosity and Friendship urged  the present Consummation of the Marriage telling them there was yet one day of publick Rejoycing to come and how glad he should be to have it improved by so acceptable an Alliance and what an honour it would be to have his Cousin's Marriage attended by the Conjunction of so extraordinary a Pair the performance of which Ceremony would crown the Joy that was then in Agitation and make the last day vie for equal Glory and Happiness with the first In short by the Complaisant and Perswasive Authority of the Duke the  Dons  were wrought into a Compliance and accordingly embraced and shook Hands upon the Matter This News was dispersed like the former and  Don Fabio  gave orders for the enquiring out his Son's Lodging that the Marquess and he might make him a Visit as soon as he had acquamted  Juliana  with his purpose that she might prepare her self He found her very chearful with  Donna Catharina  and several other Ladies whereupon the old Gentleman pretty well warmed with the Duke's Good fellowship told her aloud he was come to crown their Mirth with another Wedding that his Highness had been pleased to provide a Husband for h  s Daughter and he would have her provide her self to receive him to morrow All the Company at first as well as  Juliana  her self thought he had rally'd till the Duke coming in confirmed the serious part of his Discourse  Juliana  was confounded at the  haste that was imposed on her and desired a little time to consider what she was about But the Marquess told her she should have all the rest of her Life to consider in that  Aurelian  should come and consider with her in the Morning if she pleased but in the mean time he advised her to go home and call her Maids to Counsel  Juliana  took her leave of the Company very gravely as if not much delighted with her Father's Rallery  Leonora  happened to be by and heard all that passed she was ready to swoon and found her self seized with a more violent Passion than ever for  Aurelian  Now upon her apprehensions of losing him her active fancy had brought him before her with all the Advantages imaginable and tho' she had before sound great tenderness in her Inclination toward him yet was she somewhat surprized to find she really lov'd him She was so uneasie at what she had heard that she thought it convenient to steal out of the presence and retire to her Closet to bemoan her unhappy helpless Condition  Our Two CavalierLovers had rack'd their Invention till it was quite disabled and could not make discovery of one Contrivance more for their Relief Both sat silent each depending upon his Friend and still expecting when t'other should speak Night came upon them while they sate thus thoughtless or rather drowned in Thought but a Servant bringing Lights into the Room awakened them  And  Hippolito  's Speech usher'd by a profound Sigh broke Silence  'Well said he what must we do  Aurelian  We must suffer replied  Aurelian  faintly When immediately raising his Voice he cry'd out  'Oh ye unequal Powers why do ye urge us to desire what ye doom us to forbear give us a Will to chuse then curb us with a Duty to restrain that Choice Cruel Father Will nothing else suffice Am I to be the Sacrifice to expiate your Offences past past ere I was born Were I to lose my Life I'd gladly Seal your Reconcilement with my Blood But Oh my Soul is free you have no Title to my Immortal Being that has Existence independent of your Power and must I lose my Love the Extract of that Being that Joy Light Life and Darling of my Soul No I'll own my Flame and plead my Title tooBut hold wretched  Aurelian  hold whither does thy Passion hurry thee Alas the cruel fair  Incognita  loves thee not She knows not of thy Love If she did what Merit hast thou to pretendOnly LoveExcess of Love And all the World has that All that have seen her Yet I had only seen her once and in that once I lov'd above the World nay lov'd beyond my self such Vigorous Flame so strong so quick she darted at my Breast it must rebound and by Reflection warm her self Ah welcome Thought lovely deluding Fancy  hang still upon my Soul let me but think that once she Loves and perish my Despair  Here a suddain stop gave a Period also to  Hippolito  's Expectation and he hoped now that his Friend had given his Passion so free a vent he might recollect and bethink himself of what was convenient to be done but  Aurelian  as if he had mustered up all his Spirits purely to acquit himself of that passionate Harangue stood mute and insensible like an Alarum Clock that had spent all its force in one violent Emotion  Hippolito  shook him by the Arm to rouze him from his Lithargy when his Lacquey coming into the Room out of Breath told him there was a Coach just stopp'd at the Door but he did not take time to see who came in it  Aurelian  concluded immediately it was his Father in quest of him and without saying any more to  Hippolito  than that he was Ruined if discovered took his Sword and slipp'd down a back pair of Stairs into the Garden from whence he conveyed himself into the Street  Hippolito  had not bethought himself what to do before he perceiv'd a Lady come into the Chamber close veil'd and make toward him At the first Appearance of a Woman his Imagination flattered him with a Thought of  Leonora  but that was quickly over upon nearer Approach to the Lady who had much the Advantage in Stature of his Mistress He very civily accosted her and asked if he were the Person to whom the Honour  of that Visit was intended She said her Business was with  Don Hippolito di Saviolina  to whom she had Matter of Concern to import and which required haste He had like to have told her That he was the Man but by good Chance reflecting upon his Friend's Adventure who had taken his name he made Answer that he believed  Don Hippolito  not far off and if she had a Moments Patience he would enquire for him  He went out leaving the Lady in the Room and made search all round the House and Garden for  Aurelian  but to no purpose The Lady impatient of his long stay took a Pen and Ink and some Paper which she found upon the Table and had just made an End of her Letter when hearing a Noise of more than one coming up Stairs she concluded his Friend had found him and that her Letter would be to no purpose so tore it in peices which she repented when turning about she found her Mistake and beheld  Don Fabio  and the Marquess of  Viterbo  just entring at the Door She gave a Shriek at the Surprize of their Appearance which much troubled the Old Gentlemen and made them retire in Confusion for putting a Gentlewoman into such a Fright The Marquess thinking they had been misinformed or had mistaken the Lodgings came forward again and made an Apology to the Lady for their Errour but she making no reply walk'd directly by him down Stairs and went into her Coach  which hurried her away as speedily as the Horses were able to draw  The  Dons  were at a loss what to think when  Hippolito  coming into the Room to give the Lady an Account of his Errant was no less astonished to find she was departed and had left Two Old Signiors in her stead He knew  Don Fabio  's Face for  Aurelian  had shewn him his Father at the Tilting but being confident he was not known to him he ventur'd to ask him concerning the Lady whom just now he had left in that Chamber  Don Fabio  told him she was just gone down and doubted they had been Guilty of a Mistake in coming to enquire for a Couple of Gentlemen whom they were informed were Lodged in that House he begg'd his Pardon if he had any Relation to that Lady and desired to know if he could give them any Account of the Persons they sought for  Hippolito  made answer He was a Stranger in the Place and only a Servant to that Lady whom they had disturb'd and whom he must go and seek out And in this Perplexity he left them going again in Search of  Aurelian  to inform him of what had passed  The Old Gentlemen at last meeting with a Servant of the House were directed to Signior  Claudio  's Chamber where they were no sooner entered but  Aurelian  came into the House A Servant who had skulk'd for him by  Hippolito  's Order followed him up into the  Chamber and told him who was with  Claudio  then making Enquiry for him He thought that to be no Place for him since  Claudio  must needs discover all the Truth to his Father wherefore he left Directions with the Servant where  Hippolito  should meet him in the Morning As he was going out of the Room he espied the torn Paper which the Lady had thrown upon the Floor The first piece he took up had  Incognita  written upon it the sight of which so Alarm'd him he scarce knew what he was about but hearing a Noise of a Door opening over Head with as much Care as was consistent with the haste he was then in he gathered up the scattered pieces of Paper and betook himself to a Ramble  Coming by a Light which hung at the Corner of a Street he join'd the torn Papers and collected thus much that his  Incognita  had Written the Note and earnestly desired him if there were any reality in what he pretended to her to meet her at Twelve a Clock that Night at a Convent Gate but unluckily the Bit of Paper which should have mentioned what Convent was broken off and lost  Here was a large Subject for  Aurelian  's Passion which he did not spare to pour forth in Abundance of Curses on his Stars So earnest was he in the Contemplation of his Misfortunes that he walk'd on unwittingly till at length a Silence and such as was only to be found in that part of the Town  whither his unguided Steps had carried him surpriz'd his Attention I say a profound Silence rouzed him from his Thought and a clap of Thunder could have done no more  Now because it is possible this at some time or other may happen to be read by some malicious or Ignorant Person no Reflection upon the present Reader who will not admit or does not understand that Silence should make a Man start and have the same Effect in provoking his Attention with its opposite Noise I will illustrate this Matter to such a diminutive Critick by a Parallel Instance of Light which though it does chiefly entertain the Eyes and is indeed the prime Object of the Sight yet should it immediately cease to have a Man left in the Dark by a suddain deficiency of it would make him stare with his Eyes and though he could not see endeavour to look about him Why just thus did it  are with our Adventurer who seeming to have wandred both into the Dominions of Silence and of Night began to have some tender for his own Safety and would willingly have groped his Way back again when he heard a Voice as from a Person whose Breath had been stopp'd by some forcible Oppression and just then by a violent Effort was broke through the Restraint'YetYetagain reply'd the Voice still struggling for Air  'Forbearand I'll forgive what's pastI have done nothing yet that needs a Pardon  says another and what is to come will admit of none  Here the Person who seemed to be the Oppressed made several Attempts to speak but they were only inarticulate Sounds being all interrupted and choaked in their Passage  Aurelian  was sufficiently astonish'd and would have crept nearer to the Place whence he guessed the Voice to come but he was got among the Ruins of an Old Monastery and could not stir so silently but some loose Stones he met with made a rumbling The Noise alarm'd both Parties and as it gave Comfort to the one it so Terrified the t'other that he could not hinder the Oppressed from calling for help  Aurelian  fancy'd it was a Womans Voice and immediately drawing his Sword demanded what was the Matter he was answered with the Appearance of a Man who had opened a Dark Lanthorn which he had by him and came toward him with a Pistol in his Hand ready cock'd  Aurelian  seeing the irresistable advantage his Adversary had over him would fain have retired and by the greatest Providence in the World going backwards fell down over some loose Stones that lay in his Way just in that Instant of Time when the Villain fired his Pistol who seeing him fall concluded he had Shot him The Crys of the afflicted Person were redoubled at the Tragical Sight which made the Murderer drawing a Poniard  to threaten him that the next Murmur should be his last  Aurelian  who was scarce assured that he was unhurt got softly up and coming near enough to perceive the Violence that was used to stop the Injured Man's Mouth for now he saw plainly it was a Man cry'd outTurn Villain and look upon thy DeathThe Fellow amazed at the Voice turn'd about to have snatch'd up the Lanthorn from the Ground either to have given Light only to himself or to have put out the Candle that he might have made his Escape but which of the Two he designed no Body could tell but himself And if the Reader have a Curiosity to know he must blame  Aurelian  who thinking there could be no foul Play offered to such a Villian ran him immediately through the Heart so that he drop'd down Dead at his Feet without speaking a Word He would have seen who the Person was he had thus happily delivered but the Dead Body had fallen upon the Lanthorn which put out the Candle However coming up toward him he ask'd him how he did and bid him be of good Heart he was answered with nothing but Prayers Blessings and Thanks called a Thousand Deliverers good Genius's and Guardian Angels And the Rescued would certainly have gone upon his Knees to have worshipped him had he not been bound Hand and Foot which  Aurelian  understanding groped for the Knots and either untied  them or cut them asunder but 'tis more probable the latter because more expeditious  They took little heed what became of the Body which they left behind them and  Aurelian  was conducted from out the Ruins by the Hand of him he had delivered By a faint light issuing from the just rising Moon he could discern that it was a Youth but coming into a more frequented part of the Town where several Lights were hung out he was amaz'd at the extream Beauty which appeared in his Face though a little pale and disordered with his late fright  Aurelian  longed to hear the Story of so odd an adventure and entreated his Charge to tell it him by the way but he desired him to forbear till they were come into some House or other where he might rest and recover his tired Spirits for yet he was so faint he was unable to look up  Aurelian  thought these last words were deliveed in a Voice whose accent was not new to him That thought made him look earnestly in the Youth's Face which he now was sure he had somewhere seen before and thereupon asked him if he had never been at  Siena  That Question made the young Gentleman look up and something of a Joy appeared in his Countenance which yet he endeavour'd to smother so praying  Aurelian  to conduct him to his Lodging he promised him that as soon as they should come thither he would acquaint him with any thing he desired to know  Aurelian  would rather have gone any where else than to his own Lodging but being so very late he was at a loss and so forced to be contented  As soon as they were come into his Chamber and that Lights were brought them and the Servant dismissed the paleness which so visibly before had usurped the sweet Countenance of the afflicted Youth vanished and gave place to a more lively Flood of Crimson which with a modest heat glow'd freshly on his Cheeks  Aurelian  waited with a pleasing Admiration the discovery promised him when the Youth still struggling with his Resolution with a timorous haste pulled off a Peruke which had concealed the most beautiful abundance of Hair that ever graced one Female Head those dishevelled spreading Tresses as at first they made a discovery of so at last they served for a veil to the modest lovely blushes of the fair  Incognita  for she it was and none other But Oh the inexpressible inconceivable joy and amazement of  Aurelian  As soon as he durst venture to think he concluded it to be all Vision and never doubted so much of any thing in his Life as of his being then awake But she taking him by the Hand and desiring him to set down by her partly convinced him of the reality of her presence  'This is the second time  Don Hippolito  said she to him that I have been here this Night What the occasion was of my seeking  you out and how by miracle you preserved me would add too much to the surprize I perceive you to be already in should I tell you Nor will I make any further discovery till I know what censure you pass upon the confidence which I have put in you and the strange Circumstances in which you find me at this time I am sensible they are such that I shall not blame your severest Conjectures but I hope to convince you when you shall hear what I have to say in justification of my Vertue  Justification cry'd  Aurelian  what Infidel dares doubt itThen kneeling down and taking her Hand  'Ah Madam says he would Heaven would no other ways look upon than I behold your PerfectionsWrong not your Creature with a Thought he can be guilty of that horrid Impiety as once to doubt your Virtue  Heavens cry'd he starting up  'am I so really blessed to see you once again May I trust my SightOr does my fancy now only more strongly workFor still I did preserve your Image in my Heart and you were ever present to my dearest Thoughts  'Enough  Hippolito  enough of Rapture said she you cannot much accuse me of Ingratitude for you see I have not been unmindful of you but moderate your Joy till I have told you my Condition and if for my sake you are raised to this Delight it is not of a long continuance  At that as  Aurelian  tells the Story a Sigh diffused a mournful sweetness through the Air and liquid grief fell gently from her Eyes triumphant sadness sat upon her Brow and even sorrow seem'd delighted with the Conquest he had made See what a charge  Aurelian  felt His Heart bled Tears and trembled in his Breast Sighs struggling for a vent had choaked each others passage up His Floods of Joys were all supprest cold doubts and fears had chill'd 'em with a sudden Frost and he was troubled to excess yet knew not why Well the Learned say it was Sympathy and I am always of the Opinion with the Learned if they speak first  After a World of Condolance had passed between them he prevailed with her to tell him her Story So having put all her Sighs into one great Sigh she discharged her+self of 'em all at once and formed the Relation you are just about to Read  'Having been in my Infancy Contracted to a Man I could never endure and now by my Parents being likely to be forced to Marry him is in short the great occasion of my grief I fancy'd continued she something so generous in your Countenance and uncommon in your Behaviour while you were diverting your self and rallying me with Expressions of Gallantry at the Ball as induced me to hold Conference with you I now freely confess to you out of design That if things should happen as I  then feared and as now they are come to pass I might rely upon your assistance in a matter of Concern and in which I would sooner chuse to depend upon a generous Stranger than any Acquaintance I have What Mirth and Freedom I then put on were I can assure you far distant from my Heart but I did violence to my self out of Complaisance to your TemperI knew you at the Tilting and wished you might come off as you did though I do not doubt but you would have had as good Success had it been opposite to my InclinationsNot to detain you by too tedious a Relation every day my Friends urged me to the Match they had agreed upon for me before I was capable of Consenting at last their importunities grew to that degree that I found I must either consent which would make me miserable or be miserable by perpetually enduring to be baited by my Father Brother and other Relations I resolved yesterday on a suddain to give firm Faith to the Opinion I had conceived of you and accordingly came in the Evening to request your assistance in delivering me from my Tormenters by a safe and private conveyance of me to a Monastry about four Leagues hence where I have an Aunt who would receive me and is the only Relation I have averse to the Match I was surprized at the appearance of some Company I did not expect at your Lodgings which made me in haste tear a Paper  which I had written to you with Directions where to find me and get speedily away in my Coach to an old Servant's House whom I acquainted with my purpose By my Order she provided me of this Habit which I now wear I ventured to trust my self with her Brother and resolved to go under his Conduct to the Monastry he proved to be a Villain and pretending to take me a short and private way to the place where he was to take up a Hackney Coach for that which I came in was broke some where or other with the haste it made to carry me from your Lodging led me into an old ruined Monastry where it pleased Heaven by what Accident I know not to direct you I need not tell you how you saved my Life and my Honour by revenging me with the Death of my Perfidious Guide This is the summ of my present Condition bating the apprehensions I am in of being taken by some of my Relations and forced to a thing so quite contrary to my Inclinations  Aurelian  was confounded at the Relation she had made and began to fear his own Estate to be more desperate than ever he had imagined He made her a very Passionate and Eloquent Speech in behalf of himself much better than I intend to insert here and expressed a mighty concern that she should look upon his ardent Affection to be only Rallery or Gallantry He was very free of his Oaths to confirm the Truth of what he pretended  nor I believe did she doubt it or at least was unwilling so to do For I would Caution the Reader by the bye not to believe every word which she told him nor that admirable sorrow which she counterfeited to be accurately true It was indeed Truth so cunningly intermingled with Fiction that it required no less Wit and Presence of Mind than she was endowed with so to acquit her self on the suddain She had entrusted her self indeed with a Fellow who proved a Villain to conduct her to a Monastry but one which was in the Town and where she intended only to lie concealed for his sake as the Reader shall understand ere long For we have another Discovery to make to him if he have not found it out of himself already  After  Aurelian  had said what he was able upon the Subject in hand with a mournful tone and dejected look he demanded his Doom She asked him if he would endeavour to convey her to the Monastry she had told him of  'Your commands Madam replied he are Sacred to me and were they to lay down my Life I would obey them  With that he would have gone out of the Room to have given order for his Horses to be got ready immediately but with a Countenance so full of sorrow as moved Compassion in the tender hearted  Incognita  'Stay a little  Don Hippolito  said she I fear I shall not be able to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey this NightStay and give me your advice how I  shall conceal my self if I continue to morrow in this Town  Aurelian  could have satisfied her she was not then in a place to avoid Discovery But he must also have told her then the reason of it  viz  whom he was and who were in quest of him which he did not think convenient to declare till necessity should urge him for he feared least her knowledge of those designs which were in agitation between him and  Juliana  might deter her more from giving her Consent At last he resolved to try his utmost perswasions to gain her and told her accordingly he was afraid she would be disturbed there in the Morning and he knew no other way if she had not as great an aversion for him as the Man whom she now endeavour'd to avoid than by making him hapyy to make her  elf secure He demonstrated to her that the disobligation to her Parents would be greater by going to a Monastry since it was only to avoid a Choice which they had made for her and which she could not have so just a pretence to do till she had made one for her self  A World of other Arguments he used which she contradicted as long as she was able or at least willing At last she told him she would consult her Pillow and in the Morning conclude what was fit to be done He thought it convenient to leave her to her rest and having lock'd her up in his Room went himself to repose upon a Pallat by Signior  Claudio  In the mean time it may be convenient to enquire what became of  Hippolito  He wandred much in pursuit of  Aurelian  though  Leonora  equally took up his Thoughts He was reflecting upon the oddness and extravagance of his Circumstances the Continuation of which had doubtless created in him a great uneasiness when it was interrupted with the noise of opening the Gates of the Convent of St  Lawrence  whither he was arrived sooner than he thought for being the place  Aurelian  had appointed by the Lacquey to meet him in He wondred to see the Gates opened at so unseasonable an hour and went to enquire the reason of it from them who were employ'd but they proved to be Novices and made him signs to go in where he might meet with some body allow'd to answer him He found the Religious Men all up and Tapers lighting every where At last he follow'd a Friar who was going into the Garden and asking him the cause of these Preparations he was answer'd That they were entreated to pray for the Soul of a Cavalier who was just departing or departed this Life and whom upon farther talk with him he found to be the same  Lorenzo  so often mentioned  Don Mario  it seems Uncle to  Lorenzo  and Father to  Leonora  had a private Door out of the Garden belonging to his House into that of the Convent which Door this Father was now a going to open that he and his Family might come and offer up their Oraisons for the Soul of their Kinsman  Hippolito  having informed himself of as much as he could ask without suspicion took his leave of the Friar not a little joyful at the Hopes he had by such unexpected Means of seeing his Beautiful  Leonora  As soon as he was got at convenient distance from the Friar who 'tis like thought he had returned into the Convent to his Devotion he turned back through a close Walk which led him with a little Compass to the same private Door where just before he had left the Friar who now he saw was gone and the Door open  He went into  Don Mario  's Garden and walk'd round with much Caution and Circumspection for the Moon was then about to rise and had already diffused a glimmering Light sufficient to distinguish a Man from a Tree By Computation now which is a very remarkable Circumstance  Hippolito  entred this Garden near upon the same Instant when  Aurelian  wandred into the Old Monastry and found his  Incognita  in Distress He was pretty well acquainted with the Platform and Sight of the Garden for he had formerly surveyed the Outside and knew what part to make to if he should be surpriz'd and driven to a precipitate Escape He took his Stand behind a well grown Bush of Myrtle which should the Moon shine brighter than was required had the Advantage to be shaded by the Indulgent Boughs of an ancient BayTree He was delighted with the Choice he had made or he found a Hallow in the Myrtle as if purposely  contriv'd for the Reception of one Person who might undiscovered perceive all about him He looked upon it as a good Omen that the Tree Consecrated to  Venus  was so propitious to him in his Amorous Distress The Consideration of that together with the Obligation he lay under to the Muses for sheltering him also with so large a Crown of Bays had like to have set him a Rhyming  He was to tell the Truth naturally addicted to  Madrigal  and we should undoubtedly have had a small desert of Numbers to have pick'd and Criticiz'd upon had he not been interrupted just upon his Delivery nay after the Preliminary Sigh had made Way for his Utterance But so was his Fortune  Don Mario  was coming towards the Door at that very nick of Time where he met with a Priest just out of Breath who told him that  Lorenzo  was just breathing his last and desired to know if he would come and take his final Leave before they were to administer the Extream Unction  Don Mario  who had been at some Difference with his Nephew now thought it his Duty to be reconciled to him so calling to  Leonora  who was coming after him he bid her go to her Devotions in the Chappel and told her where he was going  He went on with the Priest while  Hippolito  saw  Leonora  come forward only accompanied by her Woman She was in an undress and by reason of a Melancholy visible in her  Face more Careless than usual in her Attire which he thought added as much as was possible to the abundance of her Charms He had not much Time to Contemplate this Beauteous Vision for she soon passed into the Garden of the Convent leaving him Confounded with Love Admiration Joy Hope Fear and all the Train of Passions which seize upon Men in his Condition all at once He was so teazed with this Variety of Torment that he never missed the Two Hours tha thad slipped away during his Automachy and Intestine Conflict  Leonora  's Return settled his Spirits at least united them and he had now no other Thought but how he should present himself before her When she calling her Woman bid her bolt the Garden Door on the Inside that she might not be Surpriz'd by her Father if he returned through the Convent which done she ordered her to bring down her Lute and leave her to her self in the Garden  All this  Hippolito  saw and heard to his inexpressible Content yet had he much to do to smother his Joy and hinder it from taking a Vent which would have ruined the only Opportunity of his Life  Leonora  withdrew into an Arbour so near him that he could distinctly hear her if she Played or Sung Having tuned her Lute with a Voice soft as the Breath of Angels she sung to it this following Air  I  Ah Whither whither shall I fly  A poor unhappy Maid  To hopeless Love and Misery  By my own Heart betray'd  Not by  Alexis  Eyes undone  Nor by his Charming Faithless Tongue  Or any Practis'd Art  Such real Ills may hope a Cure  But the sad Pains which I endure  Proceed from fancied Smart  II  'Twas fancy gave  Alexis  Charms  Ere I beheld his Face  Kind Fancy then could fold our Arms  And form a soft Embrace  But since I've seen the real Swain  And try'd to fancy him again  I'm by my Fancy taught  Though 'tis a Bliss no Tongue can tell  To have  Alexis  yet 'tis Hell  To have him but in Thought  The Song ended grieved  Hippolito  that it was so soon ended and in the Exstacy he was then rapt I believe he would have been satisfied to have expired with it He  could not help Flattering himself though at the same Time he checked his own Vanity that he was the Person meant in the Song While he was indulging which thought to his happy Astonishment he heard it encouraged by these Words  'Unhappy  Leonora  said she how is thy poor unwary Heart misled Whither am I come The false deluding Lights of an imaginary Flame have led me a poor benighted Victim to a real Fire I burn and am consumed with hopeless Love those Beams in whose soft temperate warmth I wanton'd heretofore now flash destruction to my Soul my Treacherous greedy Eyes have suck'd the glaring Light they have united all its Rays and like a burningGlass conveyed the pointed Meteor to my HeartAh  Aurelian  how quickly hast thou Conquer'd and how quickly must thou ForsakeOh Happy to me unfortunately Happy  Juliana  I am to be the Subject of thy TriumphTo thee  Aurelian  comes laden with the Tribute of my Heart and Glories in the Oblation of his broken VowsWhat then is  Aurelian  FalseFalse alass I know not what I say How can he be False or True or any Thing to me What Promises did he ere make or I receive Sure I dream or I am mad and fansie it to be Love Foolish Girl recal thy banished ReasonAh  would it were no more would I could rave sure that would give me Ease and rob me of the Sense of Pain at least among my wandring Thoughts I should at sometime light upon  Aurelian  and fansie him to be mine kind Madness would flatter my poor feeble Wishes and sometimes tell me  Aurelian  is not lostnot irrecoverablynot for ever lost  Hippolito  could hear no more he had not Room for half his Transport When  Leonora  perceived a Man coming toward her she fell a trembling and could not speak  Hippolito  approached with Reverence as to a Sacred Shrine when coming near enough to see her Consternation he fell upon his Knees  'Behold O Adored  Leonora  said he your ravished  Aurelian  behold at your Feet the Happiest of Men be not disturbed at my Appearance but think that Heaven conducted me to hear my Bliss pronounced by that dear Mouth alone whose breath could fill me with new Life  Here he would have come nearer but  Leonora  scarce come to her self was getting up in haste to have gone away He catch'd her Hand and with all the Endearments of Love and Transport pressed her stay she was a long time in great Confusion at last with many Blushes she entreated him to let her go where she might hide her Guilty Head and not expose her shame before his Eyes  since his Ears had been sufficient Witnesses of her Crime  He begg'd pardon for his Treachery in overhearing and confessed it to be a Crime he had now repeated With a Thousand Submissions Entreaties Prayers Praises Blessings and passionate Expressions he wrought upon her to stay and hear him Here  Hippolito  made use of his Rhetorick and it prov'd prevailing 'Twere tedious to tell the many ingenious Arguments he used with all her Nice Distinctions and Objections In short he convinced her of his Passion represented to her the necessity they were under of being speedy in their Resolves That his Father for still he was  Aurelian  would undoubtedly find him in the Morning and then it would be too late to Repent She on the other Hand knew it was in vain to deny a Passion which he had heard her so frankly own and no doubt was very glad it was past and done besides apprehending the Danger of delay and having some little Jealousies and Fears of what Effect might be produced between the Commands of his Father and the Beauties of  Juliana  after some decent Denials she consented to be Conducted by him through the Garden into the Convent where she would prevail with her Confessor to Marry them He was a scrupulous Old Father whom they had to deal withal insomuch that ere they had perswaded him  Don Mario  was returned by the  Way of his own House where missing his Daughter and her Woman not being able to give any farther Account of her than that she left her in the Garden he concluded she was gone again to her Devotions and indeed he found her in the Chappel upon her Knees with  Hippolito  in her Hand receiving the Father's Benediction upon Conclusion of the Ceremony  It would have asked a very skilful Hand to have depicted to the Life the Faces of those Three Persons at  Don Mario  's Appearance He that has seen some admirable Piece of Transmutation by a Gorgon's Head may form to himself the most probable Idea of the Prototype The Old Gentleman was himself in a sort of a Wood to find his Daughter with a Young Fellow and a Priest but as yet he did not know the Worst till  Hippolito  and  Leonora  came and kneeling at his Feet begg'd his Forgiveness and Blessing as his Son and Daughter  Don Mario  instead of that fell into a most violent Passion and would undoubtedly have committed some extravagant Action had he not been restrained more by the Sanctity of the Place than the Perswasions of all the Religious who were now come about him  Leonora  stirr'd not off her Knees all this time but continued begging of him that he would hear her  'Ah Ungrateful and Undutiful Wretch cry'd he how hast thou requited all my  Care and Tenderness of thee Now when I might have expected some return of Comfort to throw thy self away upon an unknown Person and for ought I know a Villain to me I'm sure he is a Villain who has robb'd me of my Treasure my Darling Joy and all the future Happiness of my Life prevented Gogo thou now to be forgotten  Leonora  go and enjoy thy unprosperous Choice you who wanted not a Father's Counsel cannot need or else will slight his Blessing  These last Words were spoken with so much Passion and feeling Concern that  Leonora  moved with Excess of Grief fainted at his Feet just as she had caught hold to Embrace his Knees The Old Man would have shook her off but Compassion and Fatherly Affection came upon him in the midst of his Resolve and melted him into Tears he Embraced his Daughter in his Arms and wept over her while they endeavoured to restore her Senses  Hippolito  was in such Concern he could not speak but was busily employed in rubbing and chafing her Temples when she opening her Eyes laid hold of his Arm and cry'd out  Oh my  Aurelian  how unhappy have you made me  With that she had again like to have fainted away but he shook her in his Arms and begg'd  Don Mario  to have some pity on his Daughter since by his Severity she was reduced to that  Condition The Old Man hearing his Daughter name  Aurelian  was a little revived and began to hope Things were in a pretty good Condition he was perswaded to comfort her and having brought her wholly to her self was content to hear her Excuse and in a little time was so far wrought upon as to beg  Hippolito  's Pardon for the Ill Opinion he had conceived of him and not long after gave his Consent  The Night was spent in this Conflict and it was now clear Day when  Don Mario  Conducting his new Son and Daughter through the Garden was met by some Servants of the Marquess of  Viterbo  who had been enquiring for  Donna Leonora  to know if  Juliana  had lately been with her for that she was missing from her Father's House and no conjectures could be made of what might become of her  Don Mario  and  Leonora  were surprized at the News for he knew well enough of the Match that was design'd for  Juliana  and having enquired where the Marquess was it was told him That he was gone with  Don Fabio  and  Fabritio  towards  Aurelian  's Lodgings  Don Mario  having assured the Servants that  Juliana  had not been there dismissed them and advised with his Son and Daughter how they should undeceive the Marquess and  Don Fabio  in their Expectations of  Aurelian Hippolito  could oftentimes scarce forbear smiling at the old Man's Contrivances who was most deceiv'd himself he at length  advised them to go all down together to his Lodging where he could present himself before his Father and ingenuously confess to him the truth and he did not question his approving of his Choice  This was agreed to and the Coach made ready While they were upon their way  Hippolito  pray'd heartily that his Friend  Aurelian  might be at the Lodging to satisfie  Don Mario  and  Leonora  of his Circumstances and Quality when he should be obliged to discover himself His Petitions were granted for  Don Fabio  had beset the House long before his Son was up or  Incognita  awake  Upon the Arrival of  Don Mario  and  Hippolito  they heard a great Noise and Hubbub above Stairs which  Don Mario  concluded was occasioned by their not finding  Aurelian  whom he thought he could give the best account of So that it was not in  Hippolito  's power to disswade him from going up before to prepare his Father to receive and forgive him While  Hippolito  and  Leonora  were left in the Coach at the Door he made himself known to her and begg'd her pardon a thousand times for continuing the Deceit She was under some concern at first to find she was still mistaken but his Behaviour and the Reasons he gave soon reconciled him to her his Person was altogether as agreeable his Estate and Quality not at all inferior to  Aurelian  's in the mean time the true  Aurelian  who had seen his Father begg'd leave of him to withdraw for a moment  in which time he went into the Chamber where his  Incognita  was dressing her self by his design in Woman's Apparel while he was consulting with her how they should break the matter to his Father it happened that  Don Mario  came up Stairs where the Marquess and  Don Fabio  were they undoubtedly concluded him Mad to hear him making Apologies and Excuses for  Aurelian  whom he told them if they would promise to forgive he would present before them immediately The Marquess asked him if his Daughter had lain with  Leonora  that Night he answered him with another question in behalf of  Aurelian  In short they could not understand one another but each thought 'tother beside himself  Don Mario  was so concern'd that they would not believe him that he ran down Stairs and came to the Door out of Breath desiring  Hippolito  that he would come into the House quickly for that he could not perswade his Father but that he had already seen and spoke to him  Hippolito  by that understood that  Aurelian  was in the House so taking  Leonora  by the Hand he followed  Don Mario  who led him up into the DiningRoom where they found  Aurelian  upon his Knees begging his Father to forgive him that he could not agree to the Choice he had made for him since he had already disposed of himself and that before he understood the designs he had for him which was the reason that he had hitherto concealed himself  Don Fabio  knew not  how to answer him but look'd upon the Marquess and the Marquess upon him as if the Cement had been cool'd which was to have united their Families  All was silent and  Don Mario  for his part took it to be all Conjuration he was coming forward to present  Hippolito  to them when  Aurelian  spying his Friend started from his Knees and ran to embrace himMy dear  Hippolito  said he what happy chance has brought you hither just at my Necessity  Hippolito  pointed to  Don Mario  and  Leonora  and told him upon what terms he came  Don Mario  was ready to run mad hearing him called  Hippolito  and went again to examine his Daughter While she was informing him of the truth the Marquess's Servants returned with the melancholy News that his Daughter was no where to be found While the Marquess and  Don Fabritio  were wondering at and lamenting the Misfortune of her loss  Hippolito  came towards  Don Fabio  and interceeded for his Son since the Lady perhaps had withdrawn her self out of an Aversion to the Match  Don Fabio  though very much incens'd yet forgot not the Respect due to  Hippolito  's Quality and by his perswasion spoke to  Aurelian  though with a stern Look and Angry Voice and asked him where he had disposed the cause of his Disobedience if he were worthy to see her or no  Aurelian  made Answer That he desired no more than for him to see her and he did not doubt a Consequence  of his Approbation and ForgivenessWell said  Don Fabio  you are very conceited of your own Discretion let us see this Rarity While  Aurelian  was gone in for  Incognita  the Marquess of  Viterbo  and  Don Fabritio  were taking their leaves in great disorder for their loss and disappointment but  Don Fabio  entreated their stay a moment longer till the return of his Son  Aurelian  led  Incognita  into the Room veil'd who seeing some Company there which he had not told her of would have gone back again But  Don Fabio  came bluntly forwards and ere she was aware lifted up her Veil and beheld the Fair  Incognita  differing nothing from  Juliana  but in her Name This discovery was so extreamly surprizing and welcome that either Joy or Amazement had tied up the Tongues of the whole Company  Aurelian  here was most at a loss for he knew not of his Happiness and that which all along prevented  Juliana  's confessing her self to him was her knowing  Hippolito  for whom she took him to be  Aurelian  's Friend and she feared if he had known her that he would never have consented to have depriv'd him of her  Juliana  was the first that spoke falling upon her Knees to her Father who was not enough himself to take her up  Don Fabio  ran to her and awaken'd the Marquess who then embraced her but could not yet speak  Fabritio  and  Leonora  strove who should first take her in their Arms for  Aurelian  he was out of his Wits  for Joy and  Juliana  was not much behind him to see how happily their Loves and Duties were Reconcil'd  Don Fabio  embraced his Son and forgave him The Marquess and  Fabritio  gave  Juliana  into his Hands he received the Blessing upon his Knees all were overjoy'd and  Don Mario  not a little proud at the discovery of his SoninLaw whom  Aurelian  did not fail to set forth with all the ardent Zeal and Eloquence of Friendship  Juliana  and  Leonora  had pleasant Discourse about their unknown and mistaken Rivalship and it was the Subject of a great deal of Mirth to hear  Juliana  relate the several Contrivances which she had to avoid  Aurelian  for the sake of  Hippolito  Having diverted themselves with many Remarks upon the pleasing surprize they all thought it proper to attend upon the Great Duke that Morning at the Palace and to acquaint him with the Novelty of what had pass'd while by the way the two Young Couple entertained the Company with the Relation of several Particulars of their
