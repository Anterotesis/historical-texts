 AN ARGUMENT Shewing That the Prince of WALES Tho' a PROTESTANT has no just Pretensions to the Crown of ENGLAND  With some REMARKS ON The late pretended Discovery of a Design to steal him away  LONDON  Printed for A  Baldwin  near the  Oxford Arms in WarwickLane    THE PREFACE  THE Town has been amus'd with a Story of late about a Design discovered at St  Germans  to have stollen away the Prince of Wales and some of our NewsWriters have been prevail'd with to put it into their Publick Papers and bestow it upon the World  Since then he that Prints a Story subjects both Himself and his Tale to the Censure of every Reader I have as much Right as another to pass my Judgment in the Case  And tho' I am first assur'd from very good Hands that the Story it self is a Forgery and that at St  Germains  they know nothing of the Matter yet I think it may not be amiss to give the World some short Observatious upon the Subject because I believe they will quickly hear more  of it For the Story of Stealing the Prince of  Wales  was not contriv'd to no purpose but as an Anticedent to something which was to come after which the World is to be acquainted with in good time when 'tis first observ'd how they will relish this  If what I shall say be Offensive to such who are concern'd for the  Young Gentleman  they ought to be angry with the Broachers of the Story and not with the Author of these Observations  AN ARGUMENT Shewing That the Prince of WALES Tho' a PROTESTANT has no just Pretensions to the Crown of ENGLAND  AMONG those People who are more than ordinarily careful for the Future it has been a Question not a little debated What shall we do for a King in  England  after the Decease of his present Majesty and the Princess in case they should die without Issue  And tho' it be properly a Work which no Body has any thing to do with but a Parliament yet our busie Politicians have ransack't Forreign Countries for a King  Some wiser than others have propos'd the Duke of  Savoy  's Son the young Prince of  Piedmont  Some one some another as their Fancies guide them  Ay  but says a Learned Rabbi skill'd in the Letter of the Law  he is a Roman Catholick and that is a Barr by our Constitution Well  replys another  but he may he sent into  England  to be Educated a Protestant  At the hearing of which Medium a Third Party have thought fit to start a Case on the other side  Why so may some body else  and so all Parties become Friends again  They that have Ears to hear let them hear  First We thank those Gentlemen for satisfying the World that they despair now of the Restoration of K  James  which has been so long talk'd of and are content to Postpone their Happiness to a Time so remote that possibly it may never come to pass  And as to the Case in hand if they think it proper they may propose it to the next Parliament and no doubt but what they do in it the Nation will be well satified with and in the mean time we refer them to the Experiment  But it may not be improper to Examine here the Project laid to Try the Nation How such a Story would take with them  And if you Examine the NewsPaper you will find it introduc'd into the World with a  We hear We hear there has been a Design discover'd at St Germans to steal away the Prince of Wales and to convey him over into  England  to be brought up a Protestant  The Writer of this News wou'd be very helpful in the Discovery if he wou'd honestly inform the World how and where he heard the News whether he had it by Letter or Messenger Post or Express for 'tis certain that no body else can hear any thing of it  If he will own  with more honesty than he wrote  that he really invented it of his own Head to help fill up his own Paper as no question they many times do in other Cases  It will be the best Reply to my Suggestions that any body can make and I must allow all I am saying is as Impertinent as  Knavish  But if he was directed to write it by some body no matter by who it must be from a design  I shall attempt therefore to open the Eyes of the World a little by Examining the Incoherences and Inconsistences of the Story and then the Design of it  As to the Incoherence of the Story a discovery of a Design but by no Evidence or Information no Persons designing taken nor none enquired after to be apprehended no body nam'd to be discoverers or discovered so that they are only supposed to be afraid of such and such a thing and to have doubled the Guards to prevent it  Then the Reason is set down for which he shou'd be convey'd away to be carried into  England  Had they stopt there something might have been meant some Mischief might have been supposed to have been design'd against him But to clear it up to the World the very bottom of the  design is laid open that they shou'd take the Child away to Educate him  a Protestant  Unless the Author of this News was let into the Project I speak of he wou'd never have suggested it but all Mankind wou'd have thought that if there had been any danger of stealing him away to carry him into  England  it shou'd be with some wicked design to  make away with him  his coming being death by our Law rather then Educate him in the Protestant Religion  The Party therefore that cou'd descend to these Particulars tho' no Evidence be produc'd nor no Confession made of any Person concern'd must I say be let into the design  And now I have said so much of a Design I desire to Explain what I mean by it  The design I mean is not to steal the Prince of  Wales as they call him  away and bring him into  England  But to broach an Oponion among the People That on the failure of the present Settlement the Prince of  VVales  is the true  and lawful Heir of the Crown and that to qualifie him to Enjoy it he may be bred a Pro  estant  And to insinuate this more finely into our Fancies it is put the other way That they are afraid the English People shou'd steal him away to make him a Protestant in order to have the Kingdom whether he will or no  I cannot help making a little sport of this Jest  That we shou'd be made believe the late King wou'd be so chary of this Child and his Religion as to prevent his being declar'd Heir apparent to the Crown of  England  on the bare apprehensions of his being Educated a Protestant  That the English shou'd be in such distress for a Successor to the Crown when God be thank'd there are Two happy Lives to Enjoy it before hand as to go abroad to steal One  That the Crown of  England  shou'd be accounted so mean a thing that a Guard shou'd be set upon any body to prevent their being  spirited away  from the Court of  France  to be made King of  England  And to add to the ridiculous part of it That any body on pretence of Educating him a Protestant shou'd dare to bring him into  England  without Licence from the present Government as is expresly provided for by Act of Parliament They wou'd make  a special Protestant  of him indeed where he must be a Martyr at first Conversion to bring him where setting his Foot was immediate Death by the Statutes of the Kingdom  The insinuation therefore of stealing the Prince of  Wales  to make a Protestant of him is a Figurative Expression a  Metanimy  a way of speaking wherein something is intended which is not expressed and if I could make it speak English 'tis thus  That if you please Gentlemen to have the Prince of  Wales  to Reign over you after the failure of the present Settlement he is at your Service and will come and be brought up in the Protestant Religion whenever you think fit  I shall not enter into any Discoveries of the Nature of the Succession of the Crown of  England  nor of the Right of such Families as pretend to it they are things to tender to be handled here  But in this case I may presume to say that since the present Settlement of the Crown of  England  is declar'd by the Parliament of  England  own'd by the World and receiv'd by the general Ascent of the Nation at the end of this Settlement the same Collective Body of the Nation are the only Judges of the Right of any Person whatsoever  And as for the Gentlemen who are so willing to restore the Line of King  James  they are desir'd to consider that by attempting it in this method they come under a Necessity of owning the Authority of the Parliament of  England  the same Authority which Abdicated his Father and by consequence must justifie all the Proceedings of the late Revolution and this will be a bitter Pill to them  Not but that stranger things than these have been done too for a Crown but this must be done before an English Parliament can so much as consider of it nay by suggesting or so much as supposing his Right to be referr'd to the English Nation it must at the same time be suppos'd that he wou'd not stick at all that to be declar'd capable of Inheriting the Crown of  England  These are such contradictory and inconstent  things as makes the Story very ridiculous and shows the Party is driven to  strange shifts  to bring to pass their designs and wou'd comply with any thing to get the Reins in their hands again  Now if they only want to know how the Nation wou'd resent an Attempt of this Nature they may be soon satisfied in that point by moving it in Parliament and in the mean time they need not pretend to keep a Guard upon him at St  Germain  for I dare say the English Nation will as soon steal away his Father as him and they have not shown themselves so fond of either as to make them afraid of it  I shall not at all enter into the Enquiry concerning the Legitimacy of his Birth nor quote the learned Authorities of the eminent Mr  Fuller  on that Head whose Evidence is to as much purpose as the matter is insignificant  For be it so that King  James  is the true Father of the Child it matters not one farthing in the Title to the Crown for his Father whose Legitimacy no body doubts by being a Roman Catholick has rendred himself uncapable of the Government and so does the Son and Settlements are not to be alter'd every  time he thinks fit to alter his Religion  But methinks it remains as an Eternal Mark either of the Folly or Pride of his Parents that if the Queen was really with Child which  God forgive me if I am mistaken  I never believed she did not put it past all possibility of Debate by giving such undeniable proofs of it  as 'tis known such Cases will admit of  and that to those Persons in particular as she knew wou'd be very sorry to see it  The Queen was not a Lady of so much Nicety as that she shou'd decline letting such Female Effects of her Conception be known  especially to her own Sex  as wou'd have confounded all Gainsayers  Nor did she want the Vanity of shewing those invincible Demonstrations to some Persons in the Court to whom she might have reason to think the truth would have been a particular Mortification  The truth then being so easie to be made plain  and those easie steps being omitted  gives me more cause of doubt in the Matter than all the Affirmatives of Evidence  Fuller  can do for it was not a thing for the Nation to prove a Negative upon as some have pretended to  expect but they in whose power it was once to make it plain having omitted it Mankind ought to doubt the truth of it because had it been true none but Madmen or worse would have conceal'd any part of it  Nor does the Declaration of the present King when Prince of  Orange  say any more than that there was ground to suspect it and then concludes  that the Examination both of it and the Right of Succession is referr'd to a free Parliament  Which Parliament having settled the Succession according to that Article on the unexpected Occasion of the Abdication of King  James  and his carrying this Son on whom the doubt was rais'd into  France  to be brought up a Papist  Examining into his Birth became needless  and it signifies nothing whether he be Legitimate or no his Father rendred them both incapable by the Article of Religion and the Nation has settled the Succession another way  This with submission I think to be the true state of the Case and will pass for such with me till I see it stated otherwise by some body that understands it better than I do  But some have started a Case which requires a word or two of Reply  If the Prince of  Wales  be allowed to be the Legitimate Son of King  James  and had been a Protestant there had been no Objection against his Title  This has a plain Answer in the sequel of the Story The Abdication of King  James  did not consist in his Maleadministration  but in his deserting the Nation  and it may be remembred that there was great strugling for the Word in the  Convention  some wou'd have had the word  Deserted  voted instead of  Abdicated  Now if King  James  Deserted the Nation so did his Son with him and thereby the Throne became vacant and the power of Government devolv'd upon such as were next Heirs and who they were was to be decided by the Parliament who have been allow'd to be the Judges of the Right of Succession in all Ages  Now the Parliament did not upon this Vacancy of the Throne proceed to Elect a King  as some People are mighty fond of saying  and so alter our Constitution to an Elective Monarchy  But they proceeded to Examine whose the Right of Government was and to make  a Declaration of that Right by Authority of Parliament and King  James  and his Son  if he be his Son  having left the Kingdom they declared that the Throne was thereby vacant that is by their deferting the People and that the Succession ought to descend so and so which Succession they farther confirm'd by the Sanction of an Act of Parliament  Had K  James  notwithstanding his Maleadministration continued in the Kingdom tho' he might have been Deposed yet the Parliament must have gone upon other measures to have transferr'd the Succession to the Crown from him to another Head  On this account it is that the King and Queen of  England  are declared rightful and lawful  And on this Foundation the young Gentleman we speak of tho' he were the Legitimate Son of King  James  and a Protestant yet having deserted the People of  England  with his Father has equally abdicated the Government and the Throne was thereby vacant  The Point of Religion is the next Barr the Commons of  England  at the first Meeting  of the Convention did not make any new Laws but only made a Declaration of what was before the undoubted Right of the People of  England  and what ought to be observ'd by any Prince who shou'd hereafter succeed in the Government and in order to obviate all Objections  against  the continuing under the Government of King  James  and before they had entred upon ths Consideration or his having gone away and left them they laid a firm Foundation of a Regular Government in a Message to the Lords carried up by Mr  Hampden  and a Body of their Members in which the Vote of the House was read at the Barr of the House of Lords thus  Resolved  Nemine Contradicente    That it is inconsistent with the Constitution of this Protestant Kingdom to be governed by a Popish Prince  Now how a Popish Prince may pretend to be converted and turn Protestant to obtain a Crown and how often he may turn and return on the same account and whether the Settlement of the Succession is oblig'd to change with him or how far a Parliament wou'd think themselves oblig'd to take notice  of such changes of the Religion of a Prince these are things not for me to determine  But this I dare be free to determine that no Parliament will send into  France  to steal away a Prince to make a Protestant of and so force him to accept of the Crown of  England  whether he will or no and especially a Person whom they thought fit to leave wholly out of their Settlement before  So that these Gentlemen may save themselves the labour of attempting the Conversion of this Prince for the Settlement of our Succession was not built upon his being a Roman Catholick but upon the Abdication of his Father and so far upon his own as his Birth shall appear to give him a Title since he has from that time forward absented himself from the Kingdom to which his pretences  if he had any  were to be made  It may be ask'd here To what end and purpose K  James  convey'd him away if he had any confidence in the possibility of clearing up the point of his Legitimacy he might have left him here it was impracticable that any violence cou'd have been pretended to be acted upon him for nothing cou'd have been charg'd upon him if the Illegitimacy of his  Birth had been alledg'd the proof wou'd have been put upon the Nations side till which nothing cou'd legally have been done to his prejudice but as it is the proof remains at their own doors which since they thought fit to omit I see no concern the Nation has in the matter  For suppose Q  Mary  had really been with Child and had  for as wise ends as other things were then done  thought fit never to let it be known and a Child had been born in the dark and bred up in private and the Nation knew nothing of the matter but that twenty years after when the Parliament might have settled the Succession another way this Child shou'd be Trumpt up as a right Heir to the Crown  It wou'd be never the less true that he was K  James  's Son and he wou'd have as much right to the Crown as a real Son but who wou'd have believ'd it wou'd not the Nation say and reason good  Why was it not told us that the Queen was with Child Why was not some of the Royal Family entrusted with the knowledge of it Why was not the Queen's being with Child made known and the Protesta  t Ladies of the Court shown  such proofs of it as that they might be able to testifie the truth of it  wou'd it be enough to say it was below the Queen to trouble her head about it and she did not think the satisfaction of the Nation worth her while  I question whether any Nation in  Europe  wou'd accept of a King upon such terms we see 'tis quite otherwise in  France  where all the Princes of the Blood are at liberty and claim it as a priviledge to come into the very Chamber of the Queen when she is in Travail and to see the Infant as soon as 'tis come into the World  The Case thus stated I put it upon all the Champions of their Party to disprove the Argument which I lay down in these few words  That the Persons on whom the proof of his Legitimacy lay having omitted the Legal demonstrations of it which they ought to have given 'tis very reasonable that we shou'd question the truth of it  And while the Ligitimacy of his Birth remains a question the People of  England  ought not to trouble their heads about him for 'tis not for us to enquire of it but they shou'd have made it out whose business it was  Thus far the reason of the Case is plain  without any need to go to proving of Negatives  And while it is thus they may even take their double Guards off of him again for if he is ever Kidnap'd away to make a Protestant of we must be reduc'd to very hard terms and the English Crown go a begging at a most pitiful rate  I confess I am no Friend to a Commonwealth Government in  England  when I reflect on the last how ill it was manag'd and how soon it fell into Disorders and Parties and how little a while it continu'd but I had rather see a Commonwealth set up or any thing Popery excepted than that we shou'd be brought to seek a King at the French Court and one that we have repudiated as born in huggermugger no body knows how nor where and that his Mother did not think it worth while to give the English Nation satisfaction about when she was with Child but on the contrary scorn'd the Attempts of some of the first Quality to make the Discovery  But that which adds to the Banter too is that we shou'd steal him away  Bless us all  that we shou'd turn  Kidnappers  for a King  and spirit folks Children away  for let him be whose Son he will 'tis certain he is some bodies  to make Kings of them  The truth on't is it is not a light matter to be a King of  England  'Tis a Post of great Difficulty as well as Honour and perhaps K  James  may be afraid to venture his Son least he shou'd have no better success than himself which wou'd certaily fall out if he took his Measures  But to think that the English Nation shou'd ever entertain such thoughts of his Son  allow he were so  as to take him away by stealth I cannot call it an affront to the Nation 'tis rather a Banter upon the poor young Gentleman who I dare say knows not a word of the matter  I remember I have heard it said before the Fire of  London  happen'd news was carried down into the Country that the City was burnt and was reported publickly above Miles from  London  at least two days before the Fire began which was a certain Token of a design to bring it to pass  If I shou'd judge of the present Case by the practice of those People I shou'd expect to hear next Post that this young Prince is really lost carried away  c  to the unspeakable  Grief of his Parents and the Disturbance of the whole Court  c  I shall not venture to say it will be so but I may venture to say there are several Turns of State in the World which such a Thing may answer  As first If it shou'd be true that at the bottom of the business this was not the Legitimate Son of K  James  which however uncertain we are of it it is well enough known to themselvesWhy now they see the Sham won't take and they have ran the Jest so far as that they have ruin'd themselves and the Show is over they will of course be soon weary of the Child and as a Plot made a Prince of him so another may reduce him to what they please he may be lost in the dark and be heard of no more and give it out that the English have carry'd him away to reserve him in  Petto  as the Pope does his Cardinals to make a King of him when they want one and in the mean time bring him up a Heretick  This is an easy way to be rid of him whenever they please and so the poor young Gentleman had better have appear'd in the world what he really wasnor do we want Instances of Impostors set up in the World to personate  Princes who have afterwards vanish'd as they came when the Persons who set them up cou'd not bring to pass their designs by it  Or if we shou'd suppose that the King of  France  has his Eyes on the Succession of  England  as he has lately had on that of  Spain  in right of the Dutchess of  Burgundy  and possibly may oblige King  James  to make the second Experiment of leaving him the Crown by his last Will and Testament I do not say such Chimera's as these are in the heads of any body but I do say that if they are 'twill be absolutely necessary to remove the Person we are speaking of out of the way  And what likelier Project can they have to rid themselves of him and as they may think at the same time to make the Nation uneasy then to give out that the English have carried him away to make a Protestant of him  These are Ends▪ I say that such a thing will serve and I may be excused making such remote Guesses and Suppositions for none of them are so wild and chimerical as the fancy of bringing him hither  And if any such Measures shou'd be taken with the young Gentlemen I think a single  Author may venture to enter this Protest in the Name of the whole Nation that 'tis a Trick of their own and the English Nation can have no hand in it  The Authority of the Nation cannot have any hand in it because they can do nothing in private and it must be known if it had been Parliamentary  The honest protestant loyal Party cannot be said to have a hand in it because Mankind is said not to be able to do that which their known Interest forbids them to do and no body can imagine that Party should ever design to bring him hither without imagining at the same time that it was to Murther and Destroy him which God forbid  As to the  Jacobite  English Party they cannot design it because 'twill not any way answer their designs  First  If ever they shou'd have power to make him a King publickly 'tis plain he will serve their turn as well if he be a Papist as a Protestant or else they cannot be what we call them  Jacobites  that is Friends to King  James  Secondly  If they bring him in only to reserve him in  Petto  as I said it must be one of these two ways either publickly or privately  If publickly unless they have a Force to defend him they bring him only to Martyrdom for our Laws will take immediate hold on him and put him to death  If privately to be reserv'd till the Line shall fail he must then reside  Incognito  and if ever the time shou'd come to set him up having been lost so many years no body wou'd know him and the Nation wou'd never believe 'twas he which wou'd always leave room for Impostors and setting up sham Princes to mise Insurrections and disturb the publick  Peace  of the Nation as in the Case of  Perkin Warbeck  and  Ralph Wilford  in the days' of  Henry  the Seventh  So that rightly examin'd this Sham will never fasten upon the English Nation for it will answer the Ends of neither Friend nor Foe  But if ever we hear that the  Prince  of  Wales  as they call him is lost carried away it must either be that  they  are conscious to themselves of his being a foster Son and the design having miscarried are weary of the Adopt and so have dismist him this World or else that he is remov'd to try another Fetch for the English Crown by way of Title  which if the  Prince  of  Piedmont  dies falls by Inheritance the Barr of Religion excepted to the House of  Bourbon  in right of the Wife of the present Duke of  Burgundy  who is Granddaughter to a Daughter of  England  by King  Charles  the First  And as to the Barr of Religion pray what's that to a good Army What's the Gospel to a Kettle Drum or Justice and Laws to a Regiment of Curiasseeres If the French King comes once to have a fair Claim to the Crown of  England  for his Grandson and you have nothing to plead in Barr but his Religion he'll talk with you about that in other Terms  You must certainly expect to talk in the Insernal Language of Fire and Smoke and tho' tis hoped we shov'd have Zeal enough for our Religion to fight him to the last Gasp yet all Men must allow the  Power  of  France  at this time is so great that 'twould be much better never to have it brought to a Trial  FINIS
