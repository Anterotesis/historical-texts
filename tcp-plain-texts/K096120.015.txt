DCC XCIV  EGYPT  CHAP VIII  Of the Diseases  AMONG other diseases incident to the human frame those of the eyes are peculiar to Egypt where the blind are numerous This affliction ought not however to be attributed to the reflected beams of a burning sun for the Arabs who live amidst sands generally have good eyes and a piercing sight nor must we think with  Hassalquist  whose stay was short in the country that the disease was occa∣sioned by the exhalations of the stagnant waters for the French merchants whose houses are on the banks of the canal of Grand Cairo that for six months in the year contains water the smell of which is insup∣portable would be all blind and for these fifty years not one has lost his sight The origin of this disease  no doubt is the Egyptian custom of sleeping in the open air on the terraces of their houses or near their huts during summer From what  Volney  remarks on this subject it appears the seaair contributes very much to dim the organs of sight in this misty at∣mosphere  Defluxions on the eyes says he are not peculiar to Egypt they are also frequent in Syria with this dif∣ference that they are less general and that the in∣habitants of the seacoast are alone subject to them  In the city of Cairo which is always full of filth these disorders are more prevalent than in all the rest of Egypt The common people are more liable to them than persons in easy circumstances and the natives more than foreigners The prodigious num∣ber of persons in this city whose sight is either gone or impaired is scarce credible Of a hundred persons adds the above writer I have met while walking the streets of Cairo twenty have been quite blind ten wanting an eye and twenty others have had their eyes red purulent or blemished Almost every one wears a fillet a token of an approaching or convalescent opthalmy but nothing is more astonishing than the indifference and apathy with which they support so dreadful a misfortune  It was decreed  says the Mus∣sulman  praise be to God God has willed it  says the Christian  blessed be his name  These defluxions happen at no certain season They are an endemial disorder common to every month of the year and to every age The custom of sleeping in the air to which it is generally attributed is not adequate to the effects ascribed to it for in countries remote from the sea the inhabitants also sleep on their terraces and yet their sight is not in∣jured If therefore at Cairo in the Delta and on the coast of Syria it is dangerous to sleep in the open air this air must acquire some noxious qua∣lity from the vicinity of the sea  The usual diet of the Egyptians appears likewise to be a powerful cause The cheese sour milk honey confection of grapes green fruits and raw vegetables the ordinary food of the people produce in the stomach a disorder which physicians have ob∣served to affect the sight Bodies thus nourished abound in corrupted humours which are constantly en∣deavouring a discharge Diverted from the ordinary channels by habitual perspiration they fly to the ex∣terior parts and naturally attack the head because the Egyptians by shaving it once a week and keep∣ing it very warm principally attract the perspiration there and if the head receives ever so slight an im∣pression  of cold on being uncovered this perspira∣tion is suppressed and falls upon the teeth or still more readily upon the eyes as being the tenderest part On every fresh cold this organ is weakened and at length finally destroyed  Blindness is in many instances occasioned by the consequences of the smallpox This disorder which is very fatal in that country is not well treated during the three first days confection of grapes honey and sugar are administered to the sick and after the seventh they are allowed milk meat and saltfish as if they were in full health Inoculation is not unknown to them but little practised They perform the ope∣ration in a manner different from us by inserting a thread into the flesh or by making the patient inhale or swallow the powder of dried pustules  Another very general distemper at Cairo is that which the vulgar there call the  blessed evil  and which we also improperly term the  Neapolitan disorder  one half of Cairo is infected with it The greatest part of the inhabitants believe it proceeds from fright from witchcraft or from uncleanliness Some suspect the real cause but as that is connected with a subject on which they are remarkably reserved they chuse not to mention it This blessed evil is very difficult to cure mercury under whatever form administered gene∣rally  fails sudorific vegetables succeed better with∣out being however infallible happily the virus is not very active from the great natural and artificial per∣spiration We see there as in Spain old men carry∣ing this disorder about them to the age of eighty But the danger is imminent to such as carry it into a cold country for it there never fails to make a rapid progress and shews itself always more inveterate from this transplantation  Several modern authors with  M Paw  at their head have said the pestilence is native in Egypt Foreign physicians says  Savary  who have resided there twenty or thirty years have assured me this epidemic disease was brought thither by the Turks A proof that it is not native in Egypt is that except in time of great famine it never breaks out in Grand Cairo nor the inland towns but always begins at sea ports on the arrival of Turkish vessels and travels to the ca∣pital whence it proceeds as far as Syene Having come to a period in Grand Cairo and being again in∣troduced by the people of Upper Egypt it renews with greater fury and sometimes sweeps off two or three hundred thousand souls but always stops in the month of June or those who catch it then are always cured  We ought not to pass over another striking re∣mark which is that the excess of heat and cold are equally destructive of this dreadful contagion win∣ter kills it in Constantinople and summer in Egypt it seldom reaches the polar circle and never passes the tropic The caravavs of Grand Cairo Damas∣cus and Ispahan which are sometimes infected never propagate it at Mecca and Yemen is safe from the plague  The Europeans stand aghast with fear at the cala∣mities it produces in Grand Cairo According to the commissioners of the customs this city contains from eight to nine hundred thousand inhabitants They are so crowded that two hundred citizens here occupy less space than thirty at Paris The streets are very narrow and always full of people who croud and jostle each other and the passenger is sometimes obliged to wait several minutes before he can make his way One person with the plague will communicate it to a hundred its progress is rapid and spreads with the violence of a conflagration the flames of which are augmented by the wind  When the disease breaks out the French shut up their district and intercept all communication with the city Arab servants who live without every day bring them such provisions as they want and except  bread which does not communicate the infection they throw what they bring through an aperture cut in each door into a tub of water by which it is purified and used without fear These precautions give health and life to the French merchants while sur∣rounded with all the horrors of death  Burials funeral processions and tears are in every street for like the Turks and Greeks when the Egyptians bury their relations and friends there are hired mourners who make the air resound with their lamentations and desolate mothers who groaning cover their faces with dust rend their cloaths at∣tending to the grave the child they have nurtured and whom they soon follow for the Eastern people more pious than we are never forsake their infected relations but assist them to the last moment though almost certain their affection will be fatal These cries of despair and funeral pomp spread a general consternation and the French tremble in their asylums Who indeed without terror could see humanity suf∣fering under so fearful a visitation  All do not die who are attacked but there are sometimes no less than three hundred thousand peo∣ple carried off by this pestilence in Grand Cairo Could it be supposed that the example of the French who when the contagion is past leave their houses  safe and in health would not induce the Turks to use like precautions Could it be imagined that throughout the whole Ottoman empire quarantine is not performed at one single port or merits a nation like this to inhabit a country of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians  CHAP IX  Of their Commerce  TWO powerful causes have contributed to render Cairo the seat of an extensive commerce the first of which is that all the commodities consumed in Egypt are collected within the walls of that city and all the persons of property that is the Mamlouks and lawyers are assembled there and draw thither their whole revenue  The second is the situation which makes this city a centre of circulation while by the Red Sea it cor∣responds  with Arabia and India by the Nile with Abyssinia and the interior parts of Africa and by the Mediterranean with Europe and the empire of Tur∣key Every year a caravan from Abyssinia arrives at Cairo and brings from a thousand to twelve hun∣dred black slaves as also elephants' teeth gold dust ostrich feathers gums parrots and monkeys while another destined for Mecca leaves the extremities of Morocco and receiving pilgrims even from the river of Senegal coasts along the Mediterranean collecting those of Algiers Tripoli and Tunis and arrives by the desart at Alexandria consisting of not less than three or four thousand camels From thence it pro∣ceeds to Cairo where it joins the caravan of Egypt They then jointly set out for Mecca where they ar∣rive one hundred days after But the pilgrims of Mo∣rocco who have six hundred leagues more to travel do not reach home till after an absence of more than a year The lading of these caravans consists in India stuffs shawls gums pearls perfumes and espe∣cially the coffee of Yemen  The same commodities arrive by another route at Suez Cairo does not retain the whole of this mer∣chandize but besides what is there consumed con∣siderable profits arise from the duties and the sums expended by the pilgrims On the other hand small caravans arrive from time to time from Damascus  with silk oils and fruits During the favourable season there are likewise vessels in the road of Damietta unloading hogsheads of tobacco from La∣tahia the consumption of which in Egypt is enor∣mous Others arrive successively at Alexandria bringing clothing arms fur passengers and wrought silk from Constantinople Vessels come likewise from Marscilles Leghorn and Venice with cloths cochi∣neal Lyons' stuffs and laces grocery paper iron lead Venetian sequins and German dahlers All these articles conveyed by sea to Rosetta in barks are first landed there then reimbarked on the Nile and sent to Cairo  From this account it is not surprising that com∣merce should continue so flourishing in the capital of Egypt and we need not hesitate to believe the re∣port of the commissionergeneral of the customs who asserted in that Cairo had traded to the amount of very near six millions and a half sterling  But if we examine the channels into which this wealth is poured if we consider that great part of the merchandize and coffee of India passes into foreign countries the value of which is paid in goods from Europe and Turkey that the consumption of the country almost entirely consists of articles of luxury completely finished and that the produce  given in return is chiefly raw materials we shall per∣ceive that all this commerce is carried on without contributing greatly to the real riches of Egypt or the benefit of the people  Under the  Ptolemies  the haven of Alexandria re∣ceived the merchandize of the whole world and the city became as  Strabo  calls it the greatest emporium on earth There was then a canal continued between the Nile and the Red Sea This work was com∣pleted under  Ptolemy Philadelphus  It began at the Pelusiac branch and was carried to Arsinoe now Ag∣geront distant two leagues from the port of Suez for thus far the sea has retired since that aera Locks constructed at its mouth prevented a too hasty stream and there were lakes which supplied it where boats might stop  The  Ptolemies  kept up a formidable marine in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean to protect the Egyptian merchants  Theocritus  affirms they had ninetyseven firstrate ships several of which were two hundred feet long and four thousand barks to bear orders throughout the empire By such means  Pto∣lemy Philadelphus  extended his conquests far into Ethiopia and Yemen and reigned over thirtythree thousand cities These facts would appear incre∣dible were they not attested by writers of good au∣thority  and did we not know to what degree of splen∣dor commerce might raise a state  Following the example of his predecessors  Ptolemy Evergetes  founded his power on trade to which he gave every encouragement maintained the marine of the Red Sea subjugated several of the kings of Ho∣meritae who reigned in Arabia Felix commanded them to guard the high roads and effectually protect∣ed caravans from the Arabs The wealth of Egypt was at its utmost under his reign and the abundance of gold and riches of all kinds ever productive of ex∣cessive luxury in Alexandria corrupted the court of its kings Most men are virtuous in mediocrity mis∣fortune elevates the mind and imparts energy but excessive prosperity enervates and by opening the floodgates of vice shuts those of happiness  The  Ptolemies  enjoying supreme power abandon∣ed themselves to effeminacy irresolution and disor∣ders which infected the morals of their subjects for the corruption of kingdoms always begins with that of the great The fourth of these princes however performed some good acts He also kept up and maintained the marine his ancestors had created Un∣der his reign were vessels of a size so enormous that they have never since been equalled  Plutarch  de∣scribes one of his vessels with forty benches of rowers  three hundred and seventythree feet long and sixtyfour high at the poop This enormous ship beside which our threedeckers would seem small frigates contained four hundred sailors to work her four thou∣sand rowers and about three thousand fighting men The arts of shipbuilding and navigation must have been brought to great perfection among the Egyp∣tians who could build and work such immense vessels that resembled floating towns  During the Alexandrian war which  Ptolemy  XII sustained against  Coesar  the latter burnt a hundred and ten large ships and the Egyptians still had re∣sources enabling them to equip a fleet capable of facing the enemy But who could withstand the genius of  Coesar  To a woman the glory of triumph∣ing over this great man was reserved  Cleopatra  subjected the conqueror by charms irresistible Du∣ring the course of her life this queen displayed mag∣nificence and prodigality of which history contains not a second example Cited by  Anthony  then at Tarsus in Cecilia to render an account of her conduct she went to meet the Roman General Passing the Medi∣terranean she sailed up the Cydnus in a vessel the description of which resembles what the poets give us of the shell of  Venus  The sails were purple the prow and sides of glittering gold and the oars which kept time with the music were plated with silver The  queen reclining under her canopy says  Plutarch  en∣riched with gold and inestimable gems corresponded in dress to the splendor of her ship The richest robes bedecked with pearls and diamonds veiled but did not conceal her charms Like the Cytherean god∣dess round her were numerous children habited like cupids agitating the air this new deity breathed while clouding perfumes incessantly burnt were waft∣  to the shore  Anthony  intending to punish  Cleo∣patra  soon felt the power of her beauty and for∣getting the judge became the lover Yet not to beauty alone was the Egyptian queen indebted for victory She had wit and a cultivated understanding knew the Oriental languages spoke the Greek Ethio∣pic Hebrew Parthian Syriac and Persian and con∣versed in their own idioms with the various foreigners who incessantly came to the port of Alexandria that was then become the emporium of the world  Cleopatra  had vanquished  Coesar  and  Anthony  but in vain attempted  Augustus  a cold and artful man and fearing to be led in triumph by this powerful conqueror she killed herself Egypt was then go∣verned by the Romans and was to Rome what Peru has been to Spain and Bengal is to England supply∣ing Italy with gold and silver in such abundance that provisions merchandize and lands were doubled in value thus hastening the ruin of the empire  In proportion as the Romans narrowed its limits they adopted the vices and customs of the conquered people Egypt was the kingdom that influenced their manners most because it procured them most wealth Fine linens and cotton cloths made at Alexandria superb carpets and variegated crystals were trans∣ported to Rome while the abundant productions of the Thebais supplied the proud city with provisions After this she had neither manufactures nor agricul∣ture and in a few years was surrounded like Eng∣land with immense parks and by gardens on the spots that dictators had ploughed and inhabited their rustic mansions delicious groves cascades parterres and palaces were beheld Asiatic effeminacy ener∣vated the proud republicans In vain did the wisest of their emperors endeavour to resist the torrent nations paid them tribute Egypt gave them corn and they imagined they had only to receive the la∣bours of the conquered and the earth's homage Its expiring ray freedom extinguished by  Augustus  gave place to slavery and all its consequent views The Romans became less desirous of commanding than of enjoying festivals and shows The thirst of gold completed corruption all was venality at Rome soldiers and armies were bought and the praetorian bands set the empire to sale  To Byzantium  Constantine  transported the seat of empire which soon became divided and its destruc∣tion followed Egypt long was the tottering throne of Constantinople and furnished its sovereign with re∣sources against its numerous enemies The time however approached when the glory of Egypt to∣gether with commerce agriculture and arts was to decline  Mahomet  possessed of a genius equal to revolu∣tions so vast created a religion for the nations of Ara∣bia scattered over the desarts which was to arm against the whole world History affords not an instance of another mission so audacious Death cut short his ex∣ploits but his successors animated by his example and healed by the enthusiasm he had communicated overthrew neighbouring nations conquered Egypt and a part of the East  Become a province under the califs Egypt gradu∣ally lost her commerce and arts In her present state groaning under the tyranny of the beys she cannot profit by her situation to rival the Europeans who have discovered new passages to that quarter of the globe from whence she drew her richest commodities Her ignorant mariners far from navigating the In∣dian scarcely dare venture over the Red Sea their greatest effort says  Savary  is their annual voyage to  Moka where there ill armed saicks incapable of de∣fence are laden with the coffee of Yemen the mus∣lins and cloths of Bengal brought them by the Ban∣yans the perfumes of Arabia and the pearls of the isles of Beharim The coffee they buy for fourpence per pound at Moka they sell for fifteen pence at Cairo and this article alone amounts to half a mil∣lion sterling  Egypt even in a decline however appears re∣spectable because she contains within herself the true source of wealth Her corn with which she supplies Arabia Syria and a part of the Archipelago her rice sent over the Mediterranean her carthamus flowers with which the people of Provence annually load several ships her sal ammoniac transported through all Egypt her abundant souda her excel∣lent flax esteemed by the Italians her blue cloths that cloath in part the neighbouring nations all are objects that will make the balance of trade in her fa∣vour The Abyssinians bring her gold dust ele∣phant's teeth and other precious commodities which they exchange for her productions The cloths lead arms and some gold lace from Lyons which French ships bring do not equal what they receive they pay the balance in Turkish piastres The merchandize imported by the Turks is far below what they take in return and the difference is paid in ready money  Except Moka and Mecca where the Egyptians leave a great part of their sequins all who trade with them bring silver and gold So plentiful are these metals that  Ali  bey flying to Syria carried with him three millions and a half sterling and  Ismael  bey escaping some years after loaded fifty camels with sequins pa∣tacas a coin worth about five shillings pearls and jewellery  If destitute of shipping and manufactures Egypt is still so wealthy what might she not be govern∣ed by an enlightened people What an influx of prosperity would there arise from opening her canals repairing her mounds and restoring to agricul∣ture a third of the grounds buried under the fands what wealth from opening her mines of emeralds famous for almost equalling the diamond in dura∣tion With what utility might her indigo carthamus and other substances excellent for dying scattered through her desarts be employed These are not chi∣merical riches Egypt has possessed them for ages and a wise administration would restore all the proli∣fic treasures of nature  It may not be amiss here to give a more particular description of the caravans extracted from Major  Rooke  's entertaining narrative who crossed the desart with one from Suez to Grand Cairo A caravan  says he signifies an assemblage of camels horses mules men and other animals who are formed into large bodies for the sake of mutual protection and as they travel in some parts for two or three months together over waste and barren desarts yielding nothing for the support of either man or beast are obliged to take all necessaries with them and parti∣cularly water it is on these occasions that they find the superior excellence of the camel to all other ani∣mals not only from its great strength and unwearied perseverance but from that property it has of sustain∣ing thirst for several days These annual caravans which go from Aleppo and Cairo to Mecca are often composed of thirty or forty thousand people and are under military government An officer being ap∣pointed by the Grand Signior called the Emir Hagj as we have before remarked who conducts and com∣mands them the order of march is regular and by ranks the discipline is very exact and a guard of Janissaries with fieldpieces form the escort they have regular times of marching and halting which is done by signal When they take up their ground for the night tents are pitched kitchens cookshops and coffeehouses are immediately erected and a large camp is formed every thing is as quickly packed up and the camels are loaded in the morning to be ready for gunfiring which puts the whole body in motion The caravan from Cairo performs its journey to  Mecca in forty days where having staid about a month to celebrate the Hadji a festival in which both the interests of trade and religion are equally consulted it returns in the same order stopping at Medina in the way back to pay a visit to and make offerings at the shrine of  Mahommed  that having been the place of his interment as Mecca was of his nati∣vity  The caravan from Suez to Cairo being under no regulations is an irregular and straggling body con∣sisting of about one thousand camels and half as many men we set out says he about noon travelling on till eight at night we then took up the ground the camels eased of their burthens placed themselves round their food  couchant  with their legs under them and the men in the same order formed their messes the cara∣van was in motion by three the next morning and travelled on without making one single halt even to give the camels water or food till nine at night some conjecture may from hence be formed of the power of that animal the pace we went at seemed to be nearly four miles an hour and this was continued for eighteen hours together My travelling carriage was termed a  Kushob  To compare small things with great it resembled the body of a coach with an open∣ing between the two seats for the back of the camel on which it was placed longitudinally so that one seat  hung on one side the other on the other and on each sits a person I had a canopy over the top in which I found singular use as the heat of the sun was into∣lerable and though I could not be conveyed in a manner more favourable to my feelings lying along on mattrasses and pillows placed over the seat yet the uneasy motion of the camel the heat of the wea∣ther and the excessive drought I experienced ren∣dered it the most unpleasant journey I ever made  The distance from Suez to Cairo is eighty miles and is always a three day's journey for loaded camels but our's not being loaded they made the journey in little more than half the time Having explained the mode of travelling it will not require many words to describe a country uniformly barren and sandy some part of the way lay through a narrow valley which appeared to be the bed of the canal that was made to join the Mediterranean with the Red Sea and come into the latter at Suez a great number of petrified branches of trees and pieces of wood are met with on the road with here and there a carcase which is the vultures' prey and in some parts a few stunted shrubs every one in these journies goes armed as the caravans are frequently attacked and plundered by the wild Arabs who strip the people and leave them to perish on the desart a circum∣stance  that happened to several of our countrymen a few years ago in the following melancholy manner  A contraband trade had for some years been car∣ried on by the English people from India to Cairo much to their advantage and as much to the prejudice of our commerce from thence to Europe several ships came annually to Suez with cargoes from India and though there was a firman of the Grand Signior to whom the port belongs strictly forbidding all fo∣reign ships or Christians to approach Suez yet as the pacha of Cairo and the chief bey found their in∣terest in this illicit trade they suffered the firman to sleep which it did till a new pacha was sent from Constantinople with strict orders to enforce it where∣on the following tragical event befel the Englishmen when they came next to Suez with their accustomed merchandize not aware of this change of men and measures at Cairo they landed the cargoes of their ships at Suez paid the duties and set off They tra∣velled on the first day with security pleasing them∣selves probably with the visionary wealth which the goods were to produce and little thinking how sad a reverse the next morning's light would occasion scarce had they moved off the ground where they passed the night when they were surrounded by a large body of men plundered wounded stripped and left naked in the desart the camels with all their effects water  PLUNDERING a CARAVAN  and provisions being taken off by the robbers in this piteous plight they consulted what was best to be done the only alternative being whether they should return to Suez or proceed to Cairo they impru∣dently resolved on the latter to which the distance was double that to Suez to this place two only of the company wiser than the rest made good their re∣treat the others went towards Cairo at the instance of a commander of one of the ships who told them that he knew the way across the desart and that by going straight to Cairo and laying their case before the government they would stand a better chance of recovering their goods he gave the first proof how bad his counsel was for being soon spent with heat and fatigue he dropped and died Being without their pilot the rest had but little chance of finding their way across the desart where there is hardly a track indeed had they known it perfectly it would have availed them little naked and exposed to the scorching beams of an African sun in the month of August without a drop of water to allay the raging thirst they must have experienced all perished ex∣cept one who arriving spent and speechless at some Arabs huts about a league from Cairo the people there took a great deal of care of him and partly re∣covered him he could scarcely articulate the name of the person to whose house he wished to go and when he arrived he was scarcely known so disguised  was he with his sufferings which he did not get the better of in a twelvemonth  The cruelty and weakness of a government that inflicts punishment in the miserable manner above re∣lated is highly culpable for such was the mode a∣dopted by the pacha and bey to put in force the fir∣man of the Grand Signior they themselves in fact plundered the caravan by means of their soldiers whom they sent on this errand and appropriated the spoil to their own use they contrived likewise to get possession of the English ships by an artifice of the same dark nature and imprisoned the crews The go∣vernment of Cairo which by openly seizing the ef∣fects of the people who came there contrary to the orders of the Grand Signior and contrary to the laws of their own country would have acted properly may justly stand taxed with the greatest inhumanity for the conduct they observed and fearful that it might draw on them the resentment of the English who with a single frigate could destroy the whole of their trade in the Red Sea they obliged all the Englishmen who were then at Cairo to bind themselves under the penalty of a considerable sum that no step should be taken to revenge what had happened making them find a merchant who resided at Cairo to be surety for them  No Christian ships have come to Suez since this af∣fair a frigate with dispatches from India came to Cosire about two years after but the person charged with them being contraband was imprisoned by the pacha at Cairo and sent to Constantinople for the firman not only forbids foreign ships and particularly English from approaching the port of Suez but all Christians declaring "That the sea of Suez was de∣signed for the noble pilgrimage of Mecca and that the port thereof is a port of two illustrious cities which are those that make the light of the truth to shine and the law of the prophet and are established to promote religion and justice Mecca the enlighten∣ed and Medina the honoured wherefore it says let such Christians as come there be imprisoned and their effects confiscated and let no one endeavour to set them free"  I little imagined says  Rooke  when I made those ob∣servations respecting the oppression and tyranny of the Egyptian government that I should in my own per∣son so soon give proof of what I have advanced but thus it happened and the following adventure which I met with may serve to give a tolerable idea of its equity  In one of my rides about the city I was met by a party of Turkish soldiers who accosting me and some  European friends who were of my party said that by order of their master  Mustapha  Bey they were come in search of us and that they must immediately conduct us to him We did not at all relish this salutation and would gladly have been excused the honour of paying a visit to the Bey but having no alternative we proceeded quietly under their escort We were not it may be readily supposed extremely comfort∣able in this situation and in our way endeavoured to divine the cause of it but in vain we found we had nothing else to do than to submit patiently and wait the event Being arrived at the Bey's palace my companions were set at liberty and I only detained one of my friends however stayed with me to act as interpreter and plead my cause We were now ushered into the presencechamber and found this potentate sitting crosslegged on a carpet smoaking a pipe seven or eight feet long he was a middle aged man rather corpulent had a black and bushy beard that reached below his breast and his countenance was handsome although stern and severe his myrmidons who were bearded like himself stood in a circle round him into the midst of which we were introduced  The Bey being informed that I was the person he had summoned surveyed me attentively and with an imperious tone of voice pronounced my crime and my sentence in the same breath telling me an  Armenian merchant having represented to him that an Englishman who had passed through Cairo two years before owed him a sum of money his orders were that I should immediately discharge the debt in∣curred by my countryman I heard with astonishment this extraordinary charge and verdict and in reply endeavoured to explain the hardship and injustice of such a proceeding telling him that in the first place I doubted much whether the debt claimed by the Ar∣menian was just and in the second supposing it was I did not consider myself by any means bound to discharge it but all endeavours to exculpate myself on the principles of reason or justice were totally useless since he soon removed all my arguments by a short decision which was that without further cere∣mony I must either consent to pay the money or re∣main prisoner in his castle I began then to enquire what the sum was which the Armenian pretended to be due to him and found it to be near five hundred pounds at which price high as it was I believe I should have been induced to have purchased my li∣berty had not my friend advised me to the contrary and given me hopes that it might be obtained without it recommending me rather to suffer a temporary confinement than submit to so flagrant an extortion Accordingly I protested against paying the money and was conducted under a guard into a room where I remained in arrest  It was about noon the usual time of dining in this country and a very good pilau with mutton was served up to me in short I was very civily treated in my confinement but still it was a confinement and as such could not fail of being extremely unplea∣sant my only hopes were founded in the good offices of an Italian merchant whose services to me and many of my countrymen who had been embroiled in affairs of the like nature here deserve our warmest gratitude  My apartment was pleasantly situated with a fine view of the Nile and a rich country but I should have enjoyed the prospect much more upon another occasion On a kind of lawn shaded with trees in front of the castle two or three hundred horses stood at picquet richly caparisoned belonging to the Bey and his guards His principal officers and slaves came to visit me and in talking over my case they agreed it was very hard but to comfort me said that their master was a very good prince and would not keep me long confined I found several of them plea∣sant liberal minded men and we conversed together very sociably through my Arabian servant who re∣mained with me  The people in this country always sleep after din∣ner till near four o'clock they then rise wash and  pray that time of prayer is called by them  Asser  and is the common hour of visiting the beys then give audience and transact business  Mustapha  Bey now sent for me again and seeming to be in good humour endeavoured to coax me into a payment of the demand he made but I continued firm in my re∣fusal on which he changed the subject and smiling asked me if I should not like to be a Mussulman tell∣ing me it was much better than being a Christian and hinted that I should be very well off if I would be∣come one of them and stay at Cairo using likewise other arguments to effect my conversion and all this in a jocular laughing manner While he was pro∣ceeding in his endeavours to bring me over to his faith two officers came from  Ibrahim  the chief Bey to procure my release My worthy friend the Italian merchant having very good interest with him had made application in my behalf and in consequence these two ambassadors were sent to request that  Musta∣pha  Bey would deliver me up to them but he seemed by no means inclinable so to do and resuming his former sternness of look remained for some time in∣exorable till at length wrought on by their en∣treaties he consented to let me go observing at the same time whenever he had an opportunity of making a little money  Ibrahim  Bey always interfered and pre∣vented him a pretty observation From which may be inferred that they look upon  us  as fair plunder  and do not give themselves much trouble to find out a pretence to found their claims  The English seem particularly to have been victims to this species of rapine owing to the facility with which they always submit to it and many of our wealthy countrymen having returned by this road laden with the spoils of India these beys have fre∣quently fleeced them allured by the temptations of that wealth which these Nabobs are so fond of dis∣playing various are the instances of extortion prac∣tised on them Our readers may form an idea of all when we mention one of a gentleman who passing by Suez in his way to England that he might not be de∣tained there by the searching of his baggage pre∣vailed on the customhouse officers to dispense with it and only put their seals on his trunks to exempt them from being visited till his arrival at Cairo where being come fatigued with his journey and impatient to shift himself he would not wait for the inspection of the officers but broke the seals to get his clothes and paid a thousand pounds for the luxury of a clean shirt an hour before he otherwise would have had it  When I hear says  Rooke  of the heavy fines that have been levied on my countrymen in their passage through Egypt I consider myself happy in being quit for a confinement of only a few hours and fifty pounds  given in fees to different people employed in the task of procuring my release  From  Mustapha  Bey's palace I was conducted to that of the chief Bey being attended by an officer of the former who was sent with me  Ibrahim  was sitting in a small apartment richly furnish∣ed smoaking his pipe and was accompanied by two other Turks he appeared to be between forty and fifty years of age middle sized and handsome and is reckoned a man of ability He addressed himself to  Mustapha  Bey's officer inveighing severely against the conduct of his master then turning to me said I might depend on his protection during the remainder of my stay in that country and finding my purpose was to go down the Nile and to Alex∣andria he gave me a passport to exempt me from any trouble or molestation I might receive on my passage Having made my proper acknowledgments to this prince for his civilities I retired not a little rejoiced to have regained my liberty  Owing to this kind of rapine and extortion prac∣tised by these potentates and likewise to the firman of the Grand Signior forbidding European ships to ap∣proach the port of Suez this channel of communi∣cation betwixt Europe and India has been shut for some years past a circumstance extremely detri∣mental  to us since it is by far the most expeditious way of conveying intelligence and by proper manage∣ment might still be made use of for that purpose some presents annually sent by the India company to the chief Bey who is in fact the king of the coun∣try would ensure safety to their servants who might pass charged with dispatches and when it is known that the passage to Madras has been made by way of Suez in sixtythree days it is surprizing such an ad∣vantage should be overlooked if possible to be ob∣tained not that it would be adviseable to make it a common road for passengers or permit any other ships to go to Suez but small packet boats for the purpose of conveying dispatches for otherwise a door would be opened to a contraband trade which would prove extremely prejudicial to the commerce of the India company and the revenue of our go∣vernment  CHAP X  History and Government  THE Egyptians are certainly a very ancient na∣tion though far from being so ancient as they pretend when they give us a catalogue of princes who according to their account must have existed several thousand years before the creation but as it has been suggested by some writers if the Egyptians by years intended only periodical revolutions of the moon and not of the sun their difference of reckon∣ing may be more easily reconciled Besides it has been long observed of the Chinese and other king∣doms who remount their origin so very high that they give no authentic account of these pretended an∣cient times but refer the first rise of all arts and sci∣ences to the same date with ourselves  It is however generally agreed that the princes of the line of  Pharaoh  were the first sovereigns of Egypt They are supposed to be descended from  Cham  the son of  Noah  who was the  Jupiter Ammon  of the  Egyptians and  Misraim  his grandson their great deity  Osiris  The line of  Pharaoh  reigned in Egypt till it was conquered by  Cambyses  two hundred and fifty years before Christ In the possession of the kings of Persia it continued till the time of  Darius  when it was taken from them by  Alexander  the Great At his death the province of Egypt fell to the share of  Ptolemy  whose successor ever after retained that name In this line it continued till the famous  Cleo∣patra  ascended the throne the wife and sister of  Pto∣lemy Dionysius  the last king After the death of  Cleo∣patra  who had been mistress successively to  Julius Coesar  and  Mark Anthony  Egypt became a Roman pro∣vince for near seven hundred years when the Sara∣cens took it in The famous library of Alexan∣dria said to have consisted of volumes was collected by  Ptolemy Philadelphus  son of the first  Pto∣lemy  and the same prince caused the old testament to be translated into Greek this translation is known by the name of the Septuagint version  During the Crusades in the twelfth century Egypt was governed by  Noreddin  whose son the famous  Sa∣ladin  was so dreadful to the christian adventurers and retook from them Jerusalem This prince instituted the military corps of Mamluks who soon after mas∣sacred the descendants of  Saladin  and usurped the go∣vernment into their own hands These Mamluks  changed the form of government into a republic They elected however a chief in whom they con∣sided great authority Egypt continued in their pos∣session till when Sultan  Selim  made a conquest of the country and it has ever since been tributary to the Turks  But before we speak of the present government in Egypt it may be necessary to give some clear and precise idea of the Mamluks This appellation is bestowed on children who carried off by merchants or banditti from Georgia Circassia Natolia and the various provinces of the Ottoman empire are after∣wards sold in Constantinople and Grand Cairo The grandees of Egypt who have a similar origin bring them up in their houses and destine them to succeed to their dignities These foreigners at present can alone enjoy the title of Bey and fill the offices of state The law is so precise that even the son of a Bey cannot be raised to this eminent station he therefore usually embraces the profession of arms The divan assigns him a proper maintenance and names him son of the country  The Mamluks are most of them born of christian parents but are forced to embrace Mahometanism and suffer circumcision They have an excellent edu∣cation given them so that they may be capable of ex∣ercising  the offices they are to fill They rise usually by their merit through the various trusts in the house of the Beys till they arrive at the post of Ca∣chef or Lieutenant of the Beys when they govern the towns dependent on their patrons at which time they are permitted to buy Mamluks who follow their fortune and become their companions and instru∣ments Their next rise is to the dignity of Bey which gives them a seat among the four and twenty members of the Divan or council of the republic  On seeing them subsist in this country for several centuries says  Volney  we should be led to imagine their race is preserved by the ordinary means but if their first establishment was a singular event their con∣tinuation is not less extraordinary During five hun∣dred and fifty years that there have been monarchs in Egypt not one of them has left subsisting issue there does not exist one single family of them in the second generation all their children perish in the first or second descent Almost the same thing happens to the Turks and it is observed they can only secure the continuance of their families by marrying women who are natives which the Mamluks have always disdained  The wives of the Mamluks are like them slaves brought from Georgia Mongrelia c Their beauty  is a constant topic among us and we must believe it on the credit of fame But a European says  Vol∣ney  who has only been in Turkey has no right to give his testimony on the subject These women are more invisible here than the others and to this circumstance their reputation for beauty is greatly owing A lady wife of one of the French merchants at Cairo who by dealing in laces and Lyons' stuffs had access to all the harems assured me says  Volney  that among a thousand or twelve hundred chosen wo∣men she had seen she had not found ten real beauties But the Turks are not difficult provided a woman be fair she is handsome and if she be fat she is en∣chanting "her countenance is like the full moon her haunches are like cushions" say they to express the superlative of beauty They may be said to mea∣sure them by the quintal They have besides a pro∣verb worthy the notice of naturalists "Take a fair female for thy eyes but for pleasure an Egyptian"  Let the naturalist explain why men well formed and married to healthy women are unable to natu∣ralize on the banks of the Nile a race born at the foot of mount Caucasus And let it be remembered at the same time that the plants of Europe in that country are equally unable to continue their species Some may refuse to believe this extraordinary fact but it is no less certain nor does it appear to be new  The ancients have made observations of the same na∣ture thus when  Hippocrates  asserts that among the Scythians and Egyptians all the individuals resemble each other though they are like no other nations when he adds that in the countries inhabited by these two races of men the climate seasons aliments and soil possess a uniformity no where else to be found does he not recognise that kind of exclusion When such countries impress so peculiar a character on every thing native is it not a reason why they should reject whatever is foreign It seems then that the only means of naturalizing animals and plants would be to contract an affinity with the climate by alliance with the native species and this the Mamluks have constantly refused The means therefore by which they are perpetuated and multiplied are the same by which they were first established that is to say when they die they are replaced by slaves brought from their original country  Sultan  Selim  having conquered Egypt and defeated the Mamluks caused their king to be hanged at the gates of Cairo This barbarous action disgusted them so much that they only waited his departure again to take up arms Reflecting afterwards on his error that he might gain their goodwill he granted them very peculiar privileges specified in a treaty and made very little change in their form of government  The four and twenty Beys were to govern as be∣fore except that a bashaw from the Porte was to re∣side at Grand Cairo with whom it was required they should deliberate from time to time on the state of public affairs but if he attempted to infringe their privileges they might suspend him They were like∣wise to furnish a stipulated body of troops to the Ot∣toman court if it were attacked and further to pay a certain tribute but in other respects they were left entirely to their own government  The Beys feel the power they possess which they dreadfully abuse The pacha remains no longer than while he is subservient to their designs should he dare to speak in defence of his master's interests or those of the Egyptians he becomes a statecriminal the divan assembles and he is expelled The follow∣ing is the manner in which they receive and eject those representatives of the Grand Signior  When a new pacha lands at Alexandria he gives notice of his arrival to the council of the republic some of the Beys of most address are then sent to compliment him bring him presents and profess great submission While they attend on him they artfully sound his inclinations and endeavour to learn from his own mouth or that of his officers what are the orders he brings Should they find them inimical to  their own purposes they expedite a courier to the chief Bey who assembles the divan and the pacha is forbidden to proceed further They then write to the Grand Signior that the new governor comes with hostile intentions and such as will excite rebellion among his faithful subjects and request his recall which is sure to be complied with When the chiefs of the republic believe they have nothing to fear from the pacha they invite him to Grand Cairo the de∣puties place him in a sumptuous galley and escort him all the way The attendant boats are elegantly tilted and filled with musicians He advances slowly at the head of the fleet no vessel being allowed to pass that of the pacha Those who are unfortunately making a voyage up the Nile are obliged to fol∣low in his suite He stops at Helai a small village below Boulac where the Sheik El Balad  i e  chief Bey comes himself to receive him or deputes several fangiacs The heads of the republic again congratu∣late him on his landing the Aga of the Janissaries presents him the keys of the castle prays him to make it his residence and he is conducted in pomp through the city I have seen says  Savary  and therefore can describe the entrance of a pacha  The various corps of infantry with their noisy mu∣sic march first in two files their colours waving the cavalry follow About five or six thousand horse∣men  advance in good order their clothing made of very bright stuffs while their floating robes enormous mustachoes and long lances of shining steel give them a majestic and warlike appearance Then come the Beys magnificently clothed and attended by their Mamluks mounted on Arabian horses highly mettled and adorned with housings embroidered in gold and silver the bridles of those of the chiefs are bedecked with fine pearls and precious stones and their saddles with glittering gold The various retinues of each Bey were very elegant the beauty of the youth the richness of their dress and their excellent horseman∣ship all together formed a very agreeable sight The pacha closed the march advancing gravely preceded by two hundred horsemen a band of music and four led horses slowly guided by slaves on foot covered with housings most richly embroidered in gold and pearls thrt trailed on the ground The pacha mount∣ed on a beauteous barb wore a cluster of large dia∣monds in his turban which darted back the sun's rays This procession may convey some idea of the oriental pomp and magnificence of the ancient mo∣narchs of Asia when they shewed themselves in pub∣lic It began about eight and lasted till noon  On the morrow the pacha assembled the divan and invited the beys to be present he sat on a raised seat with a barred window like the Grand Signior  His Kiaya or lieutenant read the orders of the Porte and the sangines profoundedly bowing promised obe∣dience in all things which should not infringe their rights This ended a collation was served and when the assembly rose the pacha presented the Sheik El Balad with a rich furred robe and a horse magni∣ficently caparisoned also caftans to the other Beys Such is the ceremony of installation for a pacha  His office is a kind of banishment he cannot leave his palace without the permission of the Sheik El Ba∣lad but is a stateprisoner who in the midst of splen∣dor cannot avoid feeling the weight of his chains His revenue amounts to near l and is raised from the duties paid at Suez on the merchandize of the Red Sea  The ambition of the Beys presents him with an abundant source of wealth when possessing political cunning and a knowledge of his own means he has the art to sow dissention among the chiefs and form parties Each will exert their endeavours to obtain his interest and wealth will pour in upon him The sangiacs named by the divan also purchase a confir∣mation of their dignity from the pacha and the inhe∣ritance of those who die without issue appertains to him  Thus may the Grand Signior's representative main∣tain himself in office and become immensely rich pro∣vided he proceeds with circumspection for the ground on which he stands is so slippery that the least wrong step occasions his fall and some unforeseen circum∣stances will often counteract his utmost policy Should some young audacious sangiac vanquish the party favoured by the pacha and arrive at the dignity of Sheik El Balad he assembles the council and the go∣vernor is ignominiously expelled His order to de∣part is entrusted to an officer cloathed in black who carrying it in his bosom advances into the audience chamber and taking up a corner of the carpet which covers the sofa bows profoundedly and says  Insel Pacha i e come down Pacha  which having said he departs The governor is immediately obliged to pack up and retire in the space of fourandtwenty hours to Boulac where he waits for orders from Constantinople His person is generally safe but should the prevailing Beys have complaints against him they make him render a severe account of his ad∣ministration and the presents he has received after which they divide the spoil The council of the re∣public elects a Caimakan during the interregnum to supply his place till the arrival of a new pacha  An attempt was made a few years since to deprive the Ottoman Porte of its authority over Egypt by  Ali  Bey whose father was a Greek priest of one of the most distinguished families of the country Hav∣ing turned Mahometan and being a man of abilities and address he rendered himself extremely popular in Egypt A false accusation having been made a∣gainst him soon after he was raised to the dignity of Bey orders were sent from Constantinople to take off his head Being apprized of the design he had the messenger put to death who brought the order and soon found means to put himself at the head of an army and being also assisted by the dangerous situa∣tion to which the Turkish empire was reduced in consequence of the war with Russia he boldly mount∣ed the throne of the ancient sultans of Egypt But not content with this he also laid claim to Syria Pa∣lestine and that part of Arabia which belonged to them  The occasion of his assuming the sovereignty of Egypt is related by  Savary  as follows In the Russians declared war against the Turks and sent their fleets into the Mediterranean  Ali  who was Sheik El Balad according to the ancient stipulation when the country was conquered from the Mamluks raised twelve thousand men to assist the Porte which cir∣cumstance his enemies endeavoured to turn to his destruction They wrote to the divan that the troops he had assembled were to serve in the Russian armies  with whom he had entered into an alliance and the latter was signed by several of the Beys The ca∣lumny was credited and a Capigibachi immediately sent with four attendants for the head of  Ali  Hap∣pily for him he had a faithful agent in the council who instantly sent off two couriers the one by land the other by sea to advertise him of the treachery They outstripped the messengers of the Grand Signior and  Ali  sent for  Tentaoui  one of his confidents informed him of the secret ordered him to assume the disguise of an Arab and with twelve Mamluks wait the arri∣val of the messengers from Constantinople twenty miles from Cairo seize their dispatches and put them to death  Tentaoui  performed his mission having waited some time at the appointed place he saw the Capigibachi and his attendants approach seized them and their fatal order murdered them and buried their bodies in the sand  Having the firman in his possession  Ali  assembled the Beys and after reading it to them addressed them in the following animated speech "How much lon∣ger says he shall we be the victims of Ottoman des∣potism What faith can we put in the treaites of the Porte Not many years since several of the Beys were assassinated contrary to all justice some of you were present and bear about with you the marks of that massacre The marble we tread is red with the  blood of four of your colleagues To day I am to die and tomorrow the man who shall supply my place The hour is come for us to shake off this ty∣rant's yoke who violating our privileges and laws dispenses with our lives at his pleasure Let us unite ourselves with Russia and free the republic from the dominions of a barbarous master Grant me your aid and I will be responsible for the liberty of Egypt"  This produced its wished for effect Sixteen Beys who were of  Ali  's party unanimously declared for  on the Grand Signior and the rest un∣  oppose promised every assistance in their power The pacha was ordered to quit Egypt in four and twenty hours and the standard of independence was immediately raised  Whilst  Ali  was engaged in subduing the neighbour∣ing provinces of Arabia and Syria he was no less at∣tentive to the establishment of a regular form of go∣vernment and introducing order into a country that had long been the seat of anarchy and confusion His views were equally extended to commerce for which purpose he gave great encouragement to merchants and abolished some scandalous restraints and indigni∣ties to which they were before exposed His great design it is supposed was to make himself master of the Red Sea to make Suez a free port particularly  for the Europeans and to make Egypt once more the great centre of commerce The conduct and views of  Ali  shewed an extent of thought and ability and bespoke a mind equal to the founding of an empire but he was not finally successful  Though at the summit of grandeur  Ali  forgot not his parents Having made his peace with the Porte he ordered one of his generals who was going into Natolia to bring back his father and family Hear∣ing of their arrival at Boulac he went to meet them with a numerous train and as soon as he perceived the aged  Daoud  he descended from his horse ran and fell on his knees and kissed his feet The father wept with joy it was the happiest day of his life and  Ali  embraced his sister and nephew This tender scene over he conducted them to his palace and the Mamluks contended who should wash the feet of their master's father When they had cloathed him in magnificent robes he was led into the harem and re∣ceived the most affectionate caresses from the wife of  Ali Daoud  mounted on a fine horse was conducted to the hall of the divan the beys and even the pa∣cha complimented and made him presents After re∣maining seven months in Egypt he wished to return to his native country whither  Ali  sent him on board a vessel loaded with riches Incidents like these which have a great resemblance to the history of  Joseph  when he went to meet his father in Goshen are often renewed in Egypt  Ali  's wife was a female slave from Red Russia who was very beautiful her flaxen hair reached to the ground her figure was tall and noble her complexion of the purest white her eyes blue and her eyebrows black but these were the least of the treasures which nature had bestowed on the youthful  Maria  her mind was superior to her form Her unhappy fate never could make her condescend to gratify the desires of her master he spoke of his power she shewed she was free though in chains he wished to dazzle by his splendor but she was insen∣sible to pomp and grandeur Charmed with a haugh∣tiness so congenial to his nature he became her lover and offered her his hand if she would renounce chris∣tianity but though not without affection for a man who had treated her according to her deserts she still had the fortitude to refuse At last he permitted her to retain her religion provided she would not profess it publickly and obtained her consent and so great was his love for her that he never had any other wife  Ali  was for a long time very fortunate in all his enterprizes against the neighbouring Asiatic pa∣chas whom he repeatedly defeated but was after∣wards deprived of the kingdom of Egypt by the base and ungrateful conduct of  Abou Dahab  who had long meditated his ruin This was a slave for whom  Ali  had a particular affection He had raised him to the  dignity of Bey and to give him a still further proof of his affection gave him afterwards his sister in marriage Aspiring however to the sovereign power he thought no means unjust by which he might rid himself of his patron The Beys of his faction knowing his ava∣rice gave him considerable sums to rid them of  Ali  but he conscious of his brother's vigilance the love of his adherents and the difficulties of his enterprize kept the gold and waited a more favourable oppor∣tunity but to ingratiate himself and blind his friend still farther he discovered the conspiracy The con∣sequences exceeded his expectations and the affec∣tions of  Ali  for the man to whom he thought he owed his life became excessive  Abou Dahab  how∣ever never lost sight of his detestable intents but en∣deavoured to seduce  Tentaoui  and offered him twelve thousand guineas to assassinate his patron when they were playing at chess  Tentaoui  immediately in∣formed  Ali  of the proposal at which so much was he prejudiced in his favour that he did but laugh Fail∣ing in this project he tried another and wished to force a wife to poison a brother she loved in a cup of coffee She rejected the proposal with horror and sent his faithful slave to conjure  Ali  to keep on his guard against  Abou  as his most dangerous enemy So many warnings ought to have rendered him suspici∣ous but his affection was extreme nor could he  credit crimes his heart disclaimed besides the bene∣fits he had conferred rendered him confident  The treachery of this villain and of another of his generals  Ismael  whom he had entrusted with the com∣mand of his troops and who went over to  Abou  preyed upon his mind he shuddered at the very name of  Abou Dahab  and his blood boiled in his veins Being obliged in consequence to fly Egypt he retreated to the dominions of Sheik  Daher  at Acre where he collected an army to make head against  Abou  This agitation and the fatigue of a painful march occasioned him to fall dangerously ill When he came in sight of  Abou Dahab  's army he arranged his troops in order of battle and ordered himself to be carried into his tent for he was too weak to sit on horseback Victory had declared for  Ali  when the Mograbians mercenary troops▪ who fight only for the lust of gain seduced by the magnificent promises of  Abou  went over to his side and the face of fortune was changed The flying rallied and having now only a small army to encounter surrounded them on all sides and made great slaughter His friends then rode up to his tent and conjured him to fly to Acre  Ali  answered fly my friends I command you as for me my hour is come Scarcely had they quitted him before the lieutenant of  Abou  entering sabre in hand  Ali  firing his pistol ended him Bathed in his blood  for two soldiers had before wounded him he fought like a lion when another from behind bringing him down with his sabre they fell upon him and carried him to the tent of the victor The traitor perfidious to the last shed feigned tears at beholding him thus and endeavoured to console him  Ali  turned away his eyes and spake not a word He died a week after of his wounds though some said he was poisoned by his infamous brotherinlaw if so this was the com∣pletion of his atrocious acts nor can we reflect with∣out shuddering on the horrors which ambition impels men to commit  Ali  was above the middle size his eyes were large and full of fire his manner was noble and winning and his character frank and generous Nature had endowed him with unconquerable fortitude and an elevated genius He fell the victim of friendship and his misfortunes were the consequence of having nurtured a traitor who profited by his benefactions to embitter and rob him of life Had Russia accepted the offers he made her and granted him engineers with three or four thousand men he would have sub∣dued Syria and Egypt and yielded the commerce of Arabia and India into the hands of his ally He perished at the age of fortyfive The Egyptians wept his death and saw themselves again the victims of miseries from which he had delivered them  Abou Dahab  was one morning soon after found dead in his bed whether by poison or otherwise is uncertain  CHAP XI  Of their Antiquities  BEFORE we quit Egypt it will be necessary to speak of the monuments that are most worthy of the curiosity of those who travel into this country we mean those pyramids that have been ranked formerly in the number of the seven wonders of the world that are admired still and that extend from Cairo to Meduun  These superb monuments are found only in Egypt for though there is one at Rome which serves for a tomb to  C Cestius  it can be considered only as a mere imitation and the least of those in Egypt surpasses it much in grandeur Thus it does not hinder us from  being able to assert that pyramids are found only in Egypt  Another general position is that we see pyramids only between Cairo and Meduun Some indeed have advanced that there were pyramids in Upper Egypt but they have been deceived says  Norden  by false memoirs or they were willing out of vain glory to have supposed to have penetrated places where no one else has been and to have seen what no one has since discovered  The pyramids are not situated in plains as is ge∣nerally supposed but upon the rock that is at the foot of the high mountains which accompany the Nile in its course and which make the separation between Egypt and Libya They have been all raised with with the same intention that is to serve for sepul∣chres but their architecture is extremely different with regard to the distribution the materials and the grandeur  Some are open others ruined and the greatest part of them are closed but there is none of them which has not been damaged in some of its parts  It is easily conceived that they could not have been all raised at the same time The prodigious  quantity of materials that it was necessary to collect renders the supposition extremely improbable The perfection with which the last are built shews it in like manner as they surpass the first very much in grandeur and magnificence All that can be ad∣vanced for certain is that their fabric is of the most remote antiquity and even more early than the times of the most ancient historians whose writings have been handed down to us That which these authors assert of the time of the building of the pyramids is founded on traditions more fabulous than probable It is a thing as wonderful as it is certain that they subsist to our time though the epoch of their foun∣dation was lost even at the time that the first Greek philosophers travelled into Egypt  If any one should think of maintaining that the most ancient pyramids must have been founded at the same time as the tower of Babel the notion would be thought a little extravagant But the pyramids would at least have this advantage that they subsist at present but there remain scarce any footsteps of that ancient tower  It appears probable says  Norden  that the origin of the pyramids even preceded that of the hieroglyphics And as they had no longer the knowledge of those characters at the time when the Persians made the con∣quest  of Egypt we must throw back the first epoch of the pyramids into times so remote in antiquity that vulgar chronology would find it difficult to fix the aera of their date  If we conjecture that the pyramids even the latest have been raised before they had the use of hierogly∣phics we do not make the assertion without some grounds to go upon Who can persuade himself that the Egyptians would have left such superb monuments without the least hieroglyphic inscriptionThey who were profuse of hieroglyphics upon all edifices of any importance Now there are none to be perceived either in the inside or outside of the pyramids nor even on the ruins of the temple of the second and third pyramid Is not this a proof that the origin of the pyramids is antecedent to that of the hierogly∣phics which are however considered as the first cha∣racters used in Egypt  There runs among the people in Egypt a tradition that there were anciently in this country giants and that they raised without much difficulty the pyramids temples and vast palaces whose remains occasion at present our admiration  This fable scarces deserves to be confuted its falsity appears at first sight But to obviate entirely  what might be said in its favour we shall only ob∣serve that if the country had been peopled by giants the entrance of the caves from whence they have drawn stones for these edifices must have been greater than they are that the gates of the ancient buildings still subsisting would have had in like manner more height and breadth for the more easy going in and coming out of the giants and that the passages of the pyramids so narrow at present that scarce a man of the present time can drag himself along when lying on his belly would have been by no means proper for men of such a stature  Besides nothing gives a more just idea of the sta∣ture of the men of that aera than the urn or the Sar∣cophagus in the greatest and last pyramid nearest to Grand Cairo This existing and irrefragable proof annihilates all those extravagant ideas that might be formed of the existence of giants It determines the size of the body of the prince for whom the pyramid was built and the passages of that pyramid further shew that the workmen were not of larger size than the prince since the entrance and the egress scarce give sufficient room for men of such a stature as they have at present  The principal pyramids are at the Southeast of Gaza and as several authors have pretended that  the city of Memphis was built on this spot they are universally denominated the pyramids of Memphis  There are four which are more particularly the ob∣ject of attention for though there are seven or eight others at no great distance yet they are not to be compared with these especially since they have been opened and almost entirely ruined The four prin∣cipal ones are almost upon the same diagonal line and distant from each other about four hundred paces The two most northerly pyramids are the largest and have five hundred feet perpendicular height The two others are much less but have some peculiarities which occasion their being examined and admired  The four faces of all the pyramids correspond precisely with the four cardinal points the North the South the East and the West The situation of these with their adjacent parts shews in what manner they have been raised upon the rock at the foot of the mountains The rock not having been thoroughly even has been smoothed by a chissel and this arti∣ficial plain has a sloping on the North and on the East sides to give convenience for transporting the materials necessary for the pyramids This plain may have about eighty feet of elevation above the horizon of the ground which is always overflowed  by the Nile and it has a Danish league in circum∣ference  The most Northern of these great pyramids is the only one that is open and as it is the first met with we shall begin with a description of it and then pro∣ceed to the others  The figure of a pyramid is so well known that it would be superfluous to attempt describing it we shall only observe that it is the most solid figure that it is possible to give to the main body of a building There is no destroying it but by beginning at the summit It rests on a basis too firm to be attacked in that part and whoever should attempt it would find as much difficulty as there was in raising it  The external part of the pyramid is chiefly built of great square stones laid upon each other without cramps cut out of the rock along the Nile and where even at this day we see the caves from whence they have taken them out  These stones are nothing near so hard as might be imagined on account of their having subsisted so long a time They owe their preservation properly to the climate where they are which is not subject to fre∣quent  rains Notwithstanding this advantage it may be observed on the North side that they are rotten  In the centre of the pyramid is a chamber which contains a tomb supposed to be that of  Cheops  king of Egypt founder of the pyramid being one entire piece of marble hollowed and uncovered at the top which sounds like a bell on being struck There are no signs of any corpse having been laid in it The interior part of this sarcophagus is six feet in length and two in depth and breadth It is not easy to conceive how this sarcophagus was brought into the place where it now stands it being impossible that it could have entered by the narrow passages which lead to this chamber It is therefore reasonable to suppose there must have been some other entrance so artfully stopped up as not to be discerned The dimensions of this chamber are thirtyfour feet in length seven∣teen in breadth and nineteen and a half in height  It is composed of more than two hundred layers of stone that recede in proportion to their height which is from four feet to two Of these stones some are above thirty feet in length These enormous steps must all be mounted to arrive at the summit This summit which to those who view it from below seems a point is a fine platform composed of ten or twelve massy stones and each side of that platform sixteen  or eighteen feet in length The area of this edifice is computed to be about the dimensions of the largest square in London and the height one third above that of St  Paul  's  The large one according to  Greaves  's measurement is seven hundred feet square covering about eleven acres of ground the inclined plane is equal to the base so that the angles and base make an equilateral triangle the perpendicular height as we have before observed is five hundred feet The apex is thirteen feet square  With what majesty says  Savary  do these mountains of man rise to the regions of air Awful in their age how often has the rising sun enlightened them scorched their burning sides at noon and gilded them as he sat During how many ages have they keeping pace with the inconceivably swift motion of the earth annually encircled this grand luminary Man then has constructed durable edifices and these edifices are tombs Thousands of ages hence if undisturbed by any grand revolution in the earth travellers from en∣lightned nations shall go to admire these vast monu∣ments and say Europe scarce had a few savages scat∣tered over her forests when a learned nation erected these superb mausoleums toward the four cardinal  points of heaven as monuments of its piety and as∣tronomical knowledge  The other three pyramids which are nearly of the same size do not appear ever to have been opened  Though an entrance has been discovered only into the largest pyramid yet most probably there is a way into the others and likewise apartments in them since  Strabo  tells us that in the middle of the pyramids there is a stone which may be taken out to open a a passage to the tombs Attempts have been made but without effect to discover an entrance into the se∣cond a great breach appearing in one of the sides of it  These four grand pyramids are surrounded by a number of other that are smaller and which appear to have been opened  Tavernier  tells us that the curiosity of strangers has been so great as to be desirous of visiting the in∣terior parts of some of these pyramids and that once the fellow that shewed them took an opportu∣nity to shut some Englishmen in and leave them there to die with want purposely to plunder them of their property Their bodies were not removed and soon after another party going on the same errand at∣tended  by a new exhibiter were struck motionless at the sight of the dead bodies of their countrymen We trust this will be sufficient to caution travellers not to let their curiosity get the better of their prudence  To the East of the second pyramid is the head of the great and famous Sphinx the whole body of which is buried in the sand the top of the back only to be seen which is above a hundred feet long and is of a single stone making part of the rock on which the pyramid rests Its head rises about seven and twenty feet above the sands  Mahomet  has taught the Arabs to hold all images of men or animals in detestation and they have disfigured the face with their arrows and lances The dimensions of this fi∣gure according to  Pliny  were as follow the circum∣ference of the head one hundred and two feet the length of the legs one hundred and thirtythree feet the height from the bottom of the belly to the sum∣mit of the head sixtythree feet and the head and neck twentyseven feet It is said to have been the tomb of  Amasis  but is more famous on account of the enigmatical oracles delivered from it to all who came thither to consult it and from the ambiguous terms in which they were couched have given rise to the proverbial expression  Sphinx's riddles  applied to any thing difficult to be solved At the top of the head there was originally a hole as likewise on the  back from whence issued the answers dictated by their priests who were placed within  What has been said concerning the judgment we ought to form of the pyramids may be applied to the labyrinth which  Herodotus  assures us was still more surprizing than the pyramids It was not so much one single palace as a magnificent pile composed of twelve palaces regularly disposed which had a com∣munication with each other Fifteen hundred rooms interspersed with terraces were ranged round twelve halls and discovered no outlet to such as went to see them There were the like number of buildings un∣der ground In order to visit the rooms and halls of the labyrinth it was necessary as the reader will naturally suppose for people to take the same pre∣caution as  Ariadne  made  Theseus  use when he was obliged to go and fight the minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete  This monument says  Savary  regarded by  Pliny  as the most astonishing effort of human genius is no more to be found Hereafter when Europe shall have restored to Egypt the sciences it thence received perhaps the sands and rubbish which hide the sub∣terranean part of the labyrinth will be removed and precious antiquities obtained If the dust of Hercu∣laneum an inconsiderable city has preserved so many  rarities and instructive remains of art and antiquity what may not be expected from the fifteen hundred apartments in which the archives of Egypt were de∣posited since the government assembled here to treat of the most important affairs of religion and of state  But the noblest and most wonderful of all the struc∣tures or works of the kings of Egypt was the lake of  Moeris  Accordingly  Herodotus  considers it as vastly superior to the pyramids and labyrinth This lake according to the above writer was six hundred and thirty stadia or seventyfive leagues in circum∣ference and three hundred feet deep This work the most useful and vast the earth ever contained united every advantage and supplied the defi∣ciences of a low inundation by detaining waters which would have been uselessly expended in the sea History knows not a work so glorious nor is it won∣derful antiquity esteemed it above the pyramids and labyrinth for with the grandeur of the enterprize it included the happiness of the people Thus the Egyptians who detested the kings by whom they were forced to remove mountains that pyramids might be raised blessed the memory of  Moeris  and his name is everlasting while the names of the founders of the pyramids are forgotten  In sailing up the Nile from Girge to Essuan oppo∣site the Carnac and about a league from the Nile are to be seen two colossal statues The first seems to re∣present a man and the second a woman In other respects they are both of the same size and that size is prodigious They are about fifty feet high from the bases of the pedestal to the summit of the head They are fitting on stones almost cubical fifteen feet high and as many in breadth including in them the Isiac figures which seem for ornament to the two corners of each stone The back part of each stone is higher than the fore part by a foot and a half  The pedestals are each five feet high thirtysix and a half long and nineteen and a half broad The dis∣tance between the two statues is twentyone paces  The breasts and legs of these statues are covered with abundance of Greek and Latin inscriptions which have been engraven on them since they were made and in the time of the Romans The purport of these inscriptions is to signify that the voice of  Memnon  has been heard by those persons whose names were affixed to them  On the North side of these colossuses are some ruins which no doubt are the remains of the palace of  Mem∣non  Among these ruins is the fragment of a colossus  thrown down and half buried The upper part is wanting and it appears that violence has been em∣ployed to separate it All the body of this colossus was of a single piece of black granite marble Its pedestal is in some measure entire and we saw on it some hieroglyphics such as knives semicircles and other figures The rest of this colossus says  Norden  is so disfigured and dismembered that it was not pos∣sibel for me to take an exact measure of it I ima∣gine however that its height is about twenty feet All these marks he adds seem to indicate that it is here we must seek for the vocal statue of  Memnon  which  Strabo Pausanias Philostratus Lucian Juvenal Tacitus  and divers other ancient authors Greek and Latin have mentioned As most of these authors re∣late that the statue of  Memnon  gave a certain sound at the rising of the sun I was curious to strike with a key upon what remains of this colossal figure but as the whole is solid it does not give any more sound than another block of granite which is sunk in the ground  The statue of  Memnon  had a lyre in his hands which was said to sound at sunrising and some phi∣losophers have supposed that the sun's light possesses a mechanical impulse so as to produce such sounds The statue was thrown down and cut in two by  Cam∣byses  to discover its internal structureIt stood in the temple of  Memnon  at Thebes  Strabo  's account of this statue is as follows Of two colossuses consisting of an entire stone and near to each other the one is still preserved but of the other the upper parts from the seat are fallen down occasioned as they say by an earthquake It is be∣lieved that once every day a noise as of a stroke but not a great one is made from the remaining part in the seat and base and I being on the spot with OELIUS GALLEY and a multitude of his friends and soldiers attending him about the first hour of the day heard a noise but whether from the base or the co∣lossus or whether it was made purposely by some one of those that stood round the base I cannot affirm On account of the uncertainty of the cause I am in∣clined to believe any thing rather than this that a sound is emitted from stones so disposed  Pape    Edit Paris  Between Cous and Essouan in Upper Egypt may be discovered the ruins of Thebes the magnificence of which poets and historians have alike been eager to describe The great  Diospolis  says  Diodorus Sicu∣lus  which the Greeks have named Thebes was six leagues in circumference The fame of its power and wealth celebrated by  Homer  has filled the world Its gates and the numerous vestibules of its temples occasioned this poet to give it the name of Hecatom∣polis Four principal temples are especially admired  there the most ancient of which was surprizingly grand and sumptuous Of these says  Savary  the re∣mains of one only are still extant It has eight en∣trances three of which have each a sphinx of enor∣mous size standing in front with two colossal statues on each side of the sphinx which are cut from a single block of marble in the antique taste Crossing these majestic avenues we come to four porticos each thirty feet wide fiftytwo in height and a hun∣dred and fifty in length Beyond these porticos the high walls which form the first court of the temple begin The people entered at twelve gates We then come to the second court which leads to the temple and by its extent equals the majesty of the building Standing at this place the astonished eye surveys the temple the height of which is most sur∣prizing in all its immensity Its walls of marble ap∣pear everlasting Its roof which rises in the centre is sustained by eighteen rows of columns Those standing under the most lofty part are thirty feet in circumference and eighty in height the others one third less  The world does not contain a building the cha∣racter and grandeur of which more forcibly impress awe and majesty it seems adequate to the high idea the Egyptians had formed of the supreme Being nor can it be entered or beheld but with reverence Its  sides both within and without are loaded with hier∣glyphics and extraordinary figures On the northern wall are representations of battles with horses and chariots one of which is drawn by stags On the southern are two barks with canopies at the end of which the sun appears the mariners guide them with poles two men seated at the stern seem to direct their proceedings and receive their homage  The entrance which fronts the temple is greatly decayed but if we may judge from the obelisks which remain it must have been most sumptuous There are two of sixty feet in height and twentyone in circumference at the base and a little farther two others of seventytwo feet in height and thirty in circumference Were the ground occupied by the various entrances porticos and courts appertaining to the temple measured we shall find the whole was at least half a league in circumference and that  Diodorus Siculus  was not deceived when he allowed it that extent  At the farther end of the plain on which the ruins stand is the village of Luxor near which are the ave∣nues and remains of another temple still more ruinous than the first Its extent is spacious and so are its courts which are entered under porticos supported by columns forty feet high without estimating the base  buried under the sand Pyramidical majestic gates abounding in hieroglyphics and rows of colossal mar∣ble figures forty feet high one third buried in the ground all declare what the magnificence of the prin∣cipal edifice the scite of which is known by a hill of ruins must have been But nothing can give a more sublime idea of the grandeur than the two obelisks which seem to have been placed there by giants or the genii of fable They are each a solid block of granite seventytwo feet high above the surface and thirtytwo in circumference but being sunk deep in the sand and mud they may well be supposed ninety feet from the base to the summit The hieroglyphics they contain do honour to the sculptor the hardness of the stone has preserved them from being injured by the air Nothing can be more majestic than these obelisks Egypt is the sole country in the world where men have performed works like these yet there is not a city on the face of the globe where they would not become its greatest ornament  Such are the most remarkable ornaments found at present on the eastern side of Thebes Their very aspect would awaken the genius of a polished nation but the Turks and Copts crushed to death beneath an iron sceptre behold them without astonishment and build huts which can scarce screen them from the sun in their neighbourhood These barbarians if  they want a millstone do not blush to overturn a co∣lumn which supports a temple or portico and saw it in pieces  On the western side of this once magnificent city are the grottos or tombs of the ancient monarchs of the Thebais  Diodorus  reckons fortyseven of them but only nine are at present open the rest having been closed up The subterranean galleries leading to them are in general ten feet high and as many in breadth The walls and roof cut in a white rock preserve the brilliant polish of stucco The second grotto is spacious and much embellished containing on the ceiling numerous golden stars birds painted in colours which seem to have lost nothing of their freshness and brilliancy and hieroglyphics divided in columns and engraved in the walls Two men are seated beside the gate the passage to which is a long gentle declivity A block of red granite six∣teen feet high ten long and six wide forms the sarco∣phagus of the king who is sculptured in bas relief on the top of the tomb with an hieroglyphic inscription There is one exceedingly fine grotto which contains only a marble lid ten feet long and six wide and in the further part of the most distant cavern is a human figure with the arms crossing the breast and two others kneeling one on each side  These galleries and subterranean apartments which go very far under the mountains and a very small part of which are here described are embellished by marble figures of men birds and various animals some sculptured in bas relief others cut hollow and some painted in colours which are not to be effaced These unintelligible characters which contain the his∣tory of the times conceal beneath their impenetrable veil most interesting discoveries and the most re∣markable facts relative to the monarchs of the The∣bais whose power extended as far as India Torches are necessary in examining these labyrinths into which the light of day cannot penetrate  Such are the caverns where the bodies of kings repose surrounded by silence and shades A kind of religious terror is felt while wandering through them as if the presence of the living disturbed the dead in their asylums where they have retired to rest in peaceful sleep  Returning from these dark abodes and proceeding Southeast the traveller soon meets with the remains of a temple on the square pillows of which are sta∣tues that have all had their heads broken off each holding a sceptre in one hand and a whip in the other The remains of the buildings belonging to this temple cover a mile of ground In one of  the courts are parts of two statues of black marble which were thirty feet high in the other the tra∣veller stands in stupid amazement at beholding a co∣lossal figure extended on the ground and broken near the middle The space between the shoulders is one and twenty feet the head eleven feet in length and eighteen in circumference This gigantic statue is only inferior in size to that of  Memnon  About half a league further are the ruins of Memnonium where is the largest colossus of Egypt The circumference of these ruins is about half a league On entering them the traveller is struck with astonishment at the sight of two gigantic figures which seem like rocks and are seated beside each other Their pedestals are nearly equal and formed from blocks of granite thirty feet long and eighteen wide The smallest of these statues is also one single stone the other the largest in Egypt is formed of five different pieces of granite and broken in the middle Some idea may be formed of the gigantic size of the grand colossus when we are told that its feet alone are seven feet long This statue the half of which remains on its base and which  Strabo  calls the statue of  Memnon  uttered a sound at sunrising as hath before been observed Several writers have spoken of it with enthusiasm regarding it as one of the seven wonders of the world A croud of  Greek and Latin inscriptions which are still legible on the base and legs of the colossus attest that princes generals governors and men of all conditions have heard this miraculous sound  Such are the remains of Thebes and her hundred gates the antiquity of which is lost in the obscurity of ages and which still contain proofs of the pro∣fusion of arts in those most distant times All here is sublime and majestic Its kings seem to have acquired the glory of never dying while their obelisks and co∣lossal statues exist and to have laboured only for im∣mortality They could preserve their memory against the efforts of time but not against the barbarism of conquerors those dreadful scourges of science and nations which they have but too often erased from the face of the earth  A DESCRIPTION OF ARABIA FROM THE LATEST AUTHORS  CHAP I  Country Climate and Productions  THIS is one of the most celebrated countries in the world one of the largest provinces in Asia and lies near the borders of Africa Its boundaries according to  Cluverius  and other esteemed geogra∣phers are Babylon and the gulph of Persia on the East the Indian ocean on the South the Red Sea with part of Egypt on the West and Palestine Sy∣ria and the river Euphrates to the North Its ex∣treme length is about four hundred and thirty Ger∣man leagues but its greatest breadth is not more than three hundred and forty and in some parts not above one hundred and eighty It is situated be∣tween thirtyfive and sixty degrees of Eastern longi∣tude and between twelve and thirteen degrees of North latitude  Arabia is the ancient as well as the modern name though the people have been long called Saracens or inhabitants of the desarts Sarra in their language  signifying a desart Some derive the name of Arabia from Harrabi a thief or robber as they have been ge∣nerally esteemed ever since they were a nation to the present time  The modern division of this country is into six large provinces the HEDSJAS situated along the Arabian gulph from  Sinai  to  Yemen  and extending to the province of  Nedsjed  the second is the YEMEN in general which may be subdivided into the terri∣tories of the Iman of Sarra a province which ex∣tends from the borders of Hedsjas along the Arabian gulph and from the Indian Sea to  Hadramaut  The other provinces are HADRAMAUT OMAN LACHSA and NEDSJED  It was formerly divided into three parts according to the nature of their respective soils viz Arabia Fe∣lix Arabia Deserta and Arabia Petraea Arabia Felix which is the Southeast part according to the present division and now called Yemen contained at least four parts in five of the whole Arabia De∣serta which lies to the northward is next in size and Arabia Petraea situated on the Isthmus of Suez is the least But the exact boundaries of this country either ancient or modern are very uncertain or ra∣ther there are no precise boundaries for the inland country being under the government of a great num∣ber  of Sheiks or Arabian Princes who march from place to place and encamp where they can find water and pasture for their cattle their respective dominions have scarce any fixed boundary nor is it easy to say which part of the country belongs to one of these di∣visions and which to another  The seas and promontories of Arabia are the Indian ocean the gulph of Bassora and Ormus the Red Sea and the straits of Babelmandel  The Red Sea sometimes called the Arabian gulph divides Arabia from Egypt and Ethiopia but if taken in its largest extent the name of the Red Sea was an∣ciently given to all those seas which border upon Arabia and Persia from Africa to the East Indies The reason of its being called the Red Sea some at∣tribute to the red mountains near it others that the red sand of the coast gave it that name It is called in scripture the sea of weeds or rushes the banks being overflowed with them in some places but from whatever cause the name is derived no sea has been more celebrated than this first from its having been the passage of the Iraelites through it and secondly from its having been the usual convey∣ance for the fine spices and all the rich merchandize of the East to Africa and Europe for three thousand years and upwards  No country is more destitute of rivers Chat Pran and Nagiran are the principal ones neither of which are navigable and some add the western branch of the Euphrates which runs near the boundaries of this country The mountains are those of Gebel Ared or the great mountains in the middle of the country and those of Mount Sinai and Horeb in Arabia Petraea  A country which like Arabia extends from the twelfth to the fifteenth degree of North latitude and consequently situated in part between the tropics presents the idea of a climate where the heat must be intense In some of the provinces says  Nieu∣burk  the heat is intolerable But it is in this coun∣try as in many others where the elevation of the ground the situation of place and the nature of the soil occasion a great difference in the climate  To comprehend this we must form a just idea of the local situation of the country Arabia may be considered as a country full of mountains and sur∣rounded on all sides by a vast extent of barren and sandy plains  In these desarts scattered with naked rocks there is nothing to prevent the action of the sun which burns all kinds of vegetables and reduces the lands  to parched sands The drought is so great that it of∣ten does not rain for three years together and the rivers which descend from the mountains lose them∣selves in the sands without being able to get to the sea Were it not for these rivers which overflow in the rainy season and from which canals are dug to water the grounds the farmers would not be able to obtain the smallest crop of corn From observations made with good thermometers says  Nieuburk  we found that in these plains as for example at Loheya Mocha and Muscat the heats were as violent as in the hotter countries  The interior of this country presents a very dif∣ferent temperature Long chains of mountains very lofty attract vapours which dissolving in copious rains refresh the air and animate vegetation The cold produced by the elevation of this mountainous part of the country occasions snow there which however does not last long And while the inha∣bitants of the plains are overcome with the heat those of the mountains are obliged to envelop themselves with their pelises  The position of these mountains in the midst of a country so much surrounded by sea is also the cause of a phenomenon which is observed in the peninsula of the Ganges intersected by mountains This is  the difference in the rainy seasons which are regular in the countries situated between the tropics In the western part of Arabia in the Yemen the rainy sea∣son is the more serviceable as it begins in tbe middle of the month of June and lasts till the middle of Sep∣tember which are months when the heats are greatest and where the earth and its inhabitants have most need of refreshment In the eastern part of these mountains near Maskat these rains fall from the mid∣dle of November till the middle of February and on the southern side of Arabia the rainy season lasts from the middle of February till the middle of April Thus the rains appear to make the circuit of the pen∣insula according to the impulse of the predominant winds during each season  This regularity in the rains makes the valleys very fertile and pleasant which separate the chains of moun∣tains The people likewise who inhabit these moun∣tains by breathing a fresh and pure air are wellmade healthy and robust Another advantage which the Arabians derive from the situation of their country is that they have the productions of different climates at the same time In the plains are to be seen many vegetables transplanted from India and also a great number of the animals of hot countries The moun∣tains produce the plants of temperate climates and the animals of those climates also thrive there In  short Arabia may be considered as an assemblage of different climates the real advantages of which are united in the space contained between the Red Sea and the Persian gulph  The nature of the winds is very different in Ara∣bia according to the point from whence they come and the space they blow over so that the wind from the same point is moist or dry in different places when it traverses the ocean or the desarts Upon the borders of the Persian gulph the Southeast wind brings with it a humid atmosphere which causes a very violent and oppressive perspiration the Northwest wind passing over the great desart is much hotter but not so relaxing This latter wind how∣ever heats the metals in the shade as if they were exposed to the sun and its heat when joined sud∣denly to that of the atmosphere often suffocates both man and beast The Arabians carry with them when they travel garlick and dried raisins as remedies with which they generally restore to life those persons whom these hot gusts of wind have suffocated  Notwithstanding its burning quality this Northwest wind serves to cool the drink of the Arabs in the middle of summer For this purpose they put the water in unglazed pots made of porous earth which they hang up in some place exposed to the current of  this hot wind The water by this means becomes very cool a phenomenon known in almost all hot countries and which philosophers of the present age very well account for as proceeding from a sudden evaporation  Another wind of a still more dangerous kind is the  Samiel  rarely to be met with in Arabia but very common on the frontiers This wind is predominant only on the borders of the great desart where the agitation carries with it inflamed vapours which the action of the sun kindles in this burning sand The places most exposed to this dreadful wind are the borders of the Euphrates and sometimes the en∣virons of Mecca when the North wind blows on the side of the desart The effect of the  Samiel  is to suf∣focate in an instant like a flash of lightning every living creature within the space of its activity and to occasion the bodies to become in a short time pu∣trid As it has been remarked that an almost imme∣mediate putrefaction has taken place in the bodies of animals which have been killed by lightning or by an electrical shock it has been suggested that this wind might be occasioned by some electrical fluid which is so universally diffused the Arabs can tell when this wind is coming from an extraordinary red∣ness in the air and they pretend to remark as it passes along a smell of sulphur Whether this be the  case or not the only means for a person to preserve himself from the fatal effects of this singular wind is to throw himself on the ground with his face down∣ward till the storm has blown over the vapours of which always keep at some little distance from the ground  The other meteors in Arabia are the same with those in all hot countries A serene sky seldom ob∣scured by clouds is the reason that there are few storms in the desarts The air discharges itself of the electrical matter by balls of fire and by the pheno∣menon of falling stars which are frequently seen and of a very considerable size In the more desart parts near the sea the dews are very copious Not∣withstanding this humidity the air is so pure that it is usual for the inhabitants to sleep on the tops of their houses There are however some parts where a person indulging himself in this custom is liable to be seized with a fit of the palsy But the inhabitants from long experience know what precautions they ought in such cases to take  Arabia has the advantage of nearly one continued verdure The trees indeed lose their leaves every year and the annual plants wither before they shoot out afresh but the interval between the fall of the leaves and the trees budding again is so small that  the change is scarce perceived To have the face of a country cloathed with continual verdure is an ad∣vantage peculiar to those latitudes where there is no frost and where the rainy season occupies the winter quarter  From the singular position of Arabia it will be easy to conceive that the nature of the soil must vary very much In fact nothing can be more opposite On one side there is nothing to be seen but desarts of sand and on the other beautiful and fertile valleys The sandy plain which surrounds this peninsula is almost entirely barren and presents to view nothing but the image of desolation  This plain of sand called Tehama begins at Suez and extends all round the peninsula to the mouth of the river Euphrates Its breadth is unequal in ge∣neral it takes two days to cross the Red Sea to the foot of the mountains This part of the desart ap∣pears to have been covered with the sea the bottom is a grey clay mixed with a great deal of sand and containing a great number of bones and shells of seafish at a considerable distance from the shore There are also great heaps of salt in sufficient quantity to form even little mountains Its regular descent to the shore plainly indicates that it became dry by de∣grees There is no doubt but the sea is continually  retreating from this coast and the Tehama gradually gaining fresh ground The sandbanks are continu∣ally increasing and as they approach the shore ren∣der the navigation of the gulph still more dangerous History also proves this increase of land it mentions many places as seaports which are now at some dis∣tance from the coast and passes over in silence those which are now maritime towns the existence of which must consequently be dated since the formation of the lands where they are situated  This acquisition of territory is of little advantage to the inhabitants it being entirely barren and pro∣ducing nothing Nor is there any hope of its being ever made better as the soil of this province has re∣mained the same for many ages  In the mountainous part of Arabia the soil varies very much and is in general a clay mixed with sand Their form prevents their being very fertile they are commonly very steep and pointed so that they neihter afford sufficient space to spontaneous ve∣getable productions nor sufficient nourishment be∣cause the torrents are continually carrying away the good land The cultivation of them is likewise owing to this circumstance very laborious and ex∣pensive  This country may be considered as interesting in many particulars but in general it is neither rich nor fertile Of this the laborious life the peasants lead and their indifferent food are evident proofs If it was called Arabia  Felix  by the ancients it must have merited this name rather by the value and rarity of its productions than from their abundance  Their mountains they never endeavour to culti∣vate they being for the most part schistuous and scarce capable of any improvement Their valleys seem equally barren where water is wanting and pro∣duce scarce any herbage but in those where it can be introduced they produce corn vegetables and and flowers and no country in the world affords a more picturesque view The Arabs draw the water in large skins from the wells with oxen both morn∣ing and evening conveying it along little canals by the sides of which their trees and plants are set They also cut little channels through their cornfields by which they let the water into them as often as they have a mind  There is also in this part of Arabia a great va∣riety of fine fruits such as oranges lemons grapes peaches and apricots but what this country is most famous for is their dates and their coffee with which a great number of ships are laden every year  for Europe and India besides large quantities sent to Turkey  The coffee shrub grows eight or ten feet high with a grey smooth bark the wood is white and without much pith The twigs rise by pairs opposite to each other and the leaves on the twigs in the same man∣ner the fruit hangs to the twig by a footstalk some∣times one two or more in the same place These shrubs are planted in a rich soil and watered by arti∣ficial canals after three or four years bearing the natives plant new shrubs as the old ones then begin to decline The berries are dried in the sun and the outward husk afterwards taken off with handmills and these husks the Arabians infuse in boiling water when the heat is intense instead of berries esteeming the liquor more cooling  Arabia also abounds in myrrh manna cassia in∣cense aloes balm and frankincense besides some other valuable drugs Among their trees nothing is more wanted than timber and indeed there is scarce any wood in the country  All uncivilized nations have remedies derived from vegetables with whose virtues they are ac∣quainted by tradition The Arabs are not without such kind of medicines of which they have made  use from time immemorial with such success as a stranger can hardly credit Aloes and euphorbia are too sufficiently known to dwell upon them in Arabia the different species of this latter plant are so numerous that it may be looked upon as an indi∣genous plant In hot countries counterpoisons are set great store by on account of the venemous beasts with which they are infested By long experience the inhabitants of these countries are acquainted with those plants which are salutary to men and the con∣trary to these dangerous animals The Arabs appear however to be ignorant of the virtues of  Ophiorrizo  so common in their mountains On the contrary they set great value by the  Aristolochia semper virens  which they look upon not only as a remedy but as a preservative against the bite of serpents Accord∣ing to their opinion a person who has drank a de∣coction of these herbs for forty days cannot be bit by these venomous animals Though this is not suf∣ficiently ascertained yet it seems probable that those persons who travel about with serpents exposing themselves to their bites possess some secret to secure themselves from their malignant effect  Of their animals those most useful and excellent in their kind are camels and horses The camels are well adapted to this desart country the largest of them will carry immense burdens some writer  say near a thousand pounds weight each It is well known the Arabs set great value on their horses They divide them says  Nieuburk  into two kinds the  Kadischi  or those horses whose breed is not known and the  Kochlani  or horses whose pedigree is traced back for above these two hundred years The  Ka∣dischi  are held in no great esteem and are employed in husbandry or in carrying burdens  The  Kochlani  on the contrary are kept entirely for the saddle They are very much prized and consequently very dear The Arabs pretend they derive their origin from the harems of  Solomon  Be this as it will they are capable of enduring very great fatigue and going for days together without food They are supposed to possess astonishing ardour it is even said that a horse of this breed when he finds himself wounded and no longer able to carry his rider will quit the field of battle in order to carry him to a place of safety If the rider is thrown to the ground these horses will remain near him and not give over neighing till some one comes to his assist∣ance These horses are neither large nor handsome but very swist and the Arabs value them only on ac∣cout of their pedigree and their good qualities but by no means for their figure  These Arabs it is true have no genealogical tables to prove the pedigree of their Kochlani but they are nevertheless certain of the regularity of the descent because a mare of this breed is never covered but in the presence of witnesses Though this peo∣ple are not always very scrupulous about perjuring themselves they are more conscientious in an affair of this kind nor is there any instance of an Arab per∣juring himself respecting the breed of a horse be∣cause he is persuaded that he himself and his whole family would be ruined if in an affair of such im∣portance be deposed what was not true  The common food both of camels and horses is barley or barleymeal made into dough But  Theve∣not  says that in some parts of Arabia the horses are fed with camel's milk or with butter and wheat and sometimes with the flesh of camels dried in the sun A more modern writer says the cattle at Muscat are fed with fish not with such as are fresh taken but they dig a small pit and having thrown a large quantity of fish in it they are suffered to remain there till they are rotten and turned to a kind of earth which is then taken up boiled in water and when it has stood till it is cold is given to the cattle This makes them very fat nor does their flesh taste amiss from the cattle being fed with this kind of diet They have oxen buffaloes goats and venison but their beef  and the flesh of their buffaloes is coarse As to hogs they never breed any being all Mahometans who ab∣hor the sight of this animal Fish and fowl are in great plenty on the seacoasts but the inland parts are very indifferently stocked there being neither wood nor water to supply them with wood and shelter Lions bears tygers wolves jackalls and other wild beasts are also found in some parts of Arabia but not in great numbers there being but little cover for them  Among other carniverous animals the most fright∣ful and dangerous is the hyaena which attacks both men and beasts This ferocious and solitary animal inhabits the caverns of the barren mountains of Ara∣bia Petraea he is also to be met with in the environs of the Persian gulph The hyaena prowls about only in the night In the season when the inhabitants sleep in the open air he frequently carries off the children who are lying near their parents As the domestic animals of the southern part of Persia are fed chiefly on fish he is obliged to eat the same kind of food  Arabia appears to be the native country of the ass they are to be seen here of such a beautiful vigorous and animated species that their asses may be compared to horses The inhabitants also mention a wild ani∣mal  which they have called Djaear of the size and figure of an ass the flesh of which is good to eat This animal is perhaps a wild ass who by living in woods acquires some peculiarities in its shape which make the Arabians who know little of natural his∣tory mistake it for some other animal  The forests in the southern part of Arabia swarm with monkies who have no tails and whose buttocks are bare of hair and red I have seen troops of se∣veral hundreds says  Nieuburk  other travellers have met them by thousands in the mountains of Aden These animals are very docile and learn all sorts of tricks with great facility This occasions a great quantity of them to be exported into Egpyt where the mountebanks exhibit them to the people  In the cultivated parts of Arabia poultry of all kinds is very common Of game or wild fowl very little is to be met with by travellers The Arabians in general do not think it worth their notice and neither ca  e for the pleasure nor the labour of hunt∣ing Two reasons may be assigned for their aversion to a pastime which constitutes the supreme felicity of the descendants from the savages of the North A people naturally sober and frugal living under a cli∣mate where animal food is rather prejudicial than otherwise to health cannot be very fond of game  The punctilious precepts of the Mahometan religion must besides disgust an Arab from the pursuit of wild animals and especially birds For if he omits to say a short prayer whilst he is killing the animal or if the animal does not lose the quantity of blood prescribed by law or if he was not killed instantly or if he fell upon a spot that was inhabited or con∣taminited in all these instances the sportsman loses his labour or his prey is deemed impure  A dry country like Arabia cannot breed any great quantities of aquatic birds The birds which frequent the seacoasts and seed on fishes are very common on the borders of the Red Sea that sea being very shallow and full of fish Ostriches are also to be met with in the desarts which the Arabs call the de∣sartbird Eagles falcons hawks and vultures are the birds of prey which are seen in Arabia The last of these birds renders signal services he purges the earth from all carcases whose corruption is so sudden and dangerous in hot countries and he destroys the fieldmice which would otherwise render useless the labours of the husbandmen These essential services have made this bird to be considered as sacred by the ancient Egyptians and there are still many countries where they are not permitted to be killed  In many countries of the East as in Arabia is another bird no less useful to the inhabitants It is supposed to come from Korasan and arrives in Ara∣bia about July or August following the swarms of locusts of which it destroys an incredible quantity It is called Samarmar The services which this bird renders to the countries exposed to the ravages of these insects occasions in Syria many ridiculous and superstitious customs This bird is thought to be en∣ticed by the Korasan water which is brought with great ceremony from a considerable distance and kep in a reservoir made of stone on the top of the tower of the mosques If this water sails the inha∣bitants are in despair  There are many kinds of serpents in Arabia whose bite is often mortal there are however as many more that are harmless The bite of some only occasions a disagreeable itching which the inha∣bitants easily cure In general the bite of those ser∣pents only is mortal who have a separate row of teeth longer than others The Arabs in Egypt are acquainted with the formation of the teeth of these reptiles and handle freely those serpents from which they have taken out with pincers the long teeth which serve as a channel to the poison In Arabia the only serpent truly dreadful is that called Batan very small and delicately made with black and white  spots Its bite is instant death and swells the corps of the person bit in an extraordinary manner  In our passage up the Red Sea we saw great quan∣tities of flying fish which rose from time to time above the surface of the water But we discovered no flying serpent though the Arabs give this name to a serpent which should rather be called a spring∣ing one This serpent fastens himself by his tail to the low branch of a tree then giving a sudden jerk by means of the elasticity of his tail he springs up from one branch to another till he reaches the top  The Arabians distinguish several kinds of locusts to which they give particular names but their names do not regard the nature of the animal but the pre∣tended delicacy of its flesh They give the name of  Muken  to that sort which is looked upon the fattest and most succulent they eat also another which is thin and meagre but they refrain entirely from that called  Dubba  because it brings on a diarrhaea  All the Arabs not only those that live on the bor∣ders of Persia but those in Syria and Africa are ac∣customed to eat locusts the Turks on the contrary have an aversion to this kind of food If Europeans express the same dislike the Arabs reproach them for eating oysters crabs and lobsters  Swarms of this insect darken the air and ap∣pear afar like a thick smoke The noise they make as they fly is dreadful it stuns the ears like the fall of a great river When such a swarm alights on a country it is laid waste and stripped of its verdure The vegetables and datetrees suffer very much from the locusts but the corn that is ripe or nearly so is left untouched from its being too hard for them to eat  A little insect about the size of a barleycorn is another scourge to Arabia as well as to most hot countries Many writers have from its resemblance taken this creature for an ant Its instinct leads it to walk out only in the night under some kind of galleries which it builds up with earth as it ad∣vances when got to the end of its march it destroys and devours every thing victuals cloaths and furniture We found says  Nicuburk  an army of these insects in our chambers at Beit el Fakih when they had built up their galleries which we imme∣diately destroyed but without being discouraged or even frightened at the sight of us they patched up their work during the night with singular perse∣verance so that we had an infinite deal of trouble to get rid of this little animal which lives and works in society like the ants  The Arda is another insect very dangerous to trees whose leaves or fruit their sweetness makes them fond of These insects fasten their galleries on such kinds of trees from the bottom to the top The in∣habitants have no other means of securing their gar∣dens from a total devastation than by surrounding the trees with sheep's dung the smell of which is insupportable to this insect  There are a great number of ants in Arabia most of which are as harmless as our own We must how∣ever except two kinds one of which is troublesome from the voracity with which it attacks the provisions of the Arabs if not driven away by the smell of cam∣phire the bite of the other is almost as painful as that of the scorpion  A kind of  Scolopendre  is also very tormenting to the inhabitants by causing burning pains to those it attacks This insect fastens itself into the flesh with all its feet in such a manner that it is impossible to be freed from it but by successively burning with hot iron all the parts of the animal  CHAP II  Cities  THE principal cities in Arabia of which we pro∣pose to treat are Suez situated in the Nor∣thern part of Arabia Jeddah Mecca and Medina in the province of Hedsjas and Loheia Sana and Mocha situated in the Yemen or southern part of Arabia  Suez which was the Arsinoc of the ancients is situ∣ated at the top of the Red Sea it stands surrounded by the desart and is a shabby illbuilt place the ships anchor a league from the town to which the channel that leads is very narrow and has only nine or ten feet depth of water for which reason the large ships that are built here must be towed down to the roads without masts guns or any thing in them some of these vessels are at least twelve hun∣dred tons burthen being as lofty as an hundred gun ship though not longer than a frigate Eight of these ships sail every year to Jeddah before the Hadji stay  there two or three months and return loaded with coffee this is so material an article in the diet of a Mussulman that the prayers and wishes of them all are offered up for its safety and next to the loss of their country the loss of their coffee would be most severely felt by them the greatest part of it is sent to Constantinople and other parts of Turkey  The town says  Nieuburk  is situated on the western side of the Arabian gulph or Red Sea but not quite at its extremity It is not surrounded with walls the houses however are so well joined together that there is no entering the city but by two streets one of which that towards the sea is open and the other shut in by an old ruinous gate The houses are very indifferent and the Khans are the only substantial buildings There are scarce any remains of the castle built by the Turks on the ruins of the ancient Kolgum  It is badly peopled Among the inhabitants are some Greeks and a small number of Copts but at the season of the departure of the ships for Jeddah the concourse of strangers collected there is very great  The country round about is nothing but rocks slightly covered with sand which renders it so very  barren that scarce any vegetation is to be seen trees gardens fields and meadows are entirely unknown The only article of food which is in any plenty is fish All other subsistence for men or cattle is brought from a great distance from Cairo three days or from Jassa six days journey  There is not a single spring of fresh water in Suez The only water that is drinkable is brought from a place about two leagues from the town on the other side of the gulf It is the Arabs who bring this water which they sell very dear The principal occupation of the inhabitants is the building of ships This bu∣siness is in a very flourishing state in spite of the dear∣ness of wood iron and other materials which are all brought from Cairo on camels The government of this town is under the influence of the Turks  Between this town and Tor is a place called Bur∣kit Pharoon signifying  Pharach  's whirlpool This has been determined to be that part of the Red Sea which  Moses  and the children of  Israel  crossed as related in the bible when pursued by  Pharaoh  who they say was drowned in that very spot where this eddy is The Arabs have still a custom when they pass this place to kill a sheep which they smoke with incense after cutting off its head and then throw it into the sea praying at the same time  The government of Suez is under the influence of the Turks The governor is appointed by the pacha of Grand Cairo The Arabs who live near Tor on the other side of the gulf pay little regard to the Turkish governor of Suez When they are dissatis∣fied with him or the inhabitants they threaten to bring no more water and forbid any one to go near the well The putting this threat into execution would reduce the town to the greatest extremity they therefore do every thing to pacify them They might easily ruin the town if they did not prefer the advantage they derive from the transport of merchan∣dize on their camels between Suez and Grand Cairo  We ourselves says  Nieuburk  experienced the effects of the insolent threats of these Arabs The Scheiks who had conducted us to Mount Sinai not having fulfilled their engagements we refused to pay them all the money we agreed to give them They threatened to kill us we told them we would defend ourselves They then said they would cut off the supply of water we replied that was indifferent to us who drank only wine an answer which made the Turks laugh at the Arabs' expence But after having interested the tribe to take part in their quarrel the execution of this threat was so much dreaded that the governor entreated us to settle the the difference by paying the Scheik  Every person whether Christian or Mahometan who travels along the coast of Arabia Petraea either by sea or land should take with him a Ghasir or guide to whom he must make some little present from time to time as also at the end of his journey By these means he will travel through the country without danger of being molested If the vessel on which he embarks should be shipwrecked it will be plundered by the Arabs but his goods or merchan∣dize will be restored to him immediately if his Ghasir is present If the traveller names one who is absent a circle will be drawn round them and they will be kept till he comes and then instantly trans∣mitted to him But if the traveller has no Ghasir or if he gives in a fictitious name his effects will be seized upon without hearing any thing he has to say The Turks through avarice in order to save some little present and out of pride not to be thought to familiarize with the Arabs very seldom take any Ghasirs but they suffer by this neglect For the rights of this kind of hospitable friendship are sacred among these robbers  When I say of Jeddah says  Rooke  that it is  terra senza frutti populo senza fede  I believe I give a pretty just description of it but to enter into a more minute one it is an old and ill built town surrounded by a broken and ruinous wall having no sort nor  any guns mounted it is situated nearly midway be∣tween Mocha and Suez on the eastern coast of the Red Sea and is a place of the greatest trade on it the commerce between Arabia and Europe here meets and is interchanged the former sending her gums drugs coffee c which are brought in small vessels from the whole extent of the coast as far as Bassora in the Persian gulph and from Europe come cloths iron furs and other articles by way of Cairo the revenue arising from the duties on these is shared between the Grand Signior and the Scheriff of Mecca to whom this place justly belongs It was formerly tributary to the Grand Signior only but the latter whose dominions surround it seized on it the affair however being compromised between them they now share the profits of the port the for∣mer sends annually a Pacha to support his preten∣sions and collect the revenue the latter deputes a governor who is termed the VizirScheriff and has chief power and authority here  This town like Suez is entirely without fresh water The inhabitants have none to drink but what the Arabs collect in their reservoirs in the moun∣tains which they bring by little and little on their camels into the city The environs are a deep sand and very barren According to tradition these parts have experienced no change since the creation of the  world for in a place a little distant from the sea they still shew the tomb of Eve In walking about the harbour says  Nieubuhr  I was witness to the very singular manner in which the Arabs take their wild fowl The fowler undresses himself puts some seaweed on his head and walks towards the bird who is not frightned at the approach of the seaweed which he is accustomed to see floating on the waves The Arab then seizes the duck by the feet When  Pocock  and other travellers mentioned this method being practised in China their relation was not cre∣dited Nothing is however more certain  The people here are not quite so black as they are farther South having a yellowish tinge in their com∣plexions their way of living however is much the same they sit crosslegged on the ground at their meals watch pray drink coffee and smoke hookah five times in the day There are several coffeehouses which are always full the common people there drink their dish of coffee together as ours would a pot of beer at an alehouse The women seem to have rather more liberty than at Mocha many of them may be seen walking about the streets but the appearance they make is very extraordinary those of middling rank wear loose cloth trowsers and yel∣low huzzarboots have veils of white linen over their faces reaching almost to the ground with only  two slits for the eyes and wrap themselves in a large loose plaid of coarse cloth they have a variety of gold and silver trinkets round their arms and legs and wear necklaces of small pieces of money strung all these make a jingle like bells as they walk through one of their nostrils they wear a ring with a slat plate on it like a coat button and dye their hands red with a herb that grows in the country they are as fond of smoking hookah as the men and when they visit always take it along with them  The dress of persons of distinction among the men is not unlike that of the Turks They wear their shirt over loose trowsers made of linen The  jambea  a kind of concave hanger is fastened to a large girdle a waistcoat the sleeves of which fit close is covered with a very large mantle The twist which hangs to the handle of the dagger has a kind of coral suspended to it with which the Arabs amuse themselves says  Nieubuhr  to keep their fingers em∣ployed They are unacquainted with the use of stockings and wear nothing about their feet but halfboots or slippers  The women of fashion are dressed nearly as the Turks are at Cairo but the common people wear only a shirt without breeches The Bedouins have nothing but a long piece of linen which they wrap  round their waist The women among the lower class wear nothing but a long shift hanging loose and veil In these three articles consists the whole of their dress We have given a plate of one of these women selling bread Her fan is made of a kind of mat composed of leaves of the palmtree interwove and a parasol of the same  Being near the fountainhead of their faith the people here are great bigots to their religion and of course inveterate enemies to the Christians any stranger of that class is sure of being insulted in the streets unless he has a guard with him they are not allowed to go out of the gate leading to Mecca  Eve's sepulchre is a white building which stands about a quarter of a mile North of the town the Arabs say she was certainly buried there and that her grave is twenty feet in length which they determine to have been the standard height of mankind at that early period of the world the two Arabic words sig∣nifying Eve the mother of all are inscribed on the building they go every sabbath to pray there but will not suffer a Christian to visit it The two most valuable productions of this country are balm of Gi∣lead and senna says  Rooke  the former is extracted from a tree which grows amongst the mountains the latter is a shrub found near Mecca  ARABS of DISTINCTION  Our merchants used to send annually ships from Bengal and other parts to Jeddah but the arbitrary impositions laid on the goods and the frauds they ex∣perienced from the people have made them entirely discontinue this commerce a most glaring instance of villany in the prince of the country and the Lord Lieutenant of Jeddah stands foremost on the latter list they jointly bought the cargo of an English ship worth near £ took the goods and engaged to pay the money in a few days but the supercargo after repeated applications was obliged to return to India having only the Scheriff's bill payable the following summer accordingly he returned was very pressing for the money but met with no better success than before and only received a fresh bill with positive as∣surances he should be paid the following year it hap∣pened before his return that both the Scheriff and his Vizir were dead and when he applied for payment of the bill to the reigning Scheriff who was son to the former he flatly refused to pay a farthing saying that as the debt was incurred by his father his father only was answerable for it that it was true he was dead but the body was at his service and if it would be any satisfaction to the creditors he was very welcome to carry it with him to Bengal  This city distant a day's journey from Jeddah is situated in a dry and barren soil A few leagues  farther up the country however towards the moun∣tains very fine fruits are to be seen in great abun∣dance During the summer months the heats are in∣tolerable at Mecca the inhabitants to shade them∣selves shut the blinds of their windows very care∣fully and water the streets in order to cool the air There have been instances of persons being suffocated while they were walking in the streets by the burning wind called  Samoum  As a great part of the nobility of the province of Hedsjas lives here it is better built than any other city of Arabia Among the fine edifices it contains the most remarkable is the famous  Kaba  or house of God which was held in veneration even before the time of  Mahomet  I should have been curious enough to have seen this extraordinary building says  Nieubuhr  but no Christian is permitted to go to Mecca not that there is any express law to the contrary or that the more enlightened Mahometans have any thing to object against a curiosity of this sort but on account of the prejudices of the people who looking upon this as holy ground think the Christians unworthy to set their foot there it would be profaned in the opinion of the superstitious if it was trodden upon by infidels The people even imagine that Christians are pre∣vented  from approaching it by a supernatural power They relate that an infidel on his arrival at the hills which surround Mecca was attacked by all the dogs of the city who came out on purpose and that struck with this miracle and the august aspect of the Kaba he turned Mahometan  We must presume then that all the Europeans who have described Mecca from ocular testimony have been renegado's who escaped from Turkey A recent in∣stance supports this opinion On the promise of being able to preserve his religion a French surgeon was persuaded to accompany the Emir Hadji as his phy∣sician But at the first station they obliged him to be circumcised and then permitted him to continue his journey  Although the Mahometans do not permit the Eu∣ropeans to go to Mecca they do not object giving them descriptions of the Kaba There are painters who get their livelihood by making small paintings of the Kaba and selling them to the pilgrims  To judge from these drawings the kaba is a very insignificant building a kind of square tower whose top has a covering of black silk thrown over it em∣broidered with gold This covering is made at Ka∣hira and a new one as we have already observed in  our account of Turkey is sent every year by the Grand Signior The gutters of this building are of pure gold What seems most magnificent in this holy building are the arcades which surround the place where the kaba is situated The Mahometans speak with admiration of the great quantity of gold and silver lamps and chandeliers contained in these ar∣cades Yet according to these accounts which are probably exaggerated the riches to be found in the kaba are much inferior to those displayed in many of the Catholic churches  The kaba contains a most venerable and extraor∣dinary relic this is the famous black stone brought by the angel  Gabriel  for the construction of the holy house According to the mufti's when this stone arrived it was entirely white and so brilliant that it dazzled the eyes at the distance of four days journey but it wept so much and so long for the sins of men that it became opaque and at last quite black Every mussulman when he walks round the kaba must kiss or at least touch this compassionate stone The same honours are not paid to  Abraham  's stone nor to that of  Ishmael  Pilgrims are dispensed with from visiting and kissing them  The Arabs venerate the kaba because it was built by  Abraham  and served as a house of prayer for him  In the same precincts is the well of Zemzem esteemed for the excellence of its water and honoured on account of its miraculous origin  Hagar  turned out of doors by her master set down the little  Ishmael  on this spot while she went to a fountain to get some water for her son who was dying with thirst Not being able to meet with any water she was surprized at her re∣turn she was astonished to see a spring issuing out be∣tween the legs of the child and this spring is the well of Zemzem still existing  A range of brass columns which go round the kaba serve farther as an ornament to it Chains run be∣tween the pillars which support a multitude of silver lamps The portico's or arcades above mentioned are intended to serve as a shade to the pilgrims during the violent heats in the daytime A farther use is made of them the merchants who follow the caravans in great numbers display their merchandize under these arcades  The Mahometans have so great an opinion of the sanctity of Mecca that they extend it to the environs The territory of this town is reputed sacred to cer∣tain distances which are pointed out by particular marks Each caravan finds on its route one of these marks which is an indication to the pilgrims to put on  the humble garb in which they must appear on this holy ground  At one day's journey distant from the harbour of Jambo is Medina a city of a middling size sur∣rounded with bad walls and situated in a sandy plain It belongs to the Scheriff Before the time of  Ma∣homet  this city was called Jathreb but it had the name of  Medinet en Nebbi  or city of the prophet given to it after  Mahomet  on being driven from Mecca took refuge there and in this city he passed the remainder of his days  The tomb of  Mahomet  at Medina is respected by the mussulmen but they are not obliged to visit it in order to pay their devotions to the tomb The cara∣vans of Syria and Egypt which on their return from Mecca pass near Medina to see it  I had says  Nieubuhr  a drawing of the great mosque in which the tomb is seen in one corner As it was feared the people might render a superstitious homage to the spoils of the prophet iron nails are placed round the tomb through which it may be seen It consists of simple masonry in the form of a chest without other monument I could not says the above writer learn what gave rise to the ridiculous story well known in Europe of the large pieces of adamant  which supported  Mahomet  's tomb in the air This tomb is placed between two others in which repose the ashes of the two first califs Although it is not more magnificent than most of the founders of mosques the building which covers it is enveloped on the outside with a covering of green silk embroidered with gold which the pacha of Damascus exchanges for a new one every seven years  The building is guarded by forty eunuchs in order to prevent the treasure being taken away which is said to be contained there This treasure made up chiefly of presents from the Turkish nobles is looked upon as very considerable but so many absurd stories are blended with this account that it is impossible to know what to think Many very respectable Maho∣hometans have assured me as a fact that among other valuable treasures belonging to this tomb one is the philosopher's stone or a large quantity of powder which converts all metals into fine gold  The mountainous part of the province of Hedsjas between Mecca is divided among a number of inde∣pendent Scheicks During the months proper for pasturage the persons of the highest rank in these tribes live under tents in summer and remain the rest of the year in towns and villages But the people commonly live in little huts covered with rushes  The most remarkable state and the least known is that which the Jews have formed to the Northeast of Medina They have their own Scheiks and are divided into three tribes They are so odious to the Maho∣metans who accuse them of plundering the caravans that in Syria the greatest affront that can be put upon a man is to call him Beni Kheibar the name given to these Jews  This establishment has perhaps given rise to the fable of the Sabbatic river These Jews not tra∣velling on the sabbath cannot follow the caravans The country they inhabit is however surrounded with such extensive deserts and so very unsafe that without joining some caravan it is impossible for them to go out of a country so  isolé  or to get into it  MOCHA  This city situated on the Red Sea in the kingdom of Sana which lies in the Southern and most fertile province of Arabia called by the natives Yemen by the ancients Arabia Felix appears extremely beau∣tiful in approaching it being well built and standing close to the water's edge the houses are very lofty and are as well as the walls forts c covered with a chinam or stucco that gives them a dazzling white∣ness the harbour is semicircular and formed by two arms which run out into the sea to equal lengths  having a fort at each extremity The circuit of the wall is two miles There are several handsome mosques in the city but that with the tower built in honour of  Shadeli  who founded the town and brought the coffeeplant into the neighbourhood is the principal one The English French and Dutch have fac∣tories here the house of the former is a very large and handsome building There are no springs of fresh water in the town but some of a very good qua∣lity within a quarter of a mile among the groves of datetrees Provisions fruits and vegetables are in great abundance  Trade has much declined here of late years since Europe has been supplied with coffee from the WestIndies which article is the staple commodity of this country it grows at a place called Betelfaqui about sixty miles from hence and is brought to Mocha on camels that patient and docile animal in these Eastern countries shares with man in his toil and transports his merchandize from place to place he kneels down at the command of his master to receive his load and carries it with a slow and steady pace across the dry and barren desarts supporting thirst for several days together nor is this animal useful only for the purposes of carrying a rider or his burden but it likewise supplies man both with food and raiment  The finest breed of Arabian horses is near this city and has furnished us with those we make use of for the turf they are here chiefly articles of luxury used only in war and for parade the governor has a large stud they are small but finely shaped and ex∣tremely active of this says  Rooke  I had an opportu∣nity of judging when the cavalry had a fieldday in the great square which from the mode of exercise called to mind the idea of our ancient tilts and tour∣naments the lists were surrounded with a great num∣ber of spectators and within were drawn up fifty horsemen they first moved in a body and performed several charges with great rapidity then dispersed some took antagonists and practised with them a mock fight with lances of ten or twelve yards in length which they all carried others went singly through their exercise with that weapon and the motions of attack and defence their horses were sumptuously ca∣parisoned being adorned with gold and silver trap∣pings bells hung round their necks and rich housings the riders were in handsome Turkish dresses with white turbans and the whole formed a most pleasing spectacle  There are many rich merchants here but as their wealth increases the sovereign makes a demand of his share which is as much as he chuses to ask for when his wants are pressing he sends orders to the gover∣nor  nor to demand a free gift of so many dollars from the merchants which they freely give because they dare not refuse the governor assesses them according to his own pleasure dividing the sum to be raised be∣tween Banians and Mussulmen  The English agent who is a Gentoo has a large  conversazioni  every afternoon composed of his brother banians the denomination given to such as are of the mercantile  caste  who sit round the room on cushions and take coffee with him they are of a lighter co∣lour than any other people here and some of them might in looks pass for sallow Europeans they dress in a long closebodied muslin gown and a red turban made up into a form something like a woman's bonnet they cherish one single lock on the crown of the head shaving all the rest and generally have a red wafer stuck in the middle of their forehead which is a religious badge placed there by the priests  The Gentoos are very numerous in this city these are a particular sect of men scattered through the East no less singular in their life and manners than in their doctrine the founder of them was  Brama  who gave them their creed they are distributed into what we term  castes  or communities of men who practise the same occupation and keep themselves distinct from each other they hold it the greatest of  crimes to drink out of the same vessel with one of another  caste  or religion they never eat of any ani∣mal nor kill even a fly This lenity is founded on their belief in the  metempsychosis  which also induces them to feed all kinds of animals not knowing but that the souls of some of their friends may have taken up their abode in the bodies of them so that the dogs cats cows pigeons fowls c subsist mostly by the charity of the Gentoos the owners of them thinking it unnecessary to be at the expence of feeding them when these good gentlemen are taught by their reli∣gion to take so much care of them  In travelling through different countries the first idea that suggests itself is whether the laws and cus∣toms which prevail are such as tend to make the peo∣ple happy and in forming this estimation we are but too apt to measure their feelings by our own which is in fact to consider whether we ourselves should be happy in them Arguing on this principle we must of course draw one comparison much to the disadvantage of that country where the violation of property is so customary as it is here and the inter∣course with the  beausexe  is founded on tyranny and compulsion instead of that delicacy and sympathy of sentiment which forms these attachments with us But to weigh the matter fairly we should pronounce that if an Englishman would be miserable in Arabia  Felix an Arabian would be no less so in England the force of custom climate and complexion which makes men equally happy in different quarters of the globe will not allow them to be transplanted more than the fruits of the country which can only flourish in their proper soil  Sana the capital of the kingdom where the Imam or king resides is about ten days journey from Mo∣cha a day's journey is five and twenty miles This city stands among mountains and always enjoys a tem∣perate climate It is situated at the foot of a moun∣tain on which are seen the ruins of a castle built by  Sem  according to the opinions of the Arabs The town is of no great circumference and may be walked round in an hour though it is the capital of a king∣dom the circuit of which is six hundred miles It has seven gates and a number of mosques some of which have been built by Turkish pachas It appears more populous than it is in reality as the gardens oc∣cupy a considerable part of the space within the town There are only twelve public baths at Sana but there are a great number of magnificent palaces the three finest of which were built by the present Imam  The architecture of the Arabic palaces bears no re∣semblance to ours They are however built with bricks or stone cut or shaped in the same manner  They have scarce any windowframes Instead of windows they in general have shutters which they open in fine weather and shut when it rains In this latter case there is a small hole at the upper part of the shutter silled up with Muscovy glass through which the light enters Some of the Arabs have small painted windows which they get from Venice  There is at Sana as in all the towns of the East large khans for travellers Every kind of merchan∣dize has its particular market None but women are to be seen in the breadmarket who have portable shops or stands It is the same with all other trades where the business is carried on in similar buildings in the open street The writers have portable shops where they transcribe their papers copy books and give lessons in writing to their pupils There are also markets where old cloaths may be exchanged for new  Timber is in general very dear in the Yemen wood for burning is no less so at Sana As all the mountains are barren the wood comes at the distance of two or three days journey so that a camel's load commonly costs about two crowns This scarcity is supplied by charcoal they have also turf but it is so had that it must be mixed with straw in order to make it burn  Fruits on the contrary are in great profusion at Sana There are more than twenty different kinds of grapes which ripening one after another furnish a delicious refreshment for many months The Arabs hang them up in their cellars and make them last almost the whole year The Jews make a small quan∣tity of wine and might make still more for commerce if the Arabs were not such enemies to strong liquors A Jew convicted of having carried wine to an Arab is severely punished He must even be cautious in sending it to one of his own persuasion They dry a great quantity of grapes and it forms a considerable article of exportation  The Jews are not permitted to live in Sana they inhabit a village apart to the number of two thou∣sand In the Yemen they are treated with more contempt than even in Turkey They are the best workmen the Arabs have These people are per∣mitted to go into the city in the daytime where they work in little open shops and at night return to their village  The Imam lives in great state at Sana he has a numerous stud of very fine horses and his seraglio is composed of one hundred and fifty women in this blessing of life people in the East may indulge them∣selves to what extent they please there being no limi∣tation  to the number of concubines though only four wives are allowed the seraglios are therefore com∣monly in proportion to the wealth of the master their concubines being slaves whom they purchase Their idea of beauty as may easily be supposed differs as much from ours as their colour the more jetty black the complexion of the female the more she is admired flat noses and thick lips are considered handsome and therefore the women of Abyssinia which country is opposite to this coast having these perfections in the highest degree fetch the greatest price in the market numbers of them are brought here and sent to the other parts of Arabia every year for sale  The throne of the Imam of Sana whose dominions may be said to comprehend the greatest part of the Yemen is hereditary His revenues are estimated at about crowns a month They arise from im∣posts on lands persons and goods Coffee is the lead∣ing article of his revenue this is taxed a fourth part of its value before it is exported It is remarkable that  Pliny  notices the ancient custom of the Arabs to grant their sovereign a duty amounting to the va∣lue of the fourth part of their productions His army consists of about four thousand infantry and one thou∣sand cavalry  In time of peace the service of a soldier in the cavalry is confined to the taking care of his horse and accompanying the Imam or if in the provinces the governor to the mosque The Arabs take very great care of their horses each of which has its par∣ticular groom They leave the heads of their horses free and fasten them by the legs very near the ground which prevents their being vicious After the soldiers have conducted the Imam from the mosque they pur∣sue each other with lances and this is all their mili∣tary exercise As the lands in the Yemen are very cold they immediately put coverings over their horses which they leave upon them till they are mounted again  Most of the men have also some civil employment which they follow when they are not taking the field They are armed with lances and sabres and some of them carry pistols in the housings of their saddles But they wear no uniform each person dressing him∣self according to his fancy  In the garrison the infantry is just as idle they seldom mount guard except some few sentinels at the gates of the towns The infantry also accompany the governor to the mosque marching in rank and file with men preceding them who are cutting capers with their arms in their hands and singing like so  many madmen On their return from the mosque these footsoldiers salute the governor with some discharges of musquetry made without any regula∣rity and this ceremony is the only exercise they have  The infantry is still worse cloathed than the cavalry most of the soldiers are contented with simply wrapping some linen round their waist and a handkerchief about their head the best dressed wear a shirt and breeches of blue cloth  The Arabs have an extraordinary manner of shew∣ing their courage resembling the manner in which the ancients devoted themselves to death The person who wishes to give proofs of his attachment to his master ties up one of his legs behind and con∣tinues firing till the enemies retire or he himself is killed I looked upon this as a story having no foun∣dation in truth says  Nieubuhr  until I was undeceived in the recent instance which I found might be de∣pended on of a Scheik in the service of the Imam who devoted himself in this manner in an engage∣ment against his countrymen Six slaves loaded the fusils of this Scheik who kept a continual fire upon the enemy until after being abandoned by the Iman's troops and his own domestics he was massacred  They have no artillery in their armies the Arabs know not how to make use of cannon so that their cannoniers which they have in some of their towns are renegado's or fugitive Turks who have never been thoroughly taught this art  The Imam having nothing to fear from enemies or pirates in the Red Sea has no need of a navy His subjects are in general bad sailors The fisher∣men display a courage and dexterity in hazarding themselves at some distance from the shore in small sloops without sails and in a manner without oars  Notwithstanding the natural talents of the people the arts for want of encouragement are entirely neg∣lected in the territories of the Imam and in the ad∣joining provinces Books are rare the Arabs not being fond of printed characters They have no painters nor sculptors it being contrary to the pre∣cepts of their religion to suffer the imprint of any image Nor have they any musical instruments ex∣cept drums and reeds in the country of the Yemen Their gold and silver work is well executed but the workmen are either Jews or Banians  CHAP III  Persons Dress Habitations Food Customs Travelling Marriages Arab Women  HAVING in our description of Syria and Pa∣lestine given an account of the Bedouin Arabs inhabiting the vallies and frontiers of those two pro∣vinces we shall conclude our description of Arabia with some interesting observations on the manners and customs of the Arabs in general a people hitherto but little known and which are extracted from the wri∣tings of  Abbé Poiret  in his late travels through part of that country  How shall I paint says the  Abbé  the confused and contradictory ideas which arose in my mind on the first view of these Arab hordes I had approached within half a gunshot of thirty tents and was pre∣paring to go up to them when I was informed that the plague had just made its appearance among them To avoid the danger of communication I dismounted  from my horse The spot where I then happened to be was on the brink of arivulet the stream of which was cool and perfectly limpid bushes of roses lau∣rels and myrtles formed around me an agreeable shade and the landscape bounded by hills clothed with the most beautiful verdure was animated by nu∣merous herds feeding at a distance Thus nature by presenting this delightful view transported me in idea to those happy ages when men were all shepherds and knew no other riches than their flocks and the productions of the earth Occupied with these ideas whilst wandering over the beauties of this scene and fixing my sight principally upon the low smoky huts of the Arabs I saw all of a sudden about a dozen of them directing their steps towards me I confess at the sight of these ferocious men I could not suppress an emotion of fear which in an instant dispelled all those ideas with which I had been so agreeably entertained They were armed and I ap∣prehended some attack from them but the Arabs who accompanied me assured me there was no danger As soon as they were near enough I saluted them ac∣cording to the custom of the country and ordered my interpreters to tell them to keep at a certain dis∣tance on account of the contagion With this re∣quest they readily complied and squatting down in a circle round us conversed with their countrymen for some time They then asked me if I would have  any milk I replied in the affirmative upon which two of them immediately set out and returned soon after with each a bason full of it I drank some of it and notwithstanding their forward manner and threatening air was sensible they gave me a kind re∣ception I expressed my gratitude by my gestures and distributed among them a small quantity of powder and shot which they requested Forgetting then the picture which had been drawn to me of their man∣ners I endeavoured to persuade myself that the nearer a man is to nature the better he ought to be I perceived in them the patriarchs of antiquity de∣voted entirely to the care of their flocks and free from that multiplicity of wants created by luxury I beheld men to whom I was indebted for their hospi∣tality since they offered me an asylum in their tents and if I did not find in them the affected politeness of Europe I thought I observed at least that rustic openness that ought to reside in the man of na∣ture  When I took leave of these Arabs they accom∣panied me near half a mile and when we parted they wished me in their own language happiness and peace Being informed of the meaning of these expressions I repeated them very affectionately and congratulated myself that the first Arabic words which I pro∣nounced served to express my gratitude I met with  almost the same reception says the  Abbé  from the dif∣ferent Arab tribes among whom I went  In this desart and uncultivated country how many enjoyments and what riches for the naturalist How many useful lessons for the philosophical observer How humiliating it is for human nature to see almost all nations degenerate insensibly from the virtue of their ancestors and preserve only their vices This however is the picture which the history of all ages presents to us Where at present shall we find the sages of Greece the learned Egyptians and the heroes of ancient Rome We should in vain seek for them in their descendants while the Asiatic has preserved his primitive effeminacy and the barba∣rous African still thirsts after blood How many figures worthy of exercising the pencil of a  Raphael  are to be met with among the Moors and Arabs Eyes full of fire and courage a ferocious look manly and strange features an aquiline nose nervous arms a tall figure a haughty gait legs thighs and shoulders almost always naked are the characteristic marks which distinguish the greater part of them  Their dress is an interesting object and believed to be very ancient It is said that in some parts of the desart several of the tribes go perfectly naked I have indeed met with some says the  Abbé  who had  no kind of vestment whatever and others who had a kind of light drawers but the greater part wear a dress more or less simple according to their wealth and condition Some 'I mean the poorer sort' wrap themselves up in a piece of linen cloth several yards in length which they roll each according to his own manner around the head and body This dress is perfectly well described by  Fenelon  when speaking of the customs of the Boeotians in his  Telemaehus  he says "Their dresses are easily made for in that mild climate nothing is worn but a piece of fine light stuff uncut which they wrap round their bodies in long folds giving it whatever form they chuse Others add below either a shirt like those of our women or a tunic of woollen cloth without sleeves which reaches as far as their knees The richest wear besides this a kind of robe much like the cloaks of the hermits The fineness of their dress is also proportioned to their fortune I have seen several Arab chiefs clad in woollen stuffs which on the first view I have taken for very fine muslin of an exceeding bright white colour" The Barbary wool has always been famous for its beauty The women for their dress wear a piece of stuff like that of the men but they arrange it somewhat differently They make a kind of robe of it which covers several of those parts that the men leave naked Besides this the Arab women wear se∣veral ornaments which certainly do not contribute to  set off their beauty They wear their hair in tresses and sometimes floating over their shoulders while the men are shaved and reserve only one tuft in the middle of their head The ears arms and legs of an Arab woman are ornamented with large iron rings sometimes they add bits of coral Coquettes after their own manner instead of rouge which certainly would add very little embellishment to their dark complexions use gunpowder mixed with antimony for tracing out various figures on their foreheads and above the eyelids The men do the same on their arms breasts and hands a little superstition is per∣haps mixed with these mystical characters If to supply those colours which they want our European ladies were obliged to submit to an operation as pain∣ful as that employed by the Arabs it may be much doubted whether they would wish for any other charms than those bestowed by nature The female Arabs to render these marks indelible prick their skins in numberless places with a needle and when the blood ceases to flow they apply their powder finely pound∣ed and force it into the pores of the skin by repeated friction  The dress which has been described is indeed common among the wandering Arabs of the moun∣tains and the desarts Those who live in cities vary more in their manner of dressing Some go with  their heads bare or covered at most with a red bon∣net others wear a turban like the Turks with part of their accoutrements They use slippers too but the mountaineers go always barefooted  Those who are fond of antiquities might make curious and useful researches respecting the dress of the African and Asiatic Arabs What induces me says  Poirét  to believe it is very ancient is that these people are absolutely ignorant of a variety of modes A son never thinks of dressing any other∣wise than his father and even if he should their in∣dustry is so limited that their workmen would find themselves much embarrassed were they obliged to change the form of their dress however troublesome it might be  The habitations of the Arabs are as simple as their dress they inhabit only tents or huts constructed with the branches of trees and reeds A collection of several tents is called a  douare  there are some which contain from ten to twenty and even above a hundred These tents are placed circularly in order that they may inclose their flocks in the middle during the night If there be any vacant space between two tents they fill it up with bushes and thorns to ex∣clude ferocious animals The form of each tent is almost like that of a tomb or of the keel of a vessel  reversed They are low except those of their chiefs which are extensive and have a little more elevation The cloth of which they are composed is of wool very closely woven and dyed either black or brown The facility with which these habitations are trans∣ported makes the Arabs often change their abode according to the season or as their wants may re∣quire In winter they choose a Southern exposure at the bottom of some hill in summer they approach those places where there are plenty of pastures and abundance of springs  An inventory of their furniture may be soon taken They are acquainted with no other bed than the earth upon which the most delicate spread a little straw a mat or a coarse carpet A few earthen vessels for cooking and to prepare their  courcousan  a wooden bason to draw water and to hold their milk when they milk their cows a goat's skin to churn their but∣ter and two portable millstones to grind their corn are all the apparatus of their kitchens  From this enumeration of their kitchen utensils it may readily be supposed that their repasts are neither sumptuous nor delicate indeed nothing can be more simple or frugal They make only one meal a day which requires any preparation Besides this they take nothing or else they content themselves with  some fruit or a few wild roots Those however who are in easy circumstances eat two meals a day which consists only of  courcousan  It will be proper to observe that the wheat in the northern part of Arabia does not like that in Europe produce a pure and nutritive flour but it is necessary to distinguish in the grain the mealy part from that which is hard The first which is in a very small quantity is gene∣rally found at the point of the grain and in the middle This flour makes very bad black bread and on this account it is never used They give it their cattle or mix it up in small quantities with the part which is hard The Arabs are unacquainted with the use of bread They bruise their wheat by means of two portable stones so that it forms a coarse kind of meal which they call  courcousan  When they are desirous of preparing a repast they heap up a quantity of this meal in a vessel full of small holes and place it by way of a covering upon the pot in which they boil their flesh so that the vapour which arises penetrates the meal and makes it swell When this operation is finished they take out the  courcousan  and put it into another large flat vessel supported by a foot like that of our drinking glasses This food serves them instead of bread and when they eat it they mix it with a little soup milk butter or honey Above the  courcousan  they place their roast meat which every  one tears to pieces with his fingers this is generally beef mutton fowls or goat's flesh  When the  courcousan  is prepared in this manner the chief of the tent or any other Arab of a rank supe∣rior to the rest lays hold of the dish and eats first and alone He sits squatting down places the  courcousan  before him and having taken a little with his fingers forms it into small balls in the hollow of his hand and throws it into his mouth with much dexterity When the chiefs have done the dish passes into the hands of those who are next in dignity to children for ex∣ample who never eat with their father nor even in his presence unless among Arabs of a certain dis∣tinction The women eat last they have nothing but what is left by the men and even what is left by their own children They alone have the charge of providing these repasts According to the principles of their religion the Arabs are obliged both before and after meat to wash their hands beard and mouth but many neglect this ceremony As Mahometans they have nothing to drink but water drawn up with a wooden bason from which they all drink in their turns However they do not refuse wine when it is offered to them if they are not seen Many of them are even known to drink to excess  When the Arabs undertake long journies and in places in which it is probable they will meet with no hospitality they carry with them a certain quantity of their meal and when they are pressed by hunger make a few balls of it with water in the hollow of their hand This slight nourishment suffices and supports them during very long courses  There are other Arabs whose way of living is still more wretched and miserable These are the un∣conquered hordes who inhabit spots inaccessible They have no fixed possession or place of abode If they sometimes sow a small portion of land and if they keep flocks as they are then obliged to settle in the plains they never fail to be robbed These wretched people therefore retire to the thick impe∣netrable woods to frightful defiles between the moun∣tains or to caverns in the rocks They live separate one from the other and are obliged as we may say to nourish themselves with the grass of the field Wild fruits tender roots and the young shoots of plants sup∣ply them with food The greater part have firearms which are considered as the most valuable inheritance that a father can leave to his son They might employ them in hunting but as they find it very difficult to procure powder and shot they keep them to defend their liberty They prefer independence and misery to a more tranquil life which they could not enjoy in  many parts of Arabia but by submitting like the rest of their countrymen to the government of the Turks These Arabs are the most cruel of all and so eagerly do they thirst after human blood as to make it easily be believed that there are canibals among them No one dares to penetrate into the defiles of their moun∣tains The sovereigns of the country have some∣times carried thither considerable armies but their enterprises have always miscarried Either the troops have been cut to pieces in the narrow passes or the Arabs have dispersed and taken shelter in the interior parts of their mountains Sometimes they descend to the level country and plunder the neighbouring na∣tions Their figure is horrible they are lank and meagre covered with rags and disgusting on account of their dirtiness They never attack travellers ex∣cept when in large bodies but as they live at a dis∣tance one from the other when a traveller makes no stay among them and does not give them time to assemble he may pass in many places without danger  Though half savage in appearance the Arabs have certain received signs to express friendship and re∣spectSigns which among them have as little sin∣cerity as among us The most usual salutation when the Arabs meet is to put the righthand on the breast and to incline the head and in this posture to wish  each other a good day They enquire afterwards concerning the health of their relations naming them in order and do not forget to ask respecting the mare the flock the tent c If they are Arabs who are acquainted they embrace one another reciprocally kissing each others face and shoulders or they only lay hold of each other's hands and kiss one another Those among whom an intimate familiarity subsists when they meet one another frequently do nothing but touch the extremity of each other's fingers after which each puts his own to his mouth and kisses them  When the Arabs accost any person of dignified rank such as a chief a bey or a kaidi they kiss their hand with great respect A mark of favour on the part of the great man is to present the palm of his hands to the subjects who come to render him homage and whom he wishes to distinguish from others ge∣nerally he presents only the back part of his hand In short as a greater mark of submission they kiss his head his shoulders his turban and his cloaths There are some even who prostrate themselves by placing one knee on the earth An Arab never approaches a great man without pulling off his flippers  When two Arabs meet on the highway they salute each other and ask all the questions above men∣tioned  without stopping and even when pursuing their journey in different directions hence it often happens that they are too far asunder to be under∣stood when they have got to the end of their ques∣tions This however does not prevent them from going on  In conversation their gestures are lively graceful and expressive When we study them with atten∣tion it is not difficult to comprehend the subject of their discourse Their accent is strong and sharp and the sound of their voice is sonorous and may be heard very far Their being habituated to live in the open fields and to speak to one another at a great distance makes them acquire from infancy a custom of speaking very loud  The Arabs do not affix to eructation the same idea of rusticity and indelicacy as do the Europeans On the contrary when any one belches or sneezes they offer up vows for his health They say  saha  which sig∣nifies  may it do you good  They use this expression upon many other occasions When any of them eats drinks or smokes they say to him  saha  a compli∣ment much juster than that used by us when we drink to any one's health  When the Arabs are at rest their usual posture is not crosslegged like the Turks they sit squatting with their fuzee upright between their knees for they never quit their arms except when in their tents In this manner they pass whole days in doing nothing and consider themselves exceeding happy when they can give themselves up to this idleness  The only method of travelling commodiously in this country is to have a tent to ones self says  Abbé Poiret  and to lay in a sufficiency of provisions but sometimes this precaution is impossible In such a case a traveller must be contented to put up with the tents of the Arabs dirty and disgusting as they are but above all he must accustom himself to their coarse and unpalatable food How often must he de∣part in the morning without knowing where he will arrive in the evening How oft losing himself in these desarts must he search out his way amidst thorny brakes thick forests steep rocks and burning sands sometimes stopped by a river which he must wade through by a lake which he must walk round or by a marsh which he cannot cross without danger sometimes scorched by the sun▪ or drenched by the rain and at others dying with thirst without being able to find the smallest spring to quench it If he carries no provisions with him it will be impossible that he should get any refreshment before night This  is the only time at which the Arabs make a regular repast or can offer any food to a stranger  But when night arrives that period of repose for travellers in Europe it is not so here He must then choose out a dry situation and well sheltered to erect his tent he must unsaddle his horses unload his mules cut wood light fires and take every precaution that prudence directs to protect himself against ferocious animals and robbers It is safest to encamp not far from the tents of the Arabs when they can be found They furnish many succours when they are tractable and they are always so when they see a person with a sufficient guard  It is on the bare ground or at most covered with a mat that the Arabs repose and it is thus that the traveller must resolve to pass the night unless he be provided with a mattrass which however he must renounce when he meets with much rain Besides as all his luggage is incommodious it will be better to adopt at first the custom of the Arabs to which one must come either soon or late  There are a multitude of national prejudices re∣marks the  Abbé  very justly that one cannot get rid of without having been engaged in such journies as these All civilized nations resemble one another  The characteristic marks which distinguish them are act sufficiently prominent to observe them we must have a delicacy and acuteness of judgment far above the common Every nation without doubt has its peculiar character customs and manners but they are all guided by common principles and all more or less enlightened by the arts and sciences endeavour to unite around them the conveniences and comforts of life Amongst a polished people genius ever active and lively is continually inventing and bringing some∣thing to perfection it embellishes the habitation of man and converts to his use the productions of na∣ture but these boasted conveniences these events of social life are so many bonds which render man a slave to a number of fictitious wants and make him an unhappy being when his riches or labour cannot supply them Accustomed from infancy to enjoy these advantages we believe them to be so essential to our existence that to procure them we forget the labour the fatigue and the pain which they cost us We exhaust our strength destroy our health and sacri∣fice our most valuable moments to the acquisition of a fortune which often escapes from us and even on the brink of the grave we still form grand projects in the hopes of possessing a false happiness which death in a moment snatches from us Born amidst such prejudices says the  Abbé  I lamented those wan∣dering  tribes to whom our discoveries are unknown and who have neither bread beds nor houses  Experience has undeceived me I not only know those men whom I thought so wretched but I have resided among them and lived in the same manner I followed their customs at first through necessity and afterwards adopted them from habit They eat no bread they are ignorant of the art of cooking vic∣tuals and water is their only drink But what is the con  equence They are more healthy more robust and diseases are uncommon among them They have no houses but in this happy climate a piece of can∣vass a hut covered with leaves or the hollow of a rock is sufficient in the worst weather to defend one from the injuries of the air They sleep in their clothes and often amidst moisture Would it not therefore appear they must be attacked by that croud of dis∣tempers with which medicine threatens those in Eu∣rope who should attempt the same thing I was a little frightened when I found myself obliged for the first time to repose in an Arabian hut I slept well but finding my clothes wet when I awoke I was ap∣prehensive for my health Luckily I felt no other in∣convenience than that of having my sides a little sore but this was of no consequence they were soon ac∣customed to the hard earth for a bed as well as my head to my saddle for a pillow With a little cus∣tom  one sleeps as soundly in this manner as in a bed surrounded by curtains Sleep which then never ex∣ceeds the bounds prescribed by nature diffuses the balsam of health through all the organs Respiration becomes more lively and we seem animated by a new existence which one would regret to lose by too much indulgence  Besides this at the moment when one awakes there is another pleasure which few can appreciate because few know how to enjoy the beauties of nature In the midst of these silent desarts when the morning ap∣pears the horizon glows with its ruddy light and its rays gild the summits of the distant mountains By little and little the plains are illumined surrounding objects appear distinctly the flowers expand and scent the gale with their perfume the birds shake their plumage and salute the new day and in a moment all nature is enlivened and every where presents the most enchanting prospects The goat is suspended on the projecting rocks the ox crops his food in the verdant mead the lamb bleats by the side of its mo∣ther and the whole country becomes a true picture of pastoral life These are pleasures unknown to those who can sleep only in some gloomy alcove  Marriages among the Arabs is nothing but a name They purchase one two or three women as they are  able to maintain them keep them as long as they please and afterwards dismiss the  without any for∣mality No people can be more wretched than these women Their husbands are real despots who ex∣ercise the most absolute authority over them and treat them with the utmost contempt Marriage here re∣marks the  Abbé  again is not a contract which requires even the consent of both parties It is a bargain con∣cluded between the parents of the woman and the person who intends to espouse her In order to ob∣tain her he has no need to win her heart or merit her good graces for if he presents himself with one or two beautiful cows well fed he is certain of being favourably received The parents keep the cows and deliver over their daughter in their stead Whether she is to be happy or unhappy is not their business she is sold If she displeases her husband he sends her back to her parents and purchases another or even several as we have above remarked If the re∣pudiated woman happens to please another she will cost him less as she has before had another husband  To the woman is committed the whole manage∣ment of the family which is sometimes very fatiguing when these Arab hordes often change the place of their residence To grind corn to make it into  cour∣cousan  to cook it to milk the cows and to churn the  butter all belong to the women but this is the easiest part Whilst the men pass their lives in idleness they leave to the women the severest labours It is they who cut wood and who with great fatigue carry it on their shoulders Their burdens are often so enor∣mous says the  Abbé  that I could not distinguish till very near under a branchy load a small human figure disgusting with sweat and extenuated with toil It is they also who often sow and till the earth Their hardships however are still greater when it is ne∣cessary to pull up the poles of their tents The hus∣band mounts his horse very peaceably without any other incumbrance except his arms while the wife walks on foot loaded with kitchen furniture and sometimes with the tent when there is no animal to carry it The husband often has the cruelty to beat her very severely when in such a situation she is not able to keep up with his horse Thus is she obliged to travel across burning sands having nothing either often to eat or to drink  The slave rather than the companion of her hus∣band she can expect from him neither tenderness nor affection He never speaks but as an imperious mas∣ter who is sensible of that superiority which nature has given him over the woman by making him strong∣er These unhappy wretches are subordinate to their children and even to their slaves they never eat till  these have finished and they are obliged to be con∣tented with what they leave When they are not called abroad by labour they remain shut up in their tents where they sit squatting amidst silth and vermin They almost all have the itch and diffuse an infec∣tious smell every where around them Their dress consists only of a few greasy rags which they never wash They have no linen and carry their whole paltry wardrobe along with them  Employed in continual exercise their being with child is no reason for diminishing their labours they are never interrupted but at the moment when they bring forth They have neither midwives nor sur∣geons amongst them They all deliver themselves and their bed of pain is the bare ground Several of them wash their children as soon as they are born and wrap them up in the corner of their robe in other respects they abandon them to nature and allow them nothing but what is necessary to support their existence When scarcely brought to bed these women resume their labours to which is added that of feeding their children Though little cared for extended on a small bundle of stra  scarcely covered with a few rags without swaddling clothes and without bandages these children however be∣come strong and vigorous n a little time and soon follow their mother to the fields  The Arabs of the mountains are much less jealous than those of the towns none but the chiefs keep their wives shut up The rest though they might wish to do it could not unless they were resolved to supply their places in domestic labours but in them laziness is much more predominant than jealousy These women never have their faces covered though they ought to use veils to hide their ugliness rather than to conceal their beauty Their complexion is like soot their skin is dry and parched and their whole body is painted with different fantastical figures Scarce have they passed the bounds of infancy when the signs of premature old age appear on their coun∣tenances They are early deformed by wrinkles but it is easily perceived that they are only the effects of forced labour and misfortune and not the ravages of years The attracting graces of youth have not time to display themselves and from infancy to old age there is scarcely any gradation Dead eyes a castdown and disordered look hollow cheeks a back bent by excess of labour signs of the greatest misery in the whole external appearance dejection heavi∣ness and the most gloomy melancholy form the por∣trait of the greater part of the Arab mountaineers They marry very young bring forth few children and early terminate their unfortunate career  In cities the women lose in point of liberty as much as they gain in point of labour By the jealousy of their husbands they are subjected to perpetual im∣prisonment Women of distinction never go abroad those who are seen in the streets are of the lowest class and even these wear a very large and thick white veil which reaches to their knees They have their faces also covered with another veil which is applied like a mask Their under dress is a large white sheet or blanket arranged in the form of a robe They all have long drawers which descend to their heels and on their feet they wear highheeled shoes In such a dress these women appear as if wrapt up in a large bale of cloth and it is impossible to judge what they are under such a covering which entirely conceals all their graces In their houses they lay aside part of their dress and in the evening when their hus∣bands are at the mosques it is not uncommon to see them enjoying the cool air on their terraces but they instantly disappear at the sight of a manthat is of a mussulmanfor they are very fond of the christians and when they perceive them readily expose to their view every thing the jealousy of their husbands obliges them to hide With such a disposition and above all under such a constraint an intrigue might be soon formed and terminated but here there is no greater crime than gallantry especially in an European If he is caught death is inevitable and there are no other  means of escaping it except embracing the religion of  Mahomet  and espousing the woman that has been seduced If she be married there is no resource for either of the parties The woman is enclosed in a sack and thrown into the sea and the man is burnt alive or cut into a thousand pieces  CHAP IV  Education  THE following observations of the  Abbé Poiret  respecting the education of the Arabs will perhaps not prove unacceptable to our readers I was surprised says this writer to find a public school in one of their  douares  and still more so to find it under the direction of a person who was blind This Arab collected in his tent about a dozen children of both sexes whom he taught to read and write I observed that their countenances bore no marks of weariness or disgust which are too common in our schools of Europe labour on the contrary appeared  to them like amusement They had only one book the  koran  which the master knew by heart and on that account he was able to follow his scholars and to correct them when they went wrong They chaunt∣ed their lessons each with good humour and in a different tone and though this music was not very engaging I saw with pleasure that among these sa∣vage hordes the infancy of man is not abandoned to cruel and merciless tyrants who often blast the rising flowers of genius at an early period of life The farthest advanced taught the younger branches to write under the direction of the master Instead of paper they had pieces of board covered over with a kind of varnish a bit of reed cut in a very rude man∣ner supplied the place of a pen and yet with this coarse apparatus they wrote well and with great expedition When they had thoroughly learned their task they washed their tablets upon which ano∣ther was written and this always some sentence from the  koran  As soon as the time of their remaining in school was expired each child embraced the master who treated them with great mildness and affability and returned him thanks for his attention How re∣verse is such a treatment from that of one of our surly pedagoues who knows no other plan but that of in∣spiring children with sentiments of fear and disgust  In the greater part of what are called civilized na∣tions children scarce come into the world before they are dressed out like puppets They are made to repeat by rote a few Latin lines they are taught above all to behave with politeness that is to say to dissemble and lie and they are afterwards whipped for these faults when their parents themselves are the first victims of their own folly Among the Arabs the case is quite different children there are entirely abandoned to nature they are seldom caressed and never beaten Left to themselves they are employed only in exercises suited to their age they run sport quarrel and become friends the most ardent heat does not intimidate them dampness and cold never hurt them they throw themselves into the water when covered with sweat and never sit down till they have quenched their thirst They can scarcely walk when they accompany their fathers to watch their flocks mount on the back of the fiercest bull and learn without bridle and without spurs to manage the most untractable courser Familiar with every animal they caress the sheep play with the goat and in close pursuit follow the ox which escapes By these exercises in which they delight and to which they are never compelled they become nimble vigo∣rous and robust and are enured to that kind of life for which they are destined  They are accustomed early to bear hunger thirst and the most laborious journeys without complaining Their parents do not spoil them by sedulous and mi∣nute attention An over tender mother never runs to wipe the sweat from the dirty forehead of her son if he complains he is not heard and if he cries she is insensible to his tears which are never the means of obtaining what he desires He is never prevented from doing what he chuses but his parents never humour his caprice If he wishes for any thing he must procure it himself if he cannot he must give it up and remain contented He never asks for any thing he searches for it and by this he accustoms himself to suit his desires to his situation But this want of complaisance on the part of the parents and this kind of independence in the children do not esta∣blish between father and son those gentle bands and that tender relation which to feeling hearts are the highest enjoyments of life As soon as children can support themselves without the help of those to whom they owe their existence they often abandon them and they become afterwards strangers to one another Their common fate gives them little concern unless they are united by reciprocal interest affection for parents is therefore a sentiment almost unknown to the heart of an Arab a brother is often an enemy to a brother and the ties of blood which are thought  to be so strong among mankind are here of little force  With regard to the real character of children it is the same in Arabia as elsewhere Some of them as in Europe are eager lively full of spirits and of petu∣lance their reason though never cultivated is much forwarder th  n that of children in Europe Amongst us a boy of twelve or thirteen scarcely knows how to speak before people older than himself He is timid bashful and dull On the other hand the young Arab wandering in the open plains surrounded by tents herds and flocks and enjoying in full liberty all the pleasures of youth the bounties of nature encrease his ideas even with the objects of his delight As he is restrained by no dread nor checked by any sense of decency he speaks his sentiments in a firm and manly tone without being in the least abashed If he wishes to be heard he is under the necessity of at∣tracting the attention of those to whom he addresses himself otherwise he receives no reply If he asks questions none of them are answered but as they deserve it but at the same time if what he says appears to be just he is heard with attention and treated as a man and this mark of distinction in∣spires him with the desire of acting like one Thus without much trouble without masters and without tutors the young Arab formed by nature early ac∣quires  those ideas which relate to his occupation as well as that vigour and noble carriage which an∣nounce the dignity of man Their gestures are not stiff but natural and their pace is neither too quick nor too slow It is firm and manly but it is only during infancy that the Arabs can follow the dictates of nature Their mild and simple manners gradu∣ally destroyed by brutal prejudices by the sangui∣nary dispositions of their fathers corrupted by the shameful irregularities to which they abandon them∣selves totally disappear and the bloodthirsty savage is substituted to the man of nature  One of the first prejudices instilled into a child is an implacable hatred against all christians and this idea becomes so strengthened by age that there is not a single Arab who does not consider it a meritorious action to deprive one of life I have been says  Abbé Poïret  often greatly harrassed by these children who flocked round me as I approached the tents and I was even under the necessity of putting up with the grossest insults I received from them Had I attempted to have corrected any of them their fathers would not have failed to have taken their part and to have revenged at my expence an injury done by a dog to a servant of  Mahomet  The Arabs hate us at present without knowing the reason why remarks the  Abbé  Their ancestors however knew it well The most unjust wars to which fanaticism gave the name of  holy  carried on both in Africa and the East incensed against us im∣mense nations who at that time had done no other hurt than that of following the religion of  Mahomet  whilst we followed that of  Jesus  These enterprizes were the cause of shedding much blood and termi∣nated by drawing upon us from the offended nations a just hatred The name of  Christian  has always con∣tinued to be execrated in all the different countries of the Levant in Syria Arabia Persia Armenia Egypt Barbary c Fathers have transmitted this hatred to their children In passing from one generation to another the cause has been forgotten but the hatred has remained It is thus that we pay at present for the faults committed by our ancestors more than six hundred years ago  I have many times seen some of the women who had never met a Christian shudder when I appeared and fly from me as if I had been a monster How∣ever by means of some little present I always ren∣dered them more tractable and when I had familiar∣ized them so far that they ventured to look at me they appeared astonished when they found me like another man Several of them could not be persuaded I was  a Christian they particularly examined my gloves which were green taking that to be the colour of the skin When I pulled them off they were in the ut∣most amazement Every attempt that I made to ex∣plain their utility was in vain for as these people are acquainted only with what is necessary they laugh at all superfluities They think themselves superior to us because they have fewer wants and indeed it must be owned they are in the right How often by their raillery have they given me useful lessons I was accustomed when I eat of their  courcousan  to use a spoon instead of forming it into balls with my fingers like them They laughed much at this super∣fluous piece of furniture which selflove made me re∣nounce and I perceived that notwithstanding my awkwardness in using my fingers they esteemed me more when they saw I abandoned my own customs to adopt theirs Thus are all the commodities so much boasted of in Europe treated in the desart In the eyes of an Arab mountaineer luxury is contemptible and the strongest proof to him of our meanness is our effeminacy  CHAP V  Religion  THE Arabs follow in a rude manner the reli∣ligion of  Mahomet  They intermix it with many superstitions and attached to certain external ceremonies seem to be ignorant of its real spirit They observe very strictly the Ramadan the Beiram prayer ablution and circumcision but few of them however abstain from wine  There are some who under the title of  Papas  wear chaplets hanging from their necks composed of large beads and who preside at religious ceremonies such as prayer marriages funerals c but the people can readily dispense with their services They em∣ploy their chaplets as in Roman Catholic countries to count the number of their prayers and every time they drop a bead from their fingers they say  How great is God There is only one God and Mahomet is his prophet  In this exclamation and raising their  thoughts towards God all their prayers consist These prayers they repeat wherever they may be on a journey in the midst of their labour and in the silence of retirement They pronounce their words with a strong emphasis as if animated with some lively sen∣sation and struck with the majesty and beneficence of the Deity Their manners however are quite con∣trary to these ideas  Ablution among the Arabs is not observed in so rigorous a manner as among the Turks It is suf∣ficient if they wash some part of their bodies such as the arms hands feet visage and beard which they generally do in the morning in the evening and after meals Several of them neglect this practice but they are more attentive to their prayers which they every where repeat Wherever they may be whether in the tents or in the fields they throw themselves on their knees cover their heads with their clothes pros∣trate themselves three times on the earth rise up and kneel down alternately pronouncing each time "How great is God  Mahomet  is his prophet" During the Ramadan which continues one moon they take no food till after sunset and they even abstain from water and from smoking They suffer their hair to grow and neither wash their clothes nor shave their beards they even affect to appear covered with filth and dirt They do the same when they lose a near  relation or when they have the death of any one to revenge  To the Ramadan succeeds the Beiram which con∣tinues several days The Arabs then dress themselves in their best clothes shave their beards and indulge in diversions and feasting Different tribes visit each other reciprocally and all enmity seems to be forgot∣ten but only during this festival  The return of the new year is also a festival ushered in with entertainments consecrated to joy and pleasure On the evening before new year'sday as well as upon every other grand festival those who are appointed to invite the people to prayer call out much longer and with a louder voice than at other times as grand solemnities are announced among us by a greater number of bells  The extravagant follies to which the Arabs give themselves up at that season though different have some resemblance to a Carnival The most common farce consists in spreading out a lion's skin over the shoulders of four Arabs concealed under a large car∣pet which reaches to their legs This fantastic lion has a long chain about his neck and is led by another Arab Several others play on a tabor and flute whilst the lion and some dancers perform very gro∣tesque  dances others covers themselves with the skin of a camel instead of the skin of a lion In this dis∣guise they enter every house to which they can find access followed by a croud of the populace and above all children who bear in their hands the figures of a camel and a lion They receive some pieces of money from every person in whose house they have exhibited their dances  The laws of hospitality are held sacred among the Arabs at least among those who are under the di∣rection of a chief The Mahometan stranger who arrives among them is received with apparent cor∣diality he is presented with  courcousan  and is intro∣duced into a tent to repose during the night Were he the most avowed enemy when he is once admitted into the  douare  he has seldom occasion to fear trea∣chery This however is not that generous and re∣spectable hospitality which formed among the an∣cient patriarchs as well as among the Romans the sweetest bonds of fraternal friendship which brought together strangers of all countries and which honoured humanity by anticipating their wants The Arabs respect the life of their guest whilst he is in their tents but if they have resolved to destroy him they wait until he has left the  douare  they then mas∣sacre without pity him whom the evening before they treated as a friend  The system of predestination so generally adopted by the Mahometans renders the Arabs almost indiffe∣rent with regard to whatever may befall them They never complain of their situation each is contented with his own satisfied with the present they forget the past care little for the future and consider death as a necessary event to which they submit without mur∣muring  Have their flocks and tents been carried awayAre they threatened by some great danger persecuted by their chief or driven from their possessionsAmidst the greatest misfortunes they make use of no other expression but this  God will have it so  I have seen says  Poiret  some of them who when cited by their sovereigns to appear before them and when almost certain of being sacrificed to their avarice departed with astonishing composure If any emotion of fear arose in their souls the idea of predestination pro∣duced a calm and silenced the voice of nature It is also to this comforting prepossession that they are in∣debted for that indifference with which they behold the plague exercising the greatest ravages amongst them How often have I seen them during this destructive contagion wait for death without the least emotion discharge all the duties of humanity to those who were insected cleans their ulcers inter the dead and without any precaution put on the clothes of those who had perished by this cruel ma∣lady  They are not however ignorant of the dangers of communication but they destroy every objection by these words  My destiny is written God will have it so  The Arabs however do not give to predestination the same extent that we do They apply it only to physical events and seldom to moral actions They believe in freewill and rather attached to the exte∣rior rites of their religion give themselves up to the ferocity of their character without seeming to reflect on the morality of their actions Hence arise a multitude of false deductions and inconsistencies which are not surprizing in a nation rude and ignorant and hence those numerous errors in the relations of travellers who have resided only for a short time among those people whose manners they wished to describe Whoever for example newly landed upon their coasts should advance towards the infected tent whoever should have seen the father of a fa∣mily distribute without a tear to his wives and chil∣dren the cloth which was to wrap up their bodies after death and the latter receive it with a stoic tran∣quillity would undoubtedly imagine himself trans∣ported into a society of philosophers especially if he should be present at the festivals dances and public marks of joy which they exhibit amidst the ravages of the plague What would he think on seeing a son  discharge towards his father the last duties of huma∣nity and without considering the danger of contact take the clothes from his body wash it with care and commit it to the earth with his own hands  Such actions among us would be considered as heroic Among the Arabs they are only the con∣sequences of their system To undeceive them on this head would be destroying their tranquillity amidst the despotism and continual alarms which op∣press them This system in our religion would open a door to every crime by depriving us of moral li∣berty but among the Mahometans it produces re∣signation to the will of the Supreme Being and is attended with no other inconvenience than that of making them neglect those precautions which are necessary to guard them from physical evils Dan∣gerous in the religion of a Christian it becomes a masterpiece of policy and philosophy in that of a Mahometan it differs little from that resignation to Providence enjoined by Christianity but ill under∣stood and carried too far among Mahometans  It is also from the principles of their religion that the Arabs have a kind of veneration for idiots whom they consider as saints and privileged beings favoured by heaven I saw one says  Poiret  who was perfectly naked he entered with freedom into  all the tents and presented himself before the women without giving the least offence to their husbands To stop him or to treat him with rudeness would have been an action worthy of punishment He could go and eat where he chose and no one refused to give him what he wished for Even the scheik himself endured his importunities and familiarity with a most astonishing complaisance  CHAP VI  Diseases and Funerals  THE Arabs are unacquainted with any other phy∣sician than nature or with any other remedies than those presented by ignorance and superstition This nation which formerly gave birth to so many celebrated and able men for curing the ills of huma∣nity who were the fathers of medicine is at present even ignorant of its former splendor and has re∣signed to other kingdoms the lamp it first lighted It is rather however from ignorance than contempt  that the Arabs in their maladies have no recourse to medicine The European physicians who happen to be amongst them are very well received and this character is the only thing that can make them respect the life of a stranger What is very singular is that these men who are often not sensible of their being indisposed when they really are so become sick at least in imagination when they see a physician eager to receive his assistance and fearing to let slip the op∣portunity they examine their health so scrupulously that there are few of them who do not think them∣selves under the necessity of taking physic were it only by the way of a preventative Not daring to de∣cide themselves whether they are well or not they present their arms to the physician that he may feel their pulse and they can scarce believe his decision when he assures them they are in good health They have so much confidence in letting blood that the healthiest think they have occasion for this operation which they consider as an universal remedy For want of a surgeon they often bleed themselves by a process which would be very terrible to those deli∣cate people who faint at the sight of a lancet  The person who is to perform the operation begins binding a bandage round the neck of his patient so closely that he is almost strangled When the veins of the forehead appear swelled by the blood checked  in its circulation the operator makes four or five in∣cisions with a razor and in a moment the patient's face is covered with blood the effusion of which is assisted by rolling a cylindric bit of wood over the in∣cisions Sometimes the Arabs bleed themselves in the feet but always by pursuing the same method When the operation is finished they wash the wounds apply to them a little clayey earth softened in water and bind them up with a handkerchief This opera∣tion does not prevent them from immediately follow∣ing their usual occupations To this is all the medi∣cine of the Arabs confined except a few particular remedies preserved by tradition and administered with a certain mixture of superstition They have also much faith in amulets and talismans  The Arabs it is true are not acquainted with that multitude of disorders the consequence of luxury and intemperance Those to which they are most subject arise from their excessive filthiness from the marshy places they inhabit from their excesses with women or from the badness of their food These are cuta∣neous disorders intermittent or putrid fevers rheu∣matism and wasting of the humours and blood  In continual wars with one another the Arabs are much exposed to gunshot wounds and fractures  but they leave them entirely to nature Some cure and others preserve natural ulcers which they retain during life But if the Arabs do not derive the same assistance from medicine as we do they do not feel its inconveniences their imaginations are not frightened by the decisions of a physician and the va∣rious medicines with which the apartments of our sick are furnished neither offend their fight nor damp their courage As it is not necessary on account of religion or of their civil affairs that they should be forewarned of their last hour they expire without thinking on death As long as they can move they walk if they cannot they remain in one spot stretch∣ed out on the earth without ever pulling off their clothes If the sick person foresees his last moment he turns his face towards the East and dies calmly recommending himself to  Mahomet  Those Arabs who set little value on the lives of mankind respect their remains and take the utmost care of their interment the want of it they consider as one of the greatest misfortunes that can happen and in the present desolation they die with compo∣sure when they are certain to leave some one behind who will bury them The severest punishment there∣fore among them is to be cut in pieces and thrown to the dogs Their funeral ceremonies says  Poiret  as far as I have had an opportunity of observing them are as follow  Scarce has an Arab breathed his last when his body is carefully washed after which it is wrapped in a windingsheet of white cloth reserved for that purpose This cloth is manufactured in the towns of Arabia but they set the highest value upon that brought from Mecca and which has been blessed by the principal Iman The benediction is expensive but the singular favours annexed to it make them forget what it costs  As soon as the dead body is purified it is placed upon a kind of litter and carried to the place of in∣terment either on horseback or by the friends and relations of the deceased While the men are em∣ployed in digging the grave the women squat down in a circle round the body which they feel and un∣cover and afterwards converse together with much indifference but every now and then they break off their discourse to give vent to their lamentations to ask the body questions and to beseech it in the most earnest manner to return again and take up its abode among them "Why" say they "hast thou quitted us Did we not prepare thy  courcousan  well Alas shall thy children then behold thee no more Ah return again nothing shall be wanting to thee But  thou hearest no more thou no longer givest an an∣swer to our words thou hearest only our sighs c" These dismal lamentations which display a natural and pathetic eloquence would have a powerful effect in moving the heart of a spectator did he not see these very women a moment after throw aside that external appearance of the deepest grief talk and laugh together and afterwards return to their former lamentations  During these tender complaints they tear their hair and open the veins of their temples with their nails while the blood trickles down mingled with their tears and exhibits an appearance of the deepest despair When the grave is finished the body is de∣posited in it on its side and with the face turned to∣wards the East One of their  papas  puts into its hands a letter of recommendation to  Mahomet  after which a kind of arch is formed over it with the bran∣ches of trees in order that the earth may not touch it When the grave is covered with earth other branches of trees are laid over it and a quantity of large stones to prevent savage animals from devour∣ing the body in the night time In the middle of the stones an opening is left where they deposit earthen vessels and other family utensils but this is only done to Arabs of rank Before they quit the grave they erect in the middle of it a kind of funeral flag which  is generally a piece of the clothes of the deceased fixed to the end of a stick When the ceremony is finished each returns home with the greatest tran∣quillity and without shewing in their exterior ap∣pearance any signs of the melancholy duty which they had been discharging  The nearest relations and friends of the deceased go from time to time to visit his tomb They re∣move some stones from it and in part uncover the body to see that the person has not returned to life and when the smell convinces them of the contrary they renew their wailings and lamentations Some scatter a little lime over the stones to make this rude tomb look somewhat brighter On every holiday the Arabs go in crouds to visit the tombs of their dead and to bedew them with their tears  The Arabs also as is customary among us pay reciprocal visits in order to condole with one another When any of them has lost a relation all his friends and neighbours go to visit him The men visit the men and the women do the same to those of their own sex and on the first interview both parties begin to weep and to send forth loud and lamentable cries These cries are proportioned to shew their dignity When a person mourns for a superior he howls with all his might for an equal his noise is not quite so  loud Chiefs give vent only to a few sighs unless it be for another chief All this is generally prescribed A moment after their joy is renewed and they think no more of their mourning except a stranger arrives with whom they must commence their howlings afresh These ceremonies are not confined to one visit they are repeated during eight days or a fortni  ht and sometimes much longer When they are informed of the death of an Arab in  douare  where any of the relations of the deceased reside men women and children all immediately begin to howl as loud as they possibly can The dogs too frightened by their horrid din join in chorus but their grief is soon allayed and tranquillity is again restored  In cities those who are devout consider it as a very great act of religion to convey the dead to the grave If they see a funeral passing they instantly quit their occupations and take the places of those who carry the coffin until they are relieved by others The honour of interring the dead is not entrusted to mercenary hands it is the duty of the nearest re∣lation Fathers inter their children children their parents and thus in order according to the de∣gree of relationship One or more  papas  always assist at these ceremonies who sing or rec  e some verses of the Alcoran and give the deceased a recommenda∣tory epistle to the holy prophet  MAP of ITALY  with the Islands of  SICILY SARDINIA and CORSICA  map of Italy  A DESCRIPTION OF ITALY FROM BUSCHIN MARTYN MILLER PIOZZI BARETTI KEYSLER ADDISON SHARP SHERLOCK GROSLEY NORTHALL c  CHAP I  THE general name of Italy was probably derived from Aetolia a Grecian nation opposite to this country from which it is separated only by the Adri∣atic gulph The southern part was inhabited by va∣rious tribes who communicated their names to the several subdivisions as the Latins Sabines Tuscans Samnites and so on  According to the earliest accounts in history this beautiful peninsula was in the same situation as it is  now cantoned out into various little states and re∣publics all living in distrust and at variance with each other  We have different computations of the extent of Italy according to the different notions that ancient and modern writers have entertained of the proper boundaries of this country let it suffice however that from the frontiers of Switzerland to the extre∣mity of the kingdom of Naples it is about seven hun∣dred and fifty miles in length and from the fron∣tiers of the duchy of Savoy to those of the dominions of the state of Venice which is its greatest breadth about four hundred miles though in some parts it is scarce a fourth part as broad  It is bounded by the Alps which separates it from France Switzerland and Germany towards the North and Northwest by the gulph of Venice or Adriatic sea and the country of Trent towards the East by the Ionian sea and strait of Messina towards the South and the Tuscan sea towards the West  The principal mountains in Italy are the Alps and Apennines The Alps which word in its general ac∣ceptation signifies high mountains are a long chain of hills beginning at the mouth of the river Var and after many irregular windings terminating near the  river Arsia in Istria in the Adriatic They divide Italy from France Switzerland and Germany and are variously denominated according to their situation The Appennine mountains take their rise near the Alps on the seacoast in the territories of Genoa and dividing Italy into almost two equal parts reach to the straits that separate it from Sicily  The largest and most remarkable rivers in Italy are The Po in Latin Padus or Eridanus which rises in one of the highest mountains in the Alps After receiving upwards of thirty small rivers it empties itself into the Adriatic by seven different mouths  The Adige in Latin Athesis has its source likewise in the Alps and waters the cities of Trent and Verona It is the only large river in Lom∣bardy and instead of joining the Po runs as this river does into the Adriatic  The Arno flows from the Appennine mountains and falls into the Tuscan sea near Pisa  The Tiber in Latin Tiberis rises also out of the Apennine mountains and at a little distance from Rome empties itself into the Tuscan sea  Italy lies between the thirtieth or if we include Sicily the thirtyseventh and fortysixth degree of North latitude therefore the air of this country must be very different according to the different situ∣ations of the several countries of which it is composed The Northern parts that lie upon the Alps are cold and covered with snow in winter the hills of the Apennine which run almost the whole length of Italy are also cold but the countries on the North of the Apennine are temperate and those on the South are warm The Campania of Rome is unhealthy and so is the Ferrarese occasioned by bogs and stag∣nant waters In other parts the air is generally pure and dry and though Naples from its Southern situ∣ation might be thought the hottest yet being almost surrounded by the sea it is continually refreshed by breezes from thence  This country says  Busching  produces every thing in great plenty for the uses and conveniences of life All materials for enjoyment and a variety of deli∣cacies which lie scattered as it were in other coun∣tries are here almost every where met with in pro∣fusion These consist of corn rich wines and the choicest fruits such as oranges citrons lemons olives pomegranates c oil sugar almonds raisins mulberrytrees beyond number to facilitate the pro∣duction of silk tame and wild beasts alabaster jas∣per  iron alum sulphur gold silver c On this account Italy is justly stiled by writers the parent of plenty the source of earthly felicity the pride of our globe the garden of Europe the beauty of the world and even a microcosm within itself But the fine plants which from time to time have been brought into the Western countries from Italy as the reputed mother of them are not all originally natives the far greater part being transplanted to the Italian soil from the East All the fruittrees the produce of which the Latins call  mala  were transported to Italy after the conquest of the Romans in Africa Greece AsiaMinor and Syria The apricots came from Epirus and are called  mala Epirotica  the peaches  mala Persica  from Persia the citrons  mala Medica  from Media the pomegranates  mala Punica  from Carthage and chesnuts from  Castania  in the district of Magnesia in Macedonia The best pears as their names sufficiently indicate were sent from Alexandria Numidia Greece and Numantia The first plumbs were imported from Armenia and Syria and especially from Damascus  Lucius Lucullus  was the first who introduced cherrytrees from Pontus which soon after became the growth of all other coun∣tries throughout Europe  However rich and exuberant Italy may be deemed in general yet no small difference is discernible in  respect to the futility wholesomeness and pleasant∣ness of its provinces It is subject to several and great inconveniences especially in the middle and lower parts as will more particularly appear in the description of the respective territories In some countries the number of inhabitants is far from suf∣ficient for the culture and improvement of the soil On considering the multitude of people in Italy during the time of the Roman emperors its present desolateness which is most perceptible in the domi∣nions of the Pope cannot but appear surprizing Mr  Addison  a judicious observer of men and things is of opinion that the  Campania  of ancient Rome con∣tained more people than there are at present in all Italy and that there is not a town of any conse∣quence in the whole country where the ecclesiastics make if not half at least onethird of the inha∣bitants  Italy may be considered under three grand divi∣sions Upper Italy comprehending Lombardy so as to include the principality of Piedmont to which may be added the dukedom of Savoy though on this side the Alps the duchies of Montserrat Milan Parma Modena and Mantua with the republics of Genoa and Venice Middle Italy containing the dominions of the pope and the grand duke of Tus∣cany with the republics of Lucca and St Marino  The lower or Southern part of Italy consisting of the kingdom of Naples We will begin with the lower division the kingdom of Naples as being most proximate to the countries we have been speak∣ing of thence proceed to the second division and end with the first c  In giving an account of the several states we will comprehend in one

CONDAMINE GROSLEY SWINBURNE BRYDONE NORTHALL MARTIN PIOZZI MOORE c  CHAP II  Of the Country Climate Productions  THE provinces of which the kingdom of Naples consists were formerly a part of the dominions of the Roman Republic and afterwards of the Em∣perors It is now by the vicissitudes of time govern∣ed with the island of Sicily by a son of the late king of Spain From being once a Roman colony it partook as did Rome itself of a number of very stately and magnificent edifices which by the hand of time by earthquakes and wars are now a scene of ruins but  MAP  of the KINGDOM of  NAPLES and  SICILY  map of Naples and Sicily  there is a secret pleasure to the antiquary and man of learning to travel over this classic ground and view in the many ruins he meets with the ancient splendor and magnificence of their Roman masters  The population of the kingdom of Naples accord∣ing to  Busching  in was that of Sicily and that of the Estates belonging to the King in the whole Naples contains square miles Sicily the Estates of the King in the whole  The kingdom of Naples independent of the island of Sicily which is part of the empire and thus gives the title of King of the two Sicilies I say the king∣dom of Naples itself called Lower Italy is bounded on the Northeast by the Ecclesiastical State known by the name of the Pope's territories and on all the other parts by the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas Its extent from Southeast to Northwest is two hun∣hred and eighty English miles from North east to Southwest from ninety six to one hundred and twenty miles It is usually divided into four large provinces Terra di Lavora Abruzzo Apulia and Calabria containing the old Samnium Campania Apulia Lu∣cania and Brutium with a little of Latium  The old Appian road made by the Romans from Rome to Capua and afterwards to the seaport  Brundusium runs almost through the whole extent of the kingdom of Naples and is a wonderful work of man which in some parts of it has both on the right and left one continued row of ruined palaces temples aqueducts and tombs What a glorious sight must Italy have afforded to Northern Virtuosi who came to see it in the time of the Upper Empire This road is a causeway made of the lava of Vesu∣vius that liquid fiery substance which the volcano has thrown out from time to time and which on cooling becomes as hard as rock and as smooth as marble This causeway says  Grosley  appeared evidently to me to rest all along on solid masonry work lined with small stones of equal size with those of the upper side which are about eighteen inches square and bound together with cement so as to form one solid block In comparing roads of such a construction with mo∣dern roads the latter seem only as gravel walks which in course of time without repair would be∣come mires impassable by carriages whereas this pavement has continued in many places in the most perfect state more than two thousand years being begun three hundred and thirtytwo years before Christ by  Appius Claudius  the censor It is three hundred and sixty miles in length  Fundi is the frontier town of the kingdom of Naples between this and the Ecclesiastical state It  stands upon a plain sheltered by hills which is seldom the case with Italian towns but it has nothing very attractive to the traveller  This country is extremely hot and subjects foreign∣ers unless they take great care of themselves to a sickly habit of body particularly if they travel in July August or September In the lower part of the kingdom little winter is felt  The summers even at Naples are so exceeding close and hot that were it to happen only once in thirty or forty years they would call it a plague They sit in chairs says  Sharp  with only a thin callico gown some days for hours together wholly occupied in wiping off the sweat that runs in channels down their bodies The winters here are exceedingly pleasant and wholesome for notwithstanding the rain you see no damps on the staircases nor on the walls of your chambers their iron does not rust as with us nay the paintings on the outside of their buildings in fresco remain for years It is so warm that the flies do not leave them all the year The quantity of rain at Naples is much more considerable than that which falls on the same space ofground in England When the rainy season sets in it commonly lasts several successive weeks falling not in such showers as we are accustomed to having rain more  or less every month in the year but by pailfuls an absolute waterspout says  Swinburne  that carries all before it and almost drowns the unfortunate passen∣ger who is caught out of doors by the storm and yet Naples is so well paved that immediately after the rain the streets are clean and dry Whole months of drought are compensated by the deluge of a day and besides the South winds are so boisterous in winter as to burst open the bolts of both doors and windows In summer time the air is constantly re∣freshed by the seabreeze Farenheit's thermometer seldom rises higher than whereas at Rome it rises to At the end of January the thermometer is seldom lower than At Rome it falls to so that the difference between the greatest degree of heat and cold at Naples is only degrees whereas at Rome though more to the Northward it is But the most disagreeable part of the Neapolitan cli∣mate is the Sirocc or Southeast wind which in May and June is very common It is infinitely more relaxing and gives the vapours in a much higher degree than the worst of our rainy Novembers It will blow for seven or eight days or more without in∣termission it blows as hot as from the mouth of an oven and gives such a degree of lassitude both to mind and body that renders men absolutely incapa∣ble of performing their usual functions It is not perhaps surprising that it should produce these effects  on a phlegmatic English constitution but we have just now an instance says  Brydone  that all the mer∣cury of France must sink under the load of this hor∣rid leaden atmosphere A smart Parisian marquis came here about ten days ago in the month of May and was so full of animal spirits that the people thought him mad He never remained a moment in the same place but at their grave conversations used to skip from room to room with such amazing elasticity that the Italians swore he had got springs in his shoes I met him says  Brydone  this morning walking with the step of a philosopher a smellingbottle in his hand and all his vivacity extinguished I asked him what made him so dull  Ah mon ami  said he  je n'ennui à la mortmoi qui n'ai jamais sçu l'ennui Mais cet execrable vent m'accable deux jeurs de plus je me pend  The natives themselves do not suffer less than stran∣gers and all nature seems to languish during this abominable wind A Neapolitan lover avoids his mistress with the utmost care in the time of the sirocc and the indolence it inspires is almost suf∣ficient to extinguish every passion All works of genius are laid aside during its continuance and when any thing very flat or insipid is produced the strongest phrase of disapprobation they can bestow is  Era scritto in temps del siroceo i e  "It was written in the time of the sirocc"  It is not the warmth of this wind that renders it so oppressive to the spirits it is rather the want of that genial quality which is so enlivening and which ever renders the Western breeze so agreeable The spring and elasticity of the air seems to be lost and that active principle which animates all nature appears to be dead The thermometer which before the wind stood at rose whilst it blew to Seabathing is the best antidote against it  Martyn  says though consumptive people resort to Naples for a recovery of health yet this is a frequent disease here The climate seems unfavourable to it owing probably to the stillness of the bay the height of the hills behind the city and the sudden transitions from heat to cold The rains generally continue from the end of December to the middle of January which is followed by an agreeable spring nearly re∣sembling the summer of our Northern climates ex∣cept that the seas are continually stormy and dan∣gerous Almond trees bloom in February and gar∣den vegetables are in season all the year round Ice is seldom seen in the level country sometimes years pass without snow falling and when it does fall it  dissolves as soon as it reaches the ground What is collected is from the mountains  In the plains ice or snow is very rarely seen The snow that sometimes falls in the mountainous parts is gathered and kept for cooling liquors in summertime instead of ice Even so early as April the sun darts a very great heat but the nights are cold The fertility of the soil is very extraordinary being pro∣ductive to an exuberance of all kinds of grain and the finest fruits and culinary plants may be cultivated and raised at any time of the year Oil wines rice flax are equal to the finest of other countries Ca∣labria affords great quantities of manna and both there and in other parts of the kingdom saffron grows and is deemed as good as that brought from the East The hills of Pausolippo are covered with flourishing almondtrees palmtrees and the great American agave Figtrees are very common all over the king∣dom and the evergreen lemon and orange give the hills a most agreeable variety of colours and the ap∣pearance of a botanical garden for lemons citrons cedrates pomegranates and china apples grow be∣tween Rome and Naples without any particular cul∣ture There are whole forests of such trees near Terracina the frontier between the two states but they are in flavour and fragrance much below the the Spanish and Portugal fruits There are ripe  woodberries and woodberry sorbets or jellies to be had in January  Whilst I was in England says  Sharp  I never heard the words Northern Climate pronounced but they con∣veyed to me an idea of barrenness and imperfection I had always conceived that vegetables and gardenfruits attained a flavour and savouriness in the more Southern climes unknown to the latitude of but to my great surprize I do not find that any of their herbage is equal in taste and sweetness to that which grows in our gardens and as to Italy being the gar∣den of the world beautiful and fertile as some parts of it are the amazing quantity of barren mountains extending from almost the one extremity to the other should seem to deprive it of that character and how∣ever bold and uncommon the assertion may appear I think England a better resemblance of a garden than Italy and should not hesitate to oppose our verdure and inclosures to their myrtle and orangetrees which last are not to be seen in winter out of greenhouses except in the Southern parts of Italy  Their green pea of which they have but one sort is infinitely less delicious than ours and what is still more surprising few of their fruits excel ours I be∣lieve none except their watermelons their figs and their grapes An English gentleman at Naples who  imported his rasberry jam from England made iced rasberry of a much higher flavour than any made at Naples immediately from the fruit itself A noble Venetian procured a skilful gardener from England in hopes of improving the culture of his garden I conversed says  Sharp  with this gardener whom I found under a state of discouragement and despair he told me he had not yet ever tasted a peach in Italy of a true flavour and he believed he never should for that he was thwarted and obstructed by the other gardeners in his attempts to reform their practice that he had no authority over them but was confined to his own proper department which he told me would answer very little purpose  Here are also allum vitriol sulphur rock chrystal quarries of fine marble and a variety of minerals Glass works make a beneficial branch of trade as do the Neapolitan horses which are much esteemed  The creamcoloured horses such as draw our king's state coach are a common breed here and shine like satin here are some too of a shining silver white wonderfully elegant the ladies exhibit a variety in the colour of their cattle which draw them  Mrs  Piozzi  tells us that they shewed her at Naples a skewball or pyeballed ass well proportioned  coated like a racer in an English stud sixteen hands and a half high his colour bay and white in large patches and his temper singularly mild and gentle she could have purchased it for two pounds fifteen shillings English Hares and partridges are so tame in this country that they will run under the carriagewheels  Buffaloes are here common a peculiar cheese is made of their milk rolled up like stiff pieces of rib∣band Of their black shining horns they make snuffboxes and combs and a buffleather of their skins As this creature is unruly they lead them with brass or iron rings drawn through their noses The wool of their sheep is fine and good and they make a great deal of silk Of the filaments or a kind of hair or wool growing on some shellfish are made waistcoats caps stockings and gloves much warmer than wool and though not so fine and soft as silk yet always re∣taining a peculiar gloss  There are some disagreeable animals in this coun∣try though harmless one is the greenlizard of which there are great swarms common indeed to most other parts of Italy In spring says  Keysler  hundreds of these little animals are seen basking on the flat roofs and as they crawl up and down the walls if a window or door be left open they make their  way into the houses The scorpion is a much greater nusance which harbours not only in old buildings and under large stones but infests the houses in this country so that in some places it is not unusual to make the beadsteads of polished iron and to place them at some distance from the wall to prevent these vermin from getting into the beds It is true they seldom hurt unless attacked or accidentally injured which may easily happen by a person's turning in his bed  Another plague almost peculiar to the kingdom of Naples especially the Southern parts is the tarantula so called from the city of Tarento in which neigh∣bourhood it most abounds It is a large spider with eight eyes the bite or sting of which is cured only by music The patient under the venom of this in∣sect has extravagant vicissitudes of shrieking sobbing laughing dancing c They cannot bear the sight of black or blue but seem delighted with red or green objects they have an abhorrence also to eating fruit and vegetables A melancholy silence and a fixed eye are the first symptoms of this disorder at this time music is called in to rouse the patient to a violent motion and thus promoting a copious sweat Diffe∣rent patients are not affected but by different tunes They must be lively and chiefly with the guitar haut∣boy trumpet violin and Sicilian kettledrum The  country people says  Keysler  who are more or less skilled in all these instruments enforce the operation of their music with grimaces and odd gesticulations Several tunes are played before the right one per∣haps is found I mean the one that sets the patient a dancing which exercise is involuntary and heighten∣ed by playing quicker on the instruments When nature seems to be exhausted the music is suspended and the patient put to bed and sweated His spirits thus recovered he is called out of bed again by the same tune and dances till he faints with fatigue and falls then he is removed to his bed and thus in a few days the cure is compleated Sometimes it has been known to return the next year but the same prescription is always applied If no means of cure are applied the patient is carried off in a few days The petticoats of women are apt to harbour these vermin and of course they are more liable to be bitten than men  Swinburne  is of opinion that if persons bit by this insect are ever involuntarily affected it is an attack upon their nerves only a species of St Vitus's dance but he doubts the truth of the disorder and so do many others it having never been known to affect any but the very poor of this we shall say more hereafter  Among the natural curiosities of this country the Phrygian stone or the  pietra fringifera  may be  classed It has neither the hardness of stone nor the properties of earth but consists of an indurated mix∣ture of earth rotten beechwood and fibres of dif∣ferent plants from which being laid in a moist and shady place grow in a few days according to its size mushrooms weighing often twenty pounds each The seed lies in the substance of the stone and is distin∣guishable only from dust by a good microscope The growth of the mushrooms is greatly forwarded by pouring warm water on the stone There are other singularities which we shall speak of in the places where they are found  The Appenine mountains extend throughout the whole length of the country and terminate at the streights of Sicily Mount Vesuvius so well known for its fiery eruptions lies five Italian miles from the city of Naples but distinct from the Appenines Its declivity every where towards the sea is planted with vines and fruittrees and is no less fertile towards the bottom The circumjacent plain affords a charm∣ing prospect and the air is clear and wholesome The wine here produced is very delicious and of three sorts two are a yellow muscadine and the third abusively called  lachrymoe Christi  so called from the drops of juice oozing from the grapes when fully ripe of the latter the little that is made is reserved for the king's cellar who makes presents of it The South  and West sides of the mountain exhibit a very dif∣ferent view being like the top covered with black cinders fleck and stones On this dismal side the mountain is cleft asunder Its North peak resembles an inverted cone striking the eye with an accumula∣ted mass of stones sand and cinders and is properly the vulcano It has another peak called the Somma The North peak is three thousand six hundred feet above the level of the sea but the other peak only three thousand three hundred and thirty The black ashes with which the upper part of the mountain is covered render the ascent very tedious and toilsome though curious persons are assisted in climbing by the peasants fastening belts round their waists of which the climbers take hold and are thus helped up The higher we ascend the hotter is the ground and often rumbling noises are heard from within and in many places are clefts through which the smoke constantly issues Its mouth alters its form at every irruption and often the depth within is so considerable that cu∣rious persons have ventured down into it Prior to an irruption the mountain seems to give a warning of its rage by a dreadful noise shaking all the adjacent places and afterwards belching forth ashes and stones of three or four hundred pounds weight and casting them to the distance of some miles Several times as in the years and and much later than this a flaming stream of melted  sulphur metals and minerals has issued out of its crater or mouth as from a cauldron boiling over sweeping along with it large stones and ravaging the whole country through which it shapes its course When this fluid matter becomes cold it has all the hardness of stone and in some places stands in huge heaps sixty ells high which have been broken to pieces to pave the streets Naples is paved with this lava The inhabitants in the neighbourhood are pleased with a moderate eructation every year experience having taught them that then few or no shocks of earthquakes need be apprehended and these but slight There is such a quantity of combustible mat∣ter in the bowels of the earth in this part of the world that was it not for these tunnels or chimnies acting as vent for the fire earthquakes would be very frequent and it is remarked that Vesuvius and Etna in Sicily generally vent their fury at the same time Indeed as it is earthquakes are very frequent The city of Herculaneum was overwhelmed with a torrent of fire in the year and all its buildings buried within the earth seventy feet deep Pompeia shared the same fate and so lately as the year the whole province of Calabria was laid waste and the city of Messina in Sicily overthrown and up∣wards of forty thousand persons destroyed The earth shook so violently for many days that the in∣habitants near the sea coast on the streights of Sicily  ran out and lay upon the beach to avoid being crushed by the falling houses but unfortunately for them a promontory with a whole town upon it broke from the land and fell into the sea driving the waters before it which on their return over∣whelmed the beach and on their falling backwards into the sea again swept off with it all that were on the shore to the number of forty thousand So dreadful is this calamity  Mrs  Piozzi  arrived at Naples at two o'clock in the morning in very stormy weather at a time when Ve∣suvius was vomiting forth torrents of flaming lava down its sides and was the only object visible At this time thunder lightning rain and wind were contending for the mastery and combining to extin∣guish the torches brought to light her from her car∣riage She asked a Franciscan friar if it was the fa∣mous vulcano Yes replied he that's our mountain which throws up money for us by calling foreigners to see the extraordinary effects of so surprising a phe∣nomenon Such a calmness in such a storm was more says she than my senses could credit The blue lightning whose colour shewed the nature of the original minerals from which she drew her existence shone around us from time to time in a broad expanse and sudden darkness followed in an instant No object then but the fiery river could be seen till another flash  shewed us the waves of the sea tossing and breaking at a height inconceivable  Nothing sure was ever more awful or sublime than our entrance into Naples at that dead hour of night not a whisper to be heard in the streets and not a glimpse of light to lead us on our way but repeated flashes of livid lightning and the glare of the burn∣ing mountain My poor maid adds this lady had by this time nearly lost her wits by terror and my French valet exausted with fatigue beat down with the thunder claps and covered with rain and seaspray had just life enough to exclaim  "Ah madame Il me semble que nous sommes venus icy exprès pour voir le fin du monde"  And yet there are people who live at the foot of this mountain without any fear It is so prolific as to compensate for all this dread ask them if they are not frightened when the vulcano rages lest it should carry away their houses and they will tell you no so as we can raise our vines and oranges against it for three years for it acts as a hot wall our fortune is made and the house may go If the red river comes we can run away and hang the house  It has been discovered that the houses of the sub∣terranean city of Herculaneum of which we shall  speak more particularly hereafter which was built more than two thousand years ago were erected on foundations of this lava a manifest proof that the great irruptions of this mountain are not all sub∣sequent to that which swallowed up the city  Swinburne  is firmly of opinion that Vesuvius has been raised from the level of the plains by the sole action of fire contained in its bowels Indeed the isle of Rhodes that of Ascension and many in the Archipelago one which rose out of the sea in completely prove this assertion For what are islands but the tops of hills rising just above the water whose bases are at the bottom of the deep and of such a hill whose top does not emerge above the surface but lies a little below it as a shoal should be swelled by subterranean fires it would rise above the ocean and become an island  Half way up the mountain dwells a hermit in an excavation of the lava who profits so much by tra∣vellers climbing to its summit that the vulcano must rage indeed before he thinks of quitting his retire∣ment Experience has taught him when to expect an irruption and be will foretel it with a seeming pleasure Gentlemen stop here to regale and for as∣sistance to help them up Sometimes here are three or four fellows attending for that purpose who will  contend with their  couteaus  for the honour of leading the way and for the reward in consequence Fellows that if you were not armed would plunder you  About eight miles from Vesuvius is a halfextinct vulcano stiled by the ancients the Court of Vulcan by the moderns Solfatara though at such a distance from Vesuvius it has a subterraneous communication with that mountain Its form is circular hills of mo∣derate elevation surround it and notwithstanding the vicinity of the fire vines and fruittrees grow very well on the outer declivity the floor of the crater is white as chalk a kind of marly clay It has se∣veral fissures or chasms that emit smoke but it never flames The more Vesuvius rages the quieter Sol∣satara is The ground is every where hollow for if a stone be thrown upon it or the ground be struck with a hammer a long subterraneous echo ensues If a large stone be cast into one of the holes which have been dug the noise is little short of thunder It seems to be a vulcano burnt out and sunk into itself leav∣ing a craterlike ground inclosed with some remains of its sides surrounding it in an amphitheatrical form  In this neighbourhood are two or three famous lakes The first is that of Agnano lying in a valley and about a mile in circumference The water here  in many places boils up to the height of two inches without any sensible warmth It breeds a great num∣ber of wild ducks and other waterfowl and here the king sometimes comes for the diversion of shoot∣ing In a rock near its banks is the  Grotta del Cane  so called because a dog on whom the experiment is commonly made for half a crown and several are left there for the purpose forcibly held with his nose against the bottom is suffocated in a few minutes but if thrown within two minutes after into the lake recovers owing no doubt to the fresh air These sulphureous exhalations are also equally fatal to other animals The sweating baths are certain cells or chambers in the grotto of lake Agnano two of which have an aperture each exhaling a very hot steam so as to throw a person in them into a very pro∣fuse sweat used in venereal cases paralytic disor∣ders gout weakness of joints and internal impost∣humes  The second lake is the Lucina famous among the Romans for its fine oysters and abundance of fish It is now rather like a pond than a lake having been filled up by a mountain formed by an earthquake in the night of the th of September This mountain is five hundred perches high and five Italian miles in circumference  PLAN  of the CITY of NAPLES    New Castle    The Mole    The Great Co  on House    New

standing near it are supposed to be the remains of a temple of  Apollo  but I shall speak more of these lakes hereafter  In travelling through the kingdom of Naples and the Ecclesiastical state says  Sharp  an Englishman is struck at the scarcity of villages and cottages indeed one may almost assert that there is no such thing as a village or even cluster of houses approaching to the resemblance of a village As therefore the country is so thinly inhabited we find the towns swarming with people The towns stand on the summit of hills and at some distance afford a pleasant prospect being built with stone and the houses with flat roofs but when you enter within the walls a traveller is disgusted the houses are so offensively nasty and not only without glass to their windows but even without shutters and the marks of dirty poverty are so strong as almost to turn the stomach  There are many handsome cities in Italy particu∣larly Benevento Salerno Otranto Bais c and two  in Sicily namely Palermo and Messina but the metropolis of the kingdom of Naples and the city most visited by foreigners is Naples of this then we will now speak and of its environs  CHAP III  Of Naples  NAPLES says  Swinburne  is fabled to owe its foundation to a Siren and idleness that worst of Sirens seems to have spread its baneful influence over this favourite city which no length of time has been able to dispel It has never lost the soft vo∣luptuous character which it may be said to have re∣ceived from  Parthenope  its supernatural foundress The Crimeans formed a settlement in this bay about three hundred years after the Trojan war and called it their new town  Neapolis  Naples thus happily situ∣ated grew rich and populous It was during a short space of time the seat of war in the days of  Hannibal  but at almost all other periods enjoyed the most pro∣found  peace under the powerful dominions of the Ro∣mans It was suffered to live under its municipal laws worship its peculiar deities and retain its origi∣nal rites and language This indulgence was pur∣chased by a quota of ships to be furnished when de∣manded Thus maintained in peace and security Naples became the centre of polite arts the seat of re∣fined taste and luxury and a favourite residence of the rich and voluptuous citizens of Rome The em∣perors partook of the fashionable partiality for its climate and gave it many substantial marks of their predilection But the rougher policy of  Vespasian  altered its constitution and made it a Roman colony On the division of the empire Naples was assigned to the Eastern monarch and being connected with Greece by language and manners long preserved its allegiance to that crown under a kind of subordinate republican government It suffered severely from the Saracens who invaded Italy about the beginning of the ninth century King  Roger  after the reduction of every other place that now belongs to the King of Naples was voluntarily admitted here abolished the ducal government and assumed the title of King of the two Sicilies Naples at this time was large and strong but its bulwarks were demolished by the em∣peror  Henry  VI and levelled to the ground by his grandson  Conrad  The emperor  Frederick  II father of  Conrad  transferred the university of Bologne here  embellished the city with new buildings and repaired the old ones  Charles  I brother to  Louis  IX of France conquered it and brought it to perfection by fixing here his royal residence and the tribunal of justice  But  Charles  I was a tyrant It was in his reign that his ill usage of his subjects provoked them to invite  Conradine  the son of their late king who was also emperor of Germany to the inheritance of his ancestors  Conradine  the prince then in Germany was a spirited youth of seventeen he obeyed their summons but unfortunately lost his life in the expedition He was defeated betrayed taken prisoner and beheaded  Charles  at first consented he should be ransomed and sent an express to the empress  Margaret  his mother for that purpose but the tyrant altered his mind afterwards and put him to death with  Frederick  of Austria his cousin and com∣panion in the enterprise His afflicted mother arrived on the beach with a vast treasure for the ransom of her son and nephew but found only lifeless trunks to redeem from the hands of the barbarous conqueror Their deaths did not remain long unrevenged  Charles  and his Frenchmen rendered their yoke so galling to the Sicilians whose honour property and lives were become the sport of the licentious con∣querors that on EasterMonday the people  THE DEATH OF CONRADINE  INSURRECTION of MASSIANELLO  of Palermo raised the standard of revolt the whole island followed the example of the capital and a gene∣ral massacre ensued in which every Frenchman their wives and children to the number of eight thousand one man only excepted who was spared for his virtue was put to the sword without mercy an event known in history by the name of the Sicilian vespers  Charles  died three years afterwards of a broken heart The empress expended the money she brought to ransom her son in the erecting and beautifying the church of  Maria del Carmine  Every succeeding prince added something to the embellishment of Naples and it soon came to vie with the first cities in Europe for beauty wealth and numbers but ill provided for defence It actually threw open its gates to every invader and re∣ceived with submission whatever commander was the conqueror with some few exceptions only In it was taken by  Charles  VIII king of France but in the French were expelled and the crown fell to  Ferdinand  king of Spain at whose death it devolved on his grandson the emperor  Charles  V During the time the Austrian families were on the throne it was governed by viceroys and the peace of Naples was interrupted only by Turks French and a banditti till the year when the famous insurrection of Massaniello broke out This man was a fisherman who on account of some duties laid on fruit stirred up the people and found himself at the head of  men drove the viceroy into the castle ordered the heads of his opposers to be struck off before him and strutted about for a week the dictator of the Neapo∣litan republic He required the viceroy to abolish all taxes and to deliver up the writ of exemption granted by  Charles  V near years before This embarrassed the viceroy but to appease the people he forged a deed and sent it by the favourite of the people the duke of  Matalone  whom he had confined The fraud being discovered the duke was torn from his horse maltreated by the mob and afterwards com∣mitted to prison  Massaniello  was a day or two after killed for his misconduct by his own party and the rebellion was quelled  Naples the capital of the kingdom anciently Par∣thenope lies in ° ′ North latitude is situated partly on the side of a mountain and partly towards the sea lying in the form of an amphitheatre with the bay before it This is formed of two half circles with a promontory in the middle so as to wear the shape of the figure the town rising in an amphi∣theatre behind it It is large the walls being nine Italian miles in circuit but including the suburbs the entire circumference cannot be less than eighteen miles Most of the streets are handsomely paved the handsomest and that of the greatest length and breadth is the  Strada di Toledo  The breadth is twentythree common paces and after running in a  DUKE of MATALONE MALTREATED  direct line of fifteen hundred paces it is continued in an easy curved line for three hundred more and yet has not one palace in the whole length of it Mrs  Piozzi  says it is as strait as Bondstreet London as long as Oxfordroad very wide the houses all of stone and at least eight stories high in the heart of the city the streets are narrow and on account of the height of the houses gloomy Over the shops live persons of fashion but persons of very high quality have palaces in other parts of the city Though it is not says  Moore  one third of the size of London the number of inhabitants are computed at Many of the streets are more crouded than the Strand The streets not being lighted or watched at night is is a very dangerous place often after dark  That which the police and some remains of shame re∣strain in other parts especially in cities are here above all the controul of law The sulphur with which their vegetables and food are impregnated the continual use of chocolate and other laxatives occasion neces∣sities which will admit neither delay nor circumspec∣tion the courtyards of palaces and hotels the por∣ches of private houses the stairs and landingplaces are so many conveniences for passengers Persons will often throw themselves out of their coaches and mingle with the footpassengers every one taking  within the walls of others that liberty which he allows within his own  Veniam petimusque damusque vicessim  "Begging pardon and granting it by turns"  From this general liberty and the little care taken by an owner or tenant about the cleanliness of his hotel his house or landingplace it is easily to be supposed what filthiness and infection must be in a city so populous as Naples  There is however one pleasure in walking through the city the streets being well paved and kept in good order No heavy loads on carriages are suf∣fered to be brought into town The heaviest cart is that which carries wine all heavy burdens are brought on the backs of asses Marketgardeners bring in their vegetables by this conveyance and carry out their dung by the same means  The houses have all flat roofs paved with stone and a balustrade that one may safely walk on them numbers of flowerpots and fruittrees in boxes are placed on them and produce a very gay effect  Grosley  says they look like houses whose tops have been consumed by fire especially as the upper part of these houses is blackened by smoke and the va∣pours  of the air more than the middle parts A great number of stalls whereon eatables are exposed to sale and of balconies with lattice windows take off from the beauty of the streets but they are handsome notwithstanding This city does not in∣deed rival either Rome or Genoa in stately palaces yet it can boast of fine ones as also of a great number of fine fountains though the water in most of them is but indifferent Water is also conveyed to the city from the foot of Mount Vesuvius by a very grand aqueduct  The monasteries and convents of both sexes are one hundred and fortynine besides which are thirtyfour houses for poor boys girls and women eleven hospitals five seminaries for ecclesiastics four capital churches thirtytwo parishchurches seventy other churches and chapels and upwards of one hundred and thirty oratories or chapels of reli∣gious fraternities Most of the churches are deficient in good paintings and a fine front and their marble monuments are not of those magnificent dimensions as those which strike the eye at Rome but every thing else in beauty and richness surpasses all of the kind in other Catholic countries The value of the jewels and altarutensils being alone estimated at several millions of dollars  Il Duomo  or the archbishop's cathedral though Gothic is surprisingly fine it is dedicated to St  Ja∣nuarius  and in one of the chapels is the tomb of that saint he was bishop of Benevonto and is called the patron of the city They say he was murdered and that some of his blood is preserved in a glass phial which they shew but more of this byandby The dome of this cathedral is exceedingly rich in all sorts of sculpture painting gilding and marble The high altar is superb and its tabernacle set with the finest gems The most remarkable thing in this church is a chapel called  Il Tesora  the architecture of which is extremely beautiful In it are the statues of Saints  Peter  and  Paul  finely executed by  Finelli  and two pillars of black marble most beautifully spotted The door is of brass curiously wrought with festoons and foliage and cost thirtysix thousand  scudi  each scudi s d The chapel is of a round form and contains seven altars of the finest marble and fortytwo pillars of  Broccatello  Round the upper part of the wall stand twentyone large bronze images of saints each valued at four thousand scudi and under them are sixty large silver busts of so many saints Most of these bronzes are by  Finelli  The cupola was painted by  Lanfranco Domenichini  and  Parmeggiano  but these noble pieces have suffered by earthquakes that shook the cupola Behind the high altar which is detached from the wall and en∣tirely  of red porphyry is the shrine with silver doors where is kept the head of St  Januarius  and the two phials of his blood  In the area between the cathedral and Capua street stands a fine marble obelisk on which is erected a brass statue of St  Januarius  This obelisk is annu∣ally illuminated on the th of September with a splendour hardly to be conceived whilst a numerous band of music play by it and all the guns in the seve∣ral forts are fired on the occasion  Of the four catacombs hitherto discovered in Naples those of St  Januarius  are both of the great∣est extent and best kept This is a subterraneous burialplace hewn out of a solid rock the passages are sixteen feet high and arched and eleven wide That the Romans buried their dead long before the establishment of Christianity is out of dispute The bodies in these catacombs were deposited in cavities on both sides of the vaults one above another in a kind of ovens the mouths of which when full were closed up with a marble slab or with tiles There are passages branching out on each side but these are nar∣row In many parts they are said to extend seve∣ral miles but they are now walled up robberies c having been committed by banditti who used to  lurk in these vaults Guides with torches shew you these places  St  Maria Annunziata  is one of the finest churches in Naples for the eye every where meets with noble paintings statues monuments  basso relievos  c The gilding alone of the high altar and the chapel belong∣ing to it cost twentythree thousand crowns and the other ornaments enriched with  lapis lazuli  corne∣lian jasper agate and a profusion of other gems eighteen thousand ducats more each ducat s d The plate in the vestry of this church a few years since weighed above twentyone thousand marks  The hospital called  La Santa Casa  belonging to this church was once the best endowed in the whole world Its annual income amounting to two hun∣dred and fifty thousand pounds sterling All this was expended on the sick poor foundlings and other charitable purposes The children brought up here are generally about two thousand five hundred it being no uncommon thing in the night for twenty infants to be put into the wheel or machine which stands open both day and night for the reception of them and eight wet nurses attend every day The boys are brought up to trade and some to the church The girls according to their capacities do the necessary work of the hospital are employed in  the care and instruction of the children placed in a convent or married off with a portion of one hun∣dred or two hundred ducats In such portions ten thousand ducats have been expended in one year and fifteen thousand foundlings maintained If such women as are married become distressed widows or are deserted by their husbands or in case they are unhappy in such marriages without any fault of theirs they are readmitted and a particular apart∣ment allowed them for life The annual amount of the dowries to other women with which this house stands charged by several ancient legacies and foun∣dations was at least eighteen thousand ducats there being many noble families whose daughters at their marriage received two or three thousand dollars from this hospital The physicians c stood the house yearly in fourteen thousand ducats To the  Santa Casa  belong four other hospitals to which pa∣tients are sent for the convenience of warm bathing c Such was the state of this hospital at the begin∣ning of this century when it broke for above five millions of ducats on which its total ruin was feared but it was at last brought before an imperial com∣mission when all its revenues except fortytwo thou∣sand ducats a year were made over to the creditors till they were paid so that the girls portions now are re∣duced from two hundred ducats to fifty Other ex∣pences are proportionably diminished  Here is also an institution called  Sacra Monte della Pietà  whose revenue amounting to fifty thousand ducats is for two years lent out on pledges without interest in sums not exceeding ten ducats Many wealthy persons who either want opportunity or not being inclined to make purchases or lend on interest or mortgages place their fortunes here partly for se∣curity and partly for the benefit of the poor  The late king of Spain began a new palace at  Capo di Monte  but discouraged by the difficulty of access and procuring water he left it unfinished Twentyfour rooms however of this neglected palace are filled with the collection that was removed from Parma consisting of an invaluable set of pictures a library a fine cabinet of medals and a great number of cameos and intaglios particularly an onyx  tazza  eight inches in diameter but none of these valuable articles are hung up or properly disposed The books are unpacked and all is in confusion  In the palace of the prince  di Tarsia  is a library open for the public three days in a week There are several other good libraries but the principal one is the king's  Of all the palaces in Naples that of the king's is the most magnificent In the audienceroom are finely  painted the most remarkable actions of the Spanish nation The  sala Regia  where the carnival enter∣tainments are given is hung with the portraits of all the viceroys at full length A particular gallery is taken up with the exploits of the duke of Alva In another saloon is represented the war carried on by  Charles  V with  John Frederick  elector of Saxony In the palacechapel is a subterraneous communica∣tion a good resource for viceroys and courtiers to the  Nuovo Castello  by the seaside which is well gar∣risoned fortytwo pieces of ordnance are mounted on the walls and bastions among which are some taken by  Charles  V from the elector of Saxony at the battle of Muhlberg  Castello del Uovo  or Egg Castle so called from its oval figure stands in the sea upon a rock joined to the continent by a bridge two hundred and twenty paces long This castle is said to have been anciently the palace of  Lucullus  It is supplied with fresh water con∣veyed under the bridge  The third check upon the city of Naples is the castle of St Elmo It is situated on an eminence to∣wards the West and the plan is in the form of a star with six rays Its subterraneous works are very spa∣cious and hewn out of a rock to such a depth as to be bombproof on which account a great number of  military stores are here kept It can also be supplied with provisions from  Castello Nuovo  by means of a sub∣terraneous communication In the upper part of St Elmo's castle are seven cisterns of water and under the vaults and mines is a reservoir large enough for two galleys to sail on The water which is always extremely cold is drawn up by a bucket through a kind of aperture  One of the pleasantest parts of the city is the  Pi∣aggie  that is the Strand from its proximity to the seashore The coolness of the air the agreeableness of the prospect the extent of the area and its freedom from dust make it the evening resort of the quality so that it is no uncommon thing to see some hundreds of coaches here but on these occasions persons of different sexes never ride together in the same coach Nothing can be more delightful than the gardens to the righthand on the hill adorned with walks of orange cedar and palmtrees and a profusion of the most beautiful flowers  The bay of Naples is thirty miles in circum∣ference and twelve miles across The harbour is very spacious and has a grand lighthouse with a mole five hundred paces in length which separates the main harbour from the bason The latter is behind the New Castle and has generally in it four gallies the  crews of which both rowers and soldiers are obliged every Lent to come to confession and receive the sacrament  The harbour is formed by the mole which pro∣jects near half a mile into the sea It was begun to be built in It is in the form of a bending arm and about sixty feet broad consisting of large stones hewn and square so closely cemented that it stands unmoveable like a rock and braves the fury of the most impetuous waves In the middle of the elbow stands the lighthouse a beautiful lofty round tower at the end of the bending of the elbow is a small fort There is also a chapel near the middle of the mole where mass is duly said for ma∣riners The mole is broad enough for two coaches to go abreast and sufficient room for them to turn at the end It is the most agreeable public walk about the city and much frequented in summer evenings by persons of fashion to enjoy the  fresco  or refreshing breezes from the sea On each side the mole ships and other vessels are chained and from it is a beau∣tiful prospect of Mount Vesuvius the delightful coun∣try about Portici and the beautiful ascent of great part of Naples the houses and gardens appearing one above another almost to the castle of St Elmo The company here have constantly concerts of the finest music whose sounds are wonderfully sweet in a still evening owing to the water and add considerably  to the pleasures of the place The harbour for the gallies will contain about twenty defended by the old town of St Vincent now used as a place of con∣finement for disobedient children  Naples has several squares but they are small and irregular many of them have in the middle a short obelisk loaded with decorations far from pleasing to the eye but the finest is that of Medina opposite the new castle The upper bason is supported by the three Graces and on the top stands a superb  Neptune  attended by several other figures all ejecting water The town is well supplied with daily markets so that provisions are ever fresh and in great plenty Their wine is the best in Europe and both fish and flesh are extremely good There are two or three good inns for the ac∣commodation of travellers The apartments are in∣different but every thing else will be found good and the cooks excellent gentlemen may have a ready furnished lodging such as it is for there are few better than what we meet with in the poorhouses of Shoreditch and have their provisions from the inns Wines are exceedingly cheap nine gallons may be bought for s d and fellows who speak a little broken English are ready as  valet de places  to attend you every where but they are much greater knaves here than the generality of their fraternity  Some thousands of the populace called the  Laza∣roni  or blackguards have no other habitation than the streets and much the greater part of the other portion having no employ either from want of ma∣nufactures or their natural propensity to idleness are sauntering in the streets from morning to night and make those crowds at Naples which are not seen in other places but on festivals elections and other public days  These lazaroni says  Moore  are computed at above thirty thousand and have on some well known oc∣casions as the insurrection of  Massaniello  and others had the government for a short time in their own hands The greater part of them have no dwellinghouses but sleep every night in the streets under porticos piazzas or any kind of shelter they can find Those who have wives and children live in the suburbs near Pausilippo in huts or in caverns or chambers dug out of that mountain Some get a livelihood by fishing others by carrying loads to and from the shipping Many walk about the streets ready to run on errands or perform any labour in their power for a very small reward As they do not meet with constant employ their wages are not ade∣quate to their maintenance the soup and bread dis∣tributed at the gates of convents supply the deficiency The lazaroni are generally represented as a lazy  licentious and turbulent set of people but Dr  Moore  entertained a very different idea of their cha∣racter This idleness says he is evidently the effect of necessity not of choice they are always ready to perform any work however laborious for a reason∣able gratification It must proceed from the fault of government when such a number of stout active citi∣zens remain unemployed and so far are they from being licentious and turbulent that I cannot help thinking they are too tame and submissive Though the inhabitants of the Italian cities were the first who shook off the feudal yoke and though in Naples they have long enjoyed the privilege of municipal ju∣risdiction the external splendor of the nobles and the authority they still exercise on the peasants impose upon the minds of the lazaroni and however bold and resentful they may be of injuries offered by others they bear the insolence of the nobility as pas∣sive as peasants fixed to the soil A coxcomb of a  volanti  or running footman tricked out in a fantastic dress or any of the liveried slaves of the guests make no ceremony of treating these poor fellows with all the insolence and insensibility natural to their masters and for no visible reason but because he is dressed in lace and they in rags Instead of telling them to make way when the noise in the streets prevents the common people from hearing the approach of the car∣riage a stroke across the shoulders with the cane of  the running footman is the usual warning they re∣ceive Nothing animates this people to insurrection but some very pressing and very universal causes such as scarcity of bread every other grievance they bear as if it was their charter When we consider thirty thousand human creatures without beds or habita∣tions wandering almost naked in search of food through the streets of a wellbuilt city when we think of the opportunities they have of being together and of comparing their own destitute situation with the affluence of others one cannot help being asto∣nished at their patience  Let the prince be distinguished by splendor and magnificence let the great and the rich have their luxuries but in the name of humanity let the poor who are willing to work have food in abundance to satisfy the cravings of nature and raiment to defend them from the inclemencies of the weather  If their governors whether through weakness or neglect do not supply them with these they certainly have a right to help themselves Every law of equity and common sense will justify them in revolting against such governors and in satisfying their own wants from the superfluities of lazy luxury  Mrs  Piozzi  gives us a very different idea of this set of men and says that the natural indolence of the Neapolitans makes them regardless of the com∣forts and inconveniences of life As the weather is exceedingly warm the lazaroni who have but little care about appearances go with a vast deal of their persons uncovered except that of tatooing their shoul∣ders and legs as do the Indians with figures inde∣libly marked in their skin by gunpowder and other means The man who rows you about the delightful bay of Naples has perhaps the angel  Raphael  or the Virgin  Mary  delineated on one sunburnt leg the saint of the town upon the other and the glory or seven spirits of God upon his brawny shoulders They hate work says this lady and why Because they want for nothing having few desires A house would be an inconvenience to them and though many of them have decent clothes they throw them off till a time of gala and will sit by the seaside play∣ing at moro with their fingers  A Florentine nobleman continues Mrs  Piozzi  told me once that he asked one of these fellows to carry his portmanteau for him and offered him a  carlini  more in proportion to a Neapolitan than an English shilling would be to a London porter he had not twenty yards to go with it "Are you hungry master" cries the fellow "No replied Count  Ma∣nucei  "  but what of that"Why then no more am I" was the answer "and it is too hot weather to carry burthens" and so turned about on the other side and lay still  This class of people say this lady amounting to a number that even terrifies one to think of gives the city an air of gaiety and cheerfulness one cannot help rejoicing in The Toledostreet is one con∣tinual crowd Nothing can exceed the confusion to a walker and here are little gigs drawn by one horse which without any bit in his mouth but a string tied over his nose tears along with inconceivable rapidity a small narrow gilt chain to hold one set between the two wheels and no springs to it nor any thing else which can add to the weight and this flying car is a kind of  iacre  or hackney coach that will travel a mile for fourpence halfpenny or at the rate of a carlini or fourpence halfpenny an hour  The coat of arms belonging to Naples was an unbridled horse but one of their late kings put a bit into its mouth as an emblem of his having brought the Neapolitans to subjection  I have given my readers one reason of the popu∣lousness of the towns in the kingdom of Naples that of the country places being deserted Another  that fills Naples says  Sharp  is that it furnishes its own inhabitants and perhaps is the only metropolis in Europe that does so London Paris and other chief cities are supplied with the people from the country the luxury and expensiveness of large towns being so great an impediment to marriage and popu∣lousness they would all in the ordinary course of na∣ture be depopulated in a few years were they not an∣nually recruited from other parts but in Naples the case is different from a singular custom among the gentry in hiring married servants in preference to unmarried ones In Paris or London very few ser∣vants can hope to be employed who are not single and therefore an infinite number of this class of peo∣ple must pass their lives in celibacy as the instances in these cities are but rare where footmen and maidservants can support themselves after marriage by a different occupation  But in Naples it is almost an universal fashion to give their menservants boardwages not admitting them to sleep in their houses This naturally in∣duces them to marry giving them a settlement so essen∣tial to the character acquired here by all ranks of masters but what seems still more to facilitate ma∣trimony in this order of people is the prodigious number of young women ready to accept the first offer for in Italy they are not taken into service as  in England A nobleman who keeps forty men ser∣vants has seldom more than two maids and indeed it is so much the province of the men to do the housebusiness that they are employed all over the country even to the making of the beds This circumstance with the difficulty she has to acquire her living here by any other means is the reason why they seldom make an objection to the certain poverty attending on marriage The swarms of children in all the streets inhabited by the poor are such as will naturally result from this practice and as a married couple though they have six or seven children never occupy more than one room the extreme populousness of Naples must consequently follow from such causes  The lazaroni are such miserable wretches as are not to be seen in any other town in Europe Per∣haps among the ashes of our glasshouses in London we may find two or three beggars not unlike them and they are suffered to sun themselves a great part of the day under the palacewalls where they lie basking like dirty swine and are a much more nauseous spec∣tacle Being almost naked they suffer extremely in cold weather and were the climate less mild they would certainly perish even the greater part of the poor who work for their livelihood seldom wear shoes or stockings and their children never but notwithstanding the power of use the cold in the  winter months produces chilblains and sore legs to a piteous degree  To give my readers an idea of the starving life of the poor I shall only mention the wages of servants to which all kinds of wages are nearly proportionate A Neapolitan gentleman pays his footman five ducats a month a nobleman perhaps six All the quality who keep pages give them six or seven ducats with a livery once in two years and another for gala days only which lasts ten years but neither shoes stock∣ings nor washing With this sum they subsist them∣selves and families for this pay includes board wages nor are the tables of the gentry so amply provided here as to admit of the least depredation as is the case in England where married servants generally maintain their wives from their master's larder Now a ducat is about s d five of which make some∣thing less than s the whole monthly income of the greater number of livery servants in Naples The custom of vails is in a manner unknown except by great chance or at the beginning of the year when they receive a few trifling perquisites The genera∣lity of servants marrying very young their wives for the most part blest with a numerous progeny the cares of which are a sufficient occupation for the wise makes it that the labour of her hands can add but little to their stock The rent of a room for a month is a  ducat which leaves exactly fifteen shillings for cloath∣ing and maintaining the whole family After this de∣tail it will not appear strange that they seldom eat either meat or fresh fish but find themselves under the necessity of feeding chiefly on vegetables a cheap sort of cheese salt fish and a coarse bread which last is as dear at Naples as at London If it excites won∣der how they contrive to live on these wages it is still more so how it is contrived on four ducats or four and a half the usual price given by lawyers and tradesmen for every one here has the rage of keep∣ing a footman down to a set of housekeepers who hire one for the Sunday only and there are those who hire one on that day for an hour or two only so that some servants will let themselves out to three or four different masters on the same Sunday one in the morning another at noon and a third after dinner and so on This class of servants are wittily called  Domenichini  or Sundaymen  Domenica  signifying Sunday I must not omit to observe that in great families a few of the upper servants are not at boardwages but are dieted by their masters for the con∣venience of consuming what remains at table  The king's footmen receive only eight ducats and six carlines a month equal to l s d and two carlines a day extraordinary when his majesty is at any of his palaces out of Naples This extraordinary  allowance is granted them for their particular main∣tenance as they cannot partake of the same dinner with their wives and families  I shall close this account of the lowness of servants' wages with remarking that they all prefer a carline fourpence halfpenny a day for boardwages to the being maintained by their masters by which one may judge with what vile provision they can subsist They know nothing of the superfluities so common amongst our poor I mean the excessive use of strong and spirituous liquors a matter of such notoriety that I do not remember to have seen in the streets one drunken man or woman if I may except a few soldiers and a few valetsdeplace Indeed the custom or spirit of sobriety is rooted so deeply in their manners that the luxury they indulge is a passion for snow or icewater and lemonade You see the very dregs of the mob spending their farthings or halfpenny on a glass of those liquors in the coldest season of the year the same thing is practised by the great in a more elegant and expensive manner Perhaps the heat of the climate may have indicated this luxury first in the summer months but it is now become one of the necessaries of life and government has availed itself of the fashion by making a monopoly of the snow at Naples and selling it at a very high price about three farthings a pound  It is this cheapness of servants that accounts for the showy appearance some of the quality here make with small fortunes but what enables them also to support a large household and a vast quantity of coachhorses and carriages is the circumstance of confining themselves to that one luxury They have no expensive countryhouses and gardens no hounds no racehorses no parliament elections and in short no great demands for the education of their children disposing of all the girls in convents on very easy terms whilst they are children where they are left all their lives unless they provide them husbands for single young ladies are not suffered to appear in the world neither at spectacles nor visits The small expence of their tables also is another means of enabling them to figure away with equipages It is not usual here to dine or sup at each others houses and there are some who never do except only on Christmasday or perhaps during that week nay in general are they so unaccustomed to entertain one another that the greater number seldom receive their friends but upon weddings deaths and lyingsin They also carry their parsimony so far as to lock up their fine furniture in the intervals of these ceremo∣nies It is amazing at how small an expence the ge∣nerality of the first people live here as to their table It is not an uncommon thing says  Sharp  to contract with the cook or one of the upper servants to supply  their dinners at so much ahead and I shall scarcely be credited when I mention so small a sum as nine∣pence English wine included nevertheless this is a practice not only at Naples but at Rome and other parts of Italy and is a fact that may be depended on There are however a few exceptions amongst the no∣bility to this retired manner of eating There are some who when they entertain give the most splen∣did expensive and elegant dinners that can be con∣ceived The prince of  Franca Villa  when Mr  Sharp  was there in kept a kind of open table every night with twelve or fourteen covers where the English of any consequence were at all times re∣ceived with the greatest politeness Though it be not the custom to dine or sup with one another except on ex∣traordinary occasions their visits being merely conver∣sations some few exert themselves to give balls and even some of the merchants adopt this practice  Now I am mentioning visits it may be worth noticing a certain tiresome etiquette prevailing in this place of waiting in the streets on evening visits till two pages give in your name and bring down flambeaux to light you up stairs perhaps almost to the top of the house as the quality live generally a great height from the ground All this parsimony in other respects enables them I say to figure away with equipages and that they do more than in any other place in the  world Some of their princes have forty or fifty coachhorses more than twenty different carriages thirty forty or fifty domestic pages besides four five or six running footmen before their chariots A running footman seems almost an indispensible necessary of life here for a gentleman never rides post on the road near Naples nor takes an airing that is not preceded by one of these poor breathless fellows They are useful indeed in the streets for owing to the continual noise and bustle of the people many of them would be run over if it was not for these men to bid them get out of the way  The estates possessed by the dukes and princes here two or three excepted are not equal to those of our English nobility The prince of  Franca Villa's  is about thirteen thousand pounds a year and no prince makes a greater appearance at Naples than him The emoluments of the great officers of state and the salaries of all the king's servants are much smaller than in England The fees also of lawyers and physicians are trifling compared with ours and talents of every kind are but poorly recompensed so that affluence is not diffused through every street as in London but is confined almost within the narrow circle of the nobility The lordsteward lord chamberlain and master of the horse have each eighteen hundred ducats a year not three hundred and fifty pounds  sterling and about £ s a day for their table when the king is not at Naples The master of the horse has likewise a coach and six two running foot∣men and two footmen at the king's expence The lords of the bedchamber have but thirty ducats a month which is about seventy pounds a year and thirteen shillings a day for their table when the king is absent and there are no perquisites annexed to these offices It is therefore not to be wondered at that so many of the nobles with small estates though they have a place at court are obliged to live retired not∣withstanding the low prices of provisions and la∣bour  The royal palace forms a square with a court in the middle has a noble staircase which takes up one side The front is grand and well executed the architecture is bold and noble done by  Fontana  and originally intended as a palace for the viceroys when under the Spanish government A theatre is built in this palace very commodious for operas All the apartments abound in fine paintings and beau∣tiful tapestry The cielings have gold grounds with white ornaments There are red and white marble frames to the doors with figures and gilt plates on them The gardens reach to the seaside but are nothing extraordinary There is always here a splen∣did court and the nobility exceed those of the court  of France in their dresses and equipages When a lady of quality goes there she is conducted in the following manner she sets out alone in a gilded coach with glass windows behind as well as before This is preceded by another neat coach in which sits a person genteely dressed called her  Braceira  who hands her in and out of her coach Another coach follows wherein are four pages or more ac∣cording to her rank and a rich sedan chair is carried empty by two chairmen near the side of her coach When they reach the palace the braceira gets out and hands the lady into her sedan the pages walk∣ing two and two on each side richly dressed In this manner she is carried up stairs where she quits her sedan and the pages support her train which is some yards in length till she comes to the drawingroom door when it is buttoned up with loops The braceira and pages wait her return in the anticham∣ber when she is reconducted to her coach It is re∣marked that though the Neapolitan ladies dress them∣selves to great advantage they are not so beautiful in appearance as those at Florence and Rome The state coach of the king is said to have cost ten thousand pounds and is the most magnificent in Europe It is very large and richly gilt even the tire round the wheels It is usually drawn by six noble black horses whose harness is extremely rich and the reins of broad solid goldlace the carved work is the finest  imaginable and the painting so extraordinary that nothing can exceed it Instead of iron or brass these parts as well as the ornaments are silver and silver gilt  There is not says  Moore  a city in all the world with the same number of inhabitants in which so few seem to contribute to the wealth of the community by useful or productive labour as Naples but the number of priests monks fidlers lawyers nobility footmen and lazaroni surpass all reasonable proportion The king of Naples counts a hundred persons among his subjects with the title of prince a still greater num∣ber with that of duke Six or seven of these says  Moore  have from ten to twelve or thirteen hundred pounds a year a considerable number have fortunes about half that value and the annual revenue of many is not above one or two thousand pounds With respect to the inferior orders of nobility they are much poorer Many counts and marquisses have not above three or four hundred pounds of paternal es∣tate many still less and some few enjoy a title with∣out any estate whatever and yet many of them make a very splendid appearance I dined once says  Moore  with the duke of  Hamilton  at prince  Iacci  's we passed through twelve or thirteen large rooms before we arrived at the diningroom There were thirtysix persons at table and each guest had a foot∣man  behind his chair Other domestics belonging to the prince remained in the adjacent rooms and in the hall We afterwards passed through a number of other rooms in our way to one where there was a commanding prospect  When there is no opera the  Corso  or seashore is the great scene of Neapolitan parade The finest car∣riages are painted gilt varnished and lined in a richer and more beautiful manner than are yet become fashionable either in England or France They are often drawn by six sometimes by eight horses two running footmen gaily dressed precede the carriage and three or four handsome servants in rich liveries hang behind The ladies and gentlemen within the coaches glitter in all the brilliancy of lace embroi∣dery and jewels The carriages for gala days are purposely made with very large windows that those within may be seen Nothing can be more showy than the harness of the horses their heads and manes are ornamented with the rarest plumage and their tails set off with ribbands and artificial flowers in such a graceful manner as leads us to think they were dressed by those who dressed their ladies  After all you will imagine perhaps the amuse∣ment cannot be very great The carriages follow each other in two lines moving in opposite directions  The company within smile and bow and wave the hand as they pass and repass their acquaintance and doubtless imagine themselves the most important figures in the procession The horses however seem to be of a very different way of thinking and to con∣sider themselves as the chief objects of admiration looking on the liveryservants the volanti's lords and ladies as their natural suite on all such solemn oc∣casions  Under an appearance of giddiness levity and mer∣riment the commonalty and citizens says  Grosley  amidst labour and pleasure conceal deep and wellconducted views if not in every head at least as a body and as a body they form a democracy inde∣pendent of the king and of the nobility joining with the latter when their interest so requires The lower clergy and the majority of monks with whom Naples swarms never fail siding with them  The citizens of Naples thus form a society of their own perfectly distinct from the nobility and al∣though they are not the most industrious people in the world yet having some degree of occupation and their time being divided between business and pleasure they probably have more enjoyment than those who without internal resources or opportu∣nities  of active exertion pass their lives in sensual gratifications  The great theatre of St Carlo adjoining to the royal palace is vast noble and elegant as in de∣scribing this we shall describe every other Italian theatre they being all built on the same plan we will be the more particular The form is a truncated el∣lipse astonishingly spacious having six rows of boxes all round the house similar to the new operahouse in London thirty in each row except the two lowest out of which the king's box is taken and this is fronting the stage and occupies four of them and is on a level with the second range or row Each of these boxes like a room is furnished with a table pierglass ta∣pestry carpet canopy branches c is large enough to hold twelve persons standing but they are so nar∣row that only three ladies can sit in front the three next behind them to see must stand up so that all those behind these can see little or nothing The king's is a saloon and large enough to contain the royal fa∣mily and part of the court The orchestra will hold two hundred performers The pit contains fifteen rows of seats thirty in a row separated by broad rests for the elbow like arms of a chair besides an in∣terval all through the middle and a circuit all round under the boxes which will hold one hundred and fifty persons standing The seat of each chair in the pit  lifts up like the lid of a box and has a lock to fasten it There are gentlemen sufficient in Naples to hire by the year the first four rows next to the orchestra who take the key of the seat home with them leaving it locked by which means they are always sure of their place at any hour and as the intervals between the rows are wide enough to permit persons to pass with∣out disturbing others they are exceedingly conve∣nient The usual price for the season in which they give four new operas is twenty ducats about l s Those who do not hire seats by the year pay three carlines about thirteenpencehalfpenny for their place in the pit  The price of a box for the whole year is two hun∣dred and forty ducats or near l or a less price in proportion to the length of the season The three lower ranges are hired by ladies of distinct on for a year the other three are let out by the night but they must hire the whole box yet if any single stranger wishes admittance they are if properly re∣commended invited into the boxes of the nobility The nobility will let their boxes when they do not go themselves and often on gala nights or at the opening of a new opera will do the same for which they will get an exorbitant price sometimes fifteen ducats or more It is common not only to receive company in these boxes but to take ice and other re∣freshments  to sup and play at cards for the size of the theatre and the noise of the audience are such that the performers and band are but indistinctly heard except when a favourite air is singing but indeed the opera is considered more as a place of rendezvous than otherwise and this imperfection is not much attended to The season generally lasts from the fifth of November to the beginning of Sep∣tember  The decorations of the theatre instead of being like scenes represent some public place the inside of a temple or palace the whole on three large pieces two along the sides and one in front in which pain∣ters display all the magic of perspective It is the custom in Italy to light the stage only which renders the house dark and gloomy but on gala nights or when the king is present it is superbly illuminated The large glass in the front of each box against which two wax lights as large as torches are placed and other lights in the boxes and on the stage properly disposed make the house brilliant but the glare and the smoke is on the other hand offensive  Dark as the boxes are they would be much more so if those who sit in them did not at their own ex∣pence put up a couple of candles The ladies in the boxes and pit of the operahouse in London make a  more brilliant appearance than in the boxes at Naples where on common nights it is not possible to distinguish a feature across the house The gen∣tlemen in the pit do not in the whole make a good figure for though there are many officers well drest and other gentlemen yet the major part of the com∣pany are shabby consisting of persons who pay nothing such as the upper servants of ladies who hire boxes upper servants of ambassadors and some∣sometimes for a small fee to the doorkeepers such servants gain admission for friends The house and the stage is so large that in windy weather you would imagine yourself in the street the wind blowing so hard in the pit and boxes and it often occasions colds  The performers are not paid so liberally at Naples as at London but considering the difference in the price of things the pay of the capital singers does not fall much short of it  Gabrielli  had eighteen hundred sequins or nine hundred pounds sterling The first man has three thousand five hundred ducats the first dancer two thousand the first woman dancer fifteen hundred each ducat about three shillings and ten∣pence sterling  The  Impressario  or manager is bound to very hard terms so that his profits are inconsiderable The theatre being part of the palace the king reserves  for himself and officers fifteen boxes without paying any thing and the junto deputed by his majesty to supervise the opera reserve to themselves a right of nominating singers and dancers which obliges the managers sometimes to pay them an exorbitant price and to add to the misfortune the nobility here as in England are slow of pay and a manager must not compel them The womendancers by an order from court are obliged to wear black drawers  The exhibition is variegated by marches battles triumphs all in the most grand execution Battles are fought between numerous fencingmasters in rich uniforms and who appear all really fighting the clash∣ing of their weapons keeping time with the orchestra These battles are not without their cavalry and mount∣ed on horses from the king's stables or those of the first nobility In triumphs the car is drawn by the king's finesthorses caparisoned by the manager The in∣tervals between the acts are filled up with ballets to French music  Composers labour to rival each other in the music of the operas and thus frequently the same piece is set several times to music In  Metastatio's Demophoon  set by the celebrated  Sassone  the arietta  Misero Par∣goletto  in which  Timante  speaks to his son whom he holds in his arms the expression is of that nature  as to draw tears from the whole audience Clapping in Italy is a signal for an  encore  of course they never clap unless they wish to have the singing re∣peated and this is sometimes done to a fifth or sixth time and in these repetitions it is that the singer exerts every resource of nature and art to surpass himself in each repetition by the variety of gradations which he introduces into the trills modulations and whatever belongs to the expression Slight and quick as some of these gradations may be not one of them escapes an Italian ear they perceive them they feel them they relish them with a delight in Italy called "The foretaste of the joys of Paradise" where we hope there will be others equivalent for those nations equally good but whose organs are less sensible to the powers of harmony  There are two other theatres in which comic operas are performed without dances and there is a neat little playhouse in which they act comedies All the theatres are open on Saturday and Sunday evenings and each of them once in the week be∣sides  The playhouse says  Sharp  is hardly better than a cel∣lar and is usually called  Cantina  cellar being ten steps down from the street into the pit which holds seventy or eighty people when crouded the price a carline fourpence  halfpenny There is a gallery round the pit turn∣ed into ten or twelve boxes each holding four the price eight carlines for the box At such a price it is natural to suppose that the scenes dresses actors and decorations must be indifferent It will not how∣ever be so easy to imagine the shabbiness of the au∣dience which chiefly consists of men in dirty caps and waistcoats in the pit for the boxes are gene∣rally empty All the Italian gentlemen and ladies spit and indelicately not in their handkerchiefs or in a bye corner but in the cantina they spit all about them on the walls on your cloaths and their nasti∣ness is offensive to the last degree the exhibition is little better than buffoonery just as we see practised in England by  Merry Andrews  on the stages of moun∣tebanks and on the outside of booths at Bartholo∣mewfair  In the most respectable class of citizens are com∣prehended the lawyers of whom there are incredible numbers in this town The most eminent of this pro∣fession hold indeed a kind of intermediate rank between the nobility and citizens the rest are on a level with the physicians the principal merchants and the artists none of whom with all their industry can make great fortunes  But these citizens having fewer avocations and no public walks or gardens where they resort are more frequently seen sauntering and conversing in the streets In London and Paris the people who fill the streets are mere passengers hurrying from place to place on business They make no stop Whilst you sit in your chamber in either of these cities the usual noise you hear from the streets is that of the car∣riages but at Naples where they talk with uncom∣mon vivacity and where whole streets full of talkers are in continual employment the noise of carriages is completely drowned in the aggregated clack of human voices In the midst of all this idleness fewer riots or outrages of any kind happen than might be expected in any town where the police is far from being strict and where such multitudes of poor unemployed people meet together every day a proof that the national character of the Itali∣ans is quietness submission and good order and partly to the common people being universally sober  Mr  Addison  says that when a Neapolitan does not know what to do with himself he tumbles over his papers in order to start a lawsuit for bow other∣wise would the many thousands of lawyers be sup∣ported in this capital The first time Mr  Sharp  went to their  vicaria  that is their Westminsterhall he was  mortified in having set out so late from home finding the street crowded with advocates in their way to dinner but notwithstanding the difficulty he had of threading the multitude who were pouring out in such numbers he found when he had pushed into the hall almost as much pressing as is usually met with the first night of a new play at the London theatres  Northall  informs us that the inhabitants of Naples are divided into  Titolati Mobili de Seggio Nobilita fuori de Seggi Civilta  and  Plebe  To the first order belong the princes and nobility to the second all the natives of the country with all strangers settled at Naples and living in a noble manner in the third are ranked doctors in all sciences lawyers notaries officers of the courts of judicature physicians ban∣kers jewellers goldsmiths silkmerchants and booksellers the fourth class comprehends all the rest of the inhabitants  Naples with respect to its municipal police is di∣vided into six  seggis  or wards five of which are go∣verned by a committee of nobles the other belongs to the plebeians and is distributed into twentynine quarters under the direction of an  Eletto  or mayor These wards meet in open porticos which alternately have the honour of being the theatre where in the  month of May the blood of St  Januarius  is liqui∣fied as will be spoken of hereafter  The city having as has been observed neither watchman nor lamps one father  Rocco  a Dominican has persuaded the people to subscribe oil for lamps to burn before images he fixes these up in the most convenient places and thus turns their devotion to public account  Provisions I have observed are plentiful and cheap poultry game and fish are abundant fruit and ve∣getables are to be had all the winter The wants of na∣ture are so easily satisfied says  Marlyn  that the lower class of people work but little their great pleasure is to bask in the sun and do nothing The lazaroni wallow about like swine Persons of a middle rank pass much of their time in coffeehouses few pursue their callings with any degree of zeal or activity  Architecture is by no means in a good taste at Naples Of three hundred churches and upwards there is not one says  Martyn  with a front or portico which has any merit many of them present nothing but a bare wall They endeavour to make amends by abundance of interior decorations There is a pro∣fusion of gilding and painting in them but their pain∣ters  have been corrupted by the national taste for brilliancy and extravagance  However to rescue this fine city from the accusa∣tion of a bad taste in its public ornaments the king has caused the Farnesian bull to be transported from Rome in order to have it placed on the great foun∣tain in the walk of the royal villa This immense group consists of six figures larger than life and many smaller ones together with the rock in which they are represented all said to be hewn out of one block of marble It was originally brought from Rhodes to Rome and placed on Caracalla's baths It represents  Amphion  and  Zetus  who by order of  Antione  their mother are binding  Dirce  to the horns of a wild bull  I Stadii Publici  are the buildings of the university made from designs of  Fontana  The front is adorned with antique statues found at Crema Professors read lectures here on all the sciences  There are in this city three conservatories for the education of boys in the profession of music These furnish a band for the church of the Franciscans morning and evening during eight days in Oc∣tober  The monasteries of this city are exceedingly rich There are not less than one hundred and seventyeight of them including those hospitals that are under the directions of the monks and as the monks are the hereditary counsel of the populace it is evident they do not want for counsellors The monks who con∣verse with the nobility and the citizens are very stu∣dious and artful in scenting inheritances and leave no stone unturned to procure for their houses either presents or partial legacies when they cannot grasp the whole To the success of these practices are owing those amazing riches which are displayed in the decoration of their churches in the brilliant and very costly spectacles frequently given there and in the enormous quantity of plate with which their societies are crowded The churches of Naples are perhaps as rich in this kind as all the churches of Italy put together  But though they covet riches they are never∣theless charitable there being no poorrates in Ro∣man Catholic countries as in England the poor de∣pend upon the benevolence of the people and there are numbers of families every where that distribute their donations to the necessitous at certain appointed times some once a week some oftener The con∣vents generally feed the poor on certain days who flock to the convents for what they have to dispose  MONKS feeding the POOR  of At these times the friars not only give their waste meat but dress provisions purposely to give away and thus gladden the hearts of many  Every monastery has a good laboratory which brings in considerably Most of the monks practise physic Every laboratory is celebrated for some pe∣culiar medicine or conserve which is not made any where else and for these it has a sure demand  I will close this account of Naples with a declara∣tion of Mr  Sherlock  Though it has many disagree∣able circumstances attending it so that a man who could live out of it would not like to be an inhabi∣tant of the place yet there are a variety of things that will attract a traveller to view it perhaps in pre∣ference to most other cities of Europe but chiefly an account of the delightful scenes around it It is not surprizing says  Sherlock  that  Virgil  sh  uld make such fine verses at Naples the air is so soft and so pure the sun so brilliant and so warm and the face of nature so rich and diversified that the imagination feels a vivacity and vigour which it scarce ever per∣ceives in other countries  I am not a poet but I am one fond of verses and I have never read them adds he with more pleasure than here Every time I went to my window I felt  myself electrified my spirits revived my imagination grew warm and my soul became susceptible of the softest and sublimest impressions and no wonder when the objects that present themselves to my view are recited  On the right the hill of Pausilippo whose form is semicircular and adorned to its summit with trees and pleasure houses from its point which loses itself in the sea this mountain increases insensibly till it ar∣rives behind the centre of Naples and on its summit is seen a vast tower overlooking the city and crown∣ing the scene On the left a chain of vast high mountains surrounding the opposite side of the gulph or bay of Naples and whose rugged boldness forms a most happy contrast with the elegant and cultivated beauties of Pausilippo  Shakespere  and  Corneille  would have looked to the left  Racine  and  Pope  to the right  Of those mountains on the left Vesuvius is the most interesting by its form which is a very beautiful cone by its height and above all by its vicinity to the city It smokes incessantly and seems to threaten Naples with the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah an awful scene it is true yet sublime and grand to the extreme At its foot is Portici and all along the coast  BAY of NAPLES  are towns hanging from the mountains which form the portion of a circle of ninety miles  The sea under my windows and besides the ideas which that sea presents as the most interesting object in nature next the sun by its grandeur its beauty and its variety of appearances it here shews all the riches of commerce by large ships passing and re∣passing every moment Often did I rise before day to enjoy the breezes of the morn and the setting of the sun In no horizon does he appear with more splendor no where does he so well deserve the epi∣thet of  Golden  He rises behind Vesuvius to illumine the pleasant hill of Pausilippo and the bosom of the most beautiful bay in the universe smooth as a mir∣ror and all in motion by the vessels The object that terminates the perspective is the island of Caprea fa∣mous for the retreat of  Tiberius  and the rocks of the Syrens on viewing it we call to mind that near these rocks the prudent  Ulysses  stopped his ears and that not far from hence the less wise  Hannibal  gave him∣self up to the pleasures of harmony and the caresses of the seducing  Camilla  CHAP IV  Of the People Character c  THE people both of city and country are vigo∣rous robust rawboned full of fire and spright∣liness active indefatigably laborious and in a word cut out for war they are not any thing like the Ita∣lians of Upper Italy They pride themselves in being descended from the Greeks and resembling them They are broad and fullchested with a short thick neck fleshy with a fine complexion and a very brisk eye They go with the neck and shoulders breast and arms almost naked I do not include in this picture the substantial citizens nor the lawyers nor the nobility These classes who are no less pru∣dent from system than the people from instinct de∣vote themselves to idleness as they did in  Ovid  's time and sacrifice to pleasure all the advantages of a happy constitution and a fiery temperament They are the most voluptuous of men but yet Naples though without so much as the shadow of police knows very  NEAPOLITANS  little of those disorders which all the magistrates' vi∣gilance at Paris and London can scarcely prevent This as I have observed must arise chiefly from their sobriety and passive disposition  The women and children do not look so healthy here as in other parts of Italy A great number of women are observed to have wens in their throats as bad as in some other countries owing to their drinking in summer so great a quantity of snowwater  The common dress of the ordinary women which ladies likewise adopt if they venture abroad on foot and wish not to be known are two black silk petti∣coats which serve entirely to conceal their whole figures as when both are tied round the waist one is suddenly turned up and as they pull it quick over their heads a loose trimming of narrow black gauze drops over the face whilst a hook and eye fastens all close under the chin and gives them an air not un∣like our country wenches who throw the gown tail over their heads to protect them from a summer shower The holliday dresses of the peasants round Naples are very rich and cumbersome We often see says Mrs  Piozzi  a great coarse rawbone fellow panting for heat under a thick blue velvet coat co∣mical enough the females in a scarlet cloth petticoat with a broad goldlace at the bottom a jacket open  before but charged with heavy ornaments and the head▪ not unbecomingly dressed with an embroidered hankerchief from Turkey  Swinburne  says the young countrywomen are in general far from handsome though they have fine eyes and handsome features their hands and feet are clumsy their shapes neglected their necks not firm and their skins discoloured by living so much in the sun without bonnets Amongst them we may find almost every mode of hairdressing seen in the Greek and Roman coins The  coiffeure  of the younger  Faustina  with the coil of plaited hair upon the crown of the head occurs frequently in the old town that with the coil lower down which may be properly stiled  Lucilla  's headdress is common among the younger part of the sex in the suburbs of Chiaia and  Plotinas  among the women more advanced in years Very little suffices to cloath the lazaroni except on holi∣days and then he is indeed tawdrily decked out with a laced jacket and flamecoloured stockings his buckles are of an enormous magnitude and seem to be the prototype of those with which our present men of mode load their insteps The women are also very splendid on such days of show but their hair is then bound up in tissue caps and scarlet nets Ci∣tizens and lawyers are plain enough in their apparel but the female part of their family vies with the first  court ladies in expensive dress and all the vanities of modish fopperies Luxury hath of late advanced with gigantic strides at Naples Forty years ago the Neapolitan ladies wore nets and ribbands on their heads as the Spanish women do at this day and not twenty of them were possessed of a cap but hair plainly dressed is a mode now confined to the lowest order of people and all the distinction of dress between the wife of a nobleman and that of a citi∣zen is entirely laid aside Expence and extrava∣gance are here in the extreme the great families adds  Swinburne  are oppressed with a load of debt the working part of the community always spend the price of their labour before they receive it and the citizen is reduced to great parsimony almost to pe∣nury in housekeeping in order to answer these de∣mands of external show Short commons at home whet his appetite when invited out to dinner and it is scarce credible what a quantity of victuals he will devour The nobility in general are well served and live comfortably but it is not their cus∣tom to invite strangers the number of poor depen∣dents that dine with them and cannot properly be introduced into company prevents the great families from inviting foreigners another reason may be their sleeping after dinner in so regular a manner as to undress and go to bed No ladies or gentlemen finish their toilets till the afternoon on which account  they dine at twelve or one o'clock The great of∣ficers of state and ministers live in a different style and keep sumptuous tables to which strangers and others have frequent invitations  The establishment of a Neapolitan grandee's house∣hold is on a very expensive plan The number of ser∣vants and equipages would suffice for a sovereign prince and the wardrobe of their wives is on the same magnificent scale yet no lady of whatever rank or fortune has more than one hundred ducats a month for pinmoney At the birth of every child the hus∣band makes his wife a present of one hundred ounces of silver and some valuable trinkets according to his fortune  The king takes very little state upon him he lives among his subjects with the old Roman idea of a window in his heart he rides and rows and hunts the wild boar says Mrs  Piozzi  and catches fish in the bay and sells it too at market as dear as he can but gives away the money directly so that he is very much beloved The people know the worst of him that is he shoots at the birds dances with the girls eats macaroni and rows against the watermen in the bay One of them when this lady was there by his un∣courtly effort she adds to outrow the king strained himself and bled much at the nose this accident made  the king conqueror and he won the trifling wager that was laid between them laughed and leaped on shore amid the acclamations of the populace who huzza'd him home to his palace from whence he sent double the sum he won to the waterman's wife with other tokens of kindness For whilst he resolves to be happy himself he is equally determined to make no man wretched When the Emperor and the Grand Duke his brothers in law talked to him of their new projects for reformation in the church he told them that he saw but little advantage they brought into  their  states by these new fangled notions that when he was at Milan and Florence the deuce a Neapolitan could be found in either whilst his capital was crouded with refugees from them that in short they might do  their  way but he would do  his  that he had not now an enemy in the world public or private and that he would not make himself any for the sake of propa∣gating doctrines he did not understand and could not take the trouble to study that he should say his prayers as he used to do and had no doubt of their being heard whilst he only begged blessings on his be∣loved people so if these wise brothersinlaw would see him enjoy life instead of shortening it by unne∣cessary cares they might come and see him the next morning play a match at tennis  The truth is the jolly Neapolitans lead a coarse life but an unoppressed one Marks of abundance are seen in all parts of the town There is no settled market in any place but every third shop almost is full of what the French call so properly  ammunition de bouche  whilst whole boars kids and small calves dangle from a sort of neat scaffolding all with their skins on and make a pretty appearance Poulterers hang up their birds in the feathers too not lay them on boards plucked as they do at Venice and London The principal streets says  Swinburne  are lined with sellers of macaroni fried and boiled fish puddings cakes and vegetables of all sorts where for a very small sum which the lazaroni earn by running of an errand or picking of pockets he may find a ready meal at all hours The flaggon hanging out at every convent invites him to quench his thirst with wine or if he prefers water as most of the poor do there are stalls in all the thoroughfares where lemonade and iced water is sold The passion for iced water is so great and so general at Naples that none but mere beggars will drink it in its natural state and a scar∣city of bread would not be more severely felt than a scarcity of snow It is brought in boats every morn∣ing from the mountains behind Castelamare and is farmed out at a great rent by the Jesuits  In the Christmas season the Italians are peculiarly ingenious in decorating their shops and setting out their wares Every grocer fruiterer c mingles orange lemon and myrtle leaves among the goods exposed at his door as we do evergreens in our churches but with infinitely more taste Some odd pretty moveable coffeehouses too or lemonadeshops set on wheels adorned with gilding painting c and covered with ices orgeats and other refreshments as it were in emulation each of the other and in a strange variety of shapes and forms help towards the finery of Naples I have counted thirty adds Mrs  Piozzi  of these  galante  shops on each side of the street which with their necessary illuminations make a brilliant figure by candlelight till twelve at night when all the show ceases and every one puts out his candle and goes to bed Till that hour how∣ever few things can exceed the merriment of Naples while  volantes  or runningfootmen dressed like tum∣blers before a show precede all carriages of distinc∣tion and endeavour to keep the people from being run over yet whilst they are listening to some street orator as shall be presently described they often get crushed and killed yet as Pope says  See some strange comfort every state attend  The lazaroni who has his child run over by a man of quality has a regular claim on him for no less than twelve carlines about five shillings English If it is his wife he gets two ducats live or die and for the master of the family not a housekeeper for house he has none three ducats is the settled compensation for they do not stand here for  trifles  The truth is human life is lower rated in all parts of Italy than with us They think nothing of an individual but see him perish except by the hand of justice as a cat or a dog A young man says this same author sell from our carriage one evening at Milan a friend whom our coachman had picked up There was a crowd in the street and an  embarras  and the fellow tumbled from behind and died on the spot No one even spoke upon the occasion or I believe  thought  about the matter except one woman who supposed he had neglected to cross himself when he got up be∣hind  In Naples says Dr  Moore  they are accustomed to street orators these are men who spouterlike will repeat stanzas from  Ariosto  or any other poet in a pom∣pous recitative cadence peculiar to the natives of Italy and who hold the book in their hands in case their me∣mory should fail them They occasionally comment on the passages they recite in prose in order to bring the poet's expression nearer to the capacities of their  hearers The Doctor tells us he listened to one some time and that his auditory increased every mo∣ment men women and children bringing seats from the neighbouring houses to sit down round him His cloak hung loose from one shoulder his rightarm being disengaged for the purposes of oratory Sometimes he winds it with a slow smooth motion according with the cadence of the verses sometimes he pressed it to his heart to give energy to the pathos of the poet Now he gathered the hanging folds of the right side of his cloak and held them gracefully up in imitation of a Roman senator and anon he swung them across his left shoulder like a citizen of Naples he humoured the stanza by his voice which he could modulate to the key of any passion from the boisterous bursts of rage to the tender notes of pity and of love But when he came to describe the exploits of  Orlando  from  Ariosto  he trusted neither to the power of his own voice nor the poet's genius but throwing off his cloak and grasping his cane he assumed the warlike attitude and stern countenance of that hero representing by the most animated ac∣tions how he drove his spear through the bodies of six of her enemies at once the point at the same time killing a seventh who would also have remained transfixed with his companions if the spear could have held more than six men of an ordinary size upon it at a time  The knight of Aglant now has couched his spear  Where closely prest the men and arms appear  First one and then another helpless dies  Thro' six at once the lance impetuous flies  And on the seventh inflicts so deep a wound  That prone he tumbles lifeless to the ground  HOOLE  His audience illiterate as we may suppose them seemed to feel the pathetic and sublime as well as the ludicrous parts of the ancient bard  At Rome these streetorators entertain their au∣dience with entertaining passages from history that whilst it amuses the populace and keeps them from less innocent and more expensive pastimes it gives them some general idea of history Streetorators therefore are a more useful set of men than another class of which there are numbers at Rome who en∣tertain companies with extemporaneous verses on any given subject and who are called  Improuvisatori  Little concerts of vocal and instrumental music are heard every evening in some particular street and on the beach of the bay and young men and women are seen dancing to the music of ambulatory per∣formers  To the mere spectator the amusements of the com∣mon people afford more delight than those of the great because they seem to be more enjoyed by the former than the latter After insipid characters in high life whose internal vacancy leads them to seek amusement in public places and whose insensibility prevents them from finding it have probably brought this appearance of a want of all enjoyment into fashion those who wish to be thought of what is called the  Ton  imitate the mawkists insipidity of their superiors in rank and imagine it distinguishes them from the vulgar to suppress all the natural expres∣sions of pity joy or admiration and to seem upon all occasions in a state of complete apathy These amiable creatures frequent public places that it may be said of them "They are not as other men are" You will see them occasionally at the playhouses placed in the boxes as so many frights with unchang∣ing features and whilst the rest of the audience yield to the emotions excited by the poets and the actors these men of the Ton preserve the most distressed se∣renity of countenance and except pronouncing from time to time  Pshaw  and  Stuff  one would think them the express representation of the Pagan gods who  have eyes but do not see and ears but do not hear  Not so a Naples auditory no busts that gather round the street orators here I saw very lately says  Moore  a large cluster of men women and children entertained to the highest degree and to all appear∣ance made exceedingly happy by a poor fellow with a mask on his face and a guitar in his hands He assembled the crowd by the songs that he sung ac∣companied by his instrument and by a thousand merry stories he told them with infinite drollery This assembly was in an open place facing the bay and near the palace The old women sat listening with their distaffs spinning a coarse flax and wetting the thread with their spittle their grandchildren sprawling at their feet and amused with the twirling of the spindle The men and their wives the youths and their mistresses sat in a circle with their eyes fixed on the musician who kept them laughing for a great part of the evening with his stories which he introduced occasionally with tunes on the guitar At last when the company was most numerous and at the highest pitch of good humour he suddenly pulled off his mask laid down his guitar opened a little box that stood before him and addressed his audience in the following words "Ladies and Gen∣tlemen there is a time for all things we have had jesting enough innocent mirth is excellent for the health of the body but other things are requisite for the health of the soul I will now with your permission  my honourable masters and mistresses entertain you with something serious and of infinitely greater im∣portance something for which all of you will have reason to bless me as long as you live" Here he shook out of a bag a great number of little wooden crucifixes "I am just come from the holy house of Loretto my fellow Christians" continued he "on purpose to furnish you with these jewels more pre∣cious than all the gold of Peru and all the pearls of the ocean Now my beloved brethren and sisters you are afraid that I shall demand a price for these sacred crosses far above your abilities and some∣thing correspondent with their value by way of in∣demnification for the fatigue and expence of the long journey I have made on your account all the way from the habitation of the blessed Virgin to this thrice renowned city of Naples the riches and libe∣rality of whose inhabitants are celebrated all over the globe No my generous Neapolitans I do not wish to take the advantage of your pious and liberal dispositions I will not ask for these invaluable cru∣cifixes all of which let me inform you have touched the foot of the holy image of the blessed Virgin which was formed by the hands of St  Luke  and moreover each of them has been taken in the  Santissimo Scodella  the sacred porringer in which the Virgin made the pap for for the infant  Jesus  I will not I say ask an ounce of gold no not even a crown of silver my  regard for you is such that I shall let you have them for a penny a piece"  This morsel of eloquence no doubt was a great pennyworth and when we recollect the sums that some men are paid for their oratory in England though they never can produce so pathetic a spe∣cimen we must naturally conclude that eloquence is a much rarer commodity in England than in Italy  Writers seem to attribute to the Neapolitans a barbarity of disposition  Sherlock  says they are good people but have adopted by instinct the citizen of Geneva and they cultivate neither the arts nor the sciences through fear of corrupting their morals If the nation is barbarous it is far from being harsh or severe on the contrary it is very goodnatured and desirous of contributing to the pleasure of foreigners They are naturally good but are absolutely in the state in which nature produced them and they perpetrate all crimes and are guilty of all sorts of rudeness without being conscious of doing wrong Having had no education they have no principle A man of the first quality will tread on your toes and not make you the least apology acquainted with you the next day he cannot do enough to oblige you he will carry you to a concert offer you his box at the theatre he will do all he knows but all he knows is  little It is the same with the women they have all an inclination to be amiable but they know not how  The race of Sirens are not yet extinct here there are many young women who sing divinely of Circes there are scarce any but we see in the assemblies several of the companions of  Ulysses  The easiness of the women and the Scirocco enervate the bodies of the men and music enervates their souls so as to ren∣der useless all the beauties which nature has lavished on this charming country In no other place will be found more natural talents or more circumstances fa∣vourable to the arts but the causes abovementioned added to the indolence inspired by the climate and the absolute want of Maecenases to patronise them render Naples as savage as Russia and as a proof of this assertion all the Russians that visit the place are struck with the resemblance between the Neapolitans and their countrymen  After giving my readers the opinion of Mr  Sher∣lock  who seems to write with a tenderness for human nature It may not be amiss to observe what  Keysler  says upon this subject According to some says he there is a greater evil still remains than either the scor∣pion or tarantula The worst creatures say these people in this delicious country are the inhabitants themselves who besides their execrable and unna∣tural  lusts are of a vindictive treacherous and bloody disposition  Though national charges generally imply ignorance narrowness of soul and uncharitableness it is certain that the history of Naples almost beyond any other abounds in sad instances of excessive depravity of hu∣man nature  Tophana  the noted female poisoner who first invented the  Aqua Tophania  was living in prison when  Keysler  was there and few foreigners left Naples without seeing this infernal hag She was a little old woman who had entered into a kind of religious sisterhood and on this account if not on a worse her life was spared She is said to have poisoned some hundreds of people and was remarkably liberal of her drops which she gave by way of alms to wives who from several intimations she knew would not be inconsoleable for the loss of their husbands Five or six drops of this liquid would dispatch the person who took them and they could be lowered or tem∣pered so as to take effect in any determinate time This water says  Keysler  still continues to be privately made at Naples under the appellation of  Acquetta di Napoli  and not many years since a small cask of it was according to orders sent to a certain country but since lemonjuice has been found an antidote against it this vile composition has fallen into some disrepute  It must be in consequence of the precariousness of punishment says  Sharp  that this city furnishes many more delinquents in proportion to its size than our wicked London There are in the prisons at Naples generally between two and three thousand some say more besides about two thousand in the galleys lying in the harbour Even murderers sometimes escape unpunished It is scarce credible but a magistrate of this city declared to a gentleman who was asking some questions on the subject that the preceding week the populace had been very orderly for that only four murders had been committed This adds  Sharp  I had from a noble Neapolitan who attested it as a fact perhaps it might be exaggerated but they cer∣tainly do not hold murder in so horrid a light here as in colder climates A young gentleman informed me that on the road to this place from Rome he saw at a distance a scuffle among some postillions in which as it turned out afterwards one of them was stabbed dead On enquiry into the matter he was cooly an∣swered that it was only a  colpo di coltello  a stab with a knife  The indifference with which the crime of mur∣der is regarded among the lower classes of the Italians is further illustrated by the following anec∣dote A gentleman of Naples in passing occa∣sionally before the king's palace had frequently no∣ticed  a man of singular appearance at work He was chained to some others and assisted in removing rub∣bish and bringing stones for a new building the foundation of which had just been laid The man by having often seen him pass recollected his person and always took off his hat as he found an oppor∣tunity The gentleman not knowing how to account for his attention was induced one day to inquire the cause of his civility and of his chains To the first part of the query he answered in the Neapolitan style that it was "  il suo devere  his duty" and to the second he said that he was in that predicament for  una minchionerioe  a trifle"  "Ho ammazzata solamente una donna"  said he "I have only killed a woman"  The inhabitants of this country says  Keysler  have in all ages been remarkable for a voluptuous manner of living The luxury of Capua and Atella is well known and Naples is by  Ovid  stiled  in otia natam  Parthenopen  "Naples of luxury the native seat"  It must be owned that in no great city in Europe are the prostitutes so numerous and abandoned These  Donne libere  as they are called amount to eighteen thousand in this one city and one particular  part of it is a receptacle for two thousand and yet it is no uncommon thing for ecclesiastics to lodge in these infamous parts of the town This totally cor∣rupts all the youth and the clergy being exempt from the civil jurisdiction and connived at by their supe∣riors that the sacred order may not be disgraced by punishments set the worst of examples  They tell us says  Moore  that the very air of Italy contributes to its profligacy  Propertius  intreats his  Cynthia  not to remain too long on shore which he seems to think dangerous to the chastest maiden  Tu modo quam primum corruptas desere Baias  Littora quoe fuerant castis inimica puellis  That is "I intreat you to forsake as soon as possible the corrupt coast of Baia a coast most unfriendly to modest maidens"  Martial  asserts that a woman who came here as chaste as  Penelope  if she remained any time would depart as licentious and depraved as  Helen  I have certainly met with ladies after they have resided some time at Naples who in point of character and con∣stitution were thought to have much stronger resem∣blance to  Helen  than  Penelope  but as I have no  faith adds  Moore  in the sudden operations of phy∣sical causes in matters of this kind I never doubted of these ladies having carried the same disposition to Naples as they brought from it Though there are not wanting those who affirm that the influence of this seducing climate is evident  now  in as strong a degree as it is described to have been anciently that it pervades people of all ranks and conditions and that in the convents themselves  Even there where frozen chastity retires  Love finds an altar for forbidden fires  For my own part continues this author I must ac∣knowledge that I saw nothing whilst I was there to justify the general imputation abovementioned There are persons who contend that the Neapolitans are of a colder constitution▪ and more philosophic in the command of their passions than any people in Europe Do not the lower class of men say they strip themselves before the houses which front the bay and bathe in the sea without the least cere∣mony Are not numbers of these athletic figures during the heat of the day seen walking and sporting on the shore perfectly naked and with no more idea of shame than  Adam  felt in his state of innocence whilst the ladies from their coaches and the servant maids and young girls who pass along contemplate  this singular spectacle with as little apparent emo∣tion as the ladies in Hydepark behold a review of the horseguards  Grosley  says princes are as common at Naples as marquisses at Paris The luxury of the nobi∣lity lies chiefly in their equipages Their mules or horses are the finest that can be got the length of the traces is one chief mark of grandeur and dis∣tinction and their lacqueys are very handsome wellmade fellows in rich liveries trailing swords of an enormous length whereas the master's sword which is more like a poniard is carried by the first lackey at a buttonhole  The peasants in this country according to  Keysler  are so flothful as to prefer begging or robbing to la∣bour and industry but in the city of Naples there is something of an industrious spirit and several flourishing manufactures are there carried on It is a phrase here that a king to keep the people quiet must provide three  F  's namely  Feste Farine  and  Forche  that is "Festivity Flour and Gibbets" the people being excessively fond of public diversions clamorous on the dearth of corn and seditious unless kept in awe by severity  The fishermen of St Lucia says  Swinburne  are the handsomest men in Naples They have the true old Grecian features and such wellproportioned limbs as might serve for models in any academy of design Indeed the whole race of men in this city according to  Sharp  are more robust and athletic than the run of mankind in London and carry larger burdens  Wives are in such subordination to their husbands that though the lower class particularly fishermen's wives is always fighting and scolding they never re∣sist their husband's authority but when he comes to separate the combatants and carry home his dishe∣velled spouse she goes off quietly with him and seems to stand as much in awe of her consort as the Russian wives do of theirs and suffers herself to be beaten by him with as little murmuring I was once says  Swinburne  shewn a woman here who during the life of her first husband was a pattern of modesty and evenness of temper to the whole parish but in con∣tracting a second marriage surprized and scandalized the neighbourhood with her perpetual riots and bois∣terous behaviour On being reprimanded by the cu∣rate she ever frankly acknowledged that her former husband understood the management of a wife and used to check her intemperate bursts of passion by timely correction but that her present helpmate was too mild to apply the proper chastisement which  every wife requires more or less Men seldom inter∣fere in feminine brawls when they do they gene∣rally content themselves with abusing threatening or shaking a cudgel or pitchfork at their antagonist till the crowd comes in to part them Sometimes a man is stabbed but this is rare among the fishermen Manners vary with the districts in some they en∣gage with bludgeons These are the true lazaroni of  Massaniello  in others the attack is made with knives and other deadly weapons but the Neapo∣litans are by no means so bloodthirsty and revenge∣ful as represented It requires more than a slight provocation to lead them to extremities Drunken∣ness is not a common vice at Naples of course quar∣rels are rare It is also uncommon to see any thing in public like gallantry among the people no sol∣diers or sailors leading their doxies or girls going about in quest of lovers all which in other coun∣tries give rise to riot and bloodshed Though at Naples there is only a nominal police yet housebreaking is unknown riots still more so it bears no proportion to the murders committed in the distant provinces where I am credibly informed says  Swin∣burne  no less than four thousand persons are killed annually Most of these crimes are perpetrated with guns in the mountainous countries where a great fe∣rocity of character and wildness of manners pre∣vail  Cicisbeos are as general here as in other parts of Italy Many people in England imagine the majo∣rity of Cicisbeos to be an innocent kind of dangling fribble but they are utterly mistaken nor do I find that it is understood here says  Sharp  that the ladies live in greater purity with their Cicisbeos than with their husbands and generally speaking with much less If only onehalf of the ladies practised this custom the other half would despise them but in fact very few have any pretence to upbraid the rest with bad conduct To say the truth if you invite five ladies to dinner you must lay ten plates as each for a cer∣tainty brings her Cicisbeo with her  How is it probable that husbands and wives should have any love for each other when they are always brought together without the least participation of their own nothing being consulted by parents but for∣tune and family  Children here have very little tendency to support the friendship and harmony of the married state A certain knowledge of every wife's attachment to a lover extinguishes all social affection and all fondness for the offspring and it is only the eldest born who the husband is sure belongs to him and for that se∣curity it is generally requisite the birth should take  place the first year as the women seldom hold out longer without a Cicesbeo  The Calabrese have some very capricious notions One is says  Swinburne  that every child whose mother has been true to her marriage vow must necessarily resemble the father It is thought a reproach to have been fuckled by any one but one's own mother  They repose great confidence in judgments and expect to see every one who jeers at the defect of another afflicted with the same Inoculation has been attempted at one place near Reggio but from ill success and superstitious aversion those who have un∣dergone the operation are marked by some oppro∣brious nickname  If a person dies in the fields it is believed his spirit will appear in the same place in white robes and that the only way of laying it is to send out young boys to approach silently and to cover it with a volley of stones Not long since says  Swinburne  a Dominican priest sitting in his white garment on a hill near Tropea taking a sketch of the country was supposed to be the spirit of an old mad woman who had drop∣ped down dead some time before on that very spot and was near being killed by the youths of the neigh∣bouring  village before he could convince them of the little conceits of their error  The funeral behaviour and measure of grief of the Calabrese are regulated by the strictest etiquette The virtues as well as vices of a deceased father of a family are recapitulated by the oldest man in company The widow repeats his words adds com∣ments of her own then roars out loudly and plucks off handfuls of her hair which she strews over the bier Daughters tear their locks and beat their breasts but remain silent More distant relations re∣peat the oration cooly and commit no outrage upon their persons When the kinsman of a baron or a rich citizen dies a number of old women are hired to perform all these ceremonies and howl for the fa∣mily  At Naples the forms are rather different I was one day says  Swinburne  present at the funeral of an old fisherman The actions of his widow were so overstrained as to be truly ridiculous she tore off her hair and clothes and yelled in the most hideous manner till her stepsons appeared to take possession of the goods She then turned her fury upon them and beat them out of the house The priests now came for the body and she opposed their entry for a decent length of time but at last suffering herself  to be overpowered flew to the window with her daughters and her mother who from having outlived many relations had scarcely a hair left on her head and there beat her breast scratched her cheeks and threw whole handfuls of hair towards the bier with the frantick gestures of a demoniack The procession was no sooner out of sight than all was quiet and in five minutes I heard them laughing and dancing about the room as if rejoicing to be rid of the old churl  In some parts of the country it is a rule to fast the whole day of interment Two women in a village near Salerno mother and daughter of a farmer at whose removal from the house they had acted their parts with great applause locked themselves up and in order to gather strength after the fatigue they had undergone began in defiance of custom to fry some pieces of tripe for their dinner As ill luck would have it a couple of relations who living at a great distance had come too late for the ceremony knocked at the door to pay their respects to the disconsolate widow Great was the difficulty they found in gain∣ing admittance all the parade of grief was again dis∣played the dinner slipped into a napkin and hid under the bed and nothing heard in the room but groans and lamentations The strangers entered with composed mien and were endeavouring with little success to administer comfort to their unhappy kins∣women  when behold a dog they had brought with them winded the fry and dragged it out into the middle of the floor to the great anger of the visitors and utter confusion of the mourners whose reputation was irretrievably ruined in the esteem of the whole parish  CHAP V  Of the Environs East of Naples  THE environs of Naples are highly entertaining to the classical scholar the antiquary and the naturalist To the West are Puzzuoli and Baiae to the East Vesuvius the subterranean cities and the museum at Portici  The commencement of the road from Naples to Puzzuoli lies through the  grotta di Pausilippe  which opens into one of the suburbs Formerly it was necessary to cross Mount Pausilippo which from its delightful appearance is said to have derived its Greek name implying  grief appeasing  but at present  that labour is unnecessary a broad subterraneous road being cut through the mountain This passage is conducted chiefly through large rocks and some∣times through  strata  of sand It is at both ends between ninety and an hundred feet high in order to throw in more light Towards the middle where the top is lower two large ventholes for light and air are made through the roof of this grotto but the light is not sufficient and travellers are besides ex∣tremely incommoded with the dust in this subter∣raneous passage The bottom of it which in the time of  Charles  V was paved with broad stones like the streets of Naples is cleaned several times in a year and then it is pretty free from dust but as it is a road extremely frequented this convenience is of no long duration The breadth is between eighteen and twenty feet so that there is sufficient room for two carriages to avoid each other and to prevent any inconvenience on this head it is usual in the dark places to call out to any person coming the contrary Way to know on which side they intend to keep When they answer  alla montagna  "to the mountain" it signifies the Naples side which to those coming from the city is on the righthand and  alla marina  "to the sea" denotes the lefthand side We have often drove through this passage says Lady  Millar  but never without flambeaux  Its length is something more than half an Italian mile On the lefthand near the middle is an ora∣tory hewn out of the rock with a lamp continually burning in it The grotto is by the vulgar supposed to have been made by magic and that  Virgil  was the sorcerer who wrought it The poet it is true gives a description of the Cumaean grotto but this the learned populace apply to the grotto of Pausilippo and conclude since he has so circumstantially de∣scribed an ancient sybil or prophetess that he must have been a wizard If a man says  Addison  would form to himself a just idea of this place he must fancy a vast rock undermined from one end to the other and a highway running through it near as long and as broad as the Mall in St James's park  Opinions vary concerning the first openers of this grotto This kind of rocky substance is perforated with so much ease and the custom of carrying on sub∣terraneous galleries seems to have prevailed at so very early a period of society that some authors have ascribed the work to the giants or the Cimmerians who were wont to make caves their places of resi∣dence as well as the repository of their plunder Others assert it to have been done by  Cocceius  an ar∣chitect of the Augustan age From  Seneca  's expres∣sions complaining of its inconveniences we gather that it was then open only for foot passengers  Possibly the cutting of a road through the moun∣tain was at first not thought of but the great quan∣tity of stones fetched out of it for the buildings in Naples and Puzzuoli might occasion such a deep excavation on both sides that at last for the con∣venience of travelling government employed work∣men to pull down and clear away the intermediate space besides it is not to be supposed the way was at first in such a good condition as it is at present  Seneca  in his fiftyseventh letter says  Nihil illo carcere longius nihil illis faucibus obscurius i e  "This dun∣geon is intolerably long and extremely dark" From whence it may be inferred that the apertures which in  Strabo  's time through which light entered at the sides were soon after stopped up either by earth∣quakes or want of proper care  Neapolitan historians agree that king  Alphonso  of the Arragon family caused this passage to be con∣siderably widened and Don  Pedro de Toledo  vice∣roy under the emperor  Charles  V is known to have given orders for levelling and paving the ground as likewise for enlarging the two ventholes which had been bored through by order of  Alphonso  I That it was entirely wrought by art is unquestionable from the marks it bears of chizels and other tools used by stonecutters The earthquakes that have made such havock among the numerous remains of antiquity in  these parts have hitherto spared this useful work Its safety is probably due to the solidity of the rock in which there does not appear any veins or mixture of sulphur or any kind of inflammable particles Under this mountain is a large quarry from which they dig stone that is frequently used in the buildings at Naples On the side of the mountain next the sea and amongst the rocks grows the plant  Opuntia  or Indian fig on which is found the cochineal Upon the top of this grotto are still some remains of an antique aqueduct which conveyed water from Serino to supply a re∣servoir called  Piscina mirabile  of which we shall speak hereafter  The dust in this grotto says  Swinburne  is intolera∣ble in summer and the scantiness of light at all sea∣sons of the year distressing for that which is ad∣mitted through the apertures abovementioned is no security against the danger of being run over crushed against the wall or at least hurt by the faggots which asses are continually bringing from the woods I never could accustom myself says the above author per∣fectly to this subterraneous road but with hasty steps sought to leave it as the seat of noise gloom dust and unwholesome damps wondering at the same time how passengers ventured into such a place at all hours singly or in company without any guard to prevent assaults or sufficient light to detect a lurking  assassin Were a similar thoroughfare necessary near any other capital it would require all the exertion of the magistracy to preserve the lives and properties of the inhabitants who had occasion to pass through it near London none but a madman would venture into it It is certainly no small matter of surprize to find this passage so secure in a country so ill pro∣vided with officers of police it reflects honour upon the national character and indeed it behoves me to give testimony in its favour as I never says  Swin∣burne  met with any insult nor saw reason to expect one during my long abode among the Neapolitans or my innumerable and pervious rides and walks through different parts of the kingdom  Above the Eastern entrance of this celebrated  grotta  on the brink of a precipice in a vineyard be∣longing to the Marquis  Salcitro  are to be seen the ruins of an ancient mausoleum It was originally built in the form of a pyramid but the lower part of it which is all that is now remaining is not much un∣like a large oven The way to it is not to be found without a guide and on the side towards Pausilippo it is so narrow and runs along such a high precipice that it is somewhat dangerous to persons subject to giddiness This ancient ruin generally passes for the monument of the poet  Virgil  but without sufficient grounds says  Keysler  to warrant such conjecture In  the wall within it are ten small niches or cavities ap∣parently designed for urns According to  Alphonso de Hereda  late bishop of Ariano the marble urn in which  Virgil  's arches had been deposited stood here on nine small marble pillars of which at present there is not the least appearance and what became of such a remarkable piece of antiquity is also a great mystery Some pretend that at the earnest so∣licitations of the inhabitants of Mantua they were presented to that city but others affirm that the Car∣dinal of  Mantua  found means to get them into his possession The third opinion is that the urn was transported to Genoa but that the pillars were ap∣plied to some other use This is certain that at Mantua where they pride themselves not a little on account of their city being the birthplace of that immortal bard they know nothing of the place of his burial  Stessano  in his account of the churches of Naples says that in his time which was no longer ago than both the urn and the pillars were in being with this distich then legible near them  Mantua  me genuit Calabri rapuere tenet nunc  Parthenope  cecini pascua rura duces  "I sung slocks tillage heroes Mantua gave  "Me life Brundusium death Naples a grave"  DRYDEN  This inscription was set up again in by order of the Duke  di Pescolanciano  to whom this garden then belonged The Mausoleum is now overgrown with shrubs and bushes among which are a few laurel trees supposed by the credulous to grow again spon∣taneously though often rooted up At present the only inscription in the whole Mausoleum is the fol∣lowing  Quoe cineris tumulo hoec vestigia Conditur olim  Ille hoc qui cecinit pascua rura duces  "What traces now remain within this tomb  Where once reposed that sacred bard who sung  Of swains of tillage and heroic deeds"  Many a solitary walk says  Moore  have I taken to this place The earth which contains his ashes we expected to find cloathed in the brightest verdure Viewed from this magic spot the objects which adorn the bay become doubly interesting The poets verses are here recollected with additional pleasure the verses of  Virgil  are interwoven in our minds with a thousand interesting ideas with the memory of our boyish years or the sportive scenes of childhood of our earliest friends and companions many of whom are now dead and of those who still live and for whom we retain the first impression of affection and who are at  such distance as renders the hope of ever seeing them again uncertain No wonder therefore that in a con∣templative mood our steps are often directed to a spot so well calculated to create and cherish sentiments con∣genial with the state of our mind But then comes an antiquarian with his odious doubts to disturb the pleasing source of our enjoyment and from the fair and delightful regions of fancy conveys us in a mo∣ment to a dark barren and comfortless desarthe  doubts  whether this be the real place where the ashes of  Virgil  were deposited and tells us an unsatisfac∣tory story about the other side of the bay and that he is rather inclined to believe the poet was buried somewhere there without determining any particular spot Would to Heaven that these doubters would keep their minds to themselves and not ruffle the tranquillity of true believers  But after all why should not this be the real tomb of  Virgil  Why should these enthusiasts who delight in pilgrimage to this spot be deprived of that plea∣sure Why should the poet's ghost be allowed to wander along the dreary banks of the Styx till anti∣quarians erect a cenotaph to his memory Even  they  acknowledge he was buried in this bay and near Naples and tradition has fixed on this spot which exclusive of every other presumption is a much  stronger evidence in its favour than their vague con∣jectures against it  Of the ancient monuments at Naples the most en∣tire and unquestionably the most curious is  Virgil  's tomb says  Grosley  This monument which by  Misson  and  Montfaucon  is represented as a pyramid almost ruined is a lanthorn or turret about twenty feet high on open arcades the solid parts of which were formerly adorned with pillars This structure stands on a platform cut in the Eastern side of the hill of Pausilippo in sight of the two bays of Naples the harbour the castles part of the city lengthways and fronting Mount Vesuvius Unquestionably it was in order to make it so conspicuous that its elevation so much exceeds the proportion of its base It com∣mands the entrance of the favourite grotto and by the excavations daily carrying on in this part of the mountain commands it so that at present it is scarce two feet from the brink of a precipice a hundred and eighty feet deep and if these excavations be con∣tinued they must certainly undermine this valuable monument  On the external surface of the cupola in which it terminates is a prodigy much celebrated by the Ita∣lian poets I mean its being exactly crowned with a laurel though the only nourishment the tree receives  is what its roots meet with in the joining of the stones All travellers are sure to have a pluck at this tree which they do by means of a rope with a stone at the end of it You may be sure says Lady  Millar  in her description of this celebrated tomb "I am pos∣sessed of some of the leaves of this sacred tree how happy should I be if drinking a decoction of them would inspire me with Virgilian poesy The side of the mountain where the tomb stands instead of any trees of this kind is covered with yews and firs  Vir∣gil  's laurel however recruits its daily losses and perpe∣tuates itself with renovating vigour In the sixteenth century there was only one stem which stood in the centre of the cupola where we will suppose it to have been planted by some Neapolitan a warm admirer of  Virgil  About the beginning of the last century a fir blown by the wind from a collateral foot of the mountain fell with its top on the stem thus choaking it but nature herself repaired the accident setting as layers the compressed ramifications of the root which now have spread over the cupola's whole sur∣face  Beautiful points of view offer themselves every step in ascending this mountain the summit of which is covered with villas and gardens planted with ever∣greens belonging to several noble families at Naples Further on towards the North is the convent of the  Camaldoli  from which there is a most sublime seaview and a most beautiful landone Hence you may go through forests of chesnuts opening some∣times to noble views till you reach the glacis of the castle of St Elmo where the whole city and suburbs appear in one collective picture The Carthusian convent adjoining to the castle is perhaps the best situated monastery in Europe  On this mountain in the Villa Mazza are the re∣mains of  Pollio  's fishponds so often mentioned in the works of ancient writers the expence he was at in embellishing them the extravagant passion he had for his fish which by care and feeding grew to a remark∣able size the cruel food with which he supplied them and the rebuke he met with from  Augustus  in whose presence he bad ordered a slave to be thrown into the pond for a trivial offence are circumstances that have rendered these reservoirs famous  Puzzuoli is situated about seven miles from Naples It had its ancient name  Puteoli  either from a sulphu∣reous stench or from the great number of  putéi  or holes which are made here on account of the sul∣phur works and by digging for sand which in an∣cient times was found very serviceable for building especially under water  Quis enim satis miretur  says  Pliny pessimam ejus terroe partem ideoque pulverem ap∣pellatam  in Puteolaris collibus opponi maris fluctibus mersumque protinus fieri lapidem inexpugnabilem undis fortiorem quotidie utique si Cumano misceretur coe∣mento i e  "Who can sufficiently admire that the worst part of the soil in the mountains of Puteoli which is called dust or sand should be made into a bulwark against the sea and when sunk under water should soon become a stone impregnable by the waves and every day grow stronger especially if it is mixed with Cumaean cement" It is asserted by some authors that this city was founded five hundred and twentytwo years before the Christian Aera by one  Decius  son of  Neptune  and according to others by some one else It is most agreeably situated on the margin of a small bay and the great quantity of beautiful stones and gems cast up by the sea is a suf∣ficient proof of its former splendor and magnificence The greatest part of these stones are of a blue or a red cast with several pieces of  Verde antico  por∣phyry c and seem to have been used in Mosaic work there are frequently found agate cornelian amethyst jasper onyx beryl  lapis lazuli  c and many of them cameos and intaglios  On every hill and vale of the environs appear the ruins of extensive villas once embellished with all the elegancies of combined arts now traced only by half buried mouldering walls and some marble frag∣ments  left as it were to vouch for the taste and cost∣liness with which they were constructed In the last period of the commonwealth and during the gaudy aera of the  Coesars  almost every person of exalted rank had a house in this country which the sagacious anti∣quaries of Puzzuoli point out to you without doubt or hesitation  The town of Puzzuoli and its environs says  Moore  presents such a number of objects worthy of the attention of the antiquarian the natural philo∣sopher and the classic scholar that to describe all with the minuteness they deserve would fill volumes The cathedral now under the protection of St  Ja∣nuarius  and St  Proculus  was formerly a temple de∣dicated to  Augustus  It is built of large stones without cement No more of the ancient temple remains than some Co∣rinthian columns with their capitals and part of the entablature of Parian marble and beautiful work∣manship in one of the sidewalls of the cathedral  The temple of  Jupiter Serapis  in this city is ac∣counted a very interesting monument of antiquity being quite different from the Roman and Greek temples and built in the manner of the Asiatics pro∣bably by the Egyptian and Asiatic merchants who  settled here this place having been the great empo∣rium of Italy until the Romans built Ostia and An∣tium The ruins of this temple are in the finest pre∣servation of any round Naples It was originally encompassed by fortytwo square rooms which are now almost reduced to ruins yet still some columns of beautiful white marble are to be seen fluted and highly finished The whole was paved with large slabs of marble and the edifice completely encrusted with the same It is curious to see the massy rings fixed in the pavement to which the victims were fastened and the copper pipes or drains to convey away their blood here is a pierced square of marble of exquisite workmanship which served as a drain stone for it is placed in the center of a quadran∣gular part of the temple precisely under the open part of the roof in order to receive and carry off the rain water which entered at the opening Half of its buildings are still buried under the earth thrown upon it by volcanic commotions or accumulated by the crumblings of the hill  The enclosure is square says  Swinburne  environed with buildings for priests and baths for votaries in the center remains a circular platform with four flights of steps up to it vases for fire a centrical altar rings for victims and other appendages of sacrifice entire and not displaced sixteen columns of African  marble that sustained the roof and the statues have been removed to the new palace at Caserta the pe∣destals of the statues only remaining  In that part of the town called  la Piazza  is placed a square pedestal of white marble found in the year Each side has a basrelief Although they are much injured we may distinguish fourteen figures by which are represented so many cities of AsiaMinor The pedestal is inscribed to  Tiberius  and probably a statue of him had been placed upon it erected according to the opinion of some learned men by these fourteen cities that were near being en∣tirely demolished by an earthquake in his reign to whom he had sent very liberal supplies It is esteemed a most beautiful basrelief and a work of excellent taste  The ruins of its ancient edifices are widely spread along the adjacent hills and shores An amphi∣theatre still exists entire in most of its parts It is said to have stood formerly within the walls of the city but is now near a mile distant from it This is a proof of the great decay of the town from its former extent and splendor The arena which is now a garden is two hundred and fifty feet long the por∣ticos of entrance which were below the steps or seats for the spectators and the dens for wild beasts with a  stone trough in each to hold water for them are still to be seen Here it is said St  Januarius  and his companions were thrown to be devoured by wild beasts but the latter were it seems not wanting in respect due to such holy personages and never offered to lay a paw on them At the entrance of St  Janu∣arius  's prison now converted into a chapel is an in∣scription signifying that it was consecrated by the bishop of  Puzzuoli  in and promising an indul∣gence of forty days to those who devoutly visit that sacred spot in this amphitheatre  Suetonius  says  Au∣gustus  assisted in person at the games celebrated here  There is a curious antiquity here called the laby∣rinth of  Dedalus  it is near the amphitheatre but by the learned supposed to have been a reservoir to serve the city of Puzzuoli with water To every one of these apartments there are four doors which makes the place extremely intricate A little further is an arched vault supported by eleven pillars incrusted with tartar and at present it is a winecellar This likewise seems to have been a reservoir Half a league from Puzzuoli are the  columbarias  or tombs the descent into which is by ladders There is nothing very curious in these repositories of the dead they are of a simple structure with small niches in which urns filled with the ashes of the family were deposited  This town is chiefly inhabited by fishermen their children run after strangers with plates full of mosaic pieces of various colours amongst which may fre∣quently be found medals intaglios and engravings on gems these the sea throw upon the beach and are purchased for a trifle Some of them are genuine but many are false and these mock antiquities are frequently imposed on ignorant strangers which are no more than the refuse of lapidaries shops procured from Naples but whoever has a little intelligence in these matters cannot easily be deceived  The ruins of  Cicero  's villa near this city are of such extent as to give a high idea of the wealth of this great orator Had fortune says  Moore  always bestowed her gifts with so much propriety she never would have been accused of blindness Neither this villa nor that at Tusculum nor any of his countryseats were the scenes of idleness or riot They are distinguished by the names of the works he composed in them works which have always been the delight of the learned and which still more than the impor∣tant services he rendered his country have contri∣buted to immortalize his name  Here it was he wrote both the books intitled  Quoes∣tionum Academicarum  The ruins of this famous aca∣demia of  Cicero  says Lady  Millar  are a mile and a  quarter round but this immense building is now so demolished there is no possibility of ascertaining its regular plan though we took the trouble of walking or rather stumbling over the rubbish through a num∣ber of rooms we could not find one that could be termed a large one in a modern English house Some of the pavement still remains composed of small dies of white marble forming a mosaic pattern most of the rooms were vaulted and many of the arches still remain entire  It is evident that the sea has covered the greatest part of this building as considerable vestiges which plainly appear to have been part of the structure are dis∣cernable at low water this is highly probable for an additional reason the academia was so close to the sea as to admit  Cicero  's guests to have amused them∣selves by fishing from his windows  The mole of the harbour of Puzzuoli is a stupen∣dous work There are now fourteen piles remaining built with a sort of stone called Piperno and faced with brick these piles are connected by halfruined arches The common people usually call it  Il ponte di Caligula  as if it were the ruins of the bridge built by that emperor from Puzzuoli to Baiae This error  Suetonius  's life of that emperor very satisfactorily Confutes where he says that what  Caligula  built  was no more than a bridge of boats covered with earth and reaching from Baiae to the Puzzuoli mole so that the piers are not only plainly distinguished from the moveable bridge of  Caligula  but he has likewise called it by the name of moles which is even now applied to any  congeries  of rocks or stone that serves for the security of an harbour That the pilas∣ters in the sea before Puzzuoli did not belong to a bridge is likewise further apparent from their not being placed in a strait line but forming a curve towards the North  The sea about Puzzuoli abounds in fish especially of the testaceous kind Here is also a fish called  Cavallo Marino  which is not quite an inch in length and is generally dried for keeping The head of this little fish very much resembles that of a horse it is often bruised with vinegar and honey and ap∣plied by way of plaister to the part bitten by a mad dog This species of fish is also found on the other side of Italy along the coasts of the Adriatic  The purple dye of this place was in such esteem among the ancient Romans as to be said to have ri∣valled that of Tyre it is the blood taken from the vein in the shellfish probably the perriwinkle and of which there is so small a quantity as not to exceed one drop in each fish  Sylla  having abdicated the dictatorship is said to have retired and passed the remainder of his days in this city  CHAP VI  The same Subject continued  PURSUING the path towards Naples says  Swin∣burne  in his description of the environs I ar∣rived at a convent of Capuchin Friars which com∣mands so fine a prospect that many painters have chosen it as a station for delineating the bay Saint  Januarius  is supposed to have completed his martyr∣dom on this spot by the axe after facing the wild beasts with impunity He was bishop of Beneven∣tum in the third century but did not supersede Saint  Asprenius  in the patronage of Naples till eleven hundred years after his death  The cistern that contains water for the use of this convent is a bason supported solely by one column it was thus contrived clear of all contact with the walls of the cellar from a discovery being made that poisonous vapours transpired through the ground and contaminated the water in the common reservoirs  The bay between Puzzuoli and Baiae is about three miles in breadth In the circuit of this bay lies Monte Barbara anciently Mons Gaurus the fa∣vourite of  Bacchus  undoubtedly of volcanic origin though beyond the records of history It was this mountain which is now one of the most barren spots round Naples that was formerly so celebrated for its Falernian wine The common people have a notion that immense treasures lie buried in it guarded by evil spirits  Directly opposite to  Il Monte Barbaro  towards the West lies  Il Monte Nuovo  or the new mountain which rose instantaneously in the night of the nineteenth of September during an earthquake which caused a terrible devastation in the neighbourhood "It may seem still more wonderful" says  Gassendi  in his physics "that not only mountains shoot up in the continent but even islands in the middle of the sea As to mountains nothing can be more notorious than that of Puzzuoli which was in one night formed by  a congeries of pumice stones and ashes to the height of above a thousand paces"  Though this alteration happened at the time of an earthquake it was not caused by it earthquakes in∣deed often overturn mountains but never produce any to do this the irruption of a volcano is re∣quired  Swinburne  in his description of this pheno∣menon says in after previous notice by re∣peated quakings the convulsed earth burst asunder and made way for a deluge of hot ashes and flames which being shot up to an immense height into the darkened atm  sphere fell down again all round and formed circular mound four miles in circum∣ference and one thousand feet high with a large cup in the middle Immediately after the explosion the wind rose furiously and wasted the lighter particles over the country burning and blasting all vegetation in its progress wherever these ashes impregnated with poison adhered to the grass death became the lot of all beasts that broused upon it The terrors occasioned by this shock threatened the abandonment of the whole district scarcely a family durst remain even within sight of this horrid heap which had over∣whelmed a large town filled up a lake and buried under it a very extensive tract of cultivated lands  Part of this mountain is cultivated but the larger portion of its declivity is widely overgrown with prickly broom and rank weeds that emit a very foetid sulphureous smell The crater is shallow its inside clad with shrubs and the little area at the bot∣tom planted with fig and mulberrytrees a most striking specimen of the amazing vicissitudes that take place in this extraordinary country Near the foot of this mountain the subterraneous fires act with such immediate power that even the sand at the bottom of the sea is heated to an intolerable degree  A long neck of land prevents the waves from washing into a sedgy pool the poor remnants of the Lucrine lake once so renowned for the abundance and flavour of its shellfish of which large beds lined the shallows while a deep channel in the middle afforded riding and anchoring for vessels and a pas∣sage into the inner bason of Lake Avernus A small canal now serves to discharge the superabundant waters I suppose says  Swinburne  that originally the Lucrine lake was only a marsh overflowed by the sea till  Hercules  gave it extent and depth by raising a mound across and damming out the saltwater and afterwards that  Augustus  formed the Julian port by raising this wear to a sufficient level and thereby procuring depth of water for a navy to float in  Virgil  in his praises of  Augustus  says  An memorem portus Lucrinoque addita claustra  Atque indignantem magnis stridoribus aequor  Julia qua ponto longe sonat unda refuso  Tyrrhenisque fretis immittitur cestus Avernis  Virg Geo lib ii v  "Or shall I praise thy ports or mention make  Of the vast mound that binds the  Lucrine  lake  Or the disdainful sea that shut from thence  Roars round the structure and invades the fence  There where secure the Julian waters glide  Or where Avernus' jaws admit the Tyrrhene tide"  DRYDEN  Sergius Orata  says  Pliny primus optimum saporem ostreis Lucrinis adjudicavit "Sergius Orata  was the first who distinguished the delicate flavour of the oysters of the Lucrine lake"  Non me Lucrina juve∣rint conchylia  "Not Lucrine oysters would my pa∣late please" says  Horace  in one of his odes  It was in this lake according to the testimony of  Solinus  and other ancient writers that there was in  Augustus  's time a dolphin made so tame by a boy that he would sit upon him and cross the lake on his back from Baiae to Puzzuoli  Lake Avernus lies about half a mile distant on the lefthand in the road to Cuma This lake like the mountain Gaurus is exceedingly altered but much for the better According to ancient historians no fish could live in it and its noxious vapours ascended to such a height that birds flying over it dropt down dead  Lucretius  in his sixth book speaks thus of it  "Next of Averno sung and whence the name  And whence the rage and hurtful nature came  So called because the birds that cut the sky  If o'er those plains they but chance to fly  By noxious streams oppress'd fall down and die"  CREECH's Translation  The noxious quality attributed to this lake and the sulphureous exhalations so fatal to birds who should attempt to fly over it are likewise particularly mentioned in the sixth book of  Virgil  This lake is at present stocked with variety of good fish and the birds not only fly over it unhurt but wild ducks and other aquatic fowls are to be seen upon it and the adjacent vineyards produce a very good sort of wine  Servius ad Aenead iii v  ascribes the noxious air about this lake in ancient times to the thick and lofty woods that then surrounded it which hindered the dispersion of the effluvia adding that  Augustus  having ordered the wood to be cut down and extir∣pated  the country soon put on a chearful appear∣ance  Swinburne  in his description of this lake tells us that the landscape though confined is extremely pleasing the dark blue surface of these unruffled waters said to be three hundred and sixty feet deep strongly re∣flects the tapering groves that cover its sloping in∣closure of about only half a mile in diameter shoals of wild fowl swim about and kingfishers shoot along under the banks a large octagon temple in ruins ad∣vances majestically to the brink its marble orna∣ments have long been removed but its form and size render it a noble object It was probably dedicated to the infernal gods to whose worship these solemn shades were formerly consecrated Black aged groves then stretched their boughs over the watery abyss and with impenetrable foliage excluded almost every ray of wholesome light mephitic vapours ascending from the hot bowels of the earth being denied free passage to the upper atmosphere floated along the surface in poisoned mists These circumstances pro∣duced horrors fit for such gloomy deities a colony of Cimmerians as well suited to the rites as to the place itself cut dwellings in the bosoms of the sur∣rounding hills and officiated as priests of Tartarus Superstition always delighting in dark ideas eagerly seized on this spot and hither she led her trembling  votaries to celebrate her dismal orgies here she evoked the manes of departed heroeshere she of∣fered sacrifices to the gods of hell and attempted to dive into the secrets of futurity Poets enlarged upon the popular theme and painted its awful scenery with the strongest colours of their art  Homer  brings  Ulysses  to Avernus as to the mouth of the infernal abodes and in imitation of the Grecian bard  Virgil  con∣ducts his hero to the same ground The holiness of these shades remained unimpeached for many ages  Hannibal  marched his army to offer incense at this altar  After a long reign of undisturbed gloom and cele∣brity a sudden glare of light was let in upon Aver∣nus the horrors were dispelled and with them vanished the sanctity of the lake the axe of  Agrippa  brought its forest to the ground disturbed its sleepy waters with ships and gave room for all its malignant effluvia to escape Modern writers says  Swinburne  charge ancient authors with exaggeration in describ∣ing the virulence of its exhalations but I think them entitled to more respect for even now the air is feverish and dangerous as the jaundiced faces of the vinedressers who have succeeded the Sybils and the Cimmerians in possession of the temple most ruefully testify  Boccacio  relates that during his residence at the Neapolitan court the surface of this lake was suddenly covered with dead fish black and singed as if killed by some subaqueous eruption of fire At present it abounds with tench the Locrine with eels The change of fortune in these lakes is singular in the splendid days of Imperial Rome the Lucrine was the chosen spot for the parties of pleasure of a vo∣luptuous court they are described by  Seneca  as the highest refinement of extravagance and luxury now a slimy bed of rushes covers the scatered ponds of this once beautiful sheet of water and the dusky Aver∣nus is now clear and serene offering a most alluring surface and charming scenes for similar amusements  Opposite the temple says  Swinburne  I entered a cave usually stiled the Sybils Grotto it seems more likely to have been the mouth of a communication between Cuma and Avernus than the abode of a prophetess especially as the sybil is positively said by historians to have dwelt in a cavern under the Cu∣maean citadel A most acute and indefatigable un∣raveller of antiquarian clews thinks it was part of the canal that  Nero  projected from the mouth of the Tiber to the Julian port  The entrance to the cave of the sybil as it is com∣monly called is about three yards wide near five feet  high and two hundred and twenty or two hundred and thirty yards to the end here is a narrow way descending to two small cells where there are baths From the largest of these they say there is a corri∣dore or passage ending in an outlet now made up with bricks and that there is a third cell with a wind∣ing staircase leading from it to the top of the moun∣tain but now stopped up by dirt  Northall  notices only one room After advancing about two hundred paces there is a passage which leads to some baths where the second grotto is It is a little room about fourteen feet long and eight broad and of a height proportionable On the walls are some small remains of gilding and mosaic work but it seems very mysterious how the sybil could live in so confined a place  Keysler  likewise who seems to have visited this sup∣posed residence of the sybil notices only one apart∣ment at the extremity of the passage in which says he there is a kind of stone trough by some antiquarians imagined to be the sybil's bath and by others her bed on the walls are several figures made of small stones and shells of different colours curiously ar∣ranged The pavement is also a mosaic work but cannot be seen distinctly as it is covered with water Here says  Keysler  the  Lago Averno  is twentyfive  fathoms deep and almost entirely surrounded with a rising ground so that a canal of communication with the sea which need not be above the length of half an Italian mile would make it one of the most commodious harbours in the universe  On the side of the Lucrine lake towards the sea is a hill with a deep rent on its summit which the poor illiterate people are taught to believe was made at our Saviour's crucifixion and that it was the pas∣sage through which he descended into the  Limbus patrum  in order to release the Patriarchs and to this superstitious notion the mountain owes the name of  Il monte di Christo  Between Averno and the city of Cuma is to be seen part of the  Via Appia  where two hills are joined by means of a noble arch called  Arco Felice  built with large bricks its height is seventy and its breadth fiftyfive feet the passage under it is twenty feet four inches It is supposed says  Martyn  but without any probability to have been a gate of the city of Cuma  From this high ground there is a view of the dreary flat shore of Patria where on the edge of a large pond are some heaps of stones the ruins of Liter∣num Hither  P Cornelius Scipio Africanus  with∣drew  from the accusations of his enemies and spent his latter days in philosophical retirement by this voluntary exile he preserved his person from in∣dignity without being indebted for his safety to a dispensation of any positive though unjust law of his country  Seneca  mentions having slept in the villa which two hundred years before had been the asylum of that hero he describes it as a substantial building in a garden surrounded with high walls and flanked with towers to defend it against a sudden attack in it was a cistern capable of containing water enough for an army to drink and for the private use of the master a small gloomy bath after the simple fashion of those times This shore was probably less un∣wholesome when  Scipio  lived here than it is in its present uncultivated state overflowed with foetid pools of brackish water  If tradition can be relied on  Scipio  's ashes were deposited here and the word  Patria  still remaining fixed in the wall of a watchtower and giving name to the adjacent lake is a fragment of his angry epi∣taph  ingrata neque enim mea ossa habebis  "Ungrate∣ful country you shall not even have my bones" It is at least certain that no urn or monumental inscrip∣tion belonging to this illustrious member of the fa∣mily has been found in the sepulchre of the  Scipios  lately discovered at Rome  From hence says  Swinburne  we rowed about six miles Eastward to the insulated rock on which stood the citadel of Cuma the first city founded in Italy by Grecian emigrants once the seat of commerce the parent of Naples and the capital of a state that ruled the seas before either Rome or Carthage were heard of its prosperity was of long continuance while yet the power of infant Rome remained crampt within the narrow limits of her own plains Under the sway of  Aristodemus  Cuma afforded an asylum to  Tarquin  the proud the deposed king of Rome  As Rome advanced in her fortunate career the glory of all her neighbouring powers faded away before her the Cumaeans in their turn submitted to the yoke and were treated with lenity but real liberty was gone and the trade abandoned her shores The Goths reduced it still lower and at last being merely a receptacle for thieves it was in totally ruined and forsaken  This rocky hill is the produce of an eruption and hollowed into many spacious caverns amongst which we look in vain for the grotto where the Cumaean sybil pronounced her oracles that sanctuary was de∣stroyed in the Gothic war  Agathias  informs us that it was scooped into the form of a temple the roof of which served as a foundation for one of the prin∣cipal  towers of the fortress The hermitage of Wark∣worth in Northumberland says  Swinburne  celebrated by the pen of Dr  Percy  may serve to give an idea of this sybilline grotto When  Narses  invested the ci∣tadel he caused this rocky cover to be cut through in several directions and then propped up with beams as soon as every thing was in readiness for the assault the wood was set on fire Upon the props being con∣sumed the rocks gave way and brought the walls down headlong with them into the temple and on these accumulated ruins the Imperial troops entered the breach  Between Cuma and Misenum lies the lake  Acheron  or  Palus Acherusia  so well known among the an∣cients and from its black water is by  Virgil  termed  tenebrosa palus  "the gloomy lake" For the increase of its fishery a canal has been made from the main sea into this lake by which means the waters of it have been much mended and rendered fitter for fish to live in Most of the fishermen live upon a little island in the middle of the lake but the fish they catch are chiefly eels and barbles At present it is called  Lago di Fusaro  Here says  Swinburne  my conductors shewed me the ruins of the tomb of  Caius Marius  As I am apt to believe that popular tales have always some foundation however feeble to rest upon I think it probable that the ashes of a Roman  of that name were deposited here but it cannot be those of the famous Consul because  Sylla  caused his remains to be taken out of the tomb and scattered to the wind  In these parts as our antiquarians tell us  Servilius Vatia  had a seat to which he retired under the tyran∣nical reign of  Tiberius Vatia  on account of the re∣treat he had chosen was cried up as the happiest of the Romans so that it was a common saying O  Vatia solus scis vivere  "O  Vatia  you alone know how to live" But  Seneca  seems to have been of a different opinion for in his fiftyfifth epistle he says  ille latere sciebat non vivereNunquam aliter hanc villam Vatiâ vivo proeteribam quam ut dicerem Vatia hic situs est  "He knew how to secrete himself not how to enjoy lifeNor did I ever pass his house without saying  Vatia  lies there"  Just below the above lake is the  Mare morto  The ancients pretend that dead bodies were carried over this lake from Misenum to the Elysian fields It is a double pool says  Swinburne  of which the outer di∣vision is open to the sea the inner one occasionally shut up for the purpose of fishing A slip of sand divides it from the channel of Procida and at the ex∣tremity rises the solitary shelving promontory of Mi∣seno the ruins of a city of that name are scattered  at its foot and the remains of a theatre very appa∣rent A fine fragment of marble cornice is still left to bear testimony of the elegance with which it was decorated in the richest luxuriance of the composite order  Miseno is said to derive its name from a companion of  Aeneas  who was buried here according to  Virgil  At pius Aeneas ingenti mole sepulchrum  Imponit suaque arma viro remumque tutamque  Monte sub aeria qui nunc Misenus ab illo  Dicitur oeternumque tenet per soecula nomen  "But good Aeneas ordered on the shore  A stately tomb whose top a trumpet bore  A soldiers faulchion and a seaman's oar  Thus was his friend interred and deathless fame  Still to the lofty cape consigns his name"  DRYDEN  On this peninsula a villa was built by  Caius Marius  with a degree of elegance that gave great offence to the most austere among the Romans who thought it ill suited to the character of so rough a soldier Upon the same foundation  Lucullus  the plunderer of the Eastern world erected an edifice in comparison of which the former house was a cottage but even his  magnificence was eclipsed by the splendor of the pa∣lace which the emperors raised on the same spot To these proud abodes of heroes and monarchs which have long been levelled to the ground a few fishing huts and a lonely publichouse have succeeded hither boatmen resort to tipple perhaps on the iden∣tical site where the voluptuous masters of the world quaffed Chian and Valernian wine  Near this spot is the  Piscina Mirabilis  it is a sub∣terraneous cistern divided into alleys by rows of square pillars from which springs an arched roof the incrustation formed anciently upon the plaistered walls by the sediment of the water is now so strong an alabaster as almost to defy the pickaxe and so thick and compact as to be susceptible of a very fine polish  It is much disputed by whom this reservoir was built Some attribute it to  Lucullus  others are of opinion that  Agrippa  had it made for the conve∣nience of the fleet or for watering the gardens and the chambers near it says  Keysler  called  cento came∣relle  seem to have been designed for the same pur∣pose  The channel where the fleet of  Agrippa  moored has now but one craggy cobble stationed to ferry  over passengers I crossed it says  Swinburne  to the Elysian fields which are bounded on the North side by a small eminence covered with vinebearing trees the face of the bank is hollowed into number∣less caves and places of sepulture and an ancient way leads from the ferry towards Capua between rows of monumental buildings which by an unusual permutation of property from being filled with the ashes of the dead are now occupied by living pea∣sants The cause of this road and its environs being so uncommonly crouded with tombs exists in the su∣perstitious creed of the Pagans who held inhumation necessary to salvation and a grave the only door through which a soul could pass to a future state of bliss According to the spirit of this tenet neither the inhabitant who died peaceably in his bed at Misenum nor the mariner who met his fate in battle or in ship∣wreck was suffered by his friends to remain without the honours of a tomb to every person even of mo∣derate rank a suitable mausoleum was erected to pro∣cure for his departed soul free ingress into the Ely∣sian shades These circumstances coincide admira∣bly with the fables and traditions handed down con∣cerning this country from a very early period  Homer  brings  Ulysses  hither and here he fixes the scene of his Stygian machinery thus the  Mare morto  passed for Acheron and the adjoining fields for the vale of Elysium to which the dead were wafted in the boat of  Charon  This was literally true with regard to such persons as died at Misenum  Off this promontory lie the islands Ischia and Pro∣cida well worthy the trouble of a visit says  Martyn  from any curious traveller the former of these for richness of soil abundance of products and beauty of situation may vie with the most celebrated spots on the globe these advantages have drawn many settlers to its shores and added eight thousand inhabitants to its lists in the last thirty years  The ancients believed Ischia to have been raised out of the bosom of the deep by the force of central fires the Chalcydians were the first adventurers that dared to set foot on this igneous soil and were amply repaid for their riches by the immense wealth they drew from the settlement however continual earth∣quakes and eruptions forced them to abandon the place  Hiero  king of Syracuse who was indefatiga∣ble in advancing the commercial interests of his do∣minions sent a colony to this island but the emolu∣ments falling short of his expectations he soon with∣drew his people since that epoch Ischia has usually obeyed the masters of the adjacent continent All Ischia is of fiery origin but its Northwest angle is more disturbed and more overturned by eruptions than any other part of it On this side of the island  are some vapourbaths erected on a neck of land strongly impregnated with sulphur and other mine∣rals the usual concomitants of volcanos  At the distance of a mile south of these sudatories is the town of Foria inhabited by an industrious peo∣ple they employ a considerable number of small vessels in the carriage of their fruit and wines but the want of a harbour exposes them to great losses in stormy weather The houses of this burgh are solidly built but the streets are almost too narrow for an ass with a pair of panniers The environs are ex∣tremely fertile the young women says  Swinburne  I met coming down the mountain with baskets of figs upon their heads were tall and handsome their fea∣tures regularly fine their eyes sparkling their shape and gait light and airy beyond expression  On the declivity of the central mountain of the island is a crater circular shallow and embanked with a vast mound of cinders it is full of lava twisted and curled as if while in a fluid state it had been stirred round with a stick No vegetation has as yet taken place on these substances though they have been exposed to the air since the year The eruption lasted near two months and caused such de∣vastation in the human and animal species by the ma∣lignity of its vapours and poisonous qualities of its  ashes that whoever could escape fled from this land of horror I arrived at the summit of this mountain adds  Swinburne  just as the sun had extricated his orb out of a mass of heavy vapours that still hung upon the Appennine as his rays diverged the fogs that floated on the sea vanished and a view rose gradually to the sight of which so weak a pencil as mine can never give an adequate idea As the magnificent view from Mount Epomeo seems the most interesting object of curiosity in the island we shall proceed with our author's description of it The distant part of the picture says  Swinburne  displayed the most ad∣mirable marine and terrestrial scenery while the fore∣ground exhibited the richness of a fertile populous island This vast expanse of sea and land lay un∣folded before me like a chart on which every object was marked with precision  The pinnacle of Epomeo is a white rock of tufa in the heart of which is hewn a church cells galleries and other conveniences for seven hermits under the patronage of St  Nicholas  These recluses subsist upon alms collected thrice a week about the island while the season permits but during some months of the year the snow lies so deep in this peak as to shut them out from all communication with mankind They have some plots of garden but seem to exert themselves little in the culture or the improvement  of them the cells are dirty and their inhabitants ap∣pear to have no turn for study or mechanics their prior is a Frenchman who twenty years ago was go∣vernor of Ischia till moved with compunction for the sins of his military life and despairing of purity of conscience in the soul atmosphere below he became an anchoret in this exalted region he has been twelve years confined to his trucklebed by the gout but re∣tains a fresh florid complexion and tolerable spirits The passage to the cells is contrived to wind through the rock so as to admit views of almost every part of the island towards the South the declivity is very gradual to the sea and cloathed in the richest garb of vegetative nature the North side of the mountain is more abrupt and destitute of verdure at the foot of its tremendous point lies a circular bason from whence in former times issued flames and fiery torrents that overwhelmed the country but its operations have ceased during such an immense series of years that the borders are tumbled in and almost every distinc∣tive feature of a crater obliterated  Procida anciently  Prochyta  which lies between the cape of Misenum and Ischia about two miles distant from each is a small island about six miles in circum∣ference The earliest writers of history speak of Pro∣cida as land torn from the continent by the violence of earthquakes and fiery commotions The upper  part of the cliffs of this island in which many spacious caverns have been worn by the waves or left empty in the convulsive boilings that raised the island above the waters is a tufa stone of various hues brown white yellow and purple The King's palace which he sometimes visits for the sake of shooting stands on the point of this excavated promontory  This island gave birth to or was at least the pro∣perty of  John  of  Procida  a man of great fame in the annals of the thirteenth century Though rich and nobly born this extraordinary person did not disdain the practice of physic but improved a strong natural genius by every help the scanty knowledge of the age afforded The great features of his character were sagacity activity daringness and perseverance with these qualities he undertook to avenge his countrymen of the Provencals who under  Charles  of  Anjou  had reduced both Sicilies to slavery and destroyed the house of Suabia This plan for destroying the French being settled he insinuated himself into the private meetings of the Sicilians and by incendiary dis∣courses fed the fire of discontent till he saw the pro∣per moment for blowing it up into a flame at his nod though perhaps the crisis was hastened by some accidental outrages all Sicily rose in arms at the fatal sound of the evening bell known by the name of the  Sicilian vespers and almost every Frenchman perished  The fishing of this little island brings in a hand∣some profit owing to the extraordinary expertness of the Neapolitan divers I have frequently known their stay under water says  Swinburne  to exceed two minutes and have been assured that some can and do remain longer Their common method of taking oysters seaurchins and other shellfish is to plunge in head foremost amongst the rocks and with a strong knife wrench the shells off the stones to which they adhere then rising to the surface throw their booty into a floating basket tied to their foot but the vio∣lence of the exertion and the pressure of the water weaken their lungs and shorten their lives few reach the age of thirty years When they go in search of the razorfish called in Neapolitan  cannolicchi  they walk up to their shins in the sea backwards and for∣wards with the greatest gravity and attention moving their feet sideways along the sand till they feel the sharp edge of a razorshell then they dart down with amazing rapidity and seize their prey From this stately deportment comes the local proverbial ex∣pression of a person walking about in a brown study he is fishing for  cannolicchi  In the center of the gulph of which this fragment of Cape Misenum makes the extreme Western point are the mutilated remnants of Baiae that elegant re∣sort of the gay masters of the world The hot springs and medicinal vapours that abound in its environs must very early have excited the attention of valetu∣dinarians as bathing was the constant solace of the Greeks while in health and their remedy when dis∣eased but Baiae does not seem to have attained a degree of celebrity superior to that of other baths till the Roman commonwealth began to be in the wane As soon as the plunder of a conquered world was transferred from works of public use and orna∣ment to objects of private luxury the transcendent advantages which Baiae offered to Roman volup∣tuaries flying from the capital in search of health and pleasure were attended to with enthusiasm the va∣riety of its natural baths the softness of its climate and the beauties of its landscape captivated the minds of opulent nobles whose passion for bathing knew no bounds abundance of linen and disuse of ointments render the practice less necessary in modern life but the ancients performed no exercise engaged in no study without previous ablutions which at Rome re∣quired an enormous expence in aqueducts stones and and attendants a place therefore where waters na∣turally heated to every degree of warmth bubbled spontaneously out of the ground in the pleasantest of  all situations was such a treasure as could not be overlooked Hither at first retired for a temporary relaxation the mighty rulers of the empire to string anew their nerves and revive their spirits fatigued with bloody campaigns and civil contests Their ha∣bitations were small and modest but soon increasing luxury added palace to palace so that ground was wanting for the vast demand Enterprising architects supported by infinite wealth carried their foundations into the sea and drove that element back from its limits it has since taken ample revenge and reco∣vered much more than it ever lost  From being a place of resort for a season Baiae now grew up to a permanent city whoever found himself disqualified by age or infirmity for sustaining any longer an active part on the political theatre who∣ever from an indolent disposition sought a place where the pleasures of the town were combined with the sweets of a rural life whoever wished to with∣draw from the dangerous neighbourhood of a court and the baneful eye of informers flocked hither to enjoy life untainted with fear and trouble Such af∣fluence rendered Baiae as much a miracle of art as it was before of nature its splendor may be inferred from its innumerable ruins heaps of marbles mosaics and other precious fragments of taste  It flourished in full glory down to the days of  Theo∣doric  the Goth but the destruction of these enchanted palaces followed quickly upon the irruption of the Northern conquerors who overturned the Roman system sacked and burned all before them and de∣stroyed or dispersed the whole race of nobility Loss of fortune left the Romans neither the means nor indeed the thought of supporting such expensive esta∣blishments which can only be enjoyed in perfection during peace and prosperity No sooner had opu∣lence withdrawn her hand than the unbridled sea rushed upon its old domain moles and buttresses were torn asunder and washed away whole promon∣tories with the proud towers that once crowned their brows were undermined and tumbled headlong into the deep where many feet below the surface pave∣ments of streets foundations of houses and masses of walls may still be descried Internal commotions of the earth contributed also largely to this general devas∣tation mephitic vapours and stagnated waters have converted this favourite seat of health into the den of pestilence at least during the estival heats yet Baiae in its ruined state and stripped of all its ornaments still presents many beautiful and striking subjects for the pencil  As we rowed under the lofty headlands says  Swin∣burne  our Cicerone pointed to vaults and terraces  and allotted them respectively to the residence of some illustrious personage of antiquity The sands abound with fragments rolled from the ruins and some men employ themselves in the summer time in dragging the bottom of the sea with small baskets and seldom fail of bringing up with the sand a medal or corne∣lian that repays them for their time and labour  At the bottom of the bay and at the foot of the steep rocks which serve as a foundation to the ruins called  Nero  's house are some dark caves of great depth leading to the hottest of all vapour baths no one can remain long in them or indeed penetrate to the end without an extraordinary degree of strength and resolution These baths thirty in number are said to have been adorned with Greek inscriptions and statues denoting by their expressions and atti∣tudes what particular part of the human frame was af∣fected and relieved from its pains by each particular bath  Parrino  informs us that three physicians of Salerno apprehensive of the ruin that the surprizing efficacy and reputation of these waters would bring upon their college came hither in the dead of the night mutilated the figures defaced the letters and as far as their time would allow disturbed the course of the springs but the historian adds very gravely that Hygeia ever watchful over the health of Naples revenged this barbarous outrage by conjuring up a  storm that buried the three doctors in the sea before they could reach their home or triumph in the success of their villainy The springs at the bottom of the grotto are so hot as to boil an egg hard almost instan∣taneously  Martyn  says these baths are much fre∣quented and that there are sometimes from the hos∣pitals of the annunciation alone at Naples above nine hundred patients  As for the city of Baiae which stood on this coast there is not the least remains to be seen of it The fort lately built here is called Baia and stands upon a rock but the air of it is so unwholesome that the governor sleeps every night at Puzzuoli which is on the opposite side of the bay about three miles distant Sometimes prisoners are brought to this fort which is more dreaded than any other prison in Italy  On the sea shore facing Baiae is an ancient temple of  Mercury  which may be looked upon as the pan∣theon in miniature for it is not above twentyfive common paces in diameter It is quite round with an aperture in the center of the roof for the admission of light two persons directly opposite to each other and whispering close to the wall may converse with each other without being overheard by the company in the middle  Not far from this temple and nearer Baiae is an octangular shell of a temple of  Venus  Behind this temple is a dark apartment hewn in a rock called  La stanza di Venere  or  Venus  's apartment the roof of which is embellished with basreliefs These pieces represent nothing obscene or immodest but only my∣thological stories and emblems as a man pursuing a woman a cupid several swans fishes festoons c  After passing a precipice that projects over the sea the remains of  Hortensius  's villa are to be seen This celebrated orator  Cicero  unjustly calls  Triton  because he had accustomed the fishes in his ponds to come to his call and fed them with his own hand  Near  Hortensius  's villa is shewn an ancient ruin said to have been the monument of  Agrippina  who was put to death by  Nero  her own son Within it on the lefthand is an apartment to which we ascend by a ladder where are several basreliefs of plaister representing a sphynx a griffin and other imaginary animals A figure of a woman about two feet high to be seen here passes for  Agrippina  herself and adjoining to this is a smaller apartment where anti∣quarians say that her remains were deposited but with what truth or even probability is not easily de∣termined For  Tacitus  affirms that even after the death of her unnatural son the tomb of  Agrippina  consisted only of an heap of earth thrown together between Misenum and the villa of  Julius Coesar  That this unfortunate princess had a seat in this neigh∣bourhood is unquestionable as appears from  Tacitus  but the same author points out its situation near the Lucrine lake  Between Baia and Cape Miseno are likewise several other remains of antiquity but by the ex∣planations of them are mostly grounded on uncer∣tain conjectures Among other pieces there has been dug up hereabouts a statue of  Venus  twice as big as the life holding a globe in one hand and three golden apples in the other from whence some anti∣quarians conclude that  Venus Genetrix  must have had a temple in this neighbourhood and as  Julius Coesar  had a countryseat near Baiae others still farther alledge that he founded and built this temple  On this coast there is likewise an ancient temple called  Boaula  or  Boalia  ascribed to  Hercules  who according to the ancient fable brought hither the oxen which he had stolen in Spain Even still a small district here bears the name of  Baulo  or  Baula  concerning which  Silius Italicus  says  Hercules videt ipse littore Baulos  Lib xii  "Herculean Bauli founded on that shore He view'd"  The antiquarians are at a loss where to look for Bauli or the villa where  Nero  conducted his mother after her coming from Antium According to  Tacitus  it must have stood between Cape Misenum and the Lago Bojano  That the Elysian fields extend themselves towards the  Dead Sea  is taken for granted but as for the exact situation some look for it about the district of Baula where at present stands a mean village others place the Elysian fields near the  Mereato del sabato  as it is called Others again are positive that the Elysian fields must have been in the neigh∣bourhood of Cuma All these spots the fertility of the soil excepted which produce delicious fruits and wine exhibit nothing so beautiful and striking as to deserve the appellation of Elysian fields  It was at Bauli which is very near Baiae observes Lady  Millar  that the monster  Nero  contrived the means of assassinating his mother  Acinetus  who commanded his fleet at Cape Misenum was the man who suggested to him the contrivance of a false bot∣tom to the ship on board of which  Agripina  em∣barked after a great feast given by her son to ratify their reconciliation Here it was also that the famous triumvirate  Coesar Pompey  and  Mark Anthony  met and consulted and here it was adds Lady  Millar  we  sat down amongst a number of peasants not in a winehouse but at the door of one extremely hungry and fatigued and fed most heartily on very coarse bread anchovies and eggs but our beverage was Falernian wine very justly celebrated by  Horace  the growth of the  Monte Falerno  one of the mountains that bounded our view  The whole of this beauteous bay formerly the seat of pleasure and at one period the most populous spot in Italy is now very thinly inhabited and the con∣trast is still stronger between its ancient opulence and present poverty than between the numbers of its an∣cient and present inhabitants It must be acknow∣ledged that we can hardly look around us in any part of the world without perceiving objects which to a contemplative mind convey reflections on the instability of grandeur and sad vicissitudes and re∣verses to which human affairs are liable but here those objects are so numerous and so striking that they must make an impression on the most careless passenger  In returning from Baia to Puzzuoli there is a road close by the sea hewn through a rock and near it is an inscription in Latin  "Instead of the road raised by  Hercules  amidst the fury of the waves repaired by  Coesar  when dictator for selfinterest and restored by  Agrippa  for ostentation and after all ruined by the violence of the sea  Pedro Antonio  of Arragon in the reign of  Charles  II having for the health of the public put the baths in a good condition has on the firmness of a rock substituted this road contrived by a wiser  Her∣cules  destined to a better purpose and which will stand in no need of a  Coesar  or an  Agrippa  Tra∣veller go on chearfully along the Arragonian road to Baiae where as the marble underneath informs thee are noble baths not subservient to luxury but con∣ducive to health "  CHAP VII  Of the Environs West of Naples  HAVING now taken a view of the environs East of Naples we will proceed to the Western side which is no less interesting on account of Hercula∣neum Pompeii and the museum at Portici  A broad level road by the seaside and through a village where many of the nobility have villas leads to the palace at Portici at a small distance from which is the entrance into Herculaneum a city buried by a torrent of lava that issued from the mountain in the first year of the emperor  Titus Vespasian  The thick∣ness of the heap that covers it has been much in∣creased by fiery streams vomited since that cata∣strophe and now forms a mass of twentyfour feet deep of darkgrey stone which is easily broken to pieces By its nonadhesion to foreign bodies marbles and bronzes are preserved in it as in a case made to fit them and exact moulds of the faces and limbs of statutes are frequently found in this substance  The elder  Pliny  lost his life in this irruption he and his companions says his nephew the younger  Pliny  went out from his house in order to escape They had pillows upon their heads with napkins as the best and only defence against the storms of stones that fell around them It was day every where else but here a deeper darkness prevailed than in the most obscure night which in some degree however was dissipated by torches and other lights of various kinds They proceeded as far on the shore as they could in hopes of finding some means of putting out to sea but found the waves run extremely high and boisterous There says this author in his letters my  The DEATH of PLINY  uncle having drank a draught or two of cold water threw himself down upon a cloth that was spread for him when immediately the flames and a strong smell of sulphur which was the forerunner of them dis∣persed the rest of the company and obliged him to rise He raised himself up with the assistance of two of his servants and instantly fell down dead suffo∣cated as I conjecture by some gross and noxious va∣pour having always had weak lungs and frequently subject to a difficulty of breathing  The precise situation of this subterraneous city was not known till the year when it was acci∣dentally discovered by some labourers who in dig∣ging a well struck upon a statue on the benches of the theatre Many others were afterwards dug out and sent to France by the prince of Elbeuf but little progress was made in the excavation till  Charles  infanta of Spain ascended the Neapolitan throne by his unwearied efforts and liberality a very conside∣rable part of Herculaneum has been explored and such treasures of antiquity drawn out as form the most curious museum in the world It being too arduous a task to attempt removing the covering the king contented himself with cutting galleries to the principal buildings and causing the extent of one or two of them to be cleared of these the theatre is the most considerable On a balustrade which di∣vided  the orchestra from the stage was found a row of statues and on each side of the pulpitum the equestrian figure of a person of the Nonian family they are now placed under the porticos of the palace and from the great rarity of equestrian statues in marble would be very valuable objects were their workmanship even less excellent than it is one of them in particular is a very fine piece of sculp∣ture  Since the King of Spain left Naples the digging has been continued but with less spirit and expen∣diture indeed the collection of curiosities brought out of Herculaneum and Pompeii is already so con∣siderable that a relaxation of zeal and activity be∣comes excuseable  This city says  Northall  must have been situated where Portici is at present for we knew we crossed under the main street by hearing the coaches rattle over our heads It has been called by the poets the city or the saltpits of  Hercules Urbs Herculea Sa∣linoe Herculeoe  This was one of the most ancient cities of Europe and is supposed to have been built before the Trojan war  Dionysius  of Halicarnassus relates that it was founded by  Hercules  and though many of the relations of  Dionysius  are fabulous yet there are many reasons why his account of this city  ought not to be suppressed or rejected According to him  Hercules  having destroyed the tyrants and rob∣bers who infested Spain and Gaul passed the Alps and entered Italy where he built Pompeia and after∣wards Herculaneum at which place his fleet met him The Romans became masters of the city two hundred and ninetythree years before Christ The agreeable situation of this coast induced many Romans to build villas there and it appears there were several at Her∣culaneum  Cicero  mentions one belonging to  Fabius  and  Seneca  another built by  C Coesar  It appears likewise by a description given by  Statius  of these villas that they were decorated with the finest paint∣ings and sculpture by  Aleppo Phidias Polycletus  and other Greek masters which will account for the great number of exquisite remains of ancient art found in the city of Herculaneum  It is at Portici six miles from Naples that the superb museum of antiques found at Herculaneum and Pompeia is deposited Were there nothing but the cabinet of Portici and Pompeia worth viewing in Italy they alone would considerably repay any tra∣veller for all the inconveniences he must suffer from bad roads bad inns c should they be even more wretched says Lady  Millar  than some that we have experienced  From these gloomy vaults speaking of the descent into Herculaneum I returned says  Swinburne  with eagerness to contemplate the riches they once con∣tained now arranged in a wing of the palace of Por∣tici This museum possesses not only statues busts altars inscriptions and other ornamental appendages of opulence and luxury but also an entire assortment of the domestic musical and chirurgical instruments used by the ancients tripods of elegant form and ex∣quisite execution lamps in endless variety vases and basons of noble dimensions chandeliers of the most beautiful shapes pateras and other appurtenances of sacrifice lookingglasses of polished metal coloured glass so hard clear and well stained as to appear like emeralds sapphires and other precious stones a kitchen completely fitted up with copper pans lined with silver kettles cisterns for heating water and every necessary for culinary purposes specimens of various sorts of eatables retaining their form though burnt to a cinder corn bread fish oil wine and flour a lady's toilet fully furnished with combs thimbles rings paint earrings c the busts fill se∣veral rooms but very few of the originals whom they are meant to imitate are known The floors are paved with ancient mosaic few rare medals have been found in these ruins the most curious is a gold medallion of  Augustus  struck in Sicily when he had been saluted emperor fifteen times The fresco paint∣ings  which for the sake of preservation have been torn off the walls and framed and glazed are to be seen in another part of the palace the elegance of the attitudes and the infinite variety of the subjects stamp them as performances worthy of the attention of artists and antiquarians but no pictures yet found are masterly enough to prove that the Greeks car∣ried the art of painting to so great a height of per∣fection as they did that of statuary yet can we sup∣pose those authors incapable of appreciating the merits of an  Apelles  or a  Zeuxis  who with so much critical discernment have pointed out the beauties of the works of a  Phidias  or a  Praxiteles  beauties that we have still an opportunity of contemplating Would they have bestowed equal praises on both kinds of performances if either of them had been much in∣ferior to the other I think it is not probable and we must presume that the capital productions of ancient painters being of more perishable materials than busts and statues have been destroyed in the fatal disasters that have so often afflicted both Greece and Italy Herculaneum and Pompeii were but towns of the second order and not likely to possess the masterpieces of the great artists which were usually destined to adorn the more celebrated temples or the palaces of kings and emperors  A more valuable acquisition than bronzes and pic∣tures were thought to be made when a large parcel of manuscripts was found among the ruins hopes were entertained that many works of the classicks which time has deprived us of were now going to be restored to light and that a new mine of science was on the point of being opened But the difficulty of unrolling the burnt parchment of pasting the frag∣ments on a flat surface and of decyphering the ob∣scure letters have proved such obstacles that very little progress has been made in the work A priest invented the method of proceeding but it would re∣quire the joint labours of many learned men to carry on so nice and tedious an operation with any success Perhaps such an employment would be well calcula∣ted to fill up the idle hours of the nuns whose delicate fingers are best adapted to so nice an operation At present the work is suspended and manuscripts lie in dusty heaps as useless to the learned world as they had been for the preceding seventeen centuries One volume that was unrolled and completely read con∣tained a Greek treatise against the bad effects of music in a republic  Among the antique marbles the figures of animals as well the fabulous as those that imitate nature are finely done they were used to convey water into the baths and there is much humour expressed in their  countenance especially in those of the chimeras ba∣silisks c An elegant statue of  Diana  in white marble carved after the purple gown worn by the Roman ladies of antiquity the garment is edged with a lace exactly resembling point it is about an inch and an half broad and has been purple and gilt great part of which still remains The statue busts basreliefs in bronze which are very numerous are of such ex∣quisite workmanship that it is not in the power of the most able artist of this day to execute representations in metal of any kind that can rival or even bear a competition with many of them  All the rooms about ten in number are paved with antique mosaic exactly as they found their pre∣sent floors in Herculaneum these rooms being con∣structed of similar dimensions for their reception and no two of them are of the same pattern  The Al'y Grec  borders encompass every different floor and are cu∣rious in their regularity and linear intricacy One pavement particularly deserves notice it represents a Roman camp forming an exact square in the middle of each side is a gate fronting the center Towers of three stories high at equal distances encompass the whole they are all alike in size except those at the angles which appear larger and more considerable than the others The seats for the musicians found in the orchestra at Herculaneum are curious the  frames and legs being still perfect they are of bronze and have been gilt some of the gilding still remains the legs represent two serpents on each side of the stool which forming a kind of cross somewhat like two Ss describe the serpentine line of beauty and produce a most graceful effect Here are also in∣scriptions setting forth the names of those who used the bath at Stabia  Amongst the utensils in bronze the scales and weights deserve notice for the delicacy of their work∣manship It appears that the weights commonly used were busts of gods or heroes suspended by a ring The scales are of various sizes besides a great many instruments for weighing like those called in England steelyards to which the weights resembling human figures seem to have belonged The moulds for ices and various instruments for ornamenting pastry clearly prove the luxury of those times to have far exceeded in fertility of invention that of our day a great va∣riety of strainers pierced in the most curious manner and which are frequently found in pairs one fitting into the other but for what use designed is not easy to determine many of them are in silver others in bronze Here are culinary utensils of more various shapes and sizes than can be found in the best fur∣nished modern kitchen  One of these rooms is built and furnished in the exact conformity with a kitchen discovered entire it contains a number of articles many of them so com∣plicated that their use does not clearly appear each vessel is of bronze and of fine workmanship upon the whole it seems indisputable that the ancients em∣ployed more refinements in their entertainments than the moderns and must have served up a much greater variety of dishes than we do The dressers stewholes stoves boilers fishkettles resemble ours though they seem to have been better contrived The lamps to light the apartments and the candelabras to sustain them shew a surprising fertility of invention and execution Here are also tunable bells of dif∣ferent sizes for their cattle resembling those in Eng∣land called  tintinabula  also keys letters to stamp with perhaps to mark linen instruments of agricul∣ture surgery and mathematics Another article of culinary use which would be very convenient and agreeable in England is a kind of portable kitchen which does not exceed the size of a commodious platewarmer in the center is a vase for water under it a furnace for fire with an invention for boiling meat at the same time that it heats the water this vase has a double bottom and three little flews or chimneys for carrying off the smoke the double bot∣tom admits of stewing any thing in the manner called by the French  à la braise  this would be a most con∣venient  machine for those who like to eat in parks or gardens They have cups and saucers in silver of superior sculpture to any I have ever yet seen and resembling in make those now used for tea and cof∣fee their handles are so curiously contrived as to balance them and prevent their overturning however carelessly held when full  The instruments of music I particularly remarked are the following the seringa or flute of several notes formed of bone and which may be frequently seen as the insignia in painting if not always accom∣panying the God  Pan  and the satyrs the  Crotali  these are like basons or deep saucers with broad brims they were struck against each other and are of brass The  Sistrum  in shape like a horseshoe crossed by several wires passing through holes and so made as to admit of their slipping from side to side when this instrument is waved by the hand the wires produce a loud noise The  Tibioe  or double flute this is made of metal  In armoury are many shields iron boots spears c In short were we to describe all the curious articles that have been dug out of this celebrated city it would fill a volume Such accounts have been published and to these we must refer the reader  whose taste for antiquities will lead him to such en∣quiries  Sixteen miles North of Naples stood the ancient city of Capua which is said at one period to have vied in magnificence with Rome and Carthage  Han∣nibal  's army is said to have been conquered by the luxuries of this place Whether Capua brought on the ruin of  Hannibal  or not it is certain that  Hannibal  occasioned the ruin of Capua The Capuans having broken their connexion with Rome and formed an alliance with her enemy were besieged by  Fulvius  and  Appius Hannibal  exerted all his abilities for his new friends but was not able to bring the Romans to a battle or to raise the siege and Capua fell a victim Capua was a flourishing city three hundred and fifty years before the birth of Christ and in the time of  Augustus  contained three hundred thousand inhabi∣tants and a great number of magnificent buildings It continued in a state of grandeur during the conti∣nuance of the Roman empire but afterwards suffered greatly from the Goths next fell into the hands of the Lombards and was at last burnt by the Saracens in Twelve years after this its inhabitants removed to New Capua then built about three miles from it Several villages are erected on the scite of Old Capua and one of them bears its name but the only remains of its former grandeur worth noticing is an amphi∣theatre  the lower order Tuscan with a Doric over it In its present imperfect state the architecture ap∣pears clumsy it was built with brick and faced with stone or marble but the facing is all carried off Many of the ruins have been removed into the new town the walls of the townhouse are lined with them and exhibit gigantic grotesque heads which adorned the keystones of the amphitheatre private houses are also enriched with fragments of these ruins and the Cathedral can boast of many of them  Modern Capua is but a small place fortified with a rampart The streets are narrow dirty illpaved and thin of people There is but one inn in the town yet it is an archbishopric No city in Italy contains a greater number of ancient inscriptions brought here from old Capua and a statue of king  Charles  II of Spain is erected in the marketplace The country between this and Naples distance six∣teen miles is fertile and delightful in the extreme The causeway though of a much later date than the Appian way it is not at all inferior to it and in many parts the rows of trees planted on each side form a fine visto more than a mile in length The country on each side is diversified with cornfields gardens and vineyards and the vines climbing up the lofty trees and interwoven with their luxurious branches from a kind of natural festoon  The king is building a palace at Casserta on the plain where ancient Capua stood out of all propor∣tion to the revenues of the kingdom and when finished will be one of the most spacious and magni∣ficent palaces in Europe This immense building is of a quadrangular form feet English by about feet high comprehending five habitable stories which contain such a number of apartments as will accommodate the most numerous court without any accessary buildings  The quadrangule is divided into four courts each about feet by In each of the two princi∣pal fronts are three corresponding gates forming three openings which pierce the whole building The middle gates form the entry to a magnificent portico for coaches The grand staircase is adorned with the richest marble and all the apartments correspond with the external appearance  Moore  tells us that when he was there in among the workmen em∣ployed in finishing this palace were one hundred and fifty Africans taken prisoners from the states of Bar∣bary with whom Naples is always at war There were about as many Christian slaves condemned to work there for crimes against the laws they are however better cloathed and fed than the Africans  The gardens belonging to this palace are equally extensive and magnificent A great number of fine statues most of them copies of the best antiques are there in readiness to set up when the gardens are finished which probably are by this time Here was a very large elephant kept by African slaves In the garden is an artificial water and an island with a kind of castle on it regularly fortified and a nu∣merous train of artillery some of them nine or ten pounders I no sooner entered this fort says  Moore  than I wished uncle Toby and corporal Trim had been of our party it would have charmed the soul of the worthy veteran and his faithful servant  At Lorrento on a bay of the sea eighteen or twenty miles South of Naples the town that gave birth to  Tasso  in are the noble ruins of a villa men∣tioned in  Statius  's  Sylvoe  that belonged to  Pollius Foelix  it appears to have been accurately described by that poet for though the smaller features are disfigured the great outlines of the place are still discernable  CHAP VIII  Of the several Cities c  AVELLINO is a city about thirty miles west of Naples in the road to Tarento we enter it by a fine avenue a mile long between two rows of poplars remarkable for their height bulk and close∣ness of foliage The country from Naples is delight∣ful particularly the immense plains of Nola remark∣able for the invention of bells which are one entire grove of tall elms and poplars planted in rows to support the vines growing at their feet and stretching their branches from tree to tree in beautiful garlands Between the lines the husbandman sows corn and pulse without any fallow and to prevent the land from being exhausted raises early crops of Lupins and beans which he hoes up before they seed and buries for manure The harrowing and rolling is performed by oxen This soil is a sandy volcanic loam very rich and vegetative  Avellino is a considerable city extending a mile in length down the declivity of a hill with ugly streets but tolerable houses The churches have nothing to recommend them being crouded with mon∣strous ornaments in a barbarous stile apparently bor∣rowed from the Spaniards The cathedral is a poor building The good people of this town need not run to Naples to see the blood of St  Januarius  for they have a statue of St  Lawrence  with a phial of his blood which for eight days in August entertains them with a similar miraculous liquefaction Their only edifice of note is a public granary of the com∣posite order adorned with antique statues and a very elegant one in bronze of  Charles  II king of Spain whilst a boy The number of inhabitants is between eight and ten thousand The bishop's revenue about l sterling a year The magistracy consists of a syndic and four eletti all annual which offices are engrossed by a certain number of families that neither intermarry nor associate with the rest of the burghers There is a manufactory here that dyes cloth made up of various qualities and colours but chiefly blue the duty of which brings in a revenue to the prince of l yearly They make also here a great deal of macaroni which is in great repute all over the country  Avellino abounds with cattle and provisions of every kind a good mule sells for eleven pounds English and a bullock for nine pounds Each street is supplied with wholesome water but their wine is in∣different The volcanic soil produces little corn but fruit in abundance particularly the hazel nut Nutbushes cover the face of the valley and in prolific years bring in a profit of ducats equal to l English They are what we call Spanish nuts  The women of this neighbourhood are handsome and take great pains to deck out their persons to ad∣vantage Once a week they wash their hair with a lye of wood ashes that changes it from a dark brown to a flaxen yellow of many different tints in the same head of hair This I take says  Swinburne  to be the true  flava Coesaries  of the Latin poets Experience has taught me to discover many traces of ancient cus∣toms in the modes and habits of the modern Italians Attentive observation will recognize the  Preficoe  of the ancients in the appearance and actions of old women hired in Calabria to howl at burials A clas∣sic scholar cannot stroll under the groves of the plain without calling to mind  Horace  's  Durus  Vindemiato et invictus cui soepe viator  Cecisset magnâ compellans voce cucullum  SAT vii  That is "The rough and invincible vinedresser before whom the traveller often relaxed calling him cuckold" for he will see this vinedresser sitting among the boughs lashing raw lads and bashful maid∣ens as they return from market with the same gross wit and rough jokes that gave such jest to the farces of  Atella  That verse in  Virgil  "The lopper shall sing to the winds under the lofty rock"  Hinc altâ sub rupe canet frondator in adversus  ECL i  Naturally strikes us when in our walks under the rocky clifts of Pausilippo we see the peasant swing∣ing from the top of a tree on a rope of twisted wil∣lows trimming the poplar and the luxuriant tendrils of the vine and making the whole vale ring with his rustic ditty  Great likenesses may be found among the paintings of Herculaneum of the Neapolitan girls dancing to the snapping of their fingers and the beat of a tam∣bourine their petticoats whirling about them A young fisherman of Naples naturally throws his limbs into the most graceful attitudes and it was no doubt from the study of similar figures that the Grecian sta∣tuaries drew their nice ideas of beauty and perfection of form  If an antiquary longs for a Roman dish  Sorento  will supply him with the teats of a sow dressed in the an∣tique taste by the name of Verina The rigging of small vessels at the present day answers the descrip∣tion of ancient sailing and without examining the trim of these boats it will not be easy to comprehend the manoeuvres of  Ulysses  or  Aeneas  in their various navigations  In descending the last ridge of hills between the Eastern and Western courts of Italy we come into the extensive plains of Puglia in the center of which stands Foggia a principal town of the province of Capitanata without walls citadel or gates It is neatly built of white stone and has two or three good streets The customhouse has a handsome edifice This town with many others on the coast of the Adri∣atic was ruined in by an earthquake and has been rebuilt with neatness and regularity In sum∣mer the air is unwholesome and all who can remove desert it during the hot months In winter it con∣tains twenty thousand inhabitants including strangers All the large streets and open squares are undermined with vaults where corn is buried and preserved sound from year to year  This town has been of some consequence in former years and still is being a staple for corn and wool  and where the toll of sheep is paid to and from Puglia for vast quantities of sheep descend in autumn from the mountains of Abruzzo into the warm plains of Puglia to yean and in May return to the high country The invention of this duty is ascribed by  Varro  to the ancient Romans who on subduing the Italian states were accustomed to allot the improved lands to their noncitizens whilst they left the wastes and less cultivated tracts to the original possessors on their paying a tenth of the produce of the cornlands and a fifth of all other fruits Breeders of cattle and sheep were to compound with the censors In later times the emperor appropriated all such common lands to themselves and caused them to be considered as royalties As this traffic increased the crown not being possessed of a sufficient range of pasture for the great flocks purchased other lands of the Puglian pro∣prietors These royal pastures are bounded by stones and are known by the name of  Taooliere  they ex∣tend sixty miles in length and thirty in breadth and are capable of feeding one million two hundred thousand sheep in return the shepherds of Abruzzo bound themselves for ever to drive their flocks here yearly from the mountains and to pay certain duties or toll for every one hundred head of sheep This duty is called the  dogana  and is one of the richest mines of wealth belonging to the crown of Naples It has been continually increasing Soon after its in∣stitution  it cleared ducats in it pro∣duced At present the neat profit arising to the king from letting the pastures is about ducats but with the duties in tallow wool c this amounts to  On account of the great variety of field sports to which the adjacent hills and plains are peculiarly adapted this town was a favourite residence of the German princes  Charles  I of Spain erected a sump∣tuous palace here and died in this place in his way to Brindisi in The Puglian sportsmen run down hares with greyhounds and pursue the wild boar with one lurcher and two or three mastiffs The hunters ride with a lance and a pair of pistols  A few miles from Foggia are some faint traces of walls said to be those of Arpi or Argyripae once the capital of a kingdom founded by  Diomed  after the siege of Troy The flat pastures about this place and Manfredonia for twenty miles abound in aspho∣dels thistles wild artichokes and fennelgrant of the last are made beehives and chairbottoms The leaves are given to asses and the peasants eat the ten∣der buds when boiled as a delicacy This plant says  Swinburne  who travelled over the spot covers half the plain between Foggia and Manfredonia and grows so high that there is an instance in one  of the wars between France and Spain of the Spa∣niards having marched through it undiscovered close up to the French entrenchments The artichokes are given to buffaloes  Manfredonia is a city built by  Manfred  in In order to found it under the most favourable aus∣pices he called together the most eminent professors of astrology a science he had great confidence in and caused them to calculate the happiest hour and minute for laying the first stone The port was secured from storms by a pier the ramparts were built of the most solid materials and in the great town was hung a bell of so considerable a volume as to be heard over all the plain of Capitanata to alarm the country in case of invasion In spite however of all the pre∣cautions taken by  Manfred  neither his pains or the horoscopes of his wizards have been able to render it opulent or powerful It carries on a direct trade in corn with Venice and Greece but has scarce six thousand inhabitants It was pillaged by the Turks in All sorts of vegetables abound here and are infinitely superior to those raised in the volcanic soil of Naples and fish is plentiful and cheap  About twenty miles South of Manfredonia on the coast in the way to Brindisi are the fields of Cannae famous for the victory obtained over the Romans by  Hannibal  in the th year of Rome The traces of the town are very faint consisting of fragments of altars cornices gates walls vaults and underground granaries It was destroyed the year before the bat∣tle The scene of action is marked out to posterity by the name of  Pezzo di Sangue  "field of blood" The peasants frequently turn up spurs and heads of lances with the plough and horse loads of armour and weapons have been at different times carried away The bread of this place is as brown as ma∣hogany and quite gritty owing to the incompact tex∣ture of the stone with which the millers grind their corn They beat out their corn here by the tramp∣ling of a great number of mares tied in a string by their tails and whipped round and round In the  Terra di Otranto  they do this by a pair of oxen who drag between them a heavy rough stone that forces out the grain  Barletti is another city on the coast a little more to the South It has a ruinous aspect its walls tumb∣ling down and its ditches filled with rubbish but the city within though thinly inhabited is magnificently built It conveys the idea of some mighty state re∣duced by conquest to a province or depopulated by pestilence Its streets are wide and well paved the houses large and lofty and built with hewn stone which from age has acquired a polish like marble  Some of these venerable mansions have the stones cut angularly after the Tuscan manner Many houses still retain painted arches short twisted columns and other remnants of the taste of the Saracens who are supposed to have built them whilst others are deco∣rated with all the embellishments of the old Grecian architecture The cathedral is remarkable for its an∣tique granite columns  Ferdinand  I was crowned here  In the marketplace stands a bronze colossal statue seventeen feet three inches high supposed to repre∣sent the emperor  Heraclius  who began his reign in He is standing drest in a military habit crowned with a diadem a short cloak hanging from his left shoulder and thrown over his left arm which holds a globe his right arm is raised above his head and grasps a small cross The image is rude and incor∣rect and the attitude awkward  Swinburne  supposes it to have been cut in Italy and dressed after the Roman fashion The citadel is spacious and commands the port which is a labyrinth consisting of several irre∣gular piers where ships are moored but not sheltered from the North The exports here are salt corn almonds and liquorice which last grows here spon∣taneously in the swamps  The next city southward is Trani a seaport town also and an archbishopric There is here a colle∣giate seminary but the students seem averse to study From time immemorial no work is done in Trani after dinner so that the whole afternoon is spent by the in∣habitants in dozing chattering or sauntering Though the exportation of corn from this place is considerable it seems the only business stirring Industry seems to have forsaken the cities on this coast there are too many of them so that jealous of each other they enfeeble their trade and being averse to all friendly intercourse never study their interests All sorts of vegetables here are plentiful and exquisite the mar∣ketpeople sell beans and peas by weight and use peb∣bles in lieu of weights  Trani is tolerably well built with stone on uneven ground The harbour is encircled by the town and has scarcely depth of water enough to float a boat The corn ships anchor two miles from the shore The cathedral was erected six hundred years ago and is a mean building Here is also a castle consisting of some gloomy towers but the monastery of St  Clare  is a sumptuous enclosure If there was a good road on this coast it would be delightful to travel it with the Adriatic on one side and olive groves on the other There are other cities between Trani and Brindisi viz Bisceglia Molfetta Giovenazzo and  Bari As they have nothing remarkable we shall pass them and speak of Bari  Bari makes a great figure at a distance it is de∣fended by double walls and an old castle occupying a rocky peninsula of a triangular form about a mile in circumference The houses are in general mean but built on a soil raised by the ruins of former edi∣fices near thirty feet above the level of the sea From the rampart says  Swinburne  at every turn of the eye we catch a different view of the sea and coast stretching from the mountains of Garganus to the hills of Ostuni The towns that rise along this line in various de∣grees of shade have a beautiful effect and nothing can be more picturesque than the fleets of fishingboats steering for their respective harbours on the approach of night On shore the bloom of spring and lively foliage contrasted with innumerable white cottages form an enchanting rural scene  This city is also an archbishopric The cathedral has no extensive beauties and its revenues do not ex∣ceed l English Its steeple is one of the highest in the kingdom about feet from the ground among the treasures of this place is an iron diadem with which some Barian writers pretend the Norman kings were crowned Religious orders abound in Bari and some of them have rich gaudy churches  with good paintings Here are twelve convents for men five for women and three hospitals The in∣habitants are about are an active painstaking set of people and carry on a good trade in oil and almonds They also export to the Venetian islands a large quantity of potash soap aniseed and garlick  Brindisi was the ancient Brundusium that gave birth to  Pacuvius  and where  Virgil  died In this city  Octavianus  first assumed the name of  Coesar  and here he concluded one of his shortlived peaces with  Antony  The barbarians who ravaged every corner of Italy did not spare so rich a town and in the Saracens gave a finishing blow to its fortunes The phrenzy for expeditions to Palestine it being one of the ports where pilgrims and warriors took ship∣ping contributed powerfully to the reestablishment of this city It was also benefited by the residence of the emperor  Frederick  whose frequent armaments for the Holy Land required his presence at this place of rendezvous but the loss of Jerusalem the fall of the Grecian empire and the ruin of all the Levant trade after the Turks had conquered the East re∣duced Brindisi to a state of inactivity and desolation from which it has never been able to emerge The Appian way passing Bari terminated at Brundu∣sium  Brindisi as it now appears is a great city if the extent of its walls be considered but the inhabited houses do not fill above half the enclosure The streets are crooked and rough the buildings poor and ruinous and it has no very remarkable church or edifice The canons of the cathedral retain the an∣cient custom of having handmaids but as they take care to choose them says  Swinburne  of canonical age and face we may suppose these  focarioe  to be only chaste representatives of the helpmates allowed the clergy before popes and councils had reprobated them These women are exempt from taxes and enjoy many privileges When they die they are buried gratis and the funeral is attended by the chap∣ter with great solemnity a mark of respect not paid to any relations of the canons  Near the port stand the walls of a palace erected by  Walter de Brienne  in a very bad taste Its ma∣terials are grey stone divided at regular distances with broad courses of black marble Little remains of ancient Brundusium except innumerable broken pillars fixed at the corners of streets to defend the houses from carts fragments of coarse mosaic work the floors of former habitations the column of the lighthouse a large marble bason into which the water runs from brazen heads of deer some inscrip∣tions ruins of aqueducts coins and other small fur∣niture  of an antiquary's cabinet The castle built to protect the Northern branch of the harbour is large and stately  The port is double and the finest in the Adriatic The outer part is formed by two promontories that stretch off gradually from each other as they advance into the sea leaving a very narrow channel at the base of the angle The island of St Andrew on which is a fortress lies out between the capes and secures the whole road from the fury of the waves In this deep pit or space large ships may ride at anchor At the bottom of the bay the hills recede in a semicircular shape to leave room for the inner haven which as it were clasps the city in its arms or rather encircles it in the figure of a stag's head and horns This form is said to have given rise to its name Brundusium in the old Messapian language signifying a deer's head Nothing can be more beau∣tiful than this interior port or better adapted to trade and navigation It is very deep and extends in length two miles and a half in breadth feet in the widest part The hills and the town shelter it on all sides The north ridge is plentifully cultivated and planted but that to the South is bare of wood and all sown with corn In ancient days the com∣munication between the two havens was marked by lights placed on Corinthian columns Of these one  remains entire on its pedestal is built with a green and white marble its capital adorned with figures of Syrens and Tritons mixed with the Acanthus leaf and upon it is a circular vase which formerly held the fire The whole kingdom of Naples cannot shew a more complete situation for trade and yet it has nei∣ther commerce husbandry nor is it populous From the obstructions in the channel of communication between the outer and inner haven arises the tribe of evils that desolate this unhappy town  Julius Coesar  may be said to have begun its ruin by attempting to block up  Pompey  's fleet He drove piles into the neck of land between the two ridges of hills threw in earth trees and ruins of houses and had nearly accomplished the blockade when  Pompey  sailed out and escaped to Greece See the plate where the references are marked by birds  Roman way  Castle  Lighthouse  Point of land where  Julius Coesar  formed the blockade  The old way into the harbour  The new way  The castle of the Isle of St Andrew  The Atlantic  BRINDIS ANCIENTLY BRUNDUSIUM  In the fifteenth century the prince of  Tarento  sunk some ships in the middle of the passage to prevent the royalists from entering the port which became a rest∣ingplace for seaweeds and sand and thus blocked up the passage In the evil was increased so as to prevent the waves beating through and from this period the port became a fetid green lake no fish but eels could live in it nor any boat ply except canoes of a single tree The low grounds at each end were overflowed and converted into marshes which every summer created such a pestilence as in a few years swept off the greatest part of its inhabitants From the number of eighteen thousand they were re∣duced in to five thousand livid wretches tor∣mented with agues and malignant fevers In fifteen hundred died during the autumn Well may  Swinburne  call this a woeful change of climate Forty years ago the air of Brindisi was esteemed so wholesome that the convents of Naples used to send their consumptive friars here for the recovery of their health This induced the remaining citizens to apply for relief to one of the kings  Marcestus  who was a native of the place and the port has been reopened in consequence It will now admit large boats the sea rushes in and out at all tides and the canal which is seven hundred yards long in a direct line from the column is cleared its parapets de∣fended by piles and fascines and it is in contempla∣tion  to erect stone piers on each side Sir  Wil∣liam Hamilton  says in the canal is now so choaked up as to have only seven feet in depth of of water in many places and the pestilential air is as prevalent as ever The engineer who undertook to clear it failed but another is appointed who means to widen the canal to sixtyseven feet and make it twentyone feet deep but there is every reason to fear says Sir  William  that the proposed remedy will prove ineffectual and that this unfortunate city is doomed to speedy destruction The workmen in clearing the channel have found some medals and seals and have drawn up many piles says  Swinburne  that were driven in by  Julius Coesar  They are small oaks stripped of their bark and still are as fresh as if they had been cut only a month though buried above eighteen centuries seven feet under the sand The soil about the town is light and good produces ex∣cellent cotton which is manufactured into gloves and stockings at Brindisi  CHAP IX  In Continuation  THE next city of any note is Lecce this lies between the North latitudes of and in the peninsula called the heel of Italy the breadth of which is about thirty miles Lecce is on the Eas∣tern coast Gallipoli on the Western The country here is open interspersed with some coppices of small jagged leaved oaks the fields decorated with loose stone walks The Adriatic sea here is not more than sixty miles over the snowy tops of the Grecian mountains are in a clear day visible The villages in this peninsula make a very pleasing appearance the houses being built with white stone but the churches are ornamented in a very barbarous style and the face of the country is too rocky and too bare of trees corn and grass to be agreeable  Lecce the capital of Terra di Otranto the seat of its tribunal and the second city in the kingdom is  better paved and built than any town in this pro∣vince If the builders here had the smallest taste the buildings would make a noble figure for the stone of the country is so fine white and soft when taken from the quarry that it may be moulded like wax and will receive any form from the chisel yet when exposed to the air becomes hard and durable but the architecture here says  Swinburne  is cramped into such crowded uncouth decorations as to be far in∣ferior to that of the Goths and Saracens Many of the paintings in the churches and houses of the no∣bility are by  Verrio  a native of Lecce long em∣ployed in England he died in The number of people here does not exceed thirteen thousand very inadequate to the extent of the city which has the reputation of being to the kingdom of Naples what Thebes was to Greece and a native of Lecce is said to be distinguishable from his fellowsubjects by his heavy manner and dull comprehension It has notwithstanding an academy of Belles Lettres Lecce is twentyfour miles from Brindisi and is a bishoprick Music is here cultivated with a degree of enthusiasm and many of the nobility are good per∣formers and proud of exhibiting on solemn festivals Leccean music has a very plaintive character peculiar to itself  Otranto is a small city stands on a hill and con∣tains only three thousand inhabitants Its harbour small but convenient The cathedral is Gothic and agreeable to the mode in Puglia has a subterranean sanctuary The columns are of beautiful marble and granite the pavement a rude species of Mosaic called Saracenic like the tomb of  Edward  I in West∣minsterabbey These mosaics are composed of pieces of porphyry serpentine and cubes of gilt glass dis∣posed in stars coiles or chequers The compart∣ments of the halls are bordered with them and the small twisted columns that support the pulpits and ca∣nopies are ornamented with a spiral shape of the same work  Otranto was a Roman colony and is an arch∣bishop's see It was invaded by the Turks in invested stormed and pillaged its prelate was slain at the church door eight hundred principal inhabi∣tants dragged out of the gates and butchered and their bodies left unburied for twelve months  Swin∣burne  says he was entertained here with the music of some of those itinerant performers that play at Christ∣mas in the streets of Rome and Naples Their na∣tive country is Basilicata where the inhabitants of the Apennines learn from their infancy to raise the mat∣tock with one hand and play on the bagpipe or flagelet with the other With these people music  is rather a talent awakened by necessity than an act of pastime or luxury Their usual employment is draining of lands but as such work is not always needful they travel with their musical instruments for a maintenance all over Italy France and Spain Some have gone as far as America and brought back much wealth with them Their concerts are gene∣rally composed of two musicians who play in unison with two long large bagpipes one an octave higher than the other whilst a third sounds a kind of hautboy and at the end of each ritornel chants a rural ditty to which the bagpipes play an accompa∣niment The instruments are all made by the shep∣herds themselves in those forms and sizes which tra∣dition has handed down to them and experience has taught them to imitate  Being in the country of the tarantula Mr  Swin∣burne  took some pains to investigate every particular respecting that insect but could find no person bitten with it the season of the year not being far enough advanced He however prevailed on a woman who had formerly been bitten to act the part and dance before him Many musicians were summoned and she performed it as they all declared to per∣fection At first she lolled stupidly on a chair whilst the strains were dull but when the men touched the chord supposed to vibrate to her heart she  sprang up with a hedious yell staggered round the room like a person drunk holding a handkerchief in both hands raising them alternately and moving in very true time As the music grew brisker her motions quickened and she skipped about with great vigour and variety of steps every now and then shrieking very loud Wherever a person bit is to dance a place is prepared for them hung round with ribbands and bunches of grapes The patients are dressed in white with red green and yellow rib∣bands these being the favourite colours on their shoulders they cast a white scarf let their hair fall loose about their ears and throw their heads as far back as they can bear it They are exact copies of the ancient priestesses of  Bacchus  The orgies of that god whose worship under various symbols was more widely spread over the globe than that of any other divinity were doubtless performed with energy and enthusiasm by the lively inhabitants of this warm climate The introduction of Christianity having abolished all these heathenish rites and the women not daring to act any frantic part as bacchantes  Swinburne  is of opinion that unwilling to give up so darling an amusement they devised other pretences Accident may have led them to the discovery of the tarantula and on the strength of its poison the Pug∣lian dames still enjoy their old dance though time has effaced the memory of its ancient name and insti∣tution  It has been proved that the tarantula is a harmless insect and the insanity said to be occa∣sioned by its bite and cured by music is an impo∣sition only on the credulous It is a large spider with eight eyes placed four two and two  Gallipoli lies on the Eastern shore of the penin∣sula about thirty miles from Otranto in the gulph of Tarento It stands on a rocky island joined to the continent by a bridge near which flows a foun∣tain of very fine water From the remotest antiquity this station was so very favourable to commerce that every maritime power wished to secure it but the crown of Naples has so deserted it that it has neither harbour nor shelter for shipping Its inhabitants do not exceed six thousand but they are easy in their circumstances lively merry and in general well in∣formed The air is rather consumptive The build∣ings are tolerable and some of the churches have good paintings Good muslins cotton stockings and other parts of apparel are here manufactured and pur∣chased by the Provencals The cotton trade brings in about thirty thousand ducats yearly Their wine is good but oil is the great support of the place Twothirds of all olive plantations are exported to France and the north of Italy the remainder is sent to Naples and other Italian ports In oil was exported to the value of one million of ducats  The olive tree is here attended with the greatest care The fruit is not gathered but kept till it falls The common method of making oil is to crush the olives to a paste with a perpendicular millstone run∣ning round a trough This paste is put into flat round rush baskets piled one upon another and then put under a press After the first pressing scald∣ing water is poured into each basket its contents stirred up and they are again pressed and so re∣peatedly till no more oil can be skimmed from the surface  Tarento is the next city we shall mention and shall dwell rather longer upon this as affording more entertainment to our readers It is nearly in the same latitude with Brindisi only on the Western coast of the peninsula about thirty miles from Brin∣disi It is a seaport at the upper end of the gulph of Tarento and admits of reflections on the general vicissitudes of the fate of empires Tarento where now scarce a single fishing boat disturbs the bosom of its waters is that where the trading vessels of half the world once rendezvoused where the mighty navy of Carthage once displayed its flag Of all the tem∣ples gymnasia theatres and other monuments of glory and opulence not so much as a single column rises on the hill where Tarentum once stood which is on the left in the plate of the present town the  paltry buildings of some mean convents mark its ancient scite whilst the modern city crowded into a narrow island holds the place of the old citadel and still resembles a fortress more than an emporium of trade but in spite of all this change Tarento is still replete with wonderful beauties  The present city stands upon a neck of land di∣vided from the opposite country by the sea of Pic∣colo which runs from the gulph of Tarento by a narrow streight six miles up into the country form∣ing a large oval lake three miles wide divided into two bays by a narrow promontory Tarento is joined to the opposite land by a bridge of seven arches Through these the tide flows with great im∣petuosity and nothing now but small boats can be ad∣mitted which before the building of the bridge was the entrance of the harbour On this bridge is carried the aqueduct that supplies the city with water from the opposite shore This bay and the city is a delightful scene Olive woods clothe the fine ground on both sides and the opposite hills are rich in cornfields and orchards Over the city and beyond the bridge ships appear at anchor in the gulph or outer port and the blue mountains of Basilcata on the right complete the prospect See the plate  VIEW of TARENTO from the SEA of PICCOLO  view of Tarento  The city of Tarento has not much to boast of The streets are remarkably dirty and narrow particularly the Marina which runs along the Mare Piccolo and is without dispute the most disgustful habitation of human beings in Europe except perhaps the Jesuits Ghetto at Rome The only tolerable street is a ter∣race above the steep rocks that hang over the gulph or great sea and prevent all access on that quarter The cathedral has but little merit The square near the bridge is the only opening of any extent and the general resort of the citizens in summer when they sit round the fountain to enjoy the soft evening breeze and refresh themselves with the fanning of the balmy air In the hot summer months the air is not very wholesome but the archbishop is studying every means to improve the place by cultivation and other means  Swinburne  was well entertained here At the priory he had for supper fifteen different sorts of shellfish all fat and savory particularly a small mus∣cle tinged both within and without with the richest violet colour and the shell covered with shag This muscle is dragged for in the great sea and then scat∣tered on heaps of stones sunk by the fishermen at every headland of the Mare Piccolo  Brundusium was the great supply of oysters for the Roman tables From that port the spawn was car∣ried to stock their public reservoirs at the Lucrine  lake near Baia and no mention is made by the an∣cients of any Tarentine shellfish except the scallop but they have now ninetythree different sorts all eat∣able and oysters among the rest Very fine branch∣ing coral is also found along the East coast of this city the places are kept a secret The quantity may be judged of by a boat's crew once drawing up in one day as much as sold for ninetythree pounds fif∣teen shillings English that is five hundred ducats each ducat three shillings and ninepence sterling  The seas of Tarento are as copiously stocked with the scaly and finny tribes as with the crustaceous and testaceous The people depend on their fishery for subsistence and pay very heavy duties to the crown and rents to private persons The King receives l ayear for rent  Never was a place more completely swept off the face of the earth than Tarentum not a single ruin left scarce a mark that such a city ever existed on the spot and yet we are well assured by historians that a rival of Rome once raised her proud towers and arrayed her numerous armies along these now lone∣some hills Near the Alcantarine convent is a small hillock wholly formed of the shells of fish employed by the ancients in the composition of their celebrated purple dye and not far from it are the remains of  some reservoirs and conduits belonging to their work Below the ruins of these reservoirs the shore is thickly strewed with fragments of Etruscan vases and a little nearer the city is the Argentaria where the gold and silversmiths had their shops It still deserves the name from a number of medals rings chains and other trinkets constantly dug out of it  The cotton manufacture employs these poor Ta∣rentines who are not able to be fishermen The pay of a husbandman is a carline fourpence halfpenny a day Cultivation goes on well in some places the crops are divided between the landlord and the farmer but the quantity of waste lands is incredible and whatever pains they bestow on cornlands no one has an idea of improving either pasture or meadow Not a seed is sown not a weed destroyed not a bush grub∣bed up  I must not omit to mention the greatest curiosity in this part of the world which is a well mentioned by  Pliny  in his second book  Juxta oppidum Manduriam lacus ad margines plenus neque exhaustis aquis minuitur neque enfusis augetur  "Near the town of Manduria is a lake full to the brim whose waters never diminish nor increase by addition" This well  Swinburne  ex∣amined it excites the admiration of the people as much now as it did in ancient days The water in  this circular cavern lighted from above by a spacious aperture never rises or falls beyond a certain mark If as much rubbish be thrown in as will fill it halfway up it never rises the water above the mark if the rubbish rises above the mark the water disappears Clear away the mud to the bottom and you find a hard smooth floor without any signs of a chasm for the water to run off The water is good and supplies the town of course all experiments on it are for∣bidden  Every baron in this country keeps a certain num∣ber of trusty determined fellows to protect his vassals convey his rents and prevent depredations on his game and forests They howl by the side of his coach to defend his person and baggage The rad∣knights or radmen kept by ancient barons were of the same kind  END OF VOL XV  DIRECTIONS for PLACING the PLATES OF
