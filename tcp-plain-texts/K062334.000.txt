And leaves the grate to solitude and me  II  Now throws the western sun a fainter glare  And silence sooths the vestal world to rest  Save where some paleey'd novice wrap'd in pray'r  Heaves a deep groan and smites her guiltless breast  III  Save that in artless melancholy strains  Some Eloisa whom soft passion moves  Absorpt in sorrow to the night complains  For ever bar'd the Abelard she loves  IV  Within these ancient walls with moss o'erspread  Where the relenting sinner learns to weep  Each in her narrow bed 'till midnight laid  The gentle daughters of devotion sleep  V  Of wantonness the pleasurebreathing lay  Or laughter beck'ning from his rosy seat  Or vanity attir'd in colours gay  Shall ne'er allure them from their lonely state  VI  For them no more domestic joys return  Or tender father plies his wonted care  The nuptial torch for them must never burn  Or prattling infants charm the ling'ring year  VII  Oft do they weave the chaplets pictur'd gay  To deck their altars and the shrines around  How fervent do they chant the pious lay  How thro' the length'ning isle the notes resound  VIII  Let not the gay coquette with jest profane  Mock their veil'd life and destiny severe  Nor worldly beauty with a sneer disdain  The humble duties of the cloister'd fair  IX  The glist'ning eye the halfseen breast of snow  The coral lip the bright vermilion bloom  Awaits alike th' inexorable foe  The paths of pleasure lead but to the tomb  X  Nor you ye vain impute to these the fault  If flatt'ry to their fame no trophies raise  Where thro' the dome with grandeur's treasures fraught  The num'rous fopplings lift the voice of praise  XI  Can artful phrases or alluring words  Bid the pale cheek assume a second prime  Can ev'n Apollo's sweetlysounding cords  Arrest the speedy steps of conq'ring time  XII  Perhaps in this drear mansion are confin'd  Some whose accomplish'd beauty can impart  Each soft emotion to the sternest mind  And wake to extacy the beating heart  XIII  But pleasure flies them a forbidden guest  Deck'd with the flow'rs in youth's gay path that bloom  The claycold hand of penance chills their breast  And o'er the rays of fancy throws a gloom  XIV  Full many a riv'let wand'ring to the main  Sequester'd pours it's solitary wave  Full many a flower is rooted from the plain  To waste it's sweetness on the desert grave  XV  Some veil'd Eliza like the clouded Sun  May here reside inglorious and unknown  Some like Augusta might have rear'd a son  To bless a nation and adorn a throne  XVI  From flatt'ry's lip to drink the sweets of praise  In rival charms with other belles to vie  In circles to attract the partial gaze  And view their beauty in th' admirer's eye  XVII  Their lot forbids nor does alone remove  The thirst of praise but e'en their crimes restrain  Forbids thro' folly's labyrinth to rove  And yield to vanity the slacken'd rein  XVIII  To raise 'mid Hymen's joys domestic strife  Or seek that converse which they ought to shun  To loose the sacred ties of nuptial life  And give to many what they vow'd to one  XIX  Far from the circle of the splendid throng  They tread obscurity's sequester'd vale  Their lonely hours unvaried creep along  Unfan'd by pleasure's ever shifting gale  XX  What tho' they're sprinkled with etherial dew  With blooming wreaths by hands of seraphs crown'd  Tho' heav'n's unfading splendors burst to view  And harps celestial to their ear resound  XXI  Still grateful mem'ry paints the distant friend  Not ev'n the world to their remembrance dies  Their midnight orisons to heav'n ascend  To stay the bolt descending from the skies  XXII  For who entranc'd in visions from above  The thought of kindred razes from the mind  Feels in the soul no warm returning love  For some endear'd companion left behind  XXIII  Their joy encircled hearth as they forsook  From some fond breast reluctant they withdrew  As from the deck they sent a farewell look  Fair Albion sunk for ever to their view  XXIV  For thee who mindful of th' encloister'd train  Dost in these lines their mournful tale relate  If by compassion guided to this fane  Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate  XXV  'Haply some aged vestal may reply  'Oft have we heard him 'ere Aurora's ray  'Had painted bright the portal of the sky  'At yonder altar join the matin lay  XXVI  'Where hapless Eloisa sought repose  'Oft at yon grave wou'd he her fate condole  'And in his breast as scenes of grief arose  'Sigh the kind requiem to her gentle soul  XXVII  'One morn I miss'd him at the hour divine  'Along that Isle and in the sacristy  'Another came nor yet beside the shrine  'Nor at the font nor in the porch was he  XXVIII  'The next we heard the bell of death intone  'And in the fearful grave we saw him laid  'Approach and read on this sepulchral stone  'The lines engrav'd to sooth his hov'ring shade  THE EPITAPH  XXIX  BY Fate's stern hand untimely snatch'd away  Does this deep vaulted cave a youth unfold  He gave to solitude the studious day  And pity fram'd his bosom of her mould  XXX  With lyre devoted to companion's ear  Did he bewail the vestal's hapless doom  Oft has this marble catch'd his falling tear  And for that gen'rous tear he gain'd  a tomb  THE MAGDALENS An ELEGY  I  AT yonder hallow'd rail what scenes appear  A num'rous train of suppliant nymphs I spy  Their youthful cheek is pal'd with early care  And sorrow dwells in their dejected eye  II  Hark they awake a solemn plaintive lay  Where grief with harmony delights to meet  Not Philomela from her lonely spray  Trills her clear note more querulously sweet  III  Are these the fair who wont with conscious grace  Proud Ranelagh's resplendent round to tread  Shine in the studied luxury of dress  And vie in beauty with the highborn maid  IV  The smiling scenes of pleasure they forsake  Obey no more amusement's idle call  Nor mingling with the sons of mirth partake  The treat voluptuous or the festive ball  V  For sober weeds they change their bright attire  Of the pearl bracelet strip the graceful arm  Veil the white breast that lately sigh'd desire  And to the wrapt eye heav'd th' imprison'd charm  VI  Unbraid the cunning tresses of the hair  And each wellfancied ornamentremove  The glowing gem the glitt'ring solitaire  The costly spoils of prostituted love  VII  Yet beauty lingers on their mournful brow  As loth to leave the cheek bedew'd with tears  Which scarcely blushing with a languid glow  Like morn's faint beam thro' drizzling rain appears  VIII  No more compare them to the stately flow'r  Whose painted foliage wantons in the gale  They look the lily drooping from the show'r  Or the pale vi'let sick'ning in the vale  IX  Let not the prude with acrimonious taunt  Upbraid the humble tenants of this dome  That pleasure's rosy bow'r they us'd to haunt  And in the walk of looserob'd dalliance roam  X  If fond of empire and of conquest vain  They frequent vot'ries to their altars drew  Yet blaz'd those altars to the fair one's bane  The idol they and they the victim too  XI  Some in this sacred mansion may reside  Whose parent's ashes drank their early tears  And hapless orphans trod without a guide  The maze of life perplext with guileful snares  XII  Some that encircled by the great and rich  Were won by wiles and deepdesigning art  By splendid bribes and soft persuasive speech  Of pow'r to cheat the young unguarded heart  XIII  Some on whom beauty breath'd her radiant bloom  Whilst adverse stars all other gifts remov'd  Who fled from mis'ry and a dungeon's gloom  To scenes their inborn virtue disapprov'd  XIV  What tho' their youth imbib'd an early stain  Now gilded by the rays of newborn fame  A second innocence they here obtain  And cloister'd penance heals their wounded name  XV  So the young myrtles nipt by treach'rous cold  While still the summer yields his golden store  In shelt'ring walls their tender leaves unfold  And breathe a sweeter fragrance than before  XVI  Tho' whitewing'd peace protect this calm abode  Tho' each illicit passion be suppress'd  Still recollection wears a sting to goad  Still fang'd remorse invades their anxious breast  XVII  The tort'ring hour of mem'ry this may prove  Who wrapt in pensive secresy forlorn  Sits musing on the pledges of her love  Expos'd to chilly want and grinning scorn  XVIII  Forgot deserted in th' extremest need  By him who ought to shield their tender age  Was this seducer this the promis'd meed  She cries then sinks beneath affliction's rage  XIX  Another mourns her fall with grief sincere  Whom tranquil reason tells she's shun'd disdain'd  Repuls'd as vile by those who held her dear  Who call'd her once companion sister friend  XX  That recollects the day when lost to shame  She fondly sacrific'd her vestal charms  Resign'd the virgin's for an harlot's name  And left a parent's for a spoiler's arms  XXI  Imagination pencils to her mind  The father's rage the mother's softer woe  Unhappy pair to that distress consign'd  A child can give a parent only know  XXII  The tragic picture fixes sorrow's dart  While filial passions in her breast revive  She feels beak'd anguish preying at her heart  To nature's pangs too sensibly alive  XXIII  If this or similar tormenting thought  Cling to their soul when pensively alone  For youth's offence for Love's alluring fault  Say do they not sufficiently atone  XXVI  Oh mock not then their penitential woes  Thou who may'st deign to mark this humble theme  Nor seek with foul derision to expose  And give to infamy their tainted name  XXV  Nor deem me one of melancholy's train  If anxious for the sorrowwedded fair  Tho little skilful of poetic strain  Whose pleasing music takes the tuneful ear  XXVI  I steal impatient from the idle throng  The roving gay companions of my age  To temper with their praise my artless song  And softey'd pity in their cause engage  XXVII  'Tis virtue's task to soothe affliction's smart  To join in sadness with the fair distrest  Wake to another's pain the tender heart  And move to sympathy the feeling breast  THE NUN An ELEGY  Tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum  I  WITH each perfection dawning on her mind  All beauty's treasure opening on her cheek  Each flatt'ring hope subdued each wish resign'd  Does gay Ophelia this lone mansion seek  II  Say gentle maid what prompts thee to forsake  The paths thy birth and fortune strew with flow'rs  Thro' nature's kind endearing ties to break  And waste in cloister'd walls thy pensive hours  III  Let sober thought restrain thine erring zeal  That guides thy footsteps to the vestal gate  Lest thy soft heart this friendship bids reveal  Like mine unblest shou'd mourn like mine too late  IV  Does some Angelic lonelywhisp'ring voice  Some sacred impulse or some dream divine  Approve the dictates of thy early choice  Approach with confidence the awful shrine  V  There kneeling at yon altar's marble base  While tears of rapture from thine eyelid steal  And smiling heav'n illumes thy soul with grace  Pronounce the vow thou never can'st repeal  VI  But if misled by falseentitled friends  Who say'that peace with all her comely train  'From starry regions to this clime descends  'Smooths ev'ry frown and softens ev'ry pain  VII  'That vestals tread contentment's flow'ry lawn  'Approv'd of innocence by health carest  'That rob'd in colours bright by fancy drawn  'Celestial hope sits smiling at their breast  VIII  Suspect their syren song and artful style  Their pleasing sounds some treach'rous thought conceal  Full oft does pride with sainted voice beguile  And sordid int'rest wear the mask of zeal  IX  A tyrant Abbess here perchance may reign  Who fond of pow'r affects the imperial nod  Looks down disdainful on her female train  And rules the cloister with an iron rod  X  Reflection sickens at the lifelong tie  Backglancing mem'ry acts her busy part  Its charms the world unfolds to fancy's eye  And sheds allurement on the wishful heart  XI  Lo discord enters at the sacred porch  Rage in her frown and terror on her crest  Ev'n at the hallow'd lamps she lights her torch  And holds it flaming to each virgin breast  XII  But since the legends of monastic bliss  By fraud are fabled and by youth believ'd  Unbought experience learn from my distress  Oh mark my lot and be no more deceiv'd  XIII  Three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled  When I was torn from ev'ry weeping friend  A thoughtless victim to the temple led  And blush ye parents by a father's hand  XIV  Yet then what solemn scenes deceiv'd my choice  The pealing organ's animating sound  The choral virgin's captivating voice  The blazing altar and the priests around  XV  The train of youth array'd in purest white  Who scatter'd myrtles as I pass'd along  The thousand lamps that pour'd a flood of light  The kiss of peace from all the vestal throng  XVI  The golden censers toss'd with graceful hand  Whose fragrant breath Arabian odor shed  Of meekey'd novices the circling band  With blooming chaplets wove around their head  XVII  My willing soul was caught in rapture's flame  While sacred ardor glow'd in ev'ry vein  Methought applauding Angels sung my name  And heav'n's unsullied glories gilt the fane  XVIII  Methought in sunbeams robed the heav'nly spouse  Indulg'd the longings of my holy love  Not undelighted heard my virgin vows  While o'er the altar wav'd the mystic dove  XIX  This temporary transport soon expir'd  My drooping heart confess'd a dreadful void  E'er since alas abandon'd uninspir'd  I tread this dome to misery allied  XX  No wakening joy informs my sullen breast  Thro' opening skies no radiant seraph smiles  No saint descends to soothe my soul to rest  No dream of bliss the dreary night beguiles  XXI  Here haggard discontent still haunts my view  The sombre genius reigns in ev'ry place  Arrays each virtue in the darkest hue  Chills ev'ry pray'r and cancels ev'ry grace  XXII  I meet her ever in the chearless cell  The gloomy grotto and unsocial wood  I hear her ever in the midnight bell  The hollow gale and hoarseresounding flood  XXIII  This caus'd a mother's tender tears to flow  The sad remembrance time shall ne'er erase  When having seal'd th' irrevocable vow  I hasten'd to receive her last embrace  XXIV  Fullwell she then presag'd my wretched fate  Th' unhappy moments of each future day  When lock'd within this unrelenting grate  My joydeserted soul wou'd pine away  XXV  Yet ne'er did her maternal voice unfold  This cloister'd scene in all its horror drest  Nor did she then my trembling steps withhold  When here I enter'd a reluctant guest  XXVI  Ah cou'd she view her only child betray'd  And let submission o'er her love prevail  Th' unfeeling priest why did she not upbraid  Forbid the vow and rend the hov'ring veil  XXVII  Alas she might nother relentless lord  Had seal'd her lips and chid her streaming tears  So anguish in her breast conceal'd its hoard  And all the mother sunk in dumb despair  XXVIII  But thou who own'st a father's sacred name  What act impell'd thee to this ruthless deed  What crime had forfeited my filial claim  And giv'n Oh blasting thought thy heart to bleed  XXIX  If then thine injur'd child deserve thy care  Oh haste and bear her from this lonesome gloom  In vainno words can soothe his rigid ear  And Gallia's laws have riveted my doom  XXX  Ye cloister'd fair ye censurebreathing saints  Suppress your taunts and learn at length to spare  Tho' mid these holy walls I vent my plaints  And give to sorrow what is due to pray'r  XXXI  I fled not to this mansion's deep recess  To veil the blushes of a guilty shame  The tenor of an illspent life redress  And snatch from infamy a sinking name  XXXII  Yet let me to my fate submissive bow  From fatal symptons if I right conceive  This stream Ophelia has not long to flow  This voice to murmur and this breast to heave  XXXIII  Ah when extended on th' untimely bier  To yonder vault this form shall be convey'd  Thou'lt not refuse to shed one grateful tear  And breathe the requiem to my fleeting shade  XXXIV  With pious footstep join the sable train  As thro' the lengthening isle they take their way  A glimmering taper let thy hand sustain  Thy soothing voice attune the funeral lay  XXXV  Behold the Minister who lately gave  The sacred veil in garb of mournful hue  More friendly office bending o'er my grave  And sprinkling my remains with hallow'd dew  XXXVI  As o'er the corse he strews the rattling dust  The sternes  heart will raise compassion's sigh  Ev'n then no longer to his child unjust  The tears may trickle from  a father's  eye  ALISIA A BALLAD  I  TO yon dark grove Alisia flew  Just at th' appointed hour  To meet the youth whose bosom true  Confess'd her beauty's pow'r  II  All that fair beauty cou'd bestow  Or fairer virtue give  Did on his face unrival'd glow  And in his bosom live  III  But not the charm of beauty's flow'r  Or virtue's fairer charm  Cou'd in her father's soul the pow'r  Of Avarice disarm  IV  He bad the youth his mansion fly  And scorn'd his ardent vow  And when the tears flow'd from his eye  He bad them faster flow  V  Alisia with a bleeding mind  Beheld the injur'd youth  And vow'd in holy wedlock join'd  To crown at length his truth  VI  As she forsook her native seat  'Farewell ye fields so fair  'May blessings still my Father meet  'She saidand dropt a tear  VII  Th' oppression of a parent's hand  A parent dead to shame  In her meek breast by virtue fan'd  Ne'er quench'd the filial flame  VIII  Now safe she reach'd th' appointed ground  Tho' love was all her guide  But absent when the youth she found  She look'd around and sigh'd  IX  Each breeze that rustled o'er the tree  Sooth'd for a space her smart  She fondly criedOh that is he  While patted fast her heart  X  The pleasing images of hope  Night's terrors now deform  While on her mind drear sceneries ope  And raise the mental storm  XI  On some rude stone she bow'd her head  All helpless and forlorn  Now starting from her rugged bed  She wish'd the ling'ring morn  XII  With heavy heart I now unfold  What th' absent youth befell  Who fierce beset by ruffians bold  Oppress'd with numbers fell  XIII  At length the morn disclos'd its ray  And calm'd Alisia's fear  She restless took her various way  Distracted here and there  XIV  Thus as she wander'd wretched maid  To mis'ry doom'd she found  A naked corse along the shade  And gash'd with many a wound  XV  Struck to the soul at this dread scene  All motionless she stood  To view the raven bird obscene  Drink up the clotting blood  XVI  What horrors did her breast invade  When as she nearer drew  The features that the raven fed  Her lover gave to view  XVII  With shrieks she rent th' affrighted air  To tears had fond recourse  With frantic hand now tore her hair  Now sunk upon the corse  XVIII  Then throwing round a troubled glance  With madness' ray inflam'd  Beheld some travellers advance  To whom she thus exclaim'd  XIX  'Ye base inhuman train away  'What urg'd yon to this deed  'You've turn'd my gentle love to clay  'And bad me sorrow wed  XX  'Hark hark the raven flaps her wings  'She drinks his blood again  'Ah I now she feeds on my heartstrings  'Oh Jesu soothe my pain  XXI  This scene of woe what cou'd create  The travellers admir'd  While shrinking at the blow of fate  She with a groan expir'd  MATILDA A BALLAD  I  OUtrageous did the loud wind blow  Across the sounding main  The vessel tossing to and fro  Cou'd scarce the storm sustain  II  Matilda to her fearful breast  Held close her infant dear  His presence all her fears encreas'd  And wak'd the tender tear  III  Now nearer to the grateful shore  The shatter'd vessel drew  The daring waves now cease to roar  Now shout th' exulting crew  IV  Matilda with a mother's joy  Gave thanks to heaven's pow'r  How fervent she embrac'd her boy  How blest the saving hour  V  Oh much deceiv'd and hapless fair  Tho' ceas'd the waves to roar  Thou from that fatal moment ne'er  Did'st taste of pleasure more  VI  For stepping forth from off the deck  To reach the welcome ground  The Babe unclasping from her neck  Plung'd in the gulph profound  VII  Amazementchain'd her haggard eye  Gave not a tear to flow  Her bosom heav'd no conscious sigh  She stood a sculptur'd woe  VIII  To snatch the child from instant death  Some brav'd the threat'ning main  And to recal his fleeting breath  Try'd ev'ry art in vain  IX  But when the corse first met her view  Stretch'd on the pebbly strand  Awak'ning from her trance she flew  And pierc'd th' opposing band  X  With tresses discompos'd and rude  Fell prostrate on the ground  To th' infant's lips her lips she glew'd  And sorrow burst its bound  XI  Uprising now with frantic air  To the widecircling crowd  Who pitystruck partook her care  She thus discours'd aloud  XII  'Heard ye the helpless infant weep  'Saw ye the mother bold  'How as she flung him in the deep  'The billows o'er him roll'd  XIII  'May beak'd remorse her bosom tea  ▪  'Despair her mind upplough  'Its angry arm let justice rear  'To dash her impious brow  XIV  'But soft awhilesee there he lies  'Embalm'd in infant sleep  'Why fall the dewdrops from your eyes  'What cause is here to weep  XV  'Yes yes his little life is fled  'His heaveless breast is cold  'What tears will not thy mother shed  'When thy sad tale is told  XVI  Ah me that cheek of livid hue  'If much I do not err  Those lips were late the roses blew  'All all my son declare  XVII  Strange horrors chill my ev'ry vein  'A voice confus'd and wild  Whispers to this distracted brain  'Matilda slew her child  XVIII  She added notbut sunk oppress'd  Death on her eyelids stole  While from her much afflicted breast  She sigh'd her troubled soul  To  APOLLO bids the muses rove  The lonely path the silent grove  He bids the graces oft resort  To festive scenes and splendid court  Yet will he let the muse repair  To where Charlotta guards her heir  Unblam'd the royal babe approach  And strew fresh flow'rets o'er his couch  As on his cheek buds nature's rose  With virtue's bud his bosom glows  Whose foliage opening into day  Shall each  parental  streak display  And when the coming spring prevails  With sweets  maternal  scent the gales  Your choicest wreath ye fairies bring  To crown the little embrio king  Behold that hand with gewgaws play  Which shall Britannia's scepter sway  Attentive o'er the nurs'ry plain  Behold him range his mimic men  Unconscious of the future hour  When vested with imperial pow'r  He Herolike shall lead his train  To combat on a real plain  While victory shall bless the war  And scatter laurels from her car  Illustrious babe tho' deaf to praise  For thee I frame these humble lays  The day will come but may kind fate  Keep back that day 'till very late  When thou thy muchlov'd father's heir  Like him shal't grace the regal chair  Shalt hold approv'd th' imperial helm  And bless like him a grateful realm  Oh then shall praise ring out her peal  And flatt'ry her bright flow'rets deal  Ah if thine eye in future time  Shou'd chance to mark this artless rhyme  When stretch'd beneath the fun'ral ground  This frame shall lay with osier bound  Thou'lt find one of the muse's train  For thee awak'd his gentle strain  What time unconscious of the theme  That did unfold thy future fame  Thou cou'd'st not with a smile reward  The numbers of th' unvenal bard  While they who shall these lines peruse  If lines like these survive their muse  Shall own when they look up to you  That he was bard and prophet too  To the EARL of CHESTERFIELD AUGUST th  I  REclin'd beneath thy shade Blackheath  From politicks and strife apart  His temples twin'd with laurelwreath  And virtue smiling at his heart  II  Will Chesterfield the muse allow  To break upon his still retreat  To view if health still smooths his brow  And prints his grove with willing feet  III  Tho' gratitude is rarely found  At court or spacious drawingroom  Still shall she tread poetic ground  And favors past shall ne'er intomb  IV  'Twas this awak'd the present theme  And bad it reach thy distant ear  Where if no rays of genius beam  Sincerity at least is there  V  May pale disease fly far aloof  O'er venal domes its flag display  And health beneath thy peaceful roof  Add lustre to thine evening ray  VI  If this my fervent wish be crown'd  I'll dress with flowr's the godhead's shrine  Nor thou with wisdom's chaplet bound  At any absent gift repine  VII  What tho' thou dost not grace a throne  While subjects bend the supple knee  No other king the muses own  And science lifts her eye to thee  VIII  Tho' deafness by a doom severe  Steals from thy ear the murm'ring rill  Or Philomel's delightful air  Ev'n deem not this a partial ill  IX  Ah if anew thine ear was strung  Awake to ev'ry voice around  Thy praises by the many sung  Wou'd stun thee with the choral sound  THE NAIAD To Dr AKENSIDE  I  ONCE did this cool and twilight grot  Which babbling streams surround  And all this still umbrageous spot  Reecho to thy sound  II  Thy tuneful muse' harmonious sound  My mind retains the day  When circling Naiads beat the ground  In honor of thy lay  III  How pleasure brighten'd ev'ry face  How murmur'd soft the stream  How flush'd each flow'r a newborn grace  As conscious of thy theme  IV  E'er since the mazy tinkling rill  Or Philomela's air  Resounding clear at evening still  Are all the notes we hear  V  Rejoin nor let this pray'r be vain  Rejoin our pebbled haunts  Once more awake the unwilling strain  That our fair troop enchants  VI  Thee now alas occasion dear  Calls to this grotto's gloom  From Naiads gush the heartsprung tear  And soils their wonted bloom  VII  For Aganippe lovely maid  To mirth become a foe  On her white arm reclines her head  A prey to constant woe  VIII  This morn at twilight's grateful hour  The subject Naiad throng  Approach'd the virgin's lonely bow'r  And plied a soothing song  IX  But music's soothing art was vain  To raise her eyelids dim  'Till one of the fair choral train  Tun'd thine unrival'd  hymn  X  Ah when that pleasing line was heard  That sounds her grateful name  Her drooping head she gently rear'd  And own'd the powerful theme  XI  Revisit then our wat'ry bow'rs  And bring thy magic lyre  Ah bring thy wreath of smiling flow'rs  And lead the tuneful choir  WRITTEN IN MR HUME's HISTORY  I  BIG with the tales of other years  Here lays the historic tome  Which to the pensive mind appears  A deep capacious tomb  II  Where long embalm'd by Clio's hand  The patriot and the slave  Who sav'd and who betray'd the land  Press one extensive grave  III  With those that grasp'd the imperial helm  And trod the path of pow'r  With those who grac'd fair learning's realm  And beauty's fairer bow'r  IV  If thus th' illustrious close their scene  Oblivion then may laugh  What flows from Hume's immortal pen  Is but an Epitaph  THE LILY's TRIUMPH  THE sun unveil'd his brightest ray  The birds attun'd their sweetest lay  As Flora issued from her bow'r  To shed perfumes on ev'ry flow'r  As she approach'd her painted train  With joy she view'd the chearful scene  This flow'r she kiss'd and that she rais'd  She gather'd one another prais'd  Yet still of all her gay parterre  The lily seem'd her greatest care  Meek child the radiant goddess cried  Of gardens now be thou the pride  Know that Lucinda beauteous fair  Doth thee to all my train prefer  Ah go beyond thy equals blest  And breathe thine odor on her breast  Yet envy not that iv'ry shrine  Whose whiteness far surpasseth thine  By nature's hand with incense spread  Whose sweetness far doth thine exeeed  Enough that thou enjoy'st the seat  Where virtue and the graces meet  THE ROOKERY  OH thou who dwell'st upon the bough  Whose tree does wave its verdant brow  And spreading shades the distant brook  Accept these lines dear sister Rook  And when thou'st read my mournful lay  Extend thy wing and fly away  Lest pinionmaim'd by fiery shot  Thou should'st like me bewail thy lot  Lest in thy rook'ry be renew'd  The tragic scene which here I view'd  The day declin'd the evening breeze  Gently rock'd the silent trees  While spreading o'er my peopled nest  I hush'd my callow young to rest  When suddenly an hostile sound  Explosion dire was heard around  And level'd by the hand of fate  The angry bullets pierc'd my mate  I saw him fall from spray to spray  Till on the distant ground he lay  With tortur'd wing he beat the plain  And never caw'd to me again  Many a neighbour many a friend  Deform'd with wounds invok'd their end  All screaming omen'd notes of woe  'Gainst man our unrelenting foe  These eyes beheld my pretty brood  Flutt'ring in their guiltless blood  While trembling on the shatter'd tree  At length the gun invaded me  But wayward fate severely kind  Refus'd the death I wish'd to find  Oh farewell pleasure peace farewell  And with the gory raven dwell  Was it for this I shun'd retreat  And fix'd near man my social seat  For this destroy'd the insect train  That eat unseen the infant grain  For this with many an honest note  Issuing from my artless throat  I chear'd  my Lady  list'ning near  Working in her elbow chair  THE DIALOGUE  EVANDER  OH thou so very rarely found  With youth at once and wisdom crown'd  If yet no swain with happy art  E'er fond a passage to thy heart  Stain not thy cheek with crimson hue  But tell me fair Belinda true  Each vain distinction I'l remove  And take thee for my bridal love  BELINDA  This guileless breast does love awake  It glows for my Evander's sake  No daring youth shall ever steal  The sacred flame for thee I feel  Amid the grove the choicest tree  Does lov'd Evander seem to me  EVANDER  That happy tree shall prove a screen  To shield thee thro' life's various scene  From ev'ry gale that envy blows  From ev'ry blast that mis'ry knows  From danger's threat'ning clouds that low'r  Oppression's storm and sorrow's show'r  A flow'r recoiling from the gale  Just wakening in the lowly vale  And waving near the purest stream  To me does fair Belinda seen  BELINDA  Oh may the sun with pow'rful beam  Revive that flow'r beside the stream  Paint her all in the gayest bloom  And call forth ev'ry kind perfume  May Flora come in welcome hour  To raise her drooping from the show'r  May Zephyr with his cooling breath  Still fan away the sultry death  Till perfected at length by time  And opening in her brighest prime  She may by love and fortune blest  Breathe all her odors on thy breast  CELIA SLEEPING  I  WHERE yonder shades exclude the skies  The fairest of her sex was seen  While Morpheus seal'd her radiant eyes  And half eclips'd her lovely mien  II  Th' unerring archer by her side  In idle slumbers press'd the ground  The feather'd shafts in crimson dy'd  Were innocently spread around  III  'Twas then the youthful pleasures came  By their transparent cincture known  They danc'd around the beauteous dame  And jocund stole her sacred zone  IV  The kind occasion criedbe bolds  But Celia thou had'st nought to fear  The youth is by respect control'd  Whose bosom owns a love sincere  V  Alarm'd the little God I sought  And seiz'd his browencircling band  By Venus' rosy singers wrought  And veil'd thy charms with trembling hand  VI  The godhead starting from his dream  Straight gather'd every idle dart  And then vindictive took his aim  While many an arrow reach'd my heart  VII  Nor yet content the godhead swore  If thou woud'st not the band deliver  He wou'd on me exhaust his store  Nor leave a dart within his quiver  VIII  Let then my life by thee secur'd  O'er Cupid's spight at length prevail  Ah cure the wounds for thee endur'd  And throw away the hateful veil  To the D of QY  WHEN beauteous Qy reach'd her fiftieth year  A period fatal to the blooming fair  Time snatch'd his hostile scythe intent to mow  The native flow'rs that grace her lovely brow  Vain thought the scythe drop'd harmless from his hand  His hour glass falling lost the imprison'd sand  His agitated breast confess'd alarms  And the world's victor stood subdu'd with charms  At length withdrawing he revers'd the doom  And bad her features wear unfading bloom  THE STRAWBERRIES  THE winter left the naked plain  And spring's gay pencil deck'd the scene  And as she wav'd her magic wand  With early fruitage blush'd the land  'Twas then Pomona rais'd her head  And joyful view'd a strawb"ry bed  Two sister berries caught her eye  Impurpled with the brighest die  'These blushing twins the goddess said  And pluck'd them from their verdant bed  'I'll give to some thrice beauteous fair  'To bloom conceal'd beneath her care  ''Till an illustrious Duke whose name  'Is known to Ancestry and Fame  'Conducted by some partial pow'r  'Shall gather them at midnight hour  'And love remove the slender vest  'To light him to the heav'nly feast'  The blushing twins she thus address'd  Then fix'd them on Amanda's breast  On LADY SARAH B's CAT  WITH fancy's gay suggestion fraught  Venus indulg'd a frolic thought  Departing from her former plan  New schemes she fram'd to conquer man  Discharg'd her troop of smiling loves  Her archerson and cooing doves  Admitting to their vacant place  The gentlest of the purring race  This change of ministerial measures  Provok'd at first the youthful pleasures  They swore they wou'd no more resort  To Paphos or th' Idalian court  But reason their resentment cool'd  And bad them be by  Laura  rul'd  Ah happiest of the feline train  Wilt thou admit this artless strain  The lover now for Cupid's dart  Shall feel thy talon at his heart  Thy form upon the seal impress'd  Where Venus once her birds express'd  Shall stamp'd upon the crimson glue  Secure the secret billetdoux  Echo amid the darken'd grove  Shall heed no more the murm'ring dove  But in the precincts of  WhiteHall  Shall sit attentive to thy call  Ah happiest of the purring train  When Morpheus holds his silent reign  Thy Queen's love darting radiant eyes  That emulate the starry skies  'Tis thine with velvet foot to close  And gently purr her to repose  Ah wou'dst thou purr this heart to rest  And close the wounds within this breast  How grateful wou'd I wake the string  And Venus and her Laura sing  Imitated from the FRENCH  I  STRAYING beside yon woodskreen'd river  Dan Cupid met my wond'ring view  His feather'd arrows stor'd his quiver  Each feather glow'd a diff'rent hue  II  'For him who frames the daring deed  'The little godhead said and laugh'd  'To fly with Miss beyond the Tweed  'An eagle's plume adorns the shaft  III  'The prattler vain of his address  'The magpye's feathers never fail  'And for the youth too fond of dress  'I rob the gaudy peacock's tail  IV  'Whene'er I mean to rouse the care  'That lurks within the jealous heart  'The owl that wings the midnight air  'Lends his grave plume to load the dart  V  'But rarely when I wou'd assail  'The constant heart with truth imprest  'Then for the trembling shaft I steal  'A feather from the turtle's breast  VI  'Lo one with that soft plumage crown'd  'Which more than all my arms I prize'  Alas I cried this gave the wound  When late you shot from Julia's eyes  AN ELEGY WRITTEN AMONG THE RUINS OF AN ABBEY  I  WHERE sighs the zephyr to yon lonely tree  A solemn grove its leafy mantle spread  Where bend yon mould'ring turrets o'er the sea  A venerable dome once rear'd its head  II  The solemn grove the venerable dome  Were erst frequented by a num'rous train  Ev'n chaste as they who Dian's mountain roam  But not subjected to her gentle reign  III  Far other Goddess did this train obey  Far other temples other altars rais'd  Far other meaning breath'd their choral lay  Far other incense on their altars blaz'd  IV  Veil'd Superstition wak'd her magic sound  Bad Albion's sons forsake the splendid court  Forsake Amusement's variegated round  And to her sable standard here resort  V  Alas obsequious to her stern command  A sullenpensive brotherhood they came  Refus'd to trace the paths by nature plan'd  And raz'd from glory's page their ancient name  VI  Nor these alone were found incloister'd here  Here also dwelt the simpleminded swain  Who wrapt in sloth dream'd out the lazy year  'While Industry sat weeping on the plain'  VII  The many temples rising fair to view  Which tow'ring Superstition call'd her own  With hand unerring radiant Truth o'erthrew  And snatch'd th' impostor from her tinsel'd throne  VIII  On yon dustlevel'd spire the crafty maid  With indignation brooding in her breast  Sits gloomilyHer vot'ries all are fled  Her lamps extinguish'd and her rites suppress'd  IX  Within her hand a vacant string she holds  That once connected many a hallow'd bead  The blotted scroll the other hand unfolds  Contains the maxims of her slighted creed  X  Couch'd at her feet behold a mould'ring shrine  Of various relics once the dread abode  Where runs the spider o'er his treach'rous line  Where lurks the beetle and the loathsome toad  XI  On darkness' wing now sails the midnight hour  When for the grateful sound of choral pray'r  The shrieking owl from yon disparted tow'r  With notes of horror wakes her trembling ear  XII  Of human grandeur mark the fleeting day  How frail each purpose and each wish how vain  The strongbuilt domes the cloister'd fanes decay  And ruin hovers round the desert scene  XIII  The path that leads to yonder shatter'd pile  Is now perplex'd with many a sordid brier  No crowd is seen within the sacred isle  The Sabbath mourns its longdeserted quire  XIV  The golden crozier blended with the dust  In horrid folds the serpent clasps around  The pow'rful image and the sainted bust  Defam'd unhallow'd press the weedy ground  XV  Not distant far her goldencircled tow'r  Th' inviolable dome  majestic rear'd  On whose dread altar breath'd some hidden pow'r  By terror guarded and by kings rever'd  XVI  To which asylum ev'n th' assassin came  His hand audacious still imbru'd with gore  The boon of full impunity to claim  While feeble Justice wept her baffled lore  XVII  So Truth at once dissolv'd the mental chain  And banish'd Error from th' enlighten'd shore  So clos'd at length the busyacted scene  The curtain drop'd and Folly's mask was o'er  XVIII  Then gladsome Ceres rais'd her drooping head  While yellow harvests gilt the smiling plain  Beheld a youthful band around her spread  With sickles arm'd to reap the bearded grain  XIX  The warrior then beneath the trailing vest  The peaceful cassock or the drowsy cowl  No longer quench'd the flame within his breast  Or lull'd the purpose of his daring soul  XX  But rush'd undaunted to the doubtful war  Pursu'd where glory led the radiant way  Till Neptune rising on his coral car  Resign'd his wat'ry world to Britain's sway  XXI  The virgin fair by venal guardians doom'd  By error prompted or subdu'd by force  No more in cloisters drear their days consum'd  Like flowrets strew'd around the senseless corse  XXII  Triumphant Hymen hail'd the blissful hour  And saw a whiterob'd social train approach  For whom the Pleasures dress'd the happy bow'r  And scatter'd roses o'er the destin'd couch  XXIII  Still other blessings from this change appear'd  No injur'd family did then behold  On loit'ring monks its native wealth confer'd  Nor spacious altars cover'd with its gold  XXIV  Full many trod that crooked path to fame  Yet from her hand receiv'd no lasting meed  She from her annals rends their fading name  And gives to infamy the worthless deed  XXV  But vengeance some pursu'd with dire disgrace  Pursu'd beyond the circle of its sphere  Even to the cemetary's dark recess  Nor spar'd them sleeping on the peaceful bier  XXVI  Beside the spreading of that sombrous yew  Where yawns with hideous chasm the vaulted cave  Presenting to the fix'd astonish'd view  The profanation of a rifled grave  XXVII  The largeendowing Rufus lay inurn'd  With many a sculptur'd image on his shrine  That smit with sorrow o'er his ashes mourn'd  The SisterGraces and the tuneful Nine  XXVIII  Imprinted on Tradition's storied leaf  Is found to this sepulchral spot confin'd  A terrorbreathing tale that wins belief  And oft repeated by the neighb'ring hind  XXIX  From where yon mountain shades the dreary plain  Attracted by the scent of human blood  A troop of wolves voracious scour'd amain  And at this charnel vault requir'd their food  XXX  When horrid to relate they burst the tomb  And swift descending to the deepest shade  Uptore the shrouded tenant from its womb  And o'er the mangled corse relentless prey'd  XXXI  The paly stars with dim reluctant light  Like tapers glimmer'd on their orgies foul  While gliding spectres scream'd with wild affright  Reecho'd loud by their tremendous howl  XXXII  Ah what avail'd the solemnmoving herse  The sablemantled cars the fun'ral throng  Grav'd on his monument the soothing verse  The priests the torches and the choral song  XXXIII  Misjudging wretch while thou with hand profuse  Thy treasures on this mansion didst entail  And pour down riches on the vow'd recluse  Thine orphan babes partook a scanty meal  XXXIV  Thy widow'd fair her cheek bedew'd with tears  Approach'd with suppliant knee the cloistergate  There oft disclos'd in vain her poignant cares  Returning still to weep her hapless fate  YARICO to INKLE An EPISTLE  WITH falsehood lurking in thy sordid breast  And perj'ry's seal upon thy heart imprest  Dar'st thou Oh Christian brave the sounding waves  The treach'rous whirlwinds and untrophied graves  Regardless of my woes securely go  No cursefraught accents from these lips shall flow  My fondest wish shall catch thy flying sail  Attend thy course and urge the fav'ring gale  May ev'ry bliss thy God confers be thine  And all thy share of woe compris'd in mine  One humble boon is all I now implore  Allow these feet to print their kindred shore  Give me Oh Albion's son again

the Christians restless sons of pride  'By av'rice nurtur'd to deceit allied  'Who tread with cunning step the maze of art  'And mask with placid looks a canker'd heart  'Yet note superior to the num'rous throng  'Ev'n as the citron humbler plants among  'That youthLo beauty on his graceful brow  'With nameless charms bids ev'ry feature glow  'Ah leave fair stranger this unsocial ground

torches meet his impious brow  And drag him howling to the gulf below  Ah noMay heav'n's bright messengers descend  Obey his call his ev'ry wish attend  Still o'er his form their hov'ring wings display  If he be blest these pangs admit allay  Me still her mark let angry fortune deem  So thou may'st walk beneath her cloudless beam  Yet oft to my wrapt ear didst thou repeat  That I suffic'd to frame thy bliss compleat  For Love's pure flame I took thy transient fires  We fondly credit what the heart desires  I hop'd alas to breathe thy native air  And vie in splendor with the British fair  Ascend the speedy car enchas'd with gold  With robes of silk this pearldeck'd form infold  Bid on this jetty hand the diamond glow  And chosen rubies sparkle from my brow  Deluded sex the dupes of man decreed  We splendid victims at his altar bleed  The grateful accents of thy candy'd tongue  Where artful flatt'ry too persuasive hung  Like flow'rs adorn'd the path to my disgrace  And bade destruction wear a smiling face  Yet form'd by Nature in her choicest mould  While on thy cheek her blushing charms unfold  Who could oppose to thee stern Virtue's shield  What tender virgin would not wish to yield  But pleasure on the wings of time was born  And I expos'd a prey to grinning scorn  Of lowborn tradersmark the hand of fate  Is YARICO reduc'd to grace the state  Whose impious parents an advent'rous band  Imbru'd with guiltless blood my native land  Ev'n snatch'd my father from his regal seat  And stretch'd him breathless at their hostile feet  Illfated prince The Christians sought thy shore  Unsheath'd the sword and mercy was no more  But thou fair stranger cam'st with gentler mind  To shun the perils of the wrecking wind  Amidst thy foes thy safety still I plan'd  And reach'd for galling chains the myrtle band  Nor then unconscious of the secret fire  Each heart voluptuous throb'd with soft desire  Ah pleasing youth kind object of my care  Companion friend and ev'ry name that's dear  Say from thy mind canst thou so soon remove  The records pencil'd by the hand of love  How as we wanton'd on the flow'ry ground  The looserob'd Pleasures danc'd unblam'd around  Till to the sight the growing burden prov'd  How thou o'ercam'stand how alas I lov'd  Too fatal proof since thou with av'rice fraught  Didst basely urge ah shun the wounding thought  That tender circumstancereveal it not  Lest torn with rage I curse my fated lot  Lest startled Reason abdicate her reign  And Madness revel in this heated brain  That tender circumstanceinhuman part  I will not weep tho' serpents gnaw this heart  Frail frail resolve while gushing from mine eye  The pearly drops these boastful words belie  Alas can sorrow in this bosom sleep  Where strikes ingratitude her talons deep  When he I still adore to nature dead  For roses plants with thorns the nuptial bed  Bids from the widow'd couch kind Peace remove  And cold Indiff'rence blast the bow'r of Love  What time his guardian pow'r I most requir'd  Against my fame and happiness conspir'd  And do I live to breathe the barb'rous tale  His faithful YARICO expos'd to sale  Yes basely urg'd regardless of my pray'rs  Ev'n while I bath'd his venal hand with tears  What most for pity call'dI can no more  My future childto swell his impious store  All all mankind for this will rise thy foe  But I alas alone endure the woe  Alone endure the fest'ring hand of care  The bleeding soul and swoonings of despair  Was it for this I left my native plain  And dar'd the tempest brooding on the main  For this unlock'd seduc'd by Christian art  The chaste affections of my virgin heart  Within this bosom fan'd the constant flame  And fondly languish'd for a mother's name  Lo every hope is poison'd in its bloom  And horrors watch around this guilty womb  With blood illustrious circling thro' these veins  Which ne'er was chequer'd with plebeian stains  Thro' ancestry's long line ennobled springs  From famecrown'd warriors and exalted kings  Must I the shafts of infamy sustain  To slav'ry's purposes my infant train  To catch the glances of his haughty lord  Attend obedient at the festive board  From hands unscepter'd take the scornful blow  Uproot the thoughts of glory as they grow  Let this pervade at length thy heart of steel  Yet yet return nor blush Oh man to feel  Ah guide thy steps from yon expecting fleet  Thine injur'd YARICO relenting meet  Bid her recline woestricken on thy breast  And hush her raging sorrows into rest  Ah let the youth that sent the cruel dart  Extract the point invenom'd from her heart  The peace he banish'd from this mind recall  And bid the tears he prompted cease to fall  Then while the stream of life is giv'n to flow  And sable hue o'erspread this youthful brow  Or curl untaught by art this woolly hair  So long so long to me shalt thou be dear  Say lovely youth flow all my words in vain  Like seeds that strew the rude ungrateful plain  Say shall I ne'er regain thy wonted grace  Ne'er stretch these arms to catch the wish'd embrace  Enoughwith newawak'd resentment fraught  Assist me Heav'n to tear him from my thought  No longer vainly suppliant will I bow  And give to love what I to hatred owe  Forgetful of the race from whence I came  With woe acquainted but unknown to shame  Hence vile dejection with thy plaintive pray'r  Thy bended knee and still descending tear  Rejoin rejoin the palecomplexion'd train  The conflict's pastand I'm myself again  Thou parent sun if e'er with pious lay  I usher'd in thy worldreviving ray  Or as thy fainter beams illum'd the west  With grateful voice I hymn'd thee to thy rest  Beheld with wond'ring eye thy radiant seat  Or sought thy sacred dome with unclad feet  If near to thy bright altars as I drew  My votive lamb thy holy Flamen slew  Forgive that I irrev'rent of thy name  Dar'd for thy foe indulge th' unhallow'd flame  Ev'n on a Christian lavish'd my esteem  And scorn'd the sable children of thy beam  This poniard by my daring hand imprest  Shall drink the ruddy drops that warm my breast  Nor I alone by this immortal deed  From stav'ry's laws my infant shall be freed  And thou whose ear is deaf to pity's call  Behold at length thy destin'd victim fall  Behold thy oncelov'd Nubian stain'd with gore  Unwept extended on the crimson floor  These temples clouded with the shades of death  These lips unconscious of the ling'ring breath  These eyes uprais'd ere clos'd by Fate's decree  To catch expiring one faint glimpse of thee  Ah then thy YARICO forbear to dread  My fault'ring voice no longer will upbraid  Demand due vengeance of the pow'rs above  Or more offensive still implore thy love  IL LATTE An ELEGY  Incipe parve puer risu cognoscere matrem  I  YE fair
