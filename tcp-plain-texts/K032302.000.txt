 MARPLOT Or The Second Part of  The BUSIEBODY  A COMEDY As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL in  DruryLane  BY Her MAJESTY's Servants  Written by Mrs  SUSANNA CENTLIVRE    LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  at  Shakespear  's Head overagainst  Catherinestreet  in the  Strand    TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  HENRY BENTINCK  EARL of  Portland    Viscount  Woodstock  Baron of  Cirencester  Captain of Her Majesty's First Troop of Guards  c  My LORD  WOmen and Men like Women naturally fly to the Brave for Protection This Pretence  Marplot  and I have for Addressing to your LORDSHIP We know it is the peculiar Distinction of Noble Minds that they are ready to receive under their  Care the Distress'd though they have no other Merit than that they beseech their Patronage  When I say this my LORD I wou'd not be understood to conceal that my  Play  has been very kindly receiv'd but we Women overlook all Praise but from those Persons whose Approbation we most esteem We are apt to be carry'd away from Admirers to those we Admire And this  Comedy  prefers the Honour of being thrown at Your Feet to the Applause of an Audience It is the Misfortune of our Sex that we are deterr'd from the Advantages of a Learned Education But as our Expressions are Artless our Sentiments are less Disguis'd Had I my LORD the Skill of a Writer I shou'd here record your Noble Father's Zeal for his Royal Master and celebrate that Care and Fidelity which preserv'd the Life of Our Deliverer But instead of mentioning this Obligation which my late Lord  Portland  laid on every Man in  England  I confine my self to what we owe Him for being your Father  That Your LORDSHIP may long bless the World with the same Virtues which You have shown in the Entrance You have made on the busie Stage of it and long enjoy the Advantages of an Affluent Fortune Graceful Person and Generous Mind is the ardent Prayer of  My LORD  Your Lordship's most Devoted most Obedient Humble Servant SUSANNA CENTLIVRE  PROLOGUE  THE Men of Wit do now their Brains fatigue  So much with Politicks and StateIntrigue  That there's not one MalePoet of the Age  Will condescend to labour for the Stage  Therefore our Author tho' no  Rules  she knows  What Nature prompts with Artless Hand bestows  You'll see the  Subject  for the  Genius  fit  A  BusieBody  drawn by Female Wit  Still on the Hunt to know of others Wooing  Eternally employ'd and nothing doing  Into dear Secrets anxiously they press  Destroying even where they wish Success  The scanty Age all better Fare denies  And no new Characters the Town supplies  Some Years ago Wit had a larger Field  And every Room cou'd fresh StageCoxcombs yield  But long has been all Humorous Folly crost  All Fool in empty Politician's lost  Scowrers and Rakes and Debauchees are o'er  Beaux are extinct and Bullies are no more  Therefore in Scarcity of homebred Tools  Your Treat to Night's compos'd of Foreign Fools  And tho' our  Marplot  has been shown before  The Fool may differ on a different Shore  For once then break old Custom be not o'ernice  But let the  selfsame  Woman please you  Twice    Dramatis Personae  MEN  Don  Lopez  a Noble  Portuguese  Brother to Dona

in  Lisbon  Enter  Don Lopez  and  Don Perriera  Don Per  WHY Brother you are distracted how often have you fill'd my Brain with these Chymera's Why should I murder my Wife without a Cause  D Lop  A Cause Do's a Cuckold want a Cause  D Per  Look ye Senior keep that Word Cuckold between your Teeth till you can prove me such or by St  Anthony  you shall feel what Mettle my Spado is made of    Laying his Hand to his Sword  D Lop  Name your Spado again and I'll shake thee into Dust thou feeble Dotard Your Spado employ it against the Man that robs you of your Honour and not against him that would preserve it I say My Sister your Wife is a Strumpet the Strumpet of a damn'd Heretick I saw the Looks nay the Signs she gave some of the  English  Officers as she came from Church this Morning  D Per  English  Officers  D Lop  English  I'm sure they were I can't swear they were all Officers nor cou'd I perceive which she sign'd to or he shou'd not live to meet her WishesNow if you don't like the Name of Cuckold find another for the Husband of a Whore if you canFor my part I know of none but this I know if you won't punish her as a Wife I will as a Sister she shall not stain  the Honour of my House this way she injur'd it too much in marrying you I shall pursue my own Method and so Farewell    Going  D Per  So there's the Blessing of matching into an honourable Family Now must I bear all Affronts patiently because I'm but a Merchant forsoothOh give me any Curse but thisPray Senior give me leave to speak one Word with you I am convinc'd of my too much Indulgence for this very Cockatrice and there remains nothing to quicken my Revenge but certain Demonstration  D Lop  Certain Demonstration Must you have Ocular Proof Must your Coward Heart be animated with the Sight A Curse of your Equivocations  D Per  No any other Sense will serve let me hear 'em feel 'em nay smell 'em and sure Cuckoldom is so rank a Scent that tho' I liv'd in  England  where they scarce breathe any other Air I cou'd distinguish it  D Lop  Now you talk like a  Portuguese  keep up this Passion and secure the Honour of your House and mine and deserve the Alliance of my Blood it shall be my Care to fix them    Exit  D Per  And when they are so mine to execute    Exit  Enter  Charles  meeting Colonel  Ravelin  Cha  Colonel  Ravelin  Rav  Charles Gripe  honest  Charles  how dost thou do Boy Why what brought thee to  Lisbon  Cha  Part of the Cause that brought you Colonel  Rav  What art thou in the Army  Cha  No Colonel I leave Honour to you Interest brought me  Rav  They are TwinBrothers  Charles  if Interest did not drive Honour wou'd come slowly on Art thou turn'd Merchant then  Cha  No faith not I but it pleas'd Heav'n to take my Wife's Father out of the way who left me Executor and his Concerns here oblig'd me to take this Voyage  Rav  So then old Sir jealous Traffick is dead at last How long do you intend to stay  Cha  Longer than I expected when I embark'd I came away in such a Hurry the Ship sailing sooner than I thought she  wou'd I forgot to put up some Papers without which I can't adjust my Accounts with some Merchants here I have writ to my Wife to send them  Rav  That was very unlucky prithee how dost thou spend thy Time  Cha  Why very insipidly How do you pass yours What Company have you here  Rav  All sorts the Women I'll say that for 'em are kind enough and won't put you to the Expence of Swearing and Lying to gain them but a Man is as safe in an Engagement as in their Arms Fortune is the kind Friend in both the Onsets But I have got acquainted in a  French  Family which are not altogether so dangerous one way but much more so another  Cha  Ay how's that Colonel  Rav  Why I'm fearful of dwindling into an honourable Amour there  Cha  Exert your Gallantry gain your Point once and those Fears will vanish The  French  Ladies are easie of Access  Rav  Right the  French  Gayety resembles the  English  Complaisance yet they have always a Reserve to dash your Expectations and when you think your self in a manner Master of their Cover'dway they spring a Mine of Coquetry and blow you up at once  Cha  Say you so Colonel Why then give me the  Lisbon  Dames that surrender to the Bold and Brave He deserves not a Woman that would not run some Hazard provided she be kind  Rav  Some are of Opinion that the jilting Fair gives the surest Blow and  Sucklin  says  'Tis Expectation makes the Blessing dear  This  French  Woman has found the way to unite my jarring Inclinations and tune 'em to the pitch of Constancy and I am very apprehensive of becoming that tame Monster call'd a Husband Ah I find I am caught for I can name that terrible Word without starting  Cha  Ha ha ha I shall have you in my Class Sure the Lady that can make such an entire Conquest over your Heart must be a Person of extraordinary Parts Colonel  Rav  Yes faith her Ladyship has very extraordinary Parts she's airy to Affectation and changeable as the Wind She has  Tongue enough for a Lawyer but as hard to be understood as an Apothecary She begins as many Stories as a Romance and ends them as intricately or to speak more properly seldom ends them at all She's as whimsical as a Projector as obstinate as a Physician and as faithful as the Monarch of her Country  Cha  Admirable Qualities for a Wife and can you forsake the whole Sex for this Woman  Rav  Humph that I won't swear but I find I can't forsake her for the whole Sex To be plain with you I have try'd the Strength of Variety and at this time am in prospect of the Favour from as fine a Woman as any in  Lisbon  yet this Medly of Womankind triumphs over all and in the midst of my Raptures I murmur  Joneton    Cha  But may I not see this wondrous Engineer who can countermine her whole Sex and blow up the Magazine of your Affections Colonel  Rav  You shall but you must give me your Honour not to rival me  Cha  The Description you have given Colonel secures you from that Fear besides you know I am marry'd neither am I destitute of a Mistress tho' in a strange Place I this Morning was a assur'd by a Sign from a Lady's Hankerchief that my Wants shou'd be supply'd upon Occasion I did not rightly understand her till the good old  Duena  explain'd her Meaning and this Night I shall be happy in her Arms  Rav  You are a Stranger to these Affairs  Charles  take heed proceed with caution for the Women here are as warm in their Revenge as in their Inclinations bare Suspicion justifies Murder if you manage your Intreague so closely to escape the Husband and Relations 'tis odds but your Mistress finds some pretence to employ her Bravoes Fellows that will dispatch a dozen Men for a  Moydre    Cha  I go well arm'd understand the Language and will not easily fall a Victime but resolve to see the event of this Intreague the old Matron told me that the Lady was young and beautiful her Husband a Merchant rich covetous old and ugly that she hated him worse than Penance and lov'd me better than her Prayers shall I be such a Poultroon to decline a Lady's Summons No for the honour of  Britain  it shall never be said an  Englishman  fled either from the Wars of  Mars  or  Venus  let her bring me on if I discharge not my self with Honour and make my Retreat secure may I forfeit the Embraces of the Sex  Rav    Well said  Charles  in my Conscience you married Men encroach too much upon our Prerogative methinks you who purchase pleasure by way of Annuity should leave us Batchellours the liberty of the Freehold  Cha    The Ground we course in is never the worse for your Use  Rav    No 'tis sometimes the better there's many a Wife lies Fallow and many a good Estate wou'd want an Heir if it were not for us young Fellows especially Soldiers  Cha    I think you ought to make Provision for the Recruits you raise as much as for your Widows they are far more Numerous    A noise of clashing of Swords and Murder cry'd within    Rav    Ha What noise is that  Cha    'Tis  Marplot  's Voice his damn'd Curiosity has brought him into some Mischief I'll lay my Life on't    Draws    Rav    The Devil's in that Fellow what made you bring him with you    Murder cry'd again within    Mar    Murder murder  Mar  running pursued by two Bravoes    Ah  Charles  help me dear  Charles  for Heav'ns sake    They beat off the Bravoes    Cha    A Curse on your Paper Skull what have you been doing now  Mar    Nothing at all as I hope to be saved only I had a mind to see where that Lady liv'd that shook her Handkerchief at you and out of no other design than to inform you I protest  Charles  when immediately these two Scoundrels came slap upon me I know no more for what than the Child that's unborn but I'm sure I shall feel their blows this Month pox take 'em  Rav    For what Why you took the only method in the World to have your Guts let out Ha ha watch a Woman in  Lisbon  Hark you young Gentleman suppress that natural Curiosity of diving into other Peoples Affairs or never hope to see old  England  again  Mar    I wish I were safe in it Colonel  Ravelin  The duce take me if I saw you before my Senses was all in such a hurry with these unconscionable Villains that  Cha  That you overlook'd your Friends I warrant  Mar  You have said it  Charles  but I hope the Colonel will forgive me  Rav  To be plain with you Mr  Marplot  I shall take these kind of Oversights for particular Favours if you don't shake off that Temper of yours  Mar  Pish prethee Colonel don't put on those grave Airs why what harm is there in't  Rav  There's ill Manners in't I'm sure and have a care you han't your Bones broke for it  Cha  Look ye  Marplot  you must either resolve to quit this inquisitive Humour or forfeit my Acquaintance  Rav  A Man may be ruin'd by your foolish Quarrels  Mar  Upon my Soul Colonel I never quarrel'd with any Man out of design to hurt him in my Life  Charles  can witness for me that I hate fighting  Cha  So can every Body else that knows you I wish you hated Impertinence as much for the good of Society  Mar  Well you of all Men living have the least reason to complain I have run the hazard of my Life many a time for you and in my Conscience I believe I shall fall your Martyr one time or another  Cha  Your own you mean you'll certainly be Canoniz'd by all the Busiebody's about Town  Mar  Is this all the thanks I get for my Friendship Well  Charles  well you shall see I can prefer Safety and sacrifice my Curiosity too as you call it  Rav  That's the way to oblige your Friends Mr  Marplot  never desire to know more than they are willing to tell you readily comply with a reasonable Demand and never meddle with any body's Business but your own this will render you agreeable to all Companies  Mar  Ay But that will make all Companies very disagreeable to me    Aside    But Colonel is there nothing due from one Friend to another One ought to be let into the bosom Secrets of a Friend  Rav  Not always for there are some Secrets of such a Nature that will not admit of that Freedom for Example suppose your Friend had an Affair with another Man's Wife or Daughter where's the advantage of your knowing it  Mar  Why I wou'd watch the Husband or Father in the mean time prevent his being surpriz'd and perhaps save his Life  Cha  But how wou'd you save his Honour A Man of Honour must have no Confidents in those Cases  Mar  Then hang Honour I say 'tis good for nothing but to spoil Conversation Shall I beg a pinch of your Snuff Colonel  Enter Colonel  Ravelin's  Servant with a Letter    Rav  With all my Heart    Gives him his Box  Ser  The Messenger stays for your Answer Sir  Mar  A Letter Wou'd I were a Fly now that I might swop down upon the Paper and read it before his Face Lord Lord what wou'd I give for an universal Knowledge    Aside  Rav  Tell the Messenger I'll observe Orders to a second  Mar  Orders Why what have you Orders to march Colonel    Ex Servant  Rav  From this place I have Sir  Charles  I'd be glad to drink a Bottle with you and Mr  Marplot  in the Evening at my Lodgings There's the Directions    Tears the Superscription of a Letter and gives  Charles  Mar  I'll wait on you home Colonel that I may know the House again exactly  Rav  Excuse me Sir I'm not going home perhaps  Charles  I'll expect you    Exit  Cha  I'll do my self the honour to wait on you adieu    Exit  Mar  Perhaps but perhaps I won't believe you He has a world of Manners to a Gentleman in a strange Place I'll be sworn ha  Charles  's gone nay then I have a rare opportunity egad he has forgot his SnuffBox an excellent Excuse to follow him the Devil take his Letter for me it has given me the Cholick    Exit  SCENE  A Chamber in  Don Perriera's  House  Enter  Dona Perriera  and  Margaritta  Dona Per  Are you sure the  Englishman  will come What said he  Marg  He  swer'd me in Transport I warrant him a Man every inch of him Come Seniora Yes yes he'll come tho' a thousand Dangers threatned him these  Englishmen  are brave Fellows if they were not Hereticks  Dona Per  If he has but the Faith of a Lover no matter for his Religion  Margaritta  but what came of the busie Fellow that watch'd us Did you obey my Orders  Marg  Yes marry did I and the Bravo's assur'd me they had taught him to look another way for the future  Dona Per  They dispatch'd him I hope  Marg  No he was rescu'd upon the  Terriera de Passa    Dona Per  Ill Fate he did not see where I enter'd  Marg  No no Madam you are safe hush here's my Master  Don Perriera    Dona Per  Then there's my Jaylor This  Englishman  runs in

Ambuscade for the whole Artillery of his Senses are drawn down upon you and Jealousie leads the Force of his Invention and though I love you Wife yet if his Spies bring certain Intellige  ce of your holding Correspondence with those Heretick Dogs the  English  Officers I shall infallibly treat you like a Traitress to your Lord and Husband  Dona Per  Ha I fear I'm betray'd    Aside  Marg  My Lady a Traitress to her Lord and Husband  Don Lopez  is a Traitor to his own Flesh and Blood for saying so by my Virginity  Don Per  Away away that's so stale an Oath 'twill not be credited  Dona Per  The Accusation's false I do not know one  English  Officer in  Lisbon  by this sacred Sign    crosses her Thumb and Finger and kisses it    For my  Duena  assures me my Lover is no  Officer so far I'm not forsworn    Aside    I thought my Dear had promis'd me never more to mind the Insinuations of that cruel Brother his Prejudice is founded on our Marriage his proud imperious Temper scorns your Alliance and racks his Soul to find a Cause to ruin you And must it be by blasting of my Fame Will not my Life suffice And dares he not employ his own Hand But wou'd he make you guilty of my Murther oh barbarous inhumane Thought    Weeps  Marg  Cruel  Don Lopez  now do I wish I may die a Maid a terrible Wish were I not out of Danger of the Curse falling upon me if I believe my Lady ever thought of any Man but your self Senior Poor Creature I'm sure her Heart is full of Fears about you when you are absent  Don Per  Ay lest I shou'd come back before she'd have me  Marg  He is the Devil of a Guesser    Aside  Dona Per  Unkindly urg'd Deary I'm sure by my own Consent I wou'd never have you  Don Per  In your Sight  Marg  The Man is certainly a Witch    Aside  Dona Per  Out of my sight I meant Deary  Don Per  That wou'd be as bad on the other side  Dona Per  For my part Deary I'm never happier than when thou art in my Arms and cou'd be content to have thee always there  Don Per  Yes I

Danger of your Health  Marg  Nay if Diseases are prevented by dry Meats he's in the right on't    Aside  Dona Per  I know not what you'd have me say my Dear but if you think me false confine me to my Chamber or send me to a Monastery Grant Heav'n he do's not take me at my Word    Aside  Marg  I wou'd not give a Crusada for my Place if he shou'd a cloyster'd Mistress brings no Grise to the Servant's Mill    Aside  Don Per  Sure  Don Lopez  do's belye her I always found her thus pliable kind and modest however I'll watch her narrowly In the mean time to take off her Suspicion I'll seem to believe her  Marg  So all's right once more I see by that Ogle of his    Aside  Don Per  Come my Love dry thy Eyes I am not jealous nor shall thy Brother make me so I'll be an  Englishman  to thee Come buss thy own Husband then do Deary  Marg  That Buss secures me a  Moydre  before I sleep for the  English  are the most generous Men living in their Love Affairs    Aside  Dona Per  And won't you

  Exit  Cha  Prethee doSo I am enter'd but how I shall come off I am not able to determine If instead of a Lady there shou'd come an old surly Dog with half a dozen Bravoes at his back it would give a strange turn to my Inclinations how foolishly a Man must look upon such an Occasion egad suppose some Body should be doing me the same favour in  England  now with my Wife cou'd I be angry No faith if

Yes in a Female Hand those Limbs were made for softer Uses and we  Britains  are not wont to see our Ladies arm'd with Steel Loves Combats are fought with Kisses in my Country I know not what his Laws are here  Dona Per  The Engagements are the same only a little difference in the Preparation a Wound in the Reputation of an  English  Woman they say only lets in Allimony but with us it lets out Life

ever liv'd which way got he down the Chimney  Cha  Nay that's past my finding out as also what's become of him I cou'd have cut his Throat with all my Soul just then and yet I can't help being concern'd for him now I fear he is kill'd  Rav  I shou'd be sorry for that tho' in my Conscience he deserves it this busie humour of his is as natural to him as his Food he follow'd me home this Morning I was forc'd to use him very roughly to get rid of him for you must know I have a trap Door in my Chimney thro' which I descend into a back Street where I am conducted by an old Negro to an Angel of a Woman I had her Summons and the hour of Assignation was come when he enter'd my Chamber  Cha  A very unseasonable Visit faith Colonel  Rav  Ay was it not but I quickly dispatch'd him tho' how he stumbl'd upon you afterwards and in so odd a manner is a miracle  Cha  If he lives we shall know when next we meet I never catch'd him in a lye which is the best Qualification he has But Colonel did not you promise to introduce me to your  French  Mistress What this Lady  incog  has not beat her out by the by has she Colonel  Rav  No no she maintains her Ground too well there's more danger of my raising the Siege than her beating the Chamade she has so many retreats of Pride Vanity and Affectation that without some lucky Accident toss a Granade into the Magazine of her Inclination there'll be no hopes of the Town  Cha  Storm then Colonel storm  Rav  I rather chuse to block her up and starve her out suffer no Admirer to enter and if once a Woman of her temper want the Provision of Vanity she surrenders of course  Cha  An admirable Stratagem but prithee let me see her before you put it in practice  Rav  It shall be now if you please  Charles    Cha  With all my Heart Is it far  Rav  At that House yonder  Cha  Lead the way then    Exeunt  Enter  Marplot  Mar  Lead the waywhere the Devil are they going now can't I help having a violent desire to follow them tho' I scap'd so narrowly in my last Project Yonder they go ha they are enter'd already that is no publick House I'm sure Egad may be it is some private Bourdell or what business can both of 'em have at one House Well  Charles  tho' you was so barbarous to desert me in my Afflictions I won't serve you so I'll not stir from this place 'till I see you safe outOd upon second thoughts I'll knock at the Door and ask for him perhaps three may be as welcome as two    As he is going to knock enter  Isabinda  in Boys Cloaths    Isab  Ha  Marplot  here this is lucky    Aside    Mr  Marplot  fortunately met  Mar  That's more than I can tell yet for I don't know you Sir  Isab  Nor wou'd I have you    Aside    But you know those that do can you tell me where Mr  Charles Gripe  is to be found  Mar  Ha my Mind misgives me plaguily that this is an Envoy from the old Man's Wife pray Heav'n he has never a Summons from my old Matron too for tho' I comply'd with all she ask'd to purchase my Liberty I am sure I shall have no Stomach to perform Articles    Aside  Isab  Don't you hear me Sir  Mar  Yes yes Sir I hear youWhat the duce shall I say to him he must not know that  Charles  is gone into yon House for Women here they say are cursed Jealous and that may be a means to have his Throat cut    Aside  Isab  Why don't you answer where does he Lodge  Mar  Where does he Lodgethis must be some new Intreague for doubtless t'other knows his Lodgings Look ye Sir one good turn deserves another let me know what business you have with him and accordingly as I like it your Question shall be answered  Isab  Marplot  still I find he's no changling    Aside    Why then Sir if you must know I have a Letter for him from a Lady who is desperately in love with him  Mar  So here's another Intreague popt into my Mouth In Love with him prithee dear Youth who is she where does she live What's her Name Is she Maid Wife or Widow Young or Old Black Brown or Fair Short or Tall Fat or Lean this Country or a Foreigner quick quick quick my dear little Rogue let me into the secret and I'll carry thee to his Lodgings immediatelyEgad this Discovery will make my peace with  Charles  compleatly  Isab  I can only answer him these questions Sir I am no Blab you must excuse me if I'm silent  Mar  So must you me Sir I'm no Blab neither Sir if you go to that I'd have you to believe I can keep my Friend's secrets when intrusted I don't know his Lodgings find them out as you can  Isab  You are very short Sir I have nothing to say against your secrecy but it wou'd be Impudence in me to run the hazard besides forestalling your Friend's Generosity he ought to have the disposal of his own secrets  Mar  Ay if it comes into his Hands once 'twill cost me more pains to find out than 'tis worth  Isab  Pains to find out I hope you never endeavour to find out what other People wou'd conceal  Mar  No yes to chuse why the duce shou'd any Man know more than my self We came into the World alike and I can see no occasion for his superior knowledge  Isab  I admire you are not for levelling Estates too how can you bear any Man to be richer than your self  Mar  Oh with ease my Wealth lies in my Mind I had rather fathom the depth of a Man's Thoughts than his Pockets yet to show you I can suppress my Curiosity let me read the Letter and I'll excuse the rest  Isab  It is as much as my Life's worth to open the Letter  Mar  Pox take his Lifetell me what's in't then or may I be carbonaded if you know his Lodgings I'd give a Finger to have this Intreague rightly    Aside  Isab  I must not let this Fellow know me if I intend to conceal my being in  Lisbon  I'll humour him a little and try what  discovery I can make    Aside    Well Sir if you'll promise to be secret I'll let you into this Affair  Mar  Secret as a Priest ChildEgad I shall have it pray Heav'n  Charles  does not come out before he has done if he shou'd I should be undone    Aside  Isab  Why then the Lady I belong to is a rich Merchant's Daughter near the Convent of  Santo Vincente  her Name is  Dona Cephisa  she saw your Friend at Church is extremely charm'd with him and resolves to marry him  Mar  Marry him ha ha ha ha poor Lady why now to return secret for your secret he's Married already but perhaps he may prick her down amongst the rest of his Mistresses You understand me  Isab  Too wellthe rest of his Mistresses has he such store then  Mar  As many as he can well manage I believe  Isab  Oh my Heart the danger of intreaguing in this place alarms my fears and shocks my very Soul  Mar  What I have said makes you thoughtful I perceive will no Body do but  Charles  What think you of me  Isab  Why really Sir were I a Woman I shou'd prefer you before him but I can't answer for my Lady if you please I'll mention you  Mar  Your most humble Servant SirEgad there may be new pleasure in having an Intreague of ones own for ought I know for I never had one in my Life    Aside  Isab  But Sir there is one Article in our Agreement which you have not perform'd  Mar  What's that  Isab  Where your Friend lodges  Mar  Why he lodges at yon green Windows where if you have any Service from your Lady for your humble Servant you'll find me there also  Isab  Sir I kiss your Hand I'll do my best to serve you    Ex  Mar  Sir I kiss yoursI'm glad he's gone before  Charles  came out this is a Nonsensical Secret tho' methinks I had rather know what the Colonel and he is doing in yon HouseShall I knock at the Door or not If I shou'd ten to one but I do Mischiefand shall be beaten again To prevent which I'll wait  within sight for their coming out so when they are pass'd by I may with more Security make my Enquiry  SCENE  Changes to Mademoisel  Joneton  's Lodgings  She drest
