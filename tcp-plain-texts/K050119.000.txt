 THE WAY TO GET MARRIED  A COMEDY  IN FIVE ACTS  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  By THOMAS MORTON Esquire  AUTHOR OF  MBUSZORINSKICHILDREN IN THE WOOD  LONDON  OR T N LONGMAN PATERNOSTERROW      PRICE TWO SHILLINGS    PROLOGUE  Written by  W T FITZGERALD  Esquire  Spoken by Mr  M'CREADY  THE stage should be to life a faithful glass  Reflecting modes and manners as they pass  If these extravagant appear to you  Blame not the dramathe reflection's true  Our Author makes of virtue no parade  And only ridicules the  vice  of trade  Exposes Folly in its native tint  And leaves mankind to profit by the hint  The modern buckhow diff'rent from the beau  In bag and ruffles sixty years ago  The city coxcomb then was seldom seen  Consin'd to Bunhillrow or Bethnalgreen  West of Cheapside you then could scarcely meet  The gay Lotharioof Threadneedlestreet  His folly rarely met the public eye  Or like a shadow pass'd unheeded by  Tradesman and rake were then remov'd as far  As gay St James's is from Templebar  But now the cit must breathe a purer air  The 'Change he  visits  lives in Badfordsquare  Insures a fleetthen Bootle's club attends  Proud to be notic'd by his titled friends  And tries to join by Dissipation's aid  The man of fashion with the man of trade  Vain to associate with superior rank  He quits his  ledger  for the Faro bank  His dashing curricle down Bondstreet drives  Risking his  own  and worsehis horses' lives  Till urging Fortune's glowing wheel too fast  This empty airblown bubble breaks at last  Tho' trade may give such upstart mushrooms birth  The Muse pays homage to its real worth  This isle to commerce owes her splendid state  The source of all that makes her truly great  And 'midst her busy sons enough are found  To raise dejected mis'ry from the ground  While commerce with a lib'ral heart bestows  Her wealth to mitigate the poor man's woes  Seeks out the wretch his gloomy prison cheers  And wipes with pitying hand the widow's tears  The applauding world will say such bounty giv'n  The English merchant is the steward of heav'n  Our Author now that candour would implore  Which your indulgence has bestow'd before  Still on a gen'rous Public he depends  Give your supporthe asks no better friends  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  TANGENT  Mr Lewis  TOBY ALLSPICE  Mr Quick  CAPTAIN FAULKNER  Mr Pope  CAUSTIC  Mr Munden

as are content say "Aye" Not content "No"The contents have it  Exit  Caust  So mad and absurd as ever But I trust he has a good heart and I'll give him fair play for sometimes the subsiding opposition of worth and folly produces the brightest characters even as the beautiful firmament is said to have been formed from the contending chaos of light and darkness  Exit  SCENE II FAULKNER'S HOUSE  A

battalion of the black badgers will open upon you and tell you that libelling an attorney strikes at the root of humanity it  tears out the vitals existence it shivers the adamantine bands of society

convert  Caust  She has indeedand I beg pardon of her sex to whom she this given this lessonthat the affection and duty of a daughter is the best security for happiness in a wife and that filial

OF THE COMEDY  EPILOGUE  Written by Captain  TOPHAM  Spoken by Mrs  MATTOCKS  THE dubious title of our Play this night  Might fill mama with joy or miss with fright  "The Way to get a Husband" and what not  But are they worth the getting when they're got  "Yes" cries bold misswhom mother's kind rega  Has led at young fourteen to cock her card  "Yes" cries bold miss "whate'er the formals say  They are worth getting and I know the way  The way's up Bondstreet where we daily range  Where sauntering bloods crowd Fashion's full exchange  There charming scene as undismay'd we strut  Dogs misses dukes and draymen meet full butt  There lounging arm in arm halfbooted crops  With heads so dark you'd swear they wereblack mops  There muslin petticoats with mud so lac'd▪  Here scarlet spencers with an inch of waist  So scarlet all my rouge they seem to scoff  And look like lobsters with their tails cut off  Here for a husband is the scene to dash  Here for a townbred miss tomake a splash  The plump brisk widow takes a different road  She cannot walk down Bondstreetshe's a load  Good sixteen stone to carrybut yet strong  She rolls a woolpack Venusbroad as long  Yet she's a tender passion for the stage  With her dear  private acting  is the rage  Shakspeare
