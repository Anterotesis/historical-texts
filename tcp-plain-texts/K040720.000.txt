 LONDON OR THE PROGRESS OF COMMERCE A POEM By Mr GLOVER THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed for T COOPER at the Globe in PaternosterRow MDCCXXXIX Price One Shilling  The ARGUMENT  The following poem represents Commerce as the child of Neptune and born on the coast of Libya in an island celebrated in fabulous antiquity for its fruitfulness and plenty during the first uncultivated ages whence the new divinity is supposed to convey these blessings round the world Her birth is attended by many of the Gods who endow her with their several gifts among the rest Apollo appoints her to be the inventress of letters Sir Isaac Newton's opinion being here alluded to that merchandize gave rise to this wonderful discovery Commerce is then described as making her first appearance to the world among the Phoenicians the earliest people who exercis'd an extensive trade From thence she proceeds to visit other parts of the globe and endeavours to erect her principal empire at Carthage situated in Libya the country assign'd for her nativity Upon the destruction of that city she again removes from place to place but at length allured by the vigour and singular resolution of the Dutch in throwing off the Spanish yoke she takes up her residence with that indefatigable people Lastly by the good laws which have been made from time to time for the encouragement of trade among us especially by the act of navigation which has transferred a great part of the Dutch traffick to ourselves she is suppos'd on our invitation to choose England for her chief abode more particularly London our principal emporium as well as capital  city And upon this occasion an enquiry is made how it has come to pass that notwithstanding the great wealth and power attending Commerce the course of trade should so often have shifted its seat and the means conceived most effectual to fix this wanderer here are pointed out  LONDON OR The Progress of Commerce  YE northern blasts and  The east wind  Eurus wont to sweep  With rudest pinions o'er the furrow'd waves  Awhile suspend your violence and waft  From sandy  Bremen is situated on the Weser and Hamburgh on the Elb  Weser and the broadmouth'd Elb  My freighted vessels to the destin'd shore  Safe o'er th' unruffled main let ev'ry thought  Which may disquiet and alarm my breast  Be absent now that dispossess'd of care  And free from every tumult of the mind  With each disturbing passion hush'd to peace  I may pour all my spirit on the theme  Which opens now before me and demands  The loftiest strain The eagle when he tow'rs  Beyond the clouds the fleecy robes of heav'n  Disdains all objects but the golden sun  Full on th' effulgent orb directs his eye  And sails exulting through the blaze of day  So while her wing attempts the boldest flight  Rejecting each inferior theme of praise  Thee ornament of Europe Albion's pride  Fair seat of wealth and freedom thee my Muse  Shall celebrate O LONDON thee she hails  Thou lov'd abode of Commerce last retreat  Whence she contemplates with a tranquil mind  Her various wandrings from the fated hour  That she abandon'd her maternal clime  Neptunian Commerce whom Phoenicé bore  Illustrious nymph that nam'd the fertile plains  Along the sounding main extended far  Which flow'ry Carmel with its sweets perfumes  And with its cedars Libanus o'ershades  Her from the bottom of the watry world  As once she stood in radiant beauties grac'd  To mark the heaving tide the piercing eye  Of Neptune view'd enamour'd from the deep  The God ascending rushes to the beach  And clasps th' affrighted virgin From that day  Soon as the paly regent of the night  Nine times her monthly progress had renew'd  Through heav'n's illumin'd vault Phoenicé led  By shame once more the seaworn margin sought  There pac'd with painful steps the barren sands  A solitary mourner and the surge  Which gently roll'd beside her now no more  With placid eyes beholding thus exclaim'd  YE fragrant shrubs and cedars' lofty shade  Which crown my native hills ye spreading palms  That rise majestic on these fruitful meads  With you who gave the lost Phoenicé birth  And you who bear th' endearing name of friends  Once faithful partners of my chaster hours  Farewel To thee perfidious God I come  Bent down with pain and anguish on thy sands  I come thy suppliant death is all I crave  Bid thy devouring waves inwrap my head  And to the bottom whelm my cares and shame  SHE ceas'd when sudden from th' unclosing deep  A crystal car emerg'd with glitt'ring shells  Call'd from their oozy beds by Tethys' train  And blushing coral deck'd whose ruddy glow  Mix'd with the watry lustre of the pearl  A smiling band of seaborn nymphs attend  Who from the shore with gentle hands convey  The fearsubdu'd Phoenicé and along  The lucid chariot place As there with dread  All mute and struggling with her painful throes  She lay the winds by Neptune's high command  Were silent round her not a Zephyr dar'd  To wanton o'er the cedar's branching top  Nor on the plain the stately palm was seen  To wave its graceful verdure o'er the main  No undulation broke the smooth expanse  But all was hush'd and motionless around  All but the lightlysliding car impell'd  Along the level azure by the strength  Of active Tritons rivalling in speed  The rapid meteor whose sulphureous train  Glides o'er the brow of darkness and appears  The livid ruins of a falling star  BENEATH the Lybian skies a blissful isle  By  Triton a river and lake of ancient Lybia  Triton's floods encircled Nysa lay  Here youthful Nature wanton'd in delights  And here the guardians of the bounteous horn  While it was now the infancy of time  Nor yet th' uncultivated globe had learn'd  To smile  Fruitfulness  Eucarpé  Plenty  Dapsiléa dwelt  With all the nymphs whose secret care had nurs'd  The eldest Bacchus From the flow'ry shore  A turfclad valley opens and along  Its verdure mild the willing feet allures  While on its sloping sides ascends the pride  Of hoary groves higharching o'er the vale  With dayrejecting gloom The solemn shade  Half round a spacious lawn at length expands  This whole description of the rock and grotto is taken from Diod Siculus lib pag  Clos'd by a tow'ring cliff whose forehead glows  With azure purple and ten thousand dyes  From its resplendent fragments beaming round  Nor less irradiate colours from beneath  On ev'ry side an ample grot reflects  As down the perforated rock the sun  Pours his meridian blaze rever'd abode  Of Nysa's nymphs with ev'ry plant attir'd  That wears undying green refresh'd with rills  From everliving fountains and enrich'd  With all Pomona's bloom unfading flow'rs  Glow on the mead and spicy shrubs perfume  With inexhausted sweets the cooling gale  Which breathes incessant there while ev'ry bird  Of tuneful note his gay or plaintive song  Blends with the warble of meandring streams  Which o'er their pebbled channels murm'ring lave  The fruitinvested hills that rise around  The gentle Nereids to this calm recess  Phoenicé bear nor Dapsiléa bland  Nor good Eucarpé studious to obey  Great Neptune's will their hospitable care  Refuse nor long Lucina is invok'd  Soon as the wondrous infant sprung to day  Earth rock'd around with all their nodding woods  And streams reverting to their troubled source  The mountains shook while Lybia's neighb'ring God  Mysterious Ammon from his hollow cell  With deepresounding accent thus to heav'n  To earth and sea the mighty birth proclaim'd  A NEWBORN pow'r behold whom fate hath call'd  The Gods' imperfect labour to complete  This wide creation She in lonely sands  Shall bid the tow'rencircled city rise  The barren sea shall people and the wilds  Of dreary nature shall with plenty cloath  She shall enlighten man's unletter'd race  And with endearing intercourse unite  Remotest nations scorch'd by sultry suns  Or freezing near the snowencrusted pole  Where'er the joyous vine disdains to grow  The fruitful olive or the golden ear  Her hand divine with interposing aid  To ev'ry climate shall the gifts supply  Of Ceres Bacchus and  Minerva the tutelary Goddess of the Athenians to whom she gave the olive  th'Athenian maid  The graces joys emoluments of life  From her exhaustless bounty all shall flow  THE heav'nly prophet ceas'd Olympus

Majestic Phoebus o'er the infant long  In contemplation pausing thus declar'd  From his enraptur'd lip his matchless boon  THEE with divine invention I endow  That secret wonder goddess to disclose  By which the wise the virtuous and the brave  The heav'ntaught poet and exploring sage  Shall pass recorded to the verge of time  HER years of childhood now were number'd o'er  When to her mother's natal soil repair'd  The new divinity whose parting step  Her sacred nurses follow'd ever now  To her alone inseparably join'd  Then first deserting their Nyseïan Shore  To spread their hoarded blessings round the world  Who with them bore the inexhausted horn  Of eversmiling plenty Thus adorn'd  Attended thus great Goddess thou beganst  Thy allenlivening progress o'er the globe  Then rude and joyless destin'd to repair  The various ills which earliest ages ru'd  From one like thee distinguish'd by the gifts  Of heav'n Pandora whose pernicious hand  From the dire vase releas'd th' imprison'd woes  THOU gracious Commerce from his cheerless caves  In horrid rocks and solitary woods  The helpless wand'rer man forlorn and wild  Didst charm to sweet society didst cast  The deep foundations where the future pride  Of mightiest cities rose and o'er the main  Before the wond'ring Nereids didst present  The surgedividing keel and stately mast  Whose canvass wings distending with the gale  The bold Phoenician through Alcides' straits  To northern Albion's tinembowel'd fields  And oft beneath the seaobscuring brow  Of cloudenvelop'd Teneriff convey'd  Next in sagacious thought th' ethereal plains  Thou trodst exploring each propitious star  The dangerbraving mariner to guide  Then all the latent and mysterious pow'rs  Of number didst unravel last to crown  Thy bounties Goddess thy unrival'd toils  For man still urging thy inventive mind  Thou gav'st him  Here the opinion of Sir Isaac Newton is follow'd that letters were first invented amongst the trading parts of the world  letters there imparting all  Which lifts th' ennobled spirit near to heav'n  Laws learning wisdom nature's works reveal'd  By godlike sages all Minerva's arts  Apollo's music and th' eternal voice  Of Virtue sounding from th' historic roll  The philosophic page and poet's song  NOW solitude and silence from the shores  Retreat on pathless mountains to reside  Barbarity is polish'd infant arts  Bloom in the desart and benignant peace  With hospitality begin to sooth  Unsocial rapine and the thirst of blood  As from his tumid urn when Nilus spreads  His genial tides abroad the favour'd soil  That joins his fruitful border first imbibes  The kindly stream anon the bounteous God  His waves extends embracing Aegypt round  Dwells on the teeming champain and endows  The sleeping grain with vigour to attire  In one bright harvest all the Pharian plains  Thus when Pygmalion from Phoenician Tyre  Had banish'd freedom with disdainful steps  Indignant Commerce turning from the walls  Herself had rais'd her welcome sway enlarg'd  Among the nations spreading round the globe  The fruits of all its climes  Athenian Athens was call'd Cecropia from Cecrops its first king

Another name of Sicily which was frequently ravag'd by the Carthaginians  Trinacria wasted all the pow'rs  Of conquer'd Afric's tributary realms  To six thy empire on the Lybian verge  Thy native

lasting seat in vain th' imperial port  Receives the gather'd riches of the world  In vain whole climates bow beneath its rule  Behold the toil of centuries to Rome  Its glories yields and mould'ring leaves no trace  Of its deeprooted greatness thou with tears  From thy extinguish'd Carthage didst retire  And these thy perish'd honours long deplore  What though rich  Cadiz  Gades what though polish'd Rhodes  With Alexandria Aegypt's splendid mart  The learn'd  Marseilles a Grecian colony the most civiliz'd as well as the greatest trading city of ancient Gaul  Massylians and  Genoua  Ligurian tow'rs  What though the potent Hanseatic league  And Venice mistress of the Grecian isles  With all th' Aegean floods awhile might sooth  The sad remembrance what though led through climes  And seas unknown with thee th' advent'rous sons  Of  The Portuguese discover'd the cape of Good Hope in  Tagus pass'd the stormy cape which braves  The huge Atlantic what though Antwerp grew  Beneath thy smiles and thou propitious there  Didst show'r thy blessings with unsparing hands  Still on thy griefindented heart impress'd  The great Amilcar's valour still the deeds  Of Asdrubal and Mago still the loss  Of thy unequal'd Annibal remain'd  Till from the sandy mouths of echoing Rhine  And sounding margin of the Scheld and Maese  With sudden roar the angry voice of war  Alarm'd thy languor wonder turn'd thy eye  Lo in bright arms a bold militia stood  Arrang'd for battle from afar thou saw'st  The snowy ridge of Apennine the fields  Of wide Calabria and Pyrene's hills  The Guadiana and the Duro's banks  And rapid Ebro gath'ring all their pow'rs  To crush this daring populace The pride  Of fiercest kings with more inflam'd revenge  Ne'er menac'd freedom nor since dauntless Greece  And Rome's stern offspring none hath e'er surpass'd  The bold  The Dutch  Batavian in his glorious toil  For liberty or death At once the thought  Of longlamented Carthage flies thy breast  And ardent Goddess thou dost speed to save  The gen'rous people Not the vernal show'rs  Distilling copious from the morning clouds  Descend more kindly on the tender flow'r  Newborn and op'ning on the lap of spring  Than on this rising state thy cheering smile  And animating presence while on Spain  Prophetic thus thy indignation broke  INSATIATE race the shame of polish'd lands  Disgrace of Europe for inhuman deeds  And insolence renown'd what demon led  Thee first to plough the undiscover'd surge  Which lav'd an hidden world whose malice taught  Thee first to taint with rapine and with rage  With more than savage thirst of blood the arts  By me for gentlest intercourse ordain'd  For mutual aids and hospitable ties  From shore to shore Or that pernicious hour  Was Heav'n disgusted with its wondrous works  That to thy fell exterminating hand  Th' immense Peruvian empire it resign'd  And all which lordly  Montezeuma emperor of Mexico  Montezeuma sway'd  And

weltring hosts and stain the chalky shore  Ev'n those whom now thy impious pride would bind  In servile chains hereafter shall support  Thy weaken'd throne when Heav'n's afflicting hand  Of all thy

dismay'd  Her head commercial Carthage bow'd at last  To military Rome th' unalter'd will  Of heav'n in ev'ry climate hath ordain'd  And ev'ry age that empire shall attend  The sword and steel shall
