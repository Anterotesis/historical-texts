 ODE IN HONOUR OF THE NUPTIALS OF THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES  ODE In Honour of The NUPTIALS of Their Royal Highnesses The PRINCE And PRINCESS of WALES Written  and  Composed BY M  r  Dibdin  LONDON Printed by the Author Sold at his Warehouse  in Strand  opposite the Adelphi  TO  HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY  THE QUEEN OF GREATBRITAIN As an humble Mite towards the universal Admiration of the  DOMESTIC VIRTUES  OF THAT Most exemplary of Wives and Mothers THIS ODE IS INSCRIBED WITH THE PROFOUNDEST DEFERENCE AND RESPECTâ–ª BY  Her Majesty's faithful Subject And devoted Servant C DIBDIN  PREFACE  THE following poem is not more an effusion of loyalty than it is a public congratulation The relative happiness likely to result from the union it celebrates is seriously and solemnly interesting to every British subject since the equivocal tenure of regal power in other countries must naturally render every additional link to the chain of public security here an object of considerable magnitude and as hereditary right is the strongest support of the constitution and the fairest ornament of the crown as experience has given us proof upon proof how dangerous to this nation is a doubtful right every honest man must of course bless an event likely to ensure the English throne to the present family  As to the poem itself it may perhaps be necessary to say something in explanation of it for I am willing to acknowledge that warmth and fancy seldom permit me to conform to mere rule and that in general I have better succeeded when my hand has obeyed my conception than when cold correctness has shrouded my ideas in a regular arrangement of words  I call it an ode as the most unexceptionable description I can give it It is not however an ode strictly speaking for I do not clog myself with the dull regularity of making my STROPHE turn to the left my ANTISTROPHE to the right or my EPODE sing before the altar It is not lyric except in the best sense of the acceptation that of being written for music Of the dithyrambic it certainly possesses the rapture but not the phrenzy It is not Pindaric for though it has flights in plenty it aims at no sublimity but that which is the offspring of simplicity  In some respects it resembles the epithalamium but not in all for that species of panegyric generally taken is purchased praise performed in the presence of the bride and bridegroom circumstances that will not be attributed to me or to my poem for all the world should not buy my commendation and the work itself will sufficiently vouch for me that there is too much of the heart in it to savour of solicitation  Its irregularities however are its advantages for they furnish a bolder scope to the imagination and give additional force and effect to the most enchanting of all mediums that ever conveyed pleasure to the heart In a word I have gone for strength without heaviness praise without adulation figure without distortion I  have endeavoured to be playful not ludicrous bold not daring easy not quaint But the most prominent feature in the picture is rapture to which perhaps I may have given a latitude somewhat bordering on that extravagance which on ordinary occasions literally taken might be called hyperbole but which upon the present occasion applied figuratively is appropriate and in place  I think I shall be allowed some credit for the construction of the poem There is a novelty in commanding the attendance of the muses and their mission to the celestials and the groupe bending from Olympus to behold the landing of the princess would not make an unworthy figure upon canvass The salutation of Britannia is interesting and her leading the bride in nuptial pomp to the temple of Hymen surrounded by an admiring populace is still more so Nor can Englishmen hear unmoved that prophecy of Fame at the conclusion which I for one wish with all my soul may be literally verified  As to the music itself it is composed not constructed written to the heart not to the head I have made melody my outline and through the wide range of that field of fancy I have endeavoured to excite feeling create interest and convey pleasure As to the harmony no more now than upon other occasions have I any thing abstruse for though I have plenty of modulation yet I have taken every possible care cautiously to avoid an obtrusion of discord into the temple of Hymen  In short I have written as I felt I am rejoiced at this event because I am an Englishman because the true security of English freedom that my father taught me to venerate that I liberally enjoy and that will constitute the best happiness of my children will be promoted by it Therefore be my ode Lyric Dithyrambic or Pindaric a mixture of all or a likeness of none it is honest and sincere and comes warm from the heart Thus though I only shall have manifested my admiration of those who are more immediately concerned and my gratitude to the public who are collaterally interested my labour will not have been in vain for I shall have gratified an ardent zeal and added one shout though but a feeble one to the willing and merited acclamations of a loyal and happy people  ODE IN HONOUR OF THE NUPTIALS OF  THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES  THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  DESCEND and consecrate ye sacred Nine  The nuptial rites of GEORGE and CAROLINE  Nor courted nor invok'd but wing your way  Yourselves inspired my mighty theme to obey  And first sweet Polyhimnia muse of sound  Verb'rate thy lyre and while thou spread'st around  Trembling Aether sweetly filling  Thy rapturous airs so soft so thrilling  Possess me rule each sense at thy control  Strain following strain  Again and yet again  Come with thy melody entrance my longing soul  AIR  In gliding measure charm to thee  The playful nymph Terpsichore  With ease and grace and look askance  Her panting bosom burning  As twining twisting turning  In winning guise she leads the mazy dance  Now soft and soothing be thy strain  To ease the fond Erato's pain  Whisper that in her realm no more  False fickle love shall she deplore  Bid her behold with glad surprise  Her mistress in Love's tender arts  A princess comes to bless our isle  Whose form shall captivate all eyes  And whose example fix all hearts  Bid her the trembling tear to dry  To dissipate the deepheav'd sigh  To smooth her low'ring brow and smile  And join accompany'd by thee  The playful nymph Terpsichore  With ease and grace and look askance  Her panting bosom burning  As twisting twining turning  In winning guise she leads the mazy dance  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  Now change the strain and to thy spell  Mighty Calliope compel  Displaying ample history's page  Bid her Urania bring a virgin and a sage  Who skill'd in Science' wond'rous lore  Can suns and worlds and heavens explore  Anda triumvirate to fill  Bid Clio her celestial skill  To aid the glorious purpose join  And while the trumpet's silver notes proclaim  So great so mighty so august a name  Bid them transmit to fame  Those truths divine  That speak the glory of the Brunswick line  But hark upon the ear what rustic strain  Cleaves the free air 'Tis gay Euterpe's train  That sylvan faun and hamadriade lead  With horn and flageolet and oaten reed  AIR  And first the horn whose mellow sound  Wakes Echo in the hollow rocks  To inspire the fleet sagacious hound  Where to unearth the subtle fox  The flageolet shall imitate  The feathered songster by his mate  Sequestered in the conscious grove  Impervious to all eyes but Love  And now as the lorn nightingale  Mourns sadly in the pensive vale  Day's labour at an end  Rustics the winding dance shall lead  To the cadence of Euterpe's reed  And mirth with sadness blend  AIR  And thou Melpomene appear  Whose woes find no relief  Whose mind's best joy's the social tear  Whose luxury is grief  Behold herdim each sorrowing eye  But let the torrent flow  Be hallow'd that sweet sympathy  That mourns for others' woe  AIR  Nor thou Thalia gay and trim  Skulk where behind thy mask thou'rt peeping  Come forth with frolic Wit and Whim  Rouse sluggard Dullness as he's sleeping  With honest gibe and moral jeer  And humour Honour's cause adorning  Come dissipate thy sister's tear  As cheers the sun an April morning  Say as her grief thou bid'st her dry  Each passion's virtue in its season  That as 'tis folly loud to cry  So laughing loud is sometimes reason  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  Begone disperse like air  To blue Olympus fly  There  Placed on high  As the celestials in their roseate bowers  Play with the Smiles and count the dancing Hours  Strike the loud spheres  Your voices raise  And charm their captured ears  Proclaiming Caroline's unequall'd praise  Her wisdom bid Minerva fear  Bid her who young Endymion embraced  Blush and resign the name of chaste  Tell lovely Venus and the dimpl'd Graces  To yield to truth and own  All sweet all beautiful as are their faces  Her face perfection boasts alone  All all while sitting in celestial state  That which they cannot equal bid them wonder at  And as your mandate they attend  And from the silver clouds astonish'd bend  Bid them behold with a benignant smile  The rapture that pervades Great Britain's happy isle  MARCH  Fir'd with my theme thus gave I Nature law  Will'd at a wish and what I fancied saw  AIR  I saw the gods in troops attending  Well pleas'd from high Olympus bending  While playful Neriedes gaily gave  The splendid yatch to Neptune's wave  I heard old Jove by Styx declare  He ne'er saw mortal half so fair  While Juno own'd he'd ne'er known strife  Could she like her have prov'd a wife  Minerva said proud to extol her  She'd always been her aptest scholar  Again her mirror and again  Venus regarded but in vain  Then rubb'd the surface 'twas not right  At last she broke it out of spight  One call'd for nectar "Go and sip"  Cry'd Hebe "Nectar from her lip"  Mars proudly said he saw a race  Of future heroes in her face  While roughhewn Neptune smiling swore  Ne'er had his billows borne before  A lovelier Venus to a happier shore  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  And truly Neptune swore scarce smil'd the fair  To thank old Ocean for his anxious care  But troops of bards burst forth in one fond lay  For light is light and day we still call day  And as the obvious truth fell from each tongue  By each proud heart inspir'd they felt and sung  AIR  Hail lovely wonder honour's meed  Rule every heart that virtue prizes  Eclipse each fair as stars recede  When from old Ocean Venus rises  Haste Haste with sacred love and truth  Grace smiling Hymen's blest communion  Haste and reward the only youth  Whose virtues merit such an union  II  See pictur'd in her face her mind  Beauty and goodness ne'er asunder  While Envy now no longer blind  Grows kindness and subsides to wonder  Roses bloom beneath her feet  Cupids for a smile implore her  While Zephyr steals a kiss so sweet  It perfumes all the way before her  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  Mute Admiration that had hush'd the crowd  Yielded to acclamations warm and loud  For lo a sight that ever shall impart  Strong strong emotions to each British heart  Scarce had the Princess on the peopled strand  Admired the beauty of fair Freedom's land  When in majestic grandeur stood revealed  Bright as her crest refulgent as her shield  BRITANNIAwith a tender zeal impress'd  As tutelary guardian of her lovely guest  And oh ineffable was the angelic smile  That bid the glorious stranger welcome to her isle  Nor ended there  Those shouts that rent the air  But as distinctions honours on the way  Still courted some solicitous delay  Their longing eyes pursu'd the splendid train  Nor lost them till they reach'd fair Hymen's fane  Whom they address'd in fervent prayer  AIR  Sacred Hymen on this night  Thy torch with fire celestial light  And in thy smiling crown of flowers  Symbol this pair's delicious hours  Let Flora's rose the wreath adorn  Deprived of each intruding thorn  Let the fond heliotrope be there  And Venus' myrtle fresh and fair  Mars for his laurel next invoke  And blend it with the civic oak  So Bliss Fame Constancy shall prove  Their lot bestowed by thee and Love  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  Here let me pause ye powers or let me claim  Than inspiration some superior name  Give me to speak the force of every grace  Perfection e'er bestowed on form or face  With all the gifts concentred in the mind  When gods their essence blend with humankind  So my strong zeal shall disappoint despair  So shall I sing the worth of this illustrious pair  AIR  So shall I paint in conflict tender  As fear and joy alternate strove  That form that bid her heart surrender  While burning blushes spoke her love  Not Sol that Belvidere delighted  Nor yet Alcides of Farnese  A form more perfect that united  Superior strength with nobler ease  II  So shall I paint that manly beauty  That worth to truth and virtue dear  That mildness honour goodness duty  All hearts admire all minds revere  These as his portrait faintly charmed her  Won her consent to be a wife  Now Love's promethean ardour warmed her  And breathed the picture into life  RECITATIVE ACCOMPANIED  Nor shall my glowing mind its ardour cease  Till as I paint their happiness increase  In willing numbers no less warm than true  I lay futurity to open view  And while a people join in loud acclaim  Tell to the universe the prophecy of Fame  AIR  Long on this isle the solar ray  Benignant eye of favouring Heaven  Shall beam to consecrate the day  That saw a Brunswick to a Brunswick given  Swell every voice beat every heart  All in the general bliss bear part  While the loud trumpet's notes proclaim  Fate's fiat by the mouth of Fame  "In other states while rule and power  "That strut the pageant of an hour  "Treason destroys and time absorbs  "Like circling planets in their orbs  "Here shall a happy people's joys  "Revolve in one just equipoise  "While time and virtue shall endure  "Their honour safe their rights secure  "Confirmed to this blest race alone  "England's hereditary throne"  THE END
