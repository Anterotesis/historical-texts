 THE BLACK ART Detected and Expos'd OR A DEMONSTRATION OF THE HELLISH IMPIETY OF  Being  or  desiring to Be  a  Wizzard Conjurer  or  Witch    AND Of the Horrid Wickedness of them that have  Recourse  to those who  are such  or are  suppos'd  to be so to seek  Relief  from them in any  Case whatever    Together with  Remarks  upon the  Causes  of this  Impiety    In a  LETTER  to a  Country Gentleman    Let Conjurers Necromancers those that correspond with wicked Spirits and apply to them for Assistance be all burnt alive  Law of  Kenneth    d  King of  Scotland  Hect Boethius  LONDON  Printed for  William Carter  at the  Green Dragon  in St  Paul  's Churchyard  THE BLACK ART Detected and Expos'd OR The Hellish IMPIETY of it In a LETTER  c  § I  Dear Cousin  YOur  Candour  will pardon a bigger  Fault  in me than any I hope I shall be ever willing to  commit  against the Rules and Laws of  Friendship  and  Honour    'Tis my giving you the  Trouble  of Reading a  long Letter  that I now beg your  excuse  for  The  Necessity  of sending it to you meeting with your  Generous Civility  your  Christian Temper  and  Endearing Sweetness  of Disposition will be a full  Dele  ry  of all the  Guilt  I can be suppos'd to have  contracted  by its length  My  House  having been lately  broken  at Midnight▪ my being bound  Hand  and  Foot  and my Servants too and  robb'd  has rais'd  variety  of  Reports  in the Country  Some basely  Reporting  That I would easily get my  Plate Money  and  Goods  again Meaning by  Intimations  which they  give  by  Conjuration  or by exercising that  Black  and  Accursed Art  of  dealing  with them that have  Familiar Spirits    And to confirm the  Probability  of their  Supposition  they do not stick to say that  That  was the  Reason  why I was so  Cheerful  and  Easie  during the  Robbery  and  talk'd  so freely with the  Robbers  And the  Reason  too why I have  been so  ever since  Nay some have not sail'd to  endeavour  to put about a  Report  That my  Money▪ Goods  and  Plate  were brought back to me again  Others perhaps  Innocently  having that Notion of  Learning  that they thought it might be done by  That    All that I have hitherto  said  in my  Defence  is  this  That I would not  do it  to  save  my  Life  to gain the  Universe  or Ten Thousand  Worlds    My dear Cousin the  Care  that I ought to have of your  Soul  as my  Parishioner  as well as my  Relation  and my  Friend  makes me willing to speak to you a little more  Affectionately  and  Tenderly  and  Closely  upon this Point And to set you right in it  Consider with me a little that place  Levit  xx  The Soul that turneth after such as have familiar Spirits and after Wizzards to go a whoring after them I will even set my Face against that Soul and will cut him off from among this People  Now tho' I can by Divine Aid  meekly sweetly  and  temperately  bear the  Defamation  and  Reproach  as far as  concerns  my  self Rejoicing  in the  Mark  and  Character  of my  Master Relying  on his  Cross  having it in my  view  to  sweeten  my  Affliction  to  calm  my  Passions  to  break  my own  Will  to  beat  down  Selflove  and to draw from that Fountain such  Grace  as is necessary to lead a Christian that is a Crucified Life yet because the  Honour  of  God  the  Honour  of the  Church  the  Safety  of many  Souls  who may be misled by the suppos'd  Example  are concern'd I shall not only demonstrate to you the  Detestation  and  Abhorrence  I have of this  matter  but endeavour upon this occasion to  rectifie  a great  Mistake  in the World  § II  And I shall Plead the  Cause of God  Labour to  destroy the Works of the Devil  which was the great  Business  of the Holy  Jesus  into the  World  St  John  iii To discover this great  Delusion  and  Cheat  of Souls that endangers often their  Everlasting Interest  that draws them off from their  Allegiance  to  God  deserves a  Forfeiture  of his  Favour  and  Protection  ▪ and puts them into a  Correspondence  and  Commerce  with the Devil I mean the  being  or  desiring to be  a  Wizzard  or  the seeking to them that are  and that in any Case whatever  Against  this  the  place  mention'd  Le+vit  xx and many more as you shall presently see is one would think a  dreadful Dissuasive The Soul that  c  By  Wizzards  are meant those that use any  Conjurations  or  Witchcrafts  by  Com+pact Correspondence Commerce Confede+racy    or  Familiarity with the Devil or any Evil Spirit of his Kingdom    A thing which those that expect a Heavenly  Kingdom  from their  Father which is in Heaven  should  tremble  to  think  of or so much as  once desire  to put in  Practice    We that belong to another  World  ▪ We that call  Christ  our Lord We that pray his  Kingdom may come  We that  renounc'd  the  Devil  and his  accursed Spirits  in our Baptism We that have been sanctified by the  Holy Spirit of God  We that have been  seal'd by it to the Day of Redemption  Ephes iv We whose  Conversation  or  Citizenship  or  Freedom  is in Heaven That We should Act contrary or consent to a  desire  to Act contrary to all  this  by  applying  our selves to the accursed  Spirits  of  Darkness  or their  Agents  this is dismal this is deplorable and deserves to be lamented with Tears of Blood  I shall therefore  once for all  set this in a true  Light  before you by the  Assistance  of that Holy  Spirit  of  God  which is contrary to the  Kingdom  and the  Spirits  of Darkness  And when you once see the  horrible Impiety  of  being  or  desiring to be  a  Wizzard  Conjurer  or  Witch  or of being engaged in any  Confederacy League Familiarity  or  Compact  with the  Devil  and withal have a  clear  and  tender  View of and in a close and piercing Thought consider the  great Wickedness  too of  seeking to them  whom you suppose to  be such  in any Case whatever I know you'll  start back  and with a  pious Trembling  not only desire to say with our  Lord Get thee behind me Satan  but with St  Peter  too presently turn the  stream  of your  Thoughts  and  Passions  another way and as a  proper Cure  of all such Tendencies say quickly with him  Lord thou knowest that I love thee    § III  That you may do  this  the more  effectually  and  tenderly  I must recommend to your  deepest Thoughts  these five or six Things  I shall desire you to consider with a  trembling Spirit  the  Threatnings  and consequently the  Hatred  of the  holy God  against it I mean not only of  being  or  desiring to be  a Wizzard but of  seeking  and  applying  to them that are suppos'd to  be such    How severely he has  punish'd  it  Consider 'tis in some measure to  desert  and  disown  the  Sovereignty  of God and advance the  Dominion  of the Kingdom of Darkness  'Tis a  going contrary  to our Baptismal  Vow  and  Covenant    'Tis in a great degree the  casting off  the  Protection  and  doubting  of the  Care  and  Providence  of the  holy God  and of a  tender Father  in hopes to find a  better Friend  in the  Devil    'Tis to chuse  Iniquity  rather than  Affliction  These are things that  strike Horrour  in the very  mentioning  of them And certainly an  Impiety  that has  all  these dismal  Aggravations  and  Dangers  in it should be  abhorr'd shunn'd  and  trembled  at beyond the standing on the Brink of a  Rock  or before the Mouth of a  Cannon  ready to be  discharg'd    § IV  Consider first the  Threatnings  and con+sequently the  Hatred  of the holy God against it This appears not only in the place before quoted  Levit  xx but in the last Verse of this Chapter  Lev  xx  A man or woman that hath a familiar Spirit or that is a Wizzard shall surely be put to death they shall stone them with stones their blood shall be upon them    Thus  Levit  xix  Regard not them that have familiar Spirits neither seek after Wizzards to be defiled by them▪ I am the Lord your God  Neither seek after them  It seems the very  seeking after them  is to be  defiled  by them  And shall the Holy and Eternal God look down from the Mansions of Glory▪ and see his  Sovereignty Protection  and  Care  of you  cast off slighted  and  dis+regarded  by you Or not  Humbly  and with  Resignation  depended on in the use of  lawful just  and  prudent  Means  Shall He from whom you expect  so much  as you do see you seeking to Wiz+zards and defil'd by them  Shall He see you casting off  his Dominion  and  Providence  who like a tender  Father  has so long taken  Care  for you and promised to do it all along and to bear your Charges home to the end of your  Journey  Yet because of some Affliction which he designs for  wise  and  good  and  merciful  Ends to you you'll now consent to the  deserting  him and turn away and seek to the Accursed  Spirits  of Darkness and to  Wizzards  who are Correspondents with them and consent to be  defil'd  by them  Wou'd you have this  said  of you  charg'd  upon you  remembred  of you at the Resurrection with a  Depart from me I know you not  Yet how justly may he say this to you who thus  departed  first from him  Nor should you ever cease tenderly to consider that the  consulting  Wizzards and them that have  familiar Spirits  is call'd an  Abomination to the Lord  Deut xviii  And how unlikely is it that the  Come  Blessed Children of my Father  should be said to those who are an  Abomination  to him  § V  Consider with me next  How severely he has punish'd this    It cost  Saul  his Life though a King  Chron  x So  Saul died for his Transgression which he committed against the Lord and also for asking Counsel of one that had a familiar Spirit to enquire of it and enquired not of the Lord Therefore he slew him  And if he  slew him  tho' a  King  so  consulting Wizzards  them that had  familiar Spirits  I need not stay to ask how justly the  same Actions  may draw down the  same Vengeance    And if not the  same Vengeance  in this lower World then without a  deep  and  tender Repentance  and an  unfeigned  Return to God that  Vengeance  which St  Jude  speaks of which is infinitely more to be  fear'd  than a present  temporal Death  ▪ I mean  the Vengeance of Eternal Life  Jude  To this Instance I might add the dismal Case of  Manass  another King who so  provok'd the Lord to anger  by the same Abomination  Kings  xxi by  dealing with familiar Spirits  and  Wizzards  that  he drew down  Judgments  on Himself and his Kingdom  Kings themselves  having been thus  severely punish'd  for seeking and applying to those who had  familiar Spirits  the  same Impiety  in you would not only deserve the  same  but  severer  and  worse  Judgments  For with a  grateful soft  and  affectionate  Heart consider you have had a  clearer Revelation  and have had  Life and Immortality brought to Light by the coming of the Holy Jesus  Tim i  And shall we who  more pretend  to be  led by the Spirit of God  turn away from him to be led by them that consult with  familiar Spirits  and the  accursed Spirits  of Darkness  And to make it a Heap and Conjugation of many Impieties together not only cast off the  Divine Protection  disrespect the  good Providence  of your God tacitly  blame  his  Conduct  refuse  Submission  to his  Wisdom  and his  Will  in  Afflictions  not only  turning away  from the  Spirit  to the  Spirits  of  Darkness  not cheerfully  acquiescing  in his  Aids Directions  and  Consolations  not only  departing from him  whom we would not have to say to us  Depart from me  in the Day of Judgment  But also to compleat the Wickedness all this to proceed from  Pride  Vainglory  or  Malice  or  Envy Impatience  or  Immortification  of Spirit  Covetousness  or  Discontent  and want of  Dependence  on and  Resignation  to God in the use of  just  and  lawful  means  What a  Heap  and Knot of  Impieties  are here  bound  up in the Prosecution of  one  Enough to  sink  a disconsolate Soul to the  Sorrows  of  Eternity    § VI  That 'tis in some measure to  desert  and  disown  the  Sovereignty  of God and advance the  Kingdom  of  Darkness  I have before hinted  But then if we will thus  cast off  and  despise  and grow  weary  of the  Providential Care  and  Protection  of God weary of our  Dependence  on him and  Resignation  to him and will run for Help and  Aid Relief  and  Cure  and  Satisfaction  and  Knowledge  to the  Devil  and his accursed  Spirits  if instead of submit+ting to his  Will  and to his  Wisdom  in Afflictions in the  sole  use of  lawful rational natural  and  prudent  means we run to th  se What is this but to suppose  that his  Enemy  and ours will be  kinder  to us than our  God  Whereas we never enough consider never with a Thought  deep  and  close  and  piercing  enough that our God has  kind  and  wise  and good ends in  Afflictions  and merciful  Designs  and the  Devil  nothing but  evil  Ends and  damning  Designs upon us if he  do  remove them Nor can he do  that  without the  Permission  and  Leave  of our God and Father  And then what a  Phrenzy  and heighth of  Folly  as well as  Wickedness  and  Impiety  is it either to  hope  or but to  consent  to try whether the  Devil  will be a better  Friend  to us than our  God  'Tis true indeed in Losses Diseases and other Afflictions we may and ought as I have hinted to use  rational  and  prudent pious  and  diligent just  and  discreet  Means and Care for our  Satisfaction    Ease  of them  And sometimes God  thinks fit  to direct us to the  right  and sometimes he  does  Sometimes  he thinks fit to  bless  the  leans and sometimes he  does not    But whether he  does  or  does not  direct  to and  bless  and  succeed  the Means  our  Relief  or Ease  Satisfaction  or  ure still he has  wise  and  good  and  fatherly  and  tender  and  compassionate  and  Ends  in it  But in  recourse  and going to  Wizzards  and  accursed Spirits  the  Devil  has none but  ill Ends  and  horrid Designs  in the  Relief  and  Successes  that he gives if he gives any And if possible for  each Kindness  he does would have a  Soul  to  Damnation    So that the very  Afflictions  of our God are ten thousand times  more choosable  than any  Relief  we can have of them from  Wizzards  or those  accursed People  that  treat  or are in league with the  Spirits  of Darkness  Nor can the  Devil  or his Agents  afflict  us without  God  's  Permission  Or without  that relieve  or  ease  or  direct  Any to any part of  Assistance Knowledge  or  Information    And if God in  Judgment permit  this▪ permit I mean some to be  seduc'd  and to  confide  in and  rely  upon the Devil and his Agents and to cast off his  Sovereign+ty Providence  and  Protection  such are within an Ace of his Clutches and  ever+lasting Damnation    So infinitely are  Afflictions  and Cha+stisements from a tender  Father  to be prefer'd before any  Relief  or  Satisfaction  ▪  or  Ease  from the  Devil  or his  Our  God  having nothing but  wise  and  good  Ends when  he assists  and the  Devil  nothing but  dreadful  and  accursed Designs  when he  relieves  or  informs  or  aids  or  eases  If he do it at all Nor can he  do it at all  without the Divine Permission▪  Which alone were enough to make you  ashamed  and  start  and  tremble  at the  Phrenzy  the  Danger  the  Imprudence  of having any recourse to  Wizzards  and their accursed  Agents  in any case whatever  § VII  There is another  dreadful Impiety  in it never sufficiently  consider'd  or laid to  Heart  by the World Which no Person that has been concern'd in it can  reflect  on with an  unbroken  Heart and an  unrelenting  Spirit  That 'tis a going contrary to our Baptismal Vow and Covenant  That  sacred Vow  we all made when we were mercifully received into the  Family  of our  Saviour  receiv'd into his  Church  ▪ kindly admitted into his  Kingdom  of  Grace  in order to his  Kingdom  of  Glory  That  sacred Covenant  we entred into with God when we took our  first step  for Heaven  Then we  renounc'd  the  Devil  and all  Works  of his all  Correspondence  with and  Recourse  to all  Dealing  and  Commerce  with him or his  Imps  and  Agents    And if we solemnly  renounc'd  him  then  shall we make a  Covenant  or  correspond  or  deal  with him now Or treacherously side or joyn with  them that do  We that promised to  fight manfully under the Banner  of our God and Saviour shall we desert him  now Now  when we can consider  how much  he tenders us or  how little  And how shameless a thing it would be to expect Heaven at a  cheaper rate  than one  poor short  Life of  Loyalty Obedience  and  Love  to him  We that then promised to  continue his faithful Soldiers and Servants to our Lives end  shall we now throw down hi  easie Yoke  and  light Burthen  when it does begin to  pinch  a little Shall we  cast down  his  Cross  when our  Faith  and  Love  is a little try'd And take part with  his  and  our  grand and  implacable Enemy  So implacable as never to be  content  and  satisfied  without our  Eternal Ruine  and  everlasting Damnation    And if you  will thus  desert your  God  consider what harm has he done you that you should leave him It may be  he  has  afflicted  you and you hope the  Devil  will  relieve  you But I have answer'd this already He afflicts for  loving Ends  The Devil when he can  relieve  does it only for  damning Ends  Nor can he relieve or help without God's Permission  The Afflictions of a wise and good Father are  mercifully  intended and in due time with our  rational  and  prudent  Means and Prayers to him he will  remove  them  Or if he do not  remove  them 'tis only because 'tis  best  for us not to have them  remov'd  And then I would only ask this Question If  God  think fit to take any thing from us is it fit we should desire to  keep it  § VIII  And now give me leave to  ask again  You that  renounc'd the Devil and all Works  and Agents of his when you were  kindly  and  mercifully  and most  endearingly  admitted into the  Family  of your Saviour  before you  knew  it or could  beg  it and before so many  thousands  of the World who never had that  Happiness  will you now close with  him  whom you then  renounc'd  Will you  treat  with him Will you  covenant  with him Will you  consent  with him Will you  joyn    any way  take part with him or with  them that do  all this only because you would remove an  Affliction  which a tender Father  kindly  sent and can remove and which the  Devil  cannot  remove  without his  Leave  And if he do  give Leave  'tis to your infinite and eternal Danger  And  after all  'tis but what  your God  will  remove  himself when the  Time  comes that he sees  'tis best  for you And he will then direct you to the  proper  and the  best Means  and will hear your  Prayers  and bless your  Endeavours  and  Applications    Nay when  that Time  comes in which he sees it best for you he will answer your  Desires  and  relieve  and  ease  you without  Means  or  make it up  some other  way    Come good Sir turn all this  inward  and with a  soft  and  melting  a  tender  and  relenting  Spirit enquire  Why O why my Soul shall we desert such a Father What Injury hath he done us  The  least Kindness  the  Devil  does us or seems to do for us he would have our  Damnation  for it The least Affliction our  Father  gives us he means the promoting our  Salvation  by it  The  least Aid  or  Ease  the Devil gives he gives it in  Expectation  of a Soul down to the Howlings of the damn'd The  least Affliction  our God gives us or permits to be given us he  does  it in  Expectation  and  Desire  of fitting us for Heaven by it  The  least Kindness  the  Devil  or his Agents does for any it gives him a  better Title  to a Soul The  least Affliction  a tender Father gives 'tis either to  awaken  a Soul or  rouse  it or  hedge  in its  way  to him or to make it  cry  after him as a  Child  does when a  Father  hides his Face a little or for other  wise  and  good  and  holy  Ends  And would you apply your self to the  accursed Spirits  or their Agents and desert such a Father  I ask again What  Unkindness  has he done you What  Injury  has he done you For when all is done his  Kindnesses  and  Mercies  are a  thousand times  more than  his  Afflictions  and his  Afflictions  nothing but  Kindness    § IX  Another dreadful Aggravation of the  being  or  desiring  to be a  Wizzard Con+jurer  or  Witch  or  seeking  to  them  that are is this  'Tis in a great degree a casting off the Protection and the Providence of God  And would you do an  Action  by which you should tacitly  deny  or  despise  his  Providence  Do you think he has  forgot  or  neglects  to  govern  the World Because  some things  do not  go  as you would  have  them Or▪ Because he  permits  some  uneasie  things to  befal you    Do you imagine That he that takes care of Sparrows so that  not one of them shall fall to the Ground  without him That numbers the  very Hairs of your Head  that he takes  no care  of the World or has cast off the  Government  of it Or▪ that he has wholly  left  it to the  Devil  Or Are you  willing  he should  leave  it to the  Devil  and his  Agents  because you are  willing to go to them  for  Help  and  Remedy  for  Relief  or  Ease  who as I have said can do nothing without God's leave and for every thing they  do  would damn a Soul  Or If you do own his  Protection  and  Providence  and  Wisdom  yet are you willing to  cast it off  and think the  Devil  's would be  better  Or Are you willing to  trust him  farther than  your God  These are  Questions  and  Inquiries  that should be enough to  melt  and  break  the most  hard  and  stoniest  Heart in the World  What has the  Devil done  for you And what has  your God  left  undone  Who sent his Son to die for  that Soul  that the  Devil  would  cheat  you of And who sends an  Affliction  to make you still the more  careful  of that Soul And the  Devil  would  remove  it only to be able to  torment  it for  ever    § X  And now if you please e'en trust your  implacable Enemy  farther than a  compassionate Father  Put your self under his  Care  and  Protection▪ seek  to him for  Direction  Assistance  and  Aid joyn  and  covenant  with him or  with them  that do if you can think him your  better Friend  or if he have done  more  for your  Soul  and  Body  Or if you think  he  means  so well  by  removing  an  Affliction  as your God does by  giving  it When what's still to be remembred he cannot remove it without God's leave and  God  will  remove  it himself when he sees it  best  for you And till he sees it  best  'tis  best  it should be as it is  God  as I before said has not  given up  or left the  Government  of the World He neither  slumbers  nor  sleeps His Eyes are in every place beholding the Evil and the Good  Prov xv  Nay more than  that shall there be Evil in a City and the Lord hath not done it  Amos iii  You are to consider there is the  Evil of Sin  and the  Evil of Suffering    The Evil of Sin he is of  purer Eyes  than to  behold  He abominates it The  Evil of Sin  is done not by his  positive Will  but by his  permissive Will  He often permits it Otherwise there could be no such things as  Vertue  and  Vice Rewards  and  Punishments    But the  Evil of Suffering  or the  Evil of Affliction  directly comes from him That is he either directly sends it or permits it to befal us by the  Hands  or  Tongues  of others And in this he has always infinitely  wise  and  merciful  and  good  and  kind  ends to us Which  he  clearly  sees  tho'  we see  them not  He has  tender  and  compassionate  Designs in them while we  murmur  at them And while we impatiently  complain  and would fain go to the Devil and his  accursed Agents  to  cross  those  wise  and  good  and  compassionate  Designs and Ends of  God  in them  But can you tell what these  wise  and  good  Ends are  Yes I can I can tell you many of them and he has a  Thousand more  And yet even  but One  of these I shall  mention  is  sufficient  so far to  recommend  them to us as to make us  kiss the Rod  and to look up to him with  Love  and  Resignation  and to be  Thankful  for them  § XI  'Tis in  Mercy  and with infinitely  kind Designs  he permits us to be  sometimes  afflicted whether it be  by Men  or in other Cases And seldom without  One  or  All  of these gracious Ends  It may be and often is to  wean  us from the World  To try our  Patience  and  Resignation  to his Will  To  Reform something  he sees amiss in us or to bring us to  Repentance    To  hedge in  our Way to him tho' it be with Thorns  To try whether we will love him as well when his  Hand lies hard  upon us as when it  does not    To smite  here  that he may spare  hereafter    To try whether by our  stedfastness  we can be content that  Heaven  and his  Love  or his  Obedience  should cost us something  These are some and he sees more  Let us give each of these a  short  and  tender  View And then besides the horrid Impiety of  seeking  to the  Devil  or his  Agents  to remove an  Affliction  so  well  so  kindly  meant to us by God we should see Reason to  Adore  and  Thank  him for it And much rather  Cross  the Impatience of our  Spirit  by a  Thankful Resignation  than Cross his Merciful  Designs  in it and  That  by the most dreadful Wickedness too  He sometimes bestows an  Affliction on us to wean us from the World    It may be he sees us set our Hearts  too much  on something of this lower World tho' we see it not And he does not think it safe for us to do so  When he sees us  thus  to stick too close to it he sends a  Disappointment  to raise our Affections  there  where Enemies and Disappointments shall never enter  He sometimes  does it  for a kind Tryal of our  Patience  and  Resignation    You would fain chuse what  Part  you shall  act here  Not considering enough that your God can  chuse  better  for you  than you can  for your self  Let him  therefore  dispense  as he pleases who is the  great Master  of the World And perhaps he would this way try to bring you to say with  humble Love If This please God let it be as it is  At other times he lets an  Affliction  fall gently on us  to bring us to Repentance  and to  Reform  something  he sees  amiss in us though  we see  it not our selves  And would we have a  tender Father  let us run on to the Sorrows of Eternity without  Restraint  or  Check  or  Care  or  Notice  It may be he sees us about to  turn  out of the  Road  to a  lovely Immortality  and he would kindly  strike us  in again This was the Case of  David  Psal cxix  Before I was afflicted I went astray but now have kept thy word  He sometimes sends it to  hedge in our way to him tho' with Thorns  Less than this or other suchlike Methods would not perhaps serve the  Turn  And he sees it necessary to chide us into  Resignation  or some  other Duty    Or it may be he  lets down  an Affliction upon us to try whether  we will love him as well when his Hand lies hard upon us as when it does not    And when  Job  in this respect was  try'd  he was found  faithful  He could as easily  Bless  and  Thank  and  Adore  and  Love  him when he  took away  as when he  gave Job  i  And you your self never  sufficiently consider'd  how unreasonable 'tis to be  troubl'd  that you have not  one thing  that you  need not  when your  Love  and  Thankfulness  to God should be greater for having receiv'd  all you need    Or if he please to send an  Affliction  to  smite here that he may spare hereafter  this is the greatest kindness in the World 'Tis to bring thee to  judge thy self  that thou may'st not  be judged  And you'll fly in the  Face  of the  Physician  because his  Physick  is unpleasant to the taste  And if he has a mind to  chuse thee from the Furnace of Affliction  Isai xlviii do not  chuse  the Sorrows of Eternity by  crossing  his merciful Designs in going to a Wizzard to seek  thus  to remove the kind Affliction  And then  seventhly  and  lastly  If he sometimes sends us an Affliction to  Exercise our Passive Graces and to try whether we can be content that his Obedience and his Love should cost us something  This puts an opportunity into our Hands  to Thank  Him that he has given us any thing that we can lose for him And above all to consider that whatever we may lose  for him  we shall never lose  by him  And therefore we can never  lose too much for God    § XII  These are  some  and your God has a  Thousand more  good Ends in sending thee an  Affliction    O that instead of  crossing  these  merciful  Ends of God and that by horridly  unlawful  Means we would humbly answer the  compassionate Designs  and  bless  and  thank  Him for the Means  But alas instead of this you will have  recourse  to the  Devil  and his accursed  Spirits  and  Agents  to remove that Affliction which you should  thankfully receive  and  piously improve    If the  Devil  or his  Agents  do or can  relieve you as he expects the  Damnation  of your  Soul  for the  Kindness  so  your God  would in  due time  when it comes to be best do it for you And before  that Time  does come knows it  best  for you it should be  as it is  But by  that time  he will  direct  thee to the Means and  bless  them Or if  that Time  should never come in this  lower World  and we should never see the  Means  for removing an Affliction best 'tis then certain he designs a  better Time  for it and till  That comes  'tis  best  not to have them  bless'd  as yet  And now  desert  such a  Father  if you can when he only sends  Afflictions  for your  good  Have recourse to the  Devil  or his  Agents  if you can who only would  remove  them to  and  ascertain  your  Damnation  Nor can he do  That  without your Father's  leave    And are you willing  God  should give him  leave  to  Ease you  at the  Expence  of your  Soul  Are you content God should give him  leave  to be your  Physician  at the hazard of your  Eternal Damnation  Or to be your  assistant Director  and your  Informer  in any thing here that you may be guided and directed by him  home  to the Sorrows of  Eternity    Rather  start  back and  tremble  at but the  Thoughts  of this And whatever the  Loss  or the  Temptation  or the  Affliction  be do but  trust  your God a  little while  longer And 'tis but a  little while  you'll be  able  to  trust  him 'Tis but a little while you'll be able to  shew  that you can trust him And you'll shortly see a  satisfying  and  unexpected  Issue in one or in both Worlds  § XIII  'Tis another Aggravation of this dreadful Impiety of  having recourse  to  Wizzards Conjurers  and  Witches  and  treating  and  dealing  with them for  Direction Help  or  Ease  in any Calamity  That  'tis  to chuse Iniquity rather than Affliction    Against  This  we are  caution'd  in holy  Job  Him who could bless God as well when he  took away  as when he  gave  Job xxxvi  Take heed regard not Iniquity for this thou hast chosen rather than affliction  And would you have  This  remembred of you when the ArchAngel's  Trump  shall  sound  and that  Sound  shall mingle with  the  Crack  and the  Noise  of the dissolving World  Would you have this  remembred  of you  now  and  recounted  among the wisest and best  Beings  of the upper  lovely  World  where there is Joy over one Sinner that repenteth  That you would  chuse the Iniquity  of deserting your God rather than an  Affliction  though kindly  meant  to you and mercifully  design'd  and  intended  That you would rather  chuse  the horrible Iniquity of having  recourse  to the  accursed Spirits  of Darkness to be  eas'd  of an  Affliction  Which if they  can  or  do  ease you of expect the  Damnation  of your  Soul  in return When all the while as I must again say your  God  would have  eas'd  it in the use of  Prayer Diligence  and  Lawful Means  in a little time Or if not sees it  best for you  not to have it  eas'd  as  yet  And till  his Time  comes 'tis not fit you should desire it should be  in your's    Would you really  accept  of a  Deliverance  from the  Devil  or his Accursed Agents upon these Terms Ah no You know your Fathers in Christianity and the Patriarchs  would not  accept of a  Deliverance  from the  Afflictions  cast on  them by  Men  or  Devils that they might obtain a better Resurrection  Heb xi  They would not accept of a  Deliverance  though a  lawful  one And would you  accept  of an  unlawful  and  accursed  one Would you  accept  of a  Deliverance  from the wretched  Spirits  of  Darkness  who can give you none without  God's Permission  And who for  this Deliverance  expect and desire no less than your  Soul  down to those Torments from whence there is  no Deliverance    § XIV  And now let us  look back  again a little to  that place  of  Levit  xx And let us there observe  one thing  more  They that  are  or  desire  to be  Wizzards  or  seek  to them  I will even set my Face against that Soul  says the holy God  And very justly▪ When you first  set your Face against him Fly in his Face  for mercifully and kindly correcting you Fly in his Face for giving you a Thousand  good Things  and a Thousand  better  Promises  and gives you but  one Affliction  or  two  and that too in  Tenderness Love  and  Mercy    No wonder therefore he has been pleas'd to say  I will set my Face against that Soul  You first  setting  yours against Him  deserting  Him  running  from Him to his Enemies  disowning  his  Sovereignty Protection Care  and  Providence  going contrary to your  Baptismal Vow  and  Promise  to him advancing the  Kingdom  of  Darkness  which his Son the Holy  Jesus  came to  destroy  acting directly contrary to one great  End  and  Design  of his coming into the World And  All This  but to  Repair  a Loss  Regain  an Ease or  Remove  an  Affliction  which without God's  leave  he has no  Power  to do and which God sent to a  good  and  merciful  End and when that  End  is answered will  remove  it Which till he  sees best  to do 'tis  not best  for you to  desire    And now if you'll  fly  in his  Face  for this Go consider and see who  first  set his  Face  against the  other Your God  against  You  or  You  against  Your God    And then the only  Question  I have to  ask  upon this  Head  is  When  is it that you could be content to have him  set his Face against you  I will mention but  Four  sorts of  Times  and  Days  which will come upon you And would you have it  set against you  in either of these  Would you have him set his Face against you in the  Day of Affliction  Or in the  Days of Prosperity  Or in the  Hour of Death  Or in the  Day of Judgment  § XV  Would you be content to have your  God  set his Face against you  in the Day of Affliction  This  Day  and  Hour  awakes every one of us And nothing will  sweeten  or  alleviate  an  Affliction  so  truly  and so  much  as the  secret inward joyous  Apprehensions that they come from a tender  Father whose  Wisdom  and  Goodness  has merciful  Designs  and  Ends  in them though  we  see them not The sweet  Illapses  of the  Divine Love  with them will make them  supportable  and  easie    But how  intolerable  must an Affliction be how heavy the Load and how insupportable the Pressure when it comes with the  Face of the Lord set against us  too with just Apprehensions of his  Wrath  and  Anger    This must be a little  Image  of  Hell  on  Earth  a little kind of  Foretaste  of the  Sorrows  of Eternity an  Image  and little  Resemblance  of that State where  their Worm dieth not and their Fire is not quenched    If in this Day and Hour of Affliction it be thus insupportable to have  his Face set against  thee consider  now  how just 'tis it should be so When you first  desert  Him set your  Face against  Him  reject  or  cast off  his Protection and his Providence will not stay for his  Wisdom  and his  Time  and his  Goodness  to Relieve and Ease you in his Blessing of  prudent just  and  lawful  Means But will look upon the  Devil  and his  accursed Spirits  as your  better Friends  and give  your self up to be  assisted  or  reliev'd eas'd  or  directed  by them or their  wretched Agents    § XVI  And as little certainly would you have him  set his Face against you  or lie under the just Apprehension of his  Displeasure  and his  Wrath In the days of Prosperity    Without the sweet  Illapses  of the  divine Love  and the rational wellgrounded  Hopes  of the  Care Protection  and  Favour  of our God and of the living in a State  acceptable  to him there can be no such thing as  Prosperity  in this Life  The  Stings  and  Gnawings  the  Dissatisfactions  and  Uneasiness  of a  guilty  Breast will sowre and imbitter all Enjoyments of the World mix  Gall  and  Wormwood  with them  The true  Sedateness Serenity  and  Tranquillity  of Mind is only the  Result  of those Consolations which the Holy  Spirit  of God gives upon an undissembled  Purity Probity  and  Sanctity  of Life  The sweet  Emotions  the delicious  Relishes  and the holy  Joy  which these raise  in and leave upon the Soul are  such  as no Enemy can  reach  or  meddle  with Which  Men  or  Devils  cannot  take  from us  And will you part with these  Emotions Relishes  and  Joys  and give them up to  him  and his accursed  Spirits  only to be eas'd of an  Affliction  sent you by a tender Father to  wise  and  good  and  kind  Ends  Would you think it a  greater Kindness  from the  Devil  to  remove  it than 'twas in God to  send it  When he can't remove it neither as I have often said without the  Leave  of your God  Will you  trust him  farther than you'll  trust  your  God  And think that he will  do more  for you than your  God  That  God  who has given you a  thousand  Mercies for  one  Affliction And yet for that  one Affliction  you'll  desert  and  leave  him and  forget  all his other  Mercies    Let not this be  said  or  remembred  of you at the Resurrection when the  Crowns  and  Palms  of Eternity come to be dispos'd of  § XVII  Nor would you have the  Face of God set against you  sure when the cold  Sweat  shall sit upon your  Brows  and your  mourning Relations  shall stand round your  Bedside  and come and take their  last leave  of you When nothing shall be so  welcome  to you as a Prayerbook no  Company  like a  Guide  of Souls no  Imployment  but  Devotion  and you shall stand upon the  Threshold  of a  NewWorld  By  that time  you would not surely have the  Face of him set against you  from whom you will infinitely desire the Approbation of  welldone Good  c And from whom you would desire the Character of  Moses  beyond all the Treasures of the  Indies  Joshua i  Moses my servant is dead  And if you would not then have the  Face of him set against you  from whose  Mouth  you would in that  Day  and  Hour pant  and  sigh  and  languish  for this Approbation O why will you  set your Face against him  now  Trust  his  Enemies  farther than  him  now Have  recourse  to  them  and desert  him  now Join with  them  against  him  and expect  Relief  or  Ease Direction  or  Assistance  from  them  rather than from  him    And I doubt not but you'll say you would least of all have him set  his Face against  you in the  Day of Judgment    When the ArchAngels Trump shall summon the  trembling World  to appear before the Throne of God and to come and take their  last Sentence  and  Consignation  to their Eternal State The  Devil  whom you have  recourse  to now will be then your  grand Accuser    He whom you  trust  so far  now  for  Relief  or  Direction  will lie  hard  and  bitterly  against you  then  and be your  implacable Witness  and  that  even for  this  too  He to whom you go for  Help now  will  then  very bitterly plead  this  against you That you  did so Then  you will need an  Advocate  to answer his  Objections  And  this Advocate  you'll desert and provoke now and draw him to set  his Face against you  Hoping by seeking to the  Devil  in need that he would be  kinder  to you than your  God    How should but the bare  mention  of such things as these set the  guilty Soul  a  trembling  And make it appear  evil and bitter  to him thus to have  forsaken the Lord  in any Degrees or Measures  Jer  ii  Come rather  accuse  your self and prevent the  grand Accuser  And humbly and with Resignation of Soul trust  him  now on whom alone you are to  trust  in the  Hour  of  Death  and the  Day  of  Judgment    But  tremble  ever at the Thoughts of trusting him for any the least  Relief Direction  or  Ease  who for  one Affliction  remov'd if he can and do remove it  expects  and  desires  you should bear the  Afflictions  of  Eternity    § XVIII The Causes of this Impiety  If in the  last place  you would consider  deeply  and  tenderly  with a close and piercing Thought the  Reasons  of Mens  giving way  to this Impiety of  being  or  desiring to be  a  Wizzard  or  Conjurer  or  seeking to them  that are this will make it appear more  tremendous  and  shameful  yet  And usually 'tis  one  or  all  of these  Seven      Pride or Vainglory    Discontent    Malice Revenge and Envy    Covetousness or an eager Love of the World    Impatience and Immortification of Spirit    Distrust of the divine Providence    Want of Love to God In Submission his Will and to his Wisdom  And no wonder if such  dismal Causes  produce so  bad Effects      Pride  or  Vainglory    A Desire of being  thought something  in  Learning  or  Knowledge  above others no doubt has given the Devil very often a  occasion  He himself is a  proud Spirit  and he is willing to cherish that  assimilating Vice  in any It threw  him  out of  Heaven  and he would willingly have it  throw others thence  too Whereas the  first Ver+tue  of our Lord's  Sermon  to countermine him was Humility  Blessed are the poor in Spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven  But what a dreadfully  mistaken Excellency  is this to be  proud  of To have the  Favour Correspondence Assistance  and  Guidance  of the  accursed  Spirits of Darkness at the Expence of  his Favour in which there is Life  Psal  And who has said  Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in Heart    A second Cause of this Impiety is  Discontent    An  uneasie  and  unreasonable  Sin  A  tender Father  for a  thousand Mercies  gives us and sees it necessary to give us  one Affl  tion  And we will  fly in his Face  because he  does  And run to the  Devil  for  Help  in Hopes he will be  kinder  to us Whereas for the  removal  of one Affliction he would bring upon us  a  thousand Miseries  for a  thousand Ages    While our God gives us a  thousand Blessings  and sends us an  Affliction  to bring us the safer home to  ten thousand  more  § XIX  Another Cause of this horrid Impiety is  Malice  Or  Revenge  and  Envy Spite  and a  bitter Spirit    This pleases the grand  Enemy  of  Mankind  extreamly Likens our  Spirit  to his  own  and  predisposes us  and gives him  advantage    'Tis indeed a  Temper  so agreeable to his  haughty implacable  and  malicious  Disposition as brings some  pretty near  to him before they have recourse to  Wizzards  and  seek  to them And it pleases him the  more  because 'tis a Disposition  so contrary  to the Prince of  Peace  and the God of  Love    And if he can boil up the  bitter Spirit  high enough to fit it to be  deserted  by the  Spirit  of God he will soon shew it ways if he be thus permitted to  revenge  an  Enemy    And  then  he has a  double Ty  upon them Not only by the Vices of  Malice Envy  and  Revenge  which are so contrary to  Heaven  and the Temper that reigns in the  Element  of  Love  But he gains  by them  a  dependence  upon  Him  to  assist  them in doing  mischief  and to oblige  that Malice    'Tis true blessed be God he does not permit this  often  Yet he  sometimes  does as he did in the case of  Job    But then if he do  permit this  a little  Permit  I mean the Devil or his Agents to  afflict  Men he always gives those that  look  up to him and  depend  on him and  desert  him not either a  way to escape  or something  better  than  That  would have been  And while I am speaking of  Revenge  and  Malice  and of the  eager Sowerness  of an impotent restless and bitter  Spirit  as one great  Motive  and  Fitness  and  Predisposition  to  be  or to  desire to be  a Wizzard or to be seeking to them that  are  Let me observe one thing The difference between the  Spirit  of  these Wretches  and the  Spirit  of a  Christian    The malicious Agents of the Devil  sleep not  Prov iv  except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall    But the  Spirit  of a  Christian  not only sleeps sweetly but gains ground for  Heaven  by his Enemy's  Bitterness  His Enemy's putting himself  back  in his Accounts for  Eternity  gives him an occasion of adding  some Jewels  more to his  Crown  of Glory And he the good Man  lays up  a little more  Treasure  in Heaven by such opportunities of exercising his  Piety Charity  and  Mercy  And while the  bitter Spirit  goes for the Aid of the Devil to  mischief  and  revenge  his Enemy the  Christian Spirit  with  sweetness ease  and  temper  looks up to him who said  Father forgive them they know not what they do    And when he does thus  look up  to him and to the new strange  lovely World  of Beatified Spirits that he may  smile  upon each other in the  Element  of  Love  can say  Blessed Jesu grant I may carry my Enemies in my Heart to intercede for them though they deserve it not and have banish'd me from theirs a  thou carriest me in thine without regarding  my unworthiness and that in all Circumstances whether good or evil I may have thy Cross before my Eyes to sweeten my Affliction to calm my Passions to break my own Will to beat down Selflove and to draw from this Fountain such Grace as is necessary to lead a Chri+stian that is a crucified Life  § XX  A fourth Cause of this Impiety of  seeking to  and  consulting Wizzards  these Agents of the Devil is  Covetousness  and an  eager Love  of the World  As if when the  holy God  has permitted any thing to be  taken  from us we would  have  it again from the Devil rather than be  without  it  I shall not stay to lay all the dismal  Load  upon this that it would  fairly bear  But only stay to  ask  one humble  Question  When God thinks fit to  take  any thing from us is it fit we should eagerly desire to  keep it  Much less is it  fit  we should use the unlawful  means  of having recourse to the Agents of the  Spirits  of Darkness  As if we would send the Devil if we could to  wrest  a  Restitution  out of God's  Hands    Another  Cause  of this horrid Wickedness is  Impatience and Immortification of Spirit    We can easily say with  Job The Lord gave Blessed be the Name of the Lord  But we have not Resignation enough to say  The Lord hath taken away Blessed be his Name    When indeed this would be the true and proper  Time  of the  Tryal  of our  Allegiance Fidelity  and  Love  To  love Him then  when his  Hand  lies a little  hard  upon us  For let him please but to permit your  Health  or  GoodName  or  Possessions  to be taken  away  you'll run to the accursed  Spirits  of  Darkness  in hopes they will find a way to  relieve  you and be  kinder  to you than your  God  Who all the while by an Affliction only designs to turn your Eyes a little more closely to his  Kingdom  or to  hedge  in your  way  to it or to  lead  and  conduct  you the safer thither or some other  Kindness  or  Mercy    The next Cause of this Impiety is  Distrust of the divine Providence    As if God had  given  up the  Care  and  Government  and  Conduct  of the World to the  Devil  And you would  thankfully  receive from  him  and his accursed Agents what your  God  in  Love  and  Mercy  has permitted to be  taken  from you and will himself give  again  to you or something  better  for  it  if with humble  Love  you  depend  on him  Or as if an  Affliction  should be  thankfully receiv'd  from God you would rather  thankfully receive  a Removal of it from the  Devil  who of himself too has no Power to  grant it  And if it be  permitted  by  God  to be granted by the Hands and Power of the Devil or his  Agents  is a dreadful  Judgment  and not a  Mercy    The last of the most  common Causes  of this Impiety is  want of Love to God  that would  sweetly incline  you to submit to his  Will  and to his  Wisdom    We sometimes say we are willing his  Wisdom  and  Goodness  and  Love  and  Care  should chuse for us in all things But yet we are apt to think we could  chuse better  for our selves Nay what's infinitely  worse than  that  such as I am now speaking of think the  Devil  and his  Wizzards  and  Agents  can  chuse better  for them  And would you have this  said  or  remembred  of you and charg'd upon you when the ArchAngel's Voice shall mingle with the Crack and the Noise of the dissolving World  To conclude  Instead of ever giving the least way to the least  Correspondence  with these  Agents  of the  Spirits  of  Darkness  I mean instead of seeking to any  Wizzard Conjurer  or  Witch  in any case whatever  start  back and  tremble  at the Thought  And thank your God That he has  given  you any thing that you can  lose  for him be it  Health Possessions  or any thing else rather than  receive  the least part of them from the  Hands  of the  Devil    And in the use only of  Rational Natural Prudent Pious  and  Lawful  Means look up to a tender  Father  who  looks down  and sees your  Needs  and  Dangers  And chearfully  on him He will  assuredly  direct  to the  best Means  and  bless  them too But then it must not be in  your Time  but in  his    And if he do not presently  direct  you to them 'tis because he  yet  sees it  best  you should not be  directed  to them  Or If he do not think fit either to  direct  you to them or to  bless  them 'tis if you thus  affectionately  and  humbly rely  on him because he designs something  better  for you in  Lieu  of it  And on this you may  securely rest    So that dear Cousin if you or any Friend of yours should by any  Loss  or  Pain Hardship  or  Reproach Hope  or  Desire Fear  or other  Passion  incline ever to a Thought of seeking to a  Conjurer Witch  or  Wizzard  do not in the least  consent  or  yield  to the  Temptation  till you have read a  few Leaves  of this Book And have  kneel'd down  and have
