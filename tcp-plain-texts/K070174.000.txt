 AN ADDRESS TO THE WHIG CLUB c  AN ADDRESS TO THE WHIG CLUB WITH AN ESSAY ON THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION OF JUDGES ON FIATS AND ON BAIL  "And they do claim demand and insist upon all and singular the premises as their undoubted rights and liberties and that no declarations judgments doings or proceedings to the prejudice of the people in any of the said premises ought in any wise to be drawn hereafter into consequence or example"  BILL OF RIGHTS  DUBLIN PRINTED FOR J MOORE NO COLLEGEGREEN  MDCCXC  AN ADDRESS TO THE WHIG CLUB  IN your integrity and abilities the people con∣fide for protection justice and redress Upon the principles on which you have associated they rest their hopes They expect from your virtue spirit and perseverance not only the preservation of their rights lately rescued from an usurped and foreign con∣troul but the perfection of their further claims by removing that corruption which has contaminated every department of the State which has tainted even the most sub∣ordinate offices which has encreased and  is encreasing under the dictates of the Bri∣tish Minister for the evident purpose of repelling the generous energies of liberty  Next to the law of religion the law of the land should be the principal study with a free people A knowledge of the one be∣ing as essential to their temporal interests as a knowledge of the other is to their eternal happiness Wilful ignorance will neither ex∣cuse the soul before the tribunal of the creator nor the person before the judg∣ment seat of the constitution To diffuse legal information is the purpose of this essay it is not written to acquire fame It is written to meet the approbation of the understanding not to amuse the fancy and you will attend to it from respect to the subject on which it treats  It is not in ornaments that the merit of an argument consists In viewing a por∣trait the figure and features are the prin∣cipal objects of contemplation nor can the most elegant drapery or beautiful colouring please the minds eye where the artist de∣viates  from nature and truth The intent will excuse in your minds the blemishes of the performance The opinions if not expressed are conceived in the ardor of pa∣triotism in disinterested love for a commu∣nity where the writer received that life which he thinks can only be well spent in its service  The writer should consider himself pusil∣lanimous and contemptible indeed if in the present contest between the friends of his country and the purchased dependants of the British minister he withheld the lit∣tle contribution of knowledge that his studies have afforded him This is an aera where every honest hand every honest heart and every honest head should unite their ex∣ertions and with "a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together" level to the earth that rotten fabric where despotism holds private counsel with corruption for the treacherous purpose of sapping and overturning the noblest constitution that wis∣dom ever framed or freedom ever de∣fended  The authority delegated by the people to their representatives in parliament has now reverted to its original possessors This then is the time they should be informed how that trust has been executed that they may know who has deserved their appro∣bation who has merited their censure and resentment  Measures militating with the liberty of the subject have been carried into effect by ve∣nal majorities Every proposition brought forward to diminish undue influence to establish oecomy to secure the revenue to vindicate the law and to ease the peo∣ple have been negatived by the same cor∣rect power Oppression has experienced im∣punity the injured have been denied re∣dress and the authority of law and sound reason has been trampled upon by the aggregate force of numbers This then is the time when constitutional knowledge should be deseminated through the land when the principles of legislation and law should be made known to the people at large  This is the time when men who re∣gard the interests of their country who are not equally insensible to the value of their own honour and the good of pos∣terity following the glorious example of your association should with all their pow∣ers promote the spirit of liberty till every heart pervaded by that divine essence which expands the understanding and elates the mind even of the meanest peasant vibrates with ardour and pants to spring forth the guardian of those principles which emanate from the bosom of GodThe protector of those laws which are derived from the immutable decrees of the eternal code laid down by providence and delivered to man at the creation  The moment has scarcely passed since the people of Ireland demanded and acquired the restitution of their rights with arms in their handsThey have laid down their arms and their rights are again in∣vaded Where then are they to find pro∣tection They can only insure it by a strict and firm adherence to those resolu∣tions  which you have formed for their political creed Let the people zealously support the doctrines you have promulged let them not tamely sit down satisfied with the melancholy privilege of complaint let them prove by their spirit in the face of heaven and of the world that by what∣ever right Englishmen possess freedom by the same right Irishmen and all mankind may claim it  The greatest and most distinguishing pro∣perty of mankind is the immortality of his soul and we find the strongest evidence of that immortality in the freedom of his mind which includes the right of declaring all our thoughts In this freewill derived from God originated the liberty of the press that sacred medium through which every freeman who possesses the blessing has a right to declare his opinions on pub∣lic men and on public measures Every unnecessary restraint of the press being then a restraint of the free will of man is an act of tyranny By suppressing the exercise of intellectual liberty slavery has been esta∣blishedby  giving it fair scope freedom has been restored The histories of nations are illustrations of this position and recent proofs are to be found in the fears of Spain and Portugalin the spirit of America and Francein the revolutions of Great Baitain and Ireland  Then let the press exert her powers Notwithstanding the restraints lately laid on her natural vigour she still retains sufficient strength to drag before the people those pusillanimous corrupt and abdicating cul∣prits who deserting from the standard of freedom have enlisted with prostituted mer∣cenaries and war against common sense and the law of the land  The press still retains sufficient ability to hunt from their lurking places and scourge into shame and repentance those adulating and degenerate monsters who point out to every alien plunderer the secret springs the honey and the treasures of the land who have entered into conspiracies with strangers against its legal owners and who  have stripped the laborious peasant and the industrious manufacturer of their fruits and earnings  This is the moment to bring about poli∣tical reformation for extirpating venalityand the press is the most effectual means Was the  constitution  subverted and  tyranny  seated on her throne surrounded by her sycophants her parasites her informers her guards her assassins and her executioners a free press would  restore  the one and  over∣turn  the other  THE ESSAY  IT may be objected that this essay is illtimed as tending to influence the deter∣mination of suits now pending but the ob∣jection is erroneous The questions are not of  law  but of  fact  The determinations lie with  juries  not with  judges  The inquiries on the trials will be merely whether the defendant be  guilty  or not  guilty  of the injury laid in the declaration and if  guilty  what  damages  the plaintiffs have sustained The arguing  points of law  is at all times legal and the points herein discussed are in every respect irrelevant to the merits of the issues which the juries are to try Any man as  amicus curiae  may inform a judge on a  point of law  but no man shall give information to a jury on a fact unless he be a witness previously sworn Earl Mansfield some years ago pro∣hibited the publication of evidence given  against prisoners on examinations before jus∣stices of the peace because the evidence being exparte the publishing of it tended to create an influence against the prisoner which might be injurious to him on trial but no judge ever yet asserted that animadverting on matters of law was illegal and yet in the case of general warrants the press teemed with legal disquisitions  The causes for promulging the law of the land on the discretion of judges in granting fiats and on bail having originated in the suits carried on against Magee the printer it will be frequently necessary to advert to them In doing this however it is not intended to stigmatize with invective or se∣vere imputations the prosecutors or plain∣tiffs The law gives a remedy for every injury and if they suffered or imagined they suffered wrong they had an unques∣tionable right to seek redress from the laws of their country  Magee considered as a private individual is equally an object of indifference This  essay neither takes into consideration his guilt nor his innocence that is the pro∣vince of a jury but the proceedings against him are of the most serious concern to the people every individual of whom are entitled to inquire whether his own rights and liberties have been attacked in the person of his fellow citizen under the sanction of a process issuing from a court of law which by its institution is the guardian and protector of those rights and liberties  The honour of the laws of Ireland its judges and its professors is also materially involved in the ultimate decision upon these proceedings The English bar have treated them with contempt and reprobation It is at this day a common observation in WestminsterHall that "Ireland will soon repent the loss of writs of error and ap∣peal to the courts of England" Must not the pride and sensibility of Irishmen suffer to the quick from the fallacious slander thus indiscriminately thrown upon all the judges and all the barristers of this king∣dom  And must not these sufferings be aggravated in the minds of those who know that unsullied purity extensive know∣ledge and great ability have ever been found at the Irish bar That the bench is radiated by sacred worth spirit and in∣dependence That the law is promulged by judges of inflexible integrity united with intelligent minds fortified by invin∣cible virtue and dispising with equal con∣tempt those accommodating fears which sometimes give temporary popularity and those mean pliabilities which bow and cringe with implicit obedience to the in∣fluence of every administration  Under the torture of those sufferings the writer of this essay with sedulous at∣tention searched the records and reposito∣ries of the law for precedent or princi∣ple upon which he could justify excuse or even palliate those proceedings thus re∣probated in England  What was the consequence  He found that the opinions of the Eng∣lish lawyers so far as they respected ar∣rests by fiat in cases of libels were well grounded and to his great satisfaction he is now convinced that the Irish bar and every independent member of the Irish house of commons maintain the same doctrine and have thereby vindicated the jurisprudence of their country and the an∣cient practice of their courts from wanton and rash aspersions  These extraordinary proceedings thus uni∣versally condemned of course appeared to him as rash and alarming innovations on the indubitable rights of the people They appeared to him as grievances springing from latent motives and tending either to oppress private individuals or to establish precedents for the purpose of coercing the liberty of the press an object that has been repeatedly attempted and too often with success since Mr Pitt has been placed at the head of the British administration though no minister was ever supported by a more licentious abuse of his opponents  The Case of  MAGEE  is this  He has been arrested on fiats or judges warrants and held to special bail in several actions brought against him for publishing libels on private individuals and he has been held to bail in the following sumsfour thou∣sand poundseight hundred poundsone thousand poundsand two thousand pounds making in the whole the sum of seven thou∣sand eight hundred pounds  Now as each bondsman must swear him∣self when justifying his bail worth double the sum for which he becomes bound the bail demanded amounts to thirtyone thou∣sand two hundred pounds and this unfor∣tunate defendant is a private subjectthe printer of a newspaper  Two questions result from this case  FIRST  Were the arrests legal  SECOND  If the arrests were legalwas the special bail demanded of the defendant legal  In answer to these questions it has been asserted  That the right of granting a fiat is with∣in the  discretionary power  of the judge And  That the  quantum  of bail demanded is within the same  discretionary power  It is therefore the purport of this essay to shew that the charges exhibited against the de∣fendant being for libels and the objects of the imputed calumnies private individuals the interference of a judge by fiat in such cases is  unprecedented  the special bail de∣manded of the defendant  excessive  that nei∣ther of those acts of the judge are within the rules of  legal discretion  and that they are both  contrary to the  LAW OF THE LAND  The granting of fiats in any case being discretionary the first point to be discussed  is the nature and legal extent of that power  LORD COKE defines  discretion  thusIt is says that learned jurist to discern between right and wrong shadows and substance equity and colourable glosses and not to do according to our  will  and private  affections  and such discretion is to be  limitted  and  bounded  Inst  Therefore whoever hath power to act at  discretion  is bound by the rule of  reason  and law  Inst  For  justices  must remember that it is  legal discretion  in which in  favour of li∣berty  great  tenderness  is to be usedAnd though there be a latitude of discretion given to one  Hob  yet he is  circumscribed  that what he does be  necessary  and  convenient  without which no liberty no claim to jurisdiction can de∣fend it  For these reasons when the law leaves any thing to any person to be done according to his  discretion  Lit ab  the law intends it must be done with  sound discretion  and  according to  law  And the COURT OF KING'S BENCH hath a power to redress things that are other∣wise done notwithstanding that they are left to the  discretion  of those who do them  The superintending power which the con∣stitution thus reposes in the court of king's bench does not however authorise the judges of that court to exercise an  uncontrol∣led discretion  over the personal liberty of the subject The restrictive rules of  legal discre∣tion  are as binding on the chiefjustice and his brethren whether acting collectively or individually as on any subordinate magis∣trate they are as strictly binding on judges in courts of law as principles and prece∣dents are binding on the chancellor or the barons of the exchequer in the courts of equity  If  discretion  was not thus circumscribed the subject says Lord Coke  Inst  would feel it a  crooked line ruinous to the  personal liberties of the people  Black  whose liberties or rights have never been abridged by the laws of England  Mont S  without sufficient cause  L b c  and can  not ever be abridged at the mere  discretion  of the magistrate without explicit permis∣sion from the laws  Black  The reason of this doctrine is obvious Civil liberty which is the very end and scope of the English constitution rightly understood consists in the power of doing whatever the laws permit which is only to be effected by a general conformity of all orders and degrees to those equitable rules of action  Inst  by which the  meanest individual  is protected from the insults and oppression of the greatest If this was not the case there would be no liberty For as Smith in his Commonwealth of England observes speaking of a court of equity there is as much difference between the  consciences  of men or their  discretion  as between the measure of their feet and as one man may have a longer or shorter foot than another man so may his  conscience  or discretion be more contracted or extensive  If the personal liberty of the subject was not thus protected by the law if the highest  magistrate the KING himself was not thus restricted in the exercise of  discretion  weak or corrupt judges influenced by caprice by resentment by party prejudice or by obsti∣nate ignorance might under pretence of le∣gal authority exercise an  arbitrary power  The fiat or warrant would attack the person of the destined victimThe demand of enormous bail would send him to prison where his sufferings being unknown to the public or if known being soon forgotten inevitable ruin to himself and family would be the consequence Imprisonment is the least public the least striking species of punishment  Arbitrary  power of inflicting it is the most dangerous engine that could be put into the hands of a man inclined to injure the rights of the people Therefore the common law has wisely provided against it by the writ of  habeas corpus  which by a declaratory enacting and penal statute has been made one of the great bulwarks of the peoples' liberties  Happy is it for the subjects of the British and Irish crowns that  judicial discretion  is thus cir∣cumscribed  within the bounds of reason and controled by the rules of law Men of the most consummate knowledge and unbiassed probity are still men Be their judgments ever so acute their hearts ever so uncorrupt yet even too exquisite a sensibility of nature may in some cases misguide the one and pervert the other Affection and prejudice operate strongly in persons of lively sensati∣ons and urge them often to be unjust in those very instances wherein they flatter themselves they are only generous Rare are those talents which constitute a great judicial character It requires a ready and clear ap∣prehension a found distinguishing and exact act judgment a comprehensive understand∣ing freedom and liberality of thought sa∣gacity to investigate the great principles of justice and discernment to see where those principles leadBACON was the wisest chan∣cellor ever sat in a court of equity JEF∣FERIES was a most excellent lawyer but the one was corrupt and the other was cruel Had these men been ignorant would their oppressions have been less  Having shown the nature and legal ex∣tent of discretionary power in judges the next point is  Were the  arrests  in the several suits against Magee for publishing libels legal  The granting of a fiat or judges warrant to hold a defendant to bail is a trust re∣posed in the judges to be exercised only on extraordinary cases of necessity and in what ever case they are granted the greatest delicacy circumspection and precau∣tion should be attended to  A fiat should never be granted in any case but on positive affidavit stating special circumstances of actual loss of mayhem of battery or that the defendant is going to quit the kingdom  Inst  If a person has dangerously wounded another the justice ought to be very cautious how he takes bail till the year and day be past because the defendant is liable to an indictment for murder if the wounded party die within a year and day and the same reason shews  the necessity of granting a warrant to appre∣hend the delinquent besides in cases of actions for mayhem or violent battery the wounds and the blows are possitive proofs of  actual injury  and a breach of the peace The aggressor is therefore held to bail not only to answer the damages but to prevent his flight from justice  When a fiat is applied for on a positive affidavit that the defendant is going to leave the kingdom and the proof of such fact is accompanied with the further proof of spe∣cific damages a fiat is necessary to render such defendant ameanable to justice and the consequences of the suit It is more expeditiously procured than the writ  ne exeat regno  which may be granted in any case  Chanc Cas  where there is danger of subterfuge from the justice of the nation though of private concernment  The law or rather the discretionary power which should rule the conduct of the judge in granting a  ne exeat regno  applies strictly  to the exercise of  legal discretion  in granting a  fiat  LORD CHIEF JUSTICE HOLT says a  ne exeat regno  ought not to be granted  Chanc Cas  but upon great reason and examination otherwise a  homine replegiando  may lie  Farr  In the application for the writ  ne exeat regno  which is a prerogative or state writ no  general averment  though upon  oath  will be held sufficient  The plaintiff applying for a  ne exeat regno  Skinn  is to make positive oath of his  debt  and the writ is always marked for the sum sworn in the affidavit  Chanc C  in words at length and not in figures and the plaintiff swears the defendant is  going out of the kingdom  Mod  which if he should do the  debt  may be lost The order is till answer or further order  Ld Ray  and the party is obliged to give security before the court will discharge the writ which security is taken by recognizance before a master and is in the penalty of what is sworn to be  actually  due and the sheriff takes bail accordingly  Cas in B R  when he arrests the party thereon  S tiles  the sum swom to be due being constantly endorsed on the  ne exeat regno  as a guide for the sheriff to take bail by  From a comparative view of the writ of  ne exeat regno  with a  judges fiat  it appears then that in granting the latter the judge should consider and strictly adhere to the le∣gal rules of  discretion  which are strictly fol∣lowed in granting the former  The  reasons  for granting a fiat should be equally strong The  facts  stated in the affi∣davit should be equally specific and the situa∣tion of the plaintiff his  credibility  and his cause of action should equally entitle him to this extraordinary interference and favour of the judge  Thus in Hilary in the common pleas of England an application was made to Mr Justice Gould to hold a defendant to bail on a breach of promise of marriage The affidavit stated the cause of action that de∣fendant a lady was going to quit the king∣dom  and that plaintiff bad suffered five hun∣dred pounds damages The judge held this affidavit insufficient because plaintiff did not specifically state the cause or causes by which the damages accrued but gave him leave to amend He then swore that at the particu∣lar request of the defendant he sold his com∣mission for five hundred pounds and spent the money on her she having positively pro∣mised him marriage and to purchase him a commission of higher rank and on this af∣fidavit she was held to bail  No man will be so weak or so rash as to assert that the same caution and precission is not necessary in granting a  warrant  at the  discretion  of a judge that the law requires in issuing a  prerogative writ  The latter is a royal  trust  reposed in the king  F N B  which the law does not presume that he will abuse  Lane  or make use of to the prejudice of his subjects  Co C  The former is a delegated trust from the king to his representative  Co  the judge who is sworn to execute it according to law and who is responsible to parliament for his conduct  Having examined the nature and legal extent of  discretionary power  the next ob∣ject is  Whether a defendant can be held to bail for publishing a libel against a private in∣dividual  Magna Charta enacts that no man shall be imprisoned but by judgment of his peers or by the law of the land The imprisonment of Magee has not been by the judgment of his peers Has it been by the law of the land The answer is there is neither law nor practice to sup∣port such a proceeding for the discretion exercised is not within the rules of " sound reason law necessity and convenience"  The definition of a libel shows that it is not an offence for which a defendant should be held to bail even on a crimi∣nal action  A libel is a  misdemeanor  and is esteem∣ed as such not for being a  breach  of the peace but for its direct  tendency  to a breach of the peace by provoking to fight Now the law of England never intended that the subject should be held to bail for any misdemeanor that did not amount to an actual  breach of the peace  Mod  and formerly none could be taken up for a misdemeanor till indictment found  Regina v Tracy Haw  Therefore mere words of passion as liar knave or ras∣cal do not create a  forfeiture of recogni∣zance  to keep the peace for they do not challenge a man to  break  the peace though they  tend  to it from which the reasonable conclusion is that as  slander  does not in∣cur a forfeiture of recognizance for keep∣ing the peace neither is it an offence that can justify a judge in holding a defendant to bail  It may be answered that though bail is not demandable in a criminal prosecution for a libel against a private individual yet the plaintiff may demand it in a civil suit  Those who thus argue are called upon to shew a precedent for holding a defen∣dant to bail on any action for a libel ex∣cept in cases of  scandalum magnatum  or slander of title To make a plaintiff assessor of his owm damages conceived perhaps in a moment of heat or resentment would be to establish the grossest mischief Damages can∣not be ascertained but by verdict of a jury on hearing evidence and in many cases ver∣dicts have been set aside for excess of da∣mages Perjury and oppression would be among the consequences It would be de∣ciding by anticipation on the quantum of damages which the jury should give and on the oath of the plaintiff himself It would be contrary to natural justice and the liberty of the subject by enabling an inhuman plaintiff to imprison a poor friend∣less defendant upon an averment for the space of three terms when upon trial it might appear that he was not guilty of the fact or that what he published was not actionable It would be useless as well as cruel for thus punishing before conviction by fiat when accompanied by excessive bail  would be only a severity known in those countries where private informers are encouraged to prosecute men obnoxious to the state and where torture precedes trial  The following causes lately tried at West∣minster are so many proofs that it is not the practice of the courts there to grant warrants either in criminal or civil sults brought upon libel  These causes were  An information  ex officio  by the  Attorney General  against  Lord George Gordon  for a libel against the  Queen of France  The King  on the prosecution of the  Prince of Wales  against  Walter  Indictment  The King  on the prosecution of the  Duke of York  against  Walter  Indictment  The King  on the prosecution of the  Duke of Clarence  against  Walter  Indict∣ment  Doctor Walcot  against  Walter  An ac∣tion  Lord Loughborough  against  Walter  Two actions  Right Hon William Pitt  against  Perryman  An action  The Attorney General  against  Perryman  Information ex officio  The King  on the prosecution of Mrs  Fitzherbert  against  Doctor Withers  Indict∣ment  The Attorney General  against  Almon  In∣formation ex officio  The Attorney General  against  Stockdale  Information by order of the King on address of the house of commons  The libels in all the above causes except the last were of the most atrocious nature Among the prosecutors and plaintiffs are seen  the most illustrious characters A queen three princes a lord chief justice and a doctor of laws Walter and Withers were convicted and severely punished Lord Loughborough and Mr Pitt recovered da∣mages Perryman and Almon fled and were proceeded against by outlawry yet in none of these prosecutions and suits which  all  ori∣ginated within the last two years was a de∣fendant held to bail or a fiat even demanded  The above cases are proofs sufficient to shew that on prosecution and actions for libels it is not the practice of the court of King's Bench of England to issue such process and it follows that such practice can not be legal here for practice must be consistent with law and the common law of England is by the assent and adoption of the people of Ireland the common law of Ireland  Can it be shewn that EARL MANSFIELD a prerogative judge who extended the law of libels to its utmost stretch ever granted a fiat in the case of a libel Certainly not his lordship well knew it was not within  his  judicial discretion  he well knew there was neither law nor practice to justify the issuing of such a process in such a case To all those therefore who argue in sup∣port of the legal authority to hold defen∣dants to bail for publishing libels may be applied Earl Cambden's requisition to the noble lord above mentioned who in arguing the writ of error brought on the judgment in the King's Bench on literary property said  "Shew me a case"  But supposing a few cases should be shewn in support of practice does it follow that the fiats recently issued against Magee are legal Practice like custom if contrary to law cannot be sanctified by repetition or continuance General warrants were in practice from the revolution down to the th of the present king when after being solemnly argued in the court of Common Pleas and King's Bench they were de∣clared illegal  "The practice of a  particular magistrate  cannot controul the law  Communis error  is not in this case sufficient to make law This is the  duty  and therefore doubtless the  inclination  of the court to stop the mischief as soon as it is com∣plained of"  Case of General Warrants  These were the words of Dunning a great constitutional lawyer  Burr  and they made a proper impression upon the court for in the same case Lord Mansfield said "a  usage  to grow into law ought to be a general usage  Money et al versus Leach  communiter usitata et ap∣probata  and which after a long con∣tinuance it would be mischievous to over∣turn  Burr  and Mr Justice Aston added "  No degree of antiquity  can give sanction to a usage bad in itself"  It may also be advanced that if the judges had not authority to hold libellers to bail justice would be evaded and delinquents escape with impunity But is that the case If the defendant flies process of outlawry issues against him and the voluntary transportation of his person by flight is a severer punishment in the eye of the  law than any the  judicial discretion  of the court can inflict restricted as it now is by the benign prohibition of the bill of rights which declares that by the common law of the land which protects the ancient rights and liberties of the people  Stat W M  excessive bail ought not to be required  c Bollingb abridgm tit Liber∣ty  nor excessive fines im∣posed nor cruel and unusual punish∣ments inflicted  The refusing of bail where it ought to be granted that is in the language of the old law "to withold prisoners repleviable after they have offered sufficient bail"  New ab  is an offence at common law and by statute punishable by  grievous amercement  Inst Hal p c Stat West  and de∣manding bail where it is not demandable must of course appear an offence of equal magnitude  Edw c  as in each case the liberty of the subject is invaded On this legal doctrine much might be saidbut delicacy forbids the argumentthe opinion of Dunning be∣fore stated  pa  will probably be followed  Burr    "It is the  duty  and therefore doubtless the  inclination  of the court to stop the  mis∣chief    of fiats  as soon as it is complained of"  Magna Charta has been mentioned and ma∣ny other old statutes are equally applicable By the of Edward Stat c it is enacted that none shall be taken by  petition  or  sug∣gestion  to the king or his counsel unless it be by  indictment  of lawful people of the neighbourhood or by process made by  origi∣nal writ  at the common law  Ed c  Clear it is that a  fiat  is not an  original writ  and it is equally clear  Ed c  that an averment on oath or general affidavit is merely a  suggestion  to the king or to his judge and re∣presentative and of course that to  take  or imprison a man on such affidavit is illegal These are old statutes but they are living ones the law though it sleeps ne∣ver dies and acquires respect and reverence from antiquity  BISHOP'S CASE though not strictly in point is not irrelevant to this argument  Bishop was held to bail in the sum of two thousand pounds and two sureties of two thousand pounds each But mark the difference between the cases of Bishop and Magee Magee has been held to bail before trial in large sums for publishing libels against obscure individuals  Strange  Bishop was not held to bail till after conviction on an in∣formation for publishing a seditious libel against the state Bishop was not held to bail on an averment or suggestion to a judge Magee has been held to bail on loose affidavits to answer damages estimated by the plaintiffs themselves Bishop was held to bail to suffer the judgment of the court he was committed after conviction of course and being afterwards brought up it was moved he should receive the judgment of the court and be admitted to bail be∣ing in a very ill state of health The chief justice said the offence is so great that an adequate punishment may endanger his life and to lessen the punishment will be an ill precedent therefore bail him for the pre∣sent  Strange    and we will give judgment when he is better  This was administering justice in mercy  In England it is enacted  Stat Geo c  by a statute to prevent frivolous and vexatious suits "that in all cases where the cause of action shall amount to the sum of ten pounds affidavit shall be made and filed of the cause of ac∣tion and the sum or sums specified in such affidavit shall be endorsed on the back of such writ or process for which sum or sums so endorsed the sheriff or other officer to whom such writ or process shall be di∣rected shall take bail and for no more"  This statute though not of legal authori∣ty in this country yet being founded upon reasons and principles of the common law may be fairly cited in argument as may the cases resulting from it  By these cases and several of anterior date  Barnes  it is now an established rule of the courts at Westminster  Strange  that where the affi∣davit of the debt does not positively shew the cause of action and specify the sum due  Wils  the defendant shall be discharged on  common bail  Burr where a great number of cases are cited  which is no more than filing as sureties the names of those wellknown nonentities Messrs John Doe and Richard Roe Indeed so tenacious was the old law of the personal liberty of the subject  Burr  and so cautious was it to discourage litigation that formerly before a plaintiff could ob∣tain a writ to hold a defendant to bail he was obliged to put in two sureties that if he was nonsuit or a verdict given against him he would pay the defendant's costs and damages▪ but this precaution has become obsolete and John Doe and Richard Roe who represent common bail in all cases are now also become the nominal and fic∣titious pledges to prosecute  Where damages are  uncertain  common bail is always taken and there are many cases to this point  In  Reynoldson  v  Blades  Barnes  for covenant broken in the treasury the court said where damages can be reduced to a cer∣tainty as in covenant for payment of money or where a tenant covenants with  his landlord to pay a certain sum for every acre of land he plows up or the like plaintiff is entitled to bail otherwise not for it is not reasonable that defendant should be held to bail for such  damages  as plaintiff  fancies  he has sustained and is  pleased to swear to  In the above case it was also held  Barnes  that the old cases Fleetwood  v  Poictier c are not to be followed  Shaw brought an action of debt against Hawkins on a bond  Shaw a∣gainst Hawkins Barnes notes  wherein defendant was held to bail on plaintiff's affidavit Defen∣dant moved for a common appearance and that plaintiff might produce the bond to the court upon an affidavit that defen∣dant had great reason to believe that the whole sum due was paid by one of his coobligers which would appear by endorse∣ment made on the said bond when pro∣duced Plaintiff in answer made affidavit that a hundred pounds and upwards re∣mained due to him on the bond after all just allowances that he had seen the  bond which was uncancelled and in full force some few months before but had mislaid it and being severely afflicted with the gout could not search among his pa∣pers himself so that it could not be pro∣cured It was urged by the plaintiff that no declaration being yet delivered defen∣dant is not intitled to  oyer  of the bond but after a declaration with a  profert in cur  he was intitled to  oyer  The court held that as the matter of bail is  discre∣tionary  and as the measure of the sum for which bail ought to be given is with  certainty  only to be had from the bond it∣self the bond ought to be produced and for want of producing it a  common appear∣ance  was ordered  Where the question was whether the condition of a bond not appearing upon record bail ought to be required in a court of error  Spinks v Bird Barnes  The court held that matter of bail is properly examinable by affidavit and the bonds being conditioned for per∣formance of covenants bail ought not to be required on a writ of error  Plaintiff made an affidavit  Le W  v Tol∣cher  that defen∣dant had seized and detained his ship to his damage  Barnes  and  a capias ad respondendum  was thereupon endorsed for all without a judge's order  Com Dig  Rule for common appearance and  supersedeas  was made absolute  Sider∣fin  the da∣mages in this case are  uncertain  Compto    Bail  and plain∣tiff was not intitled to bail without a judge's order In  debt assumpsit trover covenant  by  aliam  bail is of course in  trespass detinue  in  special action on the case  or in  covenant at discretion  for WORDS  no  bail unless slander of title  The foregoing cases will all apply as strongly in elucidation of the subsequent part of this essay as they have in sup∣porting the anterior argumentBut if there was not a case or statute in point the question on  fiats  could be decided upon  principles  It is a principle that no man shall be impri∣soned but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the landNow the law of the land will not hold a man to bail for  slanderous words    Magna Charta  and where the law holds a man to bail it must be for a  sum specifically sworn to  and the law of the land forbids that bail to be  excessive  But if the proceedings in the suits against Magee were net prohibited by any positive law nor adjudged illegal by any precedents yet they might be decided to be so upon  principles  and the law of England would be a strange science indeed if it were decided upon  precedent  only Prece∣dents serve to illustrate principles and to give them a fixed certainty but the com∣mon law which is every man's birthright is exclusive of possitive law enacted by statute and depends upon principles Cowper  Having shewn that in actions for  slander  neither the law of the land nor the prac∣tice of the courts justify judges in holding defendants to bail  The next question is  Suppsiong a judge or a court of justice to possess discretionary power to hold a de∣fendant to bail on prosecutions or suits for  libels was the bail in which Magee was held within the rules of that  discretion  and authorized by the law of the land or was it what the law terms  excessive  DALTON and BACON define bail  Dalt New ab  to be an  undertaking  of a  man's friends  before certain persons for that purpose authorized that he shall appear at a certain day and place certain and answer any legal charges exhibited against him  This definition is grounded on that given by Bracton  Lib Tract ca mu  Bail ballium from the French bailler which comes from the Greek  and signifies to deliver into hands is used in our common law for  freeing  or  setting at liberty  one  arrested  or  imprisoned  upon any action either  civil  or  criminal  on surety taken for his appearance at a day and place certain  The reason why it is called  bail  is  Impey's Practice in B R Highmore on Bail  be∣cause by this means in the case of civil actions the party restrained is delivered into the hands of those who bind them∣selves  for his forth coming in order to a  safe keeping or protection from prison  and the end of bail in a civil action is to sa∣tisfy the condemnation and costs or to render the defendant to prison  In all civil actions whereon bail may be taken  See the cases al∣ready cited  there shall be a positive affidavit of the cause of action and no  averment  of damages is sufficient though on oath to hold a defendant to bail If a judge will however take upon him to exceed his  judicial discretion  and hold a defendant to bail upon an averment of damages whereby he allows the plaintiff to assess his own satisfaction which is clearly the exclu∣sive right of a jury he should take care that the estimate of the plaintiff be not so  high  as to  imprison  the defendant but so  low  as not to prohibit what the law allows him  "protection from prison"  for this would be tant amount to  withholding  of bail  In criminal cases bail is not only the means of  giving liberty  to the prisoner but  at the same time secures the extent of the law to punish an offender and as it is the  undertaking of a man's friends  for the purpose of his appearing to take his trial or be dealt with according to law therefore bail de∣manded at the  discretion  of the judge should always bear a relation to the defendant's situation in life as well as to the offence charged upon him for should the bail be excessive the defendant is precluded from that  "undertaking of his friends"  which the law allows "to protect him from pri∣son and the judge does not act according to the rules of  law and sound reason  which are the guides to  judicial discretion  The law by which bail is regulated in criminal and civil actions appears clearly to be founded on the same principles and to have the same great object in view  "the liberty of the subject"  It never was intended that a man should be imprisoned for  damages  till those damages were  assessed by a jury  or for an  offence  till  convicted by his country  unless that offence was of such enormity and notoriety that the four walls  of a prison only could be considered certain security for his person  What is  excessive  bail  New Ab Dalt Hawk pc Hal p c  may easily be col∣lected from the established law of the land It is said not to be usual for the King'sBench to bail a man on a  habeas corpus  on a commitment for treason or felony without four sureties and the sum in which the sureties are to be bound ought never be less than forty pounds for a  capital crime  and in all felonies there should be two sureties but it may be higher in  dis∣cretion  on consideration of the ability and quality of the prisoner and the nature of the offence  Now it appears from the above authori∣ties that if bail is to be taken at all for a libel which considered as an offence is not a  breach of the peace  but only a misde∣meanor  tending  to a breach of it that the  least  bail which the law allows in cases of treason and felony is the  greatest  that the  discretion  of the court can legally demand  for such a species of misdemeanor particu∣larly where the libel is against a private individual not against a peer or against the state  The bail demanded from Magee in the different actions for slander has been stated at the enormous sums of four thousand pounds one thousand pounds eight hun∣dred pounds and two thousand pounds  Let us see if such demands be consistent with the COMMON LAW  Let us see if it be prohited by the STA∣TUTE LAW  These two points may be examined to∣gether  The COMMON LAW lays it down that justices must take care  Hawk p c  that under pretence of demanding  sufficient surety  they do not make so  excessive a demand  as in effect to amount to a  denial of bail  And in support  of this doctrine a long string of cases might be produed a few however will be suffi∣cient as the great principles of bail are to be found in the  petition of rights  and  the habeas corpus act  But it is to be ob∣served that in those cases even where the offences charged upon the defendant have been enormous as actions for Mayhem for violent and cruel batteries  Barnes Notes  for malicious prosecutions c no bail has been demand∣ed that bears the least proportion to the smallest sum demanded from Magee  See the old acts cited in p Stat Wm and Mary c  The STATUTE LAW after recognizing the oppressions of a tyrannical government prohibits the demand of excessive bail as a  grievance  and it was one of those com∣plained of by the people and provided against by the legislature at the revolution in the ever memorable bill of rights  If it be said the bill of rights only re∣spects criminal prosecutions the answer is it is a statute declaratory of the common law but if it was not acts of parliament shall be taken with  latitude  and extended  to cases within the same  reason  Barnes  and calling for the  same remedy  The nature of the case  Raymer v Bur∣rough  and the intent of the legislature are to be considered so in the construction of the English statutes the and of W  Plowed Lord Zouch's case  and Geo c the court of common pleas held both that as statutes were made in favour of the liberty of the subject  Co Litt b Co b Beausa∣ges case  they may stand together Now whatever  reason  can be shewn against demanding excessive bail on criminal prosecutions  Plowd  acquires strength when applied against such a demand  Iston v Studd  by the  fiat  of a judge in a civil suit wherein the damages  Plowd  are undetermined  Platt v the She∣riffs of London  wherein the cause of action may be justified or wherein no damages whatever may be given  Brooke tit Parli∣ament  but on the contrary a verdict may be found for the plaintiff To prevent  excessive bail  is the  reason  on which the prohibitory statutes were founded  Went∣worth's Office of executors  civil suits were not specified merely because the grievance now complained of was not then known  Sir Tho∣mas Jones  but they are with∣in the  principle  of the statutes and of course within their  prohibition  and relief  Plomer v Witch∣cot  In England the principles of these statutes have been constantly kept alive LORD MANS∣FIELD well knew that the spirited people of that country were more tenacious of the sacred privileges of person than of any other right or liberty the constitution gives them and therefore his lordship always set his face against  excessive bail  and against  excessive damages  When MR LAURENS the American was brought before the court of King'sBench on a charge of high treason his friends made a voluntary tender of one hundred thousand pounds bail Lord Mansfield refus∣ed to receive such bail which he termed enormous and considered unconstitutional and ordered the recognizance to be made out for such a sum as was proportioned to the offence charged upon the prisoner his rank and situation in life  The opinion of Mr Attorney General of Ireland Wolfe delivered in the house of commons on Mr Ponsonby's motion coin∣cides with that of Lord Mansfield in the  case of Mr Laurens That learned gentle∣man  News pa∣per report of the de∣bate  then declared "that he did not think a  man's ability to give large bail was a justification for demanding it"    In SIR THOMAS RUMBOLD'S case  Parl Reg of Eng by De∣brett  a bill was brought into the house of commons by Mr Henry Dundass then lord advocate of  Scotland  to restrain Sir Thomas from dis∣posing of his property by holding him to bail in the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds  The  English  lawyers were rouzed at this unconstitutional requisition of the  Scotch  ad∣vocate  The ATTORNEY GENERAL said it was a hard case to impound a man's whole estate merely that he should not fly from justice  See defi∣nition of bail ante  The demanding of enormous bail he reprobated in the most pointed terms as amounting in reality to absolute imprisonment because no man under such a rule of bail could  indemnify others to become  security for him  The SOLICITOR GENERAL argued on the same points He insisted that the demand was contrary to the  practice of the courts below  and that to exact excessive bail was a breach of the constitution The law condemned such bail as being cruel by inflicting pu∣nishment on the innocentby imprisoning before conviction men who could procure reasonable bail to enlarge them till the day of trial  MR HASTINGS impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors by the house of com∣mons in the name of the people of Great Britain was only held to ten thousand pounds bail though there could be no doubt of his capability to procure bail to any amount  From what has been advanced then it is clear  That the  judicial discretion  of judges is circumscribed and bound by the rules of law and sound reason  That bail can not be demanded on acti∣ons for slander except in cases of scanda∣lum magnatum or slander of title  That in all cases where fiats are grant∣able there must be a positive affidavit of the cause of action and of the specific damages suffered by the defendant  That the bail demanded in the case of Magee was excessive and  That in civil as well as in criminal ac∣tions a demand of EXCESSIVE BAIL is ILLEGAL  N B The writer of this essay was not present at the arguments in the court of King'sBench in any of the causes against Magee nor was he in the house of com∣mons when the question of fiats and bail came before the representatives of the na∣tion Of the proceedings in the King'sBench he has seen no report Of the arguments in the house of commons he has seen only a newspaper account which however tho'  probably taken down with inaccuracy and printed in haste displays great constitutional and legal abilities To avail himself of other gentlemens genius and learning the writer would have considered mean and un∣fair he has therefore with every possible caution avoided the introduction of any par∣ticular observation or expression used in the report he has seen by the advocates of the people though in principles it will be found he thinks with them and the study of these principles of course led him to the cases by which they are illustrated  FINIS
