 A LETTER FROM THE RIGHT HON EDMUND BURKE TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF PORTLAND ON THE CONDUCT OF THE MINORITY IN PARLIAMENT CONTAINING  Fiftyfour Articles of Impeachment  AGAINST THE RIGHT HON C J FOX  FROM THE ORIGINAL COPY IN THE POSSESSION OF THE NOBLE DUKE  DUBLIN PRINTED BY J CHAMBERS NO ABBEYSTREET  LETTER c  MY LORD  APPROACHING towards the close of a long period of public services it is natural I should be desirous to stand well I hope I do stand tolerably well with that public which with whatever fortune I have endeavoured faithfully and zealously to serve  I am also not a little anxious for some place in the estimation of the two persons to whom I address this paper I have always acted with them and with those whom they represent To my knowledge I have not deviated no not in the minutest point from their opinions and principles Of late without any alteration in their sentiments or in mine a difference of a very unusual nature and which under the circumstances it is not easy to describe has arisen between us  In my journey with them through life I met Mr Fox in my road and I travelled with him very chearfully as long as he appeared to me to pursue the same direction with those in whose company I set out In the latter stage of our progress a new scheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world which either dazzled his imagination or was suited to some new walks of ambition which were then opened to his view The whole frame and fashion of his politics appear to have suffered about that time a very material alteration It is about three years since in consequence of that extraordinary change that after a pretty long preceding period of distance coolness and want of confidence if not total alienation on his part a complete public separation has been made between that Gentleman and me Until lately the breach between us appeared reparable I trusted that time and reflection and the decisive experience of the mischiefs which have flowed from the proceedings and the system of France on which our difference had arisen as well as the known sentiments of the best and wisest of our common friends upon that subject would have brought him to a safer way of thinking Several of his friends saw no security for keeping things in a proper train after this excursion of his but in the reunion of the party on its old grounds under the Duke of Portland Mr Fox if he pleased might have been comprehended in that system with the rank and consideration to which  his great talents entitle him and indeed secure to him in any party arrangement that  could  be made The Duke of Portland knows how much I wished for and how earnestly I laboured that reunion and upon terms that might every way be honourable and advantageous to Mr FoxHis conduct in the last session has extinguished these hopes for ever  Mr Fox has lately published in print a defence of his conduct On taking into consideration that defence a society of gentlemen called the Whig Club thought proper to come to the following resolution  "That their confidence in Mr Fox is confirmed strengthened and encreased by the calumnies against him"  To that resolution my two noble friends the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam have given their concurrence  The calumnies supposed in that resolution can be nothing else than the objections taken to Mr Fox's conduct in this session of parliament for to them and to them alone the resolution refers I am one of those who have publicly and strongly urged those objections I hope I shall be thought only to do what is necessary to my justification thus publicly solemnly and heavily censured by those whom I most value and esteem when I firmly contend that the objections which I with many other of the friends to  the Duke of Portland have made to Mr Fox's conduct are not  calumnies  but founded on truth that they are not  few  but many and that they are not  light and trivial  but in a very high degree serious and important  That I may avoid the imputation of throwing out even privately any loose random imputations against the public conduct of a Gentleman for whom I once entertained a very warm affection and whose abilities I regard with the greatest admiration I will put down distinctly and articulately some of the matters of objection which I feel to his late doctrines and proceedings trusting that I shall be able to demonstrate to the friends whose good opinion I would still cultivate that not levity nor caprice nor less defensible motives but that very grave reasons influence my judgment I think that the spirit of his late proceedings is wholly alien to our national policy and to the peace to the prosperity and to the legal liberties of this nation  according to our ancient domestic and appropriated mode of holding them    Viewing things in that light my confidence in him is not encreased but totally destroyed by those proceedings I cannot conceive it a matter of honour or duty but the direct contrary in any member of parliament to continue a systematic opposition for the purpose of putting Government under difficulties until Mr Fox  with all his present ideas shall have the principal direction of affairs placed in his hands and until the present body of administration with their ideas and measures is of course overturned and dissolved  To come to particulars  The laws and constitution of the kingdom entrust the sole and exclusive right of treating with foreign potentates to the King This is an undisputed part of the legal prerogative of the Crown However notwithstanding this Mr Fox without the knowledge or participation of any one person in the House of Commons with whom he was bound by every party principle in matters of delicacy and importance confidentially to communicate thought proper to send Mr Adair as his representative and with his cypher to St Petersburgh there to frustrate the objects for which the Minister of the Crown was authorized to treatHe succeeded in this his design and did actually frustrate the King's Minister in some of the objects of his negociation  This proceeding of Mr Fox does not as I conceive amount to absolute high treason Russia though on bad terms not having been then declaredly at war with this kingdom But such a proceeding is in law not very remote from that offence and is undoubtedly a most unconstitutional  act and an high treasonable misdemeanour  The ligitimate and sure mode of communication between this nation and foreign powers is rendered uncertain precarious and treacherous by being divided into two channels one with a Government one with the head of a party in opposition to that Government by which means the foreign powers can never be assured of the real authority or validity of any public transaction whatsoever  On the other hand the advantage taken of the discontent which at that time prevailed in parliament and in the nation to give to an individual an influence directly against the government of his country in a foreign Court has made a highway into England for the intrigues of foreign Courts in our affairs This is a sore evil an evil from which before this time England was more free than any other nation Nothing can preserve us from that evilwhich connects cabinet factions with popular factions here and abroadbut the keeping sacred the Crown as the only channel of communication with every other nation  This proceeding of Mr Fox has given a strong countenance and an encouraging example to the doctrines and practices of the Revolution and Constitutional societies and of other mischievous  societies of that description who without any legal authority and even without any corporate capacity are in the habit of proposing and to the best of their power of forming leagues and alliances with France This proceeding which ought to be reprobated on all the general principles of Government is in a more narrow view of things not less reprehensible it tends to the prejudice of the whole of the Duke of Portland's late party by discrediting the principles upon which they supported Mr Fox in the Russian business as if they of that party also had proceeded in their Parliamentary opposition on the same mischievous principles which actuated Mr Fox in sending Mr Adair on his embassy  Very soon after his sending this embassy to Russia that is in spring of a Covenanting Club or Association calling itself by the ambitious and invidious title of  "The Friends of the People"  it was composed of many of Mr Fox's own most intimate personal and party friends joined to a very considerable part of the members of those mischievous associations called the Revolution Society and the Constitutional Society Mr Fox must have been well apprized of the progress of that Society in every one of its steps if not of the very origin of it I certainly was informed of both who had no connection with the design directly or indirectly His influence over the persons who composed the leading part of that Association was and is unbounded I hear that  he expressed some disapprobation of this Club in one case that of Mr St John when his consent was formerly asked Yet he never attempted seriously to put a stop to the Association or to disavow it or controul check or modify it in any way whatsoever if he had pleased without difficulty he might have suppressed it in its beginning but he encouraged it in every part of its progress at that particular time when Jacobin Clubs under the very same or similar titles were making such dreadful havock in a country not thirty miles from the court of England and when every motive of moral prudence called for the discouragement of Societies formed for the encrease of popular pretensions to power and direction  When the proceedings of this Society of the Friends of the People as well as others acting in the same spirit had caused a very serious alarm in the mind of the Duke of Portland and of many good patriots he publicly in the House of Commons treated their apprehensions and conduct with the greatest asperity and ridicule He condemned and vilifyed in the most insulting and outrageous terms the Proclamation issued by Government on that occasionthough he well knew that it had passed through the Duke of Portland's hands that it had received his fullest approbation and that it was the result of an actual interview between that noble Duke and Mr Pitt During the discussion of its merits in the House of Commons Mr Fox countenanced and justifyed  the chief promoters of that Association and he received in return a public assurance from them of an inviolable adherence to him singly and personally On account of this proceeding a very great number I presume to say not the least grave and wise part of the Duke of Portland's friends in Parliament and many out of Parliament who are of the same description have become separated from that time to this from Mr Fox's particular cabal very few of which cabal are or ever have so much as pretended to be attached to the Duke of Portland or to pay any respect to him or to his opinions  At the beginning of this session when the sober part of the nation were a second time generally and justly alarmed at the progress of the French arms on the Continent and at the spreading of their horrid principles and cabals in England Mr Fox did not as had been usual in cases of far less moment call together any meeting of the Duke of Portland's friends in the House of Commons for the purpose of taking their opinion on the conduct to be pursued in Parliament at that critical juncture He concerted his measures if with any persons at all with the friends of Lord Lansdown and those calling themselves friends of the people and others not in the smallest degree attached to the Duke of Portland by which conduct he willfully gave up in my opinion all pretensions to be considered of that party and much more of being considered as the  leader and the mouth of it in the House of Commons This could not give much encouragement to those who had been separated from Mr Fox on account of his conduct on the first proclamation to rejoin that party  Not having consulted any of his party in the House of Commons and not having consulted them because he had reason to know that the course he had resolved to pursue would be highly disagreeable to them he represented the alarm which was a second time given and taken in still more invidious colours than those in which he painted the alarm of the former year He described those alarms in this manner altho' the cause of them was then grown far less equivocal and far more urgent He even went so far as to treat the supposition of the growth of a Jacobin spirit in England as a libel on the nation As to the danger from  abroad  on the first day of the session he said little or nothing on that subject He contented himself with defending the ruling factions in France and with accusing the public councils of this kingdom of every sort of evil design on the liberties of the people declaring distinctly strongly and precisely that the whole danger of the nation was from the growth of the power of the crown The policy of this declaration was obvious It was in subservience to the general plan of disabling us to take any steps against France To counteract the alarm given by the progress of Jacobin arms and principles  he endeavoured to excite an opposite alarm concerning the growth of the power of the crown If the alarm should prevail he knew that the nation never would be brought by arms to oppose the growth of the Jacobin empire because it is obvious that war does in its very nature necessitate the Commons considerably to strengthen the hands of government and if that strength should itself be the object of terror we could have no war  In the extraordinary and violent speeches of that day he attributed all the evils which the public had suffered to the proclamation of the preceding summer though he had spoke in the presence of the Duke of Portland's own son the Marquis of Litchfield who seconded the address on that proclamation and in the presence of the Duke of Portland's brother Lord Edward Bentinck and several others of his best friends and nearest relations  On that day that is on the th of December he proposed an amendment to the address which stands on the journals of the House and which is perhaps the most extraordinary record which ever did stand upon them To introduce this amendment he not only struck out part of the proposed address which alluded to insurrection upon the ground of the objections which he took to the legality of the calling together Parliament objections which I must ever  think litigious and sophistical but he likewise struck out that  part which related to the cabals and conspiracies of the French faction in England  altho' their practices and correspondences were of public notoriety Mr Cooper and Mr Watt had been deputed from Manchester to the Jacobins These ambassadors were received by them as British representatives other deputations of English had been received at the bar of the National Assembly they had gone the length of giving supplies to the Jacobin armies and they in return had received promises of military assistance to forward their designs in England a regular correspondence for fraternizing the two nations had also been carried on by societies in London with a great number of the Jacobin societies in France this correspondence had also for its object the pretended improvements of the British constitution What is the most remarkable and by much the more mischievous part of his proceedings that day Mr Fox likewise struck out every thing in the address which  related to the tokens of ambition given by France her aggressions upon our allies and the sudden and dangerous growth of her power upon every side  and instead of all those weighty and at that time necessary matters by which the House of Commons was in a crisis such as perhaps Europe never stood to give assurances to our allies strength to our government and a check to the common enemy of Europe he substituted nothing but a criminal charge on the conduct of the British government for calling Parliament together  and an engagement to enquire into that conduct  If it had pleased God to suffer him to proceed in this his project for the amendment to the address he would for ever have ruined this nation along with the rest of Europe At home all the Jacobin societies formed for the utter destruction of our Constitution would have lifted up their heads which had been beaten down by the two proclamations These societies would have been infinitely strengthened and multiplied in every quarter their dangerous foreign communications would have been left abroad and open the crown would not have been authorised to take any measure whatever for our immediate defence by sea or land The closest the most natural from many internal as well as external circumstances the weakest of our allies Holland would have been given up bound hand and foot to France just on the point of invading that republic A general consternation would have seized upon all Europe and all alliance with every other power except France would have been for ever rendered impracticable to us I think it impossible for any man who regards the dignity and safety of his country or indeed the common safety of mankind ever to forget Mr Fox's proceedings in that tremendous crisis of all human affairs  Mr Fox very soon had reason to be apprized of the general dislike of the Duke of Portland's  friends to his conduct Some of those who had even voted with him the day after their vote expressed their abhorrence of his amendment their sense of its inevitable tendency and their total alienation from the principles and maxims upon which it was made yet the very next day that is on Friday the th of December he brought on what in effect was the very same business and on the same principles a  second  time  Although the House does not usually fit on Saturday he a  third  time brought on another proposition in the same spirit and pursued it with so much heat and perseverance as to fit into Sunday a thing not known in Parliament for many years  In all these motions and debates he wholly departed from all the political principles relative to France considered merely as a state and independent of its Jacobin form of government which had hitherto been held fundamental in this country and which he had himself held more strongly than any man in Parliament He at that time studiously separated himself from those to whose sentiments he used to profess no small regard altho' those sentiments were publicly declared I had then no concern in the party having been for some time with all outrage excluded from it but on general principles I must say that a person who assumes to be leader of a party composed of freemen and of gentlemen ought to pay some degree of deference to their feelings and  even to their prejudices He ought to have some degree of management for their credit and influence in their country He shewed so very little of this delicacy that he compared the alarm raised in the minds of the Duke of Portland's party which was his own an alarm in which they sympathized with the greater part of the nation to the panic produced by the popish plot in the reign of Charles the seconddescribing it to be as that was a contrivance of knaves and believed only by well meaning dupes and madmen  The Monday following the th of December he pursued the same conductThe means used in England to cooperate with the Jacobin army in politics agreed that is the mischievous writings circulated with much industry and success as well as the seditious clubs at that time added not a little to the alarm taken by observing and wellinformed men The writings and the clubs were two evils which marched together Mr Fox discovered the greatest possible disposition to countenance the one as well as the other of these two grand instruments of the French system He would hardly consider any writing whatsoever as a libel or as a fit object of prosecution At a time in which the press has been the grand instrument of the subversion of order of morals of religion and I may say of human society itself to carry the doctrines of its  liberty higher than ever it has been known by in most extravagant asserters in France gave occasion to very serious reflections Mr Fox treated the association for prosecuting those libels as tending to prevent the improvements of the human mind and as a mobbish tyranny He thought proper to compare them with the riotous assemblies of Lord George Gordon in declaring that he had advised his friends in Westminster to sign the association whether they agreed to them or not in order that they might avoid destruction to their persons or their houses or a desertion of their shops This insidious advice tended to confound those who wished well to the object of the association with the seditious against whom the association was directed By this stratagem the confederacy intended for preserving the British constitution and the public peace would be wholly defeated The Magistrates utterly incapable of distinguishing the friends from the enemies of order would in vain look for support when they stood in the greatest need of it  Mr Fox's whole conduct on this occasion was without example The very morning after these violent declamations in the House of Commons against the association that is on Tuesday the th he went himself to a meeting of St George's Parish and there signed an association of the nature and tendency of those he had the night before so vehemently condemned and  several of his particular and most intimate friends inhabitants of that parish attended and signed along with him  Immediately after this extraordinary step and in order perfectly to defeat the ends of that association against Jacobin publications which contrary to his opinions he had promoted and signed a mischievous society was formed under his auspices called the  Friends of the Liberty of the Press  Their title groundlessly insinuated that the freedom of the Press had lately suffered or was now threatened with some violation This Society was only in reality another modification of a Society calling itself the  Friends of the People  which in the preceding summer had caused so much uneasiness in the Duke of Portland's mind and in the minds of several of his friends This new Society was composed of many if not most of the Members of the Club of the  Friends of the People  with the addition of a vast multitude of others such as Mr Horne Tooke of the worst and most seditious dispositions that could be sound in the whole kingdom In the first meeting of this Club Mr Erskine took the lead and directly without any disavowal ever since on Mr Fox's part  made use of his name and authority in favour of its formation and purposes  In the same meeting Mr Erskine had thanks for his defence of  Paine  which amounted to a complete avowal of that Jacobin incendiary else it is impossible how  Mr Erskine should have deserved such marked applauses for acting merely as a Lawyer for his fee in the ordinary course of his profession  Indeed Mr Fox appeared the general patron of all such persons and proceedings When Lord Edward Fitzgerald and other persons for practices of the most dangerous kind in Paris and in London were removed from the King's Guards Mr Fox took occasion in the House of Commons heavily to censure that act as unjust and oppressive and tending to make officers bad citizens There were few however who did not call for some such measures on the part of Government as of absolute necessity for the King's personal safety as well as that of the public and nothing but the mistaken lenity with which such practices were rather discountenanced than punished could possibly deserve reprehension in what was done with regard to those gentlemen  Mr Fox regularly and systematically and with a diligence long unusual to him did every thing he could to countenance the same principle of fraternity and connection with the Jacobins abroad and the National Convention of France for which those officers had been removed from the Guards For when a Bill feeble and lax indeed and far short of the vigour required by the conjuncture was brought in for removing out of the kingdom the emissaries of  France Mr Fox opposed it with all his might He pursued a vehement and detailed opposition to it through all its stages describing it as a measure contrary to the existing treaties between Great Britain and France as a violation of the law of Nations and as an outrage on the Great Charter itself  In the same manner and with the same heat he opposed a bill which though aukward and artful in its construction was right and wise in its principle and was precedented in the best times and absolutely necessary at that juncture I mean the Traiterous Correspondence bill By these means the enemy rendered infinitely dangerous by the links of real faction and pretended commerce would have been had Mr Fox succeeded enabled to carry on the war against us by our own resources For this purpose that enemy would have its agents and traitors in the midst of us  When at length war was actually declared by the usurpers in France against this kingdom and declared whilst they were pretending a negociation through Dumourier with Lord Auckland Mr Fox continued through the whole of the proceeding to discredit the national honour and justice and to throw the entire blame of the war on Parliament and on his own country as acting with violence haughtiness and want of equity He frequently asserted both at the time and ever  since that the war though declared by France was provoked by us and that it was wholly unnecessary and fundamentally unjust He has lost no opportunity of railing in the most virulent manner and in the most unmeasured language against every foreign power with whom we could now or at any time contract any useful or effectual alliance against France declaring that he hoped that no alliance with these powers was made or was in a train of being made  It is an exception that in one of his last speeches but not before Mr Fox seemed to think an alliance with Spain might be proper  He always expressed himself with the utmost horror concerning such alliances so did all his phalanx Mr Sheridan in particular after one of his invectives against thofe powers sitting by him said with manifest marks of his approbation that if we must go to war he would rather go to war alone than with such allies  Immediately after the French declaration of war against us Parliament addressed the king in support of the war against them as just and necessary and provoked as well as formally declared against Great Britain He did not divide the House upon this measure yet he immediately followed this our solemn Parliamentary engagement to the king with a motion proposing a set of resolutions the effect of which was that the  two Houses were to load themselves with every kind of reproach for having made the address which they had just carried to the throne He commenced this long string of criminatory resolutions against his country if King Lords and Commons of Great Britain and a decided majority without doors are his country  with a declaration against intermeddling in the interior concerns of France  The purport of this resolution of noninterference is a thing unexampled in the history of the world when one nation has been actually at war with another The best writers on the law of nations give no sort of countenance to this doctrine of noninterference in the extent and manner in which he used it  even when there is no war  When the war exists not one authority is against it in all its latitude His doctrine is equally contrary to the enemy's uniform practice who whether in peace or in war makes it her great aim not only to change the Government but to make an entire revolution in the whole of the social order in every country  The object of the last of this extraordinary string of resolutions moved by Mr Fox was to advise the Crown not to enter into such an engagement with any foreign power so as to hinder us from making a  separate  peace with France or which might tend to enable any of those powers to introduce in that country a Government other than such as those persons whom  he calls The People of France should choose to establish In short the whole of these resolutions appeared to have but one driftnamely the sacrifice of our own domestic dignity and safety and the independency of Europe to the support of this strange mixture of anarchy and tyranny which prevails in France and which Mr Fox and his party were pleased to call a Government The immediate consequences of these measures was by an example the ill effects of which on the whole world are not to be calculated to secure the robbers of the innocent nobility gentry and ecclesiastics of France the enjoyment of the spoil they have made of the estates houses and goods of their fellowcitizens  Not satisfied with moving these resolutions tending to confirm this horrible tyranny and robbery and with actually dividing the House on the first of the long string which they composed in a few days afterwards he encouraged and supported Mr Grey in producing the very same strings in a new form and in moving under the shape of an address of Parliament to the Crown another virulent libel on all its own proceedings in this session in which not only all the ground of the resolutions was again travelled over but much new inflammatory matter was introduced In particular a charge was made that Great Britain had not interposed to  prevent the last partition of Poland On this head the party dwelt very largely and very vehemently Mr Fox's intention in the choice of this extraordinary topic was evident enough He well knows two things first that no wise or honest man can approve of that partition and without prognosticating great mischief from it to all countries at some future time Secondly he knows quite as well that let our opinions on that partition be what they will England by itself is not in a situation to afford to Poland any assistance whatsoever The purpose of the introduction of Polish politics into this discussion was not for the sake of Poland it was to throw an odium upon those who are obliged to decline the cause of justice from their impossibility of supporting a cause which they approve as if we who think more strongly on this subject than he does were of a party against Poland because we are obliged to act with some of the authors of that injustice against our common enemy France But the great and leading purpose of this introduction of Poland into the debates on the French war was to direct the public attention from what was in our power that is from a steady cooperation against France to a quarrel with the allies for the sake of a Polish war which for any useful purpose to Poland he knew it was out of our power to make If England can touch Poland ever so remotely it must be through the medium of alliances  But by attacking all the combined powers together for their supposed unjust aggression upon France he bound them by a new common interest not seperately to join England for the rescue of Poland The proposition could only mean to do what all the papers of his party in the Morning Chronicle have aimed at persuading the public to through the whole of the last autumn and winter and to this hour that is to an alliance with the Jacobins of France for the pretended purpose of succouring PolandThis curious project would leave to Great Britain no other ally in all Europe except its old enemy France  Mr Fox after the first day's discussion on the question for the address was at length driven to admit to admit rather than to urge and that very faintly that France had discovered ambitions views which none of his partizans that I recollect Mr Sheridan excepted did however either urge or admit What is remarkable enough all the points admitted against the Jacobins was brought to bear in their favour as much as those in which they were defended But when Mr Fox admitted that the conduct of the Jacobins did discover ambition he always ended his admission of their ambitious views by an apology for them insisting that the universally hostile disposition shewn to them rendered their ambition a sort of defensive policy  Thus whatever road he travelled they all terminated in recommending a recognition of their pretended Republic and in the plan of sending an ambassador to it This was the burden of all his song  "Every thing that he could reasonably hope from war would be obtained from treaty"  It is to be observed however that in all these debates Mr Fox never once stated to the House upon what ground it was he conceived that all the objects of the French system of united fanaticism and ambition would instantly be given up whenever England should think fit to propose a treaty On proposing so strange a recognition and so humiliating an embassy as he moved he was bound to produce his authority if any authority he had He ought to have done this the rather because Le Brun in his first proportions and in his answers to Lord Grenville defended  on principle not on temporary convenience  every thing which was objected to France and shewed not the smallest disposition to give up any one of the points to discussion Mr Fox must also have known that the Convention had passed to the order of the day on a proposition to give some sort of explanation or modification to the hostile decree of the th of November for exciting insurrection in all countries a decree known to be peculiarly pointed at Great Britain The whole proceeding of the French Administration was the most remote that could be imagined  from furnishing any indication of a pacific disposition for at the very time in which it was pretended that the Jacobins entertained those boasted pacific dispositions at the very time in which Mr Fox was urging a treaty with them not content with refusing a modification of the decree for insurrections they published their evermemorable decree of the th of December for disorganizing every country in Europe into which they should on any occasion set their foot and on the th and th of the same month they solemnly and on the last of these days practically confirmed that decree  But Mr Fox had himself taken good care in the negociation he proposed that France should not be obliged to make any very great concession to her presumed moderationfor he laid down one general comprehensive rule with him as he said constant and inviolable This rule in fact would not only have left to the faction in France all the property and power they had usurped at home but most if not all of the conquests which by their attrocious perfidy and violence they had made abroad The principle laid down by Mr Fox is this  "  That every State in the conclusion of a war has a right to avail itself of its conquests towards an indemnification  "  This principle true or false is totally contrary to the policy which this country has pursued with France at various periods particularly at the treaty of Ryswick  in the last century and at the treaty of Aixlachapelle in this whatever the merits of this rule may be in the eyes of neutral judges it is a rule which no Statesmen before him ever laid down in favour of the adverse power with whom he was to negociate The adverse party himself may be safely trusted to take care of his  own  aggrandizement But as if the black boxes of the several parties had been exchanged Mr Fox's English ambassador by some odd mistake would find himself charged with the concerns of France If we were to leave France as she stood at the time when Mr Fox proposed to treat with her that formidable power must have been infinitely strengthened and almost every power in Europe as much weakened by the extraordinary basis which he laid for a treaty For Avignon must go from the Pope Savoy at least from the King of Sardinia if not Nice Liege Mark Salm DeuxPonts and Bale must be separated from Germany On this side of the Rhine Liege at least must be lost to the empire and added to France Mr Fox's general principle covered all this How much of these territories came within his rule he never attempted to define He kept a profound silence as to Germany As to the Netherlands he was something more explicit He said if I recollect right that France on that side might expect something towards strengthening her frontier As to the remaining parts of the Netherlands which he supposed France might consent to surrender he  declared went so far as that England ought not to permit the Emperor to be repossessed of the remainder of the ten Provinces but that  the People  should choose such a form of independent Government as they liked This proposition of Mr Fox was just the arrangement which the usurpation in France had all along proposed to make As the circumstances were at that time and have been ever fince his proposition fully indicated what Government the Flemings  must  have in the stated extent of what was left to them A Government so set up in the Netherlands whether compulsory or by the choice of the SansCulottes who he well knew were to be the real electors and the sole electors in whatever name it was to exist most evidently depend for its existence as it has done for its original formation on France In reality it must have ended in that point to which piece by piece the French were then actually bringing all the Netherlands that is an incorporation with France as a body of new departments just as Savoy and Liege and the rest of their pretended independent popular sovereignties have been united to their republic Such an arrangement must have destroyed Ausria it must have left Holland always at the mercy of France it must totally and for ever cut off all political communication between England and the Continent Such must have been the situation of Europe according to Mr Fox's system of politics however laudable his personal motives may  have been in proposing so completea change in the whole system of Great Britain with regard to all the continental powers  After it had been generally supposed that all publick business was over for the session and that Mr Fox had exhausted all the modes of pressing the French scheme he thought proper to take a step beyond every expectation and which demonstrated his wonderful eagerness and perseverance in his cause as well as the nature and true character of the cause itself This step was taken by Mr Fox immediately after his giving his assent to the grant of supply voted to him by Mr Serjeant Adair and a committee of gentlemen who assumed to themselves to act in the name of the public In the instrument of his acceptance of this grant Mr Fox took occasion to assure them that he would always persevere  in the same conduct  which had procured to him so honourable a mark of the public approbation He was as good as his word  It was not long before an opportunity was found or made for proving the sincerity of his professions and demonstrating his gratitude to those who had given public and unequivocal marks of approbation of his late conduct One of the most virulent of the Jacobin faction Mr Gurney a banker at Norwich had all along distinguished himself by his French politics By  the means of this gentleman and of his associates of the same description one of the most insiduous and dangerous hand bills that ever was seen had been circulated at Norwich against the war drawn up in an hypocritical tone of compassion for the poor This address to the populace of Norwich was to play in concert with an address to Mr Fox was signed by Mr Gurney and the higher order of the French fraternity in that town In this paper Mr Fox is applauded for his conduct throughout the session and requested before the prorogation to make a motion for an immediate peace with France  Mr Fox did not revoke to this suit he readily and thankfully undertook the task assigned to him Not content however with merely falling in with their wishes he proposed a task on his part to the gentlemen of Norwich which was  that they should move the people without doors to petition against the war  He said that without such assistance little good could be expected from any thing he might attempt within the walls of the House of Commons In the mean time to animate his Norwich friends in their endeavours to besiege Parliament he snatched the first opportunity to give notice of a motion which he very soon after made namely to address the Crown to make peace with France The address was so worded as to cooperate with the hand bill in bringing forward matter calculated to inflame the manufacturers throughout the kingdom  In support of his motion he declaimed in the most virulent strain even beyond any of his former invectives against every power with whom we were then and are now acting against France In the  moral  forum some of these powers certainly deserve all the ill he said of them but the  political  effect aimed at evidently was to turn our indignation from France with whom we were at war upon Russia or Prussia or Austria or Sardinia or all of them together In consequece of his knowledge that we  could  not effectually do  without  them and his resolution that we  should  not act  with  them he therefore proposed that having as he asserted  "obtained the only avowed object of the war the evacuation of Holland we ought to conclude an instant peace"  Mr Fox could not be ignorant of the mistaken basis upon which his motion was grounded He was not ignorant that the attempt of Dumourier on Holland so very near succeeding and the navigation of the Scheld a part of the same piece even among the  immediate  causes they were by no means the only causes alledged for Parliament's taking that offence at the proceedings of France for which the Jacobins were so prompt in declaring war upon this kingdom Other full as weighty causes had been alledged They were The general overbearing and desperate ambition of that faction Their actual attacks on every nation in Europe Their usurpation of territories in the empire with the Governments of which they had no pretence of quarrel Their perpetual and irrevocable consolidation with their own dominions of every territory of the Netherlands of Germany and of Italy of which they got a  temporary possession The mischief attending the prevalence of their system which would make the success of their ambitious designs a new and peculiar species of calamity in the world Their formal public decrees particularly those of the th of November and the th and th of December Their notorious attempts to undermine the constitution of this country Their public reception of deputations of traitors for that direct purpose Their murder of their sovereign declared by most of the members of the Convention who spoke with their vote without a disavowal from any to be perpetrated as an example to  all  kings and a precedent for  all  subjects to follow All these and not the Scheld alone or the invasion of Holland were urged by the Minister and by Mr Wyndham by myself and by others who spoke in those debates as causes for bringing France to a sense of her wrong in the war which she declared against us Mr Fox well knew that not one man argued for the necessity of a vigorous resistance to France who did not state the war as being for the very existence of the social order here and every part of Europe who did not state his opinion that this war was not at all a foreign war of Empire but as much for our liberties properties laws and religion and even more so than any we had ever been engaged in This was the war which according to Mr Fox and Mr Gurney we were to abandon before the enemy had felt in the slightest degree the impression of our arms  Had Mr Fox's disgraceful proposal been complied with this kingdom would have been stained with a blot of perfidy hitherto without an example in our history and with far less excuse  than any act of perfidy which we find in the history of any nation The moment when by the incredible exertions of Austria very little through ours the temporary deliverance of Holland in effect our own deliverance had been atchieved he advised the House instantly to abandon her to that very enemy from whose arms she had freed ourselves and the closest of our allies  But we are not to be imposed on by forms of language We must act on the substance of things To abandon Austria in this manner was to abandon Holland itself For suppose France encouraged and strengthened as she must have been by our treacherous desertion suppose France I say to succeed against Austria as she had succeeded the very year before England would after its disarmament have nothing in the world but the inviolable faith of Jacobinism and the steady politics of anarchy to depend upon against France's renewing the very same attempts upon Holland and renewing them considering what Holland was and is with much better prospects of success Mr Fox must have been well aware that were we to break with the greater Continental Powers and particularly to come to a rupture with them in the violent and intemperate mode in which he would have made the breach the defence of Holland against a foreign enemy and a strong domestic faction must hereafter rest solely upon England without the chance of a single ally either on that or on any other occasion So far as to the pretended sole object of the war which Mr Fox supposed to be so completely obtained but which then was not at all and at this day is not completely obtained as to leave us nothing else to do than to cultivate a peaceful quiet correspondence with those quiet  peaceable and moderate people the Jacobins of France  To induce us to this Mr Fox laboured hard to make it appear that the powers with whom we acted were full as ambitious and as perfidious as the French This might be true as to  other  nations They had not however been so to  Us  or to Holland He produced no proof of active ambition and ill faith against Austria But supposing the combined powers had been all thus faithless and had been all alike so there was one circumstance which made an essential difference between them and France I need not be at the trouble of contesting this point which however in this latitude and as at all affecting Great Britain and Holland I deny utterly Be it so But the great monarchies have it in their power to keep their faith  if they please  because they are governments of established and recognized authority at home and abroad France had in reality no government The very factions who exercised power had no stability The French Convention had no power of peace or war Supposing the Convention to be free most assuredly it was not they had shewn no disposition to abandon their projectsThough long driven out of Leige it was not many days before Mr Fox's motion that they still continued to claim it as a country which their principles of fraternity bound them to protect that is to subdue and to regulate at their pleasure That party which Mr Fox inclined most to favour and trust and from which he must have received his assurances if any he did receive that is the  Brissotins  were then either prisoners or fugitives The party which prevailed over them that of Danton and Marat was itself in a tottering condition and was disowned by a very great part of France To say  nothing of the Royal party who were powerful and growing and who had full as good a right to claim to be the legitimate Government as any of the Parisian factions with whom he proposed to treator rather as it seemed to me to surrender at discretion  But when Mr Fox began to come from his general hopes of the moderation of the Jacobins to particulars he put the case that they might not perhaps be willing to surrender Savoy He certainly was not willing to contest that point with them but plainly and explicitly as I understood him proposed to let them keep it though he knew or he was much worse informed than he would be thought that England had at the very time agreed on the terms of a treaty with the King of Sardinia of which the recovery of Savoy was the  Casus Federis  In the teeth of this treaty Mr Fox proposed a direct and most scandalous breach of our faith formally and recently given But to surrender Savoy was to surrender a great deal more than so many square acres of land or so much revenue In its consequences the surrender of Savoy was to make a surrender to France of Switzerland and Italy of both which countries Savoy is the keyas it is known to ordinary speculators in politics though it may not be known to the weavers of Norwich who it seems are by Mr Fox called to be the judges in this matter  A sure way indeed to encourage France not to make a surrender of this key of Italy and Switzerland or of Mayence the key of Germany or of any other object whatsoever which she holds is to let her see  that the people of England raise a clamour against the war before terms are so much as proposed on any side  From that moment the Jacobins  would be masters of the termsThey would know that Parliament at all hazards would force the King to a separate peace The crown could not in that case have any use of its judgment Parliament could not possess more judgment than the crown when besieged as Mr Fox proposed to Mr Gurney by the cries of the manufacturers This description of men Mr Fox endeavoured in his speech by every method to irritate and inflame In effect his two speeches were through the whole nothing more than an amplification of the Norwich handbill He rested the greatest part of his argument on the distress of trade which he attributed to the war though it was obvious to any tolerably good observation and much more must have been clear to such an observation as his that the then difficulties of the trade and manufactures would have no sort of connection with our share in it The war had hardly begun We had suffered neither by spoil nor by defeat nor by disgrace of any kind Public credit was so little impaired that instead of being supported by any extraordinary aids from individuals it advanced a credit to individuals to the amount of five millions for the support of trade and manufactures under their temporary difficulties a thing before never heard ofa thing of which I do not commend the policybut only state it to shew that Mr Fox's ideas of the effects of war were without any trace of foundation  It is impossible not to connect the arguments and proceedings of a party with that of its leaderespecially when not disavowed or controlled by him Mr Fox's partizans declaim against all the powers of Europe except the Jacobins just as he does but not having the same reasons for management and caution which  he has they speak out He satisfies himself merely with making his invectives and leaves others to draw the conclusion But they produce their Polish interposition for the express purpose of leading to a French alliance They urge their French peace in order to make a junction with the Jacobins to oppose the powers whom in their language they call despots and their leagues a combination of despots Indeed no man can look on the present posture of Europe with the least degree of discernment who will not be thoroughly convinced that England must be the fast friend or the determined enemy of France There is no medium and I do not think Mr Fox to be so dull as not to observe this His peace would involve us instantly in the most extensive and most ruinous wars at the same time that it would not have made a broad highway across which no human wisdom could put an effectual barrier for a mutual intercourse with the fraternizing Jacobins on both sides The consequences of which those will certainly not provide against who do not dread or dislike them  It is not amiss in this place to enter a little more fully into the spirit of the principal arguments on which Mr Fox thought proper to rest this his grand and concluding motion particularly such as were drawn from the internal state of our affairs Under a specious appearance not uncommonly put on by men of unscrupulous ambition that of tenderness and compassion to the poor he did his best to appeal to the judgments of the meanest and most ignorant of the people on the merits of the war He had before done something of the same dangerous kind in his printed letter The ground of a political war is  of all things that which the poor labourer and manufacturer are the least capable of conceiving This sort of people know in general that they must suffer by war It is a matter to which they are sufficiently competent because it is a matter of feeling The  causes  of a war are not matters of feeling but of reason and foresight and often of remote considerations and of a very great combination of circumstances which  they  are utterly incapable of comprehending and indeed it is not every man in the highest classes who is altogether equal to it Nothing in a general sense appears to me less fair and justifiable even if no attempt were made to inflame the passions than to submit a matter on discussion to a tribunal incapable of judging of more than  one side  of the question It is at least as unjustifiable to inflame the passions of such judges against  that side  in favour of which they cannot so much as comprehend the arguments Before the prevalence of the French system which as far as it has gone has extinguished the salutary prejudice called our country nobody was more sensible of this important truth than Mr Fox and nothing was more proper and pertinent or was more felt at the time than his reprimand to Mr Wilberforce for an inconsiderate expression which tended to call in the judgment of the poor to estimate the policy of war upon the standard of the taxes they may be obliged to pay towards its support  It is fatally known that the great object of the Jacobin system is to excite the lowest description of the people to range themselves under ambitious men for the pillage and destruction of the more eminent orders and classes of the community The thing therefore that a man not fanatically attached to that dreadful project would most  studiously avoid is to act a part with the French  Propagandists  in attributing as they constantly do all wars and all the consequences of wars to the pride of those orders and to their contempt of the weak and indigent part of the society The ruling Jacobins insist upon it that even the wars which they carry on with so much obstinacy against all nations are made to prevent the poor from any longer being the instruments and victims of kings nobles and the aristocracy of burghers and rich men They pretend that the destruction of kings nobles and the aristocracy of burghers and rich men is the only means of establishing an universal and perpetual peace This is the great drift of all their writings from the meeting of the states of France in to the publication of the last Morning Chronicle They insist that even the war which with so much boldness they have declared against all nations is to prevent the poor from becoming the instruments and victims of these persons and descriptions It is but too easy if you once teach poor labourers and mechanics to defy their prejudices and as this has been done with an industry scarcely credible to substitute the principles of fraternity in the room of that salutary prejudice called our Country it is I say but too easy to persuade them agreeably to what Mr Fox hints in his public letter that this war is and that the other wars have been the wars of Kings it is easy to persuade them that the terrors even of a foreign conquest are not terrors for  them  It is easy to persuade them that for their part  they  have nothing to lose and that their condition is not likely to be altered for the worse whatever party many happen to prevail in the war Under any circumstances this doctrine is highly dangerous as it tends to make separate parties of the higher and lower orders and to put their interests  on a different bottom But if the enemy you have to deal with should appear as France now appears under the very name and title of the deliverer of the poor and the chastiser of the rich the former class would readily become not an indifferent spectator of the war but would be ready to enlist in the faction of the enemy which they would consider though under a foreign name to be more connected with them than an adverse description in the same land All the props of society would be drawn from us by these doctrines and the very foundations of the public defence would give way in an instant  There is no point which the faction of fraternity in England have laboured more than to excite in the poor the horror of any war with France upon any occasionWhen they found that their open attacks upon our constitution in favour of a French Republic were for the present repelledthey put that matter out of sight and have taken the more plausible and popular ground of general peace upon merely general principles although these very men in the correspondence of their Clubs with those of France had reprobated the neutrality which now they so earnestly press But in reality their maxim was and is  "Peace and alliance with France and war with the rest of the world"  This last motion of Mr Fox bound up the whole of his politics during the sessions This motion had many circumstances particularly in the Norwich correspondence by which the mischief of all the others was aggravated beyond measure Yet this last motion for the worst of Mr Fox's proceedings was the best supported of any of them except his amendment to the address The  Duke of Portland had directly engaged to support the warHere was a motion as directly made to force the crown to put an end to it before a blow had been struck The efforts of the faction have so far prevailed that some of his Grace's nearest friends have actually voted for that motion some after shewing themselves went awayothers did not appear at all So it must be where a man is for any time supported from personal considerations without reference to his public conduct Through the whole of this business the spirit of fraternity appears to me to have been the governing principle It might be shameful for any man above the vulgar to shew so blind a partiality even to his own country as Mr Fox appears on all occasions this session to have shewn to France Had Mr Fox been a Minister and proceeded on the principles laid down by him I believe there is little doubt he would have been considered as the most criminal statesman that ever lived in this country I do not know why a statesman out of place is not to be judged in the same manner unless we can excuse him by pleading in his favour a total indifference to principle and that he would act and think in quite a different way if he were in office This I will not suppose One may think better of him and that in case of his power he might change his mind But supposing from better or from worse motives he might change his mind on his acquisition of the favour of the crown I seriously fear that if the king should tomorrow put power into his hands and that his good genius would inspire him with maxims very different from those he has promulgated he would not be able to get the better of the ill temper and the ill doctrines he has been the means of exciting and propagating throughout the kingdom From the very beginning of their inhuman and unprovoked rebellion  and tyrannic usurpation he has covered the predominant faction in France and their adherents here with the most exaggerated panegyrics neither has he missed a single opportunity of abusing and villifying those who in uniform concurrence with the Duke of Portland's and Lord Fitzwilliam's opinion have maintained the true grounds of the Revolution settlement in He lamented all the defeats of the French he rejoiced in all their victories even when those victories threatened to overwhelm the Continent of Europe and by facilitating their means of penetrating Holland to bring this most dreadful of all evils with irresistible force to the very doors if not into the very heart of our country To this hour he always speaks of every thought of overturning the French Jacobinism by force on the part of any power whatsoever as an attempt unjust and cruel and which he reprobates with horror If any of the French Jacobin leaders be spoken of with hatred or scorn he falls upon those that take that liberty with all the zeal and warmth with which men of honour defend their particular and bosom friends when attacked He always represents their cause as a cause of liberty and all who oppose it as partizans of despotism He obstinately continues to consider the great and growing vices crimes and disorders of that country as only evils of passage which are to produce a permanently happy state of order and freedom He represents these disorders exactly in the same way and with the same limitations which are used by one of the two great Jacobin factions I mean that of PETION and BRISSOT Like them he studiously confines his horror and reprobation only to the massacres of the second of September and passes by those of the th of August as well as the imprisonment and deposition of the king which were the consequences of that day as  indeed were the massacres themselves to which he confines his censure though they were not actually perpetrated till early in September Like that faction he condemns not the deposition or the proposed exile or perpetual imprisonment but only the murder of the king Mr SHERIDAN on every occasion palliates all their massacres committed in every part of France as the effects of a natural indignation at the exorbitances of despotism and of the dread of the people of returning under that yokeHe has thus taken occasion to load not the actors in this wickedness but the Government of a mild merciful beneficent and patriotic Prince and his suffering faithful subjects with all the crimes of the new anarchical tyranny under which the new one has been murdered and the others are oppressed Those continual either praises or palliating apologies of every thing done in France and those invectives as uniformly vomitted out upon all those who ventured to express their disapprobation of such proceedings coming from a man of Mr Fox's fame and authority and one who is considered as the person to whom a great party of the wealthiest men in the kingdom look up has been the cause why the principle of the French fraternity formerly gained the ground which it had obtained It will infallibly recover itself again and in ten times a greater degree if the kind of peace in the manner which he preaches ever shall be established with the reigning faction in France  So far as the French practices with regard to France and the other powers of Europeas to their principles and doctrines with regard to the constituton of states Mr Fox studiously on all occasions and indeed when no occasion calls for it as on the Debate of the petition for Reform brings  forward and asserts their fundamental and fatal principle pregnant with every mischief and every crime namely that  "in every country the people is the legitimate sovereign"  exactly conformable to the Declaration of the French Clubs and Legislators  "La Souveraineté est  une indivisible inalienable et imprescriptible  Elle appertient a la nation Aucune  Section  dupeuple ni aucun  Individu  ne peut s'en attribuer l'exercise"  It consounds in a manner equally mischievous and stupid the origin of a government from the people with its continuance in their hands I believe that no such doctrine has ever been heard of in any public act of any government whatsoever until it was adopted I think from the writings of Rousseau by the French assemblies who have made it the basis of their constitution at home and of the matter of their apostate in every country These and other wild declarations of abstract principle Mr Fox says are in themselves perfectly right and true tho' in some cases he allows the French draw absurd consequences from them But I conceive he is mistaken The consequences are most logically tho' most mischievously drawn from the premises and principles by that wicked and ungracious faction The fault is in the foundation  Before society in a multitude of men it is obvious that sovereignty and subjection are ideas which cannot exist It is the compact on which society is formed that makes both But to suppose the people contrary to their compacts both to give away and retain the same thing is altogether absurd It is worse for it supposes in some things combination of men a power and right of always dissolving the social union which power however if it exists renders them again as little sovereigns as subjects but a mere unconnected multitude It  is not easy to state for what good end at a time like this when the foundations of all antient and presumptive governments such as ours to which people submit not because they have chosen them but but because they are born to them are undermined by perilous theories that Mr Fox should be so fond of referring to those theories upon all occasions even tho' speculatively they might be true which God forbid they should Particularly I do not see the reason why he should be so fond of declaring that the principles of the Revolution have made the Crown of Great Britain  elective  why he thinks it seasonable to preach up with so much earnestness for now three years together the doctrine of resistance and Revolution at all or to assert that our last Revolution of stands on the same and similar principles with that of France We are not called upon to bring forward these doctrines which are hardly ever resorted to but in cases of extremity and where they are followed by correspondent actions We are not called upon by any circumstance that I know of which can justify a revolt or which demands a Revolution or can make an election of a successor to the Crown necessary whatever latent right may be supposed to exist for effectuating any of these purposes  Not the least alarming of the proceedings of Mr Fox and his friends in this session especially taken in concurrence with their whole proceedings with regard to France and its principles is their eagerness at this season under pretence of Parliamentary Reform a project which had been for some time rather dormant to discredit and disgrace the House of Commons For this purpose these Gentlemen have found a way to insult the House by several atrocious libels in the form of petitions In particular they brought up a libel or rather a complete  digest of libellous matter from the Club called the Friends of the people It is indeed at once the most audacious and the most insidious of all the performances of that kind which have yet appeared It is said to be the penmanship of Mr Tierney to bring whom into Parliament the Duke of Portland formerly had taken a good deal of pains and expended as I hear a considerable sum of money  Among the circumstances of danger from that piece and from its precedent it is observable that this is the first petition if I remember right  coming from a Club or association signed by individuals denoting neither local residence nor corporate capacity  This mode of petition not being strictly illegal or informal tho' in its spirit in the highest degree mischievous may and will lead to other things of that nature tending to bring these Clubs and Associations to the French model and to make them in the end answer French purposes I mean that without legal names these Clubs will be lead to assume political capacities that they may debate the forms of Constitution and that from their meetings they may insolently dictate their will to the regular authorities of the kingdom in the manner in which the Jacobin Clubs issue their mandates to the National Assembly or the National Convention The audacious remonstrance which I observe is signed by all of that Association the Friends of the People  who are not in Parliament  and it was supported most strenuously by all associations  who are members  with Mr Fox at their head He and they contended for referring this libel to a Committee Upon the question of that reference they grounded all their debate for a change in the constitution of Parliament The pretended Petition is in fact a regular charge or impeachment of the House of Commons digested into a number of articles This plan of Reform  is not a criminal impeachment but a matter of prudence to be submitted to the public wisdom which must be as well apprized of the facts as petitioners can be But those accessors of the House of Commons have proceeded upon the principles of a criminal process and have had the effrontery to offer proof on each article  This charge the party of Mr Fox maintained article by article beginning with the first namely the interference of Peers at elections and their nominating in effect several Members of the House of Commons In the printed list of grievances which they made out on the occasion and in support of their charge is found in the borough which under Lord Fitzwilliam's influence I now sit By this remonstrance and its object they hope to defeat the operation of property in elections and in reality to dissolve the connection and communication of interests which makes the Houses of Parliament a mutual support to each other Mr Fox and the friends of the people are not so ignorant as not to know that Peers do not interfere in elections as Peers but as men of property They well know that the House of Lords is by itself the feeblest part of the constitution they know that the House of Lords is supported only by its connections with the crown and the House of Commons and that without this double connection the Lords could not exist a single year They know that all these parts of our constitution whilst they are balanced as opposing interests are also connected as friends otherwise nothing but confusion could be the result of a complex constitution It is natural therefore that they who wish the common destruction of the whole and of all its parts should contend for their total separation But as the House of Commons is that link which connects  both the other parts of the constitution the Crown and the Lords  with the mass of the people  it is to that link as it is natural enough that their incessant attacks are directed That artificial representation of the people being once discredited and overturned all goes to pieces and nothing but a plain  French  democracy or arbitrary monarchs can possibly exist  Some of these gentlemen who have attacked the House of Commons lean to a representation of the people by the head that is to  individual representation  None of them that I recollect except Mr Fox directly rejected it It is remarkable however that he only rejected it by simply declaring an opinion He let all the argument go against his opinion All the proceedings and arguments of his reforming friends lead to individual representation and to nothing else It deserves to be attentively observed  that his individual representation is the only plan of their reform which has been explicitly proposed  In the mean time the conduct of Mr Fox appears to be far more inexplicable on any good ground than theirs who propose the individual representation for he neither proposes any thing nor even suggests that he has any thing to propose in lieu of the present mode of constituting the House of CommonsOn the contrary he declares against all the plans which have yet been suggested either from himself or others yet thus unprovided with any plan whatsoever he pressed forward this unknown reform with all possible warmth and for that purpose in a speech of several hours he urged the referring to a committee the libellous impeachment of the House of Commons by the association of the friends of the people But for Mr Fox to discredit Parliament  as it stands  to countenance leagues covenants and  associations for its further discreditto render it perfectly odious and contemptibleand at the same time to propose nothing at all in place of what he disgraces is worse if possible than to contend for personal individual representation and is little less than demanding in plain terms to bring on plain anarchy  Mr Fox and these gentlemen have for the present been defeated but they are neither converted nor disheartened They have so solemnly declared that they will persevere until they have obtained their ends persisting to assert that the House of Commons not only is not a true representative of the people but that it does not answer the purpose of such representation most of them insist that all the debts the taxes and the burthens of all kinds on the people with every other evil and inconvenience which we have suffered since the revolution have been owing solely to the House of Commons which does not speak the sense of the people  It is also not to be forgotten that Mr Fox and all who hold with him on this as on all other occasions of pretended Reform most bitterly reproached Mr Pitt with treachery in declining to support the scandalous charges and indefinite projects of this infamous libel from the friends of the people By the animosity with which they persecute all those who grow cold in this cause of pretended Reform they hope that if through levity inexperience or ambition any young person like Mr Pitt for instance happens to be once embarked in their design they shall by a false shame keep him fast in it for ever Many they have so hampered  I know it is usual when the peril and alarm of the hour appears to be a little overblown to think no more of the matterBut for my part I look back with horror on what we have escaped and am full of anxiety with regard to the dangers that in my opinion are still to be apprehended both at home and abroad this business has cast deep roots Whether it is necessarily connected in theory with Jacobinism is not worth a dispute The two things are connected in fact The partizans of the one are the partizans of the other I know it is common with those who are favourable to the gentlemen of Mr Fox's party and to their leader though not at all devoted to all their reforming projects or their Gallican politics to argue in palliation of their conduct that it is not in their power to do all the harm their actions evidently tend to It is said that as the people will not support them they may safely be indulged in those eccentric fancies of Reform and those theories which lead to nothing This apology is not very much to the honour of those politicians whose interests are to be adhered to in defiance of their conduct I cannot flatter myself that these incessant attacks on the constitution of of Parliament are safe It is not in my power to despise the unceasing efforts of a confederacy of about fifty persons of eminence men of the far greater part of very ample fortunes either in possession or in expectancy men of decided characters and vehement passionsmen of very great talents of all kinds of much boldness and of the greatest possible spirit of artifice intrigue adventure and enterprize all operating with unwearied activity and perseverence These gentlemen are much stronger too without doors than some calculate They have the more active part of the Dissenters with them and the whole clan of speculators of all denominations  a large and growing species They have that floating multitude which goes with events and which suffer the loss or gain of a battle to decide their opinions of right and wrong As long as by every art this party keeps alive a spirit of disaffection against the very Constitution of the kingdom and attributes as lately it has been in the habit of doing all the public misfortunes to that Constitution it is absolutely  impossible  but that some moment must arrive in which they will be enabled to produce a pretended Reform and a real Revolution If ever the body of this  compound Constitution  of ours is subverted either in favour of unlimited Monarchy or of wild Democracy that ruin will  most certainly  be the result of this very sort of machinations against the House of Commons It is not from a confidence in the views or intentions of any statesman that I think he is to be indulged in these perilous amusements  Before it is made the great object of any man's political life to raise another to power it is right to consider what are the real dispositions of the person to be so elevated We are not to form our judgment on these dispositions from the rules and principles of a court of Justice but from those of private discretion not looking for what would serve to criminate another but what is sufficient to direct ourselvesBy a comparison of a series of the discourses and actions of certain men for a reasonable length of time it is impossible not to obtain sufficient indication of the general tendency of their views and principles There is no other rational mode of proceeding It is true that in some one or two perhaps not well weighed expressions or some one or two unconnected and doubtful affairs we may and ought to judge of the actions or words by our previous  good or ill opinion of the man But this allowance has its bounds It does not extend to any regular course of systematic action or of constant and repeated discourse It is against every principle of common sense and of justice to myself and to the public to judge of a series of speeches and actions from the man and not of the man from the whole tenor of his language and conduct Had Mr Fox been a minister and proceeded in that capacity on the principles and in the manner in which he has acted during the whole of the last Session I believe he would be considered as the most criminal statesman that ever existed in this country I do not see why a statesman out of place is not to be judged of in the same manner unless we excuse him by pleading in his favor a total indifference to moral principle and that he would speak and act in quite a different way if he were in office I have stated the above matters not as infering a criminal charge of evil intention If I had meant to do so perhaps they are stated with tolerable exactnessBut I have no such view The intentions of these Gentlemen may be very pure I do not dispute it But I think they are in some great error If these things are done by Mr Fox and his friends with good intentions they are not done less dangerously for it shews these good intentions are not under the direction of safe maxims and principles  Mr Fox Mr Sheridan and the Gentlemen who call themselves the phalanx have not been so very indulgent to others They have thought proper to ascribe to those Members of the House of Commons who in exact agreement with the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam abhor and oppose the French system the basest  and most unworthy motives for their conductas if none could oppose that atheistic immoral and impolitic project set up in France so disgraceful and destructive as I conceive to human nature itself but with some sinister intentions They treat those Members on all occasions with a sort of lordly insolence though they are persons that whatever homage they may pay to the eloquence of the Gentlemen who choose to look down upon them with scorn are not their inferiors in any particular which calls for and obtains just consideration from the publicnot their inferiors on knowledge of public law or of the Constitution of the kingdomnot their inferiors in their acquaintance with its foreign and domestic interestsnot their inferiors in experience or practice of businessnot their inferiors in moral characternor their inferiors in the proofs they have given of zeal and industry in the service of their country Without denying to these Gentlemen the respect and consideration which it is allowed justly belongs to them we see no reason why they should not as well be obliged to concede something to our opinions as that we should be bound blindly and servilely to follow those of Mr Fox Mr Sheridan Mr Grey Mr Courtney Mr Lambton Mr Whitbread Mr Francis Mr Taylor and others We are Members of Parliament and their equals We never consider ourselves as their followers These Gentlemen some of them hardly born when some of us came into Parliament have thought proper to treat us as deserters as if we had been listed into their phalanx like soldiers and had sworn to live and die in their French principles This insolent claim of superiority on their part and of a sort of vassalage to them on that of other Members is what no liberal mind will submit to  The Society of the Liberty of the Press the Whig Club and the Society for Constitutional Information and I believe the Friends of the People as well as some Clubs in Scotland have indeed declared  "That their confidence in and attachment to Mr Fox has lately been confirmed strengthened and encreased by the calumnies as they are called against him"  It is true Mr Fox and his friends have those testimonies in their favour against certain old friends of the Duke of Portland Yet on a full serious and I think dispassionate consideration of the whole of what Mr Fox and Mr Sheridan and their friends have acted said and written in this Session instead of doing any thing which might tend to procure power or any share of it whatsoever to them or to their phalanx as they call it or to encrease their credit influence or popularity in the nation I think it one of my most serious and important public duties in whatsoever station I may be placed for the short time I have to live effectually to employ my best endeavours by every prudent and every lawful means to traverse all their designs I have only to lament that my abilities are not greater and that my probability of life is not better for the more effectual pursuit of that object But I trust that neither the principles nor exertions will die with me I am the rather confirmed in this my resolution and in this my wish of transmitting it because every ray of hope concerning a possible control or mitigation of the enormous mischiefs which the principles of these Gentlemen and which their connections full as dangerous as their principles might receive from the influence of the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam on becoming their colleagues in office is now entirely banished from the mind of every man living  It is apparent even to the world at large that so far from having a power to direct or to guide Mr Fox Mr Sheridan Mr Grey c c c in any important matter they have not through this Session been able to prevail on them to forbear or to delay or mitigate or soften any one act or any one expression upon subjects on which they essentially differed  Even if this hope of a possible control did exist yet the declared opinions and the uniform line of conduct conformable to those opinions pursued by Mr Fox must become a matter of serious alarm if he should obtain a power either at Court or in Parliament or in the Nation at large and for this plain reasonHe must be the most active and efficient member in any Administration of which he shall form a part That a man or set of men are guided by such not dubious but delivered and avowed principles and maxims of policy as to need a watch and check on them in the exercise of the highest power ought in my opinion to make every man who is not of the same principles and guided by the same maxims a little cautious how he makes himself one of the traversers of a ladder to help such a man or such a set of men to climb up to the highest authority A minister of this country is to be controlled by the House of Commons He is to be trusted not  controlled  by his colleagues in office if he were to be controlled Government which ought to be the source of order would itself become a scene of anarchy Besides Mr Fox is a man of an aspiring and commanding mind made rather to control than to be controlled and he never will be nor can be in any Administration in which he will be guided by any of those whom I have been accustomed  to confide in It is absurd to think that he would or could If his own opinions do not control him nothing can When we consider of an adherence to a man which leads to his power we must not only see what the man is but how he stands related  It is not to be forgotten that Mr Fox acts in close and inseparable connection with another Gentleman of exactly the same description as himself and who perhaps of the two is the leader The rest of the body are not a great deal more tractable and over them if Mr Fox and Mr Sheridan have authority most assuredly the Duke of Portland has not the smallest degree of influence  One must take care that a blind partiality to some persons and as blind an hatred to others may not enter into our minds under a colour of inflexible public principle We hear as a reason for clinging to Mr Fox at present that nine years ago Mr Pitt got into power by mischievous intrigues with the Court with the Dissenters and with other factious people out of Parliament to the discredit and weakening of the power of the House of Commons His conduct nine years ago I still hold to be very culpable There are however many things very culpable that I do not know how to punish My opinion on such matters I must submit to the good of the State as I have done on other occasions and particularly with regard to the authors and managers of the American war with whom I have acted both in office and in opposition with great confidence and cordiality though I thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable Whilst the misconduct of Mr Pitt and his associates was yet recent it was not possible to get  Mr Fox of himself to take a single step or even to countenance others in taking any step upon the ground of that misconduct and false policy though if the matters had been then taken up and pursued such a step could not have appeared so evidently desperate as now it isSo far from pursuing Mr Pitt I know that then and for some time after some of Mr Fox's friends were actually and with no small earnestness looking out to a coalition with that gentleman For years I never heard this circumstance of Mr Pitt's misconduct on that occasion mentioned by Mr Fox either in public or in private as a ground for opposition to that minister All opposition from that period to this very Session has proceeded upon the separate measures as they separately arose without any vindictive retrospect to Mr Pitt's conduct in My memory however may fail me I must appeal to the printed debates which so far as Mr Fox is concerned are unusually accurate  Whatever might be in our power at an early period at this day I see no remedy for what was done in I had no great hopes even at that time I was therefore very eager to record a remonstrance on the journals of the House of Commons as a caution against such a popular delusion in times to come and this I then feared and now am certain is all that could be done I know of no way of animadverting on the Crown I know no mode of calling to account the House of Lords who threw out the India Bill in a way not much to their credit  As little or rather less am I able to coerce the people at large who behaved very unwisely and intemperately on that occasion Mr Pitt was then accused by me as well as others of attempting to be minister without enjoying the confidence of the  House of Commons though he did enjoy the confidence of the Crown That House of Commons whose confidence he did not enjoy unfortunately did not itself enjoy the confidence though we well deserved it either of the Crown or of the public For want of that confidence the then House of Commons did not survive the contest Since that period Mr Pitt has enjoyed the confidence of the Crown and of the Lords and  of the House of Commons  through two successive Parliaments and I suspect that he has ever since and that he does still enjoy as large a portion at least of the confidence of the people without doors as his great rival  Before  whom then is Mr Pitt to be impeached and by whom the more I consider the matter the more firmly I am convinced that the idea of proscribing Mr Pitt  indirectly  when you cannot  directly punish  him is a chimerical a project and as unjustifiable as it would be to have prescribed Lord North For supposing that by indirect ways of opposition by opposition upon measures which do not relate to the business of but which on other grounds might prove unpopular you were to drive him from his seat this would be no example whatever of punishment for the matters we charge as offences in On a cool and dispassionate view of the affairs of this time and country it appears obvious to me that one or the other of these two great men that is Mr Pitt or Mr Fox must be Minister They are I am sorry for it irreconcileable Mr Fox's conduct  in this Session  has rendered the idea of his power a matter of serious alarm to many people who were very little pleased with the proceedings of Mr Pitt in the beginning of his administration They like neither the conduct of Mr Pitt in nor that of Mr Fox in but they estimate which of the evils is most pressing at the time and  what is likely to be the consequence of a change If Mr Fox be wedded they must be sensible that his opinions and principles on the now existing state of things at home and abroad must be taken as his portion In his train must also be taken the whole body of gentlemen who are pledged to him and to each other and to their common politics and principlesI believe no King of Great Britain ever will adopt for his confidential servants that body of gentlemen holding that body of principles Even if the present King or his successor should think fit to take that step I apprehend a general discontent of those who wish that this nation and that Europe should continue in their present state would ensue a discontent which combined with the principles and progress of the new men in power would shake this kingdom to its foundations I do not believe any one political conjecture can be more certain than this  Without at all defending or palliating Mr Pitt's conduct in I must observe that the crisis of with regard to every thing at home and abroad is full as important as that of ever was and if for no other reason by being present is much more important It is not to nine years ago we are to look for the danger of Mr Fox's and Mr Sheridan's conduct and that of the Gentlemen who act with them  It is at  this  very time and in  this  very session that if they had not been strenuously resisted they would not only merely have discredited the House of Commons as Mr Pitt did in when he persuaded the King to reject their advice and to appeal from them to the people but in my opinion would have been the means of wholly subverting the House of Commons and the House of Peers and the whole Constitution actual and vertual together with the safety and independence  of this nation and of the peace and settlement of every state in the now Christian world It is to our opinion of the nature of Jacobinism and of the probability by corruption faction and force of its gaining ground every where that the question who and what are you to support is to be determined For my part without doubt or hesitation I look upon Jacobinism as the most dreadful and most shameful evil which ever afflicted mankind a sting which goes beyond the power of all calculation in its mischief and that if it is suffered to exist in France we must in England and speedily too fall into that calamity  I figure to myself the purpose of these Gentlemen accomplished and this Ministry destroyed I see that the persons who in that case must rule can be no other than Mr Fox Mr Sheridan Mr Grey the Marquis of Lansdowne Lord Thurlow Lord Lauderdale and the Duke of Norfolk with the other Chiefs of the Friends of the People the Parliamentary Reformers and the admirers of the French Revolution The principal of these are all formally pledged to their projects If the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam should be admitted into that system as they might and probably would be it is quite certain they could not have the smallest weight in it less indeed than what they now profess if less were possible because they would be less wanted than they now are and because all those who wished to join them and to act under them have been rejected by the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam themselves and Mr Fox finding them thus by themselves disarmed has built quite a new fabric upon quite a new foundation There is no trifling on this subject We see very distinctly before us the Ministry that would be formed and the plan that would be pursued If we like the plan we must wish the power  of those who are to carry it into execution but to pursue the political exaltation of those whose political measures we disapprove and whose principles we dissent from is a species of modern politics not easily comprehensible and which must end in the ruin of the Country if it should continue and spread Mr Pitt may be the worst of men and Mr Fox may be the best but at present the former is in the interest of his country and of the order of things long established in Europe Mr Fox is not I have for one been born in this order of things and would fain die in it I am sure it is sufficient to make men as virtuous as happy and as knowing as any thing which Mr Fox and his friends abroad or at home would substitute in its place and I should be sorry that any set of politicians should obtain power in England whose principles or schemes should lead them to countenance persons or factions whose object is to introduce some new devised order of things into England or to support that order where it is already introduced in France a place in which if it can be fixed in my mind it must have a certain and decided influence in and upon this kingdom This is my account of my conduct to my private friends I have already said all I wish to say or nearly so to the public I write this with pain and with an heart full of grief  EDMUND BURKE
