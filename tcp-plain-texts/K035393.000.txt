DEFENCE OF Mr KENRICK's REVIEW OF Dr JOHNSON's SHAKESPEARE  SECTION I INTRODUCTORY  WHAT a wellbred age do we live in Time was when writers might boldly call in question the abilities of each other without incurring the censure of  malignity  or even sometimes forfeiting their title to distinguished urbanity when the meanest individual in the Republick of Letters had a right to bring the charge of  ignorance  or  inattention  against the proudest champion that ever brandished goosequill when he might cite the accused to appear at the bar of the publick and give testimony in plain terms against him without ceremony or equivocation Time was I say when this impartial tribunal also attentive only to the matter of fact and the evidence laid before it  passed sentence on the  convicted  without respect of persons honouring the prosecutor with its thanks and protection as a friend to justice and the interests of literature  How different is the case at present when the sanction of a literary reputation however obtained is similar to a certain political privilege however acquired though it be notorious that ignorance and partiality operate as powerfully in the one case as bribery and corruption are sometimes supposed to do in the other But when the candidates are once chaired and their opponents have not influence enough to get them expelled it is theirs to sit in judgment on their fellow subjects and give laws to the world of letters  It is well however for the progress of  Science  and the independency of  Wit  that the Session of the Literary Junto is not so firmly established as that of the political They are both provided indeed with their ushers and serjeants respectively but however tremendous may be the magisterial authority of the one nothing can be more ridiculous than the critical mockmajesty of the other  The author of the Review of Dr Johnson's Shakespeare hath it seems been committed to the custody of these literary mirmidons and formally proceeded against for a breach of privilege The Doctor we are told was above being called to account by any private individual whatever it being the highest indignity to the  majority  even to suspect the inability of a writer whom they had been pleased to vote  infallible  As a friend to the  Reviewer  therefore I take up the pen to defend his cause and assert the right of every citizen in the Republick of Letters to think and write freely To this I am particularly incited also from a due sense that such freedom is become absolutely necessary to support the present interests of literature which are daily drooping under the dead weights of indolence partiality and prepossession  I am not insensible that these obstacles to the progress of science and the advancement of letters are commonly called by other names I well know that in this age of civility and false refinement mere COURTESY is termed  candour  CEREMONY is called  politeness  QUAINTNESS  elegance  PEDANTRY  erudition  and DULLNESS  decency  and  decorum  On the other hand SINCERITY is termed  insult  CENSURE is called  cruelty  and WIT and HUMOUR  petulance  and  illmanners  In the mean time a zeal for  truth  is looked upon as a kind of canine madness and a heartfelt veneration for true genius and learning is despised as a literary phrenzy Thus are we degenerated from our forefathers from the wits and philosophers of those ages which produced a Shakespeare a Bacon a Dryden and a Milton whom instead of imitating we exert all our little abilities to depreciate and level with the diminutive standard of the present times A late noble writer observes respecting our moral and political character that we are nowadays so far from having the  virtues  of great men that we have not even their  vices  every thing says he is little mean and pitiful among us This might with greater justice be said of our  literary  character our taste for works of real genius true science and solid erudition being almost dwindled into nothing In the mean time we see the petty pretenders to wit and learning industriously forming themselves into parties for the support of each other because they find themselves unable to stand alone Imbecillity naturally tends to render people complacent and civil while the cunning usually attendant on ignorance artfully teaches them to make a merit of their weakness and to impute even their pusillanimity to candour and benevolence  It is no wonder that a writer who hath the fortitude alone to attack one of the greatest of these partial and illiberal combinations should create himself a number of enemies nor is it indeed a wonder that the impartial publick should for a while be misled by the self interested clamours which so numerous a body of partisans may raise against him It is boldly presumed however that if the publick should fully and coolly enquire into the real state of the case the motives for such attack and the merits and demerits of the parties assailed and defended they will not only acquit the Reviewer of the false charges of illiberality and malignity brought against him but will be ready to acknowledge that the chastisement Dr Johnson hath received at his hands is no less defensible with regard to its severity than it is justifiable in respect to its cause  SECT II  Reasons for the Reviewer's having a less exalted opinion of Dr J's abilities than has been entertained by the publick in general  THERE is nothing which at first sight gives us greater offence or disgust than to see those persons or characters for whom we have been used to entertain a certain degree of respect treated with familiarity or contempt Nor is it at all necessary to this end that such treatment should on their part be merited It is enough that we are ignorant of their demerits of which it is afterwards very difficult to convince us even by the strongest testimony We are by no means easily reconciled to such an instance of our want of sagacity as that of having long entertained a favourable opinion much less a kind of reverence for an object unworthy of it We are apt to hesitate therefore at the most flagrant proofs of our mistake and even to take offence at any supposed indignity offered to such characters as if it in some measure affected ourselves  This hath been remarkably the case in the present affair of Mr K's Review of Dr Johnson's Shakespeare even those who could not fail of being convinced of the justice of the Reviewer's remarks finding in themselves something repugnant to the ludicrous and sarcastical manner in which Mr K had thought proper to reprehend this editor Admitting for the present however that the cause of such reprehension was just they  cannot fail on reflection to impute that repugnance to their prepossession in favour of Dr J and their ignorance of the Reviewer's having still farther motives for his severity than appeared on the face of his pamphlet  That none of these motives were personal the Reviewer hath repeatedly and publickly declared What they were may be gathered from this and the following sections  The Reviewer it seems had been some years abroad when he first heard of the publication of Dr Johnson's Dictionary a work of which he had formed the highest expectations from the supposed abilities and great reputation of its author At the same time being apprehensive that his own application to the use of foreign languages might in some measure corrupt that of his native tongue he procured Dr J's apparently elaborate performance in order to correct both his memory and judgment as either might occasionally fail him Having thus during an interval of several years had more frequent occasions to consult an English dictionary than possibly would have happened to him in any other situation he could not fail of being greatly surprized and disappointed at the many palpable and gross mistakes which had escaped this celebrated lexicographer He was not so unreasonable to expect indeed that in a work of such extent a number of trivial and perhaps some important errors should not escape the most attentive and industrious compiler He could neither expect however nor overlook such an amazing number of blunders and inconsistencies in etymology orthoepy idiom and grammatical construction  as were to be found in a work which was boasted of as a capital undertaking and recommended to foreigners as a standard of the English language  He would have been careless of the honour and wanting to the literature of his country  Especially as he observed that succeeding dictionarywriters both abroad and at home implicitly adopted the most egregious errors on the authority of Johnson Sufficient proof of this may be had by an examination of Bailey's Dictionary improved by Scott Baretti's Italian and English Dictionary and others  had he not every where taken a proper occasion therefore to speak of the defects and imperfections of Dr Johnson's Dictionary At the same time that he might not be thought to depreciate the labours of another without sufficient cause he amused himself occasionally with forming a table of  errata  to that performance intending some time or other to offer it to the proprietors and in case of their refusal to accept it to lay it before the publick  The Reviewer's list of errors was pretty copious when he returned to England since when having applied more closely to literary matters he hath increased it almost tenfold and that by no means to the honour of Dr Johnson's boasted erudition and profound knowledge of the English tongue  This detection of the  Lexicographer  induced the Reviewer to make a closer examination than he had before done into the compositions of the  writer  in which were found the same traces of  inattention  to the idiom of our tongue and of his imperfect acquaintance with other modern languages In the mean time he  was found to be eternally aiming at the introduction of Latinisms and other vicious modes of expression by way of  enriching  our tongue but thereby corrupting it as he himself says of Shakespeare  by almost every mode of depravation  In his productions of imagination his invention appeared weak and languid It exerted itself indeed now and then with tolerable success in a  dream  or vision but it was hardly ever wide awake without seeming fatigued with its efforts toward vigility and involuntarily dropping into a doze again As to his works of knowledge and judgment there appeared hardly any trace of the author's acquaintance with the sciences in any of his writings nay even his pretended profundity in morals and the knowledge of mankind seemed to the Reviewer nothing more than a quaint and affected exhibition of the trite observations and hackney'd reflections of others  His greatest merit appeared to consist in the labour thrown away on the tawdry glare of description and the glossy but fading polish of stile Instead of producing great and noble images he seldom reached farther than highsounding words Instead of new and really elegant turns of thought his novelty and refinement generally ended in some florid allusion quaint antithesis or fantastical preciseness of expression His verse seemed heavy cold and spiritless and his prose alternately pompous and puerile  A farther acquaintance with Dr Johnson's literary character acquired even among and from his own  friends had by no means contributed to remove Mr K's unfavourable opinion of this writer when his longexpected edition of Shakespeare made its appearance  Having been already so egregiously disappointed as to the philological abilities of Dr J the Reviewer's expectations were by no means so sanguine as before His enthusiastic veneration for Shakespeare however could not be restrained within the bounds of silence on finding this editor had taken every opportunity to depreciate the merit of that incomparable bard on whom Dr J hath in repeated instances as is shewn in Mr K's Review endeavoured to fix the charge of  incapacity folly vulgarity immorality  and  impiety  To aggravate all this Dr J falls with equal violence on the only commentator on Shakespeare that by his own confession hath acquitted himself with reputation charging him with  weakness ignorance meanness faithlessness petulance  and  ostentation  Those who complain of Mr K's severity and charge him with scurrility illmanners and abuse would do well to look through his work and see if they can find any passage wherein he hath called Dr J  mean faithless immoral  or  impious  But Shakespeare and Theobald are  dead  and Dr Johnson is  alive  the former cannot suffer by any thing that is said of them whereas the latter may be essentially hurt by an attack on his reputation  This may be urged indeed by those who conceive Mr K's excessive zeal for the honour of the dead is less excusable than Dr J's excess of tenderness for the reputation of the living It is very certain that as they  arise from different motives they must necessarily interfere with or counteract each other It is difficult indeed to say which savours most of envy and malignity  It is very juslty observed however by a late ingenious French writer S'il est horrible d'insulter aux vivans combien plus odieux est il de fle  rir la reputation des morts  We may envy the reputation both of the living and the dead but can hate only the living Even hate however may arise from laudable principles as honest men detest knaves and lovers of truth abhor falsehood but envy whether directed to the living or dead is a mean and odious passion At the same time it must be universally allowed more brave and honourable though it may be less prudential to attack the reputation of the living than the dead Now fortitude hath ever been esteemed the general concomitant of ingenuousness and candour which never harbour in envious minds  So far Mr K hath evidently the advantage over Dr J Besides the friends of the latter while they charge the former with envy at Dr J's abilities and reputation accuse him at the same time with insufferable selfsufficiency and vanity But if the contempt with which he hath treated Dr J proceed really from his vanity and selfsufficiency there is the less room to think him subject to the motives of envy for we never can envy those we truly despise The truth I imagine is that Mr K neither does the one nor the other by Dr J notwithstanding he hath sufficiently shewn a fixed detestation of that editor's literary misconduct This detestation as I observed before may nevertheless be very just and laudable in which case  its effects cannot with any propriety be imputed to malignity  I should now proceed to enquire how far Dr Johnson may be defended from the suspicion of envy as the motive for his abuse of Theobald and Shakespeare  As it behoves others however to exculpate the Doctor I shall only propose a few questions to those of his friends who may chuse to answer them such answers in my opinion tending effectually either to clear or convict him of acting from invidious motives  SECT III  Questions offered to Dr Johnson's friends respecting some curious anecdotes of the life and literary conduct of that gentleman  IT hath been said with regard to Dr Wrbrtn that he abundantly deserved the scurrility and abuse which it is pretended Mr K hath thrown upon him  because he was the first author who introduced such soul language into controversy which he never failed to bestow on all his opponents when he dared But with Dr Johnson the case is otherwise he never gave any public offence nor even engaged in any controversy  Those who affirm all this appear to know but very little of Dr Johnson nay even to forget the fact for which he is arraigned Did he give no public offence in the circumstances attending his edition of Shakespeare  Did he not engage in a controversy with almost all his commentators bestowing the worst of foul language on his opponents when he dared that is on those who were  dead  The following queries however take in a farther retrospect of Dr J's literary conduct the general tenour of which will be found to be tinctured with an invidious disposition that he was fond of indulging in actions which his timidity was too great to permit him openly to avow  Who encouraged LAUDER in his infamous attempt to charge the author of Paradise Lost with plagiarism from Massenius and others clapping him on the back while he hopped about the town exclaiming against that  axacrable vellain  John Milton  Who was the manager or editor of the Gentleman's Magazine at that time and kept out the papers written against  Lauder  for several months together for which he afterwards apologized when the imposition became flagrant and the accuser himself with imparallel'd effrontery confessed the forgery  Who recommended such a modest gentleman to the lords Chesterfield and Granville who honoured him with their protection and rewarded him with an annuity till even Dr J's interest could not prevent his being ignominiously turned out of doors  Who actually wrote  Lauder's  pamphlet against  Milton  What ingenuous motive could possibly induce Dr J to join in such an invidious attempt to depreciate the merit of one of the greatest poets England had to boast  Was it not because Milton was in his private character a man of republican principles and an enemy to ecclesiastical tyranny and arbitrary power  What motive could induce Dr J to endeavour in his Rambler to lessen the poetical reputation of the late Mr Pope by laboured criticisms on a few of the most admired passages in his writings and on those  only  Who wrote the severe and carping criticisms on the epitaphs of the same author first published in the  Visitor  and afterwards retailed in the Magazines  Who advised and assisted the celebrated and ingenious Mrs Lenox to an attack on the greatest poet the world ever produced and that in the most essential part of his poetical character in her  Shakespeare illustrated  Who wrote Dr J's New Dictionary of the English language  Whether Dr J ever read the Dictionary he is supposed to have written  Whether the capital improvement intended by that Dictionary was not the collection of the  authorities for and the illustrations of the use of English words  Whether these authorities and illustrations do not in many hundred places contradict the meaning of the words as given by the lexicographer  Whether the writer hath not almost always mistaken the very meaning of words when he has departed from former dictionaries  Whether he hath not in a considerable number of instances given the words without any meaning at all  Who wrote the proposals for publishing the last edition of Shakespeare and who executed the work and how  Whether indolence be an excuse for not doing what a man hath publickly undertaken and is well paid for  Whether it be not an insult to the common sense and common honesty of mankind to pretend that the private  virtue  even of the most ingenious and learned individual upon earth should exempt him from correction when he affects to be himself exempted from the faithful discharge of the common duties of his profession or calling  Whether imbecility and indolence be really goodnature and benevolence and whether in an age of less ceremony and greater sincerity the magisterial supineness affected by Dr J would not be frankly called  pride  and  idleness  Whether if the above questions cannot be answered to the honour of Dr J what right either he or his friends have to complain of the severity of the chastisement bestowed on him  To this score of queries I shall beg leave to add a dozen more merely literary and some of them not altogether confined to Dr Johnson's conduct but extending to that of his friends who have been pleased to abuse Mr K on this occasion  Whether the Drs J and H have not been long in a secret and partial combination to applaud the writings and enhance the literary reputation of each other  Whether the Gentleman's Magazine hath not for many years past been notoriously prostituted to this purpose  Whether the Rambler and the Adventurer in their journey to the temple of Fame were not obliged like travellers that had but one horse between them to ride and tie from month to month occasionally  Whether Dr H did not many years ago oblige the Reviewer with a letter containing a long and elaborate criticism on one of his puerile performances professing an high opinion of Mr K's natural genius and offering his best services in directing its cultivation  Whether Mr K ever saw Dr H or gave him any cause of offence since that time or whether he hath not ever spoken of him and his writings with due respect while on the other hand Dr H hath taken more than one opportunity of endeavouring to obscure the little merit to which Mr K may have occasionally pretended  Whether Dr H could have any other motive than Mr K's differing from him in political and religious principles and how far such a motive is admissible in the republick of letters  How many lines Dr J wrote in the  Traveller  for the aukward compliment paid him by its author in the Universal Museum when he stiled him the  glory of the English nation  How many more he is to write in Mr G's next poem for his scribbling  nonsense  on the cover of Mr K's Review at the coffeehouses for his verses in the St James's Chronicle of December and for the favour he does the Reviewer in running about the town to abuse him  Whether Mr G who rails at all Reviewers was not himself a Literary Reviewer till he was discarded for incapacity  Whether Dr J himself did not make several efforts to assume a kind of dictatorship over a certain periodical Review interfering on subjects of which he was consummately ignorant  Whether Mr G is not one of Dr J's lighttroops and whether he does not harbour some resentment against Mr K for exposing his ignorance when he Mr G took upon him to give an account of  The present Stale of polite Letters in Europe  without even knowing the names of the celebrated writers now living on the continent  How Mr K can fail to hold such invidious pretenders to exclusive knowledge in some degree of contempt and like a man of spirit  openly  to treat them accordingly    SECT IV  Whether Dr J deserves better treatment than he has received and how far Mr K is excusable in having so treated him  DR Johnson's friends will doubtless object that it is much easier to ask questions than to answer them and that injurious inuendoes may be safely conveyed in the way of query even though they should be groundless  I should not have presumed to ask those questions however had not Mr K furnished me with authenticated materials for making a satisfactory reply to every single article if the Doctor or his friends should at any time require it It was thought proper in the mean time to state the merits of Dr J's literary character rather in a problematical than a  peremptory manner that his partizans might solve any difficulties that might arise in the best manner they are able But if they cannot obviate such difficulties and that very soon it is not to be doubted that the good sense ahd impartiality of the publick will prevail over its former prepossessions and determine for me that Dr J hath met with no worse treatment than he deserves  How far Mr K is defensible in having inflicted it is another matter of consideratioh If the Reviewer in the height of his zeal for the honour of Shakespeare hath given too great a loose to his passions and hath expressed himself unbecoming a scholar and a gentleman he hath in so doing injured his own reputation more than he hath done that of Dr Johnson Nor is it any justification of Mr K's scurrility to say it is a degree less scurrilous than that of the Doctors Jn or Wn  If their fault however be no justification of his it is some excuse for the latter that it appears to be the natural effect of a resentment excited by nobler and less interested motives  To attack a man in the warmth of resentment however rudely who is alive and able to defend himself is certainly less exceptionable in point of honour and spirit at least than a premeditated design conceived and executed in cold blood to strip the dead of those honours which successive ages had bestowed on their memory  It is to be observed also that it is not very easy for men of warm passions when affected with their subject to express their resentment in terms always consistent with the common forms of politeness Experience sufficiently evinces this as we may be convinced by turning to almost any polemic writings even on those subjects which in a peculiar manner require the appearance at least of the highest degree of temper and benevolence  There is one cireumstance indeed in which the Reviewer seems justly to have incurred the censure of impoliteness and want of urbanity This is the reflection he hath made on a certain  natural  infirmity of Dr J In answer to this charge however it is to be observed that Mr K being personally a stranger to the Doctor and having formed the ideas of his character purely on the representations of the Doctor's friends he really mistook that infirmity for an affected habit as those very friends in repeating Dr J's bons mots constantly made use of the same habit or infirmity to heighten the joke and therefore may be as justly said to have ridiculed it themselves as it is pretended Mr K has done Nay the Doctor's acquaintance are still more inexcusable as they must be supposed to have known the real state of the case and ought not to have given occasion for such a mistake in a writer who is master of sufficient acrimony of stile without descending to ridicule personal defects which he never could conceive to be ridiculous  Having now done with Dr Johnson's demerits as well as the merits of Mr K's Review with regard to its severity in general I shall proceed to take some notice of the principal objections that have been made to it by particular writers especially by the authors of the Critical Review the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine the Candid Reviewers and some few other volunteer criticks  To begin with the firstmentioned whose inconconsistent behaviour with regard to Mr K's writings even from the very commencement of their Review may serve to elucidate their pretensions to impartiality as well as their capacity to sit in judgment on works of genius or learning  SECT V  Specimens of the literary abilities and candour of the Critical Reviewers occasionally exercised on the writings of Mr K and particularly on his Review of Dr J's Shakespare  THE very ingenious and ingenuous authors of the Critical Review having had frequent occasion to exercise their critical talents on the writings of Mr K it may not be amiss to take a retrospect of their former opinion of this writer's genius and abilities as it may serve in some measure to account for that which they affect to entertain at present  When an imperfect edition of  Epistles to Lorenzo  first made its appearance in England these criticks who had not long before entered on their judicial office approved of them as spirited just poetical descriptive sensible and true  CRITICAL REVIEW vol iii page    In their Review of the second edition they again confessed  they could not help admiring the perspicuity the spirit the variety of the author's expression and imagery  Ibid vol vi page    concluding their strictures with saying  We will candidly own our admiration of his genius both as a poet and metaphysician  Ibid vol vi page    In speaking of the same writer's translations they express themselves with equal warmth of approbation Of that of  Rousseau  's  Eloisa  they say  It is but justice to add that we never perused a more spirited just and elegant translation than that of Eloisa though one of the most difficult performances in the French language as it abounds with turns sentiments and idiomatical expressions which will hardly bear being translated into a foreign tongue  Ibid vol xii page    Of  Gesner's Rural Poems  they affirm  that in the harmony of the periods the conciseness the elegance and simplicity of stile the original German is happily imitated by the English version  Will it be believed when I affirm it that these judicious criticks have at other times compared this  their admirable  genius to Sternhold and Hopkins or that in their present strictures they have charged so sensible so poetical so metaphysical a writer with having published paultry observations and ridiculous absurdities in his Review of Dr Johnson's Shakespeare Nay so treacherously has their spleen dealt with their memory that they have even ventured to pronounce that  the Trevoux Dictionary appears to be the ne plus ultra of the French learning  of the author of the  spirited just  and  elegant  translation of Eloisa  The reader will very naturally ask what can possibly be the meaning of such strange inconsistency I will endeavour to inform him When the Critical Reviewers were so lavish of their encomiums on Mr K's writings they were either ignorant of his private connections or that he was the author of such writings and thus may be supposed to have spoken of them to the best of their judgment without partiality or prejudice Mr K however had no sooner shewn himself above being elated with the applause of ignorance and had corrected them for the fallacy of their hypercriticisms  In the  Scrutiny  or the  Critics Criticised  for an account of which see the Critical and Monthly Reviews for the year  than they became immediately his enemies and that in a more virulent manner when he was known to give the preference to a rival Review Such it is presumed are the secret springs by which these tremendous judges of literary merit must in this case appear to be actuated  In support of this presumption we shall here recapitulate a few of those criticisms on which they have ventured to rest the merits of their censure  This Drawcansir of a Reviewer opens his work with a specimen of his critical abilities by correcting the following passage in the Tempest vol i p  PROS to MIR  I have with such provision in mine art  So safely order'd that there is no SOUL  No not so much perdition as an hair  Betid to any creature in the vessel c  Though we admit that Warburton's Theobald's and Johnson's remarks on this passage are all absurd yet we think our Reviewer has been ingenious enough to excel them even in absurdity for he reads instead of 'there is no SOUL' 'there is no ILL' We will venture to say that there is no man of plain sense in the kingdom who could suspect a depraved reading in this passage as it stood originally Shakespeare says neither more or less than that  there is no soulviz  perdition  Nay  not so much perdition as an hair  Betid to any creature c  Well may Mr Kenrick adopt the clench of ILLBETIDE  such commentators  Was ever poor devil so caught in the cobweb of his own devices as this unhappy  Critical  Reviewer In the name of common sense what can he mean For my part I cannot even guess so shall leave this sagacious criticism for the reader to explain as he can observing only in justice to Mr K that he proposes his alteration only in case of the supposed necessity of  making any alteration at all which he does by no means affirm Again  ARIEL  Not a soul  But felt a fever of the mad and plaid  Some tricks of desperation  Mr Kenrick is for substituting  a fever of the mind  Mr Johnson is undoubtedly right in restoring the old reading Admitting it not to be quite idiomatical yet it is possessed of strength sufficient to maintain its place against mere conjecture  Ex uno disce omnes  The rest of his review of this play is of a piece with the specimens here exhibited  Here the Critical Reviewer's ipse dixit gives the preference to Dr Johnson's reading but the misfortune is that what these Criticks impute to Mr K is the reading of all the modern editions and not Mr Kenrick's  The editor of the Gentleman's Magazine quoting this passage from Mr K's Review says he would have it to be "  The  fever of the mad" An egregious proof this of the attention and capacity of these writers to correct Mr K who in fact only opposes Dr Johnson's reading in this passage advancing nothing of his own except by way of mere hypothesis  so that the reader hath here a most notable instance of their judgment and impartiality in exhibiting the above two criticisms as just specimens of Mr K's Review  They proceed nevertheless in the same magisterial and dogmatical stile to expose their own ignorance still farther in the following passages His say they that is Mr K's "deriving the word  feodary  from the word  foedus  a covenant is an instance of ignorance hardly to be paralleled The best English writers say  feodum  instead of  feudum  A feodary therefore is one who  owes  suit and service  to his superior Warburton's inaccuracy in spelling the word  feuda  which is the Scottish term instead of  feoda  has brought our Critick into a blunder A feodary is no other than a  servant  an  agent  and the very instance brought by this Reviewer from Cymbeline confirms it"  The word whose derivation is here disputed is in some editions of Shakespeare spelt  fedary  without the dipthong Supposing Mr K to be mistaken however which I do not believe to be the case this instance of ignorance as the critic calls it is yet to be parallel'd as he may see by turning to Bailey's Dictionary corrected and enlarged by Scot where he will find the sense of the word and even of the passage quoted from Cymbeline laid down in the same manner  Feuda  may▪ for ought I know be a Scottish term and it may in Scotland mean a slave or servant but neither Shakespeare nor Mr K wrote Scotch but English of which it is hardly possible for a Scotchman ever to be a  compleat  master  The next offence these criticks take at Mr K's illustration is his philosophical explanation of the word  warps  in the famous song of  Blow thou winter's wind  On which occasion they express themselves as follows  "What a pity it is that this writer's whole display of critical and natural knowledge should be entirely thrown away since nothing is more certain than that Shakespeare meant no more by  warping  but  fixing  or  freezing  the waters The allusion is drawn from the operation of weavers who  warp  that is  fix  their worsted or yarn in their looms before they work it"  But how is it certain that Shakespeare meant  no more but  fixing or  freezing  when there is no proof that he meant even that for unless these criticks can produce the testimony of one English writer or even one English  weaver  to prove that the term  warp  as related to the  woof  is used as a verb nobody can give into their notion of the allusion  The following observation affords a remarkable instance of the modesty and learning of these critical gentry  "After all Mr Kenrick's exultations at the discovery of the meaning of the word  l'envoy  in  Love's Labour lost  his etymology is but fantastical nor is it justified by the Trevoux Dictionary which seems to be the  ne plus ultra  of his French learning"  Indeed In the first place Mr Critick you tell a notorious untruth in asserting a thing you know nothing of you have looked I suppose into the  Dictionaire de Trevoux  and because you cannot find such etymology justified by that work you flatly affirm it to be fantastical and very logically conclude that because one Reviewer's French learning extends no farther than the Trevoux Dictionary another's must be confined to the same limits It appears however that Mr K has at least one dictionary more of French learning as you call it than you for I find in one that he put not long since into my hands that his etymology of the word  envoy  is there justified in the following words  ENVOI  C'est comme l'abregé du chant Roial ou de la balade Ce n'est ordinairement  que la moitié d'un couplet du chant Roial ou de la balade qu'on fait à la fin des couplets de ces fortes de poemes qui a été nommé  envoi  parce qu'on l'adressoit au prince des jeux floraux pour se le rendre favorable dans la distribution des prix L'envoi doit être delicat et ingenieux  DICTIONAIRE FRANCOIS  par P Richelet a Geneve chez Widerhold    I shall mention but one more of their criticisms as it contains either a proof of their saying only what other writers have said before them or of their readiness occasionally to adopt the sagacity of others in silence  We shall give him credit for his retaining the word  knot  in the same play but we see no authority he has for supposing the king to be a wounded knot or bird so called When we reflect that he steps aside and conceals himself in a bush while he discovers the lovers so as to be as invisible as a  gnat  the badness of the rhimes is removed by reading  gnat  instead of  knot  but this is mere conjecture  It is really very good of these gentlemen to give such a  paultry observer  as Mr K credit for any thing especially as they had nothing better to offer than mere conjecture But the worst on it is that this conjecture was long ago conjectured by Mr Pope who adopted the same reading for the sake of the rhime This however it is possible these criticks on the critick of the editors of Shakespeare knew nothing at all about  I come now to the more serious part of the offence which these criticks have both taken and given with regard to Mr K's performance This is the passage immediately succeeding the above in which admitting  that Dr J's note is a  vile  one they proceed to insinuate that Mr K in his reprehension of it hath forfeited his pretensions to  honour spirit  and  virtue  Nay reader don't laugh it is really the  Critical  Reviewers who in this very article "have entered their caveat against  illiberal  criticism" and talk about  honour  and  virtue  even those whose criticism hath heretofore been deemed ls and as such punished accordingly You will say perhaps that they are reformed that they have since authorized their printer to pay fifty pounds out of his own pocket to any person who can bring legal proof of their having taken money for the insertion of partial characters of books and authors although they own it has been offered them  See their late advertisement inserted in the newspapers as also on the cover of the Critical Review wisely to inform the country reader of the high esteem in which the Reviewers were held in town It is well for them indeed that their rage of justification did not induce them to promise a reward for proving the editor guilty of receiving and inserting anonymous articles which might for ought he knew be written by the authors of the books themselves because in this case there might have been brought such damning proof as might have made them tremble for the offered premium  What an instance this last of their integrity impartiality and  virtue  Very true indeed and I firmly believe that they never did take any pecuniary bribe on this account for though I am acquainted with many mercenary booksellers and as many vain authors yet I don't know one whom I think fool enough to value the best character they could give of his performance at three farthings I will not contradict them positively indeed and say that not one such is to be found but  it happens extremely unlucky that these criticks in thinking to do themselves honour should confess a thing that cannot fail to entail on them disgrace They own that money hath been offered them though they had so much  virtue  as to refuse to take it Does not this circumstance alone sufficiently evince what opinion the persons offering the bribe must have of those to whom it was offered Oh fie fie for shame never make this confession again whether true or false as you value your very existence  Virtus post mortem  may serve well enough for a motto to the atchievement of a dead cheesemonger but the virtue even of a Critical Reviewer is not worth a groat to an author who is damned while he is alive  For decency's sake be a little consistent and for the future beware of extolling the works of strangers to the skies and of endeavouring afterwards to drag them down again when you find such writers know too much to be vain of your praises and are too sincere to become your friends In vain may

either afraid of the Caliban's resentment or fearful of setting a bad example to authors whom they would readily assist to maul any private gentleman yea a prince of the bloodroyal if he were dead and nailed in his coffin but not to barbacue a live printer By refusing to insert them however they robbed the publick of an egregious entertainment for it can hardly be doubted that the lovers of turtle

was found with the above stanzas Mr H insisted on it they were actionable at law and therefore proceeded gravely to lay the following queries before council  Query Whether it be not actionable at law for a poet to call a printer a hodmandod  If so what method is most advisable for the plaintiff to proceed in order to recover damages and what damages a Middlesex jury might be reasonably supposed to give  The answer to the above queries as I am informed were to the following purpose "An action on the case will undoubtedly lie Fact proved damages high proviso plaintiff proves hodmandod a fish of

the ingenuousness impartiality and urbanity of Sylvanus Urban Gent regarding the writings of Mr K and particularly his Review of Dr Johnson's Shakespeare  EVERY body knows who was the original Sylvanus Urban honest Cave who little as he knew of literature or science himself had yet so much knowledge and discretion as to set a just value on his friends and correspondents and behave to them at least with gratitude and common decency When the necessity indeed of employing persons of superior genius and learning obliged him to lean on some righthandman he could not always be accountable for what he was urged to do by others In time Sylvanus Urban became  a mere shadow and the goodwill of his friends was liable to be perverted by the caprice ignorance or illwill of his journeymeneditors How far the present Sylvanus is his own friend in admitting of such a perversion time hath already evinced in some degree and will daily exhibit more plainly Before I proceed any farther however I shall insert Mr Urban's account of Mr K's Review  This piece is written with a malignity for which it is very difficult to account as the authour declares that he is a stranger to Dr Johnson and never received any offence from him If his illwill arises from envy of the literary honour Dr Johnson has acquired or the mark of distinction he has received from his sovereign he is too much an object of pity to move any other passion in the breast either of Dr Johnson or his friends  If the writer of this paragraph suspects Mr K of the abovementioned motives from any thing his own heart suggests to him he is himself too much and too mean a wretch to  deserve  pity And that he could have any other grounds on which to form such a suspicion he is called upon to make appear  He has treated the bishop of Gloucester with the same acrimony that he has treated Dr Johnson yet he declares he has himself some literary reputation which he would not wantonly hazard being the author of two translations from the French besides several anonymous pieces which he says himself are too numerous to be good  Is this true Is this a specimen of Mr Urban's ingenuousness impartiality and veracity The truth is that Mr K in the Preface to his Review speaking of his not standing exactly in the same predicament with the author of the Canons of Criticism who had never written any thing before that piece thought it necessary to add the following note which the reader will see Mr Urban has not only mutilated and misrepresented but hath given it the most invidious turn  In confirmation of what is here asserted it may possibly be thought necessary to name some of those publications on which the public have conferred the honour of a favourable reception It is presumed needless however to particularize performances that would certainly have been less faulty had they been less numerous The author contents himself therefore with mentioning only his Epistles to Lorenzo  Can any thing be more pitiful and mean than the omission of the name of this work with a view to represent Mr K as a mere translator It is also foolish as mean for how long did this  ingenuous  critick think this expedient would serve him Did he think because when Mr K was an anonymous writer he despised these little artifices too much to take notice of them that when he had by name attacked their  chief  he would not take an opportunity to crush his pitiful dependents Or did they imagine that if Mr K should think them beneath his resentment he would find none to join him in so good a cause Could they conceive there was nobody who while he was roasting the colossus like an overgrown turkeycock for the entertainment of the publick would take the trouble to spit a dozen or two of his emissaries by way of larks to garnish the dish withal This critick was mistaken every    and the Translation of Rousseau's Eloisa and Emilius    This work consists principally of several conjectures  This is notoriously false Mr K having proposed very few conjectures his work consisting principally of rational illustrations of the poet or proofs positive of the ignorance of his commentators  which he has substituted for the conjectures of the Bishop and Dr Johnson frequently with as much confidence as if they were truths received by revelation and confirmed by miracle  Well and what then Why may not a writer speak confidently when he is convinced he is in the right And I don't find that either Mr Urban or any other of Dr Johnson's friends will venture to go aboot to prove Mr K in the wrong They may rail in general terms but if they meddle with particulars they will possibly only expose their own nakedness and be laughed at with the Critical ReviewersBut Mr K speaks says this  magaziner  as if his criticisms were truths  received by revelation and confirmed by miracle  If he received them by revelation however I presume there was no manner of occasion for his having them confirmed by miracle to warrant his confidence Their production was nevertheless so far miraculous that they were written in fewer days than Dr Johnson took years to compleat his work a circumstance which some wiseacres who never saw them urged publickly as a proof they could be good for nothing because said they  a man of moderate genius could not read the book in the time that Mr K  stans pede in uno  had produced a confutation of it  But while the justice of Mr K's criticisms in general remain incontestible I leave the publick to judge whether the rapidity of their composition redounds most to his credit or his dishonour  of these we shall give such a specimen as will  enable the reader to judge of the rest beginning where the author begins that our impartiality may not be brought into question  Would not any indifferent persons who should read the above passage imagine at least that the writer of it never once heard of the Reviewer or his writings in his life But are not Dr Hh and Mr Hy the editors and managers of the Gentleman's Magazine And is it possible that neither of these gentlemen remember that Mr K hath been an occasional contributor to their work from a very schoolboy And is this a specimen of the manners with which they treat a correspondent for whom they have more than once expressed the highest regard and for whose  valuable contributions  as they have called them they have even offered pecuniary gratifications which he never condescended to accept I have now in my hands sufficient proofs of what is here intimated and the Gentleman's Magazine affords various others of the  acknowledged  value of the papers Mr K hath sent it respecting very different branches of science and literature  Can the managers of that work be so mean and selfinterested as to treat Mr K in this scandalous manner because he has of late years been induced to favour other periodical works of the like kind They can have no other motive unless it be their closer attachment to Dr J But however they may have been  obliged to that gentleman and whatever opinion they may have of his literary abilities are candour truth and justice all to give way to their partiality for him Are the talents and reputations of the Doctors Johnson and Hh so very bulky that those both of the dead and the living must be mangled mutilated and depressed in order to allow them room enough to vapour in Surely the recent loss of a  Lloyd  and a  Churchill  might have rendered them a  little  more at ease in so wide a world But no They are determined to have the universe to themselves and their partizans condemning every one to defamation or obscurity who does not enlist under the banner of the colossus  Among numerous instances that might be brought of Mr Urban's misbehaviour in this kind to Mr K I shall only mention two or three which though beneath his own notice may serve as a specimen of those  little arts  by which some modern writers have wriggled themselves into fame and endeavoured to obscure the dawning reputation of others It is remarkable that the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine hath of late years carefully avoided mentioning the very name of Mr K though formerly pleased to print it in large capitals to a puerile and insignificant performance inserted so long ago as the year He hath been as cautious also of mentioning the  Epistles to Lorenzo  a work of established credit not only in the pitiful instance beforegiven but even in his list of books at the time of its publicationWhen he thought proper also lately to reprint the fable entitled  Reason and Imagination  written by the CELEBRATED  Mr Christopher Smart  as he himself stiles that gentleman and addressed to Mr K he judged it expedient even to mutilate that piece in order to omit the address as well as the following elegant compliment which is paid to Mr K at the conclusion  O  Kenrick  happy in the view  Of  Reason  and of  Fancy  too  Who reconcil'st with  Euclid's  scheme  The tow'ring flight and golden dream  With thoughts at once  restrain'd  and  free  I dedicate this tale to thee  At another time this editor promised his readers an abstract of what he called a  very sensible  anonymous pamphlet written by Mr K but having learned the name of the author before the next month's magazine appeared he somehow forgot his promise and possibly has not recollected it to this day And yet during all this time not the slightest occasion was neglected in which Mr Urban could compliment Dr Johnson or Dr Hawksworth But I fear my readers are sufficiently disgusted at the recapitulation of such minute and pitiful artifices which are as disgraceful to the profession of letters in general as to those who practise them in particular  I should otherwise mention some more serious and important causes of complaint proceeding obviously from the same source which Mr K hath farther to exhibit against the editor and manager of this magazine    They are here given to know however that Mr K detests all combinations in literature as much as he despises the monopolists of fame Let those who find themselves unable to stand alone combine to support each other Mr K will go hand in hand with any fair and open enquirer after literary or scientific improvement but he is neither so young and weak as to need the help of leadingstrings nor so old and feeble as to require the assistance of crutches But to proceed  Mr Urban pretends even after thus throwing out the most infamous and groundless insinuations concerning the motives for Mr K's Review to select such a specimen of it as may enable the reader to judge of the rest without calling his impartiality in question What these specimens are may be seen at the bottom of the page  The pretended impartial specimens of Mr

charge Mr Sylvanus Urban with telling  wilful lies  on this occasion Yet are they any better Modern politeness you will say requires me to suit my stile to the delicacy of the offender rather than to the enormity of the crime Well then I tell you Dr Hh "you are a fibber so you are you naughty man you and I won't love you nor will I give you any more marmalade or panada so I won't"Will this please or is it not sufficiently gentle and  candid      It is judged needless here to make any particular remarks on the above specimens as their falshood and partiality will be evident to every reader who compares the copy with the original  and how far they will justify his impartiality  is left to the reader to determine after having compared them with Mr K's Review  As to the insinuations themselves they are indeed too invidious and contemptible to require any other answer than may be deduced from the foregoing pages of this defence But if Mr Urban and his brother criticks will admit no man to have modesty or  virtue  but Dr J in whom even  indolence  and  insolence  is partially conceived to be such they may know that Mr K  hath at least  pride  enough to be above  envying  any man and  industry  enough to stand in no need of that  charity  whieh  idleness  must accept of or starve  Not that the word  charity  is the most proper term to give to pensions bestowed on those who have repeatedly represented them as the wages of iniquity But as I am willing to treat Dr J with all possible tenderness I would not give it so severe a name as is done by his pretended friends who represent it as a sort of hushmoney a kind of retaining fee to prevent him engaging his pen in opposite interests But if this be the case what is it better than a species of bribery and corruption And how does this differ from the wages of iniquity except that such wages are are received without being earned A mighty indelicate situation after all for a man of such consummate VIRTUE But I cannot close this note without taking some notice of what is advanced on this subject by the several  virtuous  critics who have censured Mr K's performance  They say Mr K's great quarrel with Dr J appears to be the latter's accepting a pension and yet they intimate the former would be glad of an opportunity of accepting one himself But pray if these gentry know nothing of Mr K as they pretend how can they take upon them to say he would be so glad of a pension And if they do know any thing of him they must know at the same time that notwithstanding Dr J's  bon mot  To be added to the  Johnsoniana  unless Mr K should yield to the pressing solicitations of Dr J's friends and be thence prevailed on to suppress those  choice sayings  in the next edition of his Review as in all probability he will the authenticity of some of them being  ingenuously  questioned by the very people from whose lips Mr K actually took them down  his industry enables him to live much better without a pension than Dr J can do with Besides the case is not parallel for though a pension might be acceptable to Mr K and to whom pray would it not he never railed at pensions nor abused placemen and pensioners in his life and if it were offered him could receive it as a reward for services done or at least intended to be done to his country But how a man of Dr J's known political principles could receive it without a blush and at the same time pretend to  modesty  and  virtue  is what I cannot conceive    All the world knows the  Adventurer  languished for a pension and long pined away at the disappointment nor will even his reputation supply its place notwithstanding  he may set an additional value on it  "And why should he not" you will say "Is not Dr H the editor of the immortal  Swift  as Dr J is of  Shakespeare  "Yes and hath doubtless done him equal honour in absurdly and falsly criticising on the stile of that spirited and admirable writer Oh if the ghost of  Swift  did but haunt Dr H as that of Shakespeare does Dr J How would that sarcastic spirit avenge himself on this piddling critick  But it is not for persons of such confined talents and pusillanimous dispositions to judge of the motives and actions of writers of more extensive knowledge and more manly abilities  If any of DrJ's partizans think they can defend him in the late outrage he hath committed against the memory and reputation of Shakespeare let them stand forth boldly and they shall be received like men But this it seems is not enough for the refined and elegant writers of the present age they must be treated with  tenderness  with  gentility  with sweatmeat and sugarcandy I warrant ye like fine ladies and peeking childrenOut upon such a pack of finicking fribbles with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins heads and those even minnikins mere dealers in frippery in the ragfair of Literature It is certainly a wonderful instance of a man's selfsufficiency to think himself able to encounter such diminitive opponents as these Here as Falstaff says is no vanity Dean Swift used to say of himself that he was too  proud  to be  vain  I will venture in this particular case to say the same of the Reviewer of Dr Johnson's Shakespeare and so Master Sylvanus good night to your Urbanity and to supper with what appetite you may  SECT VII  Remarks on the strictures of the Candid Reviewers and the other volunteer criticks that have taken upon them to abuse the Reviewer of Dr J's Shakespeare  IT is something remarkable that among all the writers who have drawn the pen on the present occasion against Mr K not one of them hath ventured to take the part of Dr J The  critical  Reviewers we have seen give him up entirely even Mr Urban himself says nothing in his defence The pretended acrimony of Mr K's manner indeed is disapproved by all parties but this I have already endeavoured to justify I shall proceed therefore to enquire how far those which are as yet unnoticed are justifiable in  their  manner of treating Mr KTo begin with the  Candid  Reviewers These  honest  gentlemen who have borrowed the whole of Mr K's preface as they did the month before the greater part of Dr J's have given such an inconsistent and motley account of the  Reviewer  's performance that it is very difficult to say whether they have most praised or censured it  In its  favour  they sometimes admit that "the matter of it does demand the highest approbation" That "Dr Johnson will find himself  unable  to reply to it"That "Mr Kenrick has very sufficiently shewn that Dr Johnson has played booty throughout his boasted edition"That "Mr K hath improved upon Dr J"That "they agree with Mr K that  Shakespeare still stands as much in need of a new edition as ever"That "he hath happily succeeded in giving by means of an easy interpretation a consistent meaning to several passages in regard to which other interpreters have run after farfetched explications"That "they entirely agree with him in the simple sense he gives to words and join with him in wondering how Warburton and others could ever puzzle themselves so much about them" c c  In its  disfavour  they insinuate that "Mr K has Committed blunders as well as other men who bragged as much witness poor Dr Warburton"That "Mr K has sometimes misapprehended his author's meaning as well as Dr Johnson"That "future observers will improve on Mr K and that he is therefore not fit to publish an edition of Shakespeare"That "Mr K instead of profiting by his own admonitions sometimes commits the same faults he blames in others" That they cannot help expressing "their admiration at the blessed effects which metaphysics and philosophy have upon criticism in poetry" intimating thereby that Mr K is too much of a philosopher to know any thing of poetryThat Mr K displays great inability in tracing out the beauty of poetic images and that his remarks are ridiculous  I shall not enter upon a confutation of the assertions of these critics the instances in which they presume to differ from Mr K being to the last degree absurd and contemptible as the reader may conclude from their affirming in the course of their critical investigation that Shakespeare had no knowledge of a  climax  which they are pleased to term a rhetorical gorgonfaced word They have sagaciously discovered also that Shakespeare acted with  very little  judgment in the execution of one of his greatest masterpieces of art But this is sufficient with regard to their literary strictures I come now to their personal ones and here they charge Mr K with having descended to make use of "scurrility abusive and even lowlived  Does not this polite epithet serve to shew that the writer himself must undoubtedly be a person in  highlife Ex ungue leonem  This critic to speak in his own dialect must certainly be a gentleman of  three cuts  Lowlived Could ever one have thought of such a word's getting into print and that by means of a professed critic too  O tempora O mores  Proud however as this gentleman may be of the  Dignity and Advantages of living in a Garret  See an ingenious pamphlet published some years ago with this title  I would not advise him to riot too luxuriously on rich sauces Spartan broth is a stimulating aliment especially when seasoned with garlick Those who live  high  seldom live  long  Nay my mind forebodes that even while I am now writing this son of  Candour  is no more The deathwatch ticks'tis even sohark I hear his knellpoordevil His spirit is departed 'Twere a dirty piece of work or I would rip him up and preserve his carcase like that of Duke Humphry in pickle If any charitable hand will do it for him it must be steeped well in the acrimony of Mr K's Review That may possibly keep it awhile aboveground But alas what pickle can long preserve a body that for want of proper stamina never was wholly alive and by the time it was half dead was quite rotten Ashes to ashes dirt unto dirt such is the end of modern  candour    petulance" with "ribaldry" with "bragging" with "foul language" with "being habituated to abusive blustering" with "wanting a pension to stop his mouth" with "being a voracious boreas" with "being a literary bruiser" with "fighting tooth and nail  like dogs and bears" and finally with "being a whimsical lynxeyed criticopoeticometaphysicomagico philosopher"  The reader will judge for himself how far a set of critics who are so admirably well skilled in calling names are to be credited in charging any writer with  scurrility petulance ribaldry  and  foullanguage  words I can assure him that are not to be found in Mr K's Review But it is not only against such critics as pretend to have read his performance that Mr K hath just cause of complaint There are those who condemn both him and his Review without seeing or knowing any thing of either except what is told them by Dr Johnson's partizans Nay several of these  candid  and  impartial  gentry began to rail openly in the public newspapers at sight of Mr K's advertisement only The terms of this truly were highly indecent it was a kind of hightreason a species of impiety even to imagine Dr Johnson could be  ignorant  or  inattentive  One would have thought him placed at the head of literature as the Roman pontiff is at the head of his church and with the same pretensions to infallibility Every body forsooth was expected to kiss pope Johnson's toe even at the hazard of having their foreteeth kicked out by his holiness's brutality But Mr K had never any inclination to be treated in so gross a manner as that in which he had heard Dr J had taken the liberty to behave towards some persons of the first rank in the world of science and letters It was reserved for him indeed to pay the doctor in his own coin and avenge the repeated insults received  by injured modesty To appeal to fact however in support of what is above asserted Mr K's Review was hardly published before a letter signed  J May  appeared in the London Chronicle evidently founded on the advertisement only in which Mr K was charged in gross terms with making use of FOULMOUTHED  language  of want of  decency goodmanners  and I know not whatWhat a  finemouthed  smoothtongued polished generation is the present This Mr Sweetlips was pleased to say "Whatever judgment the public may entertain of the late edition of Shakespeare the editor is too well known to have the charge of ignorance so easily admitted against him" Doubtless he is and it would in no shape have answered the Reviewer's end for the public to have been satisfied by his advertisement without reading his bookBy the readiness however with which Mr May and indeed all Dr J's friends seem to give up the editor of Shakespeare there is great reason to presume Mr K did not promise more in the newspapers than he effected in his pamphlet So that it appears Dr J is not so well  known  as this gentleman supposes His name indeed is in every body's mouth and it is possible there are few of those whom from their fondness for  fine writers  we may with propriety enough call  fine readers  who have not yawned with drowsy admiration over those quaint and insipid performances  Irene  and the  Idler  But these works support but a small part of Dr Johnson's literary reputation the foundation of which is laid so deep in the rubbish of erudition that it is impossible  for such superficial readers to discover it Like the spectator of the invisible cock however Mr  May  seems to be very sure it is thereThis same Mr J May also takes farther upon him to ask  who is this W K who so rudely steps forth from nobody knows where to attack a gentleman of known literary abilities  This gentleman must have very few connections and know little of what is doing in the literary world to have any occasion to ask such a question For whoever  he  be or whereever  he  comes from Mr K may certainly say with propriety to HIM  Not to know me argues thyself unknown  But perhaps this gentleman like the editor of Lloyd's Chronicle and some other writers who affected on the like occasion to speak of  one Mr K  as if an utter stranger to his existence may only know him too well having before smarted from the just severity of his critical pen If so Mr May is answered if not and he was really desirous of knowing something of Mr K he may have in some measure gratified his curiosity in the perusal of the foregoing sheets  The next gentleman I shall take notice of which shall be the last as there would be no end of pursuing anonymous writers is one Mr Hypercriticus who about the same time without ever having seen Mr K's book was incited to publish among other sagacious reflections the following wise sentences  From the very short time since the publication of Mr Johnson's edition of Shakespeare and from the very rapid  Another of Dr J's friends is angry with Mr K for a like reason remarking as before observed that Mr K  stans pede in uno  wrote his Review of Dr Johnson's book before a person of a moderate capacity could read itBut if Mr K is generally in the right and Dr J in the wrong I don't see how this reflects any disgrace on the former On the contrary if Mr K  stans pede in uno  hath given such a broadfooted colossus as Dr J a fall it shews him to be no bad wrestler So stand clear if you are upon the  offensive    progress of Mr Kenrick's remarks thereon I  believe  they must be crude and imperfect  Believe quoth he Is not this very candid and ingenuous But he proceeds to give a reason for the faith that is in him  For to pass a right judgment on books says Longinus requires a great length of time and a perfect knowledge of the subject  Well and what then The writings of Shakespeare might have been the object of Mr K's study for years and he might thence have acquired at least for what Hypercriticus knew to the contrary a perfect knowledge of the subject and if so no longer time would be requisite for him to point out Dr Johnson's mistakes than was necessary to read his book But says this gentleman  I  suppose  Mr K is a critick by intuition one who in regard to books sees into the merit of the whole by reading only a part  As we had before a  believe  here we have a  suppose  Are not these very pretty grounds to proceed on to the condemnation of a writer unread But how if what I just now asserted be true that Shakespeare's writings have been many years the favourite object of Mr K's reading and study how if he hath long since accumulated materials for an edition of that poet as  is also true I say how Mr Hypercriticus in this case can you justify your precipitate censures and what becomes of your  suppose  And to suppose for once it was not so surely Mr K might as you say judge of the  whole  by reading a  part  with as much propriety as you judge of his performance by reading only his advertisement in the newspapers Why might not he be without a  suppose  a critick intuitively as well as you But "sarcasm you say is unmannerly" I wish that where you learned to be so very  mannerly  you had only learned also to be equally  ingenuous  you would have saved me the trouble and yourself the mortification of this reprehension I say the same to all the rest of the mannerly candid decent delicate partizans of Dr Johnson who have on this occasion been attempting to box in mufflers or throwing dirt with their gloves on As to the former Mr K is too hardy to feel their puny efforts to offend him and as to the latter he cannot help smiling to see how easily their pellets dry and rub out while they themselves are begrimed up to the ears in vainly endeavouring to bespatter him  Having now done with particular altercation I should here leave both Mr K and Dr J to stand or fall by the judgment of the publick had there not been some strictures let fall in some of the papers levelled against Mr K charging him with as great a want of  modesty  as he hath done Dr J with want of  knowledge  I shall therefore beg leave to say a word or two on both these topicks viz on the  modesty of men of letters  and on  literary knowledge  SECT VIII  On the modesty of men of letters  OF all kinds of  modesty  whether real or affected perhaps that of  Authors  is the most singular  A modest Author  It is a kind of contradiction in terms and sounds to my ear exactly like the expression of a  modest strumpet  There is no doubt that a man may be a modest man before he commence writer as a gentleman may be an honest gentleman before he be made ministerofstate or as even a butcher may have some bowels of compassion before he turn bumbailiff but no sooner are they initiated into the  routine  of their respective offices than modesty honesty and humanity take flight and leave them  This is severe you will sayIt is so but it is nevertheless founded in truth and may be applied to many writers now living and probably likely to live so long as they can get any thing by prostituting either their talents or reputation  Certain it is that a closer parallel can hardly be drawn between any two known characters than between a common scribbler and a common strumpet How bashfully doth the young enamorato of the muses look at you when you speak to him about publishing his first production even as an innocent countrywench blushes up to the eyes when you first talk of untying her garter But when they have been a while tumbled over in the sheets the virginmodesty  of both is pretty equal There is this difference between them indeed that the one grows bold by losing reputation and the other by gaining it This difference however does not in the least alter their conduct or appearance when they come upon the town the reputation then aimed at by both being very different from what they either lost or gained The one seeks not to improve his talents any more than the other her charms but both apply assiduously to display and make the most of what they possess and if they covet fame it is generally with a secondary view to the venal purposes of prostitution  Thus an author whose abilities are exhausted and a courtezan whose charms are decayed may still live upon the emoluments arising from their fame Let them but get their names recorded in a  Race  See a poem so called in which Dr J is celebrated among other things for his  modesty  and in like manner Paul Vt who wears a little smart bob is described as overwhelmed by a wig more tremendous than Dalmahoy's  or a  Meretriciad  and they may still remain the favourites of purblind fops and superficial witlings  Is it possible that such characters can have any real modesty however necessary they may find it to assume its appearance artfully to impose on the world  Not but that there are degrees both in venality and impudence so that as a  demirep  may be  comparatively  modest and disinterested so may an  author  But to drop the comparison as there are many writers of a more liberal stamp than to come under any denomination that will rank them in this parallel writers who while they labour to instruct and entertain the publick labour equally to improve themselves and to render their future writings more valuable from the encouragement  given to the present I must own I cannot help thinking that such writers debase themselves greatly whenever they affect the false modesty of unexperienced tyros or designing ignorants There is a species of assurance in men of real knowledge which may be said without impropriety to be consistent with the modesty becoming their character as they could not possibly divest themselves of it without evident hypocrisy and affectation As to authors by profession they must necessarily either display their assurance by insisting on their own merit or in fact confess themselves bunglers or impostors And indeed why should they not If an artist discover any mode of mechanical operation or execute a piece of mechanism which is an improvement on what others have done before him or what nobody can execute but himself who charges him with want of modesty in boldly asserting his own preeminence Why then should a critick a philosopher an historian or a poet be thought too assuming in laying publick claim to that merit which they actually possess What should we think of an artizan or manufacturer who should in his advertisements and shopbills  modestly  affect a diffidence of being able to give his customers satisfaction having himself a mean opinion of his own abilities Should we not conclude without hesitation that he was either a knave or fool or both Yet how common is it to meet with authors who have been many years  in trade  ridiculously affecting to think meanly of productions which they nevertheless importunately obtrude on the publick and make us pay for at as high  a price as possible Yet many of these writers have the character of being modest men In my opinion however I think it an instance of very great  impudence  to say no worse of it for a man to offer me a commodity at a great price and to tell me at the same time he thinks it good for little For what is this in fact but to tell me that he thinks me as great a fool as he confesses himself to be a knave  And yet if a writer were to use the same arguments in the preface of his book to set off his works to advantage as an artizan or manufacturer is allowed to do his in his shop or warehouse he would of course be condemned for want of  modesty  Thus we see a very modest man may incur the obloquy of being an impudent author and a very impudent author acquire the reputation of being a modest man  The true state of this matter seems to be this Ignorance and impudence as generally go together as innocence and modesty but ignorance being often the companion and sometimes even the guardian of innocence it is no wonder that impudence should put on the appearance of modesty in order to make us take mere ignorance for pure innocence  Knowledge as naturally inspires fortitude as truth abominates hypocrisy How absurd is it then to require men of real abilities to affect that diffidence and ignorance to which they must necessarily be strangers At the same time what can we think of those writers who after being long hackneyed in the ways of men and of their profession who after setting themselves up even at the head of that profession pretend  to tremble while they write  to  bow down with reverential awe to superior learning  to  kiss the rod of correction  c c What I say can we think of such writers but that sensible of their own ignorance or imbecillity they are cajoling the publick in a manner that deserves the name of the highest  impudence  Much more modest and manly is it for a writer of years and experience to assert boldly and confidently what he hath good reason to think he knows  And if he has not such reason he should not trouble the publick with his reveries  and openly to defy every groundless imputation or insinuation of ignorance  SECT IX  On literary knowledge with some remarks on  IGNORANCE  and  INATTENTION  IT hath been frequently observed that the knowledge of  words  is not the knowledge of  things  Indeed the distinction between the  scholar  and the man of  science  is now become general It is nevertheless certain that a man cannot be a considerable proficient in philology particularly with regard to the modern languages without having made some acquisitions in science It is not my intent however to expatiate here on this distinction or to enhance the preference due to science above mere literature my intention being  only to throw out a few short observations on literary knowledge in general  Be not vain of thy learning child said my grandfather to me when I was a boy I have lived to forget more than thou hast learned in thy whole life  All this was very true and yet I thought myself nevertheless as good a scholar as my grandfather for when we were sometimes both at a loss for a word or two of Greek I found the only difference between us was that I turned to the Lexicon for those I never knew and he for those he could not remember but my  copia verborum  was nevertheless equal to his  Now it would be a matter of some importance to determine whether a man can with propriety be said to know what he cannot remember even though he should have formerly had it perfectly impressed in his memory  I am afraid that we shall go nigh to be laughed at by the vulgar should we admit that a man may be said to know what he hath forgot and can't tell us if we ask him And yet if he should recollect it halfanhour hence without any body's telling him in the mean time surely he must have had such knowledge in him at the time of his being asked since it does not appear that he had by any external means acquired it since  This would afford a curious and subtle disqusition but as I have not time to enter here into a profound investigation of all the difficulties that suggest themselves concerning it I shall only make an application of it to the  learning of the two last editors of Shakespeare and leave the reader to make it out as well as he can  Mr K hath proved in several parts of his Review of Dr J's edition that the said editor either did not then know or had forgot the meaning of several words and passages which it is plain the Doctor must have formerly known and probably would have recollected some odd time or other I shall instance only one or two In one the very learned Doctors J and W both appear not to know the meaning of the word  convene  Dr W objecting to Shakespeare's proper use of it and Dr J adopting the said objection and yet Mr K hath justified Shakespeare and convicted both the editors on the authority of Dr J's own Dictionary  Again in regard to the use of the old phrase  taken with the manner  both these learned editors flatly contradict themselves asserting in one volume that it is used one way and in another volume that it is used differently  I might mention many other instances of the like kind but these will suffice for my present purpose What I want to know is whether these are instances of  ignorance  or not  Dr J's friends will say "O no he certainly knew better" Knew better when What when he was told of the blunder I suppose Surely that man may justly be called  ignorant  whose knowledge how great soever is out of the way when it is wanted  Will it be said these are not instances of  ignorance  but  inattention  Pray what is  inattention  Do you  mean to say that the Doctor did not read these passages or that he read them when he was asleep  If he read them and was wide awake these mistakes could never have happened from  inattention  but must have been derived from  forgetfulness  which according to the arguments above adduced must be a species at least of  ignorance  But the criticks will possibly ask me what I mean by being  wide awake  and by Dr J's  reading  these passages They will say perhaps that they know as well as I that when a commentator reads a passage over he must comprehend it some way or other right or wrong and that no  inattention  in that case can prevent the operation of his judgment respecting the words that lie before him so that if he then mistakes it must be through  ignorance  But this was not the case it may be said Dr J could never dream that Dr W could be mistaken so grossly in matters so clear and obvious and therefore copied those passages implicitly from Dr W's Comment so that it was nothing more than  inattention  Call you this method of proceeding  inattention  It is such  wilful negligence  that your friend Dr J will hardly be obliged to you for thus defending him from the charge of  ignorance  for surely if we may not call it want of  knowledge  we must call it want of something else which a man of acknowledged  virtue  should not be without What would a similar conduct to this be called in any of the common concerns of life Happy is it undoubtedly for the present race of authors that they ALL  being pensioned  can subsist and provide for their families without being obliged to publish their works by subscription for after such flagrant instances of  inattention  and that in a writer of the first reputation for learning and  virtue  what encouragement can any other of less note or less reputed virtue ever hope to meet with  The late Mr Fielding speaking somewhere of those gentlemen who had tied themselves up as it was then called from subscribing to works of genius and literature expresses his resentment against them by saying it is a pity they were not tied up in good earnest but what do those authors deserve who first gave occasion for people entering into such illiberal engagements  And what doth Dr J in particular deserve for having obtruded on the world the worst Commentary of Shakespeare that ever appeared and at the same time for having by his procrastination and neglect so effectually disgusted the publick with editors and subscriptions that it is presumed the ablest commentator in the kingdom would find little encouragement for a similar undertaking notwithstanding as the criticks justly observe SHAKESPEARE  stands  NOW  in more need of a  NEW EDITION  than ever  R R  POSTSCRIPT ADDRESSED TO THE MONTHLY REVIEWERS  I Cannot help thinking it a little fortunate gentlemen that your observations on Mr K's Review appeared before the printer had quite finished the foregoing sheets as it affords me an opportunity of adding a word or two by way of reply to your observations on his  extraordinary  Review It is indeed not without reason you give it that appellation but pray do you mean thereby to insinuate that nobody hath a right to make use of the word  Review  but yourselves Have you an exclusive privilege to it like that which is laid to the  Post  or to the  Gazette    It is true that you  monthly  gentlemen have the right of prior occupancy over your periodical rivals who deal like yourselves in the wholesale branch of criticism But because you are wholesale dealers are you therefore to be monopolizers Must every Review extraordinary be stigmatized as an extraordinary Review because it is not fabricated or vended in your workshop or warehouse  It was doubtless horridly provoking to have your work taken out of your hands and dispatched while  you were whetting your edgetools But why therefore find fault with the tools of another artizan whose work you do not seem to disapprove so much as his manner of executing it Surely Dr J might as well suffer by a Tomahawk as a cleaver Is it not as well to be scalped by a Mohawk as to be knocked on the head or have one's throat cut by a carcasebutcher And pray how do you differ from the sanguinary assassins of Whitechapel and Cowcross except that yours are intellectual and theirs are animal victims They only mangle the body You mortify the very soul and must expect to be mortified in turn For let me tell you in the first place that even your witty conceit of comparing Mr K to a Mohawk or a Cherokee will never be thought your own by those who recollect the Cherokees and Iroquois that Bishop W is charged with having set on the back of Dr Lowth You critical gentlemen seem indeed to be all terribly mistaken with regard to the place of Mr K's nativity The  Critical  Reviewers and Chroniclers declared him to be a  Tartar  and you insist upon his being a Mohawk or a Cherokee Indian It is a pretty long poststage from the desarts of Tartary to the wilds of America We know indeed that you speak metaphorically and tho' farfetched so far it is excusable but let us see if the hyperbole is not to be found among your other tropes and figures You say  the  Reviewer  Mr K seems to be one of those violent assailants whose aim is not merely to vanquish but even to  exterminate  his antagonist  It is well you put in that qualifying  seems  But you say positively  that he endeavours to expose his antagonist as a very  pretender  to all literature and science  This you say is quite outrageousAnd so it might be were it strictly true but you will please to observe Mr K does not  positively deny  that Dr Johnson is master of the languages and sciences he only says it  does not appear  so to  him  Who knows but Mr K might here modestly intend to insinuate his own inability to comprehend the amazing stores and vast profundity of Dr Johnson's science and erudition Why then would you not give him credit for the appearance of being in so mild and promising a disposition  And that these criticks might justly have done it had they been inclined to shew Mr K fair play will appear sufficiently from the passage hinted at with the note he hath annexed "I do not say" says Mr K  that Dr Johnson may not probably be well skilled in  some  things not that  I know  that he is well skilled in any  I will except indeed the article of  literary composition  in which so far as the merit of a speech an essay a life or a novel goes he is undoubtedly the best writer in Christendom  for though I have read  all  his  works  I declare he does not  appear to me  at least so far as I myself am able to judge to be  master  of any  one science  or any  one language  Not that I  deny  him to be master of the  whole circle of sciences  and of  all languages ancient and modern  Surely Mr Monthly Reviewer it is you that are  outrageous  for Mr K speaks here with becoming modesty and diffidence  Be this however as it may you are certainly mistaken in supposing that Mr K hath questioned the abilities of Dr J as a man of science a critick and philologist merely because the Doctor as you say mistook his talents in undertaking an edition of Shakespeare In reading the preceding sheets  you will have seen that although the violation of Shakespeare was the first fault for which the Doctor happens to be publickly arraigned it was by no means the first fact in which he had been caught and for which he would sooner or later have certainly been indicted by his present prosecutor  But I see how the matter stands with you periodical criticks Your own credit rests on too tottering a basis for you to indulge yourselves safely in any inclination you might have to chastise writers of  established reputation  You are therefore reduced in a manner to the necessity of displaying your dexterity in the manual exercise of the critical scourge on objects just striving to go alone without any body to support them This behaviour doubtless redounds greatly to the honour of your prowess and magnanimity and as the notice I here take of it may possibly have some little effect on your censorial dignity if not on the interest of your proprietor I shall take the liberty of giving both him and you a word of advice for the regulation of your future conduct I must own indeed that the Monthly Review from its regularity in coming to town for so many years full or empty hath obtained the reputation of being one of the most respectable stagecoaches on the highroad of Parnassus but Mr Gh that is Mr  Geeho  the driver will give me leave to tell him that if he continues to detain his passengers such a confounded while at Turnhamgreen clogging his wheels so cursedly with the coom of dullness to make them run smooth some other  Jehu  on the same road  will infallibly set up a postcoach with steel springs that will beat him hollow It is besides almost become scandalous now to have the best place in this carriage for look at their horses no fewer than six of them you see but how they're matched black white and pyebald lame blind and spavin'd The very picture of the mockcavalcade of the Grand Masons Then you see the two forehorses drag the whole team An Hammersmith stage tugged by a horse and a half gets a mile a head of them before they reach Hydeparkcorner I myself have even sometimes rode on the coachbox when Geeho being a goodnatured fellow would let me hold the reins for halfanhour or so but I might cry  auy auy  till my lungs burst before I could mend their pace It was indeed a miracle to me that we ever got in time to town when I observed that no two horses ever pulled together and more than one of them hung an arse and drawed backwards all the way  But to drop the allegory  You speak of Mr K's having treated Dr J with extraordinary  freedoms  Pray Sir who is Dr J that Mr K may not treat him at his own peril with as much freedom as he pleases If S J be  artium magister  W K is  philosophiae doctor  and so far upon a footing If S J be L L D W K is J U D If Mr K also was not educated at the universities that complimented him with his degrees Dr J stands in the same predicament with regard to those learned seminaries that dignified him with his There is to be sure this difference between the two doctors that the  latter never has thought it worth while like the former to advertise such insignifant circumstances in the magazines and newspapers holding in very slight estimation such literary endowments as may be purchased at a Scotch university for ten pounds at almost any German one for twenty ducats and may be had as Dr H knows from Lth merely at the moving solicitation of a printer  Again you ask Sir whether Mr K is not apprehensive on account of his severity of sharing the fate of Tom Osborne That is in plain terms of Dr J's  knocking him down  This is to be sure a very concise and  liberal  method of determining literary merit and possibly may have some effect on the Monthly Reviewers This intimidating intimation indeed may in some measure serve to account for the tremendous influence of Dr J's personal and literary authority in general For who will hesitate to commend or dare to contend against a writer possessed of such  knockmedown  See Foote's Minor  arguments You will please to take this along with you however that although Mr K may not have such terrific talents nor be quite so much of a  brute  See an ingenious copy of verses lately published in the St James's Chronicle wherein the Dr is proved on the confession of his own friends to be indeed the  Prince of beasts  a conclusion at which neither Dr J nor his friends could reasonably take offence one of them having thought proper in a copy of verses before printed in the same paper very politely to compare Mr K and his friends to a parcel of  moakies  and at the same time o liken the surly grumbling of the Dr himself to the contemptuous growling of the  on  This versifier however affords not the  first  example wherein the ear of pusillanimity hath been deceived by the braying of an ass in a lion's skin How far Dr J may be compared to such an animal so disguised time will shew Mr K not having begun to strip off that skin but with a determined resolution to exhibit the real creature sooner or later in  puris naturalibus  as many more celebrated writers he may possibly  be found on trial as much of a  man  in every respect as the best of them  Could you imagine then Mr  Monthly  that Mr K would not resent that partiality which you have evidently betrayed in your remarks on  his  Review This partiality is the more evident from your very different and favourable construction of the stile and manner of a pamphlet recently published against one of the gentlemen attacked by Mr K I mean Dr Lth's Letter to Dr Wn the acrimony severity and scurrility of which are in every respect much greater than is to be found in the strictures of Mr K on Dr J And yet this is with you the  elegant  and unexceptionable production of a  gentle  and amiable writer displaying equally the abilities of the scholar and the gentleman Nay you yourself Mr Critick have quoted some passages wherein the language and allusions are as  low  as possible and indeed hardly grammatical What do you think of this writer's accusing a bishop of the church in plain terms with having been guilty  of  sneering  at the original Scriptures with making use of farfetched conceit and forced pleasantry void of wit of meaning of common sense and  common decency  with using low banter illiberal burlesque upon the prophets the apostles and the holy Scriptures  You will  please to observe that such a charge as this brought against such a character is not only scurrilous but if false is to the last degree base and injurious And pray how is the truth of such problematic accusations to be proved Who is to judge whether the passages hinted at in Dr W's writings be such  low banter  and  illiberal burlesque  or not Is Dr L himself to judge of this or you Mr Monthly Reviewer Give me leave to say you will find no such  equivocal  accusations brought by Mr K against Dr J If he hath charged him with being  ignorant  and  inattentive  he hath given repeated proofs of the truth of his assertion If he hath called Dr J  indolent selfsufficient  or  arrogant  is he not notoriously all these If Mr K hath at any time suggested the Doctor's want of  apprehension  or  invention  he hath in like manner proved it After all which I would be glad to know where is the illiberality or scurrility of Mr K's laughing at him and calling him  dull  nay even though he should insinuate that he hath no more imagination than a leaden plummet and say he was the  dullest animal of all commentators  For pray where is the harm of all this even whether it be true or false That the Doctor is a commentator such a one as he is nobody will deny that he is an  animal  and a very strange one too every body will own and as  dullness  even in the highest or lowest degree is by no means criminal I cannot see how reflections of this kind can be with any consistent pretence to impartiality be deemed illiberal and scurrilous by criticks who have admitted the above instance quoted from Dr L to be elegant refined  or polite It is true that Mr K hath strongly insinuated that Dr J hath not done justice either to his subscribers or to the proprietors in his edition of Shakespeare And hath not he proved it Nay doth not the event of its publication sufficiently shew that he had no need to have given himself the trouble to prove what all the world admit to be true If on this account he hath treated Dr J severely the Doctor hath just the same right of complaint as a pickpocket who gets only horse whipped or pumped instead of a severer punishment Ought not the Doctor to do as he does shake his ears slink quietly off and think himself happy  it is no worse    It is true Mr K hath charged Dr J with an invidious design of detracting from the moral and religious character of Shakespeare But in what manner has he done thisNot by a mere verballyabusive declaration of the fact in general but by a spirited and fair allegation supported by particular testimonies  And yet notwithstanding all this Mr K truly is with you an  Orlando Furioso  in criticism a very  Mohawk  a  Cherokee  and what not  Surely this instance of the  Monthly  Reviewer's partiality toward Mr K will sufficiently obviate the foolish suspicions of the Candid Reviewers and others of his being  himself  connected with that work What because a man may have been accidentally obliged to take up his lodgings in a stable is he to be deemed an horse or an ostler for ever after Misfortune may bring a man acquainted as Trinculo says with strange bedfellows but it is his own fault if he does not change his companions with his circumstances    A word more and I have done You have been pleased to express some reluctance at spreading what  you term  personalities  There are many gentlemen also to whose judgment Mr K is ready to pay the greatest deference who express themselves on the present occasion in the same strain Nay even some of Dr J's friends goodnaturedly affect like the  Monthly  Reviewers to think Mr K hath forgot  the respect due to his own rank in the republick of letters  by descending as they call it to  such personalities  But if they say this of the author of the  Review of Dr J's Shakespeare  what will they say of the author of this  Defence  of itDoubtless ten times worse but I care notAs to all those who are justly reprehended in this pamphlet they will of course exclaim loudly against my having exposed the petty  particulars  of their pitiful and disingenuous conduct with regard to Mr K and his writings They will naturally cry it down as  low  as  il  iberal  and so forth It is not for the interest of  offenders  that their actions should be too  minutely  scrutinized they must unanimously plead for the use of  general  reflections only in order that the accusation may  like a wildgoose fly unclaimed of any man  but the justice due to the individual  person  injured claims a like peculiar retaliation of  personalities  It were a degradation indeed of any man's character to become a common thieftaker or informer but it can be none for him to seize or prosecute those who may have meanly picked his own pocket or basely attempted to assassinate his friend It would redound in like manner little to the honour of a man of rank or fortune to stoop so low as to go to boxing with a Slack or a Broughton  but perhaps the first nobleman in the kingdom would not be displeased to possess their athletic abilities in which case I apprehend the world would think it no impeachment of his dignity if highly provoked he should for once wave his privilege and chastise the offender of what rank so ever at his own weapons And thus even supposing Mr K's enthusiastic plea of  justifying the dead  should in the more prudential opinion of the  living  be condemned as chimerical he hath at  worst  only indulged his  passions  at the expence of his  politeness  and waved his pretensions as "the  scholar  and the  gentleman  " to  expose  his abilities as a MAN  gentle  or  simple  as the reader may determine  In the mean time nothing could be more unbecoming Mr K than through meanness or affectation to sue for that determination in his favour which the publick without knowing it have in a great degree already made For however  unnecessarily particular  I may be thought to have been in the foregoing sheets the publick are yet to learn the principal motives of that confidence which Mr K seems on their suffrage to have assumed  The  Reviewer of Dr Johnson's Shakespeare  indeed hath too long and too successfully laboured in the literary vineyard  Like a  MOLE says the ingenious and sarcastical author of the  Traveller  This troglodite however▪ hath now made his appearance aboveground and possibly Mr G as well as Dr J wishes he had remained working like a  mole  still  to need  now  by any servile or sinister means to solicit his reward No the small portion  of literary fame to which Mr K hath at any time made or hereafter may make pretensions he claims with proper deference to the publick not as a  favour  but as his  due  He thinks it not less disgraceful to  beg  of the multitude than of an individual and as he would not willingly  give  undeserved applause to  others  he scorns to  accept  it  himself  His demands are few and his expectations  moderate  but such as they are he hath sufficient reason to think they will be complied with for in spite of artifice and cabal  Yet to so great a height is this spirit of caballing carried that if a speedy check be not put to it the pubiick must soon be content with such entertainment as is catered for them by a junto of opulent printers and booksellers The reader will hardly believe it possible yet so it is that I applied myself with regard to the present performance to near half a dozen different publishers before I could find one who would venture to sell a pamphlet  reflecting  as they said on the respectable and tremendous compilers and printers of the  Reviews Magazines  and  Evening Chronicles  Such is the present state of literature in which it is in vain that the  liberty of the press  is secured by law when the publication of what is printed and even the printing what is written unless a man hath a press of his own may be prevented by the combinations of printers and booksellers  sooner or later the PUBLICK  will be  JUST  R R  FINIS
