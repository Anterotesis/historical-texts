Good Day to my dear Friend what News have you  Wildish  I have been with the General to reconnoitre the Enemy they have not disturb'd our Foragers but lie within their own Camp very quiet  Heart  Sure if the Marquiss  De Bay  had a true Intelligence of the Weakness of our Intrenchments and the Mortality of our Men he would have attack'd us before now  Wild  In all the Campaigns I have served on these Frontiers I never knew it so sickly the General continues very much out of Order at  Estremoz  they think both the Major Generals will die and my Brigadier was carried to  Elvas  last Night  Heart  Then at present Brigadier General  Conquest  commands our Forces  Wild  Most certainly  Heart  The Death of half a Dozen of these great Men would make a fine Alteration in our Titles  Wild  I will assure you Brigadier General  Conquest  could observe you were not at his Levee this Morning  Heart  Why I was upon the Piquet where you know Drinking hard is the main Part of the Dutybesides I never appear at the General's but upon Business for I can't slatter and have a Stiffness between my Shoulders that makes me incapable of Bowing low  the Noise of the Peace gives me no prospect of rising being pretty well assured the youngest Captain of an old Regiment must wait for another War to get a better Title  Wild  Why I was once of the Gang of those silly Fellows whose Ambition climb'd no higher than a Company in an old Regiment which gave me a very distant Prospect of being provided for in Peace when 'twas fifty to one I was knock'd on the Head before the War was over  Heart  Human Nature has always imprinted in us a Desire for Something above us so gives us a Rotation of Uneasiness and scarce in an Age do we meet with a Man that sits down pleased with his Condition but we all lay Schemes and make the present Time a Plague to us in seeking after the next Plague which is still to make us but the more miserable  Wild  The Fever or the Bullet converts us to Dust and Ashes and our next Heirs are left at Liberty to play the Fool after the same Manner but hang these dismal Reflections  Heart  Is there no Courier from  Lisbon  or News of a Packet from  England  Wild  We hourly expect onesince our Forces have been ill the  Portugueze  avoid us and what is strange none of their Men have the Distemper amongst them  Heart  Their Beads the Priest's Blessing and their Garlick are strong Preservatives of HealthBut see either my Sight fails me or that Officer coming this Way is my dear Major  Buck  Wild  And with him a clever Parcel of Recruits  Heart  They come to our Regiment very apropos for we have scarce Men enough to mount the Guard  Enter Major  Buck Wilmot  in Granadier's Cloaths Serjeant  Fileoff  several other Recruits with two Soldier's Wives  Major  Buck  Dear  Charles  Heart  Dear Major  Major  Buck  Dear  Frank  to  Wildish  I'm intirely yours  Wild  Dear Boy I'm overjoy'd to see you well  Major  Buck  I am very much surpriz'd to find you so for on our March we heard a raging Sickness had swept most of you away  Wild  The Distemper and false Musters have taken off most of our Men but prithee what news from  England  I know thou art a concise pretty Fellow that can abbreviate an Account without giving us Cause to ask impertinent Questions  Major  Buck  I left all our Friends well at  London  paid my Taylor's Bill which was due last Voyage adjusted my Accounts with our Rogue of an Agent gave Security to St  Martin  's Parish for my Washerwoman's Bastard mounted my PostHorse at NoonDay reach'd  Falmouth  the Moment the  Mercury  honest Captain  Green  was failing which had on Board my strapping Recruits reached  Lisbon  in five Days and after a fatiguing March of ten more am this moment arrived to my great Satisfaction having met with my two best Friends  Heart  Well But prithee  pulling him  Wild  P'shaw  Hearty  Hold thy Tongue and let me ask him some Questions  pulling him  Major  Buck  Looky' Gentlemen These hailing Digressions of yours will very much prolong the Time my Story might be told in come not within Arm's Length of me and I will give you all the News all the Scandal all the Fashions and all the Pleasures of the Town  Heart  and  Wild  Agreed then  Major  Buck  First I left our Royal Mistress in a very good State of Health reigning intirely in the Hearts of her People whose Representatives are doing Wonders and by their well timed Zeal and vast Supplies shew the World they are still able to Balance  Europe  's Power  Heart  and  Wild  Very good  Major  Buck  The Taxes are paid chearfully there's no Discount upon  Exchequer  Bills and honest Soldiers are trusted by every Body St  James  's CoffeeHouse is full of grave Statesmen whimsical Gentry and coxcombly Physicians  Young Man  's is filled with Military  Beau's Sea Gentlemen and Admiralty Clerks  Garraway  's with Knaves Aldermen Agents Commissioners of  Excise  and now and then a straggling Beau And the  Court of Request  with Country Gentlemen Petitioners Freeholders Sheriffs and Politicians that hate Business The Women of Quality have that discerning Taste of good Sense that they always crowd the front Boxes at a good Play And our rakelly young Fellows live as much by their Wits as ever and to avoid the clinkling Dun of a Boxkeeper at the End of one Act they Sneak to the opposite Side 'till the End of another then call the Boxkeeper saucy Rascal ridicule the Poet laugh at the Actors march to the Opera and spunge away the rest of the Evening The Women of the Town take their Places in the Pit with their wonted Assurance The middle Gallery is filled with the middle Part of the City And your high exalted Galleries are graced with handsom Footmen that wear their Master's Linen and their Mistresses Favours  Wild  P'thaw These are Generals make haste and come to Particulars  Major  Buck  Why About three Months since in a Rencounter with a Lady I got a Wound in my Constitution which was patched up by  Bucheir  Heart  With whose help I suppose you slatter yourself you are sound  Major  Buck  As a military Constitution can be In short I levee'd all the Generals and rising Statesmen I taked and broke Windows talk'd Politicks beat the Watch and bilk'd Coachmen went into Mourning for my Father and was drawn into half a Dozen Duels on my Friends Account and kill'd no Body won Money at Gaming and yet used no false Dice I went through all the Pleasures of the Town without being a Bubble to any of them saw all the handsome Women without falling in Love and am come to serve under our General without Reluctancy  Wild  Mighty concise truly  Heart  Our Regiment is incamped on the Right of the Rear Line you had best give Order that your Men pitch your Tent next mine  Major  Buck  My Baggage will be here immediately  Wild  Are there any new Fashions  Major  Buck  This is my last new Coat made exactly after the Manner of Beau  Whimsey  's This is the smart new fashion Cock and this is the genteel walking Air we salute thuswe ogle as we us'd to do we have cut off all the superstitious Ceremonies that attended our Love Passions improve every Opportunity come slap dash Alamode  de Paris  to the Question at once give the Women no Time to think of the Spirit and you are sure of their Persons  Heart  Who came over in the Packet with you  Major  Buck  Half a Dozen very wretched Volunteers with prodigious strong Recommendations and a Couple of small Ware Pedlars who call themselves  Lisbon  Merchants of whom I bought these Baubles  Enter as from Horseback  Victoria  and  Belinda  Vict  Did you observe  Belinda  the profound Respect we were received with as we rid along the Line my  Spanish  Jennet was himself proud of my Father's Commanding the  British  Forces and carried me with an Air of Greatness  Bel  I never saw the Brigadier look better than he does to Day the Morning is extreamly fine  Vict  I think our whole Family are pretty well seasoned with the Country and could I disengage myself from the mean spirited Creature my Father has provided for a Husband you and I should pass our Time most pleasantly  Bel  Prithee pluck up a Spirit and tell him down right you won't be married  Vict  He has been in every thing else the best of Fathers and if possible I'll strive to oblige him in this though if it were not for my Mother's violence I believe I might persuade him from it  espying Major Buck  Dear Child what pretty Fellow is that with  Wildish  and  Hearty  Bel  'Tis Major  Buck  I suppose just arrived from  England  he will be the Talk of the Camp for one Month  Vict  Prithee why so  Bel  For rakish Exploitsin  Lisbon  every Street us'd to be alarm'd by him his Father died since he has been in  England  and has left him a thousand Pounds a Year which will give him the Opportunity of committing a Thousand more Vices than he us'd to do  Vict  He's really a pretty Fellow Why could not my Father have picked out such a Man for me  Bel  Oh fie Child He's the wickedest young Fellow in the World and won't suffer any Body to speak in the Behalf of a virtuous Woman  Vict  If he is a Man of Sense that Wildness and Gayety will wear off  Bel  Oh Never Never He's a nauseous Fellow I can't help thinking the  Santista  Mr  Bisket  a much more agreeable Man than he  Vict  Now you rally me  Belinda  I am but just come to bear the fight of him and fear I never can be brought to like him  Bel  Mr  Bisket  's assable Temper and good Nature will soon work upon you  The Gentlemen talk  Wild  These are pretty Baubles for a Man of an Estate to Murder Money with  Heart  Very pretty Trifles truly  Major  Buck  What charming Creatures are these  Heart  One is your old Friend  Belinda  the Daughter of your late Colonel who left her to the Care of the Brigadier And the other is Brigadier General  Conquest  's Daughter who with her Mother was sent for from  Lisbon  on his late Illness they say she is to be married to Mr  Bisket  the  Santista  who supplies the Army with Bread and Forage  Major  Buck  I protest she has fine brilliant piercing Eyes and therefore I'll forbid the Banes she gives me a pretty thrilling Pain about my Heart she sets my Soul on Fire and I must have her Serjeant prepare the Men for an Attack I am resolved to countermine  Bisket  blow up all his Outworks and take that fair Citadel Sword in Hand  Wild  Most heroickly express'd  Major  Buck  Now will I fix myself in a very languishing Posture fire both my Eyes at her and I'll lay my  Life on't one of them shall do Execution in some Corner of her Heart ha Faith she returns the Ogle I am sure she must be a Prize  Kisses her Hand  Oh these dear charming Eyes have captivated my very Soul  Heart  Prithee be more modest consider her Father is your General  Holding him  Bel  Impudent Creature to take no Notice of me  Aside Victoria  Did you ever see any Thing so saucy  Vict  Nor so agreeable upon my Word  Bel  Why Sure you can't like so profligate a Fellow  Vict  I am not desperately in Love with him but should not be mighty uneasy were he to deliver me from my frightful Coxcomb  Bel  Why It was but this Moment you were talking of Duty and Gratitude to Parents  Vict  It's probable the next Moment I shall talk of them again but Child I'm Flesh and Blood and a handsome young Fellow will give me some fluttering Airs and a Palpitation about my Heart in spite of my Duty and resigned Will  Bel  He's a satyrical ugly Fellow that writes Lampoons I was sorry to see you return his Ogle in a Week's Time he'll swear he has been intriguing with you  Vict  That certainly will secure my Reputation for you and I know what a Red Coat says of our Sex goes for Nothing  Bel  I'm vex'd to see her have so little Spleen  Aside  come  Victoria  your Mother expects us to drink Tea with her  Vict  One look more and I go  Bel  Faugh upon the Fellow  Exeunt Women  Wild  So very well you have drove 'em away I suppose they'll tell the Mother of your Rudeness she acquaints the Brigadier General he sends you out upon the next dangerous Attack and off goes a Cannon and a pretty Fellow within half a Minute of one another  Major  Buck  Why that very Accident will prove I died for Love of her  Heart  Ergo  your saucy Love was the Occasion of your Death  Major  Buck  But prithee  Wildish  doest thou believe when I shall have aquainted the General with the Death of my Father that my Estate will not be a more prevailing Argument than  Bisket  's Riches  Wild  No The old Woman hates a Soldier and the Brigadier General loves Money so much that I believe he cannot have the Heart to part with any to his Daughter they say all Things are agreed on and he is expected up from  Lisbon  on purpose to marry her  Heart  He is to give her no Money and the Lover has sent her Silk for Wedding Cloaths  Major  Buck  Heark'e I'll take her stark Naked and settle all I have upon her I'll immediately go to the General I have a Packet for him  Wild  'Tis your Duty to acquaint him with your Arrival and you must give in a list of your Recruits  Heart  I warrant you imagine all those tall handsome Fellows must be Part of your Company  Major  Buck  Most certainly  Wild  No no The Regiment is to draw Cuts for them therefore if you have any Fancy to a particular Man write Servant against him in the List  Major  Buck  Why I have one clever Fellow I should be much concerned should I lose him March forward  Straitup  Wild  A well built Fellow of  Ireland  I suppose  Wil  No SirI'm of  England  Heart  The Fellow has the Air and Mein of a Gentleman  Wil  Aside  I'm sorry he thinks so  Wild  What was the Reason of your coming into the Army Friend  Wil  Why Sir Besides having had a Bastard laid to me I had committed some Roguery in the Country was afraid of being hanged and so listed myself for a Soldier  Wild  Which Friend is only a Reprieve from Death and the next Attack may sign your dead Warrant  Heart  If this Fellow falls to my Lot I'll make a Corporal of him  Wild  Were he mine I'd give him Serjeant's Pay and his Duty should be Combing my Wigs and Pimping for me  Major  Buck  The Account he gives you of himself is fictitious and I am informed by his Comrades he has something of the Gentleman in him for he lifts up his Eyes when they steal a Pig cut the Throat of a  Portuguese  or build a Sconce  Heart  Heark'e Friend if you have any Notion of Conscience you had better have staid in  England  to have been lawfully hanged  Wild  See yonder's the General alighted from his Horse That  Portuguese  Nobleman's House is his Quarters  Major  Buck  Serjeant march the Men to yonder Gate Come my Friends will you introduce me  Wild  and  Heart  With all our Hearts  Exeunt  File off  Fall into the Rank you  Wil  Oh for a happy Hour to encounter the Enemy in that I may be rid of this weary Load of Clay which clings round my Immortal Soul  Fill off  Fall back youSilence thereHeark'e Women be dumb or you shall all be muster'd as Harlotswhipt out of the Camp without the Preferment of being made Nurses to the Hospital  st  Soldier  's  Wife  Why Serjeant you shall be Judge now this ragged face Hussey here has the Assurance to say that she is more my Husband's lawful Wife than I  d  Soldier  's  Wife  Your Husband that's confident indeed Have not I lain with him the whole March Carried his Knapsack from  Lisbon  And what is the main Sign of a Wife but doing all his Drudgery Nay and to prove I am so not one Day has past over his Head but he has beat me  Fileoff  A very convincing proof of conjugal Love Therefore Mrs  Sneaker  let me advise you to choose a  new Husband or hire yourself out to a Company of Grenadiers in order to wash their Linen  st  Trull  If you please Serjeant I'll take up with  Staitup  here  Wil  Be gone Insolence or I'll spurn thee from me  st  Trull  What Offer to strike a Woman you an't married too Sirrah  d  Trull  Ay Or refuse a Woman that asks him the Question  st  Trull  Or dare to live in Camp without a lawful Wife  Fileoff  Look'e Campaigners This Gentleman Soldier is but a young Beginner I will not have him baulk'd Therefore withdraw your saucy Conversation till he has been long enough in the Army to be as impudent as yourselves I say leaping over a Sword is a serious Ceremony and the Laws of your spiritual Court military tell you no Wife ought to be turn'd off till the end of a Campaign Nor no Man ought to be drawn into the Noose unwillingly lest the Point of that Sword which most religiously join'd him should be the Cause of most barbarously unjoining of him  st  Trull  Nay That's very true noble Serjeant a provoking Tongue and a froward Woman will run a Man into strange Desperations I can't help owning it was the Death of my seventh Husband  st  Sold  Ay and your eighth too  Moll  to my Knowledge  st  Trull  No Indeed  Roger  he was hanged for Sheep Stealing  Wil  What a hellish Crew are I most unfortunately thrown myself among  Aside  Fileoff  Come 'Tis

much Hatred to the Husband you have provided for her  Mrs  Con  Dissembling Hussey I'll make her consent I warrant you I think Mr  Bisket  is an extraordinary Match for her He's worth Twenty Thousand Pound is Santista to the whole Army and has a Prospect of getting Forty moreBut if the Peace comes and he loses this Post he's the richest Merchant in  Lisbon  and will maintain her like a PrincessRather than she should marry a Rake'lly Officer I'd wish her Dead I know too well the Plague of trudging after a Soldier 'Tis indeed a State of Laced Cloaths and Starving but there's little of

Notion you have of a Man of Sense  Vict  N  Madam I reckon a M  n of Sense is one who a read the World as well as Books and knows how to discern betwixt the good and evil of it and has so true a Notion of himself as never to launch out into conceited Praises of his own Perfections he has Honour enough to scorn to do an ill Thing and Courage to resent an Injury from an impertinent Coxcomb he knows how to put a true value upon Virtue he has Religion enough to keep his Marriage vow Sacred and Discretion enough to make a Woman his Friend as well as Wise  Mrs  Con  So so a fine Character

Madam  Mrs  Con  Thou can'st ask nothing in Reason my Dear Child but I will grant it you  Vict  I fear tho' my Resolution's Strong when I come to the fatal Ceremony I shall want Spirits to support me

inconstant Temper Indeed I was a little Jealous of you and therefore persuaded your Mother to hasten the Match For which my Dear I hope you'll thank me now  Vict  Aside  This is Friendship with a
