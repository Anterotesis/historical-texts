 THE  COPERNICUS  EXPLAIN'D Or a BRIEF ACCOUNT of the NATURE and USE OF AN  Universal Astronomical Instrument  FOR THE Calculation and Exhibition of  New  and  Full Moons  and of  Eclipses  both  Solar  and  Lunar  with the Places  Heliocentrical  and  Geocentrical  of all the  Planets Primary  and  Secondary  c  By  WILLIAM WHISTON  MA Sometime Professor of the  Mathematicks  in the University of  Cambridge    LONDON  Printed for the Author in  CrossStreet HattonGarden    To the Right Honourable General STANHOPE One of His MAJESTY's  Principal Secretaries of State  A great  PATRON  and  Encourager  of  Learning  and of  Undertakings  for the  Publick Good  Particularly those of the Author for the Improvement of  Astronomy  and  Geography  THIS SMALL MANUAL IS With all due Submission and Gratitude Dedicated by  The Author    THE  COPERNICUS  EXPLAIN'D  _THIS Astronomical Instrument which is made agreeably to the  Copernican  System and therefore by me named the  COPERNICUS  consists besides the immoveable Circle on the  utside and the small moveable central Circle within of ten intermediate concentrical  Annuli  or broad circular Rings fitted to revolve one within another but so as to be capable of being fix'd  by small Pins in any situation whatsoever Six of the Circles toward the Center are so contriv'd that they may be taken away upon occasion and yet when they are put in they are fast connected to the Frame as well as the other and revolve as freely as they do There is also a Terrestrial Globe of nine Inches Diameter plac'd under the inner Circles with its Hour Circle turning along with it in its Diurnal Motion And when those Circles are remov'd the Globe may be so elevated and fix'd at any height and so regulated by Screws as to be ready for the Exhibition of those Eclipses which the six outward Circles assist us to discover to which last does also belong a Rule with a Groove containing an Angle of ° ′ for the Moon's Path in Eclipses There is also a round Plate of Glass with Concentrical Circles therein for the Digits in Solar Eclipses whose Diameter bears the same proportion to the Diameter of the Globe that the apparent Semidiameters of the Sun and Moon put together do really bear to the Disk of the Earth in those Eclipses There is besides a Map of the Moon with Concentrical Circles for the Digits in Lunar Eclipses  whose Diameter bears the same proportion to that of the Globe which the real Diameter of the Moon bears to the real Diameter of the Earth There is also a dark Circle representing that Section of the Earth's Conical Shadow along which the Moon passes in its own Eclipses and is so much less in proportion than the Diameter of the Globe as is that of the real corresponding Circle to that of the Earth it self There are also two Threads with their Plummets fix'd to the Center of the Instrument of frequent use in its Operations  THE Nature of the several Parts of this Instrument is as follows  THE outmost or largest Circle which is immovable is the  Ecliptick  with its known Signs  Aries Taurus Gemini c  This Circle is divided equally from the beginning of  Aries  or the  Vernal Equinox  into Degrees or Signs of Degrees apiece and is the Measure and Standard of the whole Instrument Every Planet or Point or Line being still fix'd by knowing its Place along this Circle either by the Signs with the particular Degrees and Minutes  or by the bare number of Degrees and Minutes from the  Equinox    THE Second Circle is for the Months and Days of the Year which Days being in a manner equal this Circle is equally divided into Parts which is the number of Days in a  Julian  common Year Nor will the  Leap Year  cause any great trouble though it has one more Day in  February  since it is already allow'd for in those Astronomical Tables whence all our Numbers have been transferr'd into this Instrument and any Day therein after  February  is counted one farther than in the common Year But here several things are to be noted  viz  That I suppose every Body can readily tell in any Month of any Year how remote every Day of it is from the beginning of that Year and this both in common and in Leap Years and so can readily change one way of Computation for the other as occasion shall require Thus we know by the old Memorial Verses that  Thirty Days hath September  April June and November  February eight and twenty alone  And all the rest have thirty and one  Accordingly we can tell that  April    d  the Day of the next total Eclipse of the Sun in this common Year is the  th  day of the Year As also that  Sept    th  or  Michaelmas  day next Year which is  Leap Year  will be the  d  Day of that Year and so in all other Cases whatsoever That in case we fix any one Day of the Circle rightly to that Place in the  Ecliptick  whereto it belongs every other Day of the same Circle will thereby be rightly plac'd also That I have therefore set down upon this Circle the true Place of the  Vernal Equinox  for the past Ages as well as for the present So that 'tis but bringing either the particular Year of our Lord it self  since  or any one which proceeded it  before Christ  to the beginning of  Aries  or the  Vernal Equinox  and the whole Circle of Months is rightly plac'd with respect to the  Ecliptick  for that time That yet if we desire to be exact we must in this case consider further what Year it is from  Leap Year  that we are concern'd with  for if it be the first after it which the first of each Century and Score  since  and the fourth of each Century and Score  before Christ  always are the Position of the Numbers is right of it self without any more consideration But if it be the second after it the Circle is to be turn'd one third of a Century's Motion or one quarter of a Day forward if it be the third two thirds of a Century's Motion or one half of a Day forwards in order to its right Position while if it be it self Leap Year the Circle must be turned one quarter of a Day backward in order to such a Position Our Astronomical Centuries Years Months and Days do ever commence from the Noon foregoing so our  th  of  March  in this Instrument begins at Noon  March    th  and ends at Noon  March  O  th  and is indeed reckon'd by Hours intire from the one Noon to the other Thus because this is the third after  Leap Year  I turn this second Circle onward half a day and find that the  Vernal Equinox  happens this Year  March    d    h    m  or as we commonly reckon on  March  about Six of the Clock in the Morning and that by consequence  April    d    h    m  the time of the middle of the next great Eclipse of the Sun corresponds  ponds to the ° of  Taurus  in the outmost Circle of the  Ecliptick    THE Third Circle is the Annual Elliptick Orbit of the Earth here rightly represented by a Circle with the unequal Divisions of the  Ellipsis  corresponding to the inequality of the Earth's Motion This Circle is fix'd to the due place of the Ecliptick by a small Arch of the place of the  Perihelion  as the Days of the Month were fix'd to the  Equinox    THE Fourth Circle contains the Menstrual Orbit of the Moon with its Periodical Revolution about the Earth both in Parts and in Days Hours and Minutes The actual Divisions are here made for the mean State of the Orbit which is variable but Points are set at every five Degrees to be thence supply'd at every Degree and proportionably in other Cases according to its several Degrees of Eccentricity Upon the inner large part of this Circle there is also a Spiral Line with the progressive mean Motion of the Moon's  Apogee  for a Century with every one of the Months and almost Days Motion also That so  when we have fix'd by a proper Table the mean Place of the  Apogee  for the beginning of any Century we may thereby find its mean Place to any time in the same Century also without any other Assistance whatsoever  THE Fifth Circle contains along its spiral the mean Motion of the Moon's Nodes and particularly of the Ascending Node whence the Numbers begin for an intire Century with its Months and Days that so when we have by a proper Table once fix'd that Node right for the beginning of any Century we may as before be hereby enabled to place it right at any time in the same Century without any other assistance Only we must here note that the Motion of the Nodes being retrograde the Numbers on this Circle are counted backward  THE Sixth Circle contains in a spiral the mean Motion of the Moon for the several Days in the Year number'd at length And the Moon's mean Motion for the distinct Years of the Century are put at the utmost edge of the Circle for our future Benefit in this Case also  THUS far I have describ'd the largest and principal Circles intended for the Discovery of the New and Full Moons and especially for the Calculation of Eclipses both Solar and Lunar  AS to those six lesser Circles that follow to the Center they need little Explication being all of a piece and are indeed nothing but broad  Annuli  or Rings to contain the Orbits of such of the Primary Planets as could be put upon them with the Orbits of all the Secondary Planets both those about  Saturn  and those about  Jupiter  in their due Proportions that so when the Sun is suppos'd in the Center the Orbits of the Primary Planets may alone be made use of when  Saturn  is there His and when  Jupiter  is there His  Satellites  may alone be contemplated Only we must here note several things for the better understanding of this Part of our Instrument Because  Saturn  and  Jupiter  's Orbits were too large for these inner Circles they are represented by small Spheres on the second and sixth larger Circles before describ'd because  Saturn  's Motion is only about Degrees in a Year or one in a Month as also  Jupiter  's  only about Degrees in a Year or ½ in a Month there is no great necessity for these distinct Orbits with their Motions to be engrav'd upon these Circles especially because of the Confusion it would introduce there These Orbits are here Circular or accommodated to the Planets mean Distances from the Sun but so that the present Places of the  Aphelia  and  Perihelia  are noted on the utmost edge of the whole Instrument and the quantity of their several constant Eccentricities are also noted where their Orbits begin that so the little Sphere representing each Planet may be ever plac'd nearer to or farther from the Center as its real Distance shall require only the Eccentricities of the  Earth  's and  Venus  's Orbits are too small to be here sensible These Orbits are all represented in the Plain of the Ecliptick as it was here necessary to do But then the present Places of the Ascending and Descending Nodes being set down at the utmost Edge each Planet's Inclination to the Ecliptick and Latitude on the Earth may be nearly discover'd for this Age at the same time I mean this in case we observe the quantity of the several Angles of Inclination which those Orbits  make with the Ecliptick which are as follows     °  ′  Saturn      Jupiter      Mars      Venus      Mercury      The seeming Motions of these  Aphelia  and Nodes in the Ecliptick is only a Degree in Years 'Tis therefore but allowing to these  Aphelia  and Nodes that Motion of one Degree in Years forwards and their Places in the Ecliptick are known for all Ages When  Saturn  's Secondary Planets are concern'd the Sun is to be suppos'd in its proper Place of the Ecliptick at the distance of Feet from the Center of the Instrument In which Case these Orbits are in true Proportions with regard thereto And when  Jupiter  's are concern'd it is to be suppos'd in the like place at  Feet distance for the same purposes At which Points if a Lamp be plac'd and this Instrument be mov'd in a kind of Circular Orbit about it we shall have a just and natural Representation of the Revolution  of these Primary Planets with their Satellites about the Sun both in their Annual and Menstrual Motions  I COME now to shew the particular Uses of this Instrument And shall do it in the Solution of the following PROBLEMS  PROB I  LEMMA  To Rectifie the first moveable Circle or that of the Months and Days to any Moment of Time past present or to come  TURN this Circle till the given Year exactly corresponds to the  beginning of Aries  in the outmost Circle but so that for the second Year after  Leap Year  you turn it farther one third for the third Year two thirds of a Century's Motion  forwards  and for the  Leap Year  one third  backwards  beyond that beginning of  Aries    Thus if you would Rectifie this Circle to the time of the great Solar Eclipse this Year which is the third after Bissextile you would put a Point that is a little beyond    two thirds of a Century's Motion backwarder than the beginning of  Aries  by which means this Circle will be entirely Rectify'd to the time    PROB II  LEMMA  To Rectifie the second moveable Circle or that of the  Earth's Annual Orbit  with its true  Anomaly  on it to any time past present or to come  THIS is readily done by bringing its beginning to the time assign'd in the Arch and is so easie and obvious as to need no farther Explication Only it must be noted that this Place of the  Perihelion  with regard to the Earth is the Place of the  Aphelion    with regard to the Sun or the Place where when the Sun is the Earth is most remote from it whence every  Anomaly  is to be begun  Thus if you add to  s d m  the Place of the  Perihelion  at the Commencement of this Century or    those  m  which is its Motion in    Years you will have  s d m  for the Place of the  Perihelion  at that time To which if you bring the beginning of this Circle you will have this whole Circle with the Earth's true  Anomaly  or Place thereon exactly rectify'd to the time of that Eclipse    PROB III  LEMMA  To Rectifie the third moveable Circle which is that of the Moon's  Apogee  with its true  Anomaly  or Place upon it to any time past present or to come  LOOK in the proper Table for the place of the Moon's  Apogee  at the beginning of the Century assign'd and accordingly fix it Count along the Spiral that is upon it the Years Months and part of a Month of that Century and lay one of your Threads over that Place then remove the  Apogee  to that Thread this will exactly shew its mean Place After this observe how far the Sun is from the  Apogee  or  Perigee  and whether it have lately gone past or is going towards one of 'em and turn the Circle accordingly forward or backward one  third of that Distance For in the former Case that quantity is to be substracted from in the other added to the former Place in order to have the true Place I mean this only as we reckon  d  for the Limit And remember that the fame Equation is to be substracted or added for any Number that is equally distant from that Limit as for and and and and and so in all other Cases whatsoever Only observe that if nearest the Limit you take considerably less and remotest from it a very little more than one third you will still more exactly Rectifie this Circle  Thus if you look for  AD  you will find the mean Place of the  Apogee  then to be    s  ° ′  and if you turn the Circle forward to  Apr  you will have the mean Place of the  Apogee  then And if by turning still forwards you add the third part of the Sun's Distance or  °  to the former Place you will have the true Place of the  Apogee  at that time  viz s d m  PROB IV  LEMMA  To Rectifie the fourth moveable Circle which is that of the Moon's  Nodes  for any time past present or to come  LOOK in the proper Table for the Place of the  Ascending Node  at the beginning of the assign'd Century and there fix it Count along the Spiral thereon backwards the Years Months and part of a Month of that Century and lay your Thread over that Place Then bring the beginning of the Spiral or Ascending Node to the Thread which will give you the mean Place of that Node Then turn the Circle forward a th part of the Sun's distance from either Node if it have lately pass'd it or a th part backward if it have not yet pass'd it This will fix the Nodes to their true  Places at that time I mean this also as we reckon here ° the Limit and remember that the Equation is to be substracted or added for any Number that is equally distant from that Limit Only Observe that if nearest that Limit you take considerably less and remotest from it somewhat more than you will still more exactly Rectifie this Circle  Thus If you look for  AD  you will find the mean Place of the Ascending Node to be    s  ° ′  Then turn the Circle backward to  Apr d  and you will have the mean Place of that Node there And if by turning still backward you substract a    th part of the Sun's distance or      you will have the true Place of the Node at that time  viz s d m  PROB V  LEMMA  To Rectifie the fifth moveable Circle which is that of the mean Motion of the  Moon  it self for every Day of a  Julian  Year for any time past present or to come  LOOK in the proper Table for the  Mean Place of the Moon  at the beginning of the Century assign'd and there fix the Circle Then look along the outward Edge of this Circle for the compleat number of Years of that Century and laying your Thread exactly over that Year remove the Circle so far Then count along the Spiral upon it the number of Days and Parts till the time assign'd over which laying your Thread remove the Circle so far This rectifies the Circle of the Moon's Mean Motion for that time  Thus if you look for  AD  you will find the Mean Place of the Moon to be  s d m  whither bring the beginning of the Circle accordingly Lay then a Thread over the Number    and bring the former Place thereto Then is this Circle intirely rectify'd at that time  Note That the Moon's Motion in Hours is not distinguish'd here on the Spiral because it may be better estimated on the Ecliptick it self  Note farther That when you go upwards as in the Years before the Christian  Aera  contrary to what is usual you add the Mean Motions of the Node and substract those of the Apogee and Moon it self to and from the Epocha to prepare the Numbers for the Instrument But then if you thereupon chuse proper Numbers for the beginning of each Century before as well as after the beginning of the Christian  Aera  you will have no farther Difficulties in the use of the Instrument it self Thus if for the beginning of the    st Year before  Christ  you take    Years backwards for the Epocha of the Century and    compleat Years after it for the beginning of the Year it self you will have no farther difficulty in the use of this Instrument in that case  Note also That the three last of these Circles will as well serve for a Century backwards as forwards from any Root or Epocha I mean if the known number  of Degrees for any number of Years backwards in the Century be taken on the side of the Epocha contrary to that it belong'd to if the Years had been forwards as every one will easily find upon the least Consideration and Trial  Note farther That to make this Instrument as ready as possible for the present Century the Epochae of the Places of the Moon's Apogee and Ascending Node and of the Moon it self at the beginning of it are noted by the following Marks upon the outmost Circle  ☉ ☊ ☽  with Points at the opposite Places at the same time And the like Marks may be made for any other Century as occassion shall require  Note lastly That our Time is here always the Mean or Equal Time which the more curious may correct by the known EquationTable But since this last is little more than a quarter of an Hour different from the other at the utmost and almost always much less it is rather too nice to deserve much Consideration in such an Instrument  PROB VI  To find the  Sun  's True Place in the Ecliptick for any time past present or to come  REctifie the two outmost moveable Circles Look what Sign Degree and part of a Degree corresponds to the Time assign'd Lay your two Threads over the first of  Aries  and over that Place and count the  same Number  along the Earth's Orbit which you find belongs to that Number on the Ecliptick This corresponds to the True Place of the Sun in the Ecliptick for that time  Thus if you look for  h m  upon the Ecliptick on  Apr  d you will find over against it about  d m  This reckon'd along the Earth's Orbit reaches from  d m  which is over against the Equinox to  d m  over against which last Number stands  d m  of  Taurus  which is therefore the Sun's True Place in the Ecliptick at that time    PROB VII  To find the  Moon  's True Place in the Ecliptick for any time past present or to come  REctifie the third and fifth moveable Circles Lay one of your Threads over the Moon's Mean Place and the other over the Moon's Apogee Count along the Moon's Orbit the  same Number  which is intercepted between the Threads on the Ecliptick A Thread laid over that Place corresponds with the Moon's True Place in the Ecliptick  Thus if you look for  d h m  on the fifth moveable Circle you will find it is distant from the Moon's Apogee along the Ecliptick about  d m  which Number taken in the Moon's own Orbit on the third moveable Circle corresponds to  d m  of  Taurus  the True Place of the Moon at that time But it is here to be noted that when the Moon's Apogee is either in Conjunction or Opposition with the Sun the Eccentricity of the Moon's Orbit is  the greatest and the Points or Marks nearest the Apogee are the true ones which is nearly the Case in this Example and accordingly made use of in it and when it is in the Octants that Excentricity is in a Mean and the Lines and Numbers themselves are right but when it is in the Quadratures the Points or Marks nearest the Perigee are the true Places And so in all other intermediate Positions whatsoever Which Circumstances being consider'd and proportionably allow'd for in all Cases this Problem will be exactly solv'd  PROB VIII  To find the True  Conjunctions  and  Oppositions  of the Sun and Moon with the  New  and  Full Moons  for any time past present or to come  REctifie the first second third and fifth moveable Circles as before directed After that find the True Places of the Sun and Moon for the time given as before If they are either the same or directly opposite you have the time already if not carry your  Threads that lie over the two Places respectively along their own Orbits forwards or backwards so that you carry the Moon's Degrees and a quarter to the Sun's one or a Day's Motion of one to a Days Motion of the other and so all along proportionally  ie  somewhat above half a Degree to an Hour till the Moon's Place overtakes the Sun's For that Place where they are coincident gives you the Conjunction or Opposition with the New or Full Moon  Thus If you look for the Sun's Place at Noon  Apr  which is Astronomically    compleat Days in that Month you will find it about  d m  in  Taurus  And if in like manner you look for the True Place of the Moon at the same time you will find it about  d m  in  Aries  Whence if you carry both the Threads so far as corresponds to  h m  you will perceive that the Moon does there overtake the Sun which shews that at that very time or  Apr d  about a quarter before Ten in the Morning the Sun and Moon will be in Conjunction and it will be New Moon But Observe that if you do not at all know beforehand at what time of any Month the Conjunction or Opposition will fall you must find the distinct Places of the Sun and Moon at the beginning of the Month and so go  downwards as to the Days as well as Hours and parts of an Hour till they are coincident as has been just now directed and you will thereby find the Day Hour and part of an Hour of the next Conjunction or Opposition You may also if you please find the True Places of the Sun and Moon to that last time over again as before directed especially where there is a design to examin an Eclipse at the same time for the greater Accuracy But Note that if you only intend to find the time of Conjunction or Opposition in order to an Eclipse you need not examin any Month or Days but only such as are near one of the Nodes or within the Limits of such Eclipses which Limits will be stated under the next Problem  PROB IX  To find whether there will be either a  Solar  or a  Lunar Eclipse  at any  Conjunction  or  Opposition  for any time past present or to come  ALL the Circles first rectify'd and the Time and Place of the True Conjunction or Opposition found as already directed Lay one of your Threads over that Place and the other over the nearest Node If that Distance be less than Degrees and an half and it be a Conjunction there will be an Eclipse of the Sun somewhere If it be greater there will be no Eclipse If that Distance be less than  d    m  and it be an Opposition there will be an Eclipse of the Moon If it be more there will be no Eclipse  Thus it happening this Year    that the Sun and Moon are in Conjunction about a quarter before Ten o' Clock on the next  d  of  April  and that at  d  distance from the Descending Node it is evident there will at that time happen an Eclipse of the Sun And there happening an Opposition  October st  about a quarter past    in the Morning within    Degrees and an half of the same Node 'tis evident there will then be an Eclipse of the Moon also  Note here that several other Circumstances of Eclipses may be discover'd by the Solution of this Problem Thus because the Conjunction for the next Solar Eclipse happens  before  the Moon has reach'd its Descending Node 'tis plain it must belong to the Northern Parts more than to the Southern Because it is in a sort of a Mean Distance between that descending Node and the Limit it will be a great and Total Eclipse and the greatest in the Northern Temperate Zone Because it happens near the  Aphelion  of the Earth and near the  Perigee  of the Moon when the apparent Diameters of the Sun is smaller and of the Moon greater than usual it will not be Annular but Total and that for some few Minutes also I mean along that Line which the Center of the  Penumbra  describes upon the Earth And because the Solar Eclipse this Year happens here in the Daytime and the Lunar in the Night they will both be visible I mean in  case the Cloud cause no interruption So that these Circumstances do not need Particular Problems for their Solution  PROB X  To Rectifie the Globe and its Hour Circle for the  Exhibition  of Eclipses  BRing  London  to the graduated side of the Meridian and turn the Hour Circle till o' Clock is pointed to by its Index Then turn the Globe with its Hour Circle so far forward or backward as the right Ascension belonging to the Distance of the Place of the Conjunction from the beginning of  Cancer  or  Capricorn  does require reckoning still Degrees to an Hour and Degree to Minutes Hold the Globe in that Position and bring in the Hour Circle to the graduated edge of the Meridian again and there fix it fast to move with the Globe all along afterward By this means the Index will tell you the true time as it is counted  at the Meridian of  London  during the whole time of the Eclipse And Note that the Distance from  Cancer  or  Capricorn  it self if increas'd or diminished one  th  part or one Degree in according as the Position of the Sun and Moon shall require will nearly give the Right Ascension reckoning the Limit as under the  d  and  th  Problems and increasing or diminishing the Equation as there also But Note that this Distance it self will never err  d    m  or Minutes in time from the Truth nay will usually be much nearer the same even without any Allowance for that Correction at all  Thus if you bring  London  to the graduated edge of the Meridian and the Hour of    to the Index and remove the Globe with its Hour Circle backward from East to West    Degrees  ie  Hours    Minutes and then turn the Hour of    to the Index again and there fix it you will have the Globe with its Hour Circle rectify'd for the time of the next Total Eclipse of the Sun and every part of it will agree to that Hour which the Index shews on the Hour Circle    PROB XI  In any  Solar  Eclipse consider'd in general and with regard to the whole enlightened Disk of the Earth to find when and where it will begin and end whether it will be any where total or every where only partial and if partial how many Digits will any where be Eclipsed with the other general Circumstances of the same  TAKE the eleventh part of the Distance of the Place of the Conjunction from the nearest Node for the Latitude of the Moon at the middle of the Eclipse Remove the inner Circles and elevate the Globe that stands beneath them North or South as the Case shall require By the side Screws  place it in the Center or Axis of your Circles Lay your Rule with its Glass of Circles then set over its middle Point and its Lamp or Candle so that the Node may lie in a Position suitable to that of the Moon's Orbit at that time which is easily known from the Observations under the last Problem and so that the middle Point or that under the Center of the Glass may be directed to the Place of the Conjunction in the Ecliptick Turn your Globe rectify'd as before till the Index points to the time of the True Conjunction already found That is very nearly the time of the middle of the general Eclipse Then turn your Globe and draw your Glass backwards any number of Minutes equally so that an Hour in the Hour Circle may ever correspond to an Hour in the Path of the Moon and till the Shadow of the edge of the Circular Glass begins to touch the nearest Place of the Globe for that is the Time and that the Place when and where the general Eclipse begins Carry both Motions forward and observe whether the Central bright Spot does any where touch the Globe if it does not the Eclipse is no where Total and the Circles cast on the Globe will shew  the number of Digits eclips'd If it does touch note the Time and Place when and where it does so for that is the Time and that the Place of the entry of the Central Shadow or total Darkness upon the Earth Do the like as to the Central Spot or other edge of the Circles going off the Globe afterwards this will in like manner shew the Time and Place of the end of Total Darkness and of the whole Eclipse respectively And by this means all the other Circumstances of the general Eclipse of the Sun may be most easily and readily discover'd and exhibited to the Eye with the greatest Pleasure and Satisfaction  Thus in the next great Solar Eclipse consider'd in general you will find that it will begin in  d  of North Latitude and about  d  westward from  London  and this about  m  after    and will end in the Latitude of    about  d  to the East of  London  and this at  m  after    That it will be a Total Eclipse for about    Miles in breadth and that the Center of the  Penumbra  will go near the  Lizard  Point  Bristol Stamford  and  Boston  and so by  Stockholm  and  Archangel  into  Russia Siberia  and  East Tartary  Note that if instead of a Lamp or Candle you make use of the Sun it self either by placing the Instrument so that the Rays  may themselves fall parallel to the Axis of the Glass or that they may be inclin'd to it by a reflecting  Speculum  or Lookingglass it will be better    Note also that if with a Pencil put thro' the Axis of the Glass you draw a Line or with a sharp Pin or Needle therein make Points upon the Globe as you move it and the Glass together you will have the Pathway ef the Center transferr'd upon the Globe and may thereby exactly find all the Places where the Eclipse will be Total or Annular or Central and may easily see from the like Lines drawn or Marks made at any number of Digits distance how broad the Path of any kind of partial Eclipse will be also over the whole Earth which how entertaining and useful a Sight it may be to all the Curious I leave to their own Trial and Determination  Note also That the Problem thus solv'd includes one main part of that famous Discovery of Sir  Christopher Wren  's Dr  Halley  's and Mr  Flamsteed  's publish'd by the last and nam'd  The Construction of Solar Eclipses  without the tedious Method of Calculation Only what they are forc'd to do with no small pains and in no short timegeometrically is here done with great ease and quickness and an exact imitation of the Originals in Nature and so with a great deal more Pleasure and Satisfaction    PROB XII  In a  Solar Eclipse  consider'd in particular and with regard to any single Place to find when it did or will begin and end whether it was or will be there Total or Partial and if Partial how many Digits were or will be Eclipsed With the other particular Circumstances of the same in that Place  THIS Problem is in effect already solv'd under the former Problem It being as easie to observe when the Shadow of the edge of the GlassCircle first touches or last leaves any Place upon the Globe which is the beginning and ending of the Eclipse there when the bright erect Line crosses it which is its middle there How  near any Circle of Digits comes to it then Which is the number of Digits Eclipsed there With other the like Circumstances of that Place as it was before to observe the same for the Eclipse in general Nor is there any occasion for farther Directions  Thus the next great Solar Eclipse will begin here at  London April  about  h m  in the Morning its middle will be about  h m  its end about  h m  and it will be intirely or very nearly Total tho' if it be Total here it cannot be so for much more than a single Minute of Time as Dr  Halley  's particular Map fitted for this Eclipse will easily show  Note that if in the Solution of this and the foregoing Problem you add for East and substract for West Longitude resolved into Time you will have the Moment of each of these Appearances at any other Place also  Note also that the Problem thus solv'd includes the remaining part of the foremention'd famous Discovery of the  Construction of Solar Eclipses  and that not only as done with the like greater ease quickness and pleasure but principally that with the same operation and without any new trouble it discovers every thing for  all particular Places  at once which neither that Method of  Construction nor any other Method of  Astronomy  whatsoever could pretend to before And yet all this is here done only by such a close imitation of Nature as is in it self most easie and obvious and what one would now imagin should have come into the Thoughts of  Astronomers  first of all before any other Contrivance whatsoever  PROB XIII  In a  Lunar  Eclipse to find whether it was or will be Total or Partial and if Partial how many Digits were or will be Eclipsed which of the Lunar Spots and Mountains were or will be obscured and when they did or will begin or end to be so How long the Entire or Central or Partial Eclipse will last With all the other Circumstances of the same  TAKE away the Globe and set the Dark Circle in its Place Take also the Glass of Circles away and put the Map of the Moon with its Circles in its Place Then do in all things with this Map of the Moon as you were order'd to do with the GlassCircle  Circle before By this means you will have all those  Phaenomena  of Lunar Eclipses solv'd with greater ease and the like pleasure which were before represented in the Solar Nor is there any new difficulty in the Application Only Note that this Map of the Moon being too small to have the Names of its several Seas and Lands engraven on it it will be convenient to have withal a larger Map of the Moon with those Names as an Explication of the other which accordingly is here provided and plac'd on one side of the dark Circle which is us'd with it And Note farther that those who have a mind to be here very particular and exact may use the larger Map of the Moon instead of the other in case they join with it a dark Circle of Inches and a quarter in Diameter For the same Proportion which the Diameter of our smaller Moon of two Inches and an half bears to that of our dark Circle of six Inches and two fifths does the Diameter of that Circle or of the larger Moon bear to that of a Circle of sixteen Inches and two fifths Diameter Whence its plain the larger Moon and that largest Circle will more exactly exhibit  such Lunar Eclipses than the other Tho' I believe there will be but few who will not be satisfy'd with the smaller dark Circle so I have not provided the larger Which yet Mr  Senex  or Mr  Hudson  the exact Engraver and Framer of this Instrument will readily procure for any that desire them But then the several Circles concern'd must be ever so adjusted that the perpendicular of their Centers may still be the same with the Latitude of the Moon at the middle of the Eclipse and that as measur'd by a Scale which is so much larger than ours as their Diameters are larger  Thus we shall find by this Instrument that there will be an Eclipse of the Moon this Year  Octob  that it will not be a Total but a Partial Eclipse that the Digits eclips'd will be    and this on the North side of the Moon's Body That the Eclipse will begin about  h m  and end about  h m  in the Morning and that Mount  Aetna  will enter the Shadow about  h m  and emerge about  h m  Note those that would exactly imitate Nature in these Lunar Eclipses must let the Globe stand and have a Lamp or Circle of Light larger in Diameter than the Globe through whose Shadow the Map of the Moon must pass They ought also to have different Maps of the Moon out of  Hevelius  to fit the different Librations of the Moon or the small variety there is in that Face which is expos'd to us in different Eclipses But since this Method would be much more troublesome and but little more advantageous or entertaining I chose the former easie way of exhibiting these Lunar Eclipses by this Instrument leaving the other to those among the Curious who shall think fit to bestow any extraordinary cost and trouble about it  But Note That the Diameters of the  Penumbra  and of the Moon are here still fitted to their Mean Quantity when the Earth and Moon are about the shorter Axis of their Ellipses So that when they are near their Aphelion and Apogee their Perihelion and Perigee or the Earth its Aphelion and the Moon its Perigee the Earth its Perihelion and the Moon its Apogee some small Differences will arise in the Business of Eclipses which yet may easily be allow'd for on a little consideration Thus the next visible Eclipse of the Sun happening somewhat near the Earth's Aphelion and nearer the Moon's Perigee as the Position of their Orbits at that time in this Instrument will shew the Moon will appear a little larger and the Sun  a little smaller than ordinary whereby the Sun will be about    Minutes and    quarters under a total Eclipse all along the Central Path of the Moon's Shadow and the    Digits on your Glass will not include the whole In this Case you are to suppose all the Circles    thirds of a Digit inlarg'd and the Central Digit so much broader Thus the next invisible Eclipse of the Sun  Octob  happening somewhat near the Earth's Perihelion and nearer the Moon's Apogee the Moon will appear somewhat less and the Sun somewhat greater than ordinary so that this Eclipse will be only Annular and not Total and the Digits Eclipsed will not be quite    In this case you are to suppose all the Circles diminish'd    thirds of a Digit and the Central Digit so much narrower and the like Allowances are to be made in the Numbers upon the Path of and perpendicular to the Moon's Shadow in the Diameter of the Moon's Map in the Duration of Eclipses  c  which must be left to every curious Person's own estimation only with this intimation that these Differences from the Standards here given are ever so small and commonly so insensible that they may be well look'd on as almost perfectly inconsiderable in the use of this or the like Instruments  Yet the Latitude of the Moon will sometimes well deserve an allowance and may be corrected by taking not much above a    th part of the distance from the Node near the Moon's Perigee and almost a    th near its Apogee instead of that    th part which is the usual standard  whence at this next Eclipse the real Latitude of  m s  will be here represented by  m s  on our Scale and so proportionally in all Cases whatsoever  SCHOLIUM  Since the Computation and Exhibition of all Eclipses past or future is by this Instrument become now so very easie it will be fit to examin thereby all the old Eclipses men ioned by Historians and to compare them with Original Accounts for the settling all Ancient Chronology and History which Design was the very Occasion of the Contrivance of the same In particular it will be fit to examin hereby the very old pretended Eclipses mention'd in the  Chinese  Records and to see how far they will agree with the Real Eclipses of those remote Ages Which may be also one valuable use as to Lunar Eclipses at least of the acute Dr  Halley's  Tables for the Periodical Returns of Eclipses which he has given us a Specimen of already and which we shortly expect the Completion of from him  PROB XIV  To find the  Heliocentrick  True Places of all the Primary Planets for any time past present or to come  BY the help of the proper Tables which are publish'd in my Astronomy find the true Place of each Planet as is there directed From thence you may set them accordingly by this Instrument  Thus for Example Let us compute the Heliocentrick Place of  Mercury  to the Time of the next great Solar Eclipse  See Astron Lect Edit Lat p Eng p     s  °  ′          Years          Apr        Days          h        m        Anom Med        Long Hel        Add Preces Aequinoct        True Place of  Merc        But because this Method is not wholly free from the trouble of Calculation you may frequently help your self by some good  Ephemeris  such as is annually set out by Mr  Parker  whence you may readily transfer the Heliocentrick Places of the Planets into your Instrument Accordingly by either Method at the Time of the next Solar Eclipse the six Primary Planets Heliocentrick Places will appear to be these     s  °  ′  Saturn        Jupiter        Mars        Earth        Venus        Mercury        PROB XV  To find the  Geocentrick  Places of any of the Primary Planets for any time past present or to come  HAving found as before the  Heliocentrick  Places of the other Planets and particularly that of the  Earth  noted all by several small Spheres and having allow'd for their proper Eccentricities in the sticking of those Spheres Lay one of your Threads from the  Earth  to the Planet and the other Thread laid parallel thereto from the Center gives you the  Geocentrick  Place of that Planet for the time assigned  Thus at the forementioned Time the five Primary Planets  Geocentrick  Places will be nearly these     s  °  ′  Saturn        Jupiter        Mars        Venus        Mercury        PROB XVI  To find the  Mutual Aspects  of all the Primary Planets with one another and with the  Sun  and  Moon  their  Conjunctions Oppositions Trines Quartiles  and  Sextiles  both  Heliocentrick  and  Geocentrick  for any time past present or to come  THIS is easily done when the Places themselves of the Primary Planets with that of the Moon are once found by the former Solution Nor is there then any difficulty in noting the several Angles of distance ° ° and ° which make the  Trine Quartile  and  Sextile Aspect  But this Problem looks too like the Fooleries of  Astrology  to deserve any nicer Explication  PROB XVII  To find whether any Primary Planet with its Satellits be Direct Stationary or Retrograde at any time past present or to come  HAving found the  Heliocentrick  and  Geocentrick  Places of the Planets and set small Spheres to represent 'em From the Sphere representing any Planet lay two Rules or Threads so as to touch the Earth's Orbit on both sides If the Earth be considerably  without  that mixtilinear Triangle the Planet is Direct if considerably  within  it it is Retrograde if  about the Limit  it is Stationary or at least lately was or soon will be so Nor can you by this means absolutely determin near those Limits whether the Planet be Direct Stationary or Retrograde But then by finding its Geocentrick Place two several times within a few Days of one another and observing whether the Planet  at the latter time be farther or in the same Place or not so far in the Ecliptick as it was at the former time you may entirely determin the Problem Nor is the Case of the Inferior Planets much different from that of the Superior ones as to this matter Only Note that the Rules or Threads must be laid from the Earth to touch their Orbits which is the  Station  or Limit of the  Direction  and  Retrogradation  of those Planets and is call'd their  utmost Elongation  and that the Inferior Planets Position near those Limits are here correspondent to the Earth's Position in the Superior Nor is this a Case of such difficulty as to require any nicer Consideration  Thus at the time of the foremention'd Eclipse we shall find by this Method that  Saturn  and  Mars  will be Retrograde and that  Jupiter Venus  and  Mercury  will be direct    PROB XVIII  To find the Places of the  CircumSaturnals  and  CircumJovials  from their Opposition to the Sun at any time since their Motions have been known past present or to come  FIND the Place of  Saturn  or  Jupiter  in the Ecliptick for the given time as before Then by the proper Tables of their Satellits Motions about them when they shall be made for we have only one Set of such Tables yet publish'd and render'd fit for our purpose I mean those of  Cassini  for  Jupiter  's innermost fix the beginning of their Orbits or the small Spheres stuck there to represent those Satellits Place also or imagin a Lamp or Candle at the distance of about Feet for  Saturn  and about the same number of Feet for  Jupiter  By this means you will have a true and noble Representation of these Systems of Secondary Planets at any time whatsoever  PROB XIX  To find the Eclipses of these Secondary Planets for any time since their Motions have been known past present or to come  THE time of Opposition is the time of the Middle of any Eclipse and by taking away and adding the half duration of that Eclipse you have the time of the Immersion and Emersion 'Tis plain therefore that finding the Opposition does in effect find the Immersions Emersions and intire Durations of those Eclipses also  Note that the time of half Duration in  Jupiter  's innermost which is the most remarkable Satellit in this matter is nearly  h m  and so the whole Duration about  h m  perpetually  Note farther that only one of these Appearances the Immersion or Emersion of a Satellit is generally visible at the same time  viz  the Immersion from the Conjunction of the Primary Planet with the Sun till its Opposition and the Emersion from its Opposition till its Conjunction  Note also that till we have more exact and suitable Tables of the rest of these Secondary Planets it will be proper two Nights successively to observe the Position of as many as we can of them and from those Observations to fix their Places with relation to their Primary ones to those times For since their Orbits on our Instrument gives their several Periods exactly enough from those Periods their future Places and Positions may be found by two such Observations for a great while and such Positions may be with pleasure enough compar'd with a great number of other Observations afterwards Nor do we wholly want an Astronomical Method as to the most useful of these Secondary Planets which is the innermost about  Jupiter  since the Tables necessary for placing the same right and for the Eclipses for some Years to come tho' too large for this small Manual are publish'd in my Astronomy with full Directions for their use also to which I must refer the curious Reader  Note farther that we are generally to look for only one of  Saturn  's Satellites there being few Glasses that can shew us any more and none but those of the famous  Cassini  that can discover the two innermost  Note here that  Jupiter  's Planets are all in or near the Plain of his Equator which is near the Plain of the Ecliptick it self and that they are hardly at all Eccentrical That  Saturn  's most visible Planet discover'd by  Hugenius  is the fourth in order or the outmost but one as also that its Planets are in or near the Plain of its Ring which is about    deg inclin'd to the Ecliptick and that they do not any of them appear to be very much Eccentrical neither  And note that our Terrestrial Globe may be so contriv'd that it may be also us'd with an Horizon as any other Terrestrial Globe may and by consequence those who buy its Celestial Fellow may at the same time have a  Pair of Globes  as well as a  Copernicus  which will at once save almost all the Charges of one Globe and afford a Foundation for the understanding of both the principal parts of  Astronomy  also I mean  the Doctrine of the Sphere  to which the Globes and  the Theory of the Planets  to which our  Copernicus  does immediately belong  Note lastly That all who purchase this  Copernicus  and desire to have it explain'd more distinctly to them according to the Directions in this Paper may apply themselves to the Author who will endeavour to make the several Parts and Uses of it easie and familiar to them  Mar  Will Whiston  ERRATA  PAGE Line  read  ° ′ p l  r  backwards l  r  forwards p l  r  about  APPENDIX  IN this  Appendix  I have set down
