KNIGHT  and  COMPANION  of the  MOST NOBLE ORDER  of the  GARTER  PARDON me Mighty Prince that in the Crowd of Your Joyful and Devoted  Britons  one of an obscure Fame presumes to lay his  Humble Offering  at Your Feet  IT is the  History  of the  MOST NOBLE ORDER of the GARTER  which from its first Institution has been constantly worn by Persons of the highest Birth and most illustrious Merit  IF the  Stile  and  Manner  in which it is treated were proportionable to the Dignity of the Subject there would need no Apology for this Dedication For to whom next to the  Great Sovereign  of the  Garter  whose true  Heir  You are in all manner of  Virtue  and  Honour  could this Treatise have recourse for Protection but to Your Royal Highness who are the Premier  Knight of this Most Noble Order  and the standing  Grace  and  Ornament  of it  BUT far above all particular  Views  are the unspeakable Blessings derived to these Kingdoms by the SUCCESSION of Your Illustrious Royal  House  Every  Briton  seems new Born and to have borrow'd fresh Influence from its Glorious Presence  THE Godlike Virtues of Your Royal Father are not to be excelled and should we venture to express an Equality it can only be the Appearance of Your Royal Highnes's imitating so Great a Pattern  AS He is Wise and Good beyond Praise so has He a Title to the Hearts of His People beyond Question which

 MOST NOBLE ORDER  and to support the Crown by a bountiful and flourishing Issue that there may never want one of Your Royal Line to sit on the Throne of  GreatBritain  Is the Ardent Prayer of  ILLUSTRIOUS SIR  Your Royal Highness's Most Faithful Most Obedient and Humbly Devoted Servant Thomas Walker  THE PREFACE  THose who are acquainted with Mr  Ashmole  's  History of the most Noble Order of the Garter  will easily satisfy themselves that no Pains or Industry was wanting to Perfect and Complete so Voluminous a Work He had the Encouragement of a very gracious Prince and the use of publick Records more particularly the several Books of the  Order  with the Assistance of several MSS wrote by the Officers of Arms who bore Part in the Ceremonies or went on Embassies to Stranger Kings Princes c and by their constant Observations were familiarly versed in all its Laws and Customs  These were very great helps to him and it must be confessed his own elaborate Study had not less owing to it There is nothing that has relation to this  most Noble Order  which he has not touched on and indeed  it is a Work so very copious that he does himself acknowledge he has inserted some things of little importance which he desires may be considered to be done to gratify some few who have a more immediate concern therein  The Reader will in this Treatise find little else omitted A very painful and exact Abridgment has been made many Corrections of the Author's which he saw before his Death and left among his other Books in his Library at  Oxford  are here carefully altered some Additions are made a List continued of the several  KnightsCompanions  as well as Officers of the  Order  for above forty Years and the Coats of Arms of abundance of the  KnightsCompanions  visibly corrected from good Authorities and every distinct Chapter treated of at large so that this Work has not been compleated but at great Labour as well as Expence which could not have been supported but for the Encouragement some of the  KnightsCompanions  of the  most Noble Order  were pleased to give it as well in their Subscriptions as in the good Opinion they seemed to Express of the Design  THE HISTORY OF THE Most Noble ORDER OF THE GARTER  _IT was undoubtedly a good Sentiment in the first Collector of this Learned Work to introduce as well as a Discourse of  Knighthood  in general a Treatise of all the several  Orders  that have prevail'd in other Parts of the World for these in their Rise and Institutions having a relative Sense to the particular Subject he was to illustrate seemed to afford him a very good Opportunity of doing it by building on so convenient a Foundation  I shall therefore tho' much more confin'd to brevity follow the same Method making it serve as a proper Introduction there being many Things in the voluminous Original which I conceive may with less Inconveniency be dispenc'd with  IT was a constant Maxim in all wellregulated Governments to give a just Encouragement to Merit and this by proportioning Rewards to the Service done for Merit must be suppos'd to consist in the Performance  of some Vertuous or Heroick Action directed for the publick Good And as Vertue is either Military or Civil so the Distribution of Rewards is different either by bestowing Degrees and Titles of Honour or by Donations of Wealth so that in either Construction Vertue may have its proper and suitable Reward  BUT the proper Reward of Military  Vertue  is Honour to which distinct Head this Work is confin'd Honour which  Aristotle  calls the  Greatest of exteriour Goods  And being an Object of a nobler Ambition than the Accumulation of Wealth is principally the Aim of that  Vertue  we understand by  Valour  which springs from more generous Spirits and hath been the constant Foundation of raising Men to the highest Eminence of Glory and superiour Dignity  BUT that Fame might not lose it self in an unbounded Notion it was at length thought fit to reduce Honour into Form and Order by investing the Person meriting with some particular Title or Appellation of Excellence the Original of all Nobility of which Knighthood as it hath been accounted the most suitable Reward to the greatest Vertue so it hath been esteemed the chief and primary Honour among many Nations  THE  Romans  held Honour and Vertue in that Esteem that they deify'd and dedicated Temples to them They made them so contiguous in their Situation that there was no other Passage to that of Honour but thro' the Temple of Vertue mystically admonishing that Honour was not to be attained by any other Way  IN several of the  Roman  Coins we see Honour and Vertue represented together in one Reverse and in one Medal the Face of Honour so shadows that of Vertue that but a little of it appears  Honour being the more illustrious of the two and where we behold any Person outwardly adorned with it we are to judge him inwardly endued with Vertue inasmuch as Honour is his due and justly bestowed upon him  § IN tracing the Original of Knighthood we are not so vain to say with the  French  that S  Michael  was the  premier Chevalier  yet thus much we may assert that  tis near as ancient as Valour and Heroic Vertue notwithstanding the Ceremonies and Circumstances of  have varied according to several Ages and Nations And therefore with much Probability we may derive the  Original of Military Honour from the  Trojans  and  Greeks  among whom as Knights of great Renown were  Hector Troilus Aene  s Antenor Agamemnon Menelaus Pel  us Tydeus  c And thus  Homer  uses the Word  in the same Sense as  Eques  was afterwards among the  Latins  'Mong whom thus  Nestor  spake that honour'd Knight  § UPON a more substantial Basis we shall descend to the  Romans  among whom in the very Infancy of their Military Glory a Society of Knights was instituted immediately after their Union with the  Sabines Romulus  inrolled  Centuriae tres Equitum  three Centuries of Knights out of the chiefest Families whom he appointed to be his Lifeguard and called them  C  leres  from their Activity and Dispatch in Martial Affairs  Tarquinius Priscus  made an Addition to these Centuries the like did  Servius Tullius  who ordained that those who should succeed in that Body should be elected  ex censu viz  from a considerable and certain Valuation of their Estates who had the greatest Cens  and were of the most Noble Families says  Dyonys Halicarn  And soon after the Equestrian Class began to be formed and constituted one of the three Orders of the Commonwealth which were thus rank'd according to  Livy Senatus Ordo Equestris Plebs  which in the  Roman  Literal Notes is set down after this Manner CON SEN E ORD P Q R And forasmuch as this Degree is placed between the  Patricians  or Senators and the  Plebeians  it answers exactly the State of our Knights between the Nobility and Commonalty And from this Order to the Height of Nobility which resided in the Senators was the Way prepared  Junius Brutus  being the first who was raised to a Senator from the Equestrian Order  IT was a Constitution as old as  Tib  rius  's Reign that none should be admitted unless Freeborn or a Gentleman for three Generations and indeed for a long Time none were elected Knights but the best Sort of Gentlemen and Persons of Extraction as was the illustrious  Ma  cenas  A  avis regibus ortns eques  Mart  who aspired no higher not out of any Incapacity of attaining greater Honours but that he desired them not says  Paterculus  Yet at length thro' Corruption of Times  Plebeians  and Freedmen being too frequently received into this Degree too near a Parallel among the Knights of this Age occasion'd their Power to grow less and less 'till it shrunk to nothing so that the Places and Offices of Judges which they before had executed became conferrable upon the  Publicans  And when  Cicero  was Consul  anno ab urbe conditi  the Equestrian Order stood in need of Reestablishment whereupon they were then incorporated into that Commonwealth in the third Degree all Acts passing  in the Name of the Senate the People of  Rome  and the Equestrian Order  They often enjoy'd Abroad the Government of several Provinces whereof  Egypt  had this peculiar to itself that none of the Senators were admitted but only those of the Equestrian Order whose Decrees  Augustus  commanded to be had in like Regard as if the Magistrates of  Rome  or Kings Consuls or Praetors had pronounced them  AS a Mark of Eminence they had the Titles of  Splendidi  and  Illustres  bestowed upon them and sometimes have been called  most sacred  Knights  AND besides other Privileges they had Seats with the Senators in the  Circus Maximus  and by the  Roscian  Law sat next them in the Theatres They had likewise a College called  Collegium Equitum  and Temples were dedicated to the Goddess  Fortune  under the Title of  Equestri Fortunae  HAVING shewn the Dignity and Honours of the Equestrian Order among the  Romans  we shall now touch upon the Degrees of Knighthood which have been Personal and may be comprehended under the Modern Title of  Equites Aurati  or  Milites Simplices  as distinguish'd from the several Orders of Chivalry instituted in Christendom In the Circumstance of whose Creation we confess nothing in the  Roman Ordo Equestris  hath place tho' that might be the Ground and Original of the Dignity and one common End in both namely the Pursuit of Military Exploits and Service in the Wars  § OF the Degrees of Knighthood We shall first of the  Monozons i e  Knights begirt with the Military Girdle a Custom devolved to the  Germans  and  Gauls  from ancient Times and from them to AfterAges  SIR  Henry Spelman  notes  That the late Emperors conferred the Dignity af Knighthood with the Military Girdle instead of all other Arms because that Part more eminent amongst them girdeth supporteth and adorneth the rest  whence  Selden  calls this Girding the most essential part of the Ceremony Nor do we find among the various Ceremonies of  Knighthood  any that have continued so constant in Practice as the endowing with Girdle and Sword Ornaments proper to the Dignity and Marks of  Honour  and  Vertue  with which the Statues and Portraitures of  Knights  on their Gravestones have been adorned  FOR as at this Day  Knights  are styled  Equites Aurati  from the Golden Spurs heretofore put on at their Creation so were they more anciently  Singulo Miletari donati  in respect when any one was  Knighted  he was not only smitten with the Sword but invested with Sword and Belt yet retain'd at the creating our Knights of the  Bath  as the old Formulary thus hath it Then shall the King of great Favour take the Sword and gi  d the  quire therewith  Secondly The  Baccalaurei  or Knights Batchelors are to be consider'd who are indifferently styled  Chevaliers Milites Equites Aurati  and  Knights  This Degree is truly accounted the first of all Military Dignity and the Foundation of all Honours in our Nation and is derived from if not the same with that immediately preceding For as the Ceremony of a gentle Touch on the Shoulder with the flat Side of the Sword hath been since used instead of girting with the Sword and Belt especially in Times of War or in Haste as an Initiation into the Military Order so on the contrary it is not unusual nowadays for the Prince at least  Gladi    if not  Cingulo donare  for he oftentimes bestows the Sword upon the Person he  Knigh  e    Miraeus  gives them the Epithet  Aurati  from the Privilege of wearing Gold upon their Swords and Spurs omitting  Tiraquel  's fanciful Distinction between  Miles  and  Eques Auratus  who allows the former to signify a Knight Noble before and the other to deno  e one whom we call a Knight and no Gentleman or applicable to the  Neapo  an  Gentlemen usually called  Cavali  ri  who  are all styled  Equites  tho' they never have attained the Knightly Dignity  THE third Sort were  Knights Banerets  who so well deserv'd in the Wars that they were afterwards permitted to use  Vexillum quadratum  a square Banner whence they were called  Equites vexillarii  or  Chevaliers a Buniere  from the Dutch  Banerheere  Lord or Master of the Banner  Camden  conceives this Title first devis'd by K  Edward  in Recompence of Martial Prowess a Recital of which Dignity is mention'd in a Patenr  E  to  John Coupland  for his Service in taking  David  King of  Scots  Prisoner But it was much more ancient with us as well as in  France  and they had particular Robes and other Ornaments given them from the Crown  ad apparatum suum pro militia tanquam pro Baneretto a Rege suscipienda  c  viz ad unum Tunicam  c after which is set down the particular Robes and other Ornaments appointed for his Creation  To shew this Dignity yet more ancient there is the Evidence of a Writ in K  Edw  d's Time for furnishing  Thomas Bardolf  with the Robes of a  Baneret  It is an Honour esteemed the last among the Greatest  viz Nobilitum Majorum  or the First of the Second Rank and is placed in the Middle between the  Barons  and the other  Knights  in which respect the  Baneret  may be called  Vexillarius minor  as if he were the lesser  BannerBearer  to the End he might be so differenced from the Greater namely the  Baron  to whom the Right of bearing a square Banner doth belong  BUT there are some remarkable differences between these Knights and KnightsBatchelors as in the Occasions and Circumstances of their Creations the  Baneret  being not Created unless at a Time when the King's Standard is erected and that he bears his own Banner in the Field whilst the  KnightBatchelor  follows that which is anothers  THIS farther difference is observed between them that the  KnightBaneret  had so many Gentlemen his Servants at Command as that he could raise a Banner and make up a Company of Soldiers to be maintained at his Table and with his own Pay But the  KnightBatchelor  had not sufficient for this and therefore marched under the Banner of another and the Wages of the  Baneret  were double  N  XT to these we are to mention Knights of the  Bath  which is a Degree that hath the Investiture and Title of Knight with an additional Denomination derived from Part of the Ceremony of his Creation It is the general receiv'd Opinion that our K  Hen  first instituted these Knights which is justify'd by Sir  John Froisard  who says he created of them at his Coronation chusing them from such as were either his Favorites or had pretensions to it from their personal Merits or Services  BUT if the Ceremonies and Circumstances of their Creation be well consider'd it may be inferr'd that he rather restor'd the ancient way of making Knights than Instituted them and consequently that the Knights of the  Bath  are really no other than  KnightsBatchelors  that is such as are created with those Ceremonies wherewith  KnightsBatchelors  were formerly created by Ecclesiasticks But some of them having been laid aside were then brought again into Use and made peculiar to this Degree and since continued to them upon some solemn and great Occasion  AT the first View they look like a distinct Order of Knighthood but cannot be so accounted because they have no Statutes assigned them nor are in Case of Vacancy supply'd the Essentials of distinct Orders nor do they wear their Robes beyond the Time of that Occasion upon which they were created as chiefly the Coronation of a King or Queen the Creation of a Prince of  Wales  Duke of  York  and the like whereas also their Number is uncertain and always at the Pleasure of the King  Favine  calls them Knights of the Crown because to distinguish them from Esquires they wore upon their Left Shoulder an Escutcheon of Black Silk embroider'd with three Crowns of Gold but therein he mistakes for they never used only a Silk Lace and the Jewel they wore was made of Gold containing three Crowns with this Motto  Tria juncta in una  hanging down under the left Arm at a Carnation Ribbon worn cross the Body  THIS leads us to the Degree of Baronets who seem allied to Knighthood by having granted them the Addition of  Sir  to be set before their Names But this gives them not the Dignity of Knighthood nor can they properly be flyled Knights until they be actually Knighted  IT is a Degree erected  Anno    Jac  and the Grant made by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of  England  It is Hereditary to them and the Heirs Male of their Bodies lawfully begotten for ever and by a subsequent Decree of the said King Precedence is granted to them before all Banerets except such as should be made by the King under his Standard display'd in an Army Royal in open War and the King personally present and next to and immediately after the younger Sons of Viscount and Barons  THE Ground for erecting this Degree was partly Martial for tho' themselves were not enjoined personal Service in the Wars yet each Baronet was to maintain thirty Foot Soldiers for three Years in  Ireland  after the rate of Eight Pence  per  Day for the Defence of that Kingdom and chiefly to secure the Plantation of  Ulster  THEY were at least to be descended from a Grandfather on the Father's Side that bore Arms and had a Revenue of l  per Ann  or Lands of old Rents of equal Value with l  per Ann  of improv'd Lands or at least two Parts of three of such Estate in Possession the other third in Reversion Expectant upon one Life held only in Jointure  THE Year after King  James  I added some new Privileges and Ornaments  viz  to Knight those already made that were no Knights and the Heirs hereafter of every Baronet should at the Age of One and Twenty Years receive Knighthood likewise that all Baronets might bear in Canton or in an Inescutcheon the Arms of  Ulster  and farther to have place in the Armies of the King in the Gross near about the Royal Standard  SINCE the Institution of Baronets in  England  there have been made divers in  Ireland  after the like Form And the Knights of  Nova Scotia  in the  WestIndies  were ordained in Imitation of Baronets in  England  by the said King  James A D  for the Planting that Country by  Scotch  Colonies and the Degree made likewise Hereditary  THESE latter wear an Orange Tawny Ribbon as their Badge to distinguish them from other Knights and it appears there was an Intention to move his then Majesty that all Baronets and Knights Bachelors might wear Ribbons of several Colours some Badge or Jewel in such Sort as did the Knights of the  Bath  to distinguish the one from the other But that Matter dropt  § WE shall now observe the Etymology of  Eques Miles Chevalier Ritter  and  Sir  The  Grecians  had a Title of Honour equivalent to the Signification of  Eques  in the  Latin  from  Equ  s  an Horse because one Part of the Ceremony whereby this Honour became conferred was the giving of an Horse or because having an Horse at the Publick Charge they received the Stipend of an Horseman to serve in the Wars Horses being Symbols of War  Bello armantur equi  It is to be noted That the Degree of Knighthood in the Dialects of other Nations hath rhe same Derivation For in the  French  a Knight is called  Chevalier  in the  German Ridder  or  Ritter q d Rider  so the  Gheslagen Ridder  is interpreted  The dubbed Knight  in the  Italian  it is  Cavagliero  in the old  British Morchog  concerning which hear one of  Jeffery Chaucer  's Scholars  Eques ab Equo is said of very right  And Chevalier is said of Chevalrie  In which a Rider called is a Knight  Arragoners done also specifie  Caballiero through all that Partie  Is Dame of Worship and so took his 'ginning  Of Spurs of Gold and chiefly Riding  AND tho' the Word  Miles  signified at first any legally inrolled for the War which Inrolment was twofold  Honoraria  and  Vulgaris  yet upon the Decay of the  Roman  Empire upon the Irruption of the innumerable Forces of the  Alani Goths Vandals  c which consisted in Horse their Foot was rendred useless  Miles  was no longer said of him that served on Foot in the Wars but began to be properly spoken of the Horseman whence it came into Vogue That among the Titles of Nobility he who had that of  Miles  bestowed on him was understood to be Horseman or  Eques  that is of the Equestrian Dignity  Selden  observes  Miles  to be equivocal and that in the old feodal Laws of the Empire it signify'd a Gentleman as the Word Gentleman is signify'd in  Nobilis  and with us it hath been frequently used to denote both Gentlemen and Knights for  Milites  denotes Gentlemen or great Freeholders and not dubbed Knights  viz  such who hold by Knights Service from a Lord of  a Mannour and such who are chosen from the several Counties to serve in the High Courts of Parliament  Miles  even in the  Saxon  Times denoted sometimes a Dignity But about the Year becoming a Title of Honour it is since most generally appropriated to Persons who have received Knighthood correspondent to  Eques  and  Chevalier  tho' indeed less proper in regard Knighthood is the Dignity of Horsemanship and the Tenure of Lands by Knights Fees here in  England  anciently called  Regale Servitium  is in truth Horse Service and the Tenants such as served the King on Horseback in Wars are Gentlemen at least if not of Noble Extraction  Minshew  says the  Equites  which heretofore followed and accompanied the Emperor are in the  German  Tongue called  Knechtes  that is Servitors or Ministers but  Camden  says  Knecht  in  Saxon Cniht  was in far more ancient Times accepted as an honorary Title and among the old  Germans  signify'd a Person arm'd with Spear and Lance the Ensigns of their Knighthood as in AfterTimes such were among other Nations adorned with a Girdle and Belt since called  Equites aurati  and sometimes simply  Milites  THE Addition  Sir  to the Names of all Knights Banerets Knights of the  Bath  and Batchelor Knights pronounced at the Time when they are created with this Compellation  Arise Sir John  or  Sir Thomas  c is accounted Parcel of their Style which the Banerets enjoy by virtue of a Clause in their Patent It is a Contraction of the Old  French  Sire taken for Seigneur or Lord from the  Greek  But how it came to be first given we cannot find nevertheless our  English  Writers have bestowed it upon the major Part of the Nobility after they had been received into the Order of Knighthood and in the Life of St  Thomas Becker  written about the Time of King  Edw  we meet with the Title prefix'd to the Names of the four Knights who slew the said St  Thomas  § THE Ensigns of the Equestrian Order among the  Romans  by which they were made was a Publick Horse or a Gold Ring yet still to those who had Equestrian Cense the Horse was the ancienter Badge of the two but when thro' the Multitude of these Knights no Publick Horses were assigned but to such who were ready to enter upon Military Service and to  fight in the Legions such were called  Legionary Knights  to distinguish them from the rest who had only receiv'd the Honour of a GoldRing for they were not all employ'd in Wars  THE Censor after the Institution of that Offiee  ab urbe condita  and afterwards the Emperor were the Persons who bestowed this  Equus Militaris  or  Publicus  as it was called from the Annual Allowance to keep him which they gave unto those of known Vertue and approv'd Life compelling him to serve in the Wars tho' against his Will but in the more ancient Method of Election Constraint was not used And upon Negligence in the Care of these Horses or any Blemish Reproach or Infamy or Loss of Patrimony in the Knights the Horses were not only taken away but the Knights wholly disfranchis'd  Rosinus  laying down the Manner and Order used in ejecting such Knights adds  A Recital being made of all the Knights that were inrolled those whose Names he omitted were thereby understood to be depriv'd of that Dignity  WHEN they had served in the Wars the Time appointed by Law it was the Custom to lead their Horses by the Bridle into the Forum before the  Duumvirs  Censors and giving an Account under whom and what Generals or Captains they had served they were thereupon dismissed from farther Service in the Wars An Example whereof  Plutarch  relates to have been given by  Pompey  himself  BUT whereas among the  Roman  Inscriptions we find  Equo publico honoratus donatus ornatus  and  exornatus  such is not to be construed to be of Equestrian Dignity but only to have received the  praemia militaria  with which the Emperors used to recompense some particular Exploit by the Honour of such a Gift according to  Salmasius Equus Publicus  by a wondrous nevertheless an accustom'd Speech among the  Romans  is the Knight  qui equo publico meret  And  qui equo publico donatus  the other deserving Person  AS to the Ring In  Genesis  we read of  Pharoah  's taking off his Ring and putting it upon  Joseph  's Hand When they came in Fashion with the  Romans  the Senators at first wore Iron ones which were accounted the Ensign of Military Vertue received upon a Publick Account Howbeit in Process of Time when Gold Rings were drawn into Use none but Senators and Knights had  them The Difference among the Rings of the three Orders in the State were as  Licetus  observes Gold Rings set with precious Stones were given to the Senators only Plain Rings without Stones to the Knights and Iron Rings to the  Plebeians  or Freebornmen insomuch that  Equestri dignitate donare  and  annulo honorare  is a promiscuous Phrase in  Tacitus  to give the Dignity of Knighthood and at the Battle of  Cannae  by the two Measures or Bushels of Gold Rings sent to  Carthage  the Number of the  Roman  Knights there slain was computed  § AT length FreedMen being created Knights the  Jus annulorum  the Right of wearing Gold Rings became promiscuous  AMONG the  Germans  the Shield and Lance were accounted the grand Badges of Military Honour or Knighthood This the  Lombards  the  Franks  and our Countrymen all descending out of  Germany  used and was to us in the Opinion of Sir  Hen Spelman  the Foundation of the Knightly Order Much like the ancient  Germans  was the Custom of making Knights among the  Irish  And  Favine  notes the Shield and Lance were the proper Arms appertaining to a  French  Knight which Esquires  Armigers  carried always after their Masters Shields and Scutes as they are vulgarly called  i e  Equestrian Targets inclining to an Oval not Shields or Bucklers of Foot Soldiers  ANOTHER Ensign and Ornament of Knightly Honour is the  Cingulum militare  or  Balteus  which  Varro  says is  Tuscan  signifying a military Girdle which were garnished with great Buckles Studs and Rings of pure Gold to shew their Dignity and Power in military Commands and with such a Belt set with Pearls and precious Stones young  Athelstan  was girded when he receiv'd  Knighthood  from his Grandfather King  Alfred  Our Knights were no less anciently known by these Belts than by their gilt Swords Spurs c Howbeit the Use now only appears in Knights of the  Bath  To this Belt was also added a Sword not of Ordinary Use and therefore termed the Sword of a  Knight  which was hallowed with great Ceremony  ANOTHER eminent Badge is the Golden Spurs wherewith at the Time of their Creation Knights Spurs were wont to be adorned and to these a little after the Conquest were added far more and greater Oruaments They were usually put on after the Person had been  presented to the Prince who gave the Honour to signify that the newmade Knight should not only declare his Valour by his Sword but also by the Management of his Horse which he should encourage and excite with his Spurs to the carrying on his valiant Designs These Spurs have been of that Esteem that Knight Batchelors are latinized  Equites aurati  among the  Germans Ritter dess Gulden Sporns  and with us heretofore  Knights of the Spurs  And several Families by the Name of  Knight  bear for their Arms the Spurs on a Canton  IT is farther certify'd among the Rights of a Knight Baneret that upon the Account of his Knighthood he may wear gilt Spurs as well as a gilt Sword and that the Spurs are essential may be collected from the Degradation of a Knight where his gilt Spurs are first cut off with an Hatchet the Case of Sir  Andra Harcla  In the last Place is the Collar an Ensign of Knightly Dignity among the  Germans Gauls Britons Danes  and  Goths  among whom it was customary to wear them as denoting such as were remarkable for their Valour But in lat  r Times it was the peculiar Fashion of  Knights  among us to wear Golden Collars composed of  S S  or other various Devices so that those  Monuments  are known to be erected for  Knights  on whose Portraitures such Ornaments are found  § THE Qualifications for Knighthood are principally three Merit the bare mentioning whereof shall suffice here Birth  viz  that the Parties who enter thereinto ought first to make appear they be Gentlemen of three Paternal Descents bearing Coat Armour and much the same was the Law of the Empire under  Frederick    A D  Some think it also insufficient unless descended so by the Mother's Side at least she must be a freed Woman And Estate which also serves to support the Dignity  THUS Wealth was so much regarded among the  Chal  donians  that those who were rich bore the Name of Knights It was Estate that entitled a Man to this Honour among the  Romans  for the Censor might compel any Citizen equal to the Equestrian Cense whom he thought fit to take that Order And this consisted of Sesterces  i e  l of our Money  AND as in  Old Rome  so here in  England  not long after the Conquest they who held a Knights Fee  viz  Acres of Land might claim it says  Camden  But it appears from  Selden  that no certain Number or Extent  of Acres made a Knight's Fee  and  Temp Hen  and  Edw  and  Edw  the  Census militis  was measured by l by the Year or more and by the Royal Prerogative some who held then at other times then and sometimes l Lands were required to accept this Honour by Writs directed to the Sheriffs of the Counties and were excused only by Reason of old Age irrecoverable Weakness Loss of Limbs or being in Holy Orders and upon all other Causes if exempted they paid a Fine estimated according to the Nature of the Excuse or length of Time given  BUT in the promiscuous Course of Knighthood where the Men of Wealth and Estate whether otherwise worthy or not became dignify'd yet the Gate of Honour was not then shut against those who wanting Riches deserved well of their Country for when Princes conferr'd such Dignities upon Men of narrow Fortunes they usually bestowed with them annual Pensions or Lands agreeable to the Judgment of the Author of the  Division du monde  who saith that the Honour of Knighthood is not to be given any Person who hath not a considerable Estate unless sufficient Means to support the Honour of the Order be also given with it  THESE Pensions are frequently mention'd in our Rolls  sometimes during Pleasure and sometimes during the Life of the Knight or till better Provision should be made for their Supports Examples whereof are Sir  John Atte Lee  Sir  Nele Loring  Sir  John Walsh  Knights The like Rewards our Kings gave to such whose Merit raised them to the Degree of a  Ban  ret  express'd in their Patents  ad manutenendum statum Baneretti Pro sustentatione sua ut ipse statum Baneretti melius manutenere possit Pro statu suo manutenendo  or Words to the like Effect Examples where of are Sir  Reginald Cobham  Sir  Thomas de Rokeley  Sir  John Lysle  and Sir  Roger de Swynerton  Banerets  IT may be next consider'd who can make  Knights  wherein it is apparent that they who never were and others who never could be  Knights  have conferr'd this Dignity yet 'tis to be understood that Necessity and Custom hath in this Case the Force of a Law For anciently  Bishops  and  Priests  made  Knights  so also do the  Popes  and some Commonwealths likewise our  Queens  For the  Sovereign  or the  Heir apparent  tho' they be no  Knights  may nevertheless do it by reason they possess the  Kingdom  and are therefore the Head and Chief of  Chevalry  and consequent all the Power thereof is contained  in their Command To conclude this Point  Knighthood  was always received from the Hands of another Person either by Ceremony or Diploma except only the Kings of  Spain  who Time out of Mind made themselves  Knights  and this by Vertue of an old Law written in the  Arragonian  Tongue as  Ambrosias Morales  repotts  And to shew that no Man upon Earth hath any Power over him he shall gird himself with the Sword made after the  orm of a Cross and that Day can no other Man be Knighted  § Of the Ceremonies and Formalities used at the Conferring of Knighthood the most ancient was perform'd by putting the Belt Ioose over the Shoulder or girding it close about the Waste The  Bend  in  Armoury  represents the one and the  Fess  the other The first Christian Kings at giving this Belt kissed the new Knight on the Left Cheek saying  In the Honour of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost I make you a Knight  It was called  Osculum pacis  the Kiss of Favour or Brotherhood and is presumed to be the Accollade or Ceremony of Imbracing which  Charles  the Great used when he Knighted his Son  Lewis  the  D  bonair  It was in the Time of the same Emperor the Way of Knighting by the  Colaphum  or Blow on the Ear used in Sign of sustaining future Hardships which is thought to have been deriv'd from the Manner of Manumission of a Slave among the  Romans  a Custom long after retained in  Germany  and  France  Thus  William  Earl of  Holland  who was to be Knighted before he could be  Emperor  at his being elected King of the  Romans  received Knighthood by the Box of  he Ear c from  John  King of  Bohemia A D    IN the Time of the  Saxons  here in  England  Knights received their Institutions at the Hands of Great  Prelates  or  Abbots  which according to their Opinion render'd them more auspicious In the accomplishing of which Solemnity they added many religious Ceremoni  s as Watching Fasting Bathing and Consecrating the Sword an Instance of which we have in  Heward  Lord of  Brune  in in  Lincolnshire  who received this Honour from  Brand Abbot  of St  Edmundsbury  But not long after the Conquest this Custom was restrained by a Synod a  Westminst  r A D    H  whic  among other Things ordained  Ne Abbates i e  all Spiritnal Persons  saciunt militas  However the religious Ceremonies for the most part continued especially Vigils and Bathings as appears by that grand Solemnity at the Creation of Knights Son  of Earls Barons and Knights upon  Whitsontide anno    Edw  cited by  Selden  and  Camden  And these Formalities the  Saxons  and  Normans  not only here in  England  but the  French Spaniards  and other Nations observ'd concluding from it that decency of Habit was as well expected from them as Integrity of Life and purity of Manners And the like religious Ceremony was heretofore observ'd in  Spain  at the Creation of Knights whether  Cavelleros de Espuela d' Orada  or  Amados  our Knights Batchelors In this Form the Person to be Knighted was bathed in the Evening and presently laid in Bed then cloathed in rich Robes and led to the Church to perform his Vigils That being over and Mass heard his Spurs were put on and his Sword girt about him then drawn out and put into his Right Hand whereupon the Oath was forthwith administred to him which taken he that bestowed the Dignity gave him  una Pesconade  a Blow or Stroke on the Neck saying God assist you in the Performance of your Promise  THE Oath or Vow the Knights professed was in general to relieve and protect Widows the Fatherless Oppressed and Miserable and to defend the Church of God which to keep and perform was esteem'd as meritorious as to do all that a Monk Frier or Canon Regular should  THERE is also mention by Mr  Selden  of consecrating the Sword offering it at the Altar and receiving it again from thence as an implicit Kind of taking an Oath But as in Peace and great Leisure these tedious Ceremonies were used yet it was otherwise in Times of War or on a Day of Battle where Hurry and Throng of Affairs would not permit and therefore as well before the joining of Battle as after Victory obtained it was usual for the Prince or General in the Field on Sight of the Army to give those whom he thought fit to advance to that Honour they humbly kneeling before him a Stroke with a naked Sword flatwise upon their Shoulders or else to touch their Heads or Shoulders lightly without any other Ceremony except pronouncing  Sis Eques in nomine Dei  to which he adds  Rise SirKnight  or in the  French Sus  or  Sois Chevalier au nom de Dieu  which we commonly call Dubbing the old  English  Word used for Creating Consecrating a Knight from  doopen  to dip by Bathing  ANOTHER Manner of creating Knights Abroad was by Royal Codicils or Letters Patents these the  Spaniards  call  Privilegios de Cavelleria  whereupon such Knights are intitled  Equites Codicellares  and these were sent to such as dwelt in remote Countries and sometimes but rarely extended so as to make the Degree hereditary There is one Example that by the bare signification of Letter without any Ceremonies or Patents under Seal  Philip  IV of  Spain Jan  conferr'd upon all the Captains that behav'd themselves valiantly in Defence of  Mastricht  then lately besieg'd by the  Hollanders  to those that were Gentlemen the Title of Knights and to others that of Gentlemen  HAVING thus briefly shew'd the various Forms of Creation of  Knights Batchelors  I shall remark what  Seld  n  has observ'd of  Knights Bannerets  in later Times wherein he that was advanc'd to that Honour in the Field was inducted between two Senior Knights with Trumpets before them and the Heralds carrying a long Banner of his Arms call'd a  Penon  in which Manner being brou  ht to the King or Lieutenant who bidding him good Success the Tip of the Banner is cut off that of an Obl  ng it might become a Square like the Banner of a Baron This done he returns to his Tent conducted as b  fore As for the many and various Formularies at the Creation of a Knight of the  ath  see Sir  Edward  ys  among his Not  s upon  Utton  and Sir  William Dugdale  's  Warwicksh  The Knights of the  Bat    at the Coronation of King  Charles  II watched and bathed they took an Oath they were girded with a Sword and Belt and lastly dubbed by the King with the Sword of State  § IN the Dignity Honour and Renown of Kni  hthood is included somewhat of Magnificence more excellent than Nobility it self which mounting the Royal Throne becomes the Assertor of Civil Nobility and  its as Judge at the Tribunal therefore  Knight  is noted by  Camden  as a Name of Dignity but  Baron  is not so For if heretofore a Baron had not receiv'd Knighthoo  he was written plainly by his Christian Name and that of his Family without any Addition but that of  Dominus  a Term attributed to a  Knight  and in ancient Charters the Titles and Names of  Knights  may be seen set before  Barons  It bestows Gentility not onl  upon the meanly Born but upon h  s Descendant  ncreaseth the Honour of those welldescended Hereunto agrees the CommonLaw If a Villain be made a Knight he is thereby immediately enfranchised and consequently accounted a Gentleman agreeable to the  Roman  Law where the Donation of a GoldRing ennobled a Slave  Moecen  s  dy'd a Companion of that Order even Kings and Princes look upon it as an Accession to their Honour their other Titles shewing Dominion and Power this their Valour and Courage  Geysa  King of  Hungary Leopold  Marquis of  Austria Ottacher  Duke of  Stiria  and  Frederick  Duke of  Austria  and  Stiria Godfry  Duke of  Brabant  with  Henry  his Son  Peter  King of  Arragon  the Emperor  Henry  III our  William Rufus  King  Edward  III  Henry  VI  Henry  VII  Edward  VI  Lewis  XI  Francis  I Kings of  France  and others received this Dignity at the Time they enjoy'd their other Titles And tho' it is said the Sons of the  French  King are Knights as soon as they receive Baptism yet are they not judg'd worthy the Kingdom unless first solemnly created And we elsewhere find that the Royal Heirs of  Arragon  were suspended from that Crown until they had received the Honour of Knighthood And after the  Norman  Conquest our young Princes were sent over to the neighbouring Kings to receive this Honour Thus our King  Henry  II was sent to  David  King of  Scots  and Knighted by him in  Carlisle  and  Edward  I at the Age of Fifteen Years to  Alphonsus  XI King of  Castile  for the same Dignity In like manner did foreign Princes repair hither to receiv  the Honour from our Kings As  Malcolme  King of  Scotland  and  Alexander  Son of  William  King of  Scotland  Knighted by our King  John Anno  So was  Alexander  III by our King  Henry  III at  York Anno  and  Magnus  King of the  sle of Man  by the same King All which sufficiently demonstrate the great Renown of Knighthood and the Hono  r and Esteem which was ever had for that Order  CAP II Of the Religious Orders of Knighthood in Christendom  § THE Grounds and Causes of founding  Societies  or  Knightly Orders  were several and different tho' all terminated in one End Among which principally were these  First  A sincere Love to  Honour  and therein chiefly to excite and promote  Vertue  by suitable Rewards such was the Design of King  Arthur  when he formed himself and other Martial Men into a Fellowship which he stiled  Knights of the Round Table Secondly  To repress the Incursions and Robberies of the  Saracens  and  Barbarians  to vindicate the Oppressed redeem the Enslaved and to entertain and relieve Pilgrims and Strangers which were Part of the Duties the  Knights Hospitallers  and  Templars  c stood engag'd in A  third  Reason was To Fight in Defence of the Christian Faith against Pagans and Infidels to enlarge the Christian Territories and promote the Service of the Catholick Church And indeed their Zeal very much advanced Christianity  Lastly  When Sovereign Princes perceived themselves embroiled in Wars or dangerous Factions the erecting such an Order or Society was that they might by such a Tye restore Peace quiet all Jealousies unite Affections and secure a lasting Friendship and powerful Assistance both for their own and their Country's Safety And to this End were Badges of several Orders devised as Pledges of Remembrance to quicken and establish their Friendship  § THESE Orders are of Two Kinds  Religious  or  Ecclesiastical  and  Military  or  Secular  § THE Institutions of the latter Sort were after a while thought too weak to continue if not sustained  by Religion and Piety and too defective without adjoyning Ecclesiastical Persons thereunto Therefore the Founders considering Divine Assistance should concur with Military Industry began to dedicate these Orders to the Honour and Worship of God or to our Saviour or to the blessed Virgin or some other of the Saints to gain the Protection and Favour of Heaven more easily as they thought obtainable by the Prayers and Offices of the Clergy Whereupon some in their Institution joyned Sacred Orders to their Military and made Provision for Sacred Persons to pray for their Prosperity at home while they were engaged abroad Hence King  Ed    III at the first Institution of the  Garter  appointed Thirteen Secular Canons and Thirteen Vicars to attend the Celebration of Divine Offices Upon the same Account certain Foundations of Divine Service were erected at  Bug  y  for the Order of the  Annunciads  at  Dijon  for the Order of the  Golden Fleece  and at  Mont St Michael  in  Normandy  for the Order of St  Michael  I shall now deliver a brief Account of the Religious Orders of Knighthood proceeding according to their Antiquity    The Knights of the  Holy Sepulchre  in  Jerusalem  are accounted the most Ancient  DR  H  ylin  reports this Order to be instituted  A D  at such Time as the Temple of  Jerusalem  was regain'd from the  Saracens  by  Philip  King of  France  Yet  Favin  will have it to be by  Baldwin  the First King of  Jerusalem  for while the  Saracens  possess'd the City there were certain Canons Regular of St  Augustin  to whom they permitted the Custody of the Holy Sepulchre These Canons  Baldwin  made Men of Arms and  Knights of the Holy Sepulchre  and ordained that they should nevertheless retain their white Habits and on the Breast bear his own Arms which were  Argent a Cross potent Or  between  four Crosses of the same  commonly call'd  The  Jerusalem  Cross  Their Great Master was the Patriarch of  Jerusalem  They were to guard the Sepulchre fight against the  Saracens  and Infidels protect Pilgrims  redeem Christian Captives hear Mass every Day recite the Hours of the Cross and to bear the five red Crosses in memory of our Saviour's Wounds Their Rule was confirm'd by Pope  Innocent  III Upon the loss of the Holy Land these Knights retired to  Perugia  in  Italy  but retaining their white Habit chang'd their Arms to a double  red Cross A D  they were incorporated to the  Knights Hospitallers of  Jerusalem then in  Rhodes  But  A D    Alexand  r  VI made himself and the Popes his Successors Great Masters thereof and empower'd the Guardian of the Holy Sepulchre his Vicar General to bestow the same upon Pilgrims to the Holy Land  Philip  II King of  Spain  endeavour'd to restore this Order in some of his Dominions about the Year himself being elected Great Master And another Attempt was made by the Duke of  Nevers  but these Designs took no Effect    Knights Hospitallers of St  John Baptist  in  Jerusalem  BEFORE the taking of  Jerusalem  from the  Saracens  certain Christian Merchants of  Naples  obtain'd leave from the Caliph of  Egypt  to erect a small and convenient House for the Entertainment of themselves and Countrymen which they built before the Church of the  Holy Sepulchre  together with a small Oratory To them repair'd certain Canons of the Order of St  Augustin  who built another Oratory but the Confluence of Pilgrims growing great they erected a large Hospital in the Place where our Saviour celebrated his last Supper for the better accommodating devout Travellers who for want of a Place to lodge in were often robb'd and murder'd So that at length from their Charity and Hospitality as also for that they took St  John Baptist  for their Patron they obtain'd that Title It was instituted  A D  or according to others by  Gerard  a Native of  Thoulouse  who came to  Jerusalem  in the Time of  Codsry  of  Bouillon  and built this Hospital which became the first Seat of this Order dedicated to St  John  of  Cyprus  Bp of  Alexandria  commonly call'd  Jo  nnes Eleemosynarius  and King  Baldwin  I conferred on them large Privileges permitting them Arms and instituted them to be Knights  A D  Their Duty was to fight against the Infidels and they acknowledged Obedience to the Patriarch of  Jerusalem  but growing rich they obtained from  Rome  to be absolved from that Obedience Pope  Gelasius  II or  Calixtus  II  A D  confirmed their Rule of living and  Adrian  IV receiv'd them under the Protection of the Papal See being likewise endowed with ample Privileges and exempted from Payment of Tithes by succeeding Popes chiefly by  Pius  IV  THEY took the black Habit of Hermits of St  Augustin  and lived under his Rule by Grant of  Honorius  II  Anno  vowing Obedience Poverty and Chastity and on the Breast of their Habit wore at first a plain Cross of White Cloth which was after changed to one with Eight Points but in time of War they used a Red Cassock bearing the White Cross upon it Unto  Gerard  succeeded  Raimund  who digested and enlarged their Laws and Institutions in the Composition whereof his Stile was  Raimundus Dei gratia servus pauperum Jesu Christi Custos Hospitalis Jerusolymitani  but afterwards he and his Successors had the Title of Great Master of the Order given him to denote his Power and Authority At this Day he has the Title of Prince of  Malta  and  Goza  among his Privileges he seals in Lead as doth the Pope and Doge of  Venice  he acknowledges the Pope for his Head and the King of  Spain  for his Patron he had under him in several Kingdoms Prio  s some of whom had also the Addition of Great with us in  England  he was stiled  Prior Hospitalis St Johannis J  rusalem in Anglia  and by that Title was he summoned to the Parliament as a Baron of this Kingdom and at length for Place and Precedency was ranked the first Baron and the greatness of these Knights grew to such height that  temp H  they had in Christendom Mannors  WHEN  Saladine  took  J  rusalem  these Knights retreated to  A  res  or  Ptol  mais  and that being taken they seized upon the Island of  Rhodes A D  whence they began to be call'd Knights of  Rhodes  but  A D  being driven thence by  Solyman  they betook themselves to the Island  of  Malta  which with  Tripoli  and  Goza  were granted to them in Fee by the Emperor  Charles  V  A D  under the Tender of one Falcon yearly to the Viceroy of  Sicily  and to acknowledge the King of  Spain  and  Sicily  for their Protectors In this Isle they continue a Bulwark to those Parts and from this their Settlement are called Knights of  Malta    Knights  Templars  ABOUT the Year or this Order took Beginning  Baldwin  II then reigning in  Jerusalem  when Nine Gentlemen of whom Two of noble Extraction  Hugh de Paganes  and  Godfrey de St Omer  came in Devotion to the  Holy Land  they were called Brothers of the Militia of the Temple ordinarily Knights Templars from the Habitation assigned them out of a part of the King's own Palace adjoyning to the Temple of  Solomon  in  Jerusalem  Their first Undertaking was to guard the most dangerous Ways about that City against the Violence and Robberies of the  Saracens  which made them acceptable to all and for which they had Remission of their Sins but for the first Nine Years they were yet so poor that they lived upon the Alms of others wore Clothes bestowed in Charity upon them and rode two on one Horse in memory of which primitive Poverty their Seal had the Impress which is represented in  Math Paris A D  They had Rules assigned them drawn up by St  Bernard  Abbot of  Clairvaux  by the Appointment of Pope  Honorius  II and  Stephen  Patriarch of  Jerusalem  They made their Vows of Obedience Poverty and Chastity and to live under the Rules of Canons regular of St  Augustin  Their Habit was White to which in the Time of  Eugenius  III they added the Red Cross and of the same Form that the Hospitallers wore    avin  says a patriarchal Cross and sowed it on the left Shoulder of the  Ma  lles  These with the Holy Sepulchre Hospitallers and Teutonicks principally supported a long time the Kingdom of  Jerusalem  but when Riches encreas'd and their Revenues augmented they grew proud sell from the Obedience of the Patriarch to joyn with the Pope and at last  all the Knights of this Order in  France  were in one and the same Hour seized and imprison'd by  Philip le  el  King of  Fra  ce  with Consent of Pope  Clement  V being charged with most infamous and damnable Crimes And in  England Anno    Ed  they were also apprehended afterwards rendred Convicts and all their Poss  ssions seized into the King s Hands Howbeit the B shop of  York  commiserating their dep  orable Condition within his Diocess charitably disposed of them in Monasteries under his Jurisdiction Two Years after many of these Knights were burn'd in  rance  and  Jaqu  s de la Ma  le  the last great Master suff  red the same Fate having seen  A D  his Order by Papal Au hority condemned and perpetually dissolved after which their Lands were annex  d to the Hospitallers for their Service against the  Turks  T  US they fell no l  ss famous for Martial Atchievments in the East than their Weal h in the West for they enjoyed Lordships in  Europe  and a  Spanish  Author tells us their Revenue was Two Millions yearly and h  d in possession Commanderies which occasion'd divers to think they were f  lsly accused and by suborned Witnesses merely upon the Ambition and covetous Design of  Phil p  King of  rance    Knigh  s of the Ord  r of St  Lazarus  T  ESE were at the first a Fraternity of Religious Monks after which they became Eccl  si  stick Knights in Imitation of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre Pope  P  s  V s  les it  Ant quissimum Charitatis M  ti  risti Ordin  m  yet it must be understood as an Order of Monks founded by St  Pas    about the time of  u  an the Apostate A D  upon a Charitable Account  viz  to take Care of Leprous Persons a Malady frequent in the East by which they became separated even from the Conversation of Men At length through the Incursion of the  Barbarians  and Injury of Time it lay extinguish'd but was revived when the  Latin  Princes joyned in a Holy League to recover the  H  y Land  And a famous Hospital was erected at  Jerusa  m  under the Title of St  La  rus  for the Reception of Lepers For in that Time  he Monks of this Order added Martial Discipline to their Skill in Physick and for their Services against the Infid  ls begat a great Esteem from  Baldwin  II King of  Jerusalem  and some of his Successors In process of Time this Order decayed being suppressed by  Innocent  VIII who united it to the  Hospitallers  at  Rhodes A D  Nevertheless  Pius  IV restored it  A D  confirming the old and granting new Privileges making his Kinsman Don  Janot de Chastillon  great Master  Pius  V  A D  enlarged their Privileges permitting them to take one Wife only to wit a Virgin not a Widow Lastly Pope  Gregory  XIII  A D  bestowed the Great Mastership of this Order upon  Emanuel Philibert  Duke of  Savoy  and his Successors and prescribed them the  Cistercian  Rule and accordingly he had the Investiture and Collation of the  Commanderies  in  Spain  and  Italy    Knights of the  Teutonick  Order or  Prussia  IN the Time of the Holy War a wealthy Gentleman of  Germany  who dwelt at  Jerusalem  commiserating the Condition of his Countrymen coming thither in Devotion made his House their Receptacle afterwards he erected a Chapel to the Blessed Virgin whence they had also the Title of  Marian  Knights To him associated other  Germ  ns  and in short time encreasing they professed the Military Employments of the  Templars  and followed the Acts of Piety and Charity of the  Hospitallers A D  or they elected  Henry Walpott  their first Master and the following Year were confirmed by  Celestine  III under the Title of Knights  T  utonicks  or  Dutch  Knights of the Hospital of St  Mary  the Virgin vowing Poverty Obedience and Charity and following the Rule of St  Augustin  Their Statutes were composed from those of the  Hospitallers  and  Templars  and One Article was  That none but  Germans  should be of this Order  Their Habit was a White Mantle on the Breast a plain  Black Cross  but some make it a  Black Cross  voided with a  Cross Potent  At  Acon  they erected another Hospital but after that  City was taken by  Saladine  they removed under  Hermannus  their Master into  Germany  on whom the Emperor  Frederick  II  A D  and Pope  Honorius  III bestowed  Prussia  where having conquer'd that Nation and reduced it from Paganism they built the City of  Maryburgh  and there  A D  fixed the chief Residence of their great Master This Country they enjoyed till that  Albertus Brandenburgh  the last great Master made solemn Renunciation of that Order and became feudatory to  Sigismond  I King of  Poland  who created this  Albert  first Duke of  Prussia  However some of the Knights disrellishing this Action elected another great Master  viz Albert Wolfang  and leaving  Prussia  setled in  Germany  where they now reside The younger Sons of the  German  Princes being for the most part received into this Order giving it the greatest Reputation    Knights of  MountJoy  THESE are so called from a Castle where this Order was instituted built upon the Point of a Mountain not far from  Jerusalem  whence the Pilgrims first view'd the  Holy City  and where these Knights lay in Garrison Their Habit was White and the Badge thereof an  Octogonal Cross R  d  they vowed Poverty Chastity and Obedience and followed the Rule of St  Basil  which Pope  Alexander  III  A D  changed to that of  Augustine  Upon the Loss of the  Holy Land  they retired to  Spain  and fought against the  Moors  and according to the Places they resided in had other Names in  Ca  alonia  and  Valentia Equites de Mongoia  i e  Mount Joy  but in  Castile  Knights of  Monfrac  a Castle there When  Alphonso  IX King of  Cas  le  gave them Lands they had won from the  Moors  the Donation says  To you Don  Rodrigo Gonsales  Master of  Monfrac  of the Order of  Mount Joy Upon the Decay of this Order  A D  this Castle was given to Don  Gonsalionez  Master of the Order of  Calatrava  by  Ferdinand  the Saint and these Knights were incorporated with them    Knights of St  John  of  Acon  or  Acres  UNDER the Patronage of this Saint was this Order erected they exercised all Duties of Charity towards Pilgrims and assumed Arms in imitation of the  Hospitellers  they followed the Rule of St  Augustine  and according to  Favina  had a Black Habit upon which they wore a  White Cross patee  After  Acon  was taken they removed into  Spain  and flourished in the Reign of  Alphonsus  the Astrologer King of  Castile  about which time Pope  Alexander  IV approved the Order under the conjoined Title of St  Thomas  and St  John  of  Acon  This King gave them by his Will all the Furniture of his House and much Money but afterward they dwindled and at last were united to the  Hospitallers  The Ensign was a  Red Cross  in the middle whereof stood the Figures of St  John  and St  Thomas    Knights of St  Thomas  DISTINCT from the former yet wearing the same Habit as the Knights of St  John  of  Acon  making the same Processions and following the same Rule their Badge was a  Saltire Gules  or as others are of Opinion the same with that of St  John  of  Acon  wanting the Figures in the middle But  Favin  reports this Order was instituted by King  Richard  I after the Surprizal of  Acon  and that these Knights were of the  English  Nation who wore a White Habit and a  Red Cros    charged in the middle with an  Es  llon  and that St  Thomas Be  k  was their Patron Howbeit after the Christians were driven out of the  Holy Land  the Knights of this Order were joined to the  H  spi  llers    Knights of St  Blaze  THESE were also called Knights  d  S  a Maria  they were Officers and Servants to the Kings of  Armenia  their Habit was Sky colour with a  Cross Gold  on their Breasts others say a  R  d Cross  and in the middle th  Picture of St  Blaze  their Patron This Order was at the height when the  Armenian  Kings of the House of  Luzignan  kept their Court in  Acon    Knights of the Martyrs in  Palestine  THESE took their Denomination from an Hospital in  Palestine  dedicated to St  Cosmus  and St  Damianus  Martyrs where Acts of Charity were exercised towards Sick Strangers Their Profession obliged them to other Works of Mercy  viz  to redeem Captives and bury their Dead They followed the Rule of St  Basil  which was confirmed to them by Pope  John  XXII There Badge was a  Red Cross  in the middle whereof within a Circle was the aforesaid Two  Saints  When they retir'd into  Europe  they changed into a  Red Cross  and St  Augustin  's Rule    Knights of St  Catherine  at Mount  Sinai  THIS Order was instituted  A D  under the Patronage of St  Catherine  whose Body was there deposited in the Church of the Monastery erected and dedicated to her Name Their first Institution was to guard the said Sepulchre to secure Travellers defend the  Grecian  Pilgrims and to relieve them with Hospitality Their Habit was White and they lived under the Rule of St  Basil the Great  vowing conjugal Chastity and Obedience to the Abbot of this Monastery who was their Superior But when the  Turks  obtained these Countries these Knights were ill treated and driven away and the Order almost abolished nevertheless some Shadow remains for such as travel to visit the Holy Sepulchre at  Jerusalem  do now and then pass to this Monastery at Mount  Sinai  where in imitation of the  Padre Guardian  of  Jerusalem  the principal Monk in this Covent makes them Knights of St  Catherine  over her Tomb with the like Questions and Formulary as used at the Holy Sepulchre These Knights now wear upon the left side of their White Habit the Cross of  Jerusalem  and Instrument of St  Catherine  's Martyrdom but according to others the middle of the Wheel is pierced with a Sword    Knights of St  Anthony  in  Aethiopia  AFTER the Death of St  Anthony  the Hermite who dy'd about the Year many of his Disciples remaining near  Aethiopia  follow'd his Example and Manner of Life and their Successors liv'd in great Aufterity and Solitariness in the Desart therefore call'd  Anchorites  till the Year when 'tis said  John  Emperor of  Aethiopia  erected them into a Religious Order of Knighthood under the Title and Protection of St  Anthony  Patron of his Empire and bestow'd upon them great Privileges and being thus instituted they receiv'd St  Basil  's Rule and cohabited in Monasteries Their Habit is black with a blue Cross  Tau  Their chief Seat is in the  Isle of Meroe  but in other Parts of  Aethiopia  they have great Numbers of Convents and no less than of annual Revenue The eldest Sons of Nobles and Gentlemen cannot be admitted but the second Sons may and if a Man except a Physician have three Sons he is bound to assign one of them to be of this Order Their Vow is to observe conjugal Chastity to die in Defence of the Christian Faith to guard the Empire to obey their Laws and their Superiors and to go to War when and wheresoever commanded Moreover they take an Oath not to fight in Wars between Christians nor receive Holy Orders or marry without License They are of two Sorts One employ'd in the Wars the other who being Old are exempted from Military Services and retire themselves under the Title and Profession of Monks to the Abbies where they first took their Habit before which they must serve three Years against the  Arabian  Pyrates about the  Red Sea  three Years against the  Turks  and three against the  Moors  upon the Borders of  Borneo  When they come to be admitted into their Abbey they are introduced in their Military Habit of which being disrob'd the Religious one is put on  viz  a black Gown reaching down to the Ground lined with blue having a blue Cross fix'd to the Breast and over that a black Cowle they are afterwards led to the Church and there make their  Profession  Philip  VII Son to the Founder enlarg'd their Lands and Privileges and added a Border of  Gold  to the Badge of the  blue Cross  as observed at this Day  IN  Italy France  and  Spain  there are a Sort of Monks that have the Title of Knights of St  Anthony  which observe the Rule of St  Augustin  and they wear a plain Cross like that in  Aethiopia  but the Principals of these wear a double St  Anthony  's Cross of blue Satin the one above the other Their chief Seat is at  Vienne  in  Dauphine  of which Place the General of the Order bears the Title of Abbot the Monastery being erected into an Abbey in Honour of St  Anthony  whose Body was translated thither from  Constantinople  and all other Places built in Honour of his Name were made subject to him  A D    Moroeus  calls them  The Hospitallers of St  Anthony and says they begun in  France A D  from  Gaston  a Nobleman of  Vienna  But  Baronius  and others say  Gaston  and  Gerin  instituted it earlier making the Letter  Thau  their Ensign or Badge    The  Constantinian  Angelick Knights of St  George  in  Greece  but now in  Italy  MARQUEZ a  Spanish  Writer makes this one of the first Military Orders in Christendom and derives a formal Institution Rules and Laws from  Constantine  the Great which appears little better than Fabulous therefore we shall omit his Account  THE Great Masters have their chief Seat and Convent at  Brianno  near  Venice  and is Hereditary in the Family of  Angelus Flavius Comnenus  Among the rest of their Prerogatives the Masters are  Commensales Pontificum  i e may sit at the Table with the Pope who defends them as Benefactors to the Church and Founders of the  Lateran  Cathedral at  Rome  As Subjects to no Prince they have Power of coyning Money They give Titles of Counts and Princes to their own Fraternity and take upon them the restoring to  Honours  of legitimating  Bastands  making  Doctors Poets Laureats  and  Publick Notaries  This Order is under the Protection of  the Virgin  Mary  and Patronage of St  George  and they profess Obedience and conjugal Chastity they wear a white Habit on the left Side whereof is sowed a red or crimson Velvet Cross Flory in the middle is the  Labarum  \s\ imbroidered with the Letter A upon one Arm of the Cross and \s\ on the other The Sides are wrought with Gold and Silk but the  Labarum  is all Gold Amongst these Knights are three Degrees the first call'd Collered or Grand Crosses wearing a Collar form'd of  Labarums  whereat hangs the Cross and St  George  The second are the Knights and these wear the Cross above describ'd The third are Servants and

that of  Alcantara  'tis evident they were in being  A D  when 'tis pretended the Master of  A'cantara  took  Trugillo  from the  Moors  and plac'd there a Brotherhood of Knights But it seems these Knights  of  Truxillo  were a distinct Order several Years before and 'tis not unlikely that they might be incorporated into that of St  Julian de Pereyro  and by this Means the Order of  Alcantara  acquired the Towns of  Trugillo Sancta Cruz  c which  Alfonso  IX King of  Castile  had given them They were to be of Noble Descent and make proof of their Gentility they were obliged to be near the

Knights of the  Annunciade  and St  Michael  the Archangel in  Mantua  or of the Christian Militia in  Moravia  BY these Names they have been promiscuously called It was instituted by  Charles Gonzaga  Duke of  Mantua  and  Nevers  in Conjunction with  Adolph  Count of  Altham  his Brother and  John Baptist Petrignan Sfortia  To give it the greater Lustre they divided the World among them  Charles  took the North and West Parts  Adolph  the Eastern and the other had the South where they were personally to found Convents and invest Knights Duke  Charles  began his Institution of this Order under the Rule of St  Francis  in  Olmutz  the Metropolis of  Moravia  the Year aforesaid and dedicated it to the blessed Virgin and St  Michael  But what Progress the others made in their pious Resolutions History is silent It has been likewise styl'd  Conceptionis Ordo Militis Virginis annunciatae Anno  several illustrious Princes of divers Countries entered themselves into that Order at  Vienna  It was approv'd by Pope  Paul  V and confirm'd by Pope  Paul  VIII The Design of its Institution was to establish Peace and Concord among Christian Princes and their Subjects to release Captives and deliver the Oppressed out of the Hands of the Infidels  On some unhappy Difference among the illustrious Founders in a short time it moulder'd away and became  ineffectual that the Mahometans for whose Destruction it was design'd heard only the Report of it  CAP III  § HAVING particulariz'd the Religious Orders I shall proceed to those accounted absolutely Military Among them    Knights of the  Round Table  may for Antiquity challenge the first Place  The Founder was  Arthur  King of  Britain  crown'd in the Year of our Lord at the Age of Years of whose incredible Courage and Gallantry tho' some have stretch'd too far yet  William  of  Malmsbury  is of Opinion he was worthy to have been celebrated by true and faithful Historians and not false and spurious Tales He it was that long prop'd up his declining Country and inspir'd Martial Courage into his Subjects the  Saxons  in twelve pitch'd Battles having overcome and conquer'd divers Countries He liv'd in so great Repute and Renown that worthy Knights came from all Parts to his Court as a Seminary of Military Discipline to demonstrate their Valour in point of Arms This gave him Occasion to select out of these and his own Subjects some say Twenty Four of the most Valiant which he united in a Fellowship and to avoid all Controversy upon Precedency caus'd a Round Table to be made whence the Order had its Appellation He admitted not only  Britains  but Strangers and their Qualifications were to be Persons of Nobility Dignity and renown'd for Vertue and Valour The Place where they were instituted was  Windsor  and those others of Note where he and his Knights assembled were at  Caerleon  in  Monmouthshir  Winchester  and  Camelot  in  Com' Somerset  and their time of convening was  Whitsuntide  In  Winchester  Castle was  large Round Table call'd and affirm'd to be King  Arthur  's or at least set up in the room of one more ancient which was destroy'd in the rebellious Times of Forty One with other Reliques there The Articles of their Profession Number are set down by Sir  William Segar  We find no authentick Proof what Badge they bore notwithstanding the Report that King  Arthur  had a Shield nam'd  Pridwin  wherein the Virgin  Mary  was depicted His Sword and Lance had also their Names one being call'd  Caliburne  the other  Irone  or  Rone  It's not remember'd that this Order surviv'd the Founder but rather that it expir'd with him most of these Knights perishing with him at the Battle of  Kamblan  now  Camelsford  in  Cornwall  where tho' he kill'd his Enemy  Mordred  yet he dy'd  A D    IT may be noted that the like Round Table grew in Estimation shortly after the  Norman  Conquest being permitted at Haslelades Tilts and Turnaments  temp Steph  and  R  I And  Roger Mortimer  Earl of  March  kept the Celebration of the Round Table consisting of One Hundred Knights and as many Ladies with Tilting at  Kenelworth  Castle in  Com' Worcest'    Ed  I And King  Edward  III designing to restore it held a Just a  Windsor  in the th Year of his Reign and in the th ordain'd it annually to be kept there at  Whitsontide  But it was thought fit upon divers Accounts to forbid these Assemblies and in particular  H  III at  Shrewsbury  when the King went to meet  Llewellin  Prince of  Wales  and in  H  III and at many other times    Knights of the  Oak  in  Navarre  WERE instituted by  Garcia Ximenes  of the Blood of the  Goths  who had formerly retir'd from the World to a solitary Life but relinquish'd it to command an Army rais'd by the  Navarrois  to deliver themselves from the Oppression of the  Moors  As he was marching to encounter them  A D  there appear'd to him from the Top of an Oak the Sign of the Cross ador'd by an infinite Number of Angels On giving Battle to the Infidels he gain'd a remarkable Victory and the People elected him their King and he in thankfulness to God erected this Order investing his Nobles therewith  and oblig'd them to defend the Christian Faith and acknowledge Obedience to his Successors Kings of  Navarre  Time has eclips'd this Order    The Order of the  Gennet  WAS Founded by  Charles Martel  in Memory of the famous Battle near  Tours A D  where he overthrew  Saracens  and  Moors  with their General  Abdiramo  and to reward those who had wellbehav'd themselves in this Action The great Number of rich Gennet Furr Ermine has since gain'd the better value as also the Creatures themselves taken alive among the Spoils was the Occasion of assuming the Name But others impute it to Gennets a kind of neatshap'd Horses whereof not unlikely a great Part of the Founder's Cavalry consisted The Knights were Sixteen in Number and were accounted the first Order of this Nature among the  French  which continu'd till the Institution of the  Star  when it was laid aside tho' some  French  Authors question if ever the Order was in being    The Order of the  CrownFlower  ERECTED by  Charles  the Great Son of King  Pepin A D  to reward the  Frizons  who had behav'd themselves valiantly in his Armies and to encourage others to emulate their Vertue It was so call'd from its Ensign  viz  an Imperial Crown em  roider'd with Gold The Knights were invested with the Military Belt and a Box on the Ear    The Order of the  Dog  and  Cock  THAT there was such an Order in  France  is related by several Writers but they give no certain Account of its Institution    The Order of St  Andrew  or the  Thistle  in  Scotland  Is reported by  John Lesley  Bishop of  Ross  to take beginning from a bright Cross in Heaven in Fashion of that whereon St  Andrew  suffer'd Martyrdom which appear'd to  Hungus  King of the  Picts  and to the  S  ts  whom  Achaius  King of  Scotland  sent to his Assistance the Night preceding the Battle with  Athelstan  King of  England  over whom prevailing they went in Solemn Procession to the Kirk of St  Andrew  to thank God and his Apostle for their Victory promising that they and their Posterity would ever bear the Figure of that Cross in their Ensigns and Banners  Favin  in his  Theatre of Honour  relates it to be instituted upon the famous League Offensive and Defensive made between  Achaius  and  Charl  main  King of  France  to preserve the Memory of which Alliance  Achaius  added the  Tressure of Flowers de Lys  to the Lyon and took for Device the  Thistle  and  Rue  which he compos'd into a Collar of his Order and for his Motto  Pour ma Defence  Yet doth  Menenius  make these the Symbols of two different Orders one of the  Thistle  whence the Knights were so styl'd and the Motto  Nemo me impune lacessit  the other call'd  Sertum Rutae  or  The Garland of Rue  Nevertheless to both these Collars hung one and the same Jewel  viz  the Figure of St  Andrew  bearing his Cross before him  But there are some  faith the same Author  that refer the Institution of the  Thistle the Badge of the  Scotch  Kingdom from the Times of  Achaius to the Reign of  Charles VII  King of  France  when the Amity was renew'd between both Kingdoms  Lastly Others place its Foundation Their principal Ensign is a Gold Collar compos'd of Thistles interlink'd with Anulets of Gold and pendant thereto St  Andrew  with his Cross and this Epigraph  Nemo me impune lac  ssit  Their solemn Meeting was annually on St  Andr  w  's Day in the Church of the Town dedicated to his Name During the Festivity the Knights were richly habited and wore their Parliament Robes having fix'd on their left Shoulders an Azure Round  e charg'd with a Saltire Argent  or St  Andrew  's Cross enfil'd in Centre with a Crown compos'd of  Flower de Luces Or  For the ordinary and common Ensign the Knights us'd a Green Ribbon whereat hung a Thistle of Gold crown'd with an Imperial Crown within a Circle of Gold containing the last nam'd Epigraph and now of late they have sew'd to their left Breast an Irradiation like that of  The Knights of the Garter  over a Saltire Silver the Irradiation charg'd with a Blew Roundle of St  Andrew  's Cross Their Number consisted of Thirteen in Allusion to our blessed Saviour and the Twelve Apostles    Knights of  our Lady of the Star  OWE their

St  Owen  call'd  de Chichey  near St  Denys  in  France  This Order was of no long continuance for being much fully'd and disgrac'd during the Civil and Foreign Wars by the Imitation of Persons that had neither Birth nor Merit to recommend them King  Charles  VII took Occasion to efface it  A D  by delivering up in a Chapter the Ensign that he wore to the Chevalier  du Guet  Captain of the Nightwatch in  Paris  the Lords and Princes throwing it off after it had receiv'd that Mark of Infamy tho' some alledge it declin'd upon the Erection of  The Order of St  Michael as the  Star  supplanted that of the  ennet    The Order of the  Lilly  in  Navarre  or of St  Mary  of the  Lilly  WAS founded  A D  by  Garcius  VI King of  Navarre  in Honour of the blessed Virgin  Mary  after his Recovery from a languishing Sickness Others relate that prevailing against the  Moors  he made a Feast in Honour of the blessed Virgin at which he instituted this Order electing his Brothers and Sons among the first Knights It was esteem'd the most Illustrious of all  Spain  and consist  d of Thirty Eight Knights extracted  out of the ancientest Blood of  Navarre  iscay  and  Old Castile  The Kings of  Navarre  were their Chief They promis'd at their Institution to expose their Lives and Fortunes in Defence of the Christian Faith the Conservation of the Crown and Expulsion of the  Moors    The Order of the  Sword  in  Cyprus  WAS erected by  Guy  of  Lusignan  King of  Jerusalem  and  Cyprus  after he had purchas'd that Isle of our King  Richard  I in Commemoration of so fortunate a Plantation of Persons whom he brought thither Some question the Truth of this however all assent its Founder was one of the  Lusignan  Family The Collar was compos'd of round Cordons of white Silk woven into LoveKnots interlac'd with the Letters S and R Beneath this Collar hung an Oval of Gold whereon was perfigur'd a Sword the Blade enamell'd Silver the Hilt Gold and about the Oval this  Motto Securitas Regni Micheli  says  Pro Fide Servanda  and  Gothofredus pro integritate tuenda  Their Festivity was  AscensionDay  whereon the Founder gave it in the Church of St  Sophia  the Cathedral of  Nicosia  in  Cyprus  to his Brother  Amaury  and to Three Hundred Barons establish'd in that his new Kingdom There were Eight Kings of  Cyprus  of the  Lusignan  Line Great Masters but when this Isle fell into the Hands of the  Turks  this Institution ceas'd    The  Bear  in  Switzerland  WAS instituted  A D  by the Emperor  Frederick  II in Favour of the Abbot of St  Gall  in  Swaben  who had assisted him in gaining the Empire These Knights wore a Collar of Gold at the End whereof hung a Bear Gold mounted on an Hillock enamell'd with Black in Honour of St  Ursus  of the  Theban  Legion who was martyr'd before the Temple of the Sun at  Sol  urre  in  Switz  rland  It was also call'd  The Order of St  Gall from the Name of the Patron a  Scotch  Gentleman and the Apostle of  Swaben  of the Place wher  it receiv'd its Appellation The Abbot whereof for the Time being had Power to confer this Honour which was done by girding with the Military Belt the Sword being first consecrated and putting on the Collar It continu'd 'till the  Switzers  became a CommonWealth and then the Castles of the Nobles being dismantled it was laid aside    The  BroomFlower  in  France  TOOK its Original

Sovereign's Pleasure and this Order continu'd till the Death of King  Charles  V Some say  Charles  VI instituted it and others deny the being of any such Order    The  Ship  and  Double Crescent  in  France  SUCH an Order was of Old in Honour of the great Atchievements of that Nation tho' by whom founded is unknown  Favin  affirms St  Lewis  erected this after he had instituted the  Broom Flower  to animate the Nobility to accompany him in his Expedition to  Africa  Their Badge was alluding to the Name of the Order the Figure of a Ship Pendant in an Oval of Gold and expir'd with St  Lewis  after the first Class of Knights but its Honour was kept up by  Charles  Brother of St  Lewis  and flourish'd in  Sicily  with his Su  cessors until the Kings of  Arragon  obtain'd that Kingdom    Knights of St  James  in  Holland  THIS Order was erected by  Florentius  Earl of  Holland  and  Zeland  and Lord of  Friseland  and he  A D  bestow'd the Ensigns of it in his Palace at the  Hague

Ladeslaus  King of  Poland  to honour the Marriage of his Son  Casimire  the Great with  Anne  Daughter of  Gedimer  Duke of  Lithuania  The Ensign was a white Eagle crown'd    The Order of Knights  de la Banda  in  Castile  WAS set up by  Alphonsus  II King of  Leon  in  Castile  in the City of  Victoria A D  or  Palencia  or  Burgos  according to others not long befo  e  his Coronation the better to secure himself against his Enemies Soon after the Solemnity was celebrated at  Burgos  in the Monastery of St  Mary Royal  where the Candidates conducted by the King to the Altar and depositing their Arms spent the Night in Watching and Prayer The Morrow after Mass they were invested with a red military Belt or Ribbon of four Fingers broad which came across the Body over the right Shoulder and so under the left Arm and was the Ensign from whence they took their Denomination This Order was chiefly to Honour the Nobility and at first none wer  admitted but the younger Sons of Noblemen excluding elder Brothers or Persons welldescended or Esquires who had serv'd in Court or Camp Ten Years at least It was anciently of great Esteem and Kings have vouchsafed to take its Ensign but at length it was disus'd    The Order  de la Calza  INSTITUTED at  Venice A D  from the Example of the  Knights  de la Banda in Honour of the Inauguration of Duke  Michele Steno  It consisted of a Society of particular Noblemen and Gentlemen who voluntarily met together and elected a Chief among themselves They took an Oath to observe their Articles part whereof was the Honour of the City where noble and splendid Regales were made and with such like magnificent Divertisements did they entertain King  Henry  III of  France  and other noble Personages It receiv'd the greater Lustre by the Addition of several  Italian  Princes and the most conspicuous Families were receiv'd into it Their Habit on Solemn Days was a Crimson Senator's Vest appearing very splendid Their Ensign a Sun in a Sheild painted in their Banners It arriv'd to such Profuseness that in it was wholly laid aside    The Order of St  Mark  in  Venice  IS here reckon'd because the Knights are dignify'd with a Title and particular Ensign of Honour at their  Creation The Ceremony is after the Manner of  Knights Batchelors  by Dubbing with a Sword and their Title a bare Mark of Honour having no Laws or Statutes or particular Obligations enjoyn'd It had the Denomination from St  Mark  the Evangelist whose Body was translated to  Venice    and became the Titular Angel and Guardian of that City his Picture being display'd in their Banners The exact Time of its Institution is not certainly determin'd The Badge that adorns these Knights is a Gold Chain put over their Shoulders at their Creation whereat depends a Medal on one side whereof is the Symbol of St  Mark viz  a winged Lyon holding in his right Paw a drawn Sword and in his left an open Book with this Motto  Pax tibi Marce Evangelista meus  On the Reverse th  Duke surviving is beautify'd with a particular Impress Sometimes represented on his Knee receiving a Standard from the Hands of St  Mark  This Medal is worn on a Cross enamell'd Blew The Duke confers this Honour either privately in his Chamber or publickly in a full College The Senate have the Power of creating this Order and they who receive it by their Sanction the Dignity is greater than from the Hands of the Duke himself Absent Persons are invested by Letters Patents and to aggrandize their Honour and Title style themselves  Knights of St  Mark    The Order of the

of  Hungary  warr'd against  Joan  Queen of  Naples  not so much to dispossess her of the Kingdom as to revenge his Brother  Andrew  's Death whom this  Joan  his Wife had strangled On the th of  May  the Queen and  Lewis  Prince of  Tarantuni  being crown'd King and Queen of that Realm on the same Day in Commemoration of so pacifick an Union and to tear up all their Enmities the Prince instituted this Order into which enter'd at that Time Threescore and Ten Lords Their Habit was White and their Ensign a Knot the Emblem of Love and Friendship intermixt with Gold This Order expir'd in a short Time    Knights of the  Annunciade  in  Savoy  Ame  VI Earl of  Savoy  instituted this Order under the Title of  The Collar  in Honour of the Fifteen Divine Mysteries of the  Rosary Favin  on a mistaken Ground calls it  The Order of the Snares of Love  in regard its Founder had receiv'd of his Lady a Bracelet made of the Tresses of her Hair plaited in Loveknots and that the four Letters afterwards interlac'd by the Founder should signifie  Frappes Entres Rompes Tous  It is conspicuous enough at the first Erection it was call'd of  The Collar  and so remain'd till  Charles  III or  Le Bon  Duke of  Savoy  bestow'd on it the Title of  The Annunciation  from the Picture of the Annunciation which he annex'd to  The Collar  The Founder appointed the Number of his Knights to be Fifteen

principal Seat they had a Chartreuse to entertain Fifteen Priests to celebrate Fifteen Masses to the Honour of the Fifteen Joys of the blessed Virgin and to the Soul's Health of  these Knights and

with Three other Knots entwin'd one within another made up the Circumference  pendant  at the Collar without any Figure These old Characters were suppos'd to be the Initials of  Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit  alluding to  Amadeus le Grand  who so valiantly defended  Rhodes  against the  Turks  But that this was long before the Devise of the House of  Savoy  is manifest from the Coins of  Lewis de Savoy  Baron  de Vaud  who dy'd the Monument of  Thomas de Savoy  who dy'd whereon was lying at the Feet of his Portaiture a Dog with a Collar about his Neck inscrib'd  Fert  as an integral Word and from a Brass Coin of the said Earl's on the Reverse whereof are Two Knots of the Model before spoke of and the Word  Fert  in the midst There is the Ectype of a Silver Coin of  Peter de Savoy  who erected in  England  the noble Pile of that Name in the  Strand temp H  III wherein is represented the Devise  Fert  in  Go  hick  Characters the true Interpretation of which Word cannot be explain'd

Flames in embroidery of Gold and Silver and lin'd with Cloth of Silver tissu'd Blue now in use under which instead of the White Taffaty Surcoat is now worn a White Satin Suit embroider'd with Silk the

Daulphine  in  Auvergne  The first Solemnities of this Order were perform'd at  Nostre Dame de Maulins  in  Bourbonnois  where he founded a College of Twelve Canons in Honour of the blessed Virgin the Intent was to corroborate his Interest for the Aid of the Duke of  Orleans  against the Faction of the House of  Burgundy  and by joyning of Flowers  de Lys  and Thistles the Symbols of Hope and Courage emblematically to express the Nobleness of his Spirit against all the Power of Fortune He ordain'd the Number of Knights to be Twenty Six comprehending himself and his Successors Dukes of  Bourbon  as Chiefs and oblig'd them to wear daily a Belt a Girdle of Watchel coloured Velvet lin'd with Crimson Sattin embroider'd with Gold and therein the Word  Esperance  curiously wrought The

to preserve Amity among the Nobles to compo  Enmities and suppress Seditions If any of these Knights upon a Variance refused a Reconciliation the Ensigns were to be forfei  ed Others say the Design was to advance Navigation to which their Ensign alludes being a Ship floating upon the Waters in the midst of a Storm having this Motto  Non credo tempori  In the  Convent of that sumptuous Church which St  Nicholas  Bishop of  Smyrna  erected was the grand Feast held on the Anniversary of that Saint This King appointed a White Habit for the Knights and prescribed them laudable Constitutions

The  Porcupine  in  France  WAS erected by  Lewis  of  France  Duke of  Orleans  to honour the Solemnization of the Baptism of his eldest Son  Charles  by his Wife Daughter to the Duke of  Milain  He chose the Porcupine for his Devise with this Epigraph  Cominus Eminus  not only out of the aspiring Hopes conceived of this Child but also to intimate something of Revenge against  John  Duke of  Burgundy  his mortal Enemy the Porcupine being an Emblem both Offensive and Defensive Others make  Charles  aforesaid the Founder of this Order in Imitation or Emulation of the Golden Fleece instituted by  Philip  Duke of  Burgundy  Their Number including the Founder was Twenty Five their Habit Surcoats of Violet Velvet and over them Mantles of Watchet Velvet lin'd with Carnation Satin

overthrown  in  Hungary  WAS instituted  A D  by the Emperor  Sigismond the Glorious  for the Defence of the Christian Religion and to crush or oppugn all Hereticks and Schismaticks and for the Satisfaction he receiv'd in conferring Peace to the Churches of  Hungary  and  Bohemia  by the Aid of the Council of  Constance  It was in high esteem shortly after in  Germany  but the Order and Founder had very near the same Period The Knights wore daily as their Ensign a  Green Cross flory  on solemn Days a Scarlet Cloak and on the Mantlet of Green Silk a double Chain of Gold others say a Green Ribbon at the End of which hung a Dragon dead with broken Wings in posture of being overcome the Symbol of Heresy enamelled with Variety of Colours    The  Equites Tusini  in  Bohemia  or else both in  Bohemia  and  Austria  THIS Order had its Name From  Toca  a Cap or Coif The Archdukes of  Austria  were its Founders which they enacted to engage their Subjects in Defence of the Christian Faith against  Turks  and  Hereticks  conferring upon the Knights towards their Support whatsoever  they acquired in the Wars which was a respite to themselves after almost Two Hundred Years Charges and Military Expence indeed the Encouragement proved so good a Bait that they cleared their Provinces almost of all  Turks  and  Schismaticks  that infested them Their Badge was a plain  Green Cross  and their Habit Red  Ordo Disciplinarum  WAS instituted by the  Bohemian  Kings or rather the  Austrian  to be a Curb upon the  Turks  and  Hereticks  at least to prescribe the Confines of the Kingdom

Daughter of  Portugal  in the City of  Brug  s  in  Flanders  to perpetuate the Memory of his great Revenues raised by Wools with the  LowCountries  Some say in Commemoration of  Gideon  who with

Guardianship of it to the Kings of  Spain  which he perform'd on the th of  October  conferring it on his Son King  Philip  at  Bruxelles  when he took the Collar from his Neck and with his own Hands put it over his Son's Shoulders in the Presence of divers of the Knights with this Form  Accipe fili mi quem e collo meo detraho tibi praecipuum Aurei velleris torquem quem Philippus Dux Burgundiae

Successors Dukes of  Anjou  and Kings of  Sicily  Chiefs He also chose St  Maurice  Knight and Martyr for Patron and held the first Ceremonies in the Church of  Angiers  dedicated to his Name The Symbol which the Knights wore on the right Side of their Mantle was a Golden Crescent whereon in Red Enamel was this Word  L'oz  signifying  L'oz en Croissant  whereby they were spur'd  forwards to search after the Increase of Valour and Reputation At this  Crescent  was fasten'd as many small Pieces of Gold fashion'd like Columns and enamell'd with Red as the Knights had been engag'd in Battels

Crimson Velvet and a Mantlet of White with the Lining and Surcoat of the same    The Order of the  Ermin  in  Britanny  WAS erected by  Francis  I Duke of  Bretagne  to perpetuate the Memory of his

Mantles of White Damask lin'd with Carnation and the Mantlet of the same The great Collar was of Gold compos'd of Ears of Corn in  Saltire  bound above and beneath with Two Circles of Gold imitating the Crown of  Ceres  denoting the Care of Husbandry and was sometimes called  The Order of the Ears of Corn  At the End of this Collar hung the  Mus Ponticus  or Ermin passing over a Turf of Grass diaper'd with Flowers at the Edge whereof was imboss'd this Epigraph in  French Amaire  the Device of his said Grandfather by which he made known his Courage and rather than fail in the least Punctilio of his Word he would undergo any Misfortune This Order ended when the Dukedom of  Bretagne  became annex'd to the Crown of  France  by the Marriage of  Anne  Dutchess of  Bretagn    to  Charles  VIII and  Lewis  XII both  French  Kings    The Order of the  Ermin  in  Naples  OWES its Institution to  Ferdinand  I King of  Naples  at the Expiration of the War which he was engag'd in with  John  of  Lorain  Duke of  Calabria  being induc'd thereto by the Treason and Confederacy of his  Brotherinlaw  Marinus Marcianus  Duke of  Sessa  who design'd to murder him and transfer the Kingdom to the Duke of  Calabria  But the Plot being defeated instead of bringing him to Justice he not only pardon'd him but instituted this Chevalry admitting therein all the Noblemen of Title and Figure in the Kingdom and generously appointed him one of the first Knights The Collar was of Gold intermix'd with Mud or Dirt to which depended an Ermin and this Motto  Malo mori quam foedari  alluding to the clean Nature of the Animal    The Order of St  Michael  in  Naples  HAD its Original from the same King  Ferdinand  in honour of St  Michael  the ArchAngel Patron of  Apulia  The Habit of the Knights was a long White Mantle embroider'd with Ermins and the Collar of Gold compos'd of the Letter O to which hung in an Oval the Epigraph  Decorum  By the Habit it seems to be the preceding Order if that was dedicated to St  Michael    The Order of St  Michael  in  France  Lewis  XI King of that Realm considering how his Affairs were entangled to reunite the Affections of his Nobility to himself instituted these Knights giving them their Denomination from St  Michael  the ArchAngel the titular Angel and Protector of  France  in Reverence of whom their ancient Kings were wont to solemnize this Feastday with great Magnificence and keep an open Court Their Number at first were to be Thirty Six whereof the King and his Successors were Chief But it afterwards proceeded to Three Hundred The Collar is compos'd of E  callop Shells of Gold joyn'd one with another and doublebanded fasten'd on small Chains of Gold at the End of which is annex'd an Oval of the same and therein on an Hillock is the Figur  of St  Michael  com  aring  nd  ampling down the Dragon The Motto  Immens  mor Oceani  The Habit was a Mantle of White Da  mask hanging down to the Ground furr'd with Ermin

order'd this Mantle to be Cloth of Silver embroider'd with Three  Crescents  of Silver interwoven with Trophies Quivers and  Turkish  Bows  semied  and  canton'd  with Tongues and Flames of Fire the  Chaperons  of Crimson Velvet should have the same Embroidery Their Grand Festival was to be celebrated on  Michaelmasday  at the Church of  Mount Michael  in  Normandy  but after+wards transferr'd to  Bois de Vincennes  near  Paris  There is an Herald of Arms to attend this Order called  Monsieur St  Michael Upon the instituting  The Order of the Ho'y Ghost  not only Care was taken to preserve this of St  Michael  and to rectify it but the Knights had the Privilege allow'd them that if they thought fit they were made capable of receiving that o  The Holy Ghost  which no Stranger or Native could be enroll'd in that had taken upon him any other Order The Collar of St  Michael  may be worn with that of  The Holy Ghost  and it is now frequently us'd The Evening before any receive  The Order of

Princes and Nobl  men Its chief Ensign was the Figure of an Elephant on whose side within a Rundle was a Crown of Thorns with Three Nails all bloody in Memory of the Passion The Knights w  re oblig'd to Acts of Pi  ty  AlmsDeeds and certain Ceremonies especially upon those Days on which they wore the Ensigns King  John  valu'd it so highly that he wore them on every solemn Festival He advanc'd it to that Pitch of Grandeur that our King  Henry  VIII and  James  V King of  Scotland  accepted it  Hertholm  a learned  Dane  in a particular Treatise of this  Elephantine Order  says The Badge was meerly Military anciently given as a Memorial and Incitement to the  Danish  Princes who took upon them the Defence of Christianity against the  Moors  and  Africans  HERETOFORE the Knights wore a Collar of Gold compos'd of castellated Elephants and Crosses something like the  Crosses ancrees Menenius  calls them Spurs at which hung the Picture of the Virgin  Mary  to the Middle holding Christ in her Arms and surrounded with a Glory of Sunbeams But that long since laid aside they now wear only a Blue Ribbon at which hangs an Elephant enamell'd White adorn'd with Five large Diamonds set in the Middle These Elephants in the Reign of King  Christian  IV had in the same Place within a Circle the Letter C and in the Center of it the Figure denoting  Christianus Quartus  THIS Honour is

had restor'd  Mulleasses  King of  Tunis  to his Kingdom to reward those Commanders who had behav'd themselves well in the Victory It was the Day wherein he made his pompous Entry into  Tunis  when clad in  he Coat he usually wore in Battle whereon was embroider  d  a  Burgundian Cross  which Cross he made the Badge and added a Steel striking Sparks of Fire out of a Flint with this Inscription  Barbaria  and for a more ornamental Decoration gave a Collar of Gold whereat hung this Badge    Knights of the  Holy Ghost  WERE instituted by the  French  King  Henry  III to unite his Nobles more firmly in their Obedience to encourage them to persevere in the  Romish  Religion and to illustrate the State of his Nobility It was so call'd by reason he was born on  Whitsunday  elected that Day King of  Poland  and on that Day came to the Crown of  France  It was to consist of One Hundred Knights besides the Sovereign or Great Master which Office is inseparable from the Crown of  France  A long Mantle of Black Velvet turn'd up on the left Side and open'd on the right was also appointed for the Habit being at first embroider'd round with Gold and Silver consisting of Flowers  de Lys  and Knots of Gold between Three sundry Cyphers of Silver and above the Flowers  de Lys  and Knots were thickly powder'd Flames of Fire This great Mantle was garnish'd with a Mantle of Cloth of Silver

Collar worn over the Mantle was at first compos'd of Flowers  de Lys  canton'd or corner'd with Flames of Fire interwoven with Three Cyphers and divers Monograms of Silver one was the Letter  H  and a  Greek Lambda  both double for the King's Name and the Queen's  Lovisa de Lorain  the other Two were reserv'd in the King's own Mind But these Cyphers were taken off the Colour and the Embroidery of the Robes by King  Henry  IV and for a Mark of his Victories Trophies of Arms were interlac'd instead thereof with the Letter  H  crown'd the Initial of his Name whereout arose Flames and Sparks of Fire and for the like Reason the  H  has been chang'd into  L  both by  Lewis  XIII and  XIV At this Collar hung a Cross richly enamell'd in the midst whereon was figur'd a Dove in a flying Posture as descending down from Heaven with full spread Wings And that an Epigraph might not be wanting some have attributed to it this  Duce Auspice  Besides these Ornaments the Knights wear a Black Velvet Cap with a White Plume their Breeches and Doublets are of Cloth of Silver and their Shoes White ty'd with Roses or Knots of Black Velvet The Badges ordain'd to be ordinarily worn are a Cross of Yellow or

elected Knight of this Order    The Order of the  Black Eagle  WAs instituted by  Frederick  King of  Prussia  and Elector of  Brandenburgh  soon after he had the Title of King conferr'd upon him  § In the  WestIndies Montezuma  King of  Mexico  set Knighthood in the highest Splendor ordaining certain military Orders with several Badges and Ensigns The most honourable among the Knights were those that carry'd the Crown of their Hair ty'd with a little Red Ribbon having a rich Plume of Feathers from which did hang Branches and Rolls of Feathers upon their Shoulders They carry'd as many Rolls as they had done gallant Exploits in the Wars and the King himself and his Sons were of this Order which  Purchas  calls  Eagle Knights  THERE was another Order call'd  Of the Lyons and Tygers  These Knights being commonly the most valiant in the Wars always bore with them their Badges and Armories  OTHER Knights there were as  The Grey Knights  not so much respected as the rest They had their Hair cut round about the Ears They made War upon their Enemies with Ensigns like other Knights and were only arm'd to the Girdle while the most Honourable were  CapaPee'd  All Knights might carry Gold and Silver be array'd in rich Cotton have the use of painted and gilt Vessels and wear Shoes but the common People only the earthen sort neither might they carry Shoes nor Attire themselves but in a gross Stuff Every Order had their Lodging assign'd them in the Palace distinguish'd by their proper Ensigns The first was the Lodging of the Prince the second of  Eagles  the third of  Lyons and Tygers  and the fourth of  Grey Knights  THE Province of  Cinaloa  near  New Mexico  created their Knights by giving a Bow and setting them to encounter a Lyon or some other wild Beast  THE  Inguas  or Lords of  Peru  dedicated their Children to Honour by adorning them with  Guarras  or  Ensigns They pierced their Ears whip'd them with Slings  smeared their Faces with Blood in order they should be true Knights to the  Ingua  Those of Royal Extraction before they received the Order of Knighthood abstained Seven Days from all manner of Nutr  ment except a little raw Grain and Water and after being heartned and brisked up again performed some Military Exercises also Racing Wrestling Leaping Shooting Slinging throwing the Dart and Lance c and enduring to be beaten on the Hands and Legs with Wands these being as it were the Tests whether they could endure the Hardships of War or no for if they did not sustain them manfully they were denied Knighthood The Ceremonies being performed by boaring an Hole in the Ears putting on gallant Shoes and wearing of the Breeches which before they were restricted adorning their Heads with Flowers and having the Privilege of an Herb that none but themselves cou'd make use of and lastly giving an Axe into their Hands  Menenius  calls these Knights  Oreiones  from the  Spanish Orejas  flop or lolleared in the  Latin Auriculares  from the Leaf which they bore hanging in their Ears or because they only negotiated Affairs with the Emperor and had his Ear at all times  IN  Japan  there's an Order of Knights called  Mengoras  part of whom are called  Bonzees  living in Fraternities as our Religionists in  Europe  Some of these have the Charge of their Idols and the Service relating to their Temples others follow the Wars They profess Chastity with such Severity that no Woman is allow'd to enter their Cities They govern the Kingdoms they conquer and are so very opulent that some of them possess Duckets  per Annum  and have a publick Armory well stored to make use of upon any Exigence which is maintain'd by a daily Contribution Women have been excluded their Share in this Way of Honour tho' their Courage and Valour have equalized the  Amazons  of old the Example is of the noble Women of  Tortosa  in  Spain  or the  Femme  Cavaliers of the  Torchi Micheli  barely calls them  Chavalleros  or rather  Chavalleras  seeing the  Latins  have had the Words  Equitissae Militissae  to express  Virago's  and  H  roines  DON  Raymond  last Earl of  Barcelona  having in the Year reduced the City of  Tortosa  from the  Moors  on the Thirty First following they laid a fresh Siege to it in hopes to recover it The Inhabitants were at length reduced to great Streights they desired Relief of the Earl but he not being in a Condition to answer their Request they had Thoughts of a Surrender which the Women to prevent put on the Apparel of the Men and by a resolute Salley forced the  Moors  to raise the Siege The Gallantry of the Action the Earl acknowledged by granting them several Privileges and to perpetuate the Memory instituted this Order somewhat like a Military one and none were to be admitted only those brave Women and the Honour to derive to their Descendants and assigned them for a Badge a Thing like a  Fryer's Capouche  sharp at the Top after the Form of a Torch of a Crimson Colour to be worn upon their HeadCloaths that at all publick Meetings the Women should have Precedence of the Men and should be exempted from all Taxes and that all the Apparels and Jewels left by their dead Husbands should be theirs  A more general Ornament of Honour peculiar to the Fair Sex is the  Cordon  which some will have to be an Order or Equivalent thereunto The Institution is attributed to  Anne Britaigne  Wife to  Charles  VIII of  France  who instead of the Military Belt or Collar bestowed a Cordon or Lace on several Ladies admonishing them to live chastly and devoutly always mindful of the Cords and Bonds of our Saviour and to engage them to a greater Esteem of it she surrounded her Escutcheon of Arms with the like Cordon from which Example the Arms of unmarried Ladies and Gentlewomen are usually adorn'd with them  CAP IV Of the Castle Chapel and College of  Windsor  c  HAving dispatch'd the several Orders of Knighthood and trac'd them from their proper Fountains we come now to treat of the most Noble Order of the  Garter  an Order that not only grants Merit and Honourable and Valiant Exploits at Home but what Imperial Heads and Persons fam'd for the Antiquity of their Race or Gallantry of Actions have always esteem'd a further Advancement to their Glory therein to be enroll'd For the better Explanation it will be necessary to begin with the Description of the Castle Chapel and College of  Windsor  The Place claims no greater Antiquity than of the  Saxons  named by them  Windleshore  and as  Cambden  conjectures had the Denomination from the Winding of a Shore thereabouts as did  Wandsworth  in  Surry  heretofore written  Windlesworth  The first authentick Notice is from the Donation which King  Edward the Confessor  made thereof to the Monks of  Westminster  as the Charter expresses it  For the Hope of eternal Reward the Remission of all his Sins the Sins of his Father Mother and all his Ancestors to the Praise of Almighty  c he grants  Wyndleshore  with all its Appurtenances as an Endowment and perpetual Inheritance to the Use of the  Monks  there and at  Westminster  that served GOD Those Monks enjoy'd it not long for King  William the Conqueror  in the first Year of his Reign being greatly  namour'd with the p  easant Situation and Commodiousness of the Place s  tna  e so near the  Thames  and the Wood fit for Game  i  vited  Eadwin  the then Abbor and the  M  nks  to accept in Exchange f  r it  Wokendune  in  Essex  a Mansion called  Ferings  with all its Members and Hamlers together with Fourteen  Sokemen  and their Lands and o  e Fr  hol  er and Three Houses in  Colchester  all in  Essex  n e which it has remained in the Crown  The King being thus possess'd forthwi  h built a Castle upon the Hill which in  Doomsd  y Book  contained  half an Hide of Land and is there noted to be Parcel of the Mannor of  Clivore Clure  This Castle King  Henry  I rebuilt and beautified with great Magnificence and in the Tenth Year of his Reign held his  Whitsontide  there with great State and Splendor Shortly after in a Charter of Peace between King  Stephen  and Duke  Henry  King  Henry  II afterwards this Castle was called  Mola de Windesor  the Fortress of  Windesor  Within this Castle was King  Edward  III born commonly called  Edward  of  Windsor  and was baptized in the old Chapel and so great was his Affection to that Place that he constituted it the Seat of the most noble Order of the  Garter  and to embellish it the more he founded the College of the Chapel of St  George  and much enlarged and beautified the Castle  For this Work he appointed several Surveyors whom he assigned to press Hewers of Stone Carpenters and such other Artificers as were thought useful and necessary as also to provide Stone Timber and all other Materials for them  William de Wyckham  who attained to be Bishop of  Winchester  was one of these Supervisors and had that Place conferr'd on him by Letters Patent  October    Ed  III And a Grant of the same Fee was likewise allowed to  Robert de Bernham  viz One Shilling a Day while he was at  Windsor  Two Shillings when he went elsewhere about that Affair and Three Shillings  per  Week to his Clerk afterwards he was chief Custos and Surveyor of this Castle of the Mannors of Old and New  Windsor  and of other Castles Mannors c belonging to the King to provide Workmen and lo  k after the Repairs and in those Mannors to hold Leets and other Courts Pleas of Trespass and Misdemeanours  About the  th  of  Ed  III it is presumed the most considerable Enlargement of the Castle was made seeing there was then great Store of the ablest Diggers and Masons impress'd by virtue of Writs directed to the  everal Sheriffs with Command under  l  Penalty to send them to  Windsor  the  Sunday  after the Feast of St  George  to work at the King's Charge from whence they were not to depart without  Wyckham  's License Security having been first taken by the Sheriffs and returned into  Chancery London  found Forty  Essex  in conjunction with  Her  ford  Forty  Wilts Leicester  with  Worcester Cambridge  with  Huntington  Forty  Kent Gloucester Somerset  with  Devon  and  Northampton  one with another found also Forty apiece And because divers of these Workmen for Gain and Advantage clandestinely left  Windsor  to the Hindrance of the Work all Persons were forbid to employ or retain them under Forfeiture of all they had and likewise to arrest those that withdrew themselves from the Work and commit them to  Newgate A    Ed  III many of them being swept away by the Pestilence the like Writs were directed to other Sheriffs under a Hundred Pound Penalty to send able Men whereupon the Counties of  York  sent Sixty  Derby  Twenty Four  Salop  Sixty  Hereford  Fifty  Nottingham  Twenty Four  Lancaster  Twenty Four and  Devon  Sixty  A    Ed  III The noble Edifice was ready for Glazing and of Twenty Four of that Occupation impress'd for the King's Service Twelve were to be employed at  Windsor  In this Year and the next a great Proficiency was made and vast Quantities of Stone were amassed dug out of the Quarries of  Wellesfor Newel  and  Carby  and other Places From the th to the d the Building of the Castle was diligently pursued We find no Addition to this august Pile till his th Year and after that Time nothing more during his Reign so that it is supposed this Famous Piece for Magnificence and Str  ngth was then chiefly finished  viz  the Great Hall of St  George  the Lodgings on the East and South side of the Upper Ward the Keep or Tower in the Middle Ward the Chapel of St  George  the Houses for the Custos and the Canons in the Lower Ward with the whole Circumference of the Walls their several Towers and Gates as in the present Posture they remain  IN succeeding Times King  Hen  VII added that stately Fabrick adjoining to the King's Lodgings in the Upper Ward King  Hen  VIII reedified the great Gate at the Entrance into the Lower Ward King  Edw  VI began and Queen  Mary  perfected the Conveying the Water from  BlackmorePark  in  Wingfield  Parish into a Fountain of curious Workmanship erected in the Mid  e Ward which supplied all the Castle Queen  Elizabeth  made a Terrace Work on the North side of the  Castle from whence there is a pleasant Prospect down upon  Eatonbridge  the  Thames  and the adjacent Country King  Charles  I  A D  built the Gate at the East end of the Terrace which leads into the Park And lastly King  Charles  II greatly beautified and repair'd the Fabrick and furnish'd it with a curious Armory and in fine every Thing is so fitly disposed and ordered that they are worthy of the Notice of every nice and curious Traveller  CAMDEN elegantly describes its Situation in Prose in this manner  From an Hill  says he  that rises with a gentle Ascent it enjoyeth a most delightful Prospect round about foreright in the Front it ov  rlooketh a Vale lying out far and wide garnish  d with Corn Fields flourishing with Meadows deck'd with Groves on either side and watered with the most mild and calm River  Thames  Behind it arise Hills every where neither rough nor over high attired as it were with Woods and even dedicated as one would say by Nature to hunting Game  And thus  Denham  's Muse pourtrays it  Windesor the next where Mars with Venus dwells  Beauty with Strength above the Ualley swells  Into my Eye and doth it self present  With such an easy and unforc'd Ascent  That no stupendious Precipice denies  Access no horror turns away our Eyes  But such a Rise as doth at once invite  A Pleasure  and a  everence from our sight  Thy mighty Masters Emblem in whole face  Sat  eekness heightned with Majestick Grace  Such seems thy gentle height made only proud  To be the Basis of that pompous Load  Than which a noblet weight no Mountain bears  But Atlas only that supports the Spheres  This Castle is under the Government of a Constable s  o  call'd in the Reign of King  John  and has bore that Denomination ever since The Office is of great Antiquity Honour and Power but of small Revenue for it is partly Military and Civil as Military he commands the Castle and any Garrison

Court of Record and is Keeper of the Constable's Seal of Office This Officer supplies the Constable's Place as a Judge of the Court of  Common Pleas  from whose Judgment the Appeal is by Writ of Error

Lieutenants at his Pleasure and may imprison any Trespasser in Vert and Venison Convict having a Prison in the Castle for that Purpose named the  Coalhole  He hath the Freedom of using the Sports of

French  Word for Constable in  William the Conqueror  's Reign was  Walter Fitz Other  from whom the Family of the Barons of  Windsor  are descended and the Earls of  Plimouth  bearing the Surname of  Windsor Temp Car  II Prince  Rupert  was Constable  WE come next to the Chapel of St  George  which is situate in the Lower Ward or Court of this Castle and so named by King  Ed    III shortly after he had founded the College mention'd in the next Section he having  pulled down the old Chapel erected there by King  Henry  I and dedicated to King  Edward the Confessor  to raise a more stately Structure in its stead to bring which Marter to Perfection in the th Year of his Reign  John de Spoulee  had the Office of Master of the StoneHewers and had Power to provide Masons and other Artificers to whose Care they were entrusted In  Anno    Ed  I  John de Dorchester  SubConstable of the Castle was appointed to keep a Controul upon all the Provisions bought for the Works of the Chapel as well as on the Payments and all other Affairs relating thereunto To this Fabrick he erected several Houses adjoining for the Custos and Canons to reside in and afterwards King  Hen  IV gave them the void Place in the Castle call'd the  Woodhall  nigh the great Hall for building of Houses and Apartments for the Vicars Clerks and Choristers and the other Ministers assigned for the Service of the Chapel but King  Edw  IV observing the Walls and Foundation of the Chapel sapped and consumed and esteeming the Fabrick not stately or sp  cious enough designed another more noble and excellent in its Room In order to it  Richard Beauchamp  Bishop of  Salisbury  was constituted Master and Surveyor of the Work who had Power from the King to remove all Impediments demolished divers of the Offici  ry Houses and other irregular Piles and decay'd Walls and dug up their Foundations particularly those ancient Buildings on the East side of the Chapel which extended unto the Walls on the North side of the Castle where the Towers  viz C  urey  's Tower and  Le Amenery  's Tower and  B  rney  's Tower were situated as also on the South side of the Chapel unto the Belfry there exclusively the Materials whereof he might bestow upon any Buildings in th  Castle as he thought convenient How well the B  shop discharged this Office appears from the Preamble of his Patent whereby that King conferred o  him the Chancellorship of the  Carter  in which is set forth  That out of meer Love towards the Order he had given himself the Leisure daily to attend the Advancement and Progress of this goodly Fabrick  FROM this Erection of K  Ed  IV arose the elegant and beauteous Structure now standing enlarged in Length  at least an Hundred Fathom tho' it did not arrive to it  s  Perfection until the Reign of King  Henry  VIII together with the Dean and Canons Houses on the North side of the Chapel and those of the Petty Canons raised at the West End in form of a Fetterlock one of King  Edward  the IVth's Badges and so vulgarly call'd  Temp Henry  VII Sir  Reginald Bray  Knight of the  Garter  became a liberal Benefactor finishing the Body of the Chapel and rearing the Middle Chapel on the South thereof which still retains his Name and where his Body lies interred as is manifest by his Arms Badges c cut in Stone and by his last Will  Anno    Hen  VII  John Hylmer  and  William Vertu    Free Masons undertook the Vaulting the Roof of the Choir a curious Piece of Architecture for  l  and finish'd it by  Christmas    Anno    Henry  VIII the Rood Loft and Lanthorn were erected with the Contributions raised by the Knights Companions Near to the East end of this Chapel was a little Fabrick of FreeStone raised by Cardinal  Wolsey  call'd the  Tomb House  in the Middle whereof he designed to erect a Monument for King  Henry  VIII and had almost finished it before he died but this was demolished by command of the  Long Parliament  and all the Copper Figures exceedingly enriched by Art carry'd thence This Place King  Charles  I intended to enlarge for the Interment of his own Royal Body and those of his Successors but those villainous Times drawn on they with much ado afforded him but a mean obscure Place near the first high Place in the Choir of this Chap  l in the same Vault where the Bodies of King  Henry  VIII and his last Queen yet remain  IN this Chapel besides many of the Knights Companions repose the Body of King  Hen  VI removed from  Cher  sey  Abbey in  Surrey  deposited under the Uppermost Arch at the South side of the Altar without any Monument or Inscription and likewise that of King  Edw  IV under a large Stone of Tuch raised within the opposite Arch at the North side of the Altar but without Inscription having on the outside of his Grave a Range of Steel gilt to inclose it from the North Isles cut excellent well in Churchwork  OVER this Arch hung this King's Coat of Mail cover'd over with Crimson Velvet and thereon the Arms of  England  and  France  quarter'd and richly embroider'd with Pearl and Gold interwoven with divers Rubies which Trophy had remain'd over his Monument ever since his Interment till plunder'd by Captain  Fogg  who at the same time sacrilegiously robb'd the Chapel of all its AltarPlate  WITHIN this Chapel were several Chantries endow'd with Lands and other Revenues for Chaplains and Priests to sing Masses for the Souls of their Founder's Kindred  William  of  Wickham  Bishop of  Winchester  in  Hen  IV gave Two Hundred Marks to the Dean and Chapter to buy Twenty Marks  per Annum  to maintain one Chaplain    Ed  IV The Feoffees of  Richard  Duke of  Gloc  ster  gave the Mannors of  Bentfieldbury  in  Essex Knapton  in  Norfolk  and  Chetlesworth  in  Suffolk  for a daily Mass    Ed  IV Sir  Thomas St Leger  founded a Chantry of Two Priests who were to officiate in the middle Chapel on the North Side of the Church and the said King by his Will ordain'd Two Priests to serve at his Tomb with an Exhibition of Twenty Marks yearly apiece    Hen  VII There was another Chantry Priest assign'd for  Thomas Pasche  and  William Hermer  c who was to perform his Office at the Altar on the North Side the new Church    Hen  VII  Margaret  Countess of  Richmond  founded a Chantry for Four Chaplains to celebrate Mass in the East Part of the new Work of the Chapel    Hen  VII  William  Lord  Hastings  founded a Chantry for One Priest on the North Side of the Choir about the middle whereof this Lord lies    Hen  VII  Charles Somerset  Lord  Herbert  afterwards Earl of  Worcester  left a Secular Priest for a daily Mass c to be said in the South Chapel dedicated to the Virgin  Mary  where he lies inter  'd Both these Lords have built Appartments adjoyning for their Chantry Priests now to be seen and distinguish'd by  their Arms garter'd and cut in Stone over their several Doors  To these we shall add the Foundation of the new Commons erected over against the North Door of the Body of St  George  's Chapel by  James Denton  one of the Canons  Anno    Hen  VIII for the Lodging and Dieting such of the Chantry Priests Choristers and stipendiary Priests who had before no certain Place where to hold Commons in which he furnish'd with all proper Utensils the Charge amounting to l  s    d  in lieu of which the Choristers were to say certain Prayers when they enter'd the Chapel commemorate his Death and pray for his and the Souls of all the Faithful departed  IN this Chapel of St  George  there were heretofore several Anniversaries or Obits held and celebrated which we pass over And as it was usual for some of the military Profession to spend the Remains of their Lives in pious Speculations for their King and Country and the Salvation of their own Souls Permission was allow'd to the welldispos'd  Knights of the Garter  who retir'd from the Noise and Bustle of the World to make their Abode there yet so as to maintain themselves out of their own Revenues King  Henry  VIII ordain'd that the Sovereign should assign them convenient Appartments within the Castle and the like Favour he granted to other Knights tho' not of the Order but the Lodgings to be such as the Sovereign and Knights Companions should decree However we do not find the Knights Companions made use of the Benefit but only for their better Accommodation at the grand Feast of the Order c A Motion was made  Car  I that they might have Lodgings assign'd them in the great Court which they offer'd to repair at their own Charge since all the Officers had Conveniencies in the Castle but the Knights Companions none which the King did not dissent to provided it be without Exclusion of the great Officers of State  § WITHIN the Chapel of the Castle erected by King  Henry  I was founded a College for Eight Canons to be maintain'd by an annual Pension out of the Exchequer King  Edw  II founded here a Chantry for  Four Chaplains and Two Clerks as likewise a Chapel in the Park of  Windsor  under the same Regulation for Four more Chaplains whom King  Edw  III remov'd and joyn'd to those before settled in the Chapel of the Castle and built Habitations for their better Accommodation on the South Side thereof  THE Foundation we treated of here was confirm'd by Letters Patent dated at  Westminster Aug    Edw  III three Quarters of a Year before he erected  The Order of the Garter  when he laid the Foundation of the ancient Chapel afresh in honour of God the Virgin  Mary  St  George  and St  Edward the Confessor  and ordain'd that to King  Henry  's Eight Canons there should be annex'd One Custos Fifteen more Canons and Twenty Four AlmsKnights together with other Ministers all under the Power of the Custos and these to be supported out of the Revenues wherewith this Chapel should be endow'd Upon which Pope  Clement  VI by his Bull directed to the Archbishop of  Canterbury  and Bishop of  Winchester  approved in part the King's Intention  THE next Year the Statutes and Ordinances of the College commenc'd by Virtue of the Pope's Authority  the King's Command and Consent of the Bishop of  Salisbury  in whose Diocess the Chapel is situate By which Statutes  Winchester  one of the Pope's Delegates instituted a College within the Precincts of the Chapel of St  George  consisting of one Custos Twelve Secular Canons Thirteen Priests or Vicars Four Clerks Six Choristers and Twenty Six AlmsKnights besides other Officers  DEAN  § THE first Custos was  John de la Chambre  constituted  Nov    Edw  III to whom succeeded  William Mugg  on the th of  June  following Which  Mugg  is the first if the Institution of the College bears Date by Papal and not Kingly Authority After him were others that were call'd by the same Title till the last Year of King  Henry  IV when  Thomas Kingston  was presented by the Name of Dean and his Successor  John Arundel  observing divers Endowments granted to the  College alternately by the Name of Custos Dean and Custos or lastly of Dean only and doubting this Variation of Titles in Time might bring Inconveniences upon the Foundation petition'd the Parliament  Hen  VI whereupon the King by Letters Patent under the Great Seal granted that the said  John  should be  Custos sive Decanus  for Life and his Successors  Cusiodes sive Decani  Wardens or Deans of the Free Chapel of St  George  within the Castle of  Windsor  and that the Custos or Dean and Canons thereof and their Successors by that Appellation should have and hold to them and their Successors for ever all Lands Tenements c Liberties c devolv'd upon the College at any Time before So that here was a kind of new Incorporation by the Title of Custos or Deans and Canons only at least this was a great Step to compleat the Privilege they after enjoy'd when thro' the Interest of  Richard Beauchamp  Bishop of  Salisbury  then also Dean of  Windsor  and Chancellor of the Order King  Edw  IV by Letters Patent dated  Dec  in the th Year of his Reign model'd them by the Name of Dean and Canons of the Free Chapel of St  George  within the Castle of  Windsor  one Body corporate in Thing and Name with a perpetual Succession and capable in Law to purchase receive and take Lands c in Fee and Perpetuity to have a common Seal and might plead and be impleaded by that Name and for better Security the Letters Patent of Incorporation were within Three Years after pass'd into an Act of Parliament now in force  THE Authority of the Custos or Dean consists in being President over the rest of the College to govern direct and order them their Goods and Estates He has all manner of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over them with a Reservation of Power of Appeal to the Chancellor of  England  who is Visitor of that College  WHEN any Persons lead Lives inordinate he with the Chapter in Cases where no particular Penalty is appointed may reprehend or correct at Discretion and in Matters of Discord shall within Eight Days reconcile the contending Parties or do Justice After thrice Admonition may expel from the College all  Sowers of Discord Backbiters and Whisperers that are below the Degree of a Canon And that there be no defect of Government when the Dean has Occasion to be absent above Eight Days he shall appoint One of the Canon Residents for his Deputy in whose absence he has the Title of Lieutenant and on all Occasions to exercise his Office for the Statutes allow him Sixty Days in a Year for Nonresidence which space the Royal Visitation enlarg'd to One Hundred and Ten Days and the Lord Chancellor  Hyde  granted him Liberty of Six Weeks absence But in the Vacancy of the Custos the Chapter has all his Power conferr'd on them which Chapter ought within Two Days after the Vacancy made known elect one of the Resident Canons under the Title of President to govern the College until they be provided of another Custos  CANONS  THE Canons by the Letters Patent of the first Erection were appointed to be Twenty Four including the Custos but upon the Institution of the College by the Bishop of  Winton  there was ordain'd as aforenoted One Custos Twelve Secular Canons and Thirteen Priests or Vicars in all Twenty Six compleatly the Number of  The Knights of the Garter  And for a fuller Distinction between these Canons Secular and the Priests the first Twelve are in a Bull of Pope  Innocent  VIII nam'd  Majores Canonici  the others  Minores  or PettyCanons To these Twelve Seculars were assign'd so many Prebendships in the Chapel of St  George  as also Stalls in the Choir and Place in the Chapter together with that held by the Custos whence they are frequently styl'd Prebends and have a sacerdotal Power for if they are not in full Orders before they are instal'd they must within a Year after they have enjoy'd their Prebendship be ordain'd a Priest or quit the Benefice  BY the Bull of Pope  Cl  ment  VI the Right of presenting the Canons Priests Clerks Alms Knights and other Ministers were reserv'd to the Founder and his Successors yet we find the first Canons were presented to the Custos by the Founders of  The Order of the Garter  viz  the Twenty Five first Knights Companions every one presenting singularly yet this was but with the Sovereign's Permission  Pro hac vice  and that none of them should be entitled to it hereafter but the Sovereign alone And because it might the more effectually be observ'd the Custos was oblig'd upon every Canon's Death to signify the same to the Sovereign that he might pitch on One to succeed which being nominated he is approved instituted and instal'd by the Custos or Dean to whom he swears Canonical Obedience and Observance of the Statutes  THE principal Duty of these Canons and of all the other Ministers of the College is continually to attend upon the Service of God in the Chapel of St  George  and the Statutes run upon each Day's Omission of a Canon Resident to be mulcted his  quotidian  Distribution  d  And tho' we find no License of NonResidence granted them by their Founder yet there is mention of Canons Resident and NonResident for whom great Defalcations are appointed to be made to prevent such Neglects because the residentiary Canons bear not only the Burden of that Duty belonging to the Chapel but the Expence of Hospitality and other Works of Charity occasion'd from their residing at  Windsor  Richard Beauchamp  Bishop of  Salisbury  obtain'd Power from  Sextus  IV to make new Statutes and dispens'd with the old Ones and in he gave to the Dean and every Canon Fourteen Days of NonResidence in every Term to wit Fifty Six Days in the Year By the Visitation they obtain'd a Dispensation for Eighty Days and the Lord Chancellor  Hatton  yet gave them a further Permission to Two Hundred and Two Days which the Lord Chancellor  Hyde  confirm'd so that there remains One Hundred and Sixty Three Days in the Year in which the Canons ought to be resident with Hospitality to be consonant to their Statutes  THE Canons are particularly oblig'd to pray for the Sovereign and for the happy Estate of the Order If any Knight Companion or other Person should bestow Ten Pounds  per Annum  in order to be Partaker of the Prayers appointed for the Benefactors of the  College his Name was to be inscribed amongst them and he also prayed for Which Article tho' King  Hen  V confirmed yet with this Restriction it should not be admitted without the Consent of the Sovereign or the KnightsCompanions of the Order  Edw  VI some one of them were enjoyned to commemorate the Benefactors in a Discourse upon the  Tuesday  next after the third  Sunday  in  Lent  and on the first  Tusedays  in  June September  and  December  and not only to set forth the Munificence of the Founder and of King  Hen  VIII but of all others so as to excite their Auditors to an Emulation in the Increase of Religion and setting forth of God's Glory  THE civil Obligations of these Canons are to attend the Sovereign or his Deputy and the Knights Companions at their grand Feast and at the Feasts of the Installation or when the Sovereign or Knights Companions shall come to the Chapel of St  George  upon a Religious Account On those solemn Days over their Ecclessastical Habit they wear a Murrey Mantle at this Day a Taffaty Robe in Fashion like the three inferior Officers of the Order with the Arms of St  George  arched within a Rundle on the Right Shoulder  PETTY CANONS  Those now call'd Petty Canons in the Patent of Foundation went undistinguish'd with the  Canones Majores  only in the Bull of Pope  Clement  VI to the Archbishop of  Canterbury  and Bishop of  Winton  for instituting the College they are called  Presbyteri  and by the said Bishop in the very Words of his Statutes  Presbyteri se  Vicarii  by which last Name they are styl'd at the first Erection of the Garter Their Number was originally Thirteen only King  Henry  the VIIIth's  English  Statutes mention Eight petty Canons besi  es Thirteen Vicars but the  Latin  takes Notice only of Thirteen Priests some called  Canonici Minores  others  Vicarii Ann    Edw  VI Twelve Priests were ap  ointed and named Petty Canons that is Four to be added to the Eight mention'd in the Statute of King  Henry  VIII Yet in Queen  Elizabeth  's Ordinances for the continual Charge the Petty Canons thereby provided for are  Thirteen agreeable to the ancient Number of Vicars  but at this Day they are reduced to Seven and one of them Subchanter  The Vicars at their Admission are bound to be Priests at least Deacons and at the next Ordination they must commence Priests Their Statutes oblige them to continual Residence and if absent from Matins or from the grand Mass they are amerced  d  and for every Canonical Hour the Mass of the Virgin  Mary  or for the Defunct a Penny All which Forfeitures were to be deducted out of their Sallary and divided among those Vicars that duly attend these Duties But the Statutes  Edw  VI state the Forfeit of Absence from Matins to be one Halfpenny and the like from Procession Communion or EvenSong to be paid to the Poor's Box And not only they but all other Ministers of the Chapel if they leave the College above Twenty Days without Reasons sufficiently approved of by the Residentiary Canons or any of the Society that lead a vicious or scandalous Life after the Fact manifestly proved before the  Custos  are to be expelled but an Absence less than Twenty Days without Leave granted is punishable at Discretion  Each Vicar enjoy'd at first an annual Pension of  l  paid after this Manner  viz  every Kalendar Month  s  for their Diet and at the Expiration of every Quarter Day the Surplus was consign'd for other Necessaries they stood in need of King  Ed  IV encreased their Pensions to Twenty Marks apiece to which Queen  Elizabeth  they being then called Petty Canons advanced  s  and  d per Annum  to each out of the Lands confirm'd on the College by King  Ed  VI and now their yearly Sallaries are encreas'd to Thirty Pounds Out of these Petty Canons is elected a Subchanter and commonly the same Person is the Dean's Vicar who has the Cure of Souls marries and buries c  CLERKS  For the Service of the Choir at the Foundation were allotted Four Clerks one whereof was to be instituted a Deacon and another a Subdeacon before their Admission  and these two were design'd upon Vacancy to the Vicars Places But for the other Two Institution into lesser Orders in which they were to continue were sufficient Each of the Two first sort had Eight Marks  per Ann  and the other Two but Six King  Ed  IV encreas'd their Number to Thirteen and allow'd them  l per Ann  They are mention'd to be Thirteen in  Hen  VIII's Statutes  Ed  VI they were encreas'd to Fifteen but here appointed to be Laymen wearing Surplices in the Choir each having the same Allowance  Ed  VI a Model was proposed to augment the Number of these Fifteen Clerks to Twenty But in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  they were again reduced to Thirteen as at this present they remain one of them as Organist hath a double Clerk's Place and consequently reckon'd for Two and an Augmentation to each of  l    s    d  three Farthings yearly which being at first opposed by the Dean and Prebends they at length  Eliz  consented to allow them  s per Ann  apiece not out of the new Lands but out of other Payments which the Dean and Chapter should otherwise receive and they encreased their annual Pensions to  l  apiece They are obliged to be present in the Choir at Divine Service as well as the Petty Canons and under the same Forfeitures nor may they or the Petty Canons go out of Town above Three at once left the Choir should be left unprovided  CHOIRISTERS  For the Service of the Choir were appointed Six Choiristers and they to be of the Clerical Order at their Admission to each of which was allow'd Five Marks  per Ann  And as the D  acon and Subdeacon were plac'd in the College only in Addition to the Vicars and design'd to succeed them in their Vacancies so also were there Six secular Children endued with clear tun  able Voices to succeed the Choiristers when they perceiv'd a Roughness or Alteration in their Voices King  Ed  IV encreas'd the Number of Choiristers to Thirteen and allow'd them annually Six Marks apiece and which was again confirm'd by King  H  VIII's  Statutes Yet the Injunction of  Ed  VI reduced them to Ten but Queen  Elizabeth  establish'd the former Number and gave in Augmentation among them all of  l    s    d  They are now reduced to Eight and their present Exhibition is  s per  Month  § The Alms Knights we shall treat of in a threefold Estate Under the Foundation When disjointed thence by Act of Parliament and As established anew by Queen  Elizabeth  THEN King  Edward  III out of the great Regard he had to military Honour and those who had bravely behav'd themselves in his Wars yet after chanced to fall in decay made a Provision for their Relief and comfortable Subsistence in old Age by providing for them in this his Foundation and making a Coalition in one joint Body with the Custos and Canons these he call'd  Milites Pauperes  and we Poor or AlmsKnights The stated Number at first were Twenty Four equal to the Custos and Canons at the first Erection But shortly after upon his instituting the Order of the  Garter  Two more were added as there was to the first Canons to make the compleat Number of the KnightsCompanions of that Order which were Twenty Six as we find stated at the Ordination of the College by the Bishop of  Winchester  the Pope's Delegate  THE Intention of the Founder was for those that were real Objects of Charity as he describes them  viz  poor Knights infirm in Body indigent and decay'd or as the Statutes of the  Garter  qualifies them such as thro' adverse Turns of Fortune were reduced to that Extremity that they had not wherewithal to sustain themselves to live so genteelly as was suitable for a Military Condition which for greater Caution was reiterated in the Statutes of King  Hen  V King  Hen  VIII and in the Orders of Queen  Elizabeth  for it was express'd in case any Estate of  l per Annum  devolved on them such Knights were to be discharged the College and they were to proceed to a new Election  AT the first each KnightCompanion of the Order presented his AlmsKnight but ever after their Election was to be at the Disposal of the Sovereign Their Habit  was a Red Mantle with the Escutcheon of St  George  without any Garter to surround it Their Exhibition after their first Election was  d  apiece every Day they were at Service in the Chapel or resident in the College besides  s per Annum  for other Contingencies it being the stated Allowance appointed to each of the Canons Residents  ABOUT the Beginning of King  Hen  VI's Reign their  quotidian  Distributions and Annual  s  had been unpaid upon the Account of some Dissentions risen between them and the Dean and Canons but upon Complaint of  John  Bishop of  York  Lord Chancellor of  England  and Visitor of the College  Hen  VI they were redressed and their Arrears of both discharged without any Deduction and likewise obtained this Clause That if the Treasurer of the College became negligent in future Payments he should lose his own  Quotidians  from the Time of his voluntary Omission and the same to be divided among the AlmsKnights Their Duty was to pray for the Sovereign and the Knights Companions to be every Day present at High Mass the Masses of the Virgin  Mary  at Vespers and Compline and in default to be mulcted their  d toties quoties  which was to be converted to the Use of the other AlmsKnights then residing in the Castle of  Windsor  notwithstanding which Decree the Dean did afterwards break in upon them and disposed of these Forfeitures at his Pleasure till  Rich  II  Adam  Bishop of St  David  's then Chancellor of  England  and Visitor of the College redress'd it and another Complaint of like Nature being made of the Deans disposing of Donations and other Liberalities of the Knights Companions in wrong of the AlmsKnights this Chancellor decreed an equal Distribution between the AlmsKnights and Canons till the King and Council should otherwise determine  These and other Differences between the Dean and Canons and Alms Knights grew up to that height that they became irreconcileable insomuch as in the Act of Parliament  Edw  IV for incorporating of the Custos and Canons by the Name of Dean and Canons the AlmsKnights were not only omitted but this Clause inserted  That the Dean and Canons and their Successors  should for ever more be utterly quit and discharged from all manner of Exhibition or Charge of or for any of the said Knights  And this under the Cover That the King has greatly augmented the Number of the Ministers of the Chapel that the Revenue was insufficient to maintain both them and the AlmsKnights but in the Dean and Canons Answer to the Knights Petition to repeal this Act the Cause is alledged For that some of these Knights used their utmost Endeavours before this Act to incorporate themselves and to be exempt from the Obedience and Rule of the Dean and Canons  AFTER this Act which struck off their Quotidian Portions and Fees assigned by King  Edward  's Foundation how the Alms Knights subsisted we find not but so soon as King  Hen  VII came to the Crown they petitioned the King and Parliament for Repeal of the Act  Edw  IV and alledged it was obtained without their Knowledge or being called thereunto which Plea availed not at all but on the contrary the Dean and Canons some Years after got an Exemplification thereof under the great Seal dated  Feb    Hen  VII  AND it is very evident from King  Hen  VIII's Letter to the College that what they did in this Nature after this Act commenced was merely upon Courtesie for he returns them Thanks for a Pension of Twenty Marks conferred upon  Peter Narbone  whom he had recommended to an AlmsKnights Place and Promises to burthen them no more with Requests of this sort but that he would settle Lands for their Maintenance So great was their Caution  Narbone  was by Covenants indented between him and the Dean and Canons to relinquish his Pension upon that King's settling Lands on the College for the Provision of such Knights In the Interval between the Disunion of the College and AlmsKnights to their Establishment by Queen  Elizabeth  their Habit and Badge continued the same and was so confirmed by  Hen  VIII's Statutes It may be collected by his last Will there was an Intention to draw the  about the Escutcheon of St  George  which Projection came to nothing and expired In this Interval it is observ'd that several Persons of considerable Rank and Distinction became Alms  Knights some of which  were rendred great Objects of Charity among which Number was Sir  Robert Champlayne  a valiant Knight an Honour to our Nation for his renowned and martial Serv  ces abroad He was of King  Henry  VI's Party in the Civil Wars against King  Edw  IV Immediately after whose coming to the Crown he left  England  and travelled into  Hungary  with an Equipage of Three Servants and Four Horses where in the Assistance of  Mathou  Corvinius  King of  Hungary  against the  Turks  he behaved himself very gallantly but prosperous Fortune not always attending him with Success he receiv'd many Wounds and at length was taken Prisoner lost all and forced to pay Ducats for his Ransom for the Attestation of which he had the Great Seals of the King of  Hungary  the Archbishop of  Crete  Legate  de Latere  in  Hungary  the Emperor of  Germany  the King of  Sicily  the Count  Palatine  of the  Rhin    and the Duke of  Burgundy  and lastly a Declaration thereof under the Privy Seal of King  Edw  IV And being reduced to so low an Ebb of Fortun  he was thro'  Hen  VII's Favour admitted an AlmsKnight  But some obtained Admittance probably out of Devotion rather than Poverty as  Thomas Hulme Claren  ux  King of Arms  Temp Edw  IV  Lodowick Carly  the King's Physician and  John Mewtes  Secretary of the  French  Ton  ue both  Temp Hen  VII and  Bartholomew Westhy  made second Baron of the  Exchequer    Hen  VIII  IT is evident King  Hen  VIII designed a R  establishment of half the ancient Number of AlmsKnights  viz  Thirteen for which purpose he appointed by his Will  l per Annum  in Mannors Lands and Spiritual Promotions settled upon the Dean and Canons and their Successors for ever upon the Proviso's that they should find Two Priests to say Mass at his Tomb to commemorate yearly Four Obits for him and at every Obit distribute  l  in Alms likewise to pay  d  a Week to those Thirteen AlmsKnights who were to have once a Year a long Gown of White Cloth and a Mantle of Red b  sides Five Marks annually to such one among them as should be constituted their Governor and so much for a Sermon every  Sunday  throughout  the Year In Performance of which Will King  Edw  VI in the first Year of his Reign did confer several Lands upon the College but  l per Annum  of these Rents were by the Dean and Canons paid back to be employed on erecting of Houses for the AlmsKnights intended to be settled by King  Hen  VIII This Work began not till the d and th of  Philip  and  Mary  and was finished the th and th of their Reign the Charge amounting to  l    s    d  These Houses are situate on the South side of the Lower Ward of the Castle and contain Thirteen Rooms besides an Hall a Kitchin and a Pastry the Stone was brought from  Reading  the Timber from the Forest and the Lead and Apparels for the Chimnies from  Suffolk Place  in  Southwark  At a Chapter of the  Garter  held the st of  June  the th and th of  Philip  and  Mary  the Houses being then near finished a Debate arose about placing some AlmsKnights therein if possible by  M  chaelmas  following whereupon the Marquiss of  Winton  LordTreasurer had Orders to assign Lands for their Maintenance and towards the compleating of this the Queen had nominated Nine of the Thirteen designed but falling sick in  August  a stop was put to the Affair till Queen  Elizabeth  coming to the Crown confirmed her Sister's Grants to the Nine nominated Knights and made up the Number full Thirteen ordained by King  Henry  VIII under which Establishment they still remain for afterwards  viz Aug  in the first Year of her Reign minding the Continuance of King  Edward  's Foundation the Intent of her Progenitors and Advancement of the Order of the  Garter  and King  Henry  VIII's Will for the Support of Thirteen poor Men decayed in Wars to be called Thirteen Knights of  Windsor  and having erected certain Orders for their better Regulation and declar'd how and in what manner the  l  given by her Father should be employ'd for the Maintenance of these Knights and their Successors she lastly decl  red That the Dean and Canons should for ever cause these Rules and Orders to be observed  Impr  That there be Thirteen Poor Knights all Gentlemen one whereof to be Governour that have spent their Time in the Wars or other Service of the Realm  having little or nothing to live upon to be elected by the Sovereign and Successors    It  The Governour and Knights must be unmarried yet that the Crown may dispence withal and upon their marrying are to lose their Place    It  None deformed and convicted of Heresie Felony or any notable Crime is to be admitted of the Thirteen and after admittance so convicted to be expelled    It  Each Knight to have yearly for their Liveries a Red Gown of Four Yards and a Mantle of Blue or Purple of Five Yards at  s  and  d per  Yard    It  An Escutcheon of St  George  embroidered without the  Garter  to be upon the Left Shoulder of the Mantle    It  The Charges of the Cloth Lining Making and Embroidering to be paid by the Dean and Chapter out of the Revenue of the Foundation    It  That the Knights attend Morning and Afternoon Divine Service within the College in their ordinary Apparel without a reasonable Let to be allowed by the Governour    It  That they keep their Lodgings appointed and Table in a common Hall appointed and to have their Provisions by a c mmon Purse except for a reasonable Cause any be licensed to the contrary by the Dean and that License not to endure above Twenty Days in a Year excepting only for Sickness    It  They are not to haunt the Town nor Publick Houses nor call any Woman into their Lodgings without reasonable Cause and License of the Dean    It  Twelve of them to be obedient to him appointed to be Governour and all Thirteen to the D  an and Chapter in the Observation of these Statutes    It  The Thirteen Knights to have Places within the Church where the Dean and Canons shall think best to hear the Divine Service together    It

Car  I Five more were added Two of the Foundation of Sir  Peter la Maire  Knight and Three of Sir  Francis Crane  Knight Chancellor of the Garter for Sir  Peter  by his last Will dated  Jan  bequeath'd  l  to charitable Uses to be dispos'd as Sir  Francis  who had marry'd his Sister should think  it within Four Years after his Death whereupon Sir  Francis  determining to er  ct certain Houses in  Windsor  Castle for the dwelling of Five AlmsKnights design'd the said  l  towards that Use and what was deficient made up at his own Cost charging his Brother Executor Sir  Richard Crane  by his Will dated  Aug  to see the Pile which  he had began finish'd Sir  Francis  also bequeath'd  l per Annum  to be settled in Lands by his E  ecu ors for the perpetual Maintenance of Five AlmsKnights after the rate of  l per Ann  m  to every one of them but his Executor growing slack in the Performance the Work being rather expos'd to Ruin than forwarded by him upon Complaints made to the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions in Chapter Orders were islu'd out to quicken him and a peremptory Letter dated  Mar  to go on with the Work faithfully which Commands he evading and bad Times coming on the Building was totally negiected Sir  Rich  rd Crane  afterwards dying by his Will dated  Sept  he appointed that his Mannor of  Carbrooke  in  Norfolk  should stand bound for ever for Payment of the said  l per Annum  whereupon by Inquisition taken at  Wi  dsor Mar  by Virtue of a Commission upon the Statute  Anno    Eliz  for charitable Uses the Mannors of  Woodrising  and  Wesfield  c in  Norfolk  were found liable to satisfie for building and finishing the said Five Houses and payment of the  l  yearly and further that the Arrears thereof from Sir  Fran  s Crane  's Death came at that time to  l  some Contest ensu'd in  Chancery  nevertheless the  l per Annum  was  Ju  y  decreed to be paid out of all the Lands which were Sir  Richard  's and the building of the Houses out of his personal Estate At Two Years Expiration arose that fair Pile of Building between the Chancellor's and Garter's Towers against the West Wall in the lower Ward of the Castle which was begun again and finish'd the next Year the Expences amounting to  l  But for a final End of this Suit it was decreed  Jan  the Mannor of  Carbrooke  should stand charg'd with  l per Annum  payable halfyearly at  Michaelmas  and  Ladyday  or within Thirty Days after for the Maintenance of Five Alms Knights together with  l  yearly for Repairs payable also then which annual Sum of  l Anno    Ca    II in a Chapter held at  Whitehall Jan  the King decreed the Chancellor of the Order for the Time being should receive and dispose thereof thus  l per Annum  among the Five new AlmsKnights quarterly at  the Four usual Feasts of the Year and to employ the residue upon Repair of the new Buildings erected for their Lodgings which Powers were inserted in the Patent for his Office bearing date the th of the same Month And it was moreover decreed that these Five Knights should be subject to the same Rules and Government of the Thirteen of Queen  Elizabeth  's Foundation and made equal Partakers of the same Privileges and wear the like Habits  KING  Charles  I taking into Consideration the Donation of Sir  Francis Crane  which made the AlmsKnights Eighteen tho' they were not yet settled intended to make up Twenty Six as they were at the Institution of the Order to compleat which Design a Chapter was held at  Whitehall Apr  for the KnightsCompanions to consider the best Way how the same might be effected and report their Opinions but nothing was done thereupon and this Affair waits a more propitious Opportunity  § THE other Ministers of the College and Chapel of St  George  call'd  Ministers  in the Foundation Patent are the superior Officers  viz  The Chantor Steward and Treasurer  THE Chantor is elected from among the Canons whose Office is chiefly to govern those that sing in the Choir and such as are employ'd about Divine Service Before the Reformation he appointed who should begin the Antiphones celebrate Masses and read the Lessons Epistles and Gospels To his Care was

There is one Treasurer to receive the Rents of the old Lands and another chosen from the Canons to receive the new who have been allow'd the like annual Pensions The former is term'd  Seneschallus

The Under Stewardship and Chapter Clerkship heretofore were enjoy'd by one Person but of late they are divided and now he must be a Barrester at Law  OF the Virgers Institution the Statutes of the College make mention that in Procession and other Solemnities they were to go before the Dean and Canons bearing their Rods for which Service they were to have annually a Robe and  d per Diem  And besides these there are Two Sextons Two Bellringers a Clockkeeper and a Porter who attends the shutting and opening of the Gates  § FOR the Endowment of the College we shall only treat upon those Lands given to the Maintenance of this Foundation by the Founder himself or by his  uccessors or by Sovereigns of  The Order of the Garter  uch as have been KnightsCompanions  KING  Edw  III by his Letters Patent of the Foundation  Edw  III aforesaid gave them the Custos Canons AlmsKnights and Ministers the Advowsons of the Churches of  Wyardesbury Rasbury  in  Lincoln SouthTanton  in  Exeter  and  Uttoxater  in  Coventry  and  Litchfield  Diocess in Frank Almoigne free from all Secular Exactions which License to appropriate the same to the College notwithstanding the Statute of  Mortmain  he appointed as much out of his Treasure for their Support as amounted to an immoveable Estate of  l per Annum  and lest there might be any Defect in the Knights Title to  Uttoxater  and  SouthTanton Henry  Earl of  Lancaster    Edw  III and  Thomas Beauchamp  Earl of  Warwick  that Year had special Licenses granted them in Right of Patronage to the said Two Advowsons and they to receive the same Another such License th of  January    Edw  III was given to  William de Bohun  Earl of  Northampton  for assigning to the Custos and Chaplains the Advowson of  Dodyngton  in  Com Oxon  which he held of the King  in Capite  The th of  January  following this Royal Founder conferr'd on them by the Name of Custos and Chaplains of his free Chapel at  Windsor  one Messuage Seventeen Acres of Land one of Pasture and  s  Rent in  Wyrardesbury  in  Com Bucks  which had been convey'd to him by  Richard de Gloucester  Heir to  Isabel de Ditton  and the d of  May  ensuing granted unto them the Advowson of  Dachet  near  Windsor  Anno    Edw  III the King gave them the Advowsons of the Churches of  Eure  in  Com Bucks  of  Riston  in  Com Norsolk  and of  Whaddon  and  Caxton  in  Com Cantab  and in  May  that Year the Advowson of  Simondesbourne  surrender'd  temp Edw  IV to  Richard  Duke of  Gloucester  and of St  Stephens  of  Saltash  The first of these Queen  Philippa  purchas'd of Sir  John Darcy  and the other of  Edward  the Black Prince and gave them both first to the King that by his Grant afterwards to the College its Title might be more corroborated The same Year  October  the King bestow'd on them Marks  per Annum  out of the Farm of the Town  of  Northampton  to be paid by the Bailiff of the Town at  Easter  and  Michaelmas  by equal Allotments And it was at the Founder's Instance therefore worthy to be inserted that the Town of  Yarmouth    Edw  III under their Common Seal granted them a Last of Red Herrings yearly well dry'd and cleans'd to take the Corporation into their Prayers tho' some say it was a Penance enjoyn'd them for murdering a Magistrate  IN the  Edw  III the Founder granted them and their Successors the Mannor of  Eure  near  Weybrigg  in  Com Bucks  the Mannor of  Craswell  in  Bray  in  Com Berks  and a Wear call'd  Braybrook  situated in the  Thames  with all the Lands in that Parish convey'd unto him by Sir  John Philibert  together with the Knights Fees Advowsons c belonging to those Mannors He gave to the Custos and College soon after the Seisin thereof as also of a Wood call'd  TempleWood  in  StokePogeys  convey'd to the King by  John de Molyns  But deeming all the Lands too small for the End he intended  Edw  III the King granted the Custos and College by Letters Patent a Pension of  l per Annum  out of the Exchequer and upon the vacating the same  Edw  III he gave them yearly Lands of  l    s    d  out of the Possessions of religious Aliens which fell into his Hands by Occasion of the  French  Wars But lest these Possessions should be again restor'd upon a Treaty of Peace they were to receive the annual Sum of  l    s    d  out of the Exchequer till they were provided of Lands of the like Value Upon several Restrictions he granted them  l    s    d  yearly to be receiv'd out of  l  which the Prior of  Takkele  paid him for the Farm of that Priory it being then in the King's Hand by reason of the War with  France  And by reason the Revenues did not amount to  l per Annum  as he design'd at the Foundation in the th Year of his Reign he granted them so much Money yearly out of the Exchequer as would make up the Deficiency till Lands or Rents of that Value should be settled on them Lastly  Edw  III the Founder bestow'd on them a Piece of Ground in  New Windsor  whereon had stood an House of  John  of  London  in lieu of the great Garden  South of the Castle formerly given them by him and also a Garden opposite thereunto on the other side of the Way Besides these Largesses of the Founders there were others made by pious and devout Persons said to be incorporated into the first Foundation and made up that Revenue which  William  Bishop of  Winchester  adjudg'd sufficient for the Support of the College which we shall silently pass over with the bare mention only  THE Mannor of  Dodyngton  Castle two Pastures call'd  Frith  and  Ashcroft  the Chapel of  Langeley  the Parsonages of  Estriton

Thornecroft  in  Letherhed  of  Totynbeek  in  Wodesdon Evington Woodmershthorne  of  Fordham Ethrope Newenham  and in  Tollesworth  IN succeeding Times other considerable Donations were made by the Sovereigns and Knights Companions omitting others Some of which as they fall in our way we shall speak of    Rich  II that King gave them a Croft in  Northmolton  with the Advowson of that Church    Hen  V  John  Duke of  Bedford  third Son to King  Hen  IV conferr'd on them the Priory of  Okeborne  in  Wilts  a Cell to  Bec  in  Normandy  with all its Appurtenances Which Donation was confirm'd by King  Hen  V and afterwards by King  Edw  IV    Edw  IV that King who had a singular Respect for the College conferr'd on them the Mannor of  Atherston  in  Com Warwick  the Mannors and Advowsons of  Chesingbury  in  Wilts  and of  Quarle  in  Hantshre  the Church and Priorate of  Uphaven  and the Deanry or Chapel of St  Burien  in  Cornwall  with an Addition of an annual Pension which the Abbot of  Sautrie  discharg'd for the Church of  Fulburne  to the Abbey  de bona Requ    and another yearly Income of  l  paid by the Abbot of  Rousford  for the Mediety of the Church of  Rotheram    Edw  IV he consign'd to them the Mannor or Priorate of  Munclane  in  Com Hereford    Edw  IV he gave unto them the Custody Patronage and free Disposition of the Hospital or Free Chapel of St  Anthony

Pyrton  in  Com Oxon  And that Year the King gave unto them the Advowson of the Church of  Cheshunt  being of his own Patronage provided the Vicarige was sufficiently endow'd and a compleat Sum of Money annually distributed among the poor Parishioners according to the Diocesan's Ordinance To these he united the Custody or Deanry of the Free Chapel of  Wolverhampton  in  Com Staff  to the Custos or Dean of this College and his Successors for ever which Church  cum membris  is exempt from not only the Jurisdiction c of the Bishop of  Litchfield  and  Coventry  but by a Papal Bull from all Legates and Delegates nor is it subject to any terrene Power but the King of  England  alone and under it to the perpetual Visitation of the Keepers of the Great Seal  pro tempore    Edw  IV he resign'd to them the Advowson o  Patronage of the Prebend of  Ewern  in  Com Dorset  wit  all its Rights and Privileges And lastly in the  Year of his Reign he granted them Two Parts of th  Mannors of  Old Swynford  and  Gannow  in  Com  ygorn  and the Reversion of the Third Part of them with the Advowson of the Church of  Old Swynford  nor was he thus munificent alone but excited and spurr'd on others to the like Example licensing in the first Year of his Reign all his Subjects to confer what they pleas'd to the Dean and Canons within the Value of Marks  per Annum  as well such as held of him i  Capite  or otherwise notwithstanding the Statute of  Mortmain  and afterwards increas'd this License to Lands of  l per Annum  Value which King  Hen  VIII  extended to  l  Hereupon  Anno    Edw  IV  John  Duke of  Suffolk  and  Elizabeth  his Wife the King's Sister were permitted to assign to them the Mannor or Lordship of  Grovebury  otherwise call'd  Leighton Bus  rd  in  Com Bedford  the

together with Sir  John Devoreux  and others his Feofees made over to them the Mannor Church and perpetual Advowsons of  Sutton Courtney  in  Com Berks  All the beforementioned Endowments are called the Lands of the old Dotation to distinguish them from those confirmed on the College by King  Edw  VI which are term'd the Lands of the new Dotation of which hereafter But several of them given by King  Edw  IV the College never possessed  viz Atherston Quarle Uphaven St Burien Fulburne  Pension  Brimfi  ld St Elen Charleton Blakenham Ponyngton Wedon Old Suynford  and  Gannow  and of some others they were seized but a short time  viz Chesingbury  the Lands in  Newford Blandford  and  Portsmouth  Besides these the College was dispossess'd of  Gottesford temp Hen  VI of  Cheshunt temp Hen  VII  temp Hen  VIII or a little before of  Wodemershthorn Tylthey Retherfeld Levyngdon StokeBasset Stretham Totingbeek Fordham Elthorp Newenham  and  Tollesworth  afterwards they surrendred into

Shorne  's Shrine at  Northmarston  in  Com Bucks  a Man of great Piety and Veneration with the People and sometime Rector there The Advowson of this Church was appropriated to the Dean and Canons by the Convent of  Dunstaple temp Edw  IV in exchange for  Wedenbeck  in  Com Bedford  THE Dean and Canons having convey'd unto K  H  VIII the Mannor and Rectory of  Ivor  in  Bucks  the Mannor of

Recompence in his Life that King by his last Will ordered them  n Equivalent upon the Commutation and Agreement of an Exchange which Will King  Edw  VI his Son  and Successor performed as well for the Assurance of Lands to the yearly Value of  l  to the Dean and Canons for ever to the Uses in the Will as for the Assurance of other Lands of the annual Value of the said  l    s  and  d  wherefore by Letters Patent dated the th of  October  in the First Year of his Reign he granted them the Rectories of  Bradnynche Northam Iplepen Ilsington  and  Southmolton  in  Com Devon  the Tithe of Corn of  Otery  in that County as also  BlossomsInn  in St  Laur  ncelane London  the Tithes of Grain c of the Rectory of  Ambrosbury  in  Wilts  and all the Tithes of  Bedwyn Stoke Wilton Harden HardenTunrige

Rectories c  l    s    d  annually at  Michaelmas  Moreover within  all these Premises the King granted them Court Leets or Views of Frankpledge and to levy Fines Amerciaments Free Warrens Waifs and Felons Goods and all other Profits c whatsoever and the said Rectories Tithes Pensions Rents and all other Gifts and Grants in the Possession of the Dean and Chapter were confirmed to them by Act of Parliament  Jac  I  THE ancient Rate of these New Lands in the King's Books was  l    s  and  d per Annum  but according to the improved Rents as they were then turned over to the College  l    d  out of which  l    s    d  was yearly allowed them in Requital of their Lands passed to King  Hen  VIII and  l per Annum  for accomplishment of his Will but the remaining Sum  viz    l    s    d  was reserved in lieu of Tenths to be paid into the Court of  Augmentation  nevertheless this last reserved Sum was not assented unto by the Dean and Canons to be so paid because the Charges issuing out of the Lands were larger than were expressed in the Rental And we find that shortly after the Rents of St  Germains Northam Ilsington  c part of the New Lands were received and accounted for according to the old Rate in the King's Books to wit  l    s    d per Annum  in Recompence for the Lands conveyed to King  Hen  VIII and out of which they paid a yearly Surplusage of  l    s    d  This Sum together with the Rents of the rest of the New Lands being upon the said Improvement accounted to be  l    s    d  made in all  l per Annum  and this was laid out by the Dean and Canons for some time towards erecting the AlmsKnights Apartments  THUS stood the Lands accounted for till the Settlement made by Queen  Elizabeth  who in the First Year of her Reign appointed the Dean and Canons to convert the Rents of these New Lands to such Uses and Intents as she had set down in a Book signed with her Sign manual and annexed to an Indenture made between her and the Dean and Canons by which Indenture they were obliged to apply the Rents and Profits of these Lands as was prescribed in the Book and to observe the Ordinances therein and upon Default to abide  such Orders as the Crown or any KnightCompanion deputed by the Sovereign shall set forth     l  s  d  In this Book the Total of the Revenue reckon'd at the ancient Value        The Annual Charge and Disbursements therein set down        And so Remains        Which Remainder has been and is assigned for Payment of Tenths to the Crown Vicars Curates Annual Stipends Officers Fees Reparation of the Premisses and for the Relief of the Dean and Canons in Maintenance and Defence of the said Lands  AND to the End the Queen might know how the Revenue was disposed of she gave charge that her Lieutenant and the KnightsCompanions should annually at the Feast of the Order held at  Windsor  state the Accompt and see how the Income was expended and that her Lieutenant should yearly be put in mind of it by one of the Officers of the Order This Ordinance was renewed  Jac  I and the Chancellor of the Order was appointed to be the Remembrancer and in Obedience thereunto the Account of these new Lands which begins at  LadyDay  as that of the old Lands doth at  Mi  haelmas  was afterwards exhibited in Chapter and in particular that Account  Car  I which was submitted to the Sovereign and KnightsCompanion's Consideration who referred the Inspection thereof to the KnightsCommissaries who were to consult over the Affairs of the Order  § THE Privileges of the Chapel and College are Ecclesiastical and Temporal As to the first Pope  Clem  nt  VI exempted the Chapel College Canons Priests Clerks AlmsKnights and Officers from all ordinary Jurisdiction of Archbishops Bishops Archdeacons and all Judges and Officers and received them within the Protection of the PapalSee and granted a farther Privilege That the Custos should have Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over the Canons Priests c as also the Cure of their Soul  notwithstanding any Papal Constitution  Provincial or Synodical yet allowing that the Custos should receive that Cure from the Diocesan of the Place In Consideration of this Exemption the Custos was to pay annually on St  George  's Day a Mark in Silver to the Pope's Chamber Two Years preceding the Chapel was called the King's Free Chapel which Title it still enjoys for it owes S  bjection to none but the Sovereign of  England  the Supream of the Church as heretofore it stood divided between the King and See of  Rome  The Privilege of Exemption included in the Confirmation of Liberties made by the Founder in his Charter dated  Anno Regni sui  and all other Emoluments granted by him are confirmed by Act of Parliament  Hen  VI As the College has its sole Dependance on the Crown it is visitable only by the LordChancellor whose Visitations and Power are reserved to him by the Statutes of the College and himself called in the King's Commission for Visitation  Rich  II Governor of the said Chapel as well in Spirituals as Temporals and under the King immediate Custos And so jealous were the Dean and Canons left the Power of the said Exemption should be infringed that when  Sixtus  IV had granted the Bishop of  Salisbury  and themselves to make new and interpret the ancient Statutes they soon obtained  Revocation of that Authority left the said Bishop in whose Diocess the College is situate being so unpowered might by Degrees bring them under his Jurisdicton in prejudice to their Exemption And  A D  to prevent  uch design the Archbishop of  Canterbury  c were commission'd to see the Bull revoked and  Salisbury  enjoyned not to intermeddle further in the College Affairs Moreover other Bishops and the Chancellor of  England  were to r  new alter or new make such Statutes as might accrue to the Advantage of the College  IF the Archbishop of  Cant  rbury  be present in the Chapel he sits below the Dean nor can he consecrate there without his License And this is very remarkable that at the ratifying the Peace between King  Charles  I and  L  wis  XIII  A D  in the Chapel at  W  sor  Dr  Wren  then Dean of the College gave the  Oath to the  French  Ambassador and not the Archbishop of  Canterbury  tho' he was then present  THE Dean and Chapter are to weigh well and debate at their yearly Chapters all things fit to be dispatched in reference to the College Affairs and whatsoever Determination they come to not repugnant to their Statutes all Persons are firmly obliged to observe  THE Deans have no Institution from any Bishop but his Institution Investiture and Installation into the Custosship Canonship and Prebendship is conferred from such of the Canons Resident to whom the King who collates doth recommend him Other Marks of Exemption appear in the constant proving of Wills before him or in his Absence before his Lieutenant In using the Power of Excommunication within their Jurisdiction the Precincts of the College granting a Dispensation for eating Flesh in  Lent  a farther Mark of their Privilege appears that the Ordination for the Chantry Priests were confirmed by the Dean and Chapter and not the Bishop of the Diocess as were the Statutes of the new Commons The Dean is exemp  from paying all Synodals or Procurations nor can any of the King's Chaplains preach in the Chapel of St  George  unless he be a Canon there or have License from the King or from the Dean and Canons They send no Delegates to the Synod and when the Point was debated it was carried in the Negative as being against their Liberties and might intitle them to the Paym  nt of Subsidies nor are they intitled to any Share in the Government of the Church more than the Colleges in the Universities where there are many nominal Deans In short when by the Act of  Uniformi  y    Car  II every Clergyman was bound to subscribe before the Arch bishop or his Ordinary the Canons subscribed before the Dean and tho' some of them subscribed

the Nobleness of the Personages that have been enroll'd it excels and outvies all other Institutions of Honour in the whole World It owes its Original as is confessed on all Hands to  Edward  III King of  England  and  France  yet as to the Occasion there are several Opinions which we shall rectifie The vulgar and more general is that the Garter of  Joan  Countess of  Salisbury  dropping casually off as she danced in a solemn Ball King  Edward  stooping took it up from the Ground whereupon some of his Nobles smiling as at an amorous Action and he observing their sportive Humour turned it off with a Reply in  French Honi soit qui mal y pense  but withal added in disdain of their Laughter  That shortly th  y should see that Garter advanced to so high an Honour and Renown as to account themselves happy to wear it  BUT upon Examination of this Tradition let others judge what Credit it bears to establish its Belief for Sir  John Froissart  the only Writer of the Age that treats  of this Institution assigns no such Original nor for Years after is there any thing to the Purpose in our other Historians till  Polydore Virgil  took occasion to say something of it but had it been Fact some  French  Historian or other would not have neglected to register it at a convenient Time with a Scoff and Ridicule since that Nation was so ready to deride King  Henry  V's Design of invading them with a Return of Tennis Balls  IN the Original Statutes of this Order there is not the least Conjecture to countenance the Conceit of such a Feminine Institution no not so much as laying an Obligation on the KnightsCompanions to defend the Quarrels of Ladies as some Orders then in being enjoyned nor doth the Author of that Tract entitled  Institutio clarissimi Ordinis Militaris a praenobili subligaculo nuncupati  prefaced to the Black Book of the  Garter  let fall the manifest Passage to ground it on  As to what  Polydore  says he is not so confident to ascertain the Person whose Garter it was but cautiously declining that says it was either the Queen's or the King's Mistress's and if it were the latter yet doth he omit her Name and Title both which on what Authority we find not are supplied by modern Historians who call her  Joan  Countess of  Salisbury  the same elsewhere celebrated by the Name of the  Fair Maid  of  Kent  whom  Edward  the Black Prince afterward married whereas no Historian ever gave the least Inuendo that King  Edward  III ever courted her as a Mistress  Selden  points at her when he calls the Lady from whom the Garter slipp'd Countess of  Kent  and  Salisbury  But about the Time when this Order was founded she in truth was dignified with neither Honour for altho' she was Daughter to  Tho  of  Woodstock  Earl of  Kent  and had been sometime the reputed Wife of  William Mountague  second Earl of  Salisbury  yet then she cou'd not properly be accounted Countess of  Salisbury  She was actually Wife to Sir  Thomas Holland  one of the First Founders of the Order Nor was she yet tho' afterwards Countess of  K  nt  because her Brother  John  Earl of  Kent  at the Institution of this Order survived and died not till  Edw  III  THAT there was a Countess of  Salisbury  with whom King  Edward  III became greatly enamour'd  Froissart  reports after this manner  That this King having relieved a Castle of that Earl's in the North wherein his Countess had been besieged by the  Scots  the Earl himself being at that time Prisoner in  France  upon sight of her extraordinary Beauty he fell in love with her but she so virtuously demeaned her self during his Abode there that he declined further Solicitation  However some time after the King out of Desire to see her proclaim'd solemn Justs in  London  whither this Countess and other Ladies being invited came up This Castle it seems was  Wark  upon  Tweed  in  Northumberland  which King  Edward  had formerly bestowed on her Husband for his good Service past when he first espoused her being then but a Knight  ALTHO' it should be admitted that this Countess of  Salisbury  was the King's Mistress yet must it be remark'd That she was Wife to  William Mountague  Kt created Earl of  Salisbury Anno    Edw  III Mother to  William  the beforemention'd second Earl that her Christian Name was  Catherine  not  Alice  as  Froissart  not  Joan  as others call her Daughter to  William  Lord  Granston  and that she expired  Edw  III But that the whole may appear what indeed it is a meer Fable we shall insert the Judgment of Dr  Heylin  who took great Pains in this Particular  This  says he  I take to be a vain and idle Romance derogatory both to the Founder and the Order first published by  Pol Virgil  a Stranger to the Affairs of  England  and by him taken upon no better ground than  Fama Vulgi  the Tradition of the common People too trifling a Foundation to so great a Building  OF the same Contexture with the former is another Tradition in  Andrew du Chesne That the Queen departing from the King to her own Apartments and he following soon after chanced to espy a Blue Garter lying on the Ground supposed to have slipp'd from her Leg whilst some of his Attendants carelesly passed by it as disdaining to stoop at such a Trifle but he knowing the Owner commanded it to be given him at the Receipt of which he said You make but small account of this Garter but within few Months I'll cause the b  st of you all to reverence it alike  Some suppose that the Motto was the Queen's Answer when the King asked  her  What Men would conjecture of her upon her losing her Garter in such a manner  BOTH Relations are far distant from Fact nevertheless it has thus far'd with other Orders of Sovereign Foundation and an amorous instead of an honourable Account has been falsly render'd of their Institution as for Instance  The Order of the  Annunciade and that of  The Golden Fleece  THERE is a third Opinion grounded on a Relation made of King  Rich  I who whilst his Forces were employ'd against  Cyprus  and  Acon  and extremely tir'd and harrass'd with the Siege he by the Assistance and Mediation of St  George  as imagin'd was inspir'd with fresh Courage and bethought himself of a new Device which was to tie about the Legs of a Number of Knights a Leathern Thong Garter for such had he then at hand whereby they being emulated to future Glory with Assurance of Reward if they prov'd victorious they might be excited to behave themselves intrepidly and well much after the Examples of the old  Romans  among whom were distributed various Crowns for several Causes to adorn the Soldiers But if King  Richard  I did make use of this Device in the  Holy Land  as a Signal or Mark of Distinction of a Party upon some warlike Exploit yet that he took Occasion to create a distinct Order of Knighthood thereupon there is not sufficient warrant to believe for it is only put down in the Preface of the  Black Book  but not in any Part of the Annals of the Order nor can it plead higher Antiquity than the Reign of King  Hen  VIII when written All the Advantage that can be made of it is to heighten the Reputation of that Saint among the  English  by which Means the Garter came to be dedicated to him and not that it contributed to its Institution  § THE true Motive was therefore neither the Ladies Garter or King  Richard  's Leathern Thong that it owes it Original to But King  Edward  being a Person of consummate Vertue gave himself up to military Affairs and being engag'd in War for recovering his Right to  France  made use of the best Martialists  of the Age did thereupon first design induc'd by its ancient Fame the Restoration of King  Arthur  's  Round Table  to invite hither the Gallant Spirits from abroad and endear them to himself and adjudging no Place more requisite than  Windsor  upon  NewYear'sDay A D  he issu'd out Letters of Protection for the safe going and return of Foreign Knights to try their Valour at the Solemn Justs to be held there on  Monday  after the Feast of St  Hilary  following which happen'd  Jan  And these Letters of SafeConduct continu'd in force until the  Octaves  of the Purification of our blessed Virgin ensuing being the th Year of his Reign At the Time appointed he provided a great Supper to begin the Solemnity and then ordain'd this Festival to be annually at  Whitsontide  and immediately after these first Exercises were over for a future and better Accommodation he impress'd Workmen and Carriages for erecting a particular Building in the Castle and therein plac'd a Table of Two Hundred Foot Diameter where the Knights should have their Entertainment of Diet at his Expence of  l per  Week to which Building he gave the Name of  The Round Table  And as at these great Conventions the Days were spent in all Kinds of noble Feats of Arms Justs and Turnaments so were a great Part of the Nights consum'd in publick Balls and dancing with the Ladies that attended the Queen thither and perhaps it was hence conjectur'd that at some of these Balls the Queen's Garter or the Garter of  Catherine  Countess of  Salisbury  might slip off and the King's taking it up occasion Smiles in the Bystanders and afterwards when the King had modell'd his intended Order a Garter offering it self for its chief Ensign might add to the Conjecture but that it was the principal Cause is a groundless Imagination And tho' King  Edward  advanc'd the Honour of the Garter as to denominate the Order yet was it not to enhance Reputation to or perpetuate an effeminate Occasion but to adorn Martial Prowess with Honours Rewards and Splendor to increase Vertue and Valour in the Hearts of his Nobility that so true Worth after long and hazardous Exploits should not  enviously be depriv'd of that Glory which it hath intrinsically deserv'd and that active and hardy Youths might not want a Spur in their Progression in the Paths of Vertue which is to be esteem'd glorious and eternal  IT is further observable that the  French  King  Philip de Valoys  in Emulation of this Seminary at  Windsor  set up a  Round Table  at his Court and invited Knights and valiant Men of Arms out of  Italy  and  Almaine  thither left they should repair to our King  Edward  III which meeting with Success prov'd a Countermine to his main Design who perceiving that his Hospitality towards strange Knights upon Account of reviving King  Arthur  's  Round Table  was too general nor did sufficiently ingratiate them to his Person but being unconstrain'd and at Liberty did after their Departure take what Side they pleas'd in the ensuing Wars he at length resolv'd upon a Projection more particu  ar and select and such as might oblige those whom he thought fit to make his Associates in a lasting Bond of Friendship and Honour And having issu'd forth his own Garter for the Signal of a Battle that was crown'd with Success which is conceiv'd to be the Battle of  Cressy  fought about Three Years after his erecting the  Round Table  upon so remarkable a Victory he thence took Occasion to institute this Order and gave the Garter Preheminence among the Ensigns of it whence that select Number whom he incorporated into a Fraternity are styl'd  Equites Aureae Periscelidis  and vulgarly  Knights of the Garter  By this Symbol he design'd to bind the Knights and Fellows of it mutually unto one anothe  and all of them joyntly to himself as Sovereign of the Order nor was his Expectation frustrated for it did not serve only as a vehement Spur and Incentive to Honour and martial Vertue but also as a golden Bond of Unity and internal Society and for  his Consideration  Cambden  aptly calls it a Badge of  nity and Concord  BY the Symbols of this Garter the Knights are reminded with all Religiousness Sincerity Friendliness Faithfulness and Dexterity not to leave the Pursuit of whatsoever they take in hand nor to enterprize any  Thing contrary to the Statutes of the Order neither to frustrate the Rights of Peace and Friendship nor vilify the Law of Arms or proceed in any Thing farther than Faith and Compact or the Bond of Friendship will admit Moreover in the binding of the Leg with this enobled Ensign there was given this Caveat and Exhortation that the Knights should not pusillanimously by running away from Battle betray the Valour and Renown which is ingrafted in Constancy and Magnanimity Nay so exactly did the Founder contrive the whole Habit into the Signification of the Garter that he ordain'd his and the KnightsCompanions Robes and Ornaments to be all alike both for Materials and Fashion intimating thereby That they ought to conserve brotherly Affection among themselves The great Collar of the Order was made of equal Weight and like Number of Knots and Links in Token of the like Bond of Faith Peace and Amity inviolably to be observ'd and retain'd amongst them In fine all Things were so design'd that every one might plainly perceive how much these Things tended to the Maintenance of Amity and Concord  IN further reference to the establishing this Order the aforesaid King calling together the Earls Barons and principal Knights of his Kingdom  Freely  says  Froissart and obligingly declar'd his Mind to them concerning this Affair  To which  all of them being well inclin'd entertain'd the Motion with equal Joy and Applause deeming it would prove a very great Advancement to Piety Nobility and Vertue and likewise an excellent Expedient for the uniting not only his Subjects one with another but all Foreigners conjunctively with them in the Bonds of Amity and Peace  And 'tis very improbable the prudent Founder should summon his Nobles to consult about the Grandeur of an Order that had taken its Rise from so slight an Occasion as the dropping of a Garter from a Lady's Leg Now to draw the Tye of Friendship more close the King caused those who were or should be of the Order to be call'd  Fellows Associates Colleagues Brethren  and  KnightsCompanions  and the Order it self a  Society Fellowship College of Knights  and  KnightCompanionship  and their Habits to be all alike to represent how they  ought to be united in all Chances and various Turn  of Fortune Copartners both in Peace and War assistant to one another in all serious and dangerous Exploits and thro' the whole Course of their Lives to shew Fidelity and Friendliness one towards another There are other Reasons assign'd much to the same Effect That the Order was instituted  to fortifie the Confidence of the King the Kingdom and Martial Vertue  that is to say  to strengthen the Faith of the Subjects towards them and for their greater Security  and  because the Garter carries with it a Bond or Tye of Fellowship and is a Symbol of Amity between Princes being Companions of the same Order  IN the last Place if we look upon the Statutes of its Institution we shall find the Injunctions wholly Military and so are the Words of Admonition pronounc'd at the putting on the Ensigns of the Order And the Ground of the Institution in the Preamble to King  Henry  VIII's  Exemplar  is said to be  for the Honour of God and Exaltation of the Catholick Faith joyn'd both with Piety and Charity in establishing a College of religious Men to pray for the Prosperity of the Sovereign of the Order and the KnightsCompanions and to perform other holy Duties  as also  ordaining a Maintenance for a Company of AlmsKnights who have not otherwise wherewith to support themselves  but not one Word relating to the Engagement on behalf of the feminine Sex  AND whereas King  Edw  III had laid Claim by his Title to the Kingdom of  France  and in Right thereof assum'd its Arms he from the Colour of them 'tis said caus'd the Garter to be made Blue and the Circumscription Gold And it may without straining be inferr'd from the Motto  Honi soit qui mal y pense  that he retorted Shame and Defiance upon him that should dare to think amiss of so just an Enterprize as he had undertaken for recovering of his lawful Right to that Crown and that the Magnanimity and Bravery of those Knights whom he had elected into this Order was such as would impower and enable them to maintain the Quarrel against all who thought ill of it Consonant to this is the Conjecture of  Harpsfield  that this Apophthegm was design'd to put the KnightsCompanions  in mind  Not to admit any Thing in their Actions or among their Thoughts derogatory to themselves and their Honour  THAT Age did exceedingly abound with Impresses Motto's and Devices and particularly King  Edw  III was so excessively given up to them that his Apparel Plate Bed HousholdFurniture Shields and even the Harness of his Horses and the like were not without them many of which now to descant upon would be a fruitless Attempt seeing the Occasion of the Invention and the Circumstances are lost that should illustrate them and others by reason of their Brevity seem'd insignificant in regard something was designedly omitted and left to be understood which cannot now be rightly supply'd so as to arrive at the Mind of the Inventor Of this Number may be this Motto  It is as it is  which was embroider'd upon a Doublet of that King tho' there are others which seem more easy to be decypher'd as that daring Motto wrought upon his Surcoat and Shield provided to be used at a Turnament  Hay Hay the Wythe Swan  By God's Soul I am the Man  § THE time when the Order was instituted Historians differ widely about  Selden Cowper  and others from  Froissart  who wrote  temp Rich  II would have it in the th of King  Edw  III But since  Froissart  errs in making the Number of KnightsCompanions no fewer than Forty which is a grand Mistake Why might not he trip in Point of Time and confound the Year of its Erection with that wherein the Founder renew'd the Order of  The Round Table Windsor  being the Place for both For should we admit that during some Part of the Solemnity held in this King's th Year when the Accident of the Lady's Garter slipping off happen'd what other Inference can be made but that he had only an Intention to put in Execution somewhat afterwards Not that an Order was actually  rected at that Time Besides the Jollity of the Season the Greatness of the Concourse and  the Splendidness of the Festivity it was too busy a Time to suffer much Consultation tending thereunto or at least to mould and model a Design so compleat and substantial as it appears to have been even at first If we joyn  Fabian  he is plain that tho' the King design'd the Institution at the End of the Festival which he places between  Candlemas  and  Lent  in the th and not th Year of that King  Yet was it not then  saith he  but afterwards establish'd by him  Nevertheless Mr  Selden  elsewhere observes it had its Original in the th Year of the said King And our industrious  Stow  with whom  Lily Speed  and  Segar  agree tells us  That the first Feast of the Order was celebrated  A D which exactly agrees to the th of  Edward  III But  Polydore Virgil  places it after the th of  Edward  III We must therefore have recourse to some other Proofs for elucidating this Point since this Chronological  Aera  of the true Time of its Institution hath wonderfully slipp'd the Pens of all Writers  ADMITTING then that the erecting this Order was first thought of by King  Edward  at some of those grand Assemblies of  The Round Table  held after the  French  King had set up the like yet was it not mature or brought to any Perfection till after his glorious Victories and Triumphs over the  French  and  Scots  in the Battles of  Cressy  and  Nevil  's Cross in the last of which the  Scotch  King  David  was taken Prisoner and until King  Edward  had  Calais  surrendred to him as will appear very conspicuous  AMONG the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe is one containing the Account of all the King's Liveries from  Michaelmas Anno  to the st of  Jan    Edw  III In the same are divers Things mention'd to be adorn'd with Garters which were provided against the first grand Feast of St  G orge  and among the rest the Royal Robes  viz  his Mantle Surcoat and Hood likewise a Bed of Blue Taffaty was bedeck'd with Garters containing the Motto  Honi soit qui mal y pense  There were made for the Sovereign Three Harnesses whereof Two were of White Velvet wrought over with Garters  de blu d  asp  i per totum compedmein cum Woodhouses  and the Third  de Velve  to Ynde cont Lapp  kin  quisseux caligas  wrought over likewise with Garters Had the Roll been divided into Years or had distinguishing Marks of Time upon it we might have been guided with more Certainty as to the true Year of the Institution However we may thence conclude it was not founded in the th of  Edw  III because that the Sovereign's Robes were not made until the d Year of his Reign at soonest perhaps not till the Beginning of the d But to put the Matter beyond dispute the Founder's Statutes fix the Time of Institution to his d Year so do the Statutes of King  Henry  V and the Preface to the  Black Book Leland Mills  and Dr  Heylin  To conclude when he had fix'd upon the Day and Place for  elebrating the first grand Feast of this Order he sent his Heralds into  Germany France Scotland Burgundy Hainault Flanders  and  Brabant  to invite all Knights and Esquires with Assurance of SafeConduct and Liberty for Fifteen Days both before and after the grand Solemnity to shew their military Prowess and other publick Exercises there to be perform'd proper to the Place and Occasion agreeable to which Invitation sundry Knights and Gallant Men came over to signalize their Valour and what made the Solemnity more glorious King  Edward  's Queen was there present attended with Three Hundred of the fairest Ladies in all imaginable Splendor and Gaity  § THE Patrons of the Order were several under whose Protection according to the Custom of the Age King  Edw  III put himself and all the KnightsCompanions that the Affairs of the Order might be defended preserved and govern'd  THE  first  and chiefest which he elected was the  Holy Trinity  which in a more especial Manner was invocated to the Aid and Assistance of this Order  Secondly  King  dward  III intitled peculiarly the  blessed Virgin  Mary accounted then the general Mediatrix and Protectress of all Men unto whom Kin  Edward  IV was so strictly devoted that he thought some additional Ceremonies requisite to her farther Honour and thereupon ordain'd  that on her Five Solemnities  the Knights Companions should annually as accustom'd on the Feast of St  George  wear the Habit of the Order as long as Divine Service was celebrating unless they had sufficient Cause of excuse bearing on the right Shoulders of their Robes a golden Figure of the Virgin  Mary  and that they should go in the same Manner and Habit upon all  Sundays  throughout the Year and lastly that on the same Days for ever they should say Five  Pater Nosters  with as many  Ave Maria's  Thirdly  St  George  of  Cappadocia  a most choice Champion of Christ and famous Martyr was also elected one of the Patrons to this Order by King  Edward  III not so much as he was a Professor of the Christian Faith or for that he was an armed Soldier or Knight of Christ but so much the more because in those Wars which were waged by the Christians against the Infidels he by several Appearances manifested his Presence as a most certain Encourager and Assistant to the Christians the Relations whereof may be seen in Dr  Heylin  's History who hath laboriously and judiciously maintain'd the History of this Saint against those that will not allow him a Place in Heaven or a Being in the Church In like manner the learned  Selden  hath avouch'd him to be the special Patron Protector Defender and Advocate of this Realm of  England  and has made it plainly appear in what Veneration he hath been honour'd abroad especially among the Eastern Nations To whose corroborating Testimonies we shall add That this Title of Patron to our Nation as given to St  George  by the Founder of this Order in a Patent granted to the Dean and Canons of the Chapel of St  Stephen  at  Westmins  er  and St  George  at  Windsor  which dischargeth them from Payment of Tythes as also by King  Henry  VIII in the Preamb  e of his St  tutes And tho' in general he is sty  'd the Principal Patron of the Affairs of  Christendom  and a tutelar Guardian of military Men yet among all Christians the  English  did excel and in this Nation the Founder of this Order in making choice of such an approv'd  Captain and Patron in particular Resp  ct o  whom the Knights had the Title of  St  George  's Knights and the Order it self came to  call'd the  Ordo Divi Sancti Georgii  The Order of St  George  IT is remarkable that  Du Chesn  a noted  French  Historian acknowledges it was by the special Invocation of St  George  that King  Edward  III gain'd the Battle of  Cressy  which afterwards bringing to his Remembrance  He founded  says he  a Chapel within the Castle of  Windsor But if we may ascend a step higher and give credit to  Harding  it's recorded King  Arthur  paid St  George  particular Honours for he advanc'd his Picture in one of his Banners which was about Two Hundred Years after his Martyrdom and very early for a Country so remote from  Cappadocia  to have him in Reverence and Esteem  Lastly  The Founder added a fourth Patron whose Name himself bore  viz  St  Edward the Confessor  his Predecessor King of  Eng  and  and we find he was wont to be invocated by this Founder as well as St  George  in any great Difficulties and Streights  Walsingham  gives an Instance at the Skirmish of  Calais A D  when King  Edward  in great Anger and Grief drew out his Sword and most passionately cry'd out  Ha St  Edward  Ha St  George which his Soldiers hear  ng ran presently to him and rushing violently upon the Enemy put many of them to the Sword These Four Patrons we find recorded together in the Preamble of the Foundation of  Windsor  College by King  Edward  III tho' in the Preamble to his Statutes of the Order and to King  Henry  V's Statutes St  Edward the Confessor  is omitted nevertheless he is enumerated with the rest in the Preamble to King  H  nry  VIII's  § As to the Honour and Reputation of this Noble Order either in Comparison with others or in Reference to it self it challenges the Precedency of Antiquity before the eldest Rank of Honour of that Kind any where establish'd  Second  y  The Statutes of the Foundation were so exquisitely and judiciously devised and compacted upon such solid Foundations of Honour and Nobleness that they afterwards became a Precedent to other Orders and gave the Plan to those Two of  The Golden Fl  ece  and  of Monsieur St  Michael  as is manifest by comparing their Statutes  Thirdly  It is no small Honour that accrues to this Order that the Number of these KnightsCompanions were never encreas'd but as they were Twenty Six with the Sovereign so they now thus continue  ut Pretium faciat raritas  for the infringing this Article hath split several other military Orders into Contempt and Ruin as nothing more tarnishing or throwing a fully on the Worth of Glory and Honour than when render'd so vulgar and indifferently disposed without Distinction and Merit as is exemplify'd in  The Order of the  Star and the now declining  Order of St  Michael  Fourthly  It has receiv'd more additional Lustre by being honour'd with the Companionship of divers Emperors Kings and Sovereign Princes who esteem  d it the Summit of their Glory and the highest Trophy of additional Honour to be enroll'd in the Number Insomuch that some of them with Impatience courted the Election For we find recorded in the Register  A D  Eight Emperors of  Germany  Three Kings of  Spain  Five  French  Kings Two Kings of  Scotland  Five Kings of  Denmark  Five Kings of  Portugal  Two Kings of  Sweden  One King of  Poland  One King of  Arragon  Two Kings of  Naples  besides divers Dukes and other free Princes as One Duke of  Guelderland  One Duke of  Holland  Two Dukes of  Burgundy  Two Dukes of  Brunswick  One Duke of  Milan  Two Dukes of  Urbin  One Duke of  Ferrara  One Duke of  Savoy  Two Dukes of  Holstein  One Duke of  Saxony  and One Duke of  Wertemberg  Seven Count Palatines of the  Rhin    Four Princes of  Orange  and One Marquis of  Brandenburg  Fifthly  It entitles those Knights and Noblemen whose Vertue hath rais'd them to this Pitch of Greatness to be Companions and Associates with Emperors and Kings a Prerogative of an high Nature and a sufficient Recompence for the greatest Merit We shall close up all with the high Elogy bestow'd on it by the learned  Selden That it exceeds in Majesty Honour and Fame all Chivalrous Orders of the World  CAP VI The Statutes and Annals of the Order  ORDER and Regularity is not only the Beauty and Symmetry of Government and Societies but also greatly contributes to their Establishment and Perpetuity Statutes and Rules are as well the Bounds to determine as Bonds to unite Fellowship and Societies together and if either fall into difuse or be unadvisedly broken they open a Field to Dissolution and Ruin  SUCH like Considerations mov'd and excited the victorious King  Edward  III after he had determin'd the Erection of this most renown'd  Order of the Garter  to  devise and institute several laudable Statutes and Ordinances to be duly observ'd and kept within the said Order  which being collected into one Body are call'd  The Statutes of Institution  THE Original of these was ordain'd to be kept within the Treasury of the College of  Windsor  but hath long since wholly perish'd yet a Transcript of them is recorded in the Reign of King  Henry  V in an old Book call'd  Registrum Ordinis Chartaceum  Two more ancient  Exemplars  of this Body of Statutes are also in being the one in the Library of the Lord  Hatton  and the other in the  Black Book  of the Order and comparing them together I shall here give from the  Latin  the Heads they consist of  THE King of  England  his Heirs and Successors are to be Sovereigns or Superiors of this Order  NONE are to be admitted unless he be a Gentleman of Blood and that he be a Knight and without Reproach  THE KnightsCompanions were to be Twenty Six  ach to have at  Windsor  a Mantle and Garter for the better Splendor of the Order to wear the said  Habit whensoever they go to the Chapel of St  George  or ChapterHouse to hold a Chapter or do any thing relating to their Order In like manner they are to wear the Habit upon the Vigils of St  George  in their Procession from the King's Lodgings to the Chapel or ChapterHouse and returning back and during Supper continue so habited till it be over and likewise on the Morrow of St  George  's Day at Chapel Dinnertime Suppertime and afterwards all the said Day until the Sovereign or his Deputy shall deposite the Ensigns of the Order and decree their Departure  THERE were to be Thirteen Canons Secular who at the Time of their Institution or within a Year were to be Priests and as many Vicars already Priests or to be made so at the next Ordination answerable to the number of the KnightsCompanions these religious Persons to be presented by the several Founders each one and upon the Death or Vacancy of such presented the Sovereign of the Order ever afterwards to have the Nomination of them who were bound to pray for the good Estate of the Sovereign and his Kingdom and particularly for this Order  THE Canons were to wear a Purple Mantle with the Arms of St  George  in a Roundle upon their right Shoulder  THERE were to be Twenty Six poor veterane Knights  ach to have a competent Subsistence their Election to be after the manner of the Canons aforesaid  THESE Knights were to have a Red Mantle with the Arms of St  George  but without any Circle of the Garter about it  IF the Sovereign could not be present at the solemn Festival of St  George  his Deputy was to supply his Place at the Charge of the Sovereign but such Deputy was not to make any new Ordinances tho' he has License to correct or amend the old Ones  EVERY Year upon the Vigils of St  George  the KnightsCompanions within the Realm or elsewhere if conveniently are to assemble at  Windsor  Castle and be present there at the Celebration of Divine Service in the Habit of the Order where placed regularly in  their Stalls or Seats directly over their Heads their Helmets and Swords c are to be hung up and remain as long as such Knights live in Honour of them and to signify the Defence of the Church to which they are obliged as a Military Order but in case the Feast of St  George  happens to fall within the Quindene or Fifteen Days after the Feast of  Easter  then it was to be prorogued to the  Sunday  next following accounting Fifteen Days from  Easter  Day that every KnightCompanion might have reasonable time to come nor be forced to ride upon any of the Three  Easter  Holydays  THAT they meet in St  George  's Chapel yearly on the Eve of St  George  at the Hour of Three in the Afternoon and if they come not at the Time assigned without a just Excuse which the Sovereign or his Deputy allows their Penalty is to be according to the Ordinance of the Chapter which is That they shall not enter into the Chapter Door for that time but s  ay without and shall have no Voice in any thing that is done in the said Chapter and if they come not before the Beginning of Vespers they shall not enter into their Stalls but shall tarry below before the said Stalls in the Choiristers Places during Vespers The like Penalty is ordain'd for not coming to the Mass or MorningService betime and at Vespers on St  George  's Day and whosoever shall absent himself wholly from this Solemnity without sufficient Excuse and Leave from the Sovereign or Deputy he is not to enter within his Stall the next Feast after but shall stay below and before his Stall as it is said at Vespers and in the Morrows Procession must walk before the Three processional Crosses now the Cho  risters and at Mass Service shall sit below until the Offering and he to offer last After which he is to come before the Sovereign or his Deputy's Stall and ask Pardon which reinstates him in his Stall Absenting the next second Time upon the Feast without Leave he has no Stall allowed him until he hath given and offered a Jewel upon St  George  's Altar to the Value of Twenty Marks which is to be double every Year until a Reconciliation  WHERESOEVER they be they must wear their Blue Robes from the Beginning of the first Vespers on the Eve of St  George  's Day to the second Vespers on the Morrow inclusive c  IF any KnightCompanion appears publickly without his dignifying Garter upon challenging the same is to pay half a Mark to the Custos and College  AT the Times of Offering each associated with the other who holds the opposite Stall are to march in Procession together to make their Offerings but alone when his Consort is absent and so that in all Processions the Sovereign goes last  IN the Morrow after the Solemnity of St  George  's Feast is over before their separating a Mass  de Requie  or Office  de Defunctis  was to be used at which the KnightsCompanions were all entirely to be present without necessary Impediment shown to the Sovereign or Deputy for Liberty to depart  THEY were to leave their Robes at  Windsor  always to be ready for them there upon any sudden Occasions that might evene  JOURNYING near  Windsor  in Honour of the Place unless lawful Cause obstructs they must take it in their Way and assuming the Habit of the Order the Canons wore devoutly to meet and conduct them into the Chapel where if it happens to be time of Divine Service they are to hear the same if not they are to be detained no longer than while the Canons shall say the Psalm  de profundis  for the Defunct and during their own Offering But if any had riden thro' the Town without visiting the Chapel and offering there for every Neglect he must go one Mile on Foot from the said Chapel to shew his Obedience and offer an HalfPenny in Honour of St  George  UPON first Notice of the Death of any of the Order the Sovereign shall ordain a Thousand Masses every Foreign Prince shall cause Eight Hundred a Prince of Wales Seven Hundred a Duk  Six Hundred an Earl Three Hundred every Baron Two Hundred and every Knight Batchellor One Hundred Masses to be celebrated for the Good of the Soul departed  which neglected for a Quarter of a Year after notice of such Death the Masses are to be doubled upon half a Year's Neglect again doubled and so from Time to Time in like Form till the End of the Year and then the Year's to be doubled  UPON sure Notice of the Death of a KnightCompanion the Sovereign or his Deputy is to converse by Letters the Remainder not Strangers that are within the Kingdom to meet him within Six Weeks in some convenient Place and elect another which assembled at least Six with the Sovereign or Deputy every of them present is to name Nine of the worthiest and sufficientest Knights without Reproof that he knows whether native Subjects or Foreigners sobeit they hold no contrary Party or be against the Sovereign  viz  Three Earls or of sublimer Title Three Barons and Three Knights Batchellors which Names the Bishop of  Windsor  for the Time being was to write or in his Absence the Dean or Register and in their Absence the oldest Residencer in the College and after shew them to the Sovereign who is to chuse out of them him that has the most Voices and whom he esteems the most beneficial to the Crown and Kingdom Every Knight failing to appear at an Election without an approved Cause was to pay to the Custos and College the Penalty of a Mark and at his next coming to the Chapter shall kneel upon the Ground in the midst of the Chapter before the Sovereign or Deputy until Reconciliation  SOON after Election the KnightCompanion elect is to have a Garter in token of his Election and that he is a Fellow of the Order and as soon as decreed to take Possession of his Stall but not before is to have a Mantle which if he dies before he receiv'd he was not to be accounted as one of the Order because he wanted Possession nevertheless he was to have one half of the Masses abovesaid because he had the Garter deliver'd to him and nothing beside If he was not installed within a Year after his receiving the Garter and especially if within the Realm and without reasonable Excuse to be allowed of by the Sovereign or Deputy his Election became void and they might proceed  to a new one Moreover neither the Sword nor Helmet was to be put upon his Stall within the Castle before his coming to the End that if the Knight elect came not his Atchievements might not be unhandsomly taken down and abused but honourably removed into the Choir for the publick Use and Profit of the said College  EVERY Foreigner elected was to have Certification of such his Election from the Sovereign at the Sovereign's Charge who was to send him the Garter and the Mantle and a Copy of the Statutes of the Order under the Common Seal of the said Order within Four Months after the Election the better for him to advise on which being accepted of whatsoever Condition he be he was obliged within Eight Months after to send a sufficient Proxy according to his State and Dignity a Knight irreprehensible to be installed in his Room and who was to bring with him a Silk Mantle of the Blue Colour of the Order also a Sword and Helmet to remain at  Windsor  which Mantle was be put upon the right Shoulder of the Proxy by the Sovereign or Deputy at the time of Installment when he is introduced to take the Stall in the Name of his Lord and Master neither was he to deposite the same till the End of Divine Service after which he was not to wear it nor be admitted in the ChapterHouse or have any Suffrage by virtue of any Powers vested in him but this Favour Foreigners elected by Proxy were to have that could not personally come themselves they were to be Partakers of the whole Masses and Orisons of the Order whereas if they died before the Installation they were to have but a Moity of them  UPON the Death of any Earl or of Superior Dignity Baron or Knight Batchellor his Successor whether Earl or of Superior Dignity Baron or Knight was to have a vacant Stall of his Pred  c  ssor without any changing of Places except the Prince of  Wales  alone who was to have always the next Stall and opposite to the Sovereign so that it may happen for a Knight to have an Earl's Place or an Earl a Knight's Place and this because the first Founders might be  nown  EVERY KnightCompanion at his first Entrance was to give a certain Alms according to their Eminence and Degree for the perpetual Maintenance of the Canons and Poor Knights  viz  the Sovereign Forty Marks a Foreign King Twenty Pounds a Prince of  Wales  Twenty Marks a Duke Ten Pounds an Earl Ten Marks a Baron a Hundred Shillings and a Knight Batchellor Five Marks that by these pious Don  tions they might justly entitle themselves to the Name and Privileges of the Order wherefore before these Payments were rightly performed their Sword and Helmet Atchievements were not to be hung up and for Foreigners the Sovereign was obliged to pay himself  UPON the Death of any of the Founders his Arms in a Plate of Metal was to be fixed upon the Back of his Stall and their Successors were to have the like but to be placed underneath their Predecessors and not to be so great as those of the first Founders  AT Admission every KnightCompanion must promise and swear personally or by Proxy faithfully to observe the Statutes of the Order and none are to be installed by Proxy but Foreigners only which cannot conveniently come in Person  IF the Sovereign be out of  England  at the Installation of any KnightCompanion or could not attend himself to do what appertains to him in that Point he might impower and authorize any of the Fellows to officiate for him  THAT there be a Common Seal or Signet Keeper whom the Sovereign was to assign  EVERY KnightCompanion was to have a Copy of the Statutes under the Seal of the Order the Original sealed likewise with the said Seal to remain for evermore within the Treasury of the College and upon the Death of any KnightCompanion his Executors were to send back such Copy to be deliver'd to the Custos or Warden  NO KnightCompanion was to go out of the Realm and Dominion of  England  without the Knowl  dge and Licence of the Sovereign who of Grace and Favour is bound to grant it upon a Military Expedition or other notable Act appertaining to the Honour of  Knighthood in Preference and Advancement of this Order of St  George  THEY were not to arm themselves against each other but in the Wars of their Sovereign Lord in his right and just Quarrel and if it happen'd that any of the Order should be retain'd in the Cause and Quarrel of any Lord and the adverse Party desir'd another KnightCompanion on his Side that latter Knight isby no means to agree but to excuse himself in all Things because his Fellow was armed on the other Side and was retain'd before him And every Knight was bound to except and agree at his being retain'd that he may have his Discharge from the Wars upon any of the Order's being engaged in Arms before him for the contrary Party and if the second retained knows not of it upon notice that any of his Fellows were retained before him and armed on the contrary Side the second retained Knight was to excuse himself to his Master and relinquish the Quarrel  ALL Licences given to the KnightCompanions to travel in quest of Honour by Military Exploits also all Certificates mandatous Letters Certificates and other Writings whatsoever relating to the Order were to be issued out by the Sovereign under the Seal of the Order to remain in the keeping of one of the Order during the Sovereign's Pleasure And if the Keeper of the Seal absent himself upon reasonable Cause he was to leave the Seal with another of the Fellowship that the Sovereign should appoint to the Intent that the Seal at no time be out of the Presence of the Sovereign he being within his Dominion And in like manner concerning the Seal in the Absence of the Sovereign or the Deputy  IF any KnightCompanion for Devotion sake should desire to dwell at  Windsor  he was to maintain himself at his own and not at the College Charge  ANY other Knight not of the Order upon the Account of Devotion that would reside there was to be provided for at the Appointment of the Sovereign and the Fellowship also Any Knight or other Person giving  l  yearly Rents or Lands or more to the College to participat  of their Prayers and Suffrages  he was to be registred in the Calendar of Benefactors and continually be pray'd for by the Canons and Poor Knights  UPON the Death of any Canon the Custos or Warden is to certify the same by Letters to the Sovereign if beyond Sea to know whom he pleases to present to the Canonship  THERE was to be a Register appointed by the Sovereign and Fellowship the most intelligent Person of the College who was to be present at the Chapters to record their Elections and the Electors their Punishments and Causes of them with their Reconciliations all Acts whatsoever administred in their Council from Chapter to Chapter yearly for the faithful Execution of which Office he was to be sworn at his Admission therein and whatsoever had been register'd was in the Beginning of the following Chapter on the Vigils of St  George  to be publickly recited before the Sovereign and the whole Fellowship that what was amiss and incorrect might be mended and reduced to due Form  § BESIDES these Statutes there are Two other Bodies or Exemplars establish'd since the one by King  Henry  V the other by King  Hen  VIII King  Henry  V finding the Glory of the Order declining removed the Grand Festival and other Solemnities and commanded a strict Observation of all the Founder's Statutes and brought many more to like Perfection which he subjoined to such of them where they might be prop  rly and are as follow  To Article  That the Knights should mark their Obeisance in the Choir first to the Altar and next to the Sovereign or in his Absence to his Stall  THAT the Deputy should  lect if the Sovereign when abroad had not Six Knights with him  THAT the Feast of St  George  should not be kept upon St  Mark  's Day nor the Days of St  Philip  and  Jacob  nor of the  Holy Cross neither upon any Days whic  should happen in the Festivals of th Ascension or Pentecost or other solem  Feasts ordained by the Church to the in+terrupting their Divine Service  THAT when a Knight should rid  out he might wear a Blue Silk Ribbon in+stead of his Garter  THAT the Order and Manner o  Offering up the Atchievements should b  as is there prescribed  viz  before the  offer their Money their Swords should b  first offered by Two Companions which the Sovereign or his Deputy should appoint and afterwards their Helmets with their Crests by Two others of the Order  THAT Knights absent in the Sovereign's Service might be install'd by Deputy  THAT the Sovereign should take a Signet of the Order abroad with him to be fixed to all the Acts he does in Foreign Parts relating to this Order in Distinction to those done at home  THAT no Charge should be admitted upon the College by the Custos or Canons without the Sovereign's Consent likewise  THE Statutes with these Additions as the Statutes of Institution this King caused to be translated into  French  and transcribed into a Roll which was ordered to be presented to every KnightCompanion under the common Seal of the Order In after Times it was transcribed into Books and by a Decree  Anno  Hen  VII an Original Book of these Statutes and Institution  fair written was to be reposed in the College of St  G  org    and the Scribe or Register to have Transcripts of them in Readiness to present the elected Knights withal  THE last and largest Body was first began and received the finishing S  roke by King  Hen  VIII chiefly in regard some of the former Statutes wanted Explication  and others Contraction And for the compleating of which Purpose on St  George  's Day  Anno    Regni sui  he summoned all the KnightsCompanions to convene next Year at the Time of the Solemnity about the Abrogation of what tended to darken the Honour of this Order if any such were and for the Advancement of what might promote the Grandeur and Lustre of it But these Resolves came to no Perfection till  May    Anno    Regni sui  when he entred upon this Reformation with all magnificent Ceremony imaginable for being accompanied with Nineteen KnightsCompanions of the Order proceeding in Cavalcade to the ChapterHouse and taking into Consideration their former Statutes of KnightsCompanions with all due Reverence implor'd the Sovereign to reform and explain them as he should think convenient which he brought to a successful Period by the Advice and Consent of the Society assembled That done all present entreated the Sovereign kneeling that where any of them had been peccant against the Order he would please to remit and issue out a general Pardon which he granted and ratify'd in Chapter next Day This was a Task of Three Years compleat before it rose to Perfection  viz April    Anno    Hen  VIII for then the Sovereign out of right singular Love welltemper'd Zeal and entire Affection to this most noble Order to the Estate of Chivalry and the Continuance and Encrease thereof as also at the humble Request and instant Importunity of the then KnightsCompanions and by their Advice Counsel and Consent did interpret and elucidate all the Obscurities Doubts and Ambiguities of the former Statutes and Ordinances Divers Affairs contain'd in Fifty of them being explain'd and amended he made likewise necessary Additions the Original whereof being sign'd and seal'd were commanded to be carefully laid up in the Treasury of  Windsor  College to remain as a Standard to succeeding Times yet they have not been seen there these many Years past  THE Articles and Clauses added to the former Sta  utes in this last Body are these  To Article  THAT the Interpretation of the Statutes c belongeth to the Sovereign  THE Three Points of Reproach declar'd and what is meant by a Gentleman of Blood  OF the Prerogative of the Feast  HOW the Feast is to be observed by absent Knights  ATTENDANCE on the Sovereign if he be not at the Feast  THAT the Sovereign's Deputy may correct Things in Chapter  THE offering up of Atchievements and a Taper arm'd with an Escutcheon  CANONS to sit in the lower Stalls when any Knights are present  THAT Six Knights make a Chapter  THE Manner of Installation set down  CLAUSE for a Foreign Knight's Deputy to be conducted from the ChapterHouse to the Stall and for making an Election void if the Knight send not his Proxy within Seven Months  FOR advancing and translating of Stalls  PLATES not to be larger than the first Founders except Strangers  THE Time Three Months prefix'd for the Executor of a deceas'd KnightCompanion to send back the Copy of the Orders deliver'd to him at his Admission which might be also sent to one of the principal Officers of the Order  CONCERNING the Collar of the Order  THIS Body of Statutes was compil'd in  Latin  and is recorded in the  Black Book  of the Order It was translated into  French  and  English  by Sir  Thomas Wriothesl  y  Kt then Garter King of Arms The  English  Version annex'd here to this Treatise is what hath since been deliver'd instead of the former Statutes to all succeeding KnightsCompanions according to the Injunction but of late Times appointed to be sent to Foreign Princes and other elect Knights abroad sealed with the Great Seal of the Order affix'd to a Label of Blue Silk and Gold  § THERE have been several Endeavours since the Reign of King  Henry  VIII for reforming the Statutes As first King  Edward  VI who as Sovereign by the Orders themselves had an undoubted Prerogative set him to alter and reform many Things which seem'd inconsistent with the Religion he establish'd To which Purpose at a Chapter at  Greenwich  held  April  in the Third Year of his Reign the Lord  St John  the Earl of  Arundel  and Sir  William Paget  were to peruse and make them agreeable to the King's other Proceedings by the Assistance and Advice of the Protector the Duke of  Somerset  and other Companions This was follow'd by a subsequent Order pass'd in the Cha  ter at  Greenwich  the Year after that the Statutes should be reform'd and corrected as they thought expedient And for the better Accomplishment of their Design at the next Feast  April    Edw  VI another Order commenc'd impowering the Duke of  Somerset  the Marquess of  Northampton  the Earls of  Warwick Arundel Bedford  and  Wi  ts  to peruse and amend the Statures and other Books of the Order which were brought to some tolerable Degree of Perfection for thereupon a new Body was collected in general very much altering the Laws of the Order and publish'd  March    Anno    Edw  VI But this King within Four Months after expiring Queen  Mary  his Sister and Successor the very first Thing she transacted was to abrogate and make them void wherefore we need not mention them as never in use and unrevived For the Execution of which Purpose she conven'd a Chapter at St  James  's the th of  September  following and it was then decreed that the said Laws and Ordinances as inconvenient impertinent and tending to Novelty  should be disannulled and no Account to be made of them for the future and for the quicker Execution Sir  William Petre  that Day admitted Chancellor had Orders to see them speedily expung'd out of the Book of Statutes and forthwith defac'd lest any Memory of them should remain to Posterity and only those of her Father  Hen  VIII and his Royal Predecessors should be retain'd  IN this Affair King  Philip  her Husband appear'd no less zealous for on the th of  August  and  Philip  and  Mary  which was the d Day after he had been invested with the Habit himself being present at a Chapter at  Windsor  it was ordain'd That all Acts and Decrees in the Great Book  ie  the  Black Book  aforesaid which were repugnant and disagreeable either with the ancient and receiv'd Statutes of the Order or else with the Laws of the Realm should clearly be abolish'd and erased by the Marquis of  Winchester  the Earls of  Arund  l Pembroke  and the Lord  Paget  No sooner was Queen  Elizabeth  fix'd on the Throne but soon after  viz  on St  George  's Day in the second Year of her Reign a View of the Statutes was committed by Commission to Four of the KnightsCompanions  viz  the Marquis of  Northampton  the Earls of  Arundel  and  Pembroke  and the Lord  Howard  of  Effingham  who were thereby impower'd to peruse and consider those Statutes with the utmost Care and regard if any of them were repugnant to the Religion Laws and Statutes of the Realm and if any such were recorded to represent them faithfully to the Sover  ign that she in Conjunction with the KnightsCompanions might establish such Decrees concerning them as she should think sit but that any thing was done in pursuance hereunto doth not appear for the Transcripts of her Father's Body of the Statutes throughout the Time of her Reign were presented to the Kn  ghtsCompanions at their Instailations and the Practice of her Time was pursuant to the Direction therein except in some few Things now and then added or alter'd at future Chapters when there arose fresh Matters for such Expedients  KING  James  I her Successor revolv'd something towards a new Regulation and in order to put it in Execution the th of  May  in the th Year of his Reign decreed That Commissionary Letters should be granted to the Earls of  Nottingham Worcester Pembroke  and  Northampton  to empower them to examine the Registers and other Monuments which pertained to that Order and where any Passage should be found obsolete or obscure to make it conspicuous and clear where Contrariety appear'd fitly to reconcile it yet with no Design of innovating any Thing but an Intention of renewing all as near as might be to the first Standard and most ancient Institution of the Order saving always Power to himself as Sovereign of the Order to add or diminish any Matter according to the Occasion as it should seem agreeable to his Prudence for the Honour of this Most Noble Order What Progress they made in this Commission the Memoirs of that Time are  silent in but some few Years after this Affair was reviv'd and another was issu'd forth to the Earls of  Nottingham Worc  ster Southampton Arundel  and  Montgomery  and the Viscount  Lisle  all KnightsCompanions dated  April  in the th Year of his Reign which Six or any Four of them were thereby constituted to take an exact Survey of all the ancient Statutes and Articles of the said Order and authoriz'd to call before them all such Persons whether Officers of the said Order or others as could give any Light or Information concerning that Affair and after a serious Deliberation to pen down what in them they conceiv'd meet to be explain'd and what to be added whereby to render the Order more illustrious that the same being presented to the Sovereign and the Society at a Chapter holden might be resolv'd on in part or in all to be put in Ex  cution if it seem'd so good to that King  THIS Affair mov'd very slowly but towards the latter End of his Reign the Earls of  Worcester Montgomery Arundel Surry  and  Le  cester  Five of the Six Commissioners abovenam'd having held divers Conferences and debated several Matters represented to them and at a Chapter convened at  Whitehall  the th  of  May Anno    Jac  I did present to the Sovereign certain Articles subscribed with their Hands which for the Honour of the Order they thought requisite to be duly observ'd  BY the first of which they made Provision for a further Progression and Advancement of the illustrious Institution in proposing that every Year a Commission from the Sovereign should be granted or continu'd to such Knights of the Order as the Chapter should pitch on to deliberate and weigh all Affairs that fell under the Order and that the Year after an Estimate by the Knights in Chapter should be exhibited of their Resolutions and Proceedings by Virtue of the said Commission This with Eight other Articles were confirm'd by the Sovereign and Twelve of the KnightsCompanions the d of  May  following in a Chapter held at  Whitehall  and so prosperously their Endeavours succeeded that on the Feastday of St  George  at  Windsor  in the ensuing Year the Earl of  Worcester  being then the SovereignDeputy with Ten KnightsCompanions more gave their assent to Eight other Articles most of them concerning the AlmsKnights which the Morning after had the Approbation of the Sovereign and before the Celebration of Divine Service by his Deputy and Companions assembled in the ChapterHouse the Observation thereof was duly decreed  KING  Charles  I design'd and endeavour'd the most compleat and absolute Reformation of any of his Predecessors and at the Solemnity of St  George  held at  Windsor  the th of  October  in the th Year of his Reign He commission'd Nine KnightsCompanions  viz  the Earls of  Mulgrave Pembroke Montgomery Arund  l Surry Salisbury Carlisle Dorset Holland Berkshire  and  Suffolk  with command to assemble Four Times in a Year to take into their Consideration the Affairs of the Order all which but the Earls of  Mulgrave  and  Dorset  met at  Whitehall  the d of  January  following where some few Matters fell under their Consultation This Commission was seconded by one of a larger extent about Three Months after and directed to the said KnightsCompanions or to any Eight Seven Six Five or Four of them empowering them to meet and devise  and exactly preponderate all the Statutes and Ordinances of the Order as well such as were established at the Foundation as those that had been since made by Explanation or Addition and to weigh advisedly whether any Thing had been enacted that had caused Doubt or Ambiguity or stood in need of any Change or Amendment and if upon mature Deliberation by them thus conven'd there should appear any Contrariety or Defect for want of plain Expression or other Omission fit to be supplied tending to the Honour of the Order That then the Sovereign might upon Return of their Proceedings resolve upon some general Declaration in Chapter to reform and reduce into one Body all the Statutes and Ordinances thereof that the same being compil'd and settled in one perfect Model might be so consign'd to Posterity free from all future Questions and Doubts  NEVER THELESS not any thing was done upon this Commission tho' it stood in force even from the th to the th Year of this King's Reign but where the Neglect lay History does not fully inform us tho' it may be conjectur'd by what follows  AT the Feast of St  G  orge  celebrated by Prorogation at  Whitehall  for the Year upon the th th and th Days of  April  divers Petitions for Reformation and reducing of Matters to their pristine Constitution were presented to the Sovereign by the Chancellor and read some of which more especially tending to set off and encrease the Honour of the Order were received and decreed by the Sovereign and the rest referr'd to the said KnightsCommissioners The first of those Decrees which at that time had its Sanction was to revive and renew the Powers given in the former Commission and thereupon a new one dated the th of  May  following was issued under the Great Seal of the Order and directed to the Earls of  Mulgrave Darby Pembroke  and  Montgomery Arundel  and  Surry Kelly Salisbury Dorset Holland Barkshire Suffolk Lyndsey Exeter  Marquiss  Hamilton  Duke of  Lenox  the Earls of  Darby Moreton  and  Northumberland  or to Three or more of them to meet and consult of any Matters contain'd in the Statutes or for Honour of  the Order These KnightsCommissioners were endow'd with all the plenary Powers given in the foresaid Commission dated  Car  I unto which was granted a further Addition for the better effecting the Sovereign's Care That Three or more of them should meet at the Sovereign's Court and begin to put the said Commission in execution in  Whitson  Week next ensuing attended and assisted by the Chancellor of the Order and all or any other Officers or such of them as they should fix on or find serviceable And being assembled to have free Liberty to hear propound and debate of whatsoever shall fall under their Cognisance or that they should conceive conducible to the Honour and perfect Establishment of so Illustrious and Noble a Body And to prepare all Matters of such their Resolutions and Debates to be laid before the Sovereign at the next Feast of St  George  and so successively at every Chapter so appointed by him to receive his full Determination Approbation and Royal Assent with further Power to adjourn from time to time after the first Opening and Reading of the said Commission their Meetings to be in such Places and on such Days as should seem most convenient to them  NOW who wou'd suppose that after so Noble an Intention of the Sovereign and his earnest Solicitude to issue forth a second Commission his hearty recommending and exciting their Deligence for a speedy Dispatch and lastly his expecting an Account of their Transactions the next Feast these honourable Persons Companions of the Order should need a Spur to accomplish so laudable a Design but it was so  FOR altho' the Commission was opened at  Whitehall  the th of  May  following in the Presence of the Earls of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery Salishury Holland  Marquiss of  Hamilton  and Duke of  Lenox  Commissioners yet Sir  Thomas Row  Chancellor in his Letter to Dr  Christopher Wren  dated the th of  June  sadly complained That it was much as he could do to draw together Five of the KnightsCompanions to open and read the Commission and this  quasi in  ransi    was in Confusion and Hurry and all that was transacted was to appoint another Convention at Court in  M  summer  Week then next ensuing and charge the Chancellor to prepare Matter for Propositions and Observations upon the Statutes fit for their Consultations against that Appointment according to the Tenor of the Commission And in another Place writes That he found such Difficulty to procure Meetings and as certain  non Chalance  in every one as if it were but a ceremonious Affair and so few hearty in it that he feared he and the Officers should wait to little Purpose And so indeed it fell out for albeit he att  nded in  Midsummer  Week according to their Direction yet there was nothing dispatch'd save only the adjourning of their Meeting to  London  SOME little Progress was afterwards made in this Affair at  Whitehall  the th of  February  following where Three of them were present  viz  the Earls of  B  rkshire Lindsey  and  Northumberland  who order'd the Chancellor Register and Garter to prepare an Abbreviation of the Statutes and reduce every thing of one Head into an Act to keep up to Method and avoid Confusion  THE st of  February  after another Assembly of Seven of the KnightsCommissioners was held at  Whitehall  in whose Presence a few Points were debated but little or nothing concluded  § As concerning the Annals of the Order or the Books wherein the several Resolutions and Decrees occasionally made in Chapters and wherein other historical and ceremonial Matters relating to it are recorded  t will not be amiss to give some Account of them in this Place  THE first in Order of time is an old Paper Book written in  French  call'd  Registrum Chartaceum  hitherto fortunately preserv'd in the Paper Office at  Whitehall  which probably was b  gun by  John Coningham  for we find him a little before the Annals commenced made Canon of  Windsor  and Register of the Order and in regard the same HandWriting is carry'd on from the Beginning of the Book down to  Hen  VI inclusive where follows an  Hi  tus  till  Anno    Hen  VI that the Annals began to be set down with another  Hand and that he shortly after died in Henceforward these Annals are entred with promiscuous Hands which may be presumed the proper HandWritings of the Registers of this Noble Order as they succeeded each other in the Office  AFTER we find  Richard Sidnor  mention'd in the Register  Anno    Hen  VIII who subscribed his Name at the foot of every Leaf the Annals were pen'd in one Hand until  Anno    Hen  VIII that  Robert A  drydge  D D and one of the Canons of  Windsor  succeeded him and then 'tis evident the Writing also was changed to an old set  Roman  Hand which ran on to the End of  Hen  VIII in which Year he was advanced to the Bishoprick of  Carlisle  and this Book breaks off in the st of his Reign  BESIDES this there is another Book that goes by the Name of the  Black Book  wherein the Annals of the Order are transcribed in  Latin  concerning which there pass'd a Decree  Anno    Hen  VII that it should be fairly copy'd out and afterwards that the Sovereign should be put in Remembrance of it but neither of these Decrees was put in execution nor was this confirm'd till towards the End of the Reign of King  Henry  VIII This Book differs very little from the  Registrum Chartaceum  for therein is nothing enrolled relating to the Order except one of the Exemplars of the Founders Statutes and a Catalogue of the first Twentyfive KnightsCompanions before the th Year of King  Henry  V the Annals of the Order until that time being entirely lost It hath the same Hiatus or Intervals from to  Hen  VI from to of  Edw  from to  Hen  VII and from to  Hen  It also runs parallel therewith for the most part and that it was compil'd by Dr  Aldrydge  whilst he continu'd Register is collected from some Passages in the Preface of all the Sovereigns ending with King  Henry  VIII The Transcription of this Book was finish'd  Anno    Hen  VIII for so far is written as also the Appendix with one and the same Hand in a middlesiz'd Text but  Anno    Hen  VIII another Hand appears which with some Variation is continu'd to the End of  Edw  VI where this Book breaks off  THE Register of the Order was oblig'd to provide Two Books and therein to enter the Ordinances Statutes and Acts of this Noble Corporation one to be lodg'd at the Chapter House at  Windsor  and call'd  Index Windesoriensis  and the other being a Duplicate of the former to remain in his own Custody ready to expose to the View of the Sovereign whensoever he should demand it this latter was called  Aulae Registrum  AS to the general Directions for Compiling these Books and the Particulars they are to consist of we are inform'd from the said Statutes and Constitutions for besides the Entry of all the Scrutinies taken in Chapter and Elections made thereupon it is his Office to record the Penalties inflicted on KnightsCompanions and the Reconciliation of all Delinquents with other Acts and their Causes appertaining to the Order all which are decreed to be recited before the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions at the Beginning of the Chapter yearly if Occasion be to correct and reduce into Method Moreover he is to record all the Policies in War Exploits Transactions and memorable Atchievements both of the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions according as he can best attain the Knowledge of them by his own diligent Search or the Assistance of Mr Garter which having consign'd to Writing from Year to Year is to be perused at the next Chapter by the KnightsCompanions for their Approbation and Correction and being reiterated the second time in the Chapter he is to see that they be fairly engrossed in the said Book for a perpetual Remembrance  AND because the time perfix'd for Rehearsal of these Particulars in Chapter had in succeeding Years been imploy'd in other Affairs In one of those Articles which the KnightsCompanions exhibited to King  Jac  I the th of  May Anno Jac  R and ratified the d of  May  following it was decreed that nothing of this Nature or any other Act in Chapter should be registred before it had been perus'd and pass'd the Consideration of the then KnightsCompanions or at least Four of them who when they should set Times apart to consult of the Affairs of this Order for which  they were chiefly commission'd might then also make Use of such Opportunities as should give this Business Dispatch with more Conveniency Upon mature Consideration had of those Injunctions the then Register at a Chapter held  Nov    Car  II presented the Continuation of the Annals of this Order which he had ranged in order to register in the  Liber Carolinus  and submitted them to the Approbation of the KnightsCompanions whom the Sovereign had commission'd to inspect the Affairs of the Order which Tender when they declin'd he propos'd that it might pass the Examination of the Prelate but they not giving the ir Assent to it in regard the Register himself was under the Obligation of an Oath to deal with the utmost Fidelity in his Reports it was decreed That the said Annals should be fairly recorded in the Book without any further Inspection  BESIDES the abovemention'd Particulars there were Materials of another Nature decreed to be collected by the Chancellor of the Order and Garter King of Arms to be digested first and after entred by the Register for whereas one part of the Chancellor's Duty was to make a Narration every Year in Chapter at the Feast of St  George  of the illustrious Exploits of the KnightsCompanions as well as the Actions that tend to eclipse their Glory so the Register was to note these and record them from a perpetual Aera or Memorial of their Honour or Disgrace  AND it is part of Garter's Duty diligently to enquire after the Valiant Fortunate and Renown'd Acts both of the Sovereign and the rest of the KnightsCompanions and relate them with all Exactness to the Register for his Engrossing But how sparingly these are put in execution the Annals themselves bear witness However Sir  Edward Walker  GarterKing has drawn up an Account of the shining Actions and Characters of the KnightsCompanions beginning with  Thomas  Earl of  Strafford  and continuing it down to his Son which he deliver'd Dr  Ryves  the Register for the Use aforedirected  AMONG the Articles establish'd at the Feast of St  George    Jac  I the last is That the then Register  should compose a Book wherein should be orderly transcribed the Form and Manner of all the Solemn  ties Ceremonies and Processions at the Celebration of the Order as also of taking down and offering the defunct Knight's A  chievements that the KnightsCompanions might have free Recourse to it but such Book never was extant  For the Safety and Preservation of the  Annals  the KnightsCommissioners determined the d of  May An Jac  I That a secure and convenient Place within the Castle of  Windsor  should be appointed in which all Acts concerning the Order should be reposed and to which every KnightCompanion at all times might have access And upon the Remove or Decease of the Register of the Order the Book containing the Account of all such Transactions should be committed to one of the Knights of the Order  The second of these Books is called the  Blue Book  so call'd being bound in Blue Velvet it begins with the first Year of Queen  Mary  and ends at the th of King  Jac  I  The third being bound in Red Velvet is denominated the  Red Book  it commences where the  Blue Book  leaves off and treats of the like Acts and Entries and is carry'd down to  Car  I having first given a full Account of the Installation of the Prince afterwards King  Charles  II And as to great part of this Work it was perform'd by the elegant and judicious Dr  Matthew Wren  Bishop of  Ely  and Register of the Order whose excellent Pattern his Brother and Successor Dr  Christopher W  en  hath copy'd in its following Tract This Bishop compiled a MS  A D  wherein by way of Comment upon King  Henry  VIII's Statutes he hath com  endiously shewn what Alteration there hath passed in the Law of the Garter a Work performed with great Judgment and exce  dingly useful to the Curious  The fourth and last Book is  Liber Carolinus  and commences wherein the  Annals  are brought down to the beginning of by  Ryves  then Register And in a Chapter conven'd at  Windsor  the th of  April Anno    Car  II it was decreed That there should be Two of these Books compiled the one printed in  Latin  in the Custos of the Register at  Windsor  and the other in  English  to be reserv'd at  Whitehall  and call'd  Registrum Aulicum  CAP VII The  Habit  and  Ensigns  of the Order  THE Habit and Ensigns of this most Noble Order are most eminently distinguishable and magnificent and consist of these Particulars  viz  Garter Mantle Surcoat Hood George and Collar for as the  Romans  were very exact and particular in assigning each Degree a peculiar Habit and Vesture by which the Quality and Rank of their Citizens might be discernable the Distinction of Apparel was afterwards taken up by divers other Nations whence every Military as well as Ecclesiastick Order of Knighthood did appropriate to it self a peculiar Dress Ensign or Badge as a Mark of Distinction one from another to set off the Lustre and Honour of their several Societies  The four first  viz  the Garter Mantle Surcoar and Hood were assigned the Knights Companions by the Founder and the George and Collar by King  Henry  VIII and all these together are called the whole Habit or Ensigns of the Order which we shall treat of succinctly beginning with the Garter  The Royal Garter challengeth the Preheminence for from it this famous Order receiv'd its Denomination It is the first part of the Habit presented to Foreign Princes  nd Absent Knights and that wherewith they and all other elect Knights are first adorn'd and of so great Honour and Grandeur that by the bare Investiture with this Noble Ensign the Knights are esteem'd Companions of the greatest Military Order in the World  The Materials whereof it was compos'd at first is an  A  canum  nor is it described by any before  Polydore Vi  gil  and he but in general As to the ornamental Part of it it was adorn'd with Gold and precious Stones and had a Buckle of Gold at the End to fasten it about  The Garter  The Sovereigns Mantle  Hood  Surcoat  The Collar and Great George  Ribbond George  A Knight Companions Mantle  Cap and Feather  To the Illustrious Potent most Noble Henry Duke Marq  ss  Earl of Kent etc Constable Gov  r  of His Maies  •  Royal Castle Hon  r  of Windsor Lord L  •  of the County of Bed  d  Custos Rotulorū for the same  Bedchamber of y  e  most  Priuy Council to his Majes  •  and K  t  of y  e  most Noble Order of y  e  Gar  r  this Plate is humbly Inscribed  M  Gucht Scul  the Leg but there's no doubt but it was wrought with rich Embroidery and the Motto rais'd with Gold Pearl and sundry Sorts of Silk as may be guess'd from the Garters anciently plac'd on the left side of the KnightsCompanions Mantles and those other little embroider'd Garters wherewith their Surcoats and Hoods were heretofore embellish'd  BUT of those wrought in the last Age we have more particular Satisfaction for we find the Garter sent to  Emanuel  Duke of  Savoy Anno  and  Philip  and  Mary  was set with Letters of Goldsmith's Work the Buckle and Pendant of the same and on the Pendant a Ruby and a Pearl hanging at the End The Garter made for  Francis  II  Anno    Elizabeth  was richly wrought with Letters of Gold set off and garnish'd with Stones the Buckle and Pendant weighing Three Ounces and an halfquarter was richly set with Rubies and Diamonds The  French  King  Henry  IV had a Garter of Purple Velvet embroider'd with Letters of Gold and deck'd out with Diamonds and Rubies And the Garter of  Christian  IV King of  Denmark  was embroider'd with Gold and Pearls But that Garter sent to  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  outvied all others conferr'd by former Sovereigns each Letter of the Motto being compos'd of small Diamonds and for every Stop a Diamond within a Range of Diamonds above and below on the sides of the Garter and besides other Diamonds on the Buckle and about the same to the Number in all of  THE Garter which King  Charles  I wore upon his Leg at the Time of his Martyrdom had the Letters of the Motto compos'd likewise of Diamonds which amounted to the Number of It came to the Hands of Captain  Preston  one of the Usurper's Captains from whom the Trustees for Sale of the King's Goods receiv'd it and sold it to  Ireton  sometimes Lord Mayor of  London  for  l  But after the Restoration the King's AttorneyGeneral proceeding upon an Action of  Trover  and  Conversion  Verdict was given for the King against him for  l  and  l  costs of Suits in  Trinity  Term  Car  II  THE Motto of King  Charles  II was set with Diamonds upon Blue Velvet and the Borders wrought with fine Gold Wire the Diamonds which framed the Letters of the Motto were Rose Diamonds much of a Size or Proportion but those which framed the Stops TableDiamonds the Total which set each Letter compos'd the Stops Ilot Holes and adorn'd the Buckle the Table was Two Hundred and Fifty the Hinge of the Buckle was pure Gold and on it the Sovereign's Picture to the Breast curiously cut in Flatstitch crown'd with a Laurel and the military Garb of the first  Roman  Emperors the Table or Pendant was Gold and on the backside thereof engrav'd St  George  on Horseback encountring the Dragon  THIS noble Ensign the Garter was at the Erection of the Order appointed to be wore on the left Leg a little beneath the Knee which Usage still presides And the placing it thus on the Sepulchral Portraictures of KnightsCompanions was an early Custom for on the Alabaster Monument of Sir  William Fitzwarin  who was interr'd in the Northside of the Chancel at  Wantage  in  Com Berks    Edw  III he lies there with his Surcoat of Arms upon his Breast and the Representation of a Garter but without Motto carv'd upon his left Leg In the same Posture lies Sir  Richard Pembridge  elected a KnightCompanion  temp Edw  III and is portraicted on his Monument in the Southside of the Cathedral of  Hereford  below the Pulpit and encompass'd with a Rail of IronSpikes  THE next Monument whereon the Garter was depicted was that erected for Sir  Simon Burley  beheaded  A D  and rear'd in the NorthWall near the Choir of St  Paul's London  Thenceforward the Practice became more frequent and then the Motto began to be cut thereon insomuch that it is now the constant and just Practice to do it whensoever the KnightsCompanions are exhibited in Effigies  AND altho' this Ensign was first design'd in Ornament to the left Leg yet it was not confin'd so solely thereto but was anciently us'd to incircle the Escutcheon of St  George  's Arms worn by the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions on their Mantles who within a  small space after us'd it to surround their own proper Coat of Arms which their Successors have retain'd as their peculiar Privilege permitting it to none but to their principal Officer the Prelate of the Order  THE first Example that occurs is the beforemention'd of Sir  Francis Burley  where on the Front towards the Head is his own Arms empaling his first Wife's set within a Garter wanting the Impress but another having the same Empalement plac'd below the Feet is surrounded with a Collar of SS of the same Form with that about his Neck  THE Monument also of  Joan  Wife of  Ralph Nevil  Earl of  Westmoreland  on the Southside of the Choir in the Cathedral of  Lincoln  bears the Arms of  Nevil  empaling those of  Joan  his Wife who dy'd  A D  Incircled within a Garter and fix'd on this Lady's Monument Daughter to  John  of  Gount  Duke of  Lancaster  is there such a Collar of SS placed about a Square but the Paint being faded was render'd unintelligible  ANOTHER antique Instance is that Escutcheon  Sable Three Ostrich Feathers Argent  surrounded with the Garter affix'd in the GlassWindows of  Greenwich  Church in  Kent  by  Humfrey  Duke of  Glocester  and supported with a Greyhound and an Antelope It is reported these Three Feathers were the Ensign of King  Henry  IV which were conferr'd by  John  of  Gaunt  his Father who bore them for his Device and placed in a  Field Sable  as here but the Pens were powder'd with  Ermin  for a difference from the Black Prince's Feather which were  Argent  as the King's Pen was  Or  and the Duke of  Somerset  's Compony  Argent  and  Azure  THE Arms of Sir  L  wis Robessart  Lord  Bourchier  KnightCompanion  t  mp  en  V we find encompass'd with a Garter on each side his Monument in  WestminsierAbbey  AT the Interment of  Richard  Duke of  York  Father to King  Edw  IV at every Corner of the MajestyEscutcheon set over the Image of the D  sunct was an Es  utcheon of the Arms of  France  and  gland quart  rly  and  our A  gels Gold  holding the same within a Garter And so some of the Funeral Es  utch  ons of  John  Viscount  Wells  who dy'd  Hen  VII were surrounded with the Garter as others bearing his Lady's Arms  AT the Interment of  Thomas  Duke of  Norfolk  in  ThetfordAbbey  who dy'd  Hen  VIII there was provided a Shield of his Arms within a Garter and a Coronet affix'd over it a Target also of the Arms of  George  Earl of  Shrewsbury  within a Garter was born at his Funural  Anno    Hen  VIII  IT was the Custom begun about the Reign of  Hen  VII when the Obsequies of any Foreign Prince were celebrated in  England  to paint an Escutcheon of such Prince's Arms within the Collar of the Order whereof he was Sovereign or a FellowCompanion as those of the  French  King  Charles  VIII celebrated at St  Paul  's  London  had Escutcheons of the Arms of  France  within the Collar of the Order of St  Michael  at each End of the Hearse and when the Obsequies of  John  King of  Portugal  were solemniz'd at St  Paul  's there was among others one large Escutcheon of his Arms within the Collar of the  Golden Fleece  The Funeral Rites of the Emperor  Charles  V being perform'd in  WestminsterAbbey  and  Dec  there were Ten great Escutcheons compass'd with Garters to shew he was a Fellow of this Order And upon the same Account where Princes were Sovereigns of one and Companions of another Order their Hearses were hung with Escutcheons of their Arms surrounded with the Collars or principal Badges of both those Orders as at the Interment of  Francis  I the  French  King celebrated at St  Paul  's  London    Edw  VI the Escutcheons were the Arms of  France  encompass'd within the Garter of St  George  and Collar of St  Michael  At the Obsequies of  Hen  II of  France Anno    Eliz  at St  Paul  's also there were some Escutcheons of his Arms incircled both with the Garter and Collar of the  Golden Fleece  having been a KnightCompanion of both these Orders Under the Joysts was a Majesty Escutcheon of Black Taffaty of this King's Arms within a Garter crown'd with an Imperial Crown and in several Places of the Hearse were fasten'd other Escutcheons of his Arms within this principal Ensign of the Garter  KING  Hen  VIII was the first that introduc'd into his Great S  al the Eschutcheon of his Arms incircled within a Garter as may be seen placed on either side his Portraicture si  ting on his Royal Throne since him all succeeding Sovereigns have born their Arms after that Manner not only in their great and PrivySeals but in those other appertaining to their Courts of Justice and generally in all Matters where their Arms were visible except Coins in Imitation of whom the KnightCompanions have don  the like  BUT there were  An    Car  certain Half Crowns stamp'd in the West of  En  and  containing the Sovereigns Arms so encompassed regally crowned and supported and this was the first Money whereon the Royal Garter appeared After him King  Charles  II having an Eye to the Advancement of the Honour of this Order caused the irradicated Cross of St  George  encompass'd about with the Royal Garter to be publickly stamp'd in the Center of his Silver Coin struck upon the Recoinage of it  A  no    Car    THERE were other Medals heretofore stamp'd upon several Occasions wherein the G  rter was designedly express'd and enclosing Shields of their Arms as that in the Year  Frederick  Prince  Palatine  of the  Rhine  was crowned King of  o  em  a  and  Robert Cecil  Earl of  Salisbury  created Lord Treasurer both Knights Companions of this Noble Order Moreover Gold Rings have been cast into the Figures of Garters the Ground on the outside enamell'd with a deep Blue through which the golden Letters of the Motto appearing set them off with an admirable Beauty And it seems such Rings were in vogue since the Preface to the black Book of the Order makes mention of wearing the Garter on the Leg and Shoulder and sometimes likewise subo ins the Thumb  interdum Pollice gestare  by which we may naturally conjecture that Gold Rings were formed into the Fashion of Garters and bestowed by some new installed Knights upon their Relations and Friends to wear in Memorial of so great an Honour conferred upon them  AMONG the Officers belonging to the Order the Prelate is permitted to bear h  s proper Arms impaled with  those of his See within the Garter and the rest only to wear the Badges of their Offices surrounded with the same to express their peculiar Relation  BESIDES the Manner of bearing Arms within the Garter of this Order the Garter either in whole or part hath been by Way of Armory but without the Motto as in the Seal belonging to the Office of Garter King of Arms where the Garter enclosing a Crown is placed on a Chief between a  Lyon  of  England  and a  Flower de Lys  of  France  And to instance in Family we find Argent Three  DemyGarters Azure  buckled and garnished  Or  granted by King  Hen  VII to his Servant  Peter Nerborne  and sable a Garter  Or  between Three Buckles of the Second to be born by  Buckland  or  Bowland in Com Northampton  § THE second Ensign of the Order is the  Mantle  which is the Chief of those Vestments which the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions make use of upon all solemn Occasions relating to the Order That this Pattern was derived to us from the ancient  Greeks  and  Romans  is not at all to be disputed since it so little varies in Fashion from their  Pallium  or  Toga  for the  Grecian  Pallium was a sort of long Cloak which only wanted a Collar or Cape and the  Roman Toga  as proper to them as the  Pallium  to the  Grecians  and the Custom as Antique as  Romulus  himself for he is recited by  Plutarch  to have worn it The Pallium is more fully described to be a kind of upper Robe that covered the whole Body made fast on the right Shoulder with a Fibula or Clasp It was usually worn over the Tunica or short Coat whence the Proverb  Tunica Pallio propior  and is more particularly observed to have been a Garment fashioned without Sleeves that reached down to the Ancles  IN describing this upper Robe called the  Mantle  the Sovereigns being distinguished from the KnightsCompanions only by a long Train we shall first set down its various Appellations it is mentioned by in the Records of the Order Secondly the Materials whereof it consists Thirdly the Colour Fourthly the Quantity and last of all the Ornamental Trimmings that nothing be omitted to satisfy any curious Enquirer  NAME  IN the Founder's Statutes it is called  Mantellum  and in  Hen  V  Manteau  both which we render  Mantle  But the Exemplar of the Founder's Statutes entred in the black Book and the Statutes of King  Henry  VIII call it  Trabea  which  Rosinus  reckons among the different Kinds of  Mantles  or  Gow  s  And in  Art  of King  Hen  VIIIth's Statutes it is applied both to the  Mantle  and  Surcoat  sometime it is stiled  Chlamyda  sometime  Stola  but in other Places more pertinently  Pallium  and  Toga  MATERIALS  THAT Mantle prepared for the Founder against the first Feast of this Order appears to be fine Woollen Cloth and it is not improbable this Material was chosen rather than any other richer to the Intent the Founder might give the Preference to our native Commodity altho' there's permitted in the Statutes of Institution a permission for the Proxies of Foreign Princes to bring over with them Mantle  of Silk and Velvet when they came to receive possession of their Principal Stalls either because other Countries were better stored with such Commodities than our  English  Cloth or that it might be more agreeable to represent the State and Grandeur of Foreign Princes  as accounting Silk or Velvet the nobler Representation  WHAT Duration the wearing Cloth had is not directly set down but the first time we discover their Man  les to be of Velvet is about the beginning of the Reign of King  H  n  VI which Sort of Silk hath thence remained until this Day About this Period 'tis observed that the Mantles of Foreign Princes were made here of Velvet for so was that tr  nsmitted to the King of  Portugal  elected  Anno  Concerning the Mantles of the KnightsCompanions there is no doubt but they were of the same Materials with those made for the Sovereign  viz  at first of fine Woollen Cloth and when the Sovereign exchanged it for Velvet they followed his Example but we cannot meet with equal Satisfaction in this Point because the KnightsCompanions provided this Robe at their own Expence and  their private Accounts herein passing thro' so many Contingences were of no great Durability But their Surcoats were of the Sovereigns Donation and consequently the Particulars of them remain on Record in the Rolls and Accounts of the great Wardrobe  THE Colour of these Mantles is appointed by the Statutes to be Blue and of this Colour was the Founders by which as by the Groundwork of the Royal Garter it is not improbable he alluded to the Colour of the Field in the  French  Arms which a few Years before he began to Quarter with those of  England  But the Colour of the Surcoat was changed every Year as will appear by and by Of the same Colour were the Velvet Mantles made  temp Hen  VI who tho' he altered the Stuff did not vary the Dye It is apparent that the blue Colour was retained to King  Edw  IVth's Reign for when this Sovereign transmitted the Habit and Ensigns of the Order to  Julian de Medicis  the Mantle was of blue Velvet  BUT in King  Hen  VIIIth's Statutes there's no mention at all of the Colour of this upper Robe save only of the  Mantle  which the Proxy of a Foreign Prince was enjoined to bring with him when he came to assume the Stall of his Principal which tho' it does not come directly up to the Poin  yet it is to be observed to be of blue Velvet And it's highly probab  e that the blue Colour remained still to be used for within a few Months after the compiling the said Statut  s it's plain the Mantle sent to  James  King of  Scotland  was of blue Velvet and in the ancient Form of Admoniti  n and Signification appointed to be spoke at the Investiture of Foreign Princes and then in Plea it is called  the Mantle of celest  al  ol  ur  Likewise the Mantle sent to  Duke of  Savoy  and  Ph  and  Mar  was of the same Composur    IN Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign upon what Ground History is silent the Colour of Foreign Prince's Mantles was changed from Blue to Purple for of that Colour were the Mantles sent to the  French  Kings  Charles  IX  Anno    Eliz  and  Hen  III  Ann    Eliz  So also to the Emperor  Maximilian    Elizabeth  to  Fredrick  II King of  Denmark An    Eliz  to  Joh Casimire  Count Palatine of the  Rhine Anno    Eliz  to  Christiern  IV  King of  Denmark An J R  IV But that sent to  Fred  ruk  Duke of  Wirtemberg  in the same Year was a mix'd Co our of Purple and Violet  THUS the Purple Colour came in Request and continued till about the of King  Charles  I when he determining to restore the Colour of the Mantle to the primitive In  titution gave Directions to Mr  Peter Richaut  Merchant to provide himself with a Quantity of rich blue Velvets from  Genoa  and upon their arrival into  England  signify'd his Pleasure by Sir  Thomas Rowe  the Chancellor That all KnightsCompanions should purchase as much of the said Velvet as would furnish them with new Robes against St  George  'sDay next ensuing compliance to whose Will all the Knights paid Obedience at the Rate of Thirty seven Shillings a Yard being the Price the Sovereign paid to Mr  Richaut  for the Velvet of his own Robes And the first Essay of these Mantles was to honour the Installation of the Prince afterwards King  Charles  II  AND because there were many Knightselect to be installed after the Restoration it was ordained at the Chapter held at  Whitehall  the    th  of  Jan Anno    C  r  called to consider of the Preparations of the grand Feast then at hand That Directions should be given to the Master of the Wardrobe to negotiate Abroad for excellent Velvets of Skie Colour and Crimson and other Materials agreeable for the Mantles and Surcoats both of the old KnightsCompanions and those that were then to be installed which was accordingly effected and they were transmitted in time to accommod  te them at the said Feast  THO' the just Number of Ells of Cloth for the Sovereigns Mantle at the first Institution are not  et down yet in the Total for his Mantle Hood and Surcoat there was allowed ten Ells of long Cloth The Mantle of King  Henry  VI took up one Piece five Ells and three Quarters of blue Velvet and those sent to  Freder  ck  II and  Christian  IV Kings of  Denmark  and to the  French  King  Henry  III contained each twenty Yards of Velvet  THIS we find to be the Allowance for Foreign Princes and a  e the more full and extensive by reason of their  long Train which being more scanty in the Mantles of KnightsSubjects eig  teen Yards was sufficient to make one of them The full Length of King  Charles  II from the Collar behind to the end of the Train was three Yards the Length of the foreside one Yard and three Quarters from the Foot along the bottom to the fixing on of the Train was two Yards and from thence the Length or Compass of the Train two Yards  THE left Shoulder of each of these Mantles have from the Institution been adorned with a large fair Garter containing this Motto  Honi soit qui mal y pense  These were distinguished from the lesser Garters anciently embroider'd upon the Surcoats and Hoods of the Sovereigns and KnightsCompanions by the Name of  Garters Gross  WITHIN this Garter was the Arms of St  George viz  Argent a  Cross Gules  and was heretofore wrought in Sattin with Gold Silver and Silk but in descending Times greater Expence and Magnificence became the Practice of the Order for it was embordered upon Velvet with Damask Gold and sundry Sorts of Purls Plates  Venice  Twists and Silks and the Letters of the Motto and Borders of the Garter composed of fair Oriental Pearl The Garter fix'd upon the Mantle of King  Charles  II was encircled with large Oriental Pearl so were the Letters of the Motto and the Cross within the Garter the Diameter of which was seven Inches but the Depth from the upper Part to the end of the Pendant ten Inches  Temp Hen  VI it seems to have been the Mode to embellish the Mantle with three or four Velts drawn down the sides and round the bottom as it appears by the Monument of  John Tal  o  Earl  of  Shrewsbury  in the Southwall of the Chancel of  Whitechurch in Com Salop  ABOUT that Time the Lining of this Robe was white Damask and afterwards white Sattin but of later Date it was lined with white Taffaty which continues yet in vogue  FOR exemplary Ornament the Mantle had fixed to its Collar a pair of long Strings anciently woven of blue Silk only called  Cordons  Robestrings or Laces but  of later Days twisted round and made of  Venice  Gold and Silk of the Colour of the Robe at each end of which hung a great Knob or Button wrought over and raised with a rich Caul of Gold and Tassels thereunto of like Silk and Gold  AND at the Collar was usually fixed an Hook and Eye of Gold for its firmer affixing of it to the Shoulders  § The Third Ensign of the Order is the  Surcoat  or  Kirtle  which altho' we find no Place for it in the Founder's Statutes is nevertheless as ancient as the Mantle or upper Robe that is only taken Notice of there for such a Vesture King  Edward  III then made together with his Mantle and a Hood to celebrate the first Feast of the Order in  ITS Original it owes to the  Greeks  and  Romans  amongst whom this Garment had its determinated  Tunica  and was worn next under the  Toga  but amongst them was both narrower and shorter it was girt close to the Body with a Girdle and so fitted that the Hem of it reached a little below the Knee or to the middle of the Ham It was the proper Mode of the  Roman  Citizens and by its trimming were the three Degrees among them known for the Senators Tunicks were embroidered or purfled over with broad purple Studs the Knights with narrow ones and the Plebeians plain  IN setting forth the Surcoat which was heretofore annually bestowed by the Sovereign or the KnightsCompanions and therefore called his  Livery  we shall as in the Description of the Mantle treat somewhat of the Name Materials Colour Quantity and Garnishing of it  AS to the Name in the old Rolls of the great Wardrobe it is stiled  Roba  but more properly as the Founder's first Surcoat is called  Tunica  which Name it bears in the red Book of the Order In  English  it is rendred  Gown Kirtle Surcoat Undercoat  and  Robe  The Appellation of  Gown  is attributed to  Surcoats  of the Sovereigns and Foreign Princes  Temp Hen  VI  Edw  IV and  Hen  VII But since and very lately it hath been bestowed also on the Surcoats of KnightsCompanions and that of  Kirtle  sometimes given to those sent to Foreign  Princes as appears by the Books of Warrants in the great Wardrobe but the rest are Terms of a later Date As the first Mantles so the first Surcoats were composed of Woollen Cloth and tho' the Cloth of the Mantles was in some space after changed for Velvet yet the Surcoats continued afterwards to be of Cloth at least till after the Office of Chancellor of the Garter was erected by King  Edward  IV as is manifest by the Precedent of this Livery in the Sovereigns great Wardrobe but in process of Time they became Velvet which sort of Silk is yet retained  THE Colour of this Vesture was anciently changed every Year commonly into Blue Scarlet Sanguine in Grain or White But the Colour of the Mantles remained the same as at the Institution until Queen  lizabeth  's Reign and then it commenced Blue And 'tis remarkable that the Surcoats of the KnightsCompanions were always of the same Colour with the Sovereigns  THE Founder's first Surcoat was of the same Cloth and Colour with the Mantle  viz  Blue but in the th Year of his Reign he altered it to Black and of the same Colour were those he conferred that Year upon th  se following KnightsCompanions  viz  the B  ack Prince the Earls of  Ulster Richmond  and  Sali  bury Edmund  of  angly  Sir  Richard la Vacle  Sir  ugh Wrot  sly  Sir  Reginald Cobham  Sir  Bartholomew Burghest  the Lord  Mohun  Sir  Wal  er Manney  Sir  N  le Loring  Sir  Walter Pavel  y  Sir  William Fitz Warin  Sir  Miles Stapleton  the Earls of  Stafford Warwick  and  Suffolk  and Sir  Thomas Ughtred  The Motive that induced him to pitch upon this  able Colour was conceived to be a kind of Humiliation because the Pestilence began again to spread its Malevolence which had furiously raged Eleven Years before The Surcoats which the Sovereign gave the Dukes of  Lancasier  and  and Fourteen other Knights  Anno    Edward  III were of Cloth Sanguine in Grain Those Twenty four provided for the Feast of St  George Anno    Ru  ard  II were Violet in Grain whereof one was for the Sovereign the other Twenty three for the KnightsCompanions following  John  King  f  Castile  and  Leonard  Duke of  Lancas  er  the Earls of  Cambridge Buckingham Derby Kent Warwick Stafford Salisbury Northumberland  and  Nottingham  the Lords  Nevil Basset  and  John Holland  Sir  Guy Bryan  Sir  William Beauchamp  Sir  Thomas Percy  Sir  Nele Loring  Sir  John Sulby  Sir  Lodowick Clifford  Sir  Simon Burl  y  Sir  Richard Burley  Sir  Bryan Stapleton  and Sir  Soldan de la Trane  Anno    Richard  II there were ordered against St  George  's Feast Twenty three Surcoats of white Cloth for the Sovereign and Twenty two KnightsCompanions and the and Year of the same King the Sovereign bestowed on the same Persons Surcoats of long blue Cloth after the Original Model The Twenty two Surcoats made up for the Feast of St  G  orge Anno    Henry  V were of white Cloth  Anno    Henry  VI the Sovereigns Gown or Surcoat was of Scarlet as was that sent to the King of  Portugal  in the th Year of the same King  Anno    Henry  VI the Sovereign had white Cloth and so were the Surcoats given to Twenty KnightsCompanions more in theYear of his Reign Afterwards the beforementioned Four Colours began to be disused for the Surcoat presented to  Julian de Medicis temp Edward  IV was purple Velvet and towards the latter end of the Reign of King  Henry  VIII and since it is upon Record the Surcoats of the Sovereign and all the KnightsCompanions were Crimson Velvet nor did the Colour suffer a Mutation in the Surcoat tho' King  Charles  I restored the Mantle to its first primitive Colour  Anno    Regni sui  THERE has been some disproportion in the Quantity of the Cloth allowed in the Provision against one and the same Feast for  Anno    Edward  III the Earls of  Stafford Warwick  and  Suffolk  as also Sir  Thomas Ughtred  had then for each of their Surcoats fix Ells of Cloth perhaps the tallness of their Stature required it when the other Fifteen Knights were allowed but five Ells being the same Quantity the Sovereign's Surcoat had contained in it at the same time  THE Dukes of  Holland  and  Clarence Anno    Henry  V with the Earls of  Arundel  were allowed Eight Ells apiece the Dukes of  Bedford Gloucester  and  York  the Earls of  Westmorland  and  Warwick  the Lords  Grey  Fitz Hugh  and  Roos  six Ells apiece the Earls of  Dorset  with six Barons and five Knights Batchelors but five Ells apiece Afterwards when the Number of Ells of Cloth Garters and Furrs came to be ascertained for each Degree all the KnightsCompanions even the Pri  ce of  Wales  were not to exceed five Ells But since Velvet came in Plea the Allowance for Surcoat and Hood hath been eighteen Yards when the Surcoat reached down to the Feet but now it being the Fashion to wear if shorter the Allowance is stinted to Ten The Length of King  Charles  II's Surcoat was one Yard and an half and of the Sleeve one Yard wanting a Nail  THE Ornamental Trimmings of these Garments are next worthy of Note especially at the Time of Instituting this Order for they were then and a long time after powdered all over with little Garters embroidered with Silk and GoldPlate in each of which was neatly wrought the Motto  Honi soit  c Besides the Buckles and Pendants to those small Garters were Silver gilt of these Garters there were no less than upon the first Surcoat and Hood made for the Founder  IN King  Richard  II's Reign the little Garters that adorned the Surcoats of the Sovereign and the other Knights were wrought in Embroidery upon blue Taffaty with Cyprus and Soldat Gold and Silk of divers Colours and the Letters Gold And as the Sovereign was not limited in the Proportion of Cloth or Velvet for his Surcoat no more was he confined to the Number of Garters wherewith to adorn it nor do I find that any of the KnightsCompanions were until the Precedent of the Livery of the Garter was settled for  Anno    Henry  V the Dukes of  Holland  and  Claren    the Earl of  Arundel  the Dukes of  Bedford  and  Gloucester  had each of their Surcoats adorned with Garters but the Duke of  York  and the rest wore but The Settlement in the Precedent of the Livery was in relation to Degrees of Honour a greater or less Number of Garters Thus  A Duke    Garters  A Marquis    An Earl    A Viscount    A Baron    A Baronet    A KnightBatchelor    ABOUT the Reign of King  Henry  VI the Sovereigns Number of Garters did not much exceed those which the Founder allow'd to himself at the Institution for the Surcoat and Hood of the said King consisted of and the King of  Portugal Anno    Henry  VI Garters But this Drapery of their Robes became at length quite obsolete perhaps when Cloth was altered to Velvet and the plain Surcoat hath to this Day continued in Use  WHILE these Surcoats remained of Cloth they were lined with Bellies of pure Minever Fur only the Sovereigns was purfled with Ermin and of these it seems a like Proportion was at first stated to all the KnightsCompanions  viz  Bellies Yet in the Reign of King  Richard  II some Difference began in the Allowance to the KnightsCompanions for a Baron and all Degrees upward had Bellies but under a Baron only However  Anno    Henry  V the Barons were tantamount to the KnightsBatchelors for all Degrees above a Baron were allow'd a Fur of Bellies But the Barons and KnightsBatchelors Furs were only Bellies  AFTERWARDS by the Precedent of the Garter there was another Proportion limited the Prince a Duke a Marquis an Earl had each of them Five Timber of pure Minever allowed to a Surcoat but the Viscount Baron Baronet and BatchelorKnights but Three Timber apiece In time these Furs were disused and the Surcoats came to be lined with white Sarcenet to which  temp Eliz  white Taffaty succ  eded and that still continues  WHAT became of the old Surcoats since the KnightsCompanions had new ones every Year the Black Book of the Order informs us That on the Eve of the Feast  of St  George  the Knights wore to Vespers the Sovereigns Livery or Surcoats used by them the preceding Year which after that Night they threw off for the new Surcoats were worn on the FeastDay but the Ensigns and Ornaments of this Kind were disposed of to the Use of the Colledge  THE Hood and Cap comes in the next Place to be spoken of which Hood in King  Henry  VIII's Statutes and the Black Book of the Order is called  Humerale  but in the Rolls of the Great Wardrobe  Capucium  In the  French  it is  Chaperon  a Word used in the Statute  Anno    Richard  II  C  and also retained in the Old  English  Copy of  Henry  VIII's Statutes made of his Reign and annexed to this Treatise They were anciently wore for Defence of the Head against the Inclemencies of Weather but of later Times Caps and Hats have supplied their place How they sat upon the Head may be observed in the Portraitures of the first Founders as also with some Variety of Fashion in succeeding Ages Yet is not the Hood quite thrown by since 'tis still kept reclining upon the Back almost like a Pilgrim's Hat  THIS Hood was ordained and is yet retained as part of the Habit of this most Noble Order And tho' neither it nor the Surcoat is mentioned in the Statutes of Institution or in either its Exemplars nor doth King  Henry  V lay any Stress upon it yet it is of equal Antiquity with the rest as appears from the Rolls of the great Wardrobe and  Henry  VIII's Statutes have made remarkable Observation of it for the Mantle Surcoat Hood and Collar are called the Habit of the Order And in the Black Book  Anno    Henry  VII at the Investiture of  Philip  King of  Castile  the Mantle Kirtle Hood and Collar are expresly called  Whole Habit  IT was heretofore and now is generally made of the same Materials as the Surcoat and was anciently trimmed and set off with a small Proportion of Garters lined with Cloth of a different Colour and such as would best strike the Sight but now with Taffaty as is the Lining of the Surcoat  AS to the Cap which was instituted to succeed the Hood it hath been and yet is fashioned of black  Velvet lin'd with Taffaty but the Figure hath several Times varied for  Temp Henry  VIII it was flat in Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign it was a little raised in the Head but in King  James  's Time they were much more highcrown'd This Cap hath been usually adorn'd with Plumes of White Feathers and Spriggs and bound about with a Band set thick with Diamonds so was the Cap for the Installation of King  Charles  II and sometimes the Brims have been tack'd up with a large and costly Jewel  THIS Custom of wearing Caps and Feathers at the Grand Solemnities of the Order had for some Time about the Beginning of King  James  I Reign been omitted and thereupon in a Chapter held the th of  April Anno    Jac  I this commendable Custom was reestablish'd  To these may be added the Cross of the Order encompass'd with a Garter which by the Sovereign was ordain'd the th of  April    Car  I to be worn upon the Left Side of the Cloaks Coats and riding Cassocks of the Sovereigns and KnightsCompanions of the Prelate and Chancellor at all Times when they were not adorn'd with their Robes and in all Places and Assemblies but not embellish'd with Pearls and Stones that the wearing thereof might be a sufficient Indication to the World of that Height of Honour they arriv'd to from the said most Noble Order instituted for Persons of the greatest Merit and Worth  AND it was not long after e'er the Glory or Star as it was usually call'd having certain Beams of Silver that shot out in Form of a Cross was introduc'd and annex'd to it in Imitation as thought of the  French  who after the same manner wore the chief Ensign of the Order of the  Holy Ghost  being the Representation of a Dove irradiated with such like Beams  AND whereas some Painters affirm the Symbol of the Holy Ghost to be thus adorn'd congruous enough yet censure it improper for a Garter let them consider that King  Edw  IV erected his White Rose with the like Glory whereof both the Stone Work and Wood Work of St  George  's Chapel in  Windsor  manifestly illustrate whose Antiquity makes a Precedent for it long before  the Institution of the Order of the  Holy Ghost  but this King assum'd this Device upon appearance of three Suns which suddenly united together into one immediately before his successful Victory at  Mortimer  's  Cross  a happy  Aera  he thought himself oblig'd to perpetuate And they mistake who suppose it to be the Garter that is thus irradiated whereas it is something else more worthy of the Glory for from it not the Garter do the Rays diffuse  viz  the inclos'd Cross of the Order celebrated as glorious since it darted its bright Beams from Heaven when it appear'd to  Constantine the Great  as the same is represented on a Silver Medal On the one Side whereof was a  Bust in profile  or side Face of King  Charles  I and on the Reverse this Badge of the Order within a Garter inscrib'd  Honi  c a Cross irradiated dispersing its Beams in a Rhombular Form of Eight Angles beyond the Orbit or bounding Lines of the said Garter having for Circumscription  Prisci decus Ordmis Auctum    § HAVING finish'd our Discourse concerning the Robes of the Order we shall speak of the robes and Hoods assign'd to the Queen KnightsCompanions Wives and other great Ladies by the Donation of the Sovereigns set off and embellished with Minute Garters and lin'd with Rich Furs which Robes they were adorn'd with during the Solemnity of the Feast of St  George  a Custom almost as ancient as its Institution The first Mention we find recorded of the Feminine Habit occurs  Anno    R  II when the Queen the Sovereign's Mother the Dutchess of  Lancaster  the Countesses of  Cambridge Buckingham Pembroke Oxford  and  Salisbury  the Ladies  Philippa  and  Catherine  Daughters to the Duke of  Lancaster  and the Lady  Mohun  had such kind of Robes and Hoods provided for them They were made of Cloth Violet in Grain like as the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions that Year the Robes lin'd with Fur but the Hoods with Scarlet and both embroidered over with little Garters and the Proportion of Cloth Furs and Garters were stated according to their several Ranks and Degrees for the Queen had Eight Ells and Half an Ell of  Scarlet for the Lining of her Hood The Sovereign's Mother had allow'd her one whole Piece and a double Proportion of Scarlet but from the large Quantity it is conceiv'd she had Two Robes and Hoods made at this time Besides the particular Number are but Eleven Persons and cannot else reach the Total of the Robes that were made up and expresly set down to be Twelve The Dutchess of  Lancaster  had the Allowance of Half a Piece and Half an Ell of Scarlet the Countess of  Cambridge  Seven Ells of Cloth and Half an Ell of Scarlet and the rest of the Ladies the same Proportion of Cloth with the KnightsCompanions  i e  each Five Ells apiece and Half an Ell of Scarlet According to their Cloth was also their Proportion of Minever the Queen's Allowance was Two Furs each containing Three Hundred Bellies of pure Minever the Sovereign's Mother had twice that Proportion the Dutchess of  Lancaster  and Countess of  Cambridge  had the same Allowance as the Queen but all the rest of the Ladies had only one Fur of Two Hundred Bellies Besides the embroidered Garters to deck out the Twentyfour Surcoats of the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions and the Twelve Robes for the Queen and other Ladies amounted to the Number of  AGAINST the Feast of St  George Anno  II  R  II there were prepared Fifteen Robes and Hoods for the Queen and other Ladies of the same Livery and suit with the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions  viz  White long Cloth and Blue Cloth for the Lining of their Hoods bearing the same Proportion in all Things as the former  Anno    Rich  II the Ladies Robes and Hoods were Sanguine Cloth and the Lining of their Hoods Cloth in Grain And in the th  Rich  II they were Blue Cloth and long Cloth in Grain for Lining their Hoods In both these Years we find the Dutchess of  Aquitaine  had double the Proportion of Cloth allow'd her as had also the Dutchess of  York viz  Fourteen Ells the Queen having then but the former Allowance of Eight Ells and yet her Proportion of Lining both for the Robe and Hood was no more than allow'd the Queen  BUT  Anno    Henry  V the same Quantities of Cloth Minevers and Garters were the same to Ladies of all Degrees and that was to each Five Ells of White Woollen Cloth only the QueenMother had Eight Ells of White Cloth and Eight Ells of Black Cloth a Fee containing Two Hundred Bellies of Minever and an Hundred embroidered Garters and  Henry  VI the Master of the great Wardrobe was commanded to make ready the like Livery both for Colour of Cloth number of Ells Bellies of Minever and Garters for the Countess of  Suffolk  against the approaching Feast of St  George  A plainer Narrative is made of these Liveries  Anno    Edw  IV when at the Feast of St  George  at  Windesor  the Queen the Lady  Elizabeth  the King's Daughter and Dutchess of  Suffolk  the King's Sister had for their Livery Murrey Gowns embroidered with Garters  BESIDES these Robes worn by the Ladies at the Festivals of the Order there seems to be some Imitation of wearing a Garter also on their Left Arms as the Knights did on their Left Leg as it is observ'd on the Countess of  Tankervile  's Monument where she is so pourtray'd  AFTER a long Disuse of these Robes  Anno    Car  I there was an endeavour to restore it for the Deputy Chancellor sollicited the Sovereign in Chapter That the Ladies of the KnightsCompanions might be granted the Privilege to wear a Garter of the Order about their Arms and an upper Robe at Festival Times according to ancient Usage upon which Motion the Sovereign gave Order that the Queen's Pleasure should be known herein and the Affair left to the Ladies particular Request and the Year ensuing upon the Deputy Chancellor's Report at another Chapter at  Windesor  it was then left to a Chapter to be called by the KnightsCompanions to preponderate of every Circumstance how it were fittest to be effected for the Honour and Lustre of the Order which was appointed to be held at  London  about  Allhollantide  next But the unhappy War breaking out this Matter entirely broke off  § THERE remains now the Collar and  George  brought in by King  Henry  VIII And first of Collars in general which is an Ornament not of late but ancient Invention and the wonderful Consent of most Nations plead for it Sacred Writ sets down the Collar of Gold for one of the Ornaments  Pharaoh  conferr'd upon  Joseph  The Images of  Isis  and  Osiris  were represented with such like Collars in a manner extending to their Shoulders as  Kircher  informs us Their Workmanship seems wonderfully curious being intersected with various Lines and divided with Tablets and precious Stones The Collar was of an illustrious Original among the  Romans  and gave Denomination to the Family of  Torquati  descended from  L Manlius  whom the Soldiers surnam'd  Torquatus  because he fought with a Champion of the  Gauls Anno V C  and having foil'd him in fight cut off his Head and then pluck'd off his Collar bloody as it was and put it about his own Neck In further Memory of which Action were found several  Roman  Coins referring to  L Torquatus  Consul with  L Cotta Anno V C  And it's remarkable that when one of another Tribe was adopted into this Family he did also assume this Badge of Honour as in the Coin of  D Junius Silanus  tho' the Fashion of the Work some what differ'd from the former  IN pristine Times none but Kings and Princes wore Collars and therefore their Use seems of Dignity and Power as is evident from  Daniel  where the  Assyrian  Kings used this Ornament Afterwards Men famous for Wisdom and Council had them as a distinguishing Badge as in the Example of  Joseph  and from the Proclamation of  Belshazzar  King of  Babylon  who proposed it as a Praemium to him that could interpret the HandWriting upon the Wall And Men famous for Military Atchievements had it conferr'd upon them in Recompence of their Merits thus Collars were of the Number of the  Dona Praemia Militaria  among the the  Romans  and the Honour of receiving them thought worthy to be consign'd to Posterity in Marble Inscriptions From them the later Emperors receiv'd it and we read of investing a Knight of the  Holy Sepulchre  with a  Collar at his Creation where as soon as the Ceremony of his Ordination is over the Padre Guardian Kisses the new Made Knight and puts about his Neck according to the mode of the Ancients a Golden Collar with a Cross hanging at it  MOST aptly therefore have the Sovereigns of Military Orders annex'd this Ornament of the Collar to their Habit and conferr'd it on the Fellows and Companions many of whom have meritoriously deserv'd it for their great Wisdom and valorous Exploits and for this reason it was instituted in additional Glory to the Ensigns of the Garter compos'd in a peculiar manner in Relation to the Name and Title to the wearing of which the Sovereign oblig'd both himself and KnightsCompanions and his and their Successors  THIS Collar was ordain'd to be of Gold Thirty Ounces Troy weight but not to exceed it howbeit that Collar sent to  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  weigh'd Thirtyfour Ounces and a Quarter and that of King  Charles  I Ounces and an Half which after his Sufferings fell into the Hands of  Thomas Harrison  one of  Oliver  's MajorGenerals and was by him delivered to the Trustees for Sale of the King's Goods They sent it to the  Mint  with divers of the  Regalia  to set the Stamp on work for the first Gold that the upstart Com  onwealth coin'd  IT was appointed by King  Henry  VIII's Statutes that this Collar should be compos'd of Pieces of Gold in Fashion of Garters the Ground enamelled Blue and the Letters of the Motto Gold in the midst of each Garter Two Roses plac'd the innermost enameiled Red and the outermost White contrarily in the next Garter the innermost Rose enamelled White and the outermost Red and so alternately but of lat  r Times these Roses are wholly Red  THE Number of these Garters are so many as be the ordain'd Number of the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions at the Institution they were Twentysix being fasten'd together with as many Knots of Gold and this Mode hitherto has continu'd invariable nor ought the Collar to be adorn'd or enrich'd with precious Stones as the  George  may be such being prohibited by the Law of the Order  AT the Middle of the Collar before pendant at the Table of one of the Garters in the Collar is to be fix'd the Image of St  George  arm'd sitting on Horseback who having thrown the Dragon on his Back encounters him with a TiltingSpear This Jewel is not encompass'd with a Garter or Row of Diamonds as in the lesser  George  but in round Relief It is allow'd to be beautified and sett off with Diamonds and other Enrichments at the Pleasure of the KnightCompanion who possessed it and upon that Score it hath been frequently adorn'd with Variety of costly Work whereon the Diamonds and other precious Stones being set to that Advantage as might upon its Motion and Agitation dart forth a resplendent Lustre  BEFORE the Establishment of this Article by King  Henry  VIII it appears that the KnightsCompanions were invested with Collars at their Installations for the Black Book makes mention of a Collar among the Ensigns of the Garter wherewith  Philip  King of  Castile  was invested  Anno    Henry  VII but whether a Collar of SS's or of another Model is not specifi'd Nevertheless this Scruple is in part clear'd up by an old Memorial of the Ceremonies at the Creating  Henry  Lord  Stafford  Earl of  Wiltshire    Henry  VIII where it is said in the Annals that after he was invested with the Robes of his State and Dignity the Collar of the Garter was put about his Neck at constituting him a Knight of the Order And to make it more conspicuous in a Vellum Book of the Statutes sent to  Maximilian  the Emperor sign'd by the Register  T Rowthale  and in another of  Edward Stanley  Lord  Monteagle  elected  ann    Hen  VIII the Forty First Article enjoins a Collar to be worn by each KnightCompanion expresly called the Collar of the Order which tho' it be not in all Respects consentient to that prescribed by King  Henry  VIII's Statutes yet there is not much Variation and 'tis reported to be a  Gold Collar coupled together by several Pieces of Links in Fashion of Garters with a Vermilion Rose and the Image of St  George  hung thereat  The Reason of the KnightsCompanions wearing it at the Times appointed the License for putting it to mending the Command not  to enrich the Collar but the  George  only and under a Penalty not to sell pawn or alienate it upon any Necessity whatsoever are wholly the same as was afterwards enjoyn'd by King  Henry  VIII So that he did but only annex to his Body of Statutes a Decree which for the greatest part had been put in practise before In the th  Hen  VIII upon Interpretation of the Eleventh Article of the Statutes the Collar is there enumerated as part of the entire Robes that a KnightCompanion is oblig'd to wear for a more convincing Proof That the Collar of Garters was used before King  Henry  VIII's Reign the Monument of Sir  Giles Daubeny  plainly Delineates who departed  Henry  VII in  WestminsterAbbey  where his Portraicture in the Robes of the Order is adorned with such a Collar as King  Henry  VIII's Statutes do afterwards describe  AS the Garter sent to  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Swed  n  so the great  George  pendant at his Collar weighing Seven Ounces was set with large and resplendent Diamonds to the Number of EightyFour  IN what Regard this Noble Ensign of Honour the Colla  hath been with the Sovereigns and KnightsCompanions not only of the Order of the  Garter  but other Military Orders may be collected from the Pictur  s of some of them as well as from their Seals Coins and Medals for in these they have been pleased to exhibit their Effigies and Escutcheons of Arms and omitting Foreign Examples the Collars both of the  Garter  and  Thistle  were express'd in the Coronation Medal of King  Charles  I in  Scotland  tho' in that of his Coronation at  Westminster  and afterwards in that of King  Charles  II the Collar of the Order of the  Ga  ter  are only put over their Royal Robes  THESE Ornaments of the Collars have been affix'd sometimes encircling the Shields of their Arms and in a S  al of  Charles the Bold  Duke of  Burgundy  Sovereign of the Order of the  Golden Fleece  plac'd to an Instrument dated it is worthy of Remark that Collar adorns the Neck of the Lyon of  Flanders  but the Sovereigns of the  Garter  usually encompass'd their Arms not within the Collar of the Ord  r but the Royal Garter that being its principal Ensign and  sometimes having no Shield of Arms the void Space within the Garter exhibits their Arms  OBSERVABLE is the Seal of  Charles  Count  Palatine  of the  Rhine  wherein is a Shield quarterly of the  Palatinate  and  Bavaria  obscuring the Lyon Guardant its Supporter his Four SS's only appearing quadrangularly and his Head a top ensign'd with an Electoral Crown this Shield is encircled both within the Garter and Collar of the Order and is the first Example wherein both these Ensigns are jointly together It is very frequent to express the Collars of different Orders together Thus I have seen the Arms of  Robert Dudley  Earl of  Leicester  entour'd within the Garter and a Collar of the Order of St  Michael  having been Knight of these Orders and the Funeral Atchievement of the late  James Hamilton Douglas  Duke of  Hamilton  had the Garter and a Collar of the Thistle about it And in a Plate under the Effigies of the Duke of  Aspernons  a Shield of his Arms quarter'd is encompass'd with the chiefest Ensigns of those Three Orders whereof he was a Brother and Companion  viz  with the Garter and the Collars of St  Michael  and the  Holy Ghost  And the older the Order is in the Roll of Antiquity whose chief Ensign is there represented the nearer ought it to be plac'd to the Escutcheon of Arms being the more Honourable Post A Mistake was committed in the marshalling these Collars when the Duke of  Chevereux  affixed it over his Stall at  Windsor  the Collars of St  Mithael  and the  Holy Ghost  are plac'd nearer to his Escutcheon than that of the Garter  § AND whereas we have spoke of another kind of Collar call'd a Collar of SS's worn as Badges of lower and inferior Honour it will not be amiss to inform our Judgment in other Affairs concerning them  Wicelius  informs us from a Book in the Library of  Fulda  where in the Life of the Two Brothers  Simplicius  and  Faustinus  both Senators and suffer'd Martyrdom under  Dioclesian  there is a Description of the Society of St  Simplicius  consisting of Noble Personages in their own Families and describing the Collar wore as the Badge of it says thus  It was the Custom of those Persons to wear about  their Necks Silver Collars compos'd of double SS  's  which denote the Name of Saint  Simplicius  between these double SS's The Collar consisted of Twelve small Plates of Silver in which were engraven the Twelve Articles of the Creed together with a single Trefoil The Image of St  Simplicius  hung at the Collar and from it Seven Plates representing the Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost As to the manner of their Martyrdom they were bound together by the Neck to a Stone and thrown over the Bridge into the River  Tyber  AT what Time the Collar of SS  's  came into  England  is not fully determin'd but it will appear at least Three Hundred Years since and worn as an Ornament for Women as well as Men for on a Monument in the Collegiate Church of  Warwick  the Figure of  Margaret  Wife to Sir  William Peito  said to be interr'd  Temp Edw  III hath a Collar of SS  's  drawn about and set close to her Neck which the Sculpture in  The Antiquities of  Warwickshire by mistake represented like a Ruff There was also a Collar of SS  's  about the Neck of Sir  Simon Burley  's Statue in St  Paul  's  London  IN the ancient Creation of an Esquire in  England  part of the Ceremony was the King's putting about his Neck a Silver Collar of SS  's  And  Selden  in his Titles of Honour contemns not the old Ballad  The Tanner of  Tamworth to prove the Creation of Esquires in King  Edw  IV's Reign by conferring such Collars on them But that the Golden one was the undoubted Badge of a Knight as may be instanc'd by many undeniable Examples deduc'd from the Monuments of such Persons  Temp Hen  VI  Ed  IV  Hen  VII  Hen  VIII and since and so legally appropriate thereto that in the Act  H  VIII made for Reformation of Apparel there is a Proviso entred That Knights notwithstanding might publickly wear a Gold Collar of SS  's  tho' since it is grown obsolete and useless  Favin  tells us that our  Hen  V instituted an Order surnam'd Knights of the SS  's  on the Day of the Martyrs St  Crispine  and  Crispianus  which tho' he found nothing of it in our  English  Historians yet from the Chronicle of  Juvenal des Ursins  where he treats of the Battle of  Agincourt  he collected this following Relation  THE King of  England  exhorted his Men and commanded That if any had trespass'd against another they should be reconcil'd and confess'd to the Priests otherwise no good Success wou'd accrew to them in their Attempts He advis'd them to be civil in their March and to do their Duty well and agreed upon these Conditions That those of their Company who were not of gentle Extraction he wou'd make so from the Fountain of Honour and give them Warrants that for the future they should enjoy the Privileges the Gentlemen of  England  had and to the End they might be distinguish'd from others he granted them leave to wear a Collar powder'd with the Letter S  AMONG the Variety of Collars of SS's now in vogue there are these following The Lord Mayor of  London  's Collar is compos'd of Gold having a Knot like one of those that tye the Garters together in the great Collar of the Order inserted between Two SS  s  and they again situated between Two Roses  viz  a White Rose within a Red and in the Middle before the Breast is a large Portcullis whereat hangs a most rich Jewel sett with large Diamonds  THE Collars of the Lords Chief Justices of both the Benches and the chief Baron of the  Exchequer  are in Memory of the said St  Simplicius  a Senator and consequently a Gownman form'd of the Letter S and a Knot alternately having a Rose set in that part of it which falls out to be in the Middle of their Breasts and another on their Backs the Five Flowers of these Roses are constituted of Five large Pearls  THOSE Collars which appertain to the Kings and Heralds of Arms as well as to Serjeants at Arms having been bestow'd by former Kings and renew'd to them by King  Charles  II to be worn upon Days of solemn Attendance are compos'd of SS's link'd together In the Middle of the Breast is a Rose at each of which hangs Three small Drops of Silver but the SS's in the Collars worn by the Kings of Arms are made somewhat larger than the other and in that part lying on either Shoulder is a Portcullis taken in between the SS's which are wanting in the rest  THE general difference of the Collars appropriate to the beforenamed Degrees is this Knights have allow'd them Collars of Silver gilt but Esquires only Silver  and therefore in the Creating of an Herald in part of that Ceremony he is made an Esquire by putting on him a Collar of SS's of Silver and so is a Serjeant at Arms  THE Kings of  England  have sometimes been pictured with a Collar of SS's about their Arms in like manner as the Garter doth surround them as appears from an Impression of King  Henry  VIII's Privy Signet whereon his Royal Arms crown'd are encircled with a Collar of SS's to the lower End of which are affix'd Two Portcullisses  § WE come now to the lesser  George  of the Order and we do not find that the Effigies of St  George  was at any time worn by the Sovereign or KnightsCompanions before the Breast or under the Arm as now used till the th of  Henry  VIII But then that King decreed in a Chapter held at  Greenwich  the Morrow after St  George  's Day That every Knight should wear loosely before his Breast the Image of St  George  in a Gold Chain or otherwise in a Ribband the same to be fasten'd within the ennobled Garter for a manifest Distinction between the KnightsCompanions and others of the Nobility and Knights who according to the Mode of those Times wore large Gold Chain  the ordinary Ensigns of Knighthood And thus the wearing the Medal or Jewel usually call'd the lesser  George  to distinguish it from the other Work at the Collar of the Order first receiv'd the Injunction and hath since been frequently used  THIS  George  was for the most part pure Gold curiously wrought but divers of them were exquisitely graved in Onyx's and Agats and with such a happy Collection of the Stones that heightned and received their Beauty by the Skill of the Artificer in contriving the Figures and History the natural Tincture of the Stones have so fitted them with Colours for Flesh Hair and every thing else even to Surprize and Admiration In this Jewel is St  George  represented in a Riding  Posture encountring the Dragon with his drawn Sword  BY the last Article of King  Henry  VIII's Statutes it was allowed to be enriched at the Pleasure of the Possessor as is the great George which for the most Part hath been curiously enamell'd and the Garter about it sett with Diamonds And of what weight and bigness these lesser  George  's were may be gather'd from that sent to the French King  Charles  IX being an Ounce and an half and half quarter Weight The Variety of Workmanship in those Gold Chains whereat this Jewel hung was usually great according to the Fancy and Pleasure of the Persons for whom they were wrought But within a short Space wearing the lesser George in SilkRibbands as well as GoldChains was promiscuously us'd and  ad Libitum  So were the Symbols of Foreign Orders as divers Coins and Medals declare But the Colour of these Ribbands when they came first to be wore was black  John Dudley  Viscount  Lisle  the Lords St  John  and  Parr  so used them at their Investiture  Henry  VIII and several Pictures of other KnightsCompanions about that time confirm the same That small Chain whereat hung the lesser  George  transmitted to  Emanuel  of  Savoy Ann    Ph Mar  was formed of twelve Pieces of Gold in every of which was sett three small Diamonds and of twelve other like Pieces wherein were three Rubies and twenty four Pearls  IT appears by a Letter of Sir  Richard  St  George  Kt  Clarencieux  dated  July  th that the blue Ribband had some Years before been additional to the Ornament of the Order and 'tis reported that  Robert  Earl of  Essex  observing in  France  the Jewels of the Order of St  Michael  and St  Esprit  worn in blue Ribbands upon his return was the principal motive those Ribbands whereat the  George  hung were exchanged into that Colour And in a Picture of Queen  Elizabeth  drawn towards the Declension of her Reign her lesser George is represented hanging before her Breast in a blue Ribband And this Colour was more caressed and grew in great repute by reason it was the Ground of the Garter and nearest the Colour of the Mantle of the Order So that toward the latter End of the Reign of King  James  I because the dye of the Ribband had not been peculiarly express'd in any Statute and the blue and azure accustomed for some Years past it was decreed That for the future it should be always of blue and no other nor in time of Mourning it self should be changed  THE Manner of wearing this Ribband in time of Peace was of later Times pendant about the Neck down to the Middle of the Breast where the lesser George hung but since for the more Conveniency of Riding or Action the same is spread over the left Shoulder and brought under the right Arm where the Jewel hangs  BUT where the Pictures of the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions are drawn in Armour there even to this Day the George is represented as fix'd to a Gold Chain instead of a blue Ribband and worn about the Neck not brought under the right Arm as exhibited on the three Pound Pieces of Gold stamped at  Oxford  by King  Charles  I and a Medal of  Charles  Count Palatine of the  Rhine  dated  AMONG the invaluable Jewels and other Curiosities of King  Charles  I which came to the Hands of the Trustees appointed for Sale of his Goods were these     l  s  d  A George containing Diamonds Sold for        A George cut in Onyx with Diamonds in the Garnish        A small George with a few Diamonds        A George with Rubies and Diamonds and Diamonds in a Box        A George cut in a Garnet        Total        THE George King  Charles  I had at his Martyrdom was curiously Engraved in an Onyx set about with twenty One large TableDiamonds in the Fashion of a Garter On the reverse of the said George was the Picture of the Queen set in a Case of Gold the Lid neatly enamell'd with Goldsmith's Work and surrounded with another Garter adorned with an equal Number of Diamonds as  was that of King  Charles  II also sett with fair Diamonds and after the Defeat given to the  Scotch  Forces at  Worcester    Car  II was strangely preserved by Colonel  Blague  one of that King's dispersed Attendants who resigned it for safety to the Wife of Mr  Barlow  of  BlarePipeHouse  in  Staffordshire  where he took Sanctuary from whom  Robert Milward  Esq receiv'd and gave it intothe Hands of Mr  Isaac Walton  all Loyalists It came again to  Blague  's Possession then Prisoner in the Tower whence making his escape he restor'd it to King  Charles  II  IT is worthy of Remark that besides the Sovereign of the most Noble Order of the Garter other Princes of Christendom have assumed the bearing St  George  encountring the Dragon in like Posture tho' not so anciently nor upon the same Grounds and Foundation as they probably having elected him Patron and Guardian of their Countries or Families such as the Emperors of  Russia  the Dukes of  Mantua  and the Counts  Mansfield  in  Germany  as their Seals and Coins plainly demonstrate  IN the Great Seal of  Borice Feodorwicke  Emperour of  Russia  affixed to his Letter sent to Queen  Elizabeth  dated at  Mosco June  th was a double Headed Eagle displaid having each Head crowned and bearing an Eschutcheon with the Representation of St  George  upon its Breast There is another of this Emperour's Great Seals fixed to his Letter dated  May  st which he also sent to Queen  Elizabeth  On one side is the abovesaid

MANT  III  MONTFERU  on the Reverse St  George  and the Dragon Motto  Protector nostra aspic  and  Casal  at the Bottom  §    When the Habit or part of it ought to be worn is the next thing we shall speak of  THE more solemn Days and Occasions which require a fuller conformity and the wearing the whole Habit  i e  the Garter Mantle Surcoat Hood Collar Great George and Cap ar  first The High Festival of the Order commonly called St  George  's Feast whether it be solemnized on the d d or th of  April  annually or any other Days within the Year by Prorogation as is apparent by all the Bodies of the Statutes  FOR First it is ordained That the KnightsCompanions should be Arrayed in the whole Habit on the Eve of St  George  before the Sovereign proceeded to the Chapter to hear Divine Service and being so Robed should attend on the Sovereign to the ChapterHouse thence to the Chapel and return with him back in the same manner until after Supper as well those that minded to Sup as those that should not Sup nor might they disrobe until the Sovereign or his Deputy had put off his or declar'd it seasonable for his or their doing so  BY the same Statute they were enjoined to wear the whole Habit on the Feast of St  George  both at their Progression in the Morning to the ChapterHouse or Chapel at their return to Dinner from thence to the Second Vespers and back to Supper as also till Supper was over and until the Sovereign or his Lieutenant took leave of the rest of the KnightsCompanions  Secondly  IT is manifest from King  Henry  VIII's Statutes That the Eve the Day of St  George  and Morrow following were to be observed with solemn Service and holding of Chapters wheresoever the Sovereign was resident tho' the Grand Feast were Prorogued to a longer Duration and when by reason of such Prorogation they should convene in any Place besides  Windsor  to attend the Sovereign for the Solemnization of St  George  's Day they then must Adorn themselves with the whole Habit from beginning of the first Vespers until the last Evening Service of the same Day  Thirdly  ON such other Days of the Year whereon the Grand Feast is held by Prorogation and during such Part of the Eve and Day of the Feast as is before appointed when it is held on its proper Day  Fourthly  BY absent Knights whensoever the Grand Feast of St  George  should be celebrated and wheresoever they should happen at that time to reside if at Liberty and not under restraint to keep it in like manner as if then present with the Sovereign or his Deputy in the Place where he should Celebrate the Feast The time of wearing the whole Habit in this Point extends but to the End of the second Vespers as in the second Instance above  Fifthly  THE KnightsCompanions are to wear the entire Habit at the Feasts of Installation when they assist at that Ceremony where if it commence in the Evening they are not to disrobe themselves till after Supper and being the next Morning habited as before then to proceed to the ChapterHouse or Chapel and not to devest themselves till Dinner is ended  THE less solemn Occasions are those which require the wearing the Mantle or Collar of the Order only  AND they are first upon the Morrow after the Grand FeastDay when the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions proceed to the Chapel and make their Offering then it sufficeth that they barely put on the Mantle which Service being Finished they were wont to leave it at the ChapterHouseDoor as they retired out of the Chapel  Secondly  AS often as Chapters are called and in what Place soever assembled either for Elections or other Causes as it shall please the Sovereign to nominate  And as often as it is requisite for the Sovereign or any of the KnightsCompanions to enter into the Chapel of St  George  at  Windsor  and in reference hereunto is the Article  E  was that their Mantles should remain in the Vestry at  Windsor  that upon any sudden emergency they might be in readiness for in the Inventory of the Chapel taken  R  we find remaining at that time in the Vestry a Mantle appertaining to the Sovereign another to  John  Duke of  Britain  a third to  John Holland  Earl of  Huntington  another to  Edmund Langley  Earl of  Cambridge  and one to  Thomas Holland  Earl of  Kent  all of them then surviving  And by a Decree past at the Grand Feast  H  the Mantle of the young Sovereign was appointed to be left at  Windsor  as the Statutes required and this Article was confirmed by King  Henry  VIII by Virtue whereof the Mantles of the Emperor  Charles  V and  Anna  Duke of  Montmorency  were left in the Custody of the Dean and Canons of  Windsor  And heretofore in the Bill of drawing up Matters necessary for the Installation of a KnightCompanion there were usually two Mantles set down one expressed to be left in the College and the other for all other Occasions that might intervene  THESE Mantles thus ordered to be reposed in the College upon emergent Occasions were anciently committed to the Custody of the BlackRod as granted by Letters Patent with the Office  H  And after the Death of the Owners devolved to the Dean and Canons of  Windsor  either for the publick Use of the KnightsCompanions when they casually came to  Windsor  or else sold sometimes to the Heirs of the Deceased or others who succeeded in the Order as that of  Charles  V was to the Earl of  Bedford  and that of the Constable of  France  lent to the Earl of  Warwick Ann    Eliz  which appears from the Accounts of the Chanter of the College  temp H    H    H  Q  Eliz  and  Jac  who in all times answered the full Benefit thereof to the College as being a certain Perquisite to the Dean and Canons which they accordingly had and enjoyed  AND yet we find some of the College made overbold with the Robe of  Sigismond  the Emperour and sold it while he surviv'd But the Archbishop of  York  who  as Chancellor of  England  visited the College secured the Money from being distributed among those that sold it and reserved the Dividend to the Dean and Chapter that should chance to be living at that Emperour's Expiration and commanded for the Future under Pain of Excommunication That no Dean and Canon should imbezil or aliene any KnightsCompanion's Mantle while he was alive but the same should be decently and faithfully kept and preserved But we are informed that this Statute was altered  Ann    Eliz  and one drawn up to this effect  That the KnightsCompanions should be bound by Oath to take care by their Wills that after their Decease all the Ornaments which they had received should be restored the Robes to the College and the Jewels to the Sovereign that gave them  IN the last Place the Times of wearing the Collar of the Order with the Great  George  appendant which is not only enjoined to be worn as part of the Habit at the grand Feasts and Feasts of Installation but also at other times when not any of the rest of the Habit is ordered saving the Garter is to be worn as in special  at the principal and solemn Feasts of the Year  and other FeastDays To which a particular Order in Chapter  Ann    Eliz  thus directs  The Holydays and Sundays within the twelve Days  St  Matthias  Day  Holydays in  Easter  Week  St  Mark  's Day  St  Philip  and  Jacob  's Day  Holydays in  Whitsun  Week  St  Peter  's Day  St  James  's Day  St  Bartholomew  St  Matthew  St  Luke  St  Simon  and  Jude  St  Andrew  St  Thomas  BESIDES these the Sovereigns and KnightsCompanions have been accustomed to wear this Ensign upon the Anniversary of the Sovereign's Coronation of the  Gun  Powder Treason  and of later Times on the Sovereign's Birthday So formerly upon some occasional Ceremonies not relative to the Order as when a KnightCompanion hath been created into Titles of Dignity and Honour he had the Collar of the Garter added to his  Investiture as appears in the Case of  Henry Stafford  created Earl of  Wiltshire Ann    Hen  And at a Chapter held  May  d That such KnightsCompanions as should afterwards assist at the Funeral of any KnightCompanion should wear the Collar  apert  at the said Funeral And it was so observed by the Dukes of  Ormond  and  Richmond  the Earls of  Manchester  and  Sandwich  at the Obsequies of  George Monk  Duke of  Albemarle  Howbeit the Custom is otherwise as to wearing the Garter the principal Ensign of the Order for tho' it be injoyned to be wore at the grand Festivals c yet it does not imply that it might be left off For indeed it ought daily to be worn both by the Sovereign and Knights Companions And therefore was it decreed even in its Institution That if any KnightCompanion should in publick be found without one buckled about his Leg upon Challenge he should be mulct a Noble to the Dean and College of  Windsor  By King  Henry  VIII the Fine was raised a Mark payable as before to any of the five Officers of the Order  or to the Dean besides which Fine the Knight lies liable to a Check But to alleviate the Strictness and obviating other Inconveniencies King  Henry  V admitted of a Qualification and in case of riding with Boots ordained That it might suffice if the KnightCompanion wore some Ribband or SilkLace to represent the Garter tho' in this very Article there is a Proviso That no KnightCompanion should enter into Chapter without his Garter buckled about the Leg  In short King  Henry  VIII ordained That the GoldChain whereat the lesser  George  in that Age hung should be worn all other days in the Year except the Principal and Solemn Feasts whereon the great Collar was ordained to be worn and except in time of War Sickness or long Voyage in any of which Cases a SilkLace or Ribband with the Image of St  George  thereat was sufficient and the blue Ribband having since succeeded in Place of the Cold Chain the Injunction of this Statute extends to it in all particulars  The present Habits Ensigns and Badges belonging to the Officers of the Garter  The Prelate Chancellors Mantle  Registers Garters Black Rods Mantle  Garters Scepter  Black Rod  Chancellors Badge  Garters Badge  Black Rods Badge  CAP VIII  § CONCERNING the Officers appointed for the service of the Order to give it a greater degree and augmentation of Honour the Founder constituted a  Prelate R  gister  and  Usher  assigning them several Duties Some of his Successors added the  Chanchellor  and  Garter  and all of them Sworn to be of the Council of the Order among these the  Prelate  and  Chanchellor  are usually nominated the Principal the other three the inferiour Officers of the Order  IN this Chapter we shall give some account of their Institution Oath Habit Ensigns Privileges and Pensions for as to the nature of their Offices and their Duties they are for the general Recorded in the Black Book under the Title  Constutiones ad Officiales Ordinis Garterij peculiarit  r attinentes  c Upon the Establishment  Anno    Hen  VIII and annex'd to his Statutes and more particularly their Duties will occur in several places of the ensuing Discourse where they properly fall in to be Treated of as follows  THE Prelate is the first and primier Offic  r and in the Founders Statutes call'd  Praelatus O  dinis  and that the then Bishop of  Winchester William de Edyngton  was the first Prelate is very obious from thence he is an Officer of Honour only and hath neither Pension nor Fees allowed him by the said Constitutions this Office is vested in the Bishop of  Winchester  for the time being and from the Annals of the Order it's manifest his Successors have continued Prelates to this Day except the interruption only of a few Months  Anno    Ed  immediately after the Publishing this King's Statutes wherein the other Four Officers were cons  ituted a new to attend the Order but the Prelate wholly laid by  WHAT high reputation this See hath been favour'd with may be collected from an Act of Parliament    en  VIII concerning the Placing of the Lords in Parliam  nt Chamber and other Assemblies and Conference  of Council whereby thi  Bishop had Place assigned  him next to the Bishop of  Durham  who hath place by that Act next the Archbishop of  York  tho' before in respect of the prehemenence of this noble Order he had precedence and Place granted above all Bishops and next unto the ArchBishops At that Officers admittance he is oblig'd to take an Oath in the presence of the Soveraign or his Lieutenant which consists of these particulars    To be present in all Chapters whereunto he is Summoned    To report all things truly without Favour or Fear    To take the Scrutiny faithfully and present it to the Sovereign    To keep secret and not disclose the Councils of the Order    To promote and mainta  n the Honour of it    To withstand and reveal what is designed to the contrary  THIS Oath is read in Chapter by the Register of the Order the GentlemanUsher of the BlackRod holding the Book whilst the Prelate Kneels between th  Sovereign's Knees  Of the ROBE  AS the KnightsCompanions had their Surcoats bestowed on them at the Sovereigns charge and therefore called the Kings Livery so had the Officers of the Order their Liveries or Robes out of the Sovereign's Wardr  be and in particular the Prelate of the Order For in the Rolls of the great Wardrobe we find that  William de Edyngton  had allow'd him for his Robe of the Sovereign's Livery against the Feast of St  George  Anno  Ed  III one Cloth of Sanguine grain and a large quantity of Furs for trimming it up And we find this Robe so assigned the Prelate to be of the sute or colour of the KnightsCompanions Surcoats the same Year  viz  Sanguine in grain and that he had a great allowance of Furr for his being a Mantle was l  rger than any of the Knights Surcoats tho' they are both call'd by the same name  Ro  a  in the Rolls of the Wardrobe  Anno    Rich  II  William de W  k  am  then Prelate had the same allowance one Cloth of Violet in grain and other Materials But the Discrimination was in the Bellies of Minevers whose Number was now much encreased and that the same allowance was bestowed on him in the th and th Years of the said King But in these three Instances the Colour of the Cloth was different and suitable to the KnightsCompanions Surcoats those very Years  viz  Violet in grain White and Blue and  Anno    Hen  VI the Robe of  Henry Beaufort  Cardinal and Prelate was White as then were the Surcoats of the KnightsCompanions whence it is evident the Livery formerly allowed the Prelate annually varied in Colour as did the KnightsCompanions Surcoats  IN that ancient Precedent of the Liveries of the Garter remaining in the great Wardrobe wherein the Surcoats of the KnightsCompanions are reduced to a Stated proportion in the measure of the Cloth number of Furs and Garters modeled out according to their state degrees there the Prelate hath the following allowance for his Livery  Yards of Woollen Cloth  Timber pur  Timber gross  Minever  Timber de Biss  BY all which it is manifest what Materials and colour the Prelate's Robe was of at the institution of the Order and for a long time after nor do we find any variation until the Reign of King  Hen  VIII and then this Habit was ordained to be Crimson Velvet lin'd with white Taffaty faced with blue and thereon down the opening before upon the bordures sundry Royal cognizances on the right side the Rose of  England  Crowned on the left side opposite one of King  Edw  IV's Badges  viz  a Rose within the Sun Beams Crowned and then the aforesaid Badges again  vice versa  with more Damaskings on the right side the Flower de luce of  France  Crowned and on the left side King  Edw  III's peculiar Badge  viz  The Sun Beams issuing out of a Cloud and those Badges repeated in alternate situations every Badge interpolated  with an Area of Embroidered Damasking For  y of these Clouds wrought of Gold Silver and Silk having in the middle the  Saxon  Letter  E  of Gold were provided to him several Garments made for that King  Edw  III and Embellished with Stars As the l  ft Shoulder of a KnightCompanions Mantle so the right Shoulder of the Prelates Robe is injoyned to be Embroidred with a Scutcheon of St  George  's Arms encompassed with a Garter and adorned with Cordons of blue Silk mingled with Gold After a while the colour of this Robe became changed to Murray The allowance of Velvet Yards of white Sarcenet for Lining Yards and a Garter for the Shoulder Embroidred with Purls of Damask Gold But  Eliz  for the Livery of Bishop  Watson  then newly admitted the quantity of Velvet was encreased to Yards but the Lining and Garter remained as it was so also the Cordon having Buttons and Tassels of blue Silk and  Venice  Gold the like Robe in all particulars were made for Bishop  Cooper  and Bishop  Bilson  his Successars  Temp Eliz  ABOUT  Car  I the Prelate and Chancellor Petition'd the Sovereign to restore them their ancient Rights and Privileges of Honour in relation to their Ensigns and Robes upon their outward Garments whereupon  Car  I it was Ordered in Chapter that the KnightsCommissioners newly Established by that Chapter should take into their consideration the Robes the Prelate and Chancellor were to be invested with and certify the Sovereign the a  cient Colour and Fashion but nothing was effected untill after the Restoration and then by Warrant under the Signet of the Order Dated  February    Car  II the Prelate had assigned him for his Livery of the Order one Robe of Purple Velvet containing Yards and Yards of white Taffaty for Lining as also the Arms of St  George  within a Garter wrought with Letters and Purls of Damask Gold and Pearls having Laces Buttons and Tassels of purple Silk and  Venice  Gold but what inducements the Sovereign had for so changing the Murray Colour for Purple has not reached our Intelligence The time he is obliged to Wear this Robe is in express text  of the Constitutions to be Yearly on the Vigil and Day of St  George  wheresoever he is at liberty whether it be in Parliament or any other solemn Occasion or Festival whatsoever  THE Honours conferred on this Officer are that his Post in all Proceedings and Ceremonies of the Order is on the right Hand of the Chancellor that he hath the Privilege of Marshalling his Arms within the ennobled Garter and accordingly hath it been customary to surround them impaling his See He hath allott  d him convenient Appartments within the Castle of  Windsor  in a Tower Situated on the Northside called  Winchester  Tower and as often as he shall Arrive thither or to any other Place at the Sovereign's Command upon the Affairs of the Order he ought to have a  lowed him of the Court Livery for Himself and Retinue according to the Stipends that Earls resident in Court do possess  Car  I This Officer so well as the Chancellor had the Honour allowed him to Wear upon the left Part of his Cloak Coat and riding Cassock at all seasons when he should not be Invested with his Robe and in all Places and Assemblies a Scutcheon of the Arms of St  George  but not inriched with Pearls and Stones But not long after there was some restraint upon this Act tho' I do not find it repealed  § THE institution of the Chancellors Office his Oath Robe Badge and Pension next follows to be handled At the Erecting this Noble Order the common Seal was ordained to remain in the custody of whomsoever the Sovereign should please to lodge it but expresly to be one of the KnightsCompanions among whom in after times Sir  John Robertsack  is Stiled  Custos Si  illi Ordinis  having the custody of it by Decree  Hen  VI by a Prolepsis of Speech Styled Chancellor in the Black Book But King  Edw  IV finding it requisite to fix the Office of Chancellor of the Garter in a Person distinct from the KnightsCompanions and subservient to them Decreed in a Chapter at  Westminister    R  gni sui  That the Seal of the Order should be resigned to  Richard Beauchamp  then Bishop of  Salisbury  to keep  during pleasure and he to be called Chancellor of this most noble Order not long after by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of  England  Dated the th of  Oct    Edw  IV this King declared that tho' this Office was not expressed by the Founder's Statutes yet was it nevertheless very useful and therefore for the Advancement and good of the Order he constituted an Officer named Chancellor And forasmuch as this Office was of great Import and Concern and required an expert and able Person it was His further Pleasure that none but a Bishop should Execute it moreover considering the Chapel of St  George  at  Windsor  was Founded within the Diocess of  Salisbury  and having regard to the prudence and diligence of the said  Beauchamp  who out of meer love to the Order attended daily the progress of the Work wherewith the King was then in hand for enlarging the Chapel at  Windsor  he did therefore Ordain the said Bishop for the Term of his Life Chancellor of the Order and after his decease his Successors Bishops of  Salisbury  should always have and hold the said Chancellorship Nevertheless provided that the King's Concession should be put in execution by the Advice of the KnightsCompanions and without prejudice to the Bishop of  Winchester  in those things which ought by the Statutes of Institution to belong unto him  THIS Office thus conferred upon  Beauchamp  personally for Life and perpetually to his Successors Bishops of  Salisbury  by vertue of this Grant continued Chancellors nor doth it appear that any other Person had been invested therein until  Ann    E  VI that Sir  William Cecil  then principal Secretary of State was made Chancellor  FOR upon Reformation of the Order by that King his Statutes wholly excluded the Ecclesiasticks and appointed that the ChancellorsOffice should be executed by a Knight qualified with Honour and Reputation to manage a Post of that Care and Fidelity he thereupon appointed Sir  William Cecil  Chancellor And here first entred a secular Person notwithstanding which in a Charter to the Bishop of  Salisbury    Eliz  containing the Charters of Queen  Mary H  VIII and  H  VII and in another  Car  I the forementioned Letters Patents made to  Beauchamp  by King  Edw  IV are therein recited  totidem verbis  and confirmed as a Tacit Reservation of the Right and Title of those Bishops whensoever the Sovereign should have a benign and propitious Aspect towards that See The first of these Bishops who concerned himself for recovering this high Station to that See was Bishop  Cotton  who upon the Death of Sir  Edward Dyer  sometime Chancellor Petitioned the Sovereign  Jac  I and prayed Restitution thereof to the Church of  Salisbury  but before any determination the two chief Justices and chief Baron was advised withal who were of Opinion that this Office was not compleatly or sufficiently annexed to the Bishoprick of  Salisbury  by King  Edw  IV But  Cook  in his Institutes reports the point Void upon the incertainty of the Grant for that a new Office was Erected and not defined what Jurisdiction or Authority the Officer should Exercise and there's assigned a third Reason That the Grant was in the Sovereign's disposal because the Patent was obtained without Fee with one or more of these Opinions the Sovereign's judgment being swayed He forthwith nominated Sir  John Herbert  one of His privy Council to the Chancellorship and so this affair remained Silent until  Anno    Car  I when  John Davenant  Bishop of  Salisbury  upon Sir  Francis C  anes  decease remonstrated to the Sovereign his Claim to this Office whereupon at a Chapter held at  Windsor  th of  Dec  that Year the Sovereign propos'd to the KnightsCompanions present that tho' he had made Election of Sir  Thomas Rowe  for his Chancellor that time yet understanding a Claim made by the Bishop of  Salisbury  that the Place was annexed to that See he commanded the LordsCompanions to take the pretence of right into their considerations to which proposition of the King's they answered that they thought it not their duty to search for the Title of any Person but that if the Bishop did produce his Evidence and Proofs he might present it in Chapter to be considered  UPON this Encouragement the Bishop presented a Petition which was read in the Chapter at  Windsor  the th of  April  ensuing to this effect That King  Edw  IV by Letters Patent had Erected this Office of Chancellor and did then grant the same to  Richard Beauchamp  Bishop of  Salisbury  and his Successors for ever in consideration that the Chapel of St  George  was within their Diocess that those Bishops had enjoyed the same according to the Charter which Charter had been confirmed under the Great Seal of  England  by some other Kings and Queens and lastly by the King himself But that the use and exercise of that Office had for many Years been discontinued from them praying therefore an Hearing and Examination that the right of the said Church might be preserved and restored To the substance of which it was objected  First  THAT the Great Seals of  England  did not work within or upon the Statutes and Rules of the Order of the Garter  Second  THAT no Grant could prescribe the present Sovereign it being a Law Fundamental within the Order  Suprema Lex  was  Suprema Voluntas  Third  THAT it did not appear by the Records of the Order that the Office of the Chancellor was any otherwise conferred upon  Richard Beauchamp  Bishop of  Salisbury  than  quam diu Regiae celsitudini complaceret  TO the  First  It was answered by way of Exception as to the Grant of Offices forasmuch as the Great Seal of  England  was took into and became legal within the Order in like cases and not any Patent for an Office had past under the Seal of the Order but under the Great Seal of  England  and in particular the Office of the Chancellorship which had not been transacted if any legal defect had been therein  TO the  Second  granting it was so as was Objected it appeared that the Sovereign was as much at liberty to restore this Office to the See of  Salisbury  as continue it to secular Dignities  TO the  Third  what was alledged out of the Records of the Order related only to the time of delivering the Seals to Bishop  Bea  champ  But afterwards when the Office was Erected by Letters Patent it was then granted to him during Life Something was replied from the Judges Opinions even in this case  Ann Jac  R VI But the Sovereign thought it was not then well canvass'd and weighed to permit the Chapter Acts of this Order wholly independant from other Laws to receive construction and determination from the common Law and therefore declared that the Bishop ought to be heard and to that purpose gave him Orders to prepare the Vouchers and Proofs of his pretensions in vindication of his Petition and to send them to be delivered to the KnightsCommissioners elected for the affairs of the Order for their consideration at the next Chapter which was accordingly put in execution and then refierred to them again to be considered prepared and abbreviated to be perused by the Sovereign for his final determination But the  Scotch  War shortly after breaking forth and troubles running high at Home the further Prosecution was laid aside and not revived until the th of  Nov Anno    Car  II When  Seth Ward  Bishop of  Salisbury  took encouragement upon the former grounds and the Sovereign's favour to set on foot this Claim by a Petition presented to the Chapter then held at  Whitehall  where after a full debate and mature deliberation had of its equity and just Foundation he obtained a Decree for Reestablishment of this Office on the Bishops of that See upon the first vacancy Dated the th of  Nov  and present his Majesty the Sovereign the Dukes of  York  and  Ormond  Earls of  Oxford  and  Manchester  Prince  Rupert  Earls of  Bristol  and  Sandwich  and the Duke of  Monmouth  Of the OATH  THE Oath the  Chancellor  takes at his Admission which we find to be the same with the Prelates and in the like humble Posture upon the Knee and usually Administred by the Register of the Order As to his Robe it was at first the same with the Prelates both for Cloth and Colour but his proportion of Cloth far less having allowed him but Yards when the Prelate had nor but Timber of Minever gross where the Prelate had beside a large quantity of other Furs nor was the Colour confined to one kind until the constitutions of this Office appointed it to be  Crimson as was the Prelates for no doubt it was before annually changed as his was to the Colour of the KnightsCompanions Surcoats however by the Picture of the ancient Habits of the Officers it is conspicuous it was debared the Royal Badges wherewith the Prelates Rose was Embroidred when the Colour of the Prelates Robe was changed to Murray the Chancellors had the same Alteration and was Trim'd alike in all other particulars The proportion allowed to Sir  Thomas Smith  for his Livery  Anno    Eliz  was Yards of Murray Velvet Yards of Sarcenet for the Lining one Garter wrought with Pearls of Damask Gold for the Shoulder one Lace or Cordon with Buttons and Tassels of blue Silk and  Venice  Gold and the same Materials and Quantities were afterwards distributed out of the Sovereigns great Wardrobe to the succeeding Chancellors  BUT  Anno    Car  I The Prelate and Chancellor endeavouring a Reformation in this Habit the Dye both of the Prelates and this Officers Robe was changed into Purple  BESIDES this Robe the Chancellor of the Order hath an honourable Badge of Distinction assigned him to wear first granted to Sir  William Peters  and his Successors the th of  October  and  Ph  and  Mar viz  a golden Rose enclosed within a Garter which he and his Successors Chancellors of the Order have ever since worn daily about their Necks at first it was Pendant in a GoldChain but since in a Purple Ribband It seems something of this Design had been in Agitation a little before so soon as the Chancellorship became vested in a Layman for King  Edward  VI's Statutes did Ordain  That the Chancellor should wear about his Neck a Cross of the Order with a red Rose in a white of Gold all compassed within a Garland of red and white Roses  AND because it was suggested to King  Charles  I That there were different Accounts and Uncertainties contained in some Books concerning the Wearing of this Badge He by Warrant dated at  Oxford  the th of  December  in the st Year of his Reign ordained Sir  James Palmer  Kt and Bart Chancellor of the said Order and his Successors  should wear about his Neck at  all times in Honour of his said Place that thereby he may be known to be of that Office and Dignity as hath been accustomed a Medal or Jewel of Gold enamelled with a red Rose  within a Garter of Blue enamel with this Sentence inscribed  Hony soit qui mal y pense  or such an one as we or the rest of the KnightsCompanions of the said Most Noble Order of the Garter do or shall from time to time hereafter wear in our Collars of the said Order in particular Reference to us or them And in the Reverse thereof he shall bear the Escutcheon of St  George  enamelled within a Garter also in reference to the Order it self which he only shall wear hanging by a light purple Ribband or in a gold Chain as hath been accustomed  AMONG the Officers of the Order the Chancellor is seated next beneath the Prelate and in all Proceedings and Sessions goeth and sitteth on his left Hand And as it was ordered by the Constitutions of the Officers That if the Chancellor hapned to be a Layman he should be also a Knight and have other personal Endowments So did King  Charles  I conceive it requisite to confer some further Mark of Distinction upon this Officer in relation to Place and Precedence without the Order to which effect there passed a Decree in a Chapter assembled by the Sovereign at  Whitehall  the d of  April  present the Earls of  Mulgrave Montgomery Rutland Carlisle Holland Suffolk Pembroke Arundel  and  Surrey Salisbury Dorset Barkshire  and  Northampton That Sir  Francis Crane  the present Chancellor and all others that should succeed him in that Place hereafter shall in right of that Place in all Assemblies and upon all Occasions be ranked and placed immediately aft  r KnightsPrivyCouncellors and before the Chancellor of the Exchequer the Persons holding both Places being in  Pari gradu  and consequently before all others whom the said Chancellor is to precede  c  AND to the intent the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Place may be certainly known  May  the th  Jac  I it was thus established  That the Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Garter the PrivyCouncellors the Master of the Courts of  Wards  and  Liveries  the Chancellor and Under Treasurer of the  Exchequer  Chancellor of the  Dutchy  the Chief Justice of the Court of  King's Bench  the Master of the  Rolls  the Chief Justice of the Court of  CommonPleas  the Chief Baron of the  Exchequer  and all other Judges and Barons  of the Degree of the Coif should have Place and Precedency in all Places and upon all Occasions before the younger Sons of Viscounts and Barons and before all Baronets c  THE aforesaid Constitutions provide the Chancellor of the Order an Habitation within the Castle of  Windsor  as well as the Prelate which is the SouthWest Tower in the lower Ward of the Castle call'd the  Chancellor's Tower  The Possession thereof had been for some time in the Power of others and therefore by a Chapter convened at  Whitehall Nov  th  Car  I it was restored unto Sir  Francis Crane  then Chan  ellor of the Order and after his Decease to descend to his Successors These Constitutions also ordained him the like Liveries at the Table and Court of the Sovereign as were allowed to the Prelate  AT the first Erection of this Office the Chancellor had no Pension awarded him until the Constitutions in reference to the Officers were Established At that time there was conferr'd on him a Pension of  l per Annum  in consideration of his Employment or else an allowance proportionate in Fees Offices or other Promotions over and above his Lodgings in the Castle and Liveries at Court But as to Fees and Perquisites there are none to be Claimed by this Officer and for that Reason he not only possesses the said Pension but all his disbursements allowed him even to Paper Wax and Wafers and indeed those who enjoyed the Office esteem'd it as a degradation of their Post to receive either fee or gratuity for any affair Transacted within the Order and Sir  Thomas Rowe  sometime Chancellor affirmed  That his Office was an Office of Honour and not of Fees and that he had always excepted against Fees for the disbursement of the Sovereign's Money  Tho' he acknowledged some had bestowed on his Clerk a small gratuity for the bare Ingrossing of an Alms Knights Patent but nothing farther  AND because the Custody of the Seals of the Order appertains to this Officer it will be here the fittest Place to mention something of them By the Statutes of  Edw  III they were to have a Common Seal This is confirmed by the Statutes of King  Hen  V and since named the Great Seal of the Order The use of this is  not only to Seal the Original Statutes appointed to remain perpetually within the Treasury of  Windsor  College as also those Copies of which each KnightCompanion is obliged to conserve one but likewise all Letters of Licence to any of the KnightsCompanions desirous of winning Honour abroad and all Mandates and Certificates relating to the Order  AFTER what Model the first Seal was compos'd we have no exact Relation  Polydore Virgil  tells us That when the Founder of the Order had fixed Choice of St  George  for its Patron he represented him Armed and Mounted on an Horse bearing a Silver Shield and thereon a Red Cross but whether St  George  thus designed was on the first Seal or only a Scutcheon of his Arms as in latter times is uncertain But his Author observes that the Founder Habited his Soldiers in white Jackets or Coats and on their Breasts and Backs sowed Red Crosses parallel to the Arms assigned to St  George  as well as to the Kingdom of  England  put under his Patronage which Arms the Sovereigns of the Order have ever since exhibied in their Standards But besides this Common Seal King  Hen  V in the th Year of his Reign Instituted a privy Signet in case the Sovereign should be called out of this Kingdom upon weighty Affairs The intent thereof was to affix it to all Acts passed by the Sovereign beyond Sea to distinguish them from those of his Deputies in  England  King  Hen  VIII's Statutes Ordain the making both of a Common Seal and Signet and direct that the Arms of the Order should be Engraven upon each of them The Common Seal used in his Reign was a Garter within it a Shield having the Cross of St  George  impaling the National Arms the said Shield encompassed with two Branches hanging from the Regal Crown which debruses part of the Garter the Signet being designed after the same manner but less  Temp Jac  I it suffered no other alteration but only in the National Arms by admitting the Quarterings of  Scotland  and  Ireland  and newfashioning the Crown omitting the suspension of the Shield  THERE was a Seal made at the beginning of the Reign of King  Cha  I which being esteemed too little for the Grandure and Honour of the Sovereigns Commissions  it was afterwards Decreed in Chapter held th of  April  Car I  That a new one should be made of a larger Size with the accustomed Arms and Motto and the care thereof commited to Sir  Thomas Rowe  Chancellor  which Command he Executed with all due care and regard as is manifestly evident by the nobleness of the design One Representation being St  George  in Armour adorned with a waveing Mantle his Bever open his Helmet plumed holding a Shield of his Arms in his left Hand and striking with a Sword in his right his Body mounted on a bold Horse Trampling over a Dragon which Assails the Champion the whole Figure is well contracted and the Sun a Rock the Bones of devoured Men and a Mountain in  Lointon  in it is Circumscribed  Magnum sigillum Nobilis Ordinis Garterij  having the enrichments of festons between every Word placed pentagonally The other Representation is the Royal Garter imperially Crowned enclosing a Shield of the Arms of St  George  impaling the Sovereign's Arms the same Bordered with Fretwork and other Ornaments in Cartouche In the same decree direction was given also for a new Signet the former being thought too big for Letters and this was an Oval shaped so from its Impression which was the Garter Crowned wherein was St  George  and the Sovereigns Arms impaled  IT was at the same Chapter further 'decreed  That all Legations to deliver this Order to Foreign Princes all other Acts bearing the Stile of Commissions all Patents of Offices and Fees all Grants or Licences sent out of the Kingdom should be Sealed with this Seal which should be henceforward called the Great Seal of the Order so also the Book of Statutes sent to Elect Knights or Foreign Princes being fixed to a Label of Blue Silk and held according to antient Custom and that all Letters concerning the Order whether of signification of Election or Lieutenancy or Summons upon prorogation or other Directions from the Sovereign should only be Sealed with the Signet Moreover these Seals were appointed to be thenceforth Born before the Sovereign in all Publick Assemblies during the  Celebration of St  George  's Feast or in other its Solemnities by the Chancellor of the Order in a Purse of blue Velvet  and Command given to Sir  Thomas Rowe  to provid one a  cordingly on the foreside of which Purse was richly Embroidred by a GoldSmith with  Venice  Gold and Silver Gold and Silver Purls and Plates and variety of  Naples  Silks the Arms of St  George  impaling the Sovereign surrounded with a Garter Crowned having a very fair Running Work or Compartment round about it the charge of which amounted to  l    s    d  BY the Statutes of Institution it was ordained That in case the KnightsCompanions to whose care the Sovereign did commit the Seal of the Order should upon lawful Occasions be absent from Court it behoves him to leave it behind him with some other KnightCompanion to present to the Sovereign to the intent it might be always in readiness but if the Sovereign be out of His Kingdom then the disposal of it was commited to the Deputies and the Signet of the Order should have a Warrant for all such Acts and Decrees as should b  confirmed there  THE distance from Court was by the Constitutions restricted to Miles and by the Statutes of King  Hen  VIII to upon consideration whereof we find Sir  Thomas Rowe  Chancellor having some occasions  A  no    Car  I to be absent above Miles tendred the Seals to the Sovereign who was pleased to dispence with the Statutes and permitted him to keep them nevertheless  § THE Registers Oath Mantle Badge Privileges and Pension fall next under our consideration he was one of the three Constituted at the Institution of the Order under the Title of  Registrator  and  Registrarius  and so is called in the Statutes of King  Hen  V elsewhere in the Books of the Order  Scriba  and  Actuarius  What were the first Registers names we cannot discover till the Reign of King  Hen  V But it may be presumed they were Canons of  Windsor  because this Office was at first assigned to one of that College besides the Registers from the Reign of King  Henry  V to the beginning of King  Henry  VIIIth Reign were also Canons of this College among  whom was  John Coningham  and the first found called so as the Fragments of a Glass Inscription in  Clare  Church near  Windsor  where he was Rector attests The first Dean of  Windsor  Constituted Register of the Order was  John Vesey  Anno  Hen  VIII many of whose Successors in this Deanry have since been admitted nevertheless as they were Canons not Deans of  Windsor  and tis not improbable the Deans were Elected to this Office as being enabled to support the Reputation of the Registership with the Revenue of his Deanry better than any of the Canons with the addition of the Pension But at a Chapter held at  Whitehall  the d of  April    Car  I The Sovereign thought it convenient that the Office of Dean and Register should concenter in one and the same Person as formerly and therefore commanded this his Pleasuer to be Enrolled among the Annals of the Order that so it might pass in the future Times from Example into Rule  BY the Constitutions of the Office a secular Person is made capable of it no less than an Ecclesiastick how be it  He is to be a Man of singular integrity  eminent quality a Knight and signalized for Experience and Learning but if an Ecclesiastick then must he be a Person of consummate Erudition  a professor of Divinity or Law either Canon or Civil  and a Dignitarian in some Cathedral Church or else a Canon at  Windsor  THE substance of his Oath in the Statute of the Institutions was  That he should enter upon the Registry with all Fidelity the Scrutinies Elections Penalties Reconciliations and all other Acts relating to the Order  to which was added that he shall faithfully Discharge his Duty in all things But in King  Hen  VIIIth Days the Oath enjoyned him differs nothing from that of the Prelates and Chancellors  AT his Admission he takes this Oath Kneeling while the Prelate used to pronounce the Words as  Anno    Mar  and  Ph  and  Mar  but in his absence as  Anno    Eliz  the Chancellor administred it  Anno    Car  I the Prelate Chancellor and Register took their Oaths at one time and then it was thus Ordered first the Register took it Kneeling between the Sovereign's Knees the Black Rod holding the Evangelists and the  Garter  read the Words out of the black Book this done the Register read the Words of the Prelates Oath when he was Sworn and in the last place did the like to the Chancellor after this manner did Garter read the Words to the Registers admitted  Car  I and  Car  II We cannot trace the Habit this Officer had assigned him at the Erection of the Order but it afterwards appears that his Allowance was the same with the Chancellors consisting of Yards of Woollen Cloth and Timber of Minever gross equalent to what those KnightsCompanions had allotted who were under the degree of an Earl The Habit he is pourtrayed in at a proceeding of King  Hen  VIIIth Reign shews it to be Ecclesiastical a black Gown a Surplice over that reaching to his Ancles and thereon a Mantle of Furs but the Constitutions of his Office restricted him to none wherein there seems a defect since they have assignd Habits to the Garter and black Rod Notwithstanding by a Draught of the Officers in their ancient Dress it is plainly demonstrable to be a Mantle somewhat of a Russel colour Faced with a Pane of blue whereon is Embroidred a Flowerdeluce Crowned Gold then another Pane red thereon a Lyon Passant gardant Crowned Gold and so they are alternately placed to the bottom to this Mantle belong Cordons of Silk blue and yellow  SINCE that time not only the Registers but also Garters and Black Rods Robes underwent some Alterations for by a Decree in Chapter called at St  James Jun  and  Ph  and  Mar  these Officers were assigned Mantles of crimson Satin Lined with Taffaty and a Scutcheon of St  George  's Arms Embroidred on the left Shoulder but not encircled with a Garter having the same Buttons and Tassels as wereappointed to the Prelate and Chancellor the proportion of Satin assigned to each Mantle was Yards and as many Yards of white Taffaty  AND tho' the Registers Mantle was  Ann    Eliz  composed of the preceeding Materials and had like Trimming yet they agree not in their Proportions here being allowed Yards of crimson Satin and but of Taffaty from hence these Mantles continued immutable  until the th of  Feb    Car  II when there Issued a Warrant to the Master of the great Wardrobe to prepare for this Officer as also for Garter and the Black Rod for their Liveries Mantles of scarlet Satin each containing and Yards of white Taffaty for Lining but consonant in all other Punctilio's with the former yet why the colour was altered is not expressed  THE Register seems to have been represented with a Scrowle in his Hand for his Badge and by the proceedings in Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign Pictured with a Book both proper Symbols of his Office In Dr  Christopher Wren  's Registership the Sovereign Commanded him to cover the red Book of the Order with crimson Velvet and assigned for the Garter two Pens in Saltire interlacing the Garter above with these two Letters  C R  Crowned all being richly Embroidred as also the Border with  Venice  Gold and Silver and various colours of  Naples  Silk by  Harrison  the Sovereign's Embroiderer with a Clasp in Imitation of the Garter surrounding the Representation of St  George  which cost  l    s    d  This Book he was Ordered to bear before his Breast on all Solemn Occasions when he wore his Mantle and for his better Convenience he made a Belt and an Ouch to hang it by  So high a Regard had the Sovereigns of this Order not only to this Officer but likewise to Garter and Black Rod that they took them into a particular Protection and by the Constitutions of their Offices granted them  That they their Goods and Servants should severally remain under the Safeguard of the Sovereign and if any Injury or Violence should chance to be offered them either by Subjects or Forreigners whensoever they should exhibit their Complaint to the Sovereign either himself or the KnightsCompanions should afford them Justice  but if the adverse Party should refuse to submit his Cause to the Sovereign then the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions should shew themselves so far inclinable towards these Officers as to be ready to allow them all favour countenance c  consistent with Justice and Equity  UPON the strength and Security of this ancient Privilege to avoid the prolongation of a Law Suit Dr  Christopher Wren  Register Petitioned the Sovereign in Chapter held at  Whitehall  the th of  April    Car  I against one  Thornhill  who under Pretence of Digging for SaltPeter had so Undermined his Pigeonhouse Built on the Rectory of  Kno  l Magna  in  Wiltsh  that it fell down and upon reading of the Petition it was resolved by the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions  That they would confider the Grant in the Constitutions and until it was farther declared the Chancellor of the Order should have Power upon Information of any rigour upon Controverse begun in any other Court to write Letters under the Signet of the Order that all vexation against them should be superseded until Information of the cause were given to and determination in the Cause resumed by the Sovereign or leave of him obtained to Proceed  After this it is set down that  Thornhill  was Summoned before the Lords Commissioners of the Navy and his negative Answer given in and represented to the Sovereign in another Chapter conven'd the th of  October  ensuing whereupon it was ordered  That the Chancellor should write to the same Lords Commissioners and another to the Earls of  Pembroke Arundel  and  Dorset  three of the KnightsCompanions to Empower them that they or any three of them should cause the said  Thornhill  to be brought before them and likewise write to any of the Inhahitants of  Knoil  to view and testifie the Truth to hear any further proof on the behalf of either Party and to give Sentence according to Justice that so a tedious Suit of Law might be prevented and the Dignity of this most noble Order protected  These Commands of the Chancellor being Executed and Certificates returned from the Country the Knigh  s Companions in a Chapter held the th of  May    Car  I were moved to peruse them but before they could meet  Thornhill  fled and the Prosecution of this business ceased Upon the same footing was it that the said Dr  Wren  obtained from King  Cha  I His Gracious Protection for himself Servants and Estate literally expressed in the late War  as t  Violaters of that Order would answer this our contrary at their Peril Da  ed at  Oxford  under the Signet of this our Order the  th  Day of  Dec  in the  th  Year of our Reign  THIS Officer by the Constitutions hath a Pension of l  per Annum  or proportionable in Fees Offices or other Emoluments and  Ann  and  Ph  and  Mar  the same numerical Pension was conferred on  Owen Oglethorp  Dean of  Windsor  out of the Exchequer until some Ecclesiastical Preferment of like value should devolve on him The same was confirmed to Dr  Maxey  by Decree in Chapter  Jac  I and afterwards to Dr  Beaumont  by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of  ngland    Jac  I but there needed no Allotment of Lodgings at  Windsor  to this Officer as there was to the rest since both the Canons and Dean were provided of Houses belonging to their Ecclesiastical Dignities within the College at the Er  ction of the Order  § THE  fourth Officer of the Order is Garter  He was ordained by King  Henry  V with the advice and consent of all the KnightsCompanions who for the Honour of the Order was pleased he should be the principal Officer within the College of Arms and chief of the Heralds The Services enjoyned him relating to the Order were in preceding Times performed by the  Windsor  Herald of Arms an Officer created with that Title by K  Edward  III much about the time of his Erecting this Order and an Annual Pension of Marks payable out of the Exchequer by Letters Patent for Life which was confirmed by King R II  SIR  William Brugges  was the Person first created Garter and called in the Institution of his Office  Jartier Roy d'armys des Anglois  but elsewhere stiled  Willielmus Brugges alias Dictus Gartier Rex Armorum  This Sir  William  became a great Benefactor to St  George  's Church at  Stamford  and in the Windows of the Chancel caused to be Represented King  Edward  III with his twenty five KnightsCompanions kneeling Habited in their Mantles and Surcoats of Arms but now much shattered and defaced  John Smert  his Successor had this Office conferred on him by Letters Patents under this Title  Rex Armorum de Garteria  and  John Wrythe  was stiled  Principalis Heraldus Officiarius inclyti Ordinis Garterij Armorum{que} Rex Anglicorum  but Sir  Gilbe rt Dethick  leaving out  Heraldus  joyned  Principalis Rex  which still continues  IN the Constitutions of his Office he is called  Garterus R  x Armorum Angliae  whom the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions have decreed to be a Gentleman of Blood and Arms of unspotted Reputation and Born within the Kingdom of  England  besides as King  Hen  V did before so doth King  Hen  VIII declare that he shall be chief of all the O  ficers of Arms dependant upon the Crown of  England  THE substance of his Oath administred by the Register at his admission whilst he humbly kneeleth at the Sovereign's Feet in the Chapter House is    To yield Obedienc  to the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions    To k  ep Silence and not disclose the Secrets of the Order    To m  ke signification of the Death of each KnightCompanion    To execute all things fa  thfully committed to his Care    To enquire diligently after all the noble Acts of the KnightsCompanions and certifie them to the Register    To be faithful in the exercise of his Office  AND such an Oath Sir  Christopher Barker  took at a Chapter held at  Greenwich    Hen  VIII when he was made Garter  AS for a particular Habit we do not find any inserted in the Great Wardrobe whence it is presu  ed he was at first distinguished from the rest of the Officers of the Order by his Coat Embroidred with the Sovereign's Arms like as the Provincial King's then wore But after the Constitutions of the Officers were Estab  ished there was assigned him a Habit or Mantle in all respects resembling the Register saving that the Ground whereon the Lyons and flowerdeluces were Embroidred was entirely Red and this to b  wore only at the publick Solemnities of the Order Queen  Mary  Commanded it to be made of crimson S  tin and so it remained till the Restoration when the Colour was altered to scarlet  THIS Officer is appointed to bear a white Rod or Scepter at every Feast of St  George  the Sovereign being present gilded at both ends and at the top the Arms of the Order impaling the Sovereign's Arms pourtray'd on an oblong Cube Crowned but no directions are given in the Constitutions for this Crown no  for that Ducal one on his Head wherewith his Effigies has been represented and yet at all great Solemnities is never used that we can discover There was assigned him by Queen  Eliz  a Badge of Gold to be worn daily by him and his Successors before the Breast in a gold Chain or Ribband and thereon Ennamelled the Sovereign's Arms Crowned with an Imperial Crown and both surrounded with the Garter But Sir  Edward Walker  when made Garter obtained the Sovereign's leave to Impale therein St  Georges  's Arms with those of the Sovereign's which Badge is alike on both sides  THERE is an House appointed for his Habitation within  Windsor  Castle called Garters Tower It was by Chapter annexed for ever to the Office of Garter and restored to Sir  William Segar  's Possession d of  May  By the Constitution of his Office he is to be allowed Barons Service in the Sovereign's Court and his Table Served next after the Dean of the Chapel with such Liveries as of old were accustomed  IT appears that King  Hen  V after his erecting this Office died before he had settled a Pension upon Sir  William Brugges  for supportation of his little Estate which the KnightsCompanions taking into consideration and that he might more honourably comport himself to the Service of the Order till the young King should come to Age they being assembled in a Chapter with the consent of the Prelate decreed the said Sir  William  to receive of each of them at every Feast of St  George  as is set down  viz  Of the Bishop of  Winchester  Prelate  Marks  Dukes  Marks  Of every  Earl  Nobles  Baron or Baronet  Nobles  Knight Batchelor  Nobles  THE first payment was agreed to be pay'd down and so to remain in force annually with request to the absent Knights that for the Honour of the Order and causes in th  Instrument express'd they would approve of their Ordinance which passed under the Seal of the Order Dated at  Windsor  Afterwards King  Hen  VI in consideration of his Services to his Father and himself with consent of his Council granted to the said  Brugges  by Letters Patent a Pension of l  er Annum  out of the Fee Farm of the City of  Winchester  during his pleasure which Pension upon the surrender of his Patent he granted anew to him and  Agne  his Wife for their Lives and the longer liver of them and when this Office upon Sir  William Brugges  death was devolved on  John Sm  rt Guyenne  herald  April    Hen  VI he had the yearly Sum of  l  granted him therewith for Life out of the Exchequer But his Successor  John Wrythe Norroy  obtained an increase of Pension to l  per Annum  made payable out of the small Customs of the City of  London  this annual Sum was afterwards confirmed to Garter by the Constitution of his Office and an Augmentation from the then KnightsCompanions additional to the Pensions granted by their Predecessors upon the Death of King  Hen  V  Of  A Duke  Pounds  A Marquess  Marks  An Earl  Marks  A Baron  Nobles  A Knight Batchelor  Nobles  IN succeeding times the Sovereign thought fit to augment this Pension to l  per Annum  now payable out of the Revenue settled upon the Order and the KnightsCompanions yet to enlarge their Sallery which they did the Sovereign assenting by the decree made in a Chapter held at  Windsor  and  Sept An  wherein it was ordained  That their Officer Sir  William Segar  Garter Knight King of Arms of that Order should then and from thenceforth have renew'd and paid unto him certain annual Fees and Pensions anciently enjoyed by his Predecessors with a surplus of    l  per Annum  which his Majesty's Act of Royal Bounty hath given to  his said Servant for his better support and maintenance as also of Prince  Charles  Prince of  Wales  the Sum of  l  and of every Duke of the Blood  l  all other Estates  viz  a Duke not of the Blood  l  a Marquess    Marks an Earl    Marks a Viscount    Nobles a Baron  s  and a Knight Batchelor that shall be of the Order  s d  all which said Sums of Money according to the several degrees of their Estates are to be paid continues the Decree unto the said Garter or his assigns yearly at St  Georges  's Feast or immediately after as well by the Knights then present as by those that shall be absent or hereafter are to succeed in the said Order and after the decease of the said Garter to his Successors for ever  AT St  Georges  's Feast Celebrated at  Windsor  and of  April Anno    Car  II Sir  Edward Walker  then Garter representing by Petition that the annual Pension of the installed Knights then in Arrear for one Year amounted to  l    s    d  according to their proper proportion the Sovereigns Share he being to pay for all stranger Knights amounted at that time to  l    s    d  and humbly praying that his Majesty would grant to him and his Successors an l  per Annum  out of the Revenue settled to the use of the Order in lieu not only of those said Pensions payable from the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions both Strangers and Subjects but for resigning his Claim to his annual Pension of  l  in consideration for preparing Scutcheons and removal of Atchievements This Petition the Sovereign was pleased to refer to a Committe of the KnightsCompanions who namely the Duke of  Albemarl  the Earls of  Lindsey Manchester Sandwich  and  Stafford  who being attended by Garter and weighing the event of the Petition offered their opinions to the Sovereign to grant him the said l  per Annum  in lieu of what he offered to quit whereby the interest of this Office might be preserved in a more compendious Method than it was his Majesty exempted from those small payments for Strangers and the KnightsSubjects themselves were discharged from their annual Pension and his Majesty ratifying the same shortly after Sir  Henry de Vi    the Chancellor was ordered to pay unto Garter and his Successors the said annual Pension of  l  which was  accordingly put in Execution as an Equivalent for all Fees and Salaries relating to the Order of the Garter  THE Duty of this Officer in general is to perform or cause to be effected all Transactions whatsoever the Sovereign or Prelate or Chancellor shall enjoyn him in relation to this Most Noble Order  § THE fifth and last Officer is the  BlackRod  This Officer was instituted by the Founder King  Ed  III but whether at the first Erection of the Order doth not appear Howbeit within a few Years after  E  III the King conferr'd to  William Whitehorse  Esq for Life  Officium Hostiarii Capellae Regis infra Castrum de  Windesore with a Fee of  d  a Day out of his Exchequer  Anno    Hen  IV this Office is called  Officium Virgarij comitivae de la Garter infra Castrum Regis de Windesore  and under that Denomination was confirmed to  Thomas Sye  with the Fees and Emoluments thereunto expressed In the Patent to his Successor  John Athilbrigg Ann    H  it is stiled  Officium Virgarij sive Ostiarij  c Afterwards it hath the Title  Officium Virgaebajuli coram Rege ad festum Sancti  Georgii  infra Castrum Regis de  Windesore And ever since it runs in the Patents by the Appellation of  VirgaeBajulus Virgarius  or  Nigrivergifer  But in the Constitutions of his Office he hath the Title of  Hostiarius  and under the restriction of these Qualifications that he be a Gentleman of Blood and Arms born within the Sovereigns Dominions and if he be not a Knight at his admission into the Office he ought then to be Knighted As  Garter  was Entituled the Principal Officer of Arms so was the  BlackRod  for the Honour of the Order appointed the Chief Usher in the Kingdom And as he is so and frequently called GentlemanUsher of the  BlackRod  so we shall wave as we did in  Garter  all things appertaining to his Employments otherwise than what directly is included in this Most Noble Order  IN a Chapter held at  Whitehall  the th of  February    Car  I It was decreed  That the Office of the BlackRod should from thenceforth successively as soon as the same should become void James Maxwell  Esq then enjoying it  be annexed to some one of the GentlemenUshers Dailywaiters  whom the Sovereign should appoint  THIS was carried upon the Petition of the GentlemenUshers Dailywaiters seconded by the Lord Chamberlain the EarlMarshal and others KnightsCompanions as is evident from another Petition of theirs to the Sovereign in Chapter assembled at  Oxford  the th of  January    Car  I But some Years after this the Lord  Lanrick  Secretary for  Scotland  had on Mr  Maxwell  's behalf obtained the Sovereign's Warrant for LettersPatent under the GreatSeal for two Lives  Maxwell  's and Mr  Alexander Thayn  the longest Liver of them whereby the said Decree was frustrate to the GentlemenUshers of which making Complaint in the last mentioned Chapter the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions in regard this latter Grant was not only repugnant to the preceding Decree and the GreatSeal surreptitiously gained but ought likewise to have passed the Seals of the Order order'd  Peter Newton  Esq to be presently sworn into this Office Nevertheless after the Restoration  A D    Newton  being then dead the GentlemenUshers Dailywaiters Petition'd again and  Thayne  was demanded to put in his Answer and the result of the whole was after mature Deliberation in a Chapter held at  Whitehall  the th of  February    Car  II the Decree which fix'd this Office to one of the GentlemenUshers Dailywaiters was confirmed and  John Ayton  one of the Petitioners was sworn GentlemanUsher of the BlackRod which was performed by the Register in the Presence of the Sovereign the Chapter sitting  THE Form of the Oath given to this Officer  temp Hen  VIII was  Truly and Faithfully to observe and keep all the Points of the Statutes of the Order as to him belonged and appertained  HE hath the like Habit with the Register and Garter before described but his Ensign and Badge is somewhat different from Garter's for first it was ordained  That he or his Deputy should carry a BlackRod  whence he hath his Title  before the Sovereign or his Deputy at the Feast of St  George  within the Castle of  Windsor  and at other Solemnities and Chapters of the Order  On the Top of which there ought to be set a Lyon of  England  This Rod serves instead of a Mace and has the same Authority to  apprehend Delinquents and such have offended against the Statutes of this Most Noble Order And where he apprehends any one of the Order as Guilty of some Crime for which he is to be expell'd the Order the manner of it is by touching them with this BlackRod and his Fee for it is  l  HE has assigned him a Golden Badge to be openly worn in a Gold Chain or Ribband before his Breast composed of one of the Knots in the Collar of the Order which tye the Roses together and encompassed with a Garter being alike on both sides which was conferred on him and his Successors by Decree in Chapter held the th of  April    Eliz  'TIS as ancient as  Hen  Vth's Reign for there's a House in  Windsor  Castle granted to this Officer by LettersPatent during Life And the same Provision is made for him by the Constitutions of his Office It is situate on the Southside of the Castle in the middle Ward The said Constitutions give him BaronService at Court and Livery thereto appertaining and besides these the keeping of the said Castle and the two Parks adjacent  KING  Charles  I having taken into his Hands the little Park of  Windsor  and bestow'd it upon  James Maxwell  then Usher of the BlackRod He at a Chapter held at  Whitehall  the th of  November  decreed That as the Custody of the said Park was conferr'd on  Maxwell  in right of his Office so the same should for ever after be annex'd thereto and not to be disposed of but under the Great Seal of the Order and that only to the Usher of the Order for the time being  LASTLY this Officer had anciently a Fee of  d per diem  which we find continu'd down in the LettersPatents whereby this Office was granted Besides which the Constitutions of his Office allow him an annual Pension of  l  heretofore paid him out of the Exchequer but by King  Charles  I assigned him out of  l per Ann  settled upon the Order touching which and the Payment of the Officers Pensions upon the new Establishment is the next Section  § KING  James  I taking into his Royal Breast the Constitution of this Most Noble Order that it was in the Nature of a Distinct Sovereignty govern'd by Laws and Conventions proper to the Body and himself as Sovereign in Matters immediately relating thereunto had the sole and uncontroulable Authority of revising adding or explaining and finding that the Pensions paid to the Officers of the Order as those to the AlmsKnights and some other Expences had been anciently made payable out of his Exchequer by vertue of the Great Seals of  England  or otherwise by PrivySeals and conceiving it incongruous that the Officers should claim their Pensions by vertue of any other Seal than that of the Order for it is in some kind derogatory to the Honour of the Order to permit other Seals to be used within the same He thereupon with twelve KnightsCompanions in a Chapter held at  Whitehall  the d of  May    Jac  I passed a Decree  That all things concerning the Order should hereafter be ratify'd under the Seal of the Order only and in particular that the Grants of poor Knights Places after their being Signed by the Sovereign should be passed under the Seal of the Order only and none other  And the Year following the Chancellor was ordered  That he should take Advice of the Sovereign's  AttorneyGeneral  how by Vertue of the Seal of the Order the Pensions  given to the Poor Knights  might be paid and receiv'd  His Majesty's further Pleasure being  That all Grants and Payments concerning the Order should afterwards be confirmed under the Seal of the Order only and by Vertue thereof  AS to the AlmsKnights Patents this Decree was of Force and Validity but in the other Generals how far it was pursu'd we know not for in some of them it grew obsolete and useless But in a Chapter called at  Windsor  the d of  April    Car  I a Debate arose about setting a Part of the Annual Summ of  l  out of the Receipts of his Majesty's Exchequer to be employ'd particularly in discharge of Expences towards the Feasts of the Order Legations to Foreign Princes Payment of the Officers Pensions c disbursed for the Necessity and Reputation of this Noble Order Afterwards at a  Chapter held the th of  April    Car  I that Sovereign ratify'd his Royal Assignation and increased his Bounty to  l per Ann  setling it for those designs in a Perpetuity for ever and making it payable out of the Customs in the Port of  London  but to be received by the Chancellor of the Order for the time being as Treasurer of this Money of which he was to give up an Account to the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions yearly at St  George  's Feast And in pursuance of this Ratification the AttorneyGeneral had Instructions to draw up a Book for his Royal Signature to Warrant its passing under the Great Seal of  England  which was dispatch'd the LettersPatent bearing  teste  at  Westminster  the d of  January    Car  I Immediately after Sir  Thomas Rowe  the Chancellor of the Order presented a List of the ordinary Fees and Charges of the Order upon which it was agreed to  That there should issue out a standing Commission to the Chancellor under the Great Seal of the Order to warrant the Yearly Payments and he to be discharged according as the said Patent had provided  This Commission passing the Great Seal the d of  May    Car  I the Sovereign thereby impower'd the Chancellor to make payable out of the yearly Revenue of  l  all and every the yearly Fees Pensions Salaries and other Payments due and payable to the Officers of the Order AlmsKnights or others appertaining to the Order either by Charter Grant or Assignation under the Seal and Signet of the Order or by any other Lawful way whatsoever and in particular        l  s     To  Himself as Chancellor      per Ann  Register of the Order      Garter Principal King of Arms      Usher of the BlackRod      Thirteen AlmsKnights         Total         AND Sir  Thomas Rowe  and in his Absence beyond Sea Sir  James Palmer  DeputyChancellor receiv'd out of the Sovereigns Receipts of Subsidies Customs and Imposts  the  l per Ann  out of which they paid the Annual Pensions abovenamed under the Title of  certain  and  ordinary Charges  as also such as come within the Denomination of Accidental and Extraordinary Expences of which kind in their time were  Mantles when the Sovereigns pleas'd to bestow them on the KnightsCom  a  ions  Plate for the Altar in St  George  's  Chappel  at  Windsor  Embroidery of the Purse for holding the Seals  Removal of Atchievements and Plates against Installations  Escutcheons set up at St  George  's  Feast  Privy Seals

Order  BY which we are easily inform'd what ought to be accounted extraordinary Expences towards the Discharge whereof this Sum was to be employ'd as far as it would reach to mitigate the Cost the great Wardrobe formerly stood taxed with Provisions of the Order both for foreign Embassies and Expences at Home  THE Manner of the Chancellor's passing his Account as directed by the said Commission was thus done by Sir  James Palmer  He humbly moved the Sovereign in Chapter held the th of  October    Car  I That it would please him to view the Disbursements made for the Expences of the Order which thereupon being Examined by the Knights in the Sovereign's Presence the same were found agreeable to the Directions of the Commission and the Payments justify'd by the Acquittance of every Officer to whom any Fee was due no Payment having been made without the Sovereign's Hand first to Authorize it Allwhich being seen and allow'd the Account wherein his Disbursements exceeded his Receipts  l    s    s  was esteemed Equitable and Just and passed by the Subscription of  Charles  then Prince of  Wales  the Earls of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery Salisbury Holland  rkshire  Duke  Hamilton  and the Earl of  Northumberland  § THE Executions of these Offices is the last thing here to be described For tho' all the Officers are strictly obliged to give personal Attendance to their Offices yet in case of Sickness Absence out of the Kingdom or other emergent Reasons the Sovereign is pleased to dispence with them and constitute others to Officiate in their stead who on such Occasions wear the Robe of that Officer whom they represent so in case of Vacancy the Absence of the Prelate at the Grand Feast celebrated at  Windsor    Hen  VI is noted in the  Black Book  to have been upon just Cause and the Bishop of  Bangor  officiated Divine Service and next Morning celebrated the Mass  pro defunctis  The following Year his Place in these religious Duties was supply'd by the Bishop of  Salisbury  as  Ann  and  Hen  VI and at all times of the Prelates absence the Sovereign hath made known his Will what Bishop should supply for him The Office of Chancellor hath been executed by Proxies and to this may first be referred a Passage in the  Black Book  where Dr  Taylor  hath the Title of  ViceChancellor  Of later times when Sir  Thomas Rowe  was employ'd in an Embassy into  Germany  Sir  James Palmer  Kt one of the GentlemenUshers of the PrivyChamber was deputed by the Sovereign to the Chancellorship during his Absence having the Purse with the Seals deliver'd to him the th of  May    Car  I being sworn by the Register of the Order  durante deputatione beneplacito Regis  which Clause was likewise annex'd in the Deputy  Chancellor  's Oath  Car  II Upon Sir  Thomas Rowe  's return and indisposition  Car  I Sir  James  was again deputed  Chancellor  and a third time  Car  I continu'd Deputy  Chancellor  unto the Death of Sir  Thomas Rowe  of which the Sovereign being inform'd at  Oxford  reserved the disposal of this Office 'till Sir  James  's return to Court and then commanded him to wear the Badge and Ribband about his Neck 'till a Chapter of the  Order  compleated his admittance  IN the Vacancy of the Registership  Ann  H VIII  Thomas Ruthall  Bishop of  Durham  supply'd it And  Ann  and  Eliz  Dr  Day  Dean of  Windsor  executed the Office and attended at the Feasts of St  George  as DeputyRegister Dr  George Carew  then Register having Licence by his Patent to execute it by himself or Deputy being dispenc'd with by the Queen in case of Sickness or other Impediment After his Decease Dean  Day  was commanded to execute the Office during its Vacancy being Years which he effected 'till he was advanced to the Bishoprick of  Winchester An    Eliz  upon which Dr  Robert Bennet  who succeeded him in his Deanry was the same Year admitted Register Afterwards Dr  Beaumont  being much broken with Age and other Diseases Dr  John King  the junior Canon supplied his Place  THE Office of Garter hath been supplied by Deputation For in those Embassies with the Ensigns of the Order to Foreign Princes where special Occasions detained Garter at home some of the Kings or Heralds of Arms have been order'd upon those Employments upon the Recommendation of Garter to the Sovereign where of there are several Instances the last of  Gregory King  Esq  Lancaster  Herald who lately carried over the Habit to the Elector of  Hanover  So also in case of Vacancy for we find that  Clarencieux  King of Arms executed this Office after Sir  Gilbert Dethick  's Death in  January    Eliz  being then sent with the Earl of  Darby  to the  French  King  Henry  III As also in Reference to the Preparations the th of  April  following and Service performed thereat and at the Feast of St  George  ensuing  THE Constitution of the Office of BlackRod admit of a Deputy to bear the Rod before the Sovereign where a lawful Occasion impedes his personal Service And Sir  Peter Young  Chief Gentleman Usher performed this Office at the Feast of St  George  held at  Windsor Ann    Car  I  James Maxwell  Esq BlackRod was in  France  upon the Sovereign's Service and after being Mission'd by the King into  Scotland Peter Newton  Esq  supplied his Place at the Feast at  Windsor  th th an  th of  October Anno    Car  I  CHAP IX  § WE come now to treat of the Election of a Knight into the Order according to the Statutes of Institution which Ordains That whensoever any KnightCompanion happens to depart this Life  The Sovereign or his Deputy after certain Notice had thereof should forthwith by his Letters Summon all the KnightsCompanions then within the Realm who were able to come to meet him within six Weeks after such Notice in what convenient Place soever he pleased to assign for the Electing a new Companion into the Society  Thus did the Law of this Most Noble Order in case of Death and to prevent Vacancies at first provide wherewith we evidently find the Practice of elder Times did punctually concur For as soon as Garter in Discharge of his Duty had made Certificate to the Sovereign of a KnightCompanion's Decease or otherwise to the Register of the Order all fitting Diligence was used to fill up the vacant Stall within the Space limited by this Statute or immediately after and for the quicker Dispatch Letters of Summons were issued to the KnightsCompanions to give personal Attendance at the Election In an ancient one upon the Death of Sir  Henry Fitz Hugh  KnightCompanion  Temp Henry  V these particulars were no less pursuant to the Statutes than worthy Observation  I The Day whereon the defunct KnightCompanion died is therein set down  II Direction is given for celebrating Masses according to the Tenor of the Statutes  III Intimation that a Stall is become void by the Knight's Decease  IV The Law of the Order vouched which appoints an Election of another Knight within six Weeks after Certificate made of the Death of the former to avoid as much as may be an interval in Succession  V The Sovereign's Power asserted where he sees Cause to Prorogue the Election  VI An Injunction to attend personally at the Election under a Penalty express'd in the S  atutes  VII The Day Place and Hour for Appearance is with certainty appointed to the End all might Accommodate themselves to be present  VIII The End of coming is mention'd with full Disposition and Preparation  to perform what the Statutes in this Case requir'd  IX Lastly Direction is there given to the Knight summoned that in case his coming to the Chapter was impeded he should certifie the Reason of his Default against the time of his Appearance of the Validity whereof the Sovereign was to be sole Umpire  AND generally of these Topicks and to this Purport were the Letters of Summons in succeeding times composed  THE beforemention'd Branch of the Statutes of Institution hath been sufficiently enforced by Incorporating it into the Statutes  temp H  V and  H  VIII no  hath it since undergone any Alteration howbeit some further Addition and Explanation were annexed to them  Jac  I at a Chapter held at  Windsor  the th of  April  that year where it was decreed  That the Sovereign being advertised of the Death of a KnightCompanion the KnightsCompanions remaining at Court should move him to declare his Pleasure whether h  would that Letters should be sent to all the KnightsCompanions within the Realm to attend his Person for the Choice of a new Knight at a Day by the said Sovereign appointed according to the ancient Statutes of the Order or be pleas'd to def  r the Election until the Feast of St  George  at what time Elections have been most usually made and according as he resolv'd in what Place it should be so it ought  by Letters directed to the KnightsCompanions within the Realm  to  made known unto them  This Deferring or Prorogation of the Election was no new thing tho' not indulged by the Statutes or declared Law before this  Jac  as is evident by the Letter of Summons sent after the Death of Sir  Robert D'U  frevil  Knight Companion  temp H  wherein Notice  is taken of the Limitation given by the Statutes after Certificate of Death  viz  Six Weeks within the Space whereof a new Election was to commence yet where a Chapter for Election could not conveniently be summoned within that limited Time it was sufficient if the Soveraign declared as he did in the said Placart and entered in the Black Book  That being then involved in other Business he could not well attend this Affair and therefore deferr'd the time for Election unto the Eve of St  George  next following  But of later Date this formal Way of Summons by Letter hath been discontinued and only remained to such as are remote and warned only by a verbal Message For the Chancellor of the Order having consulted the Soveraign's Pleasure as to the Day and Place usually acquaints Garter therewith who thereupon goes immediately to the Knights Companions then at Court and desires their Attendance at the Chapter according to the Soveraign's Designation  And here it is to be remarked that no Knight Elect ought to be summoned to a Chapter of Election or are rendered sufficient of giving their Votes therein until they be compleatly installed either in Person or by Proxy Nor indeed did any Necessity intervene or require it till the late rebellious times when the Castle of  Windsor  being Garrison'd by the Parliament's Forces it was not possible for the Duke of  York  and Prince  Rupert  to take Possession of their Stalls as the Law of the Order enjoined Therefore the then Soveraign whose Right it is did  Jan  dispense with their Installations in St  George  's Chapel for the present and invested them with the Privileges of the Order among which the Power of voting in Chapter was one Provided those Princes should first take the Oath given at Installations and afterwards perform the accustomed Ceremonies so soon as it should be thought convenient and the Castle was restored to the Possession of his Majesty In compliance to which Proviso they both then took the Oath and on the Eve of the first F  ast of St  George  after the Restoration the Duke was installed and on the Eve of the second Feast  Car  by the  Earls of  Northumberland  and  Berkshire  and the Prince by the Duke of  Albemarle  and Earl of  Linds  y  §  The Place of Election  BUT at what time soever the Ceremony of Election is purposed the same ought to be Celebrated in Chapter for so is the Assembly of the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions call'd where or whensoever conven'd whether at the Solemnity of St  George  's Feast the ordinary or most accustom'd Time or on other Days specially set apart by the Sovereign and when the Sovereign thinks fitting in the Interval of Feasts to elect any Foreign Prince or other Person Stranger or Subject h  often transacts it in peculiar Chapters called to that purpose and then appoints both Day and Place having that Prerogative Some few Examples both of pristine and of late Time make it manifest and apparent  Place  Day and Year  Knights elected

of  Savoy    Whitehall  Feb  th  Eliz  John Casimire  Count Palatine of the  Rhine    York  Sept    Car  I  Thomas  Earl of  Strafford  BUT for the most Part since the Beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign  Whitehall  the Sovereign's almost constant Court and Abode hath been the usual Place whereunto all the Knights Companions have been specially Summon'd and peculiar Chapters assembl'd for Ele  tion in the Intervals between the Vacancy and St  George  's Feast However while King  Charles  II was in Exile and wanted the compleat Number of Knights to constitute a full Chapter he was necessitated not only to dispence with the Ceremony of Election in Chapter but also in supplying the Defect of a Scrutiny by making his own Election yet after his Restoration  Whitehall  recover'd her wonted Honour and  April  the st  Car  II at a Chapter call'd and held in the  BedChamber  there the Duke of  Richmond  the Earls of  Lindsey Manchester  and  Strafford  were elected  § IN the next Place we are to consider what Number of KnightsCompanions ought to be assembl'd to make up a compleat Chapter of Election  BY the Statutes there should be Six in Number at the least besides the Sovereign or his Deputy the due observance of which hath been so strict formerly that Elections have been deferr'd where Chapters have been deficient in that Number for Proof of which the Duke of  Gloucester Ann    Hen  VI then Deputy to the Sovereign at that Time in  France  for Celebrating the Feast of St  George  at  Windsor  forbore to proceed to Election  b  cause the Number of KnightsCompanions the  assembled was less than the Statutes requir'd  And  Ann    Hen  V no Election was Solemniz'd tho' one Stall was void by the Death of the Lord  Clifford  and probably for that reason for the Ear  of  Bedford  then the Sovereign's Deputy had but three Knights present with him  Ann  or rather  Humphry  Duke of  Bucks  being deputed to celebrate the Feast of St  George  at  Windsor  altho' there was at that Time four Stalls vacant yet did no Nomination pass one reason  because there was not pres  nt a sufficient Number to compleat the Election  So when the same King celebrated the Grand Feast personally at  Windsor Anno    Regni sui  having but three Knights attending him thereat the Election was Prorogu'd for the very same Reason in like manner and  Hen  VI the Elections were retarded for at the first of them there were present but two KnightsCompanions besides the Sovereign's Deputy and a  the Two last but four besides the Sovereign tho' the  egistrum Cartaceum Ann  names five by adding the Duke of  Somerset  At the Feast of St  Geo  ge  celebrated at  Windsor A D    Temp Edw  IV the Sovereign fully resolving to Constitute an Election and having but five KnightsCompanions present  Calys  Pursuivant at Arms was dispatch'd to  London  for Sir  John Astl  y  to repair thither and compleat the Chapter rather than violate the Laws of the Order  January  the st  Car  II being design'd for the Election of  Christopher  Duke of  Albemarle  and there being Conven'd but five Knights at the Chapter the Election was put off 'till the Third of  February  following at which Time a proportionable Number of Knights being present his Election receiv'd their Approbation  § YET in cases of Necessity only and to illustrat  the Power and Prerogative of the Sovereigns where the Exigency requires it tho' not to be made use of where there is a possibility to perform the Rules and Injunctions of the Statutes the Sovereigns for divers Reasons have been induced to dispence with this Branch of the Statute for want of a plenary Number to compleat a Chapter And the first Liberty observ'd  herein was made use of by King  Henry  VIII  Ann    Regnisui  who upon the Death of the Lord  Montjoy  very speedily assembl'd a Chapter at  Whitehall  where no more than five KnightsCompanions being present the Absence of the rest were excus'd by special Grace and Favour and the  Injunction of the Statute  as the  Annals  subjoin  concerning the Number of Nominators  were by the same Clemency dispenc'd with because of the Exigency of the Time and Place and immediately upon taking a Scrutiny  James  V King of  Scotland  was elected into the Fellowship of this illustrious Order but from that Time to the Rebellion there occurs not any thing of this Nature but the Wickedness of those Days created new Exigencies and Projections which occasion'd or rather inforc'd the Sovereign King  Charles  I most unwillingly to awaken and rouse up this dormant Prerogative which he put in Execution at a Chapter purposely assembl'd for the Election of  Thom  s  Earl of  Strafford  held at the City of  York  the th of  September    Car  I where at that Time and Place he dispenc'd with the Defect of Number of Six KnightsCompanions having then with him Four only some of the rest being engag'd in his Service against the  Scots  AFTERWARDS when several of the KnightsCompanions so much adhered to the  Long Parliament  that all Summons were ineffectual to draw them to their Attendance upon their Sovereign tho' but to celebrate the Grand Festival of their Patron much less to the compleating Chapters of Election to which they wer  obliged by the Oath taken at their Installment the Sovereign was constrain'd to extend further his Suprem  Authority and thereupon at the Feast of St  George  celebrated at  York  the th th and th of  April Ann    Regnisui  in a Chapter held on the Eve of the sai  Feast by himself and but four other Knights Companions It was Order'd  That Letters of Dispensation should be drawn up for the insufficient Number  as wanting Six Knights  to hold a Chapter of Election and for Authorizing the Knights then present to deliver in their Votes according to Custom in other Scrutinies that so the Sovereign might proceed to the Election design'd  By vertue of which Dispensation the Duk  of  York  and Prince  Rupert  were elected Fellows of this noble Society  THE like Dispensation was made at  Oxford  upon the d of  March Anno    Car  I there being but five KnightsCompanions present with the Sovereign at which Chapter  William  Prince of  Orange  and  Bernard de Foix  Duke of  Espernon  were elected  LAST of all in reference to the holding three several Chapters preparatory to the Feast of St  George  and grand Installation celebrated at  Windsor  the th th and th of  April    Car  II one of which Chapters was held for the Election of Four Knights and to deliberate with the surviving KnightsCompanions the Sovereign was pleas'd the th of  March  preceeding to pass the like Dispensation under the Signet of the Orde  and his own Sign Manual for this defect and thereby made those three Chapters as legal as if the Number of KnightsCompanions had been compleat  § WE are now arriv'd at opening the Chapter whereinto neither the Sovereign nor any of the KnightsCompanions are to be admitted without the Ornament both their Mantles and Garters as the Statutes ordain and the Law is still in force tho' the Chapter hath been assembl'd elsewhere than at  Windsor  As for instance one call'd at  Whitehall  for the Election of  John  Count Palatine of the  Rhine Anno    Eliz  the Earl of  Huntingdon  and the Lord  Grey  of  Wilton  not having their Mantles then at Court were not permitted to enter into the Chapter to give their Votes  KING  Charles  I determining to call a Chapter for electing the foresaid  Thom  s  Earl of  Strafford  at  York  where neither he nor any of the KnightsCompanions then attending his Person had the Robes of the Order with them and taking into his Royal Consideration the Statutes now mention'd did by his Authority as Sovereign of the Order  dispence with those Knights then present for coming into the Chapter without their Mantles  AFTERWARD  upon other Emergencies that ow'd their Origin to the late Rebellion the Sovereign did the like in some subsequent Chapters held at  Oxford  AFTER the Restoration a Dispensation passed the Signet of the Order dated the th of  January    Car  II the Great Seal being under the Hand of the Graver but not finish'd He was necessitated to mak  use of his Supreme Authority for holding a Chapter the th of  January  following in regard the KnightsCompanions then in being were not as yet provided of new Robes  PRESUMING then that a full Number of Knights in Obedience to their Summons are attending their Sovereign habited in their Mantles and Garters and entred into the ChapterHouse at  Windsor  or other Place appointed for this Assembly the Sovereign having taken his Seat at the upper End of the Table and given leave to the KnightsCompanions to  it the Occasion of their being call'd together is first declar'd either by the Sovereign himself or the Chancellor of the Order by his Command  THE next thing in Course is to exhibit to the Sovereign Information of all the vacant Stalls and if the Sovereign chance to be in Foreign Parts an Information ought to be transmitted to him by his Deputy or Lieutenant but if in  England  and present in the Chapter then to be presented him by the Chancellor or in his Absence by the Register or other Officer of the Order  AFTER this they singly debate how the Place of the defunct Knight shall be supp  y'd and sometimes where two or more Stalls are found void whether they shall be all fill'd up at that time or if not how many Knights shall be elected  pro hac vice  BUT when the Scrutiny is intended to be taken in the Choir of St  George  's Chapel at  Windsor  these or the like particulars referring to Election are commonly consider'd of on the FeastDay in the Chapter held immediately before Vespers wherein it is most usually order'd That the Scrutiny shall be taken in the Chapel that following Afternoon And so it was decreed on St  George  's Day  Anno    Edw  VI  viz That the Elections of Knights should be taken that Evensong in the Chapel  THIS being effected the Chancellor begins to collect the KnightsCompanions Votes and this is frequently term'd the taking the Scrutiny For the ampler  View of the Nature of which Action and Ceremony we shall proceed to certain Considerationspreparatory thereunto beginning with what concerns the Nomination of the Persons to be proposed to the Election  § AND first That KnightsCompanions only present in Chapter have the sole Right inherent in themselves to nominate and propose Persons to the Sovereign's Election consentaneous to the Bodies of the Statutes that even from the Institution of this Most Noble Order it hath not ever suffer'd any deviations  IT is worthy of Remark that  Anno    Eliz  the Feast of St  George  being Cel  brated at  Greenwich  the Earl of  Warwick  and Lord  Burleigh  were seized with a Fit of the Gout upon the Feast Day which retarded them from Evening Prayer whilst the Scrutiny was taken whereupon we find their Indisposition of Body and Absence noted in that Scrutiny where their Nominations should else have been set down had they been present And upon the same Occasion was what  Robert Cook  Esq  Clarenceux  King at Arms informs us  That as for those Knights Companions who happen to be absent  when the Scrutiny is taken altho' this Absence is  occasioned  by Accident of Sickness or with the Soveraign's Licence nevertheless  in regard of this their Absence at that very time their Votes may not be received  Those Knights Companions that come late to the Chapter forfeit likewise the Privilege of giving their Votes for that time which so happened to Prince  Ru  ert  and the Earl of  Strafford  at the Chapter held for the Election of  James  Duke of  Monmouth  in the Privy Chamber at  Whitehall    Mar    Altho' none of the absent KnightsCompanions can give a Proxy to vote or otherwise send their Suffrages into the Chapter or Chapel there to pass in Nomination  yet formerly  circa temp H    H  when divers of the Knights Companions were frequently employed in the Wars of  France  and consequently so fixed to their Commands that they could not personally attend the Feast of St  George  at  Windsor  it was usual for the Commander there in Chief with Consent of those Knights Companions to make a formal Certificate or Presentment  but not to pass it by way of Nomination or Vote for that the Law of the Order did not permit to the Soveraign or his Lieutenant and Knights Companions assembled at the Feast of such Persons famous for martial Valour and Virtue with an Account of their gallant Acts and Atchievements attested by other Persons of Honour as were at that time and in that Kingdom in the Sovereign's Service and seemed worthy Candidates for the Honour of the Election to the intent victorious and brave Persons might be preferr'd to so noble and sublime a Post an Example whereof we find preserved by the Industrious and Learned  Dugdale  MY Lord the Duc of  Bedford  remembreth as by the Statutes of

Hankford  and dyverse other  BUT lest it may be suppos'd by some that the KnightsCompanions present in Chapter can at their  pleasures nominate or propose to elect such Persons as they deem meet so they be qualify'd according to the Statutes this Privilege is to be understood of Knights Subjects only For in all Cases concerning Strangers the Sovereign doth but barely grant them Sufferance and may direct and confine the KnightsCompanions to the Nomination of such as he at any time intends to Honour with Election which Prerogative was particularly Asserted  Eliz  and  Car  I  IN the First of these Instances the  Blue Book  of the Order recordeth That at a Chapter held immediately before Vespers on St  George  's Day the Earl of  Huntingdon  then Lieutenant for the Sovereign made known to the KnightsCompanions  That the Sovereign did permit them or leave it to their Pleasure to chuse into the Order whatsoever Foreign Prince they should by their Votes approve of  HERE we have two Points that offer themselves to our Consideration  First  That the KnightsCompanions have not the Liberty to nominate what Foreign Prince they please but the same is derivative from the Sovereign and only by his Permission  Secondly  To weigh the Paragraph well that  Nominare  ought to be render'd or understood here by the Word  Eligere  and that the Power delegated to the KnightsCompanions from the Sovereign was only to nominate not elect For it immediately follows  That the KnightsCompanions went from the Chapter to the Second Vespers and while the Divine Offices were celebrating the Prelate receiv'd their Nominations and that very Evening the Lieutenant presented them to the Sovereign for her to consider of  which had been insignificant and useless if the KnightsCompanions had been impower'd by her Licence to have made the Choice themselves But the contrary is evident for the next Morning all the KnightsCompanions attending the Sovereign in Chapter she herself confirm'd there the Election not of any Foreign Prince but of the Earl of  Sussex  and the Lord  Buckhurst  IN the other Instance  Anno    Car  I the Sovereign in a Chapter held before Vespers on St  George  's Day signify'd it to be his Pleasure Three Stalls being then vacant that  out of Foreign Princes the Nomination of whom  saith the Annals in that very Place  belongs only to the  Sovereign  i e The Sovereign has the Prerogative to dir  ct the KnightsCompanions to name or impose upon them the Nomination of such Foreign Prince he plea  eth they the KnightsCompanions should pitch upon which must undoubtedly be understood to Nominate or enter down into the Scrutiny not elect  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  and  Henry  Prince of  Orange  For a little after it is evident when the Scrutiny was presented to the Sovereign that himself not the KnightsCompanions made Election of them  AND it is further manifest by the Scrutiny there inserted that both those Princes were named by every of the KnightsCompanions then present according to the Sovereign's signification which has been usually done at all other Times upon the like Occasions But concerning the third Person then to be Elected the Sovereign intending him to be a KnightSubject left it entirely to their Pleasure to Nominate whomsoever they thought worthy of their Votes Since this Time the Nominations in like Cases have been sufficiently acknowledg'd by the KnightsCompanions themselves to be a Prerogative belonging solely to the Sovereign For to the End they might more expeditiously and clearly shew their Compliance it was moved in a Chapter held at  Oxford March  the d  Car  I  That it might become a Custom for the Sovereign to declare beforehand whether he would  elect any Foreign Prince and whom that so the KnightsCompanions might be there to name him in the Scrutiny  § ANOTHER Consideration in our Progress towards the Act of Election is appertaining to the Number  Qualifications and Dignities of the Persons nominated which may be more conspicuously resolved from another Branch of the beforemention'd Article  viz  That every one of the KnightsCompanions present at the Election should nominate for himself nine very sufficient Persons  whom he should judge free from all Reproach and Scandal whether Subjects to the Sovereign or Foreigners Provided they are known not to Favour or Abet any Party at enmity with him that is to say three Earls or others of higher Degree three Barons  and three Knights Wherein the Things chiefly observable we rank under five Heads  For the First of these their Number Every KnightCompanion assembl'd in Chapter is injoin'd to name Nine neither more nor less So also faith King  Henry  V's Statutes Nor are King  Henry  VIIIth's any ways dissonant And in this particular the Statutes have been hitherto inviolably observed except in one Case As to Numbers and the Mysteries wrapt up in them we shall not further insist upon But why our Royal Founder selected this particular Number above all other unless he had some Eye and tacit Reflection on the Nine Worthies or a treble threefold Cord and Symbol of perfect Stability and solid Amity the Number Nine is accounted to signifie can with no great Facility or Certainty be decypher'd  As to the Second Point they ought to be of unspotted Character The Injunction in the Statutes of Institution takes Order that the Persons designed for Election should be  free from all Reproach and of untaintted Reputation  and according to those of King  Henry  V are to be  the best and most sufficient Knights and freest from Reproach  To the same purpose the Exemplar in the BlackBook  Such as are fittest  and whom they who Nominate  believe to be free from Ignominy and Dishonour  And to this Act of Nomination belongs part of the Second Article in  Henry  VIIIth's Statutes  That no KnightCompanion should name any Person whom he thinks or esteems in his Conscience to have upon him any Spot of Reproach  But on the Contrary in another Place of the same Statutes it is Provided That they be nominated and proposed  out of the Number of the most worthy and select Knights  How tender the KnightsCompanions were in pristine Times of infringing this particular is proved from a notable Passage which happen'd  Ann    Hen  VI at a Scrutiny taken the th of  February  in the Bishop of  London  's Palace where  John de Foix  Earl of  Kendal  a  Gas  oigner  by birth which makes the Example more eminent that a Stranger should have so great Regard to the Honour of the Order not being acquainted with the Quality and Merit of Knights and Honourable Persons  amongst us so well and demonstrably as to nominate such whom he was confident were irreprehensible forbore to mention any Persons at all And certainly seeing the Statutes put very considerable Qualifications upon the Deputies and Proxies made choice for the Installation of Strangers as elsewhere shown much more C  ution and Regard ought to be used both in the Nomination and Election of Knights into this radiant and illustrious Society  THE third Head the Statutes render indifferently capable of being nominated or elected either Knights Subjects or Strangers Free Princes or their Subjects And it was so even at the Election upon the first Choice where among the Twenty five E  ected Knights Twenty three of them were Subjects And this was the constant Custom not only in the remaining Part of the Founders Reign and during those of his three Successors but has continued ever since as appears from the Scrutinies taken and entred throughout the Annals of the Order  OF those who have gain'd admission into this Noble Order by Election we shall in the last Chapter give an Account in a compleat Catalogue of them and likewise insert the Names of such as have missed their Election yet are not to be buried in Oblivion out of this very respect that by their standing Candidates have the Fame of being enrolled in the Principal Register of Honour now in the Christian World It cannot be supposed we should give a List of all for that were a Task too laborious and wou'd prove too numerous but only of those of eminent Quality in foreign Parts with the Aera when the Scrutinies were taken  A  CATALOGUE  of some  STRANGERS  who have been nominated but not elected  Rambrith de Walsey  Johannes de Voynada    Hen    Franciscus Sforza  Dux

Dominus  Johannes Mounte  Dominus  Harmibolt  Dominus  Boysy    Hen    THOSE Persons were render'd incapable of Nomination who were known to Act in contrary Interest to the Sovereign as the  Exemplar  in the  BlackBook  expresseth more copiously  Such as are not his Adversaries or Abettors or willing Defenders of his Adversaries  Sometimes the KnightsCompanions being more wary and discreet in Nominating them to put either disrespect upon the Sovereign or offer Violation to the Statutes  IN the last Place concerning the Degree Rank and Dignity of the Nine Knights proposed to be Elected the Statutes of the Institution set forth That they be  First  Three  Earls  or Persons of great Dignity  Secondly  Three  Barons  And  Third  y  Three  Knights  Or as it  is in  Henry  V's Statutes  Trois Contes ou de greegnear estat trois Baner ets trois Batchelers  These Degrees are to be ranked in Three Classes and they distinguish'd by Three Divisions all including the Three Degrees aforesaid  WHEREAS all other Bodies and Exemplars of the Statutes make positive mention of Earls only yet the Statutes of  Hen  VIII in this Point are more ample by expressing the first Class  Dukes Marquesses  and  Earls  or  Persons superior  to these in Degree wherein the highest Dignity is comprehended  WE may observe the different Title  viz Baner  t  that  Henry  V's Statutes hath given us instead of  Baron  and not only in this Article but in all other where there is Occasion to treat of Barons and yet the Record intends by it no other than the Person it mentions For tho' a Banneret had its Denomination  a v  xillo  it usually signify'd a Degree of Honour next below a Baron both in a later and a modern Date yet formerly among our Records it is expressedly Synonymous to Baron as is sufficiently clear'd up by our most Learned  Selden  and in this Sense is to be taken here and not as a distinct Title of lower Degree because we observe the Bannerets rank'd in all Scrutinies before King  Henry  VIII establish'd his Statutes except one with the KnightsBatchelors not with Barons  THE Title of the third and lowest Rank in this Classis in the Statutes of their Institution are called  Milites Bachalauri  and in those of King  Henry  V  Batchelors  and elsewhere  Bachalauri Bachelauri Equites  which in common Acceptation are the same with  Milites  tho' thus render'd to evince their difference from KnightsBannerets who are of a superior Degree of Honour And here we may observe that there is no Place in a Scrutiny for any under the Degree of a KnightBatchelor And tho' Three of the Nine mentioned are set down to be Barons and Three other Earls or of higher Degree yet must these Six be such as have had conferred on them the Order of Knighthood else their Names are rejected and neither given or taken in Nomination  for the Words of the Statute expresly are  That each of the Knights assembl'd at the Election shall name nine Kni  ts  THUS King  C  arles  I  Anno    R  gni sui  designing t  invest  James  Marque  s of  Hamilton  with this Order conferr  d the Honour of Knighthood upon him immediately before his Nomination And the Annals in that Place put this commentary Remark thereupon  Because by the Statutes it is provided that none should be elected into the Order that have not been dignify'd with the Title of Knight  YET the Cer  mony of Knighting the Person designed to be elected w  s not so strictly regarded but sometimes this Branch of the Statute was either wholly passed or else confounded with the s  cond Article throughout the several Bodies of the Statutes which prohibits the Choice or Election of any Person into the Society as this doth the Proposal or Nomination And thereupon perhaps it was conceiv'd that altho' the Nomination Election and sometimes Delivery of the Ensigns of the Order was first dispatch'd and past yet it was sufficient if the Honour of Knighthood was conferr'd afterwards as in the Cases of  William  Earl of  Derby  and  Thomas  Lord  Burleig  Anno    Eliz  where the Register obs  rves That as soon as their Election was over and they Usher'd into the Chapter the Earl of  Derby  who it seems had not been Knighted before was dubbed Knight with a drawn Sword according to Custom after which they had the Garter and George put on by the Sovereign her self  IN like manner  Ulrick  Duke of  Holstein  and  Henry  Earl of  Northampton  immediately after their Election the last Day of St  George  's Feast  Ann    Jac  I and before they receiv'd the Ensigns of the Order had the Dignity of Knighthood conferr'd on them by the Sovereign and in like manner the Earl of  Sussex Ann    C  I which the  RedBook  of  he Order recites  That as soon as it was und  rstood that the Earl had not receiv'd the Order of Knighthood befor  the Sovereign immediately drawing his Sword Knighted him  which was not done till after his Election and Investiture with b  th the George and Garter  THUS did the Ceremony of Knighthood succeed the Election of  Charles  Prince of  Wales  the st of  May Ann    Car  I for after h  had been elected and invested with the Ensigns of the Order by the two Senior  Knights the Earls of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery  and of  Arundel  and  Surry  were intreated by the rest of the KnightsCompanions to present his Highness to the Sovereign in the Name of all the rest to be initiated a KnightBatchelor He was conducted by the said Earls his Supporters into the PresenceChamber in  WindsorCastle  where before the Chair of State he most Solemnly receiv'd the Order of Knighthood from his Father King  Charles  I  TO Honour which Knighthood and the Memory thereof Four of the chief Nobility then present were Knighted  viz  the Earls of  Essex St Alban  's and  Elgin  and Viscount  Grandison  being conducted from the Great Chamber to the Sovereign's State each between two BatchelorKnights  AFTERWARDS the Law in this Point began again to be more rightly understood and by that Time  James  Duke of  York  came to be elected which was the th of  April    Car  I at the Feast of St  George  celebrated at  York  the Sovereign appointed and accordingly conferr'd Knighthood upon him the Day before which he receiv'd upon his Knees being conducted into the PresenceChamber between two of the Nobility who were also Knights the Marquess of  Hertford  and Viscount  Grandison  In Honour and Commemoration whereof Four other Noblemen receiv'd the Honour of Knighthood at that time the Earl of  Carnarvan  the Lords  George D' Aubignie John Stewart  and  Bernard Stewart  each supported by two Knights  AND thus Prince  Edward  Count Palatine of the  Rhine  and  George  Duke of  Buckingham  being designed by King  Charles  II to be admitted into this Noble Order were both first Knighted at St  Germains  in  France  and afterwards had the Ensigns of th  Order sent unto them by the Hands of Sir  Edward Walker  Kt Garter who in right of his Office invested them therewith  YET in the Case of Prince  Rupert  who was elected with  James  Duke of  York Ann    Car  I His want of Knighthood became no impediment because he was a Prince in another Country  viz  Count  Palatine  of the  Rhine  and Duke of  avaria  and might therefore justly challen  e a Privilege to come within the Rule of foreign Princes  BUT the Sovereign to arrive as near to the Intention and Observance of the Statute as he could where there was a possibility to do it and the Honour would be well accepted by the Prince thought it requisite by Commission under the Great Seal of  England  to impower  Thomas  Earl of  Arundel  and  Surry  and  George  Lord  Goring  both being then in  Holland  or either of them to Knight the said Prince before putting on the Garter seeing it could not possibly be done before his Election which was intended to be sent by him by the Hands of Sir  John Burrough  Garter But Death intervening the Sovereign's Intention was frustrated altho' the Prince upon his coming afterwards into  England  receiv'd both the Garter and the George from the Sovereign himself at  Nottingham  nevertheless without Knighthood which  o excuse it may well be alledg'd that the Sovereign might not recollect this Part of the Ceremony it being a Time of so great Turmoil and Fatigue occasion'd by the then setting up of his Standard  HOWEVER upon the th of  January  when a Decree past in Chapter then assembl'd at  Oxford  That both the Duke of  York  and the Prince should enjoy all Emoluments and Privileges of the Order tho' they were not as yet Install'd which Ceremony was to be compleated assoon as  Windsor  was out of the Power of the Rebels The Prince before he receiv'd his Oath was conducted by the Earl of  Berkshire  and Duke of  Richmond  and  Lenox  unto the Sovereign and had conferr'd on him the Honour of Knighthood there being at the same Time two of the Nobility Knighted in Memorial of that Solemnity the Lord  Henry Seymour  Second Son to the Marquess of  Hertford  and the Lord  Capell  conducted each between two Knights  § WE are now come to speak of the Scrutiny it self in reference to which we shall consider by whom it ought or hath been usually taken and the Manner and Form thereof  BY the Statutes of the Institution the Collecting the KnightsCompanions Votes and entring them in the Scrutiny solely appertains to the Prelate of the Order and upon him is this Office devolved not only by the  other Bodies of the Statutes but by the Constitutions of his Post and the Obligation of his Oath whose right we find duly asserted upon this Persons taking a Scrutiny  Anno    Eliz  THE Statutes likewise provided That if the Prelate was at any Time absent then the Dean of  Windsor  or the Register or the Senior Residentiary of the College or the Secretary or Scribe of the Order should undertake the Employment and elsewhere it is mention'd expressly  In the absence of the Prelate whose particular Duty otherwise it was  And among the various Examples enroll'd in the Annals of the Order these Examples abundantly confirm it The Prelate of the Order collected the Suffrages from the KnightsCompanions  Anno    Hen  V when  John  EarlMarshal and Four othe  Knights were elected The like did  Henry Beaufort  LordCardinal Prelate of the Order upon the Election of  John  King of  Portugal Anno    Hen  VI And when the Duke of  Suffolk  was chose  Anno    Hen  VI the Prelate then also gather'd the Suffrages which he likewise did upon the Feasts of St  George  Celebrated in the th th th th th th th th and th Years of Queen  El  zabeth  's Reign Sometimes the Scrutinies have been gathered both by the Dean of  Windsor  and the Register of the Order jointly as we find by the Election of  John  Lord  Talbot Ann    Hen  VI of Sir  John Falstaff Ann    Hen  VI and the Duke of  Quinbery Ann    Hen  VI all receiv'd at the Feasts of St  Georg    celebrated at  Windsor  IT is more than a bare Conjecture tha  the Dean at those Times receiv'd the Votes from the KnightsCompanions on the Sovereign's side while the Register collected those on the Prince's for 'tis observ'd that in King  Henry  Vth's Reign in Posts of different Nature  one whereof was to signifie the Sovereign's Pleasure to the KnightsCompanions about their paying due Reverence first to GOD and afterwards to himself and the other in a Ceremonia  which directs the Manner and Order of Mulcting the KnightsCompanions in both which the Dean perform'd the Service on the right Hand the Choir the Sovereign's side and the Register on the left  SOMETIMES the Register of the Order took them alone as at the Election of  John  Earl of  Arundel Anno    Hen  VI and those of the Earl of  Morteyn  and Sir  John Grey Ann    Hen  VI Moreover it's plain that when the Office of Register was not fill'd and  Thomas Ruthall  Bishop of  Duresme  executed it during its Vacancy the Bishop himself  Ann    Hen  VIII collected the Suffrages The like did  William Day  Dean of  Windsor  in the Absence of  George Carew  Dean of the Chapel and Register of the Order at the Feasts of St  George  held at  Whitehall Anno  and  Eliz  THIS Duty was executed by the Register from the th Year of King  Henry  VIII to the Period of his and his Son's Reign as the  BlackBook  of the Order fully evinces as also on St  George  's Day  Ann    Eliz  by  John Boxhall  and at the Feast of St  George  held  Ann    Jac  I by  Giles Thompson  who in the several Times were Registers yet we must not mistake that what they officiated was on their own behalf but supply'd the Place of the Prelate  IN the Beginning of Queen  Mary  's Reign we find the Chancellor of the Order began to perform this Service being by King  Henry  VIIIth's Statutes adjoined to those other Offices before describ'd to collect the Scrutinies in absence of the Prelate and thereby made cap  ble of the Employment which afterwards is tacitly remark'd to be perform'd as if in hi  own right when the Register has only effected it in the Chancellor's absence tho' in reality it was no other than as in the Instance of the Bishop of  Duresme  and Dr  Day  aforesaid who took the Scrutiny in the Vacancy of the Office and absence of the Register  Anno    Eliz  the Register in the Absence of the Chancellor who was sick upon the Feast Day of St  G  orge  collected the Suffrages And  Ann    Eliz G  orge Carew  then Register of the Order  took the Votes of the KnightsCompanions in absence of Sir  William Petre  Chancellor of the Order  So also  Ann    Jac  I where the Cause of the Ch  ncellor's Absence is noted to be Sickness and  Ann    Jac  I to be Death  IN the first of these Instances we find the Prelate expressly set down to be there in the two following his  presence is implyed for it is said that the FourOfficers o  the Order did attend both Feasts whereof the Chancellor being wanting the Prelate must needs be one  NOW all these Passages seem to relate to the Right of the Chancellors rather than the Prelates by this Remark That every of the Scrutinies were taken in the Absence of the Chancellor which looks something like a cautionary Remark that denoted the Right of Execuing this Office to the Chancellor rather than the Prelate  WHEN a DeputyChancellor hath been admitted to Officiate in the Chancellor's absence he and not the Prelate hath taken the Scrutiny tho' present as at the Election of  Charles  Prince of  Wales  the th of  May    Car  I and at another taken the d of  May  following and the same when the Suffrages were collected for the Election of the Duke of  York  and Prince  Rupert  at  York Anno    Car  I  BUT there is one Passage more upon taking a Scrutiny  Anno    Jac  I which seems Advantageous to the Chancellor in this Point where it is said  That when the KnightsCompanions had given their Votes  as say the  Annals THE CHANCELLOR WHO ACCORDING TO HIS OFFICE was to receive them presented them to the Sovereign  Howbeit in truth there is no sufficient Foundation for the Register to insert this as done by the Chancellor  by Virtue of his Office  or any one Act or Chapter that hath suspended or made void the Right of the Prelate which is reserved by him even by the Patent for erecting the Office of Chancellor especially in those Affairs which respecting the Order ought by the Statute of the Institution to appertain to him But since the stated Time of performing this Ceremony in the Chapel the Prelate if present is presumed to be Offici  ing at the Altar in discharge of another part of his Duty upon this consideration hath the Service been then imposed upon the Chancellor and others  Lastly  WE find the Scrutiny to be o  ce taken by Garter  Ann    Car  I  at the Election of  Thomas  Ea  l of  Strafford  But this was at a Time when not only the Prelate but all the other Officers of the Order excepting Sir  John Burrough  Garter were absent and co  sequently  this Service so executed ought rather to be judged to have been done in the Prelate's than Chancellor's Right  § BUT whosoever gather'd the Suffrages the Time when they enter'd upon this Duty in the Intervals of Feasts where the Occasion requir'd a peculiar Chapter for an Election was usually after the Chapter had been open'd and the Matter of Election proposed by the Sovereign after which he proceeded with all possible Reverence and Respect  HOWBEIT upon an extraordinary Occasion in the Interval of the Grand Feasts the Sovereign hath sometimes called an Assembly of the Knights Companions to be convened at the Castle of  Windsor  who in the Choire of St  George  's Chapel not ChapterHouse after the more solemn Manner have deliver'd in their Nominations and returning thence into the ChapterHouse he there continu'd the Election Thus did King  Henry  VIII upon the th of  June  in the th Year of his Reign in reference to the Election of the Lord  Henry Fitz Roy  so stil'd in the Scrutiny and rank'd among the Barons for as yet he was not created Duke of  Somerset  and  Richmond  and  Ralph Nevil  Earl of  Westmorland  ON the th of  May Anno    Car  I being  TrinitySunday  the Sovereign caus'd a Chapter to be held that Afternoon in the ChapterHouse at  Windsor  for the Nomination and Election of  Charles  Prince of  Wales  at the Breaking up whereof the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions proceeded immediately to St  Georges  's Chapel where at EveningPrayer which was not within the Compass of the Feast for that began not 'till next Day the Scrutiny was taken  AND besides those Examples which shew the Nominations have been collected upon peculiar Occasions in the Choire at  Windsor  there are one or two Instances they have been also taken in the Chapel at  Whitehall  as on the th of  May Ann    Car  I at the Choice of  Edmund  Earl of  Dors  t Henry  Earl of  Holland  and  Thomas  Viscount  Andover  as on the th of  July  the same Year whereat the Duke of  Chevereux  was pitch'd upon  THE Suffrages have commonly been collected at the Second Vespers or in the Time of EveningPrayer on St  George  's Day or on that Day whereon the Feast of St  George  hath been celebrated by Prorogation and with this Distinction of Time the taking of divers Scrutinies are mark'd  HOWEVER there occurs one Scrutiny gather'd in the ChapterHouse at  Windsor  on the Eve of the GrandFeast at which the person immediately elected was sent for in and had the Ensigns of the Order conferr'd upon him when immediately the Sovereign made his Progression to the Chapel and after some small Interval the Elect proceeded to his Installation And this was the Case of  James  Marquess  Hamilton Ann    Car  I who lying under an Obligation to commence his Voyage next Morning towards  Germany  whither he had the Commission of General of Foot in Assistance of the King of  Sweden  occasion'd this his Sovereign's Indulgence and quick dispatch  WHEN the Scrutiny first began to be collected in the Chapel is treated of somewhat general and indefinite  Ann    Eliz  it was during the time of  EveningPrayer  And in like manner  Ann    Jac  I and  Car  I And when the Feast of St  George  was solemniz'd at  Whitehall  the th of  April    Car  I the  Annals  say  That the Sovereign recreated himself with the Melody of Evensong during which the Chancellor collected the Votes of the KnightsCompanions  BUT in some other Places the Time when this Matter was transacted is restricted to a precise Time or some particular Part of Evening Prayer as  Anno  and Eliz  whilst the Choire sung the Service  and the like  Anno    Jac  I but  Car  I  while the Anthem was sung after the second Lesson  but more frequently after the first Lesson as in the and  Car  I  while the Anthem was singing  or whilst they were hymning the Anthem of the blessed  Virgin called the Magnificat  and which is all one with that  Anno    Car  I viz  assoon as the first Lesson was read  or  at the first Lesson  which is remembred to be  the usual Part of the Service in which the nomination ought to begin  § THE manner of the Order the KnightCompanions Votes ought to be collected when the  Scrutiny is tak  n in the Choir    when the Register informs us upon the Celebration of St  Georges  's Feast at  Greenwich    H  n  VIII as entred into the Black Book  That he used his Diligence in going to and fro from one Side to the other to demand and redemand the Suffrages from the KnightsCompanions according to the Variety and Disposition of their Stalls  which same Methods  in eisdem terminis  the Chancellor observed  Anno    Eliz  and without question was generally performed at other Seasons for the annals describe it to be perform'd  de more  Eliz or  juxta Ordines Constitutionis  Anno  Eliz  THAT the Officer who collects the Scrutiny is obliged to begin at the youngest KnightCompanion and so proceed upward towards the Eldest is evident from the Order mentioned to be in Vogue  An  and  Eliz  as also  Car  I But to give a more particular Account of this Ceremony as it stood  temp Car  I and doubtles  long before tho' not Recorded  in Script    is as follows  First  THE Officer arose and went into the Middle of the Choire directly over against his own Seat he made two Reverences first towards the high Altar and next to the Sovereign then he proceeded up to the Choire near the  hault pace  against the Stall of the junior KnightCompanion and there made like Reverence this done he went up to the Stall of the said junior Knight and with a singular Reverence to him only demanded whom he pleased to nominate which having taken making to him a second Reverence he descended into the Choire and thence passed to the next senior Knight on the other Side unless by reason of the vacancy of the Stall he Sits on the same Side with the junior and having received his nomination from the second KnightCompanion he again crossed the Choire to the Third and in like mannner he ascended according to  he Seniority of the KnightsCompanions present always crossing the Choire where there was occasion  ntil he arrived at the senior Kni  htCompanion and  having thus received all their Nominations he returned into the Middle of the Choire and after accustomed Reverences took his Seat  THIS Method in collecting the Votes as to the general and in the Choire ought likewise to be observed when they are taken from the KnightsCompanions in Chapter they being ranked in due order on either Side of the Table according to the Seniority of their Elections and situations of Stalls in the Choire the Officer beginning with the junior and thence gradually ascending to the senior Knight  AND that we may rightly apprehend after what form every KnightCompanion Ranketh the Names of those Persons he proposeth and how each Classis is distinguished and divided the following Scrutiny will manifest which was taken off  May Anno    Hen  VI upon the Vacancy of one Stall hapning by the death of Sir  Henry Tanke Clux  a  German  and the first Scrutiny found Marshalled among the Annals of this most noble Order  NOMINABANT     Principes  Barones  Equites  Dux  Exoniae  Duc  Norfolciae  Dom  Lovell  Dom  S Stanl  y  Duc  Warwici  Dom  Audley  Dom  J

the intent it may appear by whom the Knights candidates are nominated and these are Ranked in three several Divisions  THE first contains The Degrees of Earls Marquesses Dukes Princes Kings and Emperors yet at a Scrutiny taken  Anno    Hen  VI in a Chapter held at  Brainford Albro Vasquez d'almadea  who immediately following is Stiled  Comes Averentiae  is by a mistake Ranked but in the second Division among the Barons and twice among the Knights Votes of the Marquess of  Suffolk  and Earl of  Shrewsbury  but this Error perhaps owes its original for want of due knowledge either of the Law in the Statutes or his Degree the latter of which is the most feasible to conjecture for being a Stranger his Title might not be so generally divulged nor is it taken notice of in the Scrutiny it self tho' in the annals immediately after it was rectified  AND to shew the probability of this Point the Earls of  Oxford Devonshire  and  Arundel  whose degrees were sufficiently known at a Scrutiny taken  Anno    Hen  VI are ranked in the second Division among the Barons and  Anno    Hen  VIII the Earl of  Darby  is three Times so placed and again  Hen  VI the Earl of  Devonshire  twice but this happened not thro oversight or neglect of the Statutes but because at these Nominations wherein they are so Ranked the first Division to which they appertained happened to be fill'd up with those other higher Dignities belonging to the same Class  viz  Kings or Dukes as when the beforementioned Earls of  Oxford Devonshire  and  Arundel  were set down in the Place of Barons the King of  Portugal  the Dukes of  Warwick  and  Norfolk  were put in the Class of Princes and so it happened in many other instances  ON the contrary  Anno  and  Eliz  IV the Lord  Rich Grey  one of the Queen's Sons by her former Husband Sir  John Grey  of  Groby  Knight in respect of his Alliance to the Royal Family is Ranked in the first Division among the Princes under the Title  Dominus Richardus filius Reg  nae  and afterwards  Anno    Edw  IV set only among the Barons as well with the former Title as this  Richardus Dominus Grey  but  Anno    Edw  IV he is thrice register'd among the Princes and as often with the Barons whence it is observable that to be Enrolled in the Rank of Princes may be afforded of courtesie to Persons of high Eminency and Blood but then as they can lay no claim to it by their Merit so such of the KnightsCompanions as Rank them lower suffer no diminution in their Honour  WHEREIN the second Division are Ranked the Barons and Viscounts for Viscounts in all Scrutinies after the first Erection of that Dignity were on the same level with the Barons until the of  Jac  I excepting only  John Dudley  Viscount  Lisle Anno    Hen  VIII who by every Knight the Duke of  Norfolk  excepted is Ranked in the first Division of Princes and in a Scrutiny then taken  Robt Cecil  Viscount  Craneborne  is the second Viscount in the List that has been Ranked with Princes whence it became the frequent Practice in succeeding Scrutinies until  Anno    Car  I And then upon a Question put in Chapter convened at  Westminster    May    Car  I whether Earls Sons and Viscounts were eligible with Barons it passed in the affirmative and that by general usage except in the two cases just mentioned and about the same time we find it reiterated near that Time for in two Scrutinies taken the th and st of that Instant  May  the Viscounts are therein reduced to the second Division and Ranked with the Barons  THE KnightsBatchelors and Bannerets held the same  Rank in King  Hen  VIII's Statutes in all Scrutinies with Barons  BUT tho' the word in King  Hen  VIIIth's late Statutes is  Baronettus  instead of  Banerettus  yet is this frequently obvious in some ancient Books and Records as well as in those ancient Writers long before the Title of Baronet was conceived or brought into use  IN the last place he who demands those Suffrages the KnightsCompanions present is by the Statutes of Institution to receive them in writing for in a Scrutiny taken  Anno    Hen  VI at the Election of  John  Lord  Talbote  and  Turnival  the Dean of  Windsor  and the Register of the Order  wrote down the Votes and Nominations of every singular Knight present at the Day of Election  AND at another Scrutiny  Anno    Hen  VI to fill up that which by an Error in the Black Book is set down Sir  Henry Fitzhugh  'tis inserted  That the Dean and Register wrote down in Order  according to their Seniority  the Votes of the KnightsCompanions  And after the Scrutinies began to be entred in the Annals it is evident the general Practice kept pace with the Injunction of the Statutes only there are two instances of an Election confirmed without taking a Scrutiny in writing one in the case of the Princes  Henry  and  Christiern  IV King of  Denmark  where the KnightsCompanions in a Chapter convened at  Whitehall  of  July    Jac  I gavein their Votes  viva voce  and immediately the Sovereign admitted them both into the Illustrious Society the other was the Case of  James  Marquis  Hami  ton  Elected the d of  Feb    Jac  I with the vocal consent of all the KnightsCompanions  IT is worthy observation that this Method and the omission of taking the Scrutiny in writing is not only contrary to the Law of the Order expressly set down for a more stable consignation of the Action and more faithful transmission of it to Po  terity but exceeding prejudicial to Persons of Honour and Distinction whose Names would otherwise survive with great veneration among the candidates of this Illustrious Order and of which Honour many deserving Persons will be hereafter deprived if the Injunctions of the Statutes be not observed in this particular respect  SECT XI The Presentation of it to the Sovereign  THE KnightsCompanions having delivered their Suffrages the Officer by whom they are Collected humbly presents to the Sovereign the Nominations for so it is recorded the Prelate of the Order acted in the th of  Hen  the Vth If these Votes were taken in Chapter the Paper usually was immediately presented to the Sovereign who made his Election before the Chapter broke up but if gathered in the Chapel tho' it was given to the Sovereign yet the choice was not made then but the Morning after and this was the manner in the d and th Years of Queen  Eliz  Another time it hath not been presented till the Vespers were finished but in the Practice of latter Days the Scrutiny hath not been given up to the Sovereign till the next Day at the opening of the Chapel before MorningPrayer as in the Years of Queen  Eliz  demonstrates and was the accustomed Practice of the th Year of King  Charles  the first of ever sacred Memory the last presentation was transcribed in a little Book and with all due Reverence offered upon the Knee before any other Affair was transacted in the Chapter  THIS has been the general Use as we are ascertain'd  Anno    Hen  VI the Dean of  Windsor  and the Register of the Order having Collected the Vote of every Knight they were immediately given into the Hands of the Sovereign's Deputy and in the same nature were they presented on the th  Hen  VI when  John  Duke of  Bedford  was Lieutenant in the th of Queen  Eliz  when the Suffrages were Collected by Sir  Franc  Walsingham  the Chancellor he gave them up to the Earl of  Sussex  then Lieutenant to the Sovereign  BUT it's evident from several Passages in the Blue Book of the Order that the Lieutenant afterward delivered them to the Sovereign as is apparent from the Records of the th th th and the th Year of Queen  Eliz  In the th Year of K  James  I some Exceptions arose upon the Chancellor's not presenting the Scrutiny to the Prince who at that time was the Sovereign's Lieutenant but to the Sovereign himself which was an Error he fell into as well as some of his Predecessor's as the d d and th of  Eliz  demonstrate  The Sovereign's Considerations upon the Qualifications of those to be elected  § As the KnightsCompanions are under an Obligation by the Statutes to nominate no Person but who can bear the Test of the aforemention'd Qualifications there's a Standard of Honour provided for the Sovereign to measure the Extraction Quality and Merit of the Person proposed to be elected least it might chance thro' the Indulgence of the Sovereign this Fountain of Honour might be mudded by the Choice of inferior and undeserving Persons for the Statutes runbecause this  Order consists of Goodness and honourable Virtue doth not admit Unworthiness and Villany  and so by Consequence secludes all Persons of mean Ex  raction and Merit  The Qualifications for  Election  are exhibited in the d Article as in the th are included those of  Nomination  The Words of the  Institution  are  That none shall be elected into the Order  and refer only to the Act of Election For if we consult the rest of the Statutes and compare them with this Passage they run according to this Tenor  That none shall be elected and chosen a Companion of this Order  These refer more principally to the Time of the Election  and not to the  Investiture  with  Garter  and  George  and  Installation  from the Expressions of  admitting  and  receiving  Knights into this  Order  as the  Examplars  of the  Statutes  of  Institution  set forth And this is farther illustrated from another Passage in the d Article of  Henry  the VIII's Statutes where the Word  Reproach  is mentioned  aith  The Guilt thereof so incapacitates a Man's Election that for the future it's a Bar and utterly disqualifies  im for that Honour  There are Two Points requisite for  Qualifications and Endowments  first to be a  Gentleman of Blood  and dly a  Knight  without  Reproach  By the Statutes of  Henry  the  Institutions  no Man ought to be elected  unless  e  be a Gentleman born  The  Examplar  in the  Black Bo  k  saith  Unless he be worthy upon the Account of Birth and Arms  And in another Passage  That he be one eminent for his Demeanour and good Report  which intimates the Conjunction of Blood and Virtue which make up the noblest Composition The Statutes of King  Henry  VIII are more extensive than those and say  He must be a Gentleman by Name Arms and Blood  and least this Character might seem intricate and perplex'd  A Gentleman of Blood  is defin'd to be  One descended of three Descents of Nobles  viz  of Name and Arms both by his Father and Mother's side  It's certain  Gentility  does not receive its Perfection in the Person it was first devolv'd on but is rather compleated by Succession For among the  Romans  tho' the Father was Freeborn and of the  Equestrian Cense  yet it was farther requisite that the Grandfather should be the same or else they could not obtain the Ring one of the  Symbols  of the  Equestrian Order  as  Pliny  informs us  Gentility  hath its beginning in the Grandfather its increase in the Father and full ripeness in the Son and consequently in the Constitution of  Gentility  the Father and Grandfather conveying a Lustre to the Son make it entire and compleat for its incongruous to suppose a ripeness in the Son unless there had been a former encrease in the Father and a longer Series from the Grandfather  The memorable Instance of the Lord  William Paget  who was divested of the  Garter  five Years after his Election upon Pretence of his not being a Gentleman of Blood by either Father or Mother proceeded not wholly from the defect in Point of Extraction as  Haward  relates but rather from the Prevalence and Practice of  John Dudley  Duke of  N  rthumberland  by whose means he was most unjustly deprived of the  Garter  repenting perhaps at the great Honours he had done this Lord by his  a  Character of him to King  Edward  VI when he procured him a new Grant of those Arms under the Great Seal of  England  when he was  Earl Marshal  which he had some time before received from the Garter Principal King of Arms  But admit the defect of  Blood  and  Arms  for three D  scents were the true Cause of the recal  ing his  Ga  te    that it might be conferred upon the Earl of  Warwick  eldest Son of the said Duke who out of courtesie is called so in which Relation both  Haward  and  Stow  have mistaken for they were bestowed upon Sir  Andrew Dudley  Brother to the Duke for tho' he was put in the Scrutiny enter'd among the  Annals  of  Edward  VI in the Sixth Year of his Reign upon S    George  's Day yet was the Earl neither then nor at any other time elected  The Ensigns of this most Noble Order as soon as Queen  Ma  y  ascended the Throne were with as much Honour restored to the Lord  Paget  and with as great and absolute an Authority as they were disgracefully taken from him And in Confirmation of this Lord's Restauration he had the  Garter  buckled on his Leg and the  Collar  and the  O  der  put about his Shoulders with the  George  depending by two of the KnightsCompanions present and the Gar  er King at Arms was order'd That he should take Care his  Atchievements  should be replaced over his  Stall  at  Windsor  which is the th on the Sovereign's side It is observable that the very Records of the Order brand his Degradation as Injustice as if it were inferab  e That when Honour is conferred upon the Account of Virtue and exquisite Endowments the Consideration of these supplies the defect and obscurity of Extraction The Sovereign whose Prerogative it was to declare and interpret the Statutes being present in Chapter thought  t to qualifie the Law and gave him this honourable Commendation  That he had highly deserved of the Nation by his Prudence and Counsel  And though there's only inserted in the  Examplar  of the  Black Book Virtue  and  good Report  for a Qualification yet the same was observed by the Sovereigns and Lieutenants in foregoing Time  with great Circumspection and that the  Magnanimity Fortitude Prudence Generosity Fam  Reputation  and other Virtues and Excellencies whet  er innate or acquired of the Person proposed to Election have by prudent Inquisition been inspected and brought to the To  chstone before they have been admitted into so  oble and illustrious a Body  Those Qualities were chiefly consider'd and esteemed  y  Henry  V for which Reason at an Election in the  th Year of his Reign he gave the Preference before  ther  tha  wer  nominated and presented unto him to  John  Earl Marshal  William  Earl of  Suffolk John  Lord  Clifford  Sir  Lewis R  bertsack  and Sir  Heer Tank Clux  Humphry  Duke of  Gloucester  Deputy to K  Hen  VI t  od in the same Steps and did weigh by the strict Rules of Fortitude and Prudence the gallant and noble Actions and Deserts of  John  Lord  Talb  t  before the Electio  and gave in an Appro  ation worthy of his own Judgment  and that Candidate's Merit And for this Reason it's expressed in the  Annals  of the Order that such noble and h  roick Qualifications should have the favour of Election preferrable to o  hers as is evident in the Matter of Choic  of Sir  Nicholas Carew  in the th of  Hen  VIII  That he was a very fit Person upon the Eminency of his Extraction and Fame and the many noble and worthy Actions he  ad perfo  med so as that all present did without any delay unanimously approve of his Election  And after this Tenure run the Commendation of  Henry  Earl of  Cumberland  a  his Election  vi  The many famous and loyal Atchievements perform  d by  im both at several other times and then m  re especially when the Tumult of Rebellion began to b  eak forth in those Borders where he had his Habitation  The d Point to treat on is That no one is qualified for Election unless he be a  Knight  or as it is expressed in one of the  Examplars  in the  Hatton Library Unless girded with the unstained Girdle of Knighthood  so singular a  egard the Law of the Order ha  h to this particular Qualification above the rest And least Chance or Inadvertency might let slip a Person not Knighted into the Scrutiny were the Words inserted  ut minimum  that he be at least a  Knight  before he be elected when the Sovereign come  to make his Choice It is evident from the d Article in the Statutes that it hath long since received this Constru  tion as ap  ears by an eminent Instan  e In the th of  Hen  VIII The Feast of St  George  b  ing c  l  brated at  Greenwich  and the Sovereign being present having elected the Lord  Roos  afterwards Earl of  Rutland  into the Society of this most n  ble Order and being advertised on the Morrow after S    G  o  ge  's Day while the Mass of  Requiem  was celebrating  Th  t he had not befo  e received t  e Dignity of Knighthood acc  rding to the Statutes  which p  sitively enj  in  That whosoever is elec  ed into this S ciet  should be in Degree at least  Knight  that is actually  Knighted  beforehand And tho' the Lord  Ro  s  wa  at the Time of his Election a Baron of this Realm which is a higher degree of Honour than a  Knight  The Sovereign after Mass reassembled the  KnightsCompanio  s  and annulled the Election and commanded the  Garter  and  Ge  rge  so lately conferred to be taken off and in the same Place dubbed him a Knight and then he was Elected again with an unanimous Consent and so decla  ed by the Sovere  gn's own Mouth and was restored to his  Ensigns  and  Ornaments  by the Dukes of  No  folk  and  Suffolk  Agreeable to this it's recorded in the  Red Book  of the Order that none of the  English Scotch  or  Welsh Nation how considerable soever otherwise in the Prerogative of Blood  r Virtue can be Elected into this most honourable Society but that he ought to be first ennob  ed and rendered capable by this fi  st d  gree of Knightly Honour  But this Law does not bind Foreign Princes for by a Decree at  W  iteHall  in  Charles  I these Words  ut minimum  are explained to relate to all Subjects of what Degree  oever within the Sovereign's Dominions but Foreign Princes ought not t  e  Knighted  as the Basis and first Degree of  Chivalry  The  Statutes of Institution  as to those beforementioned not only enjoyn them to be  Knights  but to be fr  e of all  Infamy and Reproach  In  H  y  V's Statutes it stands  Chivalier sans reproche  which Answers in the Latin  Eques i  reprehensus  and the Argument used by the Duke of  Bedford  for pr  moting the Election of Sir  John Rad  liff  was that he had contin  ed and exercised the Armies the space of twenty eight Years without  Reproach  King  Henry  VIII determined this Word  Reproach  in  o three Species first  w  en a K  ig  t  th been convicted of Heresy against the Catholick Faith  or  suffered any publick Punishment for such Offence  He  e Heresy is reckoned among those d  fects that deprive Men of Honour because it bends its Force against the Catho…lick Church which not only renders a Man in the ballance of  Honour  of no  Weight  and  Esteem  but more than all other Sin  makes him  Infam  us  And therefore when by  T  ngue Pen  or  Actions  a Man endeavours to  rample under Foot the  sacred Law  he scandalizeth Government and  educeth others  The second Point is when any Knight hath been  arraigned c  nvic  ed and attainted of Treason  howe  er Q  Eliz  beth  qualified this Poin  by a Decree made  n  the fi  st Year of her Reign  that in case any Persons so convicted were pardoned by the Sovereign and restored in Blood every such Gentleman in Name Arms and Blood and descended as aforesaid being otherwise qualified according to the ancient Statutes of the Order should  e thenceforth accounted Eligible and might be Chosen a Companion  This Decree it's presumed owes its Original upon the occasion of restoring in  Blood William  Marquiss of  Northampton  and the Lord  Robert Dudley  after Earl of  L  icester  who had been attainted of High Treason in the first of Q  Ma  y  And we find that in the next Feast of St  George  they recovered their Privileges of Honour and were preferred in  Nomination  and on the last Day of the Feast were Elected into this most illustrious Society  Though the Marquess of  Northampton  had been form  rly Elected in the  H  and was restored in Blood as I said before it's very remarkable that it was thought  it to descend to a new Nomination and Election as appears from the Decree it self as it was performed upon the third of  June Anno primo Eliz  The last Point of Reproach is  where a Knight Companion hath fled from Battle  in which the  Sovereign  or his  Lieutenant  or other  Captain  having the King's Authority were present when Banners were displayed and both Sides proceed to Fight Now for a Person to behave himself cowardly in the Fight abandon his Col  urs leave his Prince Friends and Companions in hazard of Life are undoubtedly Concerns of a very high and reproachful Nature and draw down Dishonour up  n the Order the Sovereign and Knights Companions and a sufficient indication of a pusilanimous Mind that prefers to drag an infamous Life and makes his Honour a Sacrifice to a reproachful Safety for the Resolution of a right  Martial Spirit  ought either to return decked with Victory or die upon the Bed of Honour  By the Laws of King  Edward  the Confessor the  Soldier  that runs from his  Colours  either in Land or Sea Service his  Life  and  Estate  were made liable to answer the O    ence and our Acts of Parliaments have made it  Felony  without  Benefit of Clergy  for as much as such desertion endangers the Estate of the  King Nobility  and  C  mmonwealth  But the danger is of a far more dismal hue when Officers or he that Commands in Chief or who has any Post of Trust assigned him either quit it or is found defective in his Duty as was  Thomas Earl of Lanc  ster  who quitted the Army at the Siege of  Berwick  the consequence of which proved an abortion to the whole Design and for which he was  roclaimed  Traytor Anno    E  And therefore whoever is culpable of any of these three Poin  s of  Reproach  is disqualified from being Elected into th  s most  noble Order  Before we proceed any farther it may not be improper to take notice of an Error which  Polydore Virgil  hath interwove with one and which  Erhardus Celius  in his History of  England  hath copyed from that Author but refuted by the learned Pen of Dr  Heylein viz  that the  KnightsCompanions  have certain  Laws  belonging to their Order whereby they are  obliged to help  ne anot  er and in Time of Battle never to betake themselves to shameful Flight  The  Statute Law  of the  Order  is silent upon the first Clause nor is the latter otherwise to be  aken than one of those Points of Reproach spoke of in the second  Statute of K Henry  VIII which n  lls the  Election  of the Person nominated if he be p  ccant in that Point Now that which gives some Umbrage to the  Knights  mutual Assistance and De  ence is founded upon an Article in their  Statutes  which prohibits the arming themselves one against another to create a mutual Affection and to extinguish Feuds which is the Life and Soul of Society and which the Founder to prevent Inconveniencies had a great Regard to and therefore he Ordained which has been confirmed since by other Statutes That none of the KnightsCompanions should Arm themselves against any of their  Fellows  unless either in the Cause of his Sovereign or his own just Quarrel And this Clause it was that gave the Handle to both Pa  ties that sided with the Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  some firmly adhering to  Henry  VI whom they accounted  S  vereign  of the Order and others taking Part wi  h  Edwa  d  IV as esteeming him Sovereign  de Jure  though not  de Facto  But more firmly to tye this Knot of Amity among this noble  F  aternity  least they should unhappily e  gage in Factions one against another and proceed so violently as m  g t commen  e into Actions of Blood and Slaughter  it was ordained That if a KnightCompanion should happen to be reta  ned in the Service of a Foreign Prince to take up Arms in his Quarrel and after his Adversary desired to entertain another  KnightCompanion  on his Side also he that was last invited was bound to wave th  s Offer and in no wi  e to give his Consent And upon th  s the  KnightCompanions  were obliged to make special Precautions in that their Engagements that if any of his Fellows were retained on the other Side and that if he knew not that another of his  Fellows  had been engaged with the Adversary so soon as it came to his Knowlege he was obliged to relinquish the Service he before had undertaken  T  these three Points of  Reproach  we have set down we find in a Manuscript that belonged to  Heny G  ey  third Muqui  s of  Suffolk  a four  h added to these other three  Points  of  Reproach  in these Words  That if any Knight of the Order from henceforth by Prodigality or Riot wilfully or negligently Dispend Sell Al  ens or do away his Patrimony or Livelihood by reason whereof he shall not be able Honourably to maintain himself and his Estate in such H  nourable Manner as may Conserve the Honour of the said Order and of hims  lf in this Case he shall be Summoned by the Usher of Arms of the Order called the black Rod by Commandment of the  Soveraign  his  Lieutenant  or  Deputy  to appear before his Majesty or his Commissioners and the Knights of the Order at the next  Chapter  ensuing there to be examin  d before the Soveraign or his said Commi  sioners and the Knights and Companions of the said Order and if he be found in s  ch great default of  Prodigality insolent Riot or wilf  l Negligence  that then the Sov  raign with the advice of the Company of  the said Order may deprive and degrade him of the said Order at the said Chapter if it be their Pleasure  Though this fourth Point is not inserted into King  Henry  VIII's Statutes yet the Substance thereof seems to be approved of before for we find among some  Orders  prepared by the Marquiss of  Exeter  and other KnightsCompanions at a Chapter at  Windsor  the twenty fif  h and twenty sixth Days of  May Anno    Henry  VIII one of them was something to this Purpose  § Amongst the Number of these Candidates the Sovereign is chiefly to regard those who have  most Voices  or whom he conceives most requisite to contribute to the  Honour of the Garter  and most Beneficial to himself and of most Advantage to his Crown and Kingdom We find the Law hath not always reserved the greatest Number of Voices as will appear from the Annals yet it has sometimes confirmed the Election as in the Case of the Duke of  Queenberry An    Henry  VI where after a due and sufficient Examination taken of the  Scrutiny  the Duke by the consent of most Voices was E  ected into the Stall of  Thomas  Duke of  Exeter  and so was the Election of Sir  Nicholas Carew  the twenty fourth of  April  in the  Henry  VIII  It is remarkable in a singular Instance that when two Knights had on either Side equal  Voices  which was the Case of Sir  John Fastolf  and Sir  John Radcliff  the first being esteemed more Worthy by the Sovereign's Lieutenant obtained the Election  The second Inducement relates to such as in all Appearance may bring most Renown to the  Order  and advance it to a higher pitch of Greatness and these have in a great Measure been effected by enrolling Foreign Princes into this  illustrious Society  whose Valour and great Merit have proclaimed them deserving both of  N  mination and Election  And upon this Consideration K  Clarles  I of blessed Memory  upon Consideration had of the glo  ious Atchievements and high Renown of  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  judged it a Pa  t of his Respect not only to render him all Offices of Kindness and  Friendship as to a Prince nearly allied and his most special Friend but also to impart to him as far as in him lay the greatest and highest Honour that might be and especially such wherewith the military Virtue of so great a Captain was wont to be adorned  But the principal Motive thought requisite to Elect Foreign Princes into this Society of Honour hath been expressed in the  Commissions  of  Legations to be in Respect of their glorious Merits ennobled by the lustre and grace of their Heroick Virtues their eminent Nobleness Grandeur Prowess and Magnificence the renown of which Fame  ad divulged and spread Abroad throughout the World  Where the Advantage of the Sovereign's Service was thrown into the Ballance no Consideration could outvie its Pretensions as in  H  justifies whose eminent Service for his King and Country was the sole Motive that crowned his Election And the great Zeal and Affection which  John Jaspar Ferdinand de Marchin  shewed for the Cause and Service and the recovery of the just Rights of King  Charles  II was the strongest Inducement that swayed that Sovereign to chuse him in the tenth Year of his Reign a KnightCompanion of this most noble Order But the last inducement is of the greatest Latitude for the  Sovereign  has a Power to reject whosoever he pleases though they do exceed in multiplicity of  Voices  and in other  Qualifications  and even to Elect a Person that's but once mentioned as was shewn in the Person of  Casimire  the fourth King of  Poland An    Henr  VI who having only the single Vote of the Lord  Scales  yet upon respect to the  Sovereign  how advantageous he might be for his and his Kingdom's Interest obtained the Election  And of later Date as the Preambles for the carrying the Ensigns to Foreign Princes set forth the Advantages the Sovereign has conceived to possess himself of in the improving confirming and establishing of a most strict and  inviolable Bond of  Friendship and fair Correspondence between him and Foreign Princes their Realms and Subjects hath been a grand Inducement to Elect such Princes into this most noble Order  § Upon the vacancy of any of the  KnightsCompanions  Stalls the  Election  of others to supply those is a  Prerogative of the  Sovereign  and in some Cases to his Lieutenant for it's recorded in the  Black Book of the Order  in  Henry  VIII's Statutes That  if any Stalls fall Vacant it should belong to the Sovereign to Elect new Knights wheresoever he was Resident  upon Condition the Chapter consisted of six compleat  KnightsCompanions  but if he chanced to be out of his Realms and the Number was deficient and that his Lieutenant held the  Feast of St George  at  Windsor  in such a Case the  Election  belongs to the  Lieutenant  who is first to be certified of his  Sovereign  's Pleasure and what Esteem  he  has for the Candidates to the intent such Information may guide or direct his Election  This Power of  Election  is fully acknowledged by the  KnightsCompanions  themselves to be in the Sovereign as the fragment of a Letter demonstrates sent from  the Chapter  convened at  Windsor  upon the  Feast of St George  to  Henry  V then in  France  viz  That the Sovereign in what Place soever residing may as is most fitting Elect into a vacant Stall there being a sufficient Number of Knights called to this Election such as he shall judge serviceable to his Crown or do exceed others in deserts and nobleness of descent  And at publishing the  Election  of  Duke Emanuel  of  Savoy  in the Reign of  Philip  and  Mary  who were  joint Sovereigns  of the  Order  it's styled The Election of the  King and the Queen  This grand Prerogative of the  Sovereign  being not duly weighed by  Polydore Virgil  occasioned his tripping in this Affa  and drew in  Claudius Coteraeus  into the same palpable mistake for writing of this  Order  and the Succession of new Knights reports in his History of  England  That  one Knight is received in the room of another deceased by the Choice and Election of all the rest  and  Erhard Celly  in his  AngloWirtemb  does as falsely affirm  That no Person may be received into this Order not so much as by the Sovereign unless with the common Consent and Suffrage of all the KnightsCompanions  But these Passages are altogether erroneous the  KnightsCompanions  only  nominate  the  Persons  but the right of  Election  remains solely in the  Sovereign  of the Order for whosoever is honoured with his Choice is immediately admi  ted and pronouncing barely the Name of the Person in Chapter constitutes the Election After the Scrutiny  hath been taken and presented to the Sovereign he peruseth it himself or the  Chancellor  or some other Officer of the  Order  that gathered it reads it over to him afterwards the Sovereign resolves forthwith upon some one or more of the Knights contained in the Scrutiny and then publickly declareth the  Name  of him or them he does  Elect  and by the bare Act of his  Pronunciation  they Commence Elected Knights except now and then the Sovereign is pleased to give his Reasons why the Knight is Elected by him  But though this Act of  Election  be solely in the  Sovereign  yet the Consent of the  KnightsCompanions  is frequently recorded in the  Annals  and sometimes mentioned in the  Commissions  of  Legations  to  Foreign Princes  not that the single Act of  Election  is in truth the Act of the whole Chapter or is made invalid witho  t the joynt Consent of the  KnightsCompanions  present at the Election but their Consent so expressed is to be taken as an honorary Respect given them by the Register intimating rather an Applause or Commendation of their  Sovereign's Choice  as being in their Opinions Just and Right according to the Merit of the Elected than a material Circumstance tending to the Ratification of the Election made by the Sovereign as if defective without it  § Among other Duties incumbent on the  Register  and expressed in the Statutes of the  Order  this is one That the Register  's Office is to set down and record for a Memorial the Elections or Scrutinies and Names of the Knights Elected  But in succeeding Times a Scruple arose if this was not needless when the  Scrutiny  should be taken yet no  Election  made to clear up which doubt in a Chapter held in  Elizabeth  on St  George  's  Day  it's recorded as the Sovereign's Will and Pleasure that thenceforward it should be Enacted and received as the Sanction of a  Law  within this Order  That if any Nominations were taken from the KnightsCompanions the same should be entered into the Annals though there were no Election made of any Person into the Order at that Time  Which we presume was so Decreed out of great deference to those Princes and noble Personages who in descending Times should by the glory of their Exploits appear but worthy of a  bare Nomination  into so resplendent  and illustrious an Order And in pursuance of this  Decree  there is frequent mention made of the delivery of the  Scrutiny  into the Hands of the Register in order to be Recorded  The Blue Book says  Anno    Elizabeth That the Chancellor himself  delivered the  KnightsCompanions Votes to the Register to be committed to Writing for a perpetual Memorial and accordingly the Register as his Duty obliged him transcribed them and put them in their proper Place with all Care and Fidelity Anno  of the same Queen 'tis said  the Votes were delivered to the Register who took care to Record them according to usual Order  Yet maugre this Law the Entry of Scrutinies hath been sometimes omitted either by the  Register  's forgetfulness of the Decr  e or some accidental Miscarriages In some Places of the Annals in the room of  Scrutinies  we find Excuses entered as it's said  Anno    Elizabeth  that the  Prelate  immediately after  Vespers  presented the Scrutiny to the Sovereign but because there was no Election made of any new  Knights  in regard of hurry or weighty and pressing Affairs it was laid aside and  through Neglect lost  or at least came not into the  Register  's Hands to be inserted in its proper Place And when the Dean of  Windsor  collected the Scrutiny at  Vespers Anno    Elizabeth  it's said  No Election was made nor any thing else done  The like Excuse is made  Anno    Charles  I but the Fault is thrown upon the Chancellor for though the Scrutiny had been taken by him during the  Vesper  of the FeastDay yet would he not suffer it to be entered  In some Places we find  Anno    Elizabeth  the  Votes  being presented  they were left with her  And  Anno    Charles  I the Scru  ny of  A  gernoon  Earl of  Northumberland  never came to the Register's Hands  But the Law yet remains in force that all  Nominations  and  Votes  of the  KnightsCompanions  ought to be enter'd among the  Annals  whether Election be made or not unless it shall please the  Sovereign  upon some Emergency to forbid it As appears but by one Example of such a Prohibition  viz Anno    Eliz  where by the Queen's special Command the  Scrutiny then taken was not recorded among the Acts of this most Noble Order  But then it is d  clared That  the Register took care to set down all the Passages as they happ  ned the Nam  s only excepted  And  why the  Scrutiny  is not inserted in the  Registry An  of  Eliz  gives this Account That upon assembling the  KnightsCompanions  it seemed good to the Sovereign for several urgent Reasons best known to her self to give Commandment That for that time  they would wholly forbear all Scrutiny of Votes and Nominations of Persons  except which there was nothing wanting to heighten the Solemnity of that Assembly But this in the  Annals  is said to be  praeter morem  contrary to the usual Custom  §  Anno  of  Eliz  there is a remarkable Occurrence not to be passed over for the Earls of  Rutland  and  Derby  the morrow after St  George  's Day were desirous to have seen the  Scrutiny  which was committed into the Custody of the Dean of  Windsor  to be registred in pursuance of the beforementioned Decree  Anno    Eliz  but he returned a modest denial and said  It ought not to be seen before it was register'd  The Earls not satisfied with this Answer requested the Opinions of the  KnightsCompanions  present at the Feast on this Affair who upon mature Deliberation adjudged the Point against them and since it has been a standing Rule that no KnightCompanion ought to see whom the other hath named  § It hath chanced that tho' the  Nominations  for  Election  have been received presented and perused yet the Sovereign hath thought expedient to defer it upon several Considerations and principally where an intent was to keep an open Stall but we must understand this of such  Scrutinies  as are taken of Course at the  Vespers  on the Feastday  And the most memorable Example of this Kind is that of the Emperor  Sigismond  who expired in the th Year of K  Henry  VI whose Stall was reserved Twenty One Years and then determined that Prince  Edward  the Sovereign's only Son should fill it up being at that time about Six Years of Age This is the first Emperor whose Election we find register'd in the  Annals  being abcu  the th of  May  in the th Year of  Henry  V styled  Sigismundus Imperator Almanicus  And keeping a vacant Stall was sometimes given as a Reason by the Sovereign for his deferring an Election as is plain from  An    Car  I when the Scrutiny taken  the Day before was read over in the ChapterHouse the Sovereign declared  That he would receive no Man into the Order before his Son  Charles Whereupon all the KnightsCompanions gave their Opinions  That this Resolution was rather the effect of Justice than Fatherly Indulgence since they all acknowledged him to be more a Prince by Merit and towardliness of his Youth than by the Fortune of his Birth  At which the Sovereign expressed his Satisfaction no otherwise than by Silence  And in like manner  Anno    Charles  I when the Chancellor of the Order gave up the Scrutiny to the Sovereign he declared  That he had a purpose to have Chosen Prince  Rupert  his Nephew a Knight of the Order but being then a Prisoner with the Emperor he would not Elect any at that Time  whereupon a vacancy of a  Stall  was reserved It has sometimes been the Sovereign's Pleasure to defer Elections without expressing the Cause as in the of  Elizabeth  though she perused the Scrutiny in Chapter yet the  Blue Book  informs us That the  said Sovereign made no Election though two Stalls were vacant  Thus was it in the and of K  James  I where no other mention is made than this  none were admitted into the Order this Year  Sometimes we find these  Prorogations  f Elections  recorded as solely done by the Will of the  Sovereign  and at other Times by the  Sovereign  and the approbation of the  KnightsCompanions  to the first of these we find a Memorial in the of  Elizabeth  on the of  April  that the  KnightsCompanions  had a Message sent to their Chapter held before MorningPrayer  That it was the Pleasure of the Sovereign to pror  gue the Election to the following Year  And so it was in the th of  Charles  I though the Nomination was taken by the Chancellor and presented to the Sovereign in Chapter  the Sovereign did not think fit to make any Election at all  And for a Test  mony of the second we meet with this Instance in the th of  Elizabeth that with the concurrent Approbation and Assent of all the KnightsCompanions then assisting the Sovereign tho  ght fit to put off the Election to another Time  As to the seeming difference of the  Sovereign's absolute Authority  and yet the  KnightsCompanions Approbation  we have cleared up that Point in the  Act of Election  for though it is  his  unquestionable Authority and  Prerogative to Prorogue  Elections ad libitum  yet out of Respect and Honour to the  KnightsCompanions  their Approbation hath been sometimes exprest  § When any KnightCompanion hath received a Summons to appear at a Chapter of Election and doth wilfully refuse or withdraw himself he was to be mulct a Mark for his Disobedience which King  Henry  VIII's Statutes inlarged to twenty Shillings payable to the Dean and College of  Windsor  to pray for defunct Souls And at his next appearance in Chapter he was to remain kneeling in the midst of them before the Sovereign or Deputy till he was restor'd to their Favour Yet upon a just Cause signified to the  Sovereign  some time before under the Seal of his Arms he was excused if it was found just and feasible if not it was rejected and he remained Punishable  And for greater Caution this Clause was formerly inserted in the  Letters of Summons  where after the Time and Place for Election was certified and command given to observe both the Letter concludes thus  et se estre ny poues nous Signifies soubz  c and if it cannot be accomplished that is if the KnightCompanion could not meet at the time assigned to perform what the Statutes oblige he should then  signify to the Sovereign under his Seal the cause of his Impediment so that he might perceive by his Excuse  whether it was worthy of Acceptance or he in Fault or not  CAP X  The  Investiture of a KnightSubject  with the  Garter and George  IF the Knight chance to be at  Windsor  that is newly Elected or wheresoever the Chapter is held after the Sovereign hath signified his Pleasure in the Election of the Per  on the  Garter  is immediately dispatched out of the Chapter to give him the Intelligence as is app  rent  upon the Choice of the Lord  Howard  and Sir  Henry Marney Anno    Henry  VIII who was dispatched from the Chapter to conduct them to the  Sovereign's  Presence to be invested with the principal Ensigns of the Order the  Garter  and  George  And as  Garter  hath been accustomed to signify in Person the  Election  of a  Knight  in like manner an Election is  signified  by the Letters of the  Sovereign  when he is pleased for the greater Honour of the Person to weave by verbal Notice In such Cases it's the  Chancellor's  Office to draw up the  Letters  and they are to pass both under the  Sovereign's Sign Manual  and Signet of the Order Such a particular mark of Distinction and Honour was conferr'd on our Sovereign of  Blessed Memory King Charles  II Sir  John Burrough Garter  carrying the Letter  Charles Rex  Our most dear and entirely beloved Son having to our great Comfort seen and considered the ripeness of your Youth and conceived joyful and pregnant Hopes of your manly Virtue in which we are assured you will increase to your own Honour both in Prowess Wisdom Justice and all Princely Endowments and that the Emulation of Chevalry will in your tender Years provoke and encourage you to pursue the Glory of Heroick Actions befitting your Royal Birth and our Care and Education We with the Companions of our most Noble Order of the Garter assembled in Chapter holden this present Day at our Castle of  Windsor  have Elected and Chosen you one of the Companions of our Order In Signification whereof we have sent unto you by our Trusty and WellBeloved Servant Sir  John Burrough  KnightGarter and our principal King of Arms these our  Royal Letters  requiring you to make your speedy repair unto us to receive the Ensigns of our most Noble Order and to be ready for your Installation upon the st Day of this present Month  Given under the Signet of our Order at o  r Castle of  Windsor  the th of  May  in the th Year of of our Reign  To our dearly beloved Son Prince  Charles  This is the only Instance we have met with where a Letter was sent to an Elect Knight and he at the same time present at Court but when an Election is confirmed and the Person remote from the Court then the general Tenure of the Letter is both to signify his Election and Summon him to his Investure with the Garter and George as was performed by the Earl of  Derby  and Sir  Edward Strafford  to King  Henry  of  France  But where the Sovereign is pleased to mention particular Services to recommend the Election of a Knight the Preamble of the Letter is worded accordingly and as this is a Case not very frequent it will not be amiss to exemplify it in the Choice of Sir  John Falstoff  where the Letter runs thus  We considering the virtuous Fidelity you have shown and the honourable Exploits you have done in the Service of our thrice renowned Father and that in our Service also you as many others have given Proof of that Honour and those Deserts wherewith God hath endowed you always suffering as is the part of a good Subject the Pains and Toils of War for the vindicating and maintaining of our just Right Claim and Title have Chosen you one of our Companions of our Order  When the Letter barely signifies Election that is when the Sovereign does not design a present investure with the Garter and George but defers it till he takes Possession of his Stall the Day of his Installation is inserted towards the end of the Letter and upon his appearance at  Windsor  so soon as he appears in the ChapterHouse the Garter is first buckled about his left Leg then follows his Investure with the rest of the Ornaments of the Order and lastly his Installation And this was the Case of  Henry  Earl of  Northumberland Anno    Henry  VIII whose Investure of the Garter was deferr'd till his appearance at  Windsor  and then the whole Cer  mony was performed at once  § If the elect Knight be at hand where the Chapter is convened and the Garter hath been sent to make known to him the Honour and Conduct him into the  ChapterHouse  to receive the Garter and George before they break up Intimation being given of his approach the Sovereign sends out two of the KnightsCompanions to meet him who after a mutual Salute Conduct him between them to the Presence of the Sovereign Garter  going before them Thus was  Ubrick  Duke of  Holstein Anno    Jac  I introduced into the Chapter between Prince  Henry  and the Earl of  Dorset  and  Christian  Duke of  Brunswick Anno    Jac  I between  William  Earl of  Pembrook  and  Philip  Earl of  Montgomery  to receive the Garter and George The th of  November Anno    Charles  II  Christian  Prince of  Denmark  being elected at a Chapter held at  WhiteHall  and then absent the Garter King was dispatched next Day by the Sovereign to inform him and to desire his Presence the next Day that he might receive his Investure which accordingly was done being conducted between the Earls of  Lindsey  and  Manchester  into the Chapter Garter preceding them and after three Obeysances they brought him up to the Sovereign Among KnightsSubjects we find the Lord  Burley  and the Lord  Grey  were conducted to the Sovereign by the Lord  Clynton  and the Earl of  Bedford Anno    Elizabeth cum multis aliis Anno    Jac  I  Robert  Earl of  Salisbury  proceeded up to the Sovereign's Throne between the Earls of  Nottingham  and  Dorset  In the Reign of King  Charles  I the Earl of  Northampton  was conducted to receive the Garter in the  ChapterHouse  at  Windsor  between the Earls of  Pembrook  and  Montgomery  And when King  Charles  II appeared upon his Letter of Summons at the Chapter held in the withdrawing Chamber in  Windsor Castle  to receive his Investure two of the Senior Knights  viz Philip  Earl of  Pembrook  and  Montgomery  and  Thomas  Earl of  Arundel  and  Surry  were sent out to Conduct him in who brought him between them unto the Sovereign the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod going before  The Duke of  Monmouth  being elected at a Chapter held in the withdrawing Room at  WhiteHall  the th of  March Anno    Charles  II Garter was immediately sent to him in the Sovereign's BedChamber who being met at the Door by the Earls of  Lindsey  and  Manchester  both the Garter and the Black Rod passed to the lower End of the Room before the Duke and the two KnightsCompanions whence they proceeded up to the Sovereign with three Reverences At the Election of  James  Duke of  Cambridge  in the same Room at  WhiteHall December    Anno    Charles  II Garter was also sent forth into the BedChamber to acquaint him that the Earl of  Manchester  and the Duke of  Monmouth  were ap  ointed by the Sovereign and Chapter to bring him in thither that done the aforesaid KnightsCompanions ar  se and went to the Duke whom meeting at the BedCham  Door they took their compass about the rest of the KnightsCompanions then standing and brought him between them from the lower End of the Room close before the Sovereign the Garter and Black Rod pr  cee  ing  § The Knight elect being thus introduced to the Sovereign bows with all Reverence and formerly a short gratulatory Speech was the vogue that set forth his acknowledgment of his Sovereign's Royal Favour and the grateful Respect he bore to the KnightsCompanions for his Election  Anno    Hen  VIII we find Sir  Nicholas C  ew  after he had been conducted into the ChapterHouse at  Windsor  to receive his Investiture thus to address himself  giving  infinite Thanks both to the Sovereign and whole Society for that they had vouchsafed to receive him into the Honour of this most illustrious Order being a Person in h  s own Esteem most unworthy thereof  In the next Place professed  That whereas he was preferred in this Choice before many others much more deserving than himself it was not to be attributed to his Merits or any Thing by him performed but meerly to the Sovereign's Bounty and the Favour of the KnightsCompanions towards him  The conferring of so singular an Honour being thus thankfully own'd the Ceremony of Investiture  egins the  Garter  first takes place as the most ancient and chiefest  Ensign  and then the  George  but the compleat Investiture is not performed until the Elect Knights are installed at  Windsor  Formerly the manner of robing of them was performed on this wise first the Elect Knight set his Foot upon a Stool and then one of the KnightsCompanions by the Sovereign's appointment as his Substitute backled the enobled  Garter  about his lef  Leg as may be seen in the  Antiquities of  Wa  wickshire in an old Draught of the Combats of Sir  Jo  n Astler  who was  nrolled in this il  ustrious B  dy and is  o represented But o  late  Date the Elect Knight k  eeled on his right Knee whilst this Ceremony was performed in which space the Words of  A  moniti  n  and  Signification  at this part of the In  estiture  were read The  Admonition  upon the buckling of the Garter in the  English  Statutes of K  Hen  VIII is set down on this manner  SIR  The loving Brethren of the Order of the Garter have received you their Brother and Fellow and in Token of this they give and present you this present Garter which God grant that you receive and wear from henceforth to his Praise and Glory and to the Exaltation and Honour of the said Noble Order and your self  Afterwards it was decreed at a Chapter held at  Windsor  the th of  August Anno    P  il  and  Mary  to this effect  That not only the same Advertisements which were wont to be given to Strangers at their Investitures should be likewise given to KnightsSubjects that for the future should be elected and install'd  and with a farther Proviso  That among the KnightsCompanions there should not be any difference either in Ceremony or Habit  Hereupon the aforesaid Tenure ceased to be used upon the fixing of the Garter and one Form remained at the Investiture of Strangers and KnightsSubjects which is pronounced by the Chancellor if the Sovereign or his Lieutenant be present otherwise by the Register  To the Laud and Honour of Almighty God his immaculate Mother and St  George  the holy Martyr tye or gird your Leg with this noble Garter wearing it to the increase of your Honour and in Token and Remembrance of this most noble Order remembring that thereby you being admonished and encouraged in all just Battels and Wars which only you shall take in Hand both strongly to fight valiantly to stand and honourably to have Victory  But against the Investiture of K  Charles  II the Words of the Signification being better weighed and considered were thus methodized  To the Honour of God Omnipotent and in Memorial of the blessed Martyr St  George  tye about thy Leg  for thy Renown this noble Garter wear it as the Symbol of the most illustrious Order never to be forgotten or laid aside that thereby thou may'st be admonished to be couragious and having undertaken a just War into which only thou shalt be engaged thou may'st stand Firm valiantly Fight and successfully Conquer  The Princely Garter being thus buckled on and the Words of the Signification pronounced the Elect Knight is brought before the Sovereign who puts about his Neck the  George  pendant at a Skycolour'd Ribband at which part of the Ceremony the Admonition used at the adorning of an installed Knight with the Collar of the Order only changing the Word Collar for Ribband is prono  ced but were alter'd upon the Occasion assign'd before  Wear this Ribband about thy Neck adorn'd with the Image of the blessed Martyr and Soldier of Christ St  George  by whose Imitation provok'd thou may'st so overpass both prosperous and adverse Adventures that having stoutly vanquished thy Enemies both of Body and Soul thou may'st not only receive the Praise of this transient Combat but be crown'd with the Palm of e  ernal Victory  Greater Respect is conferr'd upon foreign Princes who receive their Election here than abroad because the Sovereign most usually performs the Investiture himself a  was solemniz'd upon  Philip  King of  Castile  when the Sovereign took the Garter from the King at Arms and sixed it on his Leg and Prince  Henry  fasten'd the Buckle  Queen  Elizabeth  her self buckled the Garter about the Leg of  John C  simier  Count Palatine of the  Rhine  and hung about his Neck a Gold Chain with the  George  at i  And the like Honour did King  James  I confer upon the Duke of  Holstein  in the d Year of his Reign  Sometimes it ha  pens tho' very rarely for the Sovereign out of his s  ecial Grace and Favour to condesc  nd to Hon  ur a KnightSubject this way tho' when Queen  Eliz  beth  was pleased to adorn the Lord  Bu  leigh  with the Garter the  Annals  record it to be done as it were  by the by  The same Favours she b  stow'd tho' at different  times upon  Henry  Earl of  Sussex  and the Earl of  Shrewsbury  King  James  I invested  Henry  Earl of  Northampton  with the principal Ensigns of the Order as a Person worthy of so great an Honour And the  Blessed Martyr  placed both the  Garter  and the  George  with his own Hands upon King  Charles  II  Sometimes the Sovereign hath but performed part of the Investiture and laid his Commands on the senior Knight to do the rest Thus  Anno    Henry  VIII the Sovereign reached out the Garter to the Marquis of  Dorset  a  d commanded him to buckle it about the Leg of the Earl of  Devonshire  which whilst he was about the Duke of  Norfo  k  gave him his Assistance and the Sovereign put on the Gold Chain At the Investiture of  Christian  Duke of  Brunswick Anno    Jac  I the Sovereign put about his Neck the Blue Ribband whereat hung the Effigies of St  George  and the Earls who introduc'd him to the Sovereign's Presence buckled on the Garter Thus did the Sovereign to  William  Earl of  Northampton Anno    Car  I and the Earl of  Pembroke  fasten'd the Garter about his left Leg  This Order of Investiture began to be inverted  Anno    Jac  I the  George  and the Ribband being first put on and the Garter last And so was it performed when the Prince of  Denmark  Dukes of  Monmouth Cambridge  and  Albemarle  received their Investiture in the Reign of King  Charles  II The Garter as it was the first so is the principal and most worthy Ensign of the Order and in the Practice of all former Times had always the Preference given to it The Investiture with these two Ensigns hath generally been performed by the two senior Knights at the Command of the Sovereign but always in his Presence the Chapter sitting but if absent then by his Lieutenant For in  Eliz  the Lord  Buckhurst  being elected at  Whitehall  and coming to Court wholly ignorant of the Affair and after the Sovereign was risen yet leaving the Chapter sitting her Lieutenant invested him both with the  Garter  and  George  After the Solemnity is compleated the elect Knight renders most humble Thanks to the Sovereign and with due Respects salutes the KnightsCompanions who resalute the elect Knight and joyfully receive him into their Society If two or more elect Knights receive this Investiture at one time  as soon as the Senior is invested and his humble Thanks presented he moves downwards towards the ChapterHouse Door and there stands till the next Junior Knight is invested and if there be more so on until the Chapter break up  § Where a KnightSubject at the time of his Election is far distant from Court or beyond Sea and the Sovereign determines to send him the Two principal Ensigns of the Order the Charge of this Employ does of right belong to the  Garter  For the Proof of which there are divers Precedents  The Letters heretofore sent from the Sovereign along with the Ensigns of the Order to the elect Knights have for the most part been drawn after the Form of those that certify the Election and differs only in the last Clause which requires the elect Knight to repair to the Sovereign The difference lay not in the Body but in the Direction of the Letter which was always worded according to the Quality of the Person to whom it was sent As to a KnightBa  chelor the Direction was  To our trus  y and wellbeloved  and to an Earl  Right trusty and rig  t wellbeloved Cousin  to a Duke  Right trusty and right entirely beloved Cousin  c  The Forms of those Letters sent upon like Occasions to KnightsSubjects when King  Charles  II was beyond Sea were penn'd after another Model and contained other additional particular Clauses as Power to wear the  Star  of Silver about St  George  's Cross The Great Collar of the Order and To style themselves  Knights and Companions of the Order of the Garter  in as ample a Manner as if they had been installed at  Windsor  with an Assurance of receiving the whole Habit there when the Sovereign was restored to the Possession thereof  And it appears from some of these Letters that by reason Sir  Edward Walker  Garter was otherwise employ'd in the Service of the Sovereign when they were transmit  ed the Sovereign pitch'd upon other Persons to ca  ry both the Letters and Ensigns of the Order and yet continued the Garter in the Rights of his Office However Sir  Edward  esteeming this devolving his Employment on others as an Invasion on the Rights of his Office and having a just regard for the Interest of his Successors  no less than his own humbly petitioned King  Charles  II for Redress and obtained his gracious Reference thereupon to several  Knights  of the Order to examine the Matter and to give in their Report what they found and what they thought proper to be effected therein and upon whose Report the Sovereign did him full Right by his gracious  Declaration  For the Dukes of  Buckingham  and  Hamilton  and the Marquis of  Newcastle  to whom this Affair was referr'd gave in their Report to the  King  at  Breda May    We  George  Duke of  Buckingham William  Duke of  Hamilton  and  William  Marquis of  Newcastle  Knights of the most noble Order of the Garter having read and consider'd the within written Petition do find the Allegations therein mentioned to agree with the Statutes and ancient Practices of the said Order and that Garter King of Arms and his Deputies ought to bear all LettersPatents appertaining to the Brethren of the said Order and all Elections to the Knights elect And we do therefore make this Report to your Majesty to the end you may be pleased to mantain the Petitioner in his just Rights and that no Example lately made may be brought in Precedent against him or his Successors in the said Office  G Buckingham  Hamilton  W  Newcastle  It was formerly the Practice to send the Book of Statutes under the common Seal of the Order together with the Letters signifying an Election and the Ensigns of the Order no less to a Knight Subject than to a Stranger that he might peruse and advise thereupon whether he would accept of the Election or not for so it appears  Anno    Hen  VI by the Letters sent to Sir  John Falstoff  Within a few Days after Prince  Rupert  was elected into this Order being then in  Holland  a Commission of Legation was prepared to be sent thither with the  Garter  and  George  by Sir  John Burrough  Kt to perform the Investiture with them but Sir  John  dying prevented the Ceremony Some time after the Prince had been in  England  the then Sovereign thought  it to lay his Commands on Sir  James Palmer  Chancellor of the Order to attend  his Highness to declare the Reason why the said Commission was not sent and executed as was designed as well as to deliver him the Commission it self to the intent being prevented of receiving his Installation at  Windsor  because that Castle continued in the Possession of the Rebels it might remain with him as a Memorial of his Sovereign's Princely Favour and Respect to his Quality and Merits and for a farther Evidence of his being admitted into this most Noble Order since there was no other Memorial thereof but the Minutes of his Election and this Commission And accordingly on  Monday  the th of  January  the Chancellor accompanied with Dr  Christopher Wren  Register and Sir  Edward Walker  newly made Garter attended the Prince at his Lodgings in  Oxford  who having notice of their Design receiv'd them with all obliging Civi  ity and the Chancellor in an eloquent Speech made known to his Highness his Sovereign's Commands and the Intent of his coming which was no sooner finished but Sir  James Palmer  presented his Petition to the Prince who gave his Majesty many humble Thanks for this gracious Message and acknowledged his Majesty's Favours beyond his Desert but promised he would study to be more worthy by his Actions than in return of Words with many Thanks to the Chancellor and other Officers of the Order for their Trouble Whereupon they took their Leave and the Chancellor went immediately to his Majesty and gave him a Narrative of what they had done  § V It was an ancient Custom and part of the Ceremony belonging to the Investiture with the Garter to give him an Oath whether he was a Stranger or a SubjectKnight which we find styled  The Oath in such Cases accustomed to be taken  and which was to this effect  That the Knight should well and faithfully keep and observe so far as God should enable him all that was contained in the Statutes of the Order  But this of late hath been disused and not imposed unless upon foreign Princes  It is observable that  Anno    Hen  VI a particular Commission was issued to the Earls of  Warwick Salisbury  and  Suffolk  with Power to any Two or One of them to receive this Oath from Sir  John Falstoff  upon his Investiture which was besides the Oath his Proctor  was afterwards to take at the Installation which Sir  John  empowered him to do on his behalf which was  Such Oath as should be required at the time of Installation  Altho' we have fully treated of the Ceremony and Manner of investing a Knight elect with the  Garter  and  George  we shall subjoin Two or Three considerable Instances as most proper to this Place  When  Philip  Prince of  Spain Anno    Mariae  had these Ensigns of the Order sent him the Sovereign joyn'd Garter King of Arms with the Earl of  Arundel  to perform the Investiture who upon notice of his arrival on the Coast of  England  set forward on their Journey to  Southampton  where on  Friday  the th of  July  they took Water and meeting the Prince before he landed entered his Barge and gave him notice of his Election in a short Speech which being ended  Garter  having the Garter in his Hand kissed it and so presented it to the Earl who forthwith fasten'd it about the Prince's Leg and after  Garter  had presented the Earl with the  George  hanging at a Chain of Gold he put it likewise about the Prince's Neck The Ceremony of Investiture being thus performed the Prince came on s  ore at  Southampton  and on the uppermost Stair were ready attending his landing the Marquis of  Winchester  Lord High Treasurer of  England  with divers other Lords The Prince gave the Lord  Williams  his White Staff and made him Lord Chamberlain of his Houshould and Sir  Anthony Brown  Master of his Horse presented him from the Queen a Horse with a Footcloth of Crimson Velvet richly embroider'd with Gold and Pearls having the Bridle and all other Furniture suitable whereon he rode to the Cathedral and after Prayers to the Lodging prepared for him  Concerning the  Garter  's Investitu  e of the Earl of  Warwick  at  Newhaven  in  France  the first of  May Anno    Eliz  is as follows The  Garter  repairing first to the Earl's Lodgings put on his Mantle in the next Chamber to the Earl's and proceeded into the Earl's Chamber where having made Three Reverences he buckled the Garter about his left Leg and after put on the  George  and the Ribband about his Neck reading to the Earl the Words of the Signification appointed to be pronounced at the Investiture which being concluded  Ga  ter  retir'd into the Room  where he had put on his Mantle and there disrobed himself and so the Ceremony ended  It was the Custom about these Times for the Nobility Allies or Friends to the elect Knight to send hin by the  Garter  several  Garters  and  Georges  as Marks of Congratulation for the Honour he was to receive which the  Garter  delivered to him when the Investiture was finished and he had put off his Robe with the particular Services and Respects of those Friends who had bestow'd them For thus was it with the Earl of  Warwick  at  Newhaven  and the Lord  Scroop  at  Carlis  e Anno    Eliz  At the  Garter  's return to Court he is obliged to deliver an Account to the Sovereign how he hath discharged h  s Employment and by special Directions from the e  ect Knight who presents the highest Respects he can express as well to the Sovereign as to the rest of the KnightsCompanions for honouring him with a Reception into so illustrious a Body  We shall close this Section with a brief Account of the Investiture of the Duke of  Gloucester  on  Easterday  in the Morning being the th of  April  In reference to which Ceremony there was provided  A  Garter  with the Motto to be tyed about his le  Leg  A  George  in a Ribband to be put about his Neck  An embroider'd  Cross  of St  George  with a  Garter  and  Star  to be sew'd on the left Shoulder of the Duke's Cloak  A Velvet Cushion whereon the  Ensigns  and  Ornaments  of the Order were to be laid  For the Honour of the Order and his said Highness Sir  Edward Walker  Garter humbl  proposed That he might be assisted by Two or Four Knights in performing his Duty  That his Highness the Duke might receive the Ensigns of the Order in the PresenceChamber of the Princess Royal or in his own accompanied with the Queen of  Bohemia  her Royal Highness and some other Persons of Honour and Quality  That his Highness having placed himself under the State  Garter  should take the Cushion upon his Arms on which  were to be laid all the particular Ornaments just now mentioned being assisted with the Knights and a Passage left for him to m  ke his Three Obeysances he should proceed up towards the Duke and lay the Cushion with the Ornaments upon a Stool set near his Highness for that purpose  That he should signifie to his Higness in few Words the Cause of his coming and then deliver into his Hands the Sovereign's Letter  That his Highness having receiv'd it should break it open and deliver it back to the  Garter  to be read which he having done should return it to his Highness  That after this he should proceed to the Investiture of his Highness with the Ensig  s of the Order  Which being done he briefly represented unto his Highness in a Speech somewhat of the Quality and Splendor of the Order  And lastly to kiss his Highness Hand and so depart And according to those Proposals and in the same Order were all Things performed  § The Sovereign of this most Noble Order defrays the Charges of the  Garter  whens  ever and as often as he is dispatch'd to any elect KnightSubject either with Letters to signifie his Election or to invest him with the  Garter  and  George  and this is commonly proportioned according to the length or the shortness of the Journey The Allowance for the Journey which Sir  Gilbert Dithick  Garter made into the Counties of  Lincoln  and  Cumberland  first to the Earl of  Rutland  and then to the Lord  Scroop  when Queen  Elizabeth  was Sovereign appears to have been  l  Besides the Sovereign's Allowance to the  Garter  he receives honourable Gratuities and Rewards from the elect Knight himse  f after he has performed the Investiture and these have usually been proportioned according to the estimate of the Honour he receives and the particular affection he has for the Garter and the service done by him Among whom  Anno    Henry  VIII we find the Earl of  Arundel  bestow'd on  Thomas W  ioth  sley  Garter ten Pounds in Angel  ts being then at his Mannor of  D  wnley  and  Ral  h  Earl of  W  stmo  eland  elected at the same Time with the aforesaid Earl being at  Mileend  gave to him six Pounds thirteen Shillings and four Pence The Earl of  Northumberland  in the of  Henry  VIII bestow'd on the Garter for the verbal certifying him of his Election four Pounds though he went no farther than the ChapterHouse Door  Lastly  Anno    Elizabeth  the Earl of  Rutland  honourably received the Garter at  Newark  and the Lord  Scroop  gave him thirty Pounds in Gold a Velvet Cloak and a  Gallaway Nag  and to  William Dethick York Herald  who accompanied Garter to  Carlisle  ten Pounds  But since these Times the Knights elect have enlarged their gratuities to Garter for his Service upon this Occasion  CAP XI Of Preparations for the Personal Installation of a Knight  § THE Inauguration of a Knight of this most Noble Order consists in a Conjunction of many Ceremonies and contains the most solemn part of those which compleateth all the rest and till this great Solemnity be regularly and duly performed the Person elected hath not the Honour to be enrolled among the Number of Founders but barely passes for an elect Knight and no other For the Statute expresly says That in Case a Knight elect die before his Installation He shall not be named one of the Founders and the reason assigned for it is because he hath not had the full Possession of his Estate and in this Point do the other Bodies of the Statutes agree But when the Ceremonies of Installation are compleatly finished without all doubt the Knight is amply vested in Possession of all Honours and Privileges appertaining to the Founder of this most Noble Order But to spur up each elect Knight who is either a Subject to his Sovereign or resides within the Realm and consequently i  better able to provide for Installment than one remaining  in Foreign Parts for the completion of his Honour or else to wave the Act of Election he has the space of one Year allowed him by the Statutes for Installation otherwise his Election is ordained to be absolutely null and void Nor can there be any Motive sufficient to retard the Sovereign from proceeding to a new Election unless the elect Knight send or produce an Extenuation or Excuse for such his delay  t to be excepted by the Sovereign or his Deputy and the whole of that resplendent Body or that the Sovereign himself think  t to defer the Ceremony of Installation for some time longer For which reason when certain Articles tending to the Honour of the Order had been prepared by the Sovereign's Lieutenant and ten KnightsCompanions in a Chapter held the th of  April Anno    Jacobus  I ratified by the Sovereign and ordered to be observed one of them was for accelerating the Installation after the Knight had been elected yet qualified with this Exception  Unless for some special Cause the Sovereign shou'd think fit to defer the same until the Eve or Day of St  George  next following the Time of Election  § The Feast of Installation hath not been hitherto assigned to any certain Period of Time but has always depended upon the Will and Pleasure of the Sovereign to affix a convenient Day which hath been granted upon the request of the Knights elect or some other of the KnightsCompanions whose Favour and Esteem with the Sovereign was best able to prevail such a one do we find  Anno    Elizabeth  who on the behalf of the Earls of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland  obtained the th of  June  the said Year to be appointed for the Installation It sometimes happens that though the Day of Installation be prefixed yet something extraordinary intervening it hath been prorogued to a farther and more convenient Season for the Sovereign's Affairs And the most remarkable Instance is set down  Anno  and  Philip  and  Mary  when the Earl of  Sussex  the Lord  Grey  and Sir  Robert Rochester  Knights elect had their Installation together with the Feast of St  Georg    prorogued to the th of  May  in the Year aforesaid But many urgent Affairs relating both to the King and the Queen fell out about that time not only the Grand Feast but the Solemnity of their Installation  were prorogued to the th of  December  and stood so by several Prorogations to the th of  February  next ensuing yet it was ordered that the Earl of  Sussex  shou'd be immediately installed which was performed on the th of  January  and the Lord  Grey  the th of  April  following but Sir  Robert Rochester  never obtained that Honour  Though the time of Installation be arbitrary and uncertain yet hath the Place from the first Institution of the Order been appointed only to the Sovereign's Free Chapel of St  George  within whose Choice are erected the Sovereigns and KnightsCompanions Stalls and under its sacred Roof their Banners and Atchievements are affixed as Monuments of their high Merit and so great Honour For though the Celebration of the Grand Feast of St  George  happened to be removed from  Windsor  by a Decree of the  Elizabeth  yet the Feast of the Installation was excepted and ordered to be Solemniz'd in that Place For  Anno    Jac  I it was provided among the Orders  T  at after an Election made of a Knight of the Order his Installation shou'd be performed at  Windsor  according to the ancient Customs and Statutes of the Order  When the Sovereign hath been pleased to prefix a certain Day for this Solemnity of Installation there are several things to be obtained previous to it A Commission to admit and instal the elect Knight Letters to each of the Commissioners and the elect Knight to repair to  Windsor  Warrants for the Sovereign's Livery A Bill or Warrant for the removal of Stalls and Atchievements all signed by the Chancellor of the Order with the Sign Manual of the Sovereign And lastly the Knights own Preparations among which his Atchievements are to be ready to be hung up as soon as he is installed  § No elect Knight can be installed unless by the Sovereign of the Order himself or by his Commission drawn up in Writing and passed under the GreatSeal of the Order directed e  ther to his Lieutenant or KnightsCommissioners There is but one Instance to be found where the Sovereign hath been pleased to Honour a Knight by installing of him himself and that was  Philip  of  Castile  and  Leon Anno    Henry  VII yet it is feasible enough that  Sigismond  the Emperor and some other Foreign  Princes of Rank and Eminence might be installed by other Sovereigns though there's no Memorial le  upon Record  In reference to Installation by Commission it was ordained by the Statutes of Institution That in Case the Sovereign shou'd be absent out of the Kingdom at the Time of Installation of any of the Knights so as he could not personally perform those things his Office obliged him to it shou'd be Lawful for him to Constitute as his Deputy in this Affair whomsoever of the Society he shou'd think fit and he to have Power and Authority in the Sovereign's Name to Perform and Execute these Things which it wou'd have been in his own part to have done had he been Present  By Virtue of this Article the Sovereign's Deputy or Lieutenant performed the Ceremony before the Reign of King  Henry  VIII which was usually done at the Feast of St  George  but in the Commission given out for Installation formerly the Lieutenant was first mentioned and the KnightsCompanions appointed for his Assistance at the said Feast were joined with him in the Commission for Installation but of late the Commission hath passed to the Lieutenant alone King  Henry  VIII by his Statutes enlarged the Power of his Deputy a  d they run to two or more of the KnightsCompanions that shou'd Exercise the same by the Sovereign's Letters of Commission And by the Privilege of this Article whensoever after the Sovereign's did Constitute an Installation otherwise than at the Feast of St  George  they then delegated their Authority to such of the KnightsCompanions as were judged most proper to perform this Ceremony The Year after the enacting this Statute there's a Commission recorded to be issued out to the Marquiss of  Dorset  and the Earls of  Devonshire  and  Kent  to Instal the Lords  Ferrers  of  Chartley  the substance of which is in our Annals The particular Powers these Commissions have granted to them are to accept and admit the Knight into the Order to receive the Oath and to Instal him And their general Power is to effect and accomplish every Point which belongs to his due Admittance and plenary Instalment  § Besides the Commission impowering the Sover  ign's Lieutenant or KnightsCommissioners therein nominated to the Installation of an elect Knight it hath been a matter frequent with the Sovereign to Issue out  Letters of Summons under his privy Signet both to the Commissioners for Installation and elect Knights under the Signet of the Order those to the Commissioners are directed severally to each nominated in the Commission who are to give them notice of the Instalment and to require their repair to  Windsor  against the Day assigned that they may proceed to their Installation Those directed to the elect Knights  ass likewise under the Sovereign's Sign Manual and Signet of the Order and if there be two or more Knights appointed to be Installed on the same Day the like Letter is sent to each of them the d  fference being only in the Direction  Besides these Letters sent from the Sovereign the Chancellor if the Sovereign be absent in his circular Letter to the KnightsCompanions gives them an intimation of the designed Installation upon the Feast of St  G  g    And if the Feast be held either by the Sov  eign or his Lieutenant he d  spatcheth a Letter to the Prelate of the Order intimating the Sovereign's Commands for his attend  nce at the D  y appointed and if it be performed by Commissioners he issues h  s Letters to the three inferior Officers of the Order purporting the same Command the conveyance of which appertains to the Garter and are left to his Care and Trust by the Constituti  ns relating to the Order whose allowances and rewa  ds u  on these and such like Services in their due P  ace sh  ll be considered  § The third matter to be obtained by the Chancellor of the Order is the Sovereign's Warrant directed for the Master o the Great Wardrobe for the Time being to del  er so much Velvet for the Livery of the Order as will m  ke the Knight elect a Surcoat and Ho  d and as much Sa  net or Taffety as will serve to line them O  such a Warrant there is an ancient Precedent in Latin e  tered in the Bla  k Book  f the Order where it runs  Nos ideo volumus pr  ipimus ut hinc Tabellioni virgas Octodecem subrub  i ostri d  more tradas cum tanto albe seri  o quanto v  stimentum inde consiciendum infulciri poterit pro l  vera  a q  m  cant sua  c There is likewise inserted another Pre  dent in English of the like Nature for the delivery of these Materials to Sir  John Wallop  Kt elected  Anno    Henry  VIII and in the same Form run all the Warrants of Queen  Mary  and Queen  Elizabeth  Over and above these there is a Warrant and Scheme prepared for the Sovereign to Sign wherein is described the Order of the Stalls of  Windsor  as he wou'd have them stand at the ensuing Election by the Virtue of which the Garter is impowered to shift or remove the Plates and Atchievements of the present KnightsCom  anions so that room may be made for the elect Knight or Knights and to fix the new Plates and Atchieveme  ts with  n and over the Stalls in such order as they are rank'd in the Scheme As soon as the Sovereign's Pleasure is known concerning an Insta  lation Garter brings to the Chancellor of the Order the Names of the present KnightsCompanions placed in the order they then sit in their Stalls to the intent he may pre  ent them to the Sovereign who upon observing the series wherein they stand already he may easier determine how to alter and place both them and the new elect Knights  Anno    Elizabeth  the O  fice of the Garter being vacant this employ was put upon the Clarenceux and the Sovereign's Warrant for removal and placing of Plates and Atchievement  was delivered to him fi  e Days before the Installation of the Earl of  Rutland  the Lords  Cobham  and  Scroop  who thereupon fixed them according to the direction given upon what Ground this alteration and removal came to be made and continues still in Vogue though it was otherwise at the Institution of the Order wherein we must have recourse to the Statutes and the antique Practice grounded upon them A  ong the Statutes those of the Institution did ordain That if any Earl Baron or KnightBa  chellor shou'd depart this Life he that succeeded in his Place of what Condition or State soever shou'd possess the same Stall which his Predecessor held before without changing So that it might happen for an Earl or a Duke to succeed a Knight and  vice versa  it was thus at first constituted by  Edward  III  that it might be known who were the fi  st Founders of this m  st Noble Order  Now how pu  ctually this Article of the Statutes hath been observed that none Chosen along time after the Institution of the Order shou'd interrupt or change this course we shall demonstrate conceiving it very material to eye those Tables yet preserved in the ChapterH  in  Windsor  wherein are collected the Names of all those KnightsCompanions who succeeded one another in each Stall until the beginning of  Henry  VII's Reign  From which Series of Succession we shall remark how exactly the Law in this Point hath been observed even to King  Henry  VIII's Reign when it received some alteration in this Point For we find in the Annals several Knights designed for the Stall of their immediate Predec  ssors by the Honour only of Election although prevented of Installation by Death or other accidents and the Statutes do not only bind him who shall chance to attain the Honour of Installation  but him who shall succeed or come after the Defunct Knight  First therefore we shall Instance in Foreign Kings among whom we find  Ericus  King of  Denmark  to have received  Installation  in  Henry  V's Reign not according to the State and Dignity of a King but into the Stall of that KnightCompanion whom he succeeded  viz  the Duke of  Bavaria John  the first King of  Portugal  a Knight and Companion likewise in  Henry  V's Time was installed in the second Stall on the Sovereign's Side which belong'd to  Henry  Duke of  Lancaster  his first Predecessor And to this King did succeed in the same Stall his Son  Edward  King of  Portugal Anno    Henry  VI to whose Successor  Humphry Anno  and  Casimir  King of  Poland  were elected  Anno    Henry  VI into the sixth Stall on the Prince's side at that Time vacant by the Death of the Duke  Conimbero  whose first Founder was Sir  John Mohun Alphonsus  King of  Arragon  and  Naples Anno    Henry  VI was elected into the Sta  l of  Don Altro Vasques Dalmed  a C  unt d' Averence  being the seventh on the Sovereign's side Sir  Hugh Courtney  first possessing it  Ferdinand  King of  Niples  and  Sicily  elected  Anno    Edward  IV was installed on the third on the Prince's side  Ralph  Earl of  Stafford  having been first i  stalled therein And lastly we find  Alphonsus  King of  Sicily  and  Jerusalem  being elected by  Henry  VII received his Installation on the Prince's side whose Predecessor was  Thomas Beauchamp  Earl of  Warwick  In the second Place if we descend to Foreign Princes it is remarkable that  William  Duke of  Gu  ld  es  elected by  Richard  II was installed in that which Sir  John Beauchamp  poss  ssed and  William  Earl of  Holland Haynal    and  Zealand  in that which appertained to Sir  John Chandos Philip  Duke of  Burgundy  in the Time of  Henry  V into the Stall of Sir  John Clifford  And  Anno    Henry  VI  Henry  Duke of  Brunswick  was elected into the Duke of  Suffolk  's Stall  And as the Statute was carefully observed with reference to the Election and Installation of Foreign Princes so no less in relation to the Princes of the Blood at Home among whom let us observe in the third Place the ranking the Sons of the Founder of this most Noble Order where we see  Lyonel  Duke of  Clarence  his third Son to have been installed in the sixth Stall on the Sovereign's side whose immediate Predecessor was Sir  John Beauchamp  In like manner  John  of  Gaunt  Duke of  Lancaster  his fourth Son was instal  ed in the seventh Stall on the Prince's side having S  r  Thomas Holland  for his Predecessor and a Founder His fifth Son  Edmund Langley  Duke of  York  possess'd the Stall Sir  Hugh Courtney  did before And the sixth Son  Thomas Woodstock  Duke of  Gloucester  enjoy'd the Stall Sir  John Grey  did before This Rule was likewise observed strictly in relation to the Sons of King  Henry  VII  If we review the aforesaid Tables we shall find that as the KnightsCompanions of higher Dignity assumed the Stalls when they became vacant though often of the lower sort so some of the inferior rank among them have had the Honour to be installed in Seats of a  uperior Class and this by the virtue and due of the Law  Amongst these KnightsCompanions we shall enumerate Sir  Philip la Vache  a  Gascon  who in the Reign of King  Richard  II was first installed in the Prince's Stall being vacant by the Death of  John  of  Gaunt  though af  erwards removed to the third Stall on the Sovereign's side Sir  Nicholas Sarnesfield  Standardbearer to the Founder who succeeded  Hugh  Earl of  Stafford  and after him Sir  illiam Arundel  immediate Successor to Sir  Nich  las  were both installed in the second Stall on  he Sovere  gn's side As likewise Sir  John Robsart  Sir  Gilbe  t Talbot  and S  r  John Grey  c were installed in the second or third Stalls on the Sovereign's side  These Instances already asserted are sufficient to manifest the Usage and Practice how the KnightsCompanions have succeeded in the Stalls of their immediate Predecessors down to the Reign of  Henry  VIII and was consonant and agreeable to the ancient Law of the Order  But we are to observe that tho' each Knight was by the beforementioned Article constituted to succeed his immediate Predecessor in the Stall void by his Death yet there's an excep  ion as to that of the Prince of  Wales  This Stall is the first on the left Hand at the entrance into the Choir of St  George  's  Chappel  at  Windsor  and where n  Edward  the Black Prince was installed from this Stall does the whole range of Stalls on the same side take their De  omination and to which the Prince of  Wales  as soon as he is elected into the Order hath a due Title Though this Stall  de Jure  appertains to that Prince yet heretofore when the Sovereign had no Heir then was it for the present disp  sed to some other Knight otherwise a defect in the full Number of KnightsCompanions would have ensued  The first that obtained that Honour besides the Prince of  Wales  was  John  of  Gaunt  Duke of  Lancaster  decreed him by K  Richard  II who never had Issue and removed from the seventh Stall thither But the first Companion that happened to be instal  ed in it was Sir  Philip la Vache  just mentioned which was a great Honour done to one of his Rank But it fell to him by the then Law of the Order being elected into the R  om of the said Duke who di  d possessed  f it But King  Henry  IV coming to the Crown and his eldest Son being created Prince of  Wales  laid claim to the Stall by Virtue of that Statute and had it assigned to him Nevertheless that the former Possesso  might suffer as little diminution as might be in the Honour of h  s Session he was removed no lower than to the Stall which King  Henry  IV lately held when he was Earl of  Derby  Upon the D  ath of  Henry  IV  Henry  V being Sovereign S  r  John Dab  ichcou  t  suppl  ed the vacancy and was installed therein and he dying in the fifth Year of that King  ssess'd thereof his Plate continues in that Stall to th  s Da  and the Emperor  Sigismond  succeeds Sir  John Dabrichcourt  in the Prince's Stall  Some few Years before King  Henry  VI died he had a Son Born and though the Emperor  F  ederick  was el  cted into the O  der  Anno    Henry  VI yet was that S  all reser  ed for the Prince though he never  oss  ss'd i  and the Emperor  Henry  VI  was instal  ed by P  oxy in the Duke of  S  merset  's Stall then latel  decea  ed  In  Edward  IV's Reign the right of this Stall retu  ned again to  Edward  his Son the Prince of  W  les  and in  Hen  y  VII's to Prince  Arthur  but upon his De  h to  Maximilian  Son of  Frederick  King of the  R  mans  and after Emperor enjoyed it So did  he Emp  ror  Charles  V his Grandchi  d in regard there was no Son as yet B  n to the S  vereign  But Prince  Edward  being Born while the Stall was possessed by  Cha les  V it chanc'd likewise that the K  ng o  the  Scots  died which caus'd King  Henry  VIII to reserve his Stall for that Prince although he never had Possession of it or was elected into the Order tho  gh we find him once registred in a Scrutiny King  H  n  y  VIII dying Prince  Edward  became bo  h by I heritance and Succession Sovereign of this most Nob  e Order  From this Time to the eighth Year of King  James  I there was no Prince of  Wales  who fi  ing  he Prince's Stall vacant at h  s entrance up  n the English Thr  ne did in a Chapter in the first Year of his Reign ad  ance the French King  Henry  IV f  m the second Stall on t  e Sovereign's side into it and appointed Pri  ce  Henry  t  be installed in that King's vo  d Seat  whe  e he continued till  Anno    Jac  I that  Christierne  IV King of  Denmark  came to be installed by Proxy an  the Prince was m  ved lower to make way for him though he was Senior both by Election and Installation  Anno    Jac  I upon the Death of the French King not the Prince whose Right it was since he was created Prince of  Wales  but the said King  f  Denm  k  was translated to the vacant S  al  and hereupon Prince  Henry  was returned again to the second Stall on the Sovereign's side which he enjoyed as long as he survived and upon his Dea  h Prin  e  Charles  was removed into it and there remained all King  James  's Reign  When Ki  g  Charles  II came to be installed the Sovereign finding him prevented from assuming the P  ince's Stall the King of  Denmark  being yet alive assigned to  him the second Stall on the Sovereign's side wherein himself sat whilst Prince of  Wales  and where hitherto his Plate remains as a fixed Memorial of his Installation therein  Although it has been made apparent that the  KnightsCompanions  at their Election or Installation succeeded the immediate  defunct Knight  in his Stall yet we may observe that sometimes after Installation as an especial signal of Favour and Indulgence the Sovereign hath been pleased though very rarely to advance a  KnightCompanion  to a higher Stall than that wherein he was first placed and though there be no such Permission granted by the Law of the Order yet we find  John  of  Gaunt  Duke of  Lancaster  removed from the seventh Stall on the Prince's side to the Prince's Stall it self and it's said to be done by the Decree of the Sovereign and the  KnightsCompanions  And no doubt but as this was done by so good Authority and so upon no less enducements to the Sovereign and the whole Society We shall here mention a few of these extraordinary Cases  William Henalt  Earl of  Ostervant  was advanced by King  Richard  II from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's side to the Duke of  Britain  's being the second on the Prince's side  Humphry  Duke of  Gloucester  in the Reign of King  Henry  VI was removed from the eleventh Stall on the Sovereign's side to the second on the same side and  Richard Nevil  Earl of  Warwick  by the Consent of the  KnightsCompanions  in Chapter  Anno    Henry  VI was translated to the Duke of  Buckingham  's Stall the Lord  Bonvil  to the Lord  Scales  's Seat Sir  Thomas Kyriell  to the Place of the Earl of  Shrewsbury  and the Lord  Wenlock  to the Stall of Viscount  Beaumont  But King  Henry  VIII thinking it requisite for the Sovereign of this most Noble Order to be impowered by a General how to Act that at Pleasure which the former Sovereigns did not but by the Power of particular Acts or Orders in the Chapter after he had confirmed the ancient Law of succeeding in the Stall of the immediate Predecessor and not to suffer an alteration without the Sovereign's Licence in the next Article he estab  ished this Privilege upon Himself and Successors  That if there were any Place or Stall void the Sovereign at his own Pleasure might Advance and Translate any Knight  of the Society into the void Stall so that it were higher than that wherein he sate before  This in Effect did vacat the ancient Law of succeeding in Stalls though at the same Time he seem'd to Confirm it to the  KnightsSubjects  for afterwards Translations preceeding to Installations became so frequent that the Right an  elect Knight  had to his Predecessor's Stall was seldom enjoyed However hereby he confirmed a Power to gratify such of the  KnightsCompanions  as he shou'd think  it to advance without having recourse to a Chapter and from hence began the Custom to Issue out Warrants under the Sovereign's  Sign Manual  for the Translation of Stalls and consequently the alteration and removal of such of the  KnightsCompanions Helms Crests Banners  and  Plates  who shou'd receive a higher Exaltation  Besides the Power established upon the Sovereigns of this most Noble Order of translating Stalls when a vacancy happened they farther added this larger Prerogative That the Sovereign once in his Life might if  t pleased him make a general Translation of all the Stalls at his P  easure except of Emperors Kings Princes and Dukes who shou'd keep their Stalls and Places unless advanced to a higher Room and Stall In which Translation the long continuance in the Order and the Praises Worthiness and Merits of the  KnightsCompanions  were to be considered and remembred  But this Branch of the Sovereign's Prerogative as far as we can find was never put in Execution though the Translation  Anno    Henry  VIII border'd something u  on it perhaps left it might raise too great Feuds among the  KnightsSubjects  forasmuch as that of translating only when there happened a vacancy begot great Emulations which at length introduced a Change to which we shall pass after we have taken notice of a Clause added in the twenty second Article of King  Henry  VIII's Statutes relating to Princes  It is observable the ancient Law of succeeding in Stalls in relation to them was wholly altered For King  Henry  VIII upon the Establishment of his Body of Statutes not only appointed those Strangers then present of the O  der to be seated next himself but that all Empe  or  Kings and Princes should hold their Stalls after their Estates and the very next unto the Sovereign tho'  KnightsSubjects  upon vacancy become removable at Pleasure  For this reason the Emperor  Maximilian  II and after him  Rudolph  II his Son had the Prince's Stalls assigned them after their Election into the Order and several of the Kings of  France  were placed in the next below being the second on the Sovereign's side And when there chanced to be more than one King at a time in the Order the second Stall on the Prince's side was assigned him for Precedency was measured now by Dignity and State and not by the Antiquity of the Order As appears from the King of  Bohemia Anno    Henry  VIII and the King of  Spain Anno    Elizabeth  Princes Stra  gers according to their regality and illustrious extraction had their Scituation next to Kings as is manifest from the Dukes of  Savoy Montmorency  and  Holstein Anno    Elizabeth  and  Frederick  Prince  Palatine  and  Maurice  Prince of  ange Anno    Jac  I  But notwithstan  ng these Assignments of Stalls to Strangers they were nevertheless subject to removal sometimes to Stalls higher than their own upon the Death of a Stranger who died possessed of a superior one and sometimes again to others lower for the advancing a Knight of greater Degree and Distinction where the upper Stalls were already supplied else they could not be so ranked according to their respective Quality as the Statut  s enjoyn nor indeed wou'd any Stranger King have accepted of an Election unless he was placed in a distinguishable Stall suitable to his Dignity  Ferdinand  Emperor of  Germany  is an instance of Advancement in  anslation of

Charles  IX was elected  Anno    Elizabeth  the superior Stalls were already filled with Strangers and there was no Ex  edient left to give him the S  all the Sovereign design'd him but by the removal of some of those  KnightsStrangers  lower and upon this  Emanuel  Duke of  Savoy  was displaced to the third on the Sovereign's side  But the  French  King was not installed until the th of  January Anno    Elizabeth  and before that it was concluded to remove the King of  Spain  to the Duke of  Savoy  's Stall as void before and to instal the  French  King in the King of  Spain  's which was accordingly done so that upon this occasion there were four Strangers and five  KnightsSubjects  removed lower to make way for the  French  King  The th of  April Anno    Jac  I The Duke of  Wirtemberg  was installed in the third Stall on the Prince's side and the Year following advanced to a higher  The th of  May  ensuing  Ulerick  Duke  Holst  had assigned unto him that Stall from which the Duke of  Wirtembe  g  was advanced But against the Installation of  Christierne  the fourth King of  Denmark  the Duke was removed back to his Sea  wherein he was installed and the Duke advanced into the vacant one All which will appear more conspicuous from the appointment of St  lls on these Occasions which follow  A remove of  Banners  and  Plates  at the Installation of

from the third Stall on the Sovereign's side to the second on the Prince's side that became vacant by the Death of the Duke of  Brunswick  yet the Year after upon the admission of  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  he was removed two Stalls lower and the Prince Elector Palatine one  We pass on now from the removal and translation of a  KnightSubject  after he had been installed to the assignment of his Stall at the Time of the Installation it self where it is worthy of Remark That on the th of  April Anno    E  izabeth  in lieu of the ancient Law which app  inted each elect Knight to succeed in the Stall of his Predecessor a new one was introduced being composed as was conceived upon a more just level than the former  as far as was possible to extinguish all danger that might ar  se from Emulation The Words are  That all Knights who for the future were admitted into the Society of the Order should take and be installed in the lowest Stall according to the Cou  se and Seniority of their Election except only Strang  r Kings and Princes  Upon which it chanced that when a  KnightSubject  elect was to be installed all the  KnightsCompanions  bet  een him and the vacant Stall were removed higher that the space might be supplied And if two or more  ere to be installed together they possessed the lowest  ta  ls according to the Seniority of their Election And th  ugh the manner and order in removals is become a  ing of course and rendered familiar and easy yet it  annot be effected or the Atchievements Banners or  displaced unless by a Warrant issued from the  vereign to

Ormond  and that of Sir  Christop  r  Hatton  the d of  May Anno    Elizabeth  which demonstrates those three elect Knights appear to be installed in the lowermost Stalls as the last mentioned Decree enjoyns and by reason the Earl of  Essex  and Sir  Christopher Hatton  were settled on the Sovereign's si  e the vacancy in the eighth and twelfth Stalls of the same side became filled up the Earl of  Huntington  being advanced into the eighth the Lord  Grey  in the ninth and the Earl of  Pembrook  in the tenth Stall by the advance of the Earl of  Worcester  into the seventh on the Prince's side the vacancy is there supplyed and the other Knights seated below him by a like removal left the twelfth Stall for the Earl of  Ormond  and the thirteenth void  The same Order was observ'd by King  James  as appears by another Scheme of the Stalls settled on the d of  July Anno    Jac  I at t  e Election of the Duke of  Lenox  the Earls of  Northampton Marr  and  Pembrook  Stalls altered at a

were installed in the lowest Stalls and so continued throughout the series of his Reign a  d since except the Prince of  Wales  and  Charles  Duke of  York  Sons to the said Sovereign For the Prince was installed on the second on the  Sovereign's side and upon that Election of the Duke o  York Anno Jac  I the second Stall on the Prince's side was assigned him and the Morrow after St  George  's  Day  upon which he was elected he made a solemn Progressi  n to the Chapel in order to take Possession of it U  on  W  itsunday  following at a serious Debate it was determined in Chapter that notwithstanding he was the Sovereign's Son yet he shou'd have no more Preheminence than other  KnightsCompanions  and that his Atchievements which had been set up over the second Stall on the Prince's side shou'd be removed to that Stall next above the Viscount  Rochester  's and to be conserted wi  h the Earl of  Montgomery  before whom he had the Preference on  WhitsunMunday  as they proceeded to the ChapterHouse in order to their Installation And where it was farther Decreed  That all Princes not Absolute sh  u'd be installed thenceforth in the Prince's Place  But after this had passed Endeavours were used to advance the Duke into the Stall he was first appointed to and the Kings of Arms were consulted upon this Point who certified that  Richard  Duke of  York  second Son to King  Edward  IV was installed in the fourth Stall on the Prince's side and had Precedence of the Duke of  Suffolk  and the Earls of  Dowglass  and  Essex  who were elected long before him That  Henry  Duke of  York  second Son to King  Henry  VII was installed in the third Stall on the Sovereign's side and had the Preference of the Duke of  Buckingham  and the Earls of  Oxford  and  Derby  his Seniors and in the last Place that  Henry Fitz R  y  Duke of  Richmond  base Son of King  Henry  VIII had Place and Precedence before the Dukes of  Norfolk  and  Suffolk  and other  KnightsCompanions  Upon which Grounds it was thought requisite that the Issue of the Sovereign should enjoy the same Privileges in this Affair as those Princes that we  e Strangers and therefore at another Chapter assembled a  WhiteHall  on  EasterMonday  being the th of  April Anno    Jac  I the Order which passed the Year before  for making the Duke a Puisne was abrogated and he was translated to the second Stall on the Prince's side and paired with Prince  Henry  as may be seen by the Stalls then settled and entered into the Blue Book of th  Order  We need not bring any more corroborating Circumstances of the Observation of the Chapter Act made  Anno    Elizabeth  as it relates to  KnightsSubjects  which has been punctually performed but since Strangers are therein excepted it will not be amiss to note that the Rule and Practice con  inued as was established by King  Henry  VIII  viz  that they were installed in Seat  next to the So  ereign according to the illustriousness of their Dignity and Birth  We shall mention one Instance of the manner of placi  g both Strangers and KnightsSubjects at one and the  ame Time At the first coming of King  Charles  I to the Crown there were of both Conditions to be installed in one D  y to wit the Duke of  Brunswick  a Stranger Prince the Earls of  Salisbury  and  Carlis  e KnightsSubjects  elected by King  James  I in the d Year of his Reign and on the th of  May  following the Earls of  Dorset  and  Holland  were elected with th  Viscount  Andove    and the Duke of  Chevereux  the th of  July  after And when the removal of Stalls was propounded for the Admission of these seven el  ct Knights it was agreed too that the Dukes of  Brunswick  and  Chevereux  shou'd be installed in the uppermost Stall among Strangers as King  Henry  VIII had before ordained but the  KnightsSubjects  in the lowermost S  alls according to the pristine Practice as appears from the Decree  Anno    Elizabeth  and from the settlement of S  alls then made and thus intituled  A remove of  Banners  and  Stalls  at the Feast of St  George  and Installation holden at  Windsor  the Days of  December Anno  At which time were installed the Dukes of  Brunswick  and

ancient Law of Succession into void Stalls and of Translation from one to another we come now to consider what is farther to be prepared for the Knight elect against the Day of the great Solemnity at his own Expence the chief of which are  A Mantle or upper Robe with its Appurtenance  A Collar of the Garter and Great George  A Cap of black Velvet adorned with Plumes  A Helmet Crest Mantlings and Sword  A Banner of his Arms  A Plate of his Arms and St  le  A Cushion to carry his Robes and Collar upon  Lodging Escutcheons  Though the Kirt  e on the Surcoat was anciently given by the King to the  KnightsSubjects  yet we do not find the Mantle of the Order was no  indeed of a  ater Date unless now and then as a distinguishing mark of Favour But the Sovereign always bestows the M  ntle upon Strangers as well as the whole Habit when he has elected them into the Society of the Order And u  on sending of the whole Habit over by Garter to the King of  Portugal  Anno    Hen  VI the Mantle Surcoat and Hood  were accompted for in the Great Wardrobe and is to this Day practised  However of late the Sovereign hath been pleased now and then  to confer the Mantle upon a  KnightSubject  Witness King  James  I  Anno  did to  James  Marqui  s of  Hamilton  and King  Charles  I  Anno  to  Theophilus  Earl of  Suffolk  and the Year ensuing to  William  Earl of  Northampton  And  Anno  Sir  James Palmer  by his Sovereign's Direction paid for the Velvet and Taffety of the Earl of  Kelly  's Mantle and Surcoat to Sir  Peter Richaut  and put it upon the Account of the extraordinary Expence of the Order  King  Charles  II as a signal Mark of his Favour caused seventeen Mantl  s with the usual Liveries of Surcoat and Hood to be made ready against the grand Feast of St  George Anno  which he confered not only among the new elect Knights but upon the Earls of  Salisbury Barkshire  and  No  thumberland  that were three Senior  Knig  tsComp  nions  The Collar of the Order and the great George the elect Knight is to provide himself unless where the Sovereign is pleased to bestow the Mantle  hich is always accompanied with the Collar and then a like Warrant issu  s to the M  ster of the  JewelHouse  as was used for providing the seventeen Collars  Anno    Car  II  The black Velvet Cap beforementioned and described with the Helm Crest and Mantlings together with a Sword and Gird  e are to be got in readiness by the care and direction of the Garter but at the Expence of the Knights e  ect all whi  h are to be set over his Stall as soon as  i  Installation Fees are paid  This Honour that every  KnightCompanion  shall have his Helm Cr  st and Sword affixed over his Stall at the Chappel of St  George  is particularly provided for in all the seve  al Bodies of S  atutes and are ordained to remain there during the Lives of the Possessors  In  of  im that bears them and a T  stim  ny  f t  e Defence  the Chu  ch as the Oaths of Military Orders requi  e  The He  ms upon this Occasion are composed of Steel and of a more than ordinary proportion those for Sove  eign P  i  ces are framed open with large Barrs but those fo  the  KnightsSubjects  are made close About King  Henry  VIII's Reign the  Knigh  sSubjects  Helms were parcel gilt with fine Gold in Oil wrought with curious Works and burnished with fine Gold But in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  and since that Time it hath been the Custom to gild their Helms all over and place the Arms of St  George  in the Middle before the Vizors  The Mantlings that hang down on either side of the Helm together with the Wreath are in some places called Appendixes and are all of Tissue or Cloth of Gold and formerly lined with Sarcenet but in the Reign of Queen  Mary  they were exchanged for white Satin for so were the Mantlings of  Anthony B  own  Viscount  Montague  and  William Howard  Lord Admiral lined  At the bottom of these Mantlings hang a pair of gilt Knobs burnished with Gold from which spring out Tossels either of Gold or S  lver consentaneous to the Metal in the Knights Court of Armour mixed with Silk of the chief Colour in his Arms  Upon the Helm and Mantlings is placed a Wreath of corded Silk of the Knight's Colou  s which was formerly of Sarcenet but now of Taffety  The Crest of the Knight is placed either upon these W  eaths or Issuant out of a Crown or Ducal Cap turned with Ermin and of what kind s  ever the Crest is the same is neatly carved in Wood and either gilt or wrought in Directly before the Helm an armed Sword hangs down the Pomel Cross and Chape are gil  the Scabbard is made of the same Tissue or Cloth of Gold as the Mantlings are as is the Girdle that belongs to it but the Buckles and Pendants are of Copper Gilt  The Custom of setting up the He  m Crest and Sword over the Stall of the Knights is as ancient as the I  stitution of the Order but when the Banners were first hung up we have not so clear a Conviction for neither the Statutes of Institution nor those of  Henry  V make mention of them  The first time they occur to us we find to be in  Anno    Hen  VI in the black Book of the Order where the Banners of the King of  Portugal  is particularly  poke of among the Atchievements then set over the S  all But they are more particularly mentioned in the B  dy of King  Henry  VIII's Statutes  The Fashion of the Sovereign's and all the  KnightsCompanions  Banners are square yet it does no where appear what the exact Standard was yet we find them in the Reign of Q  een  Elizabeth  to be two Yards and a Quarter Long and a Yard and three Quarters Broad besides the F  inge which is composed of Gold or Silver and Silk of the Colours in the W  eath and on them are wrought upon TaffetySarcenet double Sarcenet or rich Taffety with fine Gold Colours on both sides the Pate  nal Coat of the  KnightsCompanion  toge  her with his Quartering or so many of them as he pleases to use and the Garter is to take care they be warrantably Marshalled  And because a si  gle Coat was not conceived to stand fair enough in a Banner of this proportion the Sovereign hath been pleased to grant a new Coat to bear in Quarters his Paternal one if he wanted it as King  James  I did to  Robert Carr  Viscount  Rochester  to who  e Paternal Coat he fi  st added a Lion Passant Gardant Or in the dexter Part as an especial Gift of his Favour and then invented a new C  at to be born in Quarter therewith  viz  Q  arterly Or and Gules a Lyon Rampant Sab  e over all  June    Anno    Jac  I  These Banners of Arms are fixed to the End of long S  aves painted in Oil formerly of the Colour of the Wreaths but now Red their Ends are put into Socke  s of Iron well fixed in the Wall directly over the  KnightsCompanions  Helms and Crests and frequently lined with Fustian to preserve them  There is moreover to be provided a Copper Plate Gilt whereupon are engraved the Escutcheon of the Knights elect Arms in Colours Enamilled with his Quartering Helm Cr  st and Supporters and underneath his Style and Titles of Honour enc  cled with a Garter Which Plate the Garter usually takes Care to provide and is to be fixed on the back of the Knights Stall assigned for his Installat  on  A Ve  et Cushion is likewise to be provided to carry the Knight's el  ct Mantle Collar Hood and Book of Statutes before h  m in the Progress into the Ch  ire in order to his Installation At the Installation of the Lord Treasurer  ston  and the Earls of  Exeter  and  Lindsey  who were i  stalled  Anno    Car  I the mater  als and garnishing of these Cushions are recited severally to contain  one Yard and a Half of Crimson Velvet one Ell of rich Taffety for their Lining four Yards of Fringe and four great Tossels  Lastly There have frequently been made ready a convenient Number of Lodging Escutcheons of the elect Knights Arms invironed with a Garter and his Stile and Titles placed underneath it having been an ancient Custom for the Knights to distribute these Escutcheons at the Inns in their Passage to and at  Windsor  as a Memorial of their Installation  What falls under the Care of the Garter to prepare and make ready the Expence sometimes has been cast up and the Account stated and defraid beforehand by which means he was in a better capacity to furnish out the Ceremony for so did the Earls of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland Anno    Eliz  Besides these mentioned to be prepared and provided either by the Chancellor of the Order or the Garter the Knight elect must take care of other Affairs more particularly relating to himself and his retinue such as are Apparel the Number of his Attendants and Servants  th their Cloaths and Liveries his Coach and Saddle Horses both for himself and them with other material Circumstances to set off his Cavalcade and Proceeding with greater Pomp and Gallantry The Provisions for Dyet at  Windsor  if the Feast be kept at the elect Knight's Ch  rge and Expence are to be considered of and very o  ten some Clark of the Sovereign's Kitchin is to be consulted in the management of that Affair  The Hall or Room where the grand Dinner is to be kept as well as the ChapterHouse and Chappel ought chiefly to be decked and adorned with rich and  umptuous Furn  ture against this Solemnity over and above what is commonly used The Hall or DiningRoom is to be set off with rich Hangings and if the Sovereign or his Lieutenant hold the Feast there must be placed a Cloth of State at the upper End of it The ChapterHouse is also to be hung and a rich Carpet spread upon the Table set about with Velvet Chairs and Cushions and because in the late Times of Rebellion and Plunder this Place was not exempr and nothing was found there upon the R  st  uration King  Charles  II in a Chapter convened the  o  January Anno  th of his Reign caused Directions  to be given to the Master of the Wardrobe to provide Velvet for Chairs to furnish the ChapterHouse and Cushions to be used in the Choir of St  George  's  Chappel  which accordingly were prepared against the following Feast  Against the Installation of  Philip  King of  Castile  and  Leon Anno    Henry  VII The Table in the ChapterHouse was covered with Cloth of Gold and the Forms with Baudkin before the Sovereign was laid a Cushion of Cloth of Gold whereupon a Crucifix lay and the Evangelist turned open to a place of the Cannon with several Tapers burning on either Side At the upper End of the Table towards the Right Hand was set a Chair for the Sovereign under a golden Canopy with Cushions of Cloth of Gold and on the Left Hand a Stool with like Embellishments for the King of  Castile  In St  George  's  Chappel  the High Altar is to be richly adorned with Plate the Sovereign's Stall with a Canop  and other usual Ornaments and the Stalls of the  KnightsCompanions  present at the Ceremony with Velvet Cushions As to the Furnishing of other Places in the Castle of  Windsor  on so solemn an Occasion we shall relate the Account of the Ceremony of the Installation of the King of  Leon  and  Castile  just now mentioned The Words are th  se  To wit of the gret rich Cobbord which continually stode in the gret Hall which was all gu  lt Plate or of the gret and rich Beds of Estate Hangings of rich Cloth of  old or of the rich and sumptuous Clothes of Arras with divers Clothes of Estate both in the King  's  Loggings and in the King of  Castile's  Loggings so many Chambers Haulls Chappels Closettes Galleries with odir Loggings so richly and very well appointed with divers odir things that I suffice or cannot discern and as I suppose few or none that there were that ever saw  Castell  or odir Loggings in all things so well and richly appointed and the  great continual fare open Houshold so many Noble Men soo well appareilled and with soo short Warnying heretofore as I think hath not been seen  CAP XII The Personal Installation of a KnightSubject  § FOrmerly the Knights elect proceeded from  London  to their Installation at  Windsor  in the nature of a Solemn and stately Cavalcade which was performed on Horseback with the greatest Grandeur and exceeding Pomp whether we refer to the great Number of their Honourable Friends who on gallant Coursers rode along with them or the multitude of their own Attendants well mounted the magnificence of whose Apparel Jewels Gold Chains rich Embroideries and Plumes of Feathers of their Lord's Colours struck Amazement and even dazled the Eyes of the Spectators  Equivalent to this Pompous Show was the Feast which contained in it all manner of Stateliness and Plenty as well of Provision as other Incidents that might increase its Glory in which the elect Knights who kept it at their own Expence strove not only to outvie their Predecessor but to Excel one another That all Embassadors and Strangers esteemed it one of the goodliest and noblest Sights that was to be exhibited in Christendom  But to make the splendor of the Cavalcade no less conspicuous to the City of  London  than to the Town and Castle of  Windsor  the Knights elect have taken up their Lodgings sometimes in the  Strand  sometimes in  SalisburyCourt  in  Holborn  or within the City and for intent they chose to pass through some Eminent Streets that the People might the better Survey them and receive the  greater Satisfaction To illustrate which Matter we shall descend to some Particulars  Anno    Eliz Gilbert  Earl of  Shrewsbury  in order to his Cavalcade was lodged in Mr  Gresham  's House now known by the Name of  GreshamCollege  whence he Rode through the City accompanied with many of his Honourable Friends and a numerous and gallant Train of Attendants and Servants to  CharingCross  where he met  George  Earl of  Cumberland  his Companion elect and thence both Rode together towards  Windsor  within a Mile or two of which Place Garter King of Arms me  them and Marshalled their Attendants in Order and then the elect Knights proceeded with their gallant Tra  n through the Town into the Castle in this Order  Trumpets two and two  Gentlemen in Blue Coats and Gold Chains  Gentlemen of Note  Garter  Gentlemen Ushers  The two elect Knights Earl of  Ormond  and Baron of  Effingham  with their Footmen about them  Noblemen Knights and Gentlemen of Quality  All their Servants in the Rear  Custom and Peace contributed to make the Cavalcades more glorious during the Reigns of Queen  Elizabet    and King  James  I and especially that o  Robert  Earl of  Salisbury  and  Thomas  Viscount  Bindon May  st  A  no    Jac  I who arrived at  Windsor  honourabl  accom  anied with a great appearance of Nobility Knights and Gentlemen of Figure  But the Fate of this Solemnity much like that glorious Body of the Sun whose Lustre at such times it stro  e to outshine had now and then its interpositions and intermitting Clouds at other times long Nights and the Splendor and Glory thereof but struck the Sight now and then when the Pleasure of the Sovereign grew auspicious or the Honour of the Order became fixed upon more generous S  irits But to speak im  artially there may grow an Excess in such Solemnities even to Sh  me and Surfeit and the best Cure to prescribe for it is a long Abstinence Nor was this Festi  al at all Times  ree  from this Distemper but then a quick Application of the Sovereign's soon rectified it by taking away the Cause and prohibiting Excess in their Attendants  For this reason it was that King  James  I observing those Excesses the elect Knights run in  o upon this Occasion and willing to cheque the growing Inconveniencies at the Installation of  Francis  Earl of  Rutland  Sir  George Villars  Kt afterwards Duke of  Buckingham  and the Viscount  Lisle Anno  of his Reign  fo  bid Livery Coats for saving Charge and avoiding Emulation  and shortly a  ter in a Chapter at  W  iteHall Anno  with the Consent of the  KnightsCompanions  then ass  mbled to put some restraint upon the Number of Attendants decreed  T  at every of the KnightsCompanions should have fifty Persons to attend him unto the Annual Solemnities of the O  der and no more  In the Installation of  William  Earl of  Northampton Anno    Car  I we find this stinted Number encreased to fourscore who began his Cavalcade to  Windsor  from  Sali  bury  House in the  Strand  and certainly wou'd have exhibited a more glorious Show had not a continual Rain for three Days space impeded him Nevertheless that what he designed with so mu  h Splendor and Gallantry might outlive the accident of foul Weather the Order of it shall be inserted

Dorset House  in  Salisburycou  t  and made their Progression severally through the Streets to  HydePark  each having two Noblemen to support him with their Footmen in rich Coats on either side them  Their Gentlemen Ushers rode Bareheaded and before them the Officers of Arms wearing their Coats and their Servants in blue Coats and Cognizances as was the ancient Mode were all led on by Trumpe  s The rest of the Lords Knights and Gentlemen followed after each Knight's elect Troop according to their Rank and Quality foremost The Proceeding of the Earl of  Morton  was Marshalled in this manner

Windsor  they all made a stand and being again placed in Order they proceeded to  Windsor Castle  where alighting in the lower Court the Knights elect were conducted to their several Apartments  The last Cavalcade this Age has beheld was exhibited by  Algernoon  Earl of  Northumberland May    Anno    Car  I from  Dorset House  in  Salisburycourt  toward  Windsor  nor was it the least in Pomp and Glory E  ght and forty Gentlemen preceeded then came the Pages being E  rls Sons  viz  Mr  William Herbert  Mr  John Herbert  Mr  Philip Cecil  Mr  Algernoon Sidney  Heralds at Arms two and two  Mr

in order they had Priority according to their Quality Riding two and two and the Coaches closi  g up the Troop  There was a publick Cavalcade designed from  Somerset House  in the  Strand  to  Windsor Castle  when King  Charles  II was to have been installed which though it proved Abortive yet ought not to be omitted by reason of the Chancellor's Letter to each  KnightCompanion  to make Preparation to attend him thither  May it please your Lordship  THE King's Majesty Sovereign of this most Noble Order of the Garter having determine  to Create the Prince his Eldest Son Knight and to propose him in Election to be a Companion of his Order for the better Conveniency of his I  stallation hath  rorogued by a Commission under the Se  l of his Order given the  th of  February  now remaining in my Custody the Celebration of the Feast of St  George  from the  and of  April  next whereon it shou'd have been Solemnized unto the  and of  May  immediately ensuing and thereby given Command to all  the  KnightsCompanions  and Officers of this Order that they should attend his Royal Person at his Palace of  WhiteHall  upon those Days appointed In discharge of the Duty of my Place and by special Order I do signify unto your Lordship his Majesty's Wi  l and that it is his Pleasure for the more Honour of the Prince and the Noble Feast of his Election and Installation that your Lordship shou'd be attended with your Servants and Retinue according to solemn Custom a  d be prepared to Accompany his Higness from  Somerset House  in the  Strand  unto the Castle of  Windsor  upon the th of that Month and assist at the Ceremony and Feast of his Installation upon the Day following Praying your Lordship that you would be pleased to take knowlege hereby both of the Time and Place designed and of the Sovereign's Order I humbly rest  In all due Obedience and Observance Thomas Rowe  St  Martin  's  lane  Feb    When this Letter was issued out the Sovereign intended to create the Prince Knight of the  Bath  which Ceremonies were intended to begin at the old  Palaceyard  in  Westminster  upon the st Day of  May Anno    Car  I and to Solemnize the Feast of St  George  upon the d of the same Month at  WhiteHall  and to take the Scrutiny that Evening for his Election into this Order The next Day was designed to invest him with the Garter and George and the Day after to set forward the Cavalcade towards  Windsor  wherein also the Knights of the  Bath  intended to be created with the Prince were to Ride with their Robes But this Resolution being altered stop'd the Progression of the Cavalcade and in the room of a Knight of the  Bath  he was created a  KnightBatchellor  at  Windsor  Formerly it was the manner for the Sovereign's Lieutenant to Ride to  Windsor  attended with a gallant and glittering Train and no small Number of his own Gentlemen and Yeomen richly attired and in every Punctilio  lio fifty set out as was seen in the Cavalcade of the Duke of  Norfolk  Earl Marshal of  E  gland  and Lieutenant for the Sovereign for St  George  's Feast  Anno    Eliz  who had attending him twenty of his own Gentlemen and Yeomen at the Time the Earls of  Northumberland  and  Warwick  were to be installed but this was never put in Practice but when the Sovereign appointed the I  stallation and the Feast of St  George  to be celebrated together  The Lieutenant and his Assistants or sometimes the  KnightsCommissioners  if the Feast of St  George  be not then Solemnized being arrived in the Castle immediately retire to their Lodgings which for the most part have been prepared at the  Dean's House  whose Rooms are the fairest in the Castle and the best  tted for Accommodation next to tho  e of the Sovereign's in the u  per Ward and for the Knights elect they were at all Times furnished with Lodgings in some of the Prebends Houses  The Offering in the Chappel on the Eve of the Fe  st  § If it so chanced that the Installation was performed by Commissioners and the Cavalcade proceeded from  London  in the Morning of the Day  receeding the Installation and arrived at the Castle of  Win  sor  early that Afternoon then the  KnightsC  mmissioners  have been accustomed only to put on their Mantles and ent  r St  G  rge  's Chappel to offer but without the Attendance of Heralds or any solemn Procession into the Choir sa  e one of the Prebends where having placed themselves in their Stalls with usual Reverences and heard an Anth  m th  y passed up to the Altar  ith the Verger and Garter befo  e them and there made their Offeri  g both of Gold and Silver according to the usual Custom As soon as  V  spers  were finished after the same manner they descended from their Stalls and de  arted to their Lodgings and in this case the  KnightsCommissioners  did not lay by their Mantles till Supper was ended  In this nature was the Ceremony of Off  ring on the E  e of the Insta  lation perform  d by the Lord Adm  ral and Earl of  O  mond  Commissioners for the Inst  ll  ion  of the Earl of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland Anno    Eliz  But at the Installation of the Earl of  Rutland  an  others  Anno    Eliz  the Lord  Hunsdon  one of the Commissioners for that Solemnity refused to make h  s O  fering alone though he arrived timely enough on the Eve o  the Feast at  Windsor  Castle because he wanted the Company of Viscount  Mountague  who was a joynt Commissioner with him that arrived not till the Morning after  This Offering of the  KnightsCommissioners  coming to the Castle on the Eve of the Installation is founded upon an Article of  Edward  III which runs to this Effect  That if any of the  KnightsCompanions  being upon a Journey shou'd accident  lly pass by  WindsorCastle  he is to turn in thither in Honour of the Place and prepare himself to enter into the Chappel to Offer first putting on his Mantle without which he must never presume to enter into it  but upon Emergencies and allowable Causes he is to be excused  After the  KnightCompanion  had entered the Castle the Canons Resident were by the aforesaid Article appointed to meet and recieve him and with due Reverence conduct him into the Choir If it was at the Celebration of High Mass the Knight was obliged to stay and hear it in Honour of God and St  George  but if he arrived in the Afternoon he was to stay till the Canons and the rest of the Choir had sung the Anth  m  de Profundis  which no s  oner was ended but he proceeded to the High Altar and Offered and returned to his Stall with u  ual Reverences and then departed  But if the  KnightCompanion  passed through the Town of  indsor  and neglected to Offer at the Chappel as of  en as he o  t  ed i  he was bound u  on his Obedience to walk a M  e on F  ot to the Cha  pel in Honour of St  Geo  ge  a  u  on defailure to offer a Peny which by King  VIII's Statutes is inlarged to a Croat Upon the Exp  cation of this Article t  ere arose a Dispute about the j  st Distance intended from the Castle and that the K  ightsCompanions might be sensible o  the  rea  h of the Inj  nction it was thought requisite by King  Hen  y  VIII to set down a certain Bound which in his S  a  utes is declared to be two Miles within which if any of the  KnightsCompani  ns  come and do not repa  r  to the Chappel and Offer he is liable to the Mulct before specified  Upon Hunting or other Pastimes the Forest afforded they used to send their Offering in Money to the Canons which being received the Knights took it for a Dispensation of the Ceremony enjoined by the Statu  es  Endeavours were used to have this Article interpreted with greater Latitude which so far took Effect that at a Chapter called at  Windsor  the th of  October Anno    Car  I it was ordered that some Expedient might be found out to save the Knights from the Breach of their Oath if they came within the limited Distance of the Place and passed thence without Offering But no farther Progress being made in that Affair the Law stands as it did  The Supper of the Eve  § The Supper after their arrival at  Windsor  is but in the Nature of a private Meal and prepared for the Lieutenant or Commissioners or Knights elect most commonly at the Dean's House  Anno    Eliz  on the Eve of the Installation of the Earl of  Rutland  and Lord  Cobham  the Commissioners su  ped together with such Lords and Gentlemen of Figure as came along with them and no Nobleman had above one Servant to a  tend him at the Table and the rest provided for themselves at their proper Inns Sometimes they have been permitted to Sup in some Appartments of the Sovereign's Lodgings for so it was at the Installation of the Lord  Russel  and other elect Knights  Anno    Henry  VIII and likewise of the Earl of  Shrewsbury  and Lord  Hunsd  n Anno    Eliz  the Lieutenant and Knights supped in the great Chamber there in the same Regularity that was used at other Times And in the th of Queen  Elizabeth  when the Earls of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland  were installed all the Lords and Gentlemen supped together at one long Table set in the Council Chamber  The Order in proceeding to the ChapterHouse  § Before we come to the particular Ceremonies of the Installation transacted either by the Sovereign or in his absence by his Lieutenant or Commissioners we shall premise this general Remark That since neither the Statutes of  Institution  nor those of King  Henry  V afford us a Formulary for the Personal Installation of a Knight elect yet those enacted by King  Henry  VIII do briefly exhibit the Order and Method of it And we must farther observe that if the Installation be appointed  ogether with the Feast of St  George  then either the Sovereign or else his Lieutenant and Assistants are present but if at any other Season then it passeth by Commissioners only  After such time therefore as the Sovereign his Lieutenant or Commissioners have prefixed the Hour wherein to proceed to the Chapter House in Order to the Installation which has generally been dispatched in the Evening all the  KnightsCompanions  and elect Knights the Officers of the Order and of Arms the Prebends of the College and AlmsKnights are to give their Attendance  viz  the KnightsCompanions and elect Knights and Officers of the Order on the Sovereign in his inward Lodging the elect Knights and Officers of Arms in the Presence Chamber the Prebends and AlmsKnights in the Great Chamber where they waited the Sovereign's coming forth  The Attendance to be given upon the Sovereign's Lieutenant and such of the KnightsCompanions as are appointed for his Assistants is by the Officers of the Order and of Arms the Prebends and AlmsKnights either at his Lodgings or elsewhere he shall deem meet to appoint from which the KnightsCompanions are exempt For though the KnightsCompanions have sometimes proceeded to the Chappel before the Sovereign's Lieutenant at an Installation yet hath it been at such time only as they accompanied their Sovereign to  Windsor  to hold the Feast of St  George  and if the Sovereign through any Indispositio  n  or weighty Affair cou'd not pass down to the Chappel on the Eve of the Feast yet they being obliged  by the Statutes to celebrate  Vespers  did upon this Occasion proceed thither though not upon the Account of Installation as it fell out at the Installation of Prince  Henry  and four other Knights  Anno    Jac  I when the Progression began from the Presence Chamber and thence passed to the Chappel in the following Order  AlmsKnights  Prebends  Pursuivants  Heralds    Ulster  King of Arms    Lyon  King of Arms    Clarenceux  King of Arms  The four elect Knights  Knights Companions  Garter  Register  Black Rod  Chancellor  The Sovereign's Lieutenant leading the Prince in his Hand  At the Installation of the Duke of  Brunswick  and five other elect Knights the d of  November Anno    Car  I the KnightsCompanions like wise proceeded before the Sov  reign's Lieutenants tho' the Sovereign was at  Windsor  but not in the Cavalcade  Upon the Sovereign's Commissioners neither the KnightsCompanions nor the Prelate nor Chance  lor do give their Attendance only at the Grand Feast of S    George Anno    Car  II the Chancellor then waiting on the Sovereign at  Windsor  in the Duties of his Place out of a singular Regard to his Royal Highness the Duke of  York  attending the Commissioners in the proceeding to his Installation for at that time he was Comptroller of his Houshould  The Proceedings on this solemn Occasion have been generally order'd on Foot yet upon extraordinary Incidents have been marshalled and disposed on Horseback in manner of a Cavalcade as was u  ed at the Installation of  Philip  King of  Castile Anno    Hen  VII and that when the Lord  Russel  and other elect Knights were installed  Anno    Hen  VIII King  Philip  when the Earl of  Sussex  was installed  Anno  and  Ph  and  Mar  honoured him with his Presence and riding on Horseback with several of the KnightsCompanions from his Lodgings in the Castle down to the Cloister Door at the EastEnd of the Chappel and there alighting proceeded directly to the ChapterHouse The Proceeding was on Horseback at the Installation of the Earl of  Shrewsbury  and the Lord  Hunsdon Anno    Eliz  and at the Earl of  Nort  umberland  's and Earl of  Wa  wick  's  Anno  At the Installati  n of  Francis  Duke  Montmorency  the Viscount  Hereford  and the Lords  Bu  leigh Grey  and  Shandos Anno    Eliz  The Sovereign's Lieutenant and Knights Assistants did Robe themselves in the Sovereign's Lodging in the Castle and meeting in the Presence Chamber proceeded downwards towards the  u  er Halldoor in the upper Ward of the Castle when taking their Horses adorned with Foot Clothes they proceeded on Hor  eback to the West Door of the Chappel  If the Progression was begun on Horseback at the beginning of the Feast so it continued as often as the Sovereign his Lieutenant or Commissioner went to the ChapterHouse or Chappel and their returns were marshalled in the like Order at their setting out  The Servants and Attendants belonging to the Knights elect if they be taken into the Procession pass on first two and two in a Rank according to their Quality and those who are the most inferior the foremost Next the Alm  Knights in their Habits and usual Order  Then follows the Virger of the College  After him the Prebends or Cano  s But what attendance they have given hereto  ore at the Installati  ns the Memoirs of this illustrious Society is wholly silent in for in those Schemes le  t us of proceeding to Installations in the Reigns of King  Henry  VIII King  Edward  VI Queen  Mary  and part of Queen  Elizabeth  we find them no  inserted though since they are next to the Prebends of the College the Pursuivants Heralds and Provincial Kings of Arms proceed i  a Body  After them the KnightsSubjects elect unless the Pr  ctor of an absent K  ightSubj  ct pass at the same time in this P  c  eding who take Place after the Provincial Kings And i  i  so ch  nce that the Pr  ctor to a Stra  gerP  e  be present at the same time he is to proceed between the KnightSubject's Proctor and the KnightsSubject elect But Prince  Henry  at his Installation  Anno    Jac  I moved in a Place Superior to all the KnightsCompanions and was paired with the Earl of  Nottingham  the Sovereign's Lieutenant for that Occasion Where two or more elect Knights prepare for their Installation at the same time they take Place according to the Seniority of their Election going two and two together and if the Number be odd the Junior elect Knight pas  eth alone Formerly the elect Knight passed in his ordinary Apparel wearing over it in Days of Yore a short Gown afterwards a Cloak and of latter Times a Coat as did the Earl of  Northumberland Anno    Eliz  and the Earls of  Pembrook  and  Derby Anno    Eliz  and the Annals of the Order make this remark upon the Earl of  Sussex  and the Lord  Buckhurst Anno  of  Eliz  of  Charles  Duke of  York An    Jac  I But this was before any peculiar under Habi  was appointed to the KnightsCompanions for now there being a Cloth of Silver Doublet and Trunk Hose established to be worn at the Feast of Installation and of St  George  the elect Knight proceeds in this Dress as did the Duke of  Albermarle Anno    Car  II  In this proceeding to the ChapterHouse he wears only the Garter about his Leg and the George and the R  bbond wherewith he was invested either about his Neck or as of late drawn under his right Arm which being o  itted by Sir  George Villars  and Viscount  Lisle  is noted to be contrary to order  The Earl of  Rutland  with his Fellow elect Knights  Anno    Jac  I proceeded Bar  headed as did the Duke of  Lenox Anno    Car  I as well as the Duke of  Albermarle Anno    Car  II  The elect Knight does not always make one in this Proceeding but sometimes stays at his Lodgings in the Castle as did the Earls of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland Anno    Eliz  or else at some other convenient Station adjoining to the ChapterHouse till he be sent for in thither to receive Investiture with the Surcoa  as the Duke o  Montmorency  did and other elect Knights  Anno    Eliz  who went privately from the Sovereign's Lodgings down to the House of Mr  French  then one of the Prebends and rested in the Parlour un  il they were sent  for Sometimes the Knight elect goes privately into the EastIsle of the Chappel behind the High Altar and there remains till called in as did the Duke of  Monmouth Ann    Car  II  If the Sovereign be present at the Installation the KnightsCompanions proceed next after the Knights elect according to the order of their Stalls but if the Sovereign's Lieutenant then his Assistants go in their Places as at the Installation of the Earl of  Shrewsbury  and Lord  Hunsdon Anno    Eliz  makes plain the proceeding being ordered after this manner  Vergers  AlmsKnights  Officers of Arms  ElectKnights  Assistants to the Lieutenants  Officers of the Order  Earl of  Arundel  Lieutenant  If the Installation be dispatched by Commissioners then the three inferior Officers of the Order immediately follow the Knight elect and proceed next before the Commissioners and they were thus marshalled at the Installation of the Earl of  Northampton Anno    Car  I  The Earls Servants  AlmsKnights  Prebends  Heralds  ElectKnights  Officers of the Order  The Sovereign's Commissioners  Yet  Anno    Eliz  at t  e Installation of the Earls of  Pembrook  and  Derby  we find the Officers did  recede the elect Knights but it was through inadvertency at the I  stallation of the Earl of  Northampton  some Q  estion and D  ate arose c  ncerning the precedency of the  e three Officers in this proceeding where it was at length concluded that from the Castle to the Chappel they shou'd proceed before the Commissioners  ut in returning from the Chappel to the Castle they shou'd follow  We presume the Question whatsoever it was chanced not to be propounded till the proceeding was ready to pass on and then started on a sudden because the Heralds as the Annals note did not quickly discypher the matter that it proceeded more from surprize than want of Ability to resolve  This determination which took Place was barely grounded upon Conjecture and if seriously considered will appear disconsonant to Precedents and Practice both before and since where all returns are marshalled answerable to their setting forth unless the Condition of any Person in the mean time suffer a Mutation  It's observable that when Installation pass by Commissioners only these three inferior Officers wear their Robes but bear not the Ensigns of their Office in the Proceeding And this seems to be deduced from particular Injunctions laid down in the Constitutions belonging to the Officers of the Order which appoint Garter an  BlackRod to bear the Ensigns of their Offices at the Feast of St  George  when the Sovereign or his Deputy shall be present whence it may be inferred that if either chance to be absent they are under no obligation to bear th  m For at the Installations of  Frederick  King of  Denma  k  and  John Casimire  Count Palatine of the Rhine  Anno    Eliz  no Ensigns were born by the Officers and so was it practised the Year after at the Installations of the Earl of  Rutland  and Lord  Cobham  as the RedB  ok of Order plainly sets forth But if the Sovereign hi  self be present or that he constitute a L  eutenant in his stead the Register then carries the RedBook and the Garter and the BlackRod bear each of them their R  ds It is remarkable that in every proceeding to Installati  n b  Lieutenant or Commissioners the Garter c  es the Sovereign's Commission in his Hand before them to the ChapterHo  se At the Installation of the Earls of  Derby  and  M  eton  the Officers of the Order pro  eeded be  o  e the Knights to the ChapterHouse not on  wi  hout the Ensigns of their Office but their Heads co  red and the re  o  ter of this In  allation gives this for a  eas  n because there was then neither the Sovereign nor his Lieutena  t representing the King's Person pr  t  The Sovereign sometimes being willing to confer additional Honours to some elect Knights hath appointed their Installation at such time as he personally solemnized the Feast of St  George  as he did at the Installation and Election of  Philip  King of  Castile Anno    Hen  VII which for its memorableness and mixt proceeding on Horseback we shall insert in this Place He passed from the Sovereign's Lodging in the Castle to the SouthDoor of St  George'sChappel  and was thus ordered  Knights according to their Degrees  Lords after their Degrees  KnightsCompanions in their whole Habi  bearing Company with some of the Knights of the Orde  of  Joyson d' Or  Prelate of the Order  Archbishop of  Canterbury  The  Spanish  Ambassador    Joyson d' Or  King of Arms in Coat of Arms  Garter King of Arms in his Coat of Arms  The Sword    Philip  King of  Castile  The Prince  King  Henry  VII Sovereign of the Order  Anno    Jac  I was another instance at the Feast of St  George  when the Sovereign with several KnightsCompanions proceeded also to the Chapel at the personal Installation of  Frederick  Prince Palatine of the  Rhine  we might add several other Examples but shall o  ly mention that of the personal appearance of King  Charles  II at the grand Feast of St  George  held next after his happy Restoration whereat twelve elect Knights were  stalled At this Solemnity of Installation the Sovereign proceeds in full Robes having the Sword of State bo  n before him by a Nobleman not of the Order his Trainbearers c following the Sovereign's Lieutenant and his Assistants as also the Commissioners proceed in full Robe  which is mention'd  Anno    Henry  VIII when the Earl of  Arundel  and his Assistants installed the Lord  Russel  and two other elect Knights but the Sovereign's Lieutenan  only hath his Train carried up which is usually perform'd by some of his own Gentlemen  The Processional way if beginning in the PresenceChamber is from thence in the upper Ward  f the Castle and through the other Wards in at the Cloyster D  r and so to the ChapterHouse but if from the Dean's House they go only through the Cloysters into which there is an immediate Passage from the Deanry The proceeding having entred the East Door of St  George  's Chapel and past by the ChapterHouse Door makes a stand in the North Isle while first the Offi  ers of the Order next the KnightsCommissioners or else the KnightsAssistants and the Sovereign's Lieutenant or lastly the KnightsCompanions and the Sovereign with the Sword born before him pass into the ChapterHouse but the Knight or Knights elect do not enter but as they come in at the ChapelDoor they fall off on the left Hand into the East Isle behind the high Altar and there repose themselves on Chairs or Stools with Cushions  urposely prepared until they are called into the ChapterHouse This hath generally been the Custom of which many Examples might be produced but in respect to great Personages they have been sometimes though rarely admitted into the ChapterHouse with the Sovereign or his Lieutenant among whom  Philip  of  Castile  and  Leon Anno    Henry  VII and Prince  Henry Anno    Jac  I the latter was led in by the Sovereign's Lieutenant when four other elect Knights insta  ed with him sat till they receiv'd their Summons to enter  Sometime the Sovereign and KnightsCompanions wav'd going to the ChapterHouse and pass'd immediately into the Choir as did King  James Anno  when  Charles  Duke of  York  and others were installed the like did King  Charles  I but then a Chapter was held in the PrivyChamber before the proceeding set forward and in the former instance when the proceeding came as far as the East End of the Chapel the Duke of  York  c with  Norr  y  before them went out of the proceeding into the ChapterHouse and there reposed while the Sovereign  oceeded on to the South Door of the Chapel and thence  nto the Choir  The Ceremonies perform'd in the ChapterHouse  § After the Lieutenant's entrance into the ChapterHouse and opening the Chapter Garter with three Reverences presents first the Commissioners of Lieutenancy to hold the Feast next that of Installation to the Lieutenant or if the Installation pass'd by Commissioners then only the Commission of Installation to the Senior Commissioner which being receiv'd he delivers it to the Register of the Order who forthwith Reads it for to him this Duty belongs as is recorded in the BlackBook of the Order on occasion of Garter's reading the Commission for Installation of Sir  Thomas Brandon Anno    Henry  VII the Register being then absent  When the Register hath read the Commissions he returns them to the Lieutenant or Commissioners and he again to the Garter as at the Installation of the Earls of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland Anno    Eliz  If the Sovereign be present the Chancellor acquaints him the Knights elect are without otherwise the Lieutenant and A  sistants or Commissioners consult touching the calling in and receiving them and Garter is usually employed in this Service who with all due respect compliments and conducts him to the ChapterHouse Door But in the instance of the Earls of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland  aforesaid Garter went to their Lodgings and having delivered his Message they forthwith repaired to the ChapterHouse their Train attending them to the Door At the Installation of  Francis  Duke of  Montmorency  the Ea  l of  Leicester  then the Sovereign's Lieutenant as an evidence of singular respect sent from the Chapter two of the four Assistants assigned him who taking Garter and the Officers of Arms before them led him thence between them to the ChapterHouse  When there are two or more elect Knights that wait in the East Isle expecting to be called i  Garter first c  nducts the Senior by Election to the ChapterHouse Door and so the rest in their several Orders as in  Jac  I by the Earl of  Rutland  Sir  George Villars  and the Vi  count  Lisle  and so again  Car  II As soon as Garter hath conducted the elect Knight to the ChapterHou  e  Door two of the Commissioners when the Installation is performed by Commissioners or two of the KnightsAssistants when by the Sovereign's Lieutenant or two of the Senior Knights if the Sovereign himself be present receive him without who is immediately conducted from the ChapterHouse Door up to the Sovereign his Lieutenant or Commissioners to whom he makes humble Reverence when the Lieutenant or Senior Commissioners in a short Speech publishes the effect of his Commission and declares to him the Sovereign's bounty and ready kindness in a full admittance into this Honourable Society which the elect Knight very humbly acknowledges and accepts When  Philip  King of  Castile  and  Leon  was installed in Person  Anno    Henry  VII the Sovereign being present rose from his Throne and gave him Information of the Statutes and Ceremonies of the Order and how he was bound by them to all which he freely and readily assented  These Ceremonies of receiving an elect Knight being over he disrobes himself of his upper Garment then the Surcoat and Kirtle is taken from the Table with which he is invested and during this Ceremony the following Words of Admonition entred at the end of King  Hen  VIII's Book of English Statutes are read or spoken  Take this Robe of Purple to the encrease of your Honour and in Token or Sign of the most Honourable Order you have receiv'd wherewith you being defended may be bold not only strong to Fight but also to offer your self to shed your Blood f  r Christ's Faith the Liberties of the Church and the just and necessary defence of them that are oppressed and needy  After this his Sword is close girt about him over his Surcoat by the Commissioners or the Assistants to the Lieutenan  or some of the KnightsCompanions and sometimes in the way of assistance Garter hath done this Service and as soon as the Ceremony is over the Sovereign or his Lieutenant proceeds into the Choir leaving the elect Knights behind them The Hood was hereto  ore put on in the ChapterHouse for so the Statutes of King  Henry  VIII do appoint after the elect Knight hath been invested with his Surcoat and before he proceeded to his Installation but of late because it must be  taken off again in the Choir and laid aside that the Mantle may be put on it hath been esteemed a sort of diminution in the Investiture to take off any part of the Habit before the whole Investiture be compleated so that in the beginning of the Reign of King  James  I it was judged more convenient that the Hood should be carried on the Cushion by Garter into the Choir together with the Mantle and Collar and not be put on till after Investiture with the Mantle and thus it was observed at the Feasts of St  George  and  Car  II And though antiently it was laid over the left Shoulder and so worn upon all Occasions yet  Anno  and  Phil  and  Mar  the wearing it so being taken notice of to obscure the Escutcheon of St  George  embroidered on the same Shoulder of the Mantle it was decreed in a Chapter held the same Year of  April  that for the future the KnightsCompanions should wear their Hoods on their right Shoulders to the end that the Escutcheon might be the better seen and appear  Nevertheless there was a Question moved  Jac  I whether the usage of wearing the Hood should not be restored to the left Shoulder but it seems it was overruled and  Car  II some of the KnightsCompanions imagining it most proper to wear their Hoods on their left Shoulders ran into that error but upon better information the next Morning altered them to the right To Foreign Princes there is liberty given by King  Hen  VIII's Statutes to receive if they please their Habit wholly within the ChapterHouse before they enter their Stalls by which it appears that this was the Custom in times past an instance whereof we have in  Philip  King of  Castile Anno    Henry  VII who was entirely invested in the ChapterHouse with the Garter Surcoat Mantle Hood and Collar the Sovereign himself putting his Hand to his Investiture with the Mantle Hence King  Philip  Grandson to the aforesaid King of  Castile  was invested with the whole Habit of the Order before he assumed the Stall in  Philip  and  Mary  's proceeding to the Chapel he receiv'd his Investiture within the West Door and there the Register delivered the Mantle to the Earls of  Derby  and  Pembrook  who kissing it presented it to the Queen who assisted by the said Earls personally invested the King therewith Next Garter gave the Collar to the  Earls of  Arundel  and  Pembrook  who likewise presented it to the Queen and she thereon put it about King  Philip  's Neck and immediately the KnightsCompanions having robed themselves within the Chapel Door proceeded before the King and Queen who with joined Hands passed into the Choir where the Queen led him to the Sovereign's Stall which ascending they both sat therein But as the aforesaid Statute leaves this to the pleasure of the Stranger Prince and was permitted only for gaining Time so none who have receiv'd personal Installation at  Windsor  since have been fully invested before they entered the Choir For instance  Francis  Duke  de Montmorency    E  iz  and  Frederick  Prince Palatine of the  Rhine    Jac  I were both invested with their Surcoats only in the ChapterHouse but they receiv'd their Mantles Hoods and Collars in their Stalls after they had taken their Oaths  The proceeding into the Choir  § The Knight elect habited as before proceeds from the ChapterHouse along the North Isle and enters the West Door of the Choir in solemn Order but his Place in this proceeding is changed for here he is led between two KnightsCompanions This is noted in the BlackBook to be the Order wherein  Albra Vasques d'Almadea  Earl of  Averence  and two others proceeded to their Installations  Henry  VI And notwithstanding the Statutes of Institution and those made by King  Henry  V are silent in the Order of this Proceeding yet for an elect Knight to be led to his Stall between two fellow Knights is no modern Ceremony since we likewise find that the Vi  count  B  urchier    Henry  VI past to his Instalment between the Lord  Hastings  and Lord  Beauchamp  But the Order of proceeding is precisely set down in  Henry  VIII's Statutes  viz That the elect Knight attended by his Gentlemen and Servants shall be led between two other KnightsCompanions the Officers of the Order going before them  And this has been the constant Practice at all Installations since the Knight elect pr  ceeding either between two of the KnightsCommissioners when there hath been no Lieutenant or between two of the  Knights Assistants where a Lieutenant was constituted or lastly between the two Senior KnightsCompanion  s  the Sovereign being present But when there hath bee  n  three Commissioners named then the two Senior Commissioners take the Knight elect between them and the Junior KnightCommissioner proceeds before them which was observed at the Instalment of the Earls of  Essex  and  Ormond  and Sir  Christopher Hatton    Eliz  In all cases where the Sovereign is present at an Installation after the custom of investing with the Collar in the ChapterHouse was left off it is generally to be observed that as soon as the Investiture with the Surcoat is finished the Sovereign passes from the ChapterHouse into the Choir with the whole proceeding before him leaving the elect Knight behind and when he and the KnightsCompanions have taken their Sta  ls the two Senior KnightsCompanions by the Sovereign's verbal Directions descend from their Stalls and stand under their Banners whilst the AlmsKnights but not the Prebends Officers of Arms and the three inferior Officers of the Order pass out of the Choir and proceed before them to the ChapterHouse from whence they introduce the elect Knight into the Choir to his Installation but if there be more than one Knight installed then the two next Senior Knights descend and so the next till all the elect Knights are conducted in And this course is likewise observed when a Lieutenant is c  nstituted and hath been generally so practised since the Investiture with the Collar was performed in the Choir and particularly at the Installations of the Duke of  Lenox  the Ear  s of  Pembrook Marr  and  Southamp  n    Jac  I and of the Duke of  Holstein  and the Earl of  Northampton    Jac  I In this proceeding to Installation the Register usually carries a Book of the New Testament for the elect Knight to take his Oath on as likewise the Oath it self fairly written on Parchment Garter bears his Mantle till he arrives at his Stall and King  Henry  VIII's Statutes place this Service upon some of the KnightsCompanio  s likewise but it never appears that it was ever performed by any of them 'Tis probable that about the time when this Injunction passed it was the Custom for Garter to bear the Mantle on his Arm for so it was at the Installation of the Lord  Russel  and others  Henry  VIII but it was  not long after that the laying it on a Velvet Cushion began The great Collar of the Order was likewise laid upon the Cushion at the Installation of Sir  Henry Sidney    Eliz  the Earl of  Shrewsbury    Eliz  and in this manner born before the Knights e  ect  Car  II before the Duke of  Monmouth    Car  II and before the Duke of  Albermarle    Car  II with these the Hood heretofore put on in the ChapterH  use hath of late been laid on the Cushion and also the Book of Statut  s and so born by Garter before Prince  Henry    Jac  I and  Frederick  Elect or Palatine  Jac  I and before the Knights Installation  Car  II and since  And here it is to be observed that when Garter bears the Ornaments and Ensig  s on the Cushion before an elect Knight or a Proctor he is always placed betwee  the Register and BlackRod in the proceeding Lastly in this proceeding the Knight elect goe  h Bareheaded holding his Cap in his Hand and so did  he Duke of  Albermarle    Car  II for it ha  h been thought incongr  ous to the Order of Investiture as is before observed of the Hood to put on any part of the Habit or other Ornamen  s that must be taken off again before the Investitu  e is compleated and the proper P  ace for putting on the Cap is not till all the other is finished  The Ceremonies of Installation  § When the proceeding hath entered the Choir the AlmsKnights and Officers of Arms make their Obeysances toward the High Altar and the Sovereign's Royal Stall in the manner hereafter described then they proceed to the Steps before the Al  ar an  divide themselves next the Officers of the Order make the same Reverence and lastly the two Commissioners or Knights Assistants or KnightsCompa  io  s and Knightselect  all three together After this the Officers of the Order turn aside toward the Sta  designed  or the elect Knight and approaching near it stand below in the Choir whilst the Commissioners or Assistant  or KnightsCompanion  pass into the lower Row of Stalls sometimes called the midd  e Row directly under the designed Stall leading the elect Knight with them who in this Place takes his  Oath called in the Annals the sacred Oath of the Order of the Garter during which time he ought to stand between the two KnightsCompanions who brought him thither as at the Installation of Prince  Henry    Jac  I and when the Earl of  Shrewsbury  was installed  Eliz  'tis observed that the Senior Commissioner first entered the lower row of Stalls but  Henry  VIII at the Installation of the Lord  Russel  and others the Junior Assistant went up first The Kn  ght elect being thus placed the Register of the Order standing before them but below in the Choir reads the Oath for it is part of his Duty to administer the same And in this solemn Ceremony the New Testament whereon the Oath is taken generally opened in some Place of the Gospels is indifferently held by one of the three inferior Officers of the Order or sometimes the Register hath held it as at the Installation of the Earl of  Derby    Eliz  the Earl of  Rutland  and Lord  Cobham    Eliz  At other times the Garter hath held it as  Eliz  when the Earl of  Northumberland  took his Oath and  Car  I at the Installa  ion of the Earl of  Moreton  But when the Earl of  Shrewsbury  was Sworn  Eliz  the Usher of the Black Rod performed this Office  Whilst the Oath is administring the elect Knight holds his right Hand on the Holy Evangelists and when the Register hath pronounced the Words he immediately Responses  I will so help me God  and then takes off his Hand reveren  ly kissing the Book and by this Ceremony seals his Obligation to the Statutes of this most Noble Order The Ceremony used when  Philip  King of  Castile  and  Leon  took the Oath which was done in the ChapterHouse at  Windsor    Henry  VII he laid h  s Hand on the C  non under which was placed the Book of Statutes of the Order by the Prelate to whom it was delivered b  the Register and having repeated the Words of the Oath and reverentl  ki  ed all those things by which he Swore he took a Pen  rom the Prelate's Hand and Signed the Oath he had taken and deliver'd it to the Sovereign then present  The Form of the ancient Oath app  inted by the Statutes of Institution to be taken by a KnightSubject was very short but comprehensive  That he should well and faithfully observe to the utmost of his Power all the  Statutes of the Order  and this was all the Oath taken by the first Founders and to which they also affixed their Seals and so it continued without alteration or addition till towards the End of King  Edward  IV's Reign and then at a Chapter held at the King's Wardr  be in  London  it was decreed That all the KnightsCompanions then alive and all such as should afterwards be admitted into the Order should be obliged to su  join the Words following  That they wou'd aid support and defend with all their Power  the Royal College of St  George  within the Castle of  Windsor as well in its P  ss  ssions as all other things whatsoever  which being drawn in form was enter'd in the Black Book but has since receiv'd many alterations And there is an instance  Eliz  when the Oath has been dispensed with as by the Duke o  Norfolk  and others in regard the Rites and Ceremon  e  of Religion were then altered and no new form of an Oath settled so that they only obliged themselves by Promi  e to observe such Statutes and Orders as should be decreed in the next Council of the Order which was soon after settled and recorded in the Red Book of the Order a  d is the Oath taken by a KnightSubject at this Day  You being Chosen to be one of the Honou  able Company of this most Noble Order of the Garter shall P  omise and Swear by the Holy E  angelists by you here touched that wittingly or willingly you shall not break any Statute of the said Order or any Articles in them contained t  e same being agreeable and not repugnant to the Laws of Almighty God and the Laws of this Realm as f  r forth as to you belongeth and appertaineth So help you God and this Holy Word  As soon as the Knight elect hath t  ken the Oath he is led to his appointed S  all through the Entrance  ext beneath it and there placed before it In the In  e  im Garter advancing into the lower row of Stalls to the Place where the elect Knight stood when he took the O  th presents from thence the Mantle Collar and Book of Statutes to those who led him who invest the Knight elect first with the Mantle by putting it on his Shoulders There are some Examples where the elect Knight hath been invested before he went up to his Sta  l  as in the case of the Earl of  Northumberland    Eliz Francis  Duke  de Montmorency  and others  Eliz  the Earls of  Dunbar  and  Montg  mery    Jac  I and the Prince of  Wales    Car  I among which may be numbered tho  e installed at the Grand Feast of St  George    Car  II but this happen'd through a vast Concourse of People in the Chapel that prevented the due Order  In the Red Book it is observed that the Investiture with the Mantle and Collar hath been sometimes performed by the Black Rod as at the Ins  allation of the Earl of  No  thampton    Car  I the Lord Treasurer  Weston  the Earls of  Exeter  and  Lindsey  and the Marquiss of  Hamilton    Car  I Nevertheless this is to be understood as this Officers Assistance to the KnightsCompanions whose Office it only is and no otherwise Whilst the Ceremony of Investiture with the Mantle is performing the Words of Admonition proper thereto are pronounced as follows  Take this Mantle of Heavenly Colours in Sign and T  ken of the most Honourable Order you have receiv'd and to the increase of your Honour signed and ma  ked as you see with a red Escutcheon of our Lord's Cross to the intent that yo  being always defended by the Virtue and Strength there  f  may pass through your Enemies and them also overcome and vanquish so that at the last for you  worthy and app  ved Acts you may after th  s Temporal Chivalry come to Eternal Triumphant Joys in Heaven  But at the Installation of King  Charles  II they receiv'd some alteration and were put in the following Form  R  ceiv  this R  be of Heavenly Colour the Livery of this m st excellent Order in augmentation of thy Honour enobled with the Shield and Red C  oss of our Lo  d by wh se Power thou may'st safely pierce T  oops of thy Enemies and be over them ever Victorious and being in this t  mp  ral Wa  fa  e Glorious in  gregious and her  ick Actions thou may'st ob  a  n Eternal and T  iumphant J  y  Next the Commissioners Assistants or KnightsCompanions lay the Hood on the K  ight's right Sh  ul  er over the Mantle and bringing the Tippet athwart his B  east t  ck it under the Girdle at which his Sw  rd  hangs And lastly tye the Collar about his Shoulder over his Mantle and Hood and at this part of the Investiture the following Words of Admonition are likewise pronounced  To the encrease of your Honour and in Token of the Honourable Order you hav  receiv'd take this Collar about your Neck with the Image of the Holy Martyr and Christ's Knight St  George  by whose aid you being defended may pass through the Prosperities and Adversities of this World that having here the Victory as well of your Ghostly as B  dily Enemies you may not only receive the Glory and Renown of Temporal Chivalry but also at the last the endless and everlasting reward of Victory  This Form of Words receiv'd likewise alteration when King  Charles  II was to be installed to the Te  or following  Wear this Collar about thy N  ck adorn'd with the Image of the Blessed Martyr and Soldier of C  rist St  George  by whose Imitation provoked thou may'st so overpass both prosperous and adverse Encounte  s that having stoutly vanquished thy Enemies both of Body and Soul thou m  y'st not only receive the Praise of this tra  sient Co  bat but be Crowned with the Palm of eternal Victory  Antiently at the Solemnity of Installation when the Sovereign or his Lieutenant was present the elect Kn  ght after he had been invested with the Mantle in his Stall was immediately conducted out of the Ch  ir back to the Cha  terHouse where the Sovereign or Lieutenant used to remain till his return there to receive the Collar of the Order from one of them which done he is said to have receiv'd the entire Poss  ssion of his Habit This is contained in King  Henry  VIII's S  a  utes and appears to have been  he Practice about that Time as in the case of the L  rd  Moun  joy  and others  Hen  VIII and several others after in the and  Edw  VI and the and  Eliz  The Proceeding back to the ChapterH  u  e on this occasio  was much after the manner of what is before mention'd exce  t that here the new installed Knight took his Place according to the Dignity of  his Stall But 'tis observable that when the Sovereign's Lieutenant remained in the ChapterHouse while the elect Knight proceeded to his Installation the Usher of the BlackRod stayed behind to attend the Lieutenant and as soon as the Investiture with the Collar was over the Lieutenant proceeded to the Cho  r in the Rear and the new installed Knight in Place according to his Stall as in the case of the Lord  Russel  and others  Hen  VIII and the Marquiss of  Dorset  and others  Edw  VI The Proceeding having entered the Choir and the Lieutenant and KnightsCom  anion  tak  n their Seats then the usual Ceremonies the Service of the Church began  But when the Installation was performed by Commissioners the Collar of the Order was laid on the Cushion with the Mantle and born before the elect Knight to his Stall where after his Investiture with the Mantle and Hood he receiv'd Investit  e with the Collar al  o of which th  re are sever  l Examples in the time of  P  l  and  Mar  and Queen  Eliz  In like manner at all In  tallat  ns since where the Sovereign has been present the a  cient custom of retu  ning to the Cha  terHouse being  aid aside the KnightsCompanions who le  the elect Knights to their Sta  ls did there i  vest them with the  r Collars also as the Ea  l of  Rutland  Si  Georg  Villa  s  and the Viscount  Lisl      Jac  I and the Earl of  Suffolk    Car  I and ha  h been thus observed at all Installations since the Sover  ign present  So soon as the Investiture with the Mantle Hood and Collar is over those a  poin  ed deliver the Book  f Statutes to the new in  ested K  ight which was observed to the Ear  s of S  wsbu  y and  Cumberland    Eliz  the Earl o  Rutland  Sir  George Villars  and the Viscount  Lisle    Jac  I and so generally to all elect Knights since Thi  Book the K ight is to keep safe in his o  n Custody for  is In'  uction in the Laws and Ceremonies of this m  st N  le Order They l  kewise gi  e him the Black V  lvet Cap adorned with P  umes of white F  thers and this in  articular was observed to be the l  st Cerem  ny per  me  at the I  sta  lation of King  Charles  II  All th  ngs  lating to the full Investiture being ended there remai  s only to compleat this great Cer  mony the Insta  la  ion it self which is perfo  med in the manner followi  g The new invested Knight standing before his  Stall and turning toward the High Altar makes humble Obeysance that way and then toward the Sovereign or if absent toward his Stall which done the Commissioners KnightsAssistants or KnightsCom  anions receive and embrace him with great Civility as their Fellow and Companion and set him down in his assigned Stall with Professions of Esteem and Wishes for his Honour and Happiness Of this Ceremony there is a notable Instance at the Installat  on of  Philip  King of  Castile    Henry  VII where the Sovereign personally introduced him to his Stall and there placed h  m at which time there was a certain Form of Words pronounced relating to the elect Knight's Session and Act of Installation no less than at his Investiture but the same are not repeated  The Order to be observed when two or more Knights are installed in one Day  § In this case it seems to have been the ancient Practice when the C  m  ny has been perform'd by two Commissioners or two KnightsAssistants that as soon as they had finished al  the Ceremonies due to the Senior of them they left him possest of his Stall and forthwith returne  to the ChapterHo  e in the usual manner and thence conducted the next Seni  r el  ct Knigh  and so of the rest So it was at the Installation of  Albro Vasques d'Almadea  Earl of  Ave  enches  the L  rd  Beauchamp  and Sir  Thomas Hoo  in the time of  Hen  y  VI and so of the Earl of  Huntington  Edw  VI when the two Assistants after they had invested and installed the said Earl  eturned to the ChapterHouse for the Lor  la War  and so for  he Lord  Cob  am  and Sir  William He  bert  In like manner wh  n the Commissioners had given the Proctor to  Emanuel  Duke of  Savoy  Possession of his Prin  pal's Stall and  Phil  and  Mar  they proceeded back for  William  Lord  Howard  so by the Earl of  Pembro  k    Eliz  when they had first installed the Earl of  De  by  and by the Earl of  Cumbe  land  after the Earl of  Shrewsbury  had been installed  When the Sovereign hath nominated three Commissioners they have returned altogether to s  tch in the other Knights singly that were to be installed and alternately  changed their Places in the proceeding to the several Installations one of them always going single before as at the Installation of the Earls of  Essex  and  Ormond  and Sir  Christopher Hatton    Eliz  when the Earl of  Worcester  the Lords  Hunsdon  and  Grey  were Commissioners And if the Lieutenant had four Assistants assigned him which was necessary when many Knights were to be instal  ed the order of their Installation hath been as follows  First Two of the Senior Knights  Assistants conducted the Senior elect Knight to his Installation and the other two Assistants proceeded with the second elect Knight the former then took the third elect Knight and so alt  nately changed till all w  re installed As at the Installation of  F  ancis  Duke  de Montmorency  and others  Eliz  And the like manner of alternate change is observed i  four Commissi  ners be constituted as at the Installa  ion of  Frederick  King of  Denmark  and  John  Prince Palat  ne of the  Rhine    Eliz  where the King's Proxy was conducted into the Choi  between the Earl of  Leicester  and the Lord  Hunsdon  the two Senior Commissioners and the Prince between the Earl of  Huntington  and the Lord  Ch  rles Howard  the two J  nior Co  m  ssioners  But some have been of O  inion that the Commissioners named to t  s Em  loyment ought not to divide the Duty and pa  t of them to Instal one and part the other and by such an alternati  e to dispatch the Ceremony as in  ormer Ca  e  but all jointly a  sist at each Installati  n Of which Opinion there is an Instance at the Installat  on  f the Earl o  and the Viscount  Bindon    Jac  I where th  ha  ing been brought into the Choir inv  sted a  d installed by the Earls of  Nottingham  and  the t  o Senior C  mmissioners the other two Commi  sioners wh  were left behind in the ChapterHouse to co  duct the V  count to his Stall remembring that all four  re jo  t C  mmi  sioners apprehen  ed  hat the Earl  l  gall  insta  ed because they as Co  partners in  had not a  sisted and this O  inion bei  g  so far that it was agreed to be impar  ed  f  Sal  sbu  y  who submitted to descend into  hi  Stal  and there all f  ur  g  e  m his Oath again then led him to his  Stall and a second Time invested and installed him and so of the Viscount  Bindon  But this Method was not only new but different from former Practice as in all the cases before recited and besides where the Sovereign hath authorized his Li  utenant to perform this Ceremony and appointed some of the KnightsCompanions to assist they and not the Lieutenant have done the Duty belonging to Installation that part of it of investing with the Collar in the ChapterHouse the whole Duty at the Installation of Prince  Hen y  excepted And 'tis to be farther o  ser  ed that the foregoing case of the joint Assistance in the Installation of the Earl of  Salisbury  was thought so little Essential or worthy of becoming a Precedent that at the very next Feast when the Earls of  Dunbar  and  Montgomery  were installed  Jac  I and four Commissioners appointed the two S  ni  r in  talled the Ea l of  Dunbar  and the two Junior the Earl of  Montgomery  and so again  Car  I by the Earls of  Danby  and  Mo  eton  But lastly if the Sovereign be present and consequentl  the KnightsCompanions perform this Ceremon  then there  s generally so many of them as can go through the who  e without changing after the manner used when done by Commissioners or Assistants in which case the two Senior KnightsCompanions descend from their Stalls and p  ssing thro' the Choir to the ChapterHouse with the Procee  ing before th  m conduct to his Installation the eldest elect Knight and having performed that whole Ceremo  return and take their Stalls and so the rest in du  as was practised at the Installation of Prince  Hen    nd othe  s  Jac  I and of th  Earl of  Rutland    Jac  I and at the gr  nd  st of S    Geo  ge    C  r  II but here the separate  rocee  n  ith ea  h single Knight to and f  m the Chapter House taking too much time and the Day being  ar spent in the Ceremonies of the Dukes of  O  mond  and  Buck  ng  am  the Sovereign ordered that with the next P  oceed  g the rest of the elect Knights be  g eigh  besides two Pr  xies should all be introduced a  once so that each of them being placed before his S  took the Oath receiv'd his Invest  ure and was l  d up to his Stall and took Possession of it by solemn Instal  ation  And in regard so m  ny Knights elect were introduced together it was judged necessary that their Mantles and Collars should be likewise brought in the proceeding and each elect Knight appointed one of the Gentlemen that attended him to bear the Cushion whereon they were laid before him to the Choir Door where they held them in their Arms till Garter in due order fetch'd them into the Choir And here we may insert this general Rule that at all Installations where some of the elect Knights are not sent for unto the ChapterHouse to receive Investiture with the Surcoat before the Senior elect Knight hath been conducted to his Stall but left to repose themselves in the East Isle of the Chap  el as hath often happened th  Knights Commissioners or Assistants on their return to the ChapterHouse send Garter for the next Senior elect Knight whom they receive at the Door thereof and having invested him with his Surcoat and girt his Sword about him proceed with him to his Installation in the usual manner And the same method is observed if there were more elect Knights to follow and we find it  Henry  VIII and and  Car  I  The Knight or Knights having now receiv'd a compleat Installation the KnightsCommissioners Assistants  or KnightsCom  anions with marks of Respect take their leave of the last installed Knight and descending into the Choi  take their own Stalls but the Senior KnightCompanion ascends first But observe that if the S  alls of the KnightsCommissioners Assistants or KnightsCompanions be on the  ame side with the last installed Knight then they descend not into the Choir but  a  s directly to them along the Stalls as in the  Eliz  The Ceremonies of Installation being finished the Officers of Arms fi  st next the AlmsKnights descend from the Steps of the Altar and take their several S  ations in the Choir then one of the Prebends of the Coll  ge or if the Sovere  gn be present the Prelate with the S  j  a  t of the Vestry before him is conducted to the Al  ar by the Verger of the Chappel and there begins the S  r  e appointed by the Church which being ended the Proceeding passes out of the Choir in usual Order either to the PresenceChamber or the Lieutenants or Commi  sioners Lodgings as the Occasion is  The Offering of Gold and Silver  § But if the Installation be solemnized in the Morning the Service of the Church having proceeded as far as the Offertory two of the Prebends appointed to recieve the Offering are conducted to the Altar by their Verger and first the AlmsKnights then the Officers of Arms ascend the Steps of the Altar again and stand in order as before After which Garter Summons down the KnightsCompanions to the Offering who descend into the Choir under their proper Stalls as does the Sovereign's Lieutenant who offers fi  st for the Sovereign he re  eivi  g the Bezant from the Senior Knight and then retu  ns to h s Stal  And at this instant was the usual time heretofore for offering the Defunct Knights Atchievements w  ich was altered by King  James  I as will be seen hereafter  The Lieutenant after a short stay in his Stall descends again and proceeds up to the Altar to make his own Offering of Gold and Silver and then returns as do the rest of the KnightsCompanions includ  g those  ewly i  st  lled in their due order But when the Installation passes by Commissioners there is then no Offering made for the Sovereign but the Commissioners offer first and after them the other Knights in due order  The Ceremony of Offering at the Installation of  Philip  King of  C  stile    Henry  VII is remarkable He descend  d from his Stall into the Ch  ir and standing before i  as the other KnightsCompanions did the Sovereign left his Royal Stall to  roceed to the Offering to  hich the King would have followed but the Sovereign  uld not permit obliging the King to proceed along with him on his left Hand though he desired to perform his Duty as a Brother of the Order so that they made their Off  ring  o near together where though the Sovere  gn had the Precede  ce yet 'twas hardly ob  ervable  Of the grand Dinner at the Installation  § On the Day of Installation there hath from ancient Time been appointed a Noble and Sumptuous Feast  and though it was agreed on in a Chapter  Edward  VI  That the Knights elect might from thenceforth be installed by Commission without a Feast  yet after his Reign we find the old custom of a Feast at this Solemnity restored  If the Sovereign appoint the Installation to be when the Feast of St  George  is also celebrated and is himse  f personally present the Feast is then kept at the Sovereign's Charge and if in such case he constitute a Lieutenant then the Installation Dinner is kept at the Charge of the Lieutenant and is usually prepared in some of the Sovereign's Lodgings in the Castle but seldom in St  Geo  ge  's Ha  l as was done by the Earl of  Arundel  at the Installation of the Ear  of  Shrewsbury  and the Lord  Hunsdon    Eliz  But when the Installation is kept at any other time of the Year than that of St  George  's Feast then the new installed Knights are at all the Expence who generally have had the Dinner prepared in the Dean's Lodgings however be it where it will the Sovereign or his Lieutenant Commissioners or Assistants together with the new installed Knights proceed thither in full Robes which is observed in the Installation of  Eliz  above to be according to the ancient Custom At the Installation  Henry  VIII the Sovereign's Lieutenant walked alone after him his two Assistants and lastly the new installed Knights  The Lieutenant's Place at the Table is somewhat on the le  t Hand the Cloath of State there sat the Earl of  Arundel    Eliz  but the other four KnightsCompanions his two Assistants and the two new installed Knights  at toward the Table's End on both Sides for that they could not well sit all on a side But of late Years as at the Installation  Car  I a Question arose whether the Lieutenant or Commissioners should sit at Dinner in their Habits since the Power given them seemed to expire when the Knights were elected though unanimously allowed the new installed Knights ought to do so and likewise Precedents quoted as  Henry  VIII at the Installation of the Lord  Cromwell  where the K  ights put off their Habits and dined in their ordinary Apparel and so of the Earl of  Rutland  and the Lord  Cobham    E  iz  where the Commissioners did the same and the new installed Knights kept on only their Surcoats But what followed on this Debate is not mention'd but the general  Practice at other Times hath been of keeping on the Habit till the Dinner is ended  At the second Course called also second Mess or second Service Garter accompanied with the Officers of Arms Proclaims the Stiles and Ti  les of Honour of the Sovereign if he be personally or by his Lieutenant present in  Latin French  and  English  and cries Largess thrice next the Stiles of the new installed Knights in  French  or  English  only with two Largesses and in that Order they were installed And thus it was at the Installation of  Charles  Duke of  York    Jac  I of  Frederick  Prince Palatine  Jac  I and the Earl of  Rutland  and others  Jac  I  Philip  King of  Castile  Dined with the Sovereign in his PrivyChamber  Henry  VII whose Stile was Proclaimed by Garter not in the same Room but at the Sovereign's great ChamberDoor and in St  George  's  Hall  after Largess had been thrice cryed When the Sovereign constitutes a Lieutenant then is the Lieutenant's Stile also Proclaimed and to his other Honours is added this of his Lieutenancy and afterwards the Stiles of the new installed Knights as  Eliz  But the Order of this Ceremony is more particularly observed at the Installation of the Duke  de Montmorency  and others  Eliz  where fir  t Garter cried Largess and next Proclaimed the Sovereign's Stile c in three Languages then stepping two Foot back Proclaims the Lieutenant's Stile in  French  only with two Largesses and after that he cried one La  gess for the Duke and lastly for all the other new installed Knights only two Largesses and the Officers of Arms did the like and still as Garter had finished his Proc  amation the Heralds joined with him in crying Largess and so with Reverence departed the Hall  But lastly it is proper to observe that when neither the Sovereign nor his Lieutenant are present then the Sover  ign's Stile is not Proclaimed nor those of the Commissioners but only of the new installed Kn  ghts  As soon as Dinner is ended the KnightsCompanions rise from Table and w  thdraw to disrobe themselves and therewith the Solemnity of Installation ends And if at any time the Solemnity continues that Evening and the following Day it is only because the Sovereign or his Lieutenant is present on account of celebrating St  Geo  g  's Feast and not with reference to the Installation  Of setting up the Knight's Atchievements  § The last thing to be done at this great Solemnity is setting up the  Helm Crest Sword Banner  and  Plate  of the new installed Knight over his Stall in the Chappel of St  George  to which purpose they are to be provided according to the Directions before given  By the Statutes of Institution it is ordained that the time for setting up the Atchievements shall be when the elect Knight comes to  WindsorCastle  that is to his Installation and not before and the reason is there likewise given lest it should happen he not coming for his Installation within the time limitted and consequently the vacating his Election ensuing that a new Election being made those military Ensigns might not seem to be disgracefully withdrawn and an occasion of Dishonour given which otherwise could not be avoided if they should be suddenly taken down from a Place so high which demonstrates that the intention of this Article extends to the finishing the Ceremonies of Installation before the Atchievements ought to be set up by so carefully providing against the D  shonour of taking them down in case the Election should become void which must infallibly happen if the K  ight elect died but an Hour before he were compleatly installed Accordingly in the ancient Deputations both to Sir  William Philip  and Sir  John Falstaff  Power is given their Proctors first to demand receive and obtain their principal Stalls and next to tender their Helms and Swords to be hung up in the Choir of  Windsor  according to Custom And for clearer Information of the course of this Ceremony that the Sovereign impowered his Commissi  ers first to give the De  uty Poss  ssion of his Principal's Stall and after to receive the Atchievements and place them over it This is to be considered as a Memorial of the Knights being installed a Companion of the Order and 'tis incongruous in the Rules of Honour to have the Sign or a Memorial of an Action precede the Action it se  f  Again the Statutes expresly provide that the Kn  gh  s Atchievements shall not be hung up till the Du  es and Fees enjoined are first discharged and 'tis certain there  are no Fees due nor can be claimed till the Ceremonies on which they become due are entirely finished But to clear all Doubts which may arise upon this Point it was at a Chapter held at  WhiteHall  the fourth of  February    Car  II ordained  That not any of the Atchievements of an elect Knight's Stall be set up in the Chappel at  Windfor  before he be installed and the Fees of Installation paid  And though this was the Practice anciently yet were the Atchievements always prepared and brought to  Windsor  and set before the elect Knight's Stall and in case of his not coming to receive Installation then being no otherwise placed they might be the easier removed without the Choir in as decent manner as could be so that the Honour of Knighthood might be preserved entire nevertheless to be retained for publick Use and the Benefit of the College  Where mention is made in the Annals of any Person employed to set up the Atchievements of a Knight it is to be understood that he was his Proctor and installed on his behalf And there appears but one single Instance where one Person hath hung up a Knight's Atchievements when another was installed for him and this happen'd th of  August Anno    Hen  VI where the Lord  Rivers  having been elected to the Stall of the Lord  Hungerford  his Sword and Helm were soon after sent hung up by  William Bobden  his Esq and  Guyen Herald  and he installed the  October  following by Sir  William Crafford  his Proctor but this was contrary to the Law of the Order  Wh  re the setting up of a Knight's Atchievements is  ar  ly m  nt  oned without taking notice of the Installation i  i  to  e u  erstood that such Knight's Installation was a  o solem  z'd at that Time As in the case of the King of  Portugal  of whom the Annals only note that he had taken care to set over his Stall Helm Sword and Banner and a  l things belonging thereto at the Feast at  Windsor  Henry  VI In what manner these Atchievements are  ixed appears by the Statutes the Helm and C  est to  e set over each KnightCompanion's Stall and the Sword to hang directly under them but the Plate to be nailed to the back of the Knight's S  ll  CAP XIII The Installation of a KnightSubject by Proxy  The Original Cause of making Proxies  § THere was no liberty given at the Institution of the Order for a KnightSubject to be installed by his Proctor or Deputy but on the contrary in the Founder's Statutes was inserted this express Prohibition  That none of the Knights elect should be permitted to be installed by  Proxy  unless he were a Stranger  And this Law continued unaltered till the Reign of  Henry  V when  John  Duke of  Bedford  the Sovereign's Deputy for holding the Feast of St  George  at  Windsor    Henry  V and other the KnightsCompanions then present took it into Consideration that where a KnightSubject elected into the Order was at that Time employed beyond Sea in the Service of his Prince and likely to continue in that Service some time it was agreed that the said Duke should make an Address to the Sovereign by Letters under the Seal of the Order he being then employed in the War against  France  that in the like cases his Majesty would Ordain  That  KnightsSubjects  might as well as  Strangers  be admitted into the  Order  notwit  standing the Clause in the Statutes  It likewise appears from that  Letter  as well as from the BlueBook that Sir  John Grey  and the Lord  Bourchier  had been installed at the aforesaid Feast by their several Proxies which the Sovereign's Deputy concurr'd with out of great Respect to their Persons left by a too rigid Observance of the Statutes by their absence in the Wars where they were then loyally employed and might meet their Deaths they should want the desired Suffrages of those Masses ordained to be Sung for a defunct Knight as had happen'd to several by unsuspected delays But to clear this ma  ter for the future it was Decreed  Hen  V That where any elect Knight was  actually in the Sovereign's Wars or otherwise employed Abroad on his Sovereign's Affairs he should possess the Privilege of a Stranger in this particular which Decree was added to King  Henry  Vth's Statutes And it was so  n after enjoined the elect Knight on notice of his Election to take care timely to appoint his Proctor that he might enjoy the Rights and Privileges of a Founder Such an Obligation was laid on Sir  John Falstaff  who at the reception of the Garter was in  France  employed in the Sovereign's Service  But King  Henry  VIII besides his Confirmation of this Decree for allowance of a Proxy in the aforesaid two Cases farther enlarged it to such as the Sovereign should either Command or permit Licence to be installed by Proxy which is to be understood of Knights elect within the Kingdom as well as those beyond Sea By Virtue of which Clause the elect Knight the Earl of  Dorset  being Sick  Car  I obtained the Sovereign's Licence to be installed by his Deputy Sir  Richard Young  Letters of Procuration  § It is observed before out of the  Registrum Chartaceum  that Sir  John Robesart  elected into the Order by King  Henry  V was installed by Virtue of his Letter Missive sent to Sir  Thomas Barr  his Proxy but the same Register calls it in another Place a sufficient Procuration under his Seal of Arms enabling him to perform the Ceremony of his Installation  The Copy of this Instrument is not extant but that Letter Missive Sir  John Grey  directed to Sir  John Lisle  to take Possession of his Stall and by Virtue of which he was installed  tells him he had Chosen him for his Proxy and to take his Stall for him in his Name  c And omitting other Precedents doubtless in the ca  e of a KnightSubject the Sovereign may if he pleases nominate and appoint a Proxy for Installation where the elect Knight hath not done it himself for here all those Considerations of grand Respect Forms of the Oath c constantly afforded to Strangers have no Place which is evident from the Sovereign's Letters of Summons to the Comm  sioners named for Installation of the Lord  Grey  and  Phil  and  Mar  who at that time was Prisoner in  F  ance  and his Deputy Sir  Humphry Radcliffe  is therein mentioned to be appointed by the Sovereign herself  The first Precedent of Letters of Procuration or Depu  ation drawn into a solemn Form is that made by Sir  William Phelip    Hen  V by which having obtained the Sover  ign's Licence he impowers two Knights Sir  Andrew Butrely  and Sir  John Henington  or ei  her of them as their Business would p  rmit to supply his Place and take Possession of his Stall in the Choir at  Windsor  Qualifications of a Proxy  § The Q  alifications of a Proctor nominated by a KnightSubject are the same with those requisite in the P  octor of a Stranger  of which something will fall in our Way hereafter I shall therefore only in general obse  ve here that to neither KnightSubject nor Stranger the Pr  ctor is to be under the Degree of a Knight enobled with Arms and of an honest and untai  ted Reputati  n it being jadg'd proper chiefly in this Point that a KnightSubject shou  d ex  ctly observe the same Rule enjoined to Stra  gers in res  ect of which it is very remarkable that Sir  William Lisle  though one of the AlmsKnights yet in Degree a Knight was not refused to be P  octor to Sir  John Grey    Hen  V  Preparations for Installation  § The Day for Installation of a KnightSubject by Pr  xy bei  g appointed by the Sovereign there are to be provided for him fir  t a Commission for Installation whi  h by the Chancellor of the Order is presented to the Sovereign for his Sign Manual to which is after affixed the S  al of the Order And appoints  To conduct the Proctor to  Wind  orCastle  To put him in P    ession as from the Sove  eign of the Stall assigned his P  in  ipal To inve  him with all the Benefits Honours Prerogatives Franchises and Liberties thereto belongi  g To receive his Mantle Helm and Sword a  d  et them up in their appointed Places To add  thereto all usual Ceremonies Lastly an Injanction to all the Knights to permit all the Solemnity punctu  lly to be performed An ancient Precedent of this is found  Hen  V in the case of Sir  John Falstaff  Also  Edw  IV at the Installation of the Earl of  Worcester  a  d other elect Knights by their Proxies  Of later Times the Comm  ssions granted on such Occasions differ from those made for the Personal Installation of the Knights themselves only by premising the Cause of their Principal's Absence and Service he is then employed on authorizing the Commissioners to admit the Proxy into his Stall Likewise where the Installation is performed by two or more Commissioners the Sovereign dir  cts Letters to each of them giving notice of the intended Solemnity and requiri  g them to attend at a Day prefix  to the end the Proxy may be put into Possession of his Principal's Stall  And as there is upon adm  ssion of an elect Knight installed by Proxy the same ground for removal of Stalls as in personal Installations so the Sovereign issues out Warrants to  Garter  some time bef  re the Solemnity to remove the Atchievements and Plates as usual and place them in the Order such Warrants direct Anciently the Stall for an elect Knight was assigned in the Commission issued for Installation as in the case of Sir  Henry Ingh  use  Proctor to Sir  John Falstaff    Henry  V  The rest of the Particulars to be provided against the Day of Installation are at the Knight's own Charge and are agreeable with those in Personal Installations  Proceeding to the ChapterHouse  § The next thing to be consider'd is the Proxies Place in proceeding to the ChapterHouse and this is immediately after the Provincial  King of Arms  because as yet he hath not taken Possession of his Princi  al's Stall which done it gives him a Place in his return according to its Dignity In this Order the Proctors of the Marqu  s of  Newcastle  and the Earl of  Bristol  proceeded Bareheaded  Car  II  And though this be the Proctor's usual Place in this Proceeding yet Sir  Henry Sidney  Proctor to the Earl of  Warwick    Eliz  proceeded immediately before the elect Knights which is the only instance of that kind  Lastly the Proctor as in the case of an elect Knight passes into the EastIsle behin  the HighAltar as soon as he comes within St  George  's  Chappel  while the Sovereign Lieutenant or Comm  ssioners proceed into the ChapterHouse and there reposeth himself till he is sent for in as in the case of the Ma  quiss of  Newcastle  and Earl of  Bristol  above But if the Proxy pass not in the Proceeding he then goes priva  ely to his Place bef  re the Proceeding sets forward  Transactions in the Chapter House  § After the Cha  ter is opened the first thing done is for  Garter  to present the Commission or Commi  sions which he carried in the Proceeding thither as well that for the Lieutenancy if a Lieutenant held the Feast as of Installation for admitting a Pr  xy the Order of which is observed before  The Letters of Procuration or Deputation are next read after which the Proxy is s  nt for into the ChapterHouse by  Garter  who conducts him to the Door and there the Commissioners or A  si  ants or Knights Companions receive him But  Eliz  Sir  Henry Sidney  exhib  ted his Deputation after he was called in Or sometimes the Proxy produces his Dep  tation before the Proceeding to the ChapterHouse as Sir  George Howard  Deputy to the Earl of  Bedford  did  Eliz  And in su  h case there is no need of admitting the Proxy into the CharterHouse but that  e may stay without till the Sovereign his Lieu  enant or Commissioners are  ast into the Choir and he sent for thither at which time the  Mantle  was wont to be laid on his right Arm at  e ChapterHo  se Door by the KnightsCompanions a  pointed to introduce him  Anciently as soon as the Proxy was admitted into the Cha  terHouse and the Letters of Procuration were rea  the  Mantle  of his Principal was usually laid on his right Arm by the Sovereign's Lieutenant or Commissione  s and  ar  of it spread on the Proxies Shoulders the E  ut  eon of St  George  lying uppermost and the Cordons  laid fair to be seen and in this manner he bore it in the Pr  ceeding to the Stall where he held it till Service was ended but 'tis now ordered otherwise as by the directi  n of King  Charles  II that the  Mantle  should be born on the left Arm  But  Eliz  the Earl of  Wa  wick  's Proctor had the Mantle born before him into the Choir by  Ga  ter  in the same manner as is usual to Knights Personally installed and not delivered him till he had taken the Oath and at the delivery thereof the Words of Admonition were pronounced by the  Register  as it was observed to the Proxies of the Marquils of  Newcastle  and the Earl of  B  istol    Car  II  Proceeding to the Choir  § The Proxy proceeds from the ChapterH  use Door between the Sovereign's Commissioners c But touching the Order of this Proceeding so much has already been said that we shall give but one Instance  Anno    Elizabeth  Verger  AlmsKnights  Officers of Arms  Officers of the Order  Lord  Hunsdon  Proctor to the Lord  Cobham  Earl of  Bedford  Ceremonies performed in the Choir  § The Proceeding having entered the Choir the Commissioners c condu  t the Proxy into the lower Stall directly under that desig  d for his Principal where the  Register  reads the Words of the Oath while the Proxy laying his Hand on the Book repeats them after him and Kisses the Book And this Oath his Deputation impowers h  m to take in the Name of his Principal the Form of the Oath having no differe  ce from the Oath taken Personally by an elect Knight  The Oath being taken in this solemn manner the  roctor  led up to the Stall of his Principal where both  the Knights who conducted him into the Choir first take the  Mantle  and lay it on his Arm next laying their Hands on him in the Name of his Lord and Master from whom he received his Deputation set him down therein And so the Ceremony of Installation being fully ended the Service of the Church begins  If the Installation be performed in the Morning there is an Offering of Gold and Silver at which time the Proxy in his turn comes from his Principal's Stall and stands before it and when the Sovereign or the Lieutenant for him and for himself or else the Commissioners and the rest of the KnightsCompanions present have offered then the Proxy being joined to the Knight sitting in the opposite Stall if present at the Solemnity and having two Offic  rs of Arms before them proceeds to the High Altar and there offers both Gold and Silver and then returns and takes his Stall as the rest do In this manner the Earl of  Warwick  's Proxy joining with the Earl of  No  thumberland  installed at the same time proceeded to the Offering  Eliz  As likewise the Proctor to the Earl of  Bedford  with the Lord  Hunsdon    Eliz  The Ceremony of the Offering being finished the Service of the Church goes on which being over the Proceeding returns in the same Order it came to the  ChapterHouse  except that now the Proxy takes his Place according to the Dignity of his Stall But in regard the  Statutes  expresly declare That after the Proxy hath been a mitted to his Principal's Stall he shall neither wear the  M  tle  nor have any Voice in Chapter nor enter there in the absence of him that sent him so that it was the ancient Practice to take off the  Mantle  from his Arm at the  Chapte  House  Door in his return from the Choir and delivered to the  Verger  of the Chappel though sometimes to the  Sexton  at other times to  Garter  also to the  B  ackR  d  who hath taken it from off the Proxies Arm and carried it into the CharterHouse this do  e the Proxy ret  res pr  vately out of the Proceeding to his Lodging  I  appears however but by what indulgence is not me  tioned that though  Garter  took the  M  ntle  from Sir  Henry Sidney    E  iz  at the ChapterHouse Door on the Evening he retu  ned from Installation yet the next  Morning he rode in the Procession to the Chapel the Celebration of the Feast of St  George  continui  g with the  Mantle  or his right Arm and havi  g entered the Choir took his Principal's Stall beari  g  ikewise the Mantle in the grand Procession at the Offering of Money and during Divine S  rvice and from the Chappel to the Castle to Dinner And the like in th  Afternoon of the said Day he rode on Horseback in the Proceeding to the ChapterH  use Door but there the  Mantle  was taken from him  and laid within upon the Table whilst he retired into the EastIsle  f the Chappel and at the rising of the  Chapter  it was again delivered to him whence he proceeded in his Principa  's Place to the second Vespers  Next Morning the  Lieutenant  and  Assistants  having ended the Chapter the  Mantle  was again laid on his Arm and in that manner he pass  d to h  s Principal's Stall and afterwards offered as on the Feast Day The Morning Serv  ce ended the  Lieutenant  and  Assistants  returned to the ChapterHouse Do  r where they put off their  Mantles  and at the same time the  Sexton  of the College receiv'd the Mantle from him  The Grand Dinner  § At Dinner the Proxy  its with the Lieutenant or Co  missioners and takes Place where his Principal should  it if he were present and this was so observed at the Installation of the Earl of  Warwick    Eliz  The Stile of the Knight installed by Proxy is proclaimed in  French  or  English  in the usual F  rm and Place as  Hen  VIII at the Installations of the Earls of  Beaumont  and  Newblanke  by their Proxies for they w  e KnightSubjects though not to the Sovereign and there  ore not improper to be made u  e of as an Instance To c  nclude the P  octor is to take care that the Atchievements and P  ate of his Princi  al are  et up  n their proper Places which appears not only from the ancie  t Letters of Pr  cura  ion but also by Commissions of I  stallation which appoint that the Sove  eign's Deputy should receive from the Proctor his Principal's Helm and  Sword for there is no mention of the Banner till afterwards and place it over his Stall  CAP XIV The Signification of Election to Strangers  Within what time and in what manner Certificate is made of their Election  § IN regard that Strangers elect are for the most part Sovereign Princes whose Affairs obliged them to abide in their own Dominions and very rarely permitted them to receive Personal Installation it was thought fit to allow them several Privileges by the Founder of this most  Noble Order  and principally that of giving previous and timely Notice of their Elections and convenient time of consideration for Acceptance aff  rding Investiture in their own Countries and permitting their Installations to be performed at  Windsor  by their Proxies or Deputies  It was therefore by the  Statutes  ordained That when any such should be chosen into the  Order  they should be  ertified of their Elections by the Sovereign and besides that at his Charge the  Garter  should be sent over to them with the  Mantle  and  Statutes  of the  Order  Sealed with the common Seal so that they might have notice at…least within four Months from the time of Election to the  nd they might advise and determine with themselves fr  m the Tenor of the  Statutes  whether they would receive the Honour of this most  Noble Order  In Pursuance of these Directions it became cust  mary for the Sovereign when he sent his Letters to send also and that by way of solemn Embassy the Habit and Ensign  or the  Order  with a Book of the  Statutes  and in case the Election were accepted Investiture might be received before the r  turn of the Persons by whom the  Habit was sent As upon the E  ections of  Edward  King of  Portugal  at the Feast of St  George    Hen  VI the Duke of  Urbin    Edw  IV and several others  The right of bearing these Letters signifying Election and returning the Strangers Answer belongs to  Garter  by the Constitutions of his Office And though Certificate of Election was to be made within f  ur Months from the time of Election yet King  Henry  VIII added this necessary Clause  That when the Sovereign had any great or high Impediment he might defer certifying the Election till a more convenient Time  As may be seen in the case of  Frederick  III Emperor of  Germany  in the t  me of  Henry  VI who having been elected of that King had not Letters sent him to signify it till the next Year It likewise appears that Letters to the same Effect were then likewise dispatched to the King of  Arragon  the Duke of  Brunswick  and King of  Poland  who had been elected eight Years before  And yet we find it recorded that the  Habit  and  Ensigns  of the  Order  were sent by special Ambassadors to all three  Hen  VI two Years before But perhaps this ought to be understood of their being but then design'd  and ordered to be sent and on second Thoughts might  e stopped or if sent by some accident might have miscarried otherwise it seems needless to have sent other Letters to give notice of their Election two Years after But to clear this matter we after find a second mention of sending the  Habit  and  Ensigns  to the King of  Poland    Hen  VI by which it is demonstrable that the first Embassy took no Effect  It does not appear that King  Hen  VIII or any of his Successors ever made use of that Liberty granted by the aforesaid Article of his  Statutes  for deferring the significatory Letters of El  ction beyond the time appointed by t  e  Statutes  of Institution as we find by the many Instances of that kind  Francis  the first King of  F  ance  was elected  Oct  ber    Hen  VIII and was installed the  January  following so that 'tis plain the Letters of Noti  e must needs have been dispatched within the limited Tim    J  mes  V of  Scotland  who was elected  Jan    Hen  VIII had notice of Election immediately sent him and  Hen  II of  Franc    having been elected  April    Edw  VI had Letters of Signification sent him in  May  following and so in all Examples since And when King  Charles  II  elected any Stranger w  ilst he was Abroad Letters of Signification were sent them immediately after  Of notice given of an Election before sending the Habit  § Here it is to be observed with how much cautio  more than the former the Statutes of K  ng  Henry  VIII Ordain  to send Letters that signify Election and the Book of Statutes only at first  but not the  Garter  and  Mantle  till the  elect Stranger  having had time to consult the Statutes certifies his acceptance of the  Orde    and then and not before it is Decreed to send a solemn Embassy with the whole Habit  George  and  Collar  And consonant to this the Practice hath sometimes been As in the case of  Henry  II King of  France    Edw  VI  Em  nuel  Duke of  Savoy  and  Phil  and  Mar  and in that of  Frederick  Duke of  Wirtembergh  to whom Queen  Elizabeth  sent Letters soon after his Election and he returned Thanks and Acceptation by his two Ambassadors who received Promise of sending the whole Habit soon after however the same were not sent during h  Life  Notice of Election sent with the Habit  § When the Sovereign hath been well assured of the  elect Stranger's  acceptance  the same Embassy as anciently before adding this Clause dispatched both Ceremonies The Sovereign's Letter signifying E ection being first presented together with the Book of Statutes and an acc  ptance declared then within few Days the whole Habit of the  Order  was solemnly delivered  And thus it was directed soon after the Election of  James  V King of  Scots  to the Lord  William Howard  sent on that Embassy and in like manner at the Election of  Christian  IV King of  Denmark    Jac  I to the Earl of  Rutland  sent on that Embassy As also to  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  and  Henry  Prince of  Orange  within two Months their El  ctions following on  April    Car  I and the date of the Commission for delivering the Order being on  June  following  The manner and order of the delivery of these Letters signifying Election when the Habit is sent is thus  First The Ambassador and  Officer of Arms  having notice given them of the first Audience present themselves t  the  Stranger Prince  in the accustomed manner of Ambass  dors and delivering the Sovereign's  Letters Missive  with all due Reverence the Ambassador after some short general Compliment from the Sovereign signifying that his Master and the H  urable  Society  of the  Garter  in respect of his  nowned Prowess Valour Virtues c and to establish and encrease the Amity that is between them hath elected him into the most Noble  O  der  of St  George  a  d that So  ere  g  s do never e  ct any Strang  r but  uch as they highly Honour and therefore earnestly desires it may be accepted as a true Testimony thereof To which end the Sovereign hath sent him over and his Herald there present to p  rform the du  C  remonies  But this Commission of Legation hath sometimes been obstructed by the multitude of Aff  irs l  i  g on the Sovereign's Hands particularly in the Time o  Car  I when engaged in that unnatural Civil War so that when they sent their Letters of Sign  fication it was  fit to Commissionate their Agent or Resident at the Pri  ce's Court and  Ga  ter  Principal  King of Arms  to d  iver  art  ut the two chief and most p  uliar  E  signs  of the  O  der viz  the  Garter  an  George  deferring the s  lemn Em  ss  till a more convenient Season The first Pre  n  of which kind was  J  c  I when Si  Ralph  and  William Seagar  Esq  G  ter  were Commi  i  n  d to deliver onl  for the present the G  rter and Ge  rge to  Maurice  Prince of  O  ge  five Days after his Election and so to  Charles  Prince Palatine of the  Rhine    Car  I and to  William  Prince of  Orange  and the Duke  de Espernon  the same Reign And so likewise during the unhappy Exile of King  Charles  II it was usual for want of more conveniency to present the elect Knight in confirmation of his Election whether he were  Stranger  or  Subject  with the  Garter George Ribband  and sometimes a St  George  's  Cross  radicated within a  Garter  t  be fixed on the left Shoulder of their Cloaks or upper Garments But these things after returned into their proper Channel as we may see in several cases since of which we need not instance more than that of the present Sovereign and his Royal Highness the Prince The former at a Chapter of the most Noble  Order  he  d at  Kensington    June    Will  III was elected and on the  June  the Sovereign by Commission under the Great Seal of the  Order  constituted the Earl of  Macclesfield  and  Gregory King  Esq  Lancaster Herald  then Deputy Garter King of Arms to carry the  Habit  and  Ensigns  and to invest his then Electoral Highne  s therewith The next Day after their arrival at a private Audience his Electoral Highness received the  Garter  and  George  with the usual Formalities and two Days after  viz    August  was solemnly  nvested with the whole Habi  of the  Order  On  March  following he was installed at  Windsor  by his Proxy  Charles  Lord  Mohun  with the accustomed Ceremonies The same  Order  was observed at the Election of his Royal Highness the Prince  April  Queen  Anne  when the Lord  Halifax  and  John Vanbruge  Esq  Clarenceux  King of  Arms    n the room of Sir  Henry St John  Knight Garter were Commission'd to carry the  Habit  and  Ensigns  They had their first Audience on this occasion of the Prince the  May  who afterwards received the Garter and lesser George and on  June  following was invested with the whole  Habi  and  Ensigns  of the  Order  Certificates of Acceptation  § After delivering the Sovereign's Letter signifying Election by the Ambassador and the  elect Stranger  do  readily accept the  Order  he is obliged by the Statutes to r  turn the Sovereign a Certificate of such his Acceptance and desire of Ratification And 'tis observable before the additional Clause made by King  Henry  VIII this ceremonious Course had been the Practice of ancient Times and both expected from and observed by the King of  Denmark  who having been elected  Hen  V was the eighth of the same King taken notice of for not returning before that Time an Answer whether he accepted the Honour or no And it appears before the next Feast of St  George  he sent over his ready Acceptance both of the Honour of Election and of the Ensigns of the  Order  and thereupon Directions were given for his Installation by the Lord  Fitz Hugh  his Proxy  But for an instance after the said additional Clause there is one remarkable enough in the Preamble of the Sovereign's  Credential Letters  to the Duke of  Savoy  and  Phil  and  Mar  sent with the Habit and Ensigns of the  Order  in which it appears  That the Sovereign having given notice of his Election into this most Noble  Order  he had returned back his cheerful and ready Acceptance of and singular Satisfaction in the said Choice and therefore cordially wished it might attain its due Effect  In succeeding Times it was thought necessary where the whole  Habit  was sent to a  Stranger  together with the Sovereign's Letters of notice to make a provisional Decree which passed  Car  I  That Garter and all others whom  e pleased to join in Commission with him should be most punctually careful that they delivered not the  Ensigns  of the  Order  to any  elect Stranger  till they were satisfied by his  Letters Patent  of his kind and grateful Acceptance thereof  or in case of refusal to forbear their Presentation  And the same care was also taken where only the  a  ter  and  George  were sent as appears by the Instruc  ions  ent  Car  I to Sir  William Boswel  then appointed by the Sovereign to present those two principal Ensigns to  William  Prince of  Orange  where among other things he is expresly commanded  To take a Testim  nial from the said Prince of his kind Acceptation t  ereof before he should deliver those Ensigns of Honour to him  So likewise in the Institutions of the same Date for delivery  of the  Garter  and  George  to the Duke  de Espernon  Of an Election not accepted  § That sometimes this Honour hath not been accepted appears in the single case of  Philip  II Duke of  Burgundy  who having been elected by King  Henry  V then in  France  had not  Anno    Henry  VI sent his Answer It was therefore concluded on at the Feast of St  George  held at  Windsor  the said Year by  Humphry  Duke of  Gloucester  then Deputy to the Sovereign and by and with the unanimous consent of the  KnightsCompanions  present to send Letters to the said elect Duke by which he was desired to know whether he gave his Acceptance or no The Duke of  Burgundy  it seems made no Answer to this Letter It was therefore again debated at the next Year's Feast and then thought fit to send Persons over to him with the Nomination who should press him for his final Answer And then it appears that the said Duke weighing the Statutes and reflecting on the Quarrels between the Duke of  Gloucester  and the Duke of  Brabant  his Unckle made a plausible Excuse refusing the Election lest he should be forced e  ther dishonourably to violate the pious Constitutions of the  Order  or the obligations of Alliance and upon this they proceeded to a new E  ction  But this is the only instance of this kind and it hath been the constant way of all elect Strangers not only to accept but to receive with the highest Marks of Satisfaction the notice of their Election and the Inveititure of the  Order  CAP XV The Investiture of Strangers with the Habit and Ensigns of the Order  The Time for sending the Habit and Ensigns unlimitted  § THough the Statutes of the  Order  appoint and prefix a time wherein the Sovereign's Letters of notice to an elect Knight ought to be sent yet as to the sending a solemn Embassy with the Habit and Ensigns they do not limit any certain time but leave it wholly to the Sovereign's Pleasure wherein his own Interest and Conveniency as well as that of the  elect Stranger  is to be considered  Nevertheless the Statutes of Institution direct that this Legation shall be dispatched with convenient speed which must be interpreted to refer both to the Sovereign's conveniency of sending and the  Stranger's  capacity of receiving  And therefore we find it six Years after the Election of the Kings of  Arragon  and  Poland  and the Duke of  Brunswick  e'er we meet with the first notice of the Sovereign's determination of sending over the Habit For they having been elected  August    Hen  VI the preparations for the  Legation  were not made till the thirty fourth Year of the same King and doubtless some cause within the l  mi  s of that conveniency allowed to the Sovereign by the aforesaid Article of the  Statutes  or the accident of Miscarriage might fall out particularly in respect to the King of  Poland  because three Years after the former Order of  Legation  we find new Directions issued for sending the Ensigns of the  Order  to him  But in King  Henry  VIIIth's Body of  Statutes  this Clause of sending the Legation with convenient speed is wholly omitted and the Sovereign is not limitted as to the Time so that the Habit and Ensigns have happen'd to be sent sometimes sooner sometimes later as the Sovereign  has thought convenient of which sufficient hath been said already and we find in two Elections of  Strangers  in the two late Reigns  viz  that of the present Sovereign and Prince that the Legation was sent only a very few Days after their Election  Preparations made for the Legation  § In reference to this solemn Embassy there are several things to be provided before the Ambassadors or Commissioners take their Journey As Credential Letters Commission of Legation Warrants for the  Habit  and  Ensigns  And other Necessaries  The Credential Letters are as to particulars drawn suitable to the present Occasion by the  Chancellor  of the  Order  and directed to the  Stranger elect  but the Substance in general is  That the Sovereign having e  ected him into the Society of t  e  Order  hath sent his Ambassadors with full Power to present the  Habit  and perform the Ceremonies due and accustomed as if himself were present  And farther to desire him  To give Credit to all that his Ambassadors shall say or perform on his behalf in reference to their Commission as he would do to himself  These Letters pass under the Sign Manual of the Sovereign and Signet of the  Order  but it is observable that these to  Emanuel  Duke of  Savoy  were sign'd both by King  Philip  and Queen  Mary  The  Commission  of  Legation  is likewise to be pre  ared by the  Chancellor  of the  Order  fairly engrossed on V  lom and Sealed with the  Great Seal  of the  Order  the Substance of which for the most part hath been as follows  First The Merits and Worthiness of the  elect Stranger  to deserve the Honour of  Election  and the reasons of i  ducing the Sovereign to confer the same upon him are elegantly set forth  Secondly The Pers  ns nominated for this Honourable Employment are ordained authorized and deputed and therein Stiled Ambassadors Procurators and spec  al Messengers and so are acknowledged to be by the  S  r  ger el  ct  in their C  rtificates of the Receipt of the Habit  Thirdly Their Power Authority and special Command is to address themselves to the  Stranger elect  and present and deliver him from the Sovereign the  Garter Mantle  and other Ensigns of the Order Where observe that there were four or fi  e j  ined in a Commission as it has sometimes hap  ened then any f  e four three or two were of the Quorum whe  eof the Principal of the Embassy was always one  Fourthly They were impowered to require from the  Stranger elect  his Oath according to the Form prescri  ed in the  Statutes  but this was a special case and only inserted in the Commissions of Legation to  Charles  Duke of  Burgundy    Edw  IV and  Ferdinand  A  chdeacon of  Austria    Hen  VIII and omit  ed in all Commissions since that time  And lastly To perform and dispatch those things which they should judge necessary in the same mann  r as if the Sovereign were present in Person and this Power it was thought fit to allow the Ambassadors in case any thing should want to be performed which their Instructions had not sufficiently provided for  The first Embassy on this occasion recorded in the  BlueBook  is that to  Edward  King of  Portugal    Hen  VI to whom for the greater Dignity o  the  Order  G  rter was thought fit by the  Chapter  to be sent alone with the  Habit  of the  Order  And hence is the original of  Garter's  Claim to this Employment  Nevertheless in succeeding times as the Order grew into Esteem some one of the KnightsCompanions was made choice of by the Sovereign to be Principal in these Legations as were  Galliard Sieur de Duras  sent to  Charles  Duke of  Burgundy    Edw  IV  Arthur Plantagenet  Viscount  Lisle  to  Francis  the first King of  France    Hen  VIII and others  Sometimes other Noblemen or Persons of Quality though not KnightsCompanions yet c  rres  ondent to the Degree of the  Stranger elect  or to the Esteem the present Interest begat in the S  vereign were emplo  ed chief in these Embassies among whom Sir  Charles Somerse    after Earl of  Worcester  was sent to the Emperor  M  imilian    Hen  VII  Hen  y  Lord  Mo  ley  to  Don Ferdinand  Prince of  Spain    Hen  VIII and others  In Embassies of this nature it was heretofore usual to join some Persons of Rank and Quality or Office near the Sovereign in the Commission as Sir  John Scot  Comptroller of the Houshold and Sir  Thomas Vaughan  Treasurer of the Houshold both joined with the  Sieur de Duras  aforesaid And Sir  Nicholas Carew  and Sir  Anthony Brown  with the Visc  unt  Lisle  To these Persons the Sovereign thought  it sometimes to add a Doctor of the Law or a dignified Clergyman and such as had the Language of the Country not only the better to make such Answers to Questions as the  Stranger elect  might start on perusal of the  Statutes  but likewise to inform him touching the Institution of the  Order  or other Passages relating to the Founder or matters touching the Honour of the Garter Besides a dignified Clergyman was in those Times thought proper to Administer the Oath and pronounce the Words of Signification at the Investiture with the Habit and Ensigns of the  Order  And for these reason  was  John Russel  Doctor of the Civil Law and Archdeacon of  Berkshire  joined in Commission with the aforesaid  Sieur de Dura    and  Edward Lee  Doctor in Divinity Archdeacon of  Colchester  and the Sovereign's Almoner sent over with the Lord  Morley  and others  But of later Years the Sovereign's Ambassador Resident with the  Stranger elect  hath supplied this Place as did Sir  Thomas Smith  in the Legation sent over to  Charles  IX and Sir  Edward Stafford  in that of the  French  King  Henry  III and Sir  Anthony Mildmay  to that of  Henry  IV  Besides the aforementioned Persons  Garter  was always j  ined in these Commissions of Leg  tion not only to keep on Foot his Right but to manage the Ceremonious Part and of this there are so many numerous Instances as are sufficient to justify the Privilege of his Office and maintain the interest of an ancient Right Besides which if it were any way disputed we find it decreed in a  Chapter    Car  I  That the carrying the Ensigns of the O  der to  Stranger Princes  doth properly belong to  Garter  Besides those Persons joined in the Commission of Legation there has frequently been appointed either  Norroy  King of Arms or s  me one of the  Heralds  to go in Quality of an Attendant in this Service not only for the  Honour of the Sovereign but of the Stranger who is to receive the  Habit  in regard the Ceremonies of Investiture with the whole  Habit  require the Assistance of two Officers of Arms of which there are  me Precedents  Lancaster Herald  attended the E  bassy to  Charles  IX King of  France Chester Her  ld  and  Rouge Dragon  Pursuivant at Arms on that of  Henry  III of  France  A Herald likewise attended the Em  assy to  Emanuel  Duke of  Savoy York Herald  that of  Maximilian  the Emperor And  Somerset Herald  to  Henry  IV of  France  And whereas there went only  Norroy  to  Ch  istian  IV King of  Denmark  it was because no more of the Officers of Arms could then be spared from their necessary Attendance on the Sovereign's Coronation so in the Embassy to  Maurice  Prince of  Orange  one Herald sufficed because the  Garter  and  George  only were sent him and consequently there was but little Service then to be performed  Concerning other Companions and Attendan  s in these Legations they are both for Quality and Number such and so many as the chief in the Legation judges sufficient for the Honour of the Sovereign and the D  gnit  of the Embassy and with these have usually gone several Noblemen Knights and Gentlemen  In the third Place there is to be prepared for these Legations Warrants for the Habit and Ensigns of the  Order  and these are also to be drawn up by the Chancellor of the  Order  who is to attend the Sovereign for his Sign Manual thereto  One Warrant is to be directed to the Master of the  Great Wardrobe  to deliver to Garter the Mantle with the Escutcheon of St  George  within a Ga  ter embroidered on the left Shoulder and Tossels belonging and also the  Surcoat  and  Hood  There is also another Warrant drawn up for the delivery of the Ensigns of the  O  der  to  Garter viz  the r  ch  Garter  and great  Collar  of the  Order  with a George Pendant and another George ha  gi  g in a blue Ribbond together with Cases for them lined with purple Velvet and gilt on the outside  And sometimes these Ensigns have been delivered out of the  JewelHouse  to the Herald of Arms  oined in  he  egation in  Garter's  stead as were those sent to  Charles  King of  Sweden    Car  II but those provided for  John George  Duke of  Saxony  to Sir  Thomas Higgons  the Principal in the Legation for which they gave their several Receipts  The Sovereign's Warrant for the delivery of the Ensigns sent to  Maximilian  the Emperor was directed to the Lord Treasurer for which  Garter  gave his Receipt But for those sent to the  French  King  Henry  IV the Warrant was directed to the Master of the  JewelHouse  and out of this Office have all the  Ensigns  of the  Order  been since delivered  There are several other necessaries to be provided which may pass as Appurtenances to the former and are sometimes incerted in the Sovereign's Warrants for the Habit of the  Order  and at other times issued by particular Warrants As a black Velvet Cap with white Feathers and a Heron Sprig a Girdle and Hangers with the same coloured Velvet with the Surcoat A Yard of purple Velvet hath usually been allowed out of the  Great Wardrobe  for covering the Book of  Statutes  sent to the  elect Stranger  And for the Velom Writing and Binding the said Book there is a Fee paid by the Sovereign to the  Register  of the  Order  which hath generally been proportioned to the Dignity of the Receiver for this Officer had allowed h  m for the Book sent     l  s  d  To the  French  King  Henry  IV        To  John Casimir  Count Palatine        To the Duke of  Holstein    Jac  I        To the King of  Sweden    Car  I        But to be more particular we will insert the Bill of Charges for the Book of  Statutes  sent to  James  VI of  Scotland    Hen  VIII     l  s  d  For Velom        For illumining the Arms and Letters        For Writing        For Binding and Gilding        For half a Yard of purple Velvet        For half a Yard of crimson Sattin        For the purple Silk for the Laces        For the white and green Silk for the Seal        For red Silk for the Strings and garnishing the Book        For an Ounce and half of Venice Gold        For shap  ng making the Bag and garnishing        F  r red Sarcenet for lining the Bag        For a Box        Total        This Book of  Statutes  ought to be Sealed with the common Seal of the  Order  hich not only the Institution but all the other succeding Bodies of  Statutes  appoint Besides at a Chapter held at  W  iteHall    Car  I the Law was confirmed and thereupon it was again decreed T  t the Book of  Statutes  sent to any  Stranger Prince  should be Sealed with the Great Seal of the  Order  affixed to a Label of blue Silk and Gold  There is also to be provided a large purple Velvet Cushion to carry the Robes on when they are to be presented this is likewise put into the Sovereign's Wa  rant and provided by the Master of the  Great Wardrobe  usually containing one Yard and quarter in length adorned with Fringe Canl  and Tossels of Gold and purple Silk  and within it a P  llow of Fustian filled with Down  There were two Velvet Cushions prepared for the Service of the Duke of  Wirtembergh  's Investiture  Jac  I one of Purple for the Sovereign's State and another of Crimson for the Duke so the s  me Year to  Christian  IV King of  Denmark  Two  Majesty Escutcheons  are likewise to be provided  painted in  Oil  and gilt with Gold one to have the Arms of the Sovereign surrounded with a Gar  er under an Imperial Crown the other of the  Stranger's  Arms within a Garter also and such a Crown as is proper to his Dignity Both these are to be put in Frames painted and gilt with their several Stiles fairly Written under the Arms and set on the back of the Sovereign's Stall under the State as also on the back of the Stall of the  Stranger elect  But there were three  Majesty Escutcheons  sent over in the Legation to  Henry  Prince of  Orange  in regard that at his Investiture  Frederick  Elector Palatine was present  In case the chief Person in the Legation be a Knight of the  Order  then he is to have a like Escutcheon of his own Arms set over his own Stall for so had the Earl of  Derby  provided for him at the Sovereign's Charge when he was sent with the Habit to the  French  King  Henry  III  The remaining Necessaries are such as relate to the Transportation of the Habit of the  Order viz  One Pair of fine Holland Sheets to fold the Habit in  Two sweet Bags of Taffaty to lay amongst them  Two Trunks to put the said Parcels in  One Sumpter Saddle  All which are to be provided at the Sovereign's Charge and is also his Gift to the elect  Prince  What farther Warrants are to be obtained from the Sovereign relate to  Garter  and such other Officers of Arms as are appointed to attend the Legation as first a Warrant whereby the Sovereign ascertains a Warrant for their Diet and Reward during their Journey and till their return and on which most commonly for greater certain  y of its Payment the Sovereign's Privy Seal is obtained  The Allowance to  Garter  in the Reign of  Edw  VI was ten Shillings a Day for his Diet and Ten Shillings a Day more as a Reward And this we find allowed to Sir  Gilbert Dethick  in the Embassy to  Henry  II King of  France    Edw  VI and the like in his Legation to  Maximilian  the Emperor and to  Frederick  II King of  Denmark    E  iz  And when  Clarenceux  was sent in the Place of  Garter    he Office bei  g void by the Death of the said Sir  Gilbert  to the  French  King  Henry  III the same was also allowed him and commenced nine Days before his setting out and of which there are other Precedents  Of this daily Allowance  Garter  hath usually obtained an advance beforehand for his better support by the wa    When any of the Heralds were sent in  Garter's  Place the same Allowances were made them as if  Garter  had gone in Person as had  Henry St George  Esq  Richmond He  ald  sent with the Earl of  Carlisle  to  Charles  King of  Sweden    Car  I As also to  Thomas St George  Esq  Somerset Herald  sent with Sir  Thomas Higgins  to the Duke of  Saxony  soon after  As to the Allowance to such Officers of Arms as are not joined in but appointed to at  e  d any of these Legations it was usually if a Herald the Moie  of what was given to  Garter  And if a Pursuivant at A  ms half as much as a Herald  Agreeable to whi  h was the Allowance given to  Chester Herald  and  Ro  ge Dragon  P  rsuivant in the Embassy to  Henry  II King of  France    Edw  VI an  there called the  old Rate  so also to  Some  s  t Herald  to  F ederick  II King of  Denmark  and the  French  Kings  Henry  III and IV And both the Herald and Pursuivant had a so a proportionable part of their daily Allowances beforehand  Besides which Allowances men  ioned  Garter  hath also Allowance for Postage both Outward and Homeward for Himself and Servants and for Transportation of the Habit and other Things necessary for the Voyage And this by a Clause added in the Sovereign's Warrant is left to  Garter  at his return when he gives in a Bill of particulars subscribed with his Hand to the Treasurer or Chamberlains of the Exchequer to have been disbursed by him  The Warrant to furnish  Garter  or the  Herald  with Post Horses and convenient Shipping to carry them over is usually had of the Privy Council or Secretary  f State either before or after the Lord Ambassador and is not provided for in the same Ship  The Ceremonies of Investiture  § The Ceremonies performed at a Stranger Prince  s Receipt of the whole Habit and Ensigns of the O  der are highly Solemn whether we consider the manner of Investiture performed by the Sovereign's Ambassadors on the  Festivity  and  T  iumphs  added by the new invested Prince  First the Commissions joined in the Legation receiving notice of their first Audience are to present themselves in the accustomed manner of Ambassad  rs Gar  er or his Deputy going in breast wi  h the chief of the Legation  if there be only himself joined in Commission with the Lord Ambassador and in this Place  William Segar  Esq  Norroy  King of Arms sent in the room of  Garter  proceeded with the Earl of  Rutland  at their first Audience before  Christian  IV King of  Denmark  Being arrived near the  elect Stranger  they present the Letters certifying Election or their Credential Letters from the Sovereign and after some short general Compliment by the Ambassador he makes known to him his Election in the usual Form which is before sufficiently spoke of  After the Formality of this Address is over and that the Stranger hath by his Answer accepted of his Election and consented to the Reception of the  Order  the Ambassador immediately delivers him the Book of  Statutes  that he may if he pleases peruse them before he assume the Habit and desires his Consideration thereon Next both the Commissioners in the Legation present him with the  George  and  Ribbond  and put it about his Neck as in several Instances hath been shown  In the interim before the Day of Investiture Time is usually set apart for Conference between the Sovereign's Ambassador and some of the elect Prince's Council touching the ordering of the Ceremonies and wording the Oath to be by him taken  Garter  is likewise to consider what Places in the elect Prince's Court are fit to perform the Ceremony and to see them made ready and to instruct his Officers what Duties and Services they are to undertake  If the great Hall or other large Room be appointed there ought to be prepared a Table with a rich Carpet whereon the Habit and Ensigns of the  Order  are to be laid while the Sovereign's Commission of Legation is read another Table should be prepared for the Stranger who receives the  Order  and a third for the Sovereign's Ambassador  In the Church or Chappel where they are to proceed to he  r Divine Service a Stall is to be erected under a Cloth of State on the Right Hand Entrance of the Choir for the Sovereign of the  Order  wherein is to be fixed the  Majesty Escutcheon  of the Sovereign's Arms another Stall is also to be placed on the same side of the Choir for the invested Stranger at the same distance from the Sovereign's  Stall as is that for the elect Stranger in the Choir at  Windsor  in which is to be fixt the  Majesty Escutcheon  of his own Arms brought likewise over by  Garter  or his Deputy a third Stall is to be erected for the Lord Ambassador who if a  KnightCompanion  hath an  Escutcheon  of his own Arms within a  Garter  set over it for so had the Ma  quiss of  Northampton  at the Investiture of the  French  King  Henry  II  Anno    Edw  VI and the Earl of  Derby  at that of  Henry  III under all these  Escutcheons of A  ms  the Stiles and Titles fairly Written of the  Sovereign  and each  KnightCompanion  are to be affix'd  Where there is no solemn Proceeding to Church the Sovereign's  Escutcheon of Arms  with his Titles have been set up at the upper end of the Room where the Investiture is performed so also the Stranger Knight's at due distance as at the Investiture of  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  in his Tent at the  Leaguer  near  Darshaw  in  Prussia    September Anno    Car  I  Besides the beforementioned Preparations the  Church  or  Chappel  into which the new invested Stranger proceeds is to be richly adorned as we find by several Instances as at the Investiture of King  Henry  III when the Church of  Augustine Fryars  in  Paris  was hung with rich  Arras  and all the  Choir  and  Stalls  with  Cloth of Gold  On the Day the Solemnity of Investiture is celebrated the elect Stranger sends his Coach and some Persons of Quality to Accompany the Sovereign's Ambassadors to his Court At the Investiture of  Henry  Prince of  Orange Frederick  Prince Palatine of the  Rhine  sat with the Vi  count  Charleton  in one Boot of the Prince's Coach and Sir  William Segar  in the other and were met by the said Prince at the Foot of the Stairs of his Court and conducted thence into his great Chamber  After such time as the elect Stranger and the Sovereign's Ambassadors have a while retired the Stranger usually first enters the Room appointed for the Ceremony and stands under his own S  ate expecting the coming in of the Ambassadors and notice thereof being given them they reposing in a Room near proceed in manner following  Servants to the Lord Ambassador two and two  The Herald in his Coat of Arms bearing the Mantle Surcoat Hood and Cap in his Arms and if a  Pursuiva  t  attend the Embassy he wearing his Coat proceeds before him bearing part of the said Habit  Garter  vested in his rich Coat of his Sovereign's Arms also but at the Investiture of the Duke of  Wirtemberg  he wore his Robe of Crimson Satten as did  Clarence  x  at the Investiture of the  French  King  Henry  III bearing on a Cushion the  Garter  and  Collar  of the  Order  with the great  George  the Book of  Statutes  and the Commission of  Legation  Lastly The Lord Ambassador or chief in the Embassy who if a  KnightCompanion  proceedeth in his compleat Habit  If any other  KnightCompanion  is present he also wears his whole Habit of the  Order  as did the Constable of  France  at the Investiture of the  French  King  Henry  II The said Constable al  o pair'd in the Proceeding with the Sovereign's Ambassador  In going up to the Sovereign's State they all make three Reverences and drawi  g near the Ambassadors Servants fall off on either side for the  Herald  to pass up to the Table set before the Sovereign's State whereon with a single Reverence he lays the Robes  Then  Garter  draws near the Table also and with a like Reverence towards the Sovereign's State deposites the  Ensigns  of the  Order  The Lord Ambassador follows and makes his Reverence towards the Sovereign's State and after turning to the Stranger elect and doing him Reverence he or some other fit Person delivers himself in a short but grave and l  arned Oration  in which he not only sets forth the Prai  es of the illustrious  Order  and of the King the Sovereign but also the Virtues the memorable and praiseworthy Actions of the elect Stranger to whom the Habit and Ensigns of the  Order  are sent Ne  ther are his Ancestors if any of them have attain'd the Honour of this  Order  past over in Silence that thereby his Heart already breathing impatience and desire m  y be so much the more inflamed with an Earnestne  s to obtain the Honour and Favour of this so great a Dignity  He adds besides that the Sovereign having well weigh'd these and the like things in his Mind and maturely advis'd thereof with his  KnightsCompanions  they were perswaded and well satisfied in themselves to nominate and chuse him before others to the end that he might both himself be honoured by the Choice of such a Person and also thereby give an increase and addition of Lustre to those renowned Actions and Virtues which already were a chief Ornament to him  Lastly He points towards the  Ensigns  of the  Order  which he declares to have been sent by the Sovere  gn out of great Love and singular Affection to dignify him therewith as to a Person to whom he wish'd as well and honourably as to any other Prince whatsoever and withall intreats him kindly to accept thereof and wear them in remembrance of the Sovereign and his  Order  This or the like Oration being ended the Ambassadors present the  r Commission of  Legation  to the elect S  ranger who delivers it to his Secretary and he publickly Rea  s it  At the beforementioned Investiture of the  French  King  Henry  II the Bishop of  Ely  one of the Commissioners of the  Legation  made the Speech to which the Cardinal of  Lorrain  returned Answer in the said King's behalf with all thankful Acknowledgments of the Honour of the  Order  After the Commission is read  Garter  presents the Oath fairly Written which is administred to the elect Stranger where if any Exceptions were before made and admitted they must be rehears'd as we find it directed in the instructions given for the Investiture of  James  V King o  Scotland  The Ceremony of the Oath being finish'd  Garter  takes from off the Cushion the Garter and having k  ss'd it presents it to the Lord Ambassador who kneeling d  wn puts it with all Reverence on the Stranger's left Leg being assisted by  Garter  who pronounces these W  rds of  Signification  Ad laudem atque honorem Omnipotentis Dei inteme  ate Matris ejus Sancti Georgii Martyris cinge tibiam t  am hoc insigni Subligaculo ci  cumferens in augmentum honoris tui in signum ac memoriam illustrissimi O  dinis nusquam oblivioni daturus aut omissurus qu  d  o moneris ut valeas inquam v  lis in justo bello quod s  lum inibis stare firmiter agere fortiter felici  er omnino vincere  This being said  Garter  takes the  Surcoat  and with th  Ceremony of a Kiss delivers it to the Lord Ambassador who after the Stranger elect hath put off h  s Cloak or upper Garment and Sword puts it upon him in thi  manner First The Lord Ambassador begins at the Stranger's Right Arm and  Garter  or the  Leiger Ambassador  if present assists at the left Shoulder The Stranger being thus vested with the  Surcoat  both the Lord  Ambassador  and  Garter  gird his Sword about him with a Velvet Girdle of the same Colour at the doing whereof  Garter  saith these Words  Capito vestem hanc purpuream ad incrementum honoris in signaculum Ordinis accepti qua munitus non veteberis pro fide Christi libertate Ecclesiae pro jure oppressorum atque indigentium necessaria tuitione sanguin  m etiam fundere nedum fortiter ac strenue dimicare  After this  Garter  takes up the  Mantle  and  Hood  which in like manner kissing he delivers to the Lord Ambassador who invests the Stranger therewith and lays the Hood upon his right Shoulder the Train being given into the Hands of some Noble Personage to be born u    Garter  also pronouncing these Words  Accipe Clamidem hanc Coelici coloris in signum Clarissimi hujus Ordinis in Augmentum etiam h  noris tui  rubeo Clypeo Dominic  e crucis uti cernis insignitam u  cujus virtute semper ac vigore protectus per H  stes tutus abeas eos ubique superare valeas pro clarissimis denique Meritis post egregiam hanc hujus temporis Militiam ad aeterna vereque Triumphalia gaudia perting  s  Garter  in the last Place takes up the  Col  ar  and with a Kiss also presents it to the  Lord Ambassador  who  lace  h it about the Stranger's Shoulders and  Garter  uttereth these Words  Torquem hunc in Collo deferes ad augmentum honoris in signum quoque clarissimi ordinis a te suscepti cum imagine Sanctissimi Martyris Christi Militis Geo  gii  cujus praesidio suffultus Mundi hujus tam prospera quam adversa sic pertranseas ut anim  pariter ac corpo  is  ostibus hic strenue devictis non Temporari  modo Militi  gloriam sed perenis victori  palmam denique recipere valeas  Amen  When the Ceremony of Investiture is finished the  L  rd Ambassador  congratulateth the new invested Stranger in the  Sovereign's Name and in the Name of all the  KnightsCompanions  and then delivers him his Velvet Cap adorned with white Plumes and the Book of  Statutes  The Stranger being thus invested stayeth a while in the Room where he received this Honour with the Ambass  dor and after Complements of Congratulation between them he goeth to the Church in a solemn manner having the Train of his  Mantle  born up at the Entrance into the Church all in the Procession make three Reverences the first towards the  High Altar  the next towards the Sovereign's Stall and the third towards the new invested Stranger's Stall  The  Lord Ambassador  proceedeth towards the Seat assign'd for him and stands before it till the Stranger hath a  cended his Stall and after making his Reverences as before takes his then  Garter  making the like Reverences sits down on a Chair plac'd for him before the Sovereign's Stall  But the  Herald at Arms  ought to be often near the Stranger or else the  Lord Ambassador  to inform them of the  Order  of  Ceremony  because  Garter  is obliged to attend the Sovereign's Royal Stall  After a solemn Anthem  Garter  passeth in the middle of the  Choir  and by a Reverence first to the invested Stranger and next to the  Lord Ambassador  gives them the Signal for descending and being both come down  a ter  passeth up before the Stranger to the  High Altar  where he makes his Offering of Gold and Silver being accompanied with the  Lord Ambassador  the  Herald  laying the Cushion whereon he kneels when he Offers  But if a  KnightCompanion  be sent on this  Legation  then he proceeds first up to the  Altar  preceeded by  Garter  and Offers for the Sovereign which done he returns to his own Stall Next the invested Stranger proceeds up  receeded as before Offers and returns back to his own Stall afterwards the aforesaid  KnightCompanion  p  oce  ds up again and Offers for himself And in this  O  der  was the Offering made when the Emperor  Maximilian  was invested at  Vienna January    Anno    E  iz  The new invested Stranger having offered returns to his Stall and the  Lord Ambassador  with three Reverences takes his Seat the  Organs  c playing all the while  When the solemn Service is finish'd the Stranger descends again from his Stall and with the Proceeding before him returns in the same Order he came to the Room where he received his Investiture  It's observable that the Emperor  Maximilian  out of a compliance with the Protestant Religion caused on the Day of his Investiture all Prayers to Saints incensing and other Matters and Ceremonies not used by the Church of  England  to be wholly omitted at the Service in his Chappel  At these great Solemnities the invested Strangers have heretofore held most magnificent Feasts but of late they are not so much in Use And when Dinner was ready they proceeded thither in their whole Habit which they wore all Dinner time  At the Investiture of  Christian  IV King of  Denmark Anno    Jac  I the Sovereign's Stiles and Titles of Honour were proclaimed thrice before they sat down to Dinner and the said King's twice but when  Maurice  and  Henry  Princes of  Orange  received Investiture the Stiles were proclaimed immediately after they were invested and in the same Room the Ceremony being perform'd to both in the Afternoon  At the Feast made by  Maximilian  I King of the  Romans  Sir  Charles Somerset  and Sir  Thomas W  iothesley  sent on the Embassy was admitted to his Table and sat on his left Hand On the Day of Investiture of  Don Ferdinand  Prince of  Spain  ArchDuke of  Austria  the Lord  Morley  and Sir  William Hussey  sat on his right Hand at Dinner and Dr  Lee  and the said Sir  Thomas Wriothe  ey  on his left these four being join'd in the Commission of  Legation  At a Feast on the like Occasion by the  French  King  Henry  II he admitted to his Table beside the Marqui  of  Northampton  the principal Person in the  Legation  the beforementioned Constable of  France  and all three  at in their full Robes of the  Garter  which they put not off till after Dinner The Cardinal of  Lorrain  sat also at the King's Table but it was on the other side  When the Investiture was performed in the Afternoon then was the Grand Dinner turn'd into a Supper as it was at the Investiture of  Maximilian  the Emperor and two of the  French  Kings but when  Henry  Prince of  Orange  receiv'd the  Ensigns  of the  Order  there was no Feast at all but purposely omitted to prevent the difference which might have been occasioned by the Precedency and Place between Ambassadors drinking of Healths and other Complements  On this Solemnity and the Honour they deriv'd from it some have thought fit to transmit the Memory to Posterity by Medals with Inscriptions relating thereto such were those of Gold and Silver which  Frederick  Duke of  Wirtemberg  caused to be made as also those made by  Charles  King of  Sweden  Certificates of having receiv'd the  Habits  and  Ensigns  of the  Order  § The magnificent Solemnity of Investiture c being compleatly finish'd and the Ambass  dors having fully performed their Duties therein they are yet further to obtain from the new invested Stranger before their departure a publick Instrument testifying the reception of the said Habit and Ensigns Sign'd with his Hand and Sealed with his Great Seal this we find anciently done in several Instances and is generally demanded and obtain'd  Hereupon a Clause to this Effect is usually added in Instructions given to Ambassadors as appears from those to the Lord  Howard  and  Garter  in the Embassy to  James  V King of  Scotland  namely that  Garter should  emember  after the Investiture was performed  to Purchase and Sollicit a Certificate from the said King of his reception of the Order and taking the Oath both under his Seal  The Form and Substance of these Certificates are much alike for after a reci  al of all the Powers given to the Ambassadors nam'd in the Commission of  Legation  the Stranger Prince first makes Certificate of his receiving and Investiture with the  Mantle Surcoat Collar  and other Ornaments of the  Order  and that they receiv'd them from the Sovereign's Ambassador with the accustom'd Solemnities  In some of these Certificates namely from  Ferdinand  Prince of  Spain Anno    Hen  VIII from  Francis  I  the  French  King  Anno    Hen  VIII and from  Gustavus  King of  Sweden Anno    Car  I we find the taking the Oath appointed by the Statutes to be also certified Of the return of these Certificates the Annals of the  Order  sometimes take notice and by a Decree  Car  I care was taken to oblige the Ambassadors to produce these Certificates to the Sovereign at their return  The Stranger Prince hath been pleas'd sometimes to give with the Certificate a particular Testimonial of  Garter  's punctual discharge of his Duty in the  Legation  or of the Officer of Arms employed in his stead as did  Gustavus  King of  Sweden  in the preamble of his  Diploma  whereby he testifies the bestowing upon  Henry St George Richmond Herald  the Honour of Knighthood they have also usually given  Garter  Gratuities either in Money Diamonds or some other Present of great value of which several Instances might be produced  CAP XVI The Installation of a Stranger by Proxy  Touching the Choice and Nomination of a Proxy  § AFter the Stranger is invested he is enjoin'd by the Statutes be he of what State or Condition soever to send in eight Months after his Investiture either a  Proctor  or  Deputy  to be installed in his behalf in the Seat assign'd him within the Chappel of St  George  at  Windsor  The Time limited for send  ng in  Henry  Vth's Statutes is but seven Months and those of  Henry  VIII allow no more and that not only after Investiture but after the Stranger hath certified the Sovereign of his reception of the  Order  By King  Henry  VIIIth's Statutes it's also provided  That in case a Stranger do not send his  Deputy  or  Proct  r  within seven Months  wit  out having a reasonable Excuse and such  s should be allowed by the Sovereign or his D  put    the Election  notwithstanding his former Acceptation  should be also void except so it be that the Stranger be hindred or disturbed by great Affairs and then might he send his Excuse to the S  vereign or his Deputy within one Month after and according as the Sovereign or his Deputy should allow or disallow of his Excuse that then the Sovereign or his Deputy might give unto him four Months of respite more within which time if he neither come nor send his Deputy to be installed for him then the said Election should be void for that time  The  French  King  Francis  I was so earnest for compleating this Honour that he dispatch  d his Proctor hither with all the speed he c  uld and most of the Stranger Princes have sent their  Deputies  within the limited time there being very few Instances to the contrary and those were occasioned through the multiplicity of Affairs  When the  Garter  and  George  only have been sent to a Stranger the Ceremony of In  tallation hath been dispenc'd with till a more convenient time as appears from the Instructions of  March    Anno    Car  I given at the sending these two principal  Ensigns  of the  Order  to  William  Prince of  O  ange  a  d  Be  nard de Foix  Duke  d'Espe  non  in regard of the Interruptions then given by the Rebellion here such dispensations and for the same reason was King  Charles  II necessitated to give those S  rangers whom he honoured with Election while he remain'd in Foreign Parts  Upon the said King's happy Restauration among many other things relating to the  Order  this particular was taken into consideration in reference not only to the Duke  de Espernon  and Prince  Maurice  who were dead but those Strangers also then living and at two  Chapters  held at  WhiteHall Anno    Car  II directions were given to  Garter  to place the  Banners  and  Atchievements  of the surviving Strangers over their respective Stalls and the Sovereign by his supream Power  nd  c'd by the impossibilities of the late Troubles to pe  form the Installation and by reason of the time elaps'd si  ce their Elections di  penc'd wholly and absolutel  with their Installa  ions but at the same time declar'd that as the like necessity and conjuncture could never happen again so he would not on any motion or pretence whatsoever give the like dis  ensation  It seems to rest in the pleasure of the Stranger whether he will chuse to send over any Person of his own Court or give his Procuration to some one of the Sovereign's S  bjects to receive his Stall and in his Name to take Poss  ssion of it the latter of which hath been done several times out of desire to favour some of our Nobi  ity with this Honour of which many instances might be given  It ha  h sometimes happned that a  Proctor  for the Installation of a Stranger hath been appointed and nominated by the Sovereign of the  Order  though the Principal had nam'd another before Thus it fell out in the case of  Maurice  Prince of  Orange Anno    Jac  I who having deputed Count  Henry  his Brother to be installed for him and he having put to Sea in Order thereto but by reason of contrary Winds not arriving in  England  before the Day appointed for his Installation the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  ordered that  Lodowick  of  Nassau  Kinsman to the elect Prince should take Possession of his Stall on his behalf A case somewhat like was that of  John George  Duke of  Saxony  who sent over his Procuration to  John  Earl of  Bath  and he being detained in the West on extraordinary Occasions when St  George  's F  ast was held at  Windsor Anno    Car  II wrote to the  Chanc  llor  of the  Order  to obtain the Sovereign's Dispensation for not appearing in the Name of his Principal who representing his humble request to the Sovere  gn in a  Chapter  held on the Eve of the said Feast he was p  eas'd to grant it and appointed  Heneage  Earl of  Winchelsea  who perform'd the Service There is also an ancient Example of this kind  Anno    Hen  V where the Sovereign n minated the Lord  Fitz Hugh Proct  r  for the King of  Denmark  which  et was not done till after the Sovereign had been certified that the sai  King had been  vested and obliged himself by Oath to the observation of the  Statutes  In like manner it is recorded that the Earl of  Cleveland  was by the Sovereign appointed Deputy for the Installat  on of  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  and yet not unlike but this might be with con  ent of the said King tho  gh the Annals herein are silent  The Proctor's Qualifications  § By the Statutes of the  Order  the  Proctor  whether he be nominated by his Pri  cipal or by the Sovereign must be  Procurator sufficiens Idoneas  that is such a Person who hath always been accounted of unblameable Conversation n  t branded with any note of Infamy but altogether irreprovable And such was  Dominicus Franciscus Deputy  to  Charles  Duke of  Ferrara  who in the  BlackBook  of the  Order  is characterized to be a Knight of incorrupt Fame nor are we to doubt but that other  Proctors  to Strangers were such though the Testimonials of their Virtues do not appear in the Annals of the  Order  Secondly The  Proctor  ought to be a Person correspondent to the State and Dignity of the Stranger that is invested which may sufficiently ap  ear by several Instances the Emperor  Maximilian  I appointed for his Proxy the Marquiss of  Brandenburgh Anno    Hen  VII  Francis  I King of  France Adrian de Fercelin  Lord of  Bross Anno    Hen  VIII and  Henry  IV of  France Si  ur de Chastes  Vice Admiral of  France Anno    Eliz  Thirdly It is provided that he be a Knight and without any manner of Re  roach and if it so happen that he have not receiv'd the degree of Knighthood the Sovereign is to bestow that Honour before he be allow'd to take upon him the Execution of his deputative Power for none but Knights are capable of this Honour or permitted to bear the  Ensigns  of so great an  Order  Hereupon the Lord  Willoughby  of  Eresby Proctor  for  Frederick  II King of  Denmark  was Knighted by  he S  vere  gn the Morning before he proceeded to take Possession of  he Stall  There was one reason no  wi  h  anding why this pa  ticular was not strictly stood upon  hough moved in the case and it's the  ingle ca  e of  Henry Rame    Hereditary Lord of  Wosterwitz  and  B  ckeskaw D  put  for  Christian  IV King of  Denmark Anno    Jac  I for it being taken notice of that he was not a Knight cer  ain Persons were sent from the Sover  gn to  gni  y his P  asure that he should be a  anc'd to the Honour o  Knighthood  before he took upon him the  Ensigns  of the  Order  in his King's behalf to which he made Answer that he appeared here not in his own but in the Name of the King of  Denmark  and that such a degree of Honour was unusual in his own Country being Born in  Pomerania  and therefore humbly desired that he might be excus'd from the Honour upon which the Sovereign was pleas'd to dispence with him and forthwith the said  Deputy  but no Knight was admitted to take the Stall assign'd to the said King his Principal  His Letters of Procuration  § The Authority wherewith an elect Stranger invests his Proxy which ought to pass under his Hand and Seal do generally contain these Particulars  First He premiseth the Sovere  gn's Election of him into the Order of the  Garter  and his receipt of the Habi  and Ensigns thereof then takes notice of the Obligation the  Statutes  of the Order put upon him for sending a Proxy to take Possession of his Stall in regard the Dignity whereunto he is advanc  d in his own Country will not permit him to repair Personally to  Windsor  and being not only desirous that the Election and Investi  u  e should obtain its due effect but to fulfil as far as in him lies the Injunctions of the  Statutes  in what concerns the assuming of his Stall and taking the Oath appointed he therefore Ordains Authorises and Deputes a Person  itly qualified named in the Deputation his sufficien  Proctor  and special  Deputy  to appear at the Castle of  Windsor  in his behalf and in his Name at the next Solemn  ty that shou  d be held there to supp  y h  s room and receive P  ssession of the Stall assign'd him according to the usual Form and in all res  ects to  erfo  m those Ceremonies and Thing  in his behalf due and  o  hould a  pear to belong any way to the Sp  endor or Or  ament of the Order As also to take the accustomed Oath with those Qualifications and in that Form as had been or should be agreed on and further to fulfil  ll other things which he should think necessary to be perform'd on thi  Occasion or whatsoever thing might requ  e a more special Command than was contain'd in the Lette  s  of Procuration and as fully as the Stranger should be obliged to and would do if he were there present in his own Person Lastly there is usually added a Clause of Ratification and Confirmation of all such things as the  Proctor  should say or do in reference to the Solemnity of Installation  Of the Proctor  's  Reception  § When the Sovereign is acquainted with the arrival of the Proxy and the occasion of his coming he soon after gives him Audience after which a Day for Installation is assign'd and the Sovereign nominates some of the  KnightsCompanions  his Commissioners to perform the Ceremonies  The  Proctor  heretofore has been receiv'd with very great State Sir  B  lthasar Castilian  sent hither from the Duke of  Urbin Anno    Hen  VII was met at the Seaside by Sir  Thomas Brandon  with a goodly Com  any of his own Servants well Hors'd who kept Company with him till they came near  Dep  ford  in  Kent  where by the Sovereign's Command he was met by Sir  Th  mas Dokara  and Sir  Thomas Wriothesler Garter  The said Sir  Thomas Dokara  had attending him thirty of his Servants all in new Liveries well Hors'd every Gentleman bearing a Javelin in his Hand and every Ycoman a Bow and a Sheaf of Arrows and so they convey'd him to his Lodging The next Day they conducted him to  Lond  n  and by the way there met him divers  Italians  and  Paulus de Gygeles  the Pope's Vice Collector to whose House he was convey'd and lodg'd The reception also of  James  Lord  Rambovillet  Proctor for the  French  King  Cha  les  IX was very noble  The Preparations for Installation  § The Preparations of the Installation of a  by Proxy are the same as for the Proxy o  a  Subject  mention'd as before and the Form of the  mission for Installation is much the same the  ains the Authority wherewith the Proxy is impower'd and is penn'd with like Words  The Letters of notice to the Commissioners  The Warrants for removing of Stalls and for the Strangers Atchievements are all to be obtain'd by the Chancellor of the Order under the Sovereign's Sign Manual to which the Signet of the Order is to be affixt  The Strangers Atchievements as mention'd in the Warrant are to be provided at the Sovereign's Charge namely his  Helm Crest Mantlings  and  Sword  together with a  Banner  of his  Arms  and  Quarterings  and these the Proctor is enjoin'd to bring along with him to  Windsor  Sometimes a Warrant hath been directed to the Master of the  Wardrobe  to provide but some part of these A  chievements and another Warrant to the Lord Treasurer of  England  to deliver  Garter  Money to provide the other part in each of which the particulars relating to either are enumerated for  o were the Warrants drawn up for the Atchieveme  ts of the  French  King  Henry  II At other times direction hath been to the Master of the  Wardrobe  to deliver to  Garter  the whole who thereupon puts the Charge upon Account  Sometimes particular Warrants have been directed to the Master of the  Wardrobe  to deliver several Parcels of the Materials for the making up these Atchievements as were those Warrants to deliver the Sovereign's Embroiderer and to  Garter  so much Velvet Cloth of Gold c for making the great Banner and other the Atchievements of  C  arles  IX and  Henry  III  French  Kings  It also appears that  Garter  hath sometimes laid out the Money for all or part of the Atchievements and then delivered his Bill of disbursements into the  Wardrobe  as is manifest from those Bills for the Atchievements of  Frederick  II King of  Denmark  in Count Palatine of the  Rhine  and the Duke of  Holstein  Besides the Atchievements some other things used at the Solemnity are commonly included in the forelaid Warrants the  Mantle  of the  Order  is not prepared at the Sovereign's Charge for the Statutes of Insti  ution appoint the P  oxy to bring one with him not that the Sovereign shou  d provide it having done that before at the Legation with the whole  Habit  nor is it found in the Rolls or Books of the Sovereign's great  Wardrobe  that any Account  is made for providing a second  Mantle  when the Proxy of a Stranger came hither which had the Sovereign been at such Charge would not have been omitted  The Proctor  's  Cavalcade to  Windsor  § The Day appointed for the Installation drawing on the Proxy was heretofore accompanied from  London  to  Windsor  with the Sovereign's Lieutenant and his Assistants if the Feast of St  George  was then also celebrated or otherwise the Sovereign's Commissioners with a great Retinue  Among the rest when the Deputy of the  French  King  Francis  I rode to  Windsor Anno    Hen  VIII all the  KnightsCompanions  that were in Commission for that Solemnity assembled at the Lord  Sandy  's Place near St  Paul  's Church in  London  whence they rode to the  Deputy's  Lodging and thence accompanied him with a gallant Equipage to the Castle of  Windsor  where Lodgings were prepared for him at the  Dean's  House  In like manner  Anno    Eliz  the Earls of  Sussex  and  Leicester  and Lord  Clinton  three of the four Commissioners appointed for the Installation of the  French  King  Charles  IX with other Lords and Gentlemen took their Horses at the Court Gate at  Westminster  and with a great Train rode to the Lodgings of the said King's Proxy being then at St  Mary  's  Spittle  in  London  whence they went through  Holbourn  towards  Windsor  the Earl of  Southampton  Viscount  Mountague  Sir  Henry Le    and Sir  Edward Umpton  met them at  Langford  near  Colbrook  with their Hawks and shew'd the Proxy variety of sport with which he being well pleased they rode to his Lodgings at the  Dean's  House at  Windsor  the usual Place of entertaining the Strangers Proxies  Supper after his Arrival there  § The Evening of their arrival passeth with a sumptuous Supper but the principal Entertainment is reserv'd for the following Day's Dinner At the Installation of the  French  King  Francis  I all the Commissioners met together  at the Marquiss of  Exeter  's Lodgings and went to the  Dean's  House where they were entertain'd by him at Supper all at one Table at another Table sat  Garter  with certain of the  Deputy's  chief Gentlemen and some of the  Heralds  and at a third sat the rest of the  Heralds  and other of the  Proxies  Servants  The Commissioners and other Noblemen who accompanied the  Proctor  of  Charles  IX to  Windsor  supped also with him at the  Dean's  He himself sitting at the upperend of the Table then the Earls of  Sussex  and  Leicester  by him one against the other next the Earl of  Southampton  and Viscount  Mountague  then the Lord  Clinton  and Lord  Herbert  of  Cardiff  after them two Strangers of distinction then lower sat the Lord  Grey  and other Strangers and last of all at the lower end opposite to the  Proct  r  sat  Monsieur Dose alias  St  Michael  the  French Hera  d Garter BlackRod  and divers Strangers supped with the  Dean  and in the Parlour and Hall sat divers Pensioners Gentlemen and Strangers  Of the Proceeding to the  ChapterHouse  § What hath been before set down of the Proceeding to the  ChapterHouse  at the personal Installation of a  KnightSubject  will extend hither both as to Order and Circumstances yet this general Rule is to be born in m  nd that the Place of a Stranger Prince's Proctor here is next after the Provincial King's unless the Proctor of a  KnightSubject  happen to intervene and before the Jun  or  KnightCompanion  unless a  KnightSubject  pass then in the Proceeding of which we have an Instance at the Installation of the Dukes of  Brunswick  and  Chevereux  and the Earl of  Dorset  by their Proctors but the Earls of  Salisbury Carlisle  and  Holland  with Viscount  Andover  in Person  Anno  Car  I when the Proceeding was ordered as followeth  Two Waiters of the Sovereign's Hall in their Livery Coats bearing White Rods  A  msKnights  Pr  bends of the College  Offi  ers of Arms  Proctors to the absent elect Knights  Elect Knights in Person  KnightsCompanions  BlackRod  Register  Garter  Chancellor  Prelate  Sovereign's Lieutenant  Courtiers and Gentlemen in the Rear  Only in the single case of  Christan  IV King of  Denmark Anno    Jac  I as an extraordinary Respect and Honour his Proxy went in the Proceeding to the  ChapterHouse  next before the Sovereign's Lieutenant  As we had a former Example of a Proctor to a  KnightSubject  who in this Pr  ceeding past before the  AlmsKnights  and Officers of Arms namely Sir  Henry Sidney Deputy  to the Earl of  Warwick    Eliz  so here in the case of a  Stranger  the Viscount  Hereford  Proxy to the Duke of  Holstein  installed  Eliz  went in this Proceeding to the  ChapterHouse  before the Officers of A  ms Which Proceeding was ordered as follows  Gentlemen and Knights  The Proctor and Ambassador of  Holstein  together  Officers of Arms  Register and Garter  Lord  Hastings  and Lord  Paget  Commissioners  If the Proxy of a Stranger pass in the Proceeding which the Sovereign his L  eutenant or Commissioners make to the  ChapterHouse  then for the most part he gives his Attendance in the  PresenceChamber  or in the Room whence the Li  utenant or Commissioners proceed and th  re joins himself thereto  But sometimes the Commissioners as an instance of  g  lar Respect after the  r setting out have taken the Proxies Lodging in their way and there receiv'd him into the Proceeding so did Prince  Henry  by the Proctor of  Christian  IV King of  Denmark  and the Commissi  n  rs by the Proctor of the Duke of  Wirtembergh    Jac  I  'Tis observed that the Proxies of Strangers have not always gone in the Proceeding but sometimes staid at their Lodging till the Commissioners were ready to send for them to the  ChapterHouse  As at the Installation of  Charles  IX King of  France    Eliz  the Commissioners meeting they and the three inferior Officers of the Order robed themselves and then went to the Proxies Lodging and having just conferr'd with him took leave and proceeded to the  ChapterHouse  whence they  ent out  Garter  to the Proxy with invitation to come to them who was presently conducted by  Garter  to the  ChapterHouse  Door where the two Senior Commissioners receiv'd him between them  Sometimes the Proxies have past privately to the EastIsle of St  George  's Chappel and there rested before the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  went into the  ChapterHous    or proceeded into the Choir without entering thereinto for so did the Earl of  Cleveland  and the Ma  quiss of  Dorset  Proxies to  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  and  Henry  Prince of  Orange    Car  I The like Method was observed by the Ea  l of  Dover  Proxy to  C  arles  Prince Palatine  Car  I and by Sir  George Cartaret  Proxy to  Christian  Prince of  Denmark    Car  II so also of the Earls of  Carlisle  and  Winchelsea  P  ox  es to  Charles  King of  Sweden  and  John George  Prince Electo  of  Saxony    Car  II  The Ceremonies perform'd therein  § When the Proceeding hath arrived at the  ChapterHouse  Door the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  or the Li  utenant c with the Officers of the  Order  before  hem enter to hold their Consultation the Stranger's  Proxy  being first requested to stay without t  ll his Deputation or Letters of Procuration are read to the end they may understand the effect thereof  To this purpose we find it directed by an ancient Hand that where any Knight is installed by his Deputy he ough  to stay without the Vestry or  ChapterHouse  Door t  ll he be introduced by two  KnightsCompanions  So the Lord  Paget  one of the Commissioners for Installation o  th  Duke of  Savoy  when the Proceeding was come to the  ChapterHouse  Door acquainted his  Proxy  with this Custom and Injunction which he complied with  The EastIsle behind the High Altar is the usual Place for  Proxies  to stay till they are called into the  Chapter  as it is also for the  Deputies  of  KnightsSubjects  where Chairs and Cushions are prepared for this occasion  The first thing done after the  Chapter  is opened is reading the Commission for  Installation  by the  Register  of the  Order  but if the Sovereign be present no  ommission issues and next the Letters of Procuration this being the most usual and proper Place for this Ceremony  However at the  Installation  of the  French  King  Francis  I by a very unusual compliance the Commissioners went from the  ChapterHouse  after they had called in and invested the Earl of  Oxford  with his  Surcoat  and  Hood  to the  Dean's  House where the  Proctor  was lodg'd and in a great Chamber there shewed him the Sovereign's Commission and in it the Authority for admitting him into the Stall of his Lord and Master Upon which the  Proctor  presented them with his Procuration which impowered him to take Possession of i  and to perform what Ceremonies related to it which Instrument the  Register  read before them This being done they all proceeded to the Chappel where entering they waved their return to the  ChapterHouse  and passed directly into the  Choir  After some time of Consultation in the  ChapterHouse  the  Proxy  is sent for in thither by  Garter  who conducts him to the  ChapterHouse  Door and his Reception there by the Commissioners is after the same manner as is u  ed to the  Knight elect  or to his  Proxy  But whether he ought to enter the  ChapterHouse  or be admitted any farther than the Door or Porch thereof and to pass thence immediately into the  Choir  hath been some Question because the Practice seems to have been sometimes one way sometimes another  All that we find to prohibit his Entrance therein is an Expression in the short Ceremonial of  Installation  of Strangers by  Proxy  entered in the  BlackBook  where it  aysThat the  Mantle  is to be laid on the  Proctor's  right Shoulder in the  orch of the  ChapterHouse because he is n  to enter into it  And there are two Instances where the  Mantle  was delivered to the  Proctor  at the  ChapterHouse  Door from  whence some may infer that the Practice of those Times was also agreeable to the aforesaid direction namely that of the  Proctor  of the  French  King  Francis  I  Hen  VIII where  Garter  stood at the  ChapterHouse  D  or with the  Mantle  and as the Proceeding passed by presented it to the two Senior  KnightsCompanions  who placed it upon the  Proctor's  right Arm and so of the  P  octor  of  Emanuel  Duke of  Savoy  and  Phil  and  M  r  who entered not into the  ChapterHouse  but had the  Mantle  discussed at the Door  But these Instances if duly weighed cannot properly or with any Advantage be alledged to prove the Ass  r  on because the Affairs relating to both receiv'd dispa  ch in the  Proctors  Lodging a little before and where the  P  octor  himself was present where the meeting of the Commissioners and Proctor cannot be deemed less than a  Chapter  tho' not held in the  ChapterHouse  from the Transactions that passed there  viz  producing the Sovereign's Warra  t and the  Proctor's  Instrument of Deputation which were both read before them by the  Register  and the  Proctor  accordingly admitted which being finished nothing re  ating to the present purpose required their passing into the  ChapterHouse  or remained to be done till they came into the  Choir  But the general Practice runs strong on the contrary side for we find that the  Proctor  for  Charles  IX King o  France    Eliz  was met at the  ChapterHouse  Do  r by the Earls of  Sussex  and  Leicester  who took him in  between them where after the  Register  had read as  the Sovereign's Commission for Installation as his Letters of Procuration and the Commissioners had admitted him  Deputy  for the said King they all came forth and laid his Principal's  Mantle  on his right Arm and Shoulder the Train whereof was born by the Earl of  Southamp    a  sisted by the Lord  Herbert  of  Cardiff  Again it is remarkable  Eliz  that  Garter  cond  cted the  Proxy  of  Frederick  II King of  Denmark  o the  C  terHouse  and at that Place the Earl of  Leicester  and the Lord  Hunsdon  received and led him in So a  o wa  Christian  IVth's  Proxy  led thither by the Earls of  N  ingham  and  Dorset  And in  Jac  I  Lodowick  Count  Proctor  to  Maurice  Prince of  Orange  was called into  ChapterHouse  and there lest while the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  proceeded into the  Choir  Also in like manner was Sir  George Cartaret Proctor  to  Christian  Prince of  Denmark    Car  II and the  Proctors  to the King of  Sweden  and Duke of  Saxony    Car  II  Nor are these Instances and the Practice in this latter case really derogatory to the Statutes which though they prohibit the  Proxies  Entrance into the  ChapterHouse  yet do not extend to any thing previous to the Installation but what may happen after for the Article of the  Statutes  having first dire  ted the delivery of the  Mantle  to the  Proxy  and next the assumption of his  Principal's Stall  in these Words  Dictus Procurator Installatus  it immediately subjoins  that f  om thenceforth  that is from the time of Installation  he shall neither wear the  Mantle  nor enter into the  Chapter  nor have Voice there by virtue of any Power g  anted him  All which are Prohibitions plainly relating to future Examples and arising after the Ceremonies of Installation are past and not at all refering to what preceeds it  And it seems the Law hath been thus understood in regard the greater prevalence of Practice hath generally attended it for not only the  Proxies  of Strangers as is observed but generally  KnightsSubjects  have been called into the  ChapterHouse  and there received the  Mantle  before they proceeded into the  Choir  The Ceremony of delivering the  Mantle  to the  Proctor  is performed by the Sovereign his Deputy or the Commissioners  Garter  presenting it to them and the manner of it was anciently by putting it on the  Proxies  right Arm or Shoulder in the Name of his Lord and Master there to hold it till the End of Divine Service  But as there hath arisen some dispute touching the  Proctor's  entry into the  ChapterH  use  before Installation so it hath happened in this P  int of receiving the  Mantle viz  whether in the  Chapter  or  Stall  allotted their  Principal  of which there are Exam  les  That part of the Article in the  Statutes  of  Institution  relating to this Point runs thus  That the  Mantle  tempore Install  tionis Pr  curatoris  shall be laid on his Arm c but whether this shall be construed to that instant of time when the  Proctor  is brought to the  Stall  of his  Principal  or to s  me greater Latitude as during the time of I  stallation including the very first Action or beginning of the Ceremony namely the being called to the  ChapterHous  Door and entrance into it is the Question  because there are Instances in both but the latter is most wa  antable by the  Statutes  and general Practice  The Article in  Henry  VIIIth's  Statutes  being much more clear in describing and explaining the Ceremonies of  Installation  than any of the former the particulars of which in every Point seems to be excellently regulated having mentioned the Sovereign or his  Deputies  laying the  Mantle  on the  Proxies  Arm it immediately follows as the very next thing to be performed in course of time  That afterwards he shall be led by two Knights from the  ChapterHouse  Door to the  Stall  and there being shall make  is Oath and be installed  it gives no Account of laying the  Mantle  on the Arm of the  Proctor  at the instant of  Installation  in the  Choir  that being directed to be done before It is also recorded in the  BlackBo  k  where this Ceremony is more fully treated  That  Garter  shall take the  Mantle  upon his Arms and deliver it to both the  KnightsCommissioners  and that they  according to the Tenour of the Statutes  shall lay it on the  Proctor's  right Shoulder in the Porch of the  ChapterHouse  Besides the ancient usage of receiving the  Mantle  in the  ChapterHouse  or at the  ChapterHouse  Door either before or in the Proceeding to the  Choir  of which many instances may be given there are several modern instances where the  Mantle  was born to the  Choir  a  d sometimes the  Collar  of the  Order  with it not by the  Proctor  but by  Garter  before him and delivered in his  Principal's Stall  as in the Proceeding of the  Proxy  for the Duke of  Wirtembergh Anno    Jac  I when after he had taken the Oath and was led into the Duke's  Stall  not before was the Robe laid on his Arm and so was it done in many more  Installations  which manner hath so far prevail'd as to be the continu'd Practice  Garter  carrying the  Mantle  on a Cushion before the  Proctors  into the  Choir  and laying it after they have taken their Oaths  on their Arms in such manner that the  Cross  of St  George  may be conspicuous  Of the Proceeding to the Choir  § Concerning the  Proxies  Proceeding into the  Choir  King  Henry  VIIIth's  Statutes  direct  That he shall be accompanied  companied and led by  two KnightsCompanions  of the  Order  from the Door of the  ChapterHouse  to the  Stall  assigned to his Principal  agreeable to which is that Passage in the  BlackBook That as soon as the two Knights have placed the Mantle on his Arm they shall take him between them and conduct him to the  Stall  of his Lord  and thus assisted have all  Proxies  proceeded to the  Choir  Since the Custom of receiving the  Collar  in the  ChapterHouse  was laid aside the Sovereign or his Lieutenant with the  KnightsCompanions  so soon as the  Mantle  is delivered the  Proctor  or as of late that he hath been admitted according to the purport of his Deputation proceed to the  Choir  leaving the  Proxy  behind them in the  ChapterHouse  and after they have taken their  Stalls  the Sovereign directs two of the  KnightsCompanions  to descend who taking the  AlmsKnights Officers of Arms  and the three inferior Officers of the  Order  before them pass to the  ChapterHouse  and bring thence the  Proxy  to his  Installation  In this Proceeding the  Proxy  goes Bareheaded as did the Earl of  Dover Proctor  to  Charles  Prince Palatine of the  Rhine  and Sir  George Cartaret Proctor  to the Prince of  Denmark Anno    Car  II  The Ceremonies of Installation  § When the Proceeding hath entred the  Choir  and paid the accustomed Reverences both towards the  Altar  and the Sovere  gn's  Stall  and the  Alms Knights Officers of A  ms  and of the  Order  taken their usual Stations the two Commissioners  KnightsAssistants  or  KnightsCompanions  and  Proctor  make their Reverences together and then they conduct him into the lower  Stalls  direct  y bef  re the  Stall  appointed for his  Principal  the foresa  d  Officers  of the  Order  standing below in the  Choir  If there be more than two Commissioners then the two Sen  or conduct him as before while the rest of the Commissioners take their Station below in th  Ch  ir  b  fore their proper  Stalls  and there stay till the  stallation  be fin  sh'd and the like do the  Lieutena  tsAssis  ants  except the two Senior that are im  loyed in the Ceremony  The  P  oxy  thus introduced into the lower  S  alls  stands there while the  Register  pronounce  h the Oath of the  Order  to him which he repeats distinctly laying his Hand on the  New Testament  and afterwards kisse  h the Book  The ancient Oath appointed by the  Statutes  of Institution is short and without limitation in all Points the same with that a  KnightCompanion  takes at his Personal  Insta  lation viz Faithfully to observe to the utmost of his Power the  Statutes  of the  Order but afterwards the Sovereign's and Fellows of those other  Orders  of  Knighthood  as the  Golden Fleece Monsieur  St  Michael  c before their admission into the  Order  of the  Garter  sued for and obtained the allowance of some relative exceptions or proviso's to be added to the aforesaid Oath which usually were such as stood with the interest of their Religion their great State or Dignity or precedent obligation to the  Order  they had before accepted  In the  BlackBook  is a Precedent of the Oath to be taken by an Emperor whereby he is obliged to promi  e on his Royal Word and give his Faith on his Honour and the Holy Evangelists  That he will faithfully and truly to the utmost of his Power observe the Statutes in every Branch and Article thereof at least so far as they can or ought to be observed by him and so far as they shall not be c  trary or derogatory to those whereunto he hath before given his Name and Sworn and saving all other conditions agreed on  There are besides this other Precedents in the Annals of the Form of the Oath from the  Proctor  of an Emperor or King and of every other inferior Degree wherein are several exceptions before agreed on and when  Philip  King of  Castil  and  Leon  Sovereign of the  Order  of the  Golden Fleece  was Personally installed at  Windsor Anno    Hen  VII and took the Oath without Limitation yet he soon after obtain'd the Sovereign'  D  e  sation that the use of the  Collar  and other  Ensigns  of the  Order  might be left to his pleasure and that he might n  be obliged to be present at future  Chapters  Other Exceptions have been admitted but were obtained with great difficulty and much debate left the D  gnity and Reputation of the  Order  should  nstead o  be  g kept up be lessen'd the forbearance of some Ci  stances that hath been yeilded to having sometim  been brought into Precedent to the prejudice of the  O  der  The exceptions that were allow'd the ArchDuke of  Austri    when he took the Oath at h  s Investiture at  Noremberg Anno    Hen  VIII were as follow  Not to wear the  Garter  and  Collar  but at s  me certain times in the Year at his own pleasure  That if he were not in Place convenient to go to hear Mass on St  George  's Day he should cause a Priest to say it in his presence  Not to be obliged if busied in weighty Affairs to wear the  Garter Col  ar  or whole  Habit  of the  Order  on St  George  's Day longer than during divine Service nevertheless he pr  mised if he could not than wear it for a whole Day together he would willingly wear it on some other solemn Day within the compass of the Year  Of another nature were the exceptions which  Francis  I King of  France  procured to be admitted into the Oath taken by his  Proctor Anno    Hen  VIII  viz To observe the Statutes of the  Order  of the  Garter  so far as t  ey were consistent with and not contrary or prejudicial to the Statutes of the  Order  of St  Michael  and other  Orders  which his Principal had before taken of other Princes  Such like exceptions h  ve been generally allowed to Kings and Sovereign Princes but as to the  Proxies  of such Strangers not Sovereign Princes but Subjects the Form of their Oath is usually framed by the indu gence of the Sovereign with just limitations not only to their obligation of the Statutes of any other  Order  they had accepted or any Oath forme  ly taken but sometimes to the Fidelity and Allegiance which they owe their Sovereign Lord and Prince  After the Oath hath been administred to a Stranger's  Proxy  with such or the l  ke exceptio  s before set down the two  KnightsCommissioners  p  ss up with him into the higher Row of  Stalls  and so to that assign'd to his Principal where being arrived the  take the  Mantle  from  Ga  ter  and lay it upon the  Proctor's  left Arm with the Escutcheon of St  George  uppermost according t  an  Order  in a  Cha  ter  he  d  Anno    Car  II which w  s to be a standing Rule for the future a  d is now observ'd  In the Act and Ceremony of  Inst  llation  the  Commissione  s  who first conducted the  Prox  i to the  Choir  jointly embrace him then the  Proxy  makes hi  double Reverence  nd lastly the  Commissioners  accordi  g to the Custom of  Installations  set him down in his Principal's  Stall  whe  e he hath used to remain during Divine Service but by the aforesaid  Order  in  Chapter Anno    Car  II the  Proxies  are prohibited sitting in their  Stalls  but directed to stand before them uncovered with their  Mantles  on their right Arms until Divine Service be ended  The two  Knights  between whom the  Proxy  proceeded to  Installation  descend into the  Choir  and stand before their own  Stalls  and after a while first the Senior  Commissioners  and then the other ascend into them with usual Reverences and then Divine Service begins  The Proctor's Offering  § The  Proctor  having receiv'd Possession of his Principal's  Stall  stays in the  Choir  and performs the following Ceremonies the chief of which is the  Offering  of  Gold  and  Silver  according to the Degree and Seniority of his Principal's  Stall  in case the  Installation  be in the Morning but if it be celebrated when St  George  's Feast is held by the Sovereign's  Lieut  nant  the  Proxy  ought not to Offer till the  Lieutenant  hath first Offered for the Sover  ign and the  Lieutenant  also Offereth for himself before the  Proctor  if his Stall be higher than the Stranger's for whom the  Proctor  is installed  The  Proctor  in Offering doth it with all the Ceremony as if his Lord were present when the  KnightsCompanions  descend from their Stalls which Ceremony begins with the Junior  Knight  he also descends in his turn and placeth himself below in the  Choir  before the Stall of his  Principal  and if he have an opposite  KnightCompanion  he joins himself to him and p  oceeds towards the  Altar  to the Offering with the Officers of Arms before him but if no  KnightCompanion  e opposite he then proceeds alone having his T  ain born and a  KnightComp  nion  or some other great Personage suitable to his Deg  ee attending on his left Hand to give him the Offering wh ch he Offers kneeling on a Cushion an  after him the rest of the  KnightsCompanions  p  esent Offer every one according to the Seniority of their Stalls  After the Offering the  P  oct  r  taking his way by the Eastend of the Stalls retu  ns back to the Stall of his  P  incipal  and Divine Service being finish'd  and like Honou  in all respects shewed to his  Proxy  as if his Principal had been present he ought to remain in his Master's Stall till his next Junior  Knight  hath left his Stall and then descend after him and st  nd below before his Stall till his turn come to join himself again to the Proceeding and so to pass out of the  Choir  Sometimes the  Proctor  hath been receiv'd at his coming down from his L  rd's Stall by the two  KnightsCommissioners  who installed him as were the  P  cto  s  of  F  ederick  II King of  Denmark  and  John  C  unt Palatine of the  Rhine  between whom they also pr  ceeded to the  Chapte  House  Door in the same manner the  were conducted into the  Choir  but notwithstandi  g this the  Proctor  ught rather to take in his return the Place of his Principal as he did at the Offering and which is indeed his right and so the  P  octor  of  F  ancis  I went behi  d alone in his Principal's place and followed the  KnightsCommissioners  from the  Ch  ir  to the place where he  ged and this Method is since followed  The Dinner  § When the  Installation  hath past in the Morning there hath usually been prepared a great Dinner at the Sovereign's Cha  ge we need here only men  on what is different in this particular from the Personal  Ins  allati  n  of a  KnightCompanion  The  Proxy  washes alone  its at the  hief Place of the Table alone and is serv'd alone b  t the other  K  ightsCompanions  sit at the end of the Ta  le but if the S  vereign's Li  ute  ant be  resent the  P  octor  i  es at the same Ta  le with him and then a little bef  re the se  nd Course is brought in the Sovereig  's S  ile is pro  laimed with the usual Ceremony in  Latin French  and  English  but otherwise only the S  ile of the new installed Prince and but once The S  le and Ti  les of  Christian  IV King of  Denmark  were procla  med in  Latin  and of  M  uri    Prince of  Orange  in  French  D  ner be  ng ended all r  se in Order and Wash first the  Proxy  al  ne and after him the  KnightsCommissioners  and  ccompanying the  Proctor  to hi  Chamber where leaving  him they retire to their own Lodgings and there put off their Habits  When the Solemnity of  Installation  is over the  Proctor  is to take care that  Garter  forthwith set up the Atchievements of his  Principal  over his  Stall  and fix the Plate of his Arms on the back thereof in Memorial of the Ceremony of Inauguration to which end also Medals have frequently been struck to perpetua  e the Honour so received  CAP XVII The Duties and Fees payable by the  KnightsCompanions  at their Installations  Touching the Fees due to the College of  Windsor  § SUCH was the P  ety and Bounty of our Ancestor  that they thought no Work well perform'd without be  ng attended with some charitable Donatio  e  pecially if it had rela  ion to the Church whereto they generally bore a venerable Esteem Hence was it a  the  I  stallation  of the  Order  ordain'd  That every  K  ight  o  panion  should at his entrance bestow a certain Sum of Money according to his Quality and Degree  That is to say     l  s  d  The S  vereign of the  Order        A St  ge  King        The Prince of  Wales        Every Duke        Every Earl        Every Ba  on        E  ery KnightBatchelor        These Summs were appointed  towards the Reli  f of the Ca  nons of  Windsor  the AlmsKnights and augmentation  of the AlmsDeeds there appointed perpetually to be  o  e  To the end  That every one entring into this Mi itary  Order  might thereby more worthily obtain the Name Title and Privilege of one of the Founders of the  Order  it being supposed a worthy and just thing that whosoever obtained this Privilege should add some small increment to this Foundation  Not long after establishing the Statutes the Titles of  Marquiss  and  Viscount  bec  ming special Dignities it was Decreed  Anno    He    VI that a  Marquiss  should contribute  l    s    d  and a  Viscount    l    s    d  which was confirmed by King  Henry  VIIIth's Statutes  And though in all the Bodies of the Statutes the Sovereign of the  Order  is charg'd with Payment of Fees to the College yet is it to be understood only of those Sovereigns who were not before the assumption of their S  all elected into this  O  der  Upon a Decree  Anno    Car  II the  Installation  Fee to all the Officers of the  Order  were settled Those made payable to the  Dean  and  Canons  are     l  s  d  A Stranger King        A Stranger Prince        The Prince of  Wales        A Duke        A Marquiss        An Earl        A Viscount        A Baron        A KnightBatchelor        These Fees ought to be paid at the time of the Knight's  Installation  by the Hands of some one of their S  rvants so soon as the Ceremonies are ended the Statutes exp  essl  prohibiting the setting up of their Atchievements till Payment be made  The  AlmsKnights  by Q  een  Elizabeth  's Establishme  t receiv'd  I  stallation  Fees apart fr  m those paid to the College which by the aforesaid Establishment  f F  Anno    Car  II are made equal to those pa  able to the  D  n  and  Canons  and by the said Dec  ee the  C  oi  f  Wi  sor  under wh  ch n  t only the  Vicars  but the  V  r  e  s C  oristers  and  BellRingers  are comprehended receive the following Fees     l  s  d  A Stranger King        A Stranger Prince        A Prince of  Wales        A Duke        A Marquiss        An Earl        A Viscount        A Baron        A KnightBatchelor        Fees due to the  Register Garter BlackRod  and  Officers  of  Arms  § In the Ra  k of those Officers to whom  Installation  Fees are due stands first the  Register  who as appears by the  BlackBook  is to have of every  KnightCompanion    s    d  and a Robe  But there being a concealment of this Fee it was represen  ed to King  Charles  I who ordered the  Register  to be paid in L  eu of the Robe as follows        s  d     l  s  d  Imprim For a  KnightBatchelor      and        Baron            Viscount            I  em For a

other Officer of the  Order  As  o the first of these it was ordained by  he Constitutions of his Office  That as of  en as any Knight should happen  to be installed he might challenge for himself the Garments wore by him immediately before his Investiture with the Surcoat of the  Order And the constant Practice hath interpreted this to be the Knight's upper Garment anciently a short Gown of later times a Cloak but now a Coat which he puts off in the  ChapterHouse  when the  Investiture  begins  By the Establishment of  Installation  Fees  Anno    Car  II the composition set u  on each  KnightCompanion  for his upper Garment was thus rated     l  s  d  A Prince of  Wales        A Duke        A Marquiss        An Earl        A Viscount        A Baron        A KnightBatchelor        Besides this Droit or Composition there hath in all times been paid to  Garter  by every  KnightCompanion  a Fee for his  Installation  which was likewi  e brought to the following certainty by the said Establishment     l  s  d  A Stranger King        A Stranger Prince        A Prince of  Wales        A Duke        A Marquiss        An Earl        A Viscount        A Baron        A

the Fee of a Stranger King they have an addition of ten Pounds more  Fees belonging to other of the Sovereign's Servants  § In the Lists of  Installation  Fees of former times some Officers were set down who gave their attendance  ith the several Sums they receiv'd some that were then accounted Fees and others Benevolences all which nevertheless were admitted into the List of  Installation  Fees  Car  II and though not entered into the  Register  of the  Order  yet are to be given in under the Hand of  Garter  with the other Fees payable at  Installations  and to be paid by every Knight to all Persons concern'd respectively according to ancient Custom  viz     Prince  Duke  Marquiss  Ear    To the Wardrobe                          The Trum  ets                          The Serj Trumpet

therefore by the  Statutes  of  Institution  the Sovere  gn is obliged to pay them the first Example whereof that we meet with is an Order  Hen  VI which appointed  That the usual Fees due for the  Installation  of the King of  Denmark  should be discharg'd by the Sovereign as the  S  atute  enjoin'd  To this purpose PrivySeals were issued to the Lord T  easurer for the time being to pay the Fees to the  Register  of the  Order  out of the  Exchequer  which was the constant Custom till King  Charles  I in the th Year of his Reign settled an Annual Pension of  l  upon the  O  der  and by a Comm  ssion in the said Year impower'd the Chancellor of the  Order  and his Successors to pay out of the same not only the ordinary but also extraordinary Charges of the  O  der  wherein the Fees for  nstallation  of Strangers are included  Notwithstanding the Sovereign as we have shown dis  harg'd the  Installation  Fees due from Strangers yet they  or their  Proctors  for them did always bestow particular Rewards on the  College  the Officers of the  Order  and of  Arms  the  AlmsKnights  and some others who attended the Solemnity and in particular  Garter  had anciently bestowed on him a rich Gown to wear at the time of  Installation  but of late he has been presented with some other thing of considerable Value They also were liberal to the Officers of  Arms  as appears by several  Largesses  given to them by their  Proctors  and in general to the greatest part of those that gave their Attendance  CAP XVIII Of the Grand Feast of the  Order  The Grand Feast appointed to be celebrated Annually on St  George  's  Day  § BY the  Statutes  of  Institution  it's ordain'd That a solemn Festival should be Annually celebrated on the d Day of  April  or St  George  's  Day  in Honour of the Patron of the  Order  as is observed in other military Orders erected since this of the  Garter  to which this seems to give Rules of holding their Festivals on the Anniversary of their Patrons Thus  Philip  Duke of  Burgundy  on his erecting the  Order  of the  Golden Fleece  taking St  Andrew  for its Patron appointed the Festival on St  Andrew  's  Day Lewis  XI King of  France  appointed  Michaelmas Day  for holding the Feast of the  Order  of St  Michael  And so the Festival of the Duke of  Savoy  's  Order  of the  Annunciade  on  Lady Day  The Duke of  Bourbon  's  Order  of the Knights of our  Lady  on the Conception of our  Lady  th  December  and other instances might likewise be given if it were necessary  The Anniversary of St  George  fixed by the Church to the twenty third of  April  § That the d of  April  was the Day whereon St  George  suffered Martyrdom by Beheading appears from the  Greek Hexamiter  before his Commemoration which was the Day observed both by the  Greek  and  Latin Church  as also by our Predecessors the  Saxons  St  George  's  Day  made  Festum duplex  § After the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  had encreased the Honour of their Patron's Festival our Church began to take greater notice of it being now also esteemed among us as the Patron of the Nation and therefore they bestowed an addition of Honour upon it by making it  Festum duplex ad Modum Majorum Duplicis    Hen  V  The Place for celebrating the Grand Feast assigned to  WindsorCastle  § The Founder of this most Noble  Order  having fixed on this Day for performing its Solemnities he made Choice of that of his Nativity the  Cas  le  of  Windsor  which for a long time after was inviola  ly observed there either upon the very Day or some other appointed by Pro  ogation not long after For which way of Prorogation allowance was given by the  Statutes  of the  Order  and of which the  Registers  are full of i  stances  St  George  's  Day  kept apart from the Grand Feast and how then observed  § How this Noble  Order  flourished from its Foundation to the time of  Henry  V no Account can be given since the Annals thereof are wanting to his Reign but then it appears to have been in considerable S  lendor but the Civil Wars toward the end of  Henry  VIth's Reign eclipsed it for a while Under King  E  ward  IV when things were a little settled it seem'd to recover and in K  g  Henry  VIIIth's time was at a greater heighth than e  er However though the several Branches of the  Order  receiv'd some Augmentation from the influence  f this  Monarch yet the Grand Feast began to decline by a removal of the observation of St  George  's  Day  from  Windsor  and a prorogatory Celebration of the Grand Feast to other times  The Article of the  Statutes  causing this great alteration from the original design of the first Institution gives the Sovereign Power to prorogue the Grand Feast at his Pleasure but then 'tis evident from the same Statute that St  George  's  Day  was nevertheless ordained to be duly oblerved by it self in what Place soever the Sovereign  f wi  hin the Realm should then reside  Windsor  hereby being not excluded  It farther implies the sacred  Rites  and  Offices  to be performed with other Matters concerning the  Order  for besides the particulars therein enumerated this general Clause is observable That what other urgent Affair s  ever relating to the  Order  should offer it self to be performed the same might be treated of and receive dispatches in the  Chapter  held where the Sovereign then should be as fully as if he were at  Windsor Castle  So that henceforward all things began to be ordered both on the Eve the Day of St  George  and the Morrow after with as great State all Affairs as legally dispatched and all Ceremonies as magnificently performed except that of offering up of Atchie  ements which is peculiar to the Chappel of St  George  at  Windsor  only as cou'd be observed at the  Grand Festival  it self  And how by Virtue of this Article and with what Ceremonies St  George  's  Day  was held when the Grand Feast was prorogued is evident from a full and ample Precedent  Hen  VIII now remaining in the  Office  of  A  ms  For though the Sovereign with  KnightsCompani  ns  were at  Windsor  that Year upon the and of  April  yet at that time they observed only the Feast Day of St  George  with the Eve and Morrow after but de  erred by Order in  Chapter  the Celeb  ation of the Grand Feast to the th of  May  ensuing  The Grand Feast neglected by King  Edward  VI  § From the Accession of this Prince the Sovereignty of this  Order  became more neglected so that during his  no Anniversary of St  George  was kept at  Windsor  y a  Grand Festival  This is supposed to be owing to the common Calamity of that Age wherein most Ceremonies solemn or splendid especially such as related to Divine Services came under the denomination of being either Superstitious or Idolatrous Insomuch that at a  Chapter  held at  Greenwich    Edw  VI an Abolition being intended for such Ceremonies as were not consonant to the King's Injunctions lately prescribed it was then decreed that then and for ever from thenceforth at the Feast of this most Noble  Order  no other Ceremonies should be observed  han such as were appointed by his Majesties Letter  That no Procession should be made with going about the Church or Churchyard but the King's Majesty's Procession lately set forth in  English  to be used His Majesty and other  KnightsCompanions  sitting in their Stalls at the Entry such Reverences to be made to the King's Majesty only as was heretofore The Offering to be in the Box for the Poor without any other Reverence or kissing any Paten or other thing but only at the return due Reverence to the King as was used before The Mass of  Requiem  to be left undone but yet both on St  George  's  Day  and for next Day a Mass to be S  ng with great Reverence in which immediately after the Words of Consecration is said the Priest shall say the  Pater Noster  and so turn and Communicate to all or so many of the  Order  or other after they have done as shall be disposed to receive the Communion according to the  Order  prescribed by his Majesty's Book of Communion and without any other Rite or Ceremony after the said Communion to be used except some godly Psalm or Hymn to be Sung in  English  and so to end the said Service All  Chapters  and other Rites concerning the  Order  n  being cont  ary to these to remain as they have been used  This Decree seemed to mean nothing less than a Prohibition to the holding the Grand Feast at  Windsor  at least the neglect of its Celebration there whilst King  Edw  VI lived And though toward the End of his Reign some care was taken for a Permission to hold the said Feast ei  her on St  George  's  Day  or some other appointed by Prorogation yet it was without any regard to the ancient and usual Place for when the Act passed commanding the Days therein mentioned to be kept Holy and no other  whereby this was involved among many other Saints Days then prohibited to be kept as not being found among the Feasts then Establish'd it was considered that a Pro  iso and Allowance should be entered in the aforesaid Act for the Celebration of this Feast particularly by the  KnightsCompanions  which Act though it suffered a Repeal by Queen  Mary  yet stands in force at this Day being revived by King  James  I his repealing that  Statute  of  Mar Cap    Removed from  Windsor  by Queen  Elizabeth  § But the most fatal Blow given to the growing Honour of the Castle of  Windsor  was a Decree in  Chapter  held  Eliz  with the consent of the  KnightsCompanions  then present  viz  That if on the Vigil and Day of St  George  the Feast was not held at  Windsor  according to the usual Custom it should nevertheless be sufficient if the Observation thereof were kept at the same Place where the Sovereign should then happen to be where also the rest of the  KnightsCompanions  were obliged to be present no less than if the Feast had been held at  Windsor  And so severe was the latter part of this Decree against the flourishing condition of that Place that it commanded also  T  at no other Solemnity under the notion of St  George  's Feast should thenceforth be celebrated at  Windsor  except upon occasion of the  Installation  of some illustrious Person and then also not without express leave of the Sovereign  And to say truth this  Statute  was but too strict  y observed during her Reign for we meet but with one Feast of St  George  held there till  Jac  I unless we mistake the Feasts of  Installation  for those of St  George  ut then the Sovereign who was yet in  Scotland  e  t his Commission dated  April  to the Earl of  Nottingham  his  Lieutenant  to prorogue the Festival to the d  July  lowing and after constituted him to hold the Feast wh  ch was performed the and Days of the said Month with all Pomp and Ceremony The King himse  f be  ng then at  Windsor  was prevented from being present by some occasion not mentioned  Thus after a long Interval the Honour of the Feast was restored which had this effect toward the End of King  James  I Reign and that of his Son and Successor King  Charles  I that it begat a Reunion of the Feast and Place whereby the Castle of  Windsor  famous for the  Institution  of this most Noble  Order  retrieved its ancient Honour of having its Solemnities celebrated there  Of Prorogation of the Grand Feast  § Having thus noted that from the beginning of King  Henry  VIIIth's Reign till of late Years the Grand Feast was seldom observed upon the precise Day of St  George  and that the occasion how both Day and Feast came to be celebrated apart took its rise from the indulgence of the  Statutes  in point of Prorogation 'Tis necessary farther to observe that this Prorogation is of two sorts either Absolute as being enjoined by the  Statutes  or else A  bitrary at the Sovereign's Pleasure upon intervening Reasons  In the first of these the Founder's  Statutes  enjoin  That if the Feast of St  George  shall happen within fifteen Days next after  Easter Day  it shall be prorogued to the Sunday F  rtnight or fifteen Days after  Easter Day And the reason is there given  That every of the  KnightsCompanions  might have opportunity of coming thereto without being constrained to ride upon any of those three Holy Days preceedi  g  Easter Day The same Rule for Prorogation where there is a concurrence of these two Feasts is likewise enjoin'd by the  Statutes  of King  Henry  V and King  Henry  VIII  And when the Grand Feast in this ca  e of  Easter  has been kept before the expiration of the said fifteen Days the  KnightsCompanions  then absent to avoid the Penalty for their not appearing have made Excuse that the ancient  Statutes  of the  Order  were violated in keeping the Feast within fifteen Days after  E  ster  as was al  edged when Sir  John Denham  Lord Treasurer as President held the Feast of St  George  at  Windsor    April    en  y  VII  Anciently where the  Register  mentions the Grand Feast to  e held at  Windsor  beyond the Day of St  Geo  ge  'tis observable upon Calculation that  Easter Day  in those  times  ell too near the d of  April  to celebrate the Feast on w  thout breaking the Law which was the real cause of those Prorogations of which there are many Instances  And as the  KnightsComp  nions  had Prohibitions put  pon the Solemnization of their Feast in case of its inter  ering with  E  ster  so had the Church of  England  in their Observation of St  George  's  Day  in reference to several other Festivals and this continued till the time of the Reformation begun by King  Edward  VI but since the Grand Feast has been celebrated upon any of them indifferently the Feast of  Easter  only excepted  The second sort of Prorogations which are meerly Arbitrary and wholly dependent on the Sovereign's Pleasure yet warranted sufficiently from the Words  Causa postulante  mentioned in King  Henry  VIII's Statutes as likewise the great Latitude given the Sovereigns of this most Noble  Order  in reference to their Affairs in the sam  Statutes The first Precedent of which was  Ann    Hen  V when about  August  four Months after St  Geo  ge  's  Day  that King being engaged in the Wars of  France  ordered the Feast to be celebrated at  Caen  in  N  mandy  and with great Solemnity created fifteen K  ights into th  Order  There are several other Examples particularly one  Hen  VIII when the King being at  E  tham  on St  George  's  Day  it was in a  Chapter  there held Decreed That the accustomed Feast of St  George  shou  d be observed at  Winds  r  th of  May  ensuing And from this time it became Annually customary to keep the Day of St  George  where the Sovereign at that time made his Abode On which Day and the Day after the usual Solemnities were observed But as to the Solemnization of the Grand Feast it  el  that was in one of the  Chapters  then he  d adj  urned to some farther time and then solemnized at  Windso  by Prorogation not by the Sovereigns themselves but by their  Lieutenants  and their  Assistants  appointed for that purpose  But to proceed with the Causes of Prorogation which were either for some weighty reasons or upon emergent Occasions  Anno    Mariae  the Sovereign celebrat  ng the Feast of St  George  at St  James  's  Philip  Pr  nce o  Spain  and the Earl of  Sussex  were on the Morrow a  er elected into the  O  der  whereupon it was likewise D  cre  that the Inauguration of these two  elect Knight  till the Prince came to  England  which happening st  July  following the Grand Feast together with that of the  elect Knights  Installations were appointed to be celebrated at the same time  Again and  Phil  and  Mar  at a  Chapter  held d  April  the Feast of St  George  together with the Installation of three  elect Knights  was appointed to be held at  Winds  r  the th of  May  ensuing and by a  Chapter  Summoned the d of  May  before the appointed Day for holding the Feast the same was prorogued to the th of  December  following upon the pressing Affairs of the King and Queen But before that designed time came another  Chapter  was held on the st of  October  wherein it was again prorogued to the first Sunday after  Twelfthday viz    January  if by that time the King who was then in  Flanders  should return to  England  But that not happening it was farther prorogued to the th of  February  and thence by another Decree to St  George  's  Day  Of which there are many other Examples and sometimes upon other Occasions but still at the Sovereign's Pleasure  Of Commissions of Prorogation  § There is no Precedent of Commissions for Prorogation ancienter than  Car  I left by Sir  Thomas Rowe  wherein notice is taken of all the adjournments of the Grand Feasts from St  George  's  Day  preceeding ti  l that time with the reasons thereof and chiefly upon consideration of the spreading Sickness together with a C  mmand to the  KnightsCompanions  and the Officers of the  Order  to attend the Sovereign on the new assigned Days for celebrating the Feast  As to the substance hereof the succeeding Commissions very near agree yet with some little difference as first the Preambles are general and run thus  W  ereas upon special Reasons and other important Affairs  c except the Commission issued th  February  where the P  eamble was fitted to a special Occasion and runs thus  W  ereas we have determined to Create the Prince our eldest Son a Knight and to propose him in Election as  Companion of our most Noble  Order  for the more conveniency of his  Installation  we have thought fit to defer the Feast of St  George c  But in the Commissions of Prorogation of the Grand Feast th  February    Car  I the Place appointed for Celebration is omitted which defect we find in the abovementioned Precedent also yet afterwards that material part came to be incerted and first of all in that Commission of the th  February    Car  I where the Place being the City of  York  is put into the Body of the Commission And when the Civil War drew on and the Sovereign could not well ascertain any Place then the Grand Feast was appointed to be kept at any such Place as on a nearer view should seem convenient afterwards it varied something and came to be inserted thus  Wheresoever we shall then be  or thus  at such Places as we shall timely appoint  The most ordinary course preparatory to the issuing such Commissions of Prorogation has been by the Sovereign's Declaration in  Chapter  or otherwise the signification of his Pleasure to the Chancellor of the  Order  at any other time who thereupon drew up the Commission and presented it to the Sovereign for his Sign Manual and then affixed thereto the Great Seal of the  Order  But where the Chancellor was not at hand to receive the Sovereign's Commands in this case it was conveyed to him by some other Hand with Command to Summon the  KnightsCompanions  and Officers accordingly For so it was done to Sir  Francis Windebank  Kt Secretary of State by his Letter to Sir  Thomas Rowe    Car  I for Prorogation of the Grand Feast  And as all the preceeding Adjournments of the Grand Feast have been either Decreed in  Chapter  or directed immediately from the Sovereign so there is a Precedent where the  Lieutenant  has been impowered to Prorogue the same yet to the Time and Place appointed by the Sovereign and inserted in the Commission of  Lieutena  cy  And this was in a Commission  Jac  I directed to  Charles  Earl of  Nottingham  That the Grand Feast ought to be celebrated on  a Year  § Though the Prorogations of the Grand Fea  have been occasionally made use of on the aforesaid important Reasons yet no such Adjournment or Prorogation is legally to be enlarged beyond St  George  's  Day  ensu  ng  because once within the compass of every Year the Grand Feast ought to be solemnized for so it was ordained by the  Statutes  at the Institution of the  Order  and confirmed likewise by the succeeding  Statutes  And when our Historians take notice of the Grand Feast they s  eak of the same thing that it ought annually to be performed whence it is frequently called in the Registers  Annua Festivitatis solemnitas annua Celebritas annua  and the like  Of late times an occasion happened that brought this of the  Statutes  into a solemn debate in  Chapter  which for the resu  t thereof became very remarkable  At a  Chapter  held at  WhiteHall  d  February  The Sovereign proposed to the  KnightsCompanions  t  at having prorogued the Celebration of St  George  's  Feast  fro  time to time to the    and    of  March  so near Lent that if the Feast were not held on these Days it could not be done within the compass of that Year because the    d of  April  for the next Year did fall on  GoodFriday  and s  consequently must have been kept in Lent this Year or not at all and conside  ing the great and impo  tant Affairs of the P  liament he moved the Question whether if there we  e no Feast kept this Year it would be any Blemish to the Hon  ur  f the  Order  And whether he might not dispence with the  S  a  ute  and defer it ti  l next Year They all c  nfessed the Sove  eign's dispensing Power yet some of the  Knights  seeing from the Institution to that time no Pr  ent was  ound where the Grand Feast had been wholly omi  ed but th  t some of the Sovereigns even th  ugh engaged in War b  yond Sea either solemnized t  e Feast in their own P  s  nce  or by Commission in  England  which was averred by the  Chancellor  to be both the fund  mental and constant Practice humbly besought the Sovereign not to begin to make any breach in the constant  Order  so long and  ninte  ruptedly continued Whereupon it was resolved by general Vote that the Feast should be celebrated on the aforesaid Days of Prorogation  By which determination it sufficiently appears of what Moment the Sovereign and  Knights C  mpanions  then conceived it to the Honour of the  Order  to follow the  Statutes  for the Celebration of the Grand Feast once every Year Besides it is observable that it was not thought exped  ent to be d  spensed with even on the most pressing and important Occasions But rather than the  Statutes  should suffer any Violation the Feast was then solemnized tho' they were so straiten'd in point of time as not to ha  e above two Days to make preparation for it  And though indeed on the breaking out of the unhappy Civil War the Sovereign was obliged to defer the Solemnity from Year to Year it was n  t to be looked on as any Precedent and on the Restauration of King  Charles  II it renewed its former  Order  CAP XIX Of Preparations for the Grand Feast of the  Order  Of Letters giving notice of the Time and Place  § AMong many other things which are nec  ss  ry to be prepared beforehand the first of c  u  se is the Letters directed to all the  K  ightsCompanions  and Officers of the  Order  resident within  he Kingdom to give them notice of the Time and Place when a  d where the Feast is to be h  ld Le  er  of Dispenla  on to such Knights as the Sovereign shall please to Excuse from their attendance at the Feast Comm  ssion  of Lieutenancy or sometimes of Assistance when the Sovereign cannot personally Solemnize the same Warrants for the removal of Atchievements if there be then Occasion Escutcheons and Stiles to be set on the back of each  KnightCompanion's  Stall if the Feast be held elsewhere than at  Windsor  The Chapp  l to be decently adorned The Great Hall or other Place for the Grand Din  er to be prepared and very nobly furnished And lastly Officers to be a  pointed besides those of the  Order  of Arms who are to give peculiar Attendance on the Sovereign at this Grand Solemnity  As to the first of these Points the Chancellor is to attend the Sovereign some convenient time before the approach of St  George  's  Day  to learn his Pleasure therein and whether he is inclined to Prorogue the Day c  If the Sovereign be inclined to a Prorogation th  n the Chancellor is to draw up a Commission f  r that purpose After this Letters iss  ed out anciently under the Sovereign's Sign Manual both to his Lieutenant when he ho  ds not the F  ast perso  ally and the  KnightsCompanions  giving them notice of the Time and Place but of late the Chancellor hath been appointed to dispatch these Letters in his own Name  But whether the Feast be held upon St  George  's  Day  or any other by Prorogation the Sovereign's Pleasure was usually known so long before the a  pointed time that these circular Letters issued out sometimes t  three four five or six Months before the assigned Day An  in cases where there has been farther Pr  gati  ns c  re has been taken to iss  e out new Commissi  n  in the like convenient tim  before the old were expired as may be observed by what has gone be  ore that  o tho  e  KnightsCompanions  who are most remote from Court ma  have sufficient time to prepare ei  her for a  t  nda  ce or on just occasion to apply themselves to the S  vereign for Letters of Dispensation for ab  ence And farther that the ab  ent Knights may thereby take notice of the Day set because such are ob  iged to hold the Feast in  heir own Houses at the  ame  m    B  si  es the Letters directe  to the  KnightsCompanions  the Ch  ncellor is likewise to write hi  o each of the Officers of the  Order  to give them the like notice  Of Dispensations for not attending the Grand Feas    § It having been complained of by the Chancellor of the  Order  and taken notice of by the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  in a Chapter held at the Celebration of the Grand Feast  Car  I at  WhiteHall  That of late Years divers  KnightsCompanions  had neglected both their attendance on the Sovereign at the Feast of St  George  or to send under their Seals of Arms their probable Excuses and Petitions for Licence and Dispensation contrary to the most ancient  Statutes  and their Duty  It was therefore among many other things Decreed  Tha  for the future every Knight of the  Order  should be bound to attend on the usual Days or such as should be assigned by Prorogation  But in case of Sickness or other important Business to re  ard them they shou'd under their S  als of Arms to the Chancellor signify the reasons for requiring a Dispensation for their absence twenty Days at+least before the usual or assigned time to be presented by him to the Sovereign and on neglect of so doing except in sudden Accidents should not be excused but incur the Penalty of the  Statutes  And it is evident that this way of enjoining the  KnightsCompanions  to send the reason  hat prevented their Attendan  under their Seals has been very ancient for the  BlackB  k  re  rds an  Order  in  Chapter  held at a General Fea  t  He    VI  o this very purpose and e  jo  ned far  her  T  at when suc  absent Knights were present at the ne  Feas  ey should be obliged to give the reas  n  hy t  e  should no  i  ur  he Penalty of their former absence since the  S  a  u  es  e  j  in it  In pursu  nc  of the  eforementioned Decree Sir  Thomas  the  Chancellor added to those his Letters dated  M    a  d directed to the  u  de  he Seal of the  Order  this following Post  cr  pt  Acco  i  to  o  cts made in  Chapter  in the Presence of the  April    concerning  he neglect of  he  i  Attenda  ce upon his  George  and a C  mmand expres  so  ch to your  Lordship  I have the t  ue  Copies of the Acts themselves it being resolved in case of Omission of your lawful and timely Excuse under your Seal of Arms and in occasion of absence in keeping the Solemnity in your own House that no Dispensation shall be given but your  Lordship  shall incur the Penalties of the ancient  Statutes  which are That you shall not be permitted to the  Chapter  nor to your Seat the next Year but sh  ll stand before it as do the  Choiristers  In Procession then you shall go before and not in your Place among the Knights and shall Offer last and that this Penance being done you shall come before the Seat of the Sovereign and ask Absolution But if two Years successively your  Lordship  shall omit your Attendance or timely Suit for Dispensation  ou shall Pay twenty Marks and that Sum to be doubled for every Year of such Omission till you are reconcil  d and pardoned by the Sovereign whereof I beseech your  Lordship  to take knowledge  It a  terwards appears by an  Order  past in  Chapter  th  October    Car  I that this early notice to be given from such of the  KnightsCompanions  as upon the reasons already mentioned should be absent was designed chiefly in Favour of the Officers of the Sovereign's  Houshold  who by knowing in due time who should be absent and who not might make timely and certain Provision for the Feast  Upon notice sent by the Chancellor to the  KnightsComp  nions  as aforesaid if any of them should happen to be any way indisposed or have other lawful Ex  use for not repairing to Court and attending the Feast they may acquaint the Chancellor therewith whose Duty i  is to represent it to the Sovereign and thereon to procure his Let  ers of Dispensation for their absence if the Sovereign consents  Which Letters are to be conveyed by  Garter  or carried by whomsoever he shall appoint for which there was a Fee by the Mile allowed him by the following  Order  past at a Meeting held by the  KnightsCommissioners  for regulating Points relating to the  Order    Car  I  Whereas it having anciently been the Office of  Garter King  of  Arms  to disperse and send Letters of Prorogation D  spensati  n and other Command  of the Sovereign to the absent Knights which in man  c  ses must be chargeable it  as this Day ord  red That if he should send a  y Act of  avour or Dispensation to any Knight absent from his Majesty's Court or four Miles from the City of  London  he to whom such Dispensation should be sent should pay his Servant or Messenger for every Day's Travel as much as is allowed and paid any other Messengers of his Majesty's House or Chamber  Variety of Occasions and Accidents as Grounds to move the Sovereign and Inducements to obtain his Dispensation are extant in several Letters sent to Sir  Thomas Rowe  when Chancellor on the aforesaid Injunctions Decreed  Car  I but they all agree in the Causes we have mentioned  Of Commissions of Lieutenancy  § Touching the third particular and preparing Commissions of Lieutenancy in such cases where the Sovereign ca  not personally Celebrate the Feast as also Commissions for those whom he thinks fit to appoint for his  Assistants  the Reader is referr'd to the Head in the next  Chapter  under which there is an Account of constituting a  Lieutenant  and here only observe that the Chancellor is to draw up these Commissions and attend the Sovereign for his Hand and after to pass them under the Great Seal of the  Order  Warrant for the removal of Atchievements  § If there be occasion for removal of any of the  KnightsCompanions  Atchievements at the Grand Feast which indeed has seldom happened unless an Installation were celebrated at the same time then does the Chancellor obtain the Sovereign's Warrant directed to  Garter  for the performance thereof But of this we have already said sufficient under the Head of Preparations made for Personal Installations of a  KnightCompanion  Escutcheons of Arms and Stiles  § Heretofore when the Celebrations of St  Geo  ge  's  Day  were kept at any other Place besides  Windsor Cast  e  it was thought most necessary to provide large Paper E  cutcheons wherein were Marshalled the Arms and Quarterings of the Sovereign and each  KnightCompanion  in Metal and Colour encompassed with a  Garter  and thereon Crowns Caps or Coronets peculiar to each Dignity with their Stiles and Titles fairly printed underneath but without Crests or Supporters to be set on the back side of their Stalls on the Eve of the Feast But the Sovereign's Arms were impaled with those of St  George  over which an Imperial Crown was placed and these in defect of the Plates and Banners set over their Stalls in the Choir of St  George  's  Chappel  at  Windsor  did serve for Directions for the  KnightsCompanions  that by the view of them they might the more readily and certainly know their proper Stalls  We have not met with any Memorial of this usage that reacheth higher than  Anno    Hen  VII when the Sovereign holding the D  y of St  George  at  Cambridge King's College Chappel  was furni  hed with Escutcheons of the  KnightsCompanions  Arms but to shew the use was ancient there is this Note put into the Memorial as was Yearly accustomed  Anno    Hen  VIII the So  ereign being at  Windsor  on the Eve of St  George  appointed  he Service of the Church to be ce  e  rated in his Cha  pel in the upper Qu  drangle of  Wi  dsor Castle  and there being present with him thirteen  KnightsCompanions  e  ch of them had set over their Heads an Escutcheon of their Arms  Th  s manner the Stalls were afterwards solemnly  and enlarged to absent Knights b  an  O  e  of  Chapter  held at  Greenwich Anno    Edw  VI wherein the S  vereign a  d  KnightsCompanions  agreed tha  fr  m thenceforth every Stall upon St  G  o  ge  's  Eve  should have an Escutcheon of the Arms of them which are absent as well as those that were present at their s  veral Co  s and Charges  But this c  nn  t be understood of the S  alls situate in the Cha  pe  of St  George  at  Winds  r  f  r  si  es that we have met with no anc  e  t Ac  ou  t o  any s  ch Cus  m in that Place we find a M  morial  the c  nt  ary when Qu  en  Eliza  eth  in the six  h Y  ar of  er  held the Feast of S    George  upon i  proper Day at  Windsor Castle  Namely that there was no  of the  KnightsCompanions  Arms set up there but only the Plates and without all doubt had it been the usage to fix Escutcheons in the Choir of that Chappel as at other Places they would not at that time especially have been omitted because then the Sovereign appeared upon an extraordinary Occasion and where many things were added to heighten the Glory of that Grand Feast by reason the Peace between  England  and  France  was to be proclaimed at this Festival in the presence of the  French  Ambassador and was accordingly done with great Solemnity on St  George  's  Day  in the Morning at the EastEntrance in the lower Ward of the Castle at the top of the Hill towards St  George  's  Chappel  and to which Place the Sovereign in her whole Habit of the  Order  the  French  Ambassador being near her with the five Officers of the  O  der  and  KnightsCompanions  before her and before them the Officers of Arms and Trumpets proceeding in a stately and well ordered Cavalcade and after  Clarenceux  King of Arms had ended the Proclamation they continued the Proceeding thence to the Chappel in the same State and Order  As to the Practice and constant usage of setting up Escutcheons of Arms since  Anno    Edw  VI and at such time as St  George  's  Day  was held elsewhere than at  Windsor  we have seen variety of Testimonies  The care of ordering and providing of which belonged to  Garter  but the Sovereign of the  Order  was at the Charge notwithstanding the said Order  Anno    Edw  VI which heretofore we see was paid out of the Treasury in the Exchequer and since the Establishment of  l per Annum  settled by the late Sovereign King  Charles  I to discharge  he ordinary and extraordinary Expences of the  Order  the Allowance issued thence and was paid  y the Chancellor of the  Order  but now the Charge is placed upon  Garter  he having an Allowance therefore included in the Augmentation of his Pension  Anno    Car  II  We find Privy Seals to have issued as high as the  i  teenth of Queen  E  izabeth  for the Annual Allowance    l  for Escutcheons imployed for the use a  oresaid a  d that the Price some time before was about that rate  r the three and twenty Escutcheons provided against St  George  's  Feast Anno  and  Phil  and  Mar  came to  l    s  and  d  and those five and twenty set up the followi  g  Year  l    s  and  d  some Differences the  also being in the Work which enhanced the Price  viz  those provided for Princes at  s  and  d  a Piece and each of the rest at  s  The Sovereign the Prince of  Wales  and Stranger Kings and Princes have accustomably had at these Times Majesty Escutcheons set up over each of their Stalls but the rest of the  KnightsCompanions  Lodging Escutcheons only and we have seen an Account of some Majesty Escutche  ns prepared for every St  George  's  Feast  from to to wit one for the Sovereign another for the King of  Denmark  a third for the Prince of  Wales  and a fourth for  Frederick  Count Pala  ine of the  R  ine  at  s  and  d  a piece but so many  KnightsCompanions  as attended the Sovereign at those Fea  ts had each a Lodging Escu  cheon at  s  and  d  From the Marshalling of Arms quartered in the  KnightsCompanions  Escutcheons and orde  ing their S  les printed always in  French  there are several things no le  s useful than worthy of Observation for first  though the Plates of Arms and Quarterings fixed in each  KnightCompanions  Stall at  Windsor  continue there without alteration or very seldom changed from that Orde  h  rein they were Marshalled at that Time of their In  t  lation yet these Escutcheons and Stiles Annually set up  o admit of frequent alteration as there is Occasion either by adding more Quarterings altering the Stiles or amending any thing that is amiss  For Instance Whereas the Duke of  Savoy  before  Eliz  b  re  Gules  a  Cross argent  it was then a  te  ed into five Coats that is to say in the first Quar  er  Westphalia Saxe M  derne  and  angrie  in the second  Chablais  in the third  Aouste  and the fourth as the first and over all in the Middle the aforesaid Escutcheon of  Savoy  When the Lord  Hunsdon  was

the greatest and frequentest Variations are in the Stiles and Titles of  Honour  set under the Escutcheons and these relate unto and are occasioned principally from their attaining or resigning of Offices or Dignities  We find that the Stile set under the Escutcheon of  Ferdinand  the Empire at St  George  's  Feast Anno  and  Phil  and  Mar  was as followeth  Du tr  s hault tresExcellent

said Emperor's Stile the T  tl  s of King of  Hungary  and  Bohemia  were left out becau  e  Maximilian  his Son had a little before obtained both those Kingdoms  In the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  the Stiles of  Philip  King of  Spain  who while Queen  Mary  lived was CoSovereign of this most Noble  Order  run thus  Du tres Hault tresExcellent and tresPuissant Prince Philip par la grace de Dieu Roy

Feasts of St  George Anno  and  Eliz  the Title of Catholick Prince was also given him  The Instances relating to  KnightSubjects  are very many there having been almost every Year some Additions or Omissions  In the Duke of  Norfolk  's Stile  Anno    Eliz  the  Lieutenantship of the North  was omitted In the Earl of  Rutland  's at the same Feast  President of the Council in the Council in the North  was added The Marquiss of  Winchester  caused the Title of Baron  St John  to be omitted because his eldest Son bore that Title and was a Baron of Parliament  It may be further observed that a Stranger elect having received the  Habit  and  Ensigns  of the  Order  hath been allowed the Honour of having an Escutcheon of his Arms set on the back of that Stall designed for him notwithstanding he has not been installed  Of Adorning the Chappel  § The Chappel where Divine Service is celebrated at the time of the Grand Feast whether it be that of St  George  's at  Winds  r  or elsewhere as the Sovereign is pleas'd hath at all times been adorn'd with rich Fur  ture the care and oversight whereof at  Windsor  is committed to the Dean of the College but at other Places to the Dean of the Chappel  The  Altar  by the Gift of Pious Benefactors was ad rned with Vessels sumptuous both for their Materials and Workmanship but  temp Hen  VIII and  Edw  VI most of them were disposed of so that King  James  I taking notice that very litt  e Plate and other Ornaments were belonging to the Chappel was pleas'd to make some Provision for the adorning thereof which was at  length effected by the free Contributions of the Knights themselves  For at a  Chapter  held at  WhiteHall    Jac  I it was Decreed that every  KnightCompanion  should give to the use of the  Altar  in the said Chappel a piece of  Plate  of the value of  l  at the least  This Decree was confirm'd  Anno    Car  I the Dean and Canons of  Windsor  being impower'd to demand and receive the Sums of Money as above which they were to bestow in Plate for the use of the  Altar  and accordingly they agreed for the quantity of Plate hereafter mentioned which was deliver'd  Anno    viz     Ou  Dr  Two little Candlesticks chas'd and guilt for Wax Candles      Two Chalices with four Pattens      Two great Candlesticks neat for Tapers      Two little Basons      One great Bason         l  s  The Value at  s  the Ounce came to      Besides nine Cases      But to make some farther addition to the Glory of this  Altar  King  Charles  II at the time of his  Installation  offered two large gilt WaterPots weighing Ounces ten Peny Weight amounting by the excellent Workmanship to  s  the Ounce and to the Sum of  l    s  some sacred Ceremonies were perform'd at the Consecration of this Plate not very necessary to be spoke of here But all these with the other Goods and Monuments belonging to the King's free Chappel and T  easury at  Windsor  were ri  ed and taken away by the Parl  ament Army King  Charles  II therefore after the Re  auration  Anno  by the consent of the  KnightsCompanions  did levy and collect and by his own Bounty furnished the Chappel again with the following Plate  A pair of gilt Flaggons bought with Money collected from the  KnightsCompan  ons  Ounces  A Pair of wrought Flaggons with great Bellies  aving the Figure of St  George  on Horseback on the Cover c bought with the Knights Money    Ounces  One small Bason    Ounces and an half  A pair of plain gilt Chalices and Covers bought also with the Knights Money    Ounces and a quarter  A large Embost Bason with the Figure of  Mary Magdalen  washing our Saviour's Feet    Ounces  A pair of large Taper Candlesticks    Ounces  At the Charge of the College  A pair of large Basons gilt and Emboss'd given by her Royal Highness the Dutchess of  York  Ounces  A plain gilt Corporas the Gift of Sir  Richard  Fanshaw    Ounces  A double gilt Chalice the Gift of the Lady  Mary Heveningham  Ounces  As to the Adorning and Furniture of the Chappel 'tis ver  Sumptuous the particulars being not so very material I shall here omit them  The Furnishing St  George  's  Hall  § The care of making ready and furnishing St  Geo

Ceremonies on the Eve of the Grand Feast  Of the beginning of the Grand Feast  § THE Celebration of the Grand Feast with the Ceremonies devis'd to set forth and illustrate the Glory there  f hath been worthy the observation of the first Institutor and all succeed  ng Sovereigns well knowing that what is once sligh  ly ob  er  'd will soon  all into disesteem if not into contempt There  re they have been very particula  to the Day the Ho  r  and the Place where the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  are to meet  As to the first although St  George  's  D  y  or such other Day as the Sovereign shall please to nominate and ap  oint by Prorogation in lieu thereof be the Principal and Grand Day of the Feast yet the Eve of that Day d  es the Feast take Commencement and determines not till the third Day following the whole Solemnity taking up three Days inclusively  And this is clear from several Articles of the  Statutes  wherein the course of the Ceremonies to be obser  '  at the Grand Solemnity are set down whether observed on the Eve the FeastDay or the Morrow after And these three Days together did the Sovereign hold the Grand Feast whether they personally celebrated the same or deputed other of the  KnightsC  mpanions  to that Employment the cause of the Commissions of Deputation limitting their Power either in general  during the time of the Feast  or in particular upon the Day of St  Georg    the Day and that following  viz  the last Day of the Feast In like manner when in succeeding Times Commissions of Prorogation of the Grand Feast were made use of we find the three Days continuance of the Feast to be particularly mentioned in the Body of those Commissions Namely the Day wherein by such Appointment the Feast was to begin the Grand Day it self  and the Day whereon it ended  The Directions given in the  Statutes  for the Order and Course of this Solemnity to begin with the Eve ru  thus Every Year upon St  George  's  Eve  shall be an Assembly or Meeting of all the  KnightsCompanions  of the  Order  at  Windsor Castle  c and the same is positively enjoin'd by all the other Bod  es of the  Statutes  And as the Grand Feast is generally said to Commence  in Vigilia Sancti Georgii  or as it is otherwise exprest in the  BlackBook  in  Vigilia in future celebratis  or  Vi  Divi Georgii  or in  Vigilia Festi  So has the time of thus preceeding Day several other Denominations given  in the same  Register Vesper ante Diem Sancti Georgii in Vesperiis Georgianis in Vesperiis Fes  i in Vesperiis Commitionem  and at other times  pridie Divi Geo  gii p  idie Georgianae Sole  nitatis pridie Festi p  idie  eriarum Divi Georgii  and sometimes  per vigilia  and lastly in plam  English  St  George  's  Eve  all which signify one and the same thing and are but various Names given to the Evening of the Day foregoing either that of St  George  or that whereon the Grand Feast is appointed to be held by Prorogation  Thus we see that the Founder began his Solemnity upon the Eve of the Feast Day which doubtless was in conformity to the Custom of the Church who made the  Vigils  and  Eves  part of the ensuing Festivals and as Ushers to the Grand Solemnities  As the Eve was appointed by the Founder for the Commencement of the Anniversary of the Grand Feast so to make the time more certain the  Statutes  ex  ress the exact Hour of meeting for beginning the Solemnities to be at the Hour of  Tierce  which in many other Places is called  Hora Tertiarum  But this seemed not sufficient to express clear enough the meaning of a Law where a Penalty was enjoined and there  ore at a  Chapter  held at  Windsor    Edw  IV a scrup  e arising among the  KnightsCompanions  concerning the Words  Hora Te  tiarum  whether they were intended to mean three in the Afternoon or at the Hour of the Church generally used after Prime Noon before and fixed it to the latter  The  Registrum Chartaceum  Records the same Explanation of the Words and to let us see that 'twas immediately put in Practice it is there entered with the Names of those  KnightsCompanions  present with the Sovereign both in the Morning and Evening of the same Day  Another Instance of which there is  Hen  VII on the Eve of the Grand Feast held by Prorogation at  Windsor  where the Sovereign in regard of the arrival of several Ambassadors put off the usual  Chapter  till Noon whence it is evident that the Custom at this time was likewise to begin the Solem  i  y in the Morning  But notwithstanding the said Decree of King  Edw  IV we find it  Anno    Hen  VIII to be meant and in  ended for three in the Af  ernoon And when King  Henry  VIII came to Model the  Statutes  of the  Order  in two several Articles he declares and expounds the  Hora Tortia  which the  English  Version of those  Statutes  renders the  Hour  of  Tierce  to be the  Hora Tertia post Merediem  three in the Afternoon and in another Article of the same  S  atutes Hora Tertiarum id est Hora Te  tiarum p  st Me  edi  m  and elsewhere  Hora Tertia Vespertina vel Pomeridiana  which Hour as it was then settled to be the punctual time for the  KnightsCompanions  meeting to enter on the Solemnity of the Feast so has it ever since continued unaltered and usually observed  The Place of Assembly for the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  hath usually been in such of the Sovereign's Privy Lodgings both at  Windsor  or elsewhere as he hath appointed frequently in the Privy Withdrawing or Bed Chambers To this appointed Place the  KnightsCompanions  repair to give their Attendance on the Sovereign having first invested themselves in full Robes either in their own Lodgings or some convenient Room at Court where  Garter  is to attend them with notice of the approa  hing Hour  The  KnightsCompanions  being come to the Sovereign as likewise the Officers of the  Order  habited in their  Mantles  and bearing in their Hands the  Symbols  of their several Offices they wait the Sovereign's being vested in his Robes till he passes into the Presence Chamber or give beginning to the Feast by opening the  Chapter  at their meeting before he goes thither  Ab  ut the same time the Provincial  Kings He  alds  and  Pursuivants  wearing their Coats of the Sovereign's Arms so also the Band of Pensi  ners armed with their Pole Axes Assemble in the Pre  nce Chamber but the Prebends of the College vested in their Taffa  y Mantles over their S  rplices and  Alms  Knights  in their  Mantles  and  Surcoa    me no nearer than the Guard Chamber  Lastly The Servants and Attendants of the  KnightsCompanions  meet without the Guard Chamber Door whence spreading themselves down the Stairs through the Stone Ga  lery into the upper Ward of the Cast  e or as far as the  r Number will reach all wa  t the Sovereign's c  ming forth into the Presence  It will be necessary here to inform the Reader in r  gard not only the Feast Day of St  G  rge  but the Grand Feast held in Honour of the  O  er  hath been ke  in several other Places besides  Windsor Castle  mo  e particularly at  W  iteHall  St  James  's  Gree  wich  and  Y  k  that there are ma  y Cer  momes and other Particula  s h  r  a  er named which alter not with the Place but appe    a  n to the Festival and are there  e to be observed e  ery  where alike as for instance the form of Proceeding  the manner of holding  Chapters  the Ceremony of Offering Gold and Silver Swearing of Officers and such like But others there are which are precisely local and particular as the  Prebends  and  AlmsKnights  going in the P  oceeding the Offering up of Atchievements c to  Windsor  only  Since the withdrawing the Grand Feast from  Windsor  some of the Officers of Arms curious in the Observation of these Solemnities performed in other P  aces have afforded us great P  nty of Memorials relating to the ceremonious Part thereof while the same was continued at  Windsor  and therefore when the true Place whe  e the Instance lies shall be also cited the Reader is not to conclude that the Preced  nt urged doth not full enough answer the Purpose un  e  s it had been likewise fetched from  Windsor  But that in this case the Cer  m  ny or Example is such as is peculiar to the Feast not the P ace and ought to be observed without alteration at an  Place where the Sovereign shall keep the Grand Feast  Of setting the Proceeding in Order  § In T  mes past the  KnightsCompanions  appeared at the Grand Feast a  ended with a numerous T  ain of Servants and other Dependents but the Feast having removed from  Windsor  to other Places much of this ancient Splendor was laid asi  e yet upon King  James  I Ac  e  sion to the Crow  somewhat of this Glory began to revive for we find it entered upon the  Register  in the fourth of his Reign  That the ancient Custom wh  ch for some Y  s had been intermitted whe  ein at the So  emnity of this Fe  st all the  KnightsCompanions  were wont to g  attended each with a  arge T  ain was recalled and brought back into use  But this heighth of Gallantry and Splendor in the Number of Attendants and ri  hness of their Apparel within ten Years grew up to such Excess or rather Exorbitancy that it required a r  st  a  nt wherefore the Sover  gn by the u  anim  us Advi  e of the  KnightsCompanions  Decreed  nd Commanded  That eve  y one of the  KnightsCompanions  of the  Order  should have to attend upon his Pe  s  n  at the yearly Solemnization of the Feast of the  Order  fifty  ersons and no more  The reason whereof we find elsewhere noted to be for saving of Charge and avoiding of Emulation But in the beginning of King  Charles  I Reign of ever Blessed Memory the gallantry of Attendants began again to Increase and Augment insomuch that at the Grand Feast held at  WhiteHall  the d d and th of  April Anno    Car  I we find it observed that the  KnightsCompanions  came forth attended each with a Train of Servants very richly clad  But to return and enter upon the Proceeding to the end the Servants and Attendants of the  KnightsCompanions  may be exactly Marshalled the Usher of the Hall whose Duty it is to rank them ought to call for a List from  Garter  of such  KnightsCompanions  as are to be present at the Grand Feast noted with their several Places in the Proceeding for his better Directions in assigning the Attendants their due Places the Order whereof is thus First the  Junior  KnightsAttendants proceed one before another on the left Hand upon whose right Hand the second eldest KnightsAttendants go in equal Rank with them for this we observe to have been the gene  al rule where the  KnightsCompanions  Proceed in pairs the  r Attendants go together those belonging to the  Senior  Knights of the two on the right Hand and to the  Junior  u  on their left but the Order is otherwise where any of the  KnightsCompanions  proceed single and alone which often falls out as shall be noted in its due Place for then the Attendants belonging to that single Knight go two and two on both sides the Way opposite one against the other  But when the Grand Feast is Celebrated at  White+Hall  there the  KnightsCompanions  Attendants are Marshalled by the said Usher on both sides the Passage from the outward Door of the Guard Chamber down into the Hall taking up all the Room as far as the old Chappel and because here they do not proceed in regard of the shortness of the Processional way but only make a stand for the Proceeding to pass through them they are ranked in a way d  fferent from that used at  Windsor  nevertheless relating more especially to the Order ob  erved by their Masters Which Method in the Sovereign's Proceed  ng to the Chappel at the befo  ementioned Feast  held at  WhiteHall Anno    Car  I we find thus described The eldest  KnightCompanions  Servants were ranked on the right Hand of the Passage the chiefest of them near unto the old Chappel Door and the second Knight being Companion to the eldest his Attendants stood on the le  side the chiefest of them also next the said old Chappel Door and in case the e  dest Knight's Fellow or Companion be not present in this Proceeding then the eldest Knight's Servants ought to be placed opposite one against the other u  on each side the said old Chappel Door The like Order is to be tak  n in Marshalling the Servants of the other Knights of this most Noble  Order  whose Companions are  hen absent  Secondly The Order of Proceeding amongst the  AlmsKnights  who  Anno    Car  I had two Waiters of the So  ereign's Ha  l in their Livery Coats bearing white Rods in their Hands to pr  ceed before them is in general two and two together the  Junior  is placed foremost on the left Hand and his next  Senior  on his right and if Sickness or other la  ful Impediment chance to hinder one or more of them fr  m going in the Proceeding his  Junior  is advanc'd into his Place and consequently all the other  Juniors  do in like manner alter their Places and adva  ce to the end the superior Place be still supplied accor  ing to the right rule of Marshalling the Singles that compose a gross Body but in this Case if the Number that attend happen to be odd the Governor of the  AlmsKnights  goes last of all and alone  Thirdly The Virger of the College hath his Place next after the  AlmsKnights  and immediately before the  P  ebends  of the College who being habited in a Gown beareth a Silver Ve  ge the Ensign of his Office Nevertheless hereto  ore when the  Prebends  went not in the Proceeding on the Eve of the Grand Feast the Virger proceeded first of all before the  AlmsKnights  for so it was observed on the Eve of St  George  at  Windsor Anno    Eliz  and in this manner we see it exprest in the Pr  ceeding set forth by  Marcus Gercha  d  Fourthly Under the general rule relating to the  AlmsKnights  are comprehe  ded the  Prebends  of the College the  Pu suivants Heralds  and  Provincial Kings  insomuch that where either of the said K  ngs are absent the  Senior  erald  is adva  ced and goes in breast on the left Hand of  him who is then present so also where any of the  Heralds  are wanting his next  Junior  ascendeth into his Place whereby it sometimes falls out that the  Senior Pursuivant  is joined to the left Hand of the  Junior Herald  And through their defects and absence the Number of the Officers of Arms be odd then with this difference in the foresaid rule observed among the  AlmsKnights  the youngest  Pursuivant  goeth single by himself  Touching the right of Precedency between the Officers of Arms and  Prebends  of the College in Proceeding before the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  we find there hath been heretofore not only some Question started but the Place contended for insomuch that at the In  tallation of the Earls of  Shrewsbury  and  Cumberland Anno    Eliz  the  Prebends  took Place and upon the th of  May Anno    Eliz  at the Installation of  Thomas  Lord  Howard  of  Walden  and others the  Prebends  again endeavoured to pass between the Officers of Arms and Officers of the  Order  but  Charles  Lord  Howard  of  Effingham  then Lieutenant to the Sovereign delivered his Opinion on the behalf of the Officers of Arms against the  Prebends  Yet did not this so settle the  Order  of Precedency or quiet the  Prebends  but that the Contention again broke out  Anno    Jac  I at the Installation of the Earls of  Pembrook  Ma  r Southampton  and Duke of  Lenox  which happened on the ninth not second of  July  in the foresaid Year even to such a heighth that the  Prebends Pursuivants  and  Heralds  contended in the Proceeding but the Controversy was on  he next Morning composed by the Lord Admiral then the Sovereign's Lieutenant the Lord Treasurer and the Earl of  Wo  cester  and the  Order  in Proceeding thus set  led first That the  AlmsKnights  should go foremost the  Pursuivants  next then the  Prebends  a  d then the  Heralds  and Kings of Arms and this Order in Proceeding was afterwards observed on the  May Anno    Jac  I at the Installation of the Earl of  Salisbu  y  and Viscount  Bindon  as also the  May Anno  of the same King at the Installation of the Earls of  Du  bar  and  Montgomery  How  eit  Anno    Jac  I and so afterwards we do not find th  Pursuivants  mentioned in the Proceeding by part  cul  r N  me nor otherwi  e than in this following Order  viz AlmsKnights Prebends Heralds  c but it may be presumed that the  Pursuivants  then joined again in Body with the  Heralds  though for some Years before  ivided from them by the interposition of the  Prebends  as well as the Provincial Kings and all of them under the Title of  Heralds  and sometimes Officers of Arms  And though at the Grand Feast held by Prorogation on Sunday the th of  September  in the said fifteenth Year of King  James  it is noted that the Prince being then the Sovereign's Lieutenant proceeded to Morning Service on the Feast Day with the  AlmsKnights Heralds Prebends  and Officers of the  Order  before him from which manner of Expression it may perchance be supposed that the  Heralds  went at that time next after the  AlmsKnights  and before the  Prebends  nevertheless elsewhere we find them on the Eve of the aforesaid Feast ranked in this following Order  The AlmsKnights  The Prebends  The Officers of Arms  The Knights of the Order c  And doub  less they proceeded in the same Order to the Chappel on the next Morning notwithstanding what is before said to the contrary those Expressions being interwoven with the general Account given of the Ceremonies of the whole Festival and more subject to mistake where the relation of the Proceeding is carried on in a continued D  scourse than were ranked as is before exhibited in particular Lines and in the Order and Form of a Proceeding Bes  es we no where meet with any Order or Decree nulling the foresaid Determination made  Anno    Jac  I which placeth the  Prebends  before the  Heralds  Finally to give an end to the Disputes in this Point we find that up  n the E  e of this Feast held at  Windsor  the and of  November Anno    Car  I the  Prebends  proceeded next before the  Pu  suivants  and the  Pu  suivants  immediately before the  Heralds  and Provincial Kings that is to say all the Officers of Arms except  Garter  whose Place is elsewhere proceeded in one en  ire Body together which Order we find to be the same in all Proceed  gs after that we have met with and was  so observed at the Grand Feast held at  Windsor Anno    Car  II and ever since But to proceed  All the before mentioned Attendants wait in their several Stations till the Hour of  Tierce  when the Sove  eign having the  KnightsCompanions  and Officers of the  Order  before him and his Train carried up passeth towards the Presence Chamber notice of whose coming being given the Band of Pensioners make the accustomed Guard and Passage along the Presence Chamber the  Seniors  standing towards the Lobby Door within which Guard on the other side the Officers of Arms place themselves Upon the same warning the Yeomen of the Guard clear a like Passage from the Presence Chamber Door along the Guard Chamber unto its outward Door for the Proceeding to pass through  At the Sovereign's approach one of the Gentlem  n Ushers attended with the Sword of State the Point resting upon the Ground delivereth to such one of the N  bility not being a Knight of the  Order  whom the S  vereign as an honorary Favour hath before nominated to bear it from thence before him in all the Proceedings of the Feast during which Action the  KnightsCompanions  proceed forwards and being entred the Presence Chamber Flank on each side the State with some small distance between them and there make a stand The S  vereign being also entred passeth to the Step before the State the Nobleman who beareth the Sword and the five Officers of the  Order  retiring a little on his right Hand and then turning himself towards the  KnightsCompanions  standeth there a while until they have made their Reverences unto him which being performed he resaluteth the  KnightsCompanions  by putting off his Cap This done the Sovereign pu  teth his Cap on again whereupon every of the  KnightsCompanions  putteth on theirs and immediately Rank themselves according to their due Place on both sides the State  For the right understanding whereof we are in the fifth place to Note that in the Order and Method wherein the  KnightsCompanions  are ranked if they be all  r  sent is two and two  ogether the  Junior  forem  st on the left Hand for that is his Place in all Proceedings but where any of them be absent the rule is d  ff  r  nt from that appropriate to the beforementioned D  gre    for though it be recorded that upon the Eve of the Grand Feast held at  Windsor Anno    Hen  V the  KnightsCompanions  went in Order to the  ChapterHouse  and  Choir  yet this being exprest but in general terms how it ought to be understood will more fully appear from the particular Directions given for the Order of the  KnightsCompanions  Proceeding in King  Henry  VIII's Stat  tes where the Law directs each  KnightCompanion  to proceed a  one at such time as his Fellow who possesse  h the Stall opposite unto him is absent but the Order of such Proceeding will by a Scheme be made more evident  The Proceeding of the  KnightsCompanions  present on the Eve of St  George  to the Closet at  WhiteHall Anno Eliz  The Lord  Hunsdon  Void  The Lord  Ro  ert Dudley  The Viscount  Mountague  The Lord  Loughborow  The Earl of  Sh  ewsbury  The Earl of  Sussex  The Lord  Howard  of  Essing  Void  The Earl of  Westmo  land  The Marquiss of  North  Void  The Lord  Clynton  The Duke of  Norfolk  Void  The Eatl of  Pembrook  Thus four  KnightsCompanions  proceeded alone in regard the Stalls opposite to them were void the three first being absent and the last void by the Death of the Earl of  Huntington  and to avoid all disputes in relation to Precedency King  Henry  VIII Decreed in the sixteenth Year of his Reign  That each  KnightCompanion  should take Place in Procession Station or sitting at the Table thence forward as he had his Seat or Stall in the Choir and not according to the Degree of his Bi  th or Condition unless the Sovereign was pleased that any should be made Choice of according to the N  bility of his Family to sit at the end of his own Table or perform any other thing by the by  The Proceeding among the Officers of the  Order  differeth from all before spoken of for being five in Number the three inferior Officers when all present March in a breast and of later Times the  Register  in the middle  Garter  on his right Hand and the  Usher  of the  BlackRed  on his left  After these three Officers the two superior proceed together the  Prelate  on the Right and the  Chancellor  on the left and after the Officers of the  Order  follow the Sword which is carried immediately before the Sovereign In the beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign it was born by some of the Barons but of later Times it hath been conferr'd on Persons of higher Rank as  Anno    Car  I on the Earl of  Dover Anno    Car  I on the Earl of  Danby  and  Anno    Car  II on the Lord Viscount  Mordant  then Constable of the Castle of  Windsor  and at this Time 'tis usually born by none under the Degree of an Earl  The Sovereign's Place in the Proceeding  notandum quod superior Ordinis tempore Processionis in dicta Capella transibit retro totam Sociarum Comitivam  which though the  Statute  mentions here to be performed at the Grand Procession yet it refers to all those times the Sovereign proceeds to or from no less than within the Chappel In ancient Time the Sovereign if he were at  Windsor  to celebrate the Grand Feast proceeded to the Chappel in Person as well on the Eve as on the Feast Day Queen  Elizabeth  being the first who went not to the Chappel on the Eve of the Feast unless we except King  Henry  VI who by reason of Sickness was necessitated to make a Deputy in his stead The aforesaid Omission of Queen  Elizabeth  was first occasioned through Indisposition of Health though she afterwards without that necessity did not comply as in the and Years of her Reign which gave occasion to King  James  to make Deputies at those three Grand Feasts he Celebrated at  Windsor  and the like did King  Charles  I in the first Year o  his Reign but in the fourth Year of his Reign the ancient Custom for many Years intermitted was restored and the Sovereign making no Lieutenant proceeded to the Chappel not only on that Eve but always observed it afterwards as did King  Charles  II in all the Grand Feasts he held and is now observed  It will be necessary to take notice that the Proceeding begins from the Presence Chamber call'd in the  Statutes  the Great Chamber a Scheme whereof on the Eve of the Grand Feast is here exhib  ted  The Attendants on the KnightsCompanions  AlmsKnights  Virger of the Chappel  Prebends of  Windsor  Officers of Arms  KnightsCompanions  BlackRod  Register  Garter  Chancellor  Prelate  The Sword  The Sovereign  Trainbearers  Captain of the Pensioners  Pensioners  To the foregoing Proceeding have been occasionally receiv'd some Persons of Quality and others Eminent in Place a  d Degree though their Offices do not particularly relate to this most Noble  O  der  but are admitted by reason of their requisite Attendance on the Sovereign in his Proceedings on all Occasions  On St  George  's  Eve Anno    Eliz  the old Ambassador of  Sweden  accompanied by the Earl of  Hertford  went in the Proceeding to the Closet at  WhiteHall  next after the Trainbearers and immedia  ely before the Ladies At  endants on the Sovereign and the next Morning when the Sovereign proceeded to the Chappel the new Ambassador of  Sweden  went in the same Place  As to those admitted on the Account of their Offices is the Lord Chamb  rlain though not a Knight of the  Ga  ter  and is allowed Place somewhat behind on the  ght Hand of the Sovereign and the Vice Chamberlain on the left  The Dean of the Sovereign's Chappel at  WhiteHall  attends when the Proceedings are thither going a little  e  in  the Sovereign towards his left Hand next goes the Clerk of the Clo  et then the Master of the Robes as also one of the Masters of Requests and then the Gentlemen of the Robes  Of the Proceeding to the  ChapterHouse  §  Having under the precedent Head treated at large of the Rank and Place of all those that pass in the Proceeding wherein all are Bareheaded except the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  I now come to the Place whither the Proceeding is directed  The first Solemn Action on the Entrance of the Grand Feast which the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  are obliged to perform is to Celebrate a  Chapter  to which end it hath been most usual for them to proceed from the Presence Chamber  every one in their due Place and Order  first to the  ChapterHouse  to consult of things of course and next into the  Choir  to hear Divine Service which has been the constant Custom from the Reign of King  Henry  V as many Examples recorded in the Registers of the  Order  evidence  As this Custom of holding a  Chapter  on the Eve of the Grand Feast was constantly observed when celebrated without Prorogation so also hath a  Chapter  been in like manner held before  Vespers  on the Eve at such time as the Feast Day of St  George  only hath been observ'd when for any cause the Anniversary of the Grand Feast receiv'd Prorogation As for Instance  Anno    Mary  a  Chapter  was held at the Mannor of St  James  's on the  Vigil  of St  George  before the first  Vespers  whereunto is fixt this Note  ut moris est  and the Grand Feast f  r that Year receiv'd Adjournment until the coming of  Philip  then Prince after King of  Spain  In like manner though the Celebration of the Grand Feasts were removed from  Windsor  and observed at other Places yet this usual Custom of holding a  Chapter  on the Eve was always practised after which the proceeding to Evening Prayer succeeded as is manifest by several Testimonies from the  Registers  The publick processional way to the  ChapterHouse  at  Windsor  used Time out of Mind led from the Presence Chamber through the Cloister and the great Gate of the King's Lodging to the upper Ward of the Castle thence through the middle Ward and part of the lower to and through the Passage between the East End of the Chappel  and  TombHouse  and thence into the  ChapterHouse  Situate on the North East Corner of St  George  's  Chappel  But the Sovereign hath sometimes thought fit to wave this publick processional way and pass along the private way which leads from the King's Privy Chamber down the Stairs into the Terrace  viz  through that stately Walk lying on the North side of the Castle and entring again at a Door heretofore made through a part of the Castle Wall into one of the Canons Lodgings adjoining to  Winchester Tower  now made up went thence through the Cloisters proceeding in the Order before shewed  We shall close this Head with observing that though the Proceedings to the  ChapterHouse  or Chappel on the Eve of the Feast have most commonly been on Foot yet have they been also on Horseback on extraordinary Occasions as  Anno    Hen  VII at which Time several Ambassadors being arrived here from Foreign Kings and Princes they and many of the Nobility of this Kingdom with the King's Council the two Archbishops the Bishops of  Lincoln  and  Ely  and the Chief Justice of the King's Bench repaired also thither and on the Eve the Sovereign accompanied with the  KnightsCompanions  rode from the upper Quadrangle down to the College The Queen and the King's Mother rode in a Chair covered with rich Cloth of Gold drawn by six Coursers finely Harnass'd and twenty one Ladies habited in Crimson Velvet rode on white Palfries Sir  Roger Cotton  Master of the Queen's Horse led her Horse of State whereon was a Saddle of Cloth of Gold and three Crowns of Silver gilt as soon as they alighted the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  proceeded to the  ChapterHouse  and thence to Evening Song which ended they return'd in the Order they came  King  Henry  VIII in the eleventh Year of his Reign at three a Clock in the Afternoon with all the  KnightsCompanions  in the Habit of the  Order  proceeded from the Presence Chamber in  WindsorCastle  till they came to the Quadrangle where they took their Horses and rode according to their Stalls not according to their Estate next before the King and thence rode to the middle Door of the Chappel and there alighted and proceeded without the  Choir  to the  ChapterHouse  there are other Examples but these may suffice  Of the opening of the  Chapter  § The Proceeding being arriv'd at the Entrance into the Chappel first the Attendants on the  KnightsCompanions  divide themselves as they enter beginning at the outward Door and Flank on each side the North Isle of the Chappel and so toward the West Door of the  Choir  making a stand along the Isle for the  AlmsKnights Virgers Prebends  and  Officers  of  Arms  to pass through them who go on towards the said West Door and when the  Junior KnightsCompanions  are entred into the Chappel the Proceeding makes a stand while all the  KnightsCompanions  following turn aside on the right Hand into the  ChapterHouse  next the Officers of the  Order  and lastly the Sovereign but the Nobleman that carries the Sword the Trainbearers Pensioners c stay without the  ChapterHouse  Door in the North Isle none being admitted in but the Sovereign the  KnightsCompanions  and the Officers of the  Order  who being all entred the Door is shut by the Gentleman Usher of the  BlackRod  and every Person severally takes his due Place and Station whereupon the  Chapter  immediately opens  In what Manner and Order the Sovereign  KnightsCompanions  and Officers of the  Order  are ranked at the holding of a  Chapter  is describ'd  Anno    Hen  VIII when the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  consulted in the  ChapterHouse  on the Reformation and Explanation of the  Statutes  of the  Order  The Sovereign on his Entrance proceeded to the midst of the Northend of the Table the  KnightsCompanions  whose Stalls in the  Choir  were on the Sovereign's side took the right Hand of the Table and those of the Princes side the left then the Prelate of the  Order  came and stood on the Sovereign's right Hand at the corner of the Table    Register  and  Garter  were at the lower end and  BlackRod  kept the  ChapterHouse  Door on the inside The Chancellor of the  Order  is not there mention'd as not being present yet his Place is on the Sovereign's left Hand of the Table  If the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  arrive at the  ChapterHouse  so late that the Business necessary to be done  cannot be discuss'd without putting off the Celeb  ation of  Vespers  beyond the Canonical Hour it hath been usual to adjourn the Debates till the next Morning as was done  Anno    Car  I  Transactions in the  Chapter  held before the  Vespers  § When the  Chapter  held before the  Vespers  is opened and no Adjournment given thereto all things are then to be provided for which concern the Honour and Dignity of this most Noble  Order  The matters of course are first Swearing and adm  tting Officers secondly Debating about the  KnightsCompanions  then absent and either dispensing with or inflicting Penalties on them and thirdly Constituting or appointing an Officer to carry on the State and Solemnity of the Feast in the Sovereign's absence But other Particulars that are occasional cannot so well be brought within Rule as being wholly accidental  As to the first the Officers of the  Order  soon after the  Chapter  is open'd take their respective Oaths in Order to perform the Duty of their several Places during the Session of the  Chapter  and thenceforward as is evident from several Examples but one may suffice from a  Chapter  held at  Windsor Anno    Car  I whereat Dr  Neal  Bishop of  Winchester  was Swo  n Prelate Sir  Francis Crane  Chancellor and Dr  Mathew Wren  Bishop of  Ely  Register  It hath sometimes happened that some of the Officers of this  Order  have been Sworn at other Times as at  Chapters  next ensuing their Nomination and Choice wherein the Administration of the Oath is one of the first things done  Touching the second particular debated in  Chapter viz  the dispensing with or punishing absent Knights it is to be considered that the  Statutes  of the  Order  enjoin all the  KnightsCompanions  to be present at the Celebration of the Grand Feast that is those that are within the Kingdom or elsewhere although the Service of St  George  according to the Rites of the Church be not celebrated as on the Service of the Day whereon that of St  George  has fallen  viz GoodFriday  But with this Limitation  so that they be in a capacity or may conveniently repair thither  Therefore the next thing usually entred upon in the  Chapter  is the Sovereign's and  KnightsCompanions  taking notice whether any of the Fellowship make default of coming at the Hour assign'd and if so they are considered under one of these Heads First Stranger Princes Secondly Late Commissioners who are arrived or every Minute expected and Thirdly Such as have given notice that they cannot be present during the continuation of the Feast Of these Excuses of course verbal Apologies or Letters of Excuse are or may be offered and in case they are approved or admitted then the Penance which by the  Statutes  ought otherwise to be inflicted is admitted all which ought to be recorded  Stranger Princes are excused in course on Account of their necessary Residence in their own Territories and of their Excuses and accustom  d Dispensations are divers Instances in the Registers of the  Order  As to  KnightsCompanions  who are tardy in their Journey or being come to the Castle fall short of the Hour or of attending the Sovereign to the  ChapterHouse  either through negligence or want of timely notice or other accident the  Statutes  enjoin for Penance that they be not permitted for that time to enter into the  Chapter  but tarry without the Door and not have Voice in any thing that shall happen to be done there unless they can alledge a just Excuse or render such a sufficient cause as the Sovereign or his Deputy shall approve of but few defa  lters have been noted of this kind  The third sort of Delinquents are those  KnightsCompanions  absent not only at the Hour of  Tierce  but are likely to be so during the whole Feast the Proceedings relating to them are either upon what is offered in Excuse of their absence or determined on their neglect of making Apology for it  Excuses for absence are either by Letters or Word of Mouth if by Letters they are directed to the Chancellor of the  Order  or else the Sovereign sends to his Lieutenant on their behalf and both are produc'd by the Chancellor But if Excuses be made by Word of Mouth then are they delivered by the Sovereign himself or on m  tion  made by some of the  KnightsCompanions  present in  Chapter  The Custom of sending Letters has been very ancient The Lord  Powis  's Letter under his Hand and Seal certifying his Indisposition of Body was produc'd in  Chapter Anno    Hen  V And the following Year the Dukes of  York Norfolk  and  Buckingham  with the Earls of  Salisbury Shrewsbury  and  Pembrook  Viscount  Bourchier  the Lord  Rivers  and Sir  John Falstaff  being all absent from St  George  's  Feast they declared the reason of their absence by their Messengers  There are many Precedents of this kind and of Letters sent from the Sovereign directed to his Lieutenant to accept of  KnightsCompanions  Excuses whose absence he had beforehand dispenc'd with we observe those Dispensations excus'd not the sending their own particular Excuses for it is evident they were also expected and that such allowance of absence was not Absolute the Clause running thus  That you the Sovereign's Deputy allow these Excuses so far as are consonant to reason  And in all other Letters of the same nature a Clause to this Effect hath been inserted  That as the Sovereign thought good to advertise his Deputy that for certain Causes he had dispenc'd with their Attendance for that time so he will'd him to accept their reasonable Excuses in that behalf accordingly  Secondly The absent  KnightsCompanions  have had their Excuses frequently made by Word of Mouth either of the Sovereign or some other of the  KnightsCompanions  present in the  Chapter  This Favour is done  ither by the Sovereign himself if present or by his Order to the Lieutenant in his absence  There have been many Examples of what hath been done in this Case and also when the Sovereign hath not been present in  Chapter  but hath beforehand verbally given his Deputy or Lieutenant direction to excuse th  absence of several  KnightsCompanions  It will be necessary to observe what Effect the Excuses have usually produc'd whereinto we find the just and rea  onable favourably admitted some suspended  and divers disallowed Those easily allow'd were first  Sickness for those of the  KnightsCompanions  who have been either Sick far spent with Age or intent on publick Affairs have been readily allow'd  Secondly The no  recovery of Wounds receiv'd in the publick Service  as we meet with in the Case of Sir  William Harington Anno    Hen  V whom we see excus'd  for his Illness occasion'd from his Wounds then lately receiv'd at the Siege of  Rohan  and elsewhere  Thirdly Impotency and old Age Fourthly Imployment in the Sovereign's Service either Abroad or at Home those Abroad are necessarily excus'd those at Home we shall be more particular to The Earl of  Shrewsbury Anno    Eliz  was taken up in certain Affairs enjoin'd him by the Sovereign the Earl of  Huntington    Eliz  being President of the Council of the North his absence was for that and several Years following favourably excus'd and a like Case was that of the Earl of  Danby Anno    Car  I who for his necessary Attendance at the Seat of Justice in  Eyre  was excus'd waiting on the Sovereign at the Grand Feast that Year Fifthly  When the Grand Feast hath receiv'd Prorogation and any of the  KnightsCompanions  have not had notice of the Day whereunto it was prorogued  Sixthly  When any o  them have been in Captivity  as was  Thomas  Earl of  Salisbury  and the Earl of  Huntington  both P  isoners in  France Anno    Hen  VI Seventhly When any of them have obtain'd the Sovereign's Letters of Dispensation of which sufficient is spoken before Lastly  Some other just and lawful Occasion  as well as Accident having fallen out not relating to those under the former Heads the Sovereign on Information given in  Chapter  hath been pleas'd  o allow of as in the Case of the Lord  Fauconbridge Anno    Hen  VI was readily admitted on his pleading  the care of his Domestick Affairs he having been lately in Prison and had obtained leave to go and see his House and Lands in the Country  The Earl of  A undel  's absence  Anno    Car  I was pardon'd by reason of the Dutchess of  Richmond  's Death who died on the Eve of the Grand Feast that so he being the chief of her Family might be at Hand to advise and assist in all things conducing to the Honour of the deceased Dutchess  And as the  KnightsCompanions  have been often excus'd for not appearing on the Grand Feast so hath the Sovereign on sufficient Grounds been pleas'd to license and dispence with their departure from the same of this is an Example  Eliz  when the Lord  Hastings  of  Loughborough  alling Ill a little before the Offering on St  George  's  Day  obtain'd Licence from the Sovereign to depar  out of the  Choir  and came no more abroad that Day nor during the Feast As also another in the Duke of  Lenox Anno    Car  I  The Deputy Chancellor having by Command of the Sovereign and in discharge of the Duty of his Office  who being forc'd to go back to  London  by reason of the aforesaid Dutchess of  Richmon  's Death had his Excuse and the Sovereign's Licence for departure  We are next to consider Excuses which though sent i  due time yet on Debate in  Chapter  were suspended rather than allow'd to which Head may be referr'd that Case of several of the  KnightsCompanions  who were Members of the Lord's House in the long Parliament For  Anno    Car  I the Deputy Chancellor having by the Command of the Sovereign and in discharge of the Duty of his Office sent to each of them a Summons for their Attendance at the Celebration of the Grand Feast to be held for the preceeding Year at  York  and notice thereof being given to the House of Lords they immediately made the ensuing Order  Die Martis Maii  Whereas the Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshould and some other Lords of Parliament Knights of the  Garter  have been Summoned to give their Attendance and repair into the City of  York  for the Celebration of St  George  's Feast who acquainting this House with the Summons aforesaid it is this Day ordered by the Lords in Parliament that they attend the weighty Affairs of the Kingdom discussed in Pa  liament whereunto they are obliged by his Majesty's Writ and the Law of the Land  Jo Browne Cleric Parliament  Whereupon the said  KnightsCompanions  before the Days appointed by Prorog  ion for holding the Feast sent their p  i  ionary Letters of Excuse to the Deputy Chancellor wherein they profess'd their desire and readiness to attend in Obedience of the said Summons never  heless pleaded the fore  aid  Order  for the Ground of their stay in  ondon  and therefore desired him to obtain for them the Sovereign's Dispensation On producing the said Letters  n  Chapter  the Sovereign would not at that time either admit  or disallow of their Excuses but referr'd the consideration to the next  Chapter  to be held by Prorogation  Of Excuses which have not been allow'd the most remarkable is that of the Duke of  Norfolk  and the Lord  Scales Anno    Hen  VI who were adjudg'd to the Penalty of the Statute in regard the Causes alledged to excuse their absence were not approved the latter was signed by the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  in a Jewel to the value of twenty Marks to be offered in the College whereby the rigour of the  Statutes  appears to have been more strictly executed on him than the Duke probably because the Lord  Scales  was absent the Year before and no cause thereof shewed to the  Chapter  In relation to the Proceedings on the absent  KnightsCompanions  neglect of sending their Excuses we shall observe that some of them have with difficulty been remitted some left in suspence and others sentenc'd and referr'd either to the Sovereign's pleasure or the Punishment assign'd by Law of the first kind we find that the Earl of  Westmorland Anno    Hen  V though not very well yet had much ado to be excus'd because he signified not the Cause of his absence as the  Statutes  required So  Anno    Car  I the Earls of  Derby  and  Kelly  having made no Excuse were for that Omission blameable but by the Grace of the Sovereign for that time pardon'd  As to those who through the indulgence of the Sovereign where probable cause hath induc'd it have not had Sentence pass'd on them presently but were deferr'd in expectation of some satisfactory Cause to be shewed we find in the Case of the Prince the Duke of  Buckingham  and five other  KnightsCompanions  absent from the Feast held  Anno    Hen  VII wherein it is registred that  no cause of Excuse was shewed but there was an expectation of one to be alledged  But as for those of the third sort on whom Sentence hath pass'd they have been left either to the pleasure of the Sovereign or to those Penalties which the Law of this  Order  inflict of which as also of those on whom Judgment hath pass'd are divers Instances  Besides these Grounds of assigning Penances there are other Causes set down in the before recited ninth Article of the  Statutes  of I  stitution for Penances as when the  Knig  ts Companions  are absent at other times beside the  Hour of  Tierce  that is the beginning of the first  Vespers  Secondly At the beginning of the Morning Service on the Feast Day Thirdly At the beginning of the second  Vespers  Fourthly During the whole Feast And Fifthly at the Grand Feast next following  For the first admitting any  KnightCompanion  hath failed of meeting and attending on the Sovereign at the Hour of  Tierce  and thereupon suffered the Punishment of Nonadmittance into the  ChapterHouse  and deprivation of Vote nevertheless if at the rising of the said  Chapter  he be not ready to proceed with the Sovereign and other the  KnightsCompanions  into the  Choir  to the beginning of the first  Vespers  he ought not only to suffer the former but this additional Penalty that he shall not presume to Enter into his Stall at that time but tarry in that part of the  Choir  where the Taperbearers are wont to stand nevertheless before his own Stall until the holy Offices be ended and the Law of the  Order  is the same in King  Henry  V's and King  Henry  VIII's  Statutes  only render the Place for the Delinquent Knight to stand in to be before the Stalls in the Choiristers Places and now how the Penalty hath been inflicted upon breach of the Law in this particular we shall see by the following Instances  At the Grand Feast celebrated at  Windsor An    H  VII when it seems the Lord  Kildare  Sir  Gilbert Talbot  and Sir  Richard Goulford  came late to the Chappel we find this Memorandum fixt to their Names they stood without before their Stalls by the Sovereign's Permission or rather Command But yet this is not all the Punishment which hath been inflicted upon the  KnightsCompanions  for this Offence though it be all that is set down in the foresaid Article  for  Anno    Hen  VI upon the Eve of St  George  the Marquiss of  D  rset  not coming to the first  Vespers  and being convicted of his late coming was prohibited joining in the Nomination then made for the Election of the King of  Portugal  into the room of the Duke of  Gloucester  Offenders in the second and third Case being such as neglect to come before the beginning of the high Mass or the second  Vespers  called also the  Vespers  on St  George  's  Day  have the like Punishment with the former assigned them throughout all the Bodies of the  Statutes viz  Exclusion from their Stalls and Station in the Choiristers Range  Anno    Hen  VI We observe the Lord  Willoughby  noted to be absent upon the Eve of the Grand Feast but present on the Day and conseque  ly he incurred no  urther Penance than what his absence on the Eve drew on him  the Earl of  Derby Anno    Eliz  coming too late to the first Morning Service on the Feast Day did for some short time undergo the same Penance but soon after upon Dispensation from the Lieutenant went up to his Stall  There are several other Instances and besides the aforesaid Defaults he is likewise to undergo the same Penalties when the Grand Feast is prorogued or celebrated at any other Place than  Windsor  ut if he offend in all and have no reasonable or allowable Excuse for his absence he is then prohibited ensering his Stall at the next Feast and to pay ten Pounds  o be employed towards the Ornaments of the College and sometimes the former Penance has been inflicted for late coming to Divine Service  The fourth degree of Offence is yet greater than any and the variety of Penances are heightened If a  KnightCompanion  shall neglect coming to the Grand Feast and have no allowable reason he shall not at the Feast held the ensuing Year be permitted to enter his own Stall but stand below it he shall walk alone by himself before three Crosses which in ancient time were born in the Grand Procession When the Grand Procession returns to the  Choir  he shall stand in the Place aforesaid  ill the time of the Offertory he shall Offer last by himsel  and then humbly approach the Stall of the Sovereign or his Deputy and there desire Absolution Bu  there is no Instance that these Rigours were put in Ex  ution though many have offended in this kind  Lastly The  Statutes  enjoin That where a  KnightCompanion  remains within the Kingdom and shall be Guilty of an Omission two Years together he ought to b  so long interdicted his Stall till he have offered a Jewel at St  George  's  Altar  to the Value of twenty Marks and thenceforward every Year in which he shall be guilty of the same Omission the Penalty to be doubled till  e is pardoned The most memorable Case in the Prosecu  ion  of a Contempt was against the Earl of  Arunde    Edw  IV who for being absent two Years together was Mul  t forty Marks and continuing his Contempt the next Year was fined the Sum of eighty Marks  Touching the Necessity and Power of the Sovereign's constituting a Deputy it was provided for at the Institution of the  Order  the Sovereign being then engaged in the Wars of  France  thought it reasonable that Provision should be made by the  Statutes  for to depute some Person in his stead  When therefore such Occasion happened a Commission was made out to one of the  KnightsCompanions  some reasonable time before the approach of the Feast so that none of the ancient Ceremonies might be omitted or any Impediment happen through his absence and such Deputy hath usually been one of the chief of the  Order  in Authority Eminence or Birth The first so made was  John  Duke of  Bedford    Hen  V and the reason thereof given in the  Registrum Chartaceum  is because the Sovereign was then employed in the Wars in  Normandy  And though the Title given by the  Statutes  to this Officer be not particularly mentioned in the  BlueBook  where it speaks of the said Duke's holding the Feast of St  George  that Year but rather implied in the Words  Regiae Sublimatis locum imp  evit  yet in the  Registrum Chartaceum  it is expresly set down and the said Duke there styled  Depute de l'Ordre de Jaritiere  Sometimes he has been styled  Deputatis O  dinis praeses clarissima Ordinis  c  About the beginning of the Reign of King  Henry  VIII the Title of  Locum Tenens  or Lieutenant began to be taken up and has for the most part continued in all succeeding Times and the other Titles of Deputy President and Vicegerent laid aside As to the Business of this Officer sufficient has been said already As an Essential Honour to his Place he has from ancient Time had some of the  KnightsCompanions  assigned for his Assistants the first mention of which is in the  Registrum Chartaceum    Hen  VIII The Number of these Assistants were in those times uncertain at the time a  oresaid they were  Hen  VIII and  Hen  VIII we find but two which Number has been a constant Rule ever since  except once  viz  the last of  Hen  VIII They were always appointed in  Chapter  and have Letters of notice  sent them thereof But neither the Lieutenant nor Assistants can be Chosen two Years togeth  except the Sovereign should please to be present at the Day or Feast and after it was Decreed and  Hen  VIII that this Indulgence should extend to the term of three Years  Lastly We observe that this Officer always held the Feast at his peculiar Cost and Charge and gave liberal Rewards to  Garter  and for his Escutcheons as also to the Officers of Arms GentlemenUshers AlmsKnights and to all the several Waiters and Attendants employed in the Ceremony  The Ceremonies relating to the first  Vespers  § The first  Chapter  held on the Eve of St  George  being finished the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  immediately proceed from the  ChapterHouse  to the  Choir  to hear  Vespers  The Officers of Arms Prebends and AlmsKnights having attended in the NorthIsle of the Chappel do now put themselves in Rank and continue the Proceeding from the  ChapterHouse  Door along the said NorthIsle to the West Door of the  Choir  in like manner as they did from the Presence Chamber to the  ChapterHouse  The Organs then beginning to play and so continue till  Vespers  begin  When the AlmsKnights arrive at the WestDoor they first enter in a whole Body while the rest of the Proceeding makes a short stand and pass forward near the middle of the  Choir  where they make a joint and low Obeysance next all turning about by the left Hand to the Sovereign's Seat then still turning from the right to the left Hand they ascend the  Haut Pas's  even to the Rails set before the  Altar  and forthwith divide themselves flanking on each side the  Juniors  nearest the Rai  s  This done the Prebends enter in a Body also and having made the like Obeysances in the middle of the  Choir  divide themselves and take their Seats which by King  Henry  VIII's  Statutes  are appointed in the lowe  range of Seats between but not in the Stalls of the  KnightsCompanions  While the Prebends are en  ering their Seats the Pursuivants Heralds and Provincial Kings of Arms in a Body likewise enter the  Choir  and after due Reverence pass up to the  Altar  and join the AlmsK  ghts though anciently some difference was in this Ceremony  Afterwards the two  Junior KnightsCompanions  enter passing on till they come near their own Stalls and there make their Reverences and then divide and take their stands directly before their Stalls and so of the rest of the  KnightsCompanions  Next to the  KnightsCompanions  the  BlackRod Garter  and  Register  enter in a Breast who proceeding to the middle of the  Choir  make their Obeysances and then pass to their Form placed on the Southside of the  Choir  before the Sovereign's Stall and stand before it After them the Chancellor and Prelate in the like manner stand before their Form placed near the Sovereign's Seat And for these Forms whereon the Officers of the  Order  sit in the Chappel there is a special Decree for the allowance of them entered at the end of the Constitutions of their Offices  Last of all the Sovereign enters having the Sword born before him but his Band of Pensioners  tay at the  Choir  Door to keep off the Crowd who coming to the Steps which ascend the Royal Seat makes a Reverence toward the Altar and then takes Place therein before he makes a second Reverence  When the Lieutenant in the Sovereign's absence proceeds to the first  Vespers  as soon as he enters the  Choir  and comes near the Sovereign's Stall He stands and makes a little pause there then doing his Reverences after he has again stood a while before he ascends his own where being arrived he makes the double Reverence a second time and then sits down  And now to placing the  KnightsCompanions  in their Stalls  Garter  as soon as the Sovereign or his Lieu  enant is placed makes again the usual Reverence in the middle of the  Choir  then turns to the  Senior  Knights and doth his Reverence to each of them whereupon at one Instant they make their double Reverences below where they stood and strait ascend at the first or w  stern Entrance that goes to the side Stalls where being arrived they make again their double Reverences and then seat themselves But when the Sovereign's Lieutenant is pre  nt  each Knights adds a third Reverence to him both  when they ascend to and descend from their Stalls and so likewise do all Persons who pass in the Proceeding add to their double Reverences so often as there is occasion to make it after such time as the Lieutenant is entered his Stall and so long as he continues therein both on the Eve the Feast Day and the Morrow after  The  KnightsCompanions  being all seated the Prelate and Chancellor pass into the middle of the  Choir  and having made double Reverences return to their Forms and sit down And after them in the same manner the  Register Garter  and  BlackRod  proceed  As to the Sovereign's other Attendants the Nobleman who carries the Sword retires before the Sovereign's Stall a little on the right Hand and the Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold if not a Knight of the  Garter  and the Vice Chamberlain on the left till the Sovereign give them leave to sit down The Clerk of the Closet stands at the Sovereign's right Hand but the young Noblemen that carry up the Sovereign and the Gentleman of the Robes sometimes repose themselves on the Steps going to the Sovereign's Stall  This being done preparation for  Vespers  begin in reference to which the Prelate ascends the  Altar  it being the Duty of his Office which if he omits he is  ined twenty Marks to the use of the College unless he give sufficient reason for his absence in which Case or on the vacancy of the See of  Winchester  the Sovereign hath sometimes appointed another Bishop to Officiate for him The Proceeding to the  Altar  on this occasion is as follows  First The Serjeant of the Vestry makes a double Reverence then comes before the Prelate and makes a single one to him who thereon arises from his Seat and the Serjeant proceeds before him into the middle of the  Choir  where the Prelate makes a double Reverence and passing forward after the Serjeant and having ascended the uppermost  Hautpas  before the  Altar  he makes one single Reverence toward the same and so goes to the North side of it  After which the two  Provincial Kings Heralds  and  Pursuivants  leaving their forementioned Stations jo  n together till they come near the Forms of the  Registe  Garter  and  BlackRod  where making their double R  verences  they divide again on each side and there stand  Lastly The AlmsKnights come down into the  Choir  in a Body and there make their joint double Reverences and then take their Chairs all which being finished Divine Service is begun by the Prelate  The like Solemnity is observed at any other Place as well as at  Windsor  where because the AlmsKnights are absent the Pursuivants at Arms ascend nearer the  HighAltar  than when they are at  Windsor  but this occasions little Variation  When the  Vespers  are ended the Prelate goes to the middle of the  Altar  and with great Reverence makes an Obeysance and thence with the Serjeant before him descends to the middle of the  Choir  where he makes his double Reverences and so returns to his Seat whereupon all make ready to pass out of the  Choir  which is performed in much the same manner and with the same State as they proceeded thither and the Servants and Attendants of the  KnightsCompanions  are marshalled in the same Order as they were at the beginning of the Proceeding that the whole Procession may again pass through them  The AlmsKnights having entered the Guard Chamber spread themselves on each side thereof the Prebends pass through them and fall off on either side the Room to the Presence Chamber Door  Then the  Pursuivants Heralds  and  Provincial Kings  proceeding through the Lane made by the AlmsKnights and Prebends enter the Presence Chamber and fall off on either side toward the Stall the King's standing uppermost  Then enter the  KnightsCompanions  and place themselves on each side of the State in such Order as they sat in their Stalls the eldest nearest the State but those whose Companions are absent stand alone after whom follow the Officers of the  Order  disposing themselves conveniently near the State  Lastly The Sovereign passes to the Step before the State where being arrived he turns toward the  KnightsCompanions  who make their Reverences jointly to him and he thereon puts off his Cap and resalutes them  which done the Sovereign and they withdraw into the Privy Chamber till Supper time  But in Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign when the Feast of St  George  was held at  WhiteHall  or  Greenwich  and the Sovereign as was usual with her proceeded no farther on the Eve to  Vespers  than to the great Closet the ordinary way and thence sent her Lieutenant into the  Choir  Then in such Case when  Vespers  were ended the Lieutenant returned from the  Choir  through the great Hall and so back to the said Closet and stood at the Door thereof attending the Sovereign's coming forth from whence they all proceeded before her into the PresenceChamber and there the Ceremony for that time ended  But in the Reign of King  James  I when the Supper on the Eve as also the following Meals were prepared in the BanquettingHouse the Sovereign's Lieutenant frequently returned from the Closet by the Lobby to the said BanquettingHouse instead of going to the Presenc  and passing up the State gave an End to the Ceremony till Supper time And so we find it observed in the and of that King  When the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  are retired they are not to put off any part of their Robes till Supper is over for that is prohibited by the  Statutes  not only to those who do not Sup as well as those who do And hereon  Car  II the Sovereign having a mind to take the Air went into  HidePark  after he had taken leave of the  KnightsCompanions  the Dukes of  York  and  Monmouth  and the Earl of  Oxford  being with him but all in full Robes and so returned to Supper  The Supper on the Eve  § When the Sovereign is pleased to Sup publickly on the Eve of the Feast at  Windsor  the Supper has been always prepared in St  George  's  Hall  The usual P  ace at  WhiteHall  was heretofore in the Presence Chamber of later times the BanquettingHouse and at  Greenwich  either the Presence or the Council Chamber where the Sovereign or his Lieutenant were always present Bu  when the Feast of St  George  was celebrated at  York    Car  I the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  ma  ched  after the first  Vespers  to a House prepared for that purpose and supped there  But if the Eve of the Feast fell out on a Fasting Day as it did  Hen  VIII and  Jac  I the Supper was always omitted and the Sovereign with his Lieutenant and  KnightsCompanions  were served of the Void only  Nor does the Sovereign when he Sups publickly pass privately to the Place but as soon as notice is given that the first Mess is set upon the Table he presently enters the Presence Chamber whence the Officers of the  Order  and of Arms the  KnightsCompanions  in their full Robes for so the  Statutes  expresly direct having put themselves into their usual Order proceed before him to St  George  's  Hall  Where being enteted the  Pursuivants Heralds  and  Provincial Kings  fall off all upon the right Hand opposite to the  KnightsCompanions  Table the  Junior Pursuivants  standing toward the lower End of the Hall Then the  KnightsCompanions  passing up beyond them formerly divided themselves on either side according to the Decree  Hen  VIII and made a stand each taking Place according to the Order of their Stalls But at the Feast held at  WhiteHall    Car  II the Sovereign directed that they should stand all on the right Hand side facing the Table  Next the five Officers of the  Order  follow who ascending beyond the  Senior  Knight retire on the right Hand After them the Sovereign and the Officers of Arms all doing him Reverence as he passes by Who passing up to the  Hautpas  before his own Table turns himself to the  KnightsCompanions  and putting off his Cap they return their Reverences jointly to him  The Sovereign sitting down to Supper is first served by Water by some Nobleman then Grace is said by the Prelate then is the  Senior  Knight conducted to his Table by two Officers of  Arms  and so the rest in Order to the Tables appointed them Whereupon the Officers of the  Order  and of Arms retire out of the Hall to Supper  If a Lieutenant be constituted he proceeds to Supper in full Robes and in the same Order as doth the Sovereign and sits alone at the Sovereign's Table yet on the left Hand of the Cloth of State being served in all Points with Water and by a  Cupbearer Carver  and  Sewer  as the Sovereign himself is  When Supper is ended and the Banquet taken away the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  proceed back in the same Order they came to the Presence Chamber where the Sovereign or his Lieutenant standing on the Step before the Cloth of State Salutes them as before and then appoints the Hour and Place for the  KnightsCompanions  to attend him the next Morning The like if the Supper be provided in any other Place besides the Presence Chamber the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  proceed back thither because the Ceremony ought to end there as has always been the Custom And if the Supper be prepared in the Presence Chamber they then take their Leave in the same Room there being no occasion to proceed farther  If any of the  KnightsCompanions  accompany the Sovereign or his Lieutenant to his Lodgings they then go after not before him in regard the State of that Night's Service ended in the Presence Chamber and after they have retired to their Loding they have Permission to Unrobe  When the Sovereign or his Lieutenant do not Sup in St  George  's  Hall  on the Eve of the Feast on the following Night the Officers of Arms have formerly had the Liberty to Eat there and this Privilege was assigned them by Decree of a  Chapter  held  Eliz  appointing them  that Table which was before that time used by the Chancellor Register  and other  Officers  of the  Order  But how they came to lose this Privilege is not mentioned for now instead of sitting in the great Hall they are necessitated to Eat in such Rooms of the Castle as they can procure  CAP XXI The Order of the Ceremonies on the Feast Day  The Proceeding to the Chappel in the Morning  § NOtwithstanding the Celebration of the Feast takes up three Days  viz  part of the twenty second all the twenty third and part of the twenty fourth of  April  yet the twenty third St  George  's  Day  is the Grand Part The Ceremonies of which may be divided into Sacred and Civil the first solemnized in the Chappel the latter in St  Geo  ge  's  Hall  In Order to which  the KnightsCompanions  in full Robes repair to the Sovereign's Privy Lodgings at the H  ur a  pointed as also the Officers of the  Order  In the mean time the rest of the Degrees and Persons which made up the Proceeding on the Eve of the Feast take their several Stations then appointed them to attend the Sovereign's coming out of the PresenceChamber  When the Sovereign having the  KnightsCompanions  and Officers of the  Order  before him has entered the Presence the Sword is delivered to the Nobleman appointed to bear it and after the usual Salutations the Proceeding sets forward to the Chappel in the same Order as on the Eve the  KnightsCompanions  having their Trains born by some of their own Gentlemen  At the Foot of the Stairs entering the Cloister or Stone Gallery twelve Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber attend with a rich Canopy of Cloth of Gold who when the Sovereign approa  hes receive him under it and bear it over his Head till he comes to the  Choir Door  of St  George  's  Chappel  which Cano  y is carried only on the Morn  ng of the Feast Day a  d not at any other time  The Processional way to the Chappel is the  ame they traversed on the Eve if the Sovereign and  Knigh  sCompanions  proceed to the  ChapterHouse  first for anciently  it was the Custom to hold a  Chapter  in the Morning of the Feast Day either before Mattins or after before the Grand Procession set forward This Cour  e received interruption in Queen  Elizabeth  's time during which no Chapter was held in the Morning except in the and Years of her Reign and then only for admitting some Officers of the  Order  But the time of holding this  Chapter  was restored by King  Charles  I who several times held it before the first Service began as in the and of his Reign  But if no  Chapter  be held at this time then as soon as the Proceeding comes near the Chappel instead of entering the Passage between the Eastend of the Chappel and King  Henry  VIII's Tomb House as it does on the Eve by reason the Sovereign goes first to the  ChapterHouse  it proceeds straight on to the South Door and thence into the  Choir  Yet King  Charles  II in the of his Reign appointed the whole Proceeding to pass by the said South Door all along the South side of the Chappel and then to enter at the West Door which was then and since observed  When the AlmsKnights are come to the West Door of the  Choir  they enter and pass up above the Steps of the  Altar  in the very same Manner and Order as they did on the Eve and so exactly of the rest Which being done the Prelate begins the Morning Service according to the Order observed in the CommonPrayer only that the first Lesson being made proper to the Festival is taken out of the Chapter of  Ecclesiasticus  This Solemn Proceeding to the Chappel in the Mor  ing of the Feast Day is and has been most usual performed on Foot yet there are Instances heretofore where the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  have proceeded on Horseback for the greater Splendor and Gallantry of the  Order  As in  Edw  IV when several Ladies rode in the Cavalcade richly adorned of which Habit mention is already made So also  Hen  VII when it was augmented by the Presence of the Queen and the King's Mother attended by a splendid Train of Ladies And again the of the same King when he held the Feast a  Baynard  's  Castle  in  London  he proceeded on Horse back to St  Paul  's The like King  Henry  VIII did at  Windsor  on the Feast of St  George  of h  s Re  gn and K  ng  Philip  and of  Phil  and  Mar  and Queen  Elizabeth  in the of her Reign in her whole Habit of the  Order  so did the Sovereign's Lieutenant at the same Feast ride to the first and second  Vespers  and to the Morning Service the Day after  It was a Custom begun by Queen  Elizabeth  and used when she celebrated St  George  's  Feast  either at  WhiteHall  or  Greenwich  for the Sovereign's Lieutenant and  KnightsCompanions  in full Robes attended with the Officers of the  Order  and of  Arms  to meet in the Presence Chamber about nine in the Morning of the Feast Day and proceed thence as they did the Evening before through the Guard Chamber down into the great Hall and thence into the Chappel where they took their Stalls as on the Eve after which Morning Prayer was performed as far as the Litany and this was called the first Service which done they all descended from their Stalls in the accustomed Order and proceeded back to the Presence and there waited the coming of the Sovereign before whom they proceeded a second time to the  Choir  where the Litany and Grand Procession began called the second Service at which the Sovereign was usually Present but seldom at the first Service  The first Instance we have met with of this double Proceeding is recorded in the  BlueBook  of the  Order    Eliz  and was continued throughout her Reign and that of King  James  I not only when the Feast of St  George  was celebrated at  WhiteHall  or  Greenwich  but also at other times when celebrated at  Windsor  and so  Car  I But from that time the Sovereign went to the Chappel at the beginning of Morning Service which was continued without interruption Which way has been ever since duly observed  But when it was known that the Sovereign did not go in the Grand Procession but his Lieutenant for him then the Service was constantly gone through withal at once  The Proceeding to the second Service  § When the Feast has been celebrated elsewhere th  n at  Windsor  as soon as the Prelate was come  down from the  Altar  on finishing the first Service the  KnightsCompanions  descended from their Stalls in usual Order and then the Lieutenant with the Officers of the  Order  and of  Arms  proceeded before him to the Presence to conduct the Sovereign to the second Service which second Proceeding was disposed in the same manner as was that to the first Service in the Morning only in the latter because the Sovereign proceeded the Sword was also carried  Of the Grand Procession  § We are now arrived at the Grand Procession of this most Noble  Order  which is indeed the most Solemn and Magnificent Part of the whole Ceremony and has always been celebrated in the Morning of the Feast Day of St  George  or on such other Day as the Sovereign hath appointed by Prorogation to hold the same But as to the instant of Time when it began it has sometimes been uncertain with respect to the conveniency of the Church Service when it was conceived most pr  per which was generally at the end of the second Collect and before the Litany Nevertheless in  Eliz  the Feast being then held at  Windsor  it began presently after the  Te Deum  was Sung and the twentieth of the said Queen's Reign at  Greenwich  after reading the second Lesson And to come nearer our Times the Grand Procession set forward  Car  I when the first Service was finished and  Car  I after the S  rmon was ended But at the Grand Feast  Car  II it was brought to its usual time after the last Collect  As to the Proceeding or Processional way at  Wind    that has not bee  always the same sometimes it wa  con  ined within the Walls of St  George  's  Chappel  but at other times enlarged through the lower Court of the Castle  a  ew Instances of both Cases are remaini  g  but none of any ancient date  What the Order and Manner of this Cerem  ny was  may be collected from what an old Relator says of the Solemn Procession made the  Ma      Hen  VIII  Tha  it was ordered as of old Time accustomed  First went the AlmsKnights two and two on either side the  Choir  then the Officers of Arms next the  KnightsCompanions  after them the Officers of the  Order  and then the Prelate bearing the Heart of St  George  under a Canopy honourably assisted four Noblemen bearing each a Torch and last of all the Sovereign  And though here is no mention of any Ecclesiast  cks that joined themselves in the Proceeding yet it cannot be supposed that as part of the Divine Service was to be performed but that some of the Chaplains and Priests were included And we meet with one Instance where the Priests not only went in the Grand Processi  n but had a Place assigned in it where the Gentlemen of the Sovereign's  Chappel  and  Choir  of  Windsor  now go  But it must be confessed that the Records of the  Order  are very defective in this particular relating to the Grand Procession and speak of it only in general or at most take notice but of some of those Degrees that attend in it and this but of late Time neither Among which  Eliz  it is said  They all proceeded in Order as the Custom was  the Sovereign following in the Rear of the Proce  sion  As to Place and Precedency it is in every respect the same as in the Sovereign's Proceeding to the Chappel on the Eve of the Grand Feast only here are some Persons  ded which go not in that Namely the Gentlemen and Choiristers of the Sovereign's Chappel at  WhiteHall  and the PettyCanons Vicars and Choiristers of  Windsor  The whole Order is as follows  The Morning Service having proceeded to the second  esson and the Prelate conducted by the Serjeant of the Vestry from the  Altar  to his Seat  The AlmsKnights rise from their Seats and pass to the middle of the  Choir  and af  er their accustomed Reverences go up to the sides of the  Altar  Next in like manner the Officers of A  ms pass up  Hereupon  Garter  rises from his Sea  and makes his usual Reverences then waving his Rod summons the  Junior  Knights to descend  Whilst they and the rest of the  KnightsCompanions  are leav  ng their Stalls with usual Reverences the Gentlemen of the Chappel PettyCanons and Vicars of  W n    or  put on Copes and make themselves ready to pro  eed  Then the  KnightsCompanions  being all come down stand each under his proper Stall  Then the  BlackRod Garter  and  Register  rise and stand before their Forms  So do the Chancellor and Prelate  This done the AlmsKnights come down from the  Altar  and passing into the middle of the  Choir  make again their double Reverences and proceed out of the  Choir  After them the Choiristers pass in a Body to the middle of the  Choir  and having made their double Reverences as do all that follow proceed forth two and two  So do the Vicars of  Windsor  Next the four PettyCanons come from their Seats into the middle of the  Choir  and there begin to Sing an Hymn  Then follows the Serjeant of the Vestry bearing his gilt Rod  After him the Gentlemen of the Chappel at  WhiteHall  Next the Virger of  Windsor Chappel  bearing his Silver Rod  Then the Prebends of  Windsor  After whom the Officers of Arms come down from the  Altar  and pass on  Then the  KnightsCompanions  the  Juniors  first  Then the  BlackRod Garter  and  Register  The Chancellor and Prelate  The Nobleman that bears the Sword of State  Then the Sovereign above in his Stall makes a Reverence toward the  Altar  and being descended another below then passes out and enters under the Canopy which waits f  r him at the  Choir Door  the Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold if not a Knight of the  Order  attending somewhat behind the side of the Canopy on the Sovereign's right Hand and the Vice Chamberlain at the like distance on his  left as in the Grand Procession  Car  II  And lastly The Band of Pensioners who attend the Guard on each side the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  th their Captain at the Head of them  In this Order to this Day they proceed with great Devotion the whole  Choir  Singing the Office appointed  which heretofore was the Litany but is now generally a Thanksgiving Hymn  The Grand Procession when it has been  elebrated at  WhiteHall  or elsewhere than at  Windsor  is for the most part ordered after the aforesaid manner as may be seen by the following Scheme  Serjeant of the Vestry with his gilt Rod  Choiristers in Surplices  Gentlemen of the Chappel in Copes  Subdean in a Cope  Officers of Arms  Knights Companions  Officers of the Order  The Sword  The Sovereign under a Canopy with his Train born up  The Pensioners as before  But in what this Grand Procession differs from that at  Windsor  we shall here Note  First Here the Serjeant of the Vestry leads the Pro  eeding and is followed by the Choiristers  Secondly The Prebends and  Choir  of  Windsor  and the AlmsKnights are here wanting  Thirdly The Subdean and Dean of the Chappel are taken in and proceed next to the Gentlemen of the Chappel to whom the Sovereign's Almoner has sometimes joined himself  Fourthly Whilst the  KnightsCompanions  are descending from their Stalls the Gentlemen of the Chappel go into the Vestry to put on their Copes but the Dean of the Chappel hath his brought into the  Choir  which he puts on below under his Seat  Fifthly and Lastly In Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign  he Ladies Attendants went with the Pensioners on either side the Sovereign  To contribute more to the Pomp and State of this great Ceremony a Canopy is born over the Sovereign's Head by Knights and Gentlemen of Quality while he passeth in Procession till he return to the  Choir Door  The Persons appointed to carry the Canopy  Anno    Hen  VIII were four Knights of the Body when four o  her Knights bore four Wax Tapers but since they are  he Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber in ordinary who at the time of the Feast are in waiting twelve of whom are appoin  ed for this Service the Sovereign hath also the long Train of his Mantle carried up by several of the young Nobility who receive notice thereof by the Lord Chamberlain of the Houshold  In like manner the Lieutenants or Deputies to the Sovereign have had their Train carried up in the Proceedings by Persons of Distinction and the Train of a Stranger King personally pr  sent at  Windsor  hath also been born up and in like manner the Train of a Deputy from a Stranger King and lastly the  KnightsCompanions  have their Trains carried up by their own Gentlemen  The Cloaths and Apparel of the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  and the great variety of rich Jewels which surround or adorn their Caps or where else they may appear most conspicuous shine with great Lustre  The  Provincial Kings Heralds  and  Pursuivants  habited in their rich Coats and going together in one Body appear also very conspicuous from the Royal Arms of the Sovereign richly Embroidered on them with fine G  ld Purples and Twist the Ground of the  Provincial King's  Coats are blue Velvet the  Heralds  blue Sattin a  d the  Pursuivants  blue Damask  The Habit in which the Canons of the College proceed is also peculiar for though as Clergymen they are vested in Linen Surplices at all times of Divine Service yet at this Solemnity they wear a Mantle over those Surplices which is a Habit appointed for them from the Foundation of the  Order  these Mantles are of  Murry Taffety  and on the right Shoulder is an Escutcheon of St  George  's  Arms  within a Rundlet Embroidered with Gold and Silk which is bought at their own Charge  The Gentlemen of the Sovereign's Chappel the PettyCanons and Vicars of  Windsor  appear in Habits more glorious being all or the most part of them vested in rich Copes of Cloth of Gold or most costly Embroideries but the Children of the Chappel and Choiristers p  oceed habited in Surplices of white Linen lastly the Habits of the AlmsKnights a Mantle and Kirtle are not unremarkable both for Colou  and Materials which appear suitable to their Age and Degree The Mantles are of Cloth which the  Statutes  appoint to be of a red  Colour with a Shield of the Arms of St  George  bu  without a Garter to surround them  In this Grand Proceeding the Habits entertain the Beholders with a very delightful Prospect being so ordered that the Grave are placed between those that a  e Rich and Gallant and to add to the greater Shew of this Solemn Ceremony the Registers of the  Order  make mention of divers Persons of Rank and Quality who put themselves on the Duty of Attendance on their Sovereign because related to his Service though in reference to the  Order  not so concerned as to be taken into the Proceeding such are divers of the Nobility sometimes great Ladies many considerable Officers of the Houshold and other Courtiers all richly habited and attired  To complete the Pomp of this great Solemnity we may in the last Place fi  ly remember the Musick as a part thereof the  Choirs  of the Sovereign's Chappel at St  James  's and at  Windsor  being united all Singing the  acred Hymn together while the Grand Procession devoutly passeth and on their return to the  Choir Door  the AlmsKnights first advance into it and after double Reverences ascend above the  Haut Pas  's to the  Altar  Next the Choiristers and in like manner the Vicars  PettyCanons of  Windsor  Gentlemen of the Chappel and Prebends go to their Seats  Then the Officers of Arms pass up and join to the AlmsKnights After this the  KnightsCompanions  enter and stand before their Stalls  The like doth the  BlackRod  Garter  and  Register  As also the  Chancellor  and  Prelate  Then doth the Sovereign take his Royal Stall  The  KnightsCompanions  ascend their Stalls  The Officers of the  Order  sit down on their Forms in the same Manner and Order and with like Reverences as at their Entrance into the  Choir  on the Eve of the Feast  Then the Prela  e with two Prebends appointed to read the Epistle and Gospel are conducted the one by  e Se  jeants of the Ve  try the other by the Virger up  o the  Alta    which they approach with usual Reverences the Prelate passing to the Northside and the Prebends to the South to finish the remaining part of Divine Ser  e  Whereupon the Officers of Arms descend into the  Choir  And  The AlmsKnights go down to their Seats which while they are so doing the two Prebends put on their Copes at the Southside of the  Altar  This done the Prelate begins the second Service which hath been celebrated since the time of the Reformation according to the Book of  CommonPrayer  and is the same commonly used on any other Feast Day excepting a peculiar Epistle and Gospel the first being the thirty third Chapter of  Deuteronomy  and the latter the fifth Chapter of St  John  beginning at the twenty fourth Verse and ending at the thirtieth which being read the Creed is Sung  We may here Note that before the Reformation it belonged to the Abbot of  TowerHill  to read the Gospel and to the Prior of  Medemenham  in  Norfolk  to read the Epistle  The Offering of Gold and Silver  §  This Ceremony whether it be performed in the Sovereign's Chappel at  Windsor  or in any other Church or Chappel is one and the same except the Sovereign's Offering of Gold and Silver instead of the  Bezant  which is peculiar to  Windsor  The accustomed time of Offering on the Feast Day is mentioned  Anno    Hen  VIII to be after the Sovereign's return to his Stall from the Grand Procession in the time of High Mass and at this Day begins immediately after this first Sentence of the Offertory is pronounced by the Prelate  Let your Light so shine before men c  This said the Organ begins to Play and forthwith a Groom and Page of the removing Wardrobe with Reverence first made unrol a long Carpet and spread it before the  Altar  which being done the  AlmsKnights  fi  st next the  Pursuivants Heralds  and  Provincial Kings  a  cend in usual Order and flank the Carpet on both sides Then  Garter  steps from his Seat and after double Reverences and the usual manner of waving his Rod the  KnightsCompanions  descend in their accustom'd Order and stand before their Stalls  Af  er this  BlackRod  goes from his Seat to the  Altar  towards which making a single Reverence he turns his Back and immediately the Groom of there moving Wardrobe delivereth him a little Carpet anciently of Silk now of Cloth of Gold and the said Groom holds on his Arms a Cushion of Cloth of Gold for the Sovereign to Kneel upon at the time of his Offering which the  BlackRod  forthwith lays on the upper  Haut Pas  before the  Altar  and each of them as well in delivering as receiving the Cushion kiss it  After this the Prelate of the  Order  takes a gilt Bason to receive the Sovereign's Offering and stands before the middle of the  Altar  with one of the Prebends to assist him at which time the Sovereign arising makes his Reverence towards the  Altar  and then descending makes a little Reverence below and ascends towards the  Altar  with his Attendants and being come into the middle of the  Choir  he makes another Reverence and at the first  Haut Pas  his last  He that bears the Sovereign's Offering is either the  Senior  Knight the Prince or the greatest Estate among the  Knig  tsCompanions  then present and no other Person of what Degree soever if he be not of this Noble Fraternity performs this Service  The Sovereign being come to the upper  Haut Pas  kneels at which Instant  BlackRod  on his Knee delivers with Assay the Sovereign's Offering to the  Senior  Knight or other Person nominated and he kneeling presents it to the Sovereign which he immediately Offers into the Bason held by the Prelate and then ariseth and is conducted and attended as when he came up to Offer at the Entrance into his Stall he turns and makes a Reverence and his Attendants also bow towards the  Altar  and being attended into his Stall doth the like again and then reposeth himself in his Seat  An Entry is made in the  RedBook Anno    Car  I  That whereas in other Places besides  Windsor  the Sovereign is wont to Offer a certain Gold Piece vulgarly called a Bezant to be  edeemed afterwards at a certain Price the Usher of the  BlackRod  having been admonished that in these Services the  e is no Redemption to be made should never present the Bezant at  Windsor  to the Sovereign but Gold and Sil  r of English Mon  y  When the Sovereign is absent and the Lieutenant Offers for him he performs the Ceremony as follows  First After the Preparations made for the Offering as aforesaid he descends from his Stall with the usual Reverences and goes to the Steps ascending the Sovereign's Stall and there stands a while then making his double Obeysance he proceeds towards the  Altar  the Officers of the  O  der  going before him with one other Reverence in the middle of the  Choir  and another at the first  Haut Pas  of the  Altar  the Carpet and Cushion is spread and laid for him as is for the Sovereign and the Offering al  o given in the same way and the Lieutenant kneeling puts it in the Bason and returns to the Sovereign's Stall in the same Order c he came where standing a while again before it he makes a Reverence towards it and then goes up into his own Stall where if it fall out that the Lieutenant is not the  Senior  Knight he stays to receive the Reverences of all the  KnightsCompanions  his  Seniors  as they go up to Offer and when his own turn comes to Offer he descends with a double Reverence and procee  s up with his Fellow if present and Offers for himsel  in his own Place but his Train is then let down the Carpet c taken away and only two Officers of Arms but none of the  Order  proceeds before him and when he has Offer'd he returns to his Stall  But it seems  Jac  I that  Garter  alone on the Feast Day brought up the Prince then the Sovereign's Lieutenant when he came to Offer for himself which Service ought to have been performed by  Clarenceux  and  N  rroy  which was an oversight in  Garter  as likewise his bringing down at the same the  KnightsCompanions  out of their Stalls to Offer before the Epistle and Go  pel were Rea  contrary to the usage of former times by which  h  y were kept a tedious time waiting below in the  Choir  before the Offering began But  Jac  I the Prince was brought up by  Clarenceux  and  Norroy  when he came to Offer and not by  Garter  When the Lieutenant hath Offered for himself he returns to the lower end of the Stalls and passes to his own where having paid the u  al Reverences he enters it and is ready to receive the Reverences of all the other  KnightsCompanions  As soon as the Sovereign or his Lieutenant is returned to his Stall the two Provincial King  pass down  he middle of the  Choir  where making Reverences jointly to the  Altar  and next to the Sovereign  Clarenceux  turns himself to the  Senior  Knight and makes him a third Reverence while  Norroy  at the same Instant does the same to the next  Junior  Knight and so both as an intimation of their going up to Offer then each King retires a little backward t  ward the Stalls In the mean time the two  Senior  Knights draw near together and making double Reverences  Clarenceux  and  Norroy  step forth and pass up before them till they arrive near the Prelate or if the  Senior  Knight be without his Opposite then he is brought up single then making their Reverences first towards the  Altar  next to the Knights  Clarenceux  retires to the right side and  Norroy  to the left waiting for the return of the Knights who are kneeling on the uppermost  Haut Pas  of the  Altar  making their Offering Which humble Ceremony of kneeling not being heretofore used was fixed by a Decree of  Car  I  The  KnightsCompanions  Offerings are both of Silver and Gold which is receiv'd by two of the Prebends or by one Prebend and one Chantor anciently by one Chantor only when the Offering is at  Windsor  but by the Dean of the Chappel when at  WhiteHall  The Offering being made the  KnightsCompanions  rise and forthwith divide themselves  Clarenceux  conducting the  Senior  Knight to the lower end of the Stalls on the Sovereign's side and  Norroy  the next  Junior  Knight to the lower end of the Stalls on the Prince's side and at parting make their Reverences and return to their Stations before the  Altar  The Knights at their Entrance into the Stalls make their double Reverences together and then pass on to their own where making the like Reverences they  ake their Seats  But if any Stranger King be present at the Offering he does not retire to his Seat by the lower end of the Stalls but along the  Choir  as does the Sovereign the same way he proceeded up So did the King of  Denmark    Jac  I  The Ceremonies of the two  Senior  Knights Offering bei  g finished the two  S  nior He  alds  observing their last R  verences pass down into the  Choir  in the same manner a  did  Clarenceux  and  Norro    to bring up the next t  o  Senior  Knights to Offer who use all the same Ceremonies  and are conducted back in like manner to the  Altar  and so of the other brought up by the two next  Senior Heralds Clarenceaux  and  Norroy  beginning again if there are more Knights than the  Heralds  in one Course supply and after them the  Heralds  again till the whole is ended And here it may be noted that where any Knight goeth single to Offer he hath nevertheless two  Heralds  to attend him  Touching the Offerings themselves made in the Chappel of  Windsor  they belong of right to the Dean and Prebends being conferr'd on them by the  Statutes  of the College And ordained also that the  Chantor  should see them receiv'd and faithfully kept and at the end of every Month or Weekly if the College required it give an Account of what was receiv'd All which was confirmed by King  Edward  III the Bishop Dean and Chapter of  Salisbury  to whose Jurisdiction the College of  Windsor  belongs and also by the Bishop of  Winchester  Prelate of the  Garter  But Dr  Montague  Bishop of  Winchester  at the Feast at  Windsor    Jac  I challenged a right to the Offerings and Bishop  Andrews  did  de Facto  both receive and keep the Offerings whenever he officiated at  Windsor  But on complaint of the Dean and Prebends of  Windsor  this matter was referred to the Chapter yet we do not find that any final or positive Determination was ever made to the time of the Restauration from which time the right of the Dean and Canons has never been disputed and the  Statutes  have d  ly taken Place  What has usually been offered either in Gold or Silver we shall see by the Account given in by the Bishop of  Winchester    Car  I at St  George  's  Feast  at  Windsor September    The whole Offering of the eight Knights is four Pounds fifteen Shillings  viz  in Gold ten Shillings each and in Silver two excepting the Lord Steward who  e Offering in Silver was only one Shilling besides the Sovereign's  Bezant  redeemable  The Offerings on the twenty fith Day  His Majesty's Offering in Gold one Pound and in Silver ten Shillings  The eight  KnightsCompanions  the same as the Day before the whole besides the King's  Bezant  eleven Pounds  When all the Knights have offered and are  eturned to their Stalls the Chancellor of the  Order  makes his Reverences and after him the  Register Garter  and  BlackRod  theirs together and take their Seats Next the Carpet being rolled up by the Groom and Page of the removing Wardrobe the  Provincial Kings Heralds  and  Pursuivants  and last of all the AlmsKnights make their Reverences and pass into the  Choir  where they remain till the Prelate has finished the second Service who conducted by the Serjeant of the Vestry comes down from the  Altar  with his accustomed Reverences to his Seat After whom the two Prebends are brought down by the Virger who making their usual Reverences take their Seats  The Return to the Presence  § Immediately after all prepare to pass out of the  Choir  and to proceed back to the Presence Chamber which is done in every particular as it is in the return of the Sovereign from the first  Vespers  The Proceeding passes on through the SouthDoor of the Chappel and here the Trumpets are taken in and placed before the AlmsKnights and sound all the way to the Guard Chamber at which time the Drums and Fifes begin to beat and play Thence the Proceeding passes into the Presence Chamber whither it ought to go before the Sovereign pass into the great Hall to Dinner and here the  KnightsCompanions  take their usual Stands and after the Sovereign's Salutation and their Reverences the Sovereign retires into the Privy Chamber and the Knights likewise retire till Dinner is ready  Of the Dinner on the Feast Day  § As soon as the Sovereign hath notice given him that the first Mess is set on the Table the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  come out of the Privy Lodgings into the Presence Chamber attended by the Officers of the  Order  and seat themselves in the same manner as at the Supper on the Eve of the Feast The Musick sounding  whilst the said Mess is carrying up which is in the fol+lowing Order  Four Serjeants at Arms  two and two  The Comptroller  The Treasurer  The Sewer  The Messes carried up by the Pensioners     Master of the Houshold  Cofferer  A Clerk Comptroller  A Clerk Comptroller  Second Clerk of the Kitchin  Chief Clerk of the Kitchin  The Sovereign hath most frequently sat alone though sometimes heretofore he hath been pleased to admit some of the  KnightsCompanions  to sit at the Table with him but this Honour has not been offered to any of them since the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  As soon as the Sovereign is placed the  KnightsCompanions  put on their Caps and remaining covered retire against the Tables prepared for them where Water is brought them by a Gentleman of Quality and having washed they all sit down  The Order of passing to their Seats at the Table  Car  II and so appointed to be observed for the future was after the following manner First The Duke of  York  entered the Rails at the upper end of the Table and passed down the hither side to the lower end and thence to the benchside to his Place In like manner followed all the other Knights according to the Seniority of their Stalls as it is ordained they shall  it and not according to thei  Estates or Dignities except the Sons of Stranger Kings Princes and Dukes and all on the right Hand or farther side of their Table not one against another but two and two at a Table to a Mess and those whose Opposites are wanting to sit alone and have a whole Mess  Their Meat being usually brought up by the Yeomen o  the Guard and are attended by some of the Gentlemen Pensioners and others of the Sovereign's Servants two to each Table  It appears that anciently the Officers of the  Order  ad a Table allowed them in the great Hall and sat covered  in the Sovereign's Presence but on the Eve of the Feast  Car  it was ordered in  Chapter  That they should be at their Choice to keep the Feast privately by themselves or sit uncovered where the Sovereign dined Whereupon from that time they forbore sitting in the Hall or where else the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  sat It likewise appears that the Officers of Arms did anciently sit in St  George  's  Hall  at a Table joined to that at which the Officers of the  Order  sat  Before the Entrance of the Sovereign's second Course he stands up and drinks to the  KnightsCompanions  and so it is remembred to be done by  Phil  and  Mar  they standing all the while uncovered till they have all pledged him Which done the Officers of Arms make themselves ready at the lower end o  the Hall to proceed up in the following  Order  Garter  Clarenceux and Norroy  Heralds two and two  Pursuivants two and two  And so altogether make their Reverence to the Sovereign and proceed near the side of the Knights Table till they come to the middle of the Hall where after another Reverence made they go still forward and when  Garter  has passed about two Yards beyond the Knights Tab  e and come near the  Haut Pas  as  nding the S  vereign's State they make the like Reverence again jointly Then  Garter  with a loud and audible Voice cries Largess thrice  though anciently but twice  Upon  Garter's  beginning to cry Largess all the  KnightsCompanions  unless Kings and great Princes if any  e present stand up uncovered till he has made an en  which Custom it seems  Car  I had been disconti  ed for some time Then  Garter  proceeds and Proclaims the Sovereign's Stiles and Titles of Honour first in  Latin  after in  French  and lastly in  English  he and the Offi  rs of Arms making a Reverence between and at the end join altogether in crying Largess thrice  and then a  l make Reverence together  Hereupon sometimes the Treasurer of the H  u  hold puts the Sovereign's La  gess which is  en P  unds in  into  Garter  's Hat and this is afterwards divided amon the Officers of Arms according to Custom But  Ann  o    Car  II the  BlackRod  put the Largess into  Garter  's Hat This being finished all the Offi  ers of Arms retire about three Yards backward keeping their Faces towards the Sovereign and there make a Reverence and so a second and thence retire out of the Hall to Dinner  This Ceremony ended the Sovereign's second Course is brought up first the Se  jeants at A  ms next the Treasurer and Comptroller of the Houshold next the Sewer then the GentlemenPensioners bearing the Messes then the Cofferer and Master of the Houshold the two Clerks of the GreenCloth the two Clerks Comptrollers and lastly the two Clerks of the Kitchin hab  ted in their Gowns and their Caps in their Hands And after the Sovereign's Table is compleatly furnished the second Cour  e is served up to the Knights Table by the Yeomen of the Guard in such Order as was the first  But where any  KnightCompanion  ha  pens to be installed at this Grand Feast and is present at Dinner then  Garter  and the Officers of Arms proceed in Order after they have proclaimed the Sovereign's Stile from the lower end of the Hall till they come before the n  w installed Knight's Mess and there  Garter  cries Large  s once and Proclaims his Stile in  English  only and then retires to Dinner  In the last Place comes in the Banquet brought to the Sovereign's Table by the Pensioners in the same Order as the Messes only in Place of the C  erk of the Kitchin the Chief Clerk of the Spicery waits and the Ba  quet for the  KnightsCompanions  by the Yeomen of the Guard  Dinner being ended the  KnightsCompanions  rise  irst and having washed place themselves a little be ow  State in their usual Order and make their Reve  nc  s  o the Sovereign After which  the So  ereign hears Gr  ce said by the Prelate then Water is brought in the  way and the So  ereign washes Which don  the  making again due Reverence to the Sovereign  his Cap and salutes them and then  roc  eds a  usua  o the Presence Chamber with the Knights and Offi  o  the  Order  before him c  In like manner does the Sovereign's Lieutenant proceed from the Presence to the Hall or such other Room where the Dinner is prepared only his Place at the Tab  is a little on the left Hand the Cl  th of State or at the end of the Table And after Dinner he returns t  the Presence in the same Order as the Sovereign does  The Ceremoni  s belonging to the second  Vespers  § The usual time for Proc  ding to the  ChapterHouse  hath usually been about four a Clock in the A  ternoon but sometimes not before five by reason of the length of the Dinner The Proceeding is as at other times and when the Sovereign and Knights have made a Cavalcade of it on the Eve or on the Feast Day the same has been observed at the Proceeding to the second  V  spers  It has been customary to hold a  Chapter  before the second  Vespers  for the regulation of the Affairs of the  O  der  When the second  Vespers  are ended the Proceeding passes out of the  Choir  in the very same Order as a  the first  Vespers  but  Anno    Car  I  it happening to be la  e ere the second  Vespers  ended the Sovere  gn did not go to the Presence Chamber but proceeded directly  o the great Hall to Supper by Torch Light  Of the Supper on the Evening of the Feast D  y  § It has not been frequently known that the Sovereign hath supped pub  ckly in St  Hall  n  he Feast Day but when it happens as  I the P  oceeding thither and re  u  n  re  n all  per  o  med as at the Supper on the Eve And i  the  Lieutenant hath on this N  gh  upped  u  lic  ly th  n  t was  n the P  esence Chamber where h  at alone at the Sovereign's Table as at other times  CAP XXII The Ceremonies observed on the last Day of the Feast  Of the Proceeding to the Choir  § THE manner of Proceeding to the  ChapterHouse  is performed in the same manner as it was on the Eve of the Feast and differs only in this Point that then the Sovereign and Knights are obliged by the  Statutes  to proceed in full Robes here by the Indulgence of King  Henry  VIII's  Statutes  all are dispensed with except the upper Robe or Mantle And as then the Image of St  George  was worn Pendant at the Coller of the  Order  now a blue Ribbond sufficeth and instead of a Cap and Feather only their ordinary Ha  s  It was the ancient Custom to Celebrate a  Chapter  in the Morning of the last Day of the Feast before the Sovereign proceeded to the Chappel chiefly to make Election of Knights where any Stall is void which has sometimes been held when the Sovereign did not go to the Chappel in the Privy Chamber and then the Lieutenant waving the  ChapterHouse  proceeds straight on to the Chappel and enters at the South Door  Of the elect Knights proceeding into the  Choir  § Where an Election has been made of a P  rson then present at Court he is called into the  Chap  erHouse  by  Garter  according to the usual manner an  ha  ing been invested with the  George  and  Ga  ter  e usually p  sed in the Proceeding to the Cha  pel whether  t we  from the  ChapterHouse  or Presence Chamber an  n  his ordinary Apparel alwa  s bareheaded the Place  ll  wed him in the Proceeding being be  wee  the  Knig  s  mpanions  and the Officers of A  ms But i  two  Knights have been elected they then proceed together before the  KnightsCompanions  At his Entrance into the  Choir  the elect Knight is placed by  Garter  next before the lowest Stall or if there be two elected and both proceed to the Chappel they are placed in the two lowest Stalls where they are to stand all Service time unless upon Licence to sit as they have sometimes obtained  Of the Ceremonies performed at Divine Service  § In this Morning Service before the Reformation of our Church the Mass of  Requiem  was solemnly Sung for the Souls of the  KnightsCompanions  and all faithful Souls departed which was provided for by the  Statutes  As likewise that all the Knights should be present thereat unless upon License obtained or special Case to the contrary At this Celebration was the deceased Knights Atchievements also offered with solemn Ceremony of which we shall speak presently  Another Ceremony belonging to the Service of this Morning is the Offering of Gold and Silver which when the first Sentence of the Offertory has been pronounced is again performed by the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  the Ceremonies being the same in all particulars as are observed at the like Offering on the Feast Day  Divine Service being ended the Sovereign and  KnightsCompanions  frequently proceed to the  ChapterHouse  and there put off their Mantles and therewith the Ceremonies of this Grand Feast determine  CAP XXIII The Observation of the Grand Feast by absent Knights  Absent Knights enjoined to observe the Grand Feast  § HAving shewn with what Magnificence and Ceremony the Feast of St  George  has been and ought to be observed as also how strictly the  Statutes  oblige the  KnightsCompanions  to appear annually thereat and what severe Penalties they are liable to if absent except on reasonable Cause of Absence Yet lest the Honour might receive diminution from too sm  ll an Appearance at its publick Solemnities it was farther at the Institution of the  Order  Decreed  That none of them should depart the Kingdom without first acquainting the Sovereign and obtaining his special Leave and License  nevertheless the Sovereign granted them License to go beyond Sea before the rest of his Subjects if they were dispos'd to undertake any Military Expedition from whence any Glory of Knighthood might be hop'd for  It was then by the eleventh Article also ordained on whatsoever occasion the Absence might be  That wheresoever any of the  KnightsCompanions  resided during the said Feast they should wear their Mantles of the  Order  from the Hour of the first  Vespers  on the Eve of St  George  till the sec  nd  Vespers  on the Feast Day were finished as they should have done had they been present in Person with the Sovereign or his Deputy during the whole Celebration of the Feast in case they were not deprived of their Liberty the Pror  gation of the Feast notwithstanding  King  Henry  VIII observing the Custom of these Celebrations began to be neglected in the eleventh year of his Reign enlarged the Law in this particular explaining the said eleventh Article He declar'd and enjoin'd the wearing of the whole Habit on the Eve of St  George  if the  Kn  ghtCompanion  were not under restraint Then he  enumerated the times for wearing it to wit on the Eve  at all times of Divine Service D  nner and Supper unless in case of War S  ckness or other just Impediment when it was sufficient if the absent Knight did wear the  Garter  and  George  either in a Gold Chain or Silk Ribbond  And when the same Sovereign about three Years aft  made a general Reformation of the  Statutes  he enjoin'd the absent  KnightsCompanions  unless under restraint to prepare a Capital Stall in the Church or Chappel where he design'd to hear Service to the Honour of the Sovereign in which should be set up the Arms of the  Order  within a  Garter  and also to erect another Stall as far in distance according to the proportion of the said Church or Chappel from the Stall of the Sovereign as is the absent Knights Stall in the Castle of  Windsor  and therein place his own Arms And should wear the whole Habit of the  Order  and hear Divine Service such as the Church ordained for the said time as well on the Eve and Morning as on the Afternoon on the Feast Day He is likewise to do Reverence towards the  Altar  in the Honour of God and after towards the Stall erected for the Sovereign at his coming in and going out of the said Church or Chappel and as often as he should pass before the said Stall But Em  erors King  Princes or Electors are excepted who may place their Seats and Stalls as they think  itting  This Decree is still in full force and we shall only further observe that it has been usual for the absent Knight to perform the same Ceremonies as near as may be to what is observed at  Windsor  and to be attended with a convenient Number of Gentlemen before him well habited with the Officers of his Houshold c who according to their Degrees proceed two and two together bareheaded and that he Dines and S  ps alone at all times unless a  KnightCompanion  be with him  How it is to be observed in Case of Sickness  § In Case of Sickness if the absent K  ight was only confin'd to his Chamber the Custom was to pr  p  re a Capital Stall for the Sovereign in the Chamber where  he lay and another Stall for himself placed according to the beforementioned directions to remain during the Feast in which Room Divine Offices were celebrated And if the absent Knight was so Sick as to keep his Bed then his whole Habit of the  Order  was laid thereon and upon this Account  Ambrose  Earl of  Warwick  falling Ill  t  Greenwich  when St  George  's  Day  was there celebrated  Anno    Eliz  retir'd to his Chamber and sat in his Robes  In what manner the Feast hath been observ'd by absent Knights  § Of this the  BlackBook  of the  Order  gives a very considerable Precedent Namely the Feast of St  George  held at the Palace of  Hereford  by Prince  Arthur    Hen  VII being then in his Government of the Principality of  Wales  and had with him Sir  Richard Pool  one of the  KnightsCompanions  where every thing according to the form of the  Statutes  was duly observed The Prince's Sword was born before his Stall and the Service performed by his  Herald  with great exactness Likewise the Sovereign's  Herald  stood all the while before the Sovereign's Stall which was adorned with accustomed Ornaments and the Bishop who performed Divine Service had his Seat erected near the High  Altar  There are other Instances as particularly those observed by Sir  Henry Sidney  at  Shrewsbury  and  Ludlow  and Queen  Eliz  which were very remarkable  As to the observation of the Feast by a Knight beyond Sea there is an Instance in  Robert  Earl of  Leicester  Lieutenant for Queen  Elizabeth  Governor and Captain General of the united Provinces and there celebrated the Feast He had an Escutcheon of the  Order  impailed with the Sovereign's Arms  ixt to the front of his House so also to the back of her Stall in the Church and his own Arms at the back of his own Stall  He proceeded on Hor  eback to the Church a Pursuivant riding before him wearing a King of Arms's Coat who  after S  rmon proceeded before him to the Offering which he made for the Sovereign and himself Service being ended he returned to his Lodging and dined with great Solemnity  Dispensations for Absence granted during Life  § Sometimes Dispensations for Absence have been obtained for Life upon the Petite of the  KnightsCompanions  setting forth their Age and Infirmity An Instance of which we find was grant  d to the Lord  Dacrees    Hen  VIII and the Earl of  Derby    Car  I and the Lord  Musgrave  but both with this Restriction that the absent should be obliged to send to  Garter  for his Escutcheons at the same time that he sent his Excuse and Petite for Dispensation and should solemnly keep in his own House the Feast with all the sacred Rites and Ceremonies in his Robes and other Ornaments if Health permit and in Case of Sickness upon his Bed according to the ancient  Statutes  This Act was thought of so great Importance to be observed that the Chancellor was ordered to transcribe it and send it to each of the  KnightsCompanions  acquainting them at the same time with the Penalties they should be liable to if they neglected the least Punctilio And the l  ke was again observed and repeated to them before the Feast of the ensuing Year  CAP XXIV The Degradation of a  KnightCompanion  § THE Ensigns of the  Order  are not to be withdrawn from a K  ight during Life unless Guilty of some of those Marks of Reproach set down in King  Henry  VIII's  Statutes viz  Heresy T  eason or Flying from Battle It has sometimes been  ound that Prodigality has been made a fourth Point where a Knight has so wasted his Estate as to be incapable of supporting his Dignity The Pretence for divesting  William  Lord  Paget    Edw  VI was his not being a Gentleman of Blood both by Father and Mother But Felony comes not within the compass of this  Statute  as not being expresly mentioned among the Reproaches there Summ'd up and so it was adjudged in a  Chapter    Jac  I in the Case of  Robert  Earl of  Somerset  then lately condemned for that Fact whereon his Ha  chments were not removed  When a  KnightCompanion  is found Guilty of any of the Offences mentioned in King  Henry  VIII's  Statutes  he is usually degraded at the next  Chapter  of which the Sovereign gives the  KnightsCompanions  previous notice and then commands  Garter  to attend such of them as are appointed to go to the Convict Knight who in a solemn manner first takes from him the  George  and  Ribbond  and then his  Garter  And at the ensuing Feast of St  George  or sooner if the Sovereign appoint it publication of his Crimes and Degradation is made by  Garter  Next  Garter  by Warrant to that purpose takes down his Atchievement on which Ser  ice he is vested in his Coat of Arms and the Officers of Arms standing ab  ut him the  BlackRod  also present First  Garter  reads aloud the Instruments of Degradation after which one of th  Heralds  who is placed ready on a Ladder set to the ba  k of the Convict Knight's Stall at the Words  expelled and put from among the Arms  takes his Crest and violently casts it down into the  Choir  after that his Banner and Sword and when the Publication is read out all the Officers of Arms spurn the Atchievements out of the  Choir  into the Body of the Church first the Sword then the Banner and last of all the Crest so out of the West Door  thence to the Bridge and over into the Ditch and thus it was done at the Degradation of  Edward  Duke of  Buckingham    Hen  VIII Their Plates are likewise tak  n down from their Stalls and carried away  Degradation not being alone thought sufficient it was debated in  Chapter    Hen  VIII whether the Names of such  KnightsCompanions  as were convicted of Treason should remain in the  Registers  or be razed out Where the Sovereign determined That wheresoever the Actions or Names of such Offenders should be found these Words  Vah Proditor  should be Written in the Margin by which  means the  Register  wou'd be preserv  d fair and not defac  d with razures or blots  In the close of this Section we may observe that some  KnightsCompanions  who have suffered Degradation have lived to be restored thereto being reelected and reinvested and their Atchievements set up again by the Indulgence of the next Reign as were the Lord  Paget  's  Mar  and the Marquiss of  Northampton    Eliz  as likewise the Duke of  Norfolk    Mar  CAP XXV Honours paid to deceased  KnightsCompanions  AS to the first part of this Section the celebrating Masses for defunct  KnightsCompanions  I think it very little material here that Ceremony altering with the Form of Religion became wholly disused  Hen  VIII at which time in a  Chapter  then held at  Westminster  the following Decree was made  That every one of the  KnightsCompanions  in lieu of the said Masses should for the future after the Death of any of their Brethren according to the Rates of their Degrees hereafter mentioned and immediately upon Demand of the  Register  and Dean of  Windsor  or one of them pay the several Sums following     l  s  d  The Sovereign        A Stranger King        The Prince        A Duke        A Marquiss           l  s  l  An Earl        A Viscount        A Baron        A KnightBatchelor        The Monies so collected called  Obiit Monies  were by the said Decree appointed to be distributed in AlmsDeeds  as the Reparation of High Ways the Relief of the Poor  c The receipt and disbursements of these Sums were committed to the care of the Dean and Register  Mr  Ashmole  has made this addition in his Library which it will not be out of our way to observe for the information of those who may be desirous to know how the Point then stood that not withstanding the aforesaid Order in  Chapter  made the th of  May Anno    Hen  VIII for changing the Number of Masses usually Sung for defunct Knights into a pecuniary Rate according their degrees the Prayers for Souls departed both by private Persons as also by the Clergy in Masses and Exequies nay farther to give Alms to others and to pray for them was continued by the Church of  England  several Years beyond that space for in a Book entituled the  Institution of a Christian Man  c made by the Clergy of  England  as appears by the Subscriptions of the Archbishops Bishops and others of the Clergy to the Preface dedicated by them to King  Henry  VIII and printed by  Thomas Bartelet  the King's Printer  Anno    cum Privilegio  the Article of Purg  tory is there set down  But to proceed This charitable distribution in a  Chapter  held at  Greenwich    Edw  VI was enlarged to the relief of the Poor in the Town of  Windsor  and other Towns Villages and Places at the discretion of the Dean of  Windsor  And though the said Decree was confirmed by King  Edward  VI Queen  Mary  and Queen  Elizabeth  yet for many Years the Collection of these  Obiit  Monies was neglected till in  Car  I the Earl of  Portland  out of his great Generosity as well as his Zeal for restoring so pious a Work reiterated to the Sovereign the ancient Decrees made in this Case Whereupon it passed in  Chapter  that the same should be revived and for ever continued and that the same should begin for the five Knights  whose Atchievements were offered at that Feast  viz  the King of  Sweden  the Elect or Palatine the Earls of  Northumberland Banbury  and  Rutland  And as to Stranger Princes it pleased the Sovereign to express himself  That as by the  Statutes  they are left  to perform these Payments by themselves if they wou'd so if it were not done by them that both then and for the fu  ure the same should  e paid by the Sovereign him  elf  Afterwards all the Sums of Money to be collected by Virtue of this Decree tog  ther with the  KnightsCompanions  Duties at their first Entrance in the  Order  were employed toward providing Plate for the  Altar  within St  George  's  Chappel  which is already treated of  Of fixing on the Stalls Plates of their Arms and Stiles  § The next thing provided for by the  Statutes  of Institution was the deceased Knight's Honour in regard of which it was ordained  That when any one of the first Founders should die there should be in Metal an Escutcheon of his Arms with his Helm or Crest fastened at the back of his Stall for a Mark of Honour to him that bore them  And in like manner  that their Successors should have a like Escutcheon fixed on the back of their Stalls  and to difference them from those of the first Founders they were appointed to be made somewhat less and to be placed a little underneath them But this Article relates only to the  KnightsCompanions  not to the Sovereigns of the  Order  nor do we find that any of them had Plates of their Arms and Stiles set upon the back of their Stalls in manner as is before prescribed to the rest of the  KnightsCompanions  King  Henry  VIII in his Body of  Statutes  alters this Article in three particulars first as to the setting up their Plates which he appoints not to be after their Deaths but within after the Installation of every  KnightCompanion  secondly as to the nature of the Metal that it may be such as the Knight shall please himself And lastly as to the size though he also restrains the  KnightsSubjects  to a lesser than those of the first Founders yet he gives liberty to the  KnightsStrangers  to use their Plates and Fashions at Pleasure As to the first of these it has been  re  ty duly observed and indeed the second of making them of Copper but the last  viz  the size has been very little regarded for the very Plates of those Knights who were soon af  er installed and thence downwards a  e larger than those of the first F  under    In tract of time many of these Memorials were by  acrilegious Hands taken away whi  h King  Cha  les  I  taking notice of and desirous to put a stop to a Mischief not in his Power to prevent and to preserve the Remembrance of the precedent  KnightsCompanions  commanded the Dean of  Windsor  to describe the Stiles of those that remained in a Book which he accordingly did and deposited the same in the College But what became of this Book could not be afterwards discovered so that the most that could be done was to draw the Arms and Copy out the Stiles engraven on the Plates then remaining from whence the following Observations may be made  First That for many Years after the Institution of the  Order  the Plate whereon the Shield was engraved bore no other Inscription than the deceased Kn  ght's Name set at the Foot thereof under the Escutcheon of his Arms Afterwards the chief Title of Honour began to be added though now and then in the first and elder times both were omitted as also their Crests But about the beginning of King  Henry  VIII's Reign not only the Knight's chief Title but all othe  his Titles and Dignities whether Honorary or Officiary were drawn together in one Inscription concluding with that of Knight of this most Noble  Order  and which about the same time the  KnightsCompanions  used to insert in all their publick and private Instruments of Writing a Custom observed by the Knights of other Sovereigns  Orders  Abroad  At first the  KnightsCompanions  gave their Paternal Coats of Arms singly and without any Quarterings but toward the beginning of  Hen  V they began to add their Quarterings as appears from the Escutcheons of  Hugh  Lord  Burnel  who died  Hen  V Sir  Lewis R  bessart  and others Yet was not the same generally used but left to the Pleasure of the  KnightsCompanions  But of later times this very thing was thought of  uch concern that where a Knight has been elected who wanted Quarterings the Sovereign has been pleased to grant him another Coat of Arms to quarter with his Paternal Coat that his Banner which ought to hang over his Stall might not seem too naked  Soon after King  Henry  VIII's Accession the Knights compassed their Shields with the Royal  Garter  and thereon such as were Noblemen placed the Coronet  elonging to their Dignity As to Supporters we observe two  Plates to which they are added the one of  John Beaufort  the first Duke of  Somerset  of that Name elected  Hen  VI the other of  Anthony Widvile  Earl  Rivers  elected  Edw  IV and besides these till the Reign of King  Henry  VIII there is not another Example But then it gr  w into common usage as also the ingraving their peculiar Motto's or Devices upon the Plates  The Offering of Atchievements  § A third Honour paid to the defunct Knight is a most solemn Offering up his Atchievements at the High  Altar  namely the Banner of his Arms his Sword Helmet and Crest with its Mantlings all which had been set up over his Stall at his Installation The Ceremony of Offering these Ensigns does not appear to have been regulated at the Institution of the  Order  but rather added as an additional Honour by King  Henry  V and the manner thereof set down in the fourteenth Article of his Body of  Statutes  This Solemnity is local to the Chappel of St  George  within the Castle of  Windsor  and not to be performed  ill the Sovereign has notice of the  KnightCompanion's  Death  In  Edw  VI at the Feast then held at  Windsor  there arose a Question whether the Atchievements of King  Henry  VIII which yet hung over the Sovereign's Stall should be taken down and offered at the Mass of  Requiem  ensuing or not in regard his Banner Sword Helm and Crest with Mantles had been offered up before at his Interment within that Chappel In conclusion of which it was determined  That the said Atchievements shou'd not again be offered but remain over the Sovereign's Stall for his Son King  Edward VI But when the Sovereigns of this most Noble  Order  are not interred at  Windsor  then their Atchievements are offered up the next ensuing Feast as were those of Queen  Elizabeth  which the  BlueBook  notes to be done at Morning Prayer  As to the time for performing this Ceremony it was ordained to be on the Morrow after the Feast when the Mass was Sung for the Souls of the  KnightsC  mpanions  c and so was duly observed till the time of the Reformation when the Mass of  Requi  m  being abolished it was nevertheless at the M  rning S  rvic  on the Morrow immediately  after the Offertory But after Queen  Elizabeth  had removed the Feast of St  George  from  Windsor  this Solemnity was frequently di  patched in one Day before they went out of the  Choir  and the ancient Rule as to the time being thus broke was never after restored but generally performed the very same Morning wherein the elect Knights were installed And though the Day was thus changed yet the Ceremony it self was not performed till after the Installation was finished that Solemnity having always the Precedency till  Jac  I when he observing how incongruous it seemed to instal a new Knight before his Predecessor had been fully discharged of his Stall gave Order for Offering the Atchievements of Sir  Henry Lea  the Lord  Scroop  and others before the Instalment of the elect Knights  Not long after it was thought convenient to perform this Ceremony on the Eve of the Feast presently af  er the first  Vespers  began and next to proceed with the Installations whereby as much as possible the Stalls of the  KnightsCompanions  might be supplied in all the rest of the Solemnities of the Feast But if at any time any of the new elect Knights were introduced into the  Choir  before the Offering of the Atchievements began they were appointed to stand there under the Stalls designed for them till that Ceremony was finished  Thus it continued from the said  Jac  I till the  Car  II when it was performed at the time anciently accustomed for it the Prince of  Denmark  and the Duke of  Monmouth  being both installed before the first  Vespe  s  began and the Atchievements of the defunct Knights not offered till the Morrow after the Feast Day  As to the Manner and Order of this Ceremony among other Institutions of King  Henry  V it is appointed  That as often as through the vacancy of any Stall the Sword  Helms with the rest of the defunct Knights ought to be offered the Sword of the deceased Knight shall be first offered being carried up to the  High Altar  by two of the  KnightsCompanions  and afterwards the Helm with the Crest and Mantlings by two other  KnightsCompanions  and this Offering is to be made for them in the Order they were installed not as they died  But of the Offering of a defunct Knight's Banner we find no express mention till  Hen  VII at which time  the Banner of the Lord  Brook  was offered But afterwards the direction for Offering their Ensign and Banner was taken into King  Henry  VIII's Body of  Statutes  And since the same were introduced according to the foregoing Precedent it was to be offered first and so hath been generally observed  By the appointment of the  Statutes  of  H  nry  V the Sovereign is to nominate and assign the  Knights Compani  s  who are severally to perform this Ceremony and so is the direction in  Henry  VIII's  Statutes  But since the beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign the Knights have generally proceeded to this Offering according to their Seniority and when the Course ended then the  Seniors  began again There are likewise many Examples where the Sovereign's Lieutenant has joined in the Ceremony to assist the other Knights Nor is a Proxy or Deputy to be admitted to perform any part of the Ceremony though in the Offering of Money he ought  We shall next proceed to the Duties of the Prelate of the  Order  the Prebends and Officers of Arms  as their Services severally or jointly relate to the performance of this Ceremony First then the Prelate and two Prebends ought to proceed up to the  Altar  immediately before  Garter  summons down the  KnightsCompanions  to the Offering and there stand ready to receive the Atchievements as they are severally offered up  It is next the Duty of the  Provincial Kings  and  Heralds  to conduct the  KnightsCompanions  when they proceed up to the  Altar  bearing any part of the defunct Knight's Atchievements The whole Ceremony is briefly thus  First  Garter  rises from his Sea  and proceeds into the middle of the  Choir  where after his usual Obeysances he summons the  KnightsCompanions  to descend who come down and place themselves before their Stalls Whereupon  Clarenceux  and  Norroy  or in the ab  ence of either the  Senior Herald  or of both of the two eldest  Heralds    pass down from the Steps of the  Altar  into the Body of the  Choir  in the interim  Ga  ter  takes the  Banner  of the eldest defunct Knight and presents it half rolled up to the two  Senior KnightsCompanions  the two  Provincial Kings  by this time approaching them m  ke their double Reverences and after to the other  Knights  Companions  and then  tand a little aside  while the two  Senior  Knights  having taken the  Banner  between them make their double Reverence and pass up to the  Altar  preceeded by the Kings bearing it with the lower end of the Staff foremost and at the first  HautPas  make another double Reverence The  Provincial Kings  being arrived at the uppermost  HautPas  after an humble Obe  sance divide themselves to make way for the Knights to Offer who forthwith raise the Point of the  Banner  upwards and after a single Reverence toward the  Altar  pre  ent it upon their Knees to the Prelate of the  Order  who delivers it to two Canons and they deposite it upon Cus  ions laid before the  Altar  This done the two  Provincial Kings  conduct the Knights back into the  Choir  who with the usual Reverences retire to their Stations under not to their Stalls and the  Provincial Kings  to their on either side the  Altar  Next the two  Senior Heralds  pass down into the  Choir  as the  Provincial Kings  did whilst  Garter  taking up the Sword presents it to the two next  Senior  Knights who proceed to the  Altar  with the two  Heralds  before them in the same Order as before bearing the Sword between them and offer the same with the Pommel or Hilt upwards and then retire as before  In the next place the two next  Senior Heralds  go down as before and the  Helm  and  Crest  is offered in the like manner But the  Pursuivants  at  Arms  do no part of this Duty  Heretofore we find that  Garter  has not only begun this Solemnity by presenting the  Banner  but has also conducted the two  Senior  Knights to the  Altar  as he did  Eliz  by the  Banner  of the Lord  Grey  and at some other times It  as likewise the usage heretofore for the Pre  ate to deliver the offered Atchievements to some of the  H  alds  to be deposited near the  Altar  There is nothing on this farther observable than what rel  tes to the Atchievement it self which as  hey became by this Ceremony part of the Goods of the Chappel and i  cl  ded within the Wor  of the  Statutes  of the College wh  reby  he Sovereig  g  anted to the Dean and Can  ns all Ob  atio  s they could not be s  ld or alienated and were therefore dep  sited by them in the  ChapterHouse  But the  elms  and  Swords  because they were at first  orged  or the Service of War of an ex  raordinary large size have b  n  equently red  med that they might serve  again to the same uses And likewise because it belongs to  Garter  to provide Atchievements for new installed Knights he usually hath compounded with the Dean and Canons for the defunct Knight's Atchievements  Of depositing the deceased Knights  Mantles  in the  ChapterHouse  § In  Eliz  there passed a Decree  That the  Knight  Companions  should be bound by their Oaths to take care by their last Will that after their Decease all their Ornaments which they had receiv'd should be restored the R  bes to the College and the Jewels to the King that gave them  Sir  Christopher Hatton  complied with the Decree and sent his  Mantle  accordingly but that of Sir  Henry Lea  being left to the disposal of others and not sent to the College happened at length to come into the Hands of Brokers and was openly exposed to Sale in  Longlane  to the great dishonour of the  Order  This Decree was in after times but slackly observed and therefore in a  Chapter  held at  Windsor    Car  I  the Knights were admonished  That when the Sovereign should vouchsafe to bestow the  Mantle  of the  Order  t  e Knight should take care at his Death to have it sent to the Chappel at  Windsor according to the  Statutes  But this taking little Effect the Sovereign thought fit to restore vigorously the Law in this particular by a Decree in  Chapter    Car  I which obliged all  KnightsCompanions  receiving the Ensigns of the  Order  from the Sovereign to take care according to the tenor of their Oaths that these  together with the Book of  Statutes  should be restored in the Hands of the Sovereign after their Deaths and a Command was therewithal given  That certain  Books  Mantles  and  Surcoats  then lying at  WhiteHall  shou'd be delivered to the  Register  of the  Order  to be laid up at  Windsor  in honourable Memory of th  se to whom they belonged  In Observation of these Decrees where the  Habit  and  Ensigns  of the  Order  were either wholly or in part bestowed by the Sovereign Order was taken at the Decease of such  KnightsCompanions  to  end for them in again As a  a  Chapter  held  Car  I the  Ga  ter  and  George  of the Lord Treasurer  Weston  being sent back were presented to the Sovereign and after delivered to the  Dean  and  Chapter  of  Windsor  to be pr  served And in the same  Chapter  it was ordered that the Earl of  Kelly  's Robes and Ornaments of the  Order  should be sent for by the Chancellor  These former Decrees were yet thought needful to be confirm'd by King  Charles  II so that in a  Chapter  held at  WhiteHall  it was Decreed  That the Mantle of each  Knight Companion  with the Book of  Statutes should be sent to  Windsor  immediately after their Deaths  and that the Chancellor of the  Order  should be obliged by Letters to their Heirs and Executors to put them in mind of sending them thither  But it is to be understood that where the Mantle has been provided at the Knight's own Charge there is no obligation for returning them  Thus I have run through all the Particulars relating to the Institutions Laws and Ceremonies of this most Noble  Order  I shall in the last Place proceed to give a List of all those who have enjoyed this singular Mark of Honour from its first Foundation The Motives which excited the Royal Founder to set on Foot the said  Order  are already particularly treated of who having established  Rules  and  Statutes  for the Government and regulation thereof he next resolved to elect from among the Flower of his own Wars twen  y five of the most celebrated Knights who together with himself should make up the Number of Twenty six for of so many does the  O  der  by his Appointment consist And indeed that Age plentifully furnished him with Men of the most brave and celebrated Characters and of signal Reputation in Arms r  ed by the eminent Wars of those times and justly d  nguished by their own heroick Actions  The first that he elected into this Noble  Order  was  Edward  his eldest Son who already in part deserved a  d afterwards justly obtained the Title of a Brave and Martial Prince of whom our Histories speak so largel  T  rest of his accomplished Collegues were these that follow and
