 OBSERVATIONS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND LAKES OF Cumberland and Westmoreland  OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE CHIEFLY TO PICTURESQUE BEAUTY Made in the YEAR On several PARTS of ENGLAND PARTICULARLY THE MOUNTAINS AND LAKES OF CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORELAND  VOL I  By WILLIAM GILPIN M A PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEWFOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE STRAND MDCCLXXXVI  TO THE QUEEN  MADAM  AS your Majesty condescend∣ed to look into the following papers when they were in manuscript I hoped You would not think it pre∣sumption in me to ask your royal permission to present them to You in their more improved state and it gave me peculiar pleasure to ask this permission through the media∣tion of a Lady whose very respect∣able  character and revered age then bowing under one of the severest of God's dispensations the King and your Majesty took under your pro∣tection and with an amiable atten∣tion perhaps unequalled in the an∣nals of royalty have made that pro∣tection much less valuable even in it's bounty than in that easy grace which accompanies it and which in the same moment confers and annihilates the obligation  That your Majesties may be long preserved to enjoy the elegant amuse∣ment of the polite arts which You are so ready to incourage and the  heartfelt satisfaction of the sublimest virtues which You thus exemplify is the sincere prayer of  MADAM  Your MAJESTY'S most respectful most obedient and very humble servant WILLIAM GILPIN  PREFACE  THE following observations on various scenes of English landscape were writ∣ten about thirteen years ago They were at first thrown together warm from the subject each evening after the scene of the day had been presented and in a moment of more leisure were corrected and put into form but merely for the amusement of the writer himself who had not in truth at that time the least idea of their being able to furnish amusement to any body else A few only of his friends saw them One of them however  saw them with so partial an eye that he thought proper to mention them to the public  Mason's memoirs of Gray p  This raised the curiosity of many and laid the au∣thor under the necessity of producing his papers to a wider circle but still without any design of publishing them A sense of their imper∣fections and of the many difficulties in which such a work would engage him prevented any intention of that kind  Among others who desired to see them was the late duchess dowager of Portland a lady of whose superior character the world is well informed Having seen them soon after they were written and a second time after an inter∣val of seven or eight years her Grace pressed the author to print them most obligingly offering to facilitate an expensive publication by contributing largely to a subscription Tho the author chose to decline that mode of publi∣cation yet the duchess's persuasion was among his principal inducements to prepare his papers  for the public The presswork was about half completed at the time of her Grace's death  But tho this work hath been thus flattered and hath received considerable improvements both from the author himself during the many years it has lain by him and from several of his ingenious friends yet still he offers it to the public with apprehension  His apprehension is first grounded on the inadequate time he had to employ in making observations on the several landscapes he has described No one can paint a country properly unless he hath seen it in various lights The following descriptions are faithful copies it is hoped of each scene under the cir∣cumstances in which it appeared at the time it was described But he who should see any one scene as it is differently affected by a lower∣ing sky or a bright one might probably  see two very different landscapes He might not only see distances blotted out or splen∣didly exhibited but he might even see va∣riations produced in the very objects them∣selves and that merely from the different times of the day in which they were ex∣amined The summit of a mountain for instance which in a morning appears round may discover when enlightened by an evening ray a double top Rocks and woods take different shapes from the different directions of light while the hues and tints of objects on which their effect in a great measure depends are continually changing Nay we sometimes see in a mountainous country espe∣cially a variation of light alter the whole disposition of a landscape In a warm sun∣shine the purple hills may skirt the horizon and appear broken into numberless pleasing forms but under a sullen sky a total change may be produced the distant mountains and all their beautiful projections may dis∣appear and their place be occupied by a dead  flat All the author could do to obviate difficulties of this kind was to specify in general under what kind of light and weather the several landscapes he saw were exhibited  In his views of lakescenery indeed which form the principal part of the following work he has less cause to fear and offers his obser∣vations with more confidence Among these scenes he rested some time and tho he saw each scene but once yet as he spent near a week among them he saw so much of their varieties that he could make allowances for the effects of light and weather and could speak of them in general with more precision  He is under another apprehension from the variations which  time  as well as  weather  produces in scenery Even the wild features of nature suffer continual change from various causesinclosurescanalsquarriesbuild∣ings and above all from the growth or  destruction of timber And if the wild scenes of nature suffer change how much more may we expect to observe it in the improvement of particular places which are professedly alter∣ing with the taste or fancy of their owners Few of these scenes continue long the same The growth of trees and shrubs is continually making changes in them even in a natural course It is probable therefore that many of the embellished scenes described in the follow∣ing work are now totally changed and that the author hath rather exhibited a history of the past than a representation of the present Thirteen or fourteen years bring a shrub to perfection After that period if the knife be not freely used a shrubbery from mere natural causes will of itself decay  Lakescenery it is true is less subject to change The broader the features are the less they will vary Water which makes the grand part of this kind of scenery remains un∣altered by time and the rocks and mountains which inviron the lake are as little subject to  variation as any of the materials of landscape can be Wood is the only feature which can have suffered any considerable change In this indeed great devastation hath been made in se∣veral of the northern lakes especially in that of Keswick  Those beautiful scenes produced formerly great quantities of valuable timber which adorned the banks of the lake and inriched it's lofty skreens But after the rebellion of the year these lands together with all the other estates of the unfortunate earl of Derwentwater were forfeited to the crown and were given by George I to increase the endowment of Greenwichhospital the trus∣tees of which immediately sold and cut down almost all the timber  Before this depredation the lake of Keswick was a glorious scene No one however now remembers it in it's splendor Since that time it hath suffered little change Yet some it hath suffered Two woods neither of them inconsiderable on the two opposite sides of the  lake one belonging to the Derwentwater estate the other to lord Egremont have been de∣stroyed The author uses the word  destroyed  because of the barbarous method of cutting timber which prevails in the northern coun∣ties In the south of England the proprietor sends an experienced surveyor into his woods who marks such timber as is fit for the axe leaving all the young thriving trees behind The wood therefore if fenced soon rears again its ancient honours and becomes a pe∣rennial nursery In the north it is otherwise There the merchant agrees for the wood alto∣gether as it stands and the proprietor for the sake of a present advantage suffers him to lay the whole flat Nothing but a copse springs up in its room and all succession of timber is prevented This hath operated among other causes in the general destruction of timber in the northern counties  The author believes the lake of Keswick hath suffered these two last mentioned depre∣dations since the following remarks were made  but as he is informed the underwood hath in∣creased considerably and hath in many parts added some degree of richness to the moun∣tains and promontaries around the lake he is not apprehensive that any changes in so short an interval can in any material way affect his descriptions It is true there will ever be a great difference between the grandeur of a wood and the poverty of a copse and  on the spot  it will be evident enough but in all the  distances  of these extensive views it will not so easily be observed  Another ground of the author's apprehen∣sion is that he may be thought too severe in his strictures  on scenes of art  The grand natural scene will always appear so superior to the embellished artificial one that the pic∣turesque eye in contemplating the former will be too apt to look contemptuously on the latter This is just as arrogant as to despise a propriety because it cannot be classed with  a cardinal virtue Each mode of scenery hath it's station A wild forest scene contiguous to a noble mansion would be just as absurd as an embellished one in the midst of a forest  A house is an  artificial  object and the scenery around it  must  in some degree par∣take of  art  Propriety requires it conve∣nience demands it But if it partake of  art  as allied to the  mansion  it should also partake of  nature  as allied to the  country  It has therefore two characters to support and may be considered as the connecting thread between the regularity of the house and the freedom of the natural scene These two characters it should ever have in view  Under this regulation the business of the embellished scene is to make every thing con∣venient and comfortable around the houseto remove offensive objects and to add a pleasing foreground to the distance If there be no distance it must depend the more on it's own beauties But still in every circumstance it must well observe it's double character  and discover as much of the simplicity of nature as is consistent with it's artificial al∣liance If the scene be large it throws off art by degrees the more it recedes from the mansion and approaches the country  It is true we cannot well admit the em∣bellished scene among objects  purely picturesque  It is too trim and neat for the pencil which ever delights in the bold free negligent strokes and roughnesses of natureabhorring in it's wild sallies the least intrusion of artor how∣ever allowing only the admission of such ob∣jects as have about them the carelessness the simplicity and the freedom of nature Such in a particular manner are ruins Objects indeed of a more formal kind as buildings and ship∣ping are sufferedsometimes for the sake of contrastand sometimes for the pleasing ideas they excite but as objects of picturesque beauty we utterly reject them till they have deposited all their square formalities The building must be thrown into perspective the ship foreshortened and it's sails varied before they  must presume to attract the notice of the picturesque eye  The embellished scene hath still more of this formal mixture But tho it is not enough marked with the bold free characters of nature to be purely picturesque it is still under it's proper regulations a very beautiful species of landscape It hath beauties peculiar to itself and if it astonish us not with grandeur and sublimity it pleases with symmetry and elegance  In the body of his book the author hath ventured to call the  embellished scene  one of the peculiar features of English landscape  See page  But we must still lament that this beautiful mode of composition is oftener aimed at than at∣tained It's double alliance with art and nature is rarely observed with perfect impar∣tiality Ambitious ornaments generally take the lead and nature is left behind  Where little improprieties offend they are readily passed over But where the offence against nature becomes capital it is not easy to repress indignation  In so extensive a tour as the following pages contain it must be supposed that a variety of very disgusting scenes of this kind would occur scenes in which nature was forcedin which she was arrayed in alien beautiesor overloaded with tawdry ornaments In truth such scenes often did occur But the author however severe he may be thought hath endeavoured to proceed on principles which he hoped could not reasonably give offence He studiously checked all severity of criticism where the im∣prover  still enjoyed his scene  It would have hurt him to have disturbed the  innocent  tho perhaps  tasteless  amusements of any one Tho he should not have chosen to speak senti∣ments not his own yet he could always be silent or look aside where he did not wish to examine But where the improver of the scene was dead especially when his works were  published  by being thrown open to curiosity the author thought himself at perfect liberty All such scenes he considered as fair game He hath without scruple therefore remarked freely upon them and hath endeavoured to point out the many strange errors and absurdities to which an inattention to nature hath given birth  quorum velut aegri somnia vanae  Finguntur species ut nec pes nec caput uni  Reddatur formae  But even here he hath avoided  all general unmarked censure  which he considers as the garb of  slander  He hath always accompanied his  criticisms  with  reasons  and if the reason have no force the criticism falls of course  It may be objected perhaps that the author hath wrought up many of his descriptions in the following work higher than the simpli∣city of prosaic language may allow Simplicity no doubt is the foundation of beauty in every  species of composition but the simplicity of a familiar letter differs from the simplicity of history and the simplicity of a poem from the simplicity of boththat is one work may be more highly coloured than another and wrought up with warmer language and a greater variety of images Now the following work at least the descriptive parts of it ap∣proach as near the idea of poetic composition as any kind of prosaic writing can do It is the aim of  picturesque description  to bring the images of nature as forcibly and as closely to the eye as it can and this must often be done by highcolouring which this species of com∣position demands By  highcolouring  is not meant  a string of rapturous epithets  which is the feeblest mode of description but an attempt to analize the views of natureto open their se∣veral parts in order to shew the effect of a whole to mark their tints and varied lightsand to express all this detail in terms as appropriate and yet as vivid as possible In attempting this if the language be  forced  and  inflated  no doubt  it is the just object of criticism but if tho highly coloured it keep within the  Descriptas vices operisque colores  it may be hoped it will escape censure  The author fears too he may be called on to apologize for the many digressions he hath made But if in this point he hath erred he hath erred with his best judgment Whether his work be considered as didactic or descrip∣tive as in fact it is intended to be a species between both he thought it wanted some little occasional relief Travelling continually among rocks and mountains hills and vallies and remarking upon them he feared might be tedious and therefore when any observations anecdote or history grew naturally from his subject he was glad to take the advantage of it and draw the reader a little aside that he might return to the principal object with less satiety This too is poetic licence What in  argument would be absurd in works of amuse∣ment may be necessary If any of these di∣gressions however should appear forcedout of placeor unconnected with the subject for  them  he wishes to apologize  The author hopes no one will be so severe as to think a work of this kind tho a work only of amusement inconsistent with the pro∣fession of a clergyman He means not to address himself to the lax notions of the age to which he is no way apprehensive of giving offence but he should be sorry to hurt the feelings of the most serious How far field sports and a variety of other diversions which may be proper in some stations are quite agreeable to the clerical one is a subject he means not to discuss Yet surely the study of nature in every shape is allowable and affords amuse∣ment which the severest cannot well repre∣hendthe study of the heavensof the earth of the fieldof the garden it's productions  fruits and flowersof the bowels of the earth containing such amazing stores of curiosity and of animal life through all it's astonishing varieties even to the shell and the insect Among these objects of rational amusement may we not enumerate also the beautiful ap∣pearances of the face of nature  The ground indeed which the author hath taken that of examining landscape by the  rules of picturesque beauty  seems rather a deviation from  nature  to  art  Yet in fact it is not so for the  rules of picturesque beauty  we know are drawn from  nature  so that to examine the face of nature by these rules is no more than to examine nature by her own most beautiful exertions Thus Shakespear  There is an art  Which does mend Naturechange it rather but  That art itself is Nature  The author however hopes he should not greatly err if he allowed also the amusements furnished by the three sisterarts to be all very consistent with the strictest rules of the clerical profession The only danger is lest the  amuse∣ment  the fascinating amusementshould press on improperly and interfere too much with the  employment  In a little work of the picturesque kind  Observations on the River Wye and several parts of South Wales  which the author printed about three years ago he gave several drawings under the character of  portraits  rather induced by the partiality of his friends than his own judgment He was sensible that sketches taken in the hasty manner in which those were taken could not pretend to the accuracy necessary in portrait He endeavoured however to guard his readers against considering them as such by saying they meant only  to give some idea of the general effect of a scene but in no degree to mark the several picturesque and ornamental particulars of which it is composed  But he himself thought and so he doubts not did the public that this was an insufficient apology for they were  certainly not accurate enough to give even the  general effect of a scene  In the drawings presented in this work he hath followed more his own judgment Ex∣cept a few he hath given nothing that pre∣tends to the name of  portrait  sensible that the hasty drawings he made in this tour which were certainly made without any intention of publication did not deserve it Indeed Mr Farington's prints render any other  portraits  of the lakes unnecessary They are by far in the author's opinion the most accurate and beautiful views of that romantic country which he hath seen The fall of Lodoar and the view of Derwentwater with the mountain of Skiddaw as a background from Brandelow woods are particularly fineThe principal drawings which are preserved in the following work are of two kinds  One kind is meant to  illustrate and explain picturesque ideas  This indeed may be con∣sidered among the most useful aids of the pen∣cil  Intellectual ideas  it cannot reach but  picturesque ideas  are all cloathed in  bodily forms  and may often be explained better by a few strokes of the pencil than by a volume of the most laboured description  The other sort of drawings is meant to  characterize the countries  through which the reader is carried The ideas are taken from the  general face of the country  not from any  particular scene  And indeed this may per∣haps be the most useful way of conveying local ideas For a  portrait  characterizes only a  single spot  The idea must be relinquished as soon as the place is passed But such imaginary views as give  a general idea of a country  spread themselves more diffusely and are carried in the reader's imagination through the  whole description  But whatever becomes of their  utility  they are beyond all doubt the  most picturesque  kind of drawings Portraits may be faithful but they are rarely in every part beautiful The distance may be finethe ruin may be elegant yet will there always be some awkwardness in  one part or other which you would wish to remove But truth forbids If you are de∣termined to call nothing a  portrait  but what is  exactly  copied from nature you must take it as it is good and bad and make the best of it  The fact is you may often find a  beautiful dis∣tance  Remote objects tho sometimes awkward do not always strike the eye with their awkward∣nesses The obscurity occasioned by the in∣tervening medium softens each line or tint that is harsh or discordant But as the landscape  advances on the eye  the deformity grows more apparent and on the  foreground  objects are so magnified that it is very rare indeed if they do not in some part offend Their features become then so strong that if they be not beautiful they are disgusting  On the other hand he who works  from imagination  that is he who culls from na∣ture the most beautiful parts of her productions a  distance  here and there a  foreground  combines them artificially and removing every  thing offensive admits only such parts as are  congruous  and  beautiful  will in all probability make a much better landscape than he who takes all as it comes and without selecting beauties copies only what he sees presented in each particular scene  But you wish for the representation of some  particular scene  It is truth you desire and not fiction  Who objects But even here you must allow a little to the imagination or your scene will probably never please What is it that you  admire  Is it  the spot you stand on  Or is it the grandeur of  some lake  a  cove of moun∣tains  an  inriched distance  the  windings  of a noble riveror some other exhibition which is in fact much to be admired This noble scene whatever it is you wish to see set off to the best advantage In order therefore to give this advantage to the  part you admire  you must allow your artist to take some liberty with the  ground he stands on  which is evidently  not  the part you admire and probably abounds with deformities  It is not meant to give him licence instead of liberty Of the grand exhibition before him which is the portrait you want he must take a faithful copy If  it  present any striking de∣formity it is not a subject for the pencil it should be relinquished But if it be pure in all it's parts the foreground should be made equal to it Yet nothing should be introduced alien to the scene presented Such alterations only your artist should make as the nature of the country allows and the beauty of composition requires Trees he may generally plant or remove at pleasure If a withered stump suit the form of his landscape better than the spread∣ing oak which he finds in nature he may make the exchangeor he may make it if he wish for a spreading oak where he finds a withered trunk He has no right we allow to add a magnificent castlean impending rockor a river to adorn his foreground These are  new features  But he may certainly  break an illformed hillock and shovel the earth about him as he pleases without offence He may pull up a piece of awkward paling he may throw down a cottagehe may even turn the course of a road or a river a few yards on this side or that These trivial al∣terations may greatly add to the beauty of his composition and yet they interfere not with the truth of  portrait  Most of these things may  in fact  be altered tomorrow tho they disgust today The road and the river it is true keep their station but the change you desire is so trifling that the eye of truth can never be offended tho the picturesque eye may be exceedingly gratified There is a very beautiful scene on the banks of the Tay near Perth which in composition is correctly pic∣turesque except only that the river forming two parallel lines with the sides of the picture enters the foreground at right angles So offensive a form could not but injure the beauty of any landscape Would the truth of portrait be injured in painting this subject if trees  were planted to hide the deformity or a small turn given to the river to break it's disgust∣ing regularity  The author means not however to offer the  portraits  and  illustrations  he hath here given as perfect examples of the principles he hath laid down It is a difficult matter for any artist at least who does not claim as a pro∣fessional man to reach his own ideas What he represents will ever fall short of what he ima∣gines With regard to  figures  particularly the author wishes to premise that the rules laid down in the beginning of the second volume page c are here little observed Those remarks were chiefly intended for works in a larger style Figures on so small a scale as these are not capable of receiving character They are at best only what he calls  pictu∣resque appendages  Besides the representations here given have again sustained a loss by going through a trans∣lation in so rough and unmanageable a lan∣guage as that of brass and aquafortis The  mode of etching chosen is the newly invented one of aquatinta which is certainly the softest and comes the nearest to the idea of drawing But this species of etching itself tho even managed by a masterly hand is sub∣ject to great inconveniences especially when a large number of prints are taken from one plate It is impossible to make lights graduate as they oughtto keep distances pure and to give those strong characteristic touches to objects which may be done with a brush in  drawing  Unavoidable defects however the candid will excuse and may rest assured that the author took all the pains he could by correcting the proofs to make the plates what he wished them  TABLE OF CONTENTS TO VOLUME I  SECTION I  GREAT features of English

picturesque beauty of particular places it may not be amiss to take a slight view of those great features on which picturesque beauty in landscape so much depends  Almost the whole of the  western  coast of England is mountainous and rocky and as  it approaches the sea it is often scooped into large bays and inlets invironed by promonto∣ries  On the  eastern  side the coast consists chiefly of low flat sandy shores from the mouth of the Thames as far as Scarborough in York∣shire where the coast first becomes rocky At this point it deviates so much from the general character it has thus far maintained that the river Derwent which rises very near the sea instead of entering it directly retires from it and joins the Humber at the dis∣tance of forty milesFrom Scarborough the eastern coast assumes the character of the western and is more or less rocky as far as the Tweed  The  southern  coast lying between countries of such different characters participates of both  Such is the general idea of the great  bounda∣ries  of England  If we leave the coast and take a view of the internal parts of the country we find the  southern  counties much varied with hill and dale The  western  rather approach the moun∣tainous character almost the whole of Wales  is in that style of landscape But in the  mid∣land  and  eastern  parts we scarce find any ele∣vation that deserves to be mentioned they are generally level till we arrive near the centre of the island  In Derbyshire the first mountainous coun∣try begins There the high lands forming themselves by degrees into a chain of moun∣tains direct their course towards the northwest They first divide Lancashire from York∣shire then entering Westmoreland they spread themselves over the whole of that county and a part of Cumberland Again contracting them∣selves into a chain and forming the limits be∣tween Cumberland and Northumberland they continue their course northward and enter ScotlandIt is in the various parts of this vast combination of mountains to which we may add those of Wales where the admirers of the beautiful and sublime in English landscape are chiefly gratified  There is another grand feature that may be noticed in the internal parts of England and that is the vast beds of chalk which are found in various parts  A chalky soil has indeed not so great an effect on the picturesque form of a country as rocks and mountains and yet it's effect is not incon∣siderable It generally produces a peculiar style of landscapean impoverished kind without the grandeur of the rocky country or the chear∣ful luxuriance of the sylvan It runs out com∣monly into wide diffusive downs swelling into frequent elevations These are it's usual cha∣racters where the chalk approaches nearest the surface but as it runs at various depths it has of course in many places very little effect on landscape In the lower grounds where the rains through a succession of ages have washed the soil from the higher you see often a very luxuriant vegetation  The great central  patria  of chalk if I may so phrase it seems to be in the contiguous parts of Berkshire Wiltshire Dorsetshire and Hamp∣shire From this vast bed three principal ridges of it extend  The first leaving Berkshire crosses the Thames and running northward through Buckingham∣shire enters Bedfordshire and ends about Dun∣stable beyond which chalk is never found  A second running eastward occupies great part of Surrey and turning near Dartford to  the southeast continues in that direction form∣ing high grounds till it meet the sea abruptly at Dover  The third great ridge takes a more southerly course occupying a vast tract near eighty miles in length tho scarce any where above four miles broad which is known by the name of the Southdowns of Sussex Portsdown may be considered as a branch of this ridge  Besides these three great ridges it appears in a few other detached parts but very rarely  Similar remarks might be made with some accuracy on the effects which other soils have on landscape But as these effects are not so striking I wish not to appear refined I shall only observe in general that the variety and intermixture of soils and strata in this island are very great  From whatever cause it proceeds certain I believe it is that this country exceeds most countries in the  variety  of it's picturesque beau∣ties I should not wish to speak merely as an Englishman the suffrages of many travellers  and foreigners of taste I doubt not might be adduced  In some or other of the  particular species  of landscape it may probably be excelled Swit∣zerland may perhaps exceed it in the beauty of it's wooded vallies Germany in it's riverviews and Italy in it's lakescenes But if it yield to some of these countries in  particular  beauties I should suppose that on the  whole  it transcends them all It exhibits perhaps more variety of hill and dale and level ground than is any where to be seen in so small a com∣pass It's rivers assume every character diffu∣sive winding and rapid It's estuaries and coastviews are varied of course from the form and rockiness of it's shores It's moun∣tains and lakes tho they cannot perhaps rival as I have just observed some of the choice lakes of Italyabout Tivoli especially where the most perfect models of this kind of landscape are said to be presented are yet in  variety  I pre∣sume equal to the lakescenery of any country  But besides the  variety  of it's beauties in some or other of which it may be rivalled it  possesses some beauties which are  peculiar  to itself  One of these peculiar features arises from the  intermixture  of wood and cultivation which is found oftener in English landscape than in the landscape of other countries In France in Italy in Spain and in most other places cul∣tivation and wood have their separate limits Trees grow in detached woods and cultivation occupies vast unbounded common fields But in England the custom of dividing property by hedges and of planting hedgerows so uni∣versally prevails that almost wherever you have cultivation there also you have wood  Now altho this regular intermixture produces often deformity on the nearer grounds yet at a distance it is the source of great beauty On the spot no doubt and even in the first dis∣tances the marks of the spade and the plough the hedge and the ditch together with all the formalities of hedgerow trees and square di∣visions of property are disgusting in a high de∣gree But when all these regular forms are softened by distancewhen hedgerow trees begin to unite and lengthen into streaks along  the horizonwhen farmhouses and ordinary buildings lose all their vulgarity of shape and are scattered about in formless spots through the several parts of a distanceit is inconceiva∣ble what richness and beauty this mass of de∣formity when melted together adds to land∣scape One vast tract of wild uncultivated country unless either varied by large parts or under some peculiar circumstances of light cannot produce the effect Nor is it produced by unbounded tracts of cultivation which without the intermixture of wood cannot give richness to distanceThus English landscape affords a species of  rich distance  which is rarely to be found in any other countryYou have likewise from this intermixture of wood and cultivation the advantage of being sure to find a tree or two on the foreground to adorn any beautiful view you may meet with in the distance  Another peculiar feature in the landscape of this country arises from the great quantity of English oak with which it abounds The oak of no country has equal beauty nor does any tree answer all the purposes of scenery so well The oak is the noblest ornament of a  foreground spreading from side to side it's tortuous branches and foliage rich with some autumnal tint In a distance also it appears with equal advantage forming itself into beau∣tiful clumps varied more in shape and per∣haps more in colour than the clumps of any other tree The pine of Italy has it's beauty hanging over the broken pediment of some ruined temple The chestnut of Calabria is con∣secrated by adorning the foregrounds of Sal∣vator The elm the ash and the beech have all their respective beauties but no tree in the forest is adapted to all the purposes of landscape like English oak  Among the peculiar features of English land∣scape may be added the embellished garden and parkscene In other countries the environs of great houses are yet under the direction of formality The wonderworking hand of art with it's regular cascades spouting fountains flights of terraces and other atchievements have still possession of the gardens of kings and princes In England alone the model of nature is adopted  This is a mode of scenery intirely of the sylvan kind As we seek among the wild works of nature for the sublime we seek here for the beautiful and where there is a variety of lawn wood and water and these naturally combined and not too much decorated with buildings nor disgraced by fantastic ornaments we find a species of landscape which no country but England can display in such perfection not only because this just species of taste prevails no where else but also because no where else are found such proper materials The want of English oak as we have just observed can never be made up in this kind of landscape es∣pecially Nor do we any where find so close and rich a verdure An easy swell may every where be given to ground but it cannot every where be covered with a velvet turf which con∣stitutes the beauty of an embellished lawn  The moisture and vapoury heaviness of our atmosphere which produces the rich verdure of our lawns gives birth also to another pecu∣liar feature in English landscapethat obscurity which is often thrown over distance In warmer climates especially the air is purer Those mists  and vapours which steam from the ground at night are dispersed with the morningsun Under Italian skies very remote objects are seen with great distinctness And this mode of vi∣sion no doubt has it's beauty as have all the works and all the operations of natureBut at best this is only one mode of vision Our grosser atmosphere which likewise hath it's seasons of purity exhibits various modes some of which are in themselves more beautiful than the most distinct vision  The several degrees of obscurity which the heaviness of our atmosphere gives to landscape may be reduced to three  haziness mists  and  fogs  Haziness  just adds that light grey tintthat thin dubious veil which is often beautifully spread over landscape It hides nothing It only sweetens the hues of natureit gives a consequence to every common object by giving it a more indistinct formit corrects the glare of coloursit softens the harshness of lines and above all it throws over the face of land∣scape that harmonizing tint which blends the whole into unity and repose  Mist  goes farther It spreads still more ob∣scurity over the face of nature As haziness  softens and adds a beauty perhaps to the  cor∣rectest  form of landscape mist is adapted to those landscapes in which we want to hide much to soften more and to throw many parts into a greater distance than they naturally occupy  Even the  fog  which is the highest degree of a gross atmosphere is not without it's beauty in landscape especially in the mountainscenes which are so much the object of the following remarks When partial as it often is the effect is grandest When some vast promon∣tory issuing from a cloud of vapour with which all it's upper parts are blended shoots into a lake the imagination is left at a loss to dis∣cover whence it comes or to what height it aspires The effect rises with the obscurity and the view is sometimes wonderfully great  To these natural features which are in a great degree peculiar to the landscape of Eng∣land we may lastly add another of the artificial kindthe ruins of abbeys which being natu∣ralized to the soil might indeed without much impropriety be classed among it's natural beau∣ties  Ruins are commonly divided into two kinds castles and abbeys Of the former few coun∣tries perhaps can produce so many as this island for which various causes may be assigned The feudal system which lasted long in England and was carried high produced a number of castles in every part King Stephen's reign contributed greatly to multiply them And in the northern counties the continued wars with Scotland had the same effect Many of these buildings now fallen into decay remain ob∣jects of great beauty  In the ruins of castles however other coun∣tries may compare with ours But in the re∣mains of abbeys no country certainly can  Where popery prevails the abbey is still in∣tire and inhabited and of course less adapted to landscape  But it is the mode of architecture which gives such excellence to these ruins The Gothic style in which they are generally com∣posed is I apprehend unrivalled among foreign nations and may be called a peculiar feature in English landscape  Many of our ruins have been built in what is often called the Saxon style This is a coarse heavy mode of architecture and seldom affords  a beautiful ruin In general the Saxon pre∣vails most in the northern counties and the Gothic in the southern tho each division of the kingdom affords some instances of both and in many we find them mixed  What we call Saxon architecture seems to have been the awkward imitation of Greek and Roman models What buildings of Roman origin were left in England were probably destroyed by the ruthless Saxon in his early ravages Afterwards when Alfred the great having established government and religion turned his view to arts we are told he was obliged to send to the continent for architects In what species of architecture the buildings of this prince were composed we know not but probably in a purer style than what we now call Saxon as Alfred lived nearer Roman times and perhaps possessed in his own coun∣try some of those beautiful models which might have escaped the rage of his ancestors Even now amidst all that heaviness and barbarism which we call Saxon it is not difficult to trace some features of Roman origin Among the ruins of Brinkburnabbey between Rothbury and Warkworth in Northumberland we dis∣cover in some parts even Roman elegance  This species of architecture is supposed to have continued till the time of the crusades when a new style of  ornament  at least fantastic in the highest degree began to appear It forms a kind of composite with the Saxon and hath been called by some antiquarians the Saracenic tho others disallow the term Many ruins of this kind are still existing  The English architect however began by degrees to strike out a new mode of architec∣ture for himself without searching the conti∣nent for models This is called the Gothic but for what reason it is hard to say for the Goths who were never in England had been even forgotten when it was invented which was about the reign of Henry II It is besides found no where I believe but in England except in such parts of France as were in pos∣session of the English  In this beautiful species of architecture the antiquarian points out three periods  When it first appeared the round Saxon arch began to change into the pointed one and the short clumsy pillar began to cluster but still the Saxon heaviness in part prevailed Salis∣burycathedral which was finished about the year is generally considered as a very  pure specimen of the Gothic in it's first and ruder form  By degrees improvements in architecture were introduced The eastwindow being inlarged was trailed over with beautiful scrawlwork while the clusteredpillar began to increase in height and elegance and to arch and ramify along the roof In short an intire new mode of architecture purely British was introduced The grandeur of the Romanthe heaviness of the Saxonand the grotesque ornament of the Saracenic were all equally relinquished An airy lightness pervaded the whole and orna∣ments of a new invention took place The cathedral of York and part of Canterbury among many others are beautiful examples of this period of Gothic architecture  About the time of the later Henries the last period began to obtain in the architecture of which the flat stone roof and a variety of dif∣ferent ornaments were the chief characteristics Of this inriched style King's college chapel in Cambridge and Henry VII's at Westminster are two of the most elegant examples The flat stone roof is generally even at this day considered as a wonderful effort of art It is said that Sir Christopher Wren himself could  not conceive it He would say  Tell me where to place the first stone and I will follow it with a second  This style is generally considered as the per∣fection of Gothic architecture I own it rather appears to me the decline of the art The or∣naments so affectedly introduced and patched on as the rose and portcullis in King's college chapel have not in my eye the beauty of the middle style in which every ornament arises naturally from the several members of the building and makes a part of the pile itself Nor has the flat roof with all it's ornaments in my opinion the simplicity and beauty of the ribbed and pointed one  Abbeys formerly abounded so much in Eng∣land that a delicious valley could scarce be found in which one of them was not stationed The very sites of many of these ancient edifices are now obliterated by the plough yet still so many elegant ruins of this kind are left that they may be called not only one of the pecu∣liar features of English landscape but may be ranked also among it's most picturesque beau∣ties  SECT II  May th  IN the following tour we meant to travel the western road through Oxfordshire War∣wickshire Staffordshire Cheshire and Lanca∣shire into Westmoreland and Cumberland where we proposed to make the lakes and moun∣tains the chief objects of our attention and to return through Yorkshire Derbyshire Leices∣tershire and Northamptonshire  We crossed first into the great Bath road through Kingston in Surrey over Hounslow∣heath which is a dead flat together with the country around it You seem to be always in the center of a circle of four or five miles in diameter This flat is a little relieved by a view  of the towers of Windsorcastle rising at the distance of three or four miles on the left but it is no very considerable object from the road  About the twentyfourth stone the eye begins to get a little out of the circle breaking from it into the country but it can yet make only short excursions  The first striking scenery is the woodybank of Taplow which hanging over the Thames and crowned with Cliefdenhouse seated loftily among the highest woods makes a grand ap∣pearance  On the road towards Henly the views which may be called  first distances  are not un∣pleasing They consist of little knolls in va∣rious shapes covered with beech  The new road down Henlyhill is a noble work From the  lower  grounds when the work was new and the chalk was continually shivering from the top it had the whimsical appearance of a vast sheet of water  Henly lies pleasantly at the bottom of woody hills on the banks of the Thames but the chalk bursting every where from the soil is disagreeable When a white spot has a mean∣ing as in a wicket or a seat if it be only a spot it may often have a good effect but when it forces itself on the eye in large unmeaning patches it never fails to disturb the landscape  From Henly we still continued among woody hills but they became more detached and un∣pleasing Before we reached Nettlebed the road passed through a beechengrove which lasted about a mile and on our leaving it we were presented with extensive distances These roads have all been made at a great expence as they are frequently cut through chalky hills  From Bensington the rising grounds on the left along the Thames at a second distance give some little beauty to the offskip as far as Dorchester From thence to Oxford the country grows more flat and unpleasant running some∣times  into common fields and sometimes into barren wastes  The village of Nuneham through which the road passes was built by Lord Harcourt for his cottagers and with that regularity which per∣haps gives the most convenience to the dwell∣ings of men For this we readily relinquish the picturesque idea Indeed I question whe∣ther it were possible for a single hand to build a picturesque village Nothing contributes more to it than the various styles in building which result from the different ideas of different peo∣ple When all these little habitations happen to unite harmoniously and to be connected with the proper appendages of a villagea winding roada number of spreading treesa rivulet with a bridgeand a spire to bring the whole to an apexthe village is compleat  Nunehamhouse stands a little out of the London road about six miles from Oxford The old familyseat of StantonHarcourt where Pope and Gay led the muses is now a deserted ruin It's situation was vile compared with  that of the present house which commands from a rising ground an extensive prospect over all the intervening flat as far as the towers of Oxford In another direction it overlooks the windings of the Thames towards Abingdon These grand views terminated by the Berk∣shire hills and other rising grounds compose the distance and are presented from different places around the house particularly from a terrace which extends at least a mile The accompaniment also of noble trees on the foreground sets off the distant scenery to great ad∣vantage  One of the most striking features in these scenes is the parishchurch which was de∣designed by Mr Stuart in the form of a Grecian temple of the Ionic order  We are the less able however to speak with any precision of the beauty of these scenes as a wet evening prevented our examining them as we could have wished  The house is fitted up usefully and elegantly as if intended rather for comfort than ostenta∣tion The pictures seem in general a wellchosen collection But we had neither time nor light to examine them thoroughly  And yet this is not so disadvantageous a cir∣cumstance as it may appear A distinction may be made between the furniturepicture and the cabinet one The furniturepicture should have it's full effect as a  whole  The  composition  especially the  distribution of light  and the  harmony of colouring  should be well understood These things will give it value by pleasing the eye in a transient unexamined view tho it may not so well bear a nicer scrutinyAnd indeed in forming a judgment of such a picture a cursory eye may form the best It is not under the fascination and delusion which the detail of a studied picture may throw over it but judges freely of it's  general effect  At the same time a picture which does not thus for∣cibly strike the eye at once may yet well re∣ward an accurate examination and indeed may be in itself a more valuable picture the parts may be more excellent the  expression  the  grace  the  drawing  and  local colouring  But what∣ever excellences such a picture may possess if it do not  please at sight  it seems fitter for a paint∣er's chamber or a curious cabinet than for a saloon or a drawingroom  Among the pictures in this collection which particularly pleased the eye at sight were two  beggars by Murillosome figures representing night by Castellia landscape by Daker and another by Ruisdael  Here are two or three histories by Poussin which having turned black with age leave us to regret that so able a master tho he was never perhaps an excellent colourist should have been so little acquainted with the nature of colours The Flemish school in general seem to have had the best preparations But it might yet perhaps be useful in painting if the nature of pigments could be brought more to a cer∣tainty and that the painter like the apothe∣cary had a sound dispensatory to direct his practice  To enter into an examination of the several buildings chapels halls libraries pictures and gardens of Oxford would have engaged us in too great a work We left Oxford therefore behind and proceeded to WoodstockThe road still continues through a flat country It may be called a kind of cultivated dreariness  The heaviness and enormity of Blenheimcastle have been greatly criticized perhaps too severely We may be too much bigotted to Greek and Roman architecture  In the following observations on Greek and Roman ar∣chitecture I am much indebted to Mr Lock  It was adapted often to local convenience Under an Italian sun for instance it was of great impor∣tance to exclude warmth and give a current to air The portico was well adapted to this pur∣pose  A slavish imitation also of antique orna∣ments may be carried into absurdity When we see the skulls of oxen adorning a heathen temple we acknowledge their propriety But it is rather unnatural to introduce them in a christian church where sacrifice would be an offence  We are fettered also too much by orders and proportions The ancients themselves paid no such close attention to them Our modern code was collected by average calculations from their works by Sansovino particularly and  Palladio But if these modern legislators of the art had been obliged to produce precedents they could not have found any two buildings among the remains of ancient Rome which were exactly of the same proportions  I would not by any means wish to shake off the wholsome restraint of those laws of art which have been made rules because they were first reasons All I mean is to apologize for Vanburgh For tho it may be difficult to please in any other form of architecture than what we see in daily use yet in an art which has not nature for it's model the mind recoils with dis∣dain at the idea of an  exclusive  system The Greeks did not imagine that when they had invented a good thing the faculty was exhaust∣ed and incapable of producing another Where should we have admired at this day the beauty of the Ionic order if after the Doric had been invented it had been considered as the  ne plus ultra  of art and every deviation from it's proportions reprobated as barbarous innovations Vanburgh's attempt therefore seems to have been an effort of genius and if we can keep the imagination apart from the five orders we must allow that he has created a  magnificent whole  which is invested with an air  of grandeur seldom seen in a more regular style of building It's very defects except a few that are too glaring to be overlooked give it an appearance of something beyond com∣mon and as it is surrounded with great ob∣jects the eye is struck with the  whole  and takes the  parts  upon trust What made Van∣burgh ridiculous was his applying to small houses a style of architecture which could not possibly succeed but in a large one In a small house where the grandeur of a  whole  cannot be attempted the eye is at leisure to contemplate  parts  and meets with frequent occasion of dis∣gust  This immense pile stands in the middle of an extensive park The situation is in general flat A lawn proportioned to the house spreads in front and at the distance of about half a mile meets an abrupt valley which winds across the park The sides of this valley are shagged with wellgrown wood At the bot∣tom ran once a penurious stream over which directly opposite to the castle is thrown a magnificent bridge consisting of a single arch intended chiefly to make an easy communication between the two sides of the valley  About half a mile beyond this arch is reared a triumphal column which tho much criticized I own gives me no offence but rather seems to carry on the idea of grandeur The top is crowned with the statue of the duke of Marl∣borough and the pedestal is inscribednot indeed with the tersness of a Roman altarbut with the less classical tho more honourable de∣tail of an act of parliament granting the manor of Woodstock to the duke for his eminent ser∣vices  All this scenery before the castle is now newmodelled by the late ingenious Mr Brown who has given a specimen of his art in a no∣bler style than he has commonly displayed His works are generally pleasing but here they are great  About a mile below the house he has thrown across the valley a massy head which forms the rivulet into a noble lake divided by the bridge which now appears properly with all the grandeur of accompaniments into two very extensive pieces of water Brown himself used to say  that the Thames would never forgive him what he had done at Blenheim  And every spectator must allow that on entering the great gate from Woodstock the whole of this  scenery the castle the lawn the woods and the lake seen together makes one of the grand∣est bursts which art perhaps ever displayed  The scenery  below  the bridge is the most beautiful part The water here takes the form of a bay running up into a wooded country and several light skiffs at anchor impress the idea The bay appears totally landlocked and the ground falls easily into it in every part  Behind the house the improved grounds consist in Mr Brown's usual style of a  belt  as it is called incircling a portion of the park In this part grandeur gives way to beauty ex∣cept where the walk traverses the side of the bay Here the great idea is still extended and the banks of the Wye scarce exhibit more roman∣tic scenes than are here displayed in the level plains of Oxfordshire The walk carried us along the side of one woody precipice severed from another by an expanse of water which no English river could furnish  Of this situation every advantage is taken which could add variety to grandeur In one part the opposite woody shore is seen alone spreading before the eye in a vast profusion of woody scenery In another part it appears ac∣companied with the lake and sometimes it is  only received in catches through the woods of the foreground which are generally composed of lofty oak  In the midst of these great ideas the scene was not improved by several little patches of flowers and flowering shrubs artificially disposed and introduced which shewed the hand of art to have been straying where the imagination would wish to be ingrossed by the grand exhibition of simplicity and nature  "where if art  "E'er dared to tread 'twas with unsandal'd feet  "Printless as if the place were holy ground"  But when we saw these scenes the work was new Time has now probably blended all these littlenesses into an harmonious mixture with the grander parts The merest shrub may be a com∣panion to the oak without offence The offence arises only from the artificial disposition  In the house our curiosity was chiefly confined to the picturesthose of Reubens especially whose works are here in greater excellence and profusion than in any collection in England Many days would be insufficient to examine them fully We had time only to mark their general effect  Reubens's family  by himself consisting of three figures as large as the life is a laboured piece and yet full of spirit The composition colour∣ing and harmony of the whole are excellent I should not scruple my suffrage in ranking this as the first familypicture in England The chast simplicity of the  Cornaro family  In NorthumberlandHouse by Titian  perhaps might be excepted I have examined with great attention the famous familypicture at Wilton In that celebrated work the  parts  are fine some of them extraordinarily so but the  whole  is illmanaged Here the eye is not in∣grossed by any  particular  but is filled and sa∣tisfied with the  whole  and yet may range with pleasure over the  parts  The  Silenus  also is a finished piece and a very noble effort of Rubens's genius when let loose among ideal beings in which it delighted  The  Holyfamily  seems either to be damaged or to have wanted Reubens's last hand It is flat and possesses little of the master's fire except in the old woman's head  The  Andromeda  by Rubens is a very fine figure  Lot leaving Sodom is a noble work also by the same master In the colouring of this pic∣ture there is a peculiar glow In composition it is less happy  SECT III  FROM Woodstock we proceeded to Chapelhouse in our way to Warwick  Our first stage was barren of beauty Lord Shrewsbury's on the right which appears to stand at the end of an extensive plantation and has much the air of a nobleman's mansion continues long in view and is almost the only object that engages the eye But the unifor∣mity of the woods at a distance is displeas∣ing  From Chapelhouse the road leads through a hilly unpleasant country The hills are neither cloathed with wood nor varied with broken groundbut are mere heavy lumps of earth and the whole a barren prospect I mean  barren  only in a picturesque light for it affords good pasturage and is covered with  herds of cattle and a beautiful breed of sheep with silken fleeces and without horns  And yet among these hills the vallies are sometimes pleasing Long Compton consist∣ing of a number of thatched cottages winds pleasantly along the bottom of one of them and the situation of Mr Sheldon's at Weston∣park seems agreeable  As we enter Warwickshire near Shipston upon Stour the hills diminish into rising grounds and a bleak country changes into a woody one The soil changes also from a deep clay into a gravelly red loam sprinkled with beautiful pebbles The road leads generally through pleasant lanes leaving on the right the village of Keinton and Edgehill where the unfortunate Charles first tried his success in arms  As we approach Warwick the country becomes so flat that the towers of the castle make little appearance at a distance  Warwick contains many beautiful objects The church is an elegant Gothic structure A considerable part of it was lately burnt but it is rebuilt with great symmetry  Connected with the church is a curious chapel decorated in the richest Gothic taste It is the repository of many of the chiefs of the house of Warwick Among them lies under a splendid monument the celebrated Dudley earl of Leicester  The Sessionshouse and the Townhouse are both elegant buildings especially the for∣mer  The Priory situated rather without the town is capable of being made a pleasing scene Little of the old structure remains and what is left is converted into a dwellinghouse It stands more elevated than monastic buildings usually did the ground falling from it tho gently in almost every direction It's pre∣cincts contain about six or seven acres circum∣scribed  by a skreen of lofty wood Beyond this the towers of Warwick castle and other objects are under commandWe can only however admire the beauty of the objects and the little advantage that hath been taken of them  But the great ornament of Warwick is the  castle  This place celebrated once for it's strength and now for its beauty stands on a gentle rise in the midst of a country not absolutely flat The river Avon washes the rock from which it's walls rise perpendicularly You see it's grand foundation to most ad∣vantage from the windows of the great hall from which you look down a considerable height upon the river  This noble castle having appeared in the different capacities first of a fortress and after∣wards of a countyjail was at last converted by it's proprietor the earl of Warwick into a habitable mansion The old form is still pre∣served at least it may be every where traced and each addition is in symmetry with what is left  The old entrance is still in use A bridge is thrown over the ditch and leads into the  inner area of the castle through a grand tur∣rited gate This gate is placed in the middle of a curtain at the extremities of which stand two round towers known by the names of Guy's and Caesar's  On entering this venerable gate and survey∣ing from it's inner arch the area or court of the castle which contains about an acre you see the groundplot and plan of the whole fortressOn the left is the habitable part In front rises a woody mount probably artifi∣cial where formerly stood the citadel part of which still remains The area itself is covered with turf and surrounded by a broad gravel walk as a coachring and the whole is incom∣passed by a wall adorned with the ruins of towers and other mural projections which being shattered in many places and covered with ivy catch little breaks of light and often make a picturesque appearance  The house is grand and convenient the rooms spacious and comfortable Some of the offices particularly the kitchen are hewn out of the solid rock on which the castle is founded  The garden consists only of a few acres and is laid out by Brown in a close walk which winds towards the river and somewhat awk∣wardly  reverts into itself taking no notice except in one single point of the noble pile it invests  The armour and tilting spear of the cele∣brated Guy earl of Warwick a rib of the dun cow and other monuments of the prowess of that hero are shewn at the porter's lodge These remains tho fictitious no doubt are not improper appendages of the place and give the imagination a kind of tinge which throws an agreeable romantic colour on all the vestiges of this venerable pile  From Warwick we proposed to take a view of Kenelworthcastle which lies between it and Coventry The country is flat and woody  Kenelworthcastle is one of the most magni∣ficent piles of ruin in England In the days of it's prosperity we find it often taking a military part but in it's ruins we see little of a military air It's light and ornamental members in general mark it rather as a peaceful mansion  This castle is mentioned in history I believe as early as the reign of Henry I It was then private property But it's owner taking an un∣successful part in a civil war it fell into the  hands of the crown in which it continued till the time of Elizabeth who gave it to her favourite the earl of Leicester This noble∣man profuse and magnificent to the last de∣gree is said to have expended sixty thousand pounds on this single pile a sum enormous in those days Here he resided almost in regal state  After the civil wars of Charles the first the pride of this noble mansion was humbled It's owner was a favourer of the royal cause and Cromwell in revenge tore it in pieces and set every thing to auction that could be severed from the walls These rapacious hands left it in a state from which it never recovered yet even still it is a splendid ruin  From it's situation it borrows little The eminence it stands on is too gentle to command an extensive view and the country in it's neighbourhood is too barren of objects to fur∣nish a rich one  The plan of the castle is very magnificent The area or walledcourt consists of seven acres one third of which is occupied by the ruin But of all this superb pile nothing re∣mains intire The form of no chamber can well be traced except perhaps that of the great  banquetinghall which made a principal part of that range of building which formed the centre of the pile Among other fragments stand the ruins of two massy square dissimilar towers known by the names of Caesar's and Leicester's These seem to have resisted the shocks of time longer than any of the other parts but they have at length given way One side of Leicester's tower having fallen in has laid open the whole internal structure  Yet magnificent as these ruins are they are not picturesque Neither the towers nor any other part nor the whole together unless well aided by perspective and the introduction of trees to hide disgusting parts would furnish a good  picture  tho the variety of shattered stair∣cases fractured segments of vaulted roofs and pieces of ornamented windows afford excellent  studies  for a painter  This grand mass of ruin is now making hasty strides to a total dissolution Another century will probably bring it all to the groundun∣less it's noble owner  Lord Hyde  reach out a hand to save it The stone of which it is constructed is  brown beautiful to the eye but of a friable nature The touch of time crumbling it im∣perceptibly away  "in solemn silence sheds  "The venerable ruin to the dust"  Yet not always in  solemn silence  About seven years ago a large fragment of Leicester's tower fell down at midnight and alarmed the neigh∣bourhood far and wide with it's noise And last winter an abutment of the banqueting hall fell in and crushed a number of farming uten∣sils which were deposited under it  Such is the present state of a structure which two hundred years ago was second to none in England  Every room says an old author describing it on the spot was spacious and highroofed  within  and every part seemly to the sight by due proportion  without  in the daytime on every side glittering with glass at night transparent by continual brightness of candle fire and torch light  But now in Ossian's plaintive language  It's walls are desolate the grey moss whitens the stone the fox looks out from the win∣dow and rank grass waves round it's head  When we saw these ruins the area which produces a rich verdure was grazed by a herd  of cattle These were a great addition to the scene and reminded us of some of  Berghem  's best pictures in which cattle and ruins adorn each other  The ground on the outside of the castle was formerly floated tho it is now entirely drained The lake spread round the southern western and northern sides extending on the whole through the space of two miles Beyond it lay the park On the north side was the garden hanging on the bank between the castlewall and the water It contained only an acre and was joined to the park by a bridge  The left arm of the pool northward says the author I have just quoted has my Lord adorned with a beautiful bracelet of a fairtimbered bridge fourteen feet wide and six hundred feet long railed on both sides and strongly planted  The garden was laid out as we may easily suppose according to the taste of that day terrace above terrace in every mode of expensive deformity But the lake seems to have had some elegance Indeed water sweeping round in the shape in which this is described  must  be beautiful in some degree It's surface could not like land be injured by art the extremities of  it would be generally hid and it would be con∣tinually unfolding itself round the magnificent object which it encompassed tho it is proba∣ble it's banks were as trim and neat as the spade and the line could make them  One of the most memorable particulars of the history of this castle is an entertainment which was given here by the earl of Leicester to queen Elizabeth The tradition of this grand festivity still lives in the country and we have hardly any thing equal to it on record An ac∣count of it was published by one Langham a person then in office about the court and pre∣sent at the time I have already quoted from this work and shall add a part of the account he gives of her majesty's  reception  from which an idea may be conceived of the gallantry of the whole entertainment  On the th of July in the evening the queen approaching the first gate of the castle the porter  a man tall of person and stern of countenance with a club and keys  ac∣costed her majesty in a  rough speech full of passion in metre aptly made for the purpose  and demanded the cause of all this  din and  noise and riding about within the charge of his office  But upon seeing the queen as if he had been struck instantaneously and  pierced at the presence of a personage so evidently expressing heroical sovereignty he falls down on his knees humbly prays pardon for his ignorance yields up his club and keys and proclaims open gates and free passage to all  Immediately the trumpeters who stood on the wall  being six in number each an eight foot high with their silvery trumpets of a five foot long sounded up a tune of welcome  These  armonious blasters maintained their de∣lectable music  while the queen rode through the tiltyard to the grand entrance of the castle which was washed by the lake  Here as she passed a moveable island ap∣proached in which sat inthroned  the Lady of the lake  who accosted her majesty  in well penned metre  with an account of the antiquity of the castle and of her own sovereignty over those waters since the days of king Arthur  but that hearing her majesty was passing that way she came in humble wise to offer up the same and all her power into her majesty's hands  This pageant was closed with a delectable har∣mony of hautbois shalms cornets and such other  loud music which held on while her majesty plea∣santly so passed into the castlegate  Here she was presented with a new scene Several of the heathen gods had brought their gifts before her which were piled up or hung in elegant order on both sides of the entrance wildfowl and dead game from Sylvanus god of the woods baskets of fruit from Pomona sheaves of various kinds of corn from Ceres a pyramid adorned with clusters of grapes  gracified with their vineleaves  from Bacchus and or∣namented at the bottom with elegant vases and goblets fish of all sorts disposed in baskets were presented by Neptune arms by Mars and musical instruments by Apollo An inscrip∣tion over the gate explained the whole  Her majesty having graciously accepted these gifts was received into the gates with a con∣cert of flutes and other soft music and alight∣ing from her palfrey which she always rode single she was conveyed into her chamber and her arrival was announced through the country by a peal of cannon from the ramparts and a display of fireworks at night  Here the queen was entertained nineteen days and it is recorded that the entertainment cost the earl a thousand pounds a day each of  which was diversified with masks interludes hunting music and a variety of other amuse∣ments The queen's genius seems to have been greatly consulted in the pomp and solemnity of the whole Perhaps too it was consulted when the classical purity of these amusements relaxed and gave way as we find it sometimes did to boxing bearbaiting and the buffoon∣ery of the times  Among other compliments paid to the queen in this gallant festival the great clock which was fixed in Caesar's tower was stopped du∣ring her majesty's continuance in the castle that while the country enjoyed that great bles∣sing time might stand still  SECT IV  FROM Kenelworthcastle we proceeded to Coventry The intervening country is flat  The tower of Coventry church is a beauti∣ful object but constructed of the same kind of mouldering stone which we took notice of in the ruins of Kenelworth and which indeed is better adapted to a decayed than to a compleat pile The ornamental parts of this tower are just in that state which one would wish in a ruin they possess a sort of rich mutilation every part is in some degree defaced and yet the whole so perfect as to leave room for the imagination to put all together In a  ruin  this is enough but where the parts are  intire  we require the ornaments to be so too  As we leave Coventry we find a red gra∣velly clay covering a brown rock which bursting here and there from the soil often makes a picturesque foreground The lanes are close and the country woody  Between Coventry and Birmingham lies lord Aylsford's an ancient seat but now under the hands of improvement The house is rebuild∣ing and the grounds are taking a new form under the taste of Mr Brown who seems to be doing all that a situation with but few ad∣vantages will allow The house stands in the midst of a scene rather flat A rill running near it is changed into a river An elegant approach is conducted over it by a handsome bridge and a  belt  winding about two miles is the circumference of the pleasure ground but the country affords few objects to inrich either a foreground or a distance  The rest of the road to Birmingham leads at first through an open country which after∣wards  becomes woody and close and more plea∣sant as we approach the town  The buildings which you see scattered about the landscape near Birmingham are in great profusion and generally of a reddish hue For the country is populous and the houses are built of a kind of brick which has a peculiar red castThis tint predominating in a country as it does here is very unpleasing  Near Birmingham we went to see Bolton's hardware manufactory It is a town under a single roof containing about seven hundred work people But notwithstanding it is a scene of industry utility and ingenuity it is difficult to keep the eye in humour among so many fri∣volous arts and check it's looking with con∣tempt on an hundred men employed in making a snuffbox  From Birmingham we left the great road and passed through a pleasant country to the Leasowes and Hagley which lie within a few miles of each other In our way we had a sweet ride through an oakwood at Smithwick  Few places had raised our expectations more than the Leasowes So great a lover of nature as Mr Shenstone appears to be in his writings could not possibly one would imagine deviate from her in any of the operations of his genius I shall give the reader a slight sketch of the scene and then make a few general observa∣tions  We entered the grounds which contain about an hundred acres by a wicket near the bottom of a lane which leads to the house We should have been carried first into the higher parts where we might have had a view of the whole at once We should then have seen that it is what is properly called an  adorned farm  and should have taken that idea along with us The fields lie about the house and a walk leads you round them  We entered however below the house and were carried first into a narrow woody valley from which emerging we had a pleasant open∣ing into the country about Hale'sOwen  From this view we dip into a woody bottom where we find Melibeus's seat a sequestered  spot proper for the noontide retreat of a shepherd and his flock  From hence we penetrate another wood and come suddenly on a long succession of waterfalls fourteen of them seen through an irregular vista of trees The scenery is whimsical but amusing  Having thus traversed the lower grounds the path leads into the higher and we begin now to discover that it is carrying us round the whole Here we have distant views bound∣ed by the Wrekin in Shropshire  From these grounds the path makes a sudden dip to a sequestered vale where Mr Shenstone has dedicated an urn to the memory of a be∣loved lady From hence it rises again in a troublesome zigzag into the  Lover's walk  which terminates oddly enough in the  temple of Pan  With more propriety it might have led to the  temple of Hymen  From hence we descend again through hang∣ing fields quite unadorned to the most finished scene of the whole It is a grove ornamented at the upper end by a cascade from which the stream plays in irregular meanders among the trees and passing under a romantic bridge forms itself into a small lake This  whimsical  spot is dedicated I think with some impropriety to Virgil's genius and is one of those ambigu∣ous passages which we are at a loss whether to blame or to commend From hence we pass again into the lane where we at first en∣tered  Tho Mr Shenstone has on the whole shewn great taste and elegance and has diversified his views very much and been particularly happy in that most agreeable mode of design affix∣ing some peculiar character to each scene yet in some things he has perhaps done  too much  and in others  not enough  In the use of water he has been too profuse He collects it only from a few springs which ouze from his swampy grounds It was a  force therefore on nature  to attempt either a  river  or a  lake  A cascade or a purling rill should have satisfied his ambition Besides like the water of all swamps the water of the Leasowes wants brilliancy Frothed by a fall or quick descent the impurities of it are less observed in gentle motion they are striking but in a lake they are offensive It was ridiculous to see Naiads invited by inscriptions to bath their  beauteous limbs in  crystal  pools which stood before the eye impregnated with all the filth which generates from stagnation  He has done  too much  also in adorning his grounds so profusely with urns statues and buildings which are commonly the most ex∣pensive and the least beautiful parts of im∣provement In the  adorned farm  at least they are  improper  decorations  With his  inscriptions  in which many peo∣ple say he has done  too much  also I own I was pleased When inscriptions are wellwrit∣ten and properly adapted as these generally are they raise some leading thought and im∣press the character of the scene in stronger ideas than our own  In other things Mr Shenstone has perhaps done  too little  He might have thrown down more of his hedges or if that had been inconvenient he might at least have concealed his inclosures more in plantations His path on the  higher grounds  is in general too open and his fore∣grounds are often  regular fields  This regula∣rity might have been  disguised  The  distances  too would have appeared to more advantage if they had been seen sometimes  over  a wood and  sometimes  through  an opening in one or occa∣sionally through interstices among the boles of the trees  But Mr Shenstone's great deficiency lay in not draining and cleaning his grounds If he had made his verdure richer tho at the expence of his buildings he had shewn a purer taste But Shenstone was poor and with a little of that vanity which often attends poverty he chose rather to lay out his money on what made the most shew than on what would have been most becoming From what he has done how∣ever it is easy to conceive what he could have done if he had had a country suited to his ideas and a fortune sufficient to adorn it  I cannot leave these scenes without remark∣ing the peculiar beauty of his rocks and cas∣cades  Of all manufacturers those of rocks are commonly the most bungling How often are we carried in the improvements even of peo∣ple of taste to see a piece of rockscenery con∣sisting perhaps of half a dozen large stones They neither give us any idea of what they are intended to represent nor are they probably suited to the country in which they are intro∣duced In our attempts to improve if we do  more than just adorn what nature has done by planting and giving a little play to the ground we err To aim at changing the  cha∣racter  of a country is absurd Where nature discourages it is vain to attempt She  scorns controul she will not bear  One beauty foreign to the spot or soil  She gives thee to adorn 'tis thine alone  To mend not change her features  Mr Shenstone however has succeeded the best in his rock scenery because he has done the least He pretends only just to fret his streams and break his cascades and it would be invi∣dious not to own that his cascades rocks and streams are all as exact copies of nature as we any where find  On leaving Mr Shenstone's a very few miles brought us to Hagley The evening was fine and we saw it in all it's glory Yet we left it disappointed The plan of Hagley if there be any is so confused that it is impossible to describe it There is no coherency of parts One scene is tacked to another and any one might be removed without the least injury to the rest  A work of art be it what it may house picture book or garden however beautiful in it's  underparts  loses half it's value if the  general scope  of it be not obvious to conception Even the wild scene of nature however pleas∣ing in itself is still more pleasing if the eye is able to combine it into a whole  But  obscurity  in the  general plan  is not the only objection we made to Hagley it is  formal  in many of it's  parts  The view at the en∣trance is particularly unpleasing consisting of a lawn rising  from  the house closed at the upper end with a regular semicircle of wood and adorned in the middle by an obelisk  Many of these scenes also are  minute  and  trifling  The perspective view at the Palla∣dian bridge and the reverse from the rotunda are below criticism Such also is the stream conveyed in a channel little wider than a drill through the extent of a noble lawn Some pains too have been taken to make it gurgle as it runs Mr Shenstone wrought in miniature and tho he rarely trifles diminu∣tive beauties were in part accommodated to his scheme But lord Lyttelton wrought on a larger scale his ideas should have inlarged with it His pencil should have scorned the  little touches of trifling exactness and he should have considered that his piece both consisted of nobler objects and was to be seen at a greater distance  Added to these defects there is a want also of  variety  The sides of the hills are all planted and the vallies are all lawns Through a succession of these recesses you are carried From one lawn you enter another with little variation of the idea The same thought is repeated over and over  Cingentibus ultima sylvis  Purus ab aboribus spectabilis undique campus  It would however be invidious not to con∣fess that some of these lawns considered as independent parts are very beautiful  Thompson  's seat exhibits a noble display of scenery You look across a spacious valley of a mile in extent the whole a pasture wind∣ing at both ends from the eye The opposite bank which conducts the sweep is hung with wood At one end of the valley is a distant view into the country terminated by the Malvern hills At the other the woody bank is adorned by a modern ruin which stands well but is an object too minute for  the scene One large round tower with an underpart or two would have had a better effect at a distance than such a quantity of wall and other trifling parts which have been con∣trived to answer some purpose of utility whereas the only character such a ruin has to support is that of being the  distant ornament of a scene  with which it's utility if it have any should coincide If it doth not answer this end the cowhouse or the keeper's lodge or whatever it is should occupy some less distin∣guished station  Here  it only shews us that there should have been something which we do not find  On the whole tho there are certainly many very beautiful views in these extensive gardens yet we may easily conceive the same variety of ground the same profusion of wood and the same advantages of water tho in this point the deficiency is greatest might have been so combined as to produce a much nobler whole  It may be added however that only the common round of the garden has been here criticized The rides in the park are very extensive and as they are less dressed they may perhaps be more beautiful The temple  of Theseus stands very happily is a handsome object and has as grand an effect as any thing of the kind can have  The house is a good modern pile but wants a dignity of situation suitable to the capital of such extensive dominions  SECT V  FROM lord Lyttelton's we proposed to visit Mr Anson's near Wolsleybridge Our rout led through Stourbridge Wolver∣hampton and Penkridge The country is rich and woody but affords little that is picturesque In many parts it is much disfigured by a new canal which cuts it in pieces  One of the most beautiful objects in nature is a noble river winding through a country and discovering it's mazy course sometimes halfconcealed by it's woody banks and sometimes displaying it's ample folds through the open vale  It's opposite in every respect is one of these  cuts  as they are called It's lineal and angu∣lar courseit's relinquishing the declivities of the country and passing over hill and dale sometimes banked up on one side and some∣times on bothit's sharp parrallel edges naked  and unadornedall contribute to place it in the strongest contrast with the river An object may be disgusting in itself but it is still more so when it reminds you by some distant re∣semblance of something beautiful  At Penkridge we left the great road and de∣viated to the right over a wild heath to Shuck∣borough the seat of Mr Anson  Mr Anson's improvements are nobly con∣ceived making their object the whole face of a country It is a pity so generous a design had not been directed by a better taste His build∣ings are all on Grecian and Roman models and some of them very beautiful But they want accompaniments There is something rather absurd in adorning a plain field with a triumphal arch or with the lanthern of De∣mosthenes restored to all it's splendor A po∣lished jewel set in lead is ridiculous But above all the temple of the winds seated in a pool instead of being placed on a hill is illstationed As it is some time however since we saw the scenes of Shuckborough they may now be greatly altered and improved The  temple of the winds I fear must ever stand as it does  The house contains little worth notice It is furnished in a frippery sort of Chinese manner There are few pictures of value The hall is adorned with the naval atchievements of lord Anson by Scot in which the genius of the painter has been regulated by the articles of war The  line of battle  is a miserable arrange∣ment on canvas and it is an act of inhumanity in an admiral to injoin it If the line of battle must be introduced it should be formed at a distance and the stress laid on some of the ships at one end of the line brought into action near the eye  The drawingroom is hung with large ruins in  distemper  by Dahl They are touched with spirit but the composition wants simplicity There is a rawness also and want of force in  distemper  tho it certainly gives a more pleasing surface for the eye to rest on than oilpainting which cannot be divested of the delusive lights of varnish  The windows of the room in which these pictures hang look towards a pile of artificial  ruins in the park But Mr Anson has been less happy in fabricating fictitious ruins than in restoring such as are real  If a ruin be intended to take a station merely in some distant inaccessible place one or two points of view are all that need be provided for The construction therefore of such a ruin is a matter of less nicety It is a ruin in a picture  But if it be presented on a spot as this is where the spectator may walk round it and survey it on every sideperhaps enter itthe construction of it becomes then a matter of great difficulty  This difficulty arises first from the necessity of constructing it on as regular and uniform a plan as if it had been a real edifice Not only the situation and general form of the castle or the abbey should be observed but the several parts should at least be so traced out that an eye skilled in such edifices may easily investi∣gate the parts which are lost from the parts which remain There should always be the  disjecta membra  So that in constructing a ruin no part should be presented which the eye does not easily conceive must necessarily have been there if the whole had been compleat  Nor is the expence which attends the con∣struction of such a ruin a trifling difficulty The picturesque ruin must have no vulgarity of shape it must convey the idea of grandeur And no ruins that I know except those of a castle or an abbey are suited to this purpose and both these are works of great expence  But you say  a part  only need be introduced It is true But if your scene be ample and you would introduce it in no other the part you introduce must be ample also A paltry ruin is of no value A grand one is a work of magnificence A gardentemple or a Palla∣dian bridge may easily be effected but such a portion of ruin as will give  any idea  of a castle or an abbey that is worth displaying requires an expence equal to that of the mansion you in∣habit  There is great art and difficulty also in  exe∣cuting  a building of this kind It is not every man who can build a house that can execute a ruin To give the stone it's mouldering ap∣pearance to make the widening chink run naturally through all the jointsto mutilate the ornamentsto peel the facing from the in∣ternal structureto shew how correspondent parts have once united tho now the chasm  runs wide between themand to scatter heaps of ruin around with negligence and ease are great efforts of art much too delicate for the hand of a common workman and what we very rarely see performed  Besides after all that art can bestow you must put your ruin at last into the hands of na∣ture to adorn and perfect it If the mosses and lychens grow unkindly on your wallsif the streaming weatherstains have produced no variety of tintsif the ivy refuses to mantle over your buttress or to creep among the ornaments of your Gothic windowif the ash cannot be brought to hang from the cleft or long spiry grass to wave over the shattered battlement your ruin will be still incompleteyou may as well write over the gate Built in the year Deception there can be none The characters of age are wanting It is time alone which meliorates the ruin which gives it perfect beauty and brings it if I may so speak to a state of nature  On laying all these difficulties together we see how arduous a matter it is to construct such a ruin as is to be seen  on the spot  When it is well done we allow that nothing can be more beautiful but we see every where so many absurd attempts of this kind that when  we walk through a piece of improved ground and hear of being carried next to  see the ruins  if the master of the scene be with us we dread the incounter  From Mr Anson's we continued our rout to Stone by Wolsleybridge through the same kind of rich pleasant country and from thence in our way to Newcastle we proposed to take a view of lord Gower's But a shower of rain prevented us As far however as we could judge from a hasty glance the grounds about Trentham are laid out with great simplicity and elegance The situation of the house is low Before it lies an extensive lawn halfincircled with rising grounds along which the planta∣tions sweep in one great varied line  From Newcastle we took our rout to Man∣chester In our road we wished for time to have visited the potteries of Mr Wedgwood where the elegant arts of old Etruria are revived It would have been pleasing to see all these works in their progress to perfection but it was of less moment as the forms of all his Tuscan vases were familiar to us  One great principle in the construction of a Tuscan vase relates to the mode of setting on the handle It always rises from the vessel with which it is united and of which it makes a part The strength and beauty of the vessel depends so much on this principle that one would wonder how it should ever be overlook∣ed and indeed I have sometimes observed it in the construction of some of our coarser jars for the sake probably of the strength which it adds to the handle But in general it is totally neglected and the handles of our modern vessels whether of clay or of metal tho some of them very costly instead of  making a part  of the vessels themselves are awkwardly  fixed  to them  At Talkonthehill the views are extensive and beautiful on both sides the ground is well disposed and the landscape woody  As we descended the knolls and little de∣pressions of the country which seen from the higher grounds were flat and undistinguished  became now hills and vallies adding new modes of variety  We soon however left all this landscape be∣hind and entered an unpleasant country But after we had passed Holm'schapel and a dreary common beyond it a beautiful scene opened in which we continued many miles The road often led through groves of oak and often through lanes imbowered with lofty trees which were beautiful in their natural simplicity beyond the improvement of art  The duke of Bridgewater's works near Man∣chester are very great We admire equally the grandeur of the conception and the skill of the execution In a painter's eye indeed we have just seen that works of this kind are of little value  From Worsleymills we took a barge to Manchester but found little amusement in our voyage except that of exchanging a rough jolting motion over rugged pavements with that of gliding gently along the surface of a smooth canal  We were struck with one appearance indeed of a singular kind that of Chapmoss which stretching on the right along the space of thirty miles held the eye in suspence through the shades of twilight whether it were land or water It's colour spoke it one it's surface the other  From Manchester around which the country is not unpleasant we pursued our rout to Preston and Lancaster Great part of the road to Bol∣ton is beautiful The views about Ringley where a considerable stream forces it's way between steep woody banks are very pictu∣resque They were the more pleasing as we came upon them by accident having been obliged to leave the great road which some late floods had made impassable by carrying away a bridge  From Bolton we ascended a heighth of four miles over a sort of cultivated mountain The country that lay stretched beneath on the left was softened without any intervening grounds into a blue distance When we descended the  heights and entered it it wore a pleasing va∣riegated form It was woody too and adorned with little rills every where working along the vallies  Between Charly and Preston there is like∣wise much high ground which let us down like the heights of Bolton into a pleasant scene rich flat and woody  As we approached Preston the retrospect of Waltonchurch over the windings of the Rib∣ble is very beautiful  From Preston to Garstang the country is un∣pleasant The ground is varied but it is de∣ficient in wood and has not dignity to support itself without it  Here first the mountains begin to rise and give us a prospect of the country before us But they yet assume no formidable features Tinged with light azure they only skirted the  horizon and at a great distance accompanied us in a lengthened chain on the left  As we approach Garstang the castle tho ruined into a mere block and without beauty becomes an object where there is no other  From Garstang to Lancaster there is little change in the landscape It still continues bleak and unpleasant But as we now approach∣ed the mountains every object began to pro∣claim the rugged scenes into which we were entering The country we now traversed may be called a kind of connecting thread itself of an uncharacterized species striking us with no determined features It has neither the gran∣deur of the mountain scene nor the chearful∣ness of the sylvan what wood there is is poor and shrivelled For we now skirted the bay of Cartmel and the seaair having caught the trees had impoverished their foliage stinted their growth and destroyed their very form with unusual rigour  At a mile's distance Lancastercastle rises to view It's lofty situation it's massy towers and extensive buildings for it is connected with the church give an air of grandeur to it's ap∣pearance but as the parts are neither well shaped nor well combined it is but an indif∣ferent object from any point On the spot the most beautiful part is a noble front which with it's other grand appendages afford suffi∣cient matter for the curiosity of an antiquarian  On the other side of the town the river Lune which is a noble piece of water when the tide is full sufficiently adorns the landscape  But here the Lune is a busy noisy scene banked with quays covered with shipping and resounding with nautic clamour Far otherwise is it's passage a few miles above through the vale of Londsdale where quietly and unobserved it winds around projecting rocksforms circling boundaries to meadows pastured with cattleor passes through groves and thickets which in fabulous times might have been the haunt of woodgods In one part taking a sudden turn it circles a little delicious spot forming it into a peninsula  called vulgarly  the wheel of Lune  Here once dwelt an ancient hermit where his eyes saw nothing nor wished to see any thing except the sweet vale in which he lived  From the castlehill or rather from the churchyard we had a very extensive view composed of the grandest objects Along the meadows below the river Lune now an estu∣ary and adorned with a variety of coasting vessels lessening to the eye through it's seve∣ral reaches hastens to the sea In a mile or two it enters the bay of Cartmel which filled with the tide presents a noble extent of water ten or twelve miles across bounded by the mountains of Furness which extend through vast space and then circling the head of the bay form many a shooting promontory and many a winding shore  This extension of wild country we looked at with regret knowing the many noble scenes it contained which we had not time to visit We were obliged to rest satisfied with forming imaginary pictures among the blue mists of the mountains Our guide an unlettered swain pointed out in the broad dialect of his country the several spotswhere the ruins of Furnessabbey lay sequestered in a lowly valewhere far  to the west Peelcastle running boldly out into the water commanded the entrance of the baywhere deep beneath those purplish moun∣tains the lake of Coniston occupied a valley six miles in lengthwhere Holkerhall and Bard∣sey and Conished founded on the site of an ancient priory and many other places of re∣nowned situation were all surrounded with scenes of grandeur and each as far as we could judge from our intelligence with scenes peculiar to itself  From Lancaster in our rout to Kendal the country every step becomes more character∣istic High shelving grounds arise on the right and on the left at every opening we have different views of the bay of Cartmel and of the mountains of Furness The foreground is every where adorned with large detached stones which indicate the rocks we approach  A little beyond Burton we left the great road▪ and took a circuit of two or three miles to see the country about Milthorp and Levens  Cartmelbay branches here into a creek on the eastern side of which lies Milthorp a little coastingporttown and near it Dalhamtower in a pleasant park defended by a hill from the seaair All around we have beautiful views consisting of woody foregrounds and of dis∣tances composed of different parts of this little estuary and it's appendant mountains  As we proceeded higher up the creek the views increased in beauty About Levens a seat of the earl of Suffolk there is a happy com∣bination of every thing that is  lovely  and  great  in landscape It stands at the head of the creek upon the Kenet a wild romantic stream which rushes into the tide a little below The house incompassed with hilly grounds is well screened from the pernicious effects of the seaair But we did not ride up to it The woods with which it abounds we were told grow luxuriantly and the views at hand are as pleasing as those at a distance are great which consist of a lengthened beach of sand along the creek and of Whitbarrowcragg a rough and very pictu∣resque promontory with other high lands shooting into the bay  Among the beautiful objects of distance we consider a winding sandbeach especially when seen from a woody foreground It's hue amid the verdure of foliage is a pleasant chas∣tising tint When the tide flows the sands change their appearance and take the still more pleasing form of a noble lake  Levens is at present in a neglected state but is certainly capable of being made equal to al∣most any scene in England  From hence we proceeded to Kendal situated in a wild unpleasant country which contains no striking objects and cannot be formed into any of those pleasing combinations which con∣stitute a picture Here and there a view may be found though but seldom The castle which is a mere ruin is in some situations especially near the bridge a good object  Between Kendal and Ambleside the wood increases in grandeur but the scenery is still undetermined The whole is a sort of confused greatness  As we descend to the left we approach Windermere where a different species of coun∣try succeeds The wild mountains which were so illmassed and of a kind so unaccom∣modating to landscape are left behind and the road dips into a lovely sylvan scene leading interchangeably through close groves under wooded hills and along the banks of the lake  SECT VI  WE had now arrived on the confines of those romantic scenes which were the principal inducement to this tour Here therefore we proposed to make some pause and pay a little more attention to the country than a hasty passage through it would allow  But to render a description of these scenes more intelligible and to shew more distinctly the sources of that kind of beauty with which they abound it may be proper before we examine the scenes themselves to take a sort of analytical view of the materials which com∣pose them  mountainslakesbroken grounds woodrockscascadesvallies  and  rivers  With regard to  mountains  it may be first premised that in a picturesque view we con∣sider them only as  distant  objects their enor∣mous  size disqualifying them for objects at hand In the removed part of a picture there∣fore the mountain properly appears where it's immensity reduced by distance can be taken in by the eye and it's monstrous fea∣tures losing their deformity assume a softness which naturally belongs not to them  I would not however be understood to mean that a mountain is proper only to close an  ex∣tended  view It may take it's station in a second or third distance with equal propriety And even on a foreground a rugged corner of it's base may be introduced tho it's upper regions aspire far beyond the limits of any picture  Having thus premised the  station  which a mountain properly occupies in landscape we shall now examine the  mountain  itself in which four things particularly strike usit's  line  the  objects  which adorn it's surfaceit's  tints  and it's  light  and  shade  The beauty of a distant mountain in a great measure depends on the line it traces along  the sky which is generally of a lighter hue The pyramidal shape and easy flow of an irregular line will be found in the mountain as in other delineations the truest source of beauty  Mountains therefore rising in regular ma∣thematical lines or in whimsical grotesque shapes are displeasing Thus  Burnswark  a mountain on the southern border of Scotland  ThorpCloud  near Dovedale in Derbyshire especially when seen from the garden at Ilam and a mountain in Cumberland which from it's peculiar appearance in some situations takes the name of  Saddleback  all form disagreeable lines And thus many of the pointed summits of the  Alps  are objects rather of singularity than of beauty Such forms also as suggest the idea of lumpish  heaviness  are disgusting round swelling forms without any break to disincumber them of their weight  Indeed a continuity of line without a break whether it be  concave straight  or  convex  will always displease because it wants variety unless indeed it be well contrasted with other forms The effect also of a broken line is bad if the breaks are regular  The sources of  deformity  in the mountainline will easily suggest those of  beauty  If the line swell easily to an apex and yet by irregu∣lar breaks which may be varied in a thousand modes it must be pleasing  And yet  abruptness  itself is sometimes a source of beauty either when it is in contrast with other parts of the line or when rocks or other objects account naturally for it  The same principles on which we seek for beauty in  single  mountains will help us to find it in a  combination  of them Mountains  in composition  are considered as  single  objects and follow the same rules If they break into mathematical or fantastic formsif they join heavily together in lumpish shapesif they fall into each other at rightanglesor if their lines run parrallelin all these cases the com∣bination will be more or less disgusting and a converse of these will of course be agreeable  Having drawn the  lines  which mountains should form let us next fill them up and vary them with tints  The objects which cover the surface of mountains are wood rocks broken ground heath and mosses of various hues  Ovid has very ingeniously given us the furni∣ture of a mountain in the transformation of Atlas  Jam barba comaeque  In sylvas abeunt juga sunt humerique manusque  Quod caput ante fuit summo est in monte cacumen  Ossa lapis fiunt  His hair and beard become trees and other vegetable substance his bones rocks and his head and shoulders summits and promon∣tories But to describe minutely the  parts  of a  distant  object for we are considering a mountain in this light would be to invert the rules of perspective by making that  distinct  which should be  obscure  I shall consider there∣fore all that variety which covers the surface of distant mountains as blended together in one mass and made the stratum of those tints which we often find playing upon them  These tints which are the most beautiful ornaments of the mountain are of all colours but the most prevalent are yellow and purple We can hardly consider  blue  as a mountaintint It is the mere colour of the intervening  airthe hue which naturally invests all distant objects as well as mountains The late Dr Brown author of the Estimate in a descrip∣tion which he printed of the lake of Keswick very justly calls these tints  the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains  They are rarely permanent but seem to be a sort of floating silky colours always in motionalways in harmonyand playing with a thousand changeable varieties into each other They are literally  colours dipped in heaven  The variety of these tints depends on many circumstancesthe season of the yearthe hour of the daya dry or a moist atmosphere The  lines  and  shapes  of mountains features strongly marked are easily caught and retained but these meteorforms this rich fluctuation of airy hues offer such a profusion of variegated splendor that they are continually illuding the eye with breaking into each other and are lost as it endeavours to retain them This airy colouring tho in sunshine it appears most brilliant yet in some degree it is  generally  found in those mountains where it prevails  In the late voyages round the world publish∣ed by Dr Hawksworth we have an account  of the great beauty of the colouring observed on the peak of Teneriffe  It's appearance at sunset says the author was very striking When the sun was below the horizon and the rest of the island appeared of a deep black the mountain still reflected his rays and glowed with a warmth of colouring which no painting can express  The rays of the sun which are the cause of all colour no doubt produce these tints to the eye yet we must believe there is something peculiar in the surfaces of some mountains which dispose them to reflect the rays with such variety of tints On many mountains these appearances are not observable and where the surface is uniform the tint will be so likewise  The effect in question says Mr Lock re∣marking on this passage is very familiar to me I saw it almost every evening in Savoy when the sun shone It is only on the tops of the highest mountains that the effect is perfect Mount Blanc being covered with the purest snow and having no tint of it's own was often of the brightest rosecolour  Having thus given the mountain a line filled it with objects and spread over it a beau∣tiful  assemblage of tints it remains lastly to throw the whole into light and shadeHe who would study light and shade must repair to the mountains There he will see their most magnificent effects  In every object we observe a double effect of illumination that of the  parts  and that of the  whole  In a building the cornices the pilasters and other ornaments  are set off  in the lan∣guage of art with light and shade Over this  partial  effect are spread the  general  masses It is thus in mountains  Homer who had a genius as picturesque as Virgil tho he seems to have known little of  the art of painting  was struck with two things in his views of mountainswith those cavi∣ties and projections which abound upon their surfacesand with what he calls their  sha∣dowing forms  Of the former he takes notice when he speaks of a single mountain of the latter when he speaks of mountains in combi∣nation  Under the first idea he speaks of Mount Olympus which he calls  or  many vallied  Il  Now it is plain that in both these  cases he was pleased with the effect of light and shade In one the  partial  effect is marked in the other the  general  The cavities which he observed and which are seen only from their being the deep recesses of shade together with the rocks and little projections which are visible only from catch∣ing a stronger ray of light contribute to pro∣duce the  partial  effectthat richness and va∣riety on the sides of distant mountains which would otherwise be a display of flat fatiguing surface The objects themselves are formless and indistinct yet by presenting different sur∣faces for the light to rest on the rich and va∣riegated effect here mentioned is produced  The  grand masses  are formed by one moun∣tain's overshadowing anotherby the sun's turning round some promontoryor by the transverse position of mountains in all which cases the shadow falls broad and deepsweeps over all the smaller shades to which it still  Under the second he speaks of that chain of mountains which separate Phthia from the southern parts of Greece      Many  shadowing mountains  intervene Il  gives a deeper tinge and unites the whole in one great effect  It is an agreeable amusement to attend these vast shadows in their slow and solemn march over the mountainsto observe how the morn∣ing sun sheds only a faint catching light upon the summits of the hills through one general mass of hazy shadein a few hours how all this confusion is dissipatedhow the lights and shades begin to break and separate and take their form and breadthhow deep and determined the shadows are at noonhow fu∣gitive and uncertain as the sun declines till it's fires glowing in the west light up a new radiance through the landscape and spread over it instead of sober light and shade all the colours of nature in one bright momentary gleam  It is equally amusing to observe the various shapes which mountains assume through all this variety of illumination rocks knolls and promontories taking new forms appear∣ing and disappearing as the sun veers round  whose radiance like varnish on a picture if I may use a degrading comparison  brings out  a thousand objects unobserved before  To these more permanent effects of illumina∣tion may be added another species which arises from accidentI mean those partial flit∣ting shades which are occasioned by floating clouds These may sometimes produce a good effect but they contribute as often to disturb the repose of a landscape To painters how∣ever they are of great use who are frequently obliged by an untoward subject to take the advantage of every probability to produce an effect  SECT VII  HAVING thus considered the chief cir∣cumstances which occur in  distant moun∣tains  let us now inlarge our view and take in the  lake  which makes the next considerable part of this romantic country  The  fen  the  pool  and the  lake  would pre∣sent very different ideas tho magnitude were out of the question  The  fen  is a plashy inundation formed on a flatwithout depthwithout lineal boundary of ambiguous texturehalf waterand half landa sort of vegetable fluid  The  pool  is a collection of the soakings of some common or the reservoir of the neigh∣bouring ditches which deposit in it's ouzy bed  the soil of the country clay or mud and give a correspondent tinge to the water  In some things the  fen  and the  pool  agree They both take every thing in and let nothing out Each of them is in summer a sink of pu∣trefaction and the receptacle of all those un∣clean misshapen forms in animal life which breed and batten in the impurities of stagnation  Where putrefaction into life ferments  And breathes destructive myriads  Very different is the origin of the  lake  It's magnificent and marble bed formed in the caverns and deep recesses of rocky mountains received originally the pure pellucid waters of some rushing torrent as it came first from the hand of naturearrested it's course till the spacious and splendid bason was filled brim∣full and then discharged the stream unsullied and undiminished through some winding vale to form other lakes or increase the dignity of some imperial river Here no impurities find entrance either of animal or of vegetable life  Non illic canna palustris  Nec steriles ulvae naec acutâ cuspide junci  From the brisk circulation of fluid through these animated bodies of water a great master of nature has nobly styled them  living lakes  Speluncae  Vivique lacus  and indeed nothing which is not really alive deserves the appellation better For besides the vital stream which principally feeds them they receive a thousand little gurgling rills which trickling through a thousand veins give life and spirit to every part  The principal incidents observable in  lakes  are their  line of boundary  their  islands  and the different appearances of the  surface  of the water  The  line of boundary  is very various Some∣times it is boldly broken by a projecting pro∣montorysometimes indebted by a creek sometimes it undulates along an irregular shore and sometimes swells into a winding bay In each of these circumstances it is susceptible of beauty in all it certainly deserves attention for as it is a line of separation between land and water it is of course so conspicuous a boundary that the least harshness in it is discernible I  have known many a good landscape injured by a bad water boundary  This line it may be further observed varies under different circumstances When the eye is placed  upon  the lake the line of boundary is a  circular thread  with little undulation unless when some promontory of more than usual magnitude shoots into the water All smaller irregularities are lost The particular beauty of it under this circumstance consists in the opposition between such a  thread  and the irre∣gular line formed by the summits of the moun∣tains  But when the eye is placed on the higher grounds  above  the level of the lake the line of boundary takes a new form and what ap∣peared to the  levelled  eye a circular thread be∣comes  now  an undulating line projecting and retiring more or less according to the degree of the eye's elevation The circular thread was indebted for it's principal beauty to contrast but this like all other elegant lines has the additional beauty of variety  And yet in  some  cases the  levelled  eye has the advantage of the  elevated  one The line which forms an acute angle from the  higher  situation  may be softened when seen from the water into an easy curve  The  islands  fall next under our view These are either a beauty or a deformity to the lake as they are shaped or stationed  If the island be round or of any other re∣gular form or if the wood upon it be thick and heavy as I have observed some planted with a close grove of Scotch fir it can never be an object of beauty At  hand  it is a heavy lump at a  distance  a murky spot  Again if the island however beautifully shaped or planted be seated in the centre of a round lake in the focus of an oval one or in any other  regular  position the beauty of it is lost at least in some points of view  But when it's lines and shape are both irre∣gularwhen it is ornamented with ancient oak rich in foliage but light and airyand when it takes some irregular situation in the lake then it is an object truly beautifulbeautiful in itself as well as in composition It must how∣ever be added that it would be difficult to place such an object in any situation that would be  equally  pleasing from every stand  The  surface of the lake  offers itself last to ob∣servation The several incidents which arise here are all owing to the sky and the disposi∣tion of the water to receive it's impression  That the sky is the great regulator of the  colour  of the water is known to all artists  Olli caeruleus supra caput astitit imber  Noctem hyememque ferens et  inhorruit unda tenebris  And again  Jamque rubescebat radiis mare  et athere ab alto  Aurora in roseis fulgebat lutea bigis  The effect indeed holds universally as water in all cases exposed to the sky will act as a mirror to it  In the darkness of a brooding storm we have just seen the  whole body  of the water will be dark  inhorruit unda tenebris  In clear and windy weather the  breezy ruffled lake  as Thomson calls it is a shattered mirror It reflects the serenity but reflects it partially The hollow of each wave is com∣monly in shadow the summit is tipped with light The light or shadow therefore prevails according to the position of the waves to the eye  Their lubricity is lost More or less they all flow  cum gurgite flavo  But the lake like Spencer's fountain which sprang from the limpid tears of a nymph  is chast and pure as purest snow  Ne lets her waves with any filth be dyed  Refined thus from every obstruction it is  tremblingly alive  all over the merest trifle a frisking fly a falling leaf almost a sound alarms it  that sound  Which from the mountain previous to the storm  Rolls o'er the muttering earth disturbs the flood  And shakes the forestleaf without a breath  This tremulous shudder is sometimes even still more partial It will run in lengthened parallels and separate the reflections upon the surface which are lost on one side and taken up on the other This is perhaps the most picturesque form which water assumes as it affords the painter an opportunity of throwing in those lengthened lights and shades which give the greatest variety and clearness to water  There is another appearance on the surfaces of lakes which we cannot account for on any principle either of optics or of perspective  eye and at a distance when the summits of the waves agreeably to the rules of perspective appear in  contact  the whole surface in that part will be light  But when the sky is splendid and at the same time calm the water being then a  perfect  mirror will glow all over with correspondent tints unless other reflections from the objects around intervene and form more vivid pic∣tures  Often you will see a spacious bay screened by some projecting promontory in perfect re∣pose while the rest of the lake more pervious to the air is crisped over by a gentle ripple  Sometimes also when the  whole  lake is tran∣quil a gentle perturbation will arise in some distant part from no apparent cause from a breath of air which nothing else can feel and creeping softly on communicate the tremulous shudder with exquisite sensibility over half the surface In this observation I do little more than translate from Ovid  Exhorruit aequoris instar  Quod fremit exiguâ cum summum stringitur aurâ  No pool no riverbay can present this idea in it's utmost purity In them every crystalline particle is set as it were in a socket of mud  When there is no apparent cause in the  sky  the  water  will sometimes appear dappled with large spots of shade It is possible these patches may have connection with the bottom of the lake as naturalists suppose the shining parts of the sea are occasioned by the spawn of fish but it is more probable that in some way they are connected with the sky as they are generally esteemed in the country to be a weathergage The people will often say  It will be no hayday to day the lake is full of shades  I never myself saw this appearance o  I might be able to give a better account of it but I have heard it so often taken notice of that I suppose there is at least some ground for the observation Tho after all I think it probable these shades may be owing only to floating clouds  From this great variety which the surfaces of lakes assume we may draw this conclusion that the painter may take great liberties in point of light and shade in his representation of water It is in many cases under no rule that we are acquainted with or under rules so  lax that the imagination is left very much at large  On the subject of  lakes  I have only farther to add that many bodies of water under this denomination are found upon the  summits  of lofty mountains In this situation they are commonly mere basons or reservoirs and want the pleasing accompaniments which adorn the lower lakes Lakes of this kind are a col∣lection of springs and discharge themselves generally from their elevated stations in cas∣cades  SECT VIII  WE have now made a considerable advance towards a landscape The sky is laid in a mountain fills the offskip and a lake with it's accompaniments takes possession of a nearer distance Nothing but a  foreground  is wanting and for this we have great choice of objects  broken groundtreesrockscascades  and  vallies  In a  distance  the ruling character is  tender∣ness  which on a  foreground  gives way to what the painter calls  force  and  richness Force  arises from a violent opposition of colour light and shade  richness  consists in a variety of parts and glowing tints In some degree  richness  is found in a distance but never united with  force  for in a  distance  tho the  lights  may be strong and the parts varied yet  the shades and tints will ever be faint and tender  In the mean time this opposition on the foreground violent as it is must always be subject to the  ruling masses  of light and shade and colouring which harmonize the whole  The effect of this harmony is  breadth  or  repose  It's opposite is  flutter  and  confusion  It appears therefore that the management of foregrounds is a matter of great nicety In them a very contradiction must be recon∣ciled  breadth  and  repose  which consist in  uniting the parts  must be made to agree with  force  and  richness  which consist in violently  breaking them  And what adds to the diffi∣culty the eye brought thus  on the spot  is hurt by the minutest defect Whereas at a  distance  an irregular dash of the pencil if it be not one thing may be conceived to be another obscurity is there a source of beauty Hence it is that many great masters who can throw a distance into a pleasing confusion and give it the effect of nature have failed in exercising their art on a foreground  Having premised thus much with regard to foregrounds  in general  let us now examine the  foregrounds  which are presented to us in this very picturesque country  Broken grounds  are the first objects of our attention Here they abound in every shape The painter will easily find either some rough knoll whose parts are amplethe sloping corner of a hill perhaps worn by a mountaintorrenta rugged road winding through the chasm of a rifted promontoryor some other part of nature equally grand and picturesque  If he chuse to adorn his foreground with  wood  and who does not he will find it in  some  parts of this country in a tolerable style of greatness But in general the old timber is de∣cayed or cut down and that sort of wood incou∣raged which is the most profitablesuch wood as in a course of time is turned into charcoal It has in some degree the effect of better trees in a distance but it is very deficient when we call for an ancient oak to give the foreground  ground a grandeur equal to the scenewhen we want the magnificence of it's shadowing form to mantle over the vacant corner of a landscapewhen we wish it to hide some heavy promontory or to scatter a few loose branches over some illshaped mountainlinewhen it's massy foliage is necessary to give depth to shade it's twisted bole covered with grey moss to oppose the vivid green in it's neighbourhood or lastly it's warm autumnal tint to contrast the colder hues of distance In all these cases a deficiency of forestwood is sometimes re∣gretted in the scenery before us but not often and where it is the loss is easily supplied by other objects among which rocks are the principal and these when ornamented with wood tho of a smaller size have generally the effect of the most luxuriant foliage  Rocks  differ in  surface general form  and  colour  The  rock naturally  wears that  smooth  weatherbeaten surface which time gives it through a succession of ages But rocks firm as they are are subject to change Springs undermine them torrents wash the earth from around  them frosts loosen them and sometimes they are torn by storms and earthquakes Under these circumstances when large masses fall away the rock exhibits a  fractured  surface which in general has a better effect than the smooth one Nature in these instances may be said to retouch her compositions the frac∣tured parts are larger and sharper and better adapted to receive either smart catching lights or a body of light and shadeAn humble imitation of the surfaces of fractured rocks is sometimes exhibited in large coals they may at least assist the imagination of a painter  With regard to the  general form  of rocks both species the  smooth  and the  fractured  have equal variety Both have their bold pro∣jectionsboth hang alike over their bases are rifted into chasmsand shoot sometimes into horizontal and sometimes into diagonal strata  The  natural colour  of rocks is either  grey  or  red  We have of each kind in England and both are beautiful but the  grey  rock which is the common species in  this  scenery makes the finer contrast with the foliage either of summer or of autumn  I call  red  and  grey  the natural  colours  of rocks but more properly they are the  ground  only of a variety of tints These tints arise from weeds mosses and lychens of various kinds which uniting together on the surface of a rock often make a rich and very harmo∣monious assemblage of colouring and the painter who does not attend to these  minutiae  we are considering  foregrounds  loses half the beauty of his original  Among these lychens the white species is the least pleasing When mixed with other tints it may form an agreeable contrast and even when it borrows no aid of this kind if it be sparingly and happily introduced it may add a beauty to the natural colour of the  grey  rock by giving it the brilliancy of a few sharp touches But when it  prevails  and spreads like a bald leprous scab over a  whole  surface it's mealy hue is very disgusting unless it be thrown into shadow or supported by some mass of foliage or other vivid tint in contact with it  Besides the species of rocks just described there is another called the  cragg  which con∣veys the idea of a rock roughly pounded With these shattered fragments whole sides of  mountains are often covered down which they appear continually to shiver This species is very inferior to the former It wants that breadth of surface which gives dignity to an object In a  distance  indeed which melts the fragments into one mass the effect is good but in the situation in which we are now con∣sidering rocks as the appendages of a  foreground  the  cragg  is meanly circumstanced  The  cascade  which is the next object of our observation may be divided into the  broken  and the  regular  fall  The  first  belongs most properly to the rock whose projecting fragments impeding the wa∣ter break it into piecesdash it into foam and give it all the spirit and agitation which that active element is capable of receiving Happy is the pencil which can seize the varie∣ties and brilliancy of water under this circum∣stance  In the  regular  fall the water meets no ob∣struction but pours down from the higher grounds to the lower in one splendid sheet  Each kind hath it's beauties but in gene∣ral the  broken  fall is more adapted to a small  body of water and the  regular  to a large one The small body of water has nothing to re∣commend it but it's variety and bustle where∣as the large body has a dignity of character to maintain To fritter  it  in pieces would be to destroy in a degree the grandeur of it's effect Were the Niagara thus broken at least if some considerable parts of it were not left broad and sheety it might be a grand scene of confusion but it could not be that vast that uniform and simple object which is most capable of expressing the idea of greatness  As there are few  considerable  rivers in the romantic country we are now examining the most beautiful cascades which are innumera∣ble are generally of the  broken  kind The  regular  falls of which also there are many are objects of little value Tho they are some∣times four or five hundred feet in height yet they appear only like threads of silver at a distance and like mere spouts at hand void both of grandeur and varietyAnd yet in heavy rains some of them must be very noble if we may judge from their channels which often shew great marks of violenceBut I was never fortunate enough to see any of them in these moments of wildness  These two kinds of cascades the  broken  and the  regular  may be combined If the weight of water be small it is true it will admit only the  broken  fall but if it be large it may with propriety admit a combination of both and these combinations may be multi∣plied into each other with endless variety  The  regular  fall admits also another mode of variety by forming itself into what may be called the  successive fall  in which the water instead of making one continued shoot falls through a succession of different stories Of this kind are many of the mountaincascades in this country which are often very beautiful especially where the stages are deranged and the water  seeks  it's way from one stage to ano∣ther  This is the species of cascade which was the great object of imitation in all the anti∣quated waterworks of the last age Our forefathers admired the  successive fall  and agree∣ably to their awkward mode of imitation made the water descend a  regular  flight of stonestairs  Before we conclude the subject of cascades it may be observed that as in other objects of beauty so in this proportion must be a  regulating principle I shall not be so precise as to say what is the exact proportion of an elegant cascade Nor is it necessary The  eye  will easily see the enormity of  disproportion  where it exists in any great degree and that is enough Thus when a mountaincascade falls four or five hundred feet and is perhaps scarce two yards broad every eye must see the dis∣proportion as it will also when the whole breadth of some large river falls only two or three feet Both would be more beautiful if their falls held a nearer proportion to their quantities of water  The last species of  foregrounds  are  vallies  Let it be observed that the terms  vale  and  valley  denote universally through this work the greater and smaller scenes of the same kind I consider  valley  as the diminutive of  vale  with regard to which it must be remarked first that  narrow contracted vallies  only are meant The open valley must class itself among objects of  distant  scenery  It must secondly be remarked that even  contracted valleys  are not  purely  of the nature of  foregrounds but  participate  of distance One sidescreen must necessarily be a little  removed  if you would give your scenery the advantage of perspective  These things being premised we may con∣sider the  valley  as a species of  foreground  the ingredients of which Spencer hath given us in very few words  Through woods and mountains wild they came at last  Into a pleasant dale that lowly lay  Betwixt two hills whose high heads over placed  The valley did with cool shade overcast  Through midst thereof a little river rolled  These ingredients admit great variety in compo∣sition The sides of the valley may be high or low rocky or woody smooth or full of jutting promontories and these variations again may play into each other with a thousand interchanges  When we find a concurrence of beautiful circumstances in these sceneswhen their sides are well proportioned and picturesquely adorn∣edand especially when they are so fortunate as to open on a rich distance a lake bounded by a rocky mountain or any other interesting object they form a landscape of a very pleasing kind  The rivers also with which these vallies scarce ever fail of being adorned have the same variety as the hills and may now and then be introduced very happily to assist the foreground They are pure chrystalline streams generally rapidgenerally sparkling over beds of pebblesoften tumbling and foaming over the ledges of rocksand forming through the whole of their course a continuation of little bustling cascades  Nearly allied to the  contracted valley  is what in  this  country is called a  gill  in  others  a  dell  It is a narrow cleft winding between two rocky precipices and overgrown with wood which closes at the top and almost excludes the day Through the bottom foams a torrent You hear it sounding in it's fall from one rocky stage to another but it is rarely visible  These romantic spots are generally imper∣vious When they are a little more open so as to allow a narrow footpath to stray among them they are the most beloved haunts of solitude and meditation and of all the parts  of this delightful scenery afford the most re∣freshing refuge from noontide heat  Such were the scenes the poet panted after when they drew from his soul oppressed by the languor of a summersun that ardent as∣piration  O quis me gelidis in  vallibus  Haemi  Sistat et ingenti ramorum protegat umbrâ  How intimately acquainted with these scenes he was his own very accurate descriptions shew  Densis hunc frondibus atrum  Urget utrimque latus nemoris medioque fragosus  Dat sonitum saxis et torto vertice torrens  Dat sonitum  says this accurate observer of nature remarking in that expression that the torrent was an address to the ear not to the eye  The  contracted valley  we have seen may open to a  distance  but a view into the  gill  furnishes only a  foreground  It can only con∣sist of some little sequestered recessa few twisted bolesa cascade sparkling through the treesor a translucent pool formed in the cavity beneath some rock and just large enough to reflect the hanging wood which over sha∣dows  it And yet even on this contracted scale we have many a beautiful landscape  For nature here  Has with her living colours formed a scene  Which Ruisdael best might rival crystal lakes  O'er which the giantoak himself a grove  Flings his romantic branches and beholds  His reverend image in th' expanse below  If distant hills be wanting yet our eye  Forgets the want and with delighted gaze  Rests on the lovely foreground  SECT IX  WE have now examined the materials of which the magnificent scenery of this country is composedthe  distant mountain  the  lake  and the  foreground  but a few general observations on these materials as  united in composition  may perhaps throw some new and picturesque lights on the whole  In many countries much  grander  scenes are exhibited than thesemountains more mag∣nificent and lakes more extensive yet it is probable there are few in which the several objects are better proportioned and united with more beauty  In America the lakes are seas and the country on their banks being removed of course to a great distance can add no accom∣paniments  Among the  smaller  lakes of Italy and Swit∣zerland no doubt there are many delightful scenes but the  larger  lakes like those of America are disproportioned to their accom∣paniments the water occupies too large a space and throws the scenery too much into distance  The mountains of Sweden Norway and other northern regions are probably rather masses of hideous rudeness than scenes of grandeur and proportion Proportion indeed in all scenery is indispensably necessary and unless the lake and it's correspondent moun∣tains have this just relation to each other they want the first principle of beauty  The value of lakescenery arises rather from the idea of  magnificence  than of  variety  The scene is not continually shifting here as on the banks of a winding river The lake is so vast that it stands still as it were before the moving eye Nor is this attended with satiety A quick succession of imagery is necessary in scenes of less grandeur where little beauties are easily scanned but scenes like these de∣mand contemplation These rich volumes of  nature like the works of established authors will bear a frequent perusal Contemplation adds to their value  In the mean time with all this magnifi∣cence and beauty it cannot be supposed that every scene which these countries present is  correctly picturesque  In such immense bodies of roughhewn matter many irregularities and even many deformities must exist which a practised eye would wish to correct Moun∣tains are sometimes croudedtheir sides are often bare when contrast requires them to be woodedpromontories form the waterboun∣dary into acute anglesand bays are contracted into narrow points instead of swelling into ample basons  In all these cases the imagination is apt to whisper What glorious scenes might here be made if these stubborn materials could yield to the judicious hand of artAnd to say the truth we are sometimes tempted to let the imagination loose among them  By the force of this creative power an intervening hill may be turned aside and a distance introducedThis illshaped moun∣tain  may be pared and formed into a better lineTo that on the opposite side a light∣ness may be given by the addition of a higher summitUpon yon bald declivity which stretches along the lake may be reared a forest of noble oak which thinly scatter'd over the top will thicken as it descends and throw it's vivid reflections on the water in full luxuri∣ance  The line of the water too which perhaps is straight the imagination will easily correct It will bring forward some bold promontory or open some winding bay  It will proceed even to the ornaments of art On some projecting knoll it will rear the majesty of a ruined castle whose ivyed walls seem a part of the very rock on which they stand On a gentle rise opening to the lake and half incircled by woody hills some mouldring abbey may be seated and far beyond may appear distant objects under some circum∣stance of picturesque illumination  The forest  darkening  round and  glittering  spire  Thus the imagination will assist those scenes which tho replete with beauties beyond it's power to create may contain deformities  which it might wish to remove It corrects one part of nature by another and composes a landscape as the artist composed his cele∣brated Venus by selecting accordant beauties from different originals Scarce any  single  archetype is sufficiently correct Any other idea of  improving  nature is absurd and can be adopted only by men of false taste who ima∣gine they  improve  her by an addition of heterogeneous decorations  As to the  improvement  of such  vast scenes  as these it is in every shape except by a little planting beyond all power of art I cannot therefore be understood to suggest improvement here All we get by imagining how such a country as this might be improved is merely a little practice in the rules of picturesque com∣position  We may remark further that the power which the imagination hath over these scenes is not greater than the power which they have over the imagination No tame country however beautiful however adorned can dis∣tend the mind like this awful and majestic scenery The wild sallies of untutored genius  often strike the imagination more than the most correct effusions of cultivated parts Tho the  eye  therefore might take more pleasure in a view considered  merely in a picturesque light  when a little adorned by the hand of art yet I much doubt whether such a view would have that strong effect on the  imagination  as when rough with all it's bold irregularities about it when beauty and deformity grandeur and horror mingled together strike the mind with a thousand opposing ideas and like chymical infusions of an opposite nature produce an effervescence which no harmonious mixtures could produce  Surely there is a hidden power that reigns  'Mid the lone majesty of untamed nature  Controuling sober reason  Were a lover of nature placed  abruptly  in the midst of such scenes as these the effect might be too strong and in this instance as in others he might discover the weakness of his first progenitor in whom on viewing suddenly a grand landscape we are told  So deep the power of those ingredients pierced  Ev'n to the inmost seat of mortal sight  That Adam now inforced to close his eyes  Sank down and all his spirits became in tranced  But nature which brings out the sun through the medium of twilight hath in this case also provided for the weakness of the visual nerve These grand scenes are  gradually  introduced The idea grows imperceptibly to maturity The great stones of yesterday become rocks to∣day Hills in a few stages are converted into mountains and we see now and then the glimpse of a lake before the eye is filled with the whole vast splendid surface of it  If the imagination be thus fired by these romantic scenes even in their  common  state how much more may we suppose it wrought on when they strike us under some  extraordinary  circumstance of beauty or terrorin the tran∣quility of a calm or the agitation of a storm  Some scenes particularly of the sylvan kind are perhaps best suited to a calm They receive their principal beauty from the  richness  of the objects which is improved by chearful and splendid lights  Other scenes less inriched by objects are meagre in a calm and glaring sunshine A  bright hemisphere only renders their poverty more apparent To such scenes a storm which produces sublime ideas by heaving clouds and bursting lights gives an adventitious conse∣quence and leads the eye in it's pursuit of  objects  to the  grandeur of the effect  But there are some scenes in nature which are adapted to both circumstancesnone more than the scenery of lakesnone perhaps so much  During five days which we spent among the lakes we saw one of them only and that but once under the circumstance of a  perfect  calmwhen there was neither wind to ruffle nor cloud to obscure the resplendency of the surfacewhen we saw the poet's description li∣terally translated  Silet arduus aether  Tum zephyri posuere premit placida aequora pontus  If an artificial mirror a few inches long placed opposite to a door or a window occa∣sions often very pleasing reflections how noble must be the appearance when an area of many leagues in circumference is formed into one vast mirror and this mirror surrounded by a combination of great and beautiful objects The majestic repose of so grand so solemn  and splendid a scene raises in the mind a sort of enthusiastic calm which spreads a mild com∣placence over the breasta tranquil pause of mental operation which may be felt but not described  Soothing each gust of passion into peace  All but the swellings of the soften'd heart  That waken not disturb the tranquil mind  When the mind has a little recovered it's tone from the  general  impression of such a scene it feels a new pleasure in examining more minutely the several picturesque ingre∣dients which produced itthe stillness and purity of the airthe strong lights and shades the tints upon the mountainsthe polish of the lakeand above all the reflections dis∣played upon it's bosom when  spread  Into a liquid plain it stands unmoved  Pure as th' expanse of heaven  And to the fringed bank with osiers crowned  It's crystal mirror holds  Other adventitious circumstances of less value in  themselves  but in  union  very pictu∣resque add new life and beauty to so still a scenegroups of cattle in various parts driven by the heats of noon along the shores of the  lakeand fishingboats extending their nets in dotted circles and forming tremulous reflec∣tions from their flaccid sails  When we take a view of such a glorious scene in all it's splendor we regret that it should ever be deformed by the rough blasts of  tempest  and yet I know not whether under this lat∣ter circumstance it may not have a still greater  power over the imagination  Every little idea is lost in the wild uproar and confusion of such a scene  Nor is it in this disturbed state less an  object of picturesque beauty  The sky floating with broken cloudsthe mountains half obscured by driving vapours and mingling with the sky in awful obscuritythe trees straining in the blast and the lake stirred from the bottom and whitening every rocky promontory with it's foam are all objects highly adapted to the pencil  In the midst of the tempest if a bright sunbeam should suddenly break out and in Shake∣spear's language  light up the storm  the scenery of an agitated lake thus assisted by the powers of contrast affects both the  imagination  and  the  eye  in a still greater degree Some broad mountainside catching a mass of light pro∣duces an astonishing effect amidst the leaden gloom which surrounds it Perhaps a sunbeam halfsuffused in vapour darting between two mountains may stretch along the water in a lengthened gleam just as the skiff passes to receive the light upon it's swelling sail while the seagull wheeling along the storm turns it's silvery side strongly illumined against the bosom of some lurid cloud and by that single touch of opposition gives double darkness to the rising tempest  Compared with such scenes how inanimate do the subjects of Canaletti appearhow flat his square canals and formal streetperspective when opposed to spreading lakes and sweeping mountainsthe puny labours of men to the bold irregular scenery of nature Nor can we help regretting the loss of such pictures as might have been produced if Canaletti's free pencil had been thrown loose in such a country as this  But these scenes are not only superior to the subjects of Canaletti but to those of a greater  master the younger Vanderveld Seaviews tho grander in some respects are on the whole inferior to the views before us Their great deficiency is the want of variety in their ac∣companiments One species of them indeed and but one is superior to the utmost efforts of the lakethe segment of some landlocked bay which in a storm especially is a noble subject the waters are more agitated and form bolder swells which of course receive grander effects of light Here too instead of the dancing skiff we are presented with the terrors of shipwreck The beacon also seated on a bleak eminence marks the coast with pe∣culiar danger while the distant porttown discovered by a gleam of light under the sha∣dowing cliff makes the scene still more affect∣ing by the exclusion of hope within sight of security  I have only farther to observe in  general  on the scenes of this romantic country that they are subject to violent convulsions of vari∣ous kinds Every thing here is in the grand style The very elements when they do mis∣chief  keep in unison with it and perform all their operations with an air of dignity  Upon some of the mountains particularly on Crossfell a blast called in the country a  helmwind  will sometimes arise suddenly of a nature so violent that nothing can withstand it's force The experienced mountaineer as he traverses those wild regions foreseeing it's approach throws himself flat upon the ground and lets it pass over him It's rage is momen∣tary and the air instantly settles into it's former calm  These hurricanes are not uncommon in other mountainous countries Mr Misson particu∣larly speaking of the mountains near Inspruck tells us that the winds often force their way through their hollow parts as if through pipes and raise such furious hurricanes as will sometimes root up not only trees but even rocks  The lake too is subject to something of the same kind of emotion which the inhabitants of the country call a  bottomwind  Often  when all is calm and resplendent around as the boat is plying it's steady way the boat∣man will descry at a distance happy that it is so a violent ebullition of the water He will see it heave and swell forced upwards by some internal convulsion and suffering all the agitation of a storm But as soon as the con∣fined air has spent it's force the agitated sur∣face immediately subsides  Of these  bottomwinds  also we meet with frequent accounts particularly in some of the Sweedish lakes which are very subject to them  Something of this kind seems to have given Spencer an idea which he introduces in his  idle lake  The waves come rolling and the billows roar  Outrageously as they engaged were  But not one puff of wind there did appear  Often also a vast body of water collected in the entrails of a mountain it is said will force a way through it's side and rushing down the declivity take it's course through the valley where it is not uncommon to see the marks of it's devastation  The same effects are sometimes produced by  waterspouts  which in countries like these are collected as at sea and fall upon moun∣tains  The  avalanche  or fall of snow is common here too as in other mountainous countries Inundations also are occasioned by it's sudden melting  But the fall of cliffs and large fragments of mountains loosened by rain and frost pro∣duces one of the greatest scenes of terror which belongs to this romantic country and to which we are chiefly indebted for that variety of fractured rock and broken ground which are among it's greatest ornaments Vir∣gil has given us a description of this kind in great perfection  Qualis in Euboico Baiarum litore quondam  Saxea pila cadit  ruinam  Prona trahit penitusque vadis illisa recumbit  Miscent se maria nigrae attolluntur arenae  Tum sonitu Prochyta alta tremit durumque cubile  Inarime Jovis imperiis imposta Typhaeo  The  immediate effect  is first described  Miscent se maria nigrae attolluntur arenae  After a solemn pause the grand ecchoes and distant repetitions lengthened out from the rocky scenery around are nobly introduced  Tum sonitu Prochyta alta tremitdurumque cubile  Inarime Jovis imperiis imposta Typhaeo  Having thus collected a few of those  general ideas  with which the scenery of this country abounds we shall now illustrate them in a tour through some of it's most romantic parts  SECT X  AMBLESIDE is an ordinary village but delightfully seated A cove of lofty mountains half incircles it on the north and the lake of Wynander opens in front near the shores of which it stands  The ground between it and the mountains which are at least two miles distant is various broken and woody A mountaintorrent about half a mile from the village forms a grand cascade but it was so overgrown with thickets that we had no point of view to see it from but the top which is the most unpicturesque we could have  From this fall the stream rushes along a narrow valley or  gill  luxuriantly adorned with rock and wood and winding through it about a mile emerges near the head of the lake into which it enters This  gill  was  so overgrown with wood that it appeared al∣most impervious but if a path could be carried through it and the whole a little opened it might be made very beautiful A scene in itself so pleasing with a noble cascade at one end and an extensive lake at the other could not fail to strike the imagination in the most forcible manner  From Ambleside we set out for Bowness to take a view of the lake Part of the road we had traversed the day before from Ken∣dal and were a second time amused by the woody landscape it afforded and it's sudden interrupted openings to the lake before the whole burst of that magnificent scene was presentedFrom the higher grounds above Bowness we had an elevated view of it's whole extent  Windermere or Winanderwater as it is sometimes called extends from north to south about twelve or fourteen miles In breadth it rarely exceeds two and is seldom narrower than one The southern end winds a little towards the west The northern and west∣tern coasts are wild and mountainousthe eastern and southern are more depressed in  some parts cultivated in others woody Op∣posite to Bowness the lake is divided into two parts by a cluster of islands one of which is larger than the rest  Bowness is the capital porttown on the lake if we may adopt a dignified style which the grandeur of the country naturally suggests It is the great mart for fish and charcoal both which commodities are largely imported here and carried by land into the country It's harbour is crouded with vessels of various kinds some of which are used merely as pleasureboats in navigating the lakeIn one of these we embarked and standing out to sea made for the great island which we were informed was a very interesting scene  We soon arrived at it and landing at the south end we ordered our boat to meet us at the north point meaning to traverse it's little boundaries  A more sequestered spot cannot easily be conceived Nothing can be more excluded from the noise and interruption of life or abound with a greater variety of those cir∣cumstances which make retirement pleasing  The whole island contains about thirty acres It's form is oblong it's shores irregular retiring into bays and broken into creeks  The surface too is uneven and a sort of little Appennine ridge runs through the middle of it falling down in all shapes into the water Like it's great motherisland the southern part wears a smoother aspect than the northern which is broken and rocky  Formerly the whole island was one entire grove At present it is rather bare of wood tho there are some large oaks upon it  One of it's greatest beauties arises from that irregular little Appennine just mentioned which extends from one end to the other This circumstance hides it's  insularity  by con∣necting it with the continent In every part except on the high grounds you stand in an amphitheatre composed of the noblest ob∣jects and the lake performing the office of a sunk fence the grandeur of each part of the continent is called in by turns to aid the insignificance of the island  The oblong form also of the lake gives the island another great advantage On both it's  sides  the opposite shores of the continent are little more than half a mile distant but at the northern and southern  points  there is a large sheet of water The views therefore as you walk round are continually changing  through all the varieties of  distance  which are still farther improved by a little degree of obliquity in the position of the island  He who should take upon him to ornament such a scene as this would have only to con∣duct his walk and plantations so as to take advantage of the grand parts of the continent around himto hide what is offensiveand amidst a choice of great and picturesque scenes to avoid shewing too much As he would have at all times an exuberance of water he should not be ostentatious in dis∣playing it It would be a relief to the eye sometimes to exclude it wholly and to in∣troduce a mere sylvan scene with distant mountains rising above it A transient glance of the water with some wellchosen objects beyond it would often also have a good effect and sometimes a grand expansion of the whole Thus the objects around tho unmanage∣able in themselves might be brought under command by the assistance of an insular situ∣ation  With regard to the  ornamenting  of such a scene an elegant  neatness  is all the improver  should aim at Amidst these grand objects of nature it would be absurd to catch the eye with the  affected  decorations of art The simple idea he would desire to preserve is what the place itself suggests a sequestered retreat The  boundaries  should in a great measure be thicketon the eastern coast es∣pecially which is opposed to the only culti∣vated part of the country and if there be any thing in that part worth giving to the eye it might be given through some  unaffected  opening  For thickets the wild wood of the coun∣try would abundantly suffice It grows luxu∣riantly and would soon produce it's effect  The middle parts of the island with a few clumps properly disposed might be neat pasturage with flocks and herds which would contrast agreeably with the rough scenery around  The house at present stands too formally in the middle of the island It might stand better near the southern promontory The air of this sweet retreat is said to be very pure  Since this view of Windermere island was taken it hath been under the hands of improvement The proprietor I have been told spent six thousand pounds upon it with which sum he has contrived to do almost every thing that one would wish had been left undone It is now in other hands which may probably restore it's beauty  This island belonged formerly to the Philip∣sons a family of note in Westmoreland Du∣ring the civil wars two of them an elder and a younger brother served the king The former who was the proprietor of it com∣manded a regiment the latter was a major  The major whose name was Robert was a man of great spirit and enterprize and for his many seats of personal bravery had ob∣tained among the Oliverians of those parts the appellation of  Robin the Devil  After the war subsided Col Briggs a steady friend to the usurpation residing at Kendal under the double character of a lead∣ing magistrate for he was a justice of the peace and an active commander held the country in awe This person having heard that Major Philipson was at his brother's house on the island in Windermere resolved if possible to seize and punish a man who  had made himself so particularly obnoxious With this view he mustered a party which he thought sufficient and went himself on the enterprize How it was conducted my au∣thority  Dr Bourn's hist of Westmoreland  does not inform uswhether he got together the navigation of the lake and blockaded the place by sea or whether he landed and carried on his approaches in form Neither do we learn the strength of the gar∣rison within nor of the works without tho every gentleman's house was at that time in some degree a fortress All we learn is that Major Philipson endured a seige of eight or ten days with great gallantry till his bro∣ther the colonel hearing of his distress raised a party and relieved him  It was now the major's turn to make re∣prizals He put himself therefore at the head of a little troop of horse and rode to Kendal where Col Briggs resided Here being in∣formed that the colonel was at prayers for it was on a sunday morning he stationed his men properly in the avenues and himself armed rode directly into the church It is  said he intended to seize the colonel and carry him off but as this seems to have been totally impracticable it is rather probable that his intention was to kill him on the spot and in the midst of the confusion to escape Whatever his intention was it was frustrated for Briggs happened to be elsewhere  The congregation as might be expected was thrown into great confusion on seeing an armed man on horseback enter the church and the major taking the advantage of their astonishment turned his horse round and rode quietly out But having given an alarm he was presently assaulted as he left the church and being seized his girths were cut and he was unhorsed  At this instant his party made a furious attack on the assailants and the major kill∣ing with his own hand the man who had seized him clapped the saddle ungirthed as it was upon his horse and vaulting into it rode full speed through the streets of Kendal calling to his men to follow him and with his whole party made a safe retreat to his asylum in the lakeThe action marked the man Many knew him and they who did not knew as well from the exploit that it  could be nobody but  Robin the Devil  Such are the calamities of civil war After the direful effects of public opposition cease revenge and private malice long keep alive the animosity of individuals  SECT XI  HAVING thus taken a view of a place abounding with so many beauties we found our bark waiting for us at the northern point and setting sail instead of returning to Bowness we stood for Ambleside We could have wished to navigate the whole lake but it was too great an undertaking for mea∣sured time and we contented ourselves with going in quest of the beauties of it's northern division  As we left the island the scene opening on every side we found ourselves surrounded with objects of great magnificence  On the western coast ran a continuous range of craggy mountains thinly scattered over with trees which had formerly overspread it It is a part of Furnessfell the whole of which  we had before seen in one vast combination of distant mountains bounding our view over the bay of Cartmel The part we now saw stretches about two leagues along the lake  On the eastern side we passed several small islands some of which were wellwooded others were mere rocks with low twisted trees bursting from their crevices all of them pro∣bably worth visiting if our time had allowed Through the openings of these islands we had partial views of the eastern coast till having advanced further through this little archipelago into the body of the lake the whole eastern skreen opened to the eyeThis side tho less magnificent than the mountains of Furness on the left contains however more variety It is broken into hills some of which are culti∣vated and others covered with wood  But on the whole neither of these sidescreens is an object purely  picturesque  The western shore is great indeed but it is an unvaried mass of heavy greatness The eastern is broken too much and wants both unity and grandeur When we rode through it in the morning it made an admirable  foreground  in almost every part but we now found it less qualified as a  distance  The sidescreens however are the least es∣sential parts of this vast scene The front is the capital partthat part on which the eye immediately settles It consists of that im∣mense body of barrier mountains which sepa∣rate the two counties of Cumberland and West∣moreland appearing in this view to be drawn up in a sort of tumultuary array mountain beyond mountain as far as the eye could reach  As we advanced in our voyage this great division of the lake from the islands to it's northern point tho really oblong assumed the form of a vast circular bason and the rough mountains arising round it appeared from so splended an area with new grandeur Indeed contrast gave an additional force to the character of each  This great scene however surveyed thus from a centre was rather amusing than pic∣turesque It was too extensive for the painter's use A small portion of the circle reduced to paper or canvas could have conveyed no idea and a large segment would have exceeded all the powers of the pallet  It is certainly an error in landscapepainting to comprehend too much It turns a picture into a map Nothing is more delusive than to suppose that every view which pleases in nature will please in painting In nature the pleasure arises from the eye's roaming from one passage to another and making it's re∣marks on each In painting as the eye is there confined within certain limits it arises from seeing some select spot adorned agreeably to the rules of art And the painter who wishes to make a pleasing composition must not include more than he can thus adorn His foreground and his distance must bear a proportion to each other which cannot be the case if he include a vast compass For as he can only take in a  certain  quantity of foreground the removed parts of his picture should bear a proper proportion to it Wellmanaged exceptions may be found yet still in general the rule is good  But altho the whole of the amphitheatre we are now surveying was in it's full dimensions no subject for a picture yet it exhibited many parts which as distances were purely pictu∣resque and afforded an admirable collection of mountain studies for a painter I speak  particularly of the front skreen in which the lines of the mountains were beautiful and variousthe intersections also of those lines the promontories with the deep shades they projectedand above all the mountain colour∣ing which was the most splendid we had ever seen Airy tints of vivid yellow green and purple we could prismatically separate Bright spots of effulgence also appeared which could not well be denominated of any colour Yet all tho displayed in such rich profusion were blended with such nice harmony and tem∣pered so modestly by the grey mistiness of distance that gorgeous as these hues were there was not a single colour that glared or was out of place  For who can paint  Like nature Can imagination boast  Amidst it's gay creation hues like her's  Or can it mix them with that matchless skill  And lose them in each other  We had now made a considerable progress in our voyage The sidescreen on the left kept still the same distance but the mountains in front as we approached them began now to separate into near and distant grounds  and the rocks and woods which in the painter's language  adhered  before now  broke away  in a variety of projections tho still o'erspread with soft colouring and tender sha∣dow  As we approached nearer this softness of colouring took a more vivid hue and the pro∣montories and rocks continued still projecting to the eye with new force of shade while the mountains which ranged behind began more and more to retire The length of the lake tho it affected the nearer grounds made no change in the distant mountains so that the comparative distance between the foreground and them was now much greater than it had been  An appearance of this kind is beautifully described by Virgil When Aeneas came in sight of Italy he first saw a hazy appearance of hills and low land  procul obscuros colles humilemque videmus  Italiam  On a nearer approach he discovered the temple of Minerva which being seated on  high ground seemed as if it stood on a pro∣montory hanging over the sea  Templum apparet in arce Minervae  But as he came close in with the land the rocks took their proper form and the temple retreated to a distance  Gemino demittunt brachia muro  Turriti scopuli refugitque a litore templum  As we approached the end of the lake the promontories and rocks assumed new height and almost hid the mountains which continued to retire beyond them while the form of the nearer grounds began also to vary The water which a little before seemed in contact with the rocks appeared now to wash a meadow beyond which the rocks formed a first distance  The scenery put us in mind of Berghem who often chose a meadow with a rock behind it to relieve his cattle His rock is generally left plain and simple almost with∣out a single varying tint a mere mass of tender shadow while the cattle are touched with infinite force and spirit We saw the picture realized Berghem's imagination could not  have formed a better background nor a more beautiful group Such combinations are plea∣sing in life in painting and in poetry  On the grassy bank  Some ruminating lie while others stand  Half in the flood and often bending sip  The circling surface In the middle rears  The strong laborious ox his honest front  Which incomposed he shakes and from his side  The troublous insects lashes with his tail  Returning still Amid his subjects safe  Slumbers the monarchswain his careless arm  Thrown round his head on downy moss reclined  Here lay his scrip with wholsome viands filled  There listening every noise his faithful dog  Through the meadow at the bottom of the rocky ground two rivers the Bratha and the Rotha wind their way and uniting be∣fore they meet the lake enter it with a full but quiet stream and furnish it with large supplies  The Rotha takes it's rise from mountains about twelve miles distant and forms the two lakes of Grasmer and Rydal before it enter Windermere  The Bratha rises from the pike of Langdale in a mountainous and rocky country and  after a turbulent course buries at length all it's inquietude in the peaceful waters of the lake where it's name is no more remembred  Our boatmen having conveyed us a con∣siderable way up these united streams landed us on the meadows within half a mile of Ambleside  Before we leave this grand expanse of water I cannot forbear remarking a few circum∣stances that relate to it  In the first place we admired it's extraordinary brightness It is all over  nitidis argenteus undis  The eye can see distinctly in smooth water through a medium of at least a dozen yards and view the inhabitants of it's deep recesses as they play in shoals and  sporting with quick glance  Shew to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold  How far the transparency of water is an addition to  a scene  I cannot take upon me to say Most of the lakes in Scotland which I saw are of a mossytinctured hue and yet had their full effect in landscapeAs a  de∣tached object  however the transparent lake is  incomparably the most beautiful I should suppose also that the more brilliant the water is the more brilliant are the reflections  Among the great variety of fish which inhabit the extensive waters of this lake the  char  is the most remarkable It is near twice the size of a herring It's back is of an olivegreen it's belly of a light vermilion soften∣ing in some parts into white and changing into a deep red at the insertion of the fins  A parcel of char just caught and thrown together into the luggagepool of a boat makes a pleasant harmony of colouring The green olivetint prevails to which a spirit is here and there given by a light blush of vermilion and by a strong touch of red if a fin happen to appear These pleasing colours are assisted by the bright silvery lights which play over the whole for nothing reflects light more beautifully than the scales of fish  Char are caught only in the winterseason when twenty dozen in a day are sometimes taken by a single boat In summer they re∣tire to the rocky caves below some of which are said to be unfathomable nor do they breed  in any lake in which such deep recesses are not found  The charfishing is a very profitable branch of trade to the proprietors of the lake The whole area of it is divided into five districts An invisible line crosses the surface from crag to craga limit which the fisherman cor∣rectly knows But tho the space of each fishery is nearly equal yet the produce is otherwise the fish running in shoals sometimes in one part of the lake and sometimes in anotherWhen the farmer rents land he can judge of his bargain by the surface When he rents water he must take his chance  But fish are not the only inhabitants of this lake Innumerable flights of waterfowl fre∣quent it's extensive plain The naturalist may declare their names and classes the painter has only to remark the variety of forms in which they appearsometimes sitting in black groups upon the water rising and sinking with the waves at other times in the air circling the lake in figured files or with he∣sitating wing seizing some station on it's banks or surfaceWith regard to these minute ap∣pendages  of landscape let me only suggest that birds should never be introduced upon the wing near the eye Quick motion of any kind  represented  is an absurdity and the longer you look the more absurd it becomes But at a little  distance  the motion of a bird appears so slow that the eye will  endure  a degree of improbability in the representation of it  I have only to add that this magnificent piece of water suffers little change in  appear∣ance  from seasons but preserves the dignity of it's character under all circumstances sel∣dom depressed and as seldom raised above it's ordinary levelEven in the most violent rains when the country is drenched in water when every rill is swelled into a river and the mountains pour down floods through new channels the lake maintains the same equal temper and tho it may spread a few yards over it's lowest shores which is the utmost it does yet it's increase is seldom the object of observation nor does the severity of the greatest drought make any considerable altera∣tion in it's bounds Once it is recorded  it rose seven feet in perpendicular height It's boundaries would then certainly  appear  in∣larged but this was a very uncommon case  But if it be not raised by rains it is often greatly agitated by winds Of all the lakes of this country none lies so exposed through the whole length of it to sudden squalls as this nor does any piece of fresh water in the whole island perhaps emulate the grandeur of a disturbed ocean so much It is of course navigated with great caution whenever there is a tendency to stormy weather Many acci∣dents have shewn the necessity of this caution but one made such an impression on the country as a century cannot efface Several people in the neighbourhood of Bowness having been attending a fair at Hawkshed a town on the other side of the lake had embarked in the evening on their return home But before this little voyage could be performed so vio∣lent a storm arose that their boats foundered and no fewer than fortyseven persons perished  This account is taken from Dr Bourn's hist of West∣moreland It is probable these people might all have perished together in the ferry boat    SECT XII  FROM Ambleside we proposed to set out for Keswick being obliged for want of time to leave one scene behind us which we wished much to visitthat of Furnessabbey But the loss was in a great measure made up and our curiosity satisfied by the accounts and drawings of Mr John Smith  This artist has had a principal hand in etching the drawings which accompany these observations  an ingenious young painter who had been studying the ruins on the spot  Furnessabbey lies about twenty miles from Ambleside beyond those mountains which range on the western side of Windermere It is situated in a beautiful valley in the midst  of a wide open cultivated country which rises every where in large swells but is no where diversified by any objects of picturesque beauty In so inanimate a scene we are sur∣prized to find a valley of so different a struc∣ture adorned with rock and wood through which winds a rapid stream  At the entrance of this scene stands the village of Dalton from whence the valley winding about four miles in one large sweep∣ing narrow curve opens on a rich view of Cartmelbay  About a mile within the valley in the widest part stands the abbey It seems to have been constructed in a good style of Gothic architecture and has suffered from the hand of time only such depredations as picturesque beauty requires The  intire plan  of the abbeychurch and a large  fragment  of it still re∣main The tower in the centre which seems never to have been lofty is perforated with large arches At the end of the western aile stand the ruins of a low simple tower where the bells of the abbey are supposed to have hung and from the south aile projects a building which is called the chapterhouse The cloysters are continued in the same di∣rection  one wall of which and all the in∣ternal structure are gone At the end of the cloysters arises a very rich and picturesque fragment which is called the  school  Round the whole runs an irregular wall which crossing the valley in two places and mounting it's sides makes a circuit of about two miles In many parts it is hid with trees or shrubs in some parts where it is discovered it is beautiful and in very few disgusting  In this wall are two gates one to the north and the other to the west which seem to have been the only outlets of the place That to the north has been the great entrance the other has more the appearance of a postern with a porter's lodge  The proprietor of this noble scene is lord George Cavendish who is a faithful guardian of it and I am informed takes care to pre∣vent any further depredations  From Ambleside we set out for Keswick which is about eighteen miles farther north  We were now about to enter the middle and most formidable part of that vast chain  of mountains which I have before men∣tioned as the barrier between Cumberland and Westmoreland and which promised from a distant view to present us with a great variety of very grand scenery Our morning's voyage on the smooth expanse of the lake aided our present expedition with all the powers of contrast  But before we enter these majestic scenes it may be necessary to premise a distinction between a  scene of mountains  and a  mountain scene  Mountainous countries most commonly pre∣sent only the former The objects are grand but they are huddled together confused with∣out connection and the painter considers them only as  studies  and forms them into pictures by  imaginary combinations  We sometimes however see a mountainous country in which nature itself hath made these beautiful combinationswhere one part relates to another and the effect of a whole is produced This is what I call a  mountain scene  Of this latter kind is almost the whole road between Ambleside and Keswick The mountains are  naturally  combined into scenes which if not in all parts purely picturesque are in all parts marked with the great lines of composition tho often on too wide a scale for imitation  The first object of our attention on leaving Ambleside was Rydalhall the seat of Sir Michael le Fleming It stands on a rising lawn On the north and east it is sheltered by lofty mountains In front towards the south it commands a noble distance consist∣ing of the extensive vale of Windermere bound∣ed by the lake The mountain on the north called Rydalcragg rising close behind the house is high and rocky That on the east is of inferior size but is covered with wood Between these mountains runs a narrow wood∣ed valley through which a considerable stream falling down a quick descent along a rocky channel forms a succession of cascades  One of these tho but a miniature is so beautiful both in itself and in it's accompani∣ments as to deserve particular noticeIt is  seen from a summerhouse before which it's rocky cheeks circling on each side form a little area appearing through the window like a picture in a frame The water falls within a few yards of the eye which being rather above it's level has a long perspective view of the stream as it hurries from the higher grounds tumbling in various little breaks through it's rocky channel darkened with thicket till it arrive at the edge of the precipice before the window from whence it rushes into the bason which is formed by nature in the native rock The dark colour of the stone taking still a deeper tinge from the wood which hangs over it sets off to wonderful advantage the sparkling lustre of the stream and produces an uncommon effect of light It is this effect indeed from which the chief beauty of the scene arises In every representation truly picturesque the shade should greatly overbalance the light The face of nature under the glow of noon has rarely this beautiful appearance The artist therefore generally courts her charms in a morning or an evening hour when the sha∣dows are deep and extended and when the sloping sunbeam affords rather a catching  than a glaring light In this little exhibition we had an admirable idea of the magical effect of light picturesquely distributed  On leaving Rydal we entered a vast chasm between two mountains which may properly be called a portal to the scenes we approached  On passing it we were presented with a grand  scene of mountains  adorned by a lake called Rydalwater on the left not indeed adequate to the greatness of the surrounding objects but of such beauty as immediately to fix the eye In the midst of it is a rocky island covered with wood The little river Rotha winding round a promontory enters it on the north  Leaving these scenes we ascended a very steep hill from the summit of which was displayed a prospect of desolation in a very dignified form It was an amphitheatre of craggy mountains which appeared to sweep round a circumference of at least thirty miles tho in fact perhaps it did not include half that space But great objects naturally form a  wide scale of mensurationThe soul involun∣tarily shuddered at the first aspect of such a sceneAt the distant part of it lay Grasmerlake which being so far removed from the eye seemed only a bright spot at the bottom of the mountains  To this lake the road directly led A nearer approach presented us with some beautiful views on it's banks tho on the whole it's principal merit consisted in refreshing the eye with a smooth expanse of water in the midst of such a variety of rough mountainscenery As we skirted it's limits it seemed larger than that of Rydal and tho it appeared like a spot at a distance became now the principal feature of this vast vale  From hence the road led us into another amphitheatre wild and immense like the former but varied greatly in the shapes of the mountains which were here more broken and irregular shooting in many places into craggy summits and broken points  And yet even these wild scenes covered as they are with craggs and scarce furnishing the least tint of vegetation are subject to rights  for which none but the hard inhabitant would think it worth his while to contend You see every where their bare and barren sides marked with partitionwallsstones with∣out morter laid upon each other crossing at right angles and running down steeps and along precipices where the eye can scarce conceive they could have any foundation All these  partitions of desolation  as they may be called have their inhabitants each maintain∣ing a few stunted sheep which picking the meagre tufts of grass which grow under the sheltered sides of craggs and stones earn like their owners a hard subsistence  At the conclusion of this immense amphi∣theatre into which we last entered we found an exit equal to the sceneanother grand mountaingap or portal through which the road carried us up another steep mountain At the top we paused and looking back on the scenes we had left were presented with a view which wholly filled the imagination  It was a  retrospect  of the amphitheatre we had passed but in a style still grander than the prospect of it It was more strongly marked with the great outlines of composi∣tion and was of course more a whole  A wide vale thrown by perspective into a circular form lay before the eye Here also the distant part seemed occupied by the lake of Grasmer but a greyish mist left the idea ambiguous Beyond the lake arose various mountains which bounded it and still beyond these appeared the blue heads of other moun∣tains Those which formed the sidescreens of the vale advancing forward from the distant mountains beyond the lake approached the eye in a grand sweep by the easy gradations of perspective The promontories and re∣cesses of the more removed parts were mark∣ed by a faint shadow till by degrees both the sidescreens growing boldly on the eye were lost behind the two cheeks of the craggy por∣tal which with the road between them formed a foreground equal to the scene The whole view is entirely of the horrid kind Not a tree appeared to add the least chearful∣ness to it  With regard to the adorning of such a scene with figures nothing could suit it better than a group of banditti Of all the scenes I ever saw this was the most adapted to the per∣petration of some dreadful deed The imagi∣nation can hardly avoid conceiving a band of robbers lurking under the shelter of some pro∣jecting  rock and expecting the traveller as he approaches along the valley below  Nothing however of this kind was ever heard of in the country The depredations of foxes are the only depredations to which the cottages in these vallies are exposed Our postilion pointed to a rugged part on the sum∣mit of a rocky mountain on the left which he told us was the great harbour of these animals Here they bred from hence they infested the country and to this inaccessible asylum they retreated in the hour of alarm  After we left the two amphitheatres just described we met with nothing very interest∣ing till we came to the celebrated pass known by the name of  DunmailRaise  which divides the counties of Cumberland and West∣moreland  The history of this rude monument which consists of a monstrous pile of stones heaped on each side of an earthen mound is little known It was probably intended to mark a division not between those two northern counties but rather between the two king∣doms of England and Scotland in elder times when the Scottish border extended  beyond it's present bounds And indeed this chain of mountains seems to be a much more na∣tural division of the two kingdoms in this part than a little river in a champaign country like the Esk which now divides them It is said this division was made by a Saxon prince on the death of Dunmail the last king of Cum∣berland who was here slain in battleBut for whatever purpose this rude pile was fabri∣cated it hath yet suffered little change in it's dimensions and is one of those monuments of antiquity which may be characterized by the scriptural phrase of  remaining to this very day  The entrance  There are three passages over this chain of mountains into Cumberland This by  Ambleside  is the wildest and most picturesque A second by  Brough  over Stainmore is dreary rather than wild and a third by  Shap  is both  into Cumberland presents us with a scene very strongly marked with the sublime grander tho less picturesque than the amphitheatre we had passed It is a vista of mountains pursuing each other if I may so phrase it through an easy descent  of not less than six or seven miles and closed at the distant end by Wyburnlake a consi∣derable piece of water  This scene is great in all it's parts and in it's general composition The mountains of which the sidescreens of this vista are formed fall generally in easy lines and range at the distance of a mile and a half or two miles from each other But it is difficult to ascertain a distance of this kind for as the m  ntain rises  gradually  from it's base we c  not easily fix where it begins It is enough to observe that through the whole immensity of the view before us there appeared no dis∣proportion  Among the mountains which compose this magnificent scene there is one on the right of superior grandeur stretching near a league and a half in one vast concave ridge This mountain is known by the name of  Helvellin  with which three mountains only through this vast region dispute the point of altitude CrossfellGrasmerand Skiddaw The in∣habitants of it's invirons give it universally for Helvellin but I believe it is no where else treated with such respect  Besides the general grandeur of this view there is a wonderful variety in the shapes of the several mountains which compose it Na∣ture's vistas are never formed by rule and compass Whenever she deviates towards a re∣gular shape she does it with that negligent air of greatness which marks sublimity of genius No attention to trifles characterizes her scenes Her very regularities discover those strong touches of contrast that range of imagination which destroys every idea of sameness  Of all the rude scenery we had yet visited none equalled this in  desolation  The whole is one immensity of barrenness The moun∣tains are universally overspread with craggs and stones which are sometimes scattered carelessly over their surfaces and sometimes appear shivering in cascades of crumbling frag∣ments down their sides Helvellin through all it's space is one intire pavement Nor is the view disfigured by the abundance of this more ordinary species of rock  See page  In it's vastness the parts coalesce and become a  wholeThe fractured rock so beautiful in itself is calculated rather for smaller pictures Here it would be lost  These vast regions whose parts are thus absorbed in the immensity of a whole have the strongest effect on the imagination They distend the mind and fix it in a kind of stupor  these lonely regions where retired  From little scenes of art great Nature dwells  In awful solitude  We now approached the lake of Wyburn or Thirlmer as it is sometimes called an object every way suited to the ideas of desola∣tion which surround it No tufted verdure graces it's banks nor hanging woods throw rich reflections on it's surface but every form which it suggests is savage and desolate It is about two miles in length and half as much in breadth surrounded by barren mountains and precipices shelving into it in all direc∣tions  A joyless coast  Around a stormy lake  And to impress still more the characteristic idea of the place the road hanging over it ran along the edge of a precipiceOne pecu∣liar feature also belongs to it About the middle of the lake the shores on each side nearly uniting are joined by an Alpine bridge I did not observe any picturesque beauty ari∣sing from this circumstance but rather a formality at least from the stand where I viewed it A communication however of this kind rather increases the romantic idea  Beyond Wyburnlake we deviated into a mere  scene of mountains  Nature seemed to have aimed at some mode of composition which she had left unfinished but it was difficult to conceive what species of landscape she meant a  valley  or a  woody recess  a  barren scene  or a  cultivated one  There was a mix∣ture of all  This miscellaneous passage however did not continue long It appeared only a short inter∣ruption of the grand vista from which we had deviated at the lake of Wyburn and into which we now returned Nature however seemed to have spent her force in her first  effort which was greatly superior to the second  The thickets among these mountains and indeed many other parts of the country are frequented by the wildcat which Mr Pen∣nant calls the British tyger and says it is the fiercest and most destructive beast we have He speaks of it as being three or four times as large as the common cat We saw one dead which had been hunted on the day we saw it and it seemed very little inferior if at all to the size he mentions  By this time we approached Keswick and from the descent of Castlehill at about two miles distance had an extensive view of the whole country around that celebrated scene of romantic beauty  Before us lay a plain many leagues in circum∣ference divided into two large portions each of which is floated by a lake  Derwentwater  overspreads the nearer and  Bassenthwait  the more distant Surrounding the whole rises a vast circular chain of mountains and tow∣ering  over them all on the eastern side of the isthmus stands the mountain of Skiddaw We had heard too much of this mountain to meet it properly it has none of those bold projections and shaggy majesty about it which we expected to have seen in this king of mountains It is a tame inanimate object except at such a distance as smooths the imbossed work of all these rich fabrics and where it's double top makes it a distinguished object to mark and characterize a scene But if the mountain disappointed us the scene over which it presided went beyond our imagination  This rich extensive view was aided when we saw it by all the powers or more pro∣perly the resplendency of light and shade The morning had been fine but in the after∣noon the clouds began to gather threatening rain A heavy sky overspread the higher and middle regions of the air with all the so∣lemnity of gloom dropping it's dark mantle to the skirts of the horizon Just as we arrived at the brow of the hill with the scenery of the two lakes and their accompani∣ments before us the setting sun burst forth in a glow of splendor  If a  common  sunset often gives a beautiful appearance even to an  ordinary  landscape what must have been the effect of an  uncommon  one on  such  a landscape as thisa sunset not merely a  flood of splendor  but contrasted by the fullest depth of shade Here we had the beauties of the little summerhouse scene on the most extensive scale The effect was astonishing The whole was a scene of glory but a scene of glory painted by the hand of nature Tho every part glowed with tran∣scendent lustre the whole was in nicest har∣mony But it was a transitory vision While we gazed it faded and in a few moments nothing was left but the great outlinesthe grand composition of the scene We should have stood over it even thus in rapture if we had not just seen what a splendid addition it was capable of receiving  We have a grand picture from the pencil of a great master of the close of such an even∣ing  As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds  Ascending while the northwind sleeps o'erspread  Heaven's chearful face the louring element  Scowls o'er the darken'd landscape snow or shower  If chance the radiant sun with farewel sweet  Extend his evening beam the fields revive  The birds their notes renew and bleating herds  Attest their joy that hill and valley ring  But Milton's ideas I think in general are rather musical than picturesque We have the same picture by an inferior master tho a better colourist  Thus all day long the full distended clouds  Indulge their genial stores  Till in the western sky the downward sun  Looks out effulgent from amid the flush  Of broken clouds gay shifting to his beam  The rapid radiance instantaneous strikes  The illumin'd mountain through the forest streams  Glows on the lake and in a yellow mist  Spreads o'er the bright interminable plain  Here we have all the resplendency of light but not a sufficient balance of shade Milton gives the balance in the other scale If Thomson had introduced like Milton  the louring element scowling over his darkened landscape  his resplendent tints would have had their full force and the effect had been com∣plete  Keswick is the first town we meet with on our entrance into Cumberland and tho a place of no consequence is however much  superior to Ambleside Between the two places there is a great resemblance Keswick stands at the northpoint of Derwentwater which is the very point that Ambleside occupies on Windermere But the situation of Ambleside is more romantic as it stands more in the middle of that chain of mountains which separates the two counties At Keswick the roughnesses of the country are wearing off for in a few miles beyond it this great barrier ends  Here we resolved to fix our headquarters for a few days and from thence to visit such of the neighbouring lakes and mountains as had been most recommended to our notice  Keswick Lake  map of Keswick Lake  SECT XIII  ON the th of June we set out on  horse∣back  which I mention as it is the only conveyance the road will admit on an expe∣dition into Borrodale a wild country south∣west of Keswick Our road led along the lake of  Derwent  which was the first object we surveyed  But before we examined the particulars of this grand scene we took a general view of the whole from it's northern shore which is the only part unblockaded by mountains This is the isthmian part which joins the valley of Derwentwater with that of Bassen∣thwait It was easy from the higher grounds of this isthmus to obtain the station we desired  The  lake of Derwent  or  Keswicklake  as it is generally called is contained within a circumference of about ten miles presenting itself in a circular form tho in fact it is rather oblong It's area is interspersed with four or five islands three of which only are of con∣sequence  Lord's island Vicar's island  and  St Herbert's island  but none of them is com∣parable to the island on Windermere in point either of size or beauty  If a painter were desirous of studying the whole circumference of the lake from one station St Herbert's island is the spot he should choose from whence as from a centre he might see it in rotation I have seen a set of drawings taken from this stand which were hung round a circular room and intended to give a general idea of the boundaries of the lake But as no representation could be given of the lake itself the idea was lost and the drawings made but an awkward appearance  Lord's island had it's name from being the place where once stood a pleasurehouse be∣longing to the unfortunate family of Derwentwater which took it's title from this lake The ancient manorhouse stood on Castlehill above Keswick where the antiquarian traces also the vestiges of a Roman fort But an heiress of Derwentwater marrying into the family of the Ratcliffs the familyseat was removed from Keswick to Dilston in Nor∣thumberland  As the boundaries of this lake are more mountainous than those of Windermere they of course afford more  romantic scenery  But tho the whole shore except the spot where we stood is incircled with mountains they rarely fall abruptly into the water which is girt almost round by a margin of meadowon the western shores especially On the eastern the mountains approach nearer the water and in some parts fall perpendicularly into it But as we stood viewing the lake from it's northern shores all these marginal parts were lost and  the mountains tho in fact they describe a circle of twenty miles which is double the circumference of the lake appeared univer∣sally to rise from the water's edge  Along it's western shores on the right they rise smooth and uniform and are therefore rather lumpish The more removed part of this mountainline is elegant but in some parts it is disagreeably broken  On the eastern side the mountains are both grander and more picturesque The line is pleasing and is filled with that variety of objects brokengroundrocksand wood which being well combined take from the heaviness of a mountain and give it an airy lightness  The  front  screen if we may so call a por∣tion of a circular form is more formidable than either of the sides But it's line is less elegant than that of the easternscreen The fall of Lodoar which adorns that part of the lake is an object of no consequence at the distance we now stood But in our intended ride we proposed to take a nearer view of it  Of all the lakes in these romantic regions the lake we are now examining seems to be most generally admired It was once admira∣bly characterized by an ingenious person  The late Mr Avison organist of St Nicolas at Newcastle upon Tyne  who on his first seeing it cryed out  Here is beauty indeedBeauty lying in the lap of Horrour  We do not often find a happier illustration Nothing conveys an idea of  beauty  more strongly than the lake nor of  horrour  than the mountains and the former  lying in the lap  of the latter expresses in a strong man∣ner the mode of their combination The late Dr Brown who was a man of taste and had seen every part of this country singled out the scenery of this lake for it's peculiar beauty  In a letter to Lord Lyttelton quoted above  And unquestionably it is in many places very sweetly romantic particularly along it's eastern and southern shores but to give it  preeminence  may be paying it perhaps as much too high a compliment as it would be too  rigorous to make any but a few comparative objections  In the first place it's form which in ap∣pearance is circular is less interesting I think than the winding sweep of Windermere and some other lakes which losing themselves in vast reaches behind some cape or promontory add to their other beauties the varieties of distance and perspective Some people object to this as touching rather on the character of the river But does that injure it's beauty And yet I believe there are very few rivers which form such reaches as the lake of Win∣dermere  To the formality of it's shores may be added the formality of it's islands They are round regular and similar spots as they appear from most points of view formal in their situation as well as in their shape and of little advan∣tage to the scene The islands of Windermere are in themselves better shaped more varied and uniting together add a beauty and con∣trast to the whole  But among the greatest objections to this lake is the abrupt and broken line in several of the mountains which compose it's screens especially on the western and on part of  the southern shore which is more remarkable than on any of the other lakes We have little of the easy sweep of a mountainline at least the eye is hurt with too many tops of mountains which injure the ideas of sim∣plicity and grandeur Great care therefore should be taken in selecting views of this lake If there is a littleness even amidst the grand ideas of the original what can we expect from representations on paper or canvas I have seen some views of this lake injudiciously chosen or taken on too extensive a scale in which the mountains appear like haycocks I would be understood however to speak chiefly of the appearance which the lines of these mountains  occasionally  make When we change our point of view the mountainline changes also and may be beautiful in one point tho it is displeasing in another  Having thus taken a view of the  whole lake together  from it's northern point we pro∣ceeded on our rout to Borrodale skirting the eastern coast along the edge of the water The grand sidescreen on the left hung over us and we found it as beautifully romantic  and pleasing to the imagination when it's rocks precipices and woods became a foreground as it appeared from the northern point of the lake when we examined it in a more removed point of view  Nor do these rocky shores recommend themselves to us only as foregrounds We found them every where the happiest stations for obtaining the most picturesque views of the lake The inexperienced conductor shewing you the lake carries you to some garish stand where the eye may range far and wide And such a view indeed is well cal∣culated as we have just seen to obtain a general idea of the whole But he who is in quest of the picturesque scenes of the lake must travel along the rough sidescreens that adorn it and catch it's beauties as they arise in smaller portionsit's little bays and winding shoresit's deep recesses and hang∣ing promontoriesit's garnished rock and dis∣tant mountain These are in general the picturesque scenes which it affords  Part of this mountain is known by the name of Lady'srake from a tradition that a young lady of the Derwentwater family in the time of some public disturbance escaped a pursuit  by climbing a precipice which had been thought inaccessibleA romantic place sel∣dom wants a romantic story to adorn it  Detached from this  continent  of precipice if I may so speak stands a rocky hill known by the name of  Castellet  Under the beetling brow of this natural ruin we passed and as we viewed it upwards from it's base it seemed a fabric of such grandeur that alone it was suffi∣cient to give dignity to any scene We were desired to take particular notice of it for a reason which shall afterwards be mentioned  As we proceeded in our rout along the lake the road grew wilder and more roman∣tic There is not an idea more tremendous than that of riding along the edge of a preci∣pice unguarded by any parapet under im∣pending rocks which threaten above while the surges of a flood or the whirlpools of a rapid river terrify below  Many such roads there are in various parts of the world particularly among the moun∣tains of Norway and Sweden where they are  carried along precipices of such frightful height that the trees at the bottom assume the azure tint of distance and the cataracts which roar among them cannot even be heard unless the air be perfectly still These tremendous roads are often not only without rail or parapet of any kind but so narrow that travellers in opposite directions cannot pass unless one of them draw himself up close to the rock In some places where the precipice does not afford footing even for this narrow shelf or where it may have foundered a cleft pine is thrown across the chasm The appalled traveller arriving at the spot surveys it with dismayReturn he dare notfor he knows what a variety of terrors he has already passedYet if his foot slip or the plank on which he rests give way he will find his death and his grave together and never more be heard of  But here we had not even the miniature of these dreadful ideas at least on the side of the lake for in the steepest part we were scarce raised thirty or forty feet above the water  As we edged the precipices we every where saw fragments of rock and large stones scattered about which being loosened by frosts and rains had fallen from the cliffs above and shew the traveller what dangers he has escaped  Once we found ourselves in hands more capricious than the elements We rode along the edge of a precipice under a steep woody rock when some large stones came rolling from the top and rushing through the thickets above us bounded across the road and plunged into the lake At that instant we had made a pause to observe some part of the scenery and by half a dozen yards escaped mischief The wind was loud and we conceived the stones had been dislodged by it's violence but on riding a little further we discovered the real cause High above our heads at the summit of the cliff sat a group of mountain∣eer children amusing themselves with pushing stones from the top and watching as they plunged into the lakeOf us they knew nothing who were screened from them by intervening thickets  As we approached the head of the lake we were desired to turn round and take a view of Castellet that rocky hill which had appeared so enormous as we stood under it It had now shrunk into nothing in the midst of that scene of greatness which surrounded it I mention this circumstance as in these wild countries comparison is the only scale used in the mensuration of mountains At least it was the only scale to which we were ever referred In countries graced by a  single  mountain the inhabitants may be very accurate in their investigation of it's height The altitude and circumference of the  Wrekin  I have no doubt is accurately known in Shropshire but in a country like this where chain is linked to chain exactness would be endless  By this time we approached the head of the lake and could now distinguish the full sound of the fall of Lodoar which had be∣fore reached our ears as the wind suffered indistinctly in broken notes  This waterfall is a noble object both in itself and as an ornament of the lake It appears more as an object  connected with the lake  as we approach by water By land we see it over a promontory of low ground which in some degree hides it's grandeur At the distance of a mile it begins to appear with dignity  But of whatever advantage the fall of Lodoar may be as a piece of  distant  scenery it's effect is very noble when examined  on the spot  As a single object it wants no accompaniments of offskip which would rather injure than assist it They would disturb it's simplicity and repose The greatness of it's parts affords scenery enough Some instruments please in concert others you wish to hear alone  The stream falls through a chasm between two towering perpendicular rocks The in∣termediate part broken into large fragments forms the rough bed of the cascade Some of these fragments stretching out in shelves hold a depth of soil sufficient for large trees Among these broken rocks the stream finds it's way through a fall of at least an hundred feet and in heavy rains the water is every way suited to the grandeur of the scene Rocks and  water in opposition can hardly produce a more animated strife The ground at the bottom also is very much broken and overgrown with trees and thickets amongst which the water is swallowed up into an abyss and at length finds it's way through deep channels into the lake We dismounted and got as near as we could but were not able to approach so near as to look into the woody chasm which receives the fall  Having viewed this grand piece of natural ruin we proceeded in our rout towards the mountains of Borrodale and shaping our course along the southern shores of the lake we came to the river Derwent which is a little to the west of the Lodoar  These two rivers the Lodoar and the Derwent furnish the chief supplies of Der∣wentwater But those of the latter are much ampler The Lodoar accordingly is lost in the lake while the Derwent first giving it's name to it retains it's own to the sea  On passing this river and turning the first great promontory on our left we found ourselves in a vast recess of mountains We had seen them at a distance from the northern extremity of the lake They were then objects of grandeur But now they had assumed their full majestic form surrounding us on every side with their lofty barriers and shutting out in appearance every idea of an escape Wild and various beyond conception were their shapes but they parti∣cipated rather of the desolate than of the fan∣tastic idea From the bottom of the lake in∣deed they formed too great a combination of pointed summits But here all these grotesque shapes disappeared The summits receded far behind and we only saw the bursting rocks and bold protuberances with which the sides of these enormous masses of solid earth are charged Many of them are covered like the steeps of Helvellin with a continued pave∣ment of craggs  The winding of the Derwent was the clue we followed in our passage through these re∣gions of desolation An aperture between the  mountains brought us into another wild recess where a similar scene opened diversified from the first only by some new forms or new position or varied furniture of the incumbent mountains  As we doubled one promontory another unfolded and we found ourselves not in what appeared at first a recess of mountains but in a narrow winding valley the scenes of which by quick transitions were conti∣nually shifting This valley so replete with hideous grandeur is known by the name of the straits of Borrodale  In the middle of one of the recesses of the valley lies an enormous stone which is called in the country  Bootherstone  Massy rocks of immense size rent from mountains are every where found but this stone appears to be of a different kind It does not seem to have been the appendage of a mountain but it∣self an independent creation It lies in a sort of diagonal position overshadowing a space sufficient to shelter a troop of horse  Not far from hence arises a woody hill called  Castellcragg  which is also detached from the scenery around it On the summit of this hill stood formerly a fortress supposed to be of Roman origin intended to guard this avenue into the country After it had been relinquished by the Romans it was oc∣cupied by the Saxons and after their day it was given with all the lands about Borro∣dale by one of the lords of Derwentwater to the monks of Furness By these religious it was still maintained in it's military capacity which is perhaps a singular instance of the kind But as the Scots in those days made frequent irruptions even thus far into the coun∣try and as the monks had great possessions to defend in the valley of Borrodale where one of their principal magazines was esta∣blished the holy fathers thought it proper to adopt this uncommon measure Besides their tythecorn they amassed here the valuable minerals of the country among which salt produced from a spring in the valley was no inconsiderable article  We had now travelled three or four miles in this winding valley which as we ad∣vanced began to assume a softer form The hills became cloathed with verdure and the little recesses of the valley shaded with wood These recesses also which were before shut up and confined by rocky barriers now open∣ed in different shapes and many of them were pleasantly varied with wooded hillocs while the stony banks of the Derwent began to change into meadows scanty indeed but affording pasturage for a few cattle and a pleasant tint of verdure as a contrast with the rocky scenery in it's neighbourhood  We were now in that part of the valley which is  properly  called the valley of Borro∣dalea large circular recess consisting of much broken ground and except where the valley still pursues it's course surrounded by lofty mountains from which pour innumera∣ble rills and torrents tho little interesting in the scene as objects of picturesque beauty  In this deep retreat lies the village of Ros∣thwait having at all times little intercourse with the country but during half the year almost totally excluded from all human com∣merce  Here the sons and daughters of simplicity enjoy health peace and contentment in the midst of what cityluxury would call the ex∣treme of human necessity  Stealing their whole dominion from the waste  Repelling winterblasts with mud and straw  Their scanty patches of arable land and these cultivated with difficulty and their crops lateripening and often a prey to autumnal rains which are violent in this country just give them bread to eat Their herds afford them milk and their flocks cloaths the shepherd himself being often the manufacturer also No dye is necessary to tinge their wool it is naturally a russetbrown and sheep and shepherds are cloathed alike both in the sim∣ple livery of nature  The procuring of fuel is among their great∣est hardships In most parts of the world  this article is sought either in pits or on the surface of the earth Here the inhabitants are obliged to get it on the tops of mountains which abounding with mossy grounds seldom found in the vallies below supply them with peat The difficulty lies in conveying it from such immense heights In doing this they have recourse to a strange and dangerous ex∣pedient tho similar to the modes of con∣veyance which necessity dictates in other mountainous countries They make their peat into bundles and fasten it upon sledges on each of which a man sits and guides the machine with his foot down the precipice We saw many tracks along the sides of moun∣tains made by these sledges several of which were four or five hundred feet high and ap∣peared from the bottom almost perpendicular  After a long and fatiguing morning we refreshed ourselves at the village of Rosthwait on eggs and milk and they who cannot be satisfied with such a meal in a mountainous country must carry their larder with them  SECT XIV  FROM Rosthwait the valley pursues it's course towards the east and losing again it's milder features grows every step more wild and desolate After a march of two miles farther we came to the village of  Satterthwait  still more intrenched in moun∣tains than Rosthwait itself Here in the depth of winter the sun never shines As the spring advances his rays begin to shoot over the southern mountains and at high noon to tip the chimney tops of the village That radiant sign shews the cheerless winter to be now over and rouses the hardy peasant to the labours of the coming year  A little beyond this scene of desolation the Derwent on whose banks we still continued rushes down a long declivity between two  mountains At the fall of Lodoar the higher level comes  abruptly  upon the lower here the two levels are united by a  gradual  descent The streams of course taking the same modes of precipitation as the land the Lodoar forms a perpendicular fall and the Derwent a declivous one But the fall of the Derwent is more singular and is the only one of the kind perhaps in the country  And here I cannot help remarking the sin∣gular character of this mountainstream There is not perhaps a river in England which passes through such a variety of different scenes What wild romantic channel it shapes before it enter the vale of Borrodale is to us un∣known There first we commenced our ac∣quaintance with it It's passage through that mountainchasm is marked with objects not only great in themselves but rarely to be found elsewhere in such interesting combina∣tions  From a mountainstream it soon assumes a new character and changes into a lake where it displays the wonders we have just seen  From hence emerging it again becomes a river but soon forms the lake of Bassenthwait  of form and dimensions very different from that of Keswick  Contracting itself again into a river it puts on a character intirely new Hitherto it has adorned only the wild rough scenes of nature All these it now relinquishesrockslakes and mountains and enters a sweet delightful country where all it's accompaniments are soft and lovely Among other places it visits the noble and picturesque ruins of Cockermouthcastle under the walls of which it glides  From hence it passes to the sea which many streams of greater consequence never meet under their own names but are absorbed by larger rivers while the Derwent after all the astonishing scenes it has adorned adds to it's other beauties those of an estuary  In this last part of it's course it visits Workingtonhall one of the grandest and most beautiful situations of the country Besides it's hanging woods and sloping lawns it is remarkable for having been the first prisonhouse of the unfortunate Mary of Scot∣land after she had landed within the dominions of her rival Here the Derwent becomes navigable and forms the best natural harbour in Cumberland  I have often thought that if a person wished particularly to amuse himself with picturesque scenes the best method he could take would be to place before him a good map of England and to settle in his head the course of all the chief rivers of the country These rivers should be the great directing lines of his excursions On their banks he would be sure not only to find the most beautiful views but would also obtain a compleat system of every kind of landscape He would have no occasion to keep so close to the river he pursued as not to deviate a little for the sake of a beautiful scene Castles and abbeys this plan would almost universally comprehend for most of them are seated either on rocks or knolls pro∣jecting into rivers or in some sweet valley which opens to them Bridges of course it would include which make a pleasing species of scenery Mountains and lakes I need not mention the former produce rivers and the latter are produced by them It would also include seacoast views many of which are very interesting when the estuary opens to  some beautiful winding shore with views of distant country  I once attempted to analyze the Thames in this way But I was obliged to divide so magnificent a subject Indeed it naturally divided itself into three partsfrom Oxford to Windsorfrom Windsor to Londonand from London to the sea An imperial river like the Thames must be navigated at least it's two lower divisions but inferior rivers are best examined by an excursion along their banks  We left the Derwent in it's declivous course between two mountains One of them under whose shadow the torrent pours is called Eagle'scragg as it's tremendous rocks are the chief habitation of these birds and seem to be considered by them as a sort of castle which from time immemorial they have pos∣sessed It is a common species of traffic in this country to supply the curious with young eagles in the taking of which the inhabitants are very expert They observe the nests from the bottom and judging of the age of the young birds they catch the opportunity  when the old eagles are abroad and let them∣selves down by ropes from the summits of the cliffs We saw one which had been just taken It was only six weeks old and was nearly of the size of a turkeyhen It seemed to have acquired already a full share of ferocity and screamed violently if we offered to touch it  Many large birds we saw amongst these mountains sailing about the air which we imagined to be eagles but one of our com∣pany being a naturalist bad us observe their tail feathers If their tails were forked they were of the buzzard species the tail of the eagle is circular  Among the anecdotes we heard in this country of eagles one was rather curious An eagle was seen at a distance to pounce it's prey which it carried in a perpendicular ascent aloft into the air and hanging dubious for some time it was at length observed to descend in the same direct line and it's fall as it approached seemed attended with an odd tumbling motion The cause was soon discovered It fell stone dead on the ground and a weasel which it had carried up and which had had the address to  kill it's adversary in the air being now at liberty ran away  We had accompanied the valley of Borro∣dale as far to the east as Eagle'scragg It stretches also to the west tho in a more broken and abrupt form  Somewhat further on this side than Eagle'scragg lies on the other rise those mountains where the celebrated blacklead mine is wrought I could not help feeling a friendly attachment to this place which every lover of the pencil must feel as deriving from this mineral one of the best instruments of his art the freest and readiest expositor of his ideas We saw the site of the mine at a distance marked with a dingy yellow stain from the ochery mixtures thrown from it's mouth which shiver down the sides of the mountain  During the periodical season of working it for it is opened only once in seven years many people pick up a comfortable subsistence from the scraps of blacklead which escape amongst the coarser strata These are honest gains But a late prolific genius in fraud took a very indirect method of possessing a  share of this rich mineral A part of the mountain contiguous to the mine was his property Here at the expence of great labour he sank a shaft which he carried diagonally till he entered the mine where with subterraneous wickedness he continued his depredations for some time undiscovered At length his fraud was brought to light and he was tried at Carlisle The peculiarity of his case had no precedent He saved his life but a law was obtained by the proprietors of the mine to defend their property from such indirect attacks for the future  The sun was now declining and it was too late to take a nearer view of the mine nor indeed did it promise more on the spot than it discovered at a distance Besides the beauties of Watenlath had been so strongly represented to us that we were resolved to go in quest of those scenes in preference to any other  Watenlath is that tract of mountainous country itself surrounded by mountains still higher which coming boldly forward breaks down abruptly from the south upon the vale  of Keswick The stream which forms the fall of Lodoar adorns first the scenes of Wa∣tenlath  "Which way to Watenlath" said one of our company to a peasant as we left the vale of Borrodale "That way" said he pointing up a lofty mountain steeper than the tiling of a house  To those who are accustomed to moun∣tains these perpendicular motions may be amusing but to us whose ideas were less elevated they seemed rather peculiar And yet there is something unmanly in conceiving a difficulty in traversing a path which we were told the women of the country would ascend on horseback with their panniers of eggs and butter and return in the night To move upwards keeping a steady eye on the objects before us was no great exercise to the brain but it rather gave it a rotation to look back on what was pastand to see our companions below  clinging  as it ap∣peared to the mountain's side and the rising breasts and bellies of their horses straining up a path so steep that it seemed as if the least false step would have carried them rolling many hundred yards to the bottom  We had another apprehension that of mis∣taking our way If a mist had suddenly overspread the mountain which is a very common incident we might have wandered all night for we had not the precaution to take a guide The question we asked of the peasant at the bottom of the mountain "Which  way  to Watenlath" we found was a very improper one We should have asked in what  direction  we were to seek it For  way  there was none except here and there a blind path which being itself often bewildered of course served only to bewilder us The inhabitants pay little attention to  paths  they steer along these wilds by  land∣marks  which to us were unknown  At length however after a painful perpen∣dicular march of near two miles and many a breathing pause which our horses required we gained the top Here we expected at least to be rewarded by an amusing prospect over the neighbouring country But in this too we were disappointed We found ourselves in the midst of a bog with still higher grounds around us so that after all our toil we had a view only of a vile circumscribed waste  It was our business now to get out of this unpleasant scene as soon as we could which was a matter of no great difficulty An easy and short descent on the other side of the mountain brought us quickly to Watenlath Here our labours were amply rewarded We fell into a piece of scenery which for beauty and grandeur was equal if not superior to any thing we had yet seen  The first object we found was a small lake about two miles in circumference through which flows the Lodoar and after a course of three miles farther forms that noble cas∣cade which we had seen in the morning at the head of Derwentwater  The accompaniments of this river from the lake of Watenlath to it's fall make the scenery of which we came hither in quest  It is a valley so contracted that it affords room for little more than the river and a path at the bottom while the mountains on each side are so perpendicular that their summits are scarce more asunder than their bases It was a new idea Many mountains we had seen hanging over the sides of vallies  but to be immured through a space of almost three miles within a chasm of rifted rocks for that was in fact the idea presented by the scene before us was a novel circumstance tho we had now been two or three days the inhabitants of mountains  The form of this valley was very different from the valley of Borrodale The one led us through a winding rout the other is nearly a vista Each hath it's mode of grandeur The valley of Borrodale has more variety but this is certainly the more majestic scene The whole is only one vast effort In point of immensity indeed it yields to the vista at the entrance into Cumberland It is not so vast a  whole  but being contracted within a smaller compass we examine it's limits with more ease and with regard to the grandeur and variety of the several  objects  it loses no∣thing As we stood  under  the beetling cliffs on each side they were too near for inspection their harsh features wanted softening but we had noble views of them all in order both in  prospect  and  retrospect  Not only the de∣sign and composition but the very strokes of nature's pencil might be traced through the whole scene every fractured rock and every  hanging shrub which adorned it was brought within the compass of the eye each touch so careless and yet so determined so wildly irregular and yet all conducing to one whole  When we arrived at the close of the valley the grandeur of the scene increased It open∣ed into an amphitheatre the area of which like the valley that led to it was contracted scarce containing the circumference of a mile but the mountains which invironed it were grand and beautiful  In most of the scenes we had passed we were obliged to look for contrast in the dif∣ferent modes of desolation but here barren∣ness was contrasted with all the tints of vege∣tation The mountains in front and on the left were covered with wood which mantled from the top to the bottom Those on the right were barren yet broken so variously as even in themselves to make a contrast We admire the ruins of a Roman amphi∣theatre but what are the most magnificent of the works of art compared with such an amphitheatre as this Were the Colosseum itself brought hither and placed within this area the grandeur of the idea would be lost  and the ruin magnificent as it is would dwindle into the  ornament of a scene  At the entrance of the amphitheatre an∣other bright mountaintorrent joins the Lodoar from the east and forms it into a more con∣siderable stream With increased velocity the ground growing every step more declivous it now pours along with great rapidity and throwing itself into the thickest of the woods which close the scene disappears The ima∣gination pursues it's progress It's roar is heard through the woods and it is plain from the sound that it suffers some great convul∣sion But all is close impervious rocks and thickets intervene and totally exclude the sight  We indeed had been behind the scenes and knew we were at that instant upon the summit of the fall of Lodoar but the ima∣gination of a stranger would be held in sti∣mulating suspense The grandeur of the sound would proclaim the dignity of the fall and his eye would wish to participate of what his ear alone could inadequately judge  Tho we had seen the fall of Lodoar from the bottom we had a curiosity to see how  it appeared from the top and dismounting we contrived by winding round the thickets and clinging to the projections of the rocks to get a dangerous peep down the abyss There was nothing picturesque in the view but something immensely grand We stood now above those two cheeks of the chasm through which the water forced it's way and which in the morning when seen from the bottom appeared towering to a great height and were the most interesting parts of the view But amidst the greatness of the objects which now surrounded them they were totally lost appearing less than warts upon those vast limbs of nature to which they adhered  In our passage through the valley of Waten∣lath we met with many fragments of rocks in which the several component strata were very strongly marked In some they could not have been more regularly formed by a rule and chissel and in a few whose softer lamina the weather had decayed as perfect cornices remained as art could have produced  Having taken a view of all this scenery and the evening beginning now to close we thought it time to put a stop to our curiosity and return to Keswick from which we were about four miles distant In the morning we rode alone the edge of the lake but as we were now upon the higher grounds we were obliged to make a compass round the moun∣tains  These desolate grounds are very little in∣habited We heard of a design to introduce goats among them with a view to make Kes∣wick as celebrated for drinking goat'swhey as several of the mountainous parts of Scot∣land In some places indeed where there are valuable woods the goat might be a per∣nicious inmate But in many places as we rode the bare and craggy sides of hills seemed capable of feeding nothing else Frequent little plots of herbage grow every where among the rocks inaccessible to any other animal Even sheep on many of these sloping shelves could find no footing All this pasturage  therefore is lost for want of goats to brouze it  In a picturesque light no ornament is more adapted to a mountainous and rocky coun∣try than these animals Their colours are beautiful in those particularly of a darker hue often playing into each other with great harmony But among these animals as among all others the pied are the most unpleasing in which opposite colours come full upon each other without any intervening tint  The shagginess of the goat also is as beau∣tiful as the colours which adorn him his hair depending in that easy flow which the pencil wishes to imitate  His actions are still more pleasing It would add new terror to a scene to see an animal brouzing on the steep of a perpen∣dicular rock or hanging on the very edge of a projecting precipice Virgil seems to have looked at these attitudes of terror with delight  Ite capellae  Non ego vos posthac viridi projectus in antro  Dumosâ pendere procul de rupe videbo  SECT XV  IN our rout to Borrodale we passed through the eastern and southem parts of that mountainous country which bounds the lake of Derwentin our next expedition we pro∣posed to view the western  From Keswick we mounted the hills on the northwest of the lake and on the other side fell into the valley of Newlands which we traversed from end to end It was a lovely scene totally different from the rude vallies we had yet met with The mountains in general on this side of the lake wear a smoother form than those either on the east or on the south Of this smoothness of fea∣ture in the  higher  grounds the  lower  participate The mountain vallies we had hitherto seen were wild rocky and desolate But here  the idea of terror was excluded The valley of Newlands was even adorned with the beau∣ties of luxuriant nature We travelled through groves which were sometimes open and sometimes close with a sparkling stream the common attendant of these vallies ac∣companying us through the whole scene  Having been amused with this sweet scenery about three miles we entered another valley or rather a mountain recess called the valley of Gascadale I call it a recess because it is soon terminated by a mountain running athwart which denies any further passage Instead therefore of entering Gascadale we were obliged to climb the hill which forms one of it's sides and from the summit we had a view not only of Gascadale but of many other mountain recesses all which par∣ticipate more or less of the smoothness of the high grounds in their neighbourhood Some of them were scooped and hollowed into very beautiful forms in which wood alone was wanting  The valley of Gascadale had nothing to recommend it but novelty It was a scene  wholly new in this rugged country a deep mountain recess invironed on every side except the entrance by smooth sloping hills which are adorned neither with wood nor rock nor broken ground but sweep down from side to side with the greatest regularity We scarce remembered to have seen in any place an operation of nature more completely formal At the head of this recess is a grand cascade We supposed it to be no great object of beauty as it was probably void of all accom∣paniments but it's poverty was hid beneath a veil The clouds which were gathering upon the mountains and sweeping along the val∣lies began to intercept our view Every thing was wrapped in obscurity When we stood even on the summit of the cascade we could only hear the torrent roar but could not obtain the least glimpse of it tho no object intervened The whole valley of Gas∣cadale smoaked like a boiling caldron and we got our ideas of it only by catches as the volumes of clouds dispersed at intervals into purer air  But what we lost in one respect by the grossness of the atmosphere we gained in another Tho it is probable some views were  obscured which might have pleased as it is equally probable that many of those disgusting features with which we might have been presented were softened and rendered more agreeable to the eyeHere indeed the misty hue was in general laid on with too full a pencil The face of nature was rather blotted out than obscured The whole view was in that state which Thomson so well de∣scribes  No more the mountain fills the eye  With great variety but in a night  Of gathering vapour from the baffled sense  Sinks dark and dreary Thence expanding wide  The huge dusk gradual swallows up the plain  Vanish the woods The dim seen river seems  Sullen and slow to rowl the misty wave  Among the beautiful appearances of fogs and mists their  gradually going off  may be observed A landscape takes a variety of pleas∣ing hues as it passes in a retiring fog through the different modes of obscurity into full splendor  There is great beauty also in a fog's  partially clearing up at once  as it often does and presenting some distant piece of landscape under great radiance when all the surround∣ing parts are still in obscurity The curtain is not intirely drawn up it is only just raised to let in some beautiful transient view and perhaps falling again while we admire leaves us that ardent relish which we have for pleasing objects suddenly removedSome very beautiful ideas of this kind were displayed on the summits of Gascadale Tho the moun∣tains around us and the contracted vallies in our neighbourhood were all so much absorbed in the dark atmosphere of clouds and vapours we could discover in catches through their thinner skirts the vale of Keswick at a distance overspread with serenity and sun∣shine  The mountain over which we passed is called in the language of the country a  hawse  or stoppage in passing from one district to another the valley being closed and no other way left This  hawse  tho not so steep as the mountain which led us to Watenlath  was of much longer continuance and in some parts carried us very near the edges of preci∣pices but surrounded by fogs we kept the path before us and if there was danger we seldom saw it  As we began to descend we breathed a purer air and got a sight of the landscape before us It was a scene unlike what we had just passed but only as the botanist speaks a variety of the same genus corre∣sponding intirely with the character of the country which we now traversed Three broad mountains sloping into each other formed a tripartite valley centering in one point The surface of each mountain was smooth to it's very summit except that here and there a few large stones lay scattered about some of them fixed in the soil but none of them deserving the appellation of a rock Through two of the divisions of this valley ran different streams each of them as unfringed and simple as the mountains they severed These streams uniting in the centre formed a third The whole was a peculiar and novel scene but neither interesting nor picturesque  These smoothcoated mountains tho of little estimation in the painter's eye are how∣ever great sources of plenty They are the nurseries of sheep which are bred here and fatted in the vallies  But the life of a shepherd in this country is not an Arcadian life His occupation sub∣jects him to many difficulties in the winter especially when he is often obliged to attend his flock on the bleak side of a mountain which engages him in many a painful vigil And when the mountains are covered with snow which is frequently the case his em∣ployment becomes then a dangerous one It seldom happens but that some part of his flock is snowed up and in preserving their lives he must often expose his own  After winding about two miles along the edge of one of these smooth mountains we dropped at once into a beautiful vale called the vale of Butermer the bottom of which was adorned by a lake of the same name  This lake is small about a mile and a half in length and half a mile in breadth of an oblong form sweeping at one end round a woody promontory But this sweep is rather forced and from some points makes too acute an angle It is one of those lines which would have a better effect from a boat  See page  A lower point would soften it's abruptness In other parts also the lines of this lake are rather too square The scenery however about it is grand and beautiful  On the western side a long range of moun∣tainous declivity extends from end to end falling every where precipitately into the water at least it had that appearance to the eye tho on the spot probably a margin of meadow might shoot from the bottom of the mountain as we observed at Keswick Of the line which the summit of this mountain formed we could not easily judge as it was in a great measure hid in clouds  The eastern side of the lake is woody and contrasts happily with the western But the wood is of that kind which is periodically  cut down and was not in perfection when we saw it  Near the bottom of this lake is the loftiest cascade we had ever seen It hardly I think falls through a less descent than three or four hundred yards But it is an object of no beauty it is barren of accompaniments and appears at a distance like a white ribbon bisecting the mountain The people of the country alluding to the whiteness of it's foam call it  sourmilkforce  The vale of Butermer is rather confined in that part which the lake occupies Below it extends a considerable way but our rout led us first above in quest of some rocky mountains which are supposed to be the highest precipices in the country These scenes which are known by the name of  Gatesgarth∣dale  open at the head of the lake  Here we found two vallies formed by a mountain on each side and one in the middle The right hand valley was soon closed by a  hawse  that on the left led directly to the scenes we sought  The transition here contrary to the usual process of nature is abrupt We had been travelling all the morning among mountains  perfectly smooth and covered with herbage and now found ourselves suddenly among craggs and rocks and precipices as wild and hide∣ous as any we had seen  Gatesgarthdale  into which we soon entered is indeed a very tremendous scene Like all the vallies we had yet found it had a peculiar character It's features were it's own It was not a vista like the valley of Watenlath nor had it any of the sudden turns of the valley of Borrodale but it wound slowly and so∣lemnly in one large segment It was wider also than either of those vallies being at least half a quarter of a mile from side to side which distance it pretty uniformly observed the rocky mountains which invironed it keeping their line with great exactness at least never breaking out into any violent projections  The area of this valley is in general con∣cave the sides almost perpendicular composed of a kind of broken craggy rock the ruins of which every where strew the valley and give it still more the idea of desolation  The river also which runs through it and is the principal supply of the lake is as wild as the valley itself It has no banks but the fragments of rocks no bed but a channel composed of rocky strata among which the water forces it's course It's chan∣nel as well as it's bank is formed of loose stones and fragments which break and di∣vide the stream into a succession of wild im∣petuous eddies  A stream which is the natural source of plenty is perhaps when unaccompanied with verdure the strongest emblem of desolation It shews the spot to be so barren that even the greatest source of abundance can produce nothing The whole valley indeed joined in impressing the same idea Fruitful nature making in every part of her ample range un∣remitting efforts to vegetate could not here produce a single germin  As we proceeded the grandeur of the valley increased We had been prepared indeed to see the highest precipices which the country produced Such a preface is generally pro∣ductive of disappointment but on this occasion it did no injury The fancy had still it's scope We found the mountains so overhung with  clouds that we could form little judgment of their height Our guide told us they were twice as high as we could see which however we did not believe from the observa∣tions we were able to make as the clouds at intervals floated past and discovered here and there the shadowy forms of the rocky summits A great height however they cer∣taily were and the darkness in which they were wrapped gave us a new illustration of the grandeur of those ideas which arise from obscurity  Dark confused uncertain ima∣ges Mr Burk very justly observes have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander passions than those which are more clear and determinate For hardly any thing can strike the mind with it's greatness which does not make some sort of approach towards infinity which no∣thing can do whilst we are able to per∣ceive it's bounds but to see an object distinctly and to perceive it's bounds is one and the same thing A clear idea therefore is another name for a little idea  On the sublime and beautiful Part II Sect IV    The middle of the valley is adorned as these vallies in some part often are by a craggy hill on the top of which stands the fragment of a rock that looks in Ossian's language like the  stone of power  the rude deity of desolation to which the scene is sacred  This valley is not more than six miles from the blacklead mines and would have led us to them if we had pursued it's course  Having travelled about three miles in this dreary scene and having taken such a view as we could obtain of the bold inclosures which contained it we returned by the same rout we came threading the valley and skirt∣ing the lake along it's eastern coast till we arrived at the bottom of it Here we fell into a country very different from that we had left  The vale of Butermer which extends many miles below the lake is a wide variegated scene full of rising and falling ground woody  in many parts well inhabited in some fruit∣ful and luxuriant in all  Here we found a village where we made a luxurious repast as usual on eggs and milk and met in the chearful and healthy looks of the inhabitants new proofs of the narrow limits in which all the real wants of life are comprized  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
