 THE CASE OF THOMAS SPENCE BOOKSELLER THE CORNER OF  CHANCERYLANE LONDON  Who was committed to CLERKENWELL PRISON On MONDAY the th os DECEMBER For Selling the Second Part of Paine's Rights of Man And a BILL of INDICTMENT found against him  To which is added an extract of a Letter from His Grace the Duke of Richmond To the Chairman of the Committee of the County of Sussex convened at Lewis January for the Purpose of presenting a Petition to the House of Commons to take into consideration the unequal State of Representation in Parliament c  PRICE THREEPENCE    THE CASE OF THOMAS SPENCE c  THE annals of prosecutions do not present to the world a more extraordinary case than that of the unfortunate man who is the subject of the following pages It is not however for us in the present stage of this business to declaim either against the laws of the British empire or the persons to whom those laws are entrusted An innocent man has nothing to fear from the scourge of truth'tis the guilty only that need tremble at investigation The notorious character of whatever species pleasingly exults in the obscurity of his depraved actionsbut when the keen eye of discovery penetrates his horrid mansion he would chearfully give a thousand worlds to escape enquiry It may be well for individuals both of high and low degree to mark these observations  Not to detain the reader with a long introduction we shall take the liberty of prefacing this narrative with a fictitious one where the scenes might have occurred in another country and leave Englishmen to make what comments they please Suppose then the following oc∣currences in Sweden or any other country under what∣ever governments your own minds may conceive  It is presumed the laws of every government is very explicit particularly with respect to transgressions and punishments this has been the boast of Britons and we shall think but little of France till she has by intrinsic  merit acquired that degree of eminence In Sweden however we suppose that a certain publication of exclamation and declamation were sent into the world such as Mr Burke's for instance violently condemning the principles of the British Revolution in and consigning the abettors of that Revolution to destruc∣tion that another person of opposite political principles were hardy enough to attack the bold declaimer and while justifying such a Revolution was to make some very severe and pointed strictures on the government of Sweden Suppose then the legislature of Sweden finding the last writer had exposed some of their mal∣pactices and were to be fearful the contagion would spread whereby they might be deprived of their noble feasting c cin consequence of which they deter∣mined to institute an action against their bold competi∣tor in order to try the merits of the work and if pos∣sible to condemn it by due course of lawsuppose they were to take advantage by proclamations c and pro∣secute  poor  individuals who might be found selling the intended proscribed work before it was actually pro∣scribed by a fair and regular trialwould not the in∣dignation of every English spectator be raised at the littleness the meanness the wretchedness of the Swedish legislators who dared to violate the rights of man in so fl  grant a manner Oh Albion how great are thy su∣perior privileges  Immediately on the institution of a celebrated Society at the Crown and Anchor for preserving places and pensions Mr Spence being a poor man and less likely to oppose the lordly menaces of violent Aristocracy was repeatedly surrounded insulted and even threatened with his life and the destruction of his little all if he did not give up p  t of his bread and decline selling the Rights of Man and other political tracts The eager∣ness of the public mind for political investigation almost rendered it useless for him to keep any other ar∣ticles and therefore to a poor man it was indeed a very  us sacrifice unless they had  threatened  him  likewise with an ampse compensation Indeed their con∣duct was contemptible for no one of the opposite party ever offered him the most modest reproach for selling even  Mr Burke's  pamphets It may be ob∣served that Mr Spence being so exposed with only a stall in the open street these petty beings thought they might presume on his unprotected situation Even a pious Rector had the audacity to attack the defenceless man and endeavoured to avail himself of the natural in∣fluence of his profession over the landlord by urging him to turn Mr Spence out of the stall Oh Depra∣vity where is thy blush  On Thursday morning Dec two runners at the instance of a Mr Reeves  One of the runners has since called on Mr Spence and in∣formed him that it was by the desire of Mr Chairman R's that he took him up and confessed that he was heartily tired of such businessthat Mr R had never the generosity to pay him for the book which he ordered him to purchase for the official in∣formation We leave the chief political inquisitor of England to these  erene enjoyments which his newly assumed character so ad∣mirably inspires  came to T Spence's stall and bought by mistake Spence's Rights of Man instead of Paine's Rights of Man Immediately on which they took him with their usual ceremony before the civil magistrate at the police office in Ha  ton Gar∣den and laid their information against him To the honour of the magistrate however he declined com∣mitting Mr Spence as he could find no statute to justify him in it Mr Spence told him in his defence that he might as well commit every one who sold Gulliver's Travels More's Eutropi  Lock on Government Puf∣fendorf on the Law of Nature c c all of which treated the subject of Government in a manner vastly opposite to the British system Here however we must observe that no compensation was m  de to Mr Spence for tearing him like a criminal from his bu∣siness c c  Monday the th of December between two and three o'clock two of the Bowstreet runners came to Mr Spence and purchased Paine's Rights of Man after which  in the most unprecedented manner without even shew∣ing the least authority they obliged him to put up the shutters of his stall and hustled him into an hackneycoach which they ordered to be driven to Bowstreet During the bustle and the journey Mr Spence feeling very properly the indignity offered both to law and justice by these proceedings remonstrated with the prostituted ruffians and modestly asked them whether he was to consider himself in Spain Turkey Algiers or England It appeared to him as though he were en∣chanted to one of the most despotic spots in the universe Never perhaps were the rights of citizens so shamefully invaded as in this instance nor shall we wonder if the complaints of individuals in this respect should drive them to acts of desperationmay the great God however avert such a catastrophe  When the unfortunate prisoner arrived at Bowstreet the magistrate was at dinner of course the victim of de∣spotism was carried to a public house near the office where he was safely guarded at least three hours till his worship had finished his repast In this blessed mansion the runners by what authority can hardly be guessed un∣less their honourable profession warranted it searched Mr Spence's pockets and even took from him his pocket book papers and memorandums relating to his business c which they have never yet returned The pocket∣book contained extracts from Locke Puffendorf Swift Pope and even the th chapter of the book of Leviti∣cus all of which related to government and may ac∣cording to the present system of proceedings be equally termed libellous Perhaps since the days of bloody Queen Mary have no prisoner under the same circumstances been treated in so violent a manner as Mr Spence was during his stay in the public house Will it be credited that a man assuming the air of a gentleman could wan∣touly insult even the most guilty felon and yet it is a fact that a person of such a description seized Mr Spence by the throat and had not fear prevented would willingly have strangled himuttering the most horrid imprecations that he was not warranted in carrying his  inveterate malice to such an extreme Well indeed' might Mr Spence exclaim What country am I in Na∣ture shudders at the relation of instances of such depra∣vity in the human race and those despicable characters scarcely deserve the epithet of  human  much less the ani∣mating title of Britons It surely will hardly be credited hereafter that these are the actions of the eighteenth cen∣tury Better for Englishmen openly to request a Bastile they would then at least be on their guard In the present instance they have been grossly misled into the violation of laws which they have understood were never promul∣gated and are treated as traitors for crimes they never dreamt of The book had not been condemned by a legal process and they had always been taught that no crime attached itself to selling any publication till it was thus legally proscribed Is not this the language of al∣most every person both in the House of Commons and out of it  It is follyit is madness for men in these days idly to chatter about their darling hobby horse  Liberty  A great part of them in the midst of such childish excla∣mations are positively endeavouring to  outrun  each other and by  nicknamed  loyalty  eagerly  striving which shall sacri∣fice his  dearest  interest and the interest of his posterity to the  most inflexible despotism  that  ever  disgraced the world These observations cannot apply to Englishmen  We must now direct the reader's attention to the trans∣actions in the Public Office After the usual technical formula Mr Spence requested his worship to inform him by what authority his journeymen were justified in their proceedings With all the sagacity which the nature of the case inspired his worship adverted to the Royal Pro∣clamations and even to the opinion of the Grand Jury Mr Spence was naturally led to doubt either the validity of indifinite Proclamations or the legality of the opi∣nion of the Grand Jury in justification of arbitrary pro∣ceedings previous to a public trial However agree∣able to the natural order of things the prisoner being the weakest party was obliged to submitTo the ho∣nor or rather to the disgrace of the mercenary attend∣ants  of Public Offices Mr Spence was assailed by a con∣siderable party with threats and violent pushes that even the American Indians would have thought a disgrace to their savage manners With all the deliberation and coolness so characteristic of a bloodthirsty crew the instruments of this extraordinary business delivered an exaggerated evidence fearing perhaps they should be deprived of their emoluments by the prisoner's escape When will man reflect and consider the true dignity of the human species by acting conformable to his judg∣ment and despising every thing that may impeach his integrity This will apply from the highest character in states through every gradation civil and official down to the common hangman With a very ill grace then does it become the implements of abuses to strain every nerve both of violence and injustice for securing to themselves the wretched enjoyment of places which in their own consciences they hold contemptible  The runners will it be credited had the consum∣mate impudence to threaten this unfortunate man with leading him through the streets heavy ironed if he would not submit to pay the hire of a coach to Clerkenwell Prison nay they had the audacity to bring forth irons for the purpose Mr Spence however with that dignity which conscious innocence naturally inspires spurned the monsters and their threats and told them he would rather submit to be led like a felon than suf∣fer such an imposition At length they consented to conduct him to goal without those unnecessary imple∣ments where he arrived about eleven o'clock at night Here Mr Spence was ushered in with the usual saluta∣tions of the collegia  c officers which consisted of the most abusive menaces and illiberal treatment that their ingenu∣ity could possibly invent He was asked whether he chose to have a bed and upon answering in the affirma∣tive an immediate demand of one shilling was made by one of the turnkeys for that indulgencehe had likewise one penny to pay for the use of a candle which the turnkey held in his hand nor did the wretch allow him time to take off his cloaths before he locked him up in a so∣litary  cellThe bed was so immoderately damp as to oblige him to lay down in his cloaths and in the morning he found himself so poorly as led him to fear the conse∣quences  In the morning Mr Spence was taken from his for∣lorn dungeon and sent down into the yard among the most common felons where he was accosted by the miserable collegians in their usual stile  The poor wretches always rejoice to see strangers introduced as it is customary for them to apply to every New Prisoner for  garnish  either that they may allay the cravings of hunger or drown the recollec∣tion of their unhappy situations in liquor To add to his misfortunes Mr Spence was obliged to comply with all their demands or be denied the privilege of citizenship even among them and it cost him in goal fees garnish c in the course of thirty hours previous to being libe∣rated by bail one pound four shillings which to a poor man is a great sum  During the absence of Mr Spence from his stall some mischievous person or persons perhaps delegated from the  usual source  had the impudence to write three sepa∣rate papers and stick them on his shutters purporting "That the owner was confined in gaol for selling seditious books and they hoped it would be a warning to others"  The Public need only be informed that the GrandJury afterwards found a true Bill of Indictment against Mr Spence and it remains for him now to await a judicial decision  To enumerate the numerous persecutions which Mr Spence has endured previous to the foregoing Pro∣cess and since would take more time than the Editor could well spare  One instance however it would be almost unpardon∣able to pass over unnoticed On Thursday the th of December the day his Majesty opened the present session of parliament a gentleman or one who aimed to be thought so came to Mr Spence's stall and seeing a young man with the first part of Paine's Rights of Man in his  hand which by the bye has never been even disputed by the AttorneyGeneral seized the book and in a curious alias Grubstreet dialect abused Mr Spence hustled him about tore his shirt and dragged him to an adjoining shop where joined by more of his  brutal fraternity  he robbed the poor man of two other books One of the villains hastened to the Police Office to fetch some run∣ners while the others guarded the persecuted man uttering violent threats savage menaces c c The spectators however to their honour be it mentioned observing the lengths the ruffians would carry their infamous conduct calmly interfered and rescued the prisoner from the hands of the most  diabolical  and  lawless banditti  that ever threatened the peace of the metropolis Perhaps these were some of the  immaculate  members of a certain  inquisitorial Society  at least they must be sanc∣tioned by a dark and mysterious group not less diabolical than themselves  REFLECTIONS  The present aerea seems as a dream one can scarcely credit the transactions of every preceding day  Truth  is a libel and  falshood  is a libelhow then to steer between the two extremes requires the sagacity of a knave or the duplicity of a hypocrite To what a situation is the intellects of man reduced Were it possible to deprive the numerous hoards of mankind with very few ex∣ceptions of their rational facultiesto divest them of thinkingto restrain them from speakingto draw a veil over their occult powersand cancel their sensibi∣lity it would be perfectly conformable with prevailing politics to attempt the experiment Infatuation and ig∣norancedepravity and corruptionviolence and in∣trigue seem united against the progress of knowledge and the interest of society The world however has ever been governed by fluctuations and what one age or one description of beings have estimated as blessings succeeding ages or a different description of beings have estimated as curses Perhaps some degree of propriety  has attached itself to each party and rational minds have only been able to contemplate the consequences without the power of affording any alleviation to the victims of contention But may we not anticipate a better age and a superior degree of civilization when society will be united under one interest and man be no more the dupe of factionwhen peace will spread her genial wings and leave the human mind to the en∣joyment of those blessings which nature has so bounte∣fully bestowed when industry will be relieved from the almost insurmountable fetters of the present hour and the only barrier to civil enjoyments will be those of vicious inclinations  A review of the numerous characters of Europe who with minds that would do honour to the higher ranks but from the largness of their families and political cir∣cumstances are bowed down with poverty and oppression will fully justify the feeling mind in ardently panting for so glorious an aera  On Monday the th of December Mr Spence re∣ceived the following notice from his landlord by the hands of the landlord's daughter  Mr Thomas Spence  I hereby give you notice to quit and leave the book stall you hold of me at the corner of Chancerylane in the county of Middlesex at Ladyday next Dated this th day of December  John Harrington  Witness Mary Harrington  The young woman remarked to Mr Spence on deli∣vering the above that several of her father's customers had threatened to withdraw their favours and interest if he suffered Mr S to contiue on the premises What consolation they can derive from being the means of depriving an honest man of his livelihood would exceedingly puzzle a generous mind to discover We may however fairly hope that the party who so strongly have supported the efforts of despotism will impartially reconsider their conduct and we doubt not but they will find occasion sufficient to blush and be sorry at the consequences that must inevitably follow their exer∣tions  DUKE OF RICHMOND  Extract of a letter from His Grace the DUKE of RICHMOND to the Chairman of a Meeting of the County of Sussex convened at Lewes January for the purpose of presenting a petition to the House of Commons to take into consideration the unequal state of Representation in Parliament  Whitehall  January  SIR  YOU may easily believe that being one of those who joined in requesting you to eall a county meeting nothing but illness can prevent me attending it and it is with infinite regret I submit to the decision of my phy∣sicians who pronounce that it is not safe for me to leave London  I trust that my sentiments on the subject of  Parlia∣mentary Reform  are in general sufficiently known and that without further assurances I might be  depended upon for giving it every support in my power  but some circumstances make me wish to state them as briefly as possible to the county of Sussex They are formed on the  experience of twentysix years  which whether in or out of government has equally convinced me that the  Restoration of a genuine House of Commons  by a  renova∣tion  of the  Rights of the People  is the  only essential reme∣dy  against that  system of corruption  which has brought the nation to disgrace and poverty and threatens it with the  less of Liberty  I take the grievance of the present state of election to be its  gross inequality  All the electors in GreatBri∣tain do not amount to  onesixth  part of the whole people and a still greater inequality subsists in elections made by that sixth part for  oneseventh part of them  elect a ma∣jority so that  onefortysecond  part of the nation dispose of the  prpeerty of the whole  and have their  lives and li∣berties at command  And this fortysecond part far from consisting of the most opulent part of the kingdom is composed of the small boroughs most of which are be∣come either the private property of individuals or are  notoriously sold to the best bidder so that counties and great cities are in fact as well as the great mass of the people swallowed up by this  system of corruption  My ideas of reform undoubtedly go to one that shall be  complete and general throughout the kingdom  I see such fatal consequences arise from the present partial and accidental state of election that I cannot take upon me to propose any new mode that partakes of the same de∣fects If we do not differ from the  abettors of corruption  upon the broad principle of inequality in election and the  universal right of the people to be represented  and are contending only for a degree of partiality more or less I fear our ground is not sound if we mean only to sub∣stitute partiality for partiality and are struggling but for its extent one man's whim may be as good as another's conceit and we have nothing certain to direct us and if inequality is still to subsist the advocates of the pre∣sent system will have the sanction of time and the risk of changes to oppose to us which will have their weight when it is but for a change of partiality that we contend  I have thought that a  Parliamentary Reform  had much more simple and unerring guides to lead us to our end I mean the  true principles of the Constitution  and the  Rights of the People  If these exist I do not con∣sider myself at liberty to speculate upon system I have no choice but to give to every man his own  How far it is wise for those who entirely agree in principle upon the  Rights of Men  to endeavour to per∣suade them that the  recovery of their birthrights and most essential interests  "are not reducible to practice nor attainable by any regular or constitutional efforts of theirs" is what I must leave others to determine But the truth of this assertion is what I can never subscribe to I cannot but think that this nation ever has it in its own power by  peaceful and constitutional efforts to do itself justice  and that nothing can render attempts for this purpose impracticable but either a  general indolence  and  indifference to all that requires exertion  though for the  noblest purposes  or prejudice to favourite systems as shall divide the people  To guard against such an imputation falling on me I most readily agree to an address in the most gene∣ral terms not pointing to any specific mode of reform in the petition or by instructions to our members or by resolutions but submitting the remedy as in my opinion it ought to be in the first instance to Parlia∣ment itself which I conceive to be as equal to such a consideration as any Provincial Committee  Should Mr WYVIL'S first or second plan be pro∣posed in Parliament or any thing like it although I shall lament that we for a moment quit our advantageous ground of the  Constitution  and the  Rights of Men  yet I shall certainly give every support in my power to this or any other amendment and it certainly will be a consi∣derable improvement that instead of a fortysecond it should be a thirtysixth or thirtieth part that shall de∣cide the concerns of the whole people It will be some∣thing material they will have gained and may become a step to the more easy attainment of their privileges  I must sincerely hope that that plan may be found attainable but I never can consent to tell the people and I hope to God they never will believe that the re∣covery of any right which Nature and the Constitution have given them is impracticable On the contrary convinced myself I wish them ever to believe that whenever they please to claim they  will  and  must  have the  full extent of their Rights  I have thought necessary to say thus much on an impression I cannot think indifferent the public should entertain  The measure for which you are assembled meets with my hearty concurrence and I shall be happy if these my sentiments which I beg you would communi∣cate to the meeting of the county of Sussex should meet with their approbation  It is with the highest esteem and regard that I have the honour to be SIR Your most obedient and humble servant RICHMOND c  To  Wm Frankland  esq High Sheriff of the county of Sussex  ANECDOTE of JOHN THE GREAT DUKE OF ARGYLE  Captain Hull of the horsegrenadiers waiting one morning on the Duke about business was shewn into a large room where he found his Grace walking about pensively and so lost in thought that at first he took no notice of Hull but soon after turning his eyes that way apologized for not seeing him sooner on which Captain Hull answered "He feared he had interrupted his Grace's thoughts about something of more conse∣quence than his business" for the Duke was a real pa∣triot virtuous wise and valiant "Not to you and me Hull" says the Duke "however I'll tell you what I was thinking of I was considering what will be the consequence fifty years  of the bad education of six parts out of seven of our young nobility They are brought up with a little superficial learning introduced early into company pleasure and dissipation of all sorts then sent to travel before they know any thing of their own country or mankind and the part they ought to act as men abroad they are flattered duped and laugh∣ed at and return home corrupted both in head and heart While they are thus employed all the useful sense learn∣ing and knowledge will be possessed by the middling class of people who must of course despise a luxurious idle gaming nobility And as time and accidents will widen the breach between them unless Providence gra∣ciously interferes confusion in the end must follow for the idlers will be for arbitrary power that they may act the tyrant over their inferiors not considering by this step they are slaves themselves and have given up the great∣est blessings in life But the men of learning and Science will list under Liberty knowing men are by Nature equal and that all power is delegated from the people for their protection and security and from hence con∣vulsions may arise which scarce you or I will live to see"  Vide  The Weekly Miscellany for Feb  The following copy of his commitment is here printed in order to convince the public that he has been guilty of no other crime than what is
