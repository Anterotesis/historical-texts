need of letters Wherefore should we spell  Why write our names A mark will do as well  Much are the precious hours of youth mispent  In climbing Learning's rugged steep ascent  When to the top the bold advent'rer's got  He reigns vain monarch o'er a barren spot  Whilst in the  vale  of  Ignorance  below  FOLLY and VICE to rank luxuriance grow  Honours and wealth pour in on ev'ry side  And proud Preferment rolls her golden tide  O'er crabbed authors life's gay prime to waste  To cramp wild genius in the chains of taste  To bear the slavish drudgery of schools  And tamely stoop to ev'ry pedant's rules  For seven long years debarr'd of lib'ral ease  To plod in college trammels to  degrees  Beneath the weight of solemn toys to groan  Sleep over books and leave mankind unknown  To praise each senior blockhead's threadbare tale  And laugh till reason blush and spirits fail  Manhood with vile submission to disgrace  And  cap  the fool whose merit is his Place  VICE CHANCELLORS whose knowledge is but small  And CHANCELLORS who nothing know at all  Illbrook'd the gen'rous Spirit in those days  When Learning was the certain road to praise  When Nobles with a love of Science bless'd  Approv'd in others what themselves possess'd  But  Now  when DULLNESS rears aloft her throne  When LORDLY Vassals her wide Empire own  When Wit seduc'd by Envy starts aside  And basely leagues with Ignorance and Pride  What  Now  should tempt us by false hopes misled  Learning's unfashionable paths to tread  To bear those labours which our Fathers bore  That Crown withheld which They in triumph wore  When with much pains this boasted Learning's got  'Tis an affront to those who have it not  In some it causes hate in others fear  Instructs our Foes to rail our Friends to sneer  With prudent haste the worldlyminded fool  Forgets the little which he learn'd at School  The Elder Brother to vast fortunes born  Looks on all Science with an Eye of Scorn  Dependent Breth'ren the same features wear  And younger Sons are stupid as the Heir  In Senates at the Bar in Church and State  Genius is vile and Learning out of date  Is thisO Death to think is this the Land  Where Merit and Reward went hand in hand  Where Heroes Parentlike the Poet view'd  By whom they saw their glorious deeds renew'd  Where Poets true to Honour tun'd their lays  And by their Patrons sanctify'd their praise  Is this the Land where on our SPENCER'S tongue  Enamour'd of his voice Description hung  Where JOHNSON rigid gravity beguil'd  Whilst Reason thro' her Critic fences smil'd  Where NATURE list'ning stood whilst SHAKESPEAR play'd  And wonder'd at the Work herself had made  Is this the Land where mindful of her charge  And Office high fair Freedom walk'd at large  Where finding in our Laws a sure defence  She mock'd at all restraints but those of Sense  Where health and honour trooping by her side  She spread her sacred empire far and wide  Pointed the Way Affliction to beguile  And bade the Face of Sorrow wear a smile  Bade those who dare obey the gen'rous call  Enjoy her blessings which GOD meant for all  Is this the Land where in some Tyrant's reign  When a  weak wicked Ministerial  train  The tools of pow'r the slaves of int'rest plann'd  Their Country's ruin and with bribes unman'd  Those wretches who ordain'd in Freedom's cause  Gave up our liberties and sold our laws  When Pow'r was taught by Meanness where to go  Nor dar'd to love the Virtue of a foe  When like a lep'rous plague from the foul head  To the foul heart her sores Corruption spread  Her iron arm when stern Oppression rear'd  And Virtue from her broad base shaken fear'd  The scourge of Vice when impotent and vain  Poor Freedom bow'd the neck to Slav'ry's chain  Is this the Land where in those worst of times  The hardy Poet rais'd his honest rimes  To dread rebuke and bade controulment speak  In guilty blushes on the villain's cheek  Bade Pow'r turn pale kept mighty rogues in awe  And made them fear the Muse who fear'd not Law  How do I laugh when men of narrow souls  Whom folly guides and prejudice controuls  Who one dull drowsy track of business trod  Worship their Mammon and neglect their God  Who breathing by one musty set of rules  Dote from the birth and are by system fools  Who form'd to dullness from their very youth  Lies of the day prefer to Gospel truth  Pick up their little knowledge from Reviews  And lay out all their stock of faith in news  How do I laugh when Creatures form'd like these  Whom Reason scorns and I should blush to please  Rail at all lib'ral arts deem verse a crime  And hold not Truth as Truth if told in rime  How do I laugh when PUBLIUS hoary grown  In zeal for SCOTLAND'S wellfare and his own  By slow degrees and course of office drawn  In mood and figure at the helm to yawn  Too mean the worst of curses Heav'n can send  To have a foe too proud to have a friend  Erring by form which Blockheads sacred hold  Ne'er making new faults and ne'er mending old  Rebukes my Spirit bids the daring Muse  Subjects more equal to her weakness chuse  Bids her frequent the haunts of humble swains  Nor dare to traffick in ambitious strains  Bids her indulging the poetic whim  In quaintwrought Ode or Sonnet pertly trim  Along the Churchway path complain with GRAY  Or dance with MASON on the first of May  "All sacred is the name and pow'r of Kings  "All States and Statesmen are those mighty Things  "Which howsoe'er they out of course may roll  "Were never made for Poets to controul"  Peace Peace thou Dotard nor thus vilely deem  Of Sacred Numbers and their pow'r blaspheme  I tell thee Wretch search all Creation round  In Earth in Heav'n no Subject can be found  Our God alone except above whose weight  The Poet cannot rise and hold his State  The blessed Saints above in numbers speak  The praise of God tho' there all praise is weak  In Numbers here below the Bard shall teach  Virtue to soar beyond the Villain's reach  Shall tear his lab'ring lungs strain his hoarse throat  And raise his voice beyond the trumpet's note  Should an afflicted Country aw'd by men  Of slavish principles demand his pen  This is a great a glorious point of view  Fit for an English Poet to pursue  Undaunted to pursue tho' in return  His writings by the common Hangman burn  How do I laugh when men by fortune plac'd  Above their Betters and by rank disgrac'd  Who found their pride on titles which they stain  And mean themselves are of their Fathers vain  Who would a bill of privilege prefer  And treat a Poet like a Creditor  The gen'rous ardour of the Muse condemn  And curse the storm they know must break on them  "What shall a reptile Bard a wretch unknown  "Without one badge of merit but his own  "Great Nobles lash and  Lords  like common men  "Smart from the vengeance of a Scribbler's pen"  What's in this name of  Lord  that we should fear  To bring their vices to the public ear  Flows not the honest blood of humble swains  Quick as the tide which swells a Monarch's veins  Monarchs who wealth and titles can bestow  Cannot make Virtues in succession flow  Would'st Thou Proud Man be safely plac'd above  The censure of the Muse deserve her Love  Act as thy Birth demands as Nobles ought  Look back and by thy worthy Father taught  Who  earn'd  those Honours Thou wert  born  to wear  Follow his steps and be his Virtue's heir  But if regardless of the road to Fame  You start aside and tread the paths of shame  If such thy life that should thy Sire arise  The sight of such a Son would blast his eyes  Would make him curse the hour which gave Thee birth  Would drive him shudd'ring from the face of earth  Once more with shame and sorrow 'mongst the dead  In endless night to hide his rev'rend head  If such thy life tho' Kings had made thee more  Than ever King a scoundrel made before  Nay to allow thy pride a deeper spring  Tho' God in vengeance had made Thee a King  Taking on Virtue's wing her daring flight  The Muse should drag thee trembling to the light  Probe thy foul wounds and lay thy bosom bare  To the keen question of the searching air  Gods with what pride I see the titled slave  Who smarts beneath the stroke which Satire gave  Aiming at ease and with dishonest art  Striving to hide the feelings of his heart  How do I laugh when with affected air  Scarce able thro' despite to keep his chair  Whilst on his trembling lip pale anger speaks  And the chaf'd blood flies mounting to his cheeks  He talks of Conscience which good men secures  From all those evil moments guilt endures  And seems to laugh at those who pay regard  To the wild ravings of a frantic bard  "SATIRE whilst envy and illhumour sway  "The mind of man must always make her way  "Nor to a bosom with discretion fraught  "Is all her malice worth a single thought  "The Wise have not the will nor Fools the pow'r  "To stop her headstrong course within the hour  "Left to herself she dies opposing Strife  "Gives her fresh vigour and prolongs her life  "All things her prey and ev'ry man her aim  "I can no patent for exemption claim  "Nor would I wish to stop that harmless dart  "Which plays around but cannot wound my heart  "Tho' pointed at myself be SATIRE free  "To Her 'tis pleasure and no pain to Me"  Dissembling Wretch hence to the Stoic school  And there amongst thy breth'ren play the fool  There unrebuk'd these wild vain doctrines preach  Lives there a Man whom SATIRE cannot reach  Lives there a Man who calmly can stand by  And see his conscience ripp'd with steady eye  When SATIRE flies abroad on Falshood's wing  Short is her life indeed and dull her sting  But when to Truth allied the wound she gives  Sinks deep and to remotest ages lives  When in the tomb thy pamper'd flesh shall rot  And e'en by friends thy mem'ry be forgot  Still shalt Thou live recorded for thy crimes  Live in her page and stink to aftertimes  Hast Thou no feeling yet Come throw off pride  And own those passions which Thou shalt not hide  S who from the moment of his birth  Made human Nature a reproach on earth  Who never dar'd nor wish'd behind to stay  When Folly Vice and Meanness led the way  Would blush should he be told by Truth and Wit  Those actions which he blush'd not to commit  Men the most infamous are fond of fame  And those who fear not guilt yet start at shame  But whither runs my zeal whose rapid force  Turning the brain bears Reason from her course  Carries me back to times when Poets bless'd  With courage grac'd the Science they profess'd  When They in Honour rooted firmly stood  The bad to punish and reward the good  When to a flame by Public Virtue wrought  The foes of Feedom They to justice brought  And dar'd expose those slaves who dar'd support  A Tyrant plan and call'd themselves a Court  Ah What are Poets now as slavish those  Who deal in Verse as those who deal in Prose  Is there an Author search the Kingdom round  In whom true worth and real Spirit's found  The Slaves of Booksellers or doom'd by Fate  To baser chains vile pensioners of State  Some dead to shame and of those shackles proud  Which Honour scorns for slav'ry roar aloud  Others  halfpalsied  only mutes become  And what makes SMOLLET write makes JOHNSON dumb  Why turns you villain pale why bends his eye  Inward abash'd when MURPHY passes by  Dost Thou sage MURPHY for a blockhead take  Who wages war with vice for Virtue's sake  No Nolike other  Worldlings  you will find  He shifts his sails and catches ev'ry wind  His soul the shock of int'rest can't endure  Give him a pension then and sin secure  With laurell'd wreaths the flatt'rer's brows adorn  Bid Virtue crouch bid Vice exalt her horn  Bid Cowards thrive put honesty to flight  MURPHY shall prove or try to prove it right  Try thou StateJuggler ev'ry paltry art  Ransack the inmost closet of my heart  Swear Thou'rt my Friend by that base oath make way  Into my breast and flatter to betray  Or if those tricks are vain if wholesome doubt  Detects the fraud and points the Villain out  Bribe those who daily at my board are fed  And make them take my life who eat my bread  On Authors for defence for praise depend  Pay him but well and MURPHY is thy friend  He He shall ready stand with venal rimes  To varnish guilt and consecrate thy crimes  To make corruption in false colours shine  And damn his own good name to rescue thine  But if thy niggard hands their gifts withhold  And Vice no longer rains down show'rs of gold  Expect no mercy facts well grounded teach  MURPHY if not rewarded will impeach  What tho' each man of nice and juster thought  Shunning his steps decrees by Honour taught  He ne'er can be a Friend who stoops so low  To be the base betrayer of a foe  What tho' with thine together link'd his name  Must be with thine transmitted down to shame  To ev'ry manly feeling callous grown  Rather than not blast thine he'll blast his own  To ope the fountain whence Sedition springs  To slander Government and libel Kings  With Freedom's name to serve a present hour  Tho' born and bred to arbitrary pow'r  To talk of WILLIAMS with insidious art  Whilst a vile STUART'S lurking in his heart  And whilst mean Envy rears her loathsome head  Flatt'ring the living to abuse the dead  Where is SHEBBEARE O let not foul reproach  Travelling thither in a CityCoach  The Pill'ry dare to name the whole intent  Of that Parade was Fame not Punishment  And that old staunch Whig BEARDMORE standing by  Can in full Court give that report the lye  With rude unnat'ral jargon to support  Half  Scotch  half  English  a declining Court  To make most glaring contraries unite  And prove beyond dispute that black is white  To make firm Honour tamely league with shame  Make Vice and Virtue differ but in name  To prove that Chains and Freedom are but one  That to be sav'd must mean to be undone  Is there not GUTHRIE Who like him can call  All Opposites to proof and conquer all  He calls forth living waters from the rock  He calls forth children from the barren stock  He far beyond the springs of Nature led  Makes Women bring forth after they are dead  He on a curious new and happy plan  In  Wedlock  's sacred bands joins Man to Man  And to complete the whole most strange but true  By some rare magic makes them fruitful too  Whilst from their loins in the due course of years  Flows the rich blood of GUTHRIE's  English Peers  Dost Thou contrive some blacker deed of shame  Something which Nature shudders but to name  Something which makes the Soul of man retreat  And the lifeblood run backward to her seat  Dost Thou contrive for some base private end  Some selfish view to hang a trusting friend  To lure him on e'en to his parting breath  And promise life to work him surer death  Grown old in villainy and dead to grace  Hell in his heart and TYBURNE in his face  Behold a Parson at thy Elbow stands  Low'ring damnation and with open hands  Ripe to betray his Saviour for reward  The Atheist Chaplain of an Atheist Lord  Bred to the Church and for the gown decreed  'Ere it was known that I should learn to read  Tho' that was nothing for my Friends who knew  What mighty Dullness of itself could do  Never design'd me for a working Priest  But hop'd I should have been a DEAN at least  Condemn'd like many more and worthier men  To whom I pledge the service of my pen  Condemn'd whilst proud and pamper'd Sons of Lawn  Cramm'd to the throat in lazy plenty yawn  In pomp of  rev'rend begg'ry  to appear  To pray and starve on forty pounds a year  My Friends who never felt the galling load  Lament that I forsook the Packhorse road  Whilst Virtue to my conduct witness bears  In throwing off that gown which FRANCIS wears  What Creature's that so very pert and prim  So very full of foppery and whim  So gentle yet so brisk so wond'rous sweet  So fit to prattle at a Lady's feet  Who looks as he the Lord's rich vineyard trod  And by his Garb appears a man of God  Trust not to looks nor credit outward show  The villain lurks beneath the  cassock'd  Beau  That's an Informer what avails the name  Suffice it that the wretch from SODOM came  His tongue is deadlyfrom his presence run  Unless thy rage would wish to be undone  No ties can hold him no affection bind  And Fear alone restrains his coward mind  Free him from that no Monster is so fell  Nor is so sure a bloodhound found in hell  His silken smiles his hypocritic air  His meek demeanour plausible and fair  Are only worn to pave Fraud's easier way  And make gull'd Virtue fall a surer prey  Attend his Churchhis plan of doctrine view  The Preacher is a Christian dull but true  But when the hallow'd hour of preaching's o'er  That plan of doctrine's never thought of more  CHRIST is laid by neglected on the shelf  And the vile Priest is Gospel to himself  By CLELAND tutor'd and with BLACOW bred  BLACOW whom by a brave resentment led  OXFORD if OXFORD had not sunk in same  Ere this had damn'd to everlasting shame  Their steps he follows and their crimes partakes  To Virtue lost to Vice alone he wakes  Most lusciously declaims 'gainst luscious themes  And whilst he rails at blasphemy blasphemes  Are these the Arts which Policy supplies  Are these the steps by which grave Churchmen rise  Forbid it Heav'n or should it turn out so  Let Me and Mine continue mean and low  Such be their Arts whom Interest controuls  KIDGELL and  I  have free and honest souls  We scorn Preferment which is gain'd by Sin  And will tho' poor without have peace within  THE END
