and rings and snuff boxes and silver sleeve buttons  st PRISONER  Indeed good Chellingoe we have already given them all up to you  CHELLINGOE  'Tis falseYou conceal your riches ungrateful wretches as ye are after my kindness to you You  would all have been strangled yesterday if I had not suspected you had concealed wealth about you  st PRISONER  We acknowledge your goodness in getting us a respite  CHELLINGOE  Oh ye do do ye Yes I interested the clemency of his highness the RajahHe has graciously permitted you to live to make a full disclosure of your property But what will all your

generous sentiments revive in ye and as your reward you shall see your commander presently  Makes a sign to the GUARDS at a distance then unlocks one of the prison doors from whence enter SIDNEY who comes forward  SONG  SIDNEY  Oft wealth or ambition will tempt us to dare  All the toils all the perils that mortals can bear  But the sigh of remembrance wherever we roam  Will fancy waft back to our dear native home  Tho' rude be the clime and tho' humble the cot  The early idea is never forgot  And the sigh c  CHELLINGOE  This is the hour when the Princess Alminah usually walks this way  SIDNEY goes back into his prison  Locks the door  She has had interviews with my prisoner the young English officer and is certainly in love with him If so I must shew him favour  Now how to turn this to my own advantage  To an ATTENDANT  Send hither that female prisoner in male attire whom they call Margaretthat virago who is confined apart from the rest She may give me the information I want  MARGARET  without  Where is Chellingoe Shew the way sirrah Ordinary timemarch  Enter MARGARET drest as a Soldier preceded by a SLAVE  CHELLINGOE  There is no taming that vixen  MARGARET  to the SLAVE  To the

a prisoner of war Was I not honorably fighting the battles of my country How dare you treat a female British volunteer in this manner taken fighting by the side of her husband  CHELLINGOE  And is there really any poor fellow in existence so unfortunate as to be your husband  MARGARET  Sir I have the honor to be a serjeant's ladyNay more he is a serjeant of grenadiers and an IrishmanNeed I add that he is a man of courage  CHELLINGOE  No you need nothis courage cannot be doubted if he has been bold enough to venture on you  MARGARET  I followed the example of my dear mistress the wife of your prisoner Captain Sidney In contempt of every danger she accompanied him on this expedition For convenience we assumed male attire My mistress indeed chose to be habited like an Indian servant but for my part I always had a partiality for wearing the breeches  CHELLINGOE  Retirethe Princess is here  CHELLINGOE and MARGARET retire severally at a sign made to CHELLINGOE by ORSANA who enters with ALMINAH  ALMINAH  Orsana are we observed  ORSANA  No madamChellingoe understands how to take a hint There is Sidney's window  ALMINAH  How provoking that he does not appear  ORSANA  Madam here is Chellingoe who guards the captives  ALMINAH  Bid him approach  CHELLINGOE comes forward from a cell  The English captives are still in your care  CHELLINGOE  Yes madam  ALMINAH  I hope you treat the brave men with humanity  CHELLINGOE  With the utmost tenderness  ALMINAH  The honor of our nation requires that we shou'd respect the virtues of an enemy  CHELLINGOE  Very true madam so I have said  ALMINAH  Especially when unfortunatepoor wretches how I pity them At a distance from their native countryseparated from all they hold dear in friendship in love  CHELLINGOE  Alas madam these considerations have but too painfully touch'd my heart  ALMINAH  I hope so for remember your life must answer for their ill treatment Mark me Chellingoeif any one should die while in your keeping a most strict account of the cause will be required  CHELLINGOE  I live but to obey your illustrious family  ORSANA  Her Highness is curious to converse with their commander  CHELLINGOE  I will prepare him for the honor  ALMINAH  I will still conceal my rank from this captive that awe may not restrain him from gratifying my inquiries let him attend me on the terrace  Exit CHELLINGOE into a cell  How my heart beats Govinda your friendship must assist me in this interview  GOVINDA  Illustrious princess  ALMINAH  Oh Govinda this illustrious princess as you call her the favorite daughter of a powerful monarch surrounded by her guards in a palace where her word is fatethis mighty princess is in love and no more than a poor timid woman trembling with apprehension at an interview with a captive stranger  Exit ALMINAH and ORSANA  GOVINDA  alone  Yes Alminah I will fulfil your commands at the risk of my life You have claims on my gratitude which must be obeyed  SONG  GOVINDA  How lost the mind which cold and dark  From Gratitude's celestial fire  In vain receives the hallowed spark  Falling alas but to expire  Oft be my fervent vows renew'd  At the shrine of Gratitude  Honor abhors the darksome cell  Unbless'd by Gratitude's bright flame  There pale distrust and treachery dwell  There fraud asserts her wily claim  Oft be my fervent vows renew'd  At the shrine of Gratitude  Exit  Enter CHELLINGOE and SIDNEY from the cell  CHELLINGOE  You are permitted to walk on this terraceI have no orders to this effect but the indulgence is mine entirely my grace and favour and I hope you will be grateful  SIDNEY  Behold the angels of pity who have so kindly sought to soothe my grief  Enter ALMINAH and ORSANA  GOVINDA  coming forward  Gallant stranger the hour approaches when your chains shall be removed  SIDNEY  Astonishment my chains removed by whom  ALMINAH  By meoft have I listened to the melancholy sounds which gave vent to your sorrows till my heart vibrated in unison  raising her veil  SIDNEY  Charming creature But how is it possible  ALMINAH  Be content to know the extent of my power without questioning the means enquire no further At midnight Govinda shall come to you in your prisonhe can remove every obstacle to your releasefollow him in silencehe will conduct you to me and we will fly together  QUARTETTE  ALMINAH ORSANA GOVINDA and SIDNEY  SIDNEY  Grateful thus humbly bending  My thanks deign to receive  ALMINAH  Me in return defending  My freedom you achieve  ORSANA  Then at the silent midnight hour  When the tiger prowls for prey  GOVINDA  Fearless of all but slavery's power  The moon shall light us on our way  Exeunt ALMINAH ORSANA and GOVINDA  SIDNEY reenters his prison CHELLINGOE locks the door after him and comes forward  CHELLINGOE  This flirtation of the princess may be turned to good account 'Tis fortunate to be in office when our superiors fall in lovea wise man may always profit by it  To MARGARET who comes forward  Why don't you retire Go back to your prison  MARGARET  Be calmbe contentedI will not go back to my prison till I think proper  CHELLINGOE  What am I to be braved thus Retire instantly or  MARGARET  You had better notI may possibly be hurt in the scuffle perhaps mortally hurtand if I shou'd die  CHELLINGOE  Well  MARGARET  Why then you know as the Princess told you your life must answer for it  CHELLINGOE  How unfortunate that she should overhear the conversation  MARGARET  Don't provoke me or I will certainly attempt something dangerousHow do you know that a mine is not now ready to spring under you  CHELLINGOE  Will you please to retire  MARGARET  For aught you know you may have taken poison at your last meal  CHELLINGOE  I wish she was out of the prison with all my soul  MARGARET  Or should that fail I might poison myself and swear you did it  CHELLINGOE  Aside  I shall not think myself safe till this vixen is disposed of A thought strikes me  to her  I tell you whatyou are a brave wench and ought not to remain in confinement  MARGARET  I agree with you for the first time  CHELLINGOE  Have you a mind to escape  MARGARET  You wish to get rid of me  CHELLINGOE  I should have no objection  MARGARET  And suppose I should be inclined to indulge you so far what do you offer me  CHELLINGOE  Why I offer you your freedom What more would you have  MARGARET  I would have the rupees you stolemy property  CHELLINGOE  How unconscionable When I give you liberty  MARGARET  True but liberty and property should not be separatedso if you refuse  talking loud    CHELLINGOE  Hush the Princess may overhear us  MARGARET  I mean it I will proclaim your villanies and demand justice  CHELLINGOE  Don't talk so loud You shall escape on your own terms if you will but go quietly Zemaun  Enter ZEMAUN  I commit this prisoner to your care  Whispers ZEMAUN  MARGARET  Aside  That Zemaun is a proud ferocious fellow the terror of all the prisoners and famed for his implacable hatred to Europeans Yet surely Chellingoe dares not play me a trick  CHELLINGOE  Aside to ZEMAUN  If destroyed beyond the bounds of the prison you know it is no fault of mine  To MARGARET  Adieu my friend Zemaun will take care of you Early in the morning follow him in silence  MARGARET  To ZEMAUN  Lead onI'll follow you  Exit ZEMAUN  But first my friend Chellingoe I must have my money  DUET  CHELLINGOE and MARGARET  MARGARET  What do you think I'll be robb'd of my money  CHELLINGOE  Your liberty  MARGARET  Without my cash I value not a rush  CHELLINGOE  Trust to my honor  MARGARET  In vain you give your honey  I'll tell aloud your villany  CHELLINGOE  Hush Hush Hush  CHELLINGOE  Here take your money and now let's say good b'ye  MARGARET  Not yet awhile my purse is low and yours in cash is flush  Now as they say all have their price  CHELLINGOE  Faith your's is much too high  And I'll not bribe a vile informer  MARGARET  Hush Hush Hush  CHELLINGOE  Zounds I'll give no more and so your course pursue  MARGARET  Shake handsa quarrel now your hopes as well as mine would crush  CHELLINGOE  To prison you would go again  MARGARET  And what becomes of you  CHELLINGOE aside  The devil take ye  MARGARET  What do you say  CHELLINGOE  Hush Hush Hush  MARGARET aside  The devil take ye  CHELLINGOE  What do you say  MARGARET  Hush Hush Hush  Exeunt  SCENE II  A Plain with a distant View of the RAJAH's HillFort  Enter LIFFEY from a Wood  LIFFEY  Oh Liffey Barney Liffey What an unhappy serjeant of grenadiers art thou An Irishman by birth and a soldier by choice I who never turned my back upon an enemyno nor a friend whether man or womanthat it shou'd be my fate to play at bopeep in a thicket like a hunted tyger But how can I help it With such a charge committed to my care such an innocent sweet creature whom I have pledged my honor to protectAnd then to leave my wife my dear Margaret behind methere is another misfortunate for though we constantly quarrel when we meet I always find a violent affection for her when she is absent Indeed I think we agree best at a distance The moment the parson made us one we became two and indeed we have not been much together since we were united  ELIZA  without  Liffey Where are you  LIFFEY  Here my good Lady This way Madam you may venture to peep out of your hidingplace  Enter ELIZA in male attire  ELIZA  After passing two tedious days in that gloomy forest how delightful is the open air This change of prospectOh Liffey can that be the prison of my husband  LIFFEY  It is that is Ramah Droog Fortress that is my master Captain Sidney's prison Oh I shall never forget this valley Here our detachment was surroundedhere some brave fellows fell and all the rest were taken prisonersexcept myselfNo noI was not amongst the slain nor was I taken prisoner Oh I shall never forget how the black rascals came pouring down upon us on every side when my master turned to me suddenly  "Liffey"  said he  "all is lostMake your escape as fast as possibleRun away with my wife I entreat you"  And then you know ma'am  ELIZA  I know not what passed At the sight of my Sidney's danger my boasted courage forsook me  LIFFEY  "Run away Sir"  cried I  "Alas poor Liffey never disobeyed your orders before but it is impossible to run awayUpon my soul I can't turn my back upon an enemyI can't muster up courage to do it"  ELIZA  But you could not disobey your master  LIFFEY  That is my only consolation for behaving like a coward  "Leave me my good fellow if you have any friendship for me"  said he By my honor thought I that seems to be an odd way of shewing friendship though not unusual to desert a friend when he stands most in need of assistance  ELIZA  Who are those men armed with spears and javelins  LIFFEY  Tiger hunters madam beating among the jungle in search of the gameA thought strikes me and yet  ELIZA  Your fidelity entitles you to my attention What would you propose  LIFFEY  Why look ye madam We are two hundred miles from the British settlement and our whole stock of provisions is one poor little solitary potatoe in the corner of my knapsack  ELIZA  Good heavens Liffey did you not tell me that you had rice enough for a week  LIFFEY  So I thought till I looked into the bag just now and i'faith I find instead of a bag of rice I had in my hurry carried off a full suit of clothes belonging to old Sampan our commissary's clerk  ELIZA  Well proceed  LIFFEY  That is what I cannot do I cannot proceed and therefore I think the wisest way is to stay where we are and yield ourselves prisoners to these tiger hunters  ELIZA  If you are known to be a soldier you will be either imprisoned or obliged to enlist in their service What is to be done Can you pass for a musician  LIFFEY  Madamto be sure I can sing a little but I could never turn a tune in my life even on the jew's harp  ELIZA  Is there no situation in which you could be useful to an Indian Prince  LIFFEY  Why yes I think I cou'd take care of his wives but I'm afraid they won't trust me to do that  ELIZA  I have heard that the character most respected throughout the East is that of an European physician  LIFFEY  And would you have me pretend to be a doctor  ELIZA  We can think of no better scheme and I shall be secure in passing for your servant You may easily conceal your ignorance I dare say they never had an European physician among them  LIFFEY  Most likely not for they seem to be a hale hearty set of people  ELIZA  But then these regimentals  LIFFEY  Suppose madam I change them for old Sampan's suit of clothes  ELIZA  A lucky thought  LIFFEY  And by my soul I shall then be a curiosity worth your seeing  Exit  ELIZA  Yes my beloved Sidney I shall once more rejoin thee and share thy fateperhaps effect thy rescue  SONG  ELIZA  With trembling steps and sinking heart  I urge my weary way  At every whispering breeze I start  All terror and dismay  Still Hope with magic mirror tries  My sinking heart to cheer  And points where smiling prospects rise  Of many a circling year  Or when the sandy desart bright  Reflects the burning noon  Or when the chilling damps of night  Arise and dim the moon  Still Hope c  Reenter LIFFEY drest in the clothes he has mentioned  LIFFEY  Here I am madamWhat d'ye think of me  A bugle horn sounds  ELIZA  Hark the hunters approach Now remember I am to pass for your servant  LIFFEY  Then in token of servitude carry the knapsackyou'll not find it very heavy There is nothing in it but the poor little potatoe that has travelled with us so far  ELIZA  Now be very careful how you answer their questions They are here Why do you loiter thus Liffey  LIFFEY  I was only admiring myself madam How lucky it is that I blundered upon this suit of clothesI could not have made a more fortunate mistake had it even been on purpose  Exeunt  SCENE IV  A View in the Fort the same as the first Scene  Enter CHELLINGOE  CHELLINGOE  His Highness the great Rajah taken ill suddenly illviolently illand a suspicion of poison His doctors disagree as usual so between the malady and the medicine he'll give us the slip What a blow to my hopes what a check to my rising ambition My former disgrace forgotworming myself into favour further and further every day and now to lose the fruits of my toils  Enter an ATTENDANT  ATTENDANT  Some more European prisoners are brought in Will you please to examine them  CHELLINGOE  NoI'm not in a humour to examine prisonersThe Rajah will certainly die What with the doctors and the disease his constitution will be knock'd about like a shuttlecock between battledores till the parties grow tired of the contention and he falls to the ground  ATTENDANT  Will you please to have the Europeans closely confined in the dungeon or in the castle  CHELLINGOE  Are they rich  ATTENDANT  I don't knowwe have not examined them  CHELLINGOE  Right Always leave that to me  ATTENDANT  One of them says he is a physician  CHELLINGOE  A physician and from Europe I'll send him to the RajahBring him in directly  Exit ATTENDANT  If his Highness should be cured by a doctor of my recommendation what a brilliant career of honors and dignities will open to meThen if the European shou'd kill himBut I'll make it his interest not to kill him Aye but if he should give too strong a dose by mistake No matter I dare say the doctor knows enough of his profession to keep that a secret from everybody  Reenter ATTENDANT and converses aside with CHELLINGOE  Enter LIFFEY and ELIZA as prisoners  ELIZA  My husband yet living and a prisoner in the tower Oh Liffey my heart beats high with expectation  LIFFEY  Oh madam and my heart sinks low with disappointment No intelligence to be gained of poor Margaret whether living or dead It wou'd be a comfort to be ascertained of the fact either way But she is certainly no more were she alive her tongue wou'd proclaim the circumstance to the whole prison  CHELLINGOE  coming forward  This must be the doctor Loosen his chains never fetter the hands of geniusYou are luckily arrived and in good time  LIFFEY  I hope it will prove so your Honor  CHELLINGOE  I am told you are a physician  LIFFEY  I am glad you are told so for I am not fond of speaking of myself  CHELLINGOE  How did it happen that you came into the territories of the great Rajah  LIFFEY  I have always been partial to travellingtravelling for improvement Hearing you had a battle in the neighbourhood I came to offer my assistance  CHELLINGOE  Well and discreetly answered May I ask if you are eminent in your profession  LIFFEY  You may ask it but my modesty won't let me give you an answer  CHELLINGOE  You seem to enjoy strong health yourself a hopeful object for a sick person to look on  LIFFEY  Enjoy my healthno wonderI never tasted a drop of physic in my life  CHELLINGOE  Give me your handnow I know you are a true doctorthey are never so selfish as to deprive their patients of medicines by taking it themselves  To the Attendant  Remember that all possible respect must be shewn to this learned man and his follower May I crave your name  LIFFEY  My name is LiffeyDoctor O'Liffey  Apart to ELIZA  I shall tack the  O  to it nowit will give me more consequence  CHELLINGOE  Doctor O'Liffey your fortune is made I will patronize youI have wonderful influence at the court of the illustrious Rajah He is a great prince Did you ever hear his titles  LIFFEY  No your HonorI shou'd like to remember them  CHELLINGOE  He is the mighty Monarch the Mahah Rajah Surooj Seing that is the son of the lion brother to the sun and moon and cousin to all the stars in the firmament  LIFFEY  Then what blessed weather you must have in this country if he and his relations are on good terms together I suppose a foggy day or a dark night is a sure sign of a quarrel in the family  CHELLINGOE  He is the immortal and allpowerful Rajah who when he has dined gives leave to all the princes of the earth to go to dinner  LIFFEY  How gracious and condescending If they are as hungry as I am they must feel it to be a singular favor  CHELLINGOE  Now as I told you I am a favorite at courtI can introduce you to be one of the state physicians  LIFFEY  Is his Highness indisposed  CHELLINGOE  Yes the immortal Rajah  LIFFEY  Is going to die I suppose  CHELLINGOE  I hope not But this allpowerful potentate  LIFFEY  Is in a very weak condition  CHELLINGOE  You shall attend his Highness and judge of his malady by the symptoms  ELIZA  That is totally unnecessary Sir My master can prescribe just as well without seeing the patient He has one sovereign remedy upon which he depends  CHELLINGOE  A nostrum He is a desperate fellowkill or cure I perceive  GOVINDA enters and speaks to CHELLINGOE apart  LIFFEY  apart  I say madamWho the devil do you mean What have I to prescribe  ELIZA  Anything will answer the purpose  LIFFEY  Will it  ELIZA  Yes provided the remedy is not known here  LIFFEY  Then what say you to the little potatoe in my knapsack 'Tis a sovereign remedy that saves the lives of thousands every day in my country  ELIZA  An excellent idea Liffey  CHELLINGOE  coming forward  The princess Alminah is gone to offer her devotions at the mosque for the recovery of his Highnessshe will return this way and must not find us here Let us be alert and shew our zealDoctor we have no time to lose  LIFFEY  I am with youI'll prepare this famous medicine

my want of confidence Besides the worst come to the worst I suppose it is  "No cure no pay"  ATTENDANT  Nothat is not the worst for if his Highness should unfortunately die under your care his decease will be imputed to the medicine and you will be trampled to death by elephants agreeably to the custom in these cases  LIFFEY  Oh miserable soul that I am  ELIZA  But see my dear Sidney appears  Enter GOVINDA and SIDNEY from the Prison  GOVINDA  Yes your deliverer is the Princess Alminah  SIDNEY  Distraction a fearful light breaks in upon me  GOVINDA  She will no longer conceal her rank from you and I shall have the felicity of giving liberty to a brave soldier  Exit  LIFFEY goes to SIDNEY makes himself known to him then points to ELIZA  SIDNEY  exclaims  Oh my Eliza  LIFFEY prevents him from

shall its power own  Boldly venture all will be well  Success is marr'd by fear alone  LIFFEY  My courage is lost in this curst flusteration  Wherever I turn me 'tis all botheration  CHELLINGOE  If fair words won't do  Then other means I must pursue  LIFFEY  Stay but a minute Ah what shall I do  ELIZA and SIDNEY  Fixt by valor's c  CHELLINGOE and LIFFEY  Botheration I'm ruin'dI know it too well

thousand doubts affrighting  Nameless fears all of fancy born  The eventful hour despair inviting  We trembling wait the approach of morn  Exeunt  THE END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The Battlements near SIDNEY's Prison  Enter ZEMAUN armed with his Spear followed by MARGARET  MARGARET  Zemaun what means this mysterious silence Whither would you lead me Surely we must have ascended very high on the rock so high that the sounds from the plain below are almost lost ere they reach us Speak Zemaun your eyes roll as if you revolved some fatal purpose Speak Zemaun  ZEMAUN raises his spear in a menacing attitude  Oh I am lost Chellingoe has deceived me Yet has he forgotten Alminah's commands Does he not remember that a prisoner found dead within these walls  ZEMAUN  But if beyond these wallsYou mark their height  Hurl'd from the craggy steep you'll seek a grave below  MARGARET  Alas for pity  ZEMAUN  Thou see'st thy life is in my power  Take it and in return be grateful  MARGARET  Generous Zemaun I shall ever remember my life is your gift and I will hold it in trust for your service  ZEMAUN  You think I am the fierce Zemaun  The barbarous slave of vile Chellingoe's cruelty  But you shall know me better  MARGARET  Then you are not Chellingoe's slave  ZEMAUN  No Heir to a distant throne as high in dignity  As any that proud Hindostan can boast  MARGARET  A prince  ZEMAUN  Three years the climes of Asia had I travers'd  To seek instruction from the varied volume  Where princes still will find their first best study  The heart of man  MARGARET  There is a companion to that volume which I suppose you did not forgetthe heart of woman  ZEMAUN  Jester you guess aright Hither I wander'd  Attracted by the charms which fame so lavish'd  Upon the princess Zelma  MARGARET  Zelma I have heard the guards sing ditties in her praise She was the daughter of the late Rajah Alas I know the fatal storyThe unfortunate monarch was destroyed and not one of his family survived to claim the throne  ZEMAUN  Yes one remainsThe lovely Zelma  MARGARET  The princess living  ZEMAUN  Starting from sleepawak'd by piercing cries  Scaring still night with horror and despair  I grasp'd my swordI found the palace throng'd  Through the assassin troops I forc'd my way  Moment of terror On my aching sight  Flash'd the dread picture of my Zelma's doom  A haughty Moor chief of the rebel host  High o'er her beauteous bosom aim'd the steel  MARGARET  Go on  ZEMAUN  Heaven nerv'd my arminstant he fell before me  MARGARET  And you saved her  ZEMAUN  Unknown unheeded through the busy throng  I brought my lovely prize in safety plac'd her  And still my watchful care preserves her life  MARGARET  Then Zelma lives in concealment  ZEMAUN  A female slave  Who fell a victim in that night of horrors  I caus'd to be entomb'd attired like Zelma  And boasted that my dagger bore her blood  This won me credit in the usurper's favor  And as my meed I gain'd the post of guarding  This prison where my life my soul resides  AGRA  without  Zemaun  MARGARET  I hear a voice  ZEMAUN  It is Zelma's faithful servant  AGRA  coming forward  Zemaun  ZEMAUN  Approach fear not my gentle Agra Until the evening  This friendly stranger must remain thy guest  Distant music is heard  MARGARET  What sounds are these  ZEMAUN  For sixteen years the hallow'd grove beneath  Has on this eve which gave my Zelma birth  Resounded with her praise  ZELMA comes forwardMARGARET retires  ZELMA  My Zemaun did'st thou listen to the strains  Of artless love Did'st thou hear the voice of pity  Lament thy Zelma number'd with the dead  Ah would it were so  ZEMAUN  No princess brighter prospects court your view  The strains of loyalty from yonder grove  Inspir'd by heaven are omens of success  ZELMA  They soothe my soul with their sweet mournful sound  As evening breezes close a happy day  Mingling regret with pleasure  ZEMAUN  The people ever faithful ever loyal  In secret mourn their monarch and their father  Let but the moment come when we may shew them  Zelma that monarch's darling and their idol  Then shall the awful energy of virtue  Hurl the usurper from his tottering throne  Exit  SONG  ZELMA  Happy were the days from infancy advancing  When by a parent's fostering power  My youthful mind its energies enhancing  Wak'd to new bliss expanding every hour  To the East when
