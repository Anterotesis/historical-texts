were going into their chariotand learned they were Mrs and Miss HARLOW From that moment she won my heart and at one glance I became the willing captive of her beauty  Mr HARLOW  A very candid declaration Sirhow can this be The bloom has been off the peach any time these fifteen years to my  knowlege  aside  You see my sister with a favourable eye Sir  CLERIMONT  A favourable eyeHe must greatly want discernment who has not a quick perception of her merit  Mr HARLOW  You do her a great deal of honourbut this affairis it not somewhat sudden Sir  CLERIMONT  I grant ityou may indeed be

whole family hold themselves much obliged to you  CLERIMONT  Madam this extreme condescension has added rapture to the sentiments I felt before  and it shall be the endeavour of my life to prove deserving of the amiable object I have dared to aspire to  Mrs HARLOW  Sir I make no doubt of your sincerityI have already declared my sentimentsyou know Mr Harlow'sand if my sister is willingnothing will be wanting to conclude this businessIf no difficulties arise from herfor her temper is uncertainas to my consent Sir your air your manner have commanded itSir your most obedientI'll send my sister to you  Exit  CLERIMONT  Madam  bowing  I shall endeavour to repay this goodness with excess of gratitudeOh she is an angeland yet stupid that I am I could not give vent to the tenderness I have withinit is ever so with sincere and generous love it fills the heart with rapture and then denies the power of uttering what we so exquisitely feelGenerous Miss Harlow who could thus see thro' my confusion interpret all appearances favourably and with a dignity superior to her sex's little arts forego the idle ceremonies of coquetting teazing and tormenting her admirerI hear somebodyOh here comes mistress Harlowwhat a gloom sits upon her featuresShe assumes authority here I findbut I'll endeavour by insinuation and respect  Enter Miss  HARLOW  Miss HARLOW  My sister has told me Sir  CLERIMONT  Ma'am  bowing chearfully  Miss HARLOW  He is a sweet figure  Aside  CLERIMONT  She rather looks like Miss Harlow's mother than her sisterinlaw  Aside  Miss HARLOW  He seems abashedhis respect is the cause  Aside  My sister told me Sir that you was hereI beg pardon for making you wait so long  CLERIMONT  Oh ma'am  bows  the gloom disappears from her face but the lines of illnature remain  Aside  Miss HARLOW  I see he loves me by his confusionI'll cheer him with affability  Aside  Sir the letter you was pleased to send my sister has seenand  CLERIMONT  And has assured me that she has no objection  Miss HARLOW  I am glad of that SirI was afraid  CLERIMONT  No ma'am she has noneand Mr Harlow I have seen him toohe has honoured me with his consentNow madam the only doubt remains with youmay I be permitted to hope  Miss HARLOW  Sir you appear like a gentlemanand  CLERIMONT  Madam believe me never was love more sincere more justly founded on esteem or kindled into higher admiration  Miss HARLOW  Sir with the rest of the family I hold myself much obliged to you and  CLERIMONT  Obliged'tis I that am obligedthere is no merit on my sideit is the consequence of impressions made upon my heart and what heart can resist such beauty such various graces  Miss HARLOW  Sir I am afraidI wish my sister heard him  aside  Sir I am afraid you are lavish of your praise and the short date of your love Sir  CLERIMONT  It will burn with unabating ardorthe same charms that first inspired it will for ever cherish it and add new fuelBut I  presume you hold this stile to try my sincerityI see that's your aimbut could you read the feelings of my heart you would not thus cruelly keep me in suspense  Miss HARLOW  Heavens if my sister saw my power over him  aside  A little suspense cannot be deemed unreasonableMarriage is an important affairan affair for lifeand some caution you will allow necessary  CLERIMONT  Madam  disconcerted  oh I dread the sourness of her look  Aside  Miss HARLOW  I can't help observing Sir that you dwell chiefly on articles of external and superficial merit whereas the more valuable qualities of the mind prudence good sense a wellregulated conduct  CLERIMONT  Oh ma'am I am not inattentive to those mattersoh she has a notable household understanding I warrant her  aside  but let me intreat you madam to do justice to my principles and believe me a sincere a generous lover  Miss HARLOW  Sir I will frankly own that I have been trying you all this time and from henceforth all doubts are banished  CLERIMONT  Your words recal me to new lifeI shall for ever study to merit this goodnessBut your fair sisterdo you think I can depend upon her consentMay I flatter myself she will not change her mind  Miss HARLOW  My sister cannot be insensible of the honour you do us alland Sir as far as I can act with propriety in the affair I will endeavour to keep them all inclined to favour you  CLERIMONT  Madam  bows  Miss HARLOW  You have an interest in my breast that will be busy for you  CLERIMONT  I am eternally devoted to you madam  bows  Miss HARLOW  How modest and yet how expressive he is  Aside  CLERIMONT  Madam I shall be for ever sensible of this extreme condescension and shall think no pains too great to prove the gratitude and esteem I bear youI beg my compliments to Mr Harlow and I shall be here with my uncle in the eveningas early as possible I shall comemy respects to your sister ma'am  and pray madam keep her in my interestMadam your most obedientI have managed the motherly lady finely I think  aside
