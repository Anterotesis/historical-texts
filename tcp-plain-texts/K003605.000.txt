 THE LOVE OF GAIN  A POEM  IMITATED FROM THE THIRTEENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL  Oh thou sweet Kingkiller and dear Divorce  'Twixt natural Son and Sire thou bright Defiler  Of Hymen's purest Bed thou valiant Mars  Thou everloved fresh young and delicate Wooer  Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow  That lies on Dian's lap  SHAKESPEARE  By M G LEWIS ESQ M P AUTHOR OF THE MONK CASTLESPECTRE ETC

native darkness ever mocks disguise  And crimes look foul e'en in their author's eyes  Here the first mark of heav'nly vengeance view  Vice false to others to herself is true  When the pack'd jury and the quibbled flaw  Delude the eye and lame the arm of law  When Erskine's wit the culpritclient saves  And fraud unscourged offended justice braves  Still is the wretch in private doom'd to hear  From his own heart a verdict more severe  There dwells a judge whose voice no bribe can pay  No party silence and no flattery sway  The sinner shrinks before himself arraign'd  And almost sorrows that his cause is gain'd  Nor does his guilt himself alone disgust  The world condemns for here the world is just  Unpunish'd crimes still shock the public ear  And crimes unpunish'd doubly foul appear  Then why Emilius thus in furious strain  Of broken faith and laws corrupt complain  Less warmth my testy friend more justly sound  Your injury's depth nor call your scratch a wound  With plenteous store by Fortune's bounty blest  Of bonds and stock and fertile lands possest  Your loss is trifling and so trite your case  Scarce in the public prints 'twill find a place  While then we mark your breast with passion rise  Your trembling lips clench'd hands and flashing eyes  When ask'd the cause how poor the answer sounds  "A friend is false I've lost a thousand pounds"  A friend is false Does that amaze the eye  Which lately saw its sixtieth year go by  Has age then bleach'd your raven locks in vain  Impair'd your limbs and not matur'd your brain  Oh mourn your dross no more with tears lament  Your mind unfurnish'd and your time mispent  Blest is the man whom philosophic lore  Beyond proud Fortune's reach has taught to soar  Who when she frowns her falshood not reviles  Nor boasts her favour when the harlot smiles  Nor him less happy count whose years have bought  Precious experience and deepsearching thought  Wisdom to know all bliss is insecure  Courage to hope and patience to endure  Say loud complainant does the rolling year  Present one day from fraud or knavery clear  Whose spotless White no thefts no murders stain  Writing in blood man's damning lust for gain  In vain you searchyet still the search pursue  Examine men and find of good how few  So few alas that if that guilt to fly  Which daily hourly here disgusts the eye  The just resolv'd to leave the British strand  And seek some distant less polluted land  The whole fair troop away with ease might bear  My lordmayor's barge and still have room to spare  Now let the iron age no more be blam'd  Blest should its memory be when ours is nam'd  For which no bard can find in nature's page  So base a metal as would mark the age  Yet though ourselves still sin not less we blame  Our neighbour's sin and when  he  errs exclaim  Louder than fishwives scold or asses bray  Or Vapid puffs his own dry dull damn'd play  Allhail mouthvirtue at your altar bend  Each canting hypocrite and perjur'd friend  Spare Lovegold sees his houshold god in you  Who cost no sixpence and who seem Peru  Boywitted Elder must thou still be told  No sorcerer's spell can witch an heart like gold  That in each guinea conqu'ring Cupids swarm  And Venus less than good King George can charm  Hear you not how the rude but wiser crowd  Mock your simplicity with laughter loud  When raving about faith and virtuous dread  And lightnings destin'd for each perjur'd head  You hope the traitor by your threats dismay'd  Will  keep the promise which he  can  evade  If such things were 'twas sure ere Adam fell  Or Eve lost Eden for a nonpareil  But now a debt if some strange man should own  When neither bond or witness prove the loan  To mark an act so just and truth so rare  His marble form should grace some public square  And his name blazon'd in the historic page  Attest that one good man adorn'd our age  For me whene'er such acts of faith I hear  Lost in amaze and trusting scarce mine ear  "Let all" I cry "to view this wonder run  "And Pidcock  Keeper of the Exhibition at Exeter 'Change  own his rarities outdone  "Mourn hapless Pidcock mourn your reign is o'er  "In vain your eagles scream and tigers roar  "The crowds who erst to view your monsters ran  "Now seek a rarer sight an honest man  "What drinks what eats he for I ne'er can think  "Like common mortals he can eat or drink  "How speaks how walks he ere I sleep tonight  "On this rare creature I must feast my sight"  And when at length this wonder I behold  Amaz'd to find him cast in human mould  I'm vex'd that like ourselves on earth he treads  And scarce believe he hasn't got two heads  But say Emilius if a wrong thus slight  So wounds thy feelings and disgusts thy sight  How wouldst thou rave if Fraud's glib tongue had found  The means to 'reave thee of thy last poor pound  Or how support a friend's more guilty stealth  When loss of freedom follows loss of wealth  Turn to yon prison list yon captive's tale  Who rashly stood his smoothtongu'd brother's bail  Pent in those walls the wretch all hope resigns  Now wildly raves and now dejected pines  While his free life abroad the debtor spends  Enjoys new pleasure and defrauds new friends  EMILIUS  Oh but  my  wretch so wondrous well deceiv'd  Suspicion's self had sure his faith believ'd  He swore such oaths  THE AUTHOR  He swore did that prevail  And wert thou blinded by a trick so stale  Oaths now are trifles few refuse to take  Easy to form and easier still to break  Their perjur'd vows but few with horror scan  But few fear heavenly wrath if safe from man  Or shuddering think their guilt that angels know  The secret sin a secret still below  Mark'd you when late your cause in court was tried  And your false friend his lawful debt denied  One slight convulsion or one transient blush  Bid his lip quiver or his forehead flush  Falter'd his tongue when lost all sacred fear  On God he call'd to prove his words sincere  And wish'd if just your charge to curse his sin  Flames might consume himself and all his kin  No such his earnest air and changeless face  Each word each look such candour seem'd to grace  So firm his voice so bold and clear his eye  Yourself could scarce believe his tale a lye  EMILIUS  'Tis true 'tis true with horror struck I heard  The unblushing villain speak the damning word  Gods how can man thus brave celestial ire  While heaven has justice and while hell has fire  THE AUTHOR  Alas my friend an awful truth to tell  There are who scorn that heaven and mock that hell  In vain for these alternate seasons reign  Spring robes the fields and Autumn swells the grain  In vain the moon now gilds the brow of night  And now the sun pours floods of glorious light  "'Twas chance" they cry "to those fair orbs gave birth  "And chance alone with produce bless'd the earth"  Then boldly on the sacred book they lay  Their lips to swear some good man's wealth away  And while his spoils their ravish'd eyes bewitch  Laugh at poor rogues less impious and less rich  Others whom timid guilt forbids to climb  Those dreadful heights where Atheists soar sublime  Own that a Power Supreme exists on high  But while they own a power that power defy  To these the priest inspir'd describes in vain  Each promis'd pleasure and each threaten'd pain  Heaven's future joys their notice scarce seem worth  Wealth in  this  world their present heaven on earth  Nor fear they to deserve the Eternal's curse  Hell bad 'tis true but want of money worse  "Let wrath divine" thus Gripe in transport cries  "Curse every limb and quench my blasted eyes  "If still harmonious sounds mine ears may drink  "While in yon chest my counted guineas chink  "And still my palsied hands have power to hold  "Close to my heart this bag of darling gold  "What shall I fear indignant Heaven to see  "Its magazine of plagues exhaust on me  "What shall I mourn the bargain made if wealth  "I buy with loss of fame and loss of health  "No still with glad content my heart shall beat  "Though tortures rack my hands my eyes my feet  "If hoards of gold my bursting coffers fill  "Gold which can soothe each pang each fear can still  "Comfort for every care and balm for every ill  "Yet why these fears Celestial wrath we know  "Though just is merciful though fierce is slow  "Perhaps too when arrives the avenging hour  "Repentant prayers may calm Heaven's angry power  "Nor always in the world's vast book we find  "To equal sin an equal doom assigned  "Here see with honours crown'd there'whelm'd with grief  "The Indian spoiler and the English thief  "And mark what varying fates their plunders stop  "Who robb'd a nation and who robb'd a shop  "Rascals alike by Fortune's wayward sport  "One goes to Tyburn t'other goes to Court  "And while this rogue is doom'd in air to swing  "That for a peerage kneels to thank the King"  The sophist's fears thus calm'd the legal war  No more he dreads but dauntless seeks the bar  Arrives before you wonders why you stay  And cries"Sure conscience makes the wretch delay"  Caught by his tranquil air and front of brass  Oft does for innocence assurance pass  The judge declares your charge must groundless be  Its malice blames and sets the prisoner free  While you with fiercer rage assert your cause  And term the judge corrupt unjust the laws  Than Sappho felt when Drury damn'd her work  Or Gallia's struggles rais'd in zealous Burke  Yet now Emilius let my prayers assuage  Awhile this flood of grief this storm of rage  Nor scorn my counsel though from one it flows  Whose life few years whose brain small judgment knows  Your  lack of temper suits  my  lack of wit  And boyish griefs with boyish counsels fit  When amputation risques a patient's life  Some skilful hand should guide the surgeon's knife  But who to bleed him Farquhar need retain  When the next barber's boy could breathe the vein  Mark thenIf what you mourn were some dire ill  No partner suffer'd and no time could still  If some strange curse some plague to nature new  On  you  had fall'n and fall'n on none but you  No word of mine should mock your publish'd pain  Or strive to bind your wrath in reason's chain  Who knows the human heart must also know  How keen the pangs which make your sorrows flow  Not with those sighs which heave the nephew's heart  Who sees his hoarding uncle's life depart  Not with those tears which custom bids be shed  By youthful widows for old husbands dead  Grieve they who dear departing wealth behold  And mourn not loss of friends but loss of gold  No forc'd affliction bids  their  sorrows rise  They  need no onion to provoke their eyes  NoLost that idol most adored and dear  Heartfelt despair wild rage and grief sincere  Burst in each bitter sigh gush in each scalding tear  Yet sure my friend 'tis wrong unusual rage  To feel at crimes so usual in this age  Unless your lot by fate you hoped design'd  Free from all crosses common to mankind  Alas ere beat your breast ere rent your hair  Weigh what you bear yourself what others bear  No pangs are yours past man's past Heaven's relief  No mighty mischiefs move this mighty grief  Search but the world then own your wrongs how small  Placed near those wrongs on other heads which fall  Must I attest the fact To prove how Vice  Reigns sovereign  here  one house can well suffice  To Bowstreet turn  The lines from the th to the th are by the Hon William Lambe    Ye giddy gay and proud  Who swell great London's everbustling crowd  London where all extremes together meet  Folly's chief throne and Wisdom's gravest seat  Where disagreements in agreement lie  Our closeknit mass of contrariety  Where throng the rich and poor the fool and knave  Where statesmen juggle and where patriots rave  Where balls for advocates prepare their work  And embryo lawsuits in a whisper lurk  Where Cupid pays in specie for his wiles  And judges frown whene'er a lady smiles  Where equal farce continual sport affords  At CoventGarden or the House of Lords  Where beggars with feigned tears and ready smiles  Cringe to St James or blubber to St Giles  Ye who confusedly sail in motley trim  Down this full flood of pleasure business whim  Whether you frame smooth glib and specious lies  To cheat a tradesman or to raise supplies  With private or with public misery sport  Cheats upon 'Change or Parasites at Court  Now pause awhileFor one reflecting hour  Forego your hopes of gain your dreams of power  And hark while tells the Muse what monstrous crimes  What newfound sins reserv'd for our strange times  Their hideous forms to Addington betray  From morn's first languish to the death of day  Here mark the thankless child the unnatural sire  The Pandar slave who lets his spouse for hire  The adulterous friend the trusted wanton wife  The brother aiming at the brother's life  The rake who cools in beauty's arms his heat  Then lets her starve or ply for bread the street  And that dark train of foes to moral rules  Thieves Bawds Assassins Gamblers Knaves and Fools  Fools who would fain  be  knaves No more I'll write  Hence odious forms nor longer shock my sight  Else by disgust and scorn to madness driven  Bursting those chains which bind my soul to Heaven  I shall disdain to breathe such tainted air  Shall blush an human form like these to wear  For present ease shall barter future bliss  And sure no world can be more black than this  Deep in my swelling heart shall plunge the knife  And cry while flies my soul from mortal strife  "Heaven bless my father though he gave me life"  Cease wild enthusiast end thy angry tale  O'er human frailties drop compassion's veil  View them with grief not rage nor dare to scan  With censure too severe thy fellowman  Think had no parent watch'd thy pliant youth  Curb'd thy wild passions turn'd thy steps to Truth  And taught thee by her radiant light to know  That bliss is virtue and that guilt is woe  Spurning restraint and scorn'd each sacred vow  Haply thyself had been what these are now  These who by headstrong passions forc'd away  Or pressing want or strong example's sway  Strangers to love of man or fear of God  But trod perhaps those paths their parents trod  While ignorance led them to that whirlpool's brink  Where long they struggled and where now they sink  Oh view  their  lot my soul nor more repine  To bear those evils Fate has fix'd on mine  Content though many a grief my bosom wrings  If still that bosom owns no conscious stings  If still I know for others wounds to feel  With pity view them and with pleasure heal  And still those pangs which cause so keen a smart  Nor sour my temper nor deprave my heart  Yes though by fate with heaviest sorrows curst  From my pale lips no murmuring breath should burst  If still my hand had power to raise the opprest  And though unblest myself make others blest  That power Emilius still is yoursThen why  Thus pants your bosom and thus flames your eye  Your gold though lost  EMILIUS  Nay 'tis not gold which makes  This fury tear me but my bile it shakes  That still my lawful suit in vain I urge  And still yon caitiff mocks the avenging scourge  Could I but once his wellearn'd sufferings see  THE AUTHOR  And would his sufferings then bring wealth to thee  Would with his blood gold to thy coffers run  Or all his groans repay thee one pound one  EMILIUS  Not so but vengeance  THE AUTHOR  HushTo mention fear  What thou must shame to speak I shame to hear  Base minds alone delight in vengeance find  That low vile passion of a low vile mind  Oh think when summoned to the throne of Heaven  As thou forgav'st so thou shalt be forgiven  And think what pangs would rack each throbbing nerve  If God should judge us as our faults deserve  Say at this moment should the perjur'd wretch  Stung with remorse his hands imploring stretch  Tow'rds thee for pardon while with tears and groans  Thy foot he kisses and his guilt he owns  Should that foot spurn him Would'st thou frown and cry  "Back sinner to the flames thou fain would'st fly"  'Twere nobler far thy thirst of vengeance o'er  To bid the sinner rise and sin no more  'Twere nobler far to play the Christian's part  Aid struggling Conscience to secure his heart  Confirm his faith with hope inspire his breast  And make him virtuous now hereafter blest  Then when thou died'st the transport thine would be  Proudly to boast"God owes a soul to me"  But if revenge alone can please you know  E'en now though law was blind though justice slow  More pangs he feels his heart by conscience rent  Than you could name or mortal brain invent  True from his lips no 'plaints inform the crowd  What pains are his deep are his groans not loud  "Curses not loud but deep"  MACBETH    True from his eyes no streams of anguish roll  His burning tears fall inwards on his soul  There brood thy vipers Conscious Guilt and dart  With ceaseless spite their fangs into his heart  There prints with bloodless stroke thy silent steel  Wounds that no balm can ease no time can heal  Not all the pangs which Dante's visions swell  No freezing limbo and no fiery hell  Surpass his torments who still bears unblest  A selfaccuser in his own sad breast  Disgust and ceaseless Care and anxious Fear  Still share his bed and at his board appear  In vain his Cooks their various arts combine  Each dish to season and each sauce refine  Champagne's rich grape in vain to chear his soul  With brilliant bubbles fills his chrystal bowl  The harpy Conscience pounces on her prey  At subitae horrisico lapsu de montibus adsunt  Harpyiae magnis quatiunt clangoribus alas  Deripiuntque dapes contactuque omnia foedant  Immundo  AENEID Book III    Tears from his hand the untasted food away  And ere the wine his pallid lips can pass  Her gallfraught tongue drops poison in his glass  Next mark my friend his slumbersIf Repose  Lists to his suit and bids his eyelids close  Mark what convulsions heave his martyr'd breast  And frequent starts and heartdrawn sighs attest  Though Nature grants him sleep that Guilt denies him rest  Now groans of tortur'd ghosts his ear affright  Now ghastly phantoms dance before his sight  And now he sees and screams in frantic fear  To size gigantic swell'd thy angry shade appear  Swift at thy summons rush with hideous yell  Their prey to seize the Denizens of hell  Headlong they hurl him on some icerock's point  Mangle each limb and dislocate each joint  Or plunge him deep in blue sulphureous lakes  Or lash his quivering flesh with twisted snakes  Or in his brain their burning talons dart  Or from his bosom rend his panting heart  To bathe their fiery lips in guilty gore  Then starts he from his couch while dews of horror pour  Down his dank foreheadwrings his hands and prays to sleep no more  Hark the Stormdaemon shrieksIt thundersLo  How pale his cheeks how wild his eyeballs grow  Heard the first murmur while he waits the crash  And dreads to see the etherial meteors flash  No shock of clouds he thinks no casual hand  Rolls the red bolt or darts th' avenging brand  'Tis Heaven's own voice in thunder bids him die  And 'tis to blast him yon blue lightnings fly  His fears were vain the storm dispersestrue  But who can answer what the next may do  Though now sweet nature sleeps and skies are fair  Soon gathering clouds again may gloom the air  Soon shafts divine winged by celestial breath  Again may glare and the next shaft brings death  With ceaseless fears and conscious pangs opprest  By day by night unknown one hour of rest  Wasted his limbs his strength and spirits fled  Disease now chains him on her thorny bed  The couch in crowds though Galen's sons surround  His dire complaints deride their skill profound  No med'cine brings relief no pang is eas'd  For who can medicine to a mind diseas'd  Can'st thou not minister to a mind diseased  Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow  Raze out the written troubles of the brain  And with some sweet oblivious antidote  Cleanse the foul spirit of that perilous stuff  That weighs upon the heart  MACBETH    Heaven's Lord alone"And shall I dare invoke  "With prayers that Power whose holiest law I broke  "In heaven still fresh my violated vow  "Will angels heed my forced repentance now  "Hence idle thought no prayers can now obtain  "Aid from insulted Heaven and man's is vain"  Thus cries the wretch distraction in his eye  Hopeless to live yet unprepared to die  By fear his soul by pain his body vext  By conscience tortured and by doubt perplext  Loathing this world and shuddering at the next  Yet though his old offence thus brands with shame  His conscious forehead and unmans his frame  When some new sin excites his impious zeal  His heart is adamant his nerves are steel  Nor think your perjur'd friend reform'd by time  Will bound his forfeits to this single crime  The rose of innocence once rent away  No more shall grace his brow And who can say  "One step and then no further"This first sin  Crown'd with success ere long his feet shall win  To loftier heights of vice and urge his fate  From bad to worse from little crimes to great  Till his broad guilt for public vengeance calls  And to the laws his life a victim falls  Then shalt thou own and blush at thy mistrust  Crimes still are punish'd and God still is just  Here break we offSpeed thou to Lombardstreet  Or plod the gambling 'Change with busy feet  'Midst Bulls and Bears some false report to spread  Of Prussia armed or Buonaparte dead  From specious lies an  honest  gain to draw  And spoil some wretch in forms allowed by law  More dupes to find more knavish tricks to learn  And fooled thyself fool others in thy turn  While I sequestered in some favourite nook  Or guide the pencil or explore the book  Blest if still free from mad Ambition's dreams  Youth's vain rash hopes and Interest's fordid schemes  I sometimes hear to chear my lonely hours  The Muse awake her lute's harmonious powers  And still can boast when down life's vale I bend  My steps nor grieved nor glad my days to end  A feeling heart an open hand content and one true friend  FINIS
