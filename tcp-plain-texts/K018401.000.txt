 THE GOOD NATUR'D MAN A COMEDY As Performed at the THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  BY MR GOLDSMITH  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN in CatharineStreet Strand MDCCLXVIII  PREFACE  WHEN I undertook to write a comedy I confess I was strongly prepossessed in favour of the poets of the last age and strove to imitate them The term  genteel comedy  was then unknown amongst us and little more was desired by an audience than nature and humour in whatever walks of life they were most conspicuous The author of the following scenes never imagined that more would be expected of him and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim Those who know any thing of composition are sensible that in pursuing humour it will sometimes lead us into the recesses of the mean I was even tempted to look for it in the master of a spunginghouse but in deference to the public taste grown of late perhaps too delicate the scene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the representation In deference also to the judgment of a few friends who think in a particular way the scene is here restored The author submits it to the reader in his closet and hopes that too much refinement will not banish humour and character from our's as it has already done from the French theatre Indeed the French comedy is now become so very elevated and sentimental that it has not only banished humour and  Moliere  from the stage but it has banished all spectators too  Upon the whole the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the Good Natur'd Man has met with and to Mr Colman in particular for his kindness to it It may not also be improper to assure any who shall hereafter write for the theatre that merit or supposed merit will ever be a sufficient passport to his protection  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY DR JOHNSON SPOKEN BY MR BENSLEY  PREST by the load of life the weary mind  Surveys the general toil of human kind  With cool submission joins the labouring train  And social sorrow loses half it's pain  Our anxious Bard without complaint may share  This bustling season's epidemic care  Like Caesar's pilot dignified by fate  Tost in one common storm with all the great  Distrest alike the statesman and the wit  When one a borough courts and one the pit  The busy candidates for power and fame  Have hopes and fears and wishes just the same  Disabled both to combat or to fly  Must hear all taunts and hear without reply  Uncheck'd on both loud rabbles vent their rage  As mongrels bay the lion in a cage  Th' offended burgess hoards his angry tale  For that blest year when all that vote may rail  Their schemes of spite the poet's foes dismiss  Till that glad night when all that hate may hiss  This day the powder'd curls and golden coat  Says swelling Crispin begg'd a cobler's vote  This night our wit the pert apprentice cries  Lies at my feet I hiss him and he dies  The great 'tis true can charm th' electing tribe  The bard may supplicate but cannot bribe  Yet judg'd by those whose voices ne'er were sold  He feels no want of ill persuading gold  But confident of praise if praise be due  Trusts without fear to merit and to you  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Mr

Apartment in YOUNG HONEYWOOD's House  Enter SIR WILLIAM HONEYWOOD JARVIS  Sir Will  GOOD Jarvis make no apologies for this honest bluntness Fidelity like yours is the best excuse for every freedom  Jarvis  I can't help being blunt and being very angry too when I hear you talk of disinheriting so good so worthy a young gentleman as your nephew my master All the world loves him  Sir Will  Say rather that he loves all the world that is his fault  Jarvis  I'm sure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are tho' he has not seen you since he was a child  Sir Will  What signifies his affection to me or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every sharper and coxcomb find an easy entrance  Jarvis  I grant you that he's rather too good natur'd that he's too much every man's man that he laughs this minute with one and cries the next with another but whose instructions may he thank for all this  Sir Will  Not mine sure My letters to him during my employment in Italy taught him only that philosophy which might prevent not defend his errors  Jarvis  Faith begging your honour's pardon I'm sorry they taught him any philosophy at all it has only serv'd to spoil him This same philosophy is a good horse in the stable but an errant jade on a journey For my own part whenever I hear him mention the name on't I'm always sure he's going to play the fool  Sir Will  Don't let us ascribe his faults to his philosophy I entreat you No Jarvis his good nature arises rather from his fears of offending the importunate than his desire of making the deserving happy  Jarvis  What it rises from I don't know But to be sure every body has it that asks it  Sir Will  Ay or that does not ask it I have been now for some time a concealed spectator of his follies and find them as boundless as his dissipation  Jarvis  And yet faith he has some fine name or other for them all He calls his extravagance generosity and his trusting every body universal benevolence It was but last week he went security for a fellow whose face he scarce knew and that he call'd an act of exalted mumumunificence ay that was the name he gave it  Sir Will  And upon that I proceed as my last effort tho' with very little hopes to reclaim him That very fellow has just absconded and I have taken up the security Now my intention is to involve him in fictitious distress before he has plunged himself into real calamity To arrest him for that very debt to clap an officer upon him and then let him see which of his friends will come to his relief  Jarvis  Well if I could but any way see him thoroughly vexed every groan of his would be music to me yet faith I believe it impossible I have tried to fret him myself every morning these three years but instead of being angry he sits as calmly to hear me scold as he does to his hairdresser  Sir Will  We must try him once more however and I'll go this instant to put my scheme into execution and I don't despair of succeeding as by your  means I can have frequent opportunities of being about him without being known What a pity it is Jarvis that any man's good will to others should produce so much neglect of himself as to require correction Yet we must touch his weaknesses with a delicate hand There are some faults so nearly allied to excellence that we can scarce weed out the vice without eradicating the virtue  Exit  Jarvis  Well go thy ways Sir William Honeywood It is not without reason that the world allows thee to be the best of men But here comes his hopeful nephew the strange good natur'd foolish open heartedAnd yet all his faults are such that one loves him still the better for them  Enter HONEYWOOD  Honeyw  Well Jarvis what messages from my friends this morning  Jarvis  You have no friends  Honeyw  Well from my acquaintance then  Jarvis  Pulling out bills  A few of our usual cards of compliment that's all This bill from your taylor this from your mercer and this from the little broker in Crookedlane He says he has been at a great deal of trouble to get back the money you borrowed  Honeyw  That I don't know but I'm sure we were at a great deal of trouble in getting him to lend it  Jarvis  He has lost all patience  Honeyw  Then he has lost a very good thing  Jarvis  There's that ten guineas you were sending to the poor gentleman and his children in the Fleet I believe that would stop his mouth for a while at least  Honeyw  Ay Jarvis but what will fill their mouths in the mean time Must I be cruel because he happens to be importunate and to relieve his avarice leave them to insupportable distress  Jarvis  'Sdeath Sir the question now is how to relieve yourself YourselfHav'nt I reason to be out of my senses when I see things going at sixes and sevens  Honeyw  Whatever reason you may have for being out of your senses I hope you'll allow that I'm not quite unreasonable for continuing in mine  Jarvis  You're the only man alive in your present situation that could do soEvery thing upon the waste There's Miss Richland and her fine fortune gone already and upon the point of being given to your rival  Honeyw  I'm no man's rival  Jarvis  Your uncle in Italy preparing to disinherit you your own fortune almost spent and nothing but pressing creditors false friends and a pack of drunken servants that your kindness has made unfit for any other family  Honeyw  Then they have the more occasion for being in mine  Jarvis  Soh What will you have done with him that I caught stealing your plate in the pantry In the fact I caught him in the fact  Honeyw  In the fact If so I really think that we should pay him his wages and turn him off  Jarvis  He shall be turn'd off at Tyburn the dog we'll hang him if it be only to frighten the rest of the family  Honeyw  No Jarvis it's enough that we have lost what he has stolen let us not add to it the loss of a fellow creature  Jarvis  Very fine well here was the footman just now to complain of the butler he says he does most work and ought to have most wages  Honeyw  That's but just tho' perhaps here comes the butler to complain of the footman  Jarvis  Ay its the way with them all from the scullion to the privycounsellor If they have a bad master they keep quarrelling with him if they have a good master they keep quarrelling with one another  Enter BUTLER drunk  Butler  Sir I'll not stay in the family with Jonathan you must part with him or part with me that's the exexexposition of the matter Sir  Honeyw  Full and explicit enough But what's his fault good Philip  Butler  Sir he's given to drinking Sir and I shall have my morals corrupted by keeping such company  Honeyw  Ha Ha He has such a diverting way  Jarvis  O quite amusing  Butler  I find my wines a going Sir and liquors don't go without mouths Sir I hate a drunkard Sir  Honeyw  Well well Philip I'll hear you upon that another time so go to bed now  Jarvis  To bed Let him go to the devil  Butler  Begging your honour's pardon and begging your pardon master Jarvis I'll not go to bed nor to the devil neither I have enough to do to mind my cellar I forgot your honour Mr Croaker is below I came on purpose to tell you  Honeyw  Why didn't you shew him up blockhead  Butler  Shew him up Sir With all my heart Sir Up or down all's one to me  Exit  Jarvis  Ay we have one or other of that family in this house from morning till night He comes on the old affair I suppose The match between his son that's just returned from Paris and Miss Richland the young lady he's guardian to  Honeyw  Perhaps so Mr Croaker knowing my friendship for the young lady has got it into his head that I can persuade her to what I please  Jarvis  Ah If you lov'd yourself but half as well as she loves you we should soon see a marriage that would set all things to rights again  Honeyw  Love me Sure Jarvis you dream No no her intimacy with me never amounted to more than friendshipmere friendship That she is the most lovely woman that ever warm'd the human heart with desire I own But never let me harbour a thought of making her unhappy by a connection with one so unworthy her merits as I am No Jarvis it shall be my study to serve her even in spite of my wishes and to secure her happiness tho' it destroys my own  Jarvis  Was ever the like I want patience  Honeyw  Besides Jarvis tho' I could obtain Miss Richland's consent do you think I could succeed with her guardian or Mrs Croaker his wife who tho' both very fine in their way are yet a little opposite in their dispositions you know  Jarvis  Opposite enough Heaven knows the very reverse of each other she all laugh and no joke he always complaining and never sorrowful a fretful poor soul that has a new distress for every hour in the four and twenty  Honeyw  Hush hush he's coming up he'll hear you  Jarvis  One whose voice is a passing bell  Honeyw  Well well go do  Jarvis  A raven that bodes nothing but mischief a coffin and cross bones a bundle of rue a sprig of deadly night shade a  Honeywood stopping his mouth at last pushes him off  Exit Jarvis  Honeyw  I must own my old monitor is not entirely wrong There is something in my friend Croaker's conversation that quite depresses me His very mirth is an antidote to all gaiety and his appearance has a stronger effect on my spirits than an undertaker's shopMr Croaker this is such a satisfaction  Enter CROAKER  Croaker  A pleasant morning to Mr Honeywood and many of them How is this You look most shockingly to day my dear friend I hope this weather does not affect your spirits To be sure if this weather continuesI say nothingBut God send we be all better this day three months  Honeyw  I heartily concur in the wish tho' I own not in your apprehensions  Croaker  May be not Indeed what signifies what weather we have in a country going to ruin like ours Taxes rising and trade falling Money flying out of the kingdom and Jesuits swarming into it I know at this time no less than an hundred and  twentyseven Jesuits between Charingcross and Templebar  Honeyw  The Jesuits will scarce pervert you or me I should hope  Croaker  May be not Indeed what signifies whom they pervert in a country that has scarce any religion to lose I'm only afraid for our wives and daughters  Honeyw  I have no apprehensions for the ladies I assure you  Croaker  May be not Indeed what signifies whether they be perverted or no The women in my time were good for something I have seen a lady drest from top to toe in her own manufactures formerly But now adays the devil a thing of their own manufactures about them except their faces  Honeyw  But however these faults may be practised abroad you don't find them at home either with Mrs Croaker Olivia or Miss Richland  Croaker  The best of them will never be canoniz'd for a saint when she's dead By the bye my dear friend I don't find this match between Miss Richland and my son much relish'd either by one side or t'other  Honeyw  I thought otherwise  Croaker  Ah Mr Honeywood a little of your fine serious advice to the young lady might go far I know she has a very exalted opinion of your understanding  Honeyw  But would not that be usurping an authority that more properly belongs to yourself  Croaker  My dear friend you know but little of my authority at home People think indeed because they see me come out in a morning thus with a pleasant face and to make my friends merry that all's well within But I have cares that would break an heart of stone My wife has so encroach'd upon every one of my privileges that I'm now no more than a mere lodger in my own house  Honeyw  But a little spirit exerted on your side might perhaps restore your authority  Croaker  No tho' I had the spirit of a lion I do rouze sometimes But what then Always hagling and hagling A man is tired of getting the better before his wife is tired of losing the victory  Honeyw  It's a melancholy consideration indeed that our chief comforts often produce our greatest anxieties and that an encrease of our possessions is but an inlet to new disquietudes  Croaker  Ah my dear friend these were the very words of poor Dick Doleful to me not a week before he made away with himself Indeed Mr Honeywood I never see you but you put me in mind of poorDick Ah there was merit neglected for you and so true a friend we lov'd each other for thirty years and yet he never asked me to lend him a single farthing  Honeyw  Pray what could induce him to commit so rash an action at last  Croaker  I don't know some people were malicious enough to say it was keeping company with me because we us'd to meet now and then and open our hearts to each other To be sure I lov'd to hear him talk and he lov'd to hear me talk poor dear Dick He us'd to say that Croaker rhim'd to joker and so we us'd to laughPoor Dick  Going to cry  Honeyw  His fate affects me  Croaker  Ay he grew sick of this miserable life where we do nothing but eat and grow hungry dress and undress get up and lie down while reason that should watch like a nurse by our side falls as fast asleep as we do  Honeyw  To say truth if we compare that part of life which is to come by that which we have past the prospect is hideous  Croaker  Life at the greatest and best is but a froward child that must be humour'd and coax'd a little till it falls asleep and then all the care is over  Honeyw  Very true Sir nothing can exceed the vanity of our existence but the folly of our pursuits We wept when we came into the world and every day tells us why  Croaker  Ah my dear friend it is a perfect satisfaction to be miserable with you My son Leontine shan't lose the benefit of such fine conversation I'll just step home for him I am willing to shew him so much seriousness in one scarce older than himselfAnd what if I bring my last letter to the Gazetteer on the encrease and progress of earthquakes It will amuse us I promise you I there prove how the late earthquake is coming round to pay us another visit from London to Lisbon from Lisbon to the Canary Islands from the Canary Islands to Palmyra from Palmyra to Constantinople and so from Constantinople back to London again  Exit  Honeyw  Poor Croaker His situation deserves the utmost pity I shall scarce recover my spirits these three days Sure to live upon such terms is worse than death itself And yet when I consider my own situation a broken fortune an hopeless passion friends in distress the wish but not the power to serve them  pausing and sighing  Enter BUTLER  Butler  More company below Sir Mrs Croaker and Miss Richland shall I shew them up But they're shewing up themselves  Exit  Enter Mrs CROAKER and Miss RICHLAND  Miss Rich  Your'e always in such spirits  Mrs Croaker  We have just come my dear Honeywood from the auction There was the old deaf dowager as usual bidding like a fury against herself And then so curious in antique  Herself the most genuine piece of antiquity in the whole collection  Honeyw  Excuse me ladies if some uneasiness from friendship makes me unfit to share in this good humour I know you'll pardon me  Mrs Croaker  I vow he seems as melancholy as if he had taken a dose of my husband this morning Well if Richland here can pardon you I must  Miss Rich  You would seem to insinuate madam that I have particular reasons for being dispos'd to refuse it  Mrs Croaker  Whatever I insinuate my dear don't be so ready to wish an explanation  Miss Rich  I own I should be sorry Mr Honeywood's long friendship and mine should be misunderstood  Honeyw  There's no answering for others madam But I hope you'll never find me presuming to offer more than the most delicate friendship may readily allow  Miss Rich  And I shall be prouder of such a tribute from you than the most passionate professions from others  Honeyw  My own sentimenrs Madam friendship is a disinterested commerce between equals love an abject intercourse between tyrants and slaves  Miss Rich  And without a compliment I know none more disinterested or more capable of friendship than Mr Honeywood  Mrs Croaker  And indeed I know nobody that has more friends at least among the ladies Miss Fruzz Miss Odbody and Miss Winterbottom praise him in all companies As for Miss Biddy Bundle she's his professed admirer  Miss Rich  Indeed an admirer I did not know Sir you were such a favourite there But is she seriously so handsome Is she the mighty thing talk'd of  Honeyw  The town Madam seldom begins to praise a lady's beauty till she's beginning to lose it  Smiling  Mrs Croaker  But she's resolved never to lose it it seems For as her natural face decays her skill improves in making the artificial one Well nothing diverts me more than one of those fine old dressy things who thinks to conceal her age by every where exposing her person sticking herself up in the front of a sidebox trailing thro' a minuet at Almack's and then in the public gardens looking for all the world like one of the painted ruins of the place  Honeyw  Every age has its admirers ladies While you perhaps are trading among the warmer climates of youth there ought to be some to carry on an useful commerce in the frozen latitudes beyond fifty  Miss Rich  But then the mortifications they must suffer before they can be fitted out for traffic I have seen one of them fret an whole morning at her hairdresser when all the fault was her face  Honeyw  And yet I'll engage has carried that face at last to a very good market This good natur'd town Madam has husbands like spectacles to fit every age from fifteen to fourscore  Mrs Croaker  Well you're a dear goodnatur'd creature But you know you're engaged with us this morning upon a stroling party I want to shew Olivia the town and the things I believe I shall have business for you for the whole day  Honeyw  I am sorry Madam I have an appointment with Mr Croaker which it is impossible to put off  Mrs Croaker  What with my husband Then I'm resolved to take no refusal Nay I protest you must You know I never laugh so much as with you  Honeyw  Why if I must I must I'll swear you have put me into such spirits Well do you find jest and I'll find laugh I promise you We'll wait for the chariot in the next room  Exeunt  Enter LEONTINE and OLIVIA  Leont  There they go thoughtless and happy My dearest Olivia what would I give to see you capable of sharing in their amusements and as chearful as they are  Olivia  How my Leontine how can I be chearful when I have so many terrors to oppress me The fear of being detected by this family and the apprehensions of a censuring world when I must be detected  Leont  The world my love what can it say At worst it can only say that being compelled by a mercenary guardian to embrace a life you disliked you formed a resolution of flying with the man of your choice that you confided in his honour and took refuge in this house the only one where your's could remain without censure  Olivia  But consider Leontine your disobedience and my indiscretion your being sent to France to bring home a sister and instead of a sister bringing home  Leont  One dearer than a thousand sisters One that I am convinc'd will be equally dear to the rest of the family when shew comes to be known  Olivia  And that I fear will shortly be  Leont  Impossible 'till we ourselves think proper to make the discovery My sister you know has been with her aunt at Lyons since she was a child and you find every creature in the family takes you for her  Olivia  But may'nt she write may'nt her aunt write  Leont  Her aunt scarce ever writes and all my sister's letters are directed to me  Olivia  But won't your refusing Miss Richland for whom you know the old gentleman intends you create a suspicion  Leont  There there's my masterstroke I have resolved not to refuse her nay an hour hence I  have consented to go with my father to make her an offer of my heart and fortune  Olivia  Your heart and fortune  Leont  Don't be alarm'd my dearest Can Olivia think so meanly of my honour or my love as to suppose I could ever hope for happiness from any but her No my Olivia neither the force nor permit me to add the delicacy of my passion leave any room to suspect me I only offer Miss Richland an heart I am convinc'd she will refuse as I am confident that without knowing it her affections are fixed upon Mr Honeywood  Olivia  Mr Honeywood You'll excuse my apprehensions but when your merits come to be put in the ballance  Leont  You view them with too much partiality However by making this offer I shew a seeming compliance with my father's commands and perhaps upon her refusal I may have his consent to chuse for myself  Olivia  Well I submit And yet my Leontine I own I shall envy her even your pretended addresses I consider every look every expression of your esteem as due only to me This is folly perhaps I allow it but it is natural to suppose that merit which has made an impression on ones own heart may be powerful over that of another  Leont  Don't my life's treasure don't let us make imaginary evils when you know we have so many real ones to encounter At worst you know if Miss Richland should consent or my father refuse his pardon it can but end in a trip to Scotland and  Enter CROAKER  Croaker  Where have you been boy I have been seeking you My friend Honeywood here has been saying such comfortable things Ah he's an example indeed where is he I left him here  Leont  Sir I believe you may see him and hear him too in the next room he's preparing to go out with the ladies  Croaker  Good gracious can I believe my eyes or my ears I'm struck dumb with his vivacity and stunn'd with the loudness of his laugh Was there ever such a transformation  A laugh behind the scenes Croaker mimics it  Ha ha ha there it goes a plague take their balderdash yet I could expect nothing less when my precious wife was of the party On my conscience I believe she could spread an horselaugh thro' the pews of a tabernacle  Leont  Since you find so many objections to a wife Sir how can you be so earnest in recommending one to me  Croaker  I have told you and tell you again boy that Miss Richland's fortune must not go out of the family one may find comfort in the money whatever one does in the wife  Leont  But Sir tho' in obedience to your desire I am ready to marry her it may be possible she has no inclination to me  Croaker  I'll tell you once for all how it stands A good part of Miss Richland's large fortune consists in a claim upon government which my good friend Mr Le Bronze assures me the treasury will allow One half of this she is to forfeit by her father's will in case she refuses to marry you So if she rejects you we seize half her fortune if she accepts you we seize the whole and a fine girl into the bargain  Leont  But Sir if you will but listen to reason  Croaker  Come then produce your reasons I tell you I'm fix'd determined so now produce your reasons When I'm determined I always listen to reason because it can then do no harm  Leont  You have alledged that a mutual choice was the first requisite in matrimonial happiness  Croaker  Well and you have both of you a mutual choice She has her choiceto marry you or lose  half her fortune and you have your choiceto marry her or pack out of doors without any fortune at all  Leont  An only Son Sir might expect more indulgence  Croaker  An only father Sir might expect more obedience besides has not your sister here that never disobliged me in her life as good a right as you He's a sad dog Livy my dear and would take all from you But he shan't I tell you he shan't for you shall have your share  Olivia  Dear Sir I wish you'd be convinced that I can never b  happy in any addition to my fortune which is taken from his  Croaker  Well well its a good child so say no more but come with me and we shall see something that will give us a great deal of pleasure I promise you old Ruggins the currycombmaker lying in state I'm told he makes a very handsome corpse and becomes his coffin prodigiously He was an intimate friend of mine and these are friendly things we ought to do for each other  Exeun  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE Croaker's House  Miss RICHLAND GARNET  Miss Rich  Olivia not his sister Olivia not Leontine's sister You amaze me  Garnet  No more his sister than I am I had it all from his own servant I can get any thing from that quarter  Miss Rich  But how Tell me again Garnet  Garnet  Why Madam as I told you before instead of going to Lyons to bring home his sister who has been there with her aunt these ten years he never went further than Paris there he saw and fell in love with this young lady by the bye of a prodigious family  Miss Rich  And brought her home to my guardian as his daughter  Garnet  Yes and daughter she will be if he don't consent to their marriage they talk of trying what a Scotch parson can do  Miss Rich  Well I own they have deceived meAnd so demurely as Olivia carried it tooWould you believe it Garnet I told her all my secrets and yet the sly cheat concealed all this from me  Garnet  And upon my word Madam I don't much blame her she was loath to trust one with her secrets that was so very bad at keeping her own  Miss Rich  But to add to their deceit the young gentleman it seems pretends to make me serious proposals My guardian and he are to be here presently to open the affair in form You know I am to lose half my fortune if I refuse him  Garnet  Yet what can you do For being as you are in love with Mr Honeywood Madam  Miss Rich  How ideot what do you mean In love with Mr Honeywood Is this to provoke me  Gar  That is Madam in friendship with him I meant nothing more than friendship as I hope to be married nothing more  Miss Rich  Well no more of this As to my guardian and his son they shall find me prepared to receive them I'm resolved to accept their proposal with seeming pleasure to mortify them by compliance and so throw the refusal at last upon them  Gar  Delicious and that will secure your whole fortune to yourself Well who could have thought so innocent a face could cover so much cuteness  Miss Rich  Why girl I only oppose my prudence to their cunning and practise a lesson they have taught me against themselves  Gar  Then you're likely not long to want employment for here they come and in close conference  Enter CROAKER LEONTINE  Leon  Excuse me Sir if I seem to hesitate upon the point of putting the lady so important a question  Croaker  Lord good Sir moderate your fears you're so plaguy shy that one would think you had changed sexes I tell you we must have the half or the whole Come let me see with what spirit you begin Well why don't you Eh What Well thenI must it seemsMiss Richland my dear I believe you guess at our business an affair which my son here comes to open that nearly concerns your happiness  Miss Rich  Sir I should be ungrateful not to be pleased with any thing that comes recommended by you  Croaker  How boy could you desire a finer opening Why don't you begin I say  To Leont  Leont  'Tis true Madam my father Madam has some intentionshemof explaining an affairwhichhimselfcan best explain Madam  Croaker  Yes my dear it comes intirely from my son it's all a request of his own Madam And I will permit him to make the best of it  Leont  The whole affair is only this Madam my father has a proposal to make which he insists none but himself shall deliver  Croaker  My mind misgives me the fellow will never be brought on  Aside  In short Madam you see before you one that loves you one whose whole happiness is all in you  Miss Rich  I never had any doubts of your regard Sir and I hope you can have none of my duty  Croaker  That's not the thing my little sweeting my love No no another guess lover than I there he stands Madam his very looks declare the force of his passionCall up a look you dog But then had you seen him as I have weeping speaking soliloquies and blank verse sometimes melancholy and sometimes absent  Miss Rich  I fear Sir he's absent now or such a declaration would have come most properly from himself  Croaker  Himself Madam he would die before he could make such a confession and if he had not a channel for his passion thro' me it would ere now have drowned his understanding  Miss Rich  I must grant Sir there are attractions in modest diffidence above the force of words A silent address is the genuine eloquence of sincerity  Croaker  Madam he has forgot to speak any other language silence is become his mother tongue  Miss Rich  And it must be confessed Sir it speaks very powerfully in his favour And yet I shall be thought too forward in making such a confession shan't I Mr Leontine  Leont  Confusion my reserve will undo me But if modesty attracts her impudence may disgust her I'll try  Aside  Don't imagine from my silence Madam that I want a due sense of the honour and happiness intended me My father Madam tells  me your humble servant is not totally indifferent to you He admires you I adore you and when we come together upon my soul I believe we shall be the happiest couple in all St James's  Miss Rich  If I could flatter myself you thought as you speak Sir  Leont  Doubt my sincerity Madam By your dear self I swear Ask the brave if they desire glory ask cowards if they covet safety  Croaker  Well well no more questions about it  Leont  Ask the sick if they long for health ask misers if they love money ask  Croaker  Ask a fool if he can talk nonsense What's come over the boy What signifies asking when there's not a soul to give you an answer If you would ask to the purpose ask this lady's consent to make you happy  Miss Rich  Why indeed Sir his uncommon ardour almost compels me forces me to comply And yet I'm afraid he'll despise a conquest gain'd with too much ease wont you Mr Leontine  Leont  Confusion  Aside  O by no means Madam by no means And yet Madam you talk'd of force There is nothing I would avoid so much as compulsion in a thing of this kind No Madam I will still be generous and leave you at liberty to refuse  Croaker  But I tell you Sir the lady is not at liberty Its a match You see she says nothing Silence gives consent  Leont  But Sir she talk'd of force Consider Sir the cruelty of constraining her inclinations  Croaker  But I say there's no cruelty Don't you know blockhead that girls have always a roundabout way of saying yes before company So get you both gone together into the next room and hang him that interrupts the tender explanation Get you gone I say I'll not hear a word  Leon  But Sir I must beg leave to insist  Croaker  Get off you puppy or I'll beg leave to insist upon knocking you down Stupid whelp But I don't wonder the boy takes entirely after his mother  Exeunt Miss Rich and Leont  Enter MRS CROAKER  Mrs Croaker  Mr Croaker I bring you something my dear that I believe will make you smile  Croaker  I'll hold you a guinea of that my dear  Mrs Croaker  A letter and as I knew the hand I ventured to open it  Croaker  And how can you expect your breaking open my letters should give me pleasure  Mrs Croaker  Poo its from your sister at Lyons and contains good news read it  Croaker  What a Frenchified cover is here That sister of mine has some good qualities but I could never teach her to fold a letter  Mrs Croaker  Fold a fiddlestick Read what it contains  Croaker  Reading  DEAR NICK  An English gentleman of large fortune has for some time made private tho' honourable proposals to your daughter Olivia They love each other tenderly and I find she has consented without letting any of the family know to crown his addresses As such good offers don't come every day your own good sense his large fortune and family considerations will induce you to forgive herYours ever  RACHEL CROAKER  My daughter Olivia privately contracted to a man of large fortune This is good news indeed Oh My heart never foretold me of this And yet how slily the little baggage has carried it since she came home Not a word on't to the old ones for the world Yet I thought I saw something she wanted to conceal  Mrs Croaker  Well if they have concealed their amour they shan't conceal their wedding that shall be public I'm resolved  Croaker  I tell thee woman the wedding is the most foolish part of the ceremony I can never get this woman to think of the more serious part of the nuptial engagement  Mrs Croaker  What would you have me think of their funeral But come tell me my dear don't you owe more to me than you care to confess Would you have ever been known to Mr Lofty who has undertaken Miss Richland's claim at the treasury but for me Who was it first made him an acquaintance at Lady Shabbaroon's route who got him to promise us his interest Is not he a backstairs favourite one that can do what he pleases with those that do what they please Isn't he an acquaintance that all your groaning and lamentations could never have got us  Croaker  He is a man of importance I grant you And yet what amazes me is that while he is giving away places to all the world he can't get one for himself  Mrs Croaker  That perhaps may be owing to his nicety Great men are not easily satisfied  Enter FRENCH SERVANT  Servant  An expresse from Monsieur Lofty He vil be vait upon your honour's instammant He be only giving four five instruction read two tree memorial call upon von ambassadeur He vill be vid you in one tree minutes  Mrs Croaker  You see now my dear What an extensive department Well friend let your master know that we are extremely honoured by this honour Was there any thing ever in a higher style of breeding All messages among the great are now done by express  Croaker  To be sure no man does little things with more solemnity or claims more respect than he But  he's in the right on't In our bad world respect is given where respect is claim'd  Mrs Croaker  Never mind the world my dear your were never in a pleasanter place in your life Let us now think of receiving him with proper respect  a loud rapping at the door  and there he is by the thundering rap  Croaker  Ay verily there he is as close upon the heels of his own express as an indorsement upon the back of a bill Well I'll leave you to receive him whilst I go to chide my little Olivia for intending to steal a marriage without mine or her aunt's consent I must seem to be angry or she too may begin to despise my authority  Exit  Enter LOFTY speaking to his servant  Lofty  And if the Venetian ambassador or that teazing creature the Marquis should call I'm not at home Dam'me I'll be pack horse to none of them My dear Madam I have just snatched a momentAnd if the expresses to his grace be ready let them be sent off they're of importance Madam I ask a thousand pardons  Mrs Croaker  Sir this honour  Lofty  And Dubardieu If the person calls about the commission let him know that it is made out As for Lord Cumbercourt's stale request it can keep cold you understand me Madam I ask ten thousand pardons  Mrs Croaker  Sir this honour  Lofty  And Dubardieu If the man comes from the Cornish borough you must do him you must do him I say Madam I ask ten thousand pardons And if the Russian ambassador calls but he will scarce call today I believe And now Madam I have just got time to express my happiness in having the honour of being permitted to profess myself your most obedient humble servant  Mrs Croaker  Sir the happiness and honour are all mine and yet I'm only robbing the public while I detain you  Lofty  Sink the public Madam when the fair are to be attended Ah could all my hours be so charmingly devouted Sincerely don't you pity us poor creatures in affairs Thus it is eternally solicited for places here teized for pensions there and courted every where I know you pity me Yes I see yo do  Mrs Croaker  Excuse me Sir Toils of empires pleasures are as Waller Congrave says  Lofty  Waller Waller is he of the House  Mrs Croaker  The modern poet of that name Sir  Lofty  Oh a modern We men of business despise the moderns and as for the ancients we have no time to read them Poetry is a pretty thing enough for our wives and daughters but not for us Why now here I stand that know nothing of books I say Madam I know nothing of books and yet I believe upon a land carriage fishery a stamp act or a jaghire I can talk my two hours without feeling the want of them  Mrs Croaker  The world is no stranger to Mr Lofty's eminence in every capacity  Lofty  I vow to Gad Madam you make me blush I'm nothing nothing nothing in the world a mere obscure gentleman To be sure indeed one or two of the present ministers are pleased to represent me as a formal man I know they are pleased to bespatter me at all their little dirty levees Yet upon my soul I wonder what they see in me to treat me so Measures not men have always been my mark and I vow by all that's honourable my resentment has never done the men as mere men any manner of harmThat is as mere men  Mrs Croaker  What importance and yet what modesty  Lofty  Oh if you talk of modesty Madam There I own I'm accessible to praise Modesty is my foible It was so the Duke of Brentford used to say of me I love Jack Lofty he used to say no man has a finer knowledge of things quite a man of information and when he speaks upon his legs by the lord he's  prodigious he scouts them and yet all men have their faults too much modesty is his says his Grace  Mrs Croaker  And yet I dare say you don't want assurance when you come to solicit for your friends  Lofty  O there indeed I'm a bronze Apropos I have just been mentioning miss Richland's case to a certain personage we must name no names When I ask I am not to be put off madam No no I take my friend by the button A fine girl sir great justice in her case A friend of mine Borough interest Business must be done Mr Secretary I say Mr Secretary her business must be done sir That's my way madam  Mrs Croaker  Bless me you said all this to the Secretary of State did you  Lofty  I did not say the Secretary did I Well curse it since you have found me out I will not deny it It was to the Secretary  Mrs Croaker  This was going to the fountain head at once not applying to the understrappers as Mr Honeywood would have had us  Lofty  Honeywood he he He was indeed a fine solicitor I suppose you have heard what has just happened to him  Mrs Croaker  Poor dear man no accident I hope  Lofty  Undone madam that's all His creditors have taken him into custody A prisoner in his own house  Mrs Croaker  A prisoner in his own house How At this very time I'm quite unhappy for him  Lofty  Why so am I The man to be sure was immensely good natur'd But then I could never find that he had any thing in him  Mrs Croaker  His manner to be sure was excessive harmless some indeed thought it a little dull For my part I always concealed my opinion  Lofty  It can't be conceal'd madam the man was dull dull as the last new comedy A poor impracticable creature I tried once or twice to know if he was fit for business but he had scarce talents to be groomporter to an orange barrow  Mrs Croaker  How differently does miss Richland think of him For I believe with all his faults she loves him  Lofty  Loves him Does she You should cure her of that by all means Let me see what if she were sent to him this instant in his present doleful situation My life for it that works her cure Distress is a perfect antidote to love Suppose we join her in the next room Miss Richland is a fine girl and has a fine fortunetwo very fine thingsand must not be thrown away Upon my honour Madam I have a regard for Miss Richland and rather than she should be thrown away I should think it no indignity to marry her myself  Exeunt  Enter Olivia and Leontine  Leont  And yet trust me Olivia I had every reason to expect Miss Richland's refusal as I did every thing in my power to deserve it Her indelicacy surprizes me  Olivia  Sure Leontine there's nothing so indelicate in being sensible of your merit If so I fear I shall be the most guilty thing alive  Leont  But you mistake my dear The same attention I used to advance my merit with you I practised to lessen it with her What more could I do  Olivia  Let us now rather consider what's to be done We have both dissembled too longI have always been asham'dI am now quite weary of it Sure I could never have undergone so much for any other but you  Leont  And you shall find my gratitude equal to your kindest compliance Tho' our friends should totally forsake us Olivia we can draw upon content for the desiciencies of fortune  Olivia  Then why should we defer our scheme of humble happiness when it is now in our power I may be the favourite of your father it is true but can it ever be thought that his present kindness  to a suppos'd child will continue to a known deceiver  Leont  I have many reasons to believe it will as his attachments are but few they are lasting His own marriage was a private one as our's may be Besides I have sounded him already at a distance and find all his answers exactly to our wish Nay by an expression or two that drop'd from him I am induced to think he knows of this affair  Olivia  Indeed But that would be an happiness too great to be expected  Leont  However it be I'm certain you have power over him and am persuaded if you inform'd him of our situation that he would be disposed to pardon it  Olivia  You had equal expectations Leontine from your last scheme with Miss Richland which you find has succeeded most wretchedly  Leont  And that's the best reason for trying another  Olivia  If it must be so I submit  Leont  As we could wish he comes this way Now my dearest Olivia be resolute I'll just retire within hearing to come in at a proper time either to share your danger or confirm your victory  Exit  Enter CROAKER  Croaker  Yes I must forgive her and yet not too easily neither It will be proper to keep up the decorums of resentment a little if it be only to impress her with an idea of my authority  Olivia  How I tremble to approach himMight I presume SirIf I interrupt you  Croaker  No child where I have an affection it is not a little thing can interrupt me Affection gets over little things  Olivia  Sir you're too kind I'm sensible how ill I deserve this partiality Yet Heaven knows there is nothing I would not do to gain it  Croaker  And you have but too well succeeded you little hussey you With those endearing ways of yours on my conscience I could be brought to forgive any thing unless it were a very great offence indeed  Olivia  But mine is such an offenceWhen you know my guiltYes you shall know it tho' I feel the greatest pain in the confession  Croaker  Why then if it be so very great a pain you may spare yourself the trouble for I know every syllable of the matter before you begin  Olivia  Indeed Then I'm undone  Croaker  Ay Miss you wanted to steal a match without letting me know it did you But I'm not worth being consulted I suppose when there's to be a marriage in my own family No I'm to have no hand in the disposal of my own children No I'm nobody I'm to be a mere article of family lumber a piece of crack'd china to be stuck up in a corner  Olivia  Dear Sir nothing but the dread of your authority could induce us to conceal it from you  Croaker  No no my consequence is no more I'm as little minded as a dead Russian in winter just stuck up with a pipe in his mouth till there comes a thawIt goes to my heart to vex her  Olivia  I was prepar'd Sir for your anger and despair'd of pardon even while I presum'd to ask it But your severity shall never abate my affection as my punishment is but justice  Croaker  And yet you should not despair neither Livy We ought to hope all for the best  Olivia  And do you permit me to hope Sir Can I ever expect to be forgiven But hope has too long deceiv'd me  Croaker  Why then child it shan't deceive you now for I forgive you this very moment I forgive you all and now you are indeed my daughter  Olivia  O transport This kindess overpowers me  Croaker  I was always against severity to our children We have been young and giddy ourselves and we can't expect boys and girls to be old before their time  Olivia  What generosity But can you forget the many falshoods the dissimulation  Croaker  You did indeed dissemble you urchin you but where's the girl that won't dissemble for an husband My wife and I had never been married if we had not dissembled a little before hand  Olivia  It shall be my future care never to put such generosity to a second trial And as for the partner of my offence and folly from his native honour and the just sense he has of his duty I can answer for him that  Enter LEONTINE  Leont  Permit him thus to answer for himself  Kneeling  Thus Sir let me speak my gratitude for this unmerited forgiveness Yes Sir this even exceeds all your former tenderness I now can boast the most indulgent of fathers The life he gave compared to this was but a trifling blessing  Croaker  And good Sir who sent for you with that fine tragedy face and flourishing manner I don't know what we have to do with your gratitude upon this occasion  Leont  How Sir is it possible to be silent when so much oblig'd Would you refuse me the pleasure of being grateful Of adding my thanks to my Olivia's Of sharing in the transports that you have thus occasion'd  Croaker  Lord Sir we can be happy enough without your coming in to make up the party I don't know what's the matter with the boy all this day he has got into such a rhodomontade manner all the morning  Leont  But Sir I that have so large a part in the benefit is it not my duty to shew my joy Is the being admitted to your favour so slight an obligation Is the happiness of marrying my Olivia so small a blessing  Croaker  Marrying Olivia marrying Olivia marrying his own sister Sure the boy is out of his senses His own sister  Leont  My sister  Olivia  Sister How have I been mistaken  Aside  Leont  Some curs'd mistake in all this I find  Aside  Croaker  What does the booby mean or has he any meaning Eh what do you mean you blockhead you  Leont  Mean Sirwhy Sironly when my sister is to be married that I have the pleasure of marrying her Sir that is of giving her away SirI have made a point of it  Croaker  O is that all Give her away You have made a point of it Then you had as good make a point of first giving away yourself as I'm going to prepare the writings between you and miss Richland this very minute What a fuss is here about nothing Why what's the matter now I thought I had made you at least as happy as you could wish  Olivia  O yes Sir very happy  Croaker  Do you foresee any thing child You look as if you did I think if any thing was to be foreseen I have as sharp a look out as another and yet I foresee nothing  Exit  LEONTINE OLIVIA  Olivia  What can it mean  Leont  He knows something and yet for my life I can't tell what  Olivia  It can't be the connexion between us I'm pretty certain  Leont  Whatever it be my dearest I'm resolv'd to put it out of Fortune's power to repeat our mortification I'll haste and prepare for our journey to Scotland this very evening My friend Honeywood has promis'd me his advice and assistance I'll go to him and repose our distresses on his friendly bosom and I know so much of his honest heart that if he can't relieve our uneasinesses he will at least share them  Exeunt  END OE THE SECOND ACT  ACT THE THIRD  SCENE Young Honeywood's House  BAILIFF HONEYWOOD FOLLOWER  Bailiff  Looky Sir I have arrested as good men as you in my time no disparagement of you neither Men that would go forty guineas on a game of cribbage I challenge the town to shew a man in more genteeler practice than myself  Honeyw  Without all question MrI forget your name Sir  Bailiff  How can you forget what you never knew he he he  Honeyw  May I beg leave to ask your name  Bailiff  Yes you may  Honeyw  Then pray Sir what is your name Sir  Bailiff  That I didn't promise to tell you He he he A joke breaks no bones as we say among us that practice the law  Honeyw  You may have reason for keeping it a secret perhaps  Bailiff  The law does nothing without reason I'm asham'd to tell my name to no man Sir If you can shew cause as why upon a special capus that I should prove my name But come Timothy Twitch is my name And now you know my name what have you to say to that  Honeyw  Nothing in the world good Mr Twitch but that I have a favour to ask that's all  Bailiff  Ay favours are more easily asked than granted as we say among us that practice the law I have taken an oath against granting favours Would you have me perjure myself  Honeyw  But my request will come recommended in so strong a manner as I believe you'll have no  scruple  pulling out his purse  The thing is only this I believe I shall be able to discharge this trifle in two or three days at farthest but as I would not have the affair known for the world I have thought of keeping you and your good friend here about me till the debt is discharged for which I shall be properly grateful  Bailiff  Oh that's another maxum and altogether within my oath For certain if an honest man is to get any thing by a thing there's no reason why all things should not be done in civility  Honeyw  Doubtless all trades must live Mr Twitch and your's is a necessary one  Gives him money  Bailiff  Oh your honour I hope your honour takes nothing amiss as I does as I does nothing but my duty in so doing I'm sure no man can say I ever give a gentleman that was a gentleman ill usage If I saw that a gentleman was a gentleman I have taken money not to see him for ten weeks together  Honeyw  Tenderness is a virtue Mr Twitch  Bailiff  Ay Sir its a perfect treasure I love to see a gentleman with a tender heart I don't know but I think I have a tender heart myself If all that I have lost by my heart was put together it would make abut no matter for that  Honeyw  Don't account it lost Mr Twitch The ingratitude of the world can never deprive us of the conscious happiness of having acted with humanity ourselves  Bailiff  Humanity Sir is a jewel Its better than gold I love humanity People may say that we in our way have no humanity but I'll shew you my humanity this moment There's my follower here little Flanigan with a wife and four children a guinea or two would be more to him than twice as much to another Now as I can't shew him any humanity myself I must beg leave you'll do it for me  Honeyw  I assure you Mr Twitch your's is a most powerful recommendation  giving money to the follower  Bailiff  Sir you're a gentleman I see you know what to do with your money But to business we are to be with you here as your friends I suppose But set in case company comesLittle Flanigan here to be sure has a good face a very good face but then he is a little seedy as we say among us that practice the law Not well in cloaths Smoke the pocket holes  Honeyw  Well that shall be remedied without delay  Enter SERVANT  Servant  Sir Miss Richland is below  Honeyw  How unlucky Detain her a moment We must improve my good friend Little Mr Flanigan's appearance first Here let little Mr Flanigan have a suit of my cloathsquickthe brown and silverDo you hear  Servant  That your honour gave away to the begging gentleman that makes verses because it was as good as new  Honeyw  The white and gold then  Servant  That your honour I made bold to sell because it was good for nothing  Honeyw  Well the first that comes to hand then The blue and gold I believe Mr Flanigan will look best in blue  Exit Flanigan  Bailiff  Rabbit me but little Flanigan will look well in any thing Ah if your honour knew that bit of flesh as well as I do you'd be perfectly in love with him There's not a prettyer scout in the four counties after a shycock than he Scents like a hound sticks like a weazle He was master of the ceremonies to the black queen of Moroco when I took him to follow me Heh ecod I think he looks so well that I don't care if I have a suit from the same place for myself  Honeyw  Well well I hear the lady coming Dear Mr Twitch I beg you'll give your friend directions  not to speak As for yourself I know you will say nothing without being directed  Bailiff  Never you fear me I'll shew the Lady that I have something to say for myself as well as another One man has one way of talking and another man has another that's all the difference between them  Enter Miss RICHLAND and her MAID  Miss Rich  You'll be surprised Sir with this visit But you know I'm yet to thank you for chusing my little library  Honeyw  Thanks Madam are unnecessary as it was I that was obliged by your commands Chairs here Two of my very good friends Mr Twitch and Mr Flanigan Pray gentlemen sit without ceremony  Miss Rich  Who can these odd looking men be I fear it is as I was informed It must be so  Aside  Bailiff  after a pause  Pretty weather very pretty weather for the time of the year Madam  Follower  Very good circuit weather in the country  Honeyw  You officers are generally favourites among the ladies My friends Madam have been upon very disagreeable duty I assure you The fair should in some measure recompence the toils of the brave  Miss Rich  Our officers do indeed deserve every favour The gentlemen are in the marine service I presume Sir  Honeyw  Why Madam they dooccasionally serve in the Fleet Madam A dangerous service  Miss Rich  I'm told so And I own it has often surprised me that while we have had so many instances of bravery there we have had so few of wit at home to praise it  Honeyw  I grant Madam that our poets have not written as our soldiers have fought but they have done all they could and Hawke or Amherst could do no more  Miss Rich  I'm quite displeased when I see a fine subject spoiled by a dull writer  Honeyw  We should not be so severe against dull writers Madam It is ten to one but the dullest writer exceeds the most rigid French critic who presumes to despise him  Follower  Damn the French the parle vous and all that belongs to them  Miss Rich  Sir  Honeyw  Ha ha ha honest Mr Flanigan A true English officer Madam he's not contented with beating the French but he will scold them too  Miss Rich  Yet Mr Honeywood this does not convince me but that severity in criticism is necessary It was our first adopting the severity of French taste that has brought them in turn to taste us  Bailiff  Taste us By the Lord Madam they devour us Give Monseers but a taste and I'll be damn'd but they come in for a bellyful  Miss Rich  Very extraordinary this  Follower  But very true What makes the bread rising the parle vous that devour us What makes the mutton fivepence a pound the parle vous that eat it up What makes the beer three pence halfpenny a pot  Honeyw  Ah the vulgar rogues all will be out Right gentlemen very right upon my word and quite to the purpose They draw a parallel Madam between the mental taste and that of our senses We are injur'd as much by French severity in the one as by French rapacity in the other That's their meaning  Miss Rich  Tho' I don't see the force of the parallel yet I'll own that we should sometimes pardon books as we do our friends that have now and then agreeable absurdities to recommend them  Bailiff  That's all my eye The King only can pardon as the law says for set in  ase  Honeyw  I'm quite of your opinion Sir I see the the whole drift of your argument Yes certainly  our presuming to pardon any work is arrogating a power that belongs to another If all have power to condemn what writer can be free  Bailiff  By his habus corpus His habus corpus can set him free at any time For set in case  Honeyw  I'm obliged to you Sir for the hint If Madam as my friend observes our laws are so careful of a gentleman's person sure we ought to be equally careful of his dearer part his fame  Follower  Ay but if so be a man's nabb'd you know  Honeyw  Mr Flanigan if you speak for ever you could not improve the last observation For my own part I think it conclusive  Bailiff  As for the matter of that mayhap  Honeyw  Nay Sir give me leave in this instance to be positive For where is the necessity of censuring works without genius which must shortly sink of themselves what is it but aiming our unnecessary blow against a victim already under the hands of justice  Bailiff  Justice O by the eleven if you talk about justice I think I am at home there for in a course of law  Honeyw  My dear Mr Twitch I discern what you'd be at perfectly and I believe the lady must be sensible of the art with which it is introduced I suppose you perceive the meaning Madam of his course of law  Miss Rich  I protest Sir I do not I perceive only that you answer one gentleman before he has finished and the other before he has well begun  Bailiff  Madam you are a gentlewoman and I will make the matter out This here question is about severity and justice and pardon and the like of they Now to explain the thing  Honeyw  O curse your explanations  Aside  Enter SERVANT  Servant  Mr Leontine Sir below desires to speak with you upon earnest business  Honeyw  That's lucky  aside  Dear Madam you'll excuse me and my good friends here sor a few minutes There are books Madam to amuse you Come gentlemen you know I make no ceremony with such friends After you Sir Excuse me Well if I must But I know your natural politeness  Bailiff  Before and behind you know  Follower  Ay ay before and behind before and behind  Exeunt Honeywood Bailiff and Follower  Miss Rich  What can all this mean Garnet  Garnet  Mean Madam why what should it mean but what Mr Lofty sent you here to see These people he calls officers are officers sure enough sheriff's officers bailiffs Madam  Miss Rich  Ay it is certainly so Well tho' his perplexities are far from giving me pleasure yet I own there's something very ridiculous in them and a just punishment for his dissimulation  Garnet  And so they are But I wonder Madam that the lawyer you just employed to pay his debts and set him free has not done it by this time He ought at least to have been here before now But lawyers are always more ready to get a man into troubles than out of them  Enter SIR WILLIAM  Sir Will  For Miss Richland to undertake setting him free I own was quite unexpected It has totally unhinged my schemes to reclaim him Yet it gives me pleasure to find that among a number of worthless friendships he has made one acquisition of real value for there must be some softer passion on her side that prompts this generosity Ha here before me I'll endeavour to sound her affections  Madam as I am the person that have had some demands upon the gentleman of this house I hope you'll excuse me if before I enlarged him I wanted to see yourself  Miss Rich  The precaution was very unnecessary Sir I suppose your wants were only such as my agent had power to satisfy  Sir Will  Partly Madam But I was also willing you should be fully apprized of the character of the gentleman you intended to serve  Miss Rich  It must come Sir with a very ill grace from you To censure it after what you have done would look like malice and to speak favourably of a character you have oppressed would be impeaching your own And sure his tenderness his humanity his universal friendship may atone for many faults  Sir Will  That friendship Madam which is exerted in too wide a sphere become totally useless Our bounty like a drop of water disappears when diffused too widely They who pretend most to this universal benevolence are either deceivers or dupes Men who desire to cover their private illnature by a pretended regard for all or men who reasoning themselves into false feelings are more earnest in pursuit of splendid than of useful virtues  Miss Rich  I am surprised Sir to hear one who has probably been a gainer by the folly of others so fevere in his censure of it  Sir Will  Whatever I may have gained by folly Madam you see I am willing to prevent your losing by it  Miss Rich  Your cares for me Sir are unnecessary I always suspect those services which are denied where they are wanted and offered perhaps in hopes of a refusal No Sir my directions have been given and I insist upon their being complied with  Sir Will  Thou amiable woman I can no longer contain the expressions of my gratitude my pleasure You see before you one who has been equally careful of his interest one who has for some time  been a concealed spectator of his follies and only punished in hopes to reclaim themHis uncle  Miss Rich  Sir William Honeywood You amaze me How shall I conceal my confusion I fear Sir you'll think I have been too forward in my services I confess I  Sir Will  Don't make any apologies Madam I only find myself unable to repay the obligation And yet I have been trying my interest of late to serve you Having learnt Madam that you had some demands upon government I have tho' unasked been your solicitor there  Miss Rich  Sir I'm infinitely obliged to your intentions But my guardian has employed another gentleman who assures him of success  Sir Will  Who the important little man that visits here Trust me Madam he's quite contemptible among men in power and utterly unable to serve you Mr Lofty's promises are much better known to people of fashion than his person I assure you  Miss Rich  How have we been deceived As sure as can be here he comes  Sir Will  Does he Remember I'm to continue unknown My return to England has not as yet been made public With what impudence he enters  Enter LOFTY  Lofty  Let the chariotlet my chariot drive off I'll visit to his grace's in a chair Miss Richland here before me Punctual as usual to the calls of humanity I'm very sorry Madam things of this kind should happen especially to a man I have shewn every where and carried amongst us as a particular acquaintance  Miss Rich  I find Sir you have the art of making the misfortunes of others your own  Lofty  My dear Madam what can a private man like me do One man can't do every thing and then I do so much in this way every day Let me see something considerable might be done for him  by subscription it could not fail if I carried the list I'll undertake to set down a brace of Dukes two dozen Lords and half the lower house at my own peril  Sir Will  And after all its more than probable Sir he might reject the offer of such powerful patronage  Lofty  Then Madam what can we do You know I never make promises In truth I once or twice tried to do something with him in the way of business but as I often told his uncle Sir William Honeywood the man was utterly impracticable  Sir Will  His uncle then that gentleman I suppose is a particular friend of yours  Lofty  Meaning me SirYes Madam as I often said my dear Sir William you are sensible I would do any thing as far as my poor interest goes to serve your family but what can be done there's no procuring first rate places for ninth rate abilities  Miss Rich  I have heard of Sir William Honeywood he's abroad in employment he confided in your judgement I suppose  Lofty  Why yes Madam I believe Sir William had some reason to confide in my judgement one little reason perhaps  Miss Rich  Pray Sir what was it  Lofty  Why Madam but let it go no further it was I procured him his place  Sir Will  Did you Sir  Lofty  Either you or I Sir  Miss Rich  This Mr Lofty was very kind indeed  Lofty  I did love him to be sure he had some amusing qualities no man was fitter to be toastmaster to a club or had a better head  Miss Rich  A better head  Lofty  Ay at a bottle to be sure he was as dull as a choice spirit but hang it he was grateful very grateful and gratitude hides a multitude of faults  Sir Will  He might have reason perhaps His place is pretty considerable I'm told  Lofty  A trifle a mere trifle among us of business the truth is he wanted dignity to fill up a greater  Sir Will  Dignity of person do you mean Sir I'm told he's much about my size and figure Sir  Lofty  Ay tall enough for a marching regiment but then he wanted a somethinga consequence of forma kind of aI believe the Lady perceives my meaning  Miss Rich  O perfectly you courtiers can do any thing I see  Lofty  My dear Madam all this is but a mere exchange we do greater things for one another every day Why as thus now let me suppose you the first lord of the treasury you have an employment in you that I want I have a place in me that you want do me here do you there interest of both sides few words flat done and done and its over  Sir Will  A thought strikes me  Aside  Now you mention Sir William Honeywood Madam and as he seems Sir an acquaintance of yours you'll be glad to hear he's arrived from Italy I had it from a friend who knows him as well as he does me and you may depend on my information  Lofty  The devil he is If I had known that we should not have been quite so well acquainted  Aside  Sir Will  He is certainly return'd and as this gentleman is a friend of yours he can be of signal service to us by introducing me to him there are some papers relative to your affairs that require dispatch and his inspection  Miss Rich  This gentleman Mr Lofty is a person employed in my affairs I know you'll serve us  Lofty  My dear Madam I live but to serve you Sir William shall even wait upon him if you think proper to command it  Sir Will  That would be quite unnecessary  Lofty  Well we must introduce you then Call upon melet me seeay in two days  Sir Will  Now or the opportunity will be lost for ever  Lofty  Well if it must be now now let it be But damn it that's unfortunate my lord Grig's curs'd Pensacola business comes on this very hour and I'm engaged to attendanother time  Sir Will  A short letter to Sir William will do  Lofty  You shall have it yet in my opinion a letter is a very bad way of going to work face to face that's my way  Sir Will  The letter Sir will do quite as well  Lofty  Zounds Sir do you pretend to direct me direct me in the business of office do you know me Sir who am I  Miss Rich  Dear Mr Lofty this request is not so much his as mine if my commandsbut you despise my power  Lofty  Delicate creature your commands could even controle a debate at midnight to a power so constitutional I am all obedience and tranquility He shall have a letter where is my secretary Dubardieu And yet I protest I don't like this way of doing business I think if I spoke first to Sir WilliamBut you will have it so  Exit with Miss Rich  SIR WILLIAM alone  Sir Will  Ha ha ha This too is one of my nephew's hopeful associates O vanity thou constant deceiver how do all thy efforts to exalt serve but to sink us Thy false colourings like those employed to heighten beauty only seem to mend that bloom which they contribute to destroy I'm not displeased at this interview exposing this fellow's impudence to the contempt it deserves may be of use to my design at least if he can reflect it will be of use to himself  Enter JARVIS  Sir Will  How now Jarvis where's your master my nephew  Jarvis  At his wits end I believe he's scarce gotten out of one scrape but he's running his head into another  Sir Will  How so  Jarvis  The house has but just been cleared of the bailiffs and now he's again engaging tooth and nail in assisting old Croaker's son to patch up a clandestine match with the young lady that passes in the house for his sister  Sir Will  Ever busy to serve others  Jarvis  Ay any body but himself The young couple it seems are just setting out for Scotland and he supplies them with money for the journey  Sir Will  Money how is he able to supply others who has scarce any for himself  Jarvis  Why there it is he has no money that's true but then as he never said no to any request in his life he has given them a bill drawn by a friend of his upon a merchant in the city which I am to get chang'd for you must know that I am to go with them to Scotland myself  Sir Will  How  Jarvis  It seems the young gentleman is obliged to take a different road from his mistress as he is to call upon an uncle of his that lives out of the way in order to prepare a place for their reception when they return so they have borrowed me from my master as the properest person to attend the young lady down  Sir Will  To the land of matrimony A pleasant journey Jarvis  Jarvis  Ay but I'm only to have all the fatigues on't  Sir Will  Well it may be shorter less fatiguing than you imagine I know but too much of the young lady's family and connexions whom I have  seen abroad I have also discover'd that Miss Richland is not indifferent to my thoughtless nephew and he endeavours tho' I fear in vain to establish that connexion But come the letter I wait for must be almost finish'd I'll let you further into my intentions in the next room  Exeunt  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT THE FOURTH  SCENE Croaker's House  LOFTY  Lofty  Well sure the devil's in me of late for running my head into such defiles as nothing but a genius like my own could draw me from I was formerly contented to husband out my places and pensions with some degree of frugality but curse it of late I have given away the whole Court Register in less time than they could print the title page yet hang it why scruple a lie or two to come at a fine girl when I every day tell a thousand for nothing Ha Honeywood here before Could Miss Richland have set him at liberty  Enter HONEYWOOD  Mr Honeywood I'm glad to see you abroad again I find my concurrence was not necessary in your unfortunate affairs I had put things in a train to do your business but it is not for me to say what I intended doing  Honeyw  It was unfortunate indeed Sir But what adds to my uneasiness is that while you seem to be acquainted with my misfortune I myself continue still a stranger to my benefactor  Lofty  How not know the friend that served you  Honeyw  Can't guess at the person  Lofty  Enquire  Honeyw  I have but all I can learn is that he chuses to remain concealed and that all enquiry must be fruitless  Lofty  Must be fruitless  Honeyw  Absolutely fruitless  Lofty  Sure of that  Honyw  Very sure  Lofty  Then I'll be damn'd if you shall ever know it from me  Honeyw  How Sir  Lofty  I suppose now Mr Honeywood you think my rentroll very considerable and that I have vast sums of money to throw away I know you do The world to be sure says such things of me  Honeyw  The world by what I learn is no stranger to your generosity But where does this tend  Lofty  To nothing nothing in the world The town to be sure when it makes such a thing as me the subject of conversation has asserted that I never yet patronized a man of merit  Honeyw  I have heard instances to the contrary even from yourself  Lofty  Yes Honeywood and there are instances to the contrary that you shall never hear from myself  Honeyw  Ha dear Sir permit me to ask you but one question  Lofty  Sir ask me no questions I say Sir ask me no questions I'll be damn'd if I answer them  Honeyw  I will ask no further My friend my benefactor it is it must be here that I am indebted for freedom for honour Yes thou worthiest of men from the beginning I suspected it but was afraid to return thanks which if undeserved might seem reproaches  Lofty  I protest I don't understand all this Mr Honeywood You treat me very cavalierly I do assure you SirBlood Sir can't a man be permitted to enjoy the luxury of his own feelings without all this parade  Honeyw  Nay do not attempt to conceal an action that adds to your honour Your looks your air your manner all confess it  Lofty  Confess it Sir Torture itself Sir shall never bring me to confess it Mr Honeywood I have admitted you upon terms of friendship Don't let us fall out make me happy and let this be buried in oblivion You know I hate ostentation  you know I do Come come Honeywood you know I always lov'd to be a friend and not a patron I beg this may make no kind of distance between us Come come you and I must be more familiarIndeed we must  Honeyw  Heavens Can I ever repay such friendship Is there any way Thou best of men can I ever return the obligation  Lofty  A bagatelle a mere bagatelle But I see your heart is labouring to be grateful You shall be grateful It would be cruel to disappoint you  Honeyw  How Teach me the manner Is there any way  Lofty  From this moment you're mine Yes my friend you shall know itI'm in love  Honeyw  And can I assist you  Lofty  Nobody so well  Honeyw  In what manner I'm all impatience  Lofty  You shall make love for me  Honeyw  And to whom shall I speak in your favour  Lofty  To a lady with whom you have great interest I assure you Miss Richland  Honeyw  Miss Richland  Lofty  Yes Miss Richland She has struckthe blow up to the hilt in my bosom by Jupiter  Honeyw  Heavens was ever any thing more unfortunate It is too much to be endur'd  Lofty  Unfortunate indeed And yet I can endure it till you have opened the affair to her for me Between ourselves I think she likes me I'm not apt to boast but I think she does  Honeyw  Indeed But do you know the person you apply to  Lofty  Yes I know you are her friend and mine that's enough To you therefore I commit the success of my passion I'll say no more let friendship do the rest I have only to add that if at any time my little interest can be of servicebut hang it I'll make no promisesyou know my interest is your's at any time No apologies my friend I'll not be answered it shall be so  Exit  Honeyw  Open generous unsuspecting man He little thinks that I love her too and with such an ardent passionBut then it was ever but a vain and hopeless one My torment my persecution what shall I do Love friendship a hopeless passion a deserving friend Love that has been my tormentor a friend that has perhaps distress'd himself to serve me It shall be so Yes I will discard the fondling hope from my bosom and exert all my influence in his favour And yet to see her in the possession of anotherInsupportable But then to betray a generous trusty friendWorse worse Yes I'm resolv'd Let me but be the instrument of their happiness and then quit a country where I must for ever despair of finding my own  Exit  Enter OLIVIA and GARNET who carries a Milliner's Box  Olivia  Dear me I wish this journey were over No news of Jarvis yet I believe the old peevish creature delays purely to vex me  Garnet  Why to be sure Madam I did hear him say a little snubbing before marriage would teach you to bear it the better afterwards  Olivia  To be gone a full hour tho' he had only to get a bill changed in the city How provoking  Garnet  I'll lay my life Mr Leontine that had twice as much to do is setting off by this time from his inn and here you are left behind  Olivia  Well let us be prepar'd for his coming however Are you sure you have omitted nothing Garnet  Garnet  Not a stick madamall's here Yet I wish you could take the white and silver to be married in It's the worst luck in the world in any thing but white I knew one Bett Stubbs of our town was married in red and as sure as eggs is eggs the bridegroom and she had a miff before morning  Olivia  No matter I'm all impatience till we are out of the house  Garnet  Bless me madam I had almost forgot the wedding ringThe sweet little thingI don't think it would go on my little finger And what if I put in a gentleman's night cap in case of necessity madam But here's Jarvis  Enter JARVIS  Olivia  O Jarvis are you come at last We have been ready this half hour Now let's be going Let us fly  Jarvis  Aye to Jericho for we shall have no going to Scotland this bout I fancy  Olivia  How What's the matter  Jarvis  Money money is the matter Madam We have got no money What the plague do you send me of your fool's errand for My master's bill upon the city is not worth a rush Here it is Mrs Garnet may pin up her hair with it  Olivia  Undone How could Honeywood serve us so What shall we do Can't we go without it  Jarvis  Go to Scotland without money To Scotland without money Lord how some people understand geography We might as well set sail for Patagonia upon a cork jacket  Olivia  Such a disappointment What a base insincere man was your master to serve us in this manner Is this his good nature  Jarvis  Nay don't talk ill of my master Madam I won't bear to hear any body talk ill of him but myself  Garnet  Bless us now I think on't Madam you need not be under any uneasiness I saw Mr Leontine receive forty guineas from his father just before he set out and he can't yet have left the inn A short letter will reach him there  Olivia  Well remember'd Garnet I'll write immediately How's this Bless me my hand trembles so I can't write a word Do you write Garnet and upon second thought it will be better from you  Garnet  Truly madam I write and indite but poorly I never was kute at my larning But I'll do  what I can to please you Let me see All out of my own head I suppose  Olivia  Whatever you please  Garnet  Writing  Muster Croaker Twenty guineas Madam  Olivia  Ay twenty will do  Garnet  At the bar of the Talbot till call'd for Expeditionwill be blown upAll of a flame Quick dispatchCupid the little God of LoveI conclude it madam with Cupid I love to see a love letter end like poetry  Olivia  Well well what you please any thing But how shall we send it I can trust none of the fervants of this family  Garnet  Odso Madam Mr Honeywood's butler is in the next room he's a dear sweet man he'll do any thing for me  Jarvis  He the dog he'll certainly commit some blunder He's drunk and sober ten times a day  Olivia  No matter Fly Garnet any body we can trust will do  Exit Garnet  Well Jarvis now we can have nothing more to interrupt us You may take up the things and carry them on to the inn Have you no hands Jarvis  Jarvis  Soft and fair young lady You that are going to be married think things can never be done too fast but we that are old and know what we are about must elope methodically Madam  Olivia  Well sure if my indiscretions were to be done over again  Jarvis  My life for it you would do them ten times over  Olivia  Why will you talk so If you knew how unhappy they make me  Jarvis  Very unhappy no doubt I was once just as unhappy when I was going to be married myself I'll tell you a story about that  Olivia  A story when I'm all impatience to be away Was there ever such a dilatory creature  Jarvis  Well Madam if we must march why we will march that's all Tho' odds bobs we have still  forgot one thing we should never travel withouta case of good razors and a box of shavingpowder But no matter I believe we shall be pretty well shaved in Scotland  Going  Enter GARNET  Garnet  Undone undone Madam Ah Mr Jarvis you said right enough As sure as death Mr Honeywood's rogue of a drunken butler drop'd the letter before he went ten yards from the door There's old Croaker has just pick'd it up and is this moment reading it to himself in the hall  Olivia  Unfortunate We shall be discover'd  Garnet  No Madam don't be uneasy he can make neither head nor tail of it To be sure he looks as if he was broke loose from Bedlam about it but he can't find what it means for all that O Lud he is coming this way all in the horrors  Olivia  Then let us leave the house this instant for fear he should ask farther questions In the mean time Garnet do you write and send off just such another  Exeunt  Enter CROAKER  Croaker  Death and destruction Are all the horrors of air fire and water to be levelled only at me Am I only to be singled out for gunpowderplots combustibles and conflagration Here it isAn incendiary letter drop'd at my door  To Muster Croaker these with speed  Ay ay plain enough the direction all in the genuine incendiary spelling and as cramp as the devil  With speed  O confound your speed But let me read it once more  Reads  Mustar Croakar as sone as yoew see this leve twenty gunnes at the bar of the Talboot tell caled for or yowe and yower experetion will be al blown up  Ah but too plain Blood and gunpowder in every line of it Blown up murderous dog All blown up Heavens what have I and my poor family done to be all blown up  reads  Our pockets are low and money we must have  Ay there's the reason they'll  blow us up because they have got low pockets  Reads  It is but a short time you have to consider for if this takes wind the house will quickly be all of a flame  Inhuman monsters blow us up and then burn us The earthquake at Lisbon was but a bonfire to it  Reads  Make quick dispatch and so no more at present But may Cupid the little God of Love go with you wherever you go  The little God of Love Cupid the little God of Love go with me Go you to the devil you and your little Cupid together I'm so frightned I scarce know whether I sit stand or go Perhaps this moment I'm treading on lighted matches blazing brimstone and barrels of gunpowder They are preparing to blow me up into the clouds Murder We shall be all burnt in our beds we shall be all burnt in our beds  Enter Miss RICHLAND  Miss Rich  Lord Sir what's the matter  Croaker  Murder's the matter We shall be a blown up in our beds before morning  Miss Rich  I hope not Sir  Croaker  What signifies what you hope Madam when I have a certificate of it here in my hand Will nothing alarm my family Sleeping and eating sleeping and eating is the only work from morning till night in my house My insensible crew could sleep tho' rock'd by an earthquake and fry beef steaks at a volcano  Miss Rich  But Sir you have alarmed them so often already we have nothing but earthquakes famines plagues and mad dogs from year's end to year's end You remember Sir it is not above a month ago you assur'd us of a conspiracy among the bakers to poison us in our bread and so kept the whole family a week upon potatoes  Croaker  And potatoes were too good for them But why do I stand talking here with a girl when I should be facing the enemy without Here John Nicodemus search the house Look into the cellars to see if there be any combustibles below and above  in the apartments that no matches be thrown in at the windows Let all the fires be put out and let the engine be drawn out in the yard to play upon the house in case of necessity  Exit  Miss RICHLAND alone  Miss Rich  What can he mean by all this Yet why should I enquire when he alarms us in this manner almost every day But Honeywood has desired an interview with me in private What can he mean or rather what means this palpitation at his approach It is the first time he ever shewed any thing in his conduct that seem'd particular Sure he cannot mean tobut he's here  Enter HONEYWOOD  Honeyw  I presum'd to solicit this interview Madam before I left town to be permitted  Miss Rich  Indeed Leaving town Sir  Honeyw  Yes Madam perhaps the kingdom I have presumed I say to desire the favour of this interviewin order to disclose something which our long friendship prompts And yet my fears  Miss Rich  His fears What are his fears to mine  Aside  We have indeed been long acquainted Sir very long If I remember our first meeting was at the French ambassador'sDo you recollect how you were pleas'd to rally me upon my complexion there  Honeyw  Perfectly madam I presum'd to reprove you for painting but your warmer blushes soon convinc'd the company that the colouring was all from nature  Miss Rich  And yet you only meant it in your good natur'd way to make me pay a compliment to myself In the same manner you danc'd that night with the most aukward woman in company because you saw nobody else would take her out  Honeyw  Yes and was rewarded the next night by dancing with the finest woman in company that every body wish'd to take out  Miss Rich  Well Sir if you thought so then I fear your judgment has since corrected the errors of a first impression We generally shew to most advantage at first Our sex are like poor tradesmen that put all their best goods to be seen at the windows  Honeyw  The first impression Madam did indeed deceive me I expected to find a woman with all the faults of conscious flattered beauty I expected to find her vain and insolent But every day has since taught me that it is possible to possess sense without pride and beauty without affectation  Miss Rich  This Sir is a style very unusual with Mr Honeywood and I should be glad to know why he thus attempts to encrease that vanity which his own lessons taught me to despise  Honeyw  I ask pardon Madam Yet from our long friendship I presumed I might have some right to offer without offence what you may refuse without offending  Miss Rich  Sir I beg you'd reflect tho' I fear I shall scarce have any power to refuse a request of yours yet you may be precipitate consider Sir  Honeyw  I own my rashness but as I plead the cause of friendship of one who lovesDon't be alarmed MadamWho loves you with the most ardent passion whose whole happiness is placed in you  Miss Rich  I fear Sir I shall never find whom you mean by this description of him  Honeyw  Ah Madam it but too plainly points him out Tho' he should be too humble himself to urge his pretensions or you too modest to understand them  Miss Rich  Well it would be affectation any longer to pretend ignorance and I will own Sir I have long been prejudiced in his favour It was but natural to wish to make his heart mine as he seem'd himself ignorant of its value  Honeyw  I see she always lov'd him  aside  I find Madam you're already sensible of his worth his  passion How happy is my friend to be the favourite of one with such sense to distinguish merit and such beauty to reward it  Miss Rich  Your friend Sir What friend  Honeyw  My best friendMy friend Mr Lofty Madam  Miss Rich  He Sir  Honeyw  Yes he Madam He is indeed what your warmest wishes might have form'd him And to his other qualities he adds that of the most passionate regard for you  Miss Rich  AmazementNo more of this I beg you Sir  Honeyw  I see your confusion Madam and know how to interpret it And since I so plainly read the language of your heart shall I make my friend happy by communicating your sentiments  Miss Rich  By no means  Honeyw  Excuse me I must I know you desire it  Miss Rich  Mr Honeywood let me tell you that you wrong my sentiments and yourself When I first applied to your friendship I expected advice and assistance but now Sir I see that it is vain to expect happiness from him who has been so bad an oeconomist of his own and that I must disclaim his friendship who ceases to be a friend to himself  Exit  Honeyw  How is this she has confessed she lov'd him and yet she seemed to part in displeasure Can I have done any thing to reproach myself with No I believe not yet after all these things should not be done by a third person I should have spared her confusion My friendship carried me a little too far  Enter CROAKER with the letter in his hand and Mrs CROAKER  Mrs Croaker  Ha ha ha And so my dear it's your supreme wish that I should be quite wretched upon this occasion Ha ha  Croaker  Mimicking  Ha ha ha and so my dear it's your supreme pleasure to give me no better consolation  Mrs Croaker  Positively my dear what is this incendiary stuff and trumpery to me Our house may travel thro' the air like the house of Loretto for ought I care If I'm to be miserable in it  Croaker  Would to Heaven it were converted into an house of correction for your benefit Have we not every thing to alarm us Perhaps this very moment the tragedy is beginning  Mrs Croaker  Then let us reserve our distress till the rising of the curtain or give them the money they want and have done with them  Croaker  Give them my moneyAnd pray what right have they to my money  Mrs Croaker  And pray what right then have you to my good humour  Croaker  And so your good humour advises me to part with my money Why then to tell your good humour a piece of my mind I'd sooner part with my wife Here's Mr Honeywood see what he'll say to it My dear Honeywood look at this incendiary letter dropped at my door It will freeze you with terror and yet lovey here can read itCan read it and laugh  Mrs Croaker  Yes and so will Mr Honeywood  Croaker  If he does I'll suffer to be hanged the next minute in the rogue's place that's all  Mrs Croaker  Speak Mr Honeywood is there any thing more foolish than my husband's fright upon this occasion  Honeyw  It would not become me to decide Madam but doubtless the greatness of his terrors now will but invite them to renew their villainy another time  Mrs Croaker  I told you he'd be of my opinion  Croaker  How Sir do you maintain that I should lie down under such an injury and shew neither by  my tears or complaints that I have something of the spirit of a man in me  Honeyw  Pardon me Sir You ought to make the loudest complaints if you desire redress The surest way to have redress is to be earnest in the pursuit of it  Croaker  Ay whose opinion is he of now  Mrs Croaker  But don't you think that laughing off our fears is the best way  Honeyw  What is the best Madam few can say but I'll maintain it to be a very wise way  Croaker  But we're talking of the best Surely the best way is to face the enemy in the field and not wait till he plunders us in our very very bedchamber  Honeyw  Why Sir as to the best thatthat's a very wise way too  Mrs Croaker  But can any thing be more absurd than to double our distresses by our apprehensions and put it in the power of every low fellow that can scrawl ten words of wretched spelling to torment us  Honeyw  Without doubt nothing more absurd  Croaker  How would it not be more absurd to despise the rattle till we are bit by the snake  Honeyw  Without doubt perfectly absurd  Croaker  Then you are of my opinion  Honeyw  Entirely  Mrs Croaker  And you reject mine  Honeyw  Heaven's forbid Madam No sure no reasoning can be more just than yours We ought certainly to dsepise malice if we cannot oppose it and not make the incendiary's pen as fatal to our repose as the highwayman's pistol  Mrs Croaker  O then you think I'm quite right  Honeyw  Perfectly right  Croaker  A plague of plagues we can't be both right I ought to be sorry or I ought to be glad My hat must be on my head or my hat must be off  Mrs Croaker  Certainly in two opposite opinions if one be perfectly reasonable the other can't be perfectly right  Honeyw  And why may not both be right Madam Mr Croaker in earnestly seeking redress and you in waiting the event with good humour Pray let me see the letter again I have it This letter requires twenty guineas to be left at the bar of the Talbot inn If it be indeed an incendiary letter what if you and I Sir go there and when the writer comes to be paid his expected booty seize him  Croaker  My dear friend its the very thing the very thing While I walk by the door you shall plant yourself in ambush near the bar burst out upon the miscreant like a masqued battery extort a confession at once and so hang him up by surprise  Honeyw  Yes but I would not chuse to exercise too much severity It is my maxim Sir that crimes generally punish themselves  Croaker  Well but we may upbraid him a little I suppose  Ironically  Honeyw  Ay but not punish him too rigidly  Croaker  Well well leave that to my own benevolence  Honeyw  Well I do but remember that universal benevolence is the first law of nature  Exeunt Honeywood and Mrs Croaker  Croaker  Yes and my universal benevolence will hang the dog if he had as many necks as a hydra  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT THE FIFTH  SCENE An Inn  Enter OLIVIA JARVIS  Olivia  Well we have got safe to the inn however Now if the postchaise were ready  Jarvis  The horses are just finishing their oats and as they are not going to be married they chuse to take their own time  Olivia  You are for ever giving wrong motives to my impatience  Jarvis  Be as impatient as you will the horses must take their own time besides you don't consider we have got no answer from our fellow traveller yet If we hear nothing from Mr Leontine we have only one way left us  Olivia  What way  Jarvis  The way home again  Olivia  Not so I have made a resolution to go and nothing shall induce me to break it  Jarvis  Ay resolutions are well kept when they jump with inclination However I'll go hasten things without And I'll call too at the bar to see if any thing should be left for us there Don't be in such a plaguy hurry Madam and we shall go the faster I promise you  Exit Jarvis  Enter LANDLADY  Landlady  What Solomon why don't you move Pipes and tobacco for the Lamb thereWill no body answer To the Dolphin quick The Angel has been outrageous this half hour Did your ladyship call Madam  Olivia  No Madam  Landlady  I find as you're for Scotland MadamBut that's no business of mine married or not married I ask no questions To be sure we had a sweet little couple set off from this two days ago for the same place The Gentleman for a Taylor was to be sure as fine a spoken taylor as ever blew froth from a full pot And the young lady so bashful it was near half an hour before we could get her to finish a pint of rasberry between us  Olivia  But this gentleman and I are not going to be married I assure you  Landlady  May be not That's no business of mine for certain Scotch marriages seldom turn out There was of my own knowledge Miss Macfag that married her father's footmanAlackaday she and her husband soon parted and now keep separate cellars in HedgeLane  Olivia  A very pretty picture of what lies before me  Aside  Enter LEONTINE  Leont  My dear Olivia my anxiety till you were out of danger was too great to be resisted I could not help coming to see you set out tho' it exposes us to a discovery  Olivia  May every thing you do prove as fortunate Indeed Leontine we have been most cruelly disappointed Mr Honeywood's bill upon the city has it seems been protested and we have been utterly at a loss how to proceed  Leont  How An offer of his own too Sure he could not mean to deceive us  Olivia  Depend upon his sincerity he only mistook the desire for the power of serving us But let us think no more of it I believe the postchaise is ready by this  Landlady  Not quite yet and begging your ladyship's pardon I don't think your ladyship quite ready for the postchaise The north road is a cold place Madam I have a drop in the house of as pretty  rasberry as ever was tipt over tongue Just a thimble full to keep the wind off your stomach To be sure the last couple we had here they said it was a perfect nosegay Ecod I sent them both away as good natur'dUp went the blinds round went the wheels and drive away postboy was the word  Enter CROAKER  Croaker  Well while my friend Honeywood is upon the post of danger at the bar it must be my business to have an eye about me here I think I know an incendiary's look for wherever the devil makes a purchase he never fails to set his mark Ha who have we here My son and daughter What can they be doing here  Landlady  I tell you Madam it will do you good I think I know by this time what's good for the north road It's a raw night MadamSir  Leont  Not a drop more good Madam I should now take it as a greater favour if you hasten the horses for I am afraid to be seen myself  Landlady  That shall be done Wha Solomon are you all dead there Wha Solomon I say  Exit Bawling  Olivia  Well I dread lest an expedition begun in fear should end in repentanceEvery moment we stay increases our danger and adds to my apprehensions  Leont  There's no danger trust me my dear there can be none if Honeywood has acted with honour and kept my father as he promised in employment till we are out of danger nothing can interrupt our journey  Olivia  I have no doubt of Mr Honeywood's sincerity and even his desires to serve us My fears are from your father's suspicions A mind so disposed to be alarmed without a cause will be but too ready when there's a reason  Leont  Why let him when we are out of his power But believe me Olivia you have no great  reason to dread his resentment His repining temper as it does no manner of injury to himself so will it never do harm to others He only frets to keep himself employed and scolds for his private amusement  Olivia  I don't know that but I'm sure on some occasions it makes him look most shockingly  Croaker  Discovering himself  How does he look nowHow does he look now  Olivia  Ah  Leont  Undone  Croaker  How do I look now Sir I am your very humble servant Madam I am your's What you are going off are you Then first if you please take a word or two from me with you before you go Tell me first where you are going and when you have told me that perhaps I shall know as little as I did before  Leont  If that be so our answer might but increase your displeasure without adding to your information  Croaker  I want no information from you puppy and you too good Madam what answer have you got Eh  a cry without stop him  I think I heard a noise My friend Honeywood withouthas he seized the incendiary Ah no for now I heard no more on't  Leont  Honeywood without Then Sir it was Mr Honeywood that directed you hither  Croaker  No Sir it was Mr Honeywood conducted me hither  Leont  Is it possible  Croaker  Possible Why he's in the house now Sir More anxious about me than my own son Sir  Leont  Then Sir he's a villian  Croaker  How sirrah a villian because he takes most care of your father I'll not bear it I tell you I'll not bear it Honeywood is a friend to the family and I'll have him treated as such  Leont  I shall study to repay his friendship as it deserves  Croaker  Ah rogue If you knew how earnestly he entered into my griefs and pointed out the means to detect them you would love him as I do  A cry without stop him  Fire and fury they have seized the incendiary they have the villian the incendiary in view Stop him stop an incendiary a murderer stop him  Exit  Olivia  Oh my terrors What can this new tumult mean  Leont  Some new mark I suppose of Mr Honeywood's sincerity But we shall have satisfaction he shall give me instant satissaction  Olivia  It must not be my Leontine if you value my esteem or my happiness Whatever be our fate let us not add guilt to our misfortunesConsider that our innocence will shortly be all we have left us You must forgive him  Leont  Forgive him Has he not in every instance betrayed us Forced me to borrow money from him which appears a mere trick to delay us promised to keep my father engaged till we were out of danger and here brought him to the very scene of our escape  Olivia  Don't be precipitate We may yet be mistaken  Enter POSTBOY dragging in JARVIS HONEYWOOD entering soon after  Postboy  Ay master we have him fast enough Here is the incendiary dog I'm entitled to the reward I'll take my oath I saw him ask for the money at the bar and then run for it  Honeyw  Come bring him along Let us see him Let him learn to blush for his crimes  Discovering his mistake  Death what's here Jarvis Leontine Olivia What can all this mean  Jarvis  Why I'll tell you what it means that I was an old fool and that you are my masterthat's all  Honeyw  Confusion  Leont  Yes Sir I find you have kept your word with me After such baseness I wonder how you can venture to see the man you have injured  Honeyw  My dear Leontine by my life my honour  Leont  Peace peace for shame and do not continue to aggravate baseness by hypocrisy I know you Sir I know you  Honeyw  Why wont you hear me By all that's just I knew not  Leont  Hear you Sir to what purpose I now see through all your low arts your ever complying with every opinion your never refusing any request your friendship as common as a prostitute's favours and as fallacious all these Sir have long been contemptible to the world and are now perfectly so to me  Honeyw  Ha contemptible to the world That reaches me  Aside  Leont  All the seeming sincerity of your professions I now find were only allurements to betray and all your seeming regret for their consequences only calculated to cover the cowardice of your heart Draw villain  Enter CROAKER out of Breath  Croaker  Where is the villain Where is the incendiary  seizing the postboy  Hold him fast the dog he has the gallows in his face Come you dog confess confess all and hang yourself  PostBoy  Zounds Master what do you throttle me for  Croaker  Beating him  Dog do you resist do you resist  PostBoy  Zounds Master I'm not he there's the man that we thought was the rogue and turns out to be one of the company  Croaker  How  Honeyw  Mr Croaker we have all been under a strange mistake here I find there is nobody guilty it was all an error entirely an error of our own  Croaker  And I say Sir that you're in an error for there's guilt and double guilt a plot a damn'd jesuitical pestilential plot and I must have proof of it  Honeyw  Do but hear me  Croaker  What you intend to bring'em off I suppose I'll hear nothing  Honeyw  Madam you seem at least calm enough to hear reason  Olivia  Excuse me  Honeyw  Good Jarvis let me then explain it to you  Jarvis  What signifies explanations when the thing is done  Honeyw  Will nobody hear me Was there ever such a set so blinded by passion and prejudice  To the PostBoy  My good friend I believe you'll be surprized when I assure you  PostBoy  Sure me nothingI'm sure of nothing but a good beating  Croaker  Come then you Madam if you ever hope for any favour or forgiveness tell me sincerely all you know of this affair  Olivia  Unhappily Sir I'm but too much the cause of your suspicions you see before you Sir one that with false pretences has stept into your family to betray it not your daughter  Croaker  Not my daughter  Olivia  Not your daughterbut a mean deceiverwhosupport me I cannot  Honeyw  Help she's going give her air  Croaker  Ay ay take the young woman to the air I would not hurt a hair of her head whose ever daughter she may benot so bad as that neither  Exeunt all but Croaker  Croaker  Yes yes all's out I now see the whole affair my son is either married or going to be so  to this lady whom he imposed upon me as his sister Ay certainly so and yet I don't find it afflicts me so much as one might think There's the advantage of fretting away our misfortunes beforehand we never feel them when they come  Enter Miss RICHLAND and SIR WILLIAM  Sir Will  But how do you know Madam that my nephew intends setting off from this place  Miss Rich  My maid assured me he was come to this inn and my own knowledge of his intending to leave the kingdom suggested the rest But what do I see my guardian here before us Who my dear Sir could have expected meeting you here to what accident do we owe this pleasure  Croaker  To a fool I believe  Miss Rich  But to what purpose did you come  Croaker  To play the fool  Miss Rich  But with whom  Croaker  With greater fools than myself  Miss Rich  Explain  Croaker  Why Mr Honeywood brought me here to do nothing now I am here and my son is going to be married to I don't know who that is here so now you are as wise as I am  Miss Rich  Married to whom Sir  Croaker  To Olivia my daughter as I took her to be but who the devil she is or whose daughter she is I know no more than the man in the moon  Sir Will  Then Sir I can inform you and tho' a stranger yet you shall find me a friend to your family it will be enough at present to assure you that both in point of birth and fortune the young lady is at least your son's equal Being left by her father Sir James Woodville  Croaker  Sir James Woodville What of the West  Sir Will  Being left by him I say to the care of a mercenary wretch whose only aim was to secure her fortune to himself she was sent into France under pretence of education and there every art  was tried to fix her for life in a convent contrary to her inclinations Of this I was informed upon my arrival at Paris and as I had been once her father's friend I did all in my power to frustrate her guardian's base intentions I had even meditated to rescue her from his authority when your son stept in with more pleasing violence gave her liberty and you a daughter  Croaker  But I intend to have a daughter of my own chusing Sir A young lady Sir whose fortune by my interest with those that have interest will be double what my son has a right to expect Do you know Mr Lofty Sir  Sir Will  Yes Sir and know that you are deceived in him But step this way and I'll convince you  Croaker and Sir William seem to confer  Enter HONEYWOOD  Honeyw  Obstinate man still to persist in his outrage Insulted by him despis'd by all I now begin to grow contemptible even to myself How have I sunk by too great an assiduity to please How have I overtax'd all my abilities lest the approbation of a single fool should escape me But all is now over I have survived my reputation my fortune my friendships and nothing remains henceforward for me but solitude and repentance  Miss Rich  Is it true Mr Honeywood that you are setting off without taking leave of your friends The report is that you are quitting England Can it be  Honeyw  Yes Madam and tho' I am so unhappy as to have fallen under your displeasure yet thank Heaven I leave you to happiness to one who loves you and deserves your love to one who has power to procure you affluence and generosity to improve your enjoyment of it  Miss Rich  And are you sure Sir that the gentleman you mean is what you describe him  Honeyw  I have the best assurances of it his serving me He does indeed deserve the highest happiness and that is in your power to confer As for me weak and wavering as I have been obliged by all and incapable of serving any what happiness can I find but in solitude What hope but in being forgotten  Miss Rich  A thousand to live among friends that esteem you whose happiness it will be to be permitted to oblige you  Honeyw  No Madam my resolution is fix'd Inferiority among strangers is easy but among those that once were equals insupportable Nay to shew you how far my resolution can go I can now speak with calmness of my former follies my vanity my dissipation my weakness I will even confess that among the number of my other presumptions I had the insolence to think of loving you Yes Madam while I was pleading the passion of another my heart was tortur'd with its own But it is over it was unworthy our friendship and let it be forgotten  Miss Rich  You amaze me  Honeyw  But you'll forgive it I know you will since the confession should not have come from me even now but to convince you of the sincerity of my intention ofnever mentioning it more  Going  Miss Rich  Stay Sir one momentHa he here  Enter LOFTY  Lofty  Is the coast clear None but friends I have followed you here with a trifling piece of intelligence but it goes no farther things are not yet ripe for a discovery I have spirits working at a certain board Your affair at the treasury will be done in less thana thousand years Mum  Miss Rich  Sooner Sir I should hope  Lofty  Why yes I believe it may if it falls into proper hands that know where to push and where to parry that know how the land lieseh Honeywood  Miss Rich  It is sallen into yours  Lofty  Well to keep you no longer in suspense your thing is done It is done I saythat's all I have just had assurances from Lord Neverout that the claim has been examined and found admissible  Quietus  is the word Madam  Honeyw  But how his Lordship has been at Newmarket these ten days  Lofty  Indeed Then Sir Gilbert Goose must have been most damnably mistaken I had it of him  Miss Rich  He why Sir Gilbert and his family have been in the country this month  Lofty  This month It must certainly be soSir Gilbert's Letter did come to me from Newmarket so that he must have met his Lordship there and so it came about I have his letter about me I 'll read it to you  Taking out a large bundle  That's from Paoli of Corsica that from the Marquis of SquilachiHave you a mind to see a letter from Count Poniatowski now King of PolandHonest Pon  Searching  O Sir what are you here too I'll tell you what honest friend if you have not absolutely delivered my letter to Sir William Honeywood you may return it The thing will do without him  Sir Wil  Sir I have delivered it and must inform you it was received with the most mortifying contempt  Croaker  Contempt Mr Lofty what can that mean  Lofty  Let him go on let him go on I say You'll find it come to something presently  Sir Will  Yes Sir I believe you'll be amazed if after waiting some time in the antichamber after being surveyed with insolent curiosity by the passing servants I was at last assured that Sir William Honeywood knew no such person and I must certainly have been imposed upon  Lofty  Good let me die very good Ha ha ha  Croaker  Now for my life I can't find out half the goodness of it  Lofty  You can't Ha ha  Croaker  No for the soul of me I think it was as confounded a bad answer as ever was sent from one private gentleman to another  Lofty  And so you can't find out the force of the message Why I was in the house at that very time Ha ha It was I that sent that very answer to my own letter Ha ha  Croaker  Indeed How why  Lofty  In one word things between Sir William and me must be behind the curtain A party has many eyes He sides with Lord Buzzard I side with Sir Gilbert Goose So that unriddles the mystery  Croaker  And so it does indeed and all my suspicions are over  Lofty  Your suspicions What then you have been suspecting you have been suspecting have you Mr Croaker you and I were friends we are friends no longer Never talk to me It's over I say it's over  Croaker  As I hope for your favour I did not mean to offend It escaped me Don't be discomposed  Lofty  Zounds Sir but I am discomposed and will be discomposed To be treated thus Who am I Was it for this I have been dreaded both by inns and outs Have I been libelled in the Gazetteer and praised in the St James's have I been chaired at Wildman's and a speaker at Merchant Taylor's Hall have I had my hand to addresses and my head in the printshops and talk to me of suspects  Croaker  My dear Sir be pacified What can you have but asking pardon  Lofty  Sir I will not be pacifiedSuspects Who am I To be used thus have I paid court to men in favour to serve my friends the Lords of the Treasury Sir William Honeywood and the rest of the gang and talk to me of suspects Who am I I say who am I  Sir Will  Since Sir you're so pressing for an answer I'll tell you who you are A gentleman as well acquainted with politics as with men in power  as well acquainted with persons of fashion as with modesty with Lords of the Treasury as with truth and with all as you are with Sir William Honeywood I am Sir William Honeywood  Discovering his ensigns of the Bath  Croaker  Sir William Honeywood  Honeyw  Astonishment my uncle  Aside  Lofty  So then my confounded genius has been all this time only leading me up to the garret in order to fling me out of the window  Croaker  What Mr Importance and are these your works Suspect you You who have been dreaded by the inns and outs you who have had your hand to addresses and your head stuck up in printshops If your were served right you should have your head stuck up in the pillory  Lofty  Ay stick it where you will for by the Lord it cuts but a very poor figure where it sticks at present  Sir Will  Well Mr Croaker I hope you now see how incapable this gentleman is of serving you and how little Miss Richland has to expect from his influence  Croaker  Ay Sir too well I see it and I can't but say I have had some boding of it these ten days So I'm resolved since my son has placed his affections on a lady of moderate fortune to be satisfied with his choice and not run the hazard of another Mr Lofty in helping him to a better  Sir Will  I approve your resolution and here they come to receive a confirmation of your pardon and consent  Enter Mrs CROAKER JARVIS LEONTINE OLIVIA  Mrs Croaker  Where's my husband Come come lovely you must forgive them Jarvis here has been to tell me the whole affair and I say you must forgive them Our own was a stolen match you know my dear and we never had any reason to repent of it  Croaker  I wish we could both say so however this gentleman Sir William Honeywood has been beforehand with you in obtaining their pardon So if the two poor fools have a mind to marry I think we can tack them together without crossing the Tweed for it  Joining their hands  Leont  How blest and unexpected What what can we say to such goodness But our future obedience shall be the best reply And as for this gentleman to whom we owe  Sir Will  Excuse me Sir if I interrupt your thanks as I have here an interest that calls me  Turning to Honeywood  Yes Sir you are surprised to see me and I own that a desire of correcting your follies led me hither I saw with indignation the errors of a mind that only sought applause from others that easiness of disposition which tho' inclin'd to the right had not courage to condemn the wrong I saw with regret those splendid errors that still took name from some neighbouring duty Your charity that was but injustice your benevolence that was but weakness and your friendship but credulity I saw with regret great talents and extensive learning only employed to add sprightliness to error and encrease your perplexities I saw your mind with a thousand natural charms but the greatness of its beauty served only to heighten my pity for its prostitution  Honeyw  Cease to upbraid me Sir I have for some time but too strongly felt the justice of your repoaches But there is one way still left me Yes Sir I have determined this very hour to quit for ever a place where I have made myself the voluntary slave of all and to seek among strangers that fortitude which may give strength to the mind and marshal all its diffipated virtues Yet ere I depart permit me to solicit favour for this gentleman who notwithstanding what has happened has laid me under the most signal obligations Mr Lofty  Lofty  Mr Honeywood I'm resolv'd upon a reformation as well as you I now begin to find that  the man who first invented the art of speaking truth was a much cunninger fellow than I thought him And to prove that I design to speak truth for the future I must now assure you that you owe your late enlargement to another as upon my soul I had no hand in the matter So now if any of the company has a mind for preferment he may take my place I'm determined to resign  Exit  Honeyw  How have I been deceived  Sir Will  No Sir you have been obliged to a kinder fairer friend for that favour To Miss Richland Would she complete our joy and make the man she has honoured by her friendship happy in her love I should then forget all and be as blest as the welfare of my dearest kinsman can make me  Miss Rich  After what is past it would be but affectation to pretend to indifference Yes I will own an attachment which I find was more than friendship And if my intreaties cannot alter his resolution to quit the country I will even try if my hand has not power to detain him  Giving her hand  Honeyw  Heavens how can I have deserved all this How express my happiness my gratitude A moment like this overpays an age of apprehension  Croaker  Well now I see content in every face but Heaven send we be all better this day three months  Sir Will  Henceforth nephew learn to respect yourself He who seeks only for applause from without has all his happiness in another's keeping  Honeyw  Yes Sir I now too plainly perceive my errors My vanity in attempting to please all by fearing to offend any My meanness in approving  folly lest fools should disapprove Henceforth therefore it shall be my study to reserve my pity for real distress my friendship for true merit and my love for her who first taught me what it is to be happy  FINIS  EPILOGUE  SPOKEN BY MRS BULKLEY  AS puffing quacks some caitiff wretch procure  To swear the pill or drop has wrought a cure  Thus on the stage our playwrights still depend  For Epilogues and Prologues on some friend  Who knows each art of coaxing up the town  And make full many a bitter pill go down  Conscious of this our bard has gone about  And teaz'd each rhyming friend to help him out  An Epilogue things can't go on without it  It cou'd not fail wou'd you but set about it  Young man cries one a bard laid up in clover  Alas young man my writing days are over  Let boys play tricks and kick the straw not I  Your brother Doctor there perhaps may try  What Il dear Sir the Doctor interposes  What plant my thistle Sir among his roses  No no I've other contests to maintain  Tonight I head our troops at WarwickLane  Go ask your managerWho me your pardon  Those things are not our fort at CoventGarden  Our Author's friends thus plac'd at happy distance  Gives him good words indeed but no assistance  As some unhappy wight at some new play  At the Pit door stands elbowing away  While oft with many a smile and many a shrug  He eyes the centre where his friends sit snug  His simpering friends with pleasure in their eyes  Sink as he sinks and as he rises rise  He nods they nod he cringes they grimace  But not a soul will budge to give him place  Since then unhelp'd our bard must now conform  To 'bide the pelting of this pittiless storm  Blame where you must be candid where you can  And view with favour the Goodnatur'd Man
