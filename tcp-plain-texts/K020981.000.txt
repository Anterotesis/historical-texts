 PHILODAMUS A TRAGEDY  As the principal Design of Tragedy is to raise Commiseration and Terror in the Minds of the Audience we shall defeat this great End if we always make Virtue and Innocence happy and successful  SPECTATOR  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY in PALLMALL MDCCLXVII Price half a Crown  TO * *  MADAM  FAR be from the author the presumption of affixing to this trifle any thing so respectable as YOUR Name What impudence to have ventured to place it where he has a scruple to suffer one of so little importance  as his own to make its appearance But the character of Writer which the late extreme abuse of that talent has not at all contributed to illustrate does not invite powerfully enough to the producing one's self professedly in that light to the Public  The sole view of the author in the liberty he is now risking is only by way of appeal to YOU MADAM whether the character of complete domestic virtue attempted in that of  Philodamus  has been faithfully copied from nature Of this MADAM it is impossible any one can be so good a judge as YOURSELF who have constantly before YOUR eyes the most perfect example of it that perhaps ever actually existed an example  whose lustre still to increase YOU are contented MADAM to suffer YOUR own great and amiable qualities which in any other part of the world would have burst out unrivalled to rank in this but in the second place The loss is compensated in the great share it is allowed MADAM YOU have in the very virtues to which YOU yield the preeminence They are such that had they been exercised only within the walls of a private family they could not have failed of winning their way abroad into the general esteem of mankind What universal adoration must they then command when it is nothing less than the most extended dominion upon the globe which in reality proves to be this vast family under the most vigilant  and indulgent of parents and receives to its utmost boundary the effects of that fatherly tenderness and benevolence which seem to have been first put in practice in their more immediate connections in order to learn from experience how they might afterwards be best applied and diffused to the most distant  If in return MADAM our prayers to Heaven are but short it proceeds from no deficiency in our gratitude we think we have fulfilled every dictate of duty and love when we have ardently petitioned that YOU MADAM may long continue to share adorn and reward all the virtues that can render human nature amiable and respectable  The author of  Philodamus  has the honour to be with the most profound respect and veneration  MADAM  * * * * * YOUR * most devoted most obedient and most humble servant  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  PHILODAMUS  In a Name we are so little accustomed to as that of

DOLABELLA the Roman Praetor  VERRES his Legate  RUBRIUS Dependents on him  SESTIUS Dependents on him  APRONIUS Minister to his Pleasures  CORNELIUS an Officer  ERATO Daughter to PHILODAMUS  EUPHEMIA her Friend  Aruspex Augur Soldiers Servants Minstrels  SCENE Lampsacus a City of Asia on the Hellespont  An Apartment in PHILODAMUS'S Palace  PHILODAMUS A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  PHILODAMUS EARINUS  PHILODAMUS  AND now Earinus my faithful freedman  My soul's again at ease  EARINUS  Most happy hearing  PHILODAMUS  Thy approv'd honesty deserves my confidence  EARINUS  You honour me  PHILODAMUS  So that I fairly own  Since I discover'd Erato my daughter  What shall I call it with an indiscretion  Illsuited to that tim'rous modesty  Whose only safe entrenchment is reserve  Receiv'd the private visits of Epicrates  My mind has labour'd under some disturbance  EARINUS  Your pardon but what shadow of a likelihood  One of a fame unblemish'd as Epicrates  Should entertain a thought that might  disturb  Philodamus whose merit blood and riches  Claim the first rank in Lampsacus  PHILODAMUS  None But my sensibility was wounded  That she whose undisguised soul till now  I wont to read in as a book laid open  Should thus have clos'd the page  EARINUS  I am surpris'd  A mind so pois'd as yours should be industrious  To raise up trouble from so slight a source  PHILODAMUS  Thou dost not know the feelings of a father  Whose apprehensions shoot to the same height  As does his tenderness and whose anxiety  Finds objects for itself where most  unlikely    But to the purpose I at length determin'd  To call for explanation from Epicrates  E'en now I leave him  EARINUS  And my Lord you found him  PHILODAMUS  Found him Earinus as I could wish  But see my son which cuts our time too short  For more particulars  Exit  Earinus  SCENE II  PHILIPPUS PHILODAMUS  PHILIPPUS  Early this morning  I sought to pay my duty to my father  But was inform'd bus'ness had call'd him forth  PHILODAMUS  It had Philippus But I must observe  That bus'ness exercise nor yet diversion  Have any longer pow'r to call you forth  PHILIPPUS  I know not how it isOur inclinations  Slacken sometimes to flow with renew'd force  PHILODAMUS  Whate'er the cause the change is rather sudden  'Tis not so long since you foreran the sun  Clamour and bustle ever waken'd with thee  When I inquir'd sometimes it was Philippus  Would try his horses at the Hippodrome  Sometimes the morn was startled at his hounds  That claim'd with ceaseless quest the promis'd chace  At other ev'ry thing was preparation  For the Gymnasium now they're all forgot  PHILIPPUS  I was not reckon'd over negligent  PHILODAMUS  Your other studies too I find lie fallow  Here am I paying at a vast expence  Philosophers forsooth to rail at riches  To vaunt the praise of simple pulse and roots  Who by the by despise them at my table  While you loiter the livelong day in idleness  With Erato and my new guest Euphemia  Whom on the death of Agatho her father  In banishment at Corinth for the love  I knew your sister bare her I took hither  PHILIPPUS  That love gives reputation to her judgment  Had but our crabbed rough philosophers  Avail'd them of Euphemia's gentle manners  They might have learn'd what has so puzzled them  How Virtue looks and acts in her own shape  PHILODAMUS  Fools only know extremes Is there no middle  Between the harsh formality of bookmen  And trifling delicacy that makes woman  PHILIPPUS  I see no point in which they yield to us  Their apprehension's quicker and their reason  By forms less fetter'd their expression clearer  They seek no shelter from authorities  Nor do they strive to veil their ignorance  In terms of art as we do then their gentleness  Smooths off the rugged points of argument  Melting contention into pleasantry  Discourse such as Euphemia's and my sister's  Conceiv'd by sense and harmoniz'd by beauty  Reaches the heart while it informs the mind  Softens and civilizes all our ways  PHILODAMUS  Not to examine whither but too often  These over  civilizing  freedoms tend  How did you venture you their wise admirer  Who ought to know how delicate their fame  How the least breath that blight reproach may point  Oft with irreparable taint deforms  The best complexion'd innocence that dares  But err from common forms to introduce  Epicrates to Erato's apartment  Which by our manners is severely barr'd  To all but nearest consanguinity  PHILIPPUS  The age since you were young has shaken off  Many the slavish customs of tradition  PHILODAMUS  That country where all forms are thrown aside  However venerably perhaps deriv'd  From the collected wisdom of past times  And meant a mound against some national bent  Some native inclinations of the soil  Is on the point of losing decency  And sinking into rank licentiousness  PHILIPPUS  Now good my father if there be to blame  Do not involve my sister in my fault  Nor yet condemn her conduct her fair fame  Stands not within the verge of reprehension  Nor ever has she giv'n him ear alone  Euphemia or myself were always present  PHILODAMUS  'Twas inconsiderate and rash no matter  I've hit upon a way to remedy it  Which you'll soon learn Order your sister hither  Exit  Philippus  SCENE III  PHILODAMUS  Such is the heart of man No sooner quit  Of one anxiety up starts another  Ready to fill the vacant seat It grieves me  To see this boy so very deep involv'd  His thought discourse and soul is all Euphemia  How desperate the fi'ry wish of youth  How blind to the long train of ills behind  High on Imagination's upper bough  Pleasure suspends her fruit and shews its cheek  Flaming with ruddy gold to our impatience  Does Fortune toss it to our longing hand  We find in melancholy disappointment  The core consum'd by worms and rottenness  The juice we hop'd so racy turn'd to bitterness  SCENE IV  PHILODAMUS ERATO  PHILODAMUS ERATO  PHILODAMUS  Good morrow my fair child how dost thou Erato  ERATO  Health to my father What are his commands  PHILODAMUS  I have been rating here your brother child  Rather more warmly than my manner is  ERATO  I'm sorry for the occasion but I see  Your looks are still serene your brow unruffled  Mirth more than anger sparkles in your eye  I think you scarce have giv'n us opportunity  To learn how you look angry  PHILODAMUS  Why no daughter  For I regard my children as my friends  As my acquaintance my society  Connected by the tend'rest strings of love  'Tis their affection 'tis their confidence  I want and not a formal cold obedience  Dread is the seed from which rebellion springs  And teaches soon to wish a vacant throne  ERATO  Your milder government has rather chosen  To copy from those happy states where one  Is rais'd for the convenience of the whole  Rather to represent than exercise  The pow'r supreme  PHILODAMUS  I'm glad you think so of me  Well since I have not sought to reign by terror  You'll tell me in what light you see Epicrates  ERATO  So close an union knits him to Philippus  I see him almost as another brother  PHILODAMUS  And pray this other brother as you call him  Has ought particular e'er pass'd between you  ERATO  No more than general civility  Th' attention ever paid our sex by yours  No other than between him and Euphemia  PHILODAMUS  Your sentiments  ERATO  Are as of an acquaintance  That's always entertaining oft instructive  PHILODAMUS  No more  ERATO  No more  PHILODAMUS  Trust me I'm glad of it  For when I found that you receiv'd his visits  And with a kind of caution that imply'd  We would not have the old man find us out  ERATO  Will you but give me leave  PHILODAMUS  Not till I've done  I did inform me of his character  And find him as the general run o' th' time  Wild in his ways unmaster'd in his temper  One who has taken in his teeth the bit  And run away from rule one whose glib tongue  Distils a dang'rous and infective softness  Which on the passive and unguarded mind  Works like a feather dipp'd in pois'nous ointment  Pleasing while it destroys  ERATO  Do but permit me  To tell you you're most grossly misinform'd  Some private enemy hath slander'd him  If worth like his can find an enemy  Oh that I knew the wretch Contempt cleave to him  Nay common fame which as it rolls along  Licks up each speck and spot of character  Impatient to produce them to our eyes  Speaks him of conduct irreproveable  PHILODAMUS  What ho my daughter whither are you running  And why so warm for any one  acquaintance    However  entertaining  or  instructive  ERATO  Alas you shew me to myself at once  How could I be so ign'rant of my heart  I blush at my own folly Oh my father  Teach me my erring steps how to retrace  Command me and I never see him more  PHILODAMUS  This picture have I drawn of thy Epicrates  As in a mirrour that inverts the truth  To punish you for not confiding in me  Start you my girl to hear me call him thine  Why what a fire has lightned in thy cheek  And glimmers o'er thy bosom Yes my child  Epicrates is thine and in an hour  From hence expect to interchange your vows  ERATO  I do not only start I tremble too  Quite giddy at the unexpected change  'Tis but this instant that I find I love  The very same you give away my hand  I look in wonder round me like a voyager  Who quitting his own country late at evening  Sleeps o'er the easy passage to another  And wakes to a new people and new manners  Where the whole region wears a diff'rent aspect  From that he left  PHILODAMUS  As to thy voyage child  Be sure it lands thee on a sunshine coast  Where not a cloud yet lours But think of this  That happiness grows not on earth spontaneous  It is a plant that calls for delicate rearing  Trifling neglects may chill its tender growth  And imperceptibly produce that canker  Shall dim the orient tints impress'd by heaven  And give its fading lustre for a prey  To the harsh worm unkindness Think this certain  A necessary consequence whenever  Familiarity outruns complacency  ERATO  Fear not my care But this too quick transition  This hurrying so abruptly into marriage  Ere it is whisper'd in Inquiry's ear  Robs it of its due air of decency  PHILODAMUS  I should distress you were I to assent  To what your modesty would ask for form  Do you get ready while I give my orders  How to prepare the feast not with great pomp  Yet dignity because the legate Verres  Rav'nous as th' eagle on the Roman ensigns  Is just arriv'd and 't would inform his avarice  Where to seek out for prey should we unfold  All our magnificence to 's greedy eye  Exit  Philodamus  SCENE V  ERATO  Only to love and honour such a father  Is to be still ungrateful I would give  Some wild romantic proof of my obedience  Out of the common trampled road of duty  Here comes Epicrates Why all this tumult  This trouble at him whom I us'd to meet  With transport yet be mistress of myself  SCENE VI  EPICRATES ERATO  EPICRATES  My loveliest Erato I can perceive  A sweet confusion in your look that tells me  You are not unacquainted with my errand  Will not this gentle hand confirm the promise  This best of days has giv'n me from thy father  ERATO  You have it But I fear Epicrates  giving her hand  You knew too well before to need the question  For surely you had eyes to read my heart  However it impos'd upon itself  May not a time arrive when you'll despise me  For the facility with which you win me  EPICRATES  Yes could a time arrive when imposition  Disguise and mock'ry and th' ungen'rous pride  Of giving pain should grow more meritorious  Than noble plainness and free honesty  Which lift thee from the level of most women  And make thee ev'ry thing my heart could wish  ERATO  Such may you think me still and I'm too happy  All that I know is that in pure affection  And reverent submission to your pleasure  It will be hard indeed for me to err  Since they're so much my bent and inclination  I shall not know they are a debt to duty  EPICRATES  Thank thee my gentle love I am not one  T' outpassion passion and to o'erstretch sense  To rant in wild hyperbole and rapture  Such stuff as takes the triflers of thy sex  My love obedient to my reason grew  Which weigh'd and study'd thee and still discover'd  More and new virtues for its admiration  The search has justified excess of love  And my best judgment gives thee all my soul  ERATO  Grant Heaven you do not overrate my worth  How poor and how deserted shall I seem  When the imaginary virtues vanish  And my defects step forward to your view  EPICRATES  There I have not a fear But see Philippus  What mean his downcast look and haggard eye  SCENE VII  PHILIPPUS EPICRATES ERATO  PHILIPPUS  My friend my brother happiness show'r on thee  EPICRATES  It does till I can hold no more My friend  I cannot love thee better tho' I gain  Another tender name by which to call thee  PHILIPPUS  All joy to thee my dearest Erato  ERATO  My brother you felicitate but coolly  PHILIPPUS  It may be so for I am scarce myself  Else the content of such a friend and sister  Would animate me into exultation  Euphemia leaves us  ERATO  This was unexpected  It gives me grief How shall I bear the parting  EPICRATES  So suddenly  ERATO  Has ought offended her  PHILIPPUS  I have offended her I have offended her  Wretch that I am by telling her I lov'd  For that I love her with a flame as pure  As elemental fire unsoil'd by smoke  EPICRATES  Has long been visible enough Philippus  PHILIPPUS  The day when she arriv'd at Lampsacus  The sea had ruffled her and pal'd her cheek  With such a winning languidness it added  An air of sensibility to beauty  That only height'ned what it meant to steal from  She had my hand at landing on the pier  And her first touch was answer'd at my heart  Which instantly did homage to its sovereign  I waited long in humble distant awe  Smoth'ring my pains till now this very morning  Their violence forc'd a passage from my heart  EPICRATES  How did she hear you  PHILIPPUS  As she would a tale  Related of feign'd love and fancy'd persons  A mere Milesian novel which we read  Nor find one track behind it on the mind  Said it requir'd no answer for tomorrow  She sail'd for Corinth  ERATO  This is something sudden  But in these cases trust a woman's judgment  We read each other with a piercing eye  And penetrate with ease each latent meaning  I'm sure Euphemia loves  PHILIPPUS  I've seen it long  Oh I've no doubt Now could I gnaw my heart  EPICRATES  Hear me and if I speak with liberty  Think 'tis the surgeon's hand which cannot aid thee  Without first giving pain Can you conceive  High as your father stands in Lampsacus  With such a city bowing to his greatness  He will consent to wed his only son  Whate'er her birth her merit or her beauty  May plead in favour of Euphemia  Into a family whom banishment  Has stripp'd without remorse of its possessions  I could say more but fear to wound you deeper  Oh strive t' o'errule this unavailing passion  And be in time advis'd  PHILIPPUS  Go and advise  The lapse of water down the broken cliff  Not to obey its own propensity  Which drives it headlong to its place of rest  Then if it heed thy bidding come again  And I will try to bind my passion prisoner  In Reason's icy fetters Ah Epicrates  'Tis easier to advise than to assist  EPICRATES  Mistake me not For tho' I would dissuade  Yet my dissuasion frees no obligation  That friendship owes to serve you your own way  Therefore try you to win upon Euphemia  But to delay her voyage for a little  Mean while my Erato shall press her father  Say wilt thou not my love  ERATO  Whate'er you bid  Were I averse to't but in such a cause  My inclinations run before your bidding  And be you sure my brother I will plead  With all the energy of pure affection  Join'd to the sincere love I bear Euphemia  Could I but hope so to prevail on him  As I believe you will on her to stay  I should have warmer prospect of success  PHILIPPUS  I see and thank thy goodness Erato  Which strives tho' thou despondest in thy heart  To give th' unbodied ghost of hope a substance  And tinge it of some colour but thy love  Leaves it at best evanid  EPICRATES  Now no more  Go to Euphemia while we try Philodamus  To Erato  Exeunt  End of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  PHILODAMUS EARINUS  PHILODAMUS  You have my orders Only this Earinus  See that propriety and elegance  Are not encroach'd upon by cloying quantity  EARINUS  I shall  PHILODAMUS  Yet do you hear Earinus  Do not so check your hand but that abundance  Smile gracefully upon my board Forget not  That my dependents and the poor have mouths  Alas too seldom fill'd And can one see  The feast which lavish luxury has pil'd  With all that sea and air and earth produce  Without the thought how many of our species  Seem to inhabit quite another world  And do not know our diet So be gone  Exit  Earinus  SCENE II  PHILODAMUS ERATO  PHILODAMUS  How now What brings thee here my gentle daughter  ERATO  Euphemia means to leave us and my heart  Feels heavy for the parting Then Philippus  PHILODAMUS  But Erato where is thy nuptial robe  I thought to find thee trick'd in all the splendour  Which the unsatisfied and curious hand  Of ornament could torture out of fancy  ERATO  I hope you have not found me over studious  Of that vain science You have often told me  Dress was an indication of the mind  Which whether rich and noble with simplicity  Or light and trifling wanton in redundancy  Hung like a sign t' inform one of what goods  Were to be found within As for my brother  PHILODAMUS  I have so And why did I so To check  A passion that's inherent to thy sex  The peacock beauty tho' it spread its state  Quite to the tiptoe stretch of vanity  Wishes more eyes might stud its gaudy train  Unsatisfied in all its present pride  ERATO  The greater pity we are ever taught  To look on personal perfections  As our prime merit but the scanty hand  Of Nature in her dealing out those favours  Aided by your advice has cur'd I hope  Any excess Epicrates might blame  I came to say I tremble for Philippus  PHILODAMUS  You can't deny the sob'rest of you all  Seek in the glare of ornament to hide  Whereever Nature wanders from perfection  You're skilful architects and know to veil  With rich entablature and wreathing soliage  Any th' untoward juttings and abutments  That would disgrace your symmetry of building  Making necessity appear as choice  ERATO  Now my best father hear me of my brother  PHILODAMUS  Thou dost recur for ever to that burthen  And wilt not see that I with pains elude it  Nor am I only talkative from age  Fond as it is to hear itself discourse  But by design Why how canst thou imagine  The care the fondness the parental friendship  All faithful centinels who still on duty  Ne'er wink their vigilant eyes upon you both  Who told me ere thou toldst them to thyself  The secret inclinations of thy heart  Could be so drowsy now as not t' observe  A passion I must disapprove 'Tis this  Welcomes Euphemia's departure to me  I would be kind but not to foolishness  ERATO  My heart bleeds for him I dread something desperate  PHILODAMUS  Myself I have surviv'd more than one cross  Which youth and folly thought immediate death  Of this no more Here in the oratory  I go to pour my pray'rs and beg of Heaven  Its blessings on thy marriage and my house  Why dost thou follow me  ERATO  To shut the oratory  PHILODAMUS  What needs it shut I dare not ask the gods  What I would wish kept from the ears of men  Exit  Philodamus  SCENE III  ERATO  I see my brother following Euphemia  And will avoid him till I meet Epicrates  Or he will jointly try to move my father  Or soften our sad errand in the telling  SCENE IV  PHILIPPUS EUPHEMIA  PHILIPPUS  This is too much This dumb indifference  Oh rather let me suffer all thy hate  And learn it from thyself it would be kind  As it must end a life of wretchedness  Yet stop and answer me Cannot these tears  Obtain one only day 'tis all I ask  Nor yet the friendship you profess to Erato  EUPHEMIA  Her marriage makes my stay unnecessary  My resolutions are immutable  PHILLIPUS  Cruel Euphemia But I see the cause  Which wings your eagerness to take its flight  Think you a lover's eye could be so dull'd  His soul so drench'd with thick stupidity  As to o'erlook the thousand treach'rous signs  Which tell spite of yourself the darling secret  The sigh half smother'd and the melting look  The thought abstracted and the ardent wish  With all the kindred attributes of passion  Proclaim to full conviction that your heart  Is prepossess'd and thence my love contemn'd  EUPHEMIA  To this I owe no answer free to love  Or hate of you unquestion'd  PHILIPPUS  You say right  Nor would I now detain you for one moment  Fly to your lover fly the ship attends you  Go think a hurricane a tardy wind  And all too loit'ring for such dear impatience  Then ere the indistinct horizon shew  The rising hills of Corinth like a mist  Have your arms stretch'd out ready to embrace him  Stay not to land but plunge into his bosom  Oh bliss of gods which cannot know increase  Unless as I am urg'd by strong despair  I glut your eyes with what they long to see  The bleeding mangled triumph of your beauty  EUPHEMIA  Ah do not force me from my resolution  My reason and my duty to discover  What I would lock for ever in this bosom  Known only to myself Why will you torture me  For what when told will draw upon thyself  A dreadful train of bitterest repentance  PHILIPPUS  I am past fear of worse Oh tell me all  Tho' death attend upon the explanation  Nor think revenge may interrupt your happiness  My enmity is pointed at myself  EUPHEMIA  'Tis true one has possession of my heart  Nor malice can reprove my choice His worth  Allow'd by all tho' doubted by himself  Of rank exalted but of more distinction  For what he owes to none honour and merit  His tongue drops honey and whene'er he speaks  Attention blames herself of negligence  Tho' she's all ear and eye Then for his person  In pride of youthwords are too poor to paint it  PHILIPPUS  Refrain thy lavish praise or I shall burst  Ye tort'rers of the soul Rage Envy Jealousy  I fail beneath the lashing of your scourges  Forgive my frenzy I like you adore  His wondrous virtues I like you would worship  Perfections heav'n created but for him  Oh say where stands his altar To this god  Under what name shall I address my incense  I crave his name that happiest of names  Oh for that name of names  EUPHEMIA  Why you are mad  Nor do deserve to know nor should you know  But that I leave you ne'er to see you more  And that your wildness of misapprehension  Fancy'ng another master of my soul  Has humbled me to the too plain avowal  Of what the delicacy of my sex  Should doom to sleep in everlasting silence  It is Philippus Know you such a man  That rival of himself  PHILIPPUS  Can I be sure  That I exist support me or I faint  Astonishment has wrapp'd me from myself  My senses whirl them round in giddy eddies  Too much for nature's suff'rance scarce can life  Cohabit with the tumult of my joy  EUPHEMIA  Avoid these starts of rapture which but add  Fresh poison to the stings of disappointment  Imagination views her fav'rite prospect  Till lost in soft delusion she approaches  Even the blue sky to her eager reach  Skipping the middle space which teems with obstacles  PHILIPPUS  What lion glares athwart the promis'd way  Has not my love confess'd her gen'rous flame  What then can come between me and my wishes  EUPHEMIA  Are you to learn then what may come between  What are ingratitude and disobedience  And if Philippus devious from the tenor  Of his past life bursting each sacred band  That links his duty to so mild a father  Obedience to him is but awful friendship  Could take to 's arms an unbless'd vagabond  Think not Euphemia of so base a spirit  To ruin by her love the man she loves  Or blast by a mean deed of selfishness  The only friend destruction left her parents  Taint like a pois'nous worm those kindly branches  That yield her food and shelter  PHILIPPUS  I have won  Epicrates and Erato to ask  EUPHEMIA  Ask him to set this ample roof on fire  Or sink his riches in the boundless sea  And he shall laugh less at us  PHILIPPUS  Dost thou doom me  To pine beneath thy ineffectual love  Away with these refinements let us fly  Fly to thy mother till resentment here  Thaw into reconcilement She at least  Will bless me while I ever seek to pay her  In duty the dear debt I owe for thee  EUPHEMIA  Pay it at home You little know that mother  Nor would she own the name should I revisit her  Unworthy of her love Distress had never  The pow'r to eat into her solid virtue  Nor roughen with its rust the perfect polish  One female slave attends her their joint labour  Earns hard support oft borrowing from night  Its softest hours of rest and I defraud her  While I am absent of my share of toil  Would I had never left her never left her  PHILIPPUS  Oh only kind to heighten cruelty  EUPHEMIA  I've said too much We part take this embrace  The first and last I give Shun we each other  Trust not a look and think a sigh rebellion  Against our duties So farewell  Exit Shuts the Door  PHILIPPUS  One word  She's gone she's lost for ever Oh my brain  Ex  SCENE V  PHILODAMUS  The gods have heard my pray'r and sent their answer  I ask'd them for a blessing on my house  And they have brought this woman to my ear  That I might learn her worth How nobly strict  How just to me how duteous to her mother  There I've been negligentThe voice of misery  Is often lost to pity's ear by distance  Hide from the eye distress compassion loses  Its best almost sole entrance to the heart  And leaves disaster by itself to languish  It shall be mended Erato Epicrates  Hark ye a word  SCENE VI  Enter ERATO EPICRATES  Haste thee my gentle daughter  Upon a message thou'lt be glad to bear  I would not hear thee when thou wouldst have mov'd me  To listen to the sorrows of thy brother  Himself I've heard Fly to him child and tell him  I love Euphemia little less than he does  And long to give her to him Haste away  ERATO  Oh happy change how I shall bless Philippus  Ex  SCENE VII  EPICRATES PHILODAMUS  EPICRATES  Now you have heap'd the measure of my joy  In thus preventing what I meant to urge  In favour of Euphemia This completes  What you began in hast'ning my felicity  Which else had waited the interposition  Of friends ere I had ty'd this wish'd alliance  A life so lib'ral in dispensing happiness  Claims ev'ry pray'r for blessings in return  PHILODAMUS  There is more usury in making happy  Than the most studied selfishness e'er dream'd of  My son except that his is more tumultuous  Owns not more joyAnd as for you Epicrates  Had the whole world been open to my choice  That I could say Here will I give my daughter  Thou wert the man the one my sould would cleave to  I love thy probity and gentle nature  That form and fashion of the present time  Which grows a virtue when it is allied  To antique truth and sanctity of manners  And that timidity of modest merit  Without the bookish downlook'd awkwardness  Which oft disgraces knowledgeWho attends there  Send here Earinus  To a Servant  EPICRATES  Such commendation  I dare not think my own Yet I would wish  Your favour should not be mistaken widely  That I may prove not wholly undeserving  The hand of Erato  Enter EARINUS  My lord your orders  PHILODAMUS  Thou art too much employ'd thyself to quit  The general inspection of this day  Therefore Earinus have thou in readiness  Some servant of especial trust to bear  A packet to the port it is of consequence  EARINUS  Or Aeschylus my Lord or Xanthias  PHILODAMUS  Ay either  E'en which you will let it be giv'n on board  The vessel which Euphemia meant to sail in  Thus better freighted with the chearing news  For this will chear Lysistrata her mother  Of our alliance  EPICRATES  Thank you for a goodness  Which never acts as I perceive by halves  But at this time you're all too overhurried  For such dispatches at your better leisure  This may be done as well  PHILODAMUS  Epicrates  I tell thee what I should be less punctilious  Had Fortune never turn'd her back upon her  But where Adversity has fix'd her teeth  It leaves a soreness that is sure to smart  At light suspicions of unmeant contempt  The veriest trifles which in happier days  Slip our observance and leave no impression  Assume the shape of Injury and Insult  To rankle in the mindI write besides  To press her with her earliest convenience  To hasten hither and to make this house  Her place of residenceOh here they come  SCENE VII  PHILODAMUS EUPHEMIA PHILIPPUS EPICRATES  PHILODAMUS  Well Erato how hast thou sped thy message  Or meet you difficulties and objections  What says our son Does he refuse t' obey us  Or is Euphemia not to be prevail'd on  What is she so determin'd on her voyage  She will not listenHow dissolv'd in tears  I thought you had not own'd such weak humanity  EUPHEMIA  I was prepar'd and fortify'd 'gainst misery  Unguarded to this vast surprise of joy  Whatever resolution we pretend  By my own weakness I'm too well convinc'd  Our passions still are woman  PHILODAMUS  Worth like thine  Is all too scarce in man Thy sex Euphemia  Whether in good or bad will distance ours  This hand say may I give it to Philippus  EUPHEMIA  My heart was giv'n before Oh ecstasy  That you approve and realize the gift  PHILIPPUS  Avoid these starts of rapture which but add  Fresh poison to the stings of disappointment  Oh best of men oh Erato oh friend  Was ever such a father Oh Euphemia  Dost not adore him but I know thou dost  Forgive my wildnessdo not laugh at me  PHILODAMUS  Contract your transports and retire a little  While they prepare this chamber for the ceremony  That gives you to each other once and ever  Exeunt  End of ACT II  ACT III  SCENE I  VERRES'S Palace  RUBRIUS APRONIUS SESTIUS  RUBRIUS  Ha our old harbinger How is't Apronius  APRONIUS  Glad you're arriv'd How fare you Rubrius  Sestius I'm yours welcome to Lampsacus  SESTIUS  Thank you Apronius You arriv'd before us  APRONIUS  Ay these ten days to order your reception  But where's the Legate that I see him not  RUBRIUS  Reposing after the fatigue of journey  APRONIUS  Fatigue why his sedan steps with that smoothness  So stuff'd with cushions that he rather seems  To float upon the air than move on earth  SESTIUS  You know his delicacy to what height  He has improv'd that science whose perfection  Consists in picking cause of discontent  Fatigue and disappointment where we gross ones  Thanks to our want of taste meet satisfaction  RUBRIUS  Why he was sour'd but at the last relay  Because the country round about could furnish  Only some two poor bushels of fresh roses  Hardly enough to arm his queasy sense  Against eight sturdy Cappadocian slaves  Who melted as they bore along his litter  APRONIUS  Well are your purses cramm'd You have not serv'd  Under so great a master in the art  Of plund'ring to return with empty hands  SESTIUS  Ask Rubrius there he is an able workman  I'm but a 'prentice and can only pilfer  RUBRIUS  Nothing to boast of yet not much amiss  The legate kept t' himself king Nicomedes  As a right royal dish and only serv'd  To his own mess where we were not to feed  And he has pick'd him to the bone nay suck'd  His very marrow Irus might be richer  Than Asia's monarch now  APRONIUS  At least in vermin  I like your prudence while you fleec'd the court  But spar'd the people you ensur'd their love  RUBRIUS  Ensur'd their love say you ensur'd their love  If plague war famine shipwreck may be lov'd  Then we may have our share on't and not else  SESTIUS  How stand your lists for pillage and for women  For let me tell you he's sharp set on both  You need not doubt but he'll inquire for them  Soon as he sees you  RUBRIUS  But Apronius  What is the present state of vice and villany  In Lampsacus  APRONIUS  In little as at Rome  The great are vicious openly 'bove fear  Of the law's rod which humbly bows before them  As your minesearchers say their hazle twig  Stoops to the latent gold beneath Again  The middle rank is vicious out of pride  Copying the larger manners of their betters  Ev'n till they swell their narrowness to bursting  The trading sort are honest their indentures  Invest them with the privilege to cozen us  SESTIUS  What no more honesty alive than this  APRONIUS  Alive she died a beggar unreliev'd  RUBRIUS  So we may fancy then ourselves at home  Since vice stalks unreprov'd here  APRONIUS  Your philosophers  Subsist by daily holding forth against it  And in mere gratitude at night indulge in it  SESTIUS  Apronius you say nothing to the women  APRONIUS  Pooh they are here as in all other places  Why there's no variation in the sex  But what dress makes their bodies stripp'd of that  And could one see their souls stripp'd of their bodies  One could not know an empress from an housemaid  RUBRIUS  Now you're severe  SESTIUS  Hush here the legate comes  SCENE II  VERRES APRONIUS RUBRIUS SESTIUS  VERRES  Well my good friends how like you Lampsacus  'Tis a brave cityArt thou here Apronius  What my purveyor the sutler to my pleasures  APRONIUS  bowing  And sometimes to your profit  VERRES  Name not profit  As yet We only spread our sails tow'rds pleasure  Thou look'st as if the wind blew prosp'rous thither  Read me the bill of fare of beauty's feast  That I may know where to direct my appetite  Nor throw't away on ordinary diet  APRONIUS  For the first dish I place upon your board  "Euridice the wife of Aristippus  Reads  "Barely eighteen her husband some threescore"  The fool dotes on her and sticks closely to her  A filthy slug on a delicious peach  The crispness of her youth is green upon her  Yet not to sourness tho' improveable  Like fruit another morning's sun had mellow'd  SESTIUS  He should have kept his fruit for the dessert  aside  RUBRIUS  The rogue's description is so savoury  That my mouth waters at it Let's hear on  APRONIUS  But all this beauty fades its less'ning merit  In Erato's superior lustre dimm'd  VERRES  Who is this Erato when comes her turn  I want to hear of her  APRONIUS  She is the daughter  Of the first man in Lampsacus Philodamus  She has a fair companion call'd Euphemia  Whose beauty borders upon competition  RUBRIUS  D'ye hear Apronius I bespeak Euphemia  APRONIUS  Go hang or learn to cater for yourself  "The next is Psyche wedded to Eubulus  Reads  "Near upon thirty tall and rather plumpish"  If she be past the gush and swell of beauty  Is hard to say so imperceptibly  Hath time blown o'er it that 'twould make one think  He strove to mend it as the rose smells sweeter  For being breath'd on than before it opens  Yet Erato who blooms in balmy fragrance  Subdues like incense all these weak perfumes  VERRES  Why tell me of them then Proceed to Erato  APRONIUS  Reads  "Rhodè the fair and witty wife of Lyco"  Another may possess more regular features  Or glow with richer tints from nature's pallette  Yet where she comes array'd in all her gaiety  Her bursts of fancy and her pleasing petulance  Variety unweary'd plays about her  And quite monopolizes all attention  Till in the pow'rful witchcraft soon absorpt  Superior beauties wane into neglect  Except  VERRES  Always excepting Erato  For that I find's the burthen to thy song  I'm all on fire tell me of Erato  APRONIUS  I have a score behind  VERRES  I'll hear no more  Tell me of Erato she must be mine  My faithful pimp hast thou devis'd the means  For me to meet this paragon of beauty  Where when how soon today presently now  APRONIUS  There lies the rub That heav'nly form of hers  Does not start higher from the common level  Than does her perfect purity of manners  Above the doubtful virtues of this age  RUBRIUS  Apronius what hast thou to do with purity  Thou seem'st to name it in a kind of rapture  APRONIUS  I am a rascal else I should not be  Link'd to thy company I practise villany  But must esteem the virtues I don't imitate  SESTIUS  What art thou subject to these moral fits  How long do th'hold thee dost thou mischief in them  VERRES  Ye trifle while my soul is on the rack  How to possess her for I will possess her  Can money purchase or must flatt'ry win  Or force convey her to my raptur'd arms  Who has invention let him merit of me  All he can ask or wish or I can give  There's glory in the conquest if we carry  This barricado'd virtue  APRONIUS  To my thoughts  All methods seem alike impracticable  Better take up with one of those I've mention'd  Had you not heard of her you had embrac'd  One tho' a meaner beauty in your arms  And thought her Ilia and Egeria  VERRES  Villain upon thy life dare not suggest  The transfer of my passion from that object  Where thou hast rivetted m' imagination  RUBRIUS  I have a lucky thought that comes across me  Tho' I am quarter'd on a stately house  Where pride and riches make a vain attempt  To pass upon the world for liberality  That only virtue man can't counterfeit  Yet my host views me with a niggard eye  That means Are you come here to eat me up  Portending penury of hospitality  Let this be your pretence for my removal  To the more ample station of Philodamus  You and your train dine with me there today  Who knows what opportunities may offer  If none why then the brave make opportunities  Wine and the gen'ral hurry of the feast  Shall one inspire t'other facilitate  Some fortunate attempt to crown your wishes  VERRES  Let me embrace thee my best Rubrius  Order a guard directly to the house  RUBRIUS  But why a guard  VERRES  Because by the pretence  To do thee honour we secure ourselves  Tread you upon its heels and I on yours  Why now success stretches his hand towards mine  And gives me more than promises Come on  Exeunt  Verres  and  Rubrius  SCENE III  SESTIUS APRONIUS  SESTIUS  'Twere wrong and dangerous to force the damsel  APRONIUS  Who has the  moral fit  upon him now  Art thou a Roman and decline a rape  Dost thou not fear thy Sabine ancestress  All pale should start up from her urn and chide  The dastard sp'rit of her degenerate son  A rape in other nations may sound vile  In us 'tis to commem'rate our progenitors  Exeunt  SCENE IV  PHILODAMUS'S House  PHILODAMUS EPICRATES PHILIPPUS ERATO EUPHEMIA  PHILODAMUS  Go crown the houshold Gods with freshest flowers  And hang the gay festoon on ev'ry column  Bid my house laugh and imitate its owner  I feel a joy equivalent to youth  That dances at my heart And to be joyful  Is to be thankful to the gracious gods  Come near my children You whom nature gave me  Scarce dearer to me than these new acquir'd  May all Heav'ns blessings light upon you all  Lays his hands on them  EPICRATES  You have anticipated all in this  Nor have you left me matter for a pray'r  Save for continuance of the present happiness  PHILIPPUS  If you my father but from the reflection  From the rebound of our content perceive  Such warmth think how our bosoms glow on which  Felicity darts all her rays direct  PHILODAMUS  To the women  Lost in deep thought I have observ'd it often  That any unexpected flow of joy  Borrows from grief its very mien and aspect  And seems to sadden more than chear the heart  ERATO  My thoughts were but petitions to high Heaven  That such benignity might long preside  O'er all the happiness it has dispens'd  EUPHEMIA  Mine that a life entire of strict attention  All care and all affection still must leave me  Bankrupt in duty to you  PHILODAMUS  This I sought not  I thank you all however most the Gods  Who have allow'd me to behold my children  Plac'd to my wish and now I reach the hour  I long have ey'd at distance with desire  Wherein to shift life's bus'ness from my shoulders  And sport with the remainder of my days  As one who all his baggage put on board  Saunters and plays with ev'ry shell and pebble  He meets upon the beach till the wind veer  And then puts off when summon'd without hurry  I feel that I have leisure now to die  ERATO  My dearest father shun th' illomen'd word  Nor draw a cloud 'thwart this solemnity  With the sad thought of what the Gods avert  PHILODAMUS  I only mean my child my work is done  The ball wound up of all I had to do  And as to dyingif this very day  It were to happen why I've liv'd enough  EPICRATES  Why chuse this subject in these happy moments  Which gaiety and joy claim for their own  PHILODAMUS  Th' Aruspex and the Augur let us hear them  Enter ARUSPEX and AUGUR  Walk in Have you perform'd the sacrifice  ARUSPEX  We have and our litation was most perfect  The flame upon the altar bright and vivid  Aspir'd to Heaven and wreath'd its dancing point  With scarce a groan the placid victim fell  The form sight and complexion of the entrails  Auspicious all without one threat'ning fibre  PHILODAMUS  What says your observation  AUGUR  Accurately  The Heav'ns we quarter'd and remark'd the flight  Of ev'ry wing that wander'd thro' the air  Listen'd to all that spoke to divination  Num'rous the omens on the happy side  Naught on the adverse that might derogate  And to confirm and ratify the whole  The eagle wheel'd him in a thousand rings  Floating upon his wideexpanded vans  Far on the left in the blue sky serene  The thunder roll'd disarm'd of all its fires  PHILODAMUS  What draw ye from the whole  ARUSPEX  To all here present  Long years of happiness that crowd tow'rds light  AUGUR  To you old age to these a num'rous progeny  PHILODAMUS  Call in the Minstrels and begin the rites  Enter MINSTRELLS  Hark ye my friends give me some decent hymn  None of those licences too oft permitted  Rather encourag'd at these times which turn  A nuptial feast into a brothel riot  MINSTREL  We know our place too well  PHILODAMUS  So then begin  And you my gentle children while they chaunt  The deity presiding over marriage  Conceive your vows heaping the grateful altar  With incense that shall waft them up to Heaven  EPITHALAMIUM  For two Womens Voices  st voice  Hymen oh Hymen  d voice  Haste haste Hesperus  Both  Thy

till we know the cause  Exeunt women and all the attendants  PHILIPPUS  Ye are mistaken Do ye know this house  And where its owner ranks in Lampsacus  CORNELIUS  Saxa and Rufus Yonder is your guard  No no there's no mistake Yours Mutius  With these three others all that colonnade  The rest are ready planted No mistake  I know your house and rank and know my orders  PHILIPPUS  Low to  Philodamus  Let me but drive these fellows out of doors  PHILODAMUS  Rash boy forbear These fellows are our masters  EPICRATES  But the indignity  PHILODAMUS  Are you a boy too  CORNELIUS  Be not alarm'd I only follow orders  And am plac'd here to honour Rubrius  Who comes to take his quarters in your house  EPICRATES  Why this is not an inn for ev'ry comer  Who chuses to set up his staff in it  PHILIPPUS  A consul or a praetor have found here  Worthy reception Legate never claim'd  Such privilege much less a legate's follower  PHILODAMUS  Be still 'tis not this honest soldier's fault  Pray tell me friend who is this Rubrius  CORNELIUS  To tell you the plain truth he's one of those  We've quantity enough of them at Rome  By hanging on the great who's learn'd their manners  Or rather overacts at first admitted  For low buffooneries and mean submissions  For being either any thing or nothing  Receiv'd rejected feasted sent on errands  Their fool companion pimp friend slave and equal  Grown by degrees so necessary to them  They recollect not their own manufacture  But ev'n strike sail to'm when he holds his head up  As all such do and higher than their masters  This sword here earns me coarser bread but honester  PHILODAMUS  A guest indeed who does me mighty honour  The legate must have err'd thro' ignorance  Of my condition and I go t' explain it  Going  CORNELIUS  With all my heart I'll obey any orders  Enter SOLDIER  Rubrius comes  CORNELIUS  What ho Stand to your guard  Exit  PHILODAMUS  So very quick why this is done on purpose  To make complaint too slow  Returning  PHILIPPUS  'Tis not too late  To shut the door in's face give me but leave  PHILODAMUS  Stay madman nor provoke bad things to worse  Since we are slaves why do we talk like freemen  All that is left us is submission  EPICRATES  Surely  You won't  PHILIPPUS  No sure you won't my father  PHILODAMUS  Yes but I will and more Upon your duties  You shall absent you from my house the while  I know your indignation and high spirits  Would you renew the Lapithean fray  And mingle wine with blood No arguing  EPICRATES  I only wish you have no need of us  PHILIPPUS  We may conduct the women to his house  PHILODAMUS  Not glaring in the streets amid the populace  At close of evening I'll convey them to you  Farewell now disappear I hear a bustle  Exeunt  Epicrates  and  Philippus  GUARD  within    Stand by  Second  GUARD  Stand by there  PHILODAMUS  Now for my best face  That it mark no resentment to my guest  SCENE V  RUBRIUS  Trust me Philodamus it grieves me much  To be a burthen to you but the legate  Thinking the Roman dignity infring'd  By the faint splendour where I last was station'd  Has order'd this remove  PHILODAMUS  The case is new  But we obey th' injunction of our lords  Pray think this house your own Nay it is so  And that it might afford ampler reception  This instant I have sent away my son  RUBRIUS  eagerly    You have not sent away your daughter too  PHILODAMUS  That needed not you know her range of chambers  Can never interfere with these apartments  RUBRIUS  Your house is royalI suppose this door  Leads to th' apartment of the women  PHILODAMUS  No  This on the left  RUBRIUS  And I shall not disgrace it  By those I've bid the Legate and his train  Will dine here he was close behind He comes  Horns  PHILODAMUS  And in right time I think the table's serv'd  Haste we to meet him  RUBRIUS  I attend upon you  Exeunt  End of ACT III  ACT IV  SCENE I  RUBRIUS APRONIUS SESTIUS fuddled  APRONIUS  This is a noble feast I would the giver  Had been prevail'd upon to drink more freely  He still evaded press him how we could  RUBRIUS  Curse his sobriety it is so obstinate  It looks as he suspected our design  SESTIUS  For his sobriety why that's unpardonable  In all the rest he seems an honest fellow  APRONIUS  Sestius thy wine recoils upon thyself  We'll try again and while they spunge the tables  Take care you call for wine Oh here they are  SCENE II  Enter PHILODAMUS and VERRES  PHILODAMUS  We are not so deficient in your history  But that some very venerable names  Curius Cincinnatus and Fabricius  Brutus and Regulus and Scipio  With others of like fame transmit their rays  Thro' distance and the difference of language  To influence and light our Grecian world  VERRES  Ay those were characters fit for those times  Were they to live again they would be wiser  Or else incur the penalty and starve  Their ignorance we've complimented honesty  What was their merit in despising riches  They had no use for as they knew no luxury  PHILODAMUS  Strange that the probity which wrought your greatness  Should not maintain its estimation with you  RUBRIUS  My noble guest and very lib'ral host  Suppose the while they reinstate the chamber  We call'd for wine Philodamus grows serious  PHILODAMUS  Not in the least far from it  RUBRIUS  Table with Wine  Bring some wine  Pour to my landlord here Why my good friend  There's nought defective in your hospitality  But that you baulk too much the social bowl  And are not chearful We embarrass you  PHILODAMUS  Oh not at all  VERRES  Trust me I fear we do  SESTIUS  What flinch a sober cup we'll no excess  I hate a drunkard worse than you can do  PHILODAMUS  I am but in the place of a first butler  Who must keep sober to observe his master  APRONIUS  But you disgrace the office Why a butler  Drinks twice in quantity and quality  His master's draught  PHILODAMUS  Have me excus'd I pray you  Take your own freedom and allow me mine  SESTIUS  Freemen are friends to drink Look ye your slave  Fears to unbar his breast Now wine commits  As 'twere a kind of  rape  upon his secrets  PHILODAMUS  Let me put no restraint upon your pleasures  But for myselfWe eat not the same weight  Why then oblig'd to drink by the same measure  VERRES  Press we our host no more There is a time  When a dull clog hangs on our flagging spirits  A listlessness and an indisposition  To mirth and all the chearful ways of men  Which wayward struggles 'gainst its remedy  As patients nauseate the draught that cures them  I have known music have a great effect  In dissipating this cold gloomy humour  Apronius is your voice in tune  APRONIUS  I'll try  SONG  When Theseus left his Ariadne  Fast in her bed the poor girl was a blinking  Drowned herself for grief she had nigh  But second thoughts soon inclin'd her to drinking  Sh' illumin'd her face till it shone with that brightness  It turn'd to a star which gives proof of her lightness  VERRES  How so I thought she had been crown'd with stars  APRONIUS  Her loves with Bacchus and her stellar wreath  Are allegorical and mean no more  Than the song tells us  SESTIUS  And all songs tell truth  A gallant fellow at a  rape  that Theseus  I know his hist'ry he'd the first of Helen  RUBRIUS  Right Sestius to make sure of that priority  Like a wise man he stole her in her childhood  VERRES  Would she were here not quite indeed so young  Nor yet so far advanc'd as when she quitted  Lank Menelaus for her curl'd adulterer  Or any other Helen For that company  Tho' chosen e'er so well if only men  Sours into argument or quickly mopes  What is the feast where women are excluded  APRONIUS  A trough for swine to gorge at where they swill  To surfeiting in noise and nastiness  RUBRIUS  Man would immediately relapse to beast  If woman did not humanize the brute  And make him shave his beard and pare his nails  Wheree'er she treads good humour leads the way  Pleasure lighthearted mirth and elegance  Compose her train and joy is all her own  Wine was invented to supply her place  And but enhances more the want of her  SESTIUS  I don't find that  APRONIUS  Within these walls is one  Who had sham'd Helen given her the pip  And to excuse her looks had made her swear  She had not slept the whole precedent night  Tho' she had had her husband by her side  I mean the daughter of our gen'rous host  Nay her companion is almost her rival  And on my conscience I could well believe  That Leda laid more eggs than we are told of  Which have been somehow kept and newly hatch'd  To shew true beauty to the present age  VERRES  It is inhuman to confine the women  Who best adorn and ought to share the feast  Let me beseech you we may have their company  PHILODAMUS  My daughter in the company of men  Where the mad bowl inspires unmaster'd licence  What a chaste virgin be a blushing witness  To the gross meaning of your lewd allusions  Bear the familiar pressure of the hand  And all the ribald manners now call'd fashion  The thought is infamous  SESTIUS  Hark you me landlord  If she's so chaste she would not understand them  If not 'tis not the pressure of the hand  Will do her harm  VERRES  In truth Philodamus  Your Grecian ceremonial is too strict  We'll argue this withinand shall convince you  That the security of female virtue  Rests safest on its early introduction  To the familiarity of men  Come friends to the next room I know you're thirsty  To pledge me to the health of this new Helen  Exeunt all but  Sestius  and  Philodamus  SCENE III  SESTIUS PHILODAMUS  SESTIUS  Hist old formality Hark you me friend  An you will pledge me in a single bowl  I'll tell y' a secret that shall make you laugh  But you'll not blab for I detest a blabber  You never heard a scheme of greater pleasantry  PHILODAMUS  He may know something worthy my discovery  'Tis fair to catch the truth that's leaking thro' him  Aside  If but for once then I accept your challenge  Here's to you  SESTIUS  Now that's spoken like a man  Both drink  Why you must know we came on purpose hither  To carry off this what's her name this Helen  You can guess who I meanDon't be a fool now  To blow the secret and prevent our sport  PHILODAMUS  Allgracious heav'n  Aside  Oh never doubt my prudence  Yes all things join to prove it  Aside  Never fear me  Oh sacred hospitality profan'd  Aside    But join your company lest they suspect  The confidence you've made  SESTIUS  Tut never doubt them  Exit  Sestius  SCENE IV  PHILODAMUS EARINUS  PHILODAMUS  Earinus thou faithfullest of servants  Oh heav'n and earth the soul of man is villany  Fly with the utmost speed of fear and tell them  Art thou not gone  EARINUS  Whither my lord to whom  Tell what  PHILODAMUS  I crave thy mercy my Earinus  Impatience stops itself with its own hurry  Fly to Philippus and Epicrates  Tell them my guests are vipers adders scorpions  That mean to sting to death my daughter's honour  Erato's and Euphemia'sNay come back  Why dost thou run away with half thy errand  Tell themYe Gods instruct me how to act  Tell them to arm themselves and servants privily  See that my own are readyStay command them  As they respect and love me not to strike  Till avow'd violence demand resistance  Once more come backTell them they hurt not Sestius  What he disclos'd thanks to his wine shall save him  Away    Exit  Earinus  I've liv'd to blush at my own species  SCENE V  APRONIUS PHILODAMUS  APRONIUS  The Legate and his friends wish for your company  They think their entertainment but imperfect  Without your presence  PHILODAMUS  not perceiving her  Surely he will find them  Or we are all undoneNay he will find them  APRONIUS  You do not hear me  PHILODAMUS  confus'd  Pardon me I do  Indeed and what says Sestius to that  APRONIUS  I said the Legate would desire your presence  Sestius says nothing but has delegated  His nose to speak as proxy You may hear it  Snore hither  PHILODAMUS  Well I goWhat dogs are men  Exit  SCENE VI  APRONIUS  So he suspects our drift I find no matter  What dogs are men  I heard the exclamation  Th' expression errs and is a gross abuse  Upon the better animal No doubt  Were dogs to speak they would invert the phrase  When they reproach each otherHo Cornelius  SCENE VII  Enter CORNELIUS  APRONIUS  Place at this door a guard while you and I  Usher the women out  CORNELIUS  Since such my orders  Make good the guard here and now I attend you  Exeunt  First Soldier  A pretty job of work we are upon  An we're demolish'd we deserve it richly  Second Soldier  Ay all that stay for't but if there's resistance  Let those who are to share the honey try  To drive away the bees  Women within  Help there oh help  Whoever loves Philodamus assist us  Enter CORNELIUS with EUPHEMIA and APRONIUS with ERATO  CORNELIUS  No mutiny  APRONIUS  My fair one no resistance  You see it is in vain useless as clamour  ERATO  Will no one help You have not slain my father  That you presume on such unheardof violence  But he were better dead than see my shame  My knees knock under me I cannot go  To  Apronius  who pulls her    APRONIUS  We'll carry you  EUPHEMIA  Keep up your resolution  Think in what hands we are and be assur'd  To dare to fear is to assist our danger  Courage Philippus lives or we can die  APRONIUS  The Legate is gallant and gay and generous  Handsome and young and rich Ere long you'll thank me  For what unthinkingly you now call violence  And as for you my pretty one there's Rubrius  EUPHEMIA  Detested wretch stop thy vile speechYe Gods  I see Philippus my deliv'rer comes  SCENE VII  Enter EPICRATES PHILIPPUS and servants  arm'd    EPICRATES  to  Apronius  Villain let go thy sacrilegious hold  Or perish instantly upon this sword  APRONIUS  running away  Ay let Cornelius fight I like not fighting  Exit  Epicrates  drives the soldiers off the stage  PHILIPPUS  Go follow thy companion or thou diest  CORNELIUS  'Tis not decided yet if you or I  PHILIPPUS  Resign her thou brave fool I would not hurt thee  Thou hast some honesty although a Roman  CORNELIUS  What's honesty 'gainst orders So come on  Fight Cornelius falls Bustle within  VERRES  within  Silence the dotard's clamour Stop his throat  EUPHEMIA  Thus to thy arms  PHILIPPUS  stopping her  It is no time for this  Reenter EPICRATES  PHILIPUS  to him  Lose not an instant but convey to safety  Euphemia and my sister while I fly  To save a father Some of you attend me  Exeunt on different sides  CORNELIUS  This comes of serving knavesI have enough on't  And yet 'tis hard nowthat an honest soldier  For followingohhis ordersshould be slain  Dies  Bustle within  SCENE VII  PHILODAMUS PHILIPPUS  PHILODAMUS  Thank thee my gallant son thou'st sav'd my life  Where is my Erato Where is Euphemia  PHILIPPUS  Under strong guard Epicrates conducts them  To his own houseAlas you bleed my father  PHILODAMUS  Fear not for I am whole yet the vile Rubrius  Had near subdued me till a lucky struggle  Freed me and pass'd my dagger through his arm  Thence come these stains  PHILIPPUS  Would it had been his heart  Or rather that of Verres  PHILODAMUS  Who lies here  PHILIPPUS  This was Cornelius fain I would have sav'd him  But stupid duty forc'd him upon death  What have we now to do  Cornelius  carried off    PHILODAMUS  Why this Philippus  To draw up our complaint against this Verres  And send it to the PraetorWell Epicrates  Enter EPICRATES  Say are the women safe  EPICRATES  Yes they are safe  But Verres and his crew had well nigh perish'd  Fir'd with just indignation at your wrongs  The populace pursu'd him to his palace  Where finding it impossible to enter  They heap'd up faggots ev'ry thing combustible  To have reduc'd him and his house to ashes  When most unluckily for our revenge  Arriv'd the Roman praetor Dolabella  Whose presence stay'd them and dispers'd the tumult  PHILODAMUS  I'm glad they were prevented  PHILIPPUS  And I sorry  PHILODAMUS  For justice executed by the people  Loses its name and grows most dangerous  What have we here another Roman guard  Enter OFFICER and SOLDIERS  OFFICER  Philodamus and you Philippus Sirs  Ye are my pris'ners and must to the forum  PHILIPPUS  Pris'ners for what because we did not hold  Our throats conveniently to have them cut  Nor make the offer of our maidens honour  To the insatiate appetite of Verres  EPICRATES  And is there no mistake that you omit me  Oh take me too I blush to be at liberty  OFFICER  You are not charg'd Their lot deserves no envy  PHILODAMUS  When Hadrian the praetor by extortions  Had rak'd th' inhabitants of Utica  Beyond the sufferance of human nature  Despair at last gave vent to their resentment  And they consum'd him and his spoils and palace  To dust by fire unquestion'd since of Rome  OFFICER  I am not here to reason but command  So come along  PHILODAMUS  Do you Epicrates  Acquaint my daughters and come after us  Exeunt all but  Epicrates  EPICRATES  Confusion thou hast caught us in thy net  Enter EUPHEMIA  EUPHEMIA  Where is Philippus tell me is he safe  EPICRATES  Why hast thou ventur'd desp'rate to this roof  Know you not all beneath it is accurs'd  Ruin and death inhabit the waste structure  While overhead like a black cloud destruction  Low'rs on the whole and meditates to burst  On all it finds in the devoted verge  Escape if yet you may fly to my house  There shelter from the storm Why left you Erato  EUPHEMIA  Ay is he dead and I survive him yet  EPICRATES  He lives The praetor's guard conducts him chain'd  Him and Philodamus both to the forum  The Legate's fury drives at such a rate  'Tis manifest at what it will arrive  EUPHEMIA  He lives Bless'd be the tongue that tells me so  Heav'n and their innocence will soon acquit them  And punishment must light where due on Verres  Soon as the Roman praetor is inform'd  He'll blush they have been chain'd as criminals  EPICRATES  Can power blush or feels oppression shame  Then I'll believe the crocodile may weep  Nay more surrender his uninjur'd prey  Ah let us not confide in innocence  What is there else that tyranny can hate  And what it hates what hinders it to punish  EUPHEMIA  Can any tyranny make selfdefence  A punishable crime The Roman virtue  Holds the first station in the world's esteem  And their politeness has such gen'ral fame  'Tis thought to overpay the wrongs of conquest  EPICRATES  I've been at Rome The insolence of conquerors  Coins their own fame and we their slaves adopt  What character their pride stamps on themselves  Virtue at Rome means to enslave the world  Politeness is another name for luxury  That gorges at a mess the wealth of nations  Such justice as these principles afford  We may expect to find and nothing better  EUPHEMIA  I catch your fears yet hope you fear too much  EPICRATES  Let us prepare us as the worst were certain  'Tis my request Euphemia that you chuse  My house my friendship and the love of Erato  As your protection in this dread calamity  And lest you fear seeing in friendship's name  How many seek to buy a slave a pennyworth  Time and familiarity should shrink you  From parity into a mean dependence  Soon as you pass my threshold twenty talents  Wait your acceptance  EUPHEMIA  Worthy of Philippus  Thou art his match in virtue as in friendship  Such thanks as my poor gratitude can pay  EPICRATES  The time will not admit of farther reasoning  Let me prevail and wish you back to Erato  Farewell Each minute I'll dispatch a messenger  Who shall inform you both of all that passes  Exit  EUPHEMIA  Success attend thy steps  Kneels  Allruling Power  We know not how to name and therefore wander  Thro' almost infinite denominations  To mark thy various attributes and functions  Who must love justice Oh if ever now  Exert thyself free from thy gen'ral laws  And speak in prodigies enact and vindicate  Thy equitable mandates Villain Man  Will construe else thy patience a connivance  And deal out wrong secure of punishment  Exit  End of ACT IV  ACT V  SCENE I  DOLABELLA VERRES  DOLABELLA  I could almost repent me that I came  A little later  VERRES  Had been all too late  So violent an insult on the name  Of Roman then shall pass unvindicated  DOLABELLA  I must be of opinion that the insult  Keeps just proportion with the provocation  For what could violence itself do more  Than ravish from a father's arms his daughter  To violate her honour in your own  VERRES  There might be that my lord may want excuse  But not much blame If I went selfinvited  It was because these misers grudge t'expose  Their statues pictures gemsyou know I'm curious  Wine and young blood must plead for all that follow'd  DOLABELLA  Rather too curious For they tell me Verres  That your immense collection is extended  By rapine and extortion to a size  That even beggars all that Rome possesses  VERRES  My lord I gather for myself and friends  And by the by 'tis long since I observ'd  A vacant base stand in your vestibule  I have a masterpiece of art an heifer  So exquisitely cast such through nature  The work of Myro life is in the brass  It would with dignity supply the vacancy  DOLABELLA  I know it by report the very same  So many Grecian wits have celebrated  VERRES  I vow my lord I've started twenty times  And thought she low'dbut as to this affair  I do assure you what concerns me most  Is the indignity the state endures  DOLABELLA  A state is more dishonour'd in protecting  Th' infringer of the sacred rights of nature  VERRES  My lord share my collection as you please  I hope when you reflect on th' injury  In your immediate Legate done to Rome  Besides my birth 'twill move you to outbear me  Thro' any slight deficiency of form  DOLABELLA  Believe me I'm desirous to assist you  But of so ugly nature is your crime  I know not where to turn me to effect it  VERRES  Cornelius slain and Rubrius sorely wounded  Direct your vengeance to both perpetrators  I don't know if you ever thought worth minding  Th' entaglio which I wear upon this finger  View it my lord the subject's somewhat wanton  See how that Leda clasps in her crisp arms  Her am'rous swan who ruffles ev'ry feather  The figure was design'd from my Chelidon  Poor wench dying she left me all her treasure  I have been tempted to destroy this ring  A thousand times The counterfeit resemblance  Makes me quite mad when I behold her beauties  Tasted by Jove himselfWould you would wear it  If only to preserve it from my jealousy  DOLABELLA  And am beholden to youbut to murther  Two innocent men of elevated stations  Only that they resisted your attempt  I should not like to have such matter argued  Before the senate by your men of virtue  VERRES  My friends at Rome my lord bought and to buy  Will bear us through Who cares there for the provinces  Shrowded in distance from their thought and notice  Thenpray my Lord what makes a man of virtue  To sell one's knav'ry dearer than another  I had almost forgot'tis but a trifle  Knowing the vast expences of your state  Long since I laid aside a little present  With your permission I will bring it to you  Tomorrow morning nay 'tis nothing more  Than some poor hundred thousand sesterces  DOLABELLA  I thank you for your love and I accept them  Why as you say in such a distant province  The majesty of RomeCornelius slain  And your high birthrequire this vindication  Where are the prisoners  VERRES  They wait without  And were I to advise immediate sentence  Were doubly useful by impressing awe  Of your authority and stifling tumults  DOLABELLA  And you say well let them appear before us  Verres be you and Sestius my assessors  So take your seats Bring in the prisoners  Voices within  Stand by  Make room  Give way there to the prisoners  SCENE II  Enter PHILODAMUS EPICRATES PHILIPPUS  and Audience    Philippus  starts on seeing  Verres  DOLABELLA  We sit not here to have our ears fatigu'd  With set orations from yourselves much less  With the stale subterfuges of hir'd advocates  Who dodging thro' a thousand circumstances  Hope in the course of a longwinded argument  Obscure traverse involv'd to warp the judgment  Which way they please when they've bewilder'd sense  This matter needs no arguing and no witnesses  Unless you chuse the body of Cornelius  A Roman citizen slain by your hands  Beneath your roof should be produc'd in court  PHILODAMUS  We shall not tire your patience I had thought  When I appear'd before the Roman praetor  Without employing any turn of eloquence  To've laid out a plain story to his hearing  Th' undue invasion of a house like mine  Insolence injury and violence  Suffer'd at length repell'd I own it needless  Verres plac'd by you on the seat of judgment  Cuts it all shortand we expect our sentence  DOLABELLA  To his Assessors  I am for death and you  VERRES  For death  SESTIUS  And I  EPICRATES  Forgive most noble if I interfere  With your injunction I'm no venal advocate  But am connected with these prisoners  By ev'ry band that friendship and esteem  Love duty obligation can impose  My fortunes are extensive and shall answer  Whatever mulct you please to levy on them  Nay take them all I never can be poor  While I reflect how well they were employ'd  So that their lives be spar'd and you accept  The ruin of us three as equipollent  For one the scum of Rome by birth and station  VERRES  Most noble Dolabella not to sit  Quite useless in this honourable place  Permit me to observe this forward pleader  Makes ev'n his intercession aggravate  The mistress of the world has ever seen  Her meanest citizen as of more dignity  Than any subject conquer'd by those citizens  And she demands that blood compensate blood  Retire and thank the lenity that spares you  DOLABELLA  Verres you speak our thoughts most accurately  To  Verres  PHILIPPUS  Had it been thee and not thy senseless agent  Whom in a sister's cause I bravely slew  I would not have repin'd to bear these chains  Nor what is worse to follow As it is  We thank you that determin'd to destroy us  You save us an unprofiting defence  PHILODAMUS  Happy condition of your provinces  We were to learn till now that we rebel  If we dispute your sovereign dominion  Over our matrons and our daughters honour  DOLABELLA  We have indulg'd you farther than we meant  In large discourse which you have us'd too freely  Bear them away to death Let the axe sever  Their heads and bodies  PHILODAMUS  By your leave one moment  Heav'n cannot be but just I do believe  Its gates are open in another manner  Than to the general requests of men  When innocence subdu'd by hard oppression  Claims its avenging hand In thy due hour  When Verres shall be ripe for punishment  When the large growth of villany shall bend  His branches to the earth with their own weight  I trust thou wilt in adequate reprisal  Set up thy hourglass of retaliation  I think I see thee not as I am now  Going to die death is no penalty  But abject pale contemn'd shunn'd and deserted  By those who share thy spoils Banish'd and wandering  Thro' provinces thy rapine trod before  I feel an ease that tells me I am heard  PHILIPPUS  Oh heav'n if there be yet in Rome one heart  One soul that's worthy of thy inspiration  One tongue that dares to plead the cause of innocence▪  And something says within me there is one  Who shall retort the doings of this day  Do thou inform that heart that soul that tongue  With the coercive force of eloquence  The energy of language pour from thence  The mighty torrent of convictive truth  Till conscience strike with dumbness thy defenders  And guilt and shame anticipate that sentence  Thou dare not stay to hear pronounc'd upon thee  To  Dolabella  And thou distorter of thy country's justice  Live to revenge our wrongs upon that country  For trusting justice in no firmer hands  DOLABELLA  Take them away See execution done  st Guard  Stand by there  d Guard  Clear the way  d Guard  Lead off the prisoners  SCENE III  DOLABELLA  solus    I am not half the villain of this Verres  And yet I am a villain 'Tis too plain  To be a villain and yet hate a villain  To feel that vigilant and solemn monitor  Conscience put in her caveat to a deed  And yet to supersede her holy mandates  And give that deed effect what is it else  Than to be multiplied into two men  That wage continual war against each other  Would I were of a piece either all honest  Or else above sensation of remorse  Enter  an Officer    What would you  OFFICER  The relations of the sufferers  Most humbly sue you they may have their bodies  For all due rites  DOLABELLA  See that they have my order  Exit Officer  It were not yet too late to bid them live  But then I must refund m' illgotten wealth  Thou hast betray'd me allcorrupting gold  And thaw'd the yielding principles of honesty  Into a puddle of corrupted trash  Ha Conscience thou art but the fear of shame  I am not superstitious yet am startled  That he who perhaps never heard of Cicero  Should mark him in his lineaments so strongly  Methought I felt myself beneath the lash  The scorpion lash of his allawing tongue  I'll think no more on'tInnocence once quitted  Turns irrecov'rably her back upon us  Let none untried by pow'r think himself virtuous  But for authority I'd still been honest  Exit  SCENE V  PHILODAMUS PHILIPPUS  going to execution  EPICRATES  Guards c  EPICRATES  Fear not he must desist from his mad enterprize  Mean time we arm with utmost speed a vessel  Which shall transport us past his search to safety  PHILODAMUS  'Tis well Epicrates I would not see her  For much I doubt how my own resolution  Might stand the burst of so much tenderness  EPICRATES  She's most desirous to receive by me  The blessing and last orders of a father  PHILODAMUS  My blessing why my life has been to bless her  This last formality can add no weight to it  However take my blessing on you both  Then as to orders what should I command her  Bid her persist in the pursuit of virtue  Her life insures she will or should I charge her  She bear unvaried duty and affection  To thee Her inclinations answer for her  Be it your care to comfort her distress  Teach her submission to the will of Heaven  EPICRATES  Alas my father what a leave to take  PHILODAMUS  My deathbed ow'd me a severer end  Another word and then we part Epicrates  One article remains of dearest import  If this fierce tempest of calamity  When fall'n its rage should chance to drive on shore  Any the wrecks and fragments of my fortunes  Collect them safely for Euphemia  EPICRATES  I have already offer'd her my house  Begg'd her to share my fortunes  PHILIPPUS  embracing him  Oh Epicrates  Oh friend indeed What would I give for words  Yet could they more than call thee friend indeed  EPICRATES  Oh my Philippus Oh my better half  I live not half without thee  GUARD  Come make haste  PHILIPPUS  My last thoughts to Euphemia and my sister  Exit  Epicrates  PHILODAMUS  Be gone Epicrates And now Philippus  I have no leave to take of thee my boy  We're bound on the same voyage Only this  I have prevail'd upon the executioner  To spare thy eyes my death and you wait here  Till I am past So now lead on I'm ready  PHILIPPUS  To thy last thought the same▪ my gentle father  Exit  Philodamus  Enter EUPHEMIA  Why art thou here Euphemia to unman me  Now that I've born the parting of a father  With all I have of steadiness art thou come  To rob me of that last of vanities  Which cowards sometimes reach the dying resolute  I'm young am born to dignity and affluence  Have health untainted and th' esteem of friends  These I could have resign'd yet be myself  And mock the phantom death What is a world  That one must ask the leave of Rome to live in  But when I view thy beauties which I quit  Purchas'd but unpossess'd there lies the agony  And it grows terrible indeed to die  EUPHEMIA  I came to steel thy breast and not to melt it  Into the whining softness of a woman  And why regret to die since we have lov'd  And have enjoy'd already never doubt it  All that is keen and exquisite in love  The rest deserves small notice Be like me  I feel my soul exalted 'bove itself  Secure and pleas'd in its own resolution  It looks with intrepidity on death  PHILIPPUS  What dost thou mean Euphemia thou alarm'st me  There's a determination in thine eye  And firmness in thy speech that makes me tremble  More than the axe that waits me Oh dismiss  Thy desp'rate thought whatever Live Euphemia  Cherish my memory nor let that affect thee  Beyond a melancholy recollection  How much we lov'd and how unfortunately  EUPHEMIA  There are Philippus in Distress's quiver  Some shafts so very deeply barb'd they mock  The unavailing art that would extract them  And will be left to rankle in the wound  But did the world possess the balm to heal them  'Twere meanness to survive distinguish'd wretchedness  What to be pointed at and shown a sight  As one no misery could drive from life  See here the remedy of ev'ry woe  See here the cure of Verres  Shews a dagger  PHILIPPUS  'Twas my fear  That dagger no thou must not shalt not use it  Ah do not listen to that witch Despair  Who gilds with a false sunshine the black precipice  T' allure the suff'ring mind  EUPHEMIA  The suff'ring mind  'Twas then it suffer'd when my glory bid  The chasm of separation yawn between us  'Twas harder to resolve to part our loves  Adoring and ador'd than share thy death  PHILIPPUS  In this dread hour it was my consolation  Epicrates had lent thee noble shelter  From all the storms that yet might buffet life  Oh harbour there and drop the social tear  In consort oft as you shall think of me  Till slowpac'd time nay habitude of sorrow  Induce satiety of itself Who knows  Long years of happiness may wait behind  That shall do justice to Euphemia's merit  EUPHEMIA  Yes and be comforted dry up my tears  My mourning weeds convert to ornament  Whimper but now and then and in a moment  Call any other man my only love  The thought is paltry Oh how I disdain it  Why now methinks I'm at the pitch of happiness  High in my own esteem 'Tis only now  That I feel worthy of a flame like thine  I'm all on fire to shuffle off this life  'Tis an impatience that still spurs me forward  The Gods conceal from those they force to live  How happy 'tis to die lest they desist  From their hard drudg'ry and desert their station  PHILIPPUS  If ever tender thought of me has glow'd  Within that gentle bosomdost not hear  Horrid the blow that ends the best of fathers  Noise within  The time demands meLet me yet prevail  Voice within  Lead on the prisoner  PHILIPPUS  'Tis my last request  EUPHEMIA  But a request you have no right to make  Nay talk no more Farewell This last embrace  If memory extend beyond the urn  Still shall we love each other Now away  Farewell my love my pride my happiness  That I am thine o'erpays the loss of life  PHILIPPUS  An instant longer  EUPHEMIA  Why an instant longer  And should the tyrant grant us till tomorrow  Think you we'd take it  Guard takes hold of him  Come nay come along  PHILIPPUS  I gobut would'Tis easier to die  Exit she looking fondly after him till just as he is out of sight she stabs herself He reenters  Unhand me for a moment rash Euphemia  EUPHEMIA  I thought thee fartheror had spar'd thee this  'Tis overhasteoh loiter not behind  Where are younow you're lostI see thee not  Night hangs upon my eyesand thou art no where  Oh now again I know him'tis Philippus  At least rememberohthat I diethine  PHILIPPUS  Kind executioner be quick dispatch  Why do I ask what I can do myself  With readier expedition  Stabs himself with her dagger  Guard  Haste prevent him  You are too late  PHILIPPUS  I thank thee for thy lesson  Now Verres thy revenge is half deceiv'd  Now Dolabella I elude thy sentence  Stay let me seize her hand ere light desert me  Else I shall wander in uncertain search  And find it notWhy now in spite of numbness  I hold thee fastto separateno more  Enter EPICRATES  EPICRATES  Sure she came hither yet I dread to find her  Ha is it so my fears inform'd me just  Philippus art thou here I knew indeed  Death waited for thee but in other place  And other manner Better as it is  Tears by your leave a while there's time enough  For your indulgence Who commands the guard here  OFFICER  'Tis I  EPICRATES  Here is an order from the praetor  Rend'ring their bodies up to my disposal  It names but two the third was unforeseen  But will be undisputed Let some bear them  To join their fathers corpse then to my house  Their hands fast link'd convey them if you can  Without disjointing their so tender union  Virtue thou art not for this present world  Injustice 'tis thine own But there is somewhere  Some happy clime beyond Oppression's reach  Whence Tyranny retires its shorten'd arm  And compensation waits for suff'ring innocence  Bear them away I follow  Exit the bodies carried before him  The END
