 A POSTSCRIPT TO  JOHN BULL  Containing the HISTORY of the CrownInn With the DEATH of the WIDOW And what happened thereon  The Sixth Edition  LONDON  Printed for J MOOR and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster  Price  d  THE HISTORY  c  _YOU desire me to give you some Account of the Death of the  Widow  at the  CROWNINN  in the  Metropolis  of this Country and how Affairs have gone since you left the Place  The  Widow  you know was a good sort of a Woman she was Pious and Charitable and did a great deal of Good among her poor Neighbours Went constantly to the ParishChurch on  Sundays  and in general had the Character of a conscientious motherly Woman  Her Husband whilst he lived was one of the honestest Men breathing 'Tis true he would take his Glass in Company as all his Countrymen will do But he was a downright honest Fellow and lov'd the Town and we shall never forget how tightly he stood by  when Sir  Jacob  our High Sheriff would have infring'd on our  Right of Commoning  Poor Man he kept her from ill Advice whilst  he lived and the whole Country was heartily sorry for his Death having not left an honester Man behind him in the  Parish  But what need I tell you things which you are as well acquainted with as my self only to refresh your Memory in some  Passages  previous to your Request You desire to know the Disposition of the Estate and how the  Three Farms  stand affected at this Day  You remember at her first coming to the House she found the Debts of an old  LawSuit  to be paid which had lasted long and a new one just ready to begin which no body could guess the Event of Money there was little or none in the House and only a few  Exchequer  Notes which no body but the Exciseman would take for Ready Money  Her  Tenants  and  Customers  were very unwilling to see her ruined and as she had treated them very handsomly at her  Housewarming  they swore they would stand by her against all Opposers By Opposers you know who they meant For it was by this time certainly known that old  Savage  the Extortioner had set up a  Competitor  against her  Pretending  he was a real  Branch  of the antient Family of the  Shute  's formerly Lords of the  MANOR  and brought a Writ of Ejectment in his Name and fee'd Council against the Widow This  Savage  is one who has always made it his business to entertain Renegadoes and Impostors and by forged Deeds and Wills to take Possession of Estates  and then maintain them by trouble some Law Suits till at last he has shared a handsome Composition for himself You cannot chuse too but know that both by  Will  and  Deed  of  Gift  the House it self as well as the  Three Farms  had been settled on her near  Kinsman  Mr WRIGHT a Man whom all the honest  Tenants  wished to succeed her as well in her Life as in the time of her  Predecessor  To be short as you must needs know a hazardous  Suit  commenced and because it should not lye too hard upon the Widow many of her Friends became Parties to it Honest  John Trusty  by general Consent was made chief Agent in the  Cause  who the first  Term  put the  Widow  's Affairs in a good Posture and for several  Terms  following was continually gaining one Advantage or other over her Adversaries so that they began now to sue for  Composition  and a Meeting was appointed on both sides but refusing to allow sufficient Costs and Damages the  Law  went on  In this promising State stood Affairs when that furious  Pulpiteer  the  Curate  of  HighHam  came to preach at  Hockley  where having pack'd up a Sermon for the purpose he infus'd Sedition among the  Widow  's  Tenants  and  Customers  insinuating that she began to sell in  short Measure  Brew'd with  Homemade Malt  and let her  Lawyers Bookkeepers Ostlers Chamberlain Tapster c  run away with what should pay the  Excise  He inveighed  vehemently against the  Parson of the Parish  and other  Heads  of tke Town for not repairing the CHURCH one part of which he said was  damaged  and ready to  fall  whilst the  Conventicle  was upheld by some about her and a Parcel of  GYPSIES  kept privately in the  Barn  to eat her out of House and Home  The Fellow had a good Talent at Railing and could run on with as much Impudence as a Mountebank exhibits his Pacquet In short the Poison worked so subtly that the whole Country was put in a Ferment The Curate was taken up and brought before the  Bench of Justices  where tho' he was reprimanded and ordered to find Sureties for his  Good Behaviour  for Years yet it did not quiet the People who cry'd out  The Church the Church  and ran up and down in Tumults as tho' it had been falling on their Heads whilst to strengthen the matter the  Curate  took a  Journey  round the Country possessing the People that the  House  was haunted and bid them take care how they came near it any more directing them to the  Pope  's  Head  and  Dagger  near the  Cross  At this time one  Robin Slyboots  a  Welch Buttonmaker  a notorious cunning Fellow and fam'd for a  Conjurer  who had formerly belonged to the Family but was turned out for making too bold with the  Widow  's Secrets This Fellow took his Opportunity to corrupt one of the  Widow  's Maids by pretending  to tell her her Fortune which such gigling Wenches are generally fond of so that taking her one Day as she was sweeping the Rooms and making the Beds he began in this manner  "  Nab  says he I have often taken notice that thou art a Painstaking industrious Girl and hast lived a great while in thy Service without coming to any Advancement 'Tis true you sweep the Rooms make the Beds and get a little sorry Vails of the  Guests  but 'tis Mrs  Sarah  runs away with all the Profit and keeps her whole Family at your Mistresses charge But tho' she now flouts the  Widow  and flies and bounces like bottled Ale thou shalt one day if thou tak'st my Advice come to be as high as she Remember it  Nab  I say thou shalt come to be a Lady"  "Bless me says  Nab  with a simpering Countenance knowing he had long had the Reputation of a Conjurer is it possible that I should come to such Preferment as you say That you may believe me says  Robin  go presently and look on the Bed in the  Green Room  there lies a  Calicoe Gown  and  Peticoat  lin'd thro' with the same ask your Mistress for it and she will give it you As you find this true believe me in the rest"  Nab  no longer able to contain her self flung down her Besom and ran to the place where finding it as he had said she returned overjoyed  "But Mr  Slyboots  says  Nab  how is this thing to be effected I'll tell you says  Robin  At Midnight when all things are quiet you shall plant me in some Corner and for the greater Solemnity I will have my  Conjurers Gown  on You must on your part infuse strange things into her Head and tell her as many  Tales  as you can of the Servants Then bring in some talk of the  Curate  tell her what a good Man he is and that he had always a great Respect for her insinuate that the Design of bringing him before the  Bench of Justices  was to disgrace the  Church  and that those who were his Friends she may assure her self are hers and whilst she is musing on these things for I know it will work on her Religious Spirit I will appear and then leave the rest to me"  Nab  in the mean time had got the  Gown  and  Peticoat  which  Robin  spoke of and was pretty sure the rest of his  Predictions  would follow In fine the  Widow  was so possessed and deluded by  Nab  's whining and this  Conjuring  Rascal's Cant that tho' otherwise a Woman of Sense she grew perfectly enflam'd so that without examining farther into the matter giving Ear to  Nab  's Tales she presently began to Reform her Family and a great many of the honestest  Tenants  had warning given them against the next Quarterday However the  LawSuit  continuing they did not yet think fit to turn out honest  John  the  Agent  because the taking the  Papers  out of his Hands might be dangerous to the  CAUSE  Among the rest to make room for  Robin Ralph  the  Cashkeeper  was dismissed a downright honest Fellow and had held his Place long with great Integrity tho' many of her best  Customers  told her they would leave the House and stand by her no longer if she took these Courses But all did not avail every thing went as  Robin  advised in fine she turn'd away all her old honest Servants dissolved the  Club  that was kept at her House and none were held in favour but such as had appeared to be Friends to the  Curate  or were  Robin  's Creatures  Robin  was first made  Bookkeeper  and  UnderCashkeeper  and after  HeadCashkeeper  which was what he all along aimed at He grew angry now at being called plain  Robin  and nothing would go down but Mr  Slyboots  at every word He changed his Sign which was before the  Three Buttonmoles  and hung up in the room of it the  Star  and  Garter  finely painted and had Vanity and Impudence enough to take the two  Angels  for  Supporters  to his  SignPost  All that he said or did if it may bear an old Pun was  Bob as a Robin  he brought in all his Friends Fellows as poor as  Howlets  to rule the Roast and fill their hungry Bellies at the Widow's Table such an avaritious Crew as were hardly worth hanging a Medley of  Welch CrateCarriers Pedlars  Retalers of  Hobnails Brickdust  c and among the rest advanced  Harry Aucumy  the Brazier an audacious lewd young Fellow to be one of the  Clerks of the Brewhouse  This was a docible young Dog for  Robin  's Purpose and by a pert way of speaking in the  Club  dexterously advanc'd the Reputation of  Robin  's Proceedings In short all went swimmingly in the  INN  for a Year or two and the Rogues with thriving Faces caressed one another in their Iniquity  But they found the  LawSuit  began to hang heavy on their Hands they had not the same Credit that the former Servants had to borrow Money and they had none of their own to lend The  Rino  was wanted to pay Fees and the  Tenants  were very backward to advance more so that finding they were like to bring an old House upon their Heads if they went on they were resolved at any rate to come to an Accommodation and  Harry Aucumy  was sent privately to old  Savage  's House to treat about it tho' they had still told the  Tenants  it should be push'd on  vigorously  next  Term  and constantly got Money out of them for that purpose  Thinking their Business was now done they put honest  John Trusty  out of the Agency and like a Parcel of ungrateful Curs set their Black Guard to pelt him but the honest People of the Town could not forbear expressing their Love in respect to his upright and judicious Dealing by welcoming him Home with loud Acclamations which fretted the Rogues  to the Plucks to see him so caressed by whose good  Management  the  Cause  had been brought to that Issue that  Judgment  was order'd to be enter'd up and  Execution  would certainly have follow'd the very next  Term  It will be tedious to relate all the intricate Passages of the Law and how the Widow's Friends resolv'd to carry the Cause on without her but that  Robin  had ordered the new  Agent Jacob Rush  to stifle many of the chief Witnesses by which the Adversary's Attorney found means to stop Judgment  To amuse the  Tenants  who they knew would be alarm'd at this Proceeding it was given out that the  Widow  's  Friends  had not paid their share of the  LawCharges  but that all the  Burden  had lain upon her which had run her grievously in Debt and that she was in a manner forc'd to a Composition and had Offers now of a very good one much to the Advantage of her self and her  Friends  This took with the silly People and in spight of all the Intreaties of her honest  Tenants  an Agreement soon followed which however had taken up more Time and Money to effect than would have decided it at  CommonLaw  'Tis true we burnt our Faggotstacks set the Bells a ringing and illumined our Windows but we soon experienc'd that Humiliation would have become us better The House lost its Trade and no body in Town almost had any thing to do People began to see into this when it was too late and no Remedy  could be found to help them Our  old Friends  exclaimed against us as a treacherous and base sort of People and shun'd the Town and our new ones apparently slighted us tho' we had done them such signal Service Nor could we so much as obtain to have the  QuarterSessions  kept here tho' our Credit before used to draw every Body to us  They began to cavil now at the  Widow  's Will in favour of Mr WRIGHT and tho' they durst not openly declare themselves yet 'tis known they were endeavouring to inveigle the People into an Opinion of young  Shute  's Title and dispers'd  Papers  to prove it nor did they use Mr WRIGHT as tho' they ever expected he would come to the Estate All we could do was to wish them hang'd before they should bring it to pass for you must know we hate the young Fellow heartily His Father Sir  Jacob  if he was honestly begot used us horribly quarter'd Soldiers upon us threaten'd our  Charter  and play'd the Devil for God's sake thro' the whole Country till we were fain to send him packing and 'tis very well known the young Rogue will never forgive us for't  The  Widow  being to send one to old  Savage  's to adjust Accounts on the Accommodation who should these  Achitophels  advise her to but  Jacob Booty  a notorious Friend to the Family of the  Shute  's This put us in such a Fright that we were ready to offer a Leg or Arm out of every Family for Indemnity For  we supposed he could have no other  Business  but to strike up a Bargain at old  Savage  's but as it happened we had the good Fortune to see him die in a Ditch before he set out and save the Hn a labour whose Occupation 'tis said he had merited a few Years before by endeavouring to give the  Young Gentleman  Possession of the  North  Farm with design to burn and plunder it if he could not hold it by Law  In short every Day produced fresh Instances of our Misfortunes and of the Villanies of those who had betray'd us Old  Savage  who before we had reduced to be as poor as a  Church Mouse  so that he lay even at our Mercy began to bully us again reserving many of the Conditions of the Agreement unexecuted He demolished a  Turnpike  upon the  River  which had been a great Annoyance to our  Trade  but fallaciously erected another a little nearer home and eluded the chief Article of the  Accommodation  he promised to dismiss young  Shute  out of his Family and with a mental Reservation only sent him to board with one of his Tenants at next Door Moreover he engaged to use his Interest with young  Savage  his Grandson in behalf of some  Poor People  that lay at his Mercy on account of serving the  Widow  who appear'd under a great concern for them instead of which like an accomplish'd  Hypocrite  he sent his  Mirmidons  and  Bayliffs  to haul them to  Execution  Every thing was acted with the same Candour and seem'd to be pulling on our Ruin whilst our  Agents  at home out of the poorness of Spirit durst not wag a Tongue or a Finger against him they lay so open and so exposed by the Rogueries he was privy to Ah poor  Country  What could relieve thee but a Miracle Or what animate thy Hopes but the Interposition of  Providence  that dear that eternal Providence which had rescu'd thee in the like Cases of imminent Danger Would you believe it Sir that these  Desperados  having no other way to shelter themselves were just entering into a Conspiracy to undermine Mr WRIGHT's Interest and carry the Trade to the  Pope  's  Head  It could not be expected that Men associated in Mischief should long agree among themselves which Maxim 'tis very probable produced the old Proverb  When  Rs  and  Ws  fall out honest Men come by their Goods  You may apply it as you please the use I shall make of it is only to tell you that the House began to be divided against itself and so could not stand long  Robin  had now brought up a Bird to pick out his Eyes his  Pupil Harry  had got the Start of him and jockeyed him out of the  Widow  's Favour  Harry  took up a Resolution to spur at all  aut Caesar aut nullus  but  Robin  who had always a great Veneration for his Neck was willing to jog on soberly  Harry  out of the Vivacity of his Temper told him he was a Fellow of no Spirit  and that his Cowardice quite baulk'd the Cause Yes says  Robin  very dryly but it may be a means of saving your Neck if you take Example by it and act with a little more Deliberation and Gravity This in the end came to an open Rupture so that one Day above the rest they fell to it Pel mel before the  Widow Robin  among other things charged him with Ingratitude and told him  "He took him up an idle loose young Fellow stragling about the Town when he had hardly nine Pence in his Pocket to go to a Whore withal that he brought him acquainted at the Widow's and put him into Business he might live handsomely upon if he had the Grace to follow it but that it was plain he was as loose as ever and his Management would be the Ruin of his Mistress if he went on as he begun"  Harry  justly fired at this Language call'd him  muddyheaded Fellow  and said  "If it had not been for him his  Mistress  might have made a more advantageous  Composition  "  Robin  in return to that upbraided him with his hairbrain'd Negotiations and that he suffer'd himself to be made drunk and overreach'd at old  Savage  's where says he unless your  Interview  with young  Shute  for which I hope to see you hang'd a few fine Congees and two or three lewd  Intrigues  the rest was owing to your Companion  Matt  the  Tavern Boy  who was fain to carry Brains for his Master  Harry  could hardly contain himself  but with a very cloudy Brow told him he had neither Brains nor any other Merit to raise him above the Character of a  Trickster  We know now says he why none but  Cousin Tom  could be trusted at Mr WRIGHT's but thou wast ever a trimming equivocal Rascal and woo't so continue  Sim  the  Scrivener  put in a word on the same side whom  Robin  took up very smartly As for your part says  Robin  did I not raise you from a  Petifogger  to be  what you are took you from writing hackney up and down lent you Money to pay your Debts and help'd you to live like a Man and you to conspire against me too But by  Jove rapping his Knuckles upon the Table  I'll make you all as poor and beggarly as I found you  Thou wert always a Trickster reply'd  Sim I hated you before but now I despise you Nab  too open'd her Quail pipe at  Robin  but what she said is not recorded  The  Widow  heard all this with a Mixture of Grief and Surprize but above all she wondered to hear them talk of a better  Composition  when she had all along been told  it was a very good one  she plainly perceived now she had been trick'd especially by  Robin  who she declar'd  had not told her one word of truth from the beginning  so that  Harry  for the present seem'd to carry his  Point Robin  was order'd to deliver up his Books which were soon after given to the  Chamberlain  one of the honestest Servants in the Family which partly shew'd the Widow's good Disposition  for as he was known to be very well affected to Mr WRIGHT's Title it shewed her own Inclination thereto by pitching on a Person so very acceptable This rejoic'd People strangely and the more because there had passed a current Rumour for some time that they had been tampering with her to transfer the Estate to young  Shute  after her Decease contrary to Law How true it is God knows but it seems they were disappointed And I can assure you she told some of her Friends that she had often repented the dismissing her old Servants who had served her faithfully and given Content to her Customers and if it pleased God to grant her Life and Health she would make a very great  Alteration  in Affairs  But in short what thro' the Grief and Fright she had conceiv'd at their unmannerly Behaviour before her and the Anguish of a former Distemper it threw the Pain into her Head with such Violence that it soon put an end to her Life for which the whole Town shew'd a general Concern and lamented her as a pious good and charitable Woman whom it may be truly said  they brought with Sorrow to the Grave  Immediately after she expir'd the  Trustees  took Possession of the  Premises  in Mr WRIGHT's Name I cannot describe the infinite Joy on this Occasion and that wonderful Satisfaction that appear'd in People's  Countenances All was acted with that Calmness and Unanimity that Cheerfulness and Alacrity as seemed plainly to prognosticate our future Good No one was wanting to do his part nay even the  Parson of the Parish  tho' crazy with Age and Infirmities yet appear'd abroad that Day to countenance Mr WRIGHT's Title being one of the  Feofees  in  Trust  for him  Poor  Harry Aucumy  indeed appear'd under a very deep Pressure of Mind not so much for the Loss of the  Widow  as the sole Power and Grandeur he conceiv'd himself fallen from and the Inconveniences his past Conduct might bring him into for he knew in his Conscience he should find it a difficult Matter to acquit himself honestly to Mr WRIGHT This occasion'd a visible Alteration in his Countenance and poor  Harry  looked as queer and dejected as one of the Vulgar He put himself in close  Mourning  and exploded all Lewdness for nine Days which you know is the ultimate Date of all Wonders especially with  Harry John Squeamish  the HeadTapster a queer insignificant Fellow of  Bob  's preferring  Sam Peticoat  the Warehouse keeper  Will Wildfire Harry  's Intimate  Dick  the PowderMonkey and  Nab  his Sister with some others seem to lament with the same Humiliation and Concern the great Vicissitude of Fortune  We expect our new  Landlord  with the utmost Impatience and then you shall have a farther Account of what happens assuring you that this leaves us under the most promising Aspect of having our Affairs retriev'd again from the languishing Condition the last three Years had thrown them into and perhaps you never saw a more visible Spirit of Joy than appears at present  Yours c  PS  As I divined poor  Harry  is dismiss'd from his  Clerkship  by order of Mr WRIGHT and a Padlock clapp'd on the  Countinghouse  Just now I learn from a Friend that his Accounts are very confused and occasion divers Speculations We are like to have a great Sessions on't next time  Bob  laughs in his Sleeve  Adieu
