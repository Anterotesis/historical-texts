 THE SONGS RECITATIVES AIRS DUETS TRIOS AND CHORUSSES INTRODUCED IN THE PANTOMIME ENTERTAINMENT OF THE ENCHANTED CASTLE AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN THE WORDS BY MILES PETER ANDREWS  Esq  AND THE MUSIC BY MR SHIELDS  "Of  FORESTS  and  ENCHANTMENTS  drear  "Where more is meant than meets the ear"  MILTON's Penseroso  emblem of the Prince of Wales  J BELL Bookseller to His Royal Highness the PRINCE of WALES  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXVI PRICE SIXPENCE  PREFACE  IN this Age of  Theatric change  when TRAGEDIES have found themselves to be COMEDIES and COMEDIES have bordered upon PANTOMIME nothing has changed so little as  Pantomime  itself  Harlequin  skips away his Passion  Colombine  foots it to the same Tunethe chosen  Lover  slides across the Stage melancholy and gentlemanlikethe  Clown  breaks his Head pleasantly against the Scene and the  Father  tumbles over him in the same Way and fortunately with the same Merriment he has done any Time these Hundred Years  These Witticisms are certainly good ones for they are undoubtedly the oldest and of the longest standing of any in Christendom  But one Jest cannot unfortunately live for ever In the East Indies the same Joke lasts only a Twelvemonth and is terminated by the Arrival of the next Ships  For this Reason the Author of the Pantomime in which the following Songs bear a Part has attempted to stray from the beaten Road but it is requested the Audience will not be alarmed The  Hero of to Night is not about to be a Man of Sentiment tho'  Othello  might be such with a black Face he had not the good or the ill Fortune to have a Partycolour'd Jacket which cuts short all Sentiment at once  The Novelty attempted to be dramatised Tonight takes its Rise from the Writings of MISS AIKIN and the HON HORACE WALPOLE The  Castle of Otranto  and  the Fragment of Sir Bertrand  form the Basis of an Endeavour to bring upon the Stage somewhat of the Effects which may be produced by Midnight Horror and Agency supernatural What may be the Result of this Experiment Tonight must determine for hitherto the Experiment has not been made  The Ghost of  Hamlet  and the Witches of  Macbeth  do not militate against this Assertion Their Appearance tho' out of Nature was simple and not combined The Clank of Chains the Whistling of hollow Winds the Clapping of Doors Gigantic Forms and visionary Gleams of Light attended not their Effects upon the Stage The firm Mind certainly may laugh at all this but if ever on a late Winter Evening at a welltold Story of an Apparition the Company have found themselves unusually attentive and sometimes unwittingly look'd backif they have felt no Wish to partif imperceptibly they have sat more closely together and heard the Summons to Rest and Separationthe retiring to a lone Chamber with Reluctance not  to say Disquietudeif all this has happen'd then are we right in thinking there is somewhat of Enthusiasm or Superstition in these Matters which Reason smiles at but cannot prevail over  If this is a Weakness the greatest and the best of all Times have felt its Force  Henry the Fourth  the great  Duke of Marlborough  and a Family of Rank in this Country with whom the Author has had the Honor of being intimate were remarkable Instances of this Truth  Mix'd up with lighter Things to counteract the Gloom some Grains of this Species of Composition will form the Potion of the Pantomime in Question in other Matters the Author humbly hopes he shall not be more dull than his Neighbours have been before him perhaps quite as nonsensical and sometimes more absurdHe trusts however the Audience will not be displeased with him for having substituted a  talkative Attendant  upon  Harlequin  in the room of the usual  Dumb Grimace  of the  Clown  or having given them the youthful Accomplishments of Miss WILKINSON as a  Colombine  in the Place of a  Figurante  VOCAL CHARACTERS  NECROMANCER
