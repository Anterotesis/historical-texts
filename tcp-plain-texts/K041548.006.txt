 POEMS AND PLAYS  VOL VI  POEMS AND PLAYS By WILLIAM HAYLEY ESQ  IN SIX VOLUMES  VOL VI  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXV  MARCELLA A TRAGEDY OF THREE ACTS  PREFACE  THE following Tragedy may perhaps attract the notice of the curious reader more by a literary anecdote relating to its subject than by any intrinsic merit as a dramatic composition  The story was recommended to  YOUNG  by the Author of ClarissaThe poet adopted it and wrote a single act but this shared the fate of his other unfinished manuscripts and according to the direction of his will was committed to the flames  These particulars with a concise sketch of the story as related by  RICHARDSON  were communicated to Mr  THORNTON  by the poet's very liberal and amiable Son the neighbour and the muchesteemed relation of my dear departed friend who wished me to build a tragedy upon this foundation  Some particular circumstances prevented me at that time from executing the desire of a person who from the integrity of his judgment and the uncommon warmth  of his friendship had an undisputed title to influence my studiesOther works had engaged me and this dramatic story lay for some years neglected but in looking over the letters of my stillvalued though lost correspondent it struck me with new force As the distress with which it abounds is of a private nature it appeared to me singularly calculated for my purpose of forming a drama for a domestic theatre I have therefore with some considerable alterations in the principal incident raised from it a tragedy of three acts with what success it is now the privilege of my readers to pronounce  I will not attempt to influence their decision by any arguments in its behalf but let me be allowed to close this short preface with a little poetical acknowledgment to the two literary illustrious friends who first marked the story for the tragic Muse and from whom it has accidentally descended to me  SONNET  BLEST Authors with whose fame the world has rung  Immortal minds of philanthropic mold  Pathetic RICHARDSON sublimer YOUNG  To you let me inscribe the leaves that hold  A theme ye once consulted to unfold  Fairer its fortune had not death's despite  Torn from the silenc'd bard this tale halftold  O could I blend those beams whose sep'rate light  Forms each a glory round your rival brows  Sublimity and Pathos effluence bright  Of highest geniusbut in vain such vows  Yet in the reach of emulation's flight  One eminence ye sharebe that my end  Teach me to rank with you as Virtue's friend  Persons of the Drama  GOVERNOR OF BARCELONA  MENDOZA  LUPERCIO  HERNANDEZ  LOPEZ  MARCELLA  Servants  c  SCENE  the Governor's Castle in  BARCELONA  MARCELLA  ACT I  SCENE I  The Governor's Castle  Lupercio  and  Marcella  MARCELLA  LET ardent friendship be the bond between us  But O subdue this inauspicious love  And chase it from thy breast  LUPERCIO  Impossible  Think cruel monitor thro' what long years  My heart has cherish'd an encreasing passion  Till it is grown a portion of my being  Which I can ne'er relinquish but with life  MARCELLA  I know that from our days of infancy  Thy vows have had the sanction of my father  And from the period when he first became  The governor of this fair city he  Has lean'd towards thee with an anxious hope  To call thee by the tender name of fon  Nor can the world reprove his generous wishes  For Barcelona's walls contain no youth  Of nobler blood or higher estimation  LUPERCIO  Lovely encomiast sure the songs of seraphs  And all the wondrous harmonies of Heaven  Can never strike more sweetly on the soul  Than the frank praise of those angelic lips  MARCELLA  I should despise my own uncandid heart  If it refus'd that tribute of applause  Which selfish pride and jealous envy pay  To thy acknowledg'd meritYes Lupercio  I own thy rank and thy accomplish'd youth  Might justly challenge a return of fondness  From the most haughty of our flatter'd sex  Yet trust me and I speak the words of friendship  Twere wiser in thee even could my tongue  Pronounce the free compliance thou entreatest  To turn thy partial eyes from cold Marcella  And for thy wise solicit me no more  LUPERCIO  Mock not my senses with such admonition  As reason must revolt from Wouldst thou say  To the poor wretch who after many a step  O'er Afric's burning sands half dead with drought  Holds in his parch'd and eager hand at last  The liquid blessing that he long has pin'd for  Then wouldst thou say that wisdom bids him dash  The salutary treasure from his tongue  And perish by the thirst that wastes his being  Such and more cruel is thy counsel now  That would induce me to renounce thy charms  E'en in these moments when thy father's friendship  Had fill'd my soul with panting expectation  To hear thy heavenly voice declare me happy  MARCELLA  I know my father's hopes and by his worth  I swear my heart oft wishes for the power  Most fondly to fulfil them  LUPERCIO  Ha what bar  What secret bar from quickey'd Love conceal'd  Has envious fortune rais'd to thwart our union  You say that you regard me as your friend  Then honour me with friendship's dearest claim  Unbounded confidenceunfold your heart  If to cut off the promise of my bliss  If there is aught of unknown fondness there  Which fears a father's eye confide in me  And though against myself  MARCELLA  Ingenuous youth  Your mind is noble but you little know  Marcella's heart above all low disguise  Proud of its truth nor patient of controul  LUPERCIO  Pardon the fond surmise of fearful love  If thy soft breast is free from predilection  What other barand yet there may be other  Nature perhaps has curs'd me with defects  Offensive to thy sight some natural blemish  Of mind or feature which thy delicate sense  Tries to endure but cannot  MARCELLA  No by Heaven  Except the noble stranger whom we saw  At mass this morning and whose signal graces  Drew from us both observance of his person  My eyes ne'er gaz'd upon a comelier youth  And reason tells me that I ought to love thee  But my heart shrinks perversely from her voice  Oft have I try'd to bend my wayward spirit  To crown thy constant vows and bless my father  Yet ever as my soul pursues that thought  A secret tremor in my bosom bids me  Recoil from thy embraces whispering there  That I was only born to be thy bane  LUPERCIO  Thou thou my baneThou art my life's support  As dear and as essential to my being  As the blest radiance of the sun to nature  These are the airy fears of virgin softness  Most apt to harbour in the loveliest minds  Banish the visionary dread and give  Thy lighten'd heart to all the joys that court thee  Thy father's prayers the vows of all our friends  Will shed propitious lustre on our union  Hymen can never light his genial flame  With happier auspices but were they dark  And hideous as the sick man's feverish dreams  Wert thou instead of noble Garcia's heiress  The child of want and penury thy dower  I still should pant as fondly for thy hand  Still in thy wondrous charms and lovely virtues  Think all the blessings of the earth compriz'd  MARCELLA  I know thee generous to a fond extreme  It has subdu'd my waywardness of temper  And spite of the reluctance that I feel  To speak the important words I will be thine  LUPERCIO  Blest be that sound it is an angel's voice  Freeing the spirit of a tortur'd martyr  And opening to his view the heaven he sigh'd for  MARCELLA  And yet I fear  LUPERCIO  Wound not enraptur'd love  With vain distrust but name the blissful day  When my fond heart  MARCELLA  I said I will be thine  Do not with cruel importunity  Now press me farther As I frankly told thee  My soul I know not why is out of tune  Give me a little time to regulate  The strange emotion of my mind and try  To meet thee as I wish without these terrors  LUPERCIO  Thou dear directress of my fate thy will  Shall ever sway the conduct of my life  Howe'er it thwart meYet I pray thee name  Some period on which hope may dwell to sooth  The restless interval or kindly give me  Some pledge of thy dear promise  MARCELLA  Take this ring  Of curious workmanship near Tunis found  And given my father by a noble Moor  The wife of Asdrubal you know the figure  Plunging amidst the flames in which she perish'd  Wear this a month then claim me as your bride  But if you value me preserve the jewel  For if you lose this symbol of my faith  Your negligence may lead me to retract  A promise so reluctantly pronounc'd  LUPERCIO  Rest here thou radiant harbinger of bliss  Trust me my love and by thyself I swear  That sooner shall my soul and body part  Than this dear gem be wrested from the finger  Where now it shinesO let me kiss the hand  Which has enrich'd me with a pledge so precious  And let my lips thus ratify our compact  While he is kissing her hand  Enter the  Governor Hernandez  and a female Attendant  GOVERNOR  Why this is well I like this pleasing shew  Of mutual tendernessShe has relented  And will be your's Lupercio  LUPERCIO  Yes my father  I now may call you by that valued title  My blissful doom has pass'd those lovely lips  And she is now irrevocably mine  GOVERNOR  May every blessing my paternal prayers  Can ask of Heaven descend upon ye both  Thy free consent delights me and thou art  My age's comfort  MARCELLA  When I cease to be so  May life forsake me'twill have lost all value  GOVERNOR  My tender child I thank thee but thou lead'st me  Wide of my present aimWith thee Lupercio  I must on business of the state awhile  Hold private converse I'll release thee soon  To the soft object of thy tend'rer thoughts  Meantime my daughter as the hour of vespers  Now summons you pray for us and implore  Your Guardian Saint to make your nuptials happy  Your servants wait youGoon your return  You'll find us in the castle and at leisure  To dedicate the hours to love and joy  Now mark me thou brave youth  Retires to the farther part of the stage with  Lupercio  MARCELLA  Hernandez you may rest at homeyou know  'Tis not your duty to attend on me  As I have oft inform'd youIt is strange  My father suffers his old foolish steward  To pester me with such officious service  HERNANDEZ  Dear lady do not frownI have no joy  But to gaze on you wheresoe'er you go  And follow like your shadowWould my shape  Were half so gracefulthen I think your eyes  Could never view me with an angry glance  MARCELLA  Hence saucy vassalHowsoe'er my father  Use thy preposterous passion for his mirth  It shall not thus insult meHence I bid thee  For ever shun my presence    Drops her glove  HERNANDEZ  presenting the glove  But kind chance  Is more my friend and makes me still your servant  MARCELLA  Away fantastic insolence be gone  I will not feed thy vanity by wearing  Aught which thy touch has sullied Isabel  Take it and draw its fellow from my arm  Bring other gloves and follow me to vespers    Exeunt  Marcella  and her Attendant  HERNANDEZ  Insulting fair I yet may find a moment  To triumph o'er thy scorn  The  Governor  and  Lupercio  advance from the end of the stage  GOVERNOR  How now Hernandez  What has your mistress chid you from her presence  I am indeed to blame to treat so long  Your fooleries with levity and laughter  Henceforth in this my young and noble friend  You must respect a husband's dignity  And dare to wound my daughter's ear no more  With sounds of amorous dotage  LUPERCIO  Good Hernandez  You know the infirmity of Spanish husbands  And you're so studied in your lady's temper  I may regard you as a dangerous rival  HERNANDEZ  I stand corrected  Aside  Curse his happy stars  And curse his proud and thinlyveil'd contempt  Howe'er deformity may make my figure  The butt of his derision I've a spirit  In which this fairlimb'd youth may feel a rival  More dangerous than his vanity believes    Exit  GOVERNOR  That faithful servant is depriv'd of sense  By the absurdest passion that e'er triumph'd  O'er manly reason he was justly noted  For the best qualities that grace his station  Intelligence and duty till my daughter  Advanc'd to womanhood but from that period  E'en in proportion as her beauties ripen'd  His faculties have seem'd upon the wane  I have too lightly sported with his frenzy  Which call'd for harsher discipline  LUPERCIO  O no  I feel he is entitled to compassion  Marcella has those fascinating charms  Which may intoxicate the soberest mind  Till all its senses reelI cannot wonder  Age and deformity forget their nature  By living in her sight and only feel  That she has beauty which inflames to madness  GOVERNOR  She may indeed with pride the father speaks it  Be number'd with the loveliest of her sex  With joy brave youth but with an anxious joy  I give her to thy guard  LUPERCIO  Doubt not my love  GOVERNOR  Trust me I do not but anxiety  Is the high tax which fond affection pays  For all its pleasures and parental hearts  As thou may'st prove hereafter pay it double  Besides my daughter lovely as she is  Has qualities that claim the nicest care  LUPERCIO  She has a generous pride which to her soul  Gives awful beauty and proclaims it free  From all that poor and petty artifice  Which manly arrogance presumes to think  Inherent in her sex  GOVERNOR  You know Lupercio  She is the only child that ever nature  Enrich'd me with my tenderness disdaining  The rigid customs of her sex and country  Has rear'd her with a freedom little known  To Spanish fairones for I wish'd to make her  Not the cag'd vassal of parental power  But truth and nature's chaste and free disciple  Her early temper join'd with my affection  To fix me in this conduct for believe me  Her mind is like the element of fire  Treat it with gentle caution it will shine  The radiant minister of joy and comfort  But close confinement or a blind neglect  May rouse its perilous energies to spread  Unthoughtof scenes of misery and terror  LUPERCIO  Trust me I never will prophane her virtue  With abject jealousy and harsh constraint  GOVERNOR  On this nice topic in our hours of leisure  We'll speak more largely when your just affection  Will give kind audience to a father's counsel  Now other cares demand usYou forget  The business I've entrusted to your guidance  Which calls for quick dispatch  LUPERCIO  Forgive me Sir  May love that miser who locks up our thoughts  Nor lets them circulate as duty orders  Plead with me for your pardonI am gone    Exit  GOVERNOR  My blessing be thy guardLong have I wish'd  To give my daughter to this virtuous youth  But 'tis the doom of age in deeds of moment  To feel the fit of warm desire succeeded  By terror's aguish tremblings I begin  To fear I've press'd too far her generous mind  To what her heart recoils from for she weds  To indulge a father's wishes not her own  'Tis true the tenderest motives have impell'd me  To urge this union eager to entrust  Her peace and honour to a kind protector  But anxious love tho' probity may guide it  Oft with a fond precipitancy foils  Its own dear purpose and with dizzy rashness  Leaps in the dreaded gulph it strives to shun  My child return'd so soon and with a stranger  What may this mean  Enter  Marcella  and  Mendoza  MENDOZA  It moves I see thy wonder  Thou honour'd veteran that thus uncheck'd  By ceremony's just observances  A youth unknown intrudes upon thy presence  And dares to make this lovely maid his herald  GOVERNOR  Whoe'er thou art young Signor I must own  Thy graceful semblance prompts me to believe  Thou hast no common claim to courtesy  MENDOZA  'Tis possible thou art not unacquainted  With young Mendoza's name  GOVERNOR  Who knows it not  Spain has no martial son whose generous veins  Hold richer blood and fame reports Mendoza  A youth whose opening virtues have reflected  New honour on his noble ancestry  Our country with a fond impatient pride  Expects him from his travels but 'tis said  That grac'd with a discerning monarch's friendship  He purposes to pass another year  At the Imperial court  MENDOZA  Such as he is  Mendoza stands before thee and thou feest him  An anxious humble suitor to thy bounty  GOVERNOR  To me my Lord  MENDOZA  To thee thou happy father  To thee thou blest possessor of a treasure  That turns all other wealth to poverty  Oft had I heard thy lovely daughter prais'd  As beauty's standard and no more allowing  A competition with inferior fairones  Than the rich diamond's blaze admits compare  With the dark amethyst or clouded opal  It was my wish in passing thro' your city  Unknown to gaze upon this beauteous wonder  As on a prodigy of nature's work  Supreme in loveliness which to have seen  Gives to the eye that saw it a proud sparkle  Of exultation whensoe'er 'tis nam'd  GOVERNOR  This lavish praise my Lord at once o'erwhelms me  With joy and pain and both in the extreme  Pray do not spoil by thus o'errating them  The simple charms of an unpolish'd girl  MENDOZA  Your pardon'tis not in the power of language  To state their excellenceAt mass this morning  My eager eyes first feasted on their sight  I thought I ne'er had seen till that blest moment  For on my ravish'd sense her beauty burst  Dazzling and dear as newimparted light  To one whose visual organs from his childhood  Had pin'd in moping darknessfrom that hour  My heart cries loudly that the earth contains  No prize worth my contention but her love  Report inform'd me that her soft affections  Are yet unfix'd tho' an accomplish'd youth  Fondly presuming on a father's friendship  Hopes hourly for the promise of her hand  Fir'd by these tidings as again I saw her  Approach the hallow'd precincts of the temple  I threw me at her feet conjur'd her pity  To guide me to your presence and implor'd  The Guardian Saint whose votary I sued to  That when we next that sacred pavement trod  Heaven might exalt me to the blissful honour  To lead her to the altar  MARCELLA  Oft in vain  I pray'd the gallant stranger to forbear  His unavailing suit nor vex my father  With fruitless importunity  MENDOZA  To both  I bend for pardon that my violent love  Dar'd to o'errule the mortifying counsel  Of maidenly reserve and modest fear  If yet thy heart that throne of happiness  Be vacant I implore thy father's leave  To join the contest for a prize whose value  Might tempt the monarchs of the world in arms  To hazard each his empire  GOVERNOR  Noble youth  Thy generous warmth so wins on my esteem  I will entrust thy own ingenuous heart  To judge the cause where e'en thy love's a party  The hour's not past in which with her assent  I gave my daughter to a valiant friend  Who long has lov'd her tho' I frankly own  His birth and fortune make him not thy equal  Such is my story now assume my place  And aswwer for me Say shall I a soldier  An old plain soldier honesty my pride  Shall I revoke my promise at the lure  Of interest and ambition  MENDOZA  Thou hast found  The way to vanquish all Mendoza's ardour  Thy words benumb my soul but thou shalt see  My wounded heart has virtue to decide  Against itself Mendoza's voice shall never  Prompt to the lips of honourable age  The abject sounds of infamyShalt thou  Revoke thy promise no thou brave old man  Not tho' my life should end by its completion  Let the vain sons of Italy and France  Attempt by mental alchemy to turn  The lead of falshood into wisdom's gold  And sink their own poor bubbles in the trial  It is the glory of a true Castilian  To scorn such arts and hold his word once given  As sacred as the fiat of a God  GOVERNOR  There spoke the spirit of Castilian honour  Brave youth I yet will love thee as my son  Tho' fate forbid such unionLet us hence  It may amuse thy generous mind to shew thee  The precincts of our castle  MENDOZA  Well thou warnest  Thy giddy guest to fly a dangerous banquet  Where his warm soul drinks poisonMatchless fairone  I must perforce from thy enchanting presence  Tear my reluctant heart while yet I can  Before the firm resolve of honour melts  In that full blaze of frenzykindling beauty  I goStill ere I quit these walls for ever  I shall implore one parting interview  But for a few short moments but to utter  My ardent vows that Heaven may make thee happy  And to entreat that as the years roll on  And bring thee as I hope they will new blessings  Thou'lt deign at least on this revolving day  To think not harshly of my hapless passion  And give one sigh of pity to Mendoza    Exit with the  Governor  MARCELLA  He's gone ere my full heart allow'd me power  To frame one grateful accent to the man  For whom alone my unconstrained lips  Could utter vows of genuine tenderness  Enchanting youthDost thou implore my pity  Thou canst not need compassion love and joy  Will as thy guardian spirits hover round thee  I am the wretch whose lacerated mind  Cries out for pity which I do not merit  Fool that I was by a reluctant promise  To violate the heart's prerogative  This injur'd sovereign now awakes to vengeance  And I deserve these torturesO Lupercio  Thou wert before an object from whose touch  My conscious frame recoil'dWhat art thou now  Thy very name is discord in my ear  That agitates my wounded brain to frenzy  And shall I wed thee take thee to my bosom  An aspic sooner from whose dearer clasp  My miseries might hope for welcome death  Yet how escape thee and maintain at once  My father's honour and my own unshaken  O for some kind assistant whose invention  May o'er my darken'd thoughts diffuse one glimpse  Of cheering lightHere comes a minister  Who wants not will to serve me  Enter  Hernandez  HERNANDEZ  Haste dear lady  Your father asks a moment's parley with you  In private and before he walks abroad  To show our ramparts to a noble stranger  MARCELLA  Canst thou Hernandez banish from thy memory  All my past anger and exert thy powers  To gain my favor by one signal service  HERNANDEZ  Ask me if I exist for while I live  I hold my life devoted to your pleasure  MARCELLA  I'll put thee to the trial for the task  Allows not e'en a moment of delay  Know then I foolishly have given Lupercio  My ring the pledge of an unguarded promise  Which my wrong'd heart forbids me to fulfil  I warn'd him if he chanc'd to lose the jewel  Our compact should be voidIf thou'lt devise  Some lucky artifice to lure it from him  Thou shalt have thrice the value of the gem  HERNANDEZ  Wouldst thou elude thy nuptials with Lupercio  The blest intelligence revives my soul  MARCELLA  He is the hated bar on whose removal  My heart might enter paradise and follow  The dear suggestions of unfetter'd love  HERNANDEZ  Enough thou shalt be mistress of thyself  MARCELLA  Make me but thatMy father callsbut that  And I'll reward thee till thyself shalt own  My gratitude a prodigal in bounty  Lose not a momentset me free tonight  And thro' my every hour of future life  I'll bless thee for the service    Exit  HERNANDEZ  Then tonight  Shall rid thee of LupercioThou shalt feel  Sarcastic boy I am a dangerous rival  I know in what lone quarter of the ramparts  Nightly thou walk'st in amorous contemplation  Murmuring fantastic crotchets to the moon  There if I miss thee still the blended fires  Of love and of revenge shall aid my search  And guide my thirsty poniard to thy heart  End of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  MARCELLA  alone  THE night is past but the allcheering morn  Fails to dispel the darkness of my soul  My restless heart yet beats with blended throbs  Of anguish and delight at the idea  That these fond eyes may with my father's leave  Gaze once again upon the dear Mendoza  O might they in our parting close for ever  'Tis strange I yet hear nothing of Hernandez  But what can heI was indeed an idiot  To think his paltry aid could terminate  My miseries I might as well believe  That the poor current of a scanty brook  Might quench the conflagration of the globe  O would those final flames that will consume  This gloomy world this stage of wretchedness  Were kindling now for my deliver'd soul  Escaping from worse horrors could rejoice  In that dread scene of fiery desolation  And think it bliss to perish with Mendoza  MENDOZA  entering  "And think it bliss to perish with Mendoza"  Extatic sounds may I believe my sense  Have I such tender interest in that bosom  MARCELLA  'Tis not well done my lord thus at the dawn  To steal upon my privacy and rob  A wounded spirit of its sole support  The secrecy of woes beyond a cure  MENDOZA  Pardon the impatient speed of anxious passion  I have nor rest nor joy but in thy presence  And hasten'd to thee in the sad belief  A burthen which my heart would now throw off  That this dear interview must prove the last  MARCELLA  The last indeed it must be  MENDOZA  If thy voice  Can speak with such sweet kindness of Mendoza  Thou wilt revoke that sentence and what power  Shall burst the hallow'd ties of mutual love  And tear our wedded spirits from each other  MARCELLA  The ruler of thy life imperious Honour  Honour who has already by thy voice  Pronounc'd the firm immutable decree  That this illfated hand must not be thine  MENDOZA  Urge not against me the confus'd decision  Of ignorance and blind mistaken pride  When I confirm'd thy father in his purpose  I knew not that to keep his fatal word  He must become a tyrant to thy heart  And violate the dearest rights of nature  I knew not that Mendoza's adrent love  Had in thy bosom rais'd the blest emotion  Of tender sympathy  MARCELLA  O that my heart  Had not unwarily betray'd its weakness  Then might a just ingenuous pride have taught me  To bear the painful secret to my grave  MENDOZA  Unkindly saidIf such could be thy wish  Thou hast not lov'd Mendoza  MARCELLA  Think so ever  I have not lov'd him duty faith forbid it  I am affianc'd to a generous youth  Who claims the full dominion of my heart  Nor shall Mendoza's image lurk within it  To prove the assassin of my peace and honour  MENDOZA  O lovely haughtiness of mind this conflict  This agitation of thy artless bosom  Proves the enchanting truth I am belov'd  I read it in those sweetlyspeaking eyes  Where the faint spark of anger is extinguish'd  In melting tenderness While thus I clasp thee  Kind sympathy gives to thy every nerve  Delicious softness and thy swelling heart  Vibrates in unison with mine to form  Th' extatic harmony of mutual love  Thou weep'stO Heaven I feel these precious drops  Fall on my wounded breast like liquid fire  O I had rather draw upon my head  The worst of human ills thy hate and scorn  Rather than touch thee with an illstarr'd passion  If it must prove a source of sorrow to thee  And quench the radiance of thine eyes in tears  MARCELLA  I can believe thee for thy noble soul  Is honour's sanctuaryThen as my friend  Let me implore the firmness of thy spirit  To aid the treacherous failing of my own  I am indeed unpractis'd in the arts  My sex is fam'd for I have not the skill  To hide th' emotions of a feeling heart  And I will lay it open to thy view  I will avow that if my wayward fortune  Had not forbid the union of our hands  I would have met the ardour of thy vows  With all the frankness of simplicity  Proud of its pleasing lot I would have pray'd  For undecaying charms to keep thy love  Blessing the God who form'd us for each other  But since the bar  MENDOZA  There is there shall be none  We'll urge thy heart's unalienable right  To be the fole disposer of thy beauty  MARCELLA  O speak not thusmy own unbalanc'd mind  Whirl'd in the eddies of tempestuous thought  Already has been hurried much too far  From the safe course integrity prescribes  But the remembrance of thy bright example  Shall be my glorious guide and still preserve me  How nobly hast thou said thou wouldst not urge  My honour'd father to revoke his promise  Not if thy life should end by its completion  Shalt thou a stranger thus against thyself  Stand forth the firm asserter of his honour  And shall his child betray it  MENDOZA  Do not wound  Thy own pure spirit by this groundless scruple  MARCELLA  It is conviction founded on the laws  Th' unquestionable laws of faith and virtue  I must for ever fly thee or disgrace  My father and myself And shall I heap  Grief disappointment misery and shame  Upon my father's head And what a father  Rough as he is in the rude scene of arms  The sternest soldier of his time to me  The awful thunder of his voice has soften'd  E'en to the tender sweetness of a lute  With me he has for ever thrown aside  All the asperities of harsh command  And disciplin'd my wayward infancy  With all the mildness of a mother's love  MENDOZA  O might I aid thee in thy dearest office  To pay him back those long and large arrears  Of tenderness and careYes we will make it  The incessant study of our days to lighten  Whatever load encroaching age lays on him  And by the sweet solicitude extend  The limit of his blest and honour'd life  MARCELLA  Could it be such our lot indeed were happy  But 'tis impossible Should I forgetting  The fanctity of promises should I  Attempt to burst the fetters that involve me  And struggle to be your's it could not be  Kind as he is my father's firmer spirit  In points of honour is inflexible  Could I myself descendand wounded pride  Revolts at the ideacould I stoop  To beg that he would countenance my falshood  I know his answer"Wouldst thou" he would cry  "Make me an object of the world's contempt  Shall I be censur'd as a sordid wretch  Who having given my daughter to a friend  Cheated his hopes and sold her venal beauty  To the rich splendor of Mendoza's fortune"  MENDOZA  Perish the envious spirits who could harbour  So base a thought of him who gave thee being  But should he be reproach'd as purest virtue  And the beneficence of Heaven itself  'Scapes not such prophanation it were better  Than to behold thy peace of mind destroy'd  And thy soft heart corroded by the shackles  The galling shackles of a joyless marriage  Think what it is to press the nuptial couch  When for the roses Love should scatter there  The fiend Antipathy has form'd its pillow  Of sharpest thorns that lacerate the brain  MARCELLA  I know it must be agony far worse  Than death's severest pang the thought already  Has thrown my troubled mind from off its balance  And plung'd me in distractionThou art cruel  To set my woes thus forcibly before me  And aggravate the anguish of my fate  MENDOZA  Think rather that with fond anxiety  I warn you of the precipice you tread  And pant to save you trembling on its brink  MARCELLA  I pray you leave me for your dangerous aid  Can but encrease the horrors of my fall  O leave me I conjure you  MENDOZA  Once assure me  You will endeavour to draw back your hand  From this abhorr'd alliance I will rest  On the faint hope which may arise from thence  MARCELLA  Whatever I can do and not destroy  My father's peace and honour shall be done  For O 'tis certain rather than be dragg'd  The victim of Lupercio's nuptial triumph  My heart would chuse to languish life away  In the lone walls of some sequester'd cell  Where not one pleasing sound could sooth my suffering  Save when I clos'd some melancholy prayer  With the dear echo of Mendoza's name  MENDOZA  Enchanting softness thou shalt yet be mine  And these heartrending sighs shall turn to rapture  MARCELLA  I hear my father's step depart I pray thee  MENDOZA  By Heaven my feet seem rooted to this spot  And have not power to bear me from thy presence  Enter the  Governor  GOVERNOR  Ah my young friend youth wants a monitor  To bid it mark the rapid flight of time  Is this your momentary interview  Come force me not to play the testy father  And chide you from my roof  MENDOZA  O pardon me  I will but seal one vow of tender friendship  On this fair hand and instantly attend you  FarewellThou art the loveliest work of Heaven  And may its purest spirits be thy guard    Exit with the  Governor  MARCELLA  Torn from me banish'd from my view for ever  O shall these wretched eyes behold no more  The darling of their sight and as each morn  Of hated life returns shall they be forc'd  To gaze upon the object that they loath  Sure all the subtlest of the infernal fiends  Are leagu'd to curse me with their keenest tortures  Ah senseless wretch my folly is the fiend  From whom this misery springs 'twas I 'twas I  Slave that I was who fasten'd on myself  This iron bondage that corrodes my soul  HERNANDEZ  entering  Lament its weight no more thy chain is broken  Receive the symbol of thy liberty    Delivering the ring  MARCELLA  It is my ring my gladden'd eyes acknowledge  Its bright assurance of recover'd freedom  Fly stop MendozaStay yet tell me first  How thou hast prosper'd thou excelling servant  Thou shalt have great rewards great as my joy  How did the fond Lupercio yield my pledge  Haste tell me allI must prepare myself  To meet him soon complaining of his loss  HERNANDEZ  Be satisfiedHe can no more complain  MARCELLA  What dost thou mean by that mysterious accent  HERNANDEZ  His hated voice shall ne'er be heard again  MARCELLA  Thou hast not murder'd himBy Heaven thou hast  I read it in thy dark and troubled visage  HERNANDEZ  I have indeed been bloody for thy sake  MARCELLA  Is he then butcher'd by thy savage hand  Unhappy youth thy pale and gory spectre  Will glare for ever in my sight and banish  All hopes of quiet from my soul for ever  Wretch thou hast sunk me in the deepest gulph  Of horror and perdition  HERNANDEZ  Come be chear'd  I have deliver'd thee from him whose being  Was torture to thy heartLupercio's dead  And by my caution it must be suppos'd  The nightly robbers who infest our city  Have thus reveng'd his vigilance against them  MARCELLA  Is this the recompence of all thy merit  Brave gen'rous frank LupercioTho' my heart  Recoil'd perversely from thy love it feels  With cold convulsive pangs of vain regret  It feels thy worth thy illrequited virtues  And all the horrors of thy barb'rous fate  HERNANDEZ  Reflect thou only from what hated scenes  Of hopeless pain my daring hand has sav'd thee  Think what thou ow'st to me who for thy sake  Have put in hazard my immortal soul  MARCELLA  Illfated wretch thou also hast my pity  'Twas my base conduct blinded as I was  That plung'd thee in this guiltBut haste be gone  Fly while thou canst where justice may not find thee  Fly to some distant climate and endeavour  By penitence to make thy peace with Heaven  Go where thou wilt my bounty shall attend thee  And aid thee with such lavish sums of gold  As may enable thee by those good deeds  Which charity delights in best to cancel  Or counterpoise the evil of thy crime  HERNANDEZ  What canst thou vainly think that in thy service  I've dy'd my unstain'd hand in guiltless blood  For gold the needy robber's paltry prey  MARCELLA  What was thy aimthy frantic eyes affright me  HERNANDEZ  Here is the nobler recompence I claim  Thy beauty rich in medicinal balm  To heal th' envenom'd anguish of remorse  Come to my breast and with thy melting charms  Drown all the keenest pangs that guilt can waken  In extacy more poignant  MARCELLA  Slave unhand me  Awayremember rash presumptuous villain  The distance of thy station  HERNANDEZ  Idle pride  Silence its frivolous and false suggestion  The hours just past have plac'd us on a level  Thou hast no title now but Murderess  We are confederates in guilt and blood  Blood is the cement of our equal union  MARCELLA  Thou dar'st not say it  HERNANDEZ  Dive into thy bosom  Ask thy own heartDidst thou not wish his death  Aye had thy flaming eyes like basilisks  Been arm'd with sudden power to strike him dead  Their stroke had far outstripp'd my tardy dagger  Thou couldst not think thy lover would resign  The gem thou bad'st me pilfer but with life  MARCELLA  No witness Heaven I thought not of his death  Yet thou hast rent a veil of fatal passion  That hid my own soul from me and I see  The stains of misery and guilt are on it  I am indeed the source the wretched source  Of all this scene of horror 'tis to me  To me thou illstarr'd minister of mischief  Thou ow'st the burden of this bloody deed  Which cries to angry Heaven for retribution  Now I conjure thee raise again thy arm  Plunge thy yetreeking poniard in my heart  And by this justice expiate our crimes  HERNANDEZ  Away with vain remorseCome let me steep  Thy troubled senses in those soft delights  That sweetly steal from the enchanted soul  All memory of pain  MARCELLA  Delight from thee  HERNANDEZ  I find contemptuous fairone I am not  Thy fav'rite No thy nice fastidious eye  Delights in daintier forms My jealous passion  Has caught thy bosom's secretYet be grateful  Be wise and I will make thee soon the bride  Of thy belov'd Mendoza  MARCELLA  Canst thou mean it  HERNANDEZ  Yes with this fineform'd heir of wealth and grandeur  Soon shalt thou shine in all that blaze of fortune  Which suits thy towering spirit if thy beauties  Will pay their debt of gratitude to me  And with those sweet delights that stealth makes sweeter  Reward the secret author of thy greatness  MARCELLA  What be the wife of Honour's noblest son  And live the servile strumpet of my vassal  Presumptuous villainyUnhand me ruffian  HERNANDEZ  Nay struggle notI have thee in my toils  And my keen love shall feast upon its victim  O'ertaken with such hazardCome be gentler  MARCELLA  Never O never  HERNANDEZ  Must I owe to force  The joy thy pitying gratitude should give  The joy for which my ardent soul has thirsted  E'en to its own perdition  MARCELLA  Hence away  Release my hand or my distracted cries  Shall bring my injur'd father to my aid  HERNANDEZ  And dar'st thou threaten me ungrateful girl  But it shall not avail theeHear and tremble  At the superior threat thou mak'st me utter  Thou see'st by all the bloody business past  I hold my life as nothing if thou still  Deny'st me what I have so dearly purchas'd  I will before our magistrates I will  Avow the murder charge upon thy head  The black design and add I have receiv'd  Thy virgin treasure as my settled hire  But that remorse has drawn the secret from me  Now learn to threaten girlNow take thy choice  Shame public shame with tortures and with death  Or the safe sweets of privacy and joy  MARCELLA  Amazement thy ferocity in guilt  O'erwhelms my facultiesYet hear me Heaven  To thee altho' offended by my falshood  To thee I kneel O punish my offences  By any pangs thy justice may ordain  But save O save me from this daring wretch  HERNANDEZ  Thy prayer's too late since thou hast render'd me  The wretch I am thy passions made me guilty  And thou shalt yield me that reward of guilt  For which I burn in every vein to madness  Come my reluctant fairone  MARCELLA  No by Heaven  Fulfil thy horrid thy inhuman threats  Add perjury to murder and devote me  To infamy and deathI will embrace them  Rather than yield to thy abhorr'd suggestion  And in that fellowship debase my soul  HERNANDEZ  Is there such firmness in the heart of woman  Then artifice assist me  Aside  Matchless virtue  E'en in this frenzy of my tortur'd spirit  I feel thy awful powerThy purity  Irradiates the dark chaos of my mind  And all the warring fires of lawless passion  Turn at thy voice to penitential tears  I kneel to thee for pardon  MARCELLA  Bend to Heaven  'Tis Heaven who strikes thee to reclaim thy soul  With just compunction  HERNANDEZ  Thou benignant angel  On thee depends my safety or perdition  Treat me with soothing pity and forgiveness  And I may yet atone for all my crimes  The fatal offspring of distracted passion  MARCELLA  Thou hast my pity  HERNANDEZ  I will ask no more  I will not wound thy dignity by wishing  What madness only led my heart to sigh for  No fair Perfection live thou many years  In the chaste bliss of honourable love  While I the victim of a frantic fondness  In some wild desert hide my loath'd existence  Mourn my past guilt and hope the pitying vows  Of innocence like thine may draw from Heaven  A full tho' late forgiveness of my crimes  MARCELLA  Unhappy servant in my prayers for mercy  Thou ne'er shalt be forgotten  HERNANDEZ  'Tis my purpose  To fly from hence before tomorrow's dawn  But wherefore I nor wish nor merit life  Haste to thy injur'd father let him know  The wretch he harbours and for all my guilt  Let public justice make her full atonement  MARCELLA  Poor frantic criminal yet hope in Heaven  I who have blindly led thee into crimes  Will not accelerate thy punishment  Seek some religious cell and meditate  On the infinitude of heavenly mercy  HERNANDEZ  I see I feel it in thy soothing pity  MARCELLA  Here meet me once again some two hours hence  I will supply thee with such gold or jewels  As may give comfort to thy lengthen'd days  HERNANDEZ  Thou art too good too tender to a villain  Who has deserv'd thy hatred and thy scorn  Still let me strive to shew I have a heart  That knows to value what it cannot merit  I will not meet thee We'll converse no more  Lest when my flight is known some dark suspicion  Fall on thy innocenceAt evening's close  Leave thou the gift thy charity intends  In the lone tower that flanks the garden wall  At midnight I will take thy bounty thence  And praying for thy peace depart for ever  MARCELLA  I thank thy generous caution nor will fail  To bring thee liberal aid for still I trust  'Tis Heaven's intent for all thy earlier virtues  By years of calm sequester'd penitence  To purify thy soul and seal thy pardon  Cherish that thought and Mercy be thy guard    Exit  HERNANDEZ  alone  'Tis wellProud Beauty I am now thy master  Thy

End of ACT II  ACT III  SCENE I  HERNANDEZ  alone  VICTORIOUS passion thou at length hast gain'd  The prize that long has kindled in my soul  Such wild tumultuous hopes and madding wishes  Thy secret joys are safeSpite of the frenzy  Rais'd by her wounded pride and vain resistance  This coy one stifling her vindictive rage  Most wisely hides the mysteries of the night  And from her silence in this hasty marriage  My triumph is complete she now will grow  The willing vassal of my private pleasure  But hark I hear the doating bridegroom's voice  He moves this wayI would not he should cast  His keen eyes on me till my harrass'd spirit  Regain its wonted firmnessI'll avoid him    Exit  Enter the  Governor  and  Mendoza  GOVERNOR  Indeed my son I've yielded much too far  To the fond zeal of your intemperate love  How will the world upbraid me for allowing  Your hurried nuptials in this illstarr'd hour  Of doubtful horrors your unhappy bride  Or drown'd in tears or almost craz'd with terror  And the brave youth her late affianc'd lord  My poor illfated friend welt'ring in blood  From the base wounds of undetected murder  MENDOZA  My honour'd father thou hast only done  What tenderness and duty both enjoin'd  Her generous wish to be my wedded love  Her virtuous dread that honour might forbid it  And the dire fate of that lamented youth  Whom she both loath'd and pitied all combin'd  Had cruelly depriv'd her troubled senses  Of reason's sovereign guidance still on me  The lovely maniac rav'd implor'd my aid  To save her from Lupercio's nuptial claim  And chase the gory phantom from her sight  Which frenzy rais'd before itwhat remain'd  But for Mendoza urg'd by love and pity  To take the dear distrest one to his bosom  Bear her from hence and in more tranquil scenes  Heal her distemper'd mind and fondly cherish  The gentle sufferer into peace and joy  GOVERNOR  Heaven bless the generous fervor of thy fondness  Thou nobleminded youthI had not power  To thwart thy wish tho' my paternal heart  Trembling in its completion still endures  Painful vicissitudes of hope and fear  MENDOZA  Doubt not my father lenient time and love  That mutual love which consecrates our union  Will from the harrass'd spirit of thy daughter  Remove this load of complicated anguish  And make us soon the happiest pair that ever  Reach'd the pure summit of connubial bliss  GOVERNOR  I know she loves thee to a fond excess  Her soul was form'd for love and thou art blest  Most richly blest with all that can enchant  The eye or heart of womanon this ground  I build my strongest hope Yet O my son  Weak as she is her senses scarce restor'd  How can I yield this darling from my sight  E'en to a guard so tender  MENDOZA  Speak your pleasure  If 'tis your wish we will remain your guests  But change of place will soothe the harrass'd mind  Of our sweet sufferer She should quit this scene  While in avenging the brave murder'd youth  You nobly pay your great and awful debt  To private friendship and to public justice  GOVERNOR  I have no doubts on that atrocious deed  My poor lost friend's incautious ardent spirit  Had fatally provok'd some desperate villains  Who lurk within our city the base wretches  Have thus reveng'd a menace which Lupercio  Pronounc'd against their chiefbut by my orders  We soon shall see the bloody slaves secur'd  A care still heavier presses on my heart  My poor perturbed childMy anxious love  Wavers in painful doubt nor can resolve  To speed her hence or to detain her here  MENDOZA  Submit it to her choiceSoon as the priest  Ended our hasty and affecting marriage  You know she begg'd permission to retire  To gain by solitude reviving strength  And still those throbs of lovely agitation  Which in the solemn rite subdu'd her softness  Go to her chamber your paternal care  May best explore her wishes let them be  Our guides in every stepFor me I hold  My fortune and my life but ministers  Bound to fulfil our dearest mutual hope  And make the bliss of your angelic daughter  As perfect as her beauty  GOVERNOR  Noble youth  A father's tears must thank theeI will follow  Thy generous counsel and return to bless thee    Exit  MENDOZA  How mighty is thy power Parental Love  The hardy sinews of this gallant veteran  Proof 'gainst the weight of war's severest toils  Yield to thy pressureThat undaunted firmness  Which peril could not shake is turn'd by thee  To wavering fear and fond irresolution  Enter  Lopez  LOPEZ  My honour'd lord forgive me if my zeal  Urge me to trouble you with painful truths  MENDOZA  What wouldst thou LopezHence with idle preface  And speak thy meaning boldly  LOPEZ  'Tis my duty  That forces from my lips at such a season  What I must grieve to speak and you to hear  MENDOZA  Well thou hast credit for thy good intention  Spare thy apologies and tell thy tale  LOPEZ  'Tis thus my lordbut promise me your pardon  MENDOZA  I'll pardon any thing but thy suspense  LOPEZ  Know then the steward of this house Hernandez  Has been observ'd to throw his daring arms  With such licentious freedom round your bride  As honour cannot brook  MENDOZA  Good simple fellow  Is this thy wondrous tale thy painful truth  What art thou yet to learn that ancient servants  Are amply privileg'd on days like this  The man who bore the infant in his arms  May kiss the ripen'd bride without a crime  And the quick eye of jealousy itself  Shall wink at his presumptionGet thee gone  LOPEZ  He boasts he will attend you to Madrid  Says he is fix'd for life my lady's usher  Defying e'en her husband to displace him  MENDOZA  I will not quarrel with his honest pride  Inebriate with joyyet as the world  Is prone to censure 'twill perhaps be prudent  To strike this boasting vassal from our train  But

fond eyes of a protected child  The tears of filial gratitude think not  Thy daughter thankless for thy guardian care  From her impatient haste to quit thy mansion  GOVERNOR  No my sweet child I know thy heart too well  To doubt its tenderness Trust me thy father  Much as he joys to have thee in his sight  Feels in these moments all the forceful reasons  That urge thy quick departure  MARCELLA  Then farewell  To this paternal roof Ye walls that echoed  With the gay music of my infant songs  Farewell If aught of evil hover o'er ye  May it depart with me depart for ever  Safety and honour pure celestial guards  Watch o'er this dome and bless its dear possessor  Hear this my parting prayer indulgent Heaven  Whate'er thy pleasure may ordain for me  Here or hereafter grant O grant me this  To die before my father can have cause  To wish he were not author of my being  GOVERNOR  Live but till then and thou must be immortal  Rise my kind daughterThou wilt ever prove  My age's darling dearer to thy father  Than life or glory Heaven I trust for thee  Has years in store of still encreasing joy  MARCELLA  Alas my father dost thou not perceive  The poor Lupercio whispering from his shroud  How short and how precarious mortal being  If soon thou chance to hear thy child is dead  And his shade tells me thou wilt hear it soon  I pray thee let not an intemperate grief  Bend to the earth thy venerable age  Yet O forget me not with tender sorrow  Give thy pure prayers to my departed soul  GOVERNOR  Rise rise my childLet not these gloomy fancies  O'ercloud thy chearful spirit raise thine eyes  To all the radiant paths of varied pleasure  That open now before theeSee thy lord  The bright conductor of thy future steps  Comes like the sun newrisen to disperse  These noxious vapours from thy darken'd mind  And give thy charms new lustre  Enter  Mendoza  GOVERNOR  Dear Mendoza  We will from hence today I will myself  Play the young soldier and escort your bride  Across this province

arms thou sweet seraphic being  Come and preside o'er all my future life  As a benignant angel by whose guidance  I wish to regulate my every thought  Bless that kind tear it is the sweet reply  Of tenderness too delicate for language  Yet speak Marcellamy delighted ear  Doats on the music of thy soothing voice  MARCELLA  O had I but the power to make thee happy  Were it but possible thy life should prove  Unclouded as thy virtues and thy love  MENDOZA  In thee I've every blessing man can wish  My conscious pride exulting in thy love  Boldly defies the wantonness of fancy  To figure joys above th' unchequer'd bliss  Which my full heart has found in thy perfection  Be thou as happy as thou mak'st Mendoza  And we shall live the envy of the world  Why gush these tears Why heaves thy lab'ring bosom  Why roves thy troubled eye around the chamber  Seeming to parley with the senseless walls  My tender fairone I perceive thy thoughts  This is the fond adieu which thy soft spirit  Expresses to this dear paternal mansion  Be chear'd thou soon shalt visit it again  When its glad gates shall leap at thy approach  And ev'ry echoing stone repeat thy welcome  Still pensiveCome sweet

drive him to reveal  MENDOZA  A secret  Hast thou a secret thou canst wish to hide  From the fond eye of allforgiving love  MARCELLA  I havefor thee thou darling of my soul  And for my father's peace I strongly wish'd  To bear it with me to an early grave  And hide its painful horrors in the shade  Of hasten'd deathbut like the inbred fire  That burns its passage thro' the groaning earth  Struggling it bursts from my convulsive bosom  And all the blazing ruin rushes on thee  MENDOZA  AmazementThou hast petrified my heart  Yet speak whatever wretchedness awaits me  I wish to hear it from no lips but thine  MARCELLA  Thou generous object of my fatal love  Wretch as I am how shall I bear the pangs  The keener pangs I'm destin'd to inflict  On the pure heart I wish'd to make most happy  Illstarr'd Mendoza dear deluded youth  Thou fondly think'st thou'st taken to thy bosom  A spotless form of purity and truth  But oh 'tis stain'd by complicated crimes  Too horrible for utterance  MENDOZA  Can it be  Who but thyself should call thee base and live  Thou canst not be so yet I pray thee speak  The dreadful purport lab'ring on thy lips  MARCELLA  By Heaven I cannot

his murder  MARCELLA  Hernandez  MENDOZA  Ha was he the black assassin  MARCELLA  I did not place the poniard in his hand  I did not ask for blood but my base falsehood  Falsehood the offspring of my love to thee  Led to that bloody deed  MENDOZA  My bride a murd'ress  MARCELLA  Look not upon me thus I cannot bear  The fierce abhorrence of those angry eyes  Plunge thy sword here and give me gentler death  MENDOZA  Thou canst not be so guilty Thou hast injur'd  Thy own soft heartUnfold the fatal story  MARCELLA  Thou'rt yet to hear accumulated horrors  To make me still more loathsome to thy sight  But I can never speak themKill me kill me  In mercy end my miseries before  The lightning of my father's indignation  Strikes his detested daughter into dust  MENDOZA  Would I could save him from the pangs I feel  But 'tis impossible if thou art guilty  MARCELLA  It is it isthen save me from his wrath  Save my departing spirit from his curse  And death may then afone for my offences

Heaven  Why was she fram'd with such pernicious beauty  I dare not trust myself to gaze upon thee  In this wild tumult of my madd'ning soul  Rest in this chamber and restrain thy tears  While I regain some little use of reason  To hear more calmly all thy wretched tale    He leads  Marcella  weeping to the adjoining chamber and closes the door upon her  MENDOZA  What's to be done my dizzy soul thus falling  From joy's bright summit to these depths of horror  Loses the faculty of thoughtHere Lopez  Go bring Hernandez instantly before me  Enter the  Governor  My father are you come I wish'd your presence  Yet I would freely part with life to save you  From the dread scene we must sustain together  GOVERNOR  What means Mendozawhence thy alter'd visage  What new afflictionwhere's my hapless child  MENDOZA  Thou brave thou good affectionate old man  It wounds my soul to tell thee that thy roof  Harbours the murderer thy justice seeks  Behold he comes to answer for his crime  Lopez  and other Servants bring in  Hernandez  GOVERNOR  HernandezArt thou certain of his guilt  Or whence is thy surmise  MENDOZA  Hear and decide  Thou faithless servant who hast stain'd a life  Of long integrity by one black deed  I charge thee with the blood of that brave youth  Thy master call'd his friendSay art thou able  To plead thy innocenceThou need'st not speak  Thy guilty features answer thy accuser  HERNANDEZ  aside  The trait'ress has betray'd me then revenge  Thou art the only sweet that I can taste  And I will banquet on thee  GOVERNOR  If thou art  So base a monster of ingratitude  Prepare thyself for tortures  HERNANDEZ  Spare thy threats  Thou know'st not yet the partner of my guilt  Thou wouldst not chuse to see thy daughter's beauty  Expos'd a mangled victim in those streets  Where never eye survey'd her passing form  But with delight or envy  GOVERNOR  Sland'rous ruffian  Dar'st thou prophane the virtue of my child  But her pure soul could no more league with thine  Than Heaven's mostfavor'd angel could descend  To aid the hellish plots of that arch fiend  Who prompted thee to perpetrate this murder  MENDOZA  aside to  Hernandez  Peace villain and if e'er thou hop'st for mercy  Respect the feelings of a wounded father  HERNANDEZ  Talk not to me of mercyI despise it  Death is I know my portion but its pangs  Are turn'd to transport by my rich revenge  Too long the jests of mockery were lavish'd  On my mishapen form and ardent love  One gibing youth has paid me with his life  For insolent derision and o'er thee  Thou haughty husband thou fair golden image  Whom beauty worships unconstrain'd o'er thee  My triumph rises to a prouder height  Of bold revengeI have enjoy'd thy bride  MENDOZA  Thou bloodstain'd lyar henceAway with him  To strict confinement in your deepest dungeon  HERNANDEZ  Bite thy proud frantic lip in savage hope  To see my crooked body on the wheel  Crush'd and expos'd a public spectacle  My vengeance is consummate but for thine  'Tis the vain menace of presumptuous pride  Which courage laughs atI escape it thus    Stabs himself  MENDOZA  Thou hast indeed eluded the slow hand  Of human justice but thou canst not foil  The surer vengeance of highjudging Heaven  GOVERNOR  Go bring thy wife she must appear this instant  The form of injur'd innocence must draw  From the pale lips of this expiring villain  Th' avowal of his falsehood  HERNANDEZ  My dim eyes  Are closing and in this deceitful world  Shall look no more upon her fatal beauty  But in the nextO mercy    Dies  GOVERNOR  Where is my daughter  MARCELLA  entering  Here's the hapless being  Who once was proud of that endearing name  Tho' fallen less guilty than the world might judge me  From the base insult of this bleeding wretch  Whose crimes are clos'd by death yet O my father  Too vile to claim thy kindness or to live  GOVERNOR  Wrong not thyself thou art all innocence  MARCELLA  Thou dear deluded parent'twas my wish  To die and not deprive thee of a thought  In which thy virtuous spirit would have found  Sweet consolation for thy lost delight  I wish'd a little longer to support  This wretched being that I might not stain  By my accelerated fate this mansion  The dear asylum of thy honour'd age  But my gall'd spirit never form'd to bear  The heavy load of unacknowledg'd guilt  Sunk in its painful efforts to sustain it  Hence the quick end of that abhorr'd assassin  And hence thy child atoning now by death  For her conceal'd offences thus implores thee  To pardon and to bless her parting spirit  GOVERNOR  O thou dear sufferer whate'er thy failings  Attempt not aught against thy precious life  MENDOZA  Live I conjure thee and the tears of love  Shall wash th' ideal blemish from thy heart  MARCELLA  My generous husband let me speak that name  Still precious to me tho' so rashly purchas'd  Think not thy injur'd bride design'd to give  To thy chaste bed a vile dishonour'd partner  Tho' forcibly dishonour'd  GOVERNOR  Ha my child  Hast thou endur'd from that atrocious ruffian  MARCELLA  O good my father ask not my faint voice  Which soon will sink in everlasting silence  T' unfold a tale whose utterance would call  Shame's burning blush to the pale cheek of death  A friendly poison has already numb'd  My vital faculties but I have left  A written legacy of fatal fondness  In which unless my blotting tears have marr'd it  You'll read what I have done and what endur'd  Nay weep not both of you may love me dead  Living you could not  MENDOZA  Could affection rescue  Thy beauty from the grave thou should'st not die  MARCELLA  I know ye generous spirits death will cancel  In your kind mem'ries all my fatal errors  And hence its pangs are welcomeOne base purpose  Produc'd these scenes of unexpected horror  But Heaven has will'd that crime should quicken crime  To shew the danger of one devious step  From the clear paths of probity and truth  My dear Mendoza thou wilt not deny me  The title of thy wife to grace my tomb  And I shall sleep in peaceConsole my father  And let him find in thee a worthier child  I had a heart to reverence his virtues  But not the strength to imitateO Heaven    Dies  MENDOZA  'Tis gone 'tis fled the proud the lovely soul  That could not brook the shadow of dishonour  Thy monument shall be the nuptial bed  On which Mendoza will recline and breathe  His faithful fondness to thy list'ning spirit  Nor will I slight the dear and hallow'd trust  Bequeath'd by filial piety to shield  With constant care thy father's honour'd age  Unhappy father round the livid breast  Of his lost child in speechless agony  His arms are rivetedAid me to raise  And bear him gently from this scene of death  THE TWO CONNOISSEURS A COMEDY OF THREE

benevolent projects I hope you'll complete  By this trip from your snug scientific retreat  In return for amusement you've given me there  By your fine apparatus and lectures on air  I'll shew you the town and the town is a science  MR CYCLE  On my tutor dear Tom I've a perfect reliance  For I know in that study what vigils you've kept  CARELESS  'Tis the only one truly where I'm an adept  For as to the law that's the science of thorns  And tho' its black robe my lean figure adorns  Perhaps twice a year for my father's good pleasure  I've renounc'd I confess both its toil and its treasure  From my sapient Lord Coke this advantage I gain  He led me to find out a flaw in my brain  That title on which as wise parents have done  My father laid claim to the seals for his son  MR CYCLE  Such language dear Tom is in truth but a brogue  That betrays the young heir as an indolent rogue  'Tis the cant of ye allye want talents to drudge  CARELESS  Well think me my friend wise enough for a judge  I still must rejoice I have nothing to do  As my heart now inclines me to wait upon you  I wish I could raise you the cash you require  But you know I depend on a closehanded sire  Who promises largely and often has said  He will make me a Croesus whenever I wed  But to drive me I think to the conjugal state  Keeps the purse of the batchelor woefully strait  And guineas at present are scarce to my sorrow  How much are you now come to London to borrow  'Two thousand d'ye say  MR CYCLE  Yes two thousand at least  And perhaps rather more as my plan is increas'd  I wish for no profit but public esteem  And much good to the world must arise from my scheme  CARELESS  Well I wish you may prosper but as I'm a sinner  I as soon should expect a roast Phenix for dinner  As in times like the present such loans from a friend  When Opulence has not a stiver to lend  You philosophers look with contempt upon cash  But the fools of this town are so fond of the trash  That as you're a chemist both skilful and bold  You had best try to make a few odd lumps of gold  And this newlyfound art you may try with less cost  Since to borrow with ease seems an art that is lost  MR CYCLE  Dear Careless you're welcome to rally my hopes  So attack them with all your rhetorical tropes  The man is illwrapt in philosophy's cloak  Whose bosom is ruffled dear Tom by a joke  I know money's scarce yet I will not despond  I've two friends who'll supply what I want on my bond  CARELESS  What  two  such good friends so rich open and free  Dear Cycle I pray introduce them to me  For not one of that cast my long list can produce  Why man such a friend is the goldenegg'd goose  You may hunt for the bird e'en as long as you're able  But at last you will find it is only a fable  I wanted but one hundred pound t'other day  And ask'd fifty friends that chance threw in my way  But they all shook their heads with a negative nod  So I dunn'd my old father in spite of the rod  But pray do I know the good creatures you mean  MR CYCLE  Aye bothThey're two friends whom for years I've not seen  But in juvenile days I held each as my brother  And I trust that we all are still dear to each other  You're acquainted with Beril  CARELESS  Well there I confess  Your wishes have some little chance of success  If there's one in the world who regardless of pelf  Would relieve a friend's wants tho' he straiten'd himself  You have now nam'd the man Yet perhaps he can't lend  I know he has suffer'd by aiding a friend  And I fancy he has but a slender estate  'Tis true he ne'er plays tho' carest by the great  Yet in statues and books he's expensive 'tis said  I have seen him bid high for a porphyry head  MR CYCLE  'Tis hard fortune still should torment him with crosses  I sooth'd him to bear the severest of losses  I was with him when blasted in youth's blooming charms  His lovely Sophia was torn from his arms  You knew not I think that unfortunate fair  The victim of cruelty love and despair  She was bound to our friend by a mutual affection  But her rich sordid parents oppos'd the connection  The canker of sorrow incessantly prey'd  On the perishing bloom of the delicate maid  Her duty her suff'rings made nature relent  And wrung from her father a tardy consent  But death render'd vain the late sanction he gave  And his child's bridal bed was the pitiless grave  Many years have now soften'd the lover's wild grief  Perhaps some new beauty now yields him relief  He's still single I think  CARELESS  Yes in learning and art  He has sought the chief balm for the wounds of his heart  Hence a pleasing mild elegance runs thro' his life  And had I a sister I'd wish her his wife  But now for your second friendWhat is his name  For acquaintance with him too I'll certainly claim  You say that I know him come tell me who is it  MR CYCLE  Yes indeed it is one whom you frequently visit  And here you must own that my hopes are well founded  Since in kindness and wealth he has ever abounded  And a legacy lately  CARELESS  You don't mean Bijou  That collector of knickknacks  MR CYCLE  Indeed Tom I do  I've a title to ask any favor from him  He has some little vanity some little whim  Yet still he's a friendly benevolent man  CARELESS  You may rap at his doorbut get in if you can  Your friend when you saw him was jocund and free  His heart full of bounty his spirit of glee  His vanities too had so mirthful a cast  That Friendship herself even wish'd them to last  But Marriage that changer of mind and of feature  Has made poor Bijou quite a different creature  MR CYCLE  I am told that his wife with a pocket well laden  Was a little fat ancient and wellbehav'd maiden  Who having a similar taste for virtù  Put her cabinet under the care of Bijou  CARELESS  Yes indeed in an odd fit of amorous hunger  He married an old curiositymonger  Who is ready to faint if a visitor knocks  While she's brushing the dust from her rareeshew box  Her maid t'other day threw her into a swoon  By cracking the eye of a great stuff'd baboon  For instead of young children whose troublesome noise  Might disturb their sedate  virtuosical  joys  She fills their fine house with new monsters or mummies  MR CYCLE  Of your story dear Tom I perceive what the sum is  You don't like the ladyshe may not please you  And yet be an excellent wife for Bijou  I am told she has really much merit and taste  In her morals they say she's remarkably chaste  So with lectures perhaps she has wounded your ear  And you rakes of the Temple may think her severe  CARELESS  No faith with the lady I stand very well  I bought her esteem with an old empty shell  I own she has piety morals and sense  To chastity no one will doubt her pretence  But tho' with these virtues I freely invest her  My heart I confess is inclin'd to detest her  She has ruin'd her husbandat least so I think  To a dwarf she has made his benevolence shrink  And puff'd up his vanity into a giant  To all her strange whims he's so servilely pliant  He'd obey her caprice whatsoe'er it might hint  And deny himself bread to buy her an odd flint  MR CYCLE  Why Tom that's a proof of his fond tender heart  CARELESS  To me it proves nought but her ladyship's art  And so you yourself would explain the whole riddle  If you heard her once flatter his pencil or fiddle  As a more wretched brush never blotted poor paper  And ne'er squeak'd a Cremona beneath a worse scraper  Tho' pamper'd with flattery thus by his wife  Our friend has quite lost all his humor and life  And whenever I look on his cold chearless face  As he stands by the side of his wife's fossilcase  I think her a perfect Medusa I own  Who has turn'd her poor husband himself into stone  MR CYCLE  You loungers dear Tom in your idle disputes  Love to ridicule all life's amusing pursuits  But they all have their use and the lady who joys  In collecting an odd set of whimsical toys  Is herself a rare gem that my judgment regards  More than all the fair votaries of scandal and cards  I know I shall like her in spite of your stricture  And I'm going to see how you've fail'd in her picture  My old friend's goodwill I shall put to the trial  And solicit his aid without fear of denial  CARELESS  Come alongI will see if your welcome is hearty  Indeed I may serve you by joining the party  And I'm eager to know for my portrait is true  What you think of the change she has wrought in Bijou  To a knowledge of nature I ne'er will pretend  If when you have seen in the house of our friend  All the natural rarities rang'd in a glass  You don't rank his heart in the petrified class  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to a Drawing Room at  Mrs Bijou  's with a Door open into an interior Cabinet of CuriositiesSeveral stuff'd Creatures and other Rarities discovered in the Apartment  JOAN  with a Brush  Lackaday would I once were well out of this house  Where I tremble to move full as much as a mouse  And Nanny's afraid to come into this room  Indeed the poor creature can scarce hold a broom  For my mistress she says has done nothing but bait her  Since she brush'd off the tail of the new alligator  I've a great mind to lay up my brush on the shelf  And leave madam to dust all her monsters herself  Would my master would make her for these stocks and stones  A young little plaything of good flesh and bones  But alas these old ladies who can't raise a baby  Are as full of nonsensical maggots as may be  And our house is so cramm'd with this whimsical jumble  That if you touch one thing another will tumble  Madam says I misplace whatsoever I clean  But I'll venture to wipe off the dust from this screen    Throws it down  A plague take the things they do nothing but fall  Lud my fingers have run thro' the cover and all    Taking up the Screen and uncovering it  'Tis my master's new drawinghow madam will thunder  This fine naked beauty I've torn quite asunder  And the rent must be seenI can thrust my whole thumb in  And I've no time to mend itmy mistress is coming  MRS BIJOU  entering in a dark brown Bedgown with a Brush of Peacock's Feathers  Some new mischief's done hereLord Joan what's the matter  I am sure you broke somethingI heard such a clatter  JOAN  Indeed Ma'am I've had a most cruel disaster  The screen  MRS BIJOU  What the beautiful work of your master  JOAN  My finger slipt thro' as I wip'd it in haste  But I'm sure I can mend it again with some paste  MRS BIJOU  You awkward pert hussey pray let it alone  Can paste mend a flaw in a goddess's zone  Ye stars give me patienceGet out of this door  And pray let me never set eyes on you more  I knew I should suffer as soon as you came  For taking a thing with so gothic a name  JOAN  I'll gofor I live but the life of a cur  Yet pray on my name do not throw any slur  I am sure 'tis good English altho' it is Joan  And that's more than you're able to say of your own    Exit  MR BIJOU  entering  What's the matter my dearWhat new plague from your maids  You for ever are vext by these pestilent jades  If bred in this town you object to their morals  If rustics they break all your glasses or corals  Let 'em come whence they will they bring trouble and strife  And your quarrels have made me half sick of my life  MRS BIJOU  Don't say soYou know my dear Mr Bijou  I take no young maids out of fondness to you  And these middleag'd creatures are all so unhandy  They make me as fretful as old Mr Shandy  But my dear if you see me sometimes in a flame  I think you won't say that my temper's to blame  'Twas my love for the works of your delicate hand  Which produc'd an emotion I could not command  If I rated old Joan in a great agitation  I am sure you will own I had much provocation  When you see this sad cause of the bustle between us  She has utterly ruin'd your very best Venus  This new lovely drawing the joy of all eyes  I vow I could cry  MR BIJOU  What sweet softnessshe cries  These feelings indeed prove the true connoisseur  This ill treatment of Art her fine sense can't endure  Henceforth of my works let them say what they will  No painter can boast such a test of his skill  Come chear up my dear Cognoscente come come  I can mend it again with a brushfull of gum  MRS BIJOU  D'ye think you can mend itand won't it look brown  If you don't hide the skin with the skirt of a gown  'Twould be pity to cloak up a body so fine  Especially since you have drawn it from mine  And you know I caught cold when I stript to the waist  To sit for the figure in true attic taste  But I did it from fondness that you might not roam  And wickedly hunt after models from home  To be sure I love artbut all artists they say  By their studies of nature are tempted to stray  And I own that your genius gives me great alarms  MR BIJOU  My dear tender creature pray trust your own charms  MRS BIJOU  Affectionate terrors will rise in my head  I was jealous I own t'other day of the dead  MR BIJOU  What fond sensibility exquisite feeling  MRS BIJOU  I hope I was wrong but strange fancies will steal in  When fondness has open'd the heart to suspicion  You're so dear to the females of every condition  But I hope Lady Fancybird was not so vicious  There was nothing indeed in her air meretricious  Yet a jealous pang seiz'd me I own when I found  That by will she bequeath'd to you three thousand pound  'Tis true that a legacy's very commodious  Yet the money appears to me utterly odious  When I think it was possibly meant as the price  Of endearments to which she had art to entice  And not in return for the pictures you drew  Of her parrot her bullfinch and old cockatoo  MR BIJOU  Lord my dear if such phantoms your quiet consume  You will make the old lady jump out of her tomb  'Tis true that I flatter'd her favourite passion  As I love to be well with old ladies of fashion  But pray don't suppose I was e'er so absurd  As to stroke her pale cheek for the pole of her bird  MRS BIJOU  Ah you humorous man you've such infinite wit  You can turn to a jest whatsoe'er you think fit  But my heart on this point can be never at ease  Unless you'll allow me to spend as I please  Half the money of which you're so oddly possest  And then I shall think it an honest bequest  Besides there's an auction at Lady ToyTruckle's  And I long for a rap at the Duchess's knuckles  Who outbid me you know t'other day for a shell  'Tis all for your credit  MR BIJOU  Well well my dear well  I never refuse you the cash I can spare  MRS BIJOU  You are sure I shall turn it to something most rare  For indeed I'm no pitiful hoarder of pelf  And I've now set my heart on some true ancient delf  MR BIJOU  'Tis time you were drest  MRS BIJOU  As I live there's a rap  I'm not fit to be seen in this bedgown and cap  Run and charge them my dear not to let in a soul  With my cabinet dust I'm as black as a coal  MR BIJOU  looking out  I'm too late  MRS BIJOU  For my orders they don't care a pin  And to vex me old Joan has let somebody in  I'll escapeI can't bear to be seen in this trim  MR BIJOU  'Tis only Tom Carelessyou need not mind him  Enter  Careless  and  Mr Cycle  CARELESS  Here good folks I have brought you a very rare bird  'Tis five years since his notes in this town have been heard  MR BIJOU  Mr Cycle my worthy old friend how d'ye do  Give me leave to present to you Mrs Bijou  MRS BIJOU  I'm asham'd to be found in this garb  MR BIJOU  O my dear  From a man of true science you've nothing to fear  He'll freely allow for he's candid and just  Philosophical ladies must dabble in dust  Mr Cycle my wife is a curious collector  In natural knowledge I hope you'll direct her  You are master of all from the earth to the stars  And may aid her in ranging her fossils and spars  Mr CYCLE  She shall freely command all the little I know  MRS BIJOU  You're extremely obliging dear Sir to say so  But I cannot attend you in this dusty vest  I'll soon slip it off  CARELESS  You sha'n't stir I protest  To talk of your dress my dear Ma'am is a joke  To a sage who exists but in chemical smoke  Your robe is indeed like the robe of Saint Bruno  Yet still by your air we might take you for Juno  While the tail of your peacock that type of command  With such dignity waves in your awful white hand  MRS BIJOU  You're a young saucy creature  MR CYCLE  These idie rouges Madam  More like sons of the Serpent than children of Adam  Are apt to esteem it a dull occupation  To study the wonders of this fair creation  And hence they all rally with humor illplac'd  Those who seek for amusement in science and taste  MR BIJOU  Well said Mr CycleI'm glad that Virtù  Has found both a friend and a champion in you  Come and peep at my wife's philosophical treasure  I hope you'll survey it again at your leisure  My dear d'ye allow me to shew your museum  I'm exact in all matters of  tuum  and  meum  MRS BIJOU  Mr Cycle I'm sure is a privileg'd man  MR BIJOU  It is openCome Sir    Exit with  Mr Cycle  into the interior Apartment  MRS BIJOU  Tell me Tom if you can  Is not this Mr Cycle a man of great worth  Who wrote a most excellent book on the Earth  CARELESS  'Tis the author himself and I know not what college  Can shew his superior in virtue and knowledge  He's a man of few words with a heart and a mind  Ever busied in schemes for the good of mankind  And he now visits London in hopes to procure  Some support in a plan for relieving the poor  MRS BIJOU  The poorof their name I'm alarm'd at the mention  Mr Cycle indeed may have no ill intention  But I fear he'll involve my good husband in trouble  These projects of charity end in a bubble  The poor are ungrateful disorderly wretches  Who can shift for themselves by their tricks and their fetches  They deserve not a learned philosopher's thought  CARELESS  Your pardonHe'll think if he thinks as he ought  That Philosophy drawing from Heaven her birth  Is the science of soft'ning the evils on earth  By your fears you have done our friend infinite wrong  For tho' his heart's tender his judgment is strong  To the projects of Folly he never can stoop  Philanthropy's friend is not Phantasy's dupe  MRS BIJOU  Why Careless you talk in a language quite new  Who could dream of a charitysermon from you  CARELESS  Oh a cobler can preach when his spirit's inflam'd  Mine is apt to blaze forth if I hear a friend blam'd  And indeed I can't stifle my heart's ebullitions  When such good folks as you harbour vile suppositions  But I'm sure you'll forgive all the warmth I have shewn  When the worth of our friend is to you better known  If you're angry I know that your anger will cease  When you hear on what terms I can purchase my peace  A shell I can bring youmy interest such is  Very like what you lately gave up to the Duchess  Perhaps I may give it you  MRS BIJOU  You're a good soul  As large as her Grace's and perfectly whole  CARELESS  Yes I think 'tis as large and in colour as high  MRS BIJOU  Are you sure of its shape  CARELESS  Do you question my eye  I'll convince you I'm right let us instantly look  At the fine colour'd plates in your great Danish book  MRS BIJOU  Comeyou give me more joy than I'm able to speak  I can't bear that her Grace should possess an  Unique    They retire into the interior Apartment from whence  Mr Bijou  and  Mr Cycle  return  MR BIJOU  This scheme my good friend does you honor indeed  In a business so noble I hope you'll proceed  And may you accomplish your utmost desires  In raising the sum which your project requires  Pray look at this new little drawing of mine  Don't you think it an elegant pretty design  MR CYCLE  Yery lively indeedBut my friend you forget  What I've said on the point of incurring this debt  Do not fly from the subjectI hate all evasion  I must say for your aid I have serious occasion  You know what I've ask'd and in asking I deem  That I give you a proof of my cordial esteem  In a poorhouse myself I would rather work hard  Than apply thus to one whom I did not regard  MR BIJOU  Mr Cycle I know you're a man without guile  And you think in a noble and singular style  But if asking for cash is of love a sure test  With affectionate friends all the wealthy are blest  MR CYCLE  I have done as I see that you wish to evade  A request that I thought I with justice had made  As you know when of fortune you felt a reverse  You had once the command of my prosperous purse  And since you of opulence now are possest  More enrich'd too of late by a friendly bequest  I suppos'd without trouble  MR BIJOU  Dear Cycle 'tis true  You shall have it but mum towards Mrs Bijou  MR CYCLE  O I now understand all the cause of demur  And if that is the case I have done my dear Sir  At the hazard of discord the sum you sha'n't lend  In family strife I'll not plunge my old friend  MR BIJOU  Do not think me a slavethere's no danger of strife  But you'll find if you e'er try the conjugal life  It is best not to waken the frowns of a wife  Besides there is surely no reason why you  Should talk on such business to Mrs Bijou  MR CYCLE  There is certainly noneyou shall do as you please  MR BIJOU  One thousand my friend I can spare you with ease  'Tis the sum I shall go to receive very soon  If you'll call here again you shall have it by noon  And to tell you the truth I would have you make haste  Lest my wife should demand it for matters of taste  When an auction is near she is apt to be rash  In laying her hand upon all my loose cash  And as she is thought so judicious a buyer  Her elegant wishes I seldom deny her  Yet 'tis time to grow prudentbut hush here they come  Remember my chargedear philosopher mum  Enter  Mrs Bijou  and  Careless  MRS BIJOU  O my dear I'm in raptures my young friend has cur'd  All the bitter vexation I've lately endur'd  Now in shells by the Duchess I am not surpast  Tom will bring me the fellow to what she bought last  MR BIJOU  He's exceedingly kindBut my dear it grows late  Remember the guest whom you must not make wait  Old Baron VanBettle's appointed today  Your curious collection of flies to survey  As some business abroad will oblige me to leave him  I entreat you my dear to be drest to receive him  These friends will excuse you  MRS BIJOU  I'll bid them farewell  Mr Cycle your servantRemember the shell    Exit  MR BIJOU  O my friend you've a thousand new drawings to see  I can tell you our artists grow jealous of me  JOAN  entering hastily  Sir a coach is just stopt and a man with a star on  MR BIJOU  Od's life I must leave you to wait on the Baron  MR CYCLE  I beg we mayn't keep you  MR BIJOU  My good friends adieu  Dear Cycle pray meet me again here at two  I am sorry I'm forc'd thus to part with you now  But for such an engagement I'm sure you'll allow  For the flies are all rang'd in the parlour below  And a guest like the Baron one can't leave you know  As the key's in the case he perhaps might unlock it  And whip the best butterfly into his pocket  'Tis a law with the curious to watch a collector  And you never must trust him without an inspector    Exit  CARELESS  Now my friend what d'ye say to the portrait I drew  Were my colours too dark for good Madam Bijou  But how have you far'd in your moneypetition  If you get it I'll call you a mighty magician  I can tell you that Madam suspected a plot  MR CYCLE  I've his promisebut shall I accept it or not  CARELESS  If you can by all means'twill be sav'd from her clutches  Who would throw it away in outbidding a Duchess  And at auctions indeed she'd her husband undo  Were she not in her house quite a closehanded Jew  But on saving a penny she frequently ponders  And her avarice scrapes what her vanity squanders  O if I were her master her whimsies I'd cure  And make a good wife of this vile connoisseur  Now for Berilhe's one of a different cast  MR CYCLE  Come alongsince I saw him some long years have past  And I'm eager to clasp his affectionate hand  CARELESS  Stop a moment and answer me this one demand  Don't you see a sad change in our poor friend below  Where's the lively companion the humorous beau  All his pleasantry's gone  MR CYCLE  I confess by his carriage  He seems to be render'd more serious by marriage  CARELESS  By my life I am griev'd in thus seeing him grow  The poor trumpeting slave to his wife's rareeshew  Well ye Gods if whenever my nuptial star twinkles  I should wed an old hunter of odd periwinkles  To engage her nice eye with unchanging attraction  May I turn in her arms to a cold petrifaction  End of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  An elegant Apartment ornamented with a few Busts and Books a large Statue covered up and a Door open into a more extensive Library  Mr Beril  and  Harry  MR BERIL  PRAY Harry remove from the statue its case  And be careful in clearing the dust from its base  HARRY  Directly Sir  MR BERIL  Yes you must instantly do it  For my worthy Lord Seewell is coming to view it  Now my sweet Lady Frances I soon shall behold  All thy quick sensibility wake and unfold  Thou wilt pay to this sculpture the tribute most dear  Thou wilt praise the fine work by an eloquent tear  Unless by gay Harriot thy softness is check'd  How I long in thy features to mark the effect  Produc'd by the wonders of exquisite art  On a delicate mind and a sensible heart  But why on thy graces do I rashly dwell  Why study those charms that I know but too well  In my station 'tis madness to think of thy hand  Yet thou of all women in this lovely land  Thou only could'st fill in my desolate breast  The place that my tender Sophia possest  HARRY  advancing  There Sir 'tis as neat as a newtwisted cord  But I hope you won't sell this fine thing to my Lord  He's a desperate bidder for stonework I'm told  Yet I hope you will keep it in spite of his gold  MR BERIL  Do you hope sopray whyI should rather have thought  You'd rejoice if his lordship the statue had bought  It would save you some trouble  HARRY  For that I don't care  Why I wish you to keep it I'll freely declare  I've observ'd since the day that poor Miss Sophy died  And that's five years I think next Bartholomewtide  There is only this statue that's now in our sight  In which you have seem'd to take any delight  And if this marble woman your heart so engages  Before you should sell her I'd give up my wages  MR BERIL  Thou'rt a generous lad with an excellent heart  Honest Harry the statute and I shall not part  But I hear a coach stophaste and let my Lord in    Exit  Harry  MR BERIL  alone  Harry's warmth is affecting'Tis pleasant to win  A regard unconstrain'd from the low ranks of life  Which are falsely suppos'd full of baseness and strife  How mistaken is he who incessantly raves  That domestics are nothing but idiots or knaves  When nature oft shines with a lustre most fervent  In the zeal of an honest affectionate servant  Enter  Lord Seewell  with  Lady Frances  and  Lady Harriot  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Beril my girls would attend me to see  Either you or your statueHowe'er that may be  I know you'll allow them a sight of your treasure  MR BERIL  My Lord I confess I had hopes of this pleasure  And my statue henceforth I more highly shall rate  Since to that I'm in debt for an honor so great  LADY HARRIOT  That's right Mr BerilI pray make it known  That we come for the sake of the marble alone  For tho' we have both a fair name as I think  Yet our poor reputations will instantly sink  If 'tis said by your neighbour old Lady SnapFan  That instead of a statue we visit a man  MR BERIL  If on spirit and worth there is any reliance  Lady Harriot may set every hag at defiance  And force even Scandal in silence to sit  If not just to her innocence aw'd by her wit  LADY HARRIOT  My dear Sir do not talk in so pleasing a tone  If you do I sha'n't relish the silence of stone  And the statue'll seem dullSo pray tell us where is it  Pray present us to her that we're now come to visit  MR BERIL  Here's the lady you honour    Shewing the Statue  LORD SEEWELL  Indeed this is fine  What perfect expression what strength of design  MR BERIL  Pray my dear Lady Frances advance to the place  Which will give you I think the best view of the face  'Tis the tender Alcestis just yielding her breath  On the arm of her husband reclining in death  And tho' pain o'er her form so much languor has thrown  You may still discern beauties resembling your own  LORD SEEWELL  Whence came it dear Beril'tis surely antique  The work my good friend is undoubtedly Greek  I swear the Laocoon is not so fine  Had I choice of the two this I'm clear would be mine  The subject more pleasingexpression still higher  This longhidden treasure where could you acquire  MR BERIL  I owe it to chance to acknowledge the truth  And a princely and brave Neapolitan youth  Whom I luckily sav'd in a villainous strife  From the dagger of jealousy aim'd at his life  The work was dug up on his father's estate  And knowing my passion for marble is great  He nobly has sent me the gift in your view  In return for what accident led me to do  LORD SEEWELL  'Tis the first piece of sculpture perhaps on the earth  And I hardly know how to appreciate its worth  But if ever you wish to dispose of the treasure  I'll accept it at three thousand guineas with pleasure  MR BERIL  My Lord you now speak with that liberal spirit  Which you ever display when you estimate merit  Tho' I own works of art of such high estimation  Seem but ill to agree with my fortune and station  Yet these figures at present I wish to retain  Tho' the wish may appear ostentatious and vain  But my Lord if they e'er change their master anew  They shall find a more worthy possessor in you  LADY HARRIOT  Well ye dear connoisseurs you amaze me I own  By the value you set on this sorrowful stone  I indeed can believe 'tis a fine piece of art  But to buy it for furnitureas to my part  I'd as soon o'er my house throw a sepulchre's gloom  And purchase from WestminsterAbbey a tomb  LORD SEEWELL  You're a wild idle gipsy and past all correcting  You have not the least relish for what is affecting  LADY HARRIOT  That's your fault dear Papabut my sister you see  Makes ample amends for this failing in me  She gazes like you with such serious delight  That she's half turn'd to marble herself by the sight  I vow it has made her unable to speak  And has drawn a cold tear down her petrified cheek  LADY FRANCES  Pray my dear don't expose me  MR BERIL  O seek not to hide  What nature design'd your chief beauty and pride  With different charms she enriches the earth  To your sister she gave the sweet dimples of mirth  And that each in her province no rival may find  All the soft pensive graces to you she assign'd  LADY HARRIOT  Believe me you shine Mr Beril most brightly  In the delicate science of praising politely  In which many beaux are so savagely stupid  They a scalpingknife take for the weapon of Cupid  And to tickle one nymph basely slash every other  Well dear Frances how are you  LADY FRANCES  Indeed I can't smother  What I feel in surveying this wonder of art  It has something which takes such fast hold of the heart  In the faint dying wife such a fond resignation  In the poor widow'd husband such wild agitation  Such sorrow such anguish such love to Alcestis  LADY HARRIOT  That is true but I know the whole story a jest is  And Admetus I think such a shuffling poltroon  That he moves me no more than the man in the moon  A pitiful fellow to live in his case  And let his poor wife pass the Styx in his place  Modern husbands indeed I believe would be merry  If their wives in their stead would cross over that ferry  MR BERIL  But perhaps Ma'am you think that no husband could find  A young modern wife of Alcestis's mind  LADY HARRIOT  No indeed my good SirHere's my dear sister Fan  She'd be willing to die to preserve her good man  But I own for myself I should doubt and demur  If I thought my spouse wish'd his own trip to defer  Tho' myself to his fortunes I'd freely devote  If we both might embark at one time in the boat  I confess I should scarce be so wondrously kind  As to set sail myself but to leave him behind  HARRY  entering  Two gentlemen Sir wish to see you below  Mr Careless is one  LORD SEEWELL  to  Mr Beril  Harriot's favourite beau  LADY HARRIOT  Lord Papa Mr Beril will think me in love  MR BERIL  to  Harry  Let the gentlemen know we expect them above    Exit  Harry  LORD SEEWELL  Tom and Harriot have long had flirtations together  But their courtship has changeable fits like the weather  The improvident girl thinking lovers are plenty  Declares she won't wed till she's past oneandtwenty  Nor e'en then take her beau in her charms such her trust is  Unless he bids fair to become a chief justice  And Tom is the heir of too large an estate  To load his gay spirit with law's heavy weight  But here comes our young lawyer to urge his own plea  Enter  Careless  and  Mr Cycle  MR BERIL  My dear Tom how d'ye doMy good stars can it be  Is it you my dear Cycle my longabsent friend  MR CYCLE  And still heartily yours  MR BERIL  But why would you not send  And of your affection afford me a proof  By bespeaking your quarters here under my roof  However I'm happy that chance is so kind  As to give me th' occasion I've long wish'd to find  To present you to one who of all men on earth  Is most able to judge of your genius and worth  My dear Lord to your notice now let me commend  The man to whose name you're already a friend  Behold Mr Cycle  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Sir let me say  That I often have wish'd for this fortunate day  Which makes me acquainted with one whom I deem  So justly entitled to public esteem  Whose writings and life shew in fairest alliance  Philanthropical virtue and genuine science  MR CYCLE  My good Lord these are honours far more than my due  Yet I own with delight I receive them from you  As you're led to o'errate my poor merits I feel  By this dear partial friend's kind affectionate zeal  LORD SEEWELL  He indeed is your friendI regard his applause  But to wish your acquaintance I've still higher cause  Be assur'd I shall think myself truly your debtor  If you'll give me the pleasure of knowing you better  Either Beril or Careless will guide you to me  I have some things perhaps it may please you to see  Yet no gem I believe that's so worthy your sight  As a statue which Beril has just brought to light  Allow me to shew it you  MR BERIL  to  Lady Frances  Your  tender breast  My dear Lady Frances I fear is opprest  By this sculptur'd distress the mere creature of art  Yet too painful a scene for so feeling a heart  LADY FRANCES  No indeedat first sight tho' it made my veins thrill  And I felt thro' my bosom a cold icy chill  That impression once over I view it again  With a soothing delight unembitter'd by pain  LADY HARRIOT  to  Careless  And pray Sir from  which  court of justice come you  CARELESS  From the worshipful court of wise Madam Bijou  Where blind as old Themis she utters decrees  On the price of stuff'd parrots and petrified trees  LADY HARRIOT  O you mischievous creature you certainly mean  By the sound of her name to awaken my spleen  You know that the thought of her sickens me quite  And that I at her house must do penance tonight  CARELESS  Then I vow I'll be there if it's only to see  How Mortification and you may agree  Even that gloomy spright must appear with some grace  If it lurks in the lines of so lively a face  LADY HARRIOT  All my gaiety dies when her presence I come in  No crampfish could give me a shock so benumbing  She's my utter aversion  LORD SEEWELL  Pray tell me my dear  Of whom do you speak in a style so severe  LADY HARRIOT  Of your friend dear Papa your good Mrs Bijou  LORD SEEWELL  That's ungrateful dear Harriotshe's civil to you  And you should not indulge a satyrical vein  LADY HARRIOT  You forget my dear Sir how you often complain  That her low little pride and nonsensical whim  Have reduc'd your old friend to a pitiful trim  And I think she has made him so gloomy a slave  She has pent her good man in Trophonius's cave  Such to him was the temple of Hymen for after  He enter'd its vestibulefarewell to laughter  LORD SEEWELL  Why Harriot you really are quite acrimonious  But if you call wedlock the cave of Trophonius  Have a care if that cavern you chance to step near  You love laughing too well to resign it my dear  LADY HARRIOT  And therefore tho' woo'd like the nymph of Toboso  I never will marry an old virtuoso  Who thinks himself blest with taste science and worth  Because he picks up all the odd things on earth  When a passion for art or for nature is join'd  With a warm friendly heart and a liberal mind  I respect the pure taste which that union produces  Free from vanity's sordid fantastic abuses  Tho' I do not possess it I see and commend  Such taste dear Papa both in you and your friend  But I view with an utter contempt I confess  Those who awkwardly ape what you really possess  And for Mrs Bijou she has just as much soul  As a monkey who carries queer things to its hole  She with wonderful gusto half Gothic half Dutch  Like an old squirrel hides all she can in her hutch  CARELESS  An excellent portrait and true I protest  For I've just had a peep at the old squirrel's nest  LADY HARRIOT  Pray since we together her closet inspected  What whimsical rarities has she collected  CARELESS  O before I could count half the baubles she buys  I could tell you the name of each star in the skies  Her sphere is too wide for my genius to scan it  But I know what she reckons her Georgian planet  Her newlyfound starwhich tonight if you're free  Thro' a glass she perhaps may allow you to see  LADY HARRIOT  What wonder is thisis it flesh fish or fowl  A Lilliput dog or a Brobdignag owl  Or is it a remnant from Joseph's odd coat  CARELESS  It is something once held by a person of note  In our island and now I defy you to guess  LADY HARRIOT  Is it Essex's ring or the ruff of Queen Bess  Or Alfred's caketoaster or Rizzio's fiddle  Pray tell meI hate to be teaz'd by a riddle  CARELESS  In short 'tis a nightcap not worth half a groat  Which she for a guinea has luckily bought  Because this old fragment of worsted she vows  Once serv'd as a crown for poor Chatterton's brows  Tho' I think we should find if we knew the whole truth  That the cap was ne'er seen by that wonderful youth  LADY HARRIOT  Now Chatterton boast that thy illfated verse  Can teach antiquarians to open their purse  Yet hadst thou in misery su'd for that guinea  Its mistress had call'd thee a vain rhyming ninny  And prov'd to thy grief by the style of her giving  Virtuoso's have little esteem for the living  LORD SEEWELL  Come Harriot I  must  stop the tide of your wit  Tho' you're now on a topic you don't love to quit  To  Mr Beril  We  must  take our leaveMany thanks for our pleasure  Mr Cycle rememberyour first day of leisure  You sha'n't stir my dear Beril you sha'n't leave your friend  Here is Careless you know on the girls to attend  Let us see you together and shortlyAdieu  LADY HARRIOT  to  Careless  aside  Below let me whisper a few words to you  Mr Beril  and  Mr Cycle  MR BERIL  Well my worthy old friend I rejoice you are here  And that now you are known to that excellent peer  Who free from all pride affectation and vanity  Unites useful virtue to pleasing urbanity  Plain simple sincere yet of judgment refin'd  And fond of the arts as they're friends to mankind  Ennobled much less by his birth than his spirit  The model of Honor and patron of Merit  But how have you done for this age and what plan  For the profit of science or service of man  Brings you now from your fav'rite sequester'd retreat  Whate'er the occasion I'm glad that we meet  Tho' I meant to be with you ere next summer's sun  MR CYCLE  I know my dear Beril that you are not one  Whose welcome will suddenly sink into sorrow  When I tell you I now visit London to borrow  MR BERIL  If I'm able to levy the sum you require  The world can scarce give me a pleasure much higher  Than that of assisting a friend to whose mind  I have infinite debts of a far deeper kind  I can never forget what I owe to your care  In the frenzy of desolate love and despair  When my reason had yielded to passion's wild strife  Your friendship alone reconcil'd me to life  But tell me dear Cycle what sum will suffice  MR CYCLE  You must know I have lately been led to devise  A scheme for the poor  MR BERIL  My dear friend at your leisure  I'll hear your benevolent projects with pleasure  But farther discourse you must let me prevent  On the source of your wants till I know their extent  For indeed I can't rest till I'm happily sure  That whatever you wish I have means to procure  MR CYCLE  Not to keep you in doubt then my dear ardent friend  Two thousand I fancy will answer my end  The one I am promis'd today from Bijou  For the other I own I've depended on you  MR BERIL  And why not allow me to furnish the whole  Poor Bijou has a wife with no liberal soul  If any demur in that quarter you see  I entreat you to take all you wish for of me  But of this more anonhere is Careless return'd  Mr Beril Mr Cycle  and  Careless  CARELESS  Well my worthy philosopher a'n't you concern'd  To find our friend still unsupply'd with a wife  Thus form'd as he is for the conjugal life  As you're fond of new schemes for the good of the nation  I'll recommend one to your consideration  To revive wedded love that old obsolete passion  And bring honest Hymen again into fashion  MR CYCLE  In truth my dear Tom I am quite of your mind  There is no better scheme for the good of mankind  And nothing I know that could give it more weight  Than the grace which our friend would bestow on that state  MR BERIL  You are merry good friendsI subscribe to your joke  My gravity's fit for the conjugal yoke  CARELESS  I am serious indeed and have often declar'd  That had I a sister for wedlock prepar'd  Of all men in the world if you'd deign to embrace her  In your arms it would make me most happy to place her  But you're courted too much to be easily won  He whom many are fond of can fix upon none  MR BERIL  Indeed my dear Tom you are wrong on this theme  In return for a proof of your cordial esteem  I'll tell you the reason with frankness and truth  Why no nymph has supply'd the lost love of my youth  There is one whose mild virtue and elegant grace  The dear girl I deplore in my heart might replace  But my fortune's too humble for her rank of life  Tho' she may be  your sister  she can't be  my wife  CARELESS  Would you wed Lady Frances  MR CYCLE  The lady I've seen  She is like poor Sophia in features and mien  MR BERIL  You are right my dear friendit was that very thought  Led my heart to attach itself more than it ought  But my reason considers her rank and her station  And forbids me to form any rash expectation  Nor would I attempt to engage her affection  Without the least hope of our happy connection  CARELESS  More honor than foresight you shew by this strain  Be boldthere is nothing  you  may not attain  More of this when we meetI must now say adieu  MR CYCLE  So must Ifor you know my appointment at two  MR BERIL  But I hope my good friends you will both dine with me  MR CYCLE  For myself I'll return to you soon after three  CARELESS  I am griev'd to refuse such a frank invitation  But to tell you the truthI've a kind assignation  MR BERIL  Love and pleasure attend you  CARELESS  Dear Beril adieu  Let us all meet tonight at the house of Bijou    Exeunt  The Drawing Room of  Mrs Bijou  MRS BIJOU  speaking as she enters  Look over the staircase and tell me who knocks  JOAN  entering  Mr Varnish is come with a thing in a box  MRS BIJOU  A thing in a boxYou're a horrible Goth  But as you're to leave me I'll stifle my wrath  'Tis a picture you oafbid him bring it to me    Exit  Joan  Some cabinet jewel I now hope to see  This intelligent Varnish my patronage courts  And I get the first peep at whate'er he imports  Mrs Bijou  and  Mr Varnish  MRS BIJOU  Well Varnish  MR VARNISH  Dear Madam with most humble duty  I have brought you a gem of unparagon'd beauty  MRS BIJOU  Good Varnish what is it  MR VARNISH  An exquisite Titian  You never saw one in such brilliant condition  MRS BIJOU  And what is the subject  MR VARNISH  opening the Case  Now Ma'am I'll display it  Here's a feast for the eye that knows how to survey it  Here's a JosephI ne'er saw his like in my life  And pray Ma'am observe what a Potiphar's wife  How chaste the design yet the colours how warm  What tints in each face and what life in each form  Pray Madam remark how he struggles to fly  We hear him exclaiming "No Mistress not I"  MRS BIJOU  It seems very fine and has striking expression  Was it ever in any great person's possession  MR VARNISH  Not a soul here has seen it except a poor Peer  For whom it was boughtbut alas 'twas too dear  His steward my friendbut I must not be rash  And betray a good Earl with more gusto than cash  Our Lords are all poor and so ruin'd my trade is  I should starve were it not for you welljudging ladies  There's my old Lady Oglenud had she a peep  Would certainly buy it before she would sleep  But having receiv'd many favours from you  I made it a point you should have the first view  MRS BIJOU  I thank you good VarnishBut what is the price  MR VARNISH  She'd give me a thousand I know in a trice  And buy some companions besides if I had 'em  But I'll leave it with you for eight hundred dear Madam  MRS BIJOU  Eight hundredSure Varnish that sum is too much  MR VARNISH  Dear Madam observe what a delicate touch  See how finely 'tis pencil'd and what preservation  There is not I know such a gem in the nation  And Italy has not a brighter I'm sure  The figures so glowing the story so pure  Good ladies would never have wandering spouses  If they'd only hang subjects like this in their houses  MRS BIJOU  I protest your remark is ingenious and new  You have gusto in Morals as well as Virtù  MR VARNISH  aside  I have hopes that my hint will assist our transaction  For the old dame is jealous they say to distraction  MRS BIJOU  Well I own Mr Varnish your picture is fine  If my husband is rich it shall quickly be mine  Here he comes to decide it  Enter  Mr Bijou  MRS BIJOU  My dear here's a fight  You are luckily come to complete my delight  Mr Varnish has been so exceedingly kind  As he knows on a Titian I've long set my mind  To bring me the finest I ever survey'd  And as we have often befriended his trade  He offers to leave it a bargain with us  MR BIJOU  Its merit or price it is vain to discuss  Tho' the picture possesses so tempting an air  At present my dear I've no money to spare  MRS BIJOU  Mr Varnish pray step in the parlour below  Our final resolve you shall presently know  MR VARNISH  Dear Madam for hours I'll wait on your pleasure  And I beg you will note all its beauties at leisure  Aside as he goes out  Now success to the sexBe this struggle more glorious  May the Joseph be kind and the Lady victorious  MRS BIJOU  My dearest you'll not let the picture depart  When you see it has taken such hold on my heart  I really can't rest till a Titian we've got  That  we  may have something Lord Seewell has  not  And as we expect him you know here tonight  I would shew him this piece with triumphant delight  MR BIJOU  I love to indulge all your wishes my dear  But I'm quite out of cash  MRS BIJOU  Nay Bijou I am clear  You have now all I want in your pocketCome come  I know you went out to receive a large sum  And still have it about youI vow I will look  Here it ishere are notes in this little red book    Takes out his PocketBook  MR BIJOU  Indeed I must beg you that book to release  MRS BIJOU  Here are ten I declare of an hundred apiece  I'll take just enough and restore you the rest  MR BIJOU  I can't suffer this freedom my dear I protest  For the notes are not mine they belong to a friend  MRS BIJOU  To a friendO I guess Sir to whom you would lend  Your slylooking guest Mr Cycle's the man  I know he was here on a borrowing plan  Throw your thousand away on a charity bubble  And leave your poor wife to vexation and trouble  MR BIJOU  Nay my dear be not vex'dyou have misunderstood  The sum will be safe and the interest good  MRS BIJOU  And what is the pitiful profit you'll raise  Compar'd to the transport with which we should gaze  On the picture my fondness would have you possess  For reasons the purest that wife can profess  Unkind as you areI have reasons above  Even profit and pleasurethe reasons of love  'Tis my aim by this modest production of art  To strengthen your virtue and chasten your heart  If you daily survey an example so bright  This model of continence ever in sight  No naughty young women will tempt you to wander  But your truth and your love will grow firmer and fonder  MR BIJOU  What a tender ideahow virtuously kind  What affection and taste by each other refin'd  MRS BIJOU  But if for a poor and a foolish projector  You can thwart a fond wife can afflict and neglect her  Go go I shall weep while abroad you may roam  That your charity has no beginning at home  MR BIJOU  It begins and shall end thereI'm melted my dear  You may keep all the notesLet me kiss off that tear  MRS BIJOU  Now again you're my own dear delightful Bijou  And the Titian is mine and my love will be true    Exit in great haste  MR BIJOU  alone  Such virtuous endearments what heart could resist  Yet I fear by poor Cycle this sum will be miss'd  And what shall I say for the failureIn sooth  I think 'twill be fairest to tell him the truth  And sage as he is he perhaps too has felt  That gold at the breath of a woman will melt  As I live here he is and I look rather small  With a pocket so empty to answer his call  Enter  Mr Cycle  MR BIJOU  Mr Cycle you're come and I'm really confus'd  But I know the mischance will by you be excus'd  In notes I had got you the thousand complete  They were all in this pocket  MR CYCLE  The thieves of the street  Have not pick'd it I hope in the bustle of strife  MR BIJOU  It was pick'd I confess by the hand of my wife  But for reasons so pure in so tender a mode  MR CYCLE  I am happy the sum is so justly bestow'd  MR BIJOU  I know you'll forgive when I come to explain  MR CYCLE  Dear Bijou let me save you at once from that pain  And assure you with truth that I now really come  As ready to quit as to take up the sum  Since Beril's so kind that without my desire  He has offer'd me all that my wants can require  MR BIJOU  I protest I am glad you have found such a friend  But if you hereafter should wish me to lend  I beg you will call without scruple on me  Your worthy friend Beril tonight we shall see  And Seewell in gusto the first of our Earls  Will be here with his daughters two delicate girls  To prove my good friend your forgiveness is hearty  Let me hope you will kindly make one of the party  MR CYCLE  Most chearfully  MR BIJOU  WellI am griev'd I must say  That I cannot detain you to dinner today  But to tell you the truth when for these gala nights  My wife is preparing to shew her fine sights  She spends so much time in adjusting her shelves  That we take a cold snap in the kitchen ourselves  So I'm sure you'll excuse it  MR CYCLE  Your reason is strong  And I'm sorry my friend I've intruded so long  MR BIJOU  We have time enough yetdo not hurry away  MR CYCLE  It really grows late  MR BIJOU  I won't press you to stay  As at night o'er our concert you'll come to preside  I am heartily glad all your wants are supply'd  MR CYCLE  Indeed I believe you my honest Bijou  So till night fare you well  MR BIJOU  My dear Cycle adieu  End of ACT II  ACT III  SCENE I  Lord Seewell  and  Lady Harriot  LADY HARRIOT  DEAR Papa don't betray meher delicate mind  Would be wounded I know and would think me unkind  So far from allowing what now I impart  She herself little knows the true state of her heart  LORD SEEWELL  Believe me my dear I with pleasure survey  The sisterly fondness you warmly display  But you who for others so sensibly feel  May here be the dupe of affectionate zeal  And I hope you're mistaken  LADY HARRIOT  My dear Sir observe  You may trace her attachment in every nerve  If I name Mr Beril in some idle tale  Poor Fanny will blush and as often turn pale  In his absence still more and more pensive she grows  Yet thinks not from whence her uneasiness flows  And when he returns tho' her pleasure is meek  Yet the glow of content may be seen on her cheek  And her heart as if fully consol'd by his sight  Appears to repose in a tranquil delight  Dear Papa you'll perceive if you'll open your eyes  That from none but herself she her love can disguise  One other exception perhaps we may find  As I think Mr Beril is equally blind  And robb'd like herself of the talent of seeing  By that diffident love which denies its own being  LORD SEEWELL  I hope this attachment which neither has shewn  Exists my good girl in your fancy alone  LADY HARRIOT  Why so my dear SirShould it prove as you fear  I hope dear Papa that you won't be severe  Consider the delicate frame of my sister  But I know you've a heart that can never resist her  If you once clearly see she has fixt her affection  Tho' she own not her wishes for such a connection  As you know that her nature's so modest and meek  She would die from concealment before she would speak  I have strength to encounter the crosses of life  And to make my part good as a daughter or wife  But our gentle sweet Frances is illform'd to bear  The undeserv'd load of vexation and care  And therefore should wed unregardful of pelf  A husband as tender and mild as herself  LORD SEEWELL  Your reasoning I think is not perfectly just  In the kindness of Beril perhaps I might trust  But the motive you urge for this union my dear  Is what I confess would awaken my fear  As you say your mild sister should never be harrass'd  By those various ills with which life is embarrass'd  I should guard her from all the vexations that wait  On a liberal mind with a narrow estate  And if Beril had thoughts of becoming my son  Had I  not  more objections yet this must be one  LADY HARRIOT  I'll remove it my Lord for indeed this is all  As you think they'll be pinch'd by an income too small  You shall add to their fortune and large it will be  Two thirds of the portion you've destin'd for me  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Harriot I'm charm'd with thy soul I confess  Thou'rt a generous girlto a noble excess  LADY HARRIOT  To that name dear Papa I've no title indeed  As I only give up what I never can need  In your house all my wants will I know be supply'd  And if I should leave it as Careless's bride  The liberal heir of so large an estate  Will not grieve that my fortune has sunk in its weight  Or should my swain frown at the change in my purse  He may e'en take old Themis for better for worse  For tho' I confess he has won my regard  Yet the knot of my love is not twisted so hard  But 'twill slip in a moment if ever I see  That he's rather more fond of my purse than of me  LORD SEEWELL  'Tis a pity the friendly illusions of youth  Cannot instantly turn into substance and truth  Your affectionate fancy my dear is delighted  With the dream of beholding two persons united  Whom you fondly suppose only form'd for each other  LADY HARRIOT  I should like Mr Beril I own for my brother  Because I'm convinc'd that no mortal on earth  In manners in temper in taste and in worth  Is form'd so exactly to suit such a wife  On their lasting attachment I'd venture my life  LORD SEEWELL  Your warm heart my good girl your young judgment deceives  And what the first wishes the second believes  Dear Harriot to  this  fancied match there may be  Many bars which your eyes are unable to see  A mistress conceal'd with a young little fry  LADY HARRIOT  Should an angel declare it the fact I'd deny  For had Beril been loaded with such a connection  In his eyes I had never perceiv'd his affection  But I'll presently solve any doubts of this kind  As I'm soon to be told the true state of his mind  For Careless has promis'd  LORD SEEWELL  O fie my dear fie  Your intemperate zeal has now risen too high  I am really concern'd at your great indiscretion  LADY HARRIOT  Nay but hear me my LordI have dropt no expression  No not one single hint that could truly discover  Why in such a research I commission'd my lover  Don't think dear Papa I'd my sister betray  Enter a  Servant  SERVANT  Mr Beril my Lord sent this letter  LORD SEEWELL  Stay stay  Does any one wait for an answer below  SERVANT  No my Lord the man's gone  LORD SEEWELL  Very well you may go    Exit  Servant  LADY HARRIOT  Should this be an offer'twould give me great pleasure  But I fear he's too modest to take such a measure  Dear Papa does he venture on any advances  LORD SEEWELL  There my dearyou'll not find any mention of Frances  And I think by the note which to you I resign  Your conjectures are not so well founded as mine  LADY HARRIOT  perusing the Letter  "Occasion for money""The statue to you"  I'm amaz'dand can hardly believe it is true  He never would part with so dear a possession  But for some urgent reason  LORD SEEWELL  You see his confession  His strong call for money is frankly declar'd  And I fear his small fortune is greatly impair'd  LADY HARRIOT  These tidings indeed give me real concern  But the source of this step I will speedily learn  Careless soon will be hereI will make him discover  And till we know all give no peace to my lover  But now my dear Lord by this note you may find  How the heart of my sister is really inclin'd  I'm convinc'd this will prove her affection is strong  Here she comes for the trialpray see if I'm wrong  LORD SEEWELL  Well my dear I will try by an innocent plot  If your sister has really this passion or not  Enter  Lady Frances  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Fanny you're come our concern to partake  For we both are much griev'd for our friend Beril's sake  LADY FRANCES  Mr Beril dear SirIs he hurtIs he kill'd  LORD SEEWELL  Nowith terrors too lively your bosom is fill'd  My dear how you trembleBut I was to blame  To raise this alarm in your delicate frame  He is well but some crosses of fortune I fear  Make him sell what he justly confider'd so dear  You will see by this letter  Aside to  Lady Harriot  Ah Harriot 'tis so  The excess of her fear from affection must flow  LADY FRANCES  How painful to him must the exigence be  Which extorts from his hand the agreement I see  How cruel for him to relinquish a treasure  Whence his elegant spirit deriv'd so much pleasure  But I trust dear Papa that your generous mind  Will not now press the bargain he once has declin'd  And scorning to profit by any distress  Will not catch at the gem he still ought to possess  LORD SEEWELL  My dear can I now what I offer'd withhold  And should I the statue no less would be sold  LADY FRANCES  Perhaps if you chose half its value to lend  From so galling a sale you might rescue your friend  LORD SEEWELL  I am pleas'd my dear girl with your spirit I own  But these are bad times for a dangerous loan  And to tell you the truth in this knotty affair  I have just at this crisis no money to spare  But I'll frankly explain our finances to you  And you shall instruct me in what I shall do  As I've seen that old fathers tho' reckon'd most sage  Often injure a child by the frolicks of age  That you may not suffer from follies like these  I have just now consign'd to the care of trustees  All I've sav'd for you bothso if I prove unsteady  You are safeWhen you wed both your fortunes are ready  LADY FRANCES  How kind my dear Sir is whatever you do  But no child was e'er hurt by a parent like you  LADY HARRIOT  I must smile dear Papa at your terrors of slipping  They who take such precautions are seldom found tripping  But if in old age your philosophy varies  I protest I'll forgive you for any vagaries  LORD SEEWELL  Very well Madam Harriot remember your word  I shall claim your indulgence if e'er I'm absurd  But as what I have done our loose money secures  I no longer can touch what I've firmly made yours  LADY FRANCES  Let the fortune of Harriot be sacred I pray  For not very distant is her weddingday  But as  I  am convinc'd I shall not wed at all  Let my portion Papa answer every call  I must beg you to look on it still as your own  And if it may serve for so timely a loan  It can't give me more joy whatsoever my station  Than by saving your friend from such mortification  LORD SEEWELL  My dear girls you are both the delight of my life  May each warmhearted daughter be blest as a wife  What I said was but meant your kind spirit to try  For the wants of our friend I can amply supply  Of esteem it will please me to give him a proof  And preserve the fine statue still under his roof  Enter a  Servant  SERVANT  Mr Careless my Lord  LADY HARRIOT  Now the whole I shall know    Going  LORD SEEWELL  Stay  SERVANT  He wishes to see Lady Harriot below  LORD SEEWELL  Being equally anxious this point to discover  We will all my dear Harriot attend on your lover    Exeunt  SCENE  the Apartments of  Mrs Bijou  MR BIJOU  Where the deuce is my wifeAll her rarities plac'd  Her apartments adjusted with exquisite taste  Some disaster has happen'd or she would be here  Where she ought to be waiting to welcome the Peer  And I fancy I heard her in anger below  Enter  Mrs Bijou  in great Agitation  MR BIJOU  What's the matter my love  MRS BIJOU  O my dear such a blow  I really had swoon'd if vexation and wrath  Had not quicken'd my spirits to scold at the Goth  That awkward old Joanan unmannerly minx  Has knock'd off the nipple my dear from a Sphinx  And now on our chimney it cannot be plac'd  With a wound so indelicate maim'd and disgrac'd  But I've happily got these two Griffins of gold  In the room of the Sphinxes our candles to hold  MR BIJOU  My dear the exchange is most lucky and right  For a Sphinx is an awkward dispenser of light  But whether your Griffin's of gold or of copper  A flame from his mouth is exceedingly proper  MRS BIJOU  By your lessons my love I improve in Virtù  All the gusto I have I have gather'd from you  I have fixt the Great Mummy my dear to the wall  Lest the pert Lady Harriot should give him a fall  She'd be glad to throw down my old king out of spite  And I would not be vext in our triumph tonight  I know our new picture will stir up her gall  And this Titian will make us the envy of all  My dear don't you think it looks well by this light  MR BIJOU  The colours indeed are uncommonly bright  MRS BIJOU  What a beautiful youth is this JosephI swear  I am more and more charm'd with his delicate air  I delight in him more since I've found dear Bijou  That in one of his features he's very like you  MR BIJOU  Where can you my dear any likeness suppose  MRS BIJOU  I protest he has got the true turn of your nose  Not the aquiline curve but a little Socratic  And his eye flashes fire that is chastly ecstatic  There's a rap at our door and I hope my Lord's come  If vexation and envy do not strike him dumb  I think he'll harangue like a critic of Greece  On the exquisite charms of this beautiful piece  I long to behold how he's touch'd by the sight  But I know that his envy will sink his delight  The moment he sees it he'll think his luck cruel  In missing so precious a cabinet jewel  Enter  Mr Beril  and  Mr Cycle  MR BIJOU  Dear Cycle I take this exceedingly kind  And I hope you've not left your Cremona behind  In your presence tonight I most truly rejoice  And shall call for the aid of your hand and your voice  As my wife gives a snug little concert below  When you've seen what her upper apartments can shew  MR CYCLE  You may freely command me my friend as you please  MRS BIJOU  You're a judge Mr Beril of treasures like these  And I'm eager to shew you a Titian that's new  Since we last had the joy of a visit from you  MR BERIL  The story is told Ma'am with striking expression  MRS BIJOU  Don't you envy my husband this brilliant possession  I thought you'd burst forth into rapturous praise  But with no keen delight on this picture you gaze  MR BERIL  To confess Ma'am the truth I'm a whimsical being  And a subject like this I've no pleasure in seeing  On  your  lovely sex 'tis a satire most bitter  That illnature may laugh at and levity titter  But I'm griev'd when an artist has lavish'd his care  On a story that seems a disgrace to the Fair  MRS BIJOU  Our sex's chief lustre I own it obscures  But think what a lesson it offers to yours  Enter  Lady Harriot Lady Frances Lord Seewell  and  Mr Careless  MR BIJOU  My dear Lord I this instant was wishing for you  Your voice is decisive in points of Virtù  And you're come in the moment to end an odd strife  In a matter of taste about Potiphar's wife  Should her story be paintedWe want your decision  And here is the picture that caus'd our division  LORD SEEWELL  Ha my poor old acquaintanceBut how dear Bijou  How the deuce could this picture find favor with you  I hope that rogue Varnish has play'd you no trick  You have paid no great price  MRS BIJOU  I am cut to the quick  Sure my Lord you ne'er look'd on this picture before  LORD SEEWELL  Dear Madam 'tis one that I turn'd out of door  And as I may aid you to 'scape from a fraud  I'll proceed to inform you I bought it abroad  To relieve the distress of an indigent youth  Who copied old Masters with spirit and truth  And when it came home as I valu'd it not  My steward by chance this gay furniture got  To a new house of his it has lately been carried  And as your friend Varnish his daughter has married  I suppose the sly rogue by this picture has try'd  To encrease the small fortune he gain'd with his bride  Search the garment of Joseph you'll find on its hem  And within a dark fold the two letters T M  MRS BIJOU  Aye there is the markWe are cheated we're plunder'd  That infamous villain to ask me eight hundred  But the law shall restore it  MR BIJOU  See Mrs Bijou  See the fruits of my hasty indulgence to you  LORD SEEWELL  Chear up my old friend'Tis my wish that this night  May be witness to nothing but peace and delight  I'll engage to make Varnish your money restore  And perhaps this adventure may save you much more  All we old connoisseurs if the truth we would own  Have at times been outwitted with canvass or stone  But here's one whose example our tribe now invites  To correct our mistakes and improve our delights  Here's Beril tho' blest with a treasure most rare  That with few works of art will admit of compare  Gives up the proud joys that on such wealth attend  For the nobler delight of assisting a friend  MR BERIL  My Lord you amaze me how could you divine  O Careless your zeal has betray'd my design  LORD SEEWELL  You have fixt on the traitor yet are not aware  That you're almost involv'd in a dangerous snare  But I'll shew you this traitor's accomplice my friend  And tell you what mischief these plotters intend  You must know Tom and Harriot in concert pursue  Their dark machinations 'gainst Frances and you  They have sworn you've a tender esteem for each other  Which you both have in modesty labour'd to smother  If their charge can be prov'd I your freedom restrain  And sentence you both to the conjugal chain  MR BERIL  O my Lord that I love Lady Frances is true  Yet I could not avow it to her or to you  But to force my confession such means you employ  I almost may call them the torture of joy  I'm o'erwhelm'd with surprize with delight and with dread  Lest I falsely have heard the kind things you have said  Speak my dear Lady Frances my anguish relieve  Does this tumult of hope my wild fancy deceive  LADY FRANCES  I so long have my father's indulgence confest  That against his decrees I shall never protest  MR BERIL  O how shall I thank thee dear pride of my life  LORD SEEWELL  By cherishing still in the mind of your wife  Such generous feelings as  you  have display'd  From my hand my dear Beril receive the kind maid  Your statue is not more indebted to art  Than she is to nature for molding her heart  They both shall be yours both the statue and bride  And the wants of your friend shall no less be supply'd  Being free from one modish and wealthwasting vice  From those pests of our order the turf and the dice  I enjoy my dear children the fortunate power  Of securing your bliss by an affluent dower  Your quiet shall ne'er by your income be hurt  Which shall equal your wish tho' below your desert  MR BERIL  Of your kindness my Lord I so feel the excess  That my voice cannot speak what my heart would express  MR BIJOU  I am charm'd my dear Lord by your choice of a son  LORD SEEWELL  I know my old friend you'll approve what I've done  You and I dear Bijou wanting proper correction  Have on vanity lavish'd the dues of affection  We have both squander'd cash on too many a whim  But in taste let us take a new lesson from him  And rate our improvements in real Virtù  By the generous acts he may teach us to do  To remember this truth is the connoisseur's duty  "A benevolent deed is the essence of beauty"  MR BIJOU  I confess I too oft have been vanity's fool  But shall hope to grow wise my good Lord in your school  And as mirth should be coupled with wisdom I'll go  And see if the fiddles are ready below    Exit  LORD SEEWELL  Tonight my dear Madam you must not look grave  Tho' Varnish has prov'd such an impudent knave  I promise to make him your money refund  MRS BIJOU  With surprize and vexation I almost was stunn'd  But depending my Lord on your friendly assistance  I am ready to drive all chagrin to a distance  And to share in the joy of our dear happy guests  MR BERIL  What I owe to you Careless this fair one attests  And our sister I hope if I dare use the name  From your friendship will judge of your love's ardent flame  And short'ning your rigorous term of probation  Now fill your kind heart with complete exultation  LADY HARRIOT  The warm blaze of our joy I assure you dear brother  With the cold damp of prudery I will not smother  Your friend has for you play'd so feeling a part  I confess I am charm'd with his spirit and heart  As in law and long courtship he likes not to drudge  I will make him at once my comptroller and judge  CARELESS  I with transport and pride the dear office embrace  LORD SEEWELL  And long may you fill it with spirit and grace  My voice my dear Careless confirms her election  And I give her with joy to your tender direction  For sealing dear Tom you may fix your own day  Without dreading from law any irksome delay  As your father and I have with friendly advances  Already adjusted your nuptial finances  MR BIJOU  entering  Our musicians below are all ready my Lord  Of pleasure you teach us to touch the true chord  I've selected a few little pieces tonight  That are suited I hope to the present delight  May we all think this day the best day of our life  It will prove so I'm sure both to me and my wife  If a bargain should tempt us we will not be rash  But remember the Titian and pocket our cash  To Friendship and Want all we can we will give  And buy no more baubles as long as we live  LORD RUSSEL A TRAGEDY OF THREE ACTS  PREFACE  I HAVE endeavoured to delineate in the following Drama an exact portrait of the noble Personage whose name it bears as I believe that a more engaging model of public and private virtue can hardly be selected from the annals of any nation although the extreme mildness of his temper the simplicity of his manners and above all his unaffected piety are such qualities as are very rarely admitted in the formation of a Tragic Hero  To render my performance interesting to my country I have adhered as closely to our history as the nature of dramatic composition allowed me to do and in points where I have varied from historical truth such variations are I trust supported by dramatic probability  In the spirited and judicious introduction to the latelypublished letters of Lady Russel the testimony of different Historians in collected concerning the sentiments of Charles the Second and his brother on the impending fate of Lord Russel  "In the Duke of Monmouth's Journal it is said that the King told him he inclined to have saved the Lord Russel but was forced to consent to his death otherwise he must have broke with his brother the Duke of York"  Kennet  The sentence just quoted is I hope a sufficient foundation for the conduct which I have assigned to Charles whose character indeed was such that fiction can hardly impute to him any instance of irresolution duplicity and falsehood which the tenor of his life will not bring within the limits of theatrical credibility  The candid reader will readily allow the liberty I have taken in laying the scene in the Tower after Russel's condemnation as it affords many advantages to the conduct of the play  In compliance with that respect which dramatic authors have lately paid to the Clerical character I have not introduced either Tillotson or Burnet among the persons of the drama though the latter was so constant an attendant on the captivity of my Hero an omission which I have in some degree supplied by the introduction of Mr Spencer a character drawn from the printed trial of Lord Russel where the name of that gentleman appears in the list of those  who gave an honourable evidence in behalf of the noble prisoner  I have many obligations to the journal written by Burnet at the request of Lady Russel which contains all the minute circumstances that occurred during the imprisonment and at the execution of her Lord This very interesting and pathetic narrative is printed in the General Dictionary under the article Russel I have not only taken from it many of the sentiments which I have assigned to him in this Tragedy but I have sometimes adopted the very words that were really uttered by Lord Russel and this I have done not only from an affectionate admiration of his character but from a despair of surpassing the elegant simplicity and the force of his expression  The offer relating to his escape so generously made and so nobly refused is a fact universally known and must render the names of Cavendish and Russel an honour to our country as long as magnanimity and friendship retain their just value in the estimation of mankind  Persons of the Drama  KING CHARLES THE SECOND  JAMES DUKE OF YORK  EARL OF BEDFORD  LORD RUSSEL  LORD CAVENDISH  MR SPENCER  LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER  LADY RUSSEL  LADY MARGARET RUSSEL  Officers  c  SCENE  during the first Act in  BEDFORD HOUSE  and afterwards in the  TOWER  LORD RUSSEL  ACT I  SCENE I  Bedford  and  Lady Margaret Russel  LADY MARGARET  REST here my gentle Father nor again  Expose your wearied age and wasted spirits  To scenes of such dread influence to shake  Each fibre of a heart that feels like yours  I pray you rest with me  BEDFORD  My tender child  Thanks to thy filial aid my strength returns  And my reviving soul has gather'd force  To bear the killing sight'Tis true when first  I saw my mild and unoffending son  Pride of my age and England's dear resource  In these disastrous days when I beheld  My blameless Russel at that bar arraign'd  Where only guilt and infamy should stand  When I beheld each servile judge support  A lawless jury basely fram'd against him  Indignant anguish robb'd my wounded heart  Of vital energy quick from the court  My hasty friends hurried my senseless frame  To this our quiet home but since my daughter  Thy kind endearing cares have now restor'd me  I will resume my station by thy brother  In these distressful momentsto his side  Affection calls me and paternal duty  LADY MARGARET  Forgive me that I dare to thwart your wish  But from my generous brother I've receiv'd  A kind injunction to detain your age  From that afflicting scene He has engag'd  To tell us by repeated messengers  Each petty circumstance that passes there  Already from the number of his friends  He has selected one to bring us tidings  His faithful Spencer comes  Enter  Spencer  BEDFORD  What from my Son  The sentence is not pass'd  SPENCER  No my dear lord  England is yet unsullied with the stain  That must disgrace her if the sword of Justice  Turns to the murderous dagger of Revenge  To stab your virtuous sonBy his request  I come to soothe your anxious sufferings  And to relate the process of a scene  Where he conjures you to appear no more  BEDFORD  What perjur'd slaves have they suborn'd against him  How far has truth been wrong'd and law been tortur'd  To frame those snares of legal death in which  They labor to involve incautious virtue  Have they not dealt most hardly with my son  SPENCER  He has experienc'd subtle cruelty  From venal ruffians in the robes of justice  But the base wrong his patient worth endures  Is the dark foil which gives the diamond lustre  When he requested aid for his defence  His keen insidious foes who strongly fear'd  Some upright advocate might save their victim  Enjoin'd him to employ a servant's hand  There rose indeed a servant at his side  Most eager for the task but O what words  Can speak the fond surprize and thrilling anguish  Which shook the bosom of each sad spectator  Who in that servant saw his lovely wife  The crowd with eyes bedimm'd by starting tears  Of tenderest admiration gaz'd upon her  And murmur'd kindest prayers as they beheld  Connubial love in that angelic form  Thus firmly yielding unexpected succour  To virtue struggling in oppression's toils  BEDFORD  Most excellent of women worthy offspring  Of my departed friend the good Southampton  If Tyranny prevails against thy husband  How shall the wretched Bedford's feeble age  Support thy widow'd heart I can no more  Than in strict fellowship of bitterest sorrow  Echo thy groans and mourn our mutual loss  LADY MARGARET  Do not dear father do not yield so soon  To comfortless despairwe yet may hope  The radiant probity of Russel's life  Will dissipate each dark and dangerous cloud  That perjur'd Calumny can raise around him  Remember all the candor of his mind  Think how his temperate virtues have been prais'd  By Envy's self how to the gaze of youth  His conduct has been held up as a book  In which all English eyes may read their duty  And learn the fairest path to spotless honour  SPENCER  If abject lawyers and a venal jury  Should violate the sanctity of justice  By Russel's condemnation still his merits  Are grav'd so deeply on the Nation's breast  He stands so firm the idol of her love  Oppression's self will fear to execute  The sentence of the prostituted law  Against a life so priz'd  BEDFORD  Alas my friend  When did a tyrant like vindictive York  For 'tis the Duke who thirsts for Russel's blood  When did a spirit of that sullen temper  Impell'd by rancorous hate by bigot rage  And abject terror when did such a spirit  Respect the virtue Nature made its foe  And treacherous Fortune gave it power to crush  But tell me of the scene from whence you come  Say what has been alledg'd against my son  I have been told the fierce and subtle Jefferies  The Duke's base agent in this bloody business  Relies upon the evidence of Howard  As the sure instrument of Russel's death  Unprincipled he is and prone to utter  What interest and fear may bid him swear  What has he said or is he yet unsummon'd  SPENCER  Before I left your son the faithless Howard  Began his artful tale but soon he falter'd  With feign'd affliction of a dread event  Which suddenly was rumour'd through the court  And struck the throng'd assembly with such wonder  Malice stood mute and Persecution paus'd  Fresh from the Tower the tidings came that Essex  From terrors of that bar where Russel stood  Had with rash violence rush'd out of life  And stain'd his desperate hands in his own blood  BEDFORD  It cannot be the firm the gallant Essex  Could never end his being so ignobly  And in the moment when his generous soul  Felt only for his friend his Russel's life  Yet wavering in the balance  SPENCER  Such my lord  Such is the comment of all honest hearts  On this dark storyHeaven reveal the murder  And punish it though in th' assassin's veins  The tainted stream of royal blood may flow  Soon as the rumour reach'd your son he bade me  Attempt to penetrate this dark transaction  And bring you the result of all I heard  Adding that in the instant of his doom  He would dispatch to you the noble Cavendish  With tidings of his sentence  BEDFORD  Ah my friend  The fatal word that ends his blessed life  Has rung already in my tortur'd ear  For I have seen the venal band suborn'd  To purchase by the sacrifice of truth  The blood of her mild champion There's his guilt  'Tis that his pure and patriotic zeal  Guiding the voice of an enlighten'd senate  Has labor'd to preserve the throne of England  From that bloodthirsty bigot at whose feet  Her laws now lie in hasty prostitution  Slaves to a tyrant yet uncrown'd converted  From sacred guards of slander'd innocence  Into base engines of vindictive murder  LADY MARGARET  Alas my father thou hast judg'd too well  Thy dreadful presage is too soon confirm'd  Behold the zealous Cavendish he comes  With no quick step of joyous exultation  But in his agitated gesture shews  A settled sorrow and a fierce despair  Enter  Cavendish  CAVENDISH  I come my lord the wretched messenger  Of that accurst event which my weak judgment  Not reaching the extent of human baseness  Had hastily pronounc'd beyond the line  Of possible injustice All the crimes  That coward Tyranny can wish committed  Shall now have creditRussel is condemn'd  LADY MARGARET  O mockery of justiceRighteous Heaven  Yet interpose to save him  BEDFORD  My kind friend  Thou but relatest what a father's eye  Foresaw too clearly when I view'd the jury  So justly challeng'd by my innocent son  Marshall'd without the warrantry of law  To ensnare his life  CAVENDISH  Eternal infamy  Fall on the base assassins chiefly fall  On those superior ministers of evil  The treacherous guardians of our trampled laws  Who in the robes of Heaven's high delegates  Perform the work of hell from prostrate Justice  Wrest her pure sword to stain it with the blood  Of her most faithful votary  LADY MARGARET  Yet try  Try my dear father ere it prove too late  By urgent intercessions to preserve him  Your friends are many and howe'er inflam'd  By the vile arts of sanguinary York  The king has still a tenderness of heart  That may incline to spare my gentle brother  BEDFORD  Alas my daughter cherish not too much  A hope whose cruel failure will impart  New poignancy to thy too keen affliction  All the mild virtues which to thy pure sense  Plead for thy brother's safety in the ear  Of envious Hate and terrified Oppression  Cry loudly for his death  CAVENDISH  He shall not die  What though the bloodhound Jefferies has fasten'd  His fangs upon him though the barbarous judges  Would make the temple of insulted Law  The slaughterhouse of Tyrannythere yet  Are means to turn the sharpen'd axe aside  And shield the life of their devoted victim  BEDFORD  What would thy dauntless zeal  CAVENDISH  Your gentle son  Has such just credit with this injur'd nation  For public virtue and designs exempt  From every selfish bias of the soul  Thousands would throw into extremest hazard  Their fortunes and their being to preserve  The dying martyr of defenceless freedom  I hold it easy in the very hour  Oppression means to triumph in his blood  With some selected horsemen to o'erpower  The slaves who guard him ere they reach the scaffold  And bear him swiftly to a safe retreat  Applauding millions will assist his rescue  And bless the efforts of his brave deliverers  BEDFORD  No Cavendish by friendship's holy ties  That prompt thy generous purpose I conjure thee  To think of it no farther  CAVENDISH  What my Lord  Shall we look tamely on and by connivance  Be made a party in this legal murder  BEDFORD  Dear ardent friend there are disastrous times  And this is one of them when all the functions  True courage is allow'd to exercise  Are resignation and a brave endurance  My word is given to thy kind thoughtful friend  To check all desperate sallies of affliction  All that the fond intemperance of love  Could hazard for his safety  CAVENDISH  Generous Russel  By Heaven 'tis happier far to share thy death  Than live to see our wretched country robb'd  Of all her hopes in thy unequall'd virtue  BEDFORD  To me much happierto a father's heart  It would be consolation and delight  To perish with his child but there are duties  More painful to sustain than the short struggle  That ends our mortal beingand to us  These duties now belonglet us remember  The trust that he bequeathshis wife his children  'Tis ours to live for them Remember too  His noble answer to the princely Monmouth  Offering to share his prison and his fate  Did he not say it would embitter death  To have his friends die with him  CAVENDISH  O my Lord  Your sorrow is of pure and heavenly temper  Mine the fierce anguish of indignant frenzy  Pray pardon it  BEDFORD  Pardon thee gallant spirit  Thou bright example of exalted friendship  Thou hast my love my fondest admiration  In my just heart thou rankest with my children  And art the pillar now my Russel falls  That my weak age must cling to for support  CAVENDISH  In duty my dear Lord though not in merit  You may account me your's and pitying Heaven  May yet in mercy to a nation's prayers  Spare to your virtuous age your worthier son  I cannot bend my spirit to admit  His fate inevitable gracious Powers  Who watch o'er suffering virtue who inspire  The prosperous deeds of chancedefying friendship  Assist my lab'ring and distracted brain  Whose faculties are on the rack to find  Expedients to preserve our country's pride  The friend and champion of her faith and freedom  From the base stroke of tyrannous revenge  BEDFORD  Vain are those anxious thoughts the vigilant eye  Of keen Oppression will secure her victim  The nerveless arm of childhood could as soon  Wrest from the tiger's gripe his bleeding prey  As we by violence deliver Russel  From the vindictive York  CAVENDISH  after a pause  I thank thee Heaven  The bright idea is I feel from thee  And it has chas'd the darkness of despair  From my o'erclouded mind  BEDFORD  What means thy ardour  CAVENDISH  Good angels have suggested to my soul  A project yet to save him  BEDFORD  Name it name it  CAVENDISH  Your pardon my dear lordaccept alone  This firm assurance that my new design  Has nought of rash exertion to involve  A single life in danger or if one  It must be mine alone and in this crisis  How gladly shall I yield my life for his  And die triumphant in the blest exchange    Exit  LADY MARGARET  Brave CavendishHe's goneYe saints of heaven  If friendship like your own deserves your care  Go ever with him and from all the perils  That wait the noble selfneglecting spirit  Protect him and assist his godlike aim  Preserve this matchless pair of gallant friends  And let them shine the ornament of earth  BEDFORD  Thou pray'st in vain dear childthis dauntless friend  Transcendent as he is in truth and honor  Can nought avail us he must prove the dupe  Of ardent passions and of sanguine virtue  If there's a ray of glimmering hope that yet  May faintly lead us through this night of horror  It cannot rise from any bright endowments  In those we love but rather from the vice  The abject vice that glares in our oppressors  Our tyrants are necessitous and thirst  For gold as keenly as for innocent blood  Kind fortune haply for this great emergence  Has made me master of no common wealth  And this with lucky art distributed  Among the needy minions of the king  May purchase still our Russel's forfeit life  Come my dear child retire we to consult  On this our sole resource Thou wilt not scruple  To meet and to embrace a noble poverty  If thy lost portion can redeem thy brother  LADY MARGARET  Blest be thy happiest thought my tender father  All wealth all good is center'd in his safety  And witness Heaven my heart would freely bear  All the loath'd hardships of the houseless vagrant  And think them blessings if they aught conduc'd  To rescue Russel from a traitor's death  End of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  Lord  and  Lady Russel  in Prison  A Table with Papers Pen and Ink  LADY RUSSEL  MUST I intreat in vainAlas my Russel  Where is thy sweet compliancy of soul  That made till now thy Rachel's voice a stranger  To rude and irksome importunity  Has life so little to engage thy wishes  Thou wilt not ask to live  RUSSEL  Canst thou my love  By so unkind a question canst thou give  Such hard construction to thy Russel's thoughts  Where is there one inhabitant of earth  If not thy husband who has every cause  To cherish his existenceGracious Power  Whose wisdom regulates the lot of mortals  I feel and with devoutest gratitude  Bless thee for signal bounties to thy servant  But most for this thy best and dearest gift  This lovely virtuous woman whom to part with  Is now my hardest trial but from thee  Dread Arbiter of every human scene  However strange to man's contracted sense  This trial comes O strengthen us to bear it  With tender fortitude and meek obedience  LADY RUSSEL  It is our duty still and Heaven enjoins it  To make all blameless efforts to preserve  A life so precious if thy rigid honor  In pity both to me and to thy children  Will stoop to write one line of supplication  To the allpowerful York he will obtain  Thy instant pardon from the pliant king  RUSSEL  Thou knowest not th' inexorable hate  Of that bloodthirsty spiritIt has pleas'd  The author of my life to let the rage  Of ruthless bigotry prevail against it  A band of venal or misguided men  Have doom'd me to the scaffold on the plea  That I have plotted to destroy my sovereign  Though Heaven and thou who knowest all my soul  See the base falshood of the bloody charge  But to the voice of Law however tortur'd  I owe a prompt obedience nought remains  But that I meet the stroke of stern Oppression  As suits the votary of Public Virtue  I must not sully by a base submission  A name yet spotless the sole legacy  It is allow'd me to bequeath my children  LADY RUSSEL  Dear as I hold thy life which is in truth  My only anchor in this sea of troubles  Believe me Russel I would rather yield  Without a struggle yield that precious life  To Persecution's stroke rather than lead  If aught could lead thy clear and resolute virtue  To one base act of weakness and dishonor  RUSSEL  Alas my love the cloud of thy affliction  Has dimm'd thy quick discernment but the paper  Which thy fond care now urges me to write  Would darken all the story of my life  I must not in that story's closing leaf  Where Fortitude should fix the seal of Honor  Mar the fair record with a fearsul blot  LADY RUSSEL  Dear Russel exercise thy purer judgment  These are not scruples of thy manly reason  But niceties of proud fantastic honor  Of honor jealous to a vain excess  How can the measure that my love solicits  Involve thee in disgrace Without abasement  Can injur'd Innocence not say to Power  Give me the life of which Iniquity  Has made thy voice the arbiter  RUSSEL  Thou knowest  Dear inmate of my secret soul kind prompter  Of my best thoughts it has been long the aim  Of my past life to win my country's love  Not by the popular arts of vain ambition  Which Nature never form'd me to possess  But by incessant vigilance to shield  Our faith and freedom by an ardent wish  To prove that patriot virtue the stale jest  Of servile spirits as an empty name  Is an existing vigorous principle  In minds of English temper I have fail'd  In the prime object that my soul pursued  To save our pure religion and our laws  From Bigotry's encroachment and I lose  My life endanger'd by that noble conflict  But I have gain'd and let me still preserve it  The kind esteem of this enlighten'd nation  This I must forfeit forfeit all the praise  And influence of no inglorious life  If I become an abject suppliant  To that fierce zealot from whose iron rod  I strove to shelter this devoted land  LADY RUSSEL  No Russel the corrupted lips of Faction  Are prone to evil but the voice of ages  The sentence of the world is firmly just  And by that sentence thou art sure to stand  High on the list of those bright characters  Immortaliz'd with pure idolatry  By Truth and Freedom men whose very name  Is sweetest music to the ear of Nature  If in a future age when we are dust  Thy virtues can be question'd it must be  By sycophants who flattering royalty  With slanderous surmises would degrade  Each just antagonist of lawless power  Or by those yet more abject enemies  Those sceptics of a cold sarcastic spirit  Who judging from their own contracted hearts  Possess no confidence in human virtue  RUSSEL  Affection overrates thy Russel's merit  But let this fond opinion of his fame  Preclude thy vain request which being granted  Would but afflict thy love Consider well  How it would wound thy generous pride to hear  Thy lord had stain'd the life thou deem'st so glorious  By an ignoble eagerness to live  LADY RUSSEL  Believe me Russel it would wound me more  To think that deaf to all my just entreaties  My husband careless of his orphan children  With sullen dignity threw life away  Rather than stoop to sue for the remission  Of his unrighteous doom  RUSSEL  Alas my love  Should I implicitly pursue the dictates  Of all thy fond solicitude such conduct  Would but provoke the insult of our foes  And could avail thee nothing  LADY RUSSEL  Yes my Russel  Should the relentless York reject thy prayer  In those sad years of bitterness and anguish  When if the will of Heaven is fix'd to part us  My widow'd soul with unabating sorrow  Must dwell upon thy image and for ever  Repass in thought these agonizing scenes  It will afford me then a faint relief  To think my active love in this distress  Omitted nothing that had duty's sanction  To snatch thee from the scaffold  RUSSEL  Lovely suppliant  Thy virtuous tenderness has melted me  And though I could not purchase it by guilt  Thy peace is dearer to my heart than glory  Thou shalt not say thy Russel e'er refus'd  One prayer of thinegive me again the pen  My weak disdain rejected    Russel writes  LADY RUSSEL  Bless thy kindness  Bless thy prevailing love for I perceive  How hardly it has struggled to obtain  This triumph over brave indignant pride  Abhorring e'en the shadow of disgrace  O thou allpowerful Spirit who canst make  The meanest implements of mortal use  Thy ministers of safety or destruction  Grant that this lovedirected pen may prove  An instrument of gracious preservation  Guide thou my Russel's handinto this paper  Pour words of heavenly potency to change  The bloody wish of blinded Superstition  And melt vindictive Rancour into mercy  Enter  Spencer  LADY RUSSEL  Kind Spencer opportunely art thou come  To chear my Russel's solitary hour  While my keen hopes to win by supplication  From potent York the pardon of my Lord  Force me to leave him  SPENCER  Ill befall the heart  That melts not at the voice of such a suppliant  RUSSEL  Good Spencer thanks to that unwearied zeal  Which makes thee frequent in thy welcome visits  To a poor captiveThere my anxious Love  Take what thy truth and tenderness have forc'd  From Russel's frail and yielding resolution  His pliancy I know will meet with blame  But those who have a heart to feel thy merits  Will blush at their quick censure and recall it  LADY RUSSEL  Now let me Russel from thy prison fly  Like the exploring dove whose eager wing  Flew from the ark to visit it again  With blest assurance of subsiding storms    Exit  RUSSEL  My worthy kinsman when my voice is silenc'd  As soon it will be witness to the world  The tender virtues and connubial love  Of that angelic womanAnd I pray  As gentleness and honor have endear'd thee  To all our house do thou my faithful Spencer  Attend with pitying care my wife and father  On the dread day that ends our mortal union  Watch them with all the vigilance of friendship  And soothe the recent anguish of their grief  SPENCER  Heaven yet my Lord may save us from that scene  Of private woe and national distress  RUSSEL  Believe me though I stoop to ask for life  I ask not thinking to obtain my suit  But from the tender wish to mitigate  The future sufferings of a faithful mourner  By this compliance with her fondest prayer  SPENCER  The touching eloquence of her affliction  Join'd to the memory of her father's merit  That honor'd servant of the Crown Southampton  May wrest your pardon from the savage heart  Of sullen York  RUSSEL  Impossible my friend  My life's the prey that his infatiate rage  Has keenly chas'dhe holds it in his toils  And every prospect of escape is clos'd  SPENCER  Yet think my Lord that other means of safety  RUSSEL  No Spencer I have thought I trust not vainly  Of the chief object that my mind must dwell on  How to sustain the trying part to which  The will of Heaven appoints me how to meet  The sudden stroke of ignominious death  As may become the man whose life has won  From this brave land observance and regard  O Spencer when the wearied eye surveys  The gloomy face of Earth the Law's abuse  And Freedom sinking under savage Power  The wreck of Public Virtue the base arts  And treachery of her apostate sons  With all the countless ills that in her train  A blind and barbarous Superstition brings  When these are present to the guiltless mind  It seems a fair and blessed fate to fly  From this dark den of misery and vice  To the bright presence of divine Perfection  SPENCER  Yet of how pure a nature are those blessings  This earth would furnish to your rescued virtue  RUSSEL  O gentle kinsman in my softer hours  My heart still clings to those attractive objects  Of tenderest attachment for this heart  Was fram'd by nature for the sweet enjoyment  Of social duties and domestic bliss  I will avow to thee for thy mild spirit  Can sympathize in every true distress  That when I think to what excess of anguish  I leave the worthiest and most tender wife  That with endearing innocence and love  E'er blest a husband the forbidden tear  Starts from my heart perforce my frame is chill'd  And shudders at the sharp divorce of steel  So soon to fall upon our chaste affection  SPENCER  Yet may ye live a blessing to each other  And give a bright example to mankind  That happiness abides with virtuous love  Life stands within your choicethe King who knows  With what a fond respect and confidence  The generous people lean to the opinion  Of men so rooted in their hearts as you are  Courts your acceptance of immediate pardon  If you will but acknowledge in his presence  That you believe no subject has a right  However tempted to resist the Throne  RUSSEL  Have any of my friends suppos'd that Russel  Could buy existence at a price like this  SPENCER  The worthy churchmen who in this vile prison  Have been your kind assiduous attendants  Build on this ground strong hopesthey have obtain'd  The sanction of your venerable father  To argue with you this important question  Believing they may lead your candid mind  To terms which in their cool considerate judgment  Have the clear warrantry of truth and reason  RUSSEL  Good men they are an honor to the church  For signal harmony of faith and practice  But haply cramp'd by piety's nice scruples  Their minds have not expanded to embrace  The mighty cause of FreedomO my friend  I want the spiritstirring faculty  Of eloquence to range in bright array  The potent claims of Nature and enlist  In her pure service all the noble passions  That give distinction to the life of man  But gracious Heaven endow'd me with a heart  To act the upright virtuous citizen  And meet the axe much rather than betray  The charter'd rights of this my native land  SPENCER  Are you my Lord so settled in your thoughts  On this nice question that no arguments  May shake the airy fabric of opinion  RUSSEL  Good Spencer thou hast known me many years  And for a man of plain and simple reason  Which clearly tells me that the King's position  Once granted sinks the freeborn sons of England  To the tame vassals of a Turkish despot  My mind can frame no image of a state  That laws have limited without a right  To guard those limitations and my conscience  That higher sovereign who challenges  My first obedience in all points of moment  Will not permit me by a different language  To purchase life from the deluded King  SPENCER  With painful admiration I have heard  The steady dictates of your patriot virtue  That will with mingled agony and joy  Confirm the presage of your noble father  Howe'er he listens with attentive fondness  To all that friendly zeal suggests to save you  He knows and glories in your firm adherence  To the dear rights of England nor can wish  Though with the sanction of such friends to see you  Exchange it for the lure of forfeit life  RUSSEL  Although I trust he fully knows that mind  Which his fond cares have strengthen'd and enrich'd  With its best powers of manly resolution  Yet as illgrounded and distressing doubts  Are natural infirmities of age  At times perchance my venerable father  May fear lest the approach of violent death  Should with disgraceful pliancy infect  The spirit of his sonI therefore pray thee  Return assure him that our pious friends  Must lose their wellmeant labor in debate  My mind's unchangeable and gracious Heaven  As my dark fate draws nearer gives my soul  New strength to triumph o'er its shadowy terrors  Assure the tender Bedford I shall meet  The hour of execution as his love  Must wish with that sedate and chearful brow  Which suits the guiltless son of such a father  SPENCER  My Lord I will religiously obey you  And on the instant as I now perceive  Your chief heartchosen friend is come to share  The private converse of your precious hours    Exit  Enter  CAVENDISH  RUSSEL  Welcome dear Cavendish my eager heart  Has panted for thy presence keenly wishing  To rest the burthen of its cares on thee  Yet ere I cease to live O let me take  One long farewell of him whose friendship gave  Lustre and value to that life which fate  Severely calls me to resign  CAVENDISH  Which Love  And Friendship's voice command thee to preserve  I come to save thee Russel nor must lose  One moment in the heavensuggested plan  RUSSEL  Dear sanguine friend the fond illusive warmth  Of thy kind heart invests thy eager fancy  With visionary power  CAVENDISH  The fiends of hell  Shall not defeat the project my good angel  Inspires for thy protectionSwear thou first  By our inviolate friendship and by ties  Yet stronger on thy heart thy wife and children  Swear thou wilt grant me one request  RUSSEL  Dear Cavendish  Thou wouldst engage me in some hasty business  Pregnant with danger to thy generous self  Else had thy frank affection ne'er devis'd  A bond so needless to the mind which holds  Requests from thee as sacred as the laws  Of faith and honorbut explain thy purpose  CAVENDISH  Here in this happy hour of privacy  Let us exchange our habits so may'st thou  Muffling thy face as in the veil of sorrow  Pass unsuspected and elude the guard  Two of our trusty friends are plac'd to meet thee  And all the means of thy escape concerted  Haste I conjure thee while I here remain  Wrapt in thy mourning garb but with a spirit  Ready to burst into triumphant joy  And mock the baffled malice of thy foes  RUSSEL  Brave Cavendish 'tis hard to quit a world  That furnishes such friends yet easier this  Than by a hasty flight from death to hazard  A life I hold still dearer than my own  No I can ne'er expose thy generous virtue  To that base fate thou urgest me to shun  CAVENDISH  They dare not strike at me their venal juries  Have past no treacherous verdict on my head  RUSSEL  The eminence of thy exalted virtue  Would make thee their sure victim and perchance  The latent ruffians such I think there are  Who robb'd the injur'd world of gallant Essex  Would double in the mind of their base master  Their murd'rous merits by dispatching thee  CAVENDISH  There is no peril but admit the worst  I want not strength to grapple with such villains  And wear a dagger here to punish them  RUSSEL  Friend of my inmost soul thy generous offer  Yet closer draws those honorable bands  That in our mortal pilgrimage have bound us  Firm to each other and defying death  Will prove to us I trust in brighter scenes  A lasting unextinguishable source  Of pure ambition and angelic joy  But the kind purpose of thy noble zeal  Thy Russel must reject Granting thy plan  Free from all perils to thy precious life  And it abounds with many most alarming  Flight howsoe'er effected would produce  Dishonor to thy friend as wanting trust  In spotless innocence or manly courage  CAVENDISH  The tongue of Slander dares not to impeach  Thy fortitude  RUSSEL  Yet more for I will lay  My secret soul before theeThou hast seen  How far thy friendship and my Rachel's love  Have power to make life lovely in my sight  And my kind father whose declining age  But I must pause and check this natural burst  Of tender gratitudeThou fully knowest  All the strong ties that chain my heart to earth  Yet I perceive these adamantine links  Touch'd without doubt by heavenly influence  Seem to give way and my aspiring soul  Begins to covet that ignoble fate  Which shews so horrible in vulgar eyes  CAVENDISH  And canst thou wish to leave us  RUSSEL  O my friend  Among the strongest passions of my heart  Perhaps more forcible than love and friendship  From childhood I have cherish'd an attachment  To my brave countrythough a transient cloud  Now hovers o'er her my prophetic eyes  Perceive that she is destin'd to emerge  To happiness and glory Thou shalt live  Dear noble friend to view and to assist  This blest eventThe death I am to suffer  Will more contribute than my life could do  To England's welfarein the future fabric  Destin'd to save and to perpetuate  The sapp'd foundations of her faith and freedom  My blood may prove a cement this idea  Sustains inspirits and delights my soul  CAVENDISH  Heroic Russel bright and genuine martyr  Of Liberty and Truth if thou must perish  I yet shall wear engraven on my heart  The radiant image of thy signal virtues  As a pure charm of potency to guard  The lowliest mind from every servile thought  Hark sure I heard the hated voice of York  Dares he insult imprison'd innocence  By venturing to approach it May we not  Move farther off from that detested sound  It shakes my tortur'd brain and almost tempts me  To rush at once and from the coward breast  Of that apostate tear th' envenom'd heart  That guides the murd'rous axe against my Russel  RUSSEL  Patience dear ardent spiritCome this way  The adjoining chamber is allotted me  For privacy and prayer Come to receive  The benediction of thy dying friend    Exeunt  Enter  York  with the  Lieutenant  of the Tower  YORK  I know some proud abettors of his guilt  Are plotting his escape but mark Lieutenant  If the convicted traitor in your charge  Appear not on his summons to the scaffold  Your life shall answer it  LIEUTENANT  I trust

princely York  To Russel's prison At your feet I fall  In my dear Lord's behalf who in this paper  Implores your intercession with the King  To save an innocent and injur'd subject  YORK  Rise MadamTell your Lord that I forgive him  His bold seditious practices to bar  My just succession to the English throne  But my allegiance and fraternal duty  Forbid me to appear the advocate  Of one whose life is forfeit to the law  For plotting to destroy my royal brother  In pity to your sufferings I advise you  To waste no fruitless labor in opposing  That stroke of justice which we all lament  But which the safety of the realm requires    Exit  LADY RUSSEL  Thou ruthless hypocrite thy sullen cruelty  Converts the swelling tear of supplication  To fiery scorn and my prophetic spirit  Foresees an hour in which thy abject soul  With more than womanish terror shall implore  That succour thy hard heart denies to me  LIEUTENANT  O Lady thy unmerited afflictions  Have seiz'd a stranger's bosom and impel me  To make some effort to assist thy prayers  The Duke is merciless and thirsts for blood  But pity harbours in our Sovereign's heart  I know this very morning he has utter'd  Words of kind import to your injur'd Lord  If in some happy minute you could throw  Your sorrows at his feet they must prevail  He still is in the precincts of the Tower  Wait here some moments and kind Heaven may teach me  To draw him this way yet ere he rejoins  His pestilent counsellor the cruel Duke    Exit  LADY RUSSEL  The blessings of my grateful heart go with thee  Good angels second the unlook'dfor pity  Of this brave soldier Grant me power to speak  My Russel's wrongs to the misguided King  And thou blest spirit of my virtuous father  Whose matchless services so

thy clemency  Enter the  King  KING  Rise lovely mournerbe assur'd I pity  Your virtuous sufferings and sincerely mourn  Those hard necessities of state whose force  O'errules the milder wishes of my mind  To spare the precious life for which you kneel  LADY RUSSEL  If the bright cherub Mercy has inspir'd  Your royal bosom with a wish to save him  O let no subtle fiend with base suggestion  Subdue that heavenly impulsene'er was monarch  More loudly call'd by Equity and Truth  To the exertion of his noblest power  The privilege to spareSo may my soul  Find grace before the judgmentseat of Heaven  As it is sure my Russel never harbour'd  A single thought of blood or aught of evil  Against the life and welfare of his King  Nay more my Liege I know his gentle virtue  Has often join'd in painful fellowship  With bold bad men whom his pure heart abhorr'd  To lead your child the young and princely Monmouth  From the dark paths of their pernicious counsel  KING  Your Lord is happy in an advocate  Of most persuasive powers I wish but dare not  To stop the course of the offended law  Against the man for whom your tender virtues  Plead with such fervencymy kingdom's peace  Demands the dread completion of his sentence  His rescu'd life would lead triumphant Faction  To practices more daring and distract  The agitated realm with civil broils  LADY RUSSEL  Alas you little know the gentle spirit  Of my wrong'd Lord But if his life is held  So hazardous to England's peace my Liege  O let him pass the remnant of his days  Far from this troubled islehis wife and children  Will guide th' obedient exile where you order  And if a desert yields him life and safety  Think paradise is there  KING  You touch my soul  Fair suppliantLet them blame my pliant weakness  I am not marble and must

coast  Of France or Holland as our will directs  Lady you little know what cruel bars  Obstruct the willing step of royal mercy  Kings are forc'd often to do good by stealth  And such is now my curseBut let your father  Make preparations for a secret flight  And wait our pleasure with the prisoner here  Ere night he shall receive our terms of pardon  And with them an express though private order  For the enlargement of your captive Lord  LADY RUSSEL  May the great Fountain of beneficence  The King of kings reward my gracious master  For this kind promise to his grateful servant  O my good Liege let but your own mild spirit  Be your prime counsellor to shut your ear  Against the subtleties of cruel zealots  Tranquillity shall bless your safe dominion  And loyalty and love support your throne  But let me fly to my deliver'd Russel  With these most happy tidings of your bounty  And in reiterated prayers to Heaven  For every good on my indulgent Sovereign  Pour forth the fullness of my swelling heart    Exit  KING  How touching is her love I envy Russel  Th' angelic tenderness of that chaste woman  Enter  York  YORK  What has the whining wife of guilty Russel  Pester'd your ear my brother with vain tales  To vouch the truth of that convicted traitor  Whose death must now be speedy to secure  Your kingdom's quiet and your person's safety  KING  Brother your Romish friends incline too much  To sanguinary counselsI abhor them  What if in pity to a virtuous woman  In kind remembrance of her father's merits  Friend of our exil'd youth and best support  Of our recover'd throne what if I grant  Some little mercy to her urgent prayer  And change her husband's death to banishment  YORK  By Heaven it must not be  what  when the Law  That faithful guardian of your sacred life  Has past its sentence on your prostrate foe  For base conspiracy and bloody treason  False to yourself shall you in weak compassion  To an insinuating woman's tears  Thus rescue and empower Rebellion's idol  To form a second more successful plot  KING  Your hasty fear outruns true policy  And this excess of rigor which your priests  Have taught you bodes I think but little good  Both to your power and mineYou when you chuse  May visit Rome I brother am too old  To enter once again on foreign travels  YORK  Nor may we suffer you to fall at home  Through careless indolence by Treason's dagger  Think not I speak from ancient enmity  To this insidious Russel for myself  He has my pardon for his crimes to me  But the regard I owe your hallow'd person  Leads me to press for his immediate death  Before the house that bears his father's name  The house that hid his bloody machinations  I wish to see the murd'rous rebel die  But let us haste from hence I will assemble  The members of your council most instructed  In this base treasonthey will clearly prove  You have but this alternative to chuse  To execute or perishOne must fall  The traiterous convict or the injur'd King  End of ACT II  ACT III  SCENE I  Lord  Russel  writing and attended by  Spencer  SPENCER  QUIT my dear Lord your mournful preparation  For that unworthy fate which your blest consort  Here fully prov'd our good and guardian angel  Has happily averted  RUSSEL  When a life  Hangs my good Spencer on a prince's word  Whose resolution is the plaint slave  Of artifice and importunity  Reason disdains to take into account  A poor possession held on such a tenure  I can believe the King inclines to save me  But know how soon his unresisting spirit  Yields to the voice of that vindictive zeal  Which with incessant and increasing fury  Now clamours for my bloodI therefore hold it  The part of prudence to leave nought undone  Which on a sudden summons to the block  I yet might wish but want the time to do  SPENCER  Useless though noble may this caution prove  RUSSEL  Be that as Heaven thinks bestSince busy Rumour  In his blind haste to catch a fleeting image  Is apt to form a faithless portraiture  Of public characters I here my friend  Have as a legacy bequeath'd the world  A true though simple picture of myself  When I am gone my honest countrymen  Reading this paper may with confidence  Say Such was Russelthis account of him  Being as clear from falshood and disguise  As that which in his hour of heavenly audit  Must prove the ground of his eternal doom  Here is my latest task peruse this letter  Which on my death the King is to receive  SPENCER  It breathes that gentle magnanimity  For which your life is noted  RUSSEL  At the time  The solemn time when the calm soul prepares  For quick departure to that world of peace  Where enmity and anger cannot dwell  'Tis surely right to close our earthly feuds  And part from all men in pure charity  Though I have never sinn'd against my sovereign  By any deed or thought that meant him ill  In many vain and inconsiderate hours  I yet have sported with his name and frailties  So idly that I hold it decent now  To crave his pardon for such levities  And in the gentlest language I can use  To intimate that dying thus unjustly  I pardon all promoters of my death  The highest as the lowest  SPENCER  Cease my Lord  To dwell on dying thoughts With eyes that speak  Of life and comfort your deliverer  Comes to restore you to domestic bliss  Enter  Lady Russel  LADY RUSSEL  All my dear rescued Love all is prepar'd  To aid your blest removal from this land  Of danger and dissentionTo your sight  Exile shall seem a kind familiar friend  Conducting you to safety and delight  You shall not feel you have a foreign home  For all your house who live but in your presence  Are fix'd to travel with usthe kind Bedford  Will to the rough sea trust his feeble age  For your society O had you seen  How our dear little ones receiv'd the tidings  Of this hearthealing voyage how they pant  To throw their eager fondling arms around you  And welcome you again to life and joy  Enter  Bedford  BEDFORD  Pride of my soul my dear recover'd son  Again I view thee with parental transport  Snatch'd from the broken snares of shameful death  By this blest handIn vain thy suppliant father  Had offer'd to exchange his envied treasures  For that superior wealth which in his heart  Outweighs all opulencesullen Revenge  Subduing Avarice with scorn rejected  Thy proffer'd ransom Blank despair had seiz'd me  But in the hour when human efforts fail'd  This pitying seraph in a woman's form  Brings heavenly aid and turns a tyrant's heart  To bless the trembling world with Russel's life  RUSSEL  Dear objects of my love I pray you check  This eagerness of joy for O I feel  That it must prove to you the treacherous herald  Of heavier griefyour kind exulting hope  Is a brief day of summer out of season  That promising to end stern winter's tyranny  Does but supply to his suspended breath  The power to pierce more deeplypray be caution'd  And with just foresight arm yourselves against  The certain rigor of th' inclement time  BEDFORD  Has not the King relented and engag'd  His royal word to save and set thee free  RUSSEL  Alas my father had his word possess'd  That stedfast sanctity which should belong  To the pure breath of princes this fair isle  Who trusted in his faith had never known  Her present depth of national disgrace  Have we not seen our sovereign's promises  Proverbially invalidHere comes one  Whose message will I doubt not end the question  Enter an  Officer  who beckons  Russel  and speaks to him aside  BEDFORD  O my dear daughter the high flood of hope  Sinks in my heart and leaves a hideous void  LADY RUSSEL  Speak speak my Russel is it life or death  RUSSEL  Patience sweet suffererPray inform the sheriff  Although this short and peremptory summons  Savours of cruel haste he shall not wait    Exit  Officer  RUSSEL  Ye whose keen sorrow has more power to shake  The heart of Russel than th' impending axe  By our pure love let me conjure ye now  To reconcile your griefdistemper'd thoughts  To Heaven's dread pleasure who for some high purpose  Permits the oppressive doom of innocence  The King has signified he cannot save me  And I must die today  LADY RUSSEL  Perfidious cruelty  But I will fly and by my loud complaint  Waking dead Honor in his wither'd mind  Force from the treacherous King his promis'd mercy    Exit  BEDFORD  I yet will make one hopeless effort more  To stop the vengeance of insatiate York    Exit  RUSSEL  Go ye kind beings for the busy love  That finds employment though in fruitless labor  Lightens the pressure of the grief it bears  Thou seest good Spencer that my tender wife  Is now supported by her zeal to save me  But on my death the quickness of her spirit  Will work like latent fire within her heart  A slow consumer of her wasting frame  It is her fate that wounds mefor my own  Is but the shortest and most easy passage  From earthly trouble to celestial joy  It is the fancy of the vulgar mind  That foolishly arrays the dreaded form  Of sudden death in visionary horrors  Believe me Spencer in the month just past  The transient sickness of my lovely boy  Press'd harder on my heart and more disturb'd  The native calmness of my even spirit  Than my near prospect of the ready scaffold  SPENCER  Yet my dear Lord I view with awful wonder  The firm serenity of soul you shew  On this hard test of human fortitude  RUSSEL  Reflect my friend that my imprisonment  Has made the fearful image of my fate  Familiar to my thought It is surprize  That gives to Death his most appalling power  To the clear eye of guiltless Contemplation  That gloomy spectre grows a gorgeous herald  Whose trumpet sounds the triumph of the soul  And speaks its entrance on the stage of glory  How grand how pregnant with delight and wonder  Must be the change of scene from earth to heaven  What if a mortal who had pass'd his days  In the dim cavern of a noxious mine  Worn with hard toil where healthannoying vapours  Vext and confounded his imperfect sense  If such a mortal suddenly were laid  On the bright summit of a lofty hill  To taste the balmy sweetness of the morn  And for the first time see the rising sun  Array this fair and smiling earth in all  The radiant loveliness of form and colour  O Spencer if I felt for self alone  This period deem'd the saddest of my life  Could only fill my mind with heavenly joy  But for my mourning friends and most for her  Whose faithful love has many years to weep  My falt'ring heartnow give it strength good Heaven  For even now its hardest trial comes  My Rachel in the anguish of despair  Returns to take a long and last farewell  Enter  Lady Russel  LADY RUSSEL  Dear Russel I renounce illusive hope  And now must teach my weakness to sustain  The heaviest load of misery that ever  Fell on the bleeding heart of helpless woman  The King denies thee what the basest felon  Asks not in vain the respite of a day  Could'st thou believe it he and savage York  Are now like bloodhounds come to hunt thee hence  And drive thee to thy death they but allow me  A few short minutes in a last embrace  To clasp to bless and part with thee for ever  RUSSEL  Then may we part as we have liv'd my Rachel  In the pure dignity of perfect love  Unstain'd by weakness  LADY RUSSEL  Do not dread my tears  They cannot fall to melt thy manly firmness  For Heaven has steel'd me for this awful hour  RUSSEL  Thou dear angelic spirit 'tis from thee  That I have learnt the truest fortitude  A courage built upon a heavenly basis  O gracious Being who has guided us  Through fourteen years of pure domestic bliss  The best and rarest of thy gifts to man  Accept as tribute for thy blessings past  Our meek submission in this trying hour  Of thy more dreadful pleasureat thy call  I yield my guiltless life nor would decline  To die for having struggled to preserve  Thy purest worship in my native land  O that my blood might quench that fatal torch  Of barbarous Superstition which begins  To shed once more its sanguinary glare  Over this frighted isle Might Russel prove  The last to perish by oppressive power  And the base sentence of perverted law  Fall not my blood on the misguided men  Whose fury sheds itAs I truly pardon  My ruthless enemies so Heaven may'st thou  Take to the charge of thy hearthealing mercy  This my chief care this dearest last concern  Of my departing soul this spotless woman  LADY RUSSEL  Let not thy fears for me my generous Russel  Too fondly agitate thy feeling mind  The gracious Power who blest us in each other  Will not I know abandon utterly  An unoffending weak afflicted woman  Dear to so pure a spirit sanctified  By the kind prayers of an expiring martyr  RUSSEL  My Love I will not to thy care commend  Thy little orphans for an angel's sight  Cannot in tender vigilance surpass  The anxious mother who survives to shield  The infant pledges of our chaste affection  No let me press a charge upon thy memory  Where I most fear thy failure thy dear self  Regard thy precious health as the possession  That I enjoin thee to preserve and cherish  LADY RUSSEL  Thou guide and guardian of thy Rachel's life  Though the dark grave must hide thee from my eyes  Thy gentleness thy love thy truth thy virtues  Will still like faithful and protecting spirits  Be ever present to my thought and give  My griefdejected mind new power to rear  The little idols of my widow'd heart  RUSSEL  They will have all that youth requires in thee  The gentle friend the fond yet firm director  Whose steady kindness and rever'd perfection  Makes discipline delight their minds from thine  May copy all the virtues chiefly two  Of prime distinction Truth and Fortitude  The pillars of all human excellence  I bless thee now for many years of fondness  But most for that sublimity of love  Which has disdain'd to make my fate more bitter  By abject vain complaints and weak'ning tears  LADY RUSSEL  Refrain I pray you from this tender praise  It will o'erthrow the firmness you commend  And 'waken all the woman in my bosom  RUSSEL  Dear Rachel as my boy approaches manhood  Teach him to look upon his father's death  Rather as noble than unfortunate  Tell him that dying by no just decree  I deem'd it still a happiness that Heaven  Made me a native of this generous isle  Which though now darken'd by a transient cloud  Is doom'd I trust to be the radiant throne  Of settled Liberty and stedfast Faith  Early infuse into his youthful spirit  As the sure groundwork of all manly virtue  A sense of civil and religious freedom  Give to his pliant mind true English temper  Teach him to fear no Being but his God  And to love nothing earthly more than England  Enter an  Attendant  ATTENDANT  My Lord the officers  RUSSEL  They shall not wait  LADY RUSSEL  Inhuman hasteDo thou great God proportion  The patience of thy servants in distress  To the infernal malice of their foes  Since thy unquestionable will permits  Such innocence to perish on the scaffold  Send the most soothing of thy heavenly spirits  To wait unseen upon the dying martyr  Take from this hideous form of Violent Death  His horrible attendants Pain and Anguish  RUSSEL  O my kind Love that quick undreaded stroke  So soon to sever this frail mortal frame  Is but a feather's printless touch compar'd  To this my deepest wound which now I feel  In tearing thus my faithful heart from thine  Each moment that we linger but increases  Our mutual pangs then take in this embrace  My latest benediction  LADY RUSSEL  O farewell  RUSSEL  Yet a last kissand for our little ones  Bear thou to each this legacy of love  Now we must partFarewell  LADY RUSSEL  Farewell for ever    Exit  Lady Russel  RUSSEL  Spencer the bitterness of death is past  And thou hast nothing more to fear for Russel  Then quit him thou kind friend and be thy care  Devoted to the precious charge he leaves  I pray attend that dear unhappy mourner  Place her within my gentle sister's arms  And soothe their mutual sorrowTell my father  I should have wish'd to clasp his hand once more  But that I fear'd to shock his feeble age  SPENCER  Grief my dear Lord denies me utterance  Of all that I would sayFarewell my tears  And prompt obedience will I trust to you  Though mute interpreters explain my heart  RUSSEL  Yet stopThy Russel has now done with time  That heavy load to foolish Indolence  But active Probity's prolific treasure  Take then this small memorial of esteem  This little index of the passing hours  For thou hast wisdom to improve their value  And I am entering on eternity    Giving his watch to  Spencer  Stay not for thanks follow thy weeping charge  Hasten to her support and Heaven reward thee    Exit  Spencer  RUSSEL  kneeling  Thou only perfect and unfailing Source  Of all serenity all strength all power  In thy frail suppliant man thou gracious God  I bless thy mercy which in bitterest anguish  Has fortified my soul and now dispels  All fearful hurry from my even thoughts  O comfort thou those kind and tender beings  To whom my death must prove a lasting wound  Grant me to pass my little residue  Of closing life with chearful constancy  And take my willing spirit to thy bosom  Enter  Cavendish  CAVENDISH  Allow me thou blest martyr once again  To press thy hand to bathe it with my tears  And in this agony of greedy sorrow  Catch from thy lips the last command of friendship  RUSSEL  My faithful Cavendish I have but one  One wish to utter that relates to earth  And to thy truth I trust for its completion  Dying I charge thee by the love thou bearest  To Russel's honor and our country's welfare  Quell in the hearts of all who may lament me  The frantic passion to revenge my death  Wilt thou be mindful of this last injunction

years  Held a prime place within thy noble bosom  And studied all its rich and rare perfections  The radiant virtues in fair order marshall'd  Beneath the guidance of presiding honor  I've seen thee full of high and glorious thoughts  Towards this world but pardon if I say  That thy brave mind to me has seem'd to fail  In homage to the sovereignty of Heaven  CAVENDISH  Thou godlike monitor in such a moment  To feel for my offences  RUSSEL  Do not wonder  At the calm temper of thy dying friend  Use thy own spotless and exalted spirit  To commune more with Heaven and thou wilt find  The blessed habit of considering  That we are acting in our Maker's eye  Arms the unshrinking soul for every scene  Weigh well the powers of simple piety  Make it the keystone in thy arch of virtue  And

less than mineby all thy trembling hopes  Of future greatness and secure dominion  Haste thou to snatch him from impending fate  If in these moments of extreme despair  Thy pity saves my son thou wilt appear  As the bright delegate of heavenly mercy    The fifes sound  YORK  Away the sound thou hearest is a signal  That the just rigor of the law has fallen  Upon his finish'd life  BEDFORD  O my lost child  But he is happy in the fellowship  Of saints who to his higher purity  Pay blessed homagehis deliver'd spirit  Gives a new impulse to my lifeless heart  His sufferings all are ended but this hour  Which sees them close for thee relentless York  Beholds a train of dark calamities  The spreading offspring of thy cruelty  Rise into being  YORK  Go retire old man  And heal thy shatter'd mind I have not leisure  To hear the ravings of distracted age    Exit  York  with the  Officer  BEDFORD  'Tis not the frenzy of a weak old man  That now proclaims thy fate inhuman bigot  Rushing through guiltless blood to thy destruction  It is the spirit of my angel son  He for a moment leaves the heavenly choir  Whose ready harps shall usher him to glory  To drown a father's anguish in this vision  Of soulpossessing prescienceyes 'tis he  Who now presents to my astonish'd eye  These crowding imagesI see thee now  Insatiate York invested with that crown  For which thy barbarous ambition panted  I see it fall from thy unkingly head  Shaking with fear's vile palsyin thy terror  I see thee sue imperious abject spirit  To the insulted Bedford but in vain  Thy power that highest trust of Heaven abus'd  Passes from thee The cruel bloodstain'd tyrant  Wanders a wretched exile This wrong'd island  Emerges from the darkness of Oppression  Hail scenes of triumph to all English hearts  Hail thou bright festival of settled Freedom  I see and bless thy firm establishment  And hark the justice of a patriot king  Uniting with a grateful nation's voice  Turns the base sentence of my murder'd

 BEDFORD  And thou canst tell me dying he appear'd  E'en as he liv'd a model to mankind  CAVENDISH  Never did martyr with more lovely grace  Part from a world unworthy to possess him  To the surrounding crowd he mildly spoke  A few short words of pardon to his foes  With fervent benediction to his country  Commending to the hearts of all who heard him  A love of peace and purified religion  Then with a chearful readiness invited  The stroke of death I saw the unhappy man  Who with a trembling arm lifted the axe  O'er his unshaken victim in his tremor  Measuring the neck to strike his even blow  I saw him raze the skin and in that moment  The cheek of Russel held its native hue  Unblanc'd with fearit was a sight to turn  The grief of friendship to idolatry  And your paternal sorrow into pride  BEDFORD  Dear Cavendish I will not wound his spirit  His gallant spirit by unmanly mourning  No I have pride such pride as Heaven approves  Nor would I now exchange my murder'd Russel  For any living son in Christendom  CAVENDISH  Bless this fond firmness of the English father  It penetrates and chears my aching heart  Come my dear Lord let us retire from hence  To soothe yet fonder sorrow weeping now  In scenes which he has hallow'd by his care  In his past days of social happiness  There let us sit and still with sad delight  Talk o'er his numerous virtues they shall be  The theme of every tongue and ages hence  Still fix the love of every English spirit  Then if the voice of Learning would compare  What rich Antiquity and Modern Time  Have seen of public virtue while the hand  Of Glory justly in her balance throws  The gather'd worthies of the Pagan world  England shall boast her own superior wealth  And poise the rival scale with Russel's name  THE MAUSOLEUM A COMEDY OF THREE ACTS IN RHYME  Persons of the Drama  CAREY  JASPER  RUMBLE  FACIL  TROPE  GERRARD the Butler  LADY SOPHIA SENTIMENT Widow of SIR SIMON SENTIMENT a wealthy Merchant  FRANCES Sister to Jasper and a Relation of the deceased SIR SIMON  MRS RUMBLE  SERVANTS  c  SCENE  the magnificent Villa of  LADY SOPHIA  THE MAUSOLEUM  ACT I  SCENE I  Carey  and  Frances  FRANCES  PRAY temper with patience your warm indignation  And treat with more mercy my tender relation  Because with your passions her whims interfere  To her foibles dear Carey you're grossly severe  CAREY  My patience sweet Frances I own is exhausted  She will wed the first suitor by whom she's accosted  Though in widowhood's dainty vagaries her pride  Forbids her fair cousin to shine as a bride  And keeps us my Love from that altar away  Where Hymen with justiceupbraids our delay  But in noble contempt of your unsettled dower  Let us seize on the bliss that is plac'd in our power  And if such artful vanities yield her relief  Leave my Lady to play off fresh fountains of grief  While we my sweet girl pass our happier youth  In delights that are hallow'd by Nature and Truth  Though my income is small with your prudent direction  Dear Fanny  FRANCES  I'm pleas'd with this proof of affection  Yet before we our union dear Carey complete  As your love is so ardentlet mine be discreet  No honest return of regard should I feel  Could I suffer your heart in its generous zeal  To abandon a portion your bride should obtain  And hazard by hurry what patience will gain  'Tis unlucky my cousin Sir Simon forgot  To specify what he design'd as my lot  But I know this omission by which I am left  At her Ladyship's mercy of fortune bereft  Was the work of Old Vellum whose foresight and skill  Were employ'd for himself when he made the Knight's will  Yet her Ladyship says that my cousin told her  The sum that he meant upon me to confer  And though she delays from a delicate whim  Lest our marriage should seem disrespectful to him  CAREY  Good God my dear Fanny how can you defend her  To refinement and faith she's an empty pretender  Have not twelve months elaps'd from Sir Simon's interment  Yet her sorrow still bubbles in ludicrous ferment  Though the farce of her grief as our friends have all said  Is address'd to the living much more than the dead  And her vanity means though she prizes not pelf  To keep you unmarried and marry herself  FRANCES  Indeed you mistake all her harmless intentions  She will certainly give me the fortune she mentions  I know her kind heart and its pure inclination  CAREY  Say rather we know her absurd affectation  And as for your portion my dear I as soon  Shall expect an estate to drop out of the moon  As to see you receive from my Lady a shilling  Allowing indeed that her heart may be willing  She soon will have nothing I fear to bestow  So profuse is she grown in her whimsical woe  On the new Mausoleum what sums does she waste  That fantastical fabric of barbarous taste  Where all decorations that art can devise  To adorn the proud tombs of the valiant and wise  Are mix'd o'er the bones of a simple old cit  Who display'd not a sparkle of valor or wit  Who though rich pass'd I think with small comfort through life  A mere slave to the whims of his highblooded wife  FRANCES  That preposterous vault I have view'd with concern  And have cried and have laugh'd o'er Sir Simon's rich urn  But at length having study'd her Ladyship's trim  And loving her virtue in spite of her whim  I've a scheme that I think with success will be crown'd  On this folly itself her correction to found  By indulging her foible that foible to banish  And make all her mournful absurdity vanish  CAREY  To your judgment dear Fanny I often submit  And much could I hope from your goodness and wit  Yet I think you can't make in her youth's giddy season  Such a vain wanton widow a creature of reason  FRANCES  You judges of nature and lords of creation  Howe'er you pretend to profound speculation  Are exceedingly apt your wise selves to deceive  In the judgments you pass on the daughters of Eve  And most when you reckon in every transaction  One indelicate foible their sole spring of action  My Lady Sophia you greatly mistake  By nature she's neither a prude nor a rake  At present I own she appears too demure  But though her heart's tender her bosom is pure  To a strong understanding she makes no pretence  But has many mild virtues and does not want sense  One foible alone has o'erclouded her mind  The foible of seeming supremely refin'd  But if I succeed this slight fault she will mend  And you'll find her a worthy agreeable friend  CAREY  You may say of her purity what you think fit  But her case one specific alone will admit  Believe me whene'er a young widow's so prim  And by quaint affectation so cramp'd in each limb  A new husband alone by his pliant embrace  Can restore her starch'd form to its natural grace  Is this my fair Quack the new nostrum you've got  FRANCES  Indeed you shan't hear any part of my plot  Till I know its success  CAREY  Ah my dear I'm afraid  This is some coy device my request to evade  And to keep the wish'd day of our wedding still distant  FRANCES  No in truth by the aid of a secret assistant  I've a plan of great moment in high agitation  Which may happily end all our various vexation  Allow me three days for its perfect digestion  And if in that time you will ask me no question  I promise thenceforth without murmur or strife  To obey your commands for the rest of my life  CAREY  I gladly subscribe to this bargain of bliss  So allow me to seal the kind bond with a kiss  Remember three days I can't add a day more  And shall fancy those three in duration threescore  FRANCES  O they'll pass very quickmuch amus'd you will be  With the three rival Bards whom today we shall see  To whom my sad cousin oblig'd me to write  For sepulchral inscriptions in praise of her Knight  They have sent each an epitaph hither before 'em  And are coming themselves with all solemn decorum  As each without contest expects here the laurel  On her Ladyship's judgment they'll probably quarrel  As you know the whole group you must wait on the choir  To soothe the irascible sons of the Lyre  CAREY  As to Facil and Trope if they're hurt I'll engage  That one glance of your eyes will extinguish their rage  You will find them two chearful and goodhumour'd lads  And whether their Pegasus gallops or pads  It will please me I own if her Ladyship's fancies  May tend to recruit their declining finances  But for splenetic Rumble who grandly absurd  Never speaks without using a sixfooted word  I care not how much he is mortified here  FRANCES  But the length of his words hits her Ladyship's ear  CAREY  His stiff phrases indeed may accord with her sorrow  Yet his spleen will insult her ere this time tomorrow  For often he'll call with quaint arrogant vanity  Every head but his own the abode of inanity  Because a great author's defects he has caught  He vainly pretends to his vigor of thought  Though on similar grounds he as well might suppose  That because some dark spots may be seen on his nose  His face has the lustre and force of the sun  FRANCES  In our chorus of Bards I am glad he is one  For I'm curious I own the strange elf to survey  Though I'm rather afraid of his wife who they say  Reads all the rough verses her husband has penn'd  Till she stuns every ear she can tempt to attend  She's to come with her Poet  CAREY  I fancy they're here  For I think I've the hum of his rhymes in my ear  FRANCES  No no 'tis her Ladyship mightily smitten  With the highsounding epitaph Rumble has written  Enter  Lady Sophia  reading  LADY SOPHIA  "This doleful domicile of dust contains  "Sir Simon Sentiment's inert remains  "Though Death's cold stroke infrigidate his frame  "Commerce resounds his emporetic name"  Ah my friends here is verse truly grand and pathetic  How exceedingly fine is the word  emporetic  Why Carey you seem quite untouch'd by its beauty  Of friendship I fear you forget the last duty  You two giddy creatures though both tenderhearted  Think more of yourselves than of my dear departed  CAREY  As your Ladyship chuses to press me so hard  I confess though his memory still I regard  That my thoughts from Sir Simon will frequently roam  And I hope when you've deck'd his funereal dome  Your Ladyship's mind may by Nature's direction  Assume a more lively and chearful complexion  That you'll mix once again  LADY SOPHIA  Never Carey no never  No time from his grave my devotion shall sever  In my eye the fond tear of remembrance shall swim  And each sigh of my soul shall be sacred to him  CAREY  Consider dear Madam that custom and reason  Prescribe to our sorrows a natural season  You have mourn'd like a model of conjugal truth  Now attend to the claims of your beauty and youth  In the bloom of your graces  LADY SOPHIA  Hold hold you wild thing  In your fancy I find gross ideas will spring  'Tis the fault of you menere I chasten'd his mind  My Sir Simon himself to that failing inclin'd  But I taught him to change the loose laugh of futility  For the sweet melting tear of refin'd sensibility  Till through his mild frame such pure tenderness ran  To such delicate softness I brought the dear man  He would weep o'er the withering leaf of a rose  And smile at the thorn though it wounded his nose  Ah my gentle Sir Simon  FRANCES  Indeed he was such  That your thoughts cannot dwell on his image too much  LADY SOPHIA  Your soothing kind sympathy charms me my dear  I now trust you will wait till the end of next year  Nor with Hymen's festivity gross and indecent  Profane our chaste sorrow so graceful and recent  CAREY  aside to  Frances  How can you so flatter her curst affectation  Between you I'm really half mad with vexation  LADY SOPHIA  As you my good girl with such feeling attend  When o'er the dear tomb of Sir Simon I bend  That your thoughts may not roam when our duty we pay  To that most precious piece of inanimate clay  That you may not omit o'er his ashes to sigh  In considering what weddingcloaths you must buy  I've determin'd my dear as I think it your due  To resign all my colour'd apparel to you  To wear it again I indeed am unable  And on earth while I linger my garb shall be sable    Speaking to a  Servant  behind the scene    Jenny bring in the chest that I bid you prepare  FRANCES  aside to  Carey  What d'ye think of this singular present  CAREY  O rare  Her crisis is coming without much delay  There might have been doubts had she fix'd upon grey  But a vow to wear black all the rest of her life  Is a strong indication she'll soon be a wife    Two  Servants  bring in a large Chest    LADY SOPHIA  to  Frances  I have told you my dear that refin'd in my joy  The array of affection I ne'er could destroy  These are garments unsoil'd that I beg you to take  Thus preserv'd for the conquest they help'd me to make  In the sweet days of courtship these garments I wore  Vain memorials of pleasure that now is no more  Of those dear days of triumph you'll now see the trophy  When Sir Simon first call'd me angelical Sophy  The fond recollection subdues my soft breast  FRANCES  Dear Madam forbear then to open the chest  LADY SOPHIA  No no my good girl I will shew you the whole  And how colours express'd various shades in my soul  In soft variegation I vied with the dove  And reveal'd by my dress the gradations of love  Here is first a cold brownin this gown I was nice  And repell'd my warm swain with the chillness of ice  But growing more soft in this azure attire  I allow'd him with hope to enliven desire  In this pale lilach lutestring he found me relent  And this rosecolour'd silk was the blush of consent  O I ne'er shall forget  GERRARD  entering  Would your Ladyship chuse  To receive Mr Rumble  CAREY  The Bard and his Muse  LADY SOPHIA  No not for the wealth that's below the chaste moon  Till I meet all the Bards in the sable saloon  By his sudden arrival I'm sadly confounded  And should faint if he saw me with colours surrounded  To Miss Jasper's apartment away with this chest  Dear Frances and Carey pray wait on my guest  Till my poor shatter'd nerves are a little compos'd  And the freshbleeding wound of my bosom is clos'd  Stay GerrardIf cards should be call'd for tonight  Place the new japann'd tables alone in my sight  For the pool of Quadrille set the blackbugle dish  And remember you bring us the ebony fish  Exeunt  Lady Sophia  and  Gerrard  FRANCES  What the deuce shall I do with the wife of the Poet  She may ruin my scheme if she happen to know it  She may pry  CAREY  Never fear it I'll venture a wager  That the rhymes of her husband will fully engage her  You have seen a proud Bantam crow over a pen  Where a small egg has dropt from his favorite hen  He crows and he flutters and struts round the yard  So engross'd by her joy is the wife of a Bard  And by similar bustle attention she begs  And crows o'er her partner's poetical eggs  But here come little Partlet and old Chanticleer  Enter  Mr  and  Mrs Rumble  CAREY  Mr Rumble I'm happy in seeing you here  Mrs RumbleMiss Jasperyou know Ma'am her brother  And you Ladies will soon be well known to each other  MR RUMBLE  Though we meet in the house of refin'd lamentation  In your presence I feel Sir some exhilaration  Since I in this spot as a stranger appear  I rejoice in a friend who domesticates here  My Lady is lodg'd in a sumptuous mansion  And I'm pleas'd with her park's evanescent expansion  As my wife has a taste for the grand and stupendous  I am glad I complied with her wish to attend us  MISS JASPER  You have had Ma'am I hope an agreeable ride  Our prospects are pleasant on every side  And our roads are so good  MRS RUMBLE  That you'll wonder to learn  We were stopt on our way by an odd overturn  MISS JASPER  Indeed you surprize me I hope that no harm  Has ensued from the accident save your alarm  But how could it happen  MRS RUMBLE  Sometimes on the road  My dear Mr Rumble composes an ode  For he says in such motion his fancy shines most  And all true lyric poets you know travel post  But a chaiseboy alas is a sad ignoramus  And the poor honest booby whose blunder o'ercame us  Mistook a Pindarical ejaculation  For a horrible vulgar prophane execration  And turning to stare at my dear Mr Rumble  Drove against a steep hillock which gave us a tumble  MISS JASPER  A most cruel event whence I fear we may lose  The unfortunate fruit of the terrified Muse  'Twas indeed most unlucky  MRS RUMBLE  Dear Ma'am not at all  Such a genius is not to be crush'd by a fall  The accident brighten'd his fancy and on it  He gallantly gave me an amorous sonnet  As I know you love verse  MR RUMBLE  Mrs Rumble I vow  This display of my trifles I cannot allow  You for ever mistake to my endless vexation  Gay Levity's sparkle for Wit's coruscation  MRS RUMBLE  Ah you dear modest man in a napkin you'd hide  The talent my love must contemplate with pride  As Miss Jasper I'm sure is a lady of taste  She shall see some sweet things that I pack'd up in haste  A few satires and odes    Takes out an enormous pocketbook stuff'd with papers  MR RUMBLE  As you dread my displeasure  Put up that red volume  MRS RUMBLE  What bury my treasure  Indeed I must read one sublime composition  MR RUMBLE  Mrs Rumble the part of a wife is submission  Silly woman to whom for my sins I am yok'd  With pulveriz'd gravel you almost are choak'd  And fatigu'd with vehicular dilaceration  You would murder my verses by rough recitation  MRS RUMBLE  No indeed do but hear me one stanza rehearse  'Tis my favorite ode  MR RUMBLE  As you grow so perverse  To preserve my own temper from exacerbation  I must thus stop your organs of vociferation    Lays his hand on her lips  MRS RUMBLE  Well my dear I defer it to some fitter time  And I kiss the sweet hand that has written such rhyme  MISS JASPER  Your connubial obedience dear Ma'am I admire  But I'm sure your fatigues some refreshment require  Give me leave to attend you  MRS RUMBLE  It gives me concern  To trouble you Ma'am but I hope to return  Your obliging attention so kind and polite  By a peep at a satire which ne'er saw the light    Exit  Miss Jasper  with  Mrs Rumble  CAREY  Mr Rumble you're blest in an excellent wife  That superlative prize in the lott'ry of life  The vow of the altar she rises above  And adds admiration to duty and love  MR RUMBLE  My wife has I think the right feminine nerve  Her sex was created to wonder and serve  As their minds have from nature no ponderous powers  They have nothing to do but to venerate ours  CAREY  O fie can you estimate woman so low  To our fair female authors pray think what we owe  MR RUMBLE  I cannot read one Sir without oscitation  They don't understand antithetic vibration  Their ideas have nothing of height and profundity  Their conceptions want vigor their periods rotundity  Their truth is too stale or too feeble their fiction  And I cannot endure their anomalous diction  But enough of these garrulous wasters of ink  Her Ladyship likes my inscription I think  That lugubrious poem no critic shall garble  And I trust you can shew it me graven on marble  CAREY  It would please me to give you that pleasure dear Sir  But in truth on this point there's a little demur  Her Ladyship means to consult on the case  MR RUMBLE  What Sir is my poem expos'd to disgrace  Her critical quacks does this woman engage  To slash my sound verse with empirical rage  CAREY  Believe me good Sir all the homage that's due  To poetical genius she offers to you  But her Ladyship's love for Sir Simon is such  She thinks that he cannot be honour'd too much  And to give all his virtues their due celebration  She from diverse poetical pens of our nation  Has a cargo of epitaphs  MR RUMBLE  Hah is it so  Are there rivals to shoot in Apollo's strong bow  This should have been told me beforebut no matter  My concurrents perhaps may more lavishly flatter  Yet in funeral song they can't equal my tone  Where Pope has miscarried I triumph alone  Pray who are these Bards that with me are to cope  CAREY  I think you're acquainted with Facil and Trope  MR RUMBLE  What Facil whose verse is the thread of tenuity  That fellow distinguish'd by flippant fatuity  Who nonsense and rhyme can incessantly mingle  A poetif poetry's only a jingle  CAREY  Poor Facil wants force yet may frequently please  By a light airy mixture of mirth and of ease  But Trope's lofty muse has a higher pretension  MR RUMBLE  Sir Trope is a rhymer devoid of invention  Who talks in a high strutting style of the stars  And the eagle of Jove and the chariot of Mars  And pompously tells in elaborate lines  That now the moon glistens and now the sun shines  CAREY  How severe my good friend are you Bards to each other  Yet if each would indulgently look on a brother  For your general honor  MR RUMBLE  I cannot agree  That these fellows have aught homogeneous with me  To contend with such scribblers I deem a disgrace  And my dignity bids me abandon the place  With her Ladyship's judgment I mean not to quarrel  But shall leave her to crown any monkey with laurel  CAREY  Mr Rumble in points so exceedingly nice  I do not presume to obtrude my advice  But allow me to mention before you depart  What may tend to encourage your liberal art  Sir Simon you know had a passion for fame  And left a large sum to eternize his name  By some structure of note yet he never said what  So a grand Mausoleum is rais'd on this spot  At so vast an expence that my Lady I find  Has surpast what the Knight for the building design'd  The superfluous cost be it great as it may  From her own private purse she designs to defray  Though an annual fund by the will is adjusted  With the guidance of which she is also entrusted  But from this as I hear she has form'd an intention  To give the best epitaphwriter a pension  MR RUMBLE  Has she so'tis a gracious effulgent design  I protest of her judgment I highly opine  Her face has been chiefly the subject of praise  But a splendor of intellect now she displays  I cannot abruptly depart from a scene  Whose mistress discovers the mind of a queen  Nor rudely desert though my time is precarious  A lady whose graces are so multifarious  But pray lest some puppy should here circumvent me  To her Ladyship can't you directly present me  Though I fear since my fall I am hardly so clean as  A Bard should be seen by a female Maecenas  CAREY  Never fearin your coat there is not so much dust  As to blind the bright eye that to merit is just  If you'll step in this room which is call'd the Apollo  And wait a few minutes I'll speedily follow  And acquaint you how soon we may hope for admission  My Lady loves form in her present condition  To amuse yourself there you'll however be able  For you'll find all the epitaphs rang'd on the table  MR RUMBLE  Are they soit is wellI indeed love to slash  An inane poetaster's incongruous trash    Exit  CAREY  There I'll venture to leave the old cynical Rumble  The prey he has seiz'd to growl over and mumble  If this Bard whom my Lady regards as her darling  Has infus'd in his brothers his talent of snarling  I think she will find little room to admire  The harmony form'd by her Lyrical Choir  But lo the kind Muse an example now sends  That two mortals at once may be poets and friends  Enter  Facil  and  Trope  CAREY  My dear lads of Parnassus you're welcome together  I am glad you associate like birds of a feather  That fools may not cry "Every Bard hates a brother  "And Poets like Pike are the prey of each other"  How fare ye my friends have you prosper'd of late  I hope each has rais'd his Parnassian estate  In our last conversation I heard ye lament  That your farms on the mountain produc'd a low rent  FACIL  In truth 'tis a niggardly soil at the best  As I and my brother can truly attest  But with hopes of a new golden aera my friend  On your patroness here we are come to attend  To encourage the arts she has spirit and sense  And we're told my dear Carey her wealth is immense  TROPE  In fortune and soul she's a queen 'tis agreed  And of genius as fond as Christina the Swede  For the Public's dull taste she we trust will console us  And make our poor Helicon rich as Pactolus  FACIL  Perhaps my dear Carey we owe to your care  The favor of this truly liberal Fair  You are doubtless appriz'd that my Lady requires  CAREY  I know she has paid due respect to your lyres  Yet indeed on that title no thanks can I claim  You're indebted alone to your common friend Fame  Her Ladyship knows with what spirit you write  And has begg'd your two Muses to honor her Knight  And I trust to your mutual advantage and joy  She'll reward the rare talents she wish'd to employ  But be not too sanguineI know how you Bards  Build the fabric of Hope like a castle of cards  Entre nous  our good Lady is odd in her taste  Tho' her mind is no doubt with munificence grac'd  Perhaps to one Bard she'll be lavishly kind  And appear to the other as utterly blind  Then let each be prepar'd  FACIL  So we are my good friend  And by mutual support shall each other defend  To tell you a secret we both wrote in haste  And strangers alike to her Ladyship's taste  But agreed as our purses are equally low  To divide what on either she deigns to bestow  CAREY  The compact is friendly I wish from my heart  That all who pursue the poetical art  Would learn from you two their mean rage to suppress  And not rave at the sight of a rival's success  FACIL  There indeed they may copy from Trope and from me  From envy thank Heaven we are happily free  We rally each other as much as we please  I laugh at his figureshe laughs at my ease  Yet with rancor we ne'er try each other to hit  But value Benevolence far above Wit  The art we still doat on has ruin'd us both  Yet to quit the deceiver we're equally loth  From Commerce and Law we were led to retire  By the splendid illusions that wait on the Lyre  And though each has obtain'd a fair portion of praise  We have no golden fruit in our chaplet of bays  Still we look without spleen on our gains and our losses  Each endear'd to the other by similar crosses  CAREY  In truth my dear Bards your goodhumour is rare  You're philosophers both and a singular pair  With what excellent temper I've heard you rehearse  A malicious burlesque of your innocent verse  FACIL  O with me 'tis a rule not to quarrel with those  Who attack what I scribble in rhyme or in prose  To skirmish with you how unjust should I be  If perchance of my verses you don't think with me  When to tell you the truth I'm so various an elf  I have twenty opinions about them myself  CAREY  What an honest confession  FACIL  'Tis perfectly true  Yet my works I must own I too rarely review  And too quick in their birth are the brats of my brain  My Muse is no parent inur'd to long pain  Who dandles a rickety chit while it lives  And loves it the more for the trouble it gives  She with lively dispatch like a provident mother  Soon as one child is born thinks of rearing another  But enough of a jade that is merely ideal  Let us talk of a female kind lovely and real  An inspirer of something much sweeter than verse  And I hope with a few thousand pounds in her purse  I allude my good friend to Miss Jasper your flame  But perhaps she no longer is known by that name  And has wisely exchang'd it for Carey  CAREY  Not so  The day or our wedding you'll certainly know  As I hope that your Muse will the altar attend  With a rapturous ode on the bliss of your friend  FACIL  I accept the gay office with infinite glee  But at present I hope the fair Nymph we shall see  Trope and I were the intimate friends of her brother  What a genius was heI ne'er knew such another  At school we first saw him his talent display  I remember he modell'd our figures in clay  The trade of a sculptor we thought not his fate  But suppos'd he'd have half of Sir Simon's estate  CAREY  So he would had not Vellum's more provident care  When he made the Knight's will nam'd himself as his heir  My Lady indeed has the rents for her life  But to Vellum yields half if again she's a wife  And if without issue her Ladyship dies  All this ample estate is old Latitat's prize  FACIL  And what says poor Jasper that spirited lad  Faith I think such a will might have driven him mad  Though engag'd by his art he I'm sure must be nettled  But in Russia they say he is happily settled  CAREY  When a generous mind has embrac'd a fine art  With Fortune's vain gifts it can readily part  From the world's dirty cares it detaches itself  To contend for a prize far superior to pelf  And looks with contempt I am sure that you feel it  Upon hearthard'ning gold and the villains who steal it  Such a mind from his childhood your friend has possest  And in Russia I hear he is busy and blest  For a patroness there of imperial spirit  The munificent Catherine honours his merit  FACIL  I protest in the different realms of the earth  There is no friend like woman to genius and worth  TROPE  I wish you and I may a Catherine find  In the widow whose Knight in our verse is enshrin'd  FACIL  You perhaps my dear Carey can tell us some news  Has her Ladyship told you her thoughts of our Muse  CAREY  One thing my good friends I can tell you at present  But I fear you'll not think it exceedingly pleasant  Yet it's certainly fit you should instantly know it  And indeed emulation inspirits a poet  Nay look not so grave'tis a rivalthat's all  A candidate come at her Ladyship's call  FACIL  A rival who is it  TROPE  A rival pray who  CAREY  One I'll venture to say fully known to you two  A Bard whose pretensions are not very humble  FACIL  You surely don't mean the pedantical Rumble  CAREY  Even so that longwinded loud Stentor of song  And the ladies all think that his language is strong  TROPE  'Tis as strong and as knotty as Hercules' club  And as rough as the roll of the old Cynic's tub  CAREY  Hush hushin this chamber the Bear is inclos'd  Growling over the epitaphs you have compos'd  FACIL  Is he sointroduce usI long to partake  In the courteous remarks that his candor will make  CAREY  O if such is your wish to our guest I'll present you  But I fancy his comments will quickly content you  FACIL  As for me I defy him to give me vexation  And Trope will delight in some retaliation  End of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  Miss Jasper  and  Gerrard  MISS JASPER  PRAY watch for my brother and bring him to me  And let no one good Gerrard my visitor see  On your faithful prudence I solely rely  We're undone if our guests should his person espy  From all but ourselves we must keep him unknown  And if seen he must pass for a friend of your own  I depend on your prudence  GERRARD  Dear Miss never fear  To do him any good I would watch for a year  Heaven knows I have pray'd for him early and late  Since the old lawyer robb'd him of this fine estate  And would give all I'm worth could I get him his due  MISS JASPER  Honest Gerrard I know we've a good friend in you  But look out for my brotherhe'll want your assistance  GERRARD  I think I shall know him at half a mile's distance  MISS JASPER  He'll be here ere you stirprithee run to the gate  GERRARD  Dear Miss you forget I am past sixtyeight  But I'll make all the haste that I can for your sake  And I'll pray for you both at each step that I take    Exit  MISS JASPER  That's a worthy old creature though rather too flow  He is trusty and will not betray us I know  But though he's secure I still shudder to think  How my hopes in a moment to nothing may sink  As the crisis comes on in a hazardous scheme  With what infinite terrors the fancy will teem  In my hopes of the match I was sanguine and hearty  But I now have my fears in regard to each party  Should my Gentleman turn out too squeamish and coy  How vain the kind art I have deign'd to employ  Should my Lady shew familypride at this season  I've depended in vain upon Nature and Reason  I have studied her well and I clearly descry  She's destin'd again to the conjugal tie  In spite of the whims false refinement has taught her  She is honest dame Nature's benevolent daughter  Though a truly good creature in virtue so strong  She would not for the world do a thing she thinks wrong  Yet of such yielding wax her soft bosom is form'd  It will melt in a moment if properly warm'd  Provided her fancy affectedly nice  Can delude her kind heart with some dainty device  Some delicate plea for becoming a wife  To the youth who conjures her to bless him for life  On this I have founded my whimsical plan  In hopes of producing this fortunate man  My brother I know has a passion for her  And she soon to all men would his person prefer  But in my rapid project he will not be steady  Unless I persuade him she loves him already  For men rarely know tho' of knowledge they're vain  By a wellmanag'd minute how much they may gain  And should he detect the kind art I employ  Farewell to my hopes of their conjugal joy  I yesterday thought that my plan could not fail  Now I think 'twill be marvellous should it prevail  But away cruel fears hence ye painful alarms  I behold my dear brother restor'd to my arms  Enter  Jasper  JASPER  Heaven bless thee dear girlyou have got me once more  In spite of my vow not to visit this shore  And I joyfully fly with affection's quick pace  To enfold thy kind heart in a brother's embrace  With that in my grasp I true opulence feel  And my wealth in this casket no lawyer can steal  MISS JASPER  If love and esteem may be reckon'd as treasure  You indeed my dear brother are rich above measure  O how have I long'd all your feelings to learn  How ardently pray'd for your speedy return  How often accus'd your indignant delay  What a million of things had I ready to say  What questions to askand yet now you are come  The confusion of joy has almost made me dumb  JASPER  My tender good girlI perceive you retain  All your lively sensations of pleasure and pain  But these tears will relieve youdon't check them my dear  'Tis a tribute my heart is inclin'd to revere  All flattering language I prize them above  And hold them the truest expression of love  And indeed when I think what distress and regret  Have harrass'd your sensible mind since we met  When I think how from sordid selfinterest free  You forget your own wrongs in attention to me  I feel tears of gratitude ready to start  And confess my dear sister the pride of my heart  MISS JASPER  Yet for life you could talk of deserting this sister  JASPER  But you see when she pleaded I could not resist her  When I first was inform'd of old Vellum's vile fraud  In my rage I determin'd on living abroad  For Russia you know I departed from Rome  However my dear you may safely presume  Such an absence from you I could never endure  Had you not brought me back by a different lure  And my friends of the Law with your wishes conspir'd  To make me return with the haste you desir'd  As they give me some hopes of soon changing our fate  And regaining from Vellum the pilfer'd estate  But how fares my dear widow whose partial affection  Seems kindled by some friendly angel's direction  To redress half our wrongs and defeat the old thief  Who impos'd on Sir Simon's too simple belief  A rascal to feign a regard for my fame  And steal my estate not to injure my name  I thought not my cousin so easy a fool  How the deuce could old Vellum so make him his tool  For the Knight on this plea sign'd his will when in health  Not to spoil a great artist by giving me wealth  But where's my kind widowI long to express  MISS JASPER  You must pardon a little demureness in dress  Nor expect her though you to all men she prefers  To fly into your arms  JASPER  No let me fly to her's  MISS JASPER  Not so fast my dear brother you surely forget  By what vigilant enemies we are beset  Should Vellum whose spies are now under this roof  And against whose vile art no affection is proof  Should he get the least hint of my Lady's attachment  He would rage like the wolf in that newpainted hatchment  Your mutual regard he would set at defiance  And move earth and hell to prevent your alliance  JASPER  Would he soBy my faith as the widow's so kind  I care not what mischiefs may lurk in his mind  Not a legion of imps by a lawyer instructed  Shall mar the sweet business her heart has conducted  But has she quite hid her connubial design  Has the rogue no surmise she will shortly be mine  MISS JASPER  No not any  JASPER  Well manag'd my dear fairy elf  MISS JASPER  To say truth 'tis a secret not known to herself  JASPER  To herselfam I dup'd then  MISS JASPER  Dear brother be cool  JASPER  Have you sent for me home but to make me a fool  MISS JASPER  No indeed but to make you most happy for lifc  And give you a lovely and excellent wife  In so serious a point could you think that I jested  Have you purchas'd the licence my letter requested  JASPER  Here it isand our folly will finely expose  If the fair one escapes whom this chain should inclose  MISS JASPER  Implicitly trust to my care as your guide  And ere midnight perhaps you may clasp a kind bride  JASPER  You teaze me dear girl with much whimsical pain  But I beg that you'll clearly these riddles explain  I fear you have form'd some nonsensical plot  Has the Widow declar'd she will have me or not  MISS JASPER  Dear brother indulge me with patient attention  And our true situation I'll honestly mention  But however my project may strike you at first  Into rage and despair do not hastily burst  To be bold in such points is in truth to be wise  And a widow's a fort to be won by surprize  JASPER  So she has not engag'd then to give me her hand  MISS JASPER  Have patienceher state you shall soon understand  That she loves you I know and with innocent art  I have cherish'd the passion still hid in her heart  For she fancies good creature that safe from love's flashes  She's devoted for life to Sir Simon's cold ashes  You know she affects to be highly refin'd  And a project I've built on this cast of her mind  Which if you'll obey me I'll venture my life  Like a stroke of true magic will make her your wife  And before any soul can suspect our intention  JASPER  Well my girl and pray what is your magic invention  MISS JASPER  You must know she believes that you only return  To oblige her by gracing Sir Simon's rich urn  She thinks the Czarina on this one condition  That you travel incog gives you her kind permission  And her Ladyship's mind I have fill'd with these notions  As they form an excuse for concealing your motions  So she hopes from your hand with the highest delight  To behold a fine statue of her noble Knight  Now Sir Simon and you have been thought much alike  And to make the resemblance more forcibly strike  I mean to array you her heart to entrap  In his blue sattin nightgown and red velvet cap  The dress which to humour his elegant Fair  The courteous old Cit was contented to wear  JASPER  And is this your fine plan you impertinent jade  Dress me up as the Punch of a dull masquerade  MISS JASPER  Have patiencemy scheme must surprize you no doubt  Yet I think you'll applaud if you hear it throughout  And if you have spirit I know 'twill succeed  JASPER  To play the dead mana fine project indeed  MISS JASPER  Nay but hear meyour actions I will not controul  JASPER  Well you've made me an idiot so tell me the whole  MISS JASPER  No I've taught you to make yourself all you desire  If you will but restrain this intemperate fire  Come attend to my plotYou fond creatures shall meet  In the new Mausoleum that pensive retreat  On a pedestal there you your person must place  To shew how a statue the building may grace  To behold you so fixt I'll my Lady prepare  She'll be struck in surveying your figure and air  She with tender surprize will your features review  And fancy she sees her Sir Simon in you  Then spring from your pedestal seize her sweet charms  And swear as you fold her soft heart in your arms  You are like her Sir Simon in soul as in form  That your heart towards her is as tenderly warm  You may addin a vision he bade you direct her  To take you for life as her legal protector  And to make her chaste love to his memory known  Chuse his living resemblance before one of stone  There's a promising scheme for a widow's relief  JASPER  Set woman to woman as thief to catch thief  I confess in your plot there is spirit and soul  On her governing foible you've grounded the whole  And rapid success might attend on your plan  But for puppetshew courtship I am not the man  I possess not the face that your stratagem needs  For so bold an attack on a widow in weeds  And I feel some reluctance in truth at my heart  To such an appearance of fraudulent art  MISS JASPER  Away my dear brother with scruples like these  Of the amorous heart doubt's a common disease  But one that my counsels may speedily cure  You both love each otheryour meaning is pure  The gentle Sophia you'll tenderly treat  Her form is enchanting her temper is sweet  And if your odd courtship appears like a jest  In your marriage I'm sure you'll be equally blest  Without it indeed our fair friend is undone  For old Vellum intends that the coxcomb his son  When he comes from his travelsBut somebody's near  A sudden surprize in this quarter I fear  Let us haste to my roomI must school you above  And you'll act as I wish if you've one spark of love  If I find you have notI shall honestly say  You must give up the part that I meant you to play    Exeunt hastily  Enter  Lady Sophia  with Papers in her hand attended by  Carey  LADY SOPHIA  Unfold the great doors of the sable saloon    The Scene opens and discovers a large Apartment with a black velvet Pavilion    At the thoughts of this business I'm ready to swoon  But you my good Carey will lessen my pain  And aid my weak nerves the sad scene to sustain  As my Gentlemanusher you'll kindly attend  And bring the three Bards to an audience my friend  I shall sit to receive them beneath my pavilion  To repay their sweet verse I could wish for a million  But I think that each Bard will be pleas'd with his lot  So bring themStay Carey one thing I've forgot  But now 'tis too late for my purpose I fear  I meant to have order'd the horns to be here  With a little soft music these rites to begin  And to sound a dead march as the Poets walk in  CAREY  Dear Madam their verses will want no such aid  Let me haste to present themFantastical jade    Aside as he goes out  LADY SOPHIA  seating herself under the Pavilion and looking over the Papers in her hand  From these epitaphs thus I may happily borrow  The parts that most flatter my delicate sorrow  And while in one piece I harmoniously blend  Four lines from each poem these authors have penn'd  I am pleas'd that on them no vexation can fall  That I shall not hurt one and must gratify all  But the Geniuses come  Enter  Carey  introducing  Rumble Facil  and  Trope  who advance with profound Bows towards the Pavilion  LADY SOPHIA  Ye kind friends to my grief  Who employ your fine parts in affliction's relief  My mournful distress by your talents ye calm  And my dear lost Sir Simon your verses embalm  As I ought let me first Mr Rumble address  What I owe to you Sir I can never express  Yet the force of your pen let my gratitude mention  RUMBLE  aside  I perceive she has senseand I'm sure of the pension  LADY SOPHIA  In my choice I have done equal justice I hope  To you Mr Faciland you Mr Trope  From your various productions twelve verses I chuse  And I blend the rich sweets of each different Muse  Thus a wreath is completed to deck the dear shrine  And to honor Sir Simon three Poets combine  Here you'll see how I've manag'd this nice combination    Distributing a Paper to each  RUMBLE  I protest I can't suffer this conglomeration  Of marble and brick this anomalous jumble  CAREY  in a whisper to  Rumble  Remember the pension my good Mr Rumble  RUMBLE  Sir my admurmurations shall loudly be heard  I'ye a right to exclaim that my Lady's absurd  In her cap she as well might conquassate together  The down of green geese and an ostrich's feather  FACIL  I think Mr Rumble my Lady displays  The most dexterous art in uniting our lays  Your elder Muse first like the waggon of Night  Moves solemn and grandlike the chariot of Light  Airy Trope then advances with different pace  And like Twilight between you I find my right place  RUMBLE  Remember young man while this splendor you brag on  That rich Ponderosity rides in a waggon  But I will not descend to a vile contestation  Our minds were not fashion'd for reciprocation  My Lady I pardon on this one condition  That she quickly proceeds to a decomposition  She may chuse of our epitaphs which she thinks fit  But a mixture so monstrous I will not admit  She as well with her scissars might hastily snip  From different portraits the eye nose and lip  And think that her needle accomplish'd great matters  By compacting a face of the discrepant tatters  LADY SOPHIA  O mercydear Sir pray this business adjust  And do not disturb my Sir Simon's calm dust  If a squabble concerning his tomb you excite  I am sure his dear spirit will haunt us tonight  I feel in this terror new anguish arise  And a fresh flood of sorrow swells into my eyes  CAREY  aside to  Rumble  Mr Rumble I fear if you do not submit  My Lady will have an hysterical fit  RUMBLE  Sir in points that my credit and honor involve  A few drops of saltwater won't melt my resolve  FACIL  aside to  Carey  I protest though fantastic I own she appears  I can not bear the sight of such beauty in tears  And as I perceive she is really distrest  I'll at once put an end to the strife in her breast    To  Lady Sophia  Dear Madam that you on this point may not grieve  And your delicate mind from all doubt to relieve  Let me and my friend our pretensions resign  And leave one single Bard to embellish the shrine  We beg that alone Mr Rumble may bear  The honor he thinks that we ought not to share  CAREY  No no my good friend you're too modest indeed  I've a plan for ye all that I trust will succeed  LADY SOPHIA  What is it good Carey I wish to pursue  Some happy expedient suggested by you  CAREY  At Mecca dear Ma'am seven poems we're told  O'er the Prophet's rich tomb were suspended in gold  Now let three worthy Bards each an elegy write  And suspend all their works o'er the tomb of your Knight  LADY SOPHIA  O charmingyour thought is enchantingly fine  Mr Rumble I hope you applaud his design  RUMBLE  From this proposition I will not revolt  Though my young rivals' pride it may serve to exalt  Of the honor you do them I will not be jealous  But I'll teach the vain youths to revere an Entellus  LADY SOPHIA  Well I hope what has past will be kindly forgot  And that now you'll all deign to compose on the spot  I commend my good Carey the Bards to your care  Entertain them I beg with the choicest of fare  And as it grows late you must leave me my friend  In affliction's chaste rites my lone evening to spend  Farewell worthy Sirsyou now leave me to sorrow  But I hope to attend you at dinner tomorrow  CAREY  Come my friends now permit me to be your director  Mr Rumble 'Rack Punch is your genuine nectar  As the night's coming on I'll prepare a rich bowl  That shall give to you Poets fresh vigour of soul  For the Muse with newforce like the flyingfish springs  When she stoops for the purpose of wetting her wings    Exit  Carey  with  Rumble Facil  and  Trope  LADY SOPHIA  alone  I am glad we have sooth'd Mr Rumble's chagrin  Enter  Miss Jasper  LADY SOPHIA  O my dear with the Poets I've had such a scene  They have shaken my nerves to that cruel degree  I shall quiver all night like a poor aspentree  MISS JASPER  My tidings new life in your heart will infuse  The young Sculptor's arriv'd  LADY SOPHIA  That indeed is sweet news  Then in effigy soon I shall clasp my dear Knight  Is the block too provided and perfectly white  Of the true Parian marble I trust he will mold  The statue my bosom so pants to behold  MISS JASPER  I assure you the business engages his heart  And you'll see a fine work from his exquisite art  To my brother already the vault I have shewn  And of attitudes there he is thinking alone  As I mean to conceal his arrival at home  We went by the pass under ground to the dome  LADY SOPHIA  We will join him dear Fanny and go the same way  I long at the tomb my devotions to pay  To hear how your brother's fine fancy and skill  With new decorations the structure may fill  And to see in what posture the statue may stand  MISS JASPER  Let us gohe'll be happy to kiss your fair hand    Exeunt    The Scene changes to the inside of a grand Mausoleum on one side a large oblong Tomb of white marble on the other some sleps ascending from a subterraneous passage  Jasper  appears in the Gown and Cap of  Sir Simon  JASPER  What a part has my sister induc'd me to play  I wish from the scene I could well slip away  I shall never succeedsurely love was ne'er made  Since the days of old Jove in such odd masquerade  I scarce know myself in this whimsical plight  But I fancy I look very like the old Knight  Yet if you my sweet Widow incline to my plan  This image will beat the original man  Gad I hope she won't fancy I'm really his ghost  But I hear them belowI must leap to my post  Jasper  places himself in a striking attitude on the top of the marble Tomb while  Lady Sophia  and  Miss Jasper  ascend the steps from the subterranean passage    LADY SOPHIA  starting  O mercywhat phantom amazes my sight  Has the grave to my love given back the dear Knight  'Tis himself I perceive'tis no fanciful dream  O I faint    Falls on the arm of  Miss Jasper  Jasper  flies to  Lady Sophia  in great agitation and speaks at the same time to  Miss Jasper  See the end of your pitiful scheme  As I live her fond fears have suspended her breath  And I've frighten'd the delicate creature to death  MISS JASPER  Never fear simple Charles you will not lose your wife  You understand marble much better than life  LADY SOPHIA  reviving  Where am IO pray Sir are you Mr Jasper  MISS JASPER  whispering her brother  In your arms you poor simpleton hasten to clasp her  If you stand so confounded how can you succeed  I shall presently think you a statue indeed  JASPER  to  Lady Sophia  How fare you dear Lady'tis true that you see  Your devoted affectionate Jasper in me  Of your beauty my heart has long felt the effect  In chaste admiration and tender respect  No licentious design with my passion could mingle  But the very first moment I heard you were single  All my foreign pursuits I resolv'd to disclaim  For your smiles are to me more attractive than fame  Though the wintry ocean was roaring between us  My love with fond hope in the favor of Venus  Bade me cross the rough deep and disdaining controul  Fly with speed to the distant delight of my soul  LADY SOPHIA  How like my Sir Simon in person and air  The mild turn of his lip and his eye to a hair  JASPER  O think not the likeness lies only in feature  I've his soul heart and passious my sweet lovely creature  In me then O fancy you see him restor'd  And with fondness connubial be lov'd and ador'd  Instead of a senseless cold image of stone  Make his living resemblance for ever your own  A soft statue of wax in your hand I will prove  You shall mold me to all the chaste fancies of love  LADY SOPHIA  I protest your idea is sweetly refin'd  To delight the pure warmth of a delicate mind  I could wish such a likeness to keep in my view  And for ever contemplate Sir Simon in you  But though the mere offspring of tender sensation  Such a wish would be reckon'd a gross inclination  And I'm sure I should die at that horrid suggestion  JASPER  embracing her  Dear angel no tongue shall thy purity question  LADY SOPHIA  O Charles to my bosom you give such a flutter  All my reasons against you I want breath to utter  JASPER  By the eloquent glance of that dear melting eye  With my delicate purpose I know you'll comply  MISS JASPER  Hush hush I have heard some one step near the door  Pray be still till the coast I can clearly explore  LADY SOPHIA  O my stars should my people discover at home  That by night I converse with a man in this dome  MISS JASPER  Haste away under ground you must quickly retreat  JASPER  taking up  Lady Sophia  in his arms  Come escape in my arms  LADY SOPHIA  Don't you feel my heart beat  JASPER  So does mine lovely creature my soul is on fire  LADY SOPHIA  But I never can yield to your sensual desire    Exit  Jasper  bearing off  Lady Sophia  down the subterranean staircase    CAREY  speaking without the great door of the Mausoleum  Miss Jasper Miss Jasper pray are you within  MISS JASPER  opening the door  Is it you Sir who make so uncivil a din  Pray what is the cause of this sudden intrusion  Have your Poets produc'd a new scene of confusion  CAREY  Gerrard says you have lock'd up the key of the 'Rack  So to give the Bards punch be so kind to come back  Come my dear  MISS JASPER  The deuce take your poetical potion  You have spoil'd my poor Lady's nocturnal devotion  How forgetful old Gerrard is suddenly grown  He has surely the key in some draw'r of his own  But you jestGet you goneI must hasten to her  CAREY  But without a few kisses indeed I shan't stir  MISS JASPER  Pishnonsensemake haste thenI've no time to spare  CAREY  Can't you give me some minutes my dear busy Fair  MISS JASPER  No in truth not a moment my hurry is great  Meet me here in the morning precisely at eight  make you some pleasing amends  AREY  though like lovers and friends  iss for my patience  SS JASPER  Goodnight  will bring wonders to light    Exeunt different ways  of ACT II  CT III  E I  The Mausoleum  with  Facil  laughing  knew an adventure so drole  TROPE  Facil pray tell me the whole  FACIL  tle calm breath I can draw  at the figure I saw  TROPE  What figure  FACIL  Why Rumble I now see him stand  With his garments halfbutton'd a scroll in his hand  And the poor frighted girl  TROPE  What the deuce do you mean  In an odd wanton frolic has Rumble been seen  To an Abigail's room did the old Bard repair  FACIL  No no I'll relate to you all the affair  You must know that our punch had so heated my brain  That to sleep half the night I endeavour'd in vain  But was just in a slumber between three and four  When a halfarray'd figure threw open my door  'Twas a poor trembling damsel who hastily said  "Rise rise or you'll surely be burnt in your bed"  And I heard Rumble's voice thrice repeat the word "Fire"  But as that dreadful word was soon follow'd by "Lyre"  I perceiv'd the good girl I now held by the arm  Had mistaken his verse for a cry of alarm  TROPE  Very goodhe has often these starts in the night  But how did you calm the poor girl in her fright  FACIL  The wild little wench like a poor frighted hare  Knew not which way to run and did nothing but stare  When holding the door of my chamber ajar  We perceiv'd by the aid of the bright morningstar  The old Bard who of liquor had taken his fill  Sally forth from his quarters in odd dishabille  With punch and with poetry heated he swaggers  And reels down the stairs like a horse in the staggers  Repeating with emphasis several times  The unfortunate word in his dangerous rhymes  And the girl who now saw her mistake very clear  Laugh'd in spite of her shame at the source of her fear  TROPE  And you I spppose when her terror was fled  Taught her bloom to revive by the warmth of your bed  FACIL  No indeed had her panic been only affected  I perhaps had been foolish as you have suspected  But her fear and her modesty both were so true  That they won my regard and she safely withdrew  TROPE  But where's our friend Rumble  FACIL  O nobody knows  TROPE  To some shady retreat he is gone to compose  FACIL  On the housetop perhaps like a bird he may sit  He considers keen air as a friend to his wit  It would not surprize me this phoenix to see  Oddly perch'd on a bough of an old lofty tree  For he thinks he writes best when he's nearest to heaven  But he'll soon want his breakfast'tis much after seven  TROPE  Hark what is that noise like the woodman's loud stroke  FACIL  As I live it is Rumble in yon shatter'd oak  Don't you see where he's sitting astride on the branch  He has crack'd that large limb by the weight of his paunch  TROPE  I believe he's asleepshall we give him a call  Lest he chance in his slumber to get a bad fall  FACIL  Never fearhere is one to take care of his life  Here's the nurse of our Brobdignag baby his wife  Enter  Mrs Rumble  hastily  MRS RUMBLE  Pray Gentlemen where is my dear Mr Rumble  I have news for you Poets to make you all grumble  But where is my husbandI seek him in haste  FACIL  Dear Ma'am we're surpriz'd that with singular taste  From the soft arms of Beauty he strangely has fled  To embrace the rough limbs of an oak in their stead  On that bough you may see him  MRS RUMBLE  Ah barbarous man  He will venture his life let me say what I can  I am sure some mischance will his genius o'erwhelm  T'other day he fell down from the top of an elm  Mr Rumble take careMr Rumble my dear  FACIL  In this case my dear Madam you've nothing to fear  Behold 'tis an incident only for mirth  For the bough gently falling consigns him to earth  MRS RUMBLE  I rejoice he is landed  Enter  Rumble  stretching himself and yawning  MRS RUMBLE  My dear Mr Rumble  It is well you have met with so easy a tumble  I wish that your fancy was not so romantic  All the people will think you are perfectly frantic  RUMBLE  Peace womanI care not for idle derision  I have had a superb elegiacal vision  Homer says with great truth "Onar ek dios esti"  MRS RUMBLE  On first waking my dear you are apt to be testy  But I'm glad if the Muse has been kind to your slumbers  And I hope we shall hear your mellifluous numbers  RUMBLE  In my dream I've compos'd and with clear continuity  Such emollient verse for the grief of viduity  'Twould have sooth'd the fad relict of old king Mausolus  MRS RUMBLE  In our passions the Nine may have charms to control us  But your Muse I'm afraid might as well have miscarried  For the lady you praise as a widow is married  RUMBLE  Peace woman you're crazy  FACIL  How married dear Madam  MRS RUMBLE  Ay married as sure as we're children of Adam  You know Sir rich folks with a licence have power  To marry without the canonical hour  And leaving her guests o'er their punch to carouse  My Lady at midnight receiv'd a new spouse  RUMBLE  Mrs Rumble I fear 'tis our punch that has bred  These nuptial phantasma's in your giddy head  Your story has nothing of concatenation  MRS RUMBLE  Mr Rumble you always will doubt my narration  But I deal not in fiction although a Bard's wife  On the truth of this secret I'd venture my life  From one of the housemaids I happen'd to worm it  And here comes a gentleman who will confirm it  Enter  Carey  MRS RUMBLE  Your voice Mr Carey will prove I am right  Pray was not her Ladyship married last night  CAREY  Dear Madam your question can hardly be serious  MRS RUMBLE  I am sure she was wed though the wedding's mysterious  CAREY  Do you really believe itdear Madam to whom  It must be to one of these Bards or a groom  For excepting ourselves and the men of her train  Not a male did this mansion last night entertain  But whence your conjecture on what is it grounded  RUMBLE  Silly woman I tell you your brain is confounded  But I think we may guess from your dream of this fact  How in widowhood you will be tempted to act  I suppose when I've finish'd my scene of mortality  However you sorrow in shew and verbality  You soon will renounce all your dignified gravity  And entic'd by some bellman's poetical suavity  Go to church with a fellow who deigns to rehearse  A quatrain on your charms in his annual verse  MRS RUMBLE  O you barbarous man by so cruel a jest  Would you wound the chaste love of so tender a breast  You know me too well to believe what you say  Thank my stars here's an evidence coming this way  And you'll see truth and justice are both on my side  Enter  Miss Jasper  MRS RUMBLE  hastily  Miss Jasper pray is not my Lady a Bride  MISS JASPER  You are right my dear Madam  CAREY  It cannot be real  MISS JASPER  From you Bards I request a sublime hymeneal  TROPE  So suddenly married  FACIL  You certainly joke  MISS JASPER  A word of more truth in my life I ne'er spoke  CAREY  What d'ye mean my dear Fanny pray do not deceive us  MRS RUMBLE  What infidels Madam they will not believe us  FACIL  Pray to what happy man may so fair a prize fall  MISS JASPER  The Bridegroom I'll soon introduce to you all  And you Poets I trust will a new string employ  With singular pleasure to echo his joy  RUMBLE  So my fine elegiacs are now out of season  I was mad to think woman a creature of reason  And on widowhood's slippery virtues to raise  The luminous fabric of rythmical praise  But I'll haste to be gone from this scene of fatuity  Come along Mrs Rumble I've done with viduity  My Lady may welcome more juvenile comers  I have no time to waste upon conjugal mummers  MISS JASPER  Mr Rumble pray stay in our joy to partake  MRS RUMBLE  Stay my dear Mr Rumble you'll stay for my sake  Though the grand and the gloomy is all your delight  I confess that festivity pleases my sight  Pray indulge me for onceit would half break my heart  Without seeing the Bridegroom were we to depart  RUMBLE  Curiosity ruin'd your grandmother Eve  And to gratify yours you shall not have my leave  From a farcical scene it is time we should go  And who plays the Jack Pudding I want not to know  MRS RUMBLE  My Lady may still wish your verse to peruse  RUMBLE  For Politics henceforth I give up the Muse  Though political paths may have some tortuosity  To enter on them I have less scrupulosity  Than to feed your vain sex with poetical flummery  And at last be the dupe of their amorous mummery  But I'll have my revenge and before my spleen cools  I will prove all the sexflattering poets are fools  Come away Mrs Rumbleyour duty's submission    Exit bearing off  Mrs Rumble  MISS JASPER  Poor woman I pity her dismal condition  And am griev'd that so roughly he makes her return  But here's one to console us for every concern  Enter  Jasper  MISS JASPER  To you my good friends I the Bridegroom present  And you all will rejoice in this happy event  CAREY  Dear Jasper o'erwhelm'd by this joyous surprize  I am almost afraid to believe my own eyes  Are you really return'd and in truth are you married  Has this excellent plan been so suddenly carried  Or with potent illusion and artful pretences  Has this fair little sorceress cheated our senses  JASPER  You may trust in her magic as honest and true  She has render'd me happy and so she will you  To you my dear Carey I give her for life  So enchanting a sister must prove a sweet wife  And with pleasure I add you'll receive your fair Bride  With the fortune she merits completely supplied  CAREY  Her heart in itself is an opulent dower  JASPER  to  Facil  and  Trope  My worthy old friends in this fortunate hour  It increases my joy to meet you on this spot  FACIL  I rejoice in your bliss  TROPE  I am charm'd with your lot  JASPER  And with double delight the good fortune I view  Which may prove I retain a warm friendship for you  I've a scheme for ye both my dear Facil and Trope  That will meet with your hearty concurrence I hope  You must yield to my wishI will not be denied  From any vain scruples of generous pride  FACIL  With hearts so enliven'd by seeing you blest  We shall hardly refuse whatsoe'er you request  JASPER  Though a few dainty whims of a singular kind  Have o'erclouded the worth of her excellent mind  The soul of my Lady Sophia is fraught  With the true mental pleasures of generous thought  She perceives and disclaims for the rest of her days  The foibles to which false refinement betrays  She now thinks this proud fabric of illapplied art  The ridiculous whim of too feeling a heart  Sir Simon had many calm virtues whose claim  From ungrateful Oblivion shall rescue his name  But all the distinctions of rank are confus'd  Fame herself is insulted and Art is abus'd  When the plume and the laurel insultingly wave  O'er the honest plain Merchant's preposterous grave  Convinc'd of this truth 'tis my Lady's design  To alter this dome on a new plan of mine  Here with Freedom and Ease you my friends may reside  Good apartments for each I shall quickly provide  For this dome where the Founder shall rise in a nich  Is to prove an asylum for artists not rich  CAREY  I am charm'd with your project dear Jasper  JASPER  Yet hear  By the will there's a fund of four hundred a year  Of real hard cash from incumbrances free  Which my Lady herself is to guide as trustee  To support any structure she chuses to plan  To perpetuate the name of her worthy good man  This between you dear Bards she is pleas'd to adjust  And when opulent Honesty sinks in the dust  May his heirs ever use what he leaves upon earth  In securing calm comfort to Genius and Worth  FACIL  We always have said and your actions evince  You Jasper were born with the soul of a prince  But our gratitude how shall we utter to you  JASPER  By returning your thanks where they chiefly are due  My Lady's pure bounty that scorns to be stinted  Surpast in your favour whatever I hinted  To prove that I wed not from motives of pelf  I have settled her wealth on her generous self  She is rich and intends to make use of her treasure  In the purchase of noble and permanent pleasure  At the highest of interest our gold we employ  When it brings a return of benevolent joy  Thank my stars all my wishes are crown'd with success  Kind Fortune I just now have learn'd by express  Outruns in our favor the slow step of Law  Old Vellum alarm'd by our hints of a flaw  In the base legal work that Fraud led him to frame  The reversion he stole has propos'd to disclaim  Upon terms which I now for tranquillity's sake  At my Lady's request shall be willing to take  But come my good friends let us haste to the hall  Where the Bride will be happy to welcome you all  CAREY  Well my friend I confess in the course of my life  I have oft been provok'd with your new lovely wife  But for this her last act her late whims I forgive  And shall bless the kind creature as long as I live  You will teach as you mold her to life's sweetest duty  All her virtues to shine as complete as her beauty  And may each childless widow in youth's lively state  Who has yielded an honest old husband to fate  In a partner like you find the surest relief  And to sensible joy turn fantastical grief  FINIS  BOOKS  printed for  T CADELL  in the  Strand  POEMS and Plays by William Hayley  Esq  in Quarto  The Art of
