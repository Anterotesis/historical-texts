broke by little hills between which rush irregular cascades these are again broke by the appearance of some cot∣tages which are distributed in perspective to the very farthest distance the distance consists of moun∣tains covered with snow near the cottages are little groups of evergreens under one of the hills is a small vineyard and in the front is a kind of outhouse where  Blaise Guillot Renette Jeannotte  and other villagers are discovered with a press bas∣kets of grapes and other materials for making wine Afterwards  La Piere  CHORUS  PRESS the wine press the wine  Our annual harvest is begun  Red as a rose  The liquor flows  And shortly we shall drink the wine  To chear our hearts when labour's done  'Tis the right body strong and rough  Let us the hogsheads fill  Come neighbour come you've work'd enough  Now let me take a spill  Blaise  Guillot nephew Guillot thou standest as idle why do'st not take away the husks of the old grapes and bring a fresh basket to put in the press we shan't get done Thou forgettest I suppose that tomorrow is to be our wineharvest  Guil  No I don't uncle Blaise nor that I am to be married to Jeannotte neither and that's better still  Blaise  Well well business first and pleasure af∣terwards Guillot    La Pierre  comes on  Servant good peoplePray can any of you tell me which is the way to the cottage of Master Blaise  Blaise  I am Master Blaise my friend what would'st thou please to have  La P  A lucky rencounter my friend the Mar∣quis De Bellemine and his Lady who stopped here some months ago in their way to Italy are now hard by in their carriage and have very earnest business with you  Ren  O husband as sure as you are alive they are come to take away Adelaide from us  La P  Oh what that's your pretty Shepherdess of the Alps that we have heard so much talk aboutNo no friend 'tis a different sort of a story I can tell you that  Blaise  Ay what is it pray  La P  A shocking affair friend a shocking af∣fairthey have lost their only son and are now in search after him that's all  Ren  Mercy dear that's sad indeedHusband don't let them wait in the coach  Blaise  Wait in the coach no not for the world Wife Renette do you

Set abroach the best barrel and take special care  To polish the table and set the arm chair  And wife above all do you mind mestay stay  Dear me now what was I a going to say  Oh nothingnow  Guillot  why child thou stand'st still  Run quickly to  Adelaide  she's on yonder hill  Tell her that's a good lad she must instant come home  For the gentlefolks once more to see us are come  She'll know who you mean grand madam and sir  And there's none of us fit to receive them but her  That's all prithee go now don't stand like an elf  And  Jeannotte  do youno I'll do that myself  We've enough to employ uspray go if you please  We must all be as busy as so many bees  SCENE II  Guillot Jeannotte Renette  who presently goes off  Guil  I'cod my uncle's in a woundy hurry he has forgot his grapes and his wine now  Ren  Ay ay and no wonder go child and call Adelaide Jeannotte do you come along with me  goes off  Ican  I'll follow you directly well Guillot why don't you go and do what you were bid  Guil  I'cod I am afraid  Ican  Afraid of what  Guil  Of you  Ican  Of me  Guil  Yes of you don't I know very well you'd be as jealous as fury about it  Ican  Who's fault's that en't you always smirking up to her and saying soft things in her ear do you think I don't take notice of your oglings and leer∣ings  Guil  Me ogle and leer I wish I may die when∣ever she comes near me if I don't run away from her as fast as my legs can carry me no no I thank you I likes peace and quietness a little too much for that  Ican  Why then if I do scold you it's all be∣cause I can't bear to see an upstart creature come from nobody knows where  Guil  Why for the matter of that Jeannotte everybody says she must be a gentlewoman by distrac∣tion  Ican  Everybody says Yes everybody says a fine pack of nonsense about her education and her manners and her beauty I should be sorry indeed if she was the only beauty in the village  bridling  Guil  I'cod I don't know whether she's handsome or ugly you always takes care that I shan't look at her enough for that  Ican  Yes indeed you thinks 'tis very easy to blind me I suppose you don't intend to look at her neither when you go to call her home  Guil  Why if you are afraid of it you had better go and call her yourself  Ican  Shall I Guillot And do you forgive me Guillot for being so hasty  Guil  I can't say I do quite Jeannotte and so what signifies lying  sullen  Ican  But I have no cause to be jealous have I  Guil  Why lord you know you have not as well as I do  Ican  Give me your hand then and we'll make it all up  Guil  Nay as to that we'll kiss and be friends if you will  AIR  Jean  When jealous out of season  When deaf and blind to reason  Of truth we've no belief  With rage we're overflowing  Not why or whether knowing  And the heart goes throb with grief  II  But when the fit is over  And kindness from the lover  Does ev'ry doubt destroy  Away fly thoughts alarming  Each object appears charming  And the heart goes throb with joy  SCENE III  Guillot  Guil  Ay 'tis all very well but I know in half an hour's time 'twill be just as bad again lord lord what a fine life I am likely to lead with her to be sure she is the best girl in the world if she was not so confounded jealous I'cod I don't know what 'tis for I am not so handsome as I knows of and then she talks of loving me so plaguely hang me if one  might not as well be hated as scolded from morning 'till night If I could but hit of a way to cure her of it I was thinking that suppose I made love to Adelaide out of a joke but then lord she'd never listen to me what put it in my head was there's a mad comical sort of a young gentleman has been plaguing me these two days to sell him the stock that father left me because he wants to turn shepherd and I have heard them say that money is no bad thing to go a courting with well we shall see but here comes the gentleman of the gentlefolks I'll be gone  SCENE IV  Guillot La Piere  La P  Here stop young man I want to speak to you you are going to call the shepherdess en't you  Guil  No Sir our Jeannotte's gone  La P  I am damn'd sorry for that I wanted to see her and pray has this blazing star been long upon your meridian  Guil  Star Sir  La P  Dam'me there's no lowering one's self to the comprehension of these brutes to speak in your lan∣guage then has this young woman been long in these parts  Guil  I believe it's about two years Sir  La P  And she really is as divinely handsome as she is reported to be  Guil  Why as to that I can't say  La P  I can't say the clown you must shew her to me I am in love with her by reputation  Guil  I'cod 'tis my belief she has another guess sort of a reputation than that tho'  La P  That what my friend I don't under∣stand you  Guil  Why then to fall in love with such folks as you and I  La P  That's pleasant by Heaven my friend you are deceiv'd I believe there is some little distance between you and I  Guil  'Tis my opinion there is saving respect for you have got a master and I am master for myself no offence I hope  La P  No friend your ignorance is your protec∣tion What I suppose you take me for one of the followers of the old people if so I must tell you that I have the honour to be in some sort a companion of the Abbé de la Mouche famous for his elegance and taste for his amours for his poetry and for his new constructed comb for the eyebrows  Guil  Ho ho ho Lord that must be a comical thing ho ho ho  La P  Ho ho ho the natural The Abbé I say being on a visit at their house came with them this way partly in search after their son who we un∣derstand has taken the road to France and partly like me out of curiosity to see this wonderful creature whose praises they have done nothing but din in our ears ever since they saw her  Guil  Ah likely enough  La P  This sir is the way I happened to be in company with the marquis and his lady who are by  all that's whimsical the most fantastical the most contrary and the most ridiculous couple that ever yoked together in the shackles of matrimony and as if they were not absurd enough of themselves they have brought with them that walking tombstone Count Triste who has cried a whole fortnight for the death of a wife that any other man would have given half his estate to get rid of and who like other tomb∣stones is continually telling the world of beauties and virtues that the deceased never possessed But here comes the marquis and his lady  Guil  And uncle along with them I'cod I'll get out of the way or I shall have it for not going after Adelaide  Going  La P  But hear me young man I want you I tell you to introduce me to this fine creature  Guil  Me sir  La P  YesYou'll tell her that I am as you see a genteel young fellow and that  AIR  Guil  I guesses in part what it is you'd be at  Make me what your master makes you  But I'm none of your panders I answer you flat  So you see my good friend it won't do  Ev'ry man to his tradeDid I flatter and prate  And make speeches and congé and bow  'Twould be just all as one with that fine powder'd pate  As to set you to work at the plow  II  Besides and moreover I told you before  'Tis another guess sort of a she  A sensible one who would set little store  By two such poor ninnies as we  You thought that a clown would not dare to say nay  But you have not found me such an elf  So if to the young woman you've ought for to say  You are likely to tell her yourself  SCENE V  Marquis Marchioness and Blaise  Marque  Don't tell me I'll never be comforted he's dead nay I am sure you know it and conceal it from me  Marq  Zounds my dear you won't hear reason for my part so far from thinking as you do I look upon this little exploit as a smart spirited thing What the devil a young fellow with good clothes on his back and money in his pocket lost or deadA pack of nonsense  Marque  Why should he fly from us thenFrom me in particularso indulgent a mother  Marq  Oh my dear boys when they come to be towards twenty think of something else besides in∣dulgent mothers Take my word for it he is after some wench  Marque  Oh the very thoughts of it would make me die with confusion  Marq  Why what the devil would you always  tie him to your apronstring no no I hope my boy has too much of my blood in him for that  Marques  Yonder comes the Abbé  Marq  Damn the coxcomb what did you bring him with you for fire and water are not more oppo∣site than him and me I am a Roman of the time of the commonwealth and he is an Italian of the present age a fellow all pomatum and pulvilio we should have been here three hours sooner if I could have got him away from his damned toilet  Marques  Dear Marquis don't talk such stuff now  Marq  Nay only let me draw his picture a little after combing his eyebrows and laying his rouge he threw himself into an arm chair took three sorts of snuff out of the same snuffbox sneezed into a white silk handkerchief wiped his mouth with a pink one got up looked in the glass bridled whirled about upon his heel and then answered the salutation of good morrow which I had given before all this cere∣mony began  Marques  Heavens how can you  Marq  This done I had a second impertinence to go through he made me listen to the contents of his whole pate folio such a cargo of sonnets epigrams lampoons and pasquinades enough to furnish out a balladsinging Savoyard at a Dutch fair However you was determined to bring your Abbé and I have brought my Count we travel in a great stile we have each of us a fool  Marques  Your's is a fool indeed with his odious grief for his wife who was neither amiable nor hand∣some and who never loved him  Marq  Oh dam'me I would have him 'twas impossible to come all this way without some amuse∣ment what with your lamentations for your son his superficial cry and the Abbé's supercilious laugh you make a devilish good trio but here comes the Abbé  Marquis Marchioness Blaise Abbé  Abbé  My dear Marchioness I have a million of par∣dons to intreat of you but it was impossible to quit the carriage till I had adjusted myself a little my rouge was so rubbed about my face that my cheeks were as sal∣low as the Countess of Hypocondria's and my forehead and nose as red as the Marquis of Burgundy's who lives upon swallowing pint bumpers besides I was struck on the way by the most beautiful idea for a pas∣toral poem  Marques  My dear Abbé I am so unhappy about my son I have no leisure to reflect on any thing else  Abbé  Don't make yourself uneasy madam the moment we get among the polite circles at Paris I shall circulate a little poetical hue and cry through the hands of the most distinguished characters and your lost sheep will be instantly found I dare swear but you promised to introduce me to this shepherdess  Marq  Introduce you what the devil should she in∣troduce you for to frighten her Why what with your little black cloak your feathers in your hat and your wings at your ears she'll take you for some strange bird of prey going to fly away with one of her lambs Zounds if Cato and Caesar could give a look at Rome in its present state  Abbé  They would find it filled sir with men of elegance politeness and taste  Marq  Foppery luxury and effeminacy Would any body believe this osier twig was the produce of the same clime where grew so many sturdy oaks How manners change Those were the times when a vete∣ran pinned against a tree would destroy you fourteen or sixteen of his enemies with his own proper hand but now dam'me if I should not like to see what a fi∣gure you'd cut pinned against a tree  AIR  How unlike to these fops were our fathers of old  Brave manly heroic intrepid and bold  Who had spirits like fire and of health such a stock  That their pulse struck the seconds as true as a clock  Without bridle or saddle who'd mount on a nag  And kill'd before sunrise a boar or a stag  Who hunger provok'd by the keen wholesome air  Would eat you for breakfast a pound of a bear  But a fine mincing modern comes into the room  A lump of pulvilio a walking perfume  In his tricks and his shape  A direct human ape  Who ogles and flushes  And simpers and blushes  And patches and paints  And expires and faints  And stammers and trips  Takes snuff bites his lips  Lisps coughs and lolls  But to cut the thing short  Our men now at court  Are nothing but so many sixpenny dolls  Abbé  Savage and barbarous the antients are only fit to be made subjects of my satires and odes a de∣lightful people to copy after to be sure  Marq  They were the only people to copy after they were manly and brave friendly and generous they were strangers to luxury their meals were fru∣gal and what nature required and their dress was made for use and not for ornament  Abbé  Their meals Why the best cook they ever had was not capable of making a  sauce robert  I ridi∣culed them for it in my little Impromptu written at the bottom of Corregio's picture where Ajax invites Aga∣memnon to dinner upon a boiled bull and as to the rest they had neither spoons nor forks nor table cloths nor napkins they eat with their fingers like their forefather Adam and wiped them upon their beards like Methusalem  Marq  Very well Mr Fop  Abbé  No no Marquis our buildings our orna∣ments our dress our eating are so many refine∣ments that do honour to the present age and horridly expose the ignorance of our ancestors  Marq  All this may be true in the language of fop∣pery but in the language of common sense in your buildings and ornaments you have exchanged solid for superficial your dress has metamorphosed the hu∣man species into apes and monkeys and as to your repasts you have inverted the seasons to procure eat∣ables without their natural flavour and all your im∣provements have only taught you to have peas and strawberries at Christmas and melons and pineapples in despight of nature  Abbé  Go on Sir 'twill only serve as minutes for my next pasquinade  Marq  As for you you are out of measure ridicu∣lous you thought you could not sufficiently disgrace your family which is truly antient and noble by imitating the other fashionable follies and extrava∣gancies but you must get into the church be made an Abbé one of that mongrel kind of animals who now indeed swarm all over the world half clergyman half coxcomb  Abbé  Well Marquis we had better not dispute for I fancy we shall never agree At present I be∣lieve the Marchioness wishes to repose herself there∣fore good man if you'll shew us your place we shall be obliged to you  Blaise  To be sure Sir if your honour pleases  Abbé  And then my dear Madam you shall intro∣duce me to the Shepherdess  SCENE VI  Marquis  and  Count  Mar  Those are your nobles of the present times if my son had nothing more noble about him he should not catch me scampering the devil knows where over the Alps after him in compliment to any wife in the world bur here comes a coxcomb of ano∣ther kind a fellow who cries for his wife with one eye and leers at every girl he meets with the other I shall divert myself with him or I am mistaken What still unhappy Count Zounds man I thought this journey would have diverted you  Count  Ah I told you Marquis what a wretched companion I should make for you  Marq  Come come you must shake off your chag∣rin consider you are going to see the lovely Shepher∣dess of the Alps and would you visit your mistress with a face a yard long  Count  Mistress lord Marquis how you rattle me think of a mistress indeed who have so lately lost such a treasure my poor dear Ah thou best of wives when shall I ever see thy fellow  Marq  I tell you this Shepherdess is her very pic∣ture has every trace of her from the cast of her eye to the mole upon her left cheek that people used to take for a black patch  Count  Captivating ornament  Marq  She has I assure you in short I am de∣termin'd you shall see her your sorrow preys too much upon you and the only way to forget one wo∣man is to make love to another  Count  Do you think so  Marq  I am sure of it  Count  Why this grief is very terrible without doubt and if there was any way to cure itbut then how could I expect any woman would listen to me broke down as I am by affliction  Marq  Not listen to you damn it don't talk to me in that stile don't I remember when you and I went to Venice  Count  What upon the road the lovely Brunetta who played upon the mandilina  Marq  Ah rogue  Count  I shall never forget her what eyes  Marq  What teeth  Count  Pearl  Marq  What cheeks  Count  Roses  Marq  With the dew upon them when she cried at parting from you eh Count  Count  Oh never was man so happy  Marq  Where was the Countess then  Count  Alas poor soul she little thought I was wronging her but my sins are punished for she is taken away from me and I shall never be happy any more  Marq  Yes you will Come come prepare your∣self to see this wonder she'll wound you deeper than the Brunetta did  Count  No no I won't think of it melancholy shall be my only mistress nor shall I expect relief but in the cold tomb Are you going to see her now  Marq  Presently  Count  Well adieuI'll find out some corner where I may indulge my misery  Going  And so she resembles my poor deceased dear  returns  I should like just to see her  Marq  You shall not only see her but have her in your arms  Count  What and press her to my bosomNo no don't talk so  Marq  You shall I tell youThe charming tempting heavenly  Count  Yielding creaturehey Marquis  Marq  Ay this is something like zounds  think of blubbering and crying and yet to say the truth I don't wonder at it for women make us just what they please  SCENE VII  Count  Count  He's very right they do make us just what they please indeed  AIR  There's something in women their lovers engage  Of whatever complexion or stature or age  And she who would frighten a mere standerby  Is a Venus herself in the fond lover's eye  If she's pale never swan was a tenth part so fair  If tawny like jet are her eyes and her hair  If Xantippe herself her scolding's thought wit  If meek all good wives to their husbands submit  II  If a pigmy how neat are her air and her mien  If a steeple she's graceful and walks like a queen  If a girl in her teens all's handsome that's young  If eighty her fortune saysWorld hold your tongue  In short to dear women 'tis given to please  And tho' the whim often should take them to teaze  To perplex to torment and a thousand things more  They're the deities men were all born to adore  SCENE VIII  Guillot  and  Young Bellemine  Guil  Indeed sir 'tis a very foolish thing and I would not have you think any more of it  Y B  That's my affair Guillot  Guil  Unless I sell you my cottage and sheep in short all my stock you shall be unhappyI don't understand it for my part  Y B  And yet Guillot 'tis very true  Guil  What a whim sir under favourA gen∣tleman as you seem to be rich and wellborn to come here and keep sheep  Y B  What would you have me say to you'Tis for my pleasureI come to taste at a distance from the town that happiness which heaven has in store for you The candour that reigns in your eyes convin∣ces me your happy days are the charming image of the golden age To know love is to know happiness 'tis in the woods he is born the humblest estate is for me the sweetest and your's seems the retreat of innocence and tranquillity  Guil  For me who am a shepherd I swear to you that our lives have some good moments but it's hard it's hard  Y B  I know all this Guillot and yet I persist  Guil  Well I can't help it Sir I must not con∣sent to it What would our neighbours sayTo be sure if I had a mind nobody could furnish you with better things for your purpose than Ilet me seeI have abut no no no I can't think of itServant Sir  going  Y B  Nay Guillot pray come back I'll give you a handsome price for your things  Guil  No no sir 'tis not that I dare say you have money enough and no doubt but you would part with it in a gentlemanlike way and as I said before if things were agreeable I don't know any body could match you better than I but Lord on∣ly consider 'tis wrong sir 'tis indeed how many sheep did you please to want  Y B  I'll buy all you have  Guil  All I have oh no I could not spare you all I have besides what should you buy any for  Y B  Well but Guillot  As they are disputing the symphony begins  AIR  Guil  I've twenty sheep now in the fold  Twelve ewes eight weathers one year old  Y B  For those same sheep a hundred crowns  Guil  Oh zounds  Y B  Nay nay  Guil  I won't I say  Y B  Sho sho  Guil  No no  Sir 'tis too much you're wrong you're wrong  Y B  I tell you Guillot hold your tongue  Guil  Well if it must be so it must  You'll say 'twas forc'd on me I trust  Y B  My friend you really are too nice  A hundred crowns 'tis just the price  Come come go on  Guil  I'd rather not  Y B  Nay prithee be not such a sot  Guil  My cottage neat as e'er you saw  Thatch'd but last autumn with new straw  Y B  Well well for that two hundred crowns  Guil  Oh zounds  c  Guil  Why you'll take all  Y B  'Tis my design  And for your clothes I'll give you mine  Guil  The village all would say 'twas pride  Y B  Come Guillot what have you beside  Guil  Why I've a faithful dog as true  But he'll be of no use to you  Y B  Well for the dog I'll give ten crowns  Guil  Oh zounds  c  SCENE Almost the same View differently distri∣buted on one Side is a Hill at the Bottom of the Hill an old Oak and at the Foot of the Oak a kind of rustic Tomb  Adelaide  is discovered seated  Here my afflicted mind nourishes its pain I cry and I am comforted 'twas here I saw my husband here alas I kept him from the battle here he bid me adieu here I waited his return here being dis∣honoured  lost without resource he seized the mo∣ment while I had fallen senseless at the news to take away that life which I had rendered odious and Oh cruel and tender remembrance 'twas here I built his tomb but what flock moves this way I never before saw the shepherd who conducts them I'll turn aside to avoid his presence  SCENE IX  Bellemine  AIR  Y Bell  By love and fortune guided  I quit the busy town  With cot and sheep provided  And vestments of a clown  Thus have I barter'd riches  For a shepherd's little stock  A crook to leap o'er ditches  And well to climb each rock  A faithful dog my steps to guide  A scrip and hautboy by my side  And my horn to give the alarm  When wolves would harm  My flock  II  Ah say then who can blame me  For beauty 'tis I roam  But if the chace should tame me  Perhaps I may come home  'Till then I'll give up riches  c  At last I am a shepherd how many contending sensations do I feel ah finish love let me behold her the report alone of whose charms induced me to leave my country and my family Beautiful and touching Adelaide perhaps thou wilt listen to a timid shepherd when thou wouldst startle at the voice of love alas the god thou fliest is my guide but let me rather seek occasion to do her kindness than sur∣prize her too abruptly yonder she is I cannot be mistaken I'll watch upon her steps for ever but I'll find out some way to oblige her  He retires  SCENE X  Adeliade Young Bellemine  behind  Ade  He is gone and I am irresistibly drawn again towards this spot  Y Bel  Gods what an angel  Ade  Hark here's some one coming  Y Bel  Shall I speak to her  coming forward  Here comes that fool Guillot I must step aside or he'll dis∣cover me Gods what an angel  goes off  SCENE XI  Adelaide Guillot Jeannotte  Ade  Heaven defend me what do I see who is that Guillot  Jean  Yes 'tis Guillot out of his senses Guillot grown rich in short Guillot who so loved me yester∣day today hates me worse than poison  Ade  What's the meaning of all this how came you so fine Guillot  Guil  Another gentleman and I changed clothes that's all  Ade  But why does your finery make you despise Jeannotte  Guil  For a very good reason I intends to make love  Ade  Alas Guillot broken vows and inconstancy will never recommend you to me  Guil  Oh lord I shan't be falsehearted to you a bit I always had a sort of a sneaking for you only I thought when I was but a poor shepherd you'd turn up your nose at me I hardly believe you will now though  Jean  Did any body ever hear such a wretch I'll tear your eyes out and I'll tear her eyes out and I won't suffer it so I won't  Guil  How will you do to help yourself you see Mrs Jeannotte what your jealousy has brought you to and so no more words if Adelaide will have me I'll have her  Ade  This love then which is said to be so sweet makes everywhere unhappiness If it is dangerous for shepherds for whom is it harmless  AIR  Chorus  Alas they say how sweet is love  And talk of joys that lovers prove  'Tis folly madness all and rage  Its joy's an hour its pain an age  Ade  Come come be friends I see the truth  This is some quarrel  Guil  No forsooth  'Tis honest earnest  Jean  What again  Thou art the basest of all men  I cannot bear it so I can't  Ade  Come come dry up her tears  Guil  I shan't  I've said my mind and I say still  If I can get your kind good will  I'll marry you tonight  Jean  Oh dear  Such unkind usage who can bear  Cho  Alas  c  Ade  Plainly friend  Guillot  hear me speak  Those who their vows of love can break  Each promise false each oath a lie  As from an adder would I fly  Guil  I say you take not the thing right  She's cross and scolds from morn till night  That all the neighbours cry out shame  Ade  If that's the case then she's to blame  Sweetness and gentleness should move  Alone to a return of love  But if 'tis owing to her fears  Lest she should lose you dry her tears  Guil  Not I indeed  Jean  There now see there  Guil  I've neither for her love nor care  And if you'll have me not d'ye see  Another mayall's one to me  Jean  I'll bear't no longer perjur'd wretch  Guil  There there you see it was no fetch  Cho  Alas  c  They go off at the End of the Trio different Ways  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The same View that was seen at the be∣ginning of the first Act  Young Bellemine  I'VE watched till I have lost myself but how to accost herhow to manage the timidity of this so∣litary beautyif she is unhappy her heart will have need of consolation After all we seem as if we were alone in the universe and shall be every thing to each other If we converse we shall not be far from friendship and friendship at our age oft changes into love but she is here If I am right in my observa∣tion she has already some curiosity concerning me I'll draw aside and endeavour to heighten it by ming∣ling with her song the sound of my hautboy  SCENE II  Adelaide  Ade  The nightingale gives me his wonted evening salutation and as I return with my flock answers my sighs with a sweet complaining song  she sings  Sweet melancholy bird again  Hautboy plays  Heavens what do I hear a hautboy accompanies me 'tis the shepherd who leads his sheep to feed at the foot  of the mountain  Hautboy again  A shepherdlet us listen  again  'tis an enchantment is it possible to believe that sentiment alone can be so faithful a guide who will dare after this to say that taste is the fruit of a slow culture It seems as if fortune pitied me and sent this shepherd as a new echo to answer to my griefs  AIR  Sweet melancholy bird again  As thou art wont at every eve  My hopeless sorrow in soft strain  Ah echo to me and relieve  Alas to answer my sad woe  Insympathy all nature grieves  The rivers seem with tears to flow  The zephyr sighs amidst the leaves  Ade  A shepherd this but hold the Marquis of Bellemine is in search after his only son it must be so but here he comes his air his manner his ad∣dress all confirm me in my suspicions I'll speak to him oh how I shall bless this accident if I can con∣sole this unfortunate pair  SCENE III  Adelaide Young Bellemine  Ade  Do you lead your sheep far from hence shep∣herd  Y B  I don't lead them at all they go themselves to the pastures which they love  Ade  You are not of these parts then  Y B  No  Ade  Nor as it should seem born to be a shep∣herd  Y B  Since I am one doubtless I was born to be so I know not where I am  Aside  Ade  He seems troubled and as if fearful of being betrayed 'tis surely as I guessed no no your air your language all convince me that heaven designed you a more favourable lot  Y B  Why should you think so 'twould be as rea∣sonable for me to believe the same thing of you you have the air of an inhabitant of the woods and yet in that estate I see you but nature is the mother of shepherds as well as kings and sometimes with a light and fa∣vouring hand bestows talents and graces on the simple and timid shepherd as the object of her choice The flowers which are born in the country want no cul∣ture nor have the birds that sing so sweetly any lessons but those of nature  Ade  I am convinc'dyou would deceive me I tell you The art with which you animated the hautboy in a simple inhabitant of the woods would indeed be a rare prodigy  Y B  'Tis your voice tis the prodigy in a simple shepherdess  Insinuating  Ade  What has instructed you  Y B  My heart and my ear You sing I am ra∣vished and my tractable hautboy longs to answer you is this art difficult Alas to explain what one feels costs nothing when one has sensibility and tender∣ness to form enchanting sounds one has only to hear you 'twas that struck me with admiration and my mouth and my hautboy were inspired by my mind  Ade  But you expressed sadness  Y B  Because you inspired it take a laughing air and I'll play an allegro  Ade  No these places were not made for vain and frivolous joy complaints and sighs only are found here  Y B  Let me then sigh with you  Tenderly  Ade  Alas I penetrate his designs and must prevent them Are you then unhappy  Y B  What if I am  Ade  Perhaps then heaven has sent you that we may console each other but there must be a mutual con∣fidence At sunrise tomorrow let me find you at the foot of that oak where first you heard me sigh there my heart will I lay open to your eyes but you must leave me now  Y B  I obey Tomorrow at sunrise my impa∣patience overcomes me Oh how I shall count each moment  AIR  O Time no more shall it be said  Thy pond'rous wings are tip'd with lead  If pitying a lover's sorrow  Thou'lt haste and quickly bring tomorrow  Love overpowers me  Impatience devours me  I dread yet long to see this spot  Alike in turn  I freeze and burn  And fear and wishI know not what  SCENE IV  Adelaide  Thus I shall be sure of rendering him to his friends no no I no longer entertain a doubt that under this shepherd's habit I have seen the young Marquis of Bel∣lemine Guillot's appearance every thing confirms it but whence does it arise no matter whence every thing adds to my unhappiness his design is but too evident and he'll join his intreaties with theirs to reconcile me to the worldineffectual endeavours  AIR  The little bark may safely ride  Where neither rocks nor quicksands lie  But driven to sea by wind and tide  As swift as swallows skim the sky  The horror of the foaming main  The lightning's glare the thunder's roar  Give little prospect that again  Poor bark shall ever reach the shore  SCENE V  Scene continues  Marquis Abbé  Marq  Well Abbé I accept your proposal I'll sign articles of peace immediately if you'll enter into a treaty to shew off the Count  Abbé  And you promise for the future not to find fault either with my dress or manners  Marq  You may use nineteen perfumes to as many pocket handkerchiefs and take out forty toothpicks at one dinner time without my saying a word nay I'll even praise your poetry and I am sure that's sa∣crifice enough in all conscience  Abbé  I'm satisfied  Marq  To business then the Count has been teaz∣ing me to introduce him to the shepherdess  Abbé  Him a brute He'd be as ridiculous as the bear in my fable that makes love to the panther  Marq  Listen to me you must know I have been out upon the search for I like I confess to look at a fresh country girl and I have found one the very thing to pass upon the Count  Abbé  An admirable thought curse poison me the very episode to my little Serenata I made the fellows act so often after Goldoni's Comedies  Marq  And to make it impossible that he should know the true from the counterfeit I have got the good man Blaise to accommodate him and you at the cottage of one of his neighbours so there's no fear of his encountering Adelaide  Abbe  But Marquis are not you afraid the girl her∣self will discover who she is  Marq  Not at all I understand she has been ill used by some fellow who was to have married her and I have advised her to snap up the Count out of revenge and instructed her how to behave at the first interview  Abbé  Excellentissimo damnato di mio poetical justice in every conception  Marq  But here he comes remember our first at∣tack is to see how extravagant we can make him by extolling the Countess to the skies  SCENE VI  Marquis Abbé Count  Count  Dear Marquis what has become of you 'tis cruel to leave me to myself in such distress  Marq  But my dear friend you must take comfort  Count  No no Marquis there's no comfort for me  Marq  I grant you the Countess was a most divine creature  Count  Don't mention her  Marq  What grace what spirit what gaiety  Count  Had not she oh oh oh  cries  Abbé  I shall never forget how most incessantly she laughed at my lampoon upon the Friar that we persuaded to go to the play in a domino  Count  Did she oh oh oh what an irreparable loss  Abbé  Particularly the description of the old fellow when his false frizure fell off ha ha ha  Marq  Ha ha ha to see his bald pate  Count  I remember something of it peeping up above his blue silk domino with gold frogs  Marq  True true ha ha ha  Count  He must cut a ridiculous figure ha ha ha  Abbé  Damn'd ridiculous  they all laugh together  Count  finishing the laugh  ha ha haaa ah I don't wonder that my poor dear should laugh at it oh  sighs  what shall I do  Marq  I wish we could console you  Count  No I'll never be consoled every thing calls her to my mind every body admired her  Abbé  What admirable talents  Marq  How charmingly she played upon the harp∣sichord  Count  Astonishingly oh oh oh  Abbé  Especially the cantata I wrote her her judg∣ment and finger were petrifying strike me ridiculous  Marq  How she sung  Count  Oh delightful oh oh oh  Marq  One song in particular  Count  Ah what was that I remember all  Marq  Let me see 'twas in one of the operas  Abbé  Caro amore  Marq  The very thing  Count  Ah she did sing it delightfully indeed  Marq  Do you remember her manner Abbé  Abbé  I'll try  sings ridiculously  Marq  Oh that was not at all like it  Count  Not a bit not a bit she glided over the pas∣sages ah  sighing  Abbé  Thus  sings more ridiculously  Count  No no I'm out of patience with you this was it  sings in a feigned voice  Marq  Bravo bravo  Abbé  Exquisitissimo  Count  Stop I have not done  finishes with a can∣tabile  Abbé  Charming  Marq  Enchanting no dam'me there's nothing in the world could make a man amends for the loss of a woman who could sing in that manner  Count  No my friends there is nothing in this world worth my notice  Marq  'Tis very true merit like this was irre∣sistible I am ready to cry myself when I think of your situation  Count  'Tis friendly of you my dear Marquis  Marq  'Tis terrible to lose so many united accom∣plishments for we have not half mentioned themShe sung divinely to be sure but she danced  Abbé  I remember it may rosewater poison me but she was grace itself her minuet was the most de∣lightful thing I remember I wrote her a litttle com∣plimentary trifle on it called "Venus in the Fourth Position"  Count  O charming  Marq  Very true and then to see her swim an al∣lemande I remember she had one particular trip that was beautifully elegantlet me seehow was itGive me your hand Abbé  He sings an allemande and they dance ridiculously  Count  No don't distract me so prayOh dear you are not right at all you  bouree  what you should  chassé  Marq  Pardon me I know very well what I am about  singing and dancing  The head upright  singing and dancing  The body thrown gracefully for∣ward  Count  Zounds 'tis no more like herGive me your hand Abbé  Count sings and dances about 'till he falls quite out of breath upon a bank  Oh oh oh what can ever make me amends for the loss of her  Marquis  to the Abbé  Yonder's my counterfeit shep∣herdess do you begone  Abbé  Well Count I shall find you I must speak to my fellow  Count  Adieu Abbé  Abbé  Adieutake care you don't make out the little ballad I wrote upon the road  Count  What about inconstancyno there's no danger of that  Abbé  Take care that's allIt runs thus you know  AIR  The rising sun Lysander found  Shedding tears o'er Phillis's tomb  Who swore he ne'er would leave the ground  But pass his life in that dear gloom  Tearing his hair the frantic youth  Cried "food and raiment I deny  And with my life shall end my truth  For love of Phillis will I die"  II  The radiant god made half his tour  The kine sought shelter from his heat  Which pass'd within the cottage door  Where poor Lysanderdrank and eat  His dinner finish'd up he rose  Stalk'd sighing silently and slow  To where were hung his Sundays clothes  Then took a walk to chace his woe  III  The sun to Thetis made his way  When underneath a friendly shade  A shepherd sung in accents gay  His passion for a gentle maid  O lovers what are all your cares  Your sighs your sufferings tell me what  To Daphne 'tis Lysander swears  And lovely Phillis is forgot  SCENE VII  Marquis Count  Marq  I am glad he's gone the troublesome fool  Count  Tiresome to a degree well my dear Marquis have you seen the Shepherdess  Marq  Yes and what's better I have prepared her to see you and what's better still here she comes  Count  Does she you throw me all over in an agi∣tation  Marq  Well I'll leave you together remember she's all delicacy  Count  Never fear  Marq  Now have mercy upon her don't wound her too deep  SCENE VIII  Count  Count  Ah you bantering devil There will be a fine scene between us I suppose I shall perswade she'll hesitate and then ah I know how it will be  AIR  First Sir may I perish dear creature  Fall down and expire at your feet  If in air stature mien shape and feature  Any Venus was e'er so compleat  Then madam lord you're such another  I ne'er saw the like in my days  You make such a rout and a pother  And then you've such wheedling ways  Permit meI vow Sir  To ravishnay now Sir  A heavenly kisspray be civil  Oh nectaryou touze me  Ambrosiaand blouze me  Get along you agreeable devil  Fir'd all over  Now the lover  Sighs nor tears can stay  Bold he ventures  Pleasure enters  Reason flies away  SCENE IX  Count Jeannotte  Count  She is a most heavenly creature  Jean  Was any poor wretch ever so used as I am  Count  She seems very unhappy indeed I am too much overwhelmed with distress myself not to pity her  Jean  I could cry for vexation  Count  Poor soulI'll try to comfort herDear lovely young creature may I presume to ask if you are the pretty Shepherdess of the Alps  Jean  Yes sir there's a great many people have said that of me  Count  And they say you have something upon your mind that very much troubles you  Jean  Yes sir I have indeed  Count  And may I take the liberty divine crea∣ture to ask what it is  Jean  Why sir I would not tell every body but such a gentleman as you are I think there can be no great harm  Count  Ingenuous and sensible'tis too great a sacrifice to let her stay hereWell my love  Jean  Well sir my story's very short 'tis only sir that a young man was to have married me but he grew rich and despised me and so has left me to the wide world  Count  'Twould be a great stroke to carry her offMy dear your ingenuity demands as ingenuous a return our cases then are exactly alike death has taken away my wife and ambition your husband  Jean  No sir 'twas another shepherdess that took him away  Count  Simplicity itself I like thatSo you see my angel we are both miserable alike  Jean  Indeed sir I pities you it must be a sad thing for you indeed  Count  Oh a very sad thing I shall never be happy any more  Jean  Dear sir don't squeeze my hand quite so hard  Count  I was only admiring how like your hand and arm is to my poor deceased wife'sAnd so my love he has quite forsaken you  offering to kiss her  Jean  Lord siryes sir he has indeed and I am sure I don't know what I shall do  Count  I must have herAnd have you listened to no offers since this affair  Jean  There have been none made to me sir  Count  Your frankness encourages mine and if I did not fear to offend your delicacy for they tell me you have a prodigious deal of that I would tell you that I have a vacancy in my heart and my house and that if my person was agreeable  Jean  You sirLord sir how can I expect such a great man as you Besides if you can forget your wife so soon what would shortly become of me  Count  Oh my dear there is not the least compa∣rison she was old enough to be your mother  Jean  Oh that indeed is another thing  Count  And then you seem to have a heavenly temper  Jean  Yes I'm a monstrous goodhumour'd girl  Count  Whereas she was the very devil and it was impossible to have any peace with her from morning 'till nightCome then to my arms there thou shalt  find an asylum and the end of all thy woes coach title equipage every happiness shall attend you dia∣monds  Jean  A coach oh dearbut sir you must give me time to think of it  Count  Well but  Jean  Nay nay I won't consent to any thing un∣less you leave me now and I'll tell the other gentle∣man when you shall see me again  Count  One kiss then for earnest  Kisses her  Rap∣ture past expressing  He goes off  SCENE X  Jeannotte Guillot  Jean  A coach and jewels but here comes Guillot I shall match the gentleman now I believe  Guil  So Mrs Jeannotte you are there  Jean  Yes sir I am and what then  Guil  Nay nothing at all your servant  Jean  One word Mr Guillot if you please pray when is the wedding day to be I suppose Madam Adelaide has consented I beg you'll let me be bride∣maid  Guil  To be sure Jeannote one can't do less than that for old acquaintance sake I see she's as mad as fury but I'll seem not to mind it Why now that is as it should be I knew all along you did not love me and so you know how foolish it would have been for two people to be hampered together in a yoke for no∣thing in the world but to draw contrary ways  Jean  Very true Mr Guillot and I dares to say you'll be more happy with a runaway vagabond creature than with an honest vartuous girl that's not  ashamed to tell who her parents are you may take that wipe as you think proper sir A great credit to you to be sure instead of working as an honest man ought to be dancing about in a fool's frock and run∣ning after beauties  Guil  Why if I was you Jeannotte if I did not care for't I would not trouble my head about it  Jean  Oh not I indeed I was only going to say sir that tho' you fancy me jealous and ugly and all that's bad there are men in the world think me the pretty shepherdess of the Alps  Guil  I don't gainsay it  Jean  Besides and moreover to let some folks know other folks can get rich as easy as them nay and can keep their coach what do you think of that and have their jewels and their servants to wait upon them  Guil  I'cod well done Jeannotte ha ha ha  Jean  I can tell you sir 'tis not a thing to laugh at  Guil  Why how canst thou be such a natural do you think this sham will pass upon me don't I know 'tis all flimflam to try me Well Jeannotte I can∣not help saying but I am sorry for thee  Jean  Why you nasty good for nothing falsehearted creature you ought to be ashamed of your∣self so you ought I do love you then I own I do  Bursts out a crying  and if you had not treated me so I would seen him further with all his fine promises but now I'll go and keep my coach out of spight  AIR  Time was when Guillot by my side  Dress'd out in all our Sunday's pride  And dancing by yon beechen tree  'Twas love and joy and who but we  But worse luck's our's we're both grown great  And folly so bewitches  Content is chang'd for pomp and state  And happiness for riches  II  Time was when Guillot told the priest  We'd marry at our harvest feast  Alas what will the good man say  Without his fee when sent away  For Worse luck's our's  c  SCENE XI  Guillot  A coach and jewels what is all this I surely have not been playing the fool 'till I have lost her I'cod this puts me in mind when I was a boy of catching birds and letting them go again  AIR  Many and often was the time  When up a tree I us'd to climb  To search for birds nests in it  And as the boughs I've mov'd about  Perhaps the noise has frightened out  All but the last fledg'd linnet  II  The little thing from bough to bough  I'd watch with anxious care and now  Dodge hither and now thither  Till in the cage I've thought it sure  Forgetting to secure the door  It flew the Lord knows whither  III  What could I do no use to cry  Whimper put finger in the eye  Blubber and make a pother  I e'en was forced to be content  And onwards as I whistling went  Perhaps I've found another  SCENE XII  The inside of  Blaise's  Cottage  Blaise Renette  Ren  Well whenever we die she shall find herself in as good a case as we are  Blaise  We'll give her all our sheep and our cot∣tage  Ren  Ay and every bit of dowlas that I have been so long a spinning for I love her as much as if she was my own child  Blaise  And so do I she's so good so sweet so gen∣teel for all the world like thee when thou wert of her age  Ren  Lord thou art joking good man  Blaise  I en't indeed everybody said you looked the sweetest and dancing the nimblest in all the vil∣lage  Ren  'Tis thy kindness makes thee think so  Blaise  Not at all I have not forgot when I first saw you dancing under the elm but above all upon our weddingday lord how I did love thee  Ren  Ay and thou lovest me now too  Blaise  Ah but in fifty years of marriage the first fire gets a little low however with pleasure I recal the image  AIR  Well I remember me 'twas on the first of May  With garlands and nosegays first come all our neighbours  Then dressed  In their best  Came the pipes and the tabors  Nothing e'er was so gay  At rest from their labours  All kept holiday  Drums were beating bells ringing  No one kind of tillage  Was seen in the village  But all sorts of pastime and dancing and singing  And then at the church I remember it yet  How bashful you look'd I shall never forget  And when ask'd if your duty as wife you'd fulfil  Lord how you did blush when you answer'd I will  Well I remember  c  SCENE XIII  Blaise Renette Marquis Mar∣chioness  Blaise  Dear dear if there was but any thing we could do  Ren  Ay if you would be so good to tell us how we could serve your honour  Marq  I thank you my good friends we are very sensible of your kindness but we only mean to repose ourselves in your cottage this evening where is the Shepherdess where is the beautiful Adelaide I must see her again she is as charming as ever  Blaise  Good Sir our daughter will be here di∣rectly I believe she is getting for you the best our poor house affords we call her our daughter heaven knows whose she really is for we ask her no questions because we see it afflicts her However never had child for a father and mother more kindness than she has for us it seems as if some good angel was sent among us to comfort us in our old age  Ren  Hush hush good man here she comes  SCENE XIV  Marquis Marchioness Blaise Renette and Adelaide  who comes on with Milk in one Hand and a Basket of Fruit in the other  Ade  You are going to sup in a homely manner my dear lady but every thing is clean our bread is not the whitest but it is new and good the eggs are fresh  the milk is warm and the fruit I have the honour to present you is the best the season affords  March  With what diligence and attention with what noble and decent grace this wonderful shep∣herdess renders all the duties of hospitality  SCENE XV  Marquis Marchioness Blaise Renette Adelaide and Guillot  brought on by  Dubois  and other of the  Marquis's  Servants  Dubois  without  Come come no resistance you shall be brought before my lord and lady  Marq  What the devil's all this noise  Ren  Guillot  Blaise  My Nephew Guillot  Marq  What's the matter speak out Dubois  Dubois  Why Sir we have found this thief with my young master's clothes on  March  'Tis true 'tis true I know he was robbed and murder'd Oh my child I shall never see thee again  Marq  Nay nay but my dear now zounds hear reason  Guil  Save me uncle Blaise I am as innocent as an unborn babe  Dubois  Yes yes your innocence shall be rewarded with a halter  March  What have you done with my child  Marq  Speak boldly don't be afraid  March  Where did you get those clothes  Guil  I swopped mine for them indeed I did I should not have taken them only they were forced on  me and because I did it to cure Jeannotte of her jealousy  Marq  A very harmless thing go on my lad you swopped them you say who did you swop them with  Guil  I can't tell  March  Some thief who has killed my child and so got rid of his clothes to prevent being suspected  Marq  My dear zounds if you interrupt him so how do you expect ever to come at the truth  March  I don't interrupt him I only say that  Marq  Now pray hold your tongueWell  Guil  I was going to say he did not look at all like a thief he seem'd to me more like some young gen∣tleman crossed in love  March  Of what age  Guil  Oh about my age and I am twenty tomorrow my birthday is once a yearevery wine harvest and because of that Jeannotte and I were to be married  March  His size  Guil  About my size or else you know our clothes would not have fitted each other in short he bought of me every thing I had my cottage my flock my clothes and so rather than go naked I put on his now you know all  Marq  I could have sworn I was right 'tis my son himself without doubt and where have you left him  Guil  In my cottage that was where he is now sleeping upon a bed of straw as happy I warrant you as a prince  Dubois  If this is all true why did you run away from us  Guil  Because you run after me to be sure I did not know but you might be thieves to tell you the truth and my uncle can tell you that I was always frightful from my cradle  Ade  I have heard his story with some attention and think as you do that it is your son if it is him he plays upon the hautboy  Marq  There are fewer better singers in Italy  Guil  I'cod that's my young man it would have done your heart good to have heard him this morning how his singers did work it about  March  Let us this instant go and find him  Marq  Now why the devil do you want to frighten the boy out of his sleep  Ade  Indeed in your place I would not be too precipitate if you were to disturb him thus in the middle of the night perhaps he might fly into the woods  March  Good Heaven you make me tremble  Ade  Without hazarding this or without alarming him let me manage this business and tomorrow I'll engage to bring him to your arms  March  You have seen him then my dear child  Ade  I have madam  Marq  Well my dear what the devil do you think I don't know a little about these things did not I tell you how it was the truth is the boy has heard us talk a thousand times in praise of Adelaide from the picture we drew he fell in love with her and de∣termined to come here to see her 'tis a fault but it  is an honest fault the effect of a young head but movement of a good heart  AIR  Chorus  Our Cares are o'er he's found he's found  Long look'd for is come home at last  Let now appear  Your friendly cheer  And as the wine we push around  We'll laugh at all our troubles past  Marq  And so friend you and he chang'd clothes  Guil  Yes sir and please you that was all  I meant no harm in it God knows  Blaise  Come sir our table is but small  Here Guillot stir thyself my lad  For madam put the great arm chair  Your cheer I fear will be but sad  Marq  'Tis very well friend Blaise sit there  My pretty Adelaidenay don't frown  BlaizeRenetteHey what neither sit  Either this minute both sit down  Or dam'me if I eat a bit  Chorus  Our cares are over  c  Marq  Now if sweet Adelaide would look gay  I should have all I could desire  Nay 'tis not fair to turn away  From mirth which you yourself inspire  Ade  Dear sir I'm chearful  Marq  That one smile  Went to my heart there must be ways  Found out her sorrow to beguile  I'd have her happyHey friend Blaise  Blaise  Ah sir I fain wou'd see that hour  For she's as 'twere my child all one  But we I fear have no such power  Marq  Suppose I go and fetch my son  Chorus  Our cares are o'er  c  The curtain drops at the end of the chorus as they are sitting at the table  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  Marquis Adelaide  Adelaide  HEAVENS for what am I reservedhow un∣lucky was this rencounter with the Marquis and his lady they have without intending it exposed me to the odious addresses of this Abbé and every dangermy retreat is discovered and I run a thousand risks of being hourly insulted  Marq  Ah my lovely girl I have been looking for you do you know you have robbed my wife and me of a night's sleep  Ade  Me Sir  Marq  Yes youyou may remember when we were here before we used every argument in our power to induce you to go with us to Italy and though afterwards at your earnest intreaty we promised never to say any more to you on the subject we could hardly refrain from breaking this promise  Ade  Alas Sir don't think of meI am put in the world to make everywhere unhappiness  Marq  Look'e Adelaide I would not be thought inquisitively impertinent nor do I mean to seek any thing but your happiness I tell you my wife and I have been debating the matter all night and for the first time I believe this seven years we are both in one mind In consequence of our determina∣tion I come to offer you my son we are convinced your birth is as good as ours and as to fortune if any  chance has robbed you of that 'tis lucky my boy has a good swinging one to put in his scale which would otherwise be overbalanced by your merit Confide then to us the secret of your distress I know before∣hand 'tis something that will make you more respec∣table in our eyes for it is impossible that any thing but goodness should dwell in such a heart as your's  Ade  Sir I acknowledge that the notice you have been pleased to take of me is a distinction with which I had no right to flatter myself I confess also that I ought to look upon the offer of your son as a very high compliment your unparalleled kindness will never be erased from my memory but Sir there is an abyss between the world and me that nothing can over∣leap  Marq  My dear child the more you humiliate yourself the higher you rise in my esteem at least let me shew you the necessity of disclosing to us your situation that we may know how to soften the rigour of your fate Consider what a terrible thing it will be to endure the inclemency of the seasons without a friend to support or assist you you'll find no more Blaises and Renettes you'll be an object of envy to the other villagers Come come Adelaide I have not made such a fine speech a long time and pray don't let it be in vain  Ade  Sir you shall know my story I am now going to tell it your son he ought not to think of me and I have no other way of restoring him to himself and you than by holding up the unfortunate circum∣stances of my life that he may be the first to say 'tis impossible we should ever be united Thus you will be acquainted with all my unhappiness and in return  for this confidence I must entreat you when you leave this place to take every possible precaution to prevent my being an object of odious curiosity and while you stay here to guard me from importunities which are as hateful as they are ineffectual  Marq  That mandrake of an Abbé I'll lay a mil∣lion damn him I'll cut his ears off Beautiful young creature you render yourself more and more estimable every moment Be assured you have nothing to do but name your wishes and every thing within my for∣tune shall be your's  AIR  Ade  My tearsalas I cannot speak  Must thank this goodness sure divine  For had I words words are too weak  Too poor to vent such thoughts as mine  The sun in its meridian height  Will gratitude like this inspire  Whose kindly heat and piercing light  We wonder at and we admire  Exit  SCENE II  Marquis Blaise  Marq  I am not very fond of the pathetic but some how or other I can't help being touched to the soul with this amiable young creature's distress  SCENE III  Marquis Abbé  Mar  Your most humble servant Mr Abbé  dryly  Abbé  I have been searching for you Marquis I have the most ridiculous circumstance in nature to tell you 'twould be matter for ten satirical odes  Marq  What is it  Abbé  The Count has made me the confident of his amour  Marq  No no  Abbé  He has and my fellow la Pierre is now upon the search for the best carriage to be found in this mi∣serable place to carry off him and his fair one  Marq  That's excellent  Abbé  And what think you I intend to do  Marq  Nay I don't know  Abbé  At the moment he gives his hand to the coun∣terfeit Shepherdess of the Alps I will step in with the real one drive off and leave the poor Count in the lurch  Marq  And you are really so egregiously conceited to believe this  Abbé  She has seen me Sir  Marq  I know she has and to cut the matter short has placed herself under my protection you  must  there∣therefore drop all thoughts of her  Abbé  Must  that's a little strong Sir  Marq  Come come Abbé it won't do you can't marry her because you are of the church and if you meditate any other design it becomes my affair  Abbé  Your affair Which way  Marq  Because as an honest man this young crea∣ture's unfortunate situation obliges me to prevent her being insulted  Abbé  You are rather too old I should think to pro∣fess yourself a protector of distressed damsels Mar∣quis  Marq  One can never be too old puppy to profess one's self a protector of innocence besides I have brought you here therefore am in some degree acces∣sary to your outrageous folly and a word in your eara man may by chance admit a rascal into his company but if he finds him out and does not chas∣tise him he is little better than a rascal himself  Abbé  Sir though I don't wear a sword I can use one  Marq  To do you justice I know you can though I should be sorry to see you draw it in so unworthy a cause However if it should be necessary I don't be∣lieve I have forgot that kind of sport myself I have only then one word to say to you you must either give me your honour never to speak to Adelaide any more or you and I are two  Abbé  You and I  are  two then my Lord pen and person I'll not be answerable for my actions to you or any man I did the girl the honour I confess to make love to her and she answered me with a great deal of pride and a great deal of impertinence which must and shall be subdued even though the Marquis of Belemine was ever so to profess him her knight errant  Marq  Very well very well I shall watch you in the mean time if you think to commit any violence by availing yourself of this young creature's defenceless situation you are no better than a robber who would take away her honour because he had a pistol at her breast  AIR  Why is the devil in you  Or are you such a ninny  To believe of you she'll ever think perswade her all you can  No no whatever believe you  Your hopes will all deceive you  For a girl of sense will yield tonot a monkey but a man  II  Zounds can that hat and feather  Or the coxcomb altogether  A squire of silka mandrakea mere flash in the pan  His pretty self admiring  Be ought but hateinspiring  When a woman always yields tonot a monkey but a man  III  Then give this folly over  Nor seek to blend the lover  With the ruffian for I plainly can discover that's your plan  Or spight of all your vapouring  I'll so finely spoil your capering  You shall own this arm belongs tonot a monkey but a man  SCENE III  Abbé La Pierre  Abbé  Dam'me I'm piqued at thisOh here comes La PierreWell what news  La P  Oh sir they'll be drawn to matrimony in much the same stile as they draw criminals to exe∣cution but however that's not very widely different from the lady's situation  Abbé  What you have got a carriage then  La P  Yes sir and such a one  Abbé  Well but the plan is changedI am go∣ing in this carriage instead of the Count  La P  You siroh oh I smoke it I saw you togetherWhy sir the bargain has not been long makingso modest toowell who will ever trust to countenances after this  Abbé  Hold Monsieur La Pierre not quite so fast if you please the bargain is not so firmly made but there will be a necessity for a little agreeable violenceyou understand meI suppose it's possible to procure three or four sturdy fellows  La P  Wheware we thereabouts why this affair will make a noise sir  Abbé  I would have it In short this must all be done within half an hour meet me at the cot∣tage and if you see the Count tell him you can't succeed for him  La P  I am gone sir I suppose I may say that your honour's purse is pretty full  Abbé  What you please as to thatand for thee if I am happy I'll give thee a snug birth in a convent of Benedictines for thy pains  SCENE IV  Abbé  Thus before there doubtable Marquis will have time to look about him will I be far enough with my lovely prey our little novel will exactly make out the bal∣lad I wrote once upon my stealing a nun out of a con∣vent  AIR  The coy Pastora Damon woo'd  Damon the witty and the gay  Damon who never fair pursued  But she became an easy prey  Yet with this nymph his ev'ry power  In vain he tries no language moves  Thus do we see the tender flower  Shrink from the sun whose warmth it loves  II  Piqued at the little angry puss  Cried he she sets me all on fire  Then plagues himself and makes this fuss  Only to raise her value higher  For that she loves me every hour  Each moment some new instance proves  Thus do we see the tender flower  Shrink from the sun whose warmth it loves  III  How to resolve then what resource  By fair means she will ne'er come to  What of a little gentle force  Suppose I try what that will do  I know she'll tears in torrents pour  I know her cries will pierce the groves  Thus do we see the tender flower  Shrink from the sun whose warmth it loves  SCENE V  Marquis Guillot Jeannotte  who come on disputing  Guil  Why I tell you Jeannotte if you had not been so jealous it would never have happened  Jean  Why for the matter of that Guillot if I had been ever so jealous I don't see why  Marq  Nay nay damn it don't fall out the mo∣ment you have made it up You have promised never to be jealous any more and you never to give any cause upon these conditions I shall throw something into your purse in the mean time you both remem∣ber how I told you to manage the Count  Jean  Yes sir never fear I have got my story  Guil  And so have I mine  Marq  Well here he comes leave us together for a minute and come to him when you find him alone first Guillot and then Jeannotte  Both  We'll take care  They retire  SCENE VI  Marquis Count  Marq  So Count  Count  So Marquis I have ten thousand obligati∣ons to you she is ready to go off with me  Marq  To go off with you how the devil could you bring her to this  Count  I don't know my old way I insinuated and insinuated  Marq  'Till she could refuse you nothing eh why this will make a devil of a clatter at Turin you'll be envied by the whole world  Count  Yes I believe I shall indeed  Marq  And so the Countess is quite forgotten  Count  Now Marquis that's unfriendly of you I had just got over the first shock and you have revived it again in my mind  Marq  Now damn it Count this is so absurd be∣tween two such friends as you and I don't I know what a life you used to lead with her  Count  Horrible indeed but to do her justice poor woman she had a great many virtues  Marq  What virtues was not she petulant capri∣cious illtempered  Count  As the devil but then she was divinely handsome  Marq  Handsome what with that meagre figure and her painting herself red and white  Count  I have told her a thousand times how detest∣able it was but then her features  Marq  Were at a mile's distance from each other  Count  To be sure they were a little irregular but however in perfection itself you may find some flaw we see spots in the sun  Marq  Come come her perfections compared to her imperfections were a drop in the ocean a grain of pepper upon a turtle In short she was a mixture of mischief and malice incapable of pleasing herself and envying all those who could her delight was to tyrannize over her husband and to play the co∣quette with every body else  Count  Dam'me if I did not tell her the very words once myself when we quarrelled  Marq  How different is the present object of your wishes gentle mild engaging  Count  Oh to rapture  Marq  So far from thinking herself above you she will look up to you as the author of her good fortune  Count  Very true my dear friend I'll go this mi∣nute and beg of her but zounds we can't get a carriage to take us from hence  Marq  I who am your friend upon all other occa∣sions have thought upon that too there is one Guillot I fancy can do your business he is nephew to the honest people where we are yonder is the very man well I'll leave you together I am going to see if my wife has left her toilet I saw the sun rise this morning and the ceremony put me exactly in mind of a lady's issuing from her dressingroom  AIR  In the month of May  The morning grey  First peeps a doubtful light  Three strikes the clock  The village cock  Next crows with all his might  Each waking bird  Chirping is heard  Tinges of red the sky adorn  Bird man and beast  Regard the east  And pleas'd salute the rising morn  The shepherd now his flock unfolds  Night like a thief steals slow away  His dingy hue  Ugly to view  Is chang'd to a delightful blue  All nature's gay  And now the villager beholds  His mowers mow his ploughers plough  Sheep bleat birds sing and oxen low  Each rural sound salutes his ears  He whistles to make one  And now  Usher'd by all this fine parade  In ev'ry splendid pomp array'd  Appears  The radiant sun  So after abundance of toilet affairs  And Betty has nine times run up and down stairs  For lappets and ribbands and one thing and t'other  And the house top and bottom's alarm'd with the pother  And a hundred things more are done equally risible  The lady at last condescends to be visible  SCENE VII  Count Guillot  Guil  My uncle Blaise has lent me some clothes so I look a little more like myself and if they catch me being a gentleman again  Count  Servant friend  Guil  Your's sir and please you  Count  If your name's Guillot I am informed you can furnish me with a carriage to take me to Medina  Guil  Why sir I believe I could do such a thing How many persons is it to carry  Count  Me and another  Guil  I beg your pardon sir but you are the gen∣tleman that's come with the gentlefolks at uncle's an't you  Count  I am my friend  Guil  Oh I have been spoke to about it before  Count  What may I hope by my charming shep∣herdess  Guil  Ay ay you know who I mean well enoughI'cod what a work you have made with her  Count  Do you think she loves me then  Guil  Loves you if the King loved me half so well I need not be a poor peasant here in a village  Count  And so you can get us a carriage well I shall reward you for it and pray what sort of a one is it  Guil  Why they ben't the best in the world our way it will break down five or six times before we reach Medina  Count  Break down  Guil  O yes that we always lay our account to but then we take care and carry a parcel of cords with us to set things right again  Count  Oh I had rather we could have gone all the way without breaking down  Guil  If the thing could be so would I too sir  Count  Well and what sort of cattle have you  Guil  Why as to that sir pretty well I don't think they'll founder above three times  Count  Founder  Guil  Yes sir we shall have three times I reckon to stop in the snow about five hours at a spill  Count  In the snow  Guil  Yes sir but then your love will keep you warm  Count  To be sure I would undergo a little in con∣sideration of that  Guil  And then I hope you are pretty well as to courage sir  Count  How do you mean  Guil  Why sir they say there's a woundy sight of robbers that way  Count  Robbers hang it that's unluckyWell but I hope they are none of those damn'd banditti rascals who murder people  Guil  Always  Count  An't you afraid then for yourself  Guil  O Sir they never touch the guide  Count  Well I must consult the Marquis about it At all events get readyWhere shall I find you  Guil  Oh at uncle's  Count  You know the way  Guil  Yes yes every inch of itLet me see  AIR  Off we go from Breaknecksteep  Softly softly jades so so  'Till we see the mountains peep  Cover'd with huge heaps of snow  But small matters travellers never must mind  We laugh at each stumble and sing at each trip  For you sir d'ye see  You've to cheer up your spirits a kind coming fair  Who the more we're in danger the more will be kind  And then as for me  I've a drop in my pocket to keep out the air  And I'm always reviv'd at the smack of the whip  II  Byandby to Cripplehill  Tired and jaded we arrive  Where for some hours we stand still  The wornout cattle scarce alive  But small matters c  III  'See the carriage one side hang  'And now upon its end and now  'Apart the breaking traces bang  'And souse we tumble in a slough  'But small matters c'  IV  Next to Cutthroat dale we reach  Where from behind some lonely bush  With blunderbuss and pistols each  A dozen lurking villains rush  But small matters c  SCENE VIII  Count Jeannotte  Count  I must throw none of these objections in her wayhere she is Well my love you are come in good time we shall have a carriage directly and then upon the wings of love  Jean  Ay all that's very well if I could believe you'd love me for ever  Count  How can you think otherwise who would not have done as much as I have for the tender gentle beautiful Shepherdess of the Alps your distress bespoke my pity pity softened into love and love commanded me to throw myself and my fortune at your feet  Jean  Yes but ours has been but a short acquain∣tance and how do I know but you wants to inveigle me away for some wicked purpose  Count  My dear I would not harbour such a thought for the world my intention is to take you directly to Turin there to bespeak you clothes jewels every thing proper for your intended situation and when my twelvemonth and a day expires to marry you  Jean  Twelvemonth and a day  Count  Yes my dear you know it would not be decent before  Jean  I can tell you Sir I won't wait so long as thatto love you so dearly as I do indeed and not be married 'till then  Count  But my life what can I do  Jean  Why marry me before you go  Count  Consider lovebesides there's no such thing as getting a priest  Jean  O Lord our curate will do the job and thank you into the bargain if you'll give him a good fee and then as I am to be a lady you know I can't see why you may not bring me acquainted with the gentlefolks and then we may all go away together  Count  That's true but if they find I have made such a sudden resolution  Jean  They may laugh at you perhaps you think Oh sir if you are ashamed of your choice indeed  Count  No my life it is not that  Jean  I can tell you sir I would not turn my back for virtue and honesty to any one and then as to beauty  Count  Venus was never half so handsome  Jean  I don't know she but I am sure I am very well to pass  Count  Zounds I shall lose her My love you are every thing to me and your will shall be obey'd  Jean  Ay that's saying something but I think you had better make me acquainted with the gentlefolks first and then you may get one of your friends to stand father  Count  A good thought  Jean  And another thingyou don't think of mar∣rying me in that dismal suit of clothes do you  Count  My dear I have no other with me  Jean  Oh I dare say the gentleman will lend you some  Count  Well but  Jean  Ah there You are at your buts again  Count  Well well I'll make no objections every thing shall be as you desire it I'll go and find the Marquis directlyAdieu  He goes off  Jean  Oh dear how I shall laugh to see him in his finery  AIR  Ah men what silly things you are  To woman thus to humble  Who fowler like but spreads her snare  Or at her timid game  Takes aim  Pop pop and down you tumble  She marks you down fly where you will  O'er clover grass or stubble  Can wing you feather you or kill  Just as she takes the trouble  Ah men c  Then fly not from us 'tis in vain  We know the art of setting  As well as shooting and can train  The shyest man our not in  Ah men c  SCENE IX  The Tomb seen in another point of View  Bellemine  Y B  Three hours have I waited here in anxious expectation contemplating every one of those objects that have so often been silent witnesses of her griefall nature seems to respect itand wheree'er she comes like gloomy mists at the approach of day all other objects shrink back and behold her approach with silent admirationwhat can it be  AIR  Bright gems that twinkle from afar  Planets and every lesser star  Who darting each a downward ray  Console us for the loss of day  Begone even Venus who so bright  Reflects her visions pure and white  Instant begone and quit the skies  For lo the moon begins to rise  II  Ye pretty warblers of the grove  Who chant such artless tales of love  The throstle gurgling in his throat  The linnet with his silver note  The soaring lark the whistling thrush  The merry blackbird goldfinch hush  Fly vanish disappear take wing  The nightingale begins to sing  But she is here and all at once the blood for∣sakes my very heart how I tremble to approach her  SCENE X  Young Bellemine Adelaide  Ade  I have made you wait but I'll hasten to re∣compense your patience you know upon what con∣ditions you are to hear my story let us speak to one another then without disguise I'll begin and let my confidence encourage your's listenmy unhappi∣ness will be a lesson for youShepherd behold this tomb  AIR  Here sleeps in peace beneath this rustic vase  The tenderest lover a husband could prove  Of all his distress alas I am the cause  So much I ador'd him heaven envied my love  The sighs I respire ev'ry morn I arise  The misery I cherish the grief and the pain  The thousand of tears that fall from my eyes  Are all the sad comforts for me that remain  II  When his colours display'd honour call'd him to arms  By tender perswasions I kept him away  His glory forgetting for those fatal charms  And to punish me he is depriv'd of the day  Since when to his memory I've rais'd this sad tomb  Where to join him alas I shall shortly descend  Where sorrow nor pain nor affliction can come  And where both my love and my crime shall have end  After a long Silence  Ade  Now tell me of what parents you are born and what reduced you to the state of shepherd  Y B  Cease to question me 'twould afflict you to know an ill you cannot cure You are unhappy but I am more so and such is the nature of my distress that an eternal silence must lock it up in my heart  Ade  Alas how can I without knowing who you are and what are your troubles any longer place a confidence in you the mystery you make raises a cloud between us  Y B  Don't be offended at my

heart alas but too sensible  Ade  No it cannot be I exact from you the most sincere confession and I think I merit it I have spoken to you without mystery and you ought to imi∣tate me  Y B  Alas let

unalterable as your's I see all the repugnance you have to make me unhappy I see your heart is with him who reposes in that tomb I see that nothing can detach you from it your duty is never to love me and my fate for ever to adore you  SCENE XI  Adelaide Abbé Peasants  Ade  Looking after him  Poor Bellemine  Abbé  Here she is Come ma'am you seem a lady fond of adventures and therefore I hope you'll
