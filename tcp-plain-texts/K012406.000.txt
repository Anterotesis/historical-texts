Arnold  WITH arms across along the Strand  A shepherd walk'd and hung his head  Viewing the footsteps on the sand  Which a bright nymph had made  " The tide says he will soon erase  " The marks so lightly here imprest  " But time or tide will ne'er deface  " Her image in my breast  " Am I some savage beast of prey  " Am I some monster grown  " That thus she flies so swift away  " Or meets me with a frown"  This said he took a running leap  A lover's leap indeed  And plung'd into the sounding deep  Where hungry fishes feed  The melancholy hern stalks by  Around the squalling seagulls yell  Aloft the croaking ravens fly  And toll his passing bell  IISONGNANCY  French Air  What the deuce do you think I'm a fool pray  And so plain I'm not fit to be seen  Sure I'm pretty enough in my own way  And my dear I am now past fifteen  Yes fifteen yes fifteen  You stun me with scolding pray sister be quiet  Then you'll find me sufficiently tame  But if you still scold I can equal your riot  And from coolness I'll pass to a flame  Yes a flame yes a flame  IIISONGSALLY  Dr Arnold  His presence gives birth  To goodhumour and mirth  No pleasure on earth  Such delight can impart  He's so jaunty so neat  His looks are so sweet  To the eyes he's a treat  And a feast to the heart  IVSONGROSEMARY  The Musick by the Author of the Piece  When once master Love gets into your head  You may go to bed you may go to bed  When once master Love gets into your head  You may go to bed for life  You frown and you smile you laugh and you cry  And you can't tell why and you can't tell why  You frown and you smile you laugh and you cry  And you wish you were a wife  Love makes such a rout within and without  You tumble and toss you tumble and toss  He makes such a rout within and without  You tumble and toss for life  Your heart goes pitpat you're mum and you chat  You can't tell for what you can't tell for what  Your heart goes pitpat you can't tell for what  And you wish you were a wife  VDUETSALLY and WILLIAMS  The Words from  Suckling  the Musick by Dr  Arnold  WILLIAMS  If fondly thou dost not mistake  And my defects for graces take  Persuad'st thyself that jests are broken  When little is or nothing spoken  Know this thou lov'st amiss  And to love true  Thou must begin again and love anew  SALLY  If when thy Sally fills the room  Thou dost not quake and art struck dumb  And in striving this to cover  Dost not speak thy words twice over  Know this thou lov'st amiss  And to love true  Thou must begin again and love anew  BOTH  Honest lover whosoever  If in all thy love there ever  Was one thought wav'ring if thy flame  Was not still even still the same  Know this thou lov'st amiss  And to love true  Thou must begin again and love anew  VIGLEE  Composed Anno Dom  SALLY WILLIAMS and ROSEMARY  We be three poor mariners newly come from the seas  We spend our lives in jeopardy while others live at ease  Shall we go dance the round the round the round  And he that is a bully boy come pledge me on this ground  We care not for those martial men that do our states disdain  But we care for those merchantmen that do our states maintain  To them we dance this round around around  And he that is a bully boy come pledge me on this ground  VIISONGTOM  Altered from an old Ballad  Come push the Glass around  Come push the bowl about  In that we'll drown all care my boys  Come push the bowl about  Drink deep and drink it out  The liquor's sound  'Twill raise your spirits higher boys  To fight kill or wound  May we still be found  Rejoicing in our fate my boys  On sea or ground  ChorusThe liquor's sound c  II  Why messmates why  Should we be melancholy boys  Why messmates why  Decreed to live or die  What flinching fie  Damn care drink on be jolly boys  'Tis he you or I  Cold hot wet or dry  We're always bound to follow boys  And scorn to fly  ChorusWhat flinching c  III  Let fate decide  I mean not to upbraid ye boys  Whate'er betide  No sailor shall complain  Should next broadside  Send us to him that made us boys  We're free from pain  But if we remain  A bottle and kind landlady  Cure all again  ChorusShould next broadside c  VIIISONGSALLY  Giordani  'Tis true I lov'd Tom Splicem dearly  And very dearly Tom lov'd me  Another since has touch'd me nearly  As brave by land as Tom by sea  I lov'd him living most sincerely  But death still leaves the lover free  IXSONGTOM SPLICEM  French Air  God of war god of war  Honour now summons to battle  God of war bear me far  To the loud cannon's rattle  I court no new desire  Love I contemn thy fire  War's alarm can only charm  And all my soul inspire  XSONGNANCY  La Lumiere  When first you took me on your knee  And told the wonders of the sea  How waves on waves for ever roll  And toss the ship from pole to pole  How winds from every corner blow  Now raise her high now sink her low  My heart kept beating at the tale  And with my sighs I swell'd your sail  II  But when with all a sailor's pride  You spoke of fleets drawn side by side  Of French and English ten to one  Deck threat'ning deck gun fir'd at gun  My heart admir'd the gallant strife  But throbb'd and trembled for your life  And 'midst the fancied cannon's roar  I wish'd Tom Splicem safe on shore  XIFINALENANCY  The Musick by the Author of the Piece  Be gay be gay be gay  'Tis Friendship leads the way  And gives you all a welcome here  Her call obey  Come haste away  Her balmy smile dispels each care  CHORUS  Away away O haste away  Away away O haste away  For time and tide for no man stay  ROSEMARY  Away away away  Make this a holiday  My liquors like your hearts are sound  Then sing and drink  And never think  Grief can exist while the toast goes round  CHORUS  Away away c c  SALLY  Be gay be gay be gay  Each month it is not May  The lily and the rose will fade  Love while you're young  Nor trust that tongue  Who would our youth from joys dissuade  CHORUS  Away away away c c  ACT II  XIISONGROSEMARY  Dr Arnold  WHEN I gayly fill the chearful glass  I care not if the world goes down  Hob or nob let the bottle pass  Social mirth our bumpers crown  Chorus  Hob or Nob c  Oh the wisest man is but an ass  Who on convivial joys can frown  Hob or nob let the bottle pass  Social mirth our bumpers crown  Hob or Nob c  The bewitching smile of a roguish lass  In this small bowl we can quickly drown  Hob or nob let the bottle pass  Social mirth our bumpers crown  Hob or Nob c  XIIISONGTOM  Vauxhall Watch  My name's Tom Splicem I'll be bound  A man a boy upon this ground  I've gone the world around around  Crying hip hallo  II  When the Dons and Frenchmen come in sight  O then my heart it pants for fight  And if they do not take their flight  O we'd trounce them so  III  But if like rips they will not stay  We wait to fight another day  Another comes they run away  So hip hallo  XIVSONGSALLY  Dr Arnold  The bark that holds our treasure  When at a distance seen  Fear mingles with our pleasure  For danger lies between  II  But prosperous gales uprising  To waft her to the shore  With double joy surprizing  Confirm the danger o'er  XVSONGTOM  Admiral Benbow  What sailor is anxious great treasures to hoard  No losses he minds while there's courage on board  What tho' I am stranded my fortune a wreck  While two planks hold together I'll still keep the deck  II  My heart's splic'd with many and many a rope  And still do I rest on the anchor of hope  Again I'm afloat should a fair wind befriend  Or I go to the bottom and so there's an end  XVISONGNANCY  Dr Arnold  Take this my gallant sailor  From a young but faithful maid  The powers of wealth may fail her  But her friendship ne'er can fade  If you fly her or deny her  You will tear her heart in twain  Then oh bless her nor distress her  Lest she ne'er know peace again  FINALE  Dr Arnold  XVIITOM SPLICEM  Now fickle Goddess do thy worst  Fortune I defy thee  No longer I for glory thirst  Far hence Goddess hie thee  Hie thee to the briny wave  To the tars that court thee  Their country and their honour save  Wealth and love support thee  Chorus  Hie thee c  WILLIAMS  If love is call'd a pleasure  If every heart it warms  If friendship is a treasure  We brave approaching storms  We each perform our duty  To earn the smile from beauty  While learning nods applause  The story well may suit ye  That pleads an honest cause  Chorus  The story c  SALLY  I've run some risks this night it's true  I've lost one honest lover  Know ladies all the girls are few  Who could the loss recover  But honest Williams look'd so kind  So well he told his story  You cannot blame a fickle mind  Which crowns the brave with glory  CHORUS  But honest Williams c  ROSEMARY  'Tis wond'rous strange young fellows change  From one thing to another  From love to war they chearful range  A plaguy foolish pother  I'll fill a bowl a swinging bowl  A bowl as big as twenty  In which I'll drown each critic's frown  Nor fear the  cognoscenti  CHORUS  I'll fill a bowl c  THE END  Of  T CADELL  Bookeller opposite  Catherinestreet Strand  may be had the following Pieces  BONDUCA a Tragedy written by Beaumont and
