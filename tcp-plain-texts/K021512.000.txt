 TRUSTY  Mr DAVIES  SALLY  Mrs WRIGHTEN  WIFE  Mrs LOVE  THE ELECTION A MUSICAL INTERLUDE  SCENE A Baker's Shop  Enter JOHN and his WIFE  JOHN  I Tell thee Moll this canting will not do  I'll sell my loaves but not my conscience too  Shall I be perjur'd Wife and damn my soul  To get a guinea for a penny roll  RONDEAU  Honest John no bribe can charm  His heart is like his  oven  warm  Tho' poor as Job  He will not rob  Nor sell his truth to fill his fob  T  and hirelings I'd blackball 'em  For to let such rascals set  Is as bad as using  allum  Or as selling bread  short weight  Tho' I oft am  mealyhanded  I am not  mealymouth'd  likewise  For a knave I'll not be  branded  But declare without disguise  Honest John no bribe c  What because my outside's  dusty  Must my mind be dirty too  They perhaps will find me  crusty  Who now think me soft as  dough  I nor mind their balls nor feasting  Nor their specious promise heed  What's the bread without the  yeast  in  What's the word without the deed  WIFE  Lord Johnny now why make you such a fuss  What's truth and conscience to such folk as us  Nor one nor t'other will as I'm a sinner  E'er give us credit for a Sunday's dinner  Sir  Courtly  says if you'll but vote for him  He'll fill our pockets to the very brim  JOHN  I tell thee Nohe's one of those they say  Who's ever ready to talk  any  way  Loud as a bull or mute as any mouse  A  dial  or a  larum  in the house  All smiles and treachery all bows and lies  In fact a complication of disguise  'Squire Trusty is my man who just and true  Butters his bread just as a man shou'd do  WIFE  He can't say  bo to a goose  don't vote for such  JOHN  Better to say too little than too much  Our parson talks well but experience teaches  He seldom practises the good he preaches  The 'Squire's an honest cock  WIFE  And so are we  And we may starve upon our honesty  Sir Courtly'll get an act to bake on Sundays  Then we may live genteel and keep St Mondays  Besides his friend young Richard loves our Sally  Sure for her sake you'll not stand  shilly shally  Who knows but we may hold our heads up soon  Who knows when you  JOHN  Who knows when you'll have done  WIFE  Why hubby all the world are mending now  And live as grand as Lords  JOHN  The Lord knows how  WIFE  There's  Patch  the glazier who they say's no fool  Sends both his daughters to the boardingschool  And neighbour  Squab  the sexton's wife I see  Wears a silk gown and drinks the best green tea  This is the time to make us all for ever  Grow rich at an election  hub  or never  SONG  If in life you desire to have credit and weight  To be fear'd by the rich and caress'd by the great  Your vote and your int'rest will raise you to note  If for int'rest you tender your int'rest and vote  Would you hang on the arm of my Lord or his Grace  And familiarly ask for a pension or place  To your int'rest he'll promise his life to devote  If you'll promise him both your int'rest and vote  This engages the minds of the great and the small  Of our friendships and loves is the basis of all  Each talent each virtue each gift he has got  Who can boast Borough int'rest and proffers his vote  JOHN  Sad doctrine this but be it mine to prove  We have not quite forgot our country's love  To venal honours let me ne'er aspire  But in my station tend my humble fire  On no vain schemes of false ambition bent  My pride Integritymy wealth Content  SONG  Whilst happy in my native land  I boast my counry's charter  I'll never basely lend my hand  Her liberties to barter  The noble mind is not at all  By poverty degraded  'Tis guilt alone can make us fall  And well I am persuaded  Each freeborn Briton's song should be  " Or give me Death or Liberty"  Tho' small the pow'r which fortune grants  And few the gifts she sends us  The lordly hireling often wants  That freedom which defends us  By law secur'd from lawless strife  Our house is our  castellum  Thus bless'd with all that's dear in life  For lucre shall we sell 'em  No ev'ry Briton's song shou'd be  " Or give me Death or Liberty"  Exit  Enter SALLY  Well mother saywill Mr Richard's friend  Succeed and shall we gain our end  If father would but for Sir Courtly vote  He swore to marry me without a groat  WIFE  Ah child your hopes and mine are wholly over  I've lost my fancied greatness you your lover  Spite of all I cou'd say your father's gone  To give his vote for Trustywe're undone  Condemn'd thro' life to be the slave and sloven  We must eat  raspins  still and draw the  oven  SALLY  Ah cruel fortune must I then despair  And lose the only youth that's worth my care  Then all my dreams of happiness are flown  Still must I wear this linseywoolsey gown  Still without curtains sleep upon the floor  And rival the Miss  Patches  now no more  SONG  Adieu to silks and satins  To love and peace adieu  Each day in homely pattens  I still must bake and brew  Each morn at early rising  Must twirl the hated mop  And ev'ry thought disguising  Attend my father's shop  Adieu c  WIFE  Here comes young Mr RichardI'm afraid  HeartbrokenI shall die  SALLY  And I a maid  RICHARD  Welcome my lovely Sallywhy so sad  Beauty and youth shou'd be for ever glad  WIFE  Yes but our friends will one and all forsake us  And now we've nothing left but this poor bakehouse  My husband voted wrong  RICHARD  He acted right  True to his Trust his conduct seems more bright  Unaw'd unbiass'd he preserves his fame  Would every Englishman could say the same  Sir  Courtly  was my friend to him I owe  The little fortune which I offer now  To aid his cause with warmth to take his part  Duty and Gratitude impell'd my heart  But Gratitude nor Duty bid condemn  That Honour which so often springs from them  Your father's merit sets him up to view  And more enhances my esteem for you  SONG  Ah let it ne'er with truth be said  That public Virtue droops her head  That English Faith should luckless prove  Or cross one English Virgin's love  If in my Sally's youthful heart  Her Richard e'er may claim a part  This happy hour shall smiling prove  That Honour firmly fixes Love  Enter JOHN  Well friends the poll is overall is done  Sir  Courtly  has thrown up and we have won    To Richard    I wish I could have granted your request  But Conscience bade me vote as I thought best  RICHARD  Pray no excuseswe may yet be friends  Give me your daughter and our quarrel ends  Happy to win the favour if I can  And boast th' alliance of so just a man  JOHN  Take her she's freely your's and may you find  For want of fortune treasures in her mind  But other subjects claim the present hour  When conqu'ring Freedom tramples abject pow'r  E'er now the Sons of Liberty rejoice  And chearful hail the Hero of their choice  QUARTETTO  JOHN and CHORUS  Come then let us hasten all  To greet the glorious festival  JOHN solo  For what to a Briton so grateful can be  As the triumph of Freedom and Virtue to see  CHORUS  Come then let us c  WIFE  Since my daughter will be married  What care I who has miscarried  CHORUS  Come then let us c  DUET  RICHARD and SALLY  With joy my freedom I resign  To call my lovely Sally mine  And she thro' every scene of life  Will prove the fond and faithful wife  SONG and CHORUS  A shouting c is heard repeatedly  Hark hark harkthe loud huzza  Come come come come come away  Let each Briton now be gay  This is Britain's holiday  Exeunt  The Scene draws and discovers the principal street of a markettown crouded with people of all denominations the Member is chaired and brought to the Front of the Stage  CHORUS  Trusty for ever  TRUSTY bowing  I thank ye for your favour  And 'tis my resolution  To guard the Constitution  CHORUS  Trusty for ever c  TRUSTY  I thank ye for your favour  To you I will resign  Your pleasure shall be mine  CHORUS  Trusty for ever c  TRUSTY  I thank ye for your favour  Thro' life I will support the interest of the nation  Still bound by inclination  To this noble Corporation  CHORUS  Trusty for everhuzza c  TRUSTY  I thank you for your favourhuzza c  FINIS
