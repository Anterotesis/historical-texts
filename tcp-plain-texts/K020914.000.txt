 AN ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD  AN ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD BETWEEN PERICLES and ARISTIDES Being a Sequel to the Dialogue between PERICLES and COSMO  Alteram Partem audi  LONDON Printed for L DAVIS and C REYMERS opposite  Gray'sInnGate  in  Holbourn  MDCCLX  Advertisement  THOUGH the Study of History be instructive and useful yet in one Respect it becomes the Source of frequent Error even when it is written with Impartiality and Truth This ariseth from a  mistaken Application  of  historical Facts  This Error is apt to creep into all Reasonings on every Subject where  Men  and  Manners  are concerned but it is peculiarly apt to infect  political  Reasonings above all others As the political Interests of Men make  the principal Subject of History so the political Reasoner hath Recourse to History as the best Support of his Argument But though the Politician is of all others the readiest to appeal to History yet he seems of all others most liable to be mistaken in his Application of it to his own Purpose because the political Connexions and Interests of Men are above all others  complicated  and  various  Hence as no two political Constitutions were ever  the same  in  all  their Circumstances though  similar  in  many  so all Arguments drawn from a  partial Resemblance  must be  inadequate  and  inconclusive  unless when it appears that no other Circumstances took Place by which that  partial Resemblance  might be  counteracted  and it's Effects  destroyed  Yet it hath been a Practice too common among political Reasoners from a  partial  Resemblance between two States to infer a  total  one and because they have been  like  in  some  Respects to draw Conclusions as if they had been  like  in  all  Here then appears a Source of perpetual Error  Among all the political Questions that can be debated in a free Country there is none of greater Importance than that which regards the  Character  and  Influence  of the  Body of a People  Nothing hath been more usual among political Reasoners than to represent the  Body  of  every People  as the ready  Tools  of  Demagogues  and  Faction  And since the endless Factions of the  Athenian Republic  have been so often alledged as unanswerable Proofs  of this the intelligent Reader will easily discern that the Tendency of the following Dialogue is to fix this Argument to it's  proper Limits  and prevent a too  general Application  of a  particular Fact  AN ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE OF THE DEAD  PERICLES and ARISTIDES  ARISTIDES  I AM glad to have found you PERICLES Since your Conversation with COSMO which you know I overheard I have been revolving the Subject of it in my Mind and begin to think you left the Matter short  PERICLES  Your Sentiments on this Subject will give me Pleasure Tell me ARISTIDES in what Respect do you esteem the conclusion of our Argument to have been defective  ARISTIDES  With Regard to yourself I think your Conclusions were just I grant you  that by weakening the Power of the Court of the AREOPAGUS you tore up that Anchor which SOLON had fixed to keep his Republic stedfast and firm against the Storms of popular Faction  On this Account I farther must allow that  notwithstanding the Integrity which you preserved in your public Conduct and the great Virtues which you exerted your Place in  Elysium  is justly below that of those who have governed Republics or  limited Monarchies  not merely with a Concern for their present Advantage but with a prudent Regard to that  Balance  of  Power  on which their  permanent Happiness  always depends  PERICLES  If you allow me this it is all I contend for What could remain farther to be adjusted in the Debate  ARISTIDES  I am of Opinion that the Question was decided in too general a Manner And that for Want of a little more Particularity of Argument and Proof Conclusions might be  plausibly  drawn which would be very distant from the Truth  PERICLES  Pray explain yourself a little farther ARISTIDES for as yet I do not clearly comprehend you  ARISTIDES  What I mean is this That Free States or  limited Monarchies  though they may greatly resemble each other in their  external Construction  may yet be so very unlike in their  internal Condition  that no just Conclusions  could be drawn concerning their Prosperity and Welfare merely from their  external Resemblance  Thus we will suppose two States to be equally  free  in their legal Constitution But let us farther suppose that the  Manners  or  Principles  which prevail in these two States are widely different and in that Case I apprehend that if you regard only the legal  Form  of the Constitution without weighing the  Manners  and  Principles  of the Members of the State you will be in great Danger of imposing  false Conclusions  on yourself and others  PERICLES  I did not force any of these Conclusions upon you They are of your own making  ARISTIDES  It is true you did not force them upon me Yet they are not of my own making For some of the  Shades  who overheard your Conversation have since told me that the general Turn of your Discourse  obliquely led  to these Conclusions and therefore  thought that it would become ARISTIDES to discuss this Point with a little more Precision  PERICLES  I am ready to hear any thing you have to say on this interesting Subject  ARISTIDES  You will give me leave then to examine some things that passed in your Discourse with COSMO  PERICLES  Pray be as free with them as you please I rely on the Candor as well as Justice of ARISTIDES  ARISTIDES  I will endeavour to deserve your favourable Opinion You may remember you said  That by weakening the Power of the Court of AREOPAGUS you tore up that Anchor which SOLON had fixed to keep his Republic stedfast and firm against the  Storms of popular Factions  This I think was the first Foundation of your Argument  PERICLES  It was  ARISTIDES  Is it a safe Practice PERICLES to build an Argument on a Metaphor  PERICLES  I should think it is provided the Metaphor contain a just Image of the Fact in Question  ARISTIDES  That I allow but still the Question remains whether the Metaphor contain that just Image or not So that we are not yet advanced a Step towards the Discovery of Truth  PERICLES  At least it is an Illustration  ARISTIDES  Then I think it had better have come after the Discovery I believe I can give you another Metaphor which shall lead directly to the contrary Conclusion 'Tis a wise Practice you say to keep fixed the  Anchor  In general I grant you it is so Yet you know that in Times of Tempest and Distress the most experienced Admiral when anchored near a rocky Shore is forced to  slip his Cables  and commit his Fleet to the  wide Sea  till he can  anchor  on a  safer Bottom  PERICLES  That is a dangerous Practice  ARISTIDES  True and therefore never to be tryed except in a Time of extreme Danger  PERICLES  Well I will grant you that a Metaphor proves nothing  ARISTIDES  That is the only Purpose for which I intended mine We will proceed therefore with our Argument And the sum of what I have to say will only tend to the Proof of this single Point  That a  free State  or  limited Monarchy  resembling that of  Athens  in it's external Form may yet be so differently circumstanced in it's  internal Condition  that a Conduct in many Respects similar to Yours shall be the only means of  saving  that State from Ruin though Your well meant Conduct led the State of  Athens  to it's  Destruction  PERICLES  It seems to me ARISTIDES that you undertake a Task of no small Difficulty Proceed I am all Attention  ARISTIDES  Pray tell me PERICLES Was the Court of the AREOPAGUS  wise courageous uncorrupt  and bent upon the public Service in Opposition to all selfinterested Views when You set about to lessen it's Authority  PERICLES  To my Confusion I must confess it was For in Fact  The annual  Magistrates  the  Guardians  of the  Laws  the  Governors  of the sacred  Rites  and  Chieftains  in  War  were all  chosen  by  Lot  and they who had acquitted themselves  well  in the Discharge of these  Trusts  were advanced and taken into the Court of the AREOPAGUS  Plutarch in his Life of Pericles    ARISTIDES  You are right in your Idea of this  wise  and  disinterested  Court Tell me farther now Was the Body of the Athenian People  sensible honest  and  united  when you threw yourself into their Arms and increased their Power  PERICLES  I cannot say much either for their  Good Sense  their  Uprightness  or their  Union  on the Contrary I fear they were  ignorant selfinterested  and  disunited  Nay I must farther confess that I myself was the Cause and Promoter of their Vices and Factious Temper For I not only gained and ruled them by my  Eloquence  as I confessed in my Conversation with COSMO but  by giving them the Plunder and Possession of the Lands taken from the Enemy and by squandering the public Monies formerly reserved for the Uses of War in Shows and Plays for their Entertainment and by giving them  Largesses  or  Pensions  I brought them from a sober modest and thrifty People who maintained themselves by their own Labours to become riotous and debauched through these mistaken Methods of Policy Thus it was that I turned them against the Court of the AREOPAGUS  Plutarch in his Life of Pericles    ARISTIDES  It gives me Pleasure to find you so much more full and explicit in this Affair than you were in your Discourse with COSMO So then you took Power from a Body of Men  wise disinterested  and  uncorrupt  to put it into the hands of Men  ignorant selfinterested  and  factious  PERICLES  Too true I did  Because I knew that my Eloquence would with these other Methods still  more powerful  subject the People to me and make them the Instruments of all my Desires whereas the AREOPAGUS had an Authority and a Dignity in it which I could not controul  ARISTIDES  So you said in your Discourse with COSMO Let us now reverse these Facts and suppose the Court of the AREOPAGUS had deserted the Principles of their first Institution That either  Luxury  the Love of  Gain  or a  Spirit of false  Ambition  had crept in among them and rendered them either  incapable  and  corrupt  And farther let us suppose that the Body of the People had been  sensible honest  and  united  What had been the Consequence  PERICLES  The Case indeed had been altogether  different  I would give all the Wreaths I ever was honoured with to have built my Conduct on so noble a Foundation  ARISTIDES  I commend your Wisdom though it comes too late The Case indeed had been not only altogether  different  but altogether  contrary  Instead of  destroying  the Commonwealth you had  restored  the tottering Fabrick You had then taken Power from  Folly  and  Corruption  to bestow it on  Sense  and  Integrity  And depend upon it in whatever Body of Men  Sense  and  Integrity  are found  these are the Anchors of the State  PERICLES  Your Maxim looks plausible Yet still I cannot but regard it as a dangerous Practice to make a  Breach  in the established Constitution of a free State  ARISTIDES  So do I And I think your Principle is so far from  overturning  that it  confirms  my Argument  PERICLES  That appears to me a strange Paradox  ARISTIDES  Tell me PERICLES Is not a  Breach  made in the political Constitution of a free State when it's wholesome Laws and Institutions have lost their  Power  and  Efficacy  PERICLES  Certainly  ARISTIDES  And can they so entirely lose their Power and Efficacy in any other Way as by the  Incapacity  and  Corruption  of those who  govern  PERICLES  I allow they cannot  ARISTIDES  Then you see that upon Supposition that the Court of the AREOPAGUS had lost their  Ability  or  public Virtue  'tis they who first deprive the Laws of their  Power  and  Efficacy  and consequently 'tis they who make the  Breach  in the established Constitution  PERICLES  This seems to be true But still why should the People follow their Example and by insisting on  extraordinary Powers  and  Privileges  make a  second Breach  in the Constitution  ARISTIDES  O PERICLES you view the Question with a partial Eye What you call a  second Breach  in the Constitution is indeed no more than the natural Effort of the  sound Parts  of the Body politic to  throw off  the  morbific Matter  by which it is oppressed Thus in the natural Body all Diseases come to their Crisis and a Cure is effected by the Vigour and Activity of the uninfected Parts Whereever then the Disease lies either in the Body politic or the Body natural the sound Parts must check and throw off that which is infected or Death ensues Thus you see supposing the  People  to be  sensible  and  honest  and the Court of AREOPAGUS  corrupted  or  incapable  the only Means of saving the State is the Power which the People have to  check  and  reform  the Court of the AREOPAGUS  PERICLES  But is not this  unhinging  the Constitution  ARISTIDES  So far from it that it is the only Way of  fixing  it by bringing it back to it's first Principles How did this famed Constitution first arise Was it not by the united Consent of the several Ranks of the Community each of which had their several Privileges and Powers appropriated on Condition of applying them to the public Good The Court of the AREOPAGUS violates it's Engagements The Voice of an honest and abused People rouzes them from their fatal Dream What is the natural Consequence Why surely the Reformation of the Court of the AREOPAGUS An  honest  and  sensible  People never desires more than  Redress  of Grievances and when that is obtained return  chearfully  to  Subordination  and  adore  their  Rulers  PERICLES  This is at best an  unstable  and  fluctuating  State of Things  ARISTIDES  Every political State must be in some Degree  fluctuating  and  unstable  unless you  load it with the Chains of  Despotism  But I maintain that the  best Security  nay the  only  one to a  Free  Government lies in the upright  Manners  and  Principles  of it's constituent Members and that whenever there is any Deviation from these the only Possibility of a Restoration lies in the  Prevalence  of the  sound  and  virtuous  Part over that which is  corrupted  in  whatever Part  of the  Community  the  Infection  may lie whether it be the Court of the AREOPAGUS or the Body of the  People  For as it was truly observed in your Discourse with COSMO  Force  or  Caprice  may give  immediate  and  temporary  Power but nothing can give a  lusting Authority  except  Wisdom  and  Virtue  Dialogues of the Dead p    PERICLES  But is not this a dangerous Principle to instill into the Body of the People that they have a Right to controul the Errors of the Court of AREOPAGUS Does it not lead to Sedition and Anarchy And was not this the Consequence of my mistaken Conduct  ARISTIDES  You are now puzzling the Question again by making it  general  I reply then that in your particular Case the Practice was  dangerous  and  fatal  because the Court of the AREOPAGUS was  capable  and  honest  the People of  Athens  were  incapable selfinterested  and  factious  You therefore  tore  up the  Anchor  of the State But suppose the Court of the AREOPAGUS to have been  incapable  and  venal  and you have seen that the  Security  of the Republic was already lost You have seen to use your own Metaphor in the Way of Illustration that the  Anchor  of the  State  was  already torn up  and the only  Bottom  on which it could be again safely  cast  was the  rational Influence  of a  sensible  and  honest People  PERICLES  But supposing I had not  corrupted  the  Integrity  of the  Athenian  People do you think they could have remained secure against the Influence of  indiscreet or venal Orators who encouraged by my Example might have misled their  honest Intentions  and rowzed them into Sedition against an uncorrupted Court of the AREOPAGUS  ARISTIDES  Tell me PERICLES what was the  Number  of the  People  of  Athens  PERICLES  I cannot be precise in this But I know that the Number of those whose Favour and Influence I courted did not exceed that of a  large Audience  I have often harangued them in one  collective Body  ARISTIDES  What was their  Rank  and what their  Employments  in Life  PERICLES  They were composed as you know very well of  Labourers  and  Mechanics  All who were able to  keep  a  Horse  were admitted into the se  ond Order of the  Magistracy  Plutarch in the Life of Solon  And therefore the Body of the People whose  Influence I courted was composed of such as were  not able  to  keep  a  Horse  ARISTIDES  What was their  Capacity  PERICLES  You will not expect much of  That  It was suited to their  Station  ARISTIDES  Your Account is just And therefore I confess PERICLES that in my Opinion they never could be secure against the  Seduction  of indiscreet and venal  Orators  Their  small Number  their  continual Necessities  their  general Ignorance  must for ever expose them to the Delusions of a  powerful Rhetoric  PERICLES  Then I think my Consequence stands good "That the united Voice even of an honest People can be no Ground of Security to a State  ARISTIDES  I grant you it is not where the People are such in  Number Station  and  Incapacity  as in  your Time  the  Athenian  People were But take Heed lest you make your Inference too general The only just Consequence that can be drawn is this that a Republic so circumstanced is absolutely  void  of  all Security  For you see that in Case the Court of the AREOPAGUS was  delinquent  the People were not of sufficient Capacity or Weight to  restore  the  Balance  of the State On the other Hand supposing that Court to be  uncorrupt  you see that the People were liable to be  seduced  to it's Destruction Such a Republic therefore was formed for continual  Factions  while it lasted and then for a  speedy Death  PERICLES  Do you think ARISTIDES that by a  Change  of  Circumstances  these Evils could admit of any Remedy  ARISTIDES  I think they might In your Discourse with COSMO you hinted at a  limited Monarchy  I will therefore leave this  imperfect Form  this  Embryo  of a Commonwealth to speak of a more august Image of a Government Suppose therefore that the  Athenian  State instead of a petty Province had been a large populous and fertile Country governed by a  King  and two Courts vested with higher Powers than that of the AREOPAGUS  The Court of the AREOPAGUS was  judicial  not  legislative  that one of them had been  hereditary  the other  chosen  by the Body of the  People  and that the  Legislative  Power was lodged in the  united Suffrages  of these three  PERICLES  You charm me by the very Supposition What a glorious Republic  ARISTIDES  Do not you see PERICLES that all I have said concerning the State of ATHENS would gain new Strength under such a Supposition  PERICLES  My Views must be narrow indeed if I could not see some Differences arise pray go on  ARISTIDES  In the first Place what could shake such a Kingdom as this if all the several Powers maintained the  Purity  and  Vigour  of their Institution  PERICLES  Methinks I see the Picture of an eternal Government  ARISTIDES  But suppose that by the Excess of Commerce and an Overflow of Wealth  or by any other Cause a pernicious  Luxury  shou'ld creep in and steal unperceived on the  higher Ranks  Suppose farther that the very  Genius  of the  Constitution  formed for the noblest Ends should yet have a natural  Tendency  towards political  Venality  and  Corruption  unless strongly guarded by a  Purity  of  Principle  and  Manners  and suppose this political  Venality  should in Fact creep in along with  Luxury  what Consequences would you expect  PERICLES  You terrify me by the Representation I behold the State on the Brink of  Ruin  Instead of  Ability Courage  and  Public Spirit  among the  leading Ranks  I see them immersed in every fatal  Indulgence  I see their Councils  divided  their Fleets and Armies  disgraced  and some neighbouring PHILIP in Possession of their  Forts  and  Colonies  ARISTIDES  Where would you seek for the  Cure  of these enormous Evils  PERICLES  Certainly no  Cure  can take Place till  Ability Courage  and  Public Spirit  should arise on the Ruins of their  Contraries  ARISTIDES  Your Aim is good But the grand Question is by what  Means  this can be effected  PERICLES  I fear the  Means  must be  violent  I have heard you talk of a  coercive Power  sufficient to  reform Corruption  ARISTIDES  Where do you think this might most probably be found  PERICLES  I am casting about but I cannot find it My Experience makes me afraid of the Interposition of the People  ARISTIDES  What even though they were  honest  and  sensible  Why should you fear the Influence of a  general good Sense  and  Integrity  PERICLES  I cannot conceive it probable that the  lower  Ranks should be more  sensible  or more  upright  than their  Superiors  in Station  ARISTIDES  I can suppse nay I do suppose that many of the  higher  Ranks are  sensible upright  and  worthy  in several Respects That they have many  private Virtues  That  Justice  and  Humanity  are their  allowed Qualities  That their chief Defect lies in their Want of  Public Virtue  in their  Neglect  of the  Public Happiness  PERICLES  What Probability could there be then that the  People  should  attend  to  this  when it was neglected by their  Leaders  ARISTIDES  Tell me PERICLES When there are honest Inclinations in the Soul whence can any Obstructions arise to their due Exertion  PERICLES  Why sure from some  contrary Inclinations  which may  tempt  the Mind from it's  natural Integrity  ARISTIDES  You are right So then if in a State thus circumstanced the Body of the  People  should be more steady than their  Leaders  in their Zeal for the  public Welfare  this must be because they are not liable to the same  Temptations  which might expose them to a like Neglect of the  general Happiness  PERICLES  What you say seems probable  ARISTIDES  Cannot you discern certain Circumstances which would naturally arise and prove strong  Temptations  to the  Great  while the Body of the  People  might for a Time at least  escape  them  PERICLES  Let me weigh the Matter Yes indeed from what you said before I think I can You supposed as I remember that Luxury had crept in  ARISTIDES  Go on I see you comprehend the Argument  PERICLES  I perceive the natural Consequence of this must be that the higher Ranks would be first infected with it and therefore must be exposed to Temptations which the Body of the People would escape  One Temptation  must naturally arise from that  unmanly  or  effeminate  Character which a refined Luxury tends to introduce  Another  from an intemperate Desire of  supplying Expences  now grown  exorbitant  ARISTIDES  You say true But can you point out no farther Temptations to which the leading  Ranks would be naturally exposed beyond the Body of the People  PERICLES  These are what offered themselves to my Thoughts Do you see any more  ARISTIDES  Many and strong onesIn a Kingdom thus circumstanced extensive fertile mercantile rich and populous a countless Number of  lucrative Offices  must arise and be established for the  Protection  and  good Order  of the State  PERICLES  I grant it  ARISTIDES  What Part of the Community do you think would lay Claim to these The  superior  Ranks or the  inferior  PERICLES  Doubtless the  Superior  Their Education Rank Wealth and Influence would naturally lead them to expect a Preference  ARISTIDES  And if you farther suppose that Luxury and Expence prevailed these Posts would be more eagerly sought for in Proportion as they were  more lucrative  PERICLES  True The Profit I fear would often be a leading Motive  ARISTIDES  The higher Ranks then would be naturally assiduous to recommend themselves to those who had the  Disposal  of these profitable Employments while the Body of the People because generally  excluded  from all  Hope  of being raised to them would be  more independent  of those in Power  PERICLES  I must needs grant it  ARISTIDES  See you no Consequences arise  PERICLES  You have convinced me ARISTIDES I see that the  higher  Ranks in such a State though equally possessed of  private  Virtues must be much more exposed to the Temptations of  political Venality  and  Corruption  than the Body of the  People  ARISTIDES  That is the Truth to which I meant to lead you  PERICLES  Yet still I fear the Effects of popular Power because by Experience I know  the Influence of indiscreet and venal  Orators  over the Passions of a misguided infatuated Multitude who thought their Freedom consisted in encouraging Calumnies against the best Servants of the Republic and conferring Power on those who had no other Merit than falling in with and soothing a popular Folly  Dialogues of the Dead p    ARISTIDES  This Objection as I said before may be of Weight in a  small Republic  such as that of  Athens  was in Your Days or Mine But supposing it to have been augmented into a  great populous civilized  and  powerful  Kingdom such as I have now represented which contains more  Square Leagues  than  Attica  contains  Acres  more  Cities  than  Attica  contains  Villages  more  Men  of  Fortune  than  Attica  contains  Mechanics  and the Objection vanishes into nothing I can easily see how a busy Orator may mount the Rostrum and intoxicate an ignorant Multitude that surrounds him and this PERICLES I fear was  your  Imprudence nay perhaps  my own  In a small State like that of  Athens  such an Event as this must affect the public Welfare But in a Kingdom so  inlarged  and so  inlightened  as that which I have supposed the Harangues of an Orator to any surrounding Audience of the People can no more affect the  general Welfare  than the buzzing of an eloquent  Bee  can affect a  Province  when he leads out the murmuring  Hive  on the Mountains of  Hybla  or  Hymettus  PERICLES  Do you think the Difference so great  ARISTIDES  I do Because in a City like that of  Athens  the whole Multitude of the Community is easily  collected  in  one  Body and therefore may be suddenly seduced by an Orator into  one  ill Purpose But in a great and populous Kingdom the whole Multitude of the Community cannot be collected into  one  Body nay nor into a  hundred  Bodies and therefore cannot be suddenly seduced by an Orator into  one  ill Purpose  PERICLES  I grant you the Difference is in this Respect  essential  ARISTIDES  There is another Respect in which the Difference is no less essential and important You have confessed PERICLES that the People or Multitude which you seduced  were  a Rabble of Labourers and Mechanics who had been accustomed to earn their Bread by the Sweat of their Brows  See above and Plutarch in his Life of Pericles  But if  Attica  had been enlarged into so vast a Kingdom as I have here supposed the Body of the People would have been of a Character far  superior  For besides those of the highest Rank and Fortune who would naturally form the two Courts of the AREOPAGUS and aspire to the leading Offices in the Commonwealth besides these I say there would be an innumerable Number of  landed Commoners  the general Body of the  Priesthood  the  rich Merchants  and  wealthy Plebeians  of inferior Rank all  independent  of the Governing Powers many of them of excellent  Ability  as well as  Probity  most of them of Leisure and Education sufficient to enable them to judge of the  leading Lines  or  Features  of an upright Government especially in the great Article of  Protection  from foreign or domestic  Injuries  And can you think it possible that the  good Sense  and  Honesty  of all these should be seduced into their own Destruction by a designing or venal Orator  PERICLES  I must confess it is utterly incredible  ARISTIDES  Still farther As it would be thus impossible to  seduce  by  Eloquence  so it would be no less impracticable to  corrupt  by  Bribes  this  whole Body  of Men to the Desertion of their own true Interest A few nay indeed a Number might be thus corrupted but this would never produce an  united Voice  for the remaining Part and that much the  largest  would loudly  clamour  and thus nothing but  Discord  could arise To silence so many Millions by repeated Bribes would require ten Times the Wealth of CROESUS and more than ever Man nay more than ever Nation possessed  PERICLES  You have Reason in what you say I perceive now that nothing but a fair and open Prosecution of the  general Interest  could ever unite so great a People  ARISTIDES  I am of your Opinion And thus you see that as the  small ignorant  and  needy  Body of the  Athenian  People in such a State as You and I beheld it is the easiest of all to be seduced by Eloquence or gained by Bribes so upon it's being aggrandized into such a  vast knowing  and  wealthy  Body as I have here supposed it would above all others have been secure against the Attacks either of  Eloquence  or  Corruption  PERICLES  I perceive I have been confounding two Things together as being altogether  similar  when in Reality their Qualities are altogether  opposite  and this merely because they are called by the  same Appellation  the  Body of the People  ARISTIDES  At length you see the Foundation of your Error  PERICLES  I confess ARISTIDES that in my Discourse with COSMO these distinguishing Particularities were not sufficiently attended to I drew Inferences and extended Consequences to all free States without Exception which could only be justly applyed to a small Republic circumstanced like that of  Athens  ARISTIDES  You see then PERICLES that if  Athens  had been a great rich literate and powerful Republic under the Appearance and Name of a  limited Monarchy  you could have had no Chance for seducing the whole collective Body of the People either by Bribes or Eloquence  PERICLES  I allow it  ARISTIDES  You see farther that in Case of any Delinquency in the Courts of the AREOPAGUS if you had exerted your Talents in Support of the  general Welfare  this  great  and  grateful  People with one united Voice would have  adopted  and  adored  you Yet only so long as you had made that general Welfare the undoubted Object of your Labours  PERICLES  It seems probable  ARISTIDES  You see then that by building your Power on so firm a Foundation you would have been enabled to dispense  Rewards  and  Punishments  with Justice and Vigour that you could have  displaced  the  incapable  and  unworthy  and put into  Action  those who were  most fit  to discharge the several Offices of the Commonwealth  that you could  by Degrees  have checked the Venality and Incapacity of the various Ranks and thus have given the proper  Elasticity  and  Tone  to the several Parts of the Body politic  PERICLES  All this I think possible to have been done  ARISTIDES  But in doing all this you would have been so far from  unhinging  Government that you would have  newhinged  it when it was  falling  so far from  destroying  the  Balance  of  Power  that you would have  renewed  it when it had been  destroyed  so far from acting with a View to  present Advantage  only that you would have secured the  future Welfare  of the State so far from consulting a mere  temporary Felicity  that you would have fixed it on a Principle of  permanent Happiness  PERICLES  I cannot deny it  ARISTIDES  Haste then PERICLES And lest Mistakes should grow inveterate by Time inform COSMO of all that hath passed between us  FINIS  Lately published by  L DAVIS  and  C REYMERS  ESSAYS on the
