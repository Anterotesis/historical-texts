Publisher  PROEMIUM  POLLIO to Thee my Patron and my Friend  The secret counsels of my soul I send  Long since thy godlike Uncle  JOHN Duke of ARGYLL  held me dear  Fate gave me early to thy House's care  He dy'd and left me unattach'd and free  Left me a legacy from Him to Thee  Mem'ry rare gift but giv'n us to our cost  Thou faithful Register of Good when lost  Each feature of the fav'rite picture trace  Recall his Ease and Dignity and Grace  Trace ev'ry feature of the fav'rite piece  Revive his Grace his Dignity and Ease  His Courage cool his Wisdom void of art  The gentlest Manners and the warmest Heart  His Soul with ev'ry  nobler  noblest  passion fraught  And  pushing  carrying  Friendship sometimes to a fault  In Arts or Arms in Battle or Debate  He guarded grac'd and dignify'd the State  Deserv'd the Laurel and the Bay that crown  The  distant  blended  honours of the Sword and Gown  His Country's Bulwark her Delight and Pride  In War he conquer'd and in Peace he dy'd  His Mem'ry shall to latest times descend  Such was the Man  who  that  bade me call him Friend  And now let Envy all his actions scan  Then brand me for a Flatt'rer if she can  Then let her call me Flatt'rer if she can  The vain reproach I shall with scorn receive  I wanted no distinction He could give  Save one  of all Distinctions the supreme  His Friendship and more precious his Esteem  to all superior and supreme  His Friendship his Affection his Esteem  Oh long and much belov'd  sincerely  Oh dearly  mourn'd  How often has my throbbing bosom burn'd  The fulness  Th' effusions  of a grateful heart to pour  O'er sacred Friendship  Friendship now no more  now alas no more  Ere long my gentle Friend will come thy turn  To check a tear or drop it on my urn  To drop a pious tear on my poor urn  Thy feeling heart will not the task decline  The virtues of Humanity are thine  But tho' from Friendship's source the Passions rise  Which melt  That flood  the Soul and swell into the Eyes  Th' effect will differ tho' the source the same  My tear paid Gratitude but Thine gives Fame  My tear is Gratitude but Thine is Fame  Farewel illustrious Shade for ever rest  Distinguish'd in the Mansions of the Blest  Thence let thy bright Example's brilliant ray  To Wisdom point and light us on our way  From thence while darkling we thy Star survey  Thy bright Example marks and lights the way  'Tis wellThe throbbing of the heart subsides  The blood begins to flow in sprightlier tides  By  From  Thee my Friend the soul with joy surveys  The Page of Mem'ry mark'd with brighter days  By  From  Theethy Mien thy Manners and thy Smile  Recall the gen'rous graceful brave ARGYLL  By Thee thus own'd a Client of thy Race  Where could I with such Dignity or Grace  Thus own'd by Thee thus Client of thy Race  Where could I else with Dignity or Grace  From ev'ry Prejudice and Passion free  Lay bare the Mind's Recesses  as  but  to Thee  Often as from the pomp thy state requires  To Contemplation's cell thy Friend retires  Fast by the banks of Thames his active mind  Dwells on the motley mask he left behind  So far the wide Society extends  So num'rous those  kind Custom calls our Friends  we call from Custom Friends    Yet num'rous as they are so very few  Wish what they ought or as they ought pursue  He scarce can tell what the  dark  whole  Drama means  Or  Can  fix the Plan or separate the Scenes  All would be great but who with Care attends  Whence Greatness springs it's Progress and it's Ends  How to direct their wand'ring footsteps right  Or place their Errors in a stronger light  And mark the Failings that mislead the Throng  Thro' Life shall be the Subject of my Song  AN EPISTLE  POLLIO to Thee thy wellconducted youth  Has form'd thy mind to hear and follow Truth  From Thee the crowds that Wisdom's laws despise  May learn that none are happy but the Wise  That Wisdom blunts the darts Misfortune flings  And lifts to noblest heights Ambition's wings  What then is Wisdom'Tis what gilds Success  What makes it solid infelt Happiness  What keeps th' enlarg'd pursuit to Virtue true  And sinks the selfish in the social view  Say then bright Guide since thy  auspicious  celestial  beam  Lights us thro' Social Happiness to Fame  Say whence the gen'ral Groan th' ensanguin'd Plain  The  royal Butcher  purple Murd'rer  striding o'er the Slain  Sweeping half Human Kind from Nature's face  And forging fetters for the rising race  Say whence and why  Whence then and why  the Venal and the Vile  The Voice of Honour  but  and  the Heart of Guile  Harden'd to crimes and resolute to rise  On  holy Friendship's  Love and Friendship's  violated ties  The mad Voluptuary the selfish Drone  That stifles Merit  ardent  struggling  to be known  From CUNNINGCUNNING  which  that  deforms the mind  Poisons the soil for noblest growths design'd  Blasts Heroes' Laurels  withers  blights  the Statesman's Bays  Cunning o'erturns the Throne she means to raise  Corrupts the Heart contracts the Social Plan  And  strangles  or  smothers  narrows  to Selflove the Love of Man  By That the Soul  a  in  prey to mean desires  Her flight obstructed and impair'd her fires  Panting for Glory anxious to be great  Toils  Moyls  thro' the paths of Baseness and Deceit  But still tho' Fortune all her aid should lend  She finds the Means have overturn'd the end  She loaths  Shrinks at  the servile Croud and brib'd Address  And sickens in the bosom of Success  Wouldst thou my Friend survey with  closer  stricter  ken  These Rival Rulers of the Sons of Men  We'll analyse their complicated frame  And show their Pow'rs their Passions and their Aim  How they dispense to Mortals Good or Ill  And how affect the bosom  which  that  they fill  WISDOM's the Health and Vigour of the Mind  It  That  flows from ev'ry talent justly join'd  From Judgment temp'ring Wit's excessive blaze  And Genius bright'ning what Reflection weighs  Where Judgment tempers Wit's enliv'ning blaze  And Genius quickens what Reflection weighs  Parent of Peace and Guardian of the Brave  And teaching how to conquer and to save  Draws not the sword to fetter but to free  And Vice alone is slain by her decree  She wars on Vice alone and her decree  Draws not the sword to fetter but to free  Her arms bid social Arts and Science rise  And  Conquest scatter  Victory shed  blessings as she flies  If to a narrower sphere her cares descend  Her's is  She gives  the Father Citizen and Friend  Th' indulgent Husband and th' endearing Wife  And all the tender Charities of Life  What rich gifts flow from Wisdom's high command  These gifts then flow from Wisdom's high command  She makes the Vanquish'd bless the Victor's hand  Adorns and dignifies  To raise to dignify  an humble state  Or fits the Robes of Greatness to the Great  She leads where Virtue calls and Fame attends  CUNNING's the tim'rous Guide to sordid Ends  Compos'd of parts which Wisdom calls Defects  And  She  apes her with the talents she rejects  Hence one proceeds with Firmness one with Fear  There manly Caution low Suspicion here  'Tis like false coin by Cheats invented first  The best materials  mimick'd  copy'd  with the worst  Like that it makes the wealth of Knaves alone  And brings as sure destruction when 'tis known  As Lib'ral Arts and Love of Virtue fail  In Courts the Cunning o'er the Wise prevail  The crowds that Vice and Vanity pour forth  Whose claims are founded on their Wants not Worth  Ill brook the manly manners of the Wise  Who scorn to flatter what they must despise  Where solid Worth first forms the fair pretence  Upborne by Probity enforc'd by Sense  Where virtuous Toil must earn what can't be sold  And Genius pants for Glory not for Gold  Where Brib'ry Birth Cabal neglected wait  And Wisdom's hand unbars Preferment's gate  This tribe th' unhospitable mansions shun  And to th' allcourting dome of Cunning run  Run to th' important shrug th' unmeaning hint  Which  That  Cunning ever coins in Falshood's mint  To warm Professions strangers to the mind  To Speech th' Interpreter of Truth design'd  Now taught not to discover but disguise  While the whole Man each Look each Gesture lyes  With all the train of ineffectual cant  To soothe not satisfyto lure not grant  Here the gay scenes with smiles perpetual strike  All smooth all flatt'ring and all false alike  Insidious Praise extols while Envy burns  And feign'd Attachments meet with feign'd Returns  The garb of Worth distress'd cloaks Squandring's tribes  That Int'rest may seem gen'rous when she bribes  Patron and Client turn by turn deceive  Ask from false motives from false motives give  Illfounded all Pretension Promise Grant  Nought real but Profusion  Bribe and Want  Brib'ry Want    Thus Prudence Virtue Parts crowd Wisdom's train  Thus Cunning sweeps the  Lavish  Squand'rer  False and Vain  Just to the Tiller's care the crop succeeds  One binds the sheaf and one collects the weeds  By this we see and see without surprize  The Cunning far divided from the Wise  By this we see how far the distance lies  How wide that parts the Cunning from the Wise  Hear then her Voice whose comprehensive call  Extends to the Great Vulgar and the Small  When Men unfit for Greatness will be Great  Why trust they not  Why don't they trust  to Title and Estate  What Daemon envious of their Peace and Fame  Drives them to make the Care of States their aim  To quit the shade of private life and stray  Where ev'ry weakness glares in open day  Whoe'er in life mistakes his destin'd place  Becomes  sure  the  Author of his own Disgrace  For Heav'n bestows on All sufficient skill  To grace the station which they ought to fill  And tho' to All not equally profuse  Ordain'd us All for Decency and Use  Is Wit deny'd  Hast thou not Wit  be gen'rous and sincere  Fails Learning too  Does Learning fail  let Social Love appear  Let Truth Goodnature Virtue be improv'd  And since thou canst not be admir'd be lov'd  Had Nature's bounty partially been shown  And barr'd up ev'ry road to Fame but one  'Twould seem less strange to see th' unequal strife  That drives us all to shine in Public Life  Less strange that Thirst of Pow'r o'er All prevails  And calls to Vice for aid when Genius fails  How Thirst of Pow'r o'er All alike prevails  And calls in Vice to aid where Genius fails  Is Private Life then void of graceful aims  Are Father Husband Friend  ignoble  ungraceful  names  So far  ignoble  ungraceful  that we rather chuse  Pow'r we want Genius to become or use  The rule that leads us with unerring pace  To tread the various paths of Life with Grace  Let Genius fire the blood or Damps restrain  Confin'd to precepts obvious easy plain  Alike thro' ev'ry rank for practice fit  To guard the plain good Man and grace the Wit  Thro' Court Camp Cottage heard felt understood  Consist in thisbe honest just and good  This well observ'd shall shield the Weak from blame  And lend Defects themselves a softer name  Neglect of this debases all our thoughts  And heightens all our Failings into Faults  Failings and Faults from diff'rent springs proceed  Faults from the Heart and Failings from the Head  Quick to discern and wisely to pursue  And tread Life's labyrinth with Judgment's clue  Are parts that few indulg'd by Heav'n can fill  But all Men may be honestif they will  This Wisdom's laws  which  that  first taught Virtue teach  And place Esteem and Love in all Men's reach  Her Guardian Influence then  to none unkind  severely kind    Which diff'rent pow'rs to diff'rent parts assign'd  And thro' the whole impartial and exact  Ne'er deals the part without the pow'rs to act  Gave Honesty her gen'ral gift and best  To guide support and dignify the rest  To Genius this secures immortal Fame  And consecrates Ambition's boldest aim  Without it all the sparks of heav'nly fire  Or blaze destructive or in smoke expire  Giv'n to distress Mankind and not to save  Thus the same Sword  which  that  weilded by the Brave  In Virtue's cause has sav'd a sinking Land  Does Midnight Murder in a Ruffian's hand  If WISDOM then to All those pow'rs imparts  Which lead us on  That lead alone  to Fame thro' Arms or Arts  And sows with bounty free and unconfin'd  The seeds of Honesty in ev'ry mind  Which vary'd by the soil yet must produce  Or Private Peace of Mind or Public Use  That Use which consecrates the Patriot's dust  That Peace of Mind which ever crowns the Just  Then boldly let the Muse this truth proclaim  Wisdom's the source and Honesty the stream  That wafts us safe thro' Danger and Distress  To Public Fame or Private Happiness  While Cunning weaves a maze without a clue  And  purblind  wav'ring  grasps False Greatness for the True  See the foul monster of gigantic size  On broken Faith and injur'd Friendship rise  Fearful and rash rapacious and profuse  In Temper rigid and in Morals loose  By smiling Treach'ry led with downcast eyes  And prompted by Suspicion whisp'ring lyes  See Ribald Mirth and Begg'ry void of shame  Demure Detraction and loudbawling Blame  These Fiends  Chos'n Friends  by Int'rest rank'd in order stand  And Flatt'ry next with Falshood in her hand  Riot and Guile the wild procession ends  And what Oppression gains Corruption spends  Descend a moment from this fancy'd height  And view the treach'rous scene by Wisdom's light  This pageant Pomp this Homage of an Hour  This painted Grandeur this unweildy Pow'r  Shall shrink when Truth displays her piercing beam  Like the vain visions of a fev'rish dream  Which promise Health and Youth for ever gay  But yield us back to Death at break of day  So soon shall illgot Greatness change it's state  Turn'd to Reproach Contempt and Public Hate  Proceed and think what balm can cure the breast  Where Guilt has enter'd once and banish'd Rest  If we have Friends what Friendship can we trust  That knows us mean ungen'rous and unjust  If we have Foes how grateful to those Foes  To see us toil against our own repose  Such is the fate of Greatness built on Vice  Remorse the purchase Innocence the price  When Wisdom's eye surveys the guilty Great  They move our Pity rather than our Hate  I know they scorn the tricks by which they rise  And view their illgot Pow'r with joyless eyes  They scorn the Prince on whom that Pow'r depends  They scorn their Slaves and most they scorn their Friends  Friendship well chose of ev'ry blessing chief  Doubles our Pleasures and divides our Grief  But view their Friendships can we call them Choice  No 'tis Necessity impos'd by Vice  Which vile and weak itself must always seek  For safety from the Wicked and the Weak  Vileness must on the Villain's aid depend  To plan fresh mischiefs and the past defend  And Weakness trusts the Weak thro' jealous care  As Impotence with Eunuchs guards the Fair  But let this truth into thy mind descend  The Man that makes a Fool or Knave his Friend  Whate'er pretence may seem his choice to guide  Has crimes to perpetrate or crimes to hide  True Greatness sure unfolds a nobler scene  Without majestic and within serene  On Wisdom's height sublime securely plac'd  She plans new glories and enjoys the past  And while the blasts of Rage and Faction blow  Hears the Storm rave and Thunder roll below  There high enthron'd with silent joy surveys  Whole Kingdoms lift their hands in grateful praise  And  Or  soaring still tho' pleas'd with deathless Fame  Ne'er fails beyond our World to stretch her aim  Extends perhaps beyond one World her aim  'Tis her's to plead the suff'ring Orphan's cause  And dry the tear that stern Oppression draws  To call each latent seed of Virtue forth  And  wind up  kindle  modest Diffidence to Worth  If gentle Slumber o'er her eyelids creeps  The Pray'rs of Nations guard her as she sleeps  If Cares the fetter'd Sense from Sleep unbind  Those Cares ensure the Quiet of Mankind  She knows no guilty pang no secret shame  No start of horror from the midnight dream  But wrapt in pleasing thought with ravish'd eyes  Sees Public Good on proud Oppression rise  And watchful o'er the blessings of her hand  Wakes like the Guardian Angel of the Land  Is there a Land  which  that  such a Guard can claim  Led by fair Virtue to the mount of Fame  By Virtue's tut'ring hand borne up to Fame  Where sacred Liberty each breast inflames  And Wealth and Life itself are second names  Which  That  dares when Tyrants strike repel the blow  And lay the mighty Sons of Ruin low  Which  That  once tho' safe herself by Heav'n's decree  Dar'd fight and conquer to set Europe free  And starting at her captive Neighbour's groan  Stepp'd forth and made the glorious cause her own  Is there where Learning may securely soar  Uncurb'd by Churchmen unconstrain'd by Pow'r  Where free Devotion wears an open face  And Reason leads her to the throne of Grace  Tho' various unconfus'd to none a Slave  It's God adoring  Sincere tho' various and to none a Slave  But God is worship'd  by the lights he gave  Is there a Prince intrepid just and wise  Who views his People with a Father's eyes  And pleas'd to guard that Right which Nature gave  Scorns to debase a Subject to a Slave  Should his bright Influence fill the courtly sphere  And Courtiers dare be honest and sincere  Serve tho' they promis'd feel tho' they profest  Nor check the Social Virtues of the Breast  Should Truth  ascend  usurp  suspicious Falshood's seat  And Honesty grow graceful in the Great  Should Wit presume to speak and Learning write  And Pow'r and Lib'ral Arts at length unite  Pronounce that Land the fav'rite Land of Fate  Pronounce the Prince  who  that  rules it truly great  Smit with true Glory's charms thus far the Muse  With eager steps the shining track pursues  Strains ev'ry nerve to raise the fav'rite theme  And fix fair Glory in the blaze of Fame  'Tis her's to praise True Greatness on the Throne  'Tis thine O GEORGE to make that Praise thy own  FINIS
