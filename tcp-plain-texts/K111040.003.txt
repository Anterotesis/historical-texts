 The Third and last Volume OF THE MEMOIRS OF Mrs  Laetitia Pilkington  Written by HERSELF  Wherein are occasionally interspersed VARIETY of POEMS As also the LETTERS of several PERSONS of DISTINCTION With the Conclusive Part of the Life of the Inimitable Dean  SWIFT  Finis Coronat Opus  LONDON Printed for  R Griffiths  at the  Dunciad  in  Paternoster Row    To the RIGHT HONOURABLE Sir  John Lewis Ligonier KNIGHT  of the  BATH  One of his Majesty's most Honourable  PRIVYCOUNCIL  c c  SIR  'TIS Customary with Mankind to deem all Dedicators Flatterers who ra∣ther pay Court to the Fortune of their Patrons than to any real Merit they possess  But in order to avoid Cen∣sure on Account of this too obvious Meanness I have hap∣pily made Choice of a Gentle∣man to present this last Off∣spring of my beloved Mother to of whom had I Eloquence enough to say all that is good and great the World must al∣low 'twere but barely doing Justice to his exalted Character  To expatiate Sir on the va∣rious Points in which you excel would be a Task more fittly a∣dapted to the Accuracy of a  Plutarch  or the Perspicuity of a  Rapin  than a Pen so unskill∣ed as mine in every polish'd Art  Since to display your Mag∣nanimity in the Field Wisdom  in the Council singular Polite∣ness and universal Benevo∣lence demands the Flowers of Rhetorick and Poesy  Yet Sir that you are dear to the Soldier as his Honour to the Publick as a Guardian and to all who are bless'd with a Participation of your social Hours as a sincere Friend and most agreeable Companion I hope I may be allow'd to say  I should never Sir have ar∣rived at the Honour of draw∣ing even this imperfect Sketch of Sir  John Ligonier  but that I retained the Sentiments from my Mother whose Intent it was had she liv'd to have inscrib'd this Volume to you  In this Address therefore Sir at the same Time that I satisfy my own Ambition I do an Action grateful to the Manes of a departed Mother since though she hated Vice and was bold enough to reprove it Goodness like yours was her darling Theme  I have the Honour to be with unspeakable Respect  SIR  Your most devoted Most Obedient And most humble Servant  J C Pilkington  Longacre  J  n  THE PREFACE  LEST the World should imagine I publish'd this Volume in or∣der to displease my Father or any other Person the  Reflection of which would give me the utmost Uneasiness I thought it quite necessary in this Place to declare the Rea∣son it lay so long in Obscu∣rity and why it is at this Time made publick  My Mother before her Death had taken in a Number of Sub∣scriptions in  Ireland  and after her Departure from Life as I was left quite destitute of Money or Friends I was obliged to pursue the Design of Printing the Vo∣lume to which I was encourag∣ed by several Persons of real Worth and Distinction but tho' I became indebted to the Pub∣lick it was never in my power  to raise a sufficient Sum to de∣fray the Expence of Printing but on the contrary thro' the Resentment of those whom my Mother had formerly describ'd I was not only basely traduc'd in my Reputation but plung'd into a World of Calamities which I may perhaps at some Time hereafter relate together with the various Pas∣sages of my Life However amongst many Accusations that fell heavy on me one was that I had defrauded the Publick by taking Sub∣scriptions to a Work which I not only had not a Design of Printing but one that never existed except in my Imagi∣nation as they were kind  enough to declare that my Mother never wrote such a Book  Yet should I have been con∣tent to have stood all this Re∣proach and much more nay as the Subscribers were Persons of Fortune and Humanity whose Contributions proceeded more from a Desire of serving me than a Curiosity to see the Book I would have re∣main'd their Debtor for ever sooner than have brought such an Affair over but that having a Wife and Family to support and finding it impos∣sible to obtain from my Fa∣ther the smallest Succour  though I applied to him in the most submissive and pathetick Manner On the contrary when I found him endeavour∣ing to hurt me in the Opini∣on of  Particularly the Lord Bishop of  Derry  to whom I am much obliged  those with whom I had some Interest I thought it but prudent to acquit my∣self of the Charge of Dishones∣ty by delivering the Books to my Benefactors and at the same Time to endeavour to make as much as possible by it To this end I came to  London  last  October  but had not brought the Manuscript with me which was in the  Hands of Mr  Powel  Printer in  Dublin  I thought it prudent not being overstocked with Cash to try how a Subscrip∣tion would take in  London  before I ventured to pay a Sum which was due to  Powel  I therefore printed Proposals and communicated my Plan to Mr  Foote  who had when in  Ire∣land  profess'd a great Friend∣ship for me not without some Cause as will be seen hereaf∣ter He highly approv'd my Project and assured me I might make a considerable Sum by it and that for his own Part he would get me at least a hundred Subscribers all which not knowing the Gen∣tleman's  real Disposition I sincerely believed His Farce of the  Englishman  in  Paris  was at this Time acting and I ventured to write the following Lines upon it which I sent to him in a Letter and beg'd his Permission to insert them in the Daily Advertiser  To  Samuel Foote  Esq  on seeing his  Englishman in Paris  When brilliant Merit justly claims Applause  Commands Esteem and Ad∣miration draws  When ev'ry Action suits to please Mankind  Delights the Sense and elevates the Mind  Each Bard enraptur'd should exalt his Lays  And gladly pay his tributary Praise  Yet  British  Wits are silent when they see  Thy last inimitable Comedy  In which a Spirit lives through every Part  That charms that sooths that captivates the Heart  'Tis thine O  Foote  with a peculiar Ease  At once to lash t'instruct us and to please  So sweet yet poignant all your Satires flow  That patiently from you our Faults we know  The Dunce the Fribble the affected Wit  Chastiz'd by you must silent∣ly submit  Still may  Britannia  with a grateful Sense  Thy matchless Labours strive to recompense  Thus we in Time may ev'ry Error find  And  Foote  still prove a Mirror to Mankind  The Gentleman was pleased to honour me with the follow∣ing Answer  Dear Sir  IT is impossible for me to thank you as I ought for  your inclosed Favour and full as impossible for me to answer the Contents of your obliging Letter  To correct it  there is at present such a Conflict in me between Modesty and Vanity that as neither can get the better I must leave the Destination of your elegant Piece to your own Discretion  I am Dear Sir Most sincerely Yours SAMUEL FOOTE  CoventGarden  An indifferent Person would now imagine that this Gen∣tleman was inclinable to serve me but whether he contract∣ed Insincerity in his late Tour to  Paris  or whether 'tis na∣tive to him I know not But when I went to him with the Subscription Papers he took a Quantity of them and desired me to call in about a Week he then excus'd himself by saying he had been unwell but finally when I press'd him hard he wrote me the follow∣ing polite and obliging Note  SIR  I am sorry the disadvantage∣ous Light in which some of your Countrymen have pla∣ced you here has put it out of my Power to be as useful to you as I could wish I have sent you Half a Guinea toge∣ther with all your Subscripti∣ons you will consider that the many Calls I have of this Kind though not too much for my Inclination are a little too heavy for my Income  Yours c SAMUEL FOOTE  I shall make no Comment in this Place upon this extra∣ordinary Revolution perhaps as he says himself  'Tis Pride nay something worse the Pocket's low  Epilogue to the  Englishman  in  Paris  But on his acting the Charac∣ters of  Ben the Sailor  and  Buck  in the  Englishman  in  Paris  one Night some envious anony∣mous Scribbler furnished out the following Lines and as that Gentleman's transcendant Abi∣lities are superior to any low Things of this Nature that can be said I hope it will not be  thought Malice in me to tran∣scribe them here  To  Sl Fte  Esq  on his condescending to enact  Ben  and  Buck  Oft hast thou sought the Comick Muse in vain  While thy strain'd Gesture but excited Pain  For when Sir  Courtly Nice  was play'd by thee  The murm'ring Audience cried  it cannot be    With like Success some other Parts you tried  Nay ev'n for Favour in the  Buskin  vied  But all in vain you were com∣pell'd to drop it  And act the Satyr the Buffoon and Poppet  i e  In the Haymarket    Till wisely pond'ring what compos'd your Mind  Where you no gen'rous Senti∣ment could find  You saw the Error and to end Dispute  Shin'd in your native Charac∣ter a  Bte  I am told that the ludicrous Author of this was not threat∣ned with so slender a Re∣venge as Tea or Coffee but abso∣lute  Newgate  and the  Pillory  which poor Subtersuge gave him so much Reason to pity  his Antagonist that he has since held him incorrigible be∣low the Notice even of a Scribbler  And here I cannot help re∣marking at the same Time that I return my most sincere Acknowledgments to my no∣ble Subscribers in  England  that amongst the Number of Persons whose Characters my Mother had endeavour'd to il∣lustrate by due Praise not one except his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  and Sir  John Ligonier  to whose superlative Bounties I am unspeakably in∣debted would assist me But as they are the greatest and no∣blest Characters which com∣pose her Writings I must e'en  content myself and tho' this Volume is not in Octavo which I at first propos'd but was af∣terwards oblig'd to alter my Design in order to make it match the other two I am persuaded that as my Subscri∣bers are compos'd of the great∣est and best Persons in  England  they will pardon that Defect since it contains the purposed Quantity  The Irish Edition is in Octavo  However any Person who imagines they have paid too much shall have the Overplus return'd on sending to me  N B  A List of Subscribers is omitted for particular Reasons which the Reader will be better qualified to guess at after he has perused the ensuing Pages  MEMOIRS OF Mrs Letitia Pilkington  A Third Volume of Memoirs is really a bold Undertaking as they are generally light frothy and vain yet I have met with such un∣hop'd Success that I am quite encouraged to proceed more especially as my Word is pass'd to the Publick and my Word I have ever held sacred I cannot like a certain Female Writer say I hope if I have done nothing to please I have done nothing to offend for truly I mean to give both Pleasure and Offence Lemon and Sugar is very pretty I should be sorry to write a Satire which did not  sting nor will I ever write a Panegyrick on an Undeserver If a Rogue should happen to be mine honest Friend I owe him Silence but that is the most he can expect  Many indeed are glad to become Pur∣chasers of it Persons whom I know nothing of come and beg I may not put them into the Third Volume and they will subscribe Surely then they should knock at their own Hearts and if it confess a natural Guiltiness  Let it not breathe a Thought upon their Tongue  To my Dishonour  Shakespear  I threaten not any nor did I ever do it but Characters are my Game who  Eye Nature's Walks shoot Folly as it flies  And catch the Manners living as they rise  I should now be glad to know how I could prosecute my own History without intermingling that of others I have not lived in Desarts where no Men abide nor in a Cave like  Eccho  therefore it  is no more in my power to grant such unreasonable Requests when a Book is requir'd of me than it is in that of an historical Painter to give a good Piece when he is positively commanded never to draw the Likeness of any thing in Heaven or on Earth  But Oh my dear LADIES why are you so frightened Why so many Supplica∣tions to a Person unacquainted with you Have you all then a sore Place which you are afraid I should touch But now  Taken from the Play of  Pyramus  and  Thisbe  in  Shakespear  's  Midsummer Nights Dream  I say this to you or to the same Defect Ladies or most fair Ladies I would re∣quest you not to fear not to tremble my Life for yours if you think I come as a Lion 'twere Pity of my Life No no I am no such thing I am a Woman as other Women are  But after all it does not a little sur∣prise me that every Person who suffers a Panick lest their own Reputations should be attack'd has not a little Com∣passion for that of another No no let  them find a Flaw in a Brilliant and by the Help of their magnifying Talents they shall dim it all over If they look upon this as a Virtue 'tis one I shall never be emulous of  I remember Doctor  Swift  told me he once dined at a Person's House where the Part of the TableCloth which was next to him happened to have a small Hole in it which says he I tore as wide as I could then asked for some Soop and fed myself through the Hole The Dean who was a great Friend to Hous∣wifery did this to mortify the Lady of the House but upon my Word by the general Love of Scandal and De∣traction in  Dublin  one might reasonably imagine they were all to feed themselves through the Holes which they had made in the Characters of others  But 'tis of no Consequence to me as Treason and Malice now have done their worst  Shakespear  Reputation once gone is never to be retriev'd The Wise say it is as often  gain'd without Merit as lost without a Crime so I must comfort myself the best I can The Fable of  Reputation Fire  and  Water  is too well known to want a Recital and to quote a Paragraph from a late Letter of Mr CIBBER'S to me in Answer to one of mine wherein I had acquainted him that a Gentleman who had formerly been prejudiced against him was now his very sincere Admirer as his Lines may in some Measure be applicable to me I shall insert them as follows  It is now growing too late in Life to be much concerned about whatever Good or Evil the World may think it worth their while to say of me All I have to do is to fix a Consciousness of my own Integrity and then let the Devil do his worst Truth has a strong Arm and in that the weakest Person living with an honest Heart may trust for their Protection  So let this serve by way of  Preface  while I proceed in my  Narrative  or  Take the sprightly Reed and sing and play  Careless of what the censuring World may say  And here before I proceed to give Ease to every Heart which may possibly suffer any Anxiety on Account of what might be said of them I proclaim Peace to all but those who have directly af∣fronted me 'Tis but a mean Piece of Cowardice to insult a Woman and as some Gentlemen have had the Courage to challenge me by the known Laws of Chivalry I have a right to chuse the Weapons a  Pen  is mine let them take up another and mayhap they will meet their Match  But  Hibernian  Writers are evermore threatened not with the Wit of their Antagonists but the Arm of the Flesh and truly that is such a knockdown Ar∣gument as I at least am utterly unable to resist  Upon my Word were any Folly of mine to produce real Wit in another Per∣son  I should not be displeased to be roundly rallied  I was very well diverted with Mr  Woodward  's  When this Gentleman exhibited at  Dublin  in Opposition to Mr  Foote  's Tea  Coffee and humorous Description of me crying  Subscribe or else I'll paint you like the Devil  Though how I who never either was a dramatick Writer or a Player came to have such extraordinary Marks of Dis∣tinction paid me from the Theatre is more than I can readily account for  However I enjoy'd the Jest and the worst Mark of Resentment I shew'd was to send him a Crown for a Box Ticket which he graciously accepted and in Re∣turn got his Friend in the College to add six Couplets of Scurrility to his for∣mer Encomium on me  No marvel for I remember the Dean told me he paid a Man's Debt on Ac∣count of his having wrote something tollerably good and the next Proof he gave of his Talents as soon as he was  releas'd from Jail was to write a Satire on his Benefactor and Deliverer I told this Passage to Mr  Cibber  who assured me he had been just serv'd in the same Manner  Gratitude is of all Virtues the most seldom practis'd the Cause of this De∣fect I take to be our innate Pride few Persons can bear to be under the Weight of an Obligation not considering that  The grateful Heart by paying owes not  But stands at once indebted and discharged  MILTON  Doctor  Swift  very well observes that many Persons have done a  just  many a  generous  but few a  grateful  Act  I have indeed experienced Gratitude even to painful Extasy especially when you my dear and honoured Lord  Kings∣borough  vouchsafe to cheer my Habita∣tion with the Muses Loves and Gra∣ces in your Train with all the Virtues that adorn the  Good  and every shining Excellence which distinguishes the  fine  Gentleman So  Cyrus  deigned to visit  Zoroaster  and bless his solemn Grotto  You have my Lord another Talent which as Leisure and Fortune give you a Power of exerting it I hope you will and which by the Honour you have al∣lowed me of being your Correspondent I have discovered and like a true Wo∣man cannot bear the Pain of keeping a Secret Amongst all the Letters I have yet seen published I never saw any so truly elegant learned and polite as those with which your Lordship has con∣descended to honour your poor Servant Invoke then my Lord the sacred Nine not one of the beauteous Virgins can be coy to such a Lover resembling so much their own  Apollo  I am very certain they have all bestow'd their Favours though you are too much the Man of Honour to reveal it  Let  Britannia  boast her  Shaftesburys Dorsets Mulgraves  and let us tell her in Return we have our  Kingsborough  And here I must vindicate the Learning as well as the Politeness of the Nobility  though it be in Opposition to Mr  Pope  's Opinion who says  What woeful Stuff this Madrigal would be  In some starv'd Hackney Sonnetteer or me  But let  My Lord  once own the happy Lines  How the Wit brightens how the Stile refines  Why sure every Person must acknow∣ledge that while  he  is insulting  his  Bet∣ters his Ethic Epistles are little more than Lord  Shaftsbury  's Rhapsody be∣rhym'd  his Windsor Forest  stollen from  Cooper  's  Hill  and his  Eloisa  and  Abe∣lard  the most beautiful Lines in it taken from  Milton  's  Il Penseroso  and if I wrong his Merit let the Learned judge Mr  Pope  says in his Description of the Convent  Where awful Arches make a Noonday Night  And the dim Windows shed a solemn Light  MILTON says  And story'd Windows richly dight  Shedding a dim religious Light  Which of these is best I leave to any Person of Taste to determine  POPE  From the full Choir when loud Hosanna's rise  And swell the Pomp of dreadful Sacrifice  MILTON  There let the pealing Organ blow  To the fullvoic'd Choir below  For Service high  c  But I forget and am launching into a Criticism e'er I am aware of it  Now though I have held out the Olive Branch to my Friends to whom I would be kind as the liferendering Pelican yet my Foes are not included in the Trea∣ty  You my Lady of the Fishponds and Lakes of  Lebanon  must be remem∣bered  And I cannot avoid paying my Acknow∣legements to the Vice Queen of a certain Village  ViceQueen  I term you for the lovely  Lady  Ann Conn  lly  Goddess of the Plains has as much Humanity and Politeness as you want and I cannot pay her a higher Compliment though indeed it is no wonder as she is the Daughter of an  Eng∣lish  Earl and you derive your Pedigree from a  Scotch  Pedlar I will not name you because you shall not take the Law of me but describe you I will  Pray when I sent you a Book how came it to intitle me to an Affront and your civil Message that if my third Vo∣lume was worth reading you would buy it at the Stationer's Why it will cost you a Crown there  But how long have you commenced a Judge of the Belles Lettres That you may be a competent one of Men no∣body disputes and for your Honour I  believe a certain Relation of mine was pretty intimate with it at *********  And do you and your two Compani∣ons take a Frisk still now you are grown old Certainly it must be as entertaining as the Witches in  Macbeth  Why Madam had I said that your Far died blaspheming the Almighty and of the foul Disease had I said that he refus'd to see his Wife's Cubbs as he call'd your Sisters at the Hour of his Death had I said that you hid Lady  D  behind the Arras to seeNothingwhich you said your little Tom Titmouse of a Husband had you cou'd not have used me worse  But I scorn your low Invectives which savour more of Malice than of Wit these and many other valuable Se∣crets which I have the Honour of know∣ing of you shall be buried in Oblivion  Stand apart now ye  Roderick Randoms  Foundlings  bastard Sons of Wit  Hence ye Profane be far away  All ye that bow to Idol Lusts and Altars raise  Or to false Heroes give fantastick Praise  While I the Cream of Historians Mir∣ror of Poets worthy not only the Bays but the Laurel made for mighty Con∣querors for my signal Victories pro∣ceed in my true History which take as follows from me the genuine Successor of  Cid Hamet  and immortal SWIFT  Thus much may serve by Way of Proem  Proceed we now to Tale or Poem  ONE Day as I was sitting in my Shop  Vide the d Vol of these Memoirs  a Woman who though very badly drest had a Dignity in her Air which distinguish'd her from the Vul∣gar stood reading the Paper I had stuck up with Regard to writing Let∣ters and Petitions At length she came in and begg'd of me to write a Petition for her to his Majesty from whom as she said she hop'd for a Pension I  asked her what Title she had to it She said if I could have Patience to hear her Story she was certain I would think she had a very just one As I was fond of Novelties I assured her she could not oblige me more so to avoid Interrup∣tion I took her into the Parlour when she began her History as follows  I am said she Grandaughter to the Marquis of  Vendosme  my Mother whose Name was  Margaretta de Tia∣ange  was one of the most celebrated Beauties in the Court of  France  The late Electress of  Hanover  poor Lady though her Husband was crown'd King of  England  she never was ac∣knowledg'd as Queen had so fond an Affection for her that she could not think of parting with her but when she was married entreated she would accompany her to  Hanover  their uni∣ted Prayers prevailed on my Grand∣father to give his Assent and the Electress plac'd her in Quality of the first Lady of her Bedchamber that  she might ever have her near her Per∣son  Whatever Regret my Mother felt at the strange Difference she found be∣tween the Court of  Paris  and the House of  Herenhausen  yet being happy in the Favour of her Royal Mistress young and chearful she made herself quite easy and she and Count  Con∣ningsmark  used to set their Heads to∣gether to study what might be most amusing to the lovely Lady  But alas while they thought only of Innocence the Princess  Sophia  and the Dutchess of  Munster  a discarded Mistress of the  Elector  's had other Schemes in their Heads which not long after they put in Practice to the Destruction of the  Count  the Disgrace of the  Electress  and the Banishment of every Person whom she honoured with her Confidence  I have frequently heard my Mo∣ther declare that she believ'd there was not in the World a more virtuous Person than the Electress and in∣deed  her Conduct from the Time of her Separation from the late King to the Hour of her Death sufficiently convinced the World of her unspotted Purity  Well in the general Ruin my Mother as her first Favourite was in∣evitably involv'd She was order'd to return home to  France  and as she was a Woman of Quality a Man of War was fitted out for that Purpose  I could not here avoid interrupting her to say I wonder'd that the Princess  Sophia  should enter into any Scheme which might in the least reflect on the Honour of her own illustrious Family she answer'd the Princess lov'd nothing so well as Dominion and as the Ladies of  France  had a natural Turn to Politicks she was afraid the Electress might inter∣fere so as to injure her Power which was almost absolute Oh Ambition by what cruel Means dost thou compass thy Ends I desired her to proceed which she did as follows  My Mother return'd home safe though much dejected at a Separa∣tion from her Mistress with whom had she been permitted she would willingly have embraced an Exile from the gay World But as Time insen∣sibly wears off Affliction and lessens the Object by removing it to a greater Distance so she began to resume her native Chearfulness and once more shone at Court  The first Night she appeared there an  English  Nobleman for as such he pass'd himself neither did his good Mien or Politeness in the least con∣tradict this generally received Opini∣on paid his Addresses to her Gal∣lantry and Complaisance are so much the Mode at  Paris  that my Mother took all he said of  his  Passion and  her  Charms meerly as Words of Course and told him so he answered that he found she was unacquainted with the Temper of the  English  who above all other People particularly valued themselves on Sincerity and scorned  Deceit or Hypocrisy even to the Fair to whom most Men practise it She answer'd the Ladies in his Country must certainly be very happy he said the most convincing Proof he could give of the Reality of his Passion was that provided her Heart and Hand were disengaged he would use his utmost Endeavours to merit both She assured him she was intirely at her Father's Disposal and that if he was serious in his Declaration he must ap∣ply to the Marquis of  Vendosme  Ac∣cordingly next Day he paid the Mar∣quis a Visit and brought such Cre∣dentials of his being a Man of For∣tune and Quality in  England  that the Marquis had but one Objection which was an Unwillingness to part with my Mother however my Father pro∣mised they would once a Year pay the Marquis a Visit So all Things being agreed on the Marriage was celebra∣brated with great Pomp and Fes∣tivity  No sooner were the Rejoicings end∣ed than it was whisper'd my Father was not a Man of Quality but an Impostor This greatly afflicted both the Marquis and my Mother they mentioned it to my Father who as∣sured them it was a malicious Fal∣shood rais'd by some Persons who en∣vy'd his Happiness As it was too late to retract what was done they could only hope the best Shortly after my Father urg'd a Necessity of his returning to  London  to which the Marquis reluctantly consented  At  Dover  my Father's Chariot met them carried them to a very handsome House where there were a Number of Servants in rich Liveries waiting the Commands of the Bride and Bride∣groom  But after all not to hold you longer in Suspense my Father was a Limner but so excellent in his Art that he could well afford to keep his Wife like a Man of Quality However as there is no Country where Persons set  a higher Value on noble Blood than  France  my Mother was cruelly mor∣tified to find herself imposed upon and fell into a deep Melancholy which preying on the very Pith of Life she languish'd in a Consumption for three Years and died leaving me and another Daughter desolate Orphans  After this Loss which I was too young to regret my Father brought in a Woman whom it seems he had some Time kept as a Mistress to order his Houshold and take care of us which she did so well that at length my Father married her  Here happened a most strange Re∣verse of Fortune to us For no sooner did this Woman attain her Ends than she altered her Conduct and from a fawning Servant turned a haughty and despotick Tyrant My Father was oblig'd to turn off all his old Ser∣vants because they did not pay Res∣pect enough to her Ladyship for he had the Honour of Knighthood con∣ferred on him by King  William  This StepDame now continually endeavour'd to set my Father against us till at length wearied out with In∣juries I hired myself as a Servant to the Governor's Lady of  St Christophers  and she being informed who I was treated me with the utmost Kindness  This unhealthful Climate soon de∣prived me of her who with her dying Breath recommended me to the Care of the Governor he called me up told me her Request and kindly said whoever was dear to her it should be his particular Care to protect even for her Sake  I kneeled down by the Bedside to bless them both for their Goodness my Mistress took my Hand grasp'd it very hard and instantly expir'd  I fainted away and my Master as I was afterwards informed quitted the Chamber bidding the Servants take care of the poor Child  When the Funeral was over and that the first Transports of my Master's Sorrow were abated he desired to see  me and renew'd his kind Assurances of Protection and Favour to me He made me dine at his Table saying that my innocent Prattle diverted his Melancholly and I studious to please him did it so effectually that instead of my being his Servant he became mine and as he was too humane and generous to entertain a dishonourable Thought he proposed Matrimony to me an Offer too considerable for me to reject  The Evening before the Day ap∣pointed for our Nuptials my dear Master Friend and Lover was taken very ill on which they were deferred But his Illness increasing he thought proper to have the Marriage Ceremo∣ny performed made his Will and as he had no Children left me all his Fortune and died the next Day  Though I cannot say I was in Love with this Gentleman yet Gratitude made me a sincerely sorrowful Widow though I was young rich and as the World said handsome  When my Year of Mourning ex∣pired I had several Matches proposed to me of which I made Choice of the worst He was an  Englishman  but to say the Truth had nothing but his Person to recommend him He was addicted to every Vice and conse∣quently soon squandered the plentiful Fortune I had brought him  And at last one Day when I was abroad he robbed the House of every thing it contained that was valuable and he with a Negro Woman Ser∣vant I had got on board a Vessel bound for  England  I was now plung'd into not only the Extremity of Sorrow but also of Want However being very expert at my Needle particularly in Em∣broidery and also very curious in Shell Work I set up a School and in∣structed young Ladies Money is very easy to be got there and so it ought for the Island is productive of nothing for the Service of Life nei∣ther  Fruit nor Herbage and conse∣quently there are no Cattle but what they have either from the Continent or salted from  England  Well bad as the Place was I lived there thirty Years after the Departure of my second Husband tolerably easy till at length I received from an  English  Captain of a Ship a Letter from the Sister I have mentioned who was extremely well married in  Lon∣don  and gave me a kind Invitation to come and pass the Remainder of my Life with her  Accordingly I embraced the first Opportunity of returning to my dear native Country all the Ladies entreat∣ed me to stay but finding me deter∣mined to the contrary they gave me signal Marks of their Favour Each making me a Present and assuring me that if ever I returned I should be af∣fectionately received  We had a tolerable Voyage even till we were in Sight of the English Shore when a furious Tempest arose  which set us almost beside ourselves The Goods were thrown over Board so that I lost all my Cloaths and a few Minutes after we struck upon a Rock but by God's Providence not a Soul perished All that I saved was a Basket of Curiosities such as the Island afforded  But not to detain you with trivial Circumstances I got to  London  and went to my Sister's House which I found hung with black she in her Coffin and the Hearse ready to con∣vey her to the Grave  This was a dreadful Disappointment to me for I was quite a Stranger moneyless and could not reasonably hope for much Favour from a Bro∣therinlaw whom I had never seen especially as the Link of the Chain which united us was now dissolv'd  The next Day I went to him and upon telling him the Circumstances of my Life exactly as my Sister had done he had the Goodness to give me  her Cloathes a seasonable Relief as my own were lost  The following Day I went into a Broker's Shop to know if the Person who kept it would buy some of my Merchandize He desired me to come in and seemed surpris'd at the Variety and Beauty of my Collection and perceiving me very faint for indeed I was all almost famish'd he offered me a Dram which I refus'd as I was sensible it must have got the better of one so weak as I was  However I accepted of some Toast and Ale which I really think saved my Life After this Act of Civility I told my Distress to him and he kindly gave me a Lodging and re∣commended me to you  I wrote a Petition for this unhappy Stranger which had no manner of Ef∣fect on his Majesty I afterwards wrote to her Brotherinlaw who gave her Five Guineas with which Sum she again set out for  St Christophers  and as I after∣wards  learne the Ship with all the Pas∣sengers were lost  I think this poor Lady's Life was but a continual Scene of Storms and Misfor∣tunes as if Heaven had  Bar'd her Bosom to the Thunderstone  But alas how shall we poor Reptiles presume to judge the Ways of Pro∣vidence all things are ordered with Har∣mony and Beauty though like a Fly our feeble Ray sees but an Inch around yet dares dislike the Structure of the Whole  As well might a Mariner in the midst of the wide World of congregated Wa∣ters hope with his Line to sound the deep Abyss as our finite Minds to com∣prehend the Ways of Deity  Here then let us rest  Whatever is is right Wisdom and Goodness govern all  Reader have Patience with my Philo∣sophick Whimsies which I must some∣times indulge 'Tis frequent in Con∣versation to say of those that are drown'd That they are gone to the Bottom of the Sea but with due Deference to better Judges I cannot conceive the Ocean to have any Bottom except near the Shore I have observed every single Drop of Water to be an intire Globe put an∣other to it they unite by Adhesion of Parts like Quicksilver to form a larger Thus the tributary Streams pour in glo∣bulous Chrysolites to form that won∣drous Mass of Waters which we term the Ocean and which no Doubt goes quite through the Center of the Earth without any middle Way to stop it  I know it may be here objected that a Ship lost on one Side ought by this Rule to rise at the opposite Place Not at all the Pressure of the Atmosphere is everywhere equal nor is there any such thing as up or down in Nature As many Stars bespread the Firmament beneath us as above us As Travellers such as have  sailed round the World sufficiently evi∣dence and did not the strong Laws of Gravitation hold all in firm Union the Sea no Doubt would tumble on our Heads  Oh thou rever'd Spirit of NEWTON who couldst take the Dimension of each Planet in our Solar System and then de∣monstrate to us  How other Planets circle other Suns  Giving us thereby the most august View of that Being who pour'd forth new Worlds to all Eternity and peopled the Infinity of Space If I have err'd through Pride in endeavouring to search into the Secrets of Nature wherein I may very possibly err let thy honour'd Manes vouchsafe to set me right  For I so much a Catholick will be  As for this once great Saint to pray to thee  Cowley  I think I have scarce ever read Two better Lines than Mr POPE's Epitaph  on this Prince of Philosophers which to prove my regard to him as a Poet I will insert  Nature and Nature's Laws lay wrapt in Night  GOD said Let  Newton  be and all was Light  His Inscription on Sir  Godfrey Kneller  's Monument is as remarkably bad as this is excellent  See  WestminsterAbbey  Kneller  by Heav'n and not a Master taught  Whose Art was Nature and whose Pic∣tures Thought  When now two Ages he had snatch'd from Fate  Whate'er was beauteous and whate'er was great  Rests crown'd with Princes Honours Poets Lays  Due to his Merit and brave Thirst of Praise  Living great Nature fear'd he might out∣vie  Her Works and dying fears herself shall die  And bad as it is 'tis but a lean Transla∣tion from the  Italian  an enervate Lan∣guage well adapted to the soft Warblers of it but incapable of manly Strength Dignity or Grace  I always find in myself a strong Incli∣nation to Criticism and if I live to finish this Volume I shall certainly indulge it For my Part let the World say what they please of Criticks I esteem them as very useful Members of the Common∣wealth of Learning Whatever is well written will stand the Test of strict Exa∣mination ay and of Ridicule too and when that is past the Work appears like Gold from the Furnace with tenfold Lustre Therefore I fairly invite the whole Body of Criticks to canvas my Writings if they point out an Error I shall esteem them as Friends and en∣deavour to amend If they make an in∣judicious  Criticism for some such I have seen publish'd against me they prove their own Ignorance and cannot give me a greater Triumph I only wish I may have a  Longinus  not a  Zoilus  to judge me  Well now Mrs  Pilkington  says per∣haps my Reader What in the Name of Wonder have we to do with all this  Why truly no more I think than with a Buff Jerkin or mine Hostess at  St Albans  but I am no Methodist either in Writing or Religion sometimes Irregularities please shapeless Rock or hanging Precipice present to the poe∣tick Imagination more inspiring Dreams than could the finest Garden Where  Grove nods at Grove each Alley has a Brother  And half the Platform just reflects the other  I am in short an Heteroclite or irre¦gular Verb which can never be declined or conjugated  But however considering it was a His∣tory of myself I promised to the World I now proceed in it thus  Two very fine young Gentlemen whom I did not know came to buy some Prints and observing a large Book in Manuscript open before me one of them demanded Was that my AccountBook I assured the Gentlemen my Re∣venue was easily cast up and that I was but a bad Arithmetician though I fre∣quently dealt in Figures and Numbers  This Gentleman whom I presently after found was an Earl by his Com∣panions calling him by his Title in∣sisted on seeing the Subject of my Amusement This was the First Vo∣lume of my Work which when once he had began he went quite through with and gave it more Applause than ever an Author's dear Partiality to their own Offspring could possibly make me believe it deserved  However his Lordship made a just Remark That I was very fond of intro∣ducing  the Sun by way of Simile in all my Poems and said he had a Mind to cut it out whereever he met it  I told his Lordship he would then leave my Book in the Land of Dark∣ness and the Shadow of Death  The Earl then asked me if I intend∣ed to print it I said I would if I could get Subscribers to it otherwise it must like many other valuable things be bu∣ried in Oblivion He gave me a Sub∣scription and as it was Dinnertime took his Leave with a Promise of drink∣ing Coffee with me the next Evening when as it was  Sunday  I should be dis∣engaged from Business which Promise however he did not fulfil and having vainly expected him till Eight I then went up Stairs to sit with the Countess of  Yarmouth  's Steward's Wife and on my Return found my Shop broke open and every Article of my Wearing Ap∣parel taken away This was a dreadful Mortification and a sad Loss All my Comfort was that the Thieves had taken nothing but what belonged to me  This Robbery quite ruin'd me as I was obliged to lay out my Money for Necessaries to appear decent my Land∣lord seiz'd for a Quarter's Rent though he was my Countryman and profess'd great Friendship for me  I was once more in doleful Plight however I got a readyfurnish'd Lodg∣ing just tolerable  One Evening when I came Home from a Friend's my Landlady told me there was a young Woman to visit me who wept sadly that I was abroad I ask'd her what sort of a Person she was She told me she thought she greatly resembled me and that she would be with me early in the Morning Accord∣ingly she came and I knew her at first Sight to be my Daughter The Sur∣prize made me faint away not but I was very glad to see her but Joy is over∣coming as Grief and when I consider'd how little it was in my Power to help her it quite surk my Spirits She was in a Garb which bespoke Poverty and gave me  a long Account of her Father's Inhuma∣nity to her and his youngest Son  A few Days after her Arrival came the Son I have now with me from on board a Privateer as ragged as a Prodigal re∣turn'd from keeping Swine but poor Child I wonder how he subsisted at all considering the Hardships he had suffer'd and what to do with them both I could not tell Mr  Richardson  Author of  Clarissa  was so kind to give my Son a new Suit of Clothes which put him in a Capacity of going amongst my Friends from whom I received a transient Relief  At length the Girl finding how Mat∣ters were went to wait on a Lady and Captain  Meade  took my Son with him on board a Man of War with which a Num∣ber of Transports and others then went on a secret Expedition but were pre∣vented in their Design by having their Intentions betray'd to the  French  Well this was a little Respite to me I heard  Worsdale  was in  London  and wrote to him but receiv'd no Answer a Day  or two after as I was going through  SpringGarden  pretty early in the Morn∣ing who should I see but the very iden∣tical Man standing at a CoffeeHouse Door  I stop'd and look'd at him when he immediately recollected me and seem'd overjoy'd to see me He invited me to Breakfast and told me he was upon his Keeping so that he had been obliged to quit a pretty readyfurnish'd House he had in  MountStreet BerkleySquare  and leave it to the Care of a Servant to retire to this privileg'd Place  After Breakfast he desired I would write a Letter for him to the  Bavarian  Ambassador and to two others whom I have now forgot to beg their Pro∣tection which accordingly he obtain'd though not directly He made me dine with him and promised to reward me when he should be at Liberty to pursue his Work and in the mean time he said I should be welcome to his House in  MountStreet  an Offer which I readily  accepted as well for the fine Air as be∣ing Rentfree  He allow'd me a Shilling a Day to live on which I could very well do But he came every Morning to know how much I had wrote He would give me Fifteen Subjects at once and expected I should compose something excellent on every one of them In short there was no End to my Labour nor any Relaxation from it except sometimes a kind of troubled Sleep for amongst other Mis∣fortunes I was not able to make my Bed nor light the Fire and the old Woman his Housekeeper proud ig∣norant and insolent beyond Imagina∣tion ask'd me Where the Devil I was bred that I could not sweep Rooms light Fires and make Beds as well as other Servants and that truly Mr  Wors∣dale  was a Fool to hire me who did no∣thing but write all Day long  Though I conceiv'd a good deal of In∣dignation at being thought the Servant of a Colourgrinder's Son yet I could not  forbear laughing at the Ideas of this good Creature  Never did any Soul lead a more soli∣tary Life than poor  Laetitia  for  Wors∣dale  had positively order'd the old Wo∣man not to let any human Creature come near me and she punctually obey'd him more out of Malice than Inte∣grity  In this Sequestration from the World I wrote three Ballad Operas one of them plan'd on the Story of the old Song  A Pennyworth of Wit  where I have so exalted the Wife over the Harlot that at last as  Worsdale  is a profest Libertine I began to think it was quite necessary to apologize for his writing any thing to the Honour of Virtue or exposing of Vice so I wrote the following Epilogue to be spoke by a Woman  EPILOGUE to  Virtue Triumphant  DUce on't I wonder what the Author means  To pester thus the Stage with moral Scenes  The Fool He sent me hither to excuse him  Faith I'll be even with him and abuse him  I hope he listens while I speak my Thoughts  And tell what he must bear to hear his Faults  First he endeavours in a freeborn Na∣tion  To bring the wearing Fetters into Fashion  Nor would have loving Couples go toge∣ther  Till they are yok'd by matrimonial tether  Here he does plainly Liberty invade  And is besides an Enemy to Trade  Should his Advice be follow'd thro' the Land  What must became of  Drury  and the  Strand    In  France  when Age appears thro' Walls of Paint  Each batter'd Jade turns Devotè or Saint  And when her Looks no longer Love in∣spire  Does wisely to a Nunnery retire  But here should pretty Females leave off sinning  What must they do betake themselves to Spinning  Why sure 'twou'd vex the Heart of  Jew  or  Turk  To see the pretty playful Creatures work  Well after all his railing thus at Harlots  'Tis said he lik'd them once by lying Var∣lets  And that unless be perfectly had known 'em  He never cou'd so perfectly have shewn 'em  But Jests apart the Poet bad me say  He to the gen'rous Fair commends this Play  To shew their matchless Excellence design'd  And cure the roving Madness of Mankind  To shew the Fair tho' Husbands may be led  By artful Wiles to stain the nuptial Bed  Yet Virtue shall at last triumphant prove  And Husbands bless the Joys of faithful Love  Studious the Worthy and the Good to please  If such with Approbation crown his Lays  Our happy Author seeks no other Praise  I am sorry I have not the Opera but  Worsdale  was too cunning for me and seiz'd it sheet by Sheet as fast as I wrote it And having now Liberty by means of the Protection and a good deal of Work bespoke in the City he took a Floor near the  RoyalExchange  in a large oldfashion'd House with very antique Furniture and there he gave me a little Room to myself but as it was withinside of his Paintingroom I was a Pri∣soner all the Morning and might fast and write till Three o'Clock in the Day then I was called to Dinner of Beefsteaks or Muttonchops cook'd by him∣self The manner of our eating I must describe  We had four Playbills laid for a Tablecloth Knives Forks or Plates had we none no matter for that  I had a Blade  With which my tuneful Pens were made  And so to make my Dinner sure  I for a Fork employ'd a Skewer  The Butter when we had any was de∣posited in the cool and fragrant Recess of an old Shoe a Coffeepot of mine served for as many Uses as ever  Scrub  had for sometimes it boil'd Coffee sometimes Tea it brought small Beer strong Beer and I am more than half afraid it has been applied to less noble Uses but be that as it may I've done the Man some Service and he knows itNo more of that  He happened to paint as he told me the young Chevalier's Picture at  Man∣chester  As he went to  Richmond  he left all his Pictures in my Care when one Morning a very beautiful young Lady of about Sixteen and her Brother a fine young Gentleman came to the House I was called down and they walk'd up Stairs when after a little Hesitation  the Lady ask'd me could she see the Picture of the Highlander I answered yes and brought it to her She kiss'd the Face Feet and every Bit of it and judging from this that she was a Roman Catholick a Religion that  Lord  Lucan  eldest Son to the Earl of  Kil∣malock  Patrick Sars∣field  's Neice can never hate let who will take Offence at it for he was generous noble and humane and in God's Name let every one of his Creatures be as up∣right and just as he and no Doubt but he will look down well pleas'd and bless the fair Variety  The young Lady repeated two Lines of a Poem of Lady  Mary Wortley Mon∣tague  on seeing this Picture  In ev'ry Linament of which we trace  The injur'd Saint and Royal Martyr's Face  Their Curiosity being satisfied the Lady would have given me some Money I told her I was not a Servant but that as I lodged in the House Mr  Worsdale  left the Pictures in my Care Madam  says she I beg Pardon but how can I make you a Recompence for your Trou∣ble By giving me Madam the Re∣mainder of the Poem She repeated it and finding I had something like Taste she kindly embraced me giving me a Direction where to wait on her and we parted I believe delighted with each other but I only speak for myself  Worsdale  came to Town and called on this Lady and Gentleman They were so kind to praise me highly and ask him who I was He declared he did not know he left he said an old Chairwoman to look after his House perhaps it was she  This Answer did not satisfy them they were so unreasonable as to insist on it that I was a Gentlewoman that they knew it by my Speech and Hands by my refusing Money and begging Poetry But  Worsdale  renounced me more heartily than ever he did the Devil whose Ser∣vant he is  He came home very angry abused me at an unmerciful rate and told me I  should not stay in his House to shew my Wit and Breeding forsooth when I had neither and boast of my Family when it would have been better for me to have been the Daughter of a Cobler As this Fellow always boasted of his being Sir  Godfrey Kneller  's Bastard I could not avoid telling him that some People were so fond of Family that to keep it up they would prove themselves Sons of Whores  The Hour of my Deliverance from this worse than  Egyptian  Bondage now approach'd a young Woman for whom I had wrote several LoveLetters to a Gentleman who had it seems kept her till he married and then forsook her as indeed he ought found me out  The Scheme was to persuade him that at the Time he dismissed her she was with Child by him though she in Reality confest she was never in that Circum∣stance in her Life But Bite the Biter was fair enough if he cheated her out of Innocence a Loss never to be retriev'd I think she had a just Title to some of  his Money of which he had more than he knew how to use  I was writing a melancholy Epistle for her when in came  Worsdale  he gave me a furious Look and withered all my Strength before he spoke then he went out of the Chamber and sent for me demanding of me whether I intended to neglect his Business and turn Secretary for the Whores I was really surpri∣sed that he of all Men should fall so hard on kind Females and as their Mo∣ney was honestly earn'd by me and they are generally liberal I never thought I did any thing amiss in helping them out with a soft Epistle He storm'd at me she heard him and finding his Wrath was raised on her Account was very much troubled and slipping a Guinea into my Hand softly whispered me to come to her House in  Goldensquare  and she would make me full amends for my VexationOf all Men I ever saw  We  has the strongest Appearance of Charity and Compassion and the least of it in reality He would take any curious  Artist out of trouble provided their Work which he appropriated to himself would yield him tenfold Interest Love Favour or even common Decency no Person ever met with from him except on terms of becoming his Slave I have often reflected with Wonder on the vast Propensity that appears in Persons of Quality to provide for the spurious Off∣spring of Beggars Vagrants  c  by de∣priving themselves of the Enjoyments of Life to amass vast Treasure and when that tremendous Hour arrives in which all earthly Glories Honours Wealth and Titles cannot give a Moment's Ease or prolong frail Life the Question is  "How shall I dispose of this to appease that God at whose Tribunal I expect shortly to appear Oh I'll leave it all to the Poor"  As if the Omnipo∣tent could not see through the shallow Device or that his eternal Kingdom was to be purchased with their Leavings  I have observed that most of those who have chosen to be publick spirited after their Death have in their Life∣time  been meer unhospitable narrow hearted Souls and if a Person of Birth and polite Education had by any Mis∣fortune fallen into Distress and made an Application to them such would not fail of meeting with an Affront and having their Letter sent back open with the Civil Message that truly my Lord or my Lady did not know any Thing of it and had Dependants enough of their own to provide for  And pray now let us enquire who are these Poor that the publick and private are eternally providing for are there not Collections daily in Churches besides the vast Legacies left to Parishes Hospitals c and yet to Appearance no Soul the better  Are not the Streets infested with Beg∣gars of all Denominations and in the Houses Objects that would raise Com∣passion in any humane welljudging Person  Here we shall find a poor Wretch for a few Shillings a Week slaving to support a Wife and Children and perhaps  at the End of the Quarter is stripped by a cruel Landlord and torn relentlesly from the Relief of his Family while they are exposed to the sharpest Pangs of Want Cold and Nakedness  And where shall they apply for Relief if to the Parish perhaps they may ob∣tain a few Halfpenee but no real Suc∣cour  If to a beneficent Lady who distin∣guishes herself by giving a Gown once in the Year to some particular old Beg∣gar Women and Sixpence a Week for their Support to give them a Taste of Life as the same Woman must not ex∣pect to be serv'd two Years successively Why truly my Lady  Bountifull  is not at home or the Servant durst not carry up any Letter or Petitions So the poor Sufferer may return loaden with Po∣verty and swollen with Sorrow  And yet this Lady expects to be al∣most deified for her Munificence and Patriotism she laid out her Money on a House not to satisfy her Vanity but to employ her distressed Countrymen  she never saw the Naked but she cloath∣ed them nor the Sick but she visited them nor the Hungry or Thirsty but she relieved them whilst the Rich she sent empty away In which charitable Opi∣nion of her own Virtues she expects to go directly to Heaven but now hear the Opinion of Impartiality  Indeed she never saw her Fellow Crea∣tures in Distress but she being of a com∣passionate Temper found it necessary for her own Quiet to relieve them there∣fore she always chose a back Room to sit in that she might not view such dis∣agreeable Objects and in order to save her Money for some great last Stroke if Persons of Rank dine or sup with her they must take such as the House affords by which Means the Rich are always sent empty away  If no body knows this Picture with∣out writing the Name under it I will confess myself to be as bad a Painter as  We  Dean SWIFT's excellent Scheme for building an Hospital for Lunaticks and  Idiots was of a different Cast from those of most other Men as it was not a Mat∣ter utter'd with his last Breath but stu∣died calculated and determined for many Years before as the following Lines in his Elegy on his own Death sufficiently evince  He left the little Wealth he had  To build a House for Fools and Mad  And shew'd by one Satyrick Touch  No Nation wanted it so much  And according to his usual Wisdom he committed the Regulation of it to Gen∣tlemen of real Worth Honour and Pro∣bity in which would others follow so great so laudable an Example perhaps the many Sums that were designed for good  Mem The WorkHouse in  Dublin  Uses but are now appropriated to the purchasing Estates and splendid Equipages for some particular People might have the wish'd Effect of being a universal Benefit  The  Dean  could not abide the thought of being like other Mortals forgot as soon as his venerable Dust was convey'd to the Earth and therefore he always endeavour'd to render himself worthy of a grateful Remembrance in the Hearts of the People yet how true are his own Lines  And now the Dean no more is miss'd  Than if he never did exist  Except amongst oldfashioned Folks  Who now and then repeat his Jokes  A remarkable Instance of his whimsical Disposition which I omitted in my first Volume as I find  His sacred Name remains still dear  To every just Hibernian Ear  I will here insert and must say 'tis with infinite Pleasure I find that my weak Attempts to delineate his inimitable Cha∣racter have met with such unhoped Ap∣probation both here and in  England    not so much for the Vanity of an Author as the Pleasure I feel at seeing so vast a Respect paid to his Memory  I believe the  Dean  on his first coming to  Ireland  was very melancholy and indeed it was not to be wonder'd at as he was then separated from those whom he lov'd Mr  Pope  Lord  Bolingbroke  c and in one of his Poems he seems to despair of meeting with Friendship in a strange Country or that  Not a Judas could be found  To sell him for three Hundred Pound  I one Day ask'd him how he came to write that Poem he told me he had three Times like to have been hang'd  "and Pox take me said he but I be∣lieve the People thought I could bring the Pretender in my Hand and place him on the Throne"  I remember a worthy Gentleman who had the Honour of his Acquaintance told me that the Dean and some other Per∣sons of Taste whom I do not now re∣collect  came to a Resolution to have a Feast once a Year in imitation of the  Saturnalia  which in heathen  Rome  was held about the Time we keep our  Christ∣mas  whereat the Servants personated their Masters and the Masters waited as Servants  The first Time they put this Scheme in Practice was at the Deanery House When all the Servants were seated and every Gentleman placed behind his own Man the Dean's Servant took an Op∣portunity of finding Fault with some Meat that was not done to his Taste and tak∣ing it up in his Hand he threw it in his Master's Face and mimick'd him in every other Foible which he had ever discover'd in him  At this the Dean flew in a violent Rage beat the Fellow and put every Thing into such Disorder that the Servants affright∣ed fled the Room and here ended the Feast of  Saturnalia  Stella  Mrs  Johnson  said to be his own Sister  whom he has so beautifully praised through his Writings was actu∣ally  his Wife though they never I am convinced tasted even the chaste Joys which Hymen allows  It is certain they retain'd for each other a most tender Love and though they did not indulge the Desires of the Body yet their Souls were united by the strictest Bonds of divine and social Har∣mony  He in the latter Part of his Life of∣fered to acknowledge her as the Partner of his Heart but she wisely declin'd it knowing that while she continued only as a Visitor he would treat her with Res∣pect which would cease as his Temper was unpassive if she lived intirely with him and every Fault of his Servants would be attributed to her I am certain he must have tenderly loved that Lady as I have been a Witness that the bare mention of her Name has drawn Tears from him which it was not easy to ef∣fect  I remember he sent for me one Morn∣ing very early to Breakfast and as I always drank Tea or Coffee I expected  to have found one of these ready but after he had detained me two Hours dis∣coursing on his Houshold Oeconomy and other Matters amongst which one was that a Piece of his Garden Wall had fallen down and  "so said he"  "one of my Fellows forsooth must needs get a Trowel and Mortar and undertake to mend the Breach  "I happened continued the Dean to spy him out of my Window at this Employment and call'd to him to know why he did that he told me he had been bred a Bricklayer and that his doing it would save me Mo∣ney so I let him finish it which he did very compleatly in about an Hour's time I gave him a Moidore and Pox take me but the Fellow instead of going as he ought to the Alehouse or a Whore went and bought Silver Buckles and is grown very proud upon it"  I think Sir said I the Man made a good Hour's Work of it  "Come said he shall we go to Break∣fast I know you were once  Bermudas  mad now I'll give you some of that Country Cheer  open  that Drawer and reach me a flat Bottle you'll find there"  I ran to obey him and as the Drawer was low kneeled down to it  I no sooner attempted to unlock the Drawer but he flew at me and beat me most immoderately I again made an Effort and still he beat me crying  "Pox take you  open  the Drawer"  I once more tried and he struck me so hard that I burst into Tears and said Lord Sir what must I do  Pox take you for a Slut said he  "would you spoil my Lock and break my Key"  Why Sir the Drawer is lock'd  "Oh I beg Pardon said he I thought you were going to pull it out by the Key well open it and do what I bid you"  I did so and found the Bottle  "Now said he"  "you must know I always breakfast between my own House and the Church and I carry my Provision  in my Pocket"  upon this he pulled out a Piece of Gingerbread and offered me some  As I was terribly afflicted with the Heartburn the very thoughts of any thing so dry made me ten times worse which I told him and begged he would excuse me He positively insisted on my eating a Piece of it which I was on Penalty of another Beating obliged to comply with  "Now said he you must take a Sup out of my Bottle"  I just held it to my Mouth and found it so strong that I intreated he would not ask me to taste it He endeavoured to persuade me but finding that would not avail he threw me down forced the Bottle into my Mouth and pour'd some of the Liquor down my Throat which I thought would have set my very Stomach on Fire He then gravely went to Prayers and I re∣turned home not greatly delighted but however glad to come off no worse I went the ensuing Evening to pay a Vi∣sit to my Kinsman Doctor  Sge  then lately consecrated Lord Bp of **** This Gentleman and his Family were extremely fond of my Fa∣ther and always pleased when I did my∣self the Honour to call on them and received me with that Ease and Polite∣ness peculiar to well bred People I con∣gratulated the Bishop on his Preferment He modestly told me that his Honours did not sit easy on him and that he would willingly dispence with his Friends not saluting him by his Title of Lord as it always made him uneasy He then asked me as he saw my Father's Cha∣riot at the Door where I intended to go I told him to the Dean Well said he I beg you'll give my Compliments to him and tell him That as 'tis to his Recommendation I owe my present Hap∣piness I am surprised I never had the Pleasure of seeing him since he con∣ferred so great a Favouron me While I was plain Doctor  Sge  continued he the Dean used to send his Wine and Bread before him and frequently take a Dinner with me but now I believe he is  asham'd to own me Pray speak to him and let me know his Answer I pro∣mised I would and then departed  I found the Dean at home and alone which gave me an immediate Opportu∣nity of delivering the Bp's Mes∣sage He listen'd to me very attentively and then said  "Oh I remember some∣thing of it Ld  Ct  ap∣plied to me for a Person to make a Bishop of whom I knew was not an honest Man and as I wanted the Living of  Wb  's for  Dy  I recommended  Sge  to the Bishoprick with an Assurance that he would answer his Excellency's Pur∣pose and Pox take me if I ever thought him worth my Contempt till I had made a Bishop of him"  The Dean then told me that as he had no Company and did not know how to dispose of his time I should have the Honour to sup with him and said he I will give you a most kingly En∣tertainment  I accordingly waited in Expectation of some extraordinary Repast till about Nine o'Clock in which Interval my Readers may be assured I wanted not Amusements for the Mind However at length the Cloth was laid on a small Table and to my great Surprize the Servant brought up four blue Eggs on a China Plate  "Here Hussey said he is a Plover's Egg King  William  used to give Crowns apiece for them and thought it Prophanation in a Subject to eat one of them as he was amongst his other immortal Perfections an Epicure a Glutton and aHold said he I had like to have spoken Treason But how do you like the Eggs"  Sir I have eat none yet  "Well eat like a Monarch then and tell me your Opinion"  I did eat and told him I had not that elevated Notion of his Banquet which he might possibly have from so great a Precedent  "Well said he these Eggs cost me Sixpence apiece which is a little extravagant considering a Herring will cost but a  Halfpenny but I never exceed two and this is the only Article in which I am luxurious"  I must here again apologize to my Reader for my frequent Digressions in which however 'tis possible they will find more Entertainment than a simple Narrative will afford  I believe there never was any Set of People so happy in sincere and uninter∣rupted Friendship as the Dean Doctor  Delany  Mr  Pilkington  and myself nor can I reflect at this Hour on any thing with more Pleasure than those happy Moments we have enjoyed 'Tis for this Reason I am fond of mentioning Matters which bring the pleasing Ideas to my Mind I have observed that the Scent of a Flower or the Tune of a Song al∣ways conveys to Remembrance the exact Image of the Place in which they were first noticed Well therefore in the Relation of a Story where one Circum∣stance insensibly brings on another may a Writer who scorns to deal in Romance be led like me to digress  Mrs  Barber  whose Name at her earnest Request I omitted in my first Volume and who was the Lady I mentioned to have been with me at my first Interview with the Dean at Dr  Delany  's Seat was at this time writing a Volume of Poems some of which I fansy might at this Day be seen in the Cheesemongers Chandlers Pastrycooks and Secondhand Booksellers Shops However dull as they were they certainly would have been much worse but that Doctor  Delany  fre∣quently held what he called a  Senatus Consultum  to correct these undigested Materials at which were present some∣times the Dean in the Chair but al∣ways Mrs  Grierson  Mr  Pilkington  the Doctor and myself One Day that he had appointed for this Purpose we re∣ceived from him the following Lines which as they contain a Compliment to me from so eminent a Hand I must insert Take notice that as we were both diminutive in Size Mr  Pilkington  was stiled  Thomas Thumb  and I his Lady fair  Mighty  Thomas  a solemn  Senatus  I call  To consult for  Saphira  so come one and all  Quit Books and quit Business your Cure and your Care  For a long winding Walk and a short Bill of Fare  I've Mutton for you Sir and as for the Ladies  As Friend  Virgil  has it I've  Aliud Mer∣cedes    For  Letty  one Filbert whereon to re∣gale  And a Peach for  Mrs  Grierson  pale  Constance  to make a full Meal  And for your cruel Part  My Mother who used to argue with the Doctor about his Declamations against eating Blood  who take Pleasure in Blood  I have that of the Grape which is ten times as good  Flow Wit to her Honour flow Wine to her Health  High rais'd be her Worth above Titles or Wealth  We obeyed the Summons and had a very elegant Entertainment and after∣wards proceeded to our Business which we completed to the Satisfaction of all Parties  Of all the Gentlemen I ever knew this I must say that Doctor  Delany  ex∣cels in one Point particularly which is in giving an elegant Entertainment with Ease Chearfulness and an Hospitality which makes the Company happy  Lord  Carteret  in his Lieutenancy be∣ing very fond of this Gentleman who is indeed worthy of universal Esteem came one Day quite unattended and told the Doctor he was come to dine with him He thank'd his Excellency for the Honour he confer'd on him and invited him to walk into his beautiful Gardens which his Excellency did with great good Hu∣mour They took a Turn or two when the Servant came to inform them that Dinner was on the Table The Doctor had generally something nice in the Sea∣son for himself and his Mother to whom he behaved with true filial Tenderness  and Respect for which no Doubt his Days will be long in the Land which the Lord hath given him  The Doctor made the old Lady do the Honours of his Table for which nor for the Entertainment he never made the least Apology but told his Lordship that  To Stomachs cloy'd with costly Fare  Simplicity alone was rare  This Demeanor of his was infinitely agreeable to Lord  Ct  who tho' a Courtier hated Ceremony when he sought Pleasure which is indeed incon∣sistent with it And what Respect so∣ever our Nobility may think is owing to the  French  Mode of cringing and com∣plimenting I must confess I never see it practised without a peculiar Pain which I can compare to nothing but the Appre∣hensions I am under at the Sight of Tumblers Ropedancers  c  such as I believe all rational Creatures share at seeing Men deform their Visages by a  thousand aukward Grimaces and their Bodies like jointed Babies only because it is Alamode Francoise Neither do we often see any but the most illiterate Cox∣combs practise it  His Excellency after the Cloth was taken away and the Bottle introduced when consequently the Lady departed told the Doctor  "that he always be∣lieved him a most wellbred Gentle∣man but never had so clear a Demon∣stration of it as he had this Day seen Others said he whom I have tried the same Experiment on have met me in as much Confusion as if I came to arrest them for HighTreason nay they would not give me a Moment of their Conversation which and not their Dinner I sought but hurry from me and then if I had any Appetite deprive me of it by their fulsome Apo∣logies for Defects This said his Ex∣cellency is like a Story I heard the Dean tell of a Lady who had given him an Invitation to Dinner As she heard he was not easily pleased she had ta∣ken  a Month to provide for it When the Time came every Delicacy which could be purchased the Lady had prepared even to Profusion which you know  Swift  hated However the Dean was scarce seated when she began to make a ceremonious Ha∣rangue in which she told him that she was sincerely sorry she had not a more tolerable Dinner since she was apprehensive there was not any thing there fit for him to eat in short that it was a bad Dinner  Pox take you for a B  said the Dean  why did you not get a better Sure you had Time enough but since you say it is so bad I'll e'en go Home and eat a Herring  Accordingly he departed and left her justly confused at her Folly which had spoilt all the Pains and Expence she had been at"  And here if it will not be thought im∣pertinent in me to intrude into such Company I also have a Story which I somewhere heard not unapplicable to the above  A certain  English  Nobleman who had the Honour to be sent Embassador to  France  was said to be one of the most polite accomplished fine Gentlemen in  Europe  This reached the Ears of the  French  King who thought such a Cha∣racter due to none but himself but as every thing is proved by Trial his Ma∣jesty took this Method of informing his Curiosity One Morning that the Ambas∣sador had a private Audience the King told him he should be glad of his Excel∣lency's Company to take an airing with him the Ambassador did not hesitate on accepting the Offer but told his Majesty he was ready to wait on him the King's Chariot was at the Door which he very carelessly desired the Nobleman to step into  No Sir  replied the Ambassador  not before your Majesty  at which the King burst out a Laughing and said  "No no my Lord you are not the best bred Man in the World otherwise you would have done what I desired since you might well know that if it was not agreeable to me I should ne∣ver  have paid you the Compli∣ment"  And indeed I have heard those who ought to be the best Judges of Manners declare that in Company with Superiors to act implicitly according to their Direc∣tions is the most effectual Method of being always acceptable which leads me to another little Circumstance related by Mrs  Percival  This Lady with a Company of very agreeable Persons resolved in the Sum∣mertime to take a Trip to the  Hague  they accordingly set out and landed at some Place in  Holland  the Name of which I have now forgot However on their first Day's Journey they stopp'd at an Inn to dine and enquired what they could have to eat they were told there was nothing in the House but a Neck of Veal which tho' insufficient they de∣sired to be dressed as there was not an Inn for some Miles forward therefore they made it up with some of their Sea Provisions which the Servants had for∣tunately brought in After Dinner they  called a Bill and amongst other Articles of Extortion they were charged for Meat One Pound Four Shillings which was so palpable an Imposition that tho' each of the Company had Fortune and Liberality enough yet they called for the Man and told him they absolutely would not pay so extravagant a Price sooner than which as they came meerly for Pleasure they would stay a Month and spend a hundred Pounds a Piece in Law the Boorish Fellow told them that it was the common Price in this Place which if they doubted he was willing to ap∣peal to the Magistrate This they rea∣dily agreed to and were all preparing for a serious Trial of the Matter when Minheer told them in an ironical Tone that he was himself the RulingOfficer and Dispenser of Law and Justice in that Place Finding this to be the Fact and that the Defendant must be the Judge in this Cause the Plaintiffs thought proper to submit and pay'd him  If the Reader thinks this little Narra∣tive is not quite in Point which now it is related I begin to find out myself  he may blot it out of his Book if he pleases but he shall not blot it out of my Manuscript for that would be to de∣prive me of a Page that is worth a Crown to me Nay and as it is  Truth  who knows but it may prove worth two Crowns to the Reader if he should hap∣pen to make the same Tour  My dear Mr  Cibber  to whom for his Amusement I used to relate such little Incidents would frequently admire what a Fund of Matter for Entertainment my Brain contained and he bad me write it all since if it pleased him it might possibly have the same Effect on others This Gentleman's frequent Con∣versation with the Great gave him a bet∣ter Opportunity of knowing their Dispo∣sition as he had infinite Penetration than most others In Consequence of which he advised me when I ever had Occasion to sollicit a Favour from any Persons of Distinction to take Care to Time it properly for Instance said he "Never write to him or her of a dark foggy frosty Morning particularly be∣fore Breakfast at which Time it is Ten  to One they are out of Temper nor though you send at any Time and even received an unmannerly Answer do not let a rash Pride drive you to return the Affront since it is impossible for you to know what at that Instant had chagrin'd their Temper He who will not be your Friend at one Time may at another and tho' you never can bring him to do you any Service yet do not provoke him to be your Enemy a Man may have had ill Success at Play missed an Appointment with a fine Woman or twenty such Accidents which may for the present sour his Disposition whereas if you continue your Assiduities in Pro∣cess of Time he might do you more Service than you could hope These are Truths which I have since experienced and I should be wanting in Gratitude as well as Sincerity if I did not make it publick Here follows an Instance  Nicholas Loftus Hume  Esq  whom I mentioned in my second Volume that came to see me in  London  but declined subscribing to me because he was going to the Duke of  Dorsel  's to Dinner has  since my being in this Kingdom been kind enough to send me Five Guineas as a Subscription for which I rest his most obliged Servant  I remark'd to Mr  Cibber  upon this Conversation that though the  English  Nobility were outdone by none in Mu∣nificence and Liberality yet I could by no Means conceive that their Buildings were the least expressive of it since there was scarcely one fine House in  London  which was not obscured by a monstrous high Wall that intirely intercepted the Prospect and took much from the Mag∣nificence the Streets might possibly have He told me it was the Method in  Italy  from whence our Peers and others trans∣planted it as a great Beauty because the Surprise has a vast Effect Sir said I in  Italy  those Walls are requisite to keep off the extreme Heat of the Sun and if possible to shut out the Eye of God from their abominable Pollutions but as we enjoy a mild and temperate Region and are I hope untainted with their beastly Vices I see no Reason for our Peers to affect it there is besides generally at  these Gates a most avaricious Cerberus who should a Stranger happen to stand and gaze at any occasion of the Gates being opened would very judiciously slap it in their Faces as if our Eyes like the Sphynx of  Egypt  could penetrate Stone Walls If you have the smallest Suit to make to his Master the Fellow will be as dull of Apprehension as the Mock Doctor till you tip him the Symp∣toms which when you have given him he prevails on the Valet to deliver it which must also be accompanied by a Daub in the Fist I have computed the Expence of Writing to a Great Man as under     £  S  D  For Pen Ink and Paper      ½  For a Person to find when his Lordship is at Home        To the Porter        To the Valet        To the Footman who brings the Answer        The amount of which is      ½  These Observations I thought proper to communicate as I am persuaded some of the Nobility of  England  will be cu∣rious enough to read this Work and I do assure them nothing so much dims their Lustre as the Arrogance and Pe∣nury of their Vassals which when they know perhaps they may reclaim Dean  Swift  discharged a Servant only for rejecting the Petition of a poor old Wo∣man she was very ancient and on a cold Morning sat at the Deanery Steps a con∣siderable Time during which the Dean saw her through a Window and no doubt commiserated her desolate Condi∣tion His Footman happened to come to the Door and the poor Creature be∣sought him in a piteous Tone to give that Paper to his Reverence The Ser∣vant read it and told her with infinite Scorn his Master had something else to mind than her Petition  "What's that you say Fellow said the Dean look∣ing out at the Window come up here'  The Man trembling obey'd him he also desired the poor Woman to come before him made her sit down and ordered her some Bread and Wine after which he turned to the Man and said  "At what time Sir did I order you to open a Paper directed to me or to refuse a Letter from any one Hark ye Sirrah you have been admonish'd by me for Drunkenness idling and other Faults but since I have discovered your inhuman Disposition I must dis∣miss you from my Service So pull off my Cloaths take your Wages and let me hear no more of you"  The Fellow did so and having vainly sollicited a Discharge was compelled to go to Sea where he continued five Years at the end of which time finding that Life far different from the Ease and Luxury of his former Occupation he re∣turned and humbly confessing in a Pe∣tition to the Dean his former manifold Crimes he assured him of his sincere Reformation which the Dangers he had  undergone at Sea had happily wrought and begg'd the Dean would give him some Sort of Discharge since the Ho∣nour of having liv'd with him would certainly procure him a Place Accord∣ingly the Dean call'd for Pen Ink and Paper and gave him a Dismission with which and no other Fortune he set out for London  Among others he applied to me who had known him at his late Master's and produc'd his Certificate which for its Singularity I transcribed and believe it may not be displeasing to the Reader  Whereas the Bearerserv'd me the Space of one Year during which time he was an Idler and a Drun∣kard I then discharged him as such but how far his having been five Years at Sea may have mended his Manners I leave to the Penetration of those who may hereafter chuse to employ him  J SWIFT  DeaneryHouse  Jan th  I advised him to go to Mr  Pope  who on seeing the Dean's Handwriting which he well knew told the Man if he could produce any credible Person who would attest that he was the Servant that the Dean meant he would hire him On this Occasion he applied to me and I gave him a Letter to Mr  Pope  assuring him that I knew the Man to have been Footman to the Dean Upon this Mr  Pope  took him into his Service in which he continued till the Death of his Master  'Tis now I think full time for me to take up my Clue and go on with my Memoirs previous to which it is how∣ever I think it incumbent on me to in∣treat my Readers Forgiveness for my so frequently mentioning in the Prosecution of my Story a Person so contemptible so unworthy even of Satire as one  Worf∣dale  a Painter yet those who examine these Writings will find that he is so unluckily interweven in my History that it is as impossible for me to eradicate him as it was for Jack in the Tale of  a Tub to strip his Coat of its Foppe∣ries without visibly defacing the whole  Worsdale  went abroad and I took an Opportunity to make my Escape to visit Mr  Cibber  and met according to Cu∣stom a very kind Reception For his Friendship to me was inviolable He was writing the  Character and Conduct of  CICERO consider'd and did me the Honour to read it to me I was infinitely pleased to find by the many lively Sal∣lies of Wit in it that the good Gentle∣man's Spirits were undepress'd with YearsLong may they continue so This gave me an Opportunity of writing a Poem to him which  We  had the Confidence to ask from me but I did not chuse to compliment him with it The Editor has applied to Mr  Cibber  for a Copy of this Poem but he having disposed of them all we are obliged to omit it  Mr  Cibber  was exceeding well pleas'd when I waited on him with it and said he would give it a Place but that it wanted Correction which he promised to bestow on it This I readily agreed to  being convinced his Judgment far sur∣passed mine  I waited on him next Morning and found he had greatly improved my Work I thank'd him for his obliging Pains but remarked his Modesty in having struck out some Lines in which he was most praised  Well Madam said he there are two Guineas for your Flattery and one more for the Liberty I took I blessed my Benefactor sincerely from my Soul he smiled benevolent  "Come said he I have more good News for you Mr  Stanhope  alter'd a Line for which he desires you will accept of a Guinea Mr  Hervey  also pays you the same Compliment for changing one Mo∣nosyllable for another"  To say the Truth I only wished every Gentleman at  White  's had on the same Terms taken the same Liberty till my Work like Admiral  Drake  's Ship had been so often mended that not a Bit of the original Stuff it was compos'd of should remain for  Here in nice Balance Truth with Gold she weighs  And solid Pudding against empty Praise  I could do no more than after some joyful Tears to assure Mr  Cibber  that neither his own Favours to me nor those he had sollicited for me should ever be forgot while this poor Machine of mine had any Existence  Surely I hope we shall

rejoiced at my Deliverance and took a little decent Lodging but my Joys were perishable as the baseless Fabrick of a Vision Captain  Meade  with whom I mentioned my Son's going on the secret  Expedition came to tell me that the Boy and he landed the Day before that my Son was seized with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever and wanted to see me I went to the Captain's Lodgings in  ScotlandYard  and found my poor Wan∣derer quite lightheaded The Captain sent a Physician and a Surgeon to him with Orders to the Mistress of the House to provide for him whatever was neces∣sary and he would answer the Expence For many Days we despair'd of his Life till at length God's Mercy restor'd him to my Prayers and Tears When he came perfectly to himself he told me they had been in a violent Tempest where the Waves rolling Mountains high he was wet to his Skin and the Ship in imminent Danger of being lost Captain  Meade  he said begged of God that he might just see his Wife and Children and then he should die without the smallest Re∣luctance his Prayer was heard the Storm abated and all got safe on Shore  As he was impatient to see his Family he had left Directions for my Son to fol∣low  him to  Teddington  if it pleased God he recover'd As I knew nothing could be a greater Restorative after a Fit of Sickness than a pure Air I recommend∣ed that sovereign Elixir to him He went the Moment he was able and sent me the next Day the following Letter  Dear Mamma  I Have return'd to what I had just left  Sickness  The Captain is in a malig∣nant Fever beyond any thing I ever saw he knows nobody nor has he any Phy∣sician I don't believe he can outlive to∣morrow Night I am really greatly griev'd as I am sure he lov'd me and on account of his poor Wife who is al∣most distracted The four little Girls I fear will be quite unprovided for All things here are in Confusion Adieu my dear Mother Heaven preserve you to  Your affectionate and dutiful Son  John Carterert Pilkington  Teddington  Friday  Morning  My Son's Prognostick happened to prove true the Captain expir'd about four the next Morning of which the Boy was first inform'd by the dismal Out∣cry of the Widow and Children This Woman's Character has something in it so far surpassing any thing I have yet met with that I hope it may at once divert and instruct my Readers the Story is genuine  She was the Daughter of Mr  Whfld  of  Canterbury  an ancient and honourable Family many of whom had Seats in Parliament but it seems he had stray'd from the Wisdom and Virtue of his Ancestors and devoted himself intirely to  Belial  Women and Wine were all his Joy till he broke his Lady's Heart And Oh strange to hear shocking to human Nature had the the Cruelty to attempt his Virgin Daugh∣ters one of whom to protect herself from such devillish Solicitations ran away with his Coachman  She thought it neither Shame nor Sin  For  John  was come of honest Kin  Swift  The Heroine of our Story being left alone was so tormented by his incestu∣ous infernal Fire that she fled to her younger Brother who was an Apothe∣cary and lived at  Wdr  As he was a Batchelor he was very glad of her to oversee his domestick Af∣fairs which I dare say she did very well as she was a good Housewife especially in the frugal Part of Management It happened another Apothecary fell in love with her but nothing could prevail on her to accept of him as a Husband tho' her Brother tried every Art he could to persuade her to it  Things were in this Situation when Captain  Mead  was commanded on Duty to  Wdr  and as he had often been there was well acquainted with the Town and as well esteem'd Miss  Whfd  and her Brother with some young Ladies were walking on the Terrass  when Captain  Meade  accosted them They fell into Chat and Mr  Whfld  invited the Captain to Supper after which the young Lady retir'd  Mr  Whfld  then acquainted the Captain with his Sister's obstinate Refusal of an advantageous Match  "She has  said he  "seem'd to pay a particular Deference to every Word you spoke tonight and I am certain if you undertake the Lover's Cause you will bring my Sister to Reason"  The Captain said it would be too abrupt to pretend to advise a Lady he had never seen before in so delicate a Point as that of Matrimony wherein many Circumstances ought to be con∣sidered in order to a Union firm and lasting It may be said he the young Lady's Heart is preengaged in that Case how cruel would it be to force her into a hateful Wedlock the Consequence of which is Misery  Mr  Whfld  then assured him he had no such Intention all he aimed at was her Happiness  "Cultivate added he  a Friendship with her you may easily do it and discover the true Cause of her Aversion toward an honest good Man who loves her and is in Cir∣cumstances to maintain her in Ease and Plenty"  Captain  Mead  promised all in his Power and when by frequenting the House he had got into a little Intimacy with her he in a paternal Stile when they were alone expostulated with her to no pur∣pose She said she was determined never to marry as she was certain she should never have the Man she only could love  He pressed very hard to know who it was assuring her of his Friendship and at the same time laying hold of her Hand said he must be insensible indeed who did not above all other Considera∣tion regard so much Tenderness and Beauty  He perceiv'd she trembled blush'd and seem'd quite confounded  "Would to God Madam said he that I was the happy Occasion of all those tender Emotions which swell your fair Bo∣som  how blest should I think my∣self"  And are you said she in a fault'ring Voice are you in earnest or do you only trifle with a Weakness which your Penetration must have observed even from the first Moment I beheld you  Altho' this Declaration was very plain yet it was so unexpected that the Cap∣tain was for some Moments at a Loss how to make a suitable Return But recovering himself he told her Joy had made him speechless but from that Hour he was intirely devoted to her for Life  He then ask'd her in Marriage of her Brother who absolutely refused her to him on account of his being in the Army  But as the Lady was willing to be the kind Companion of his Flight he hired a Chariot and Six and took her with him  This Story Captain  Meade  told me before her Nor did she in the least at∣tempt to deny it but said she had  gain'd a good Husband by her Since∣rity  Indeed while I was with them they seemed to me perfect Patterns of conju∣gal Love but her Fondness seem'd to surpass all things for she would kiss her Husband's Linen saying they smelt of Violets and Roses but truly though I lov'd my dear Relation very well I was grown so delicate I did not like a  dirty  Shirt for that was sometimes the Case to be offered to me as a Nosegay  Her Piety was so great that  Whitsunday  Morning when we were going to Church which was near half a Mile from Captain  Meade  's House a young Lady called to us to know did the Bell ring Mrs  Meade  answered yes but finding even the Churchyard Door not open'd she said she would not receive the Sacrament that Morning I asked her why she should not Because said she I have told a Lye in saying the Bell rang I told her Scruple to Doctor  Hales  who join'd us and presently dispelled her  Fears by assuring her an innocent Mis∣take could never be deemed a Lye  Upon this we both ventured to receive the blessed Eucharist administered to us by a truly holy Hand for assuredly Doctor  Hales  yours is such And let no Person say I do not reverence the Clergy for I really do but not any one of them who does not as near as Hu∣manity can go aim at the Perfection of their Maker and Redeemer  As I have already related the Manner of Captain  Meade  's Death let us see how his pious Widow behav'd herself on the Occasion after having yell'd and scream'd to save Appearances she lock'd up his Body and had him next Day buried  She desired my Son who remained disconsolate in the House to go to the Tower and bring home whatever of the Captain's was there but he being ap∣prehensive that perhaps on Account of his Youth and his not having a Line with him they might be refused to him begg'd of me to accompany him which as I was truly desirous of rendering any  Service I could to his Family I readily did When we arrived at his Apart∣ment there for the Officers keep one in every Place where they are obliged to be on Guard and told the Mistress of the House my melancholly Errand she gave me the Keys of his Bureau Port∣manteau Trunk  c  When I took out his Regimentals his Sash and many other things appertain∣ing to him in which I had so often seen him array'd I could not refrain bursting into Tears to think the dear Wearer of them was now no more Amongst other things we found two Guineas which was a seasonable Relief to the Widow The Soldiers on Duty wept like Children at his Death's sad Story My Son convey'd all things safe but the Sight of them did not take the same Effect on his Re∣lict that they had done on me for she only said she was very glad to get them  My Boy who colours Prints beauti∣fully was employed by Mr  Millan  so that he was innocently and elegantly em∣ployed  The Sweets of getting Money made him doubly diligent and to be quite undisturbed which it was impossi∣ble he should be with me so many Per∣sons coming for Letters Petitions  c  he took a Lodging for himself I was one Day exceedingly surprised when the Pennypost brought a Letter directed to my Son as it was marked  Teddington  I open'd it judging it was some Business that Mrs  Meade  wanted to have trans∣acted when O shameful it was a Loveletter to the Child who was but sixteen Years of Age and she is four Years older than I am with a Direction to him to meet her at a Coffeehouse in  London  and an Offer of Marriage to him  I really could scarce believe the true and credible Avouchment of my own Eyes Bless me she amaz'd me yet thinking this might be a Counterfeit I shew'd it to the Boy and desired he would go and see into this Matter nei∣ther of us being acquainted with her Hand which was a desperate bad one  He went accordingly and stay'd most Part of the Evening abroad When he return'd he said he had inquired after her everywhere and could not learn any Tidings of her so I conceived this Let∣ter was either wrote by some Enemy of hers or else for Sport by some of the Girls at  Teddington  in order to send him on a Wildgoose Chase  About six Weeks after the Captain's Death an Officer inquired for me as I did not know him I asked what Com∣mands he had for me He desired to know of me whether I was not a near Relation to Captain  Meade  To which answering in the Affirmative I desired the Gentleman to sit for he looked as if he had something of Importance to de∣liver Pray Madam said he can you inform me what is become of the Cap∣tain's Widow my Reason for inquiring is this a prior Wife has set up a Claim to the Pension and produced a Certifi∣cate which we believe to be a Counter∣fit as it is dated twenty Years ago and 'tis but reasonable to think she would  in that time have asserted her just Rights But this is not all the Officers have made a Collection for the Lady he acknow∣ledg'd and the Children But there is a Report spread that she is married to a Boy young enough to be her Son who was a Helper in the Captain's Stable This has damped the Charity of those who had she even been deceived by the Captain would have assisted her  I told him I had often heard the Cap∣tain relate that in his younger Days he got in a League with one Mrs  Meadows  who after having been divorced from her Husband set up a Coffeehouse where he boarded and lodg'd He found her in every Respect so unfaithful to him that he quitted her Not long after she broke and being in Distress applied to Captain  Meads  who in Consideration of former Friendship agreed to give her annually  l  provided she retired which she agreed to  I can't Sir said I help thinking this is some Piece of her Contrivance 'Tis very possible Madam return'd he and  if you will be so kind to inquire into it that these Reports may be confuted it will be of the utmost Consequence to∣wards the future Welfare of the Widow and Orphans of your deceased Relation I shall pay my Respects to you again in two or three Days The Gentleman left me and after a good deal of Search amongst Mrs  Meade  's Acquaintance I learned she lodged in the  Strand  There I went and found her in a very indif∣ferent Lodging the Children were in deep Mourning but Madam herself was deck'd out very gay After customary Compliments I told her I was surprised to see her out of Mourning Why  Caw∣zan  for that was her manner of Pro∣nunciation I am married What al∣ready return'd I e'er the Man you seem'd to doat on even to Extravagance is cold in his Grave Cold says she aye he's cold enough and rotten too by this time May be you made him so before Death Why should you think so Be∣cause you seem to have thrown of com∣mon Decency And is this all the Re∣spect  you pay to so good a Husband In answer to this and to my great Surprize she assured me she never was married to the Captain in her Life  Here was Hypocrisy that sly Fiend who 'scapes all but the piercing Eye of GOD in its utmost Perfection if one may make use of such an Epithet to such a devilish Sin To live in Fornication yet go to the Communion without the least Purpose of Amendment of Life and to pretend such strong Affection to a Man whose very Memory she shewed she hated I shall ever after this suspect the Sincerity of such an overacted Fond∣ness  I told her my Errand and that I was really sorry she had put it out of my Power to vindicate her Conduct which cut of Regard to the poor Children I would gladly have done She told me Doctor  Hales  approved of her Proceed∣ing and so she did not care what I thought Though I am certain this must have been false for the Doctor had such high Notions of conjugal Fidelity that  he was true to the  Ashes  of his Spouse whom he lost when he was but a very young Man and having an agreeable Person a sweet Temper and unbounded Learning might no Doubt have raised his Fortune by a second Marriage  Amongst other Instances of her Hypo∣crisy this Woman used to pretend that even small Beer got into her Head and would severely censure any Lady who drank a Glass of Wine yet now though it was but nine o' Clock in the Morning she called for a Dram drank it off and would have had me follow her Example but I had no Inclination to such a Break∣fast Besides having no other Estate but my Head on which were hourly De∣mands it was by no other means my Interest to destroy it  I took my Leave and when I re∣lated this to my Son the Boy laughed excessively and as he then had no man∣ner of Respect for her he told me he had gone to her according to her Ap∣pointment that she had treated him with two Bottles of Mountain and press'd  him hard to marry her Indeed I re∣member when he came home I saw he had been drinking but he said some young Gentlemen of  Ireland  whom he met gave him a Bottle of Wine  However some time after she made him pay for his Liquor for she opened a Punchhouse which I believe she still keeps at least she did when I left  Lon∣don  she wrote a Letter to my Son to desire to see him accordingly he went and Madam Temperance carried him in∣to the Diningroom and ordered her Husband who served in Quality of Waiter to bring up a Bowl of ArrackPunch and half a Dozen Glasses of Jelly The Boy was well pleased with this sumptuous Fare but when the good Chear was ended she demanded Pay∣ment and he was obliged to part with his Week's Earning which he had just received What could the most mer∣cenary Prostitute have done worse  But I believe she is sufficiently pu∣nish'd for I was well assured the Groom  took the Liberty of correcting her and nobody pitied her  I think the Philosopher was in the wrong who wished for Windows in the human Breast how miserable must we have been when we beheld those whom we esteem'd Friends under specious Ap∣pearance plotting our Destruction the Object of our Love even in the midst of wellfeign'd Rapture wishing them∣selves in the Arms of another The Son who bows his Knee in filial Reverence to his hoary Sire cursing the Gout Pitargo and the Rheum for ending him no sooner In short the Scenes would be too shocking they would quite imbite Life  Those philosophical Gentlemen who have searched into the Secrets of Na∣ture have admired the Wisdom of Pro∣vidence in kindly concealing from us many things which known would make us wretched I am sure it was well for poor Captain  Meade  this Woman's Breast was not transparent  They have farther observed that were our Perceptions stronger than they are the Senses which convey Pleasure to us would become the Instruments of intoler∣rable Pain  The Touch if tremblingly alive all o'er  Would smart and agonize at ev'ry Pore  Or quick Effluvia darted to the Brain  Die of a Rose in aromatic Pain  Shou'd Nature thunder in our open'd Ears  And stun us with the Music of the Spheres  Pope  's Essay on Man  How terrible must be our Condition  Most married Persons even in the happiest Wedlock which is at best but tolerable look back with secret Regret on the sweet Hours of Freedom when no Anxiety reign'd such as the Care of a Family the Sickness or Dis∣obedience of Children the total Loss of them and a thousand Troubles which perplex the married Life and yet no  sooner are they single but they run into the same Toils again hardly affording time for a decent Mourning Strange In∣fatuation In which I think the Ladies more excusable than the Men since their Weakness may make them want a Pro∣tector yet they who can have Resolution enough to know no second Bridebed but the Grave certainly claim a higher Degree of Respect and Veneration  In this aimable Light shines the present Lady Dowager  Meade  who tho' left a Widow in the Bloom of her Youth and Beauty the Widow of a Gentleman old enough to be her Father who lost her sole Guardian to their Offspring turn'd all her Thoughts to the Improvement of her Childrens Minds and Fortunes in both of which Heaven crown'd her Goodness with Success and the World with Honour  I could mention another great Lady not unallied to her who though she has many Virtues as I have acknowledged in my first Volume being left exactly in the same Situation was so faithful a  Steward for her Son that with his Rents which she received during his Minority she purchased an Estate for herself a thousand Pounds a Year Jointure not be∣ing sufficient for her neither would she ever come to any Account with him for the Produce of his Estate The Gentle∣man had too high a Sense of filial Piety to commence any Suit in Law against his Mother though she was married to a second Husband much younger than her∣self and has been  Like to a Stepdame or a Dowager  "Long withering out a young Man's Revenue"  Shakespear  I am sure Mr  Pilkington  I pray heartily for your Life lest I should ever be such a Fool as to engage in new Scenes of Trouble for if I could not keep your Heart properly due to me at a Time when the flattering World called me agreeable  Much less would my declining Age  A second Husband's Love engage  Nor from the Dregs of Life could I re∣ceive  What the first sprightly Running could not give  And now to convince you that I bear no Malice to you I will tell you an authentic Truth true as the Gospel for one Truth is even by mathematical Demonstration adequate to another  I was since I came to  Dublin  invited to a Widower's House to Dinner As his Business called him out he had left Orders for my Reception your youngest Son was with me and we were shewn into a Parlour where a Gentleman sat reading my first Volume I did not in∣terrupt him as he seem'd to be deeply engaged The Master of the House com∣ing in and saying  "Mrs  Pilkington  I am very glad to see you and your Son"  made the Gentleman look at us attentively After Dinner he told us he had a Bond and Judgment entered on  it against you at the Suit of Mr  Clark  the Brewer that hitherto he had been compassionate supposing us to be such Creatures as your Imagination had painted us out to the Worl  to be But said he now I am convinced of my Error I shall shew him no farther Mercy My Boy starting up cry'd What do you mean to do to my Father Nothing said Mr  Edwards  only to try how he will brook Imprisonment 'tis full as fi  for him as for your Mother for my own part I was weak enough to burst into Tears and your Son swore a good privateer Oath that he would shoot any Man who should offer to distress his Father  Mr  Edward  seem'd surprised as judg∣ing no doubt we should have re∣joiced in your Calamity as you had done in ours yet being of a generous humane Disposition he was touch'd with our Sorrows and granted that Liberty you now enjoy to our Intercession You know the Pers  n and if I set down a Falshood let him disprove me  Upon my Word I must contradict the witty Mr  Congreve  who says  Heaven has no Rage like Love to Hatred turn'd  Nor Hell a Fury like a Woman scorn'd  For I do not hate you I am in an Apathy a cool Suspence from Pleasure and from Pain both of which I must acknowledge I received from you but that was when you wrote in my Praise and at the very same time said every thing disagreeable to me Was not this done to deceive the World  "I will make them believe I love her and as she has too much Pride and Decency to complain of me I will in∣dulge my Pleasure abroad with Miss  His present Wife  Ny Sds  or the Widow or any We"  I can't indeed say but Miss  Sds  's Father owed a Favour to Mr  Pilkington  who kindly taking Compassion on his Necessities when his Lady was not sa∣tisfied with his keeping a Mistress in the  House with her and insisted on her be∣ing dismiss'd Mr  Pn  ever hu∣mane received her to his Habitation with open Arms gave the old Gentle∣man free Ingress and Egress for which he gratefully permitted the Parson to go to bed to his Daughter indeed I should have pitied her had she been deceived by the Report of my Death so industri∣ously spread into Marriage but she had it under my own Hand that I was living for I did the Creature the Honour St as she is to write to her in order to prevent her being imposed on I think the Form of Matrimony really wants an Explanation if we go according to the strict Letter of the Law What a happy State must a young Woman imagine her∣self entering into where she is to be lov'd honour'd cherish'd nay even worshipped she has a Protector till the Hour of Death who is to forsake all even his Parents for her if it be re∣quired who endows her with his For∣tune and promises all this solemnly at the Altar  Then follow the Words  Those whom  GOD  hath joined let no Man put as∣sunder  Now let us see how this is really to be interpreted at least how far this Cove∣nant is usually kept  No sooner is the Honeymoon expir'd but the fawning Servant turns a haughty Lord Instead of honouring his Wife 'tis Odds if he treats her with common Civility he shall tell her to her Face he wishes her Death in order to marry another The Custom authorizes this free way of speaking yet I never knew it agreeable to any Wife nor did I ever doubt but the Husband spoke in the Sin∣cerity of his Heart  As for our being endow'd with the worldly Goods of our Husbands 'tis known they are so little apt to share with us that it has always been found necessary in a MarriageSettlement to stipulate for Pinmoney a very useful Clause even to the Husband and it is much better his Wife should have a Share of his Fortune than be obliged to a  Gallant for a Trifle which Gratitude may make her repay in too tender a manner  Indeed the last Article against Divorce∣ment I intirely disapprove of and am glad it has seem'd good to the Wisdom of the Church to act in direct Contra∣diction to it This has made Numbers easy and as they tell us 'tis not lawful to separate on any Cause save that of Adultery A Woman of Spi  it who is married to a sordid disagreeable Wretch has nothing to do but to make him a Cuckold and then welcome thrice dear Liberty Yet methinks the Husbands should in Justice return to their Wives when they abandon them the Dowry they brought with them Now lest my worthy Husband should say by this Rule I should have nothing who had not a Portion regularly paid and yet was a pe  petual Fortune to him I'll tell him a Story  The Countess of  Eglantine  one of the greatest Beauties in  Scotland  fell under the Displeasure of her Lord for no other  Cause but having brought him seven Daughters all charming as this fair Northern Lass and never a Son On this his Lordship assured her he was deter∣mined to sue for a Divorce The Lady told him she would readily agree to a Separation provided he gave her back what he had with her He supposing she meant pecuniary Affairs assured her she should have her Fortune to the last Penny Nay nay my Lord said she  "that winna do return me my Youth Beauty and Virginity and dismiss me as soon as you please"  His Lord∣ship being unable to answer this Demand spoke no more of parting with his Lady and e'er the Year expired she made him the glad Father of a lovely Boy whose Birth restored Love and Harmony to his noble Parents This was related to me by the late Lord  Primrose  and therefore I believe it  But now Mr  Pn  tho' I pre∣sented you with this Piece don't think I meant you should take a Hint and endeavour to end our matrimonial War∣fare  in the same manner No no tho' you linger about the Door in an Evening in your long Cloke and Slops and that I do believe thee to be my Spouse by the amorous Glances darted thro' thy Spyglass at the Window of my sacred and sequestred Bower where no profane thing Priest Dog nor Worm dare en∣ter I am resolved to remain obdurate Sooner shall Lambs make Love to Lambs Tygers to Tygers and every Creature couple with its Foe as the Poet wittily expresses it than I unite with thee  Yet verily thou dost manifest some Tokens of Grace inasmuch as thou darest not to contradict the Truth I fancy when thy  Penusing  Talents perish'd thy  Penmaking  ones shot forth which have been so fortunate as to recommend thee more effectually to a certain B's Favour than could ten hundred thousand Folios sprung from thy shallow Brain  And truly this is an useful Accom∣plishment I wish I possessed it 'twould save me some Pence in the Year but there are different Talents bestow'd on  different People I must even rest con∣tented with such as I have  And sooner will I wear  My Plectrum to the Stump in using of it Nay  Not blacker Tube nor of a shorter Size  Smoaks CambrioBriton vers'd in Pedi∣gree  Who on a Cargo of fam'd Cestrian Cheese  High overshadowing rides  Philips  's  Splend Shill  than mine shall be  Ere once my learned Pate  Ducks to a golden Fool  I make no Application  There are many strange Ways of get∣ting into the Favour of the Great Pimp∣ing Lying Flattering Who can be Proof against the Force of such united Virtues For your great Men who have too much Honour to pay a just Debt never fail to reward the Servant of their  Vices and it may be some odd Knack recommends them where those baser Applia  s are not required On which I have thought of a Story not quite fo∣reign to the present Purpose  A Man who had a spent a good Part of his Life in dri  ing Pins into a Wall on the Point of each he would with infi∣nite Dexterity throw a Pea his Fame spread even to the Emperor who desired to see this matchless Son of Science over∣joyed he came shewed his Trick to the infinite Pleasure of the Spectators the Emperor highly applauded him and as he supposed this must be a Work of long Practice to arrive at such a Proficiency in it demanded of him how many Years he had spent in attaining it the Fellow being willing to inhance his own Merit assured the Monarch he had spent thirty Years in it on which the Emperor ordered him thirty Bastinadoes on the Soals of his Feet for having so much misspent his Time  And my dear Husband if you have your Desert you merit just such a Re∣ward for misapplying Time in Trifles  Writing one good Sermon or useful Book both of which when I knew you you were as capable of as most young Men would have tended more to your Reputation than any merely mechanical Art  But in short I sincerely pity you and if ever you want a Shilling let me but know it and if I have the good Fortune to have a Guinea Subscription for Gen∣tlemen seldom send me any smaller Coin you shall not go without one  The dignified Clergy indeed have been niggardly to me Yet not against them all do I bring this Accusation many of them have even a bleeding Humanity for the Distresses of their Fellow Creatures and have not only pitied but assisted me and while I can in that noble List inroll the sacred Names of  Berkley  and  Delany  Patterns of Virtue in their Lives really apostolick in their Doctrine winning straying Souls with Goodness and Humi∣lity learned as far as Humanity can soar surely no other of the Clergy need send me a Message when they subscribe not to  divulge so terrible a Secret I always in this Case judge there is more Fear than Charity in their Contributions But here I must remember a certain cross Dean to whom as my Father was Physician I took the Liberty of applying My Son went with the Letter he came out and cried "Boy opening his ponderous and toothless Jaws what do you want An Answer Sir said he why then my Answer is I won't My Son protested he was quite startled at his ferocious Features and stentorian Voice Yet after all we laugh'd away our In∣dignation as he was really not worth it  This admirable Orator ought to have a larger Rostrum than the narrow Limits of a Pulpit to display his graceful Action and neverenough to be admired Grimace A Theatre would suit his Genius a Puppet one I mean where glorious Punch himself must yield the Prize  I remember once to have seen this Re∣verend Flamen in his lengthened Dress ascend St  Andrew  's Pulpit where re∣collecting  the enormous Iniquities of the Congregation he of sudden gave so fu∣rious a Toss to his Head like a metal∣some Horse hard rein'd that back fell his Wig and down flew his Sermon which not being well secured fluttered in nume∣rous Leaves about the Church scattered like the Ungodly as Chaff before the Wind the Sleepers awoke the old Men who dream'd Dreams and the Virgins who saw Visions started from their dow∣ny Trance and he willing at least to give us his Benediction cried aloud  "Depart ye cursed into everlasting Fire which that ye may all do  c c c  "  The late Lady  Rawden  not long after she became a Widow invited the Dean as her Parish Minister to Dinner the Lady went to take the Air and Sir  John  then a Child was in the Parlour the Dean fell into Chat with the sweet Boy and amongst other Questions said do you know me No Sir why I am Dean C your Parish Minister Poor Master innocently verified the old Pro∣verb  that Children speak Truth for he cried out O indeed I heard my Mam∣ma say you were the worst Preacher in  Dublin  His Reverence's Wrath was hereupon so rais'd that he failed not to reproach the Lady who to pacify him corrected the poor Child However she could not avoid relating the Story which I heard from Lady  Rawden  at Mrs  Percival  's to the infinite Laughter of the Auditors and which I from henceforth consign to Fame in these my immortal Labours  I was much obliged to Sir  John  's Hu∣manity in  London  which I gratefully ac∣knowledge But there is one great Man I cannot pass over great according to Serjeant  Kite  's Definition of one for he is full six Foot high his Fortune rais'd from the noble Spirit of Malt for I do remember like Prince  Henry  that poor Creature's SmallBeer which his Father sold to mine and from the golden Grains arose a princely Fortune from the humbly Dray appeared a Coach such as Ambassadors use when on public  Occasions they by their State give us a Picture of the Grandeur of the Poten∣tate they represent  For if the Man such Honour have  What must be his who keeps the Knave  Not that I would hence infer all Am∣bassadors to be Rogues farther than ly∣ing a little for the Good of their King and Country  It was this worthy Gentleman who told them at  White  's that I had nothing to publish I had quick Intelligence of his Favour after which Obligation he came to visit me and would have been very kind to me because I was a Gentlewo∣man a Person he could depend on and he was then in Distress being at a Distance from his Lady and native Coun∣try to be sure I ought to have been cha∣ritable but that I always stood in the Way of my own Preferment and ano∣ther unlucky Circumstance for my Swain was that I remembered the deplorable  Condition to which he reduced his first Wife who died of his Love as did also his Child the Nurse it was given to and her Husband Noble Atchievements worthy of your illustrious Birth and Lineage For  'Tis you can taint the sweetest Joy  And in the Shape of Love destroy  However I should have pass'd you over in Silence but that you told a Nobleman here I had been quite compliant to your Desire Why then you prove yourself a generous Lover in sending me Five Bri∣tish Shillings for a Book A wondrous Bounty really why your Neighbour the B always pays a Moidore Commu∣tation for Adultery and sure you ought to give more than a Man who by the Power committed to him from above is entitled to give himself Absolution  Your hoary canting Sire was a Votary to  Venus  even in old Age When a certain Widow and her dancing Daugh∣ter lodged at  Glasnevin  a young Gen∣tleman  who was much enamoured of the younger Dame used to visit her every Evening as he did not care to have it known he went in thro' a low Window to Miss's Bedchamber It happened that Miss being abroad the venerable Pair made Choice of that Place to indulge the gentler Passions The young Gentle∣man came according to Custom and without Ceremony threw up the Sash flew in and unfortunately started from their downy Couch the reverend Elder and the chaste Matron  Miss following her Mother's Example resigned her Virgin Charms to you and lost at once her Health and Reputa∣tion  This might have been my unhappy Lot but that however careless I have been about Reputation I was always de∣termined not to put my own precious Person into any Peril  Now says my Reader if he be a Gi∣ber how this prating old Woman who certainly never had any Temptation boasts of Chastity Ay 'tis no Matter I  have had so many amorous Epistles Odes Songs Anacreonticks Saphics Lyricks and Pindaricks in Praise of my Mind and Person too sent to me since I came to  Ireland  that I believe some Gentlemen tho' I cannot have found me out to be a marvellous proper Woman  I'll get my Room hung round with LookingGlasses  And entertain a score or two of Tay∣lors  And study Fashions to adorn my Body  And some time or other as I find it is the Mode in  London  for the Ladies to publish the Triumphs of their Eyes and how many Men fell a Prey to their Lux∣ury or as Dr  Young  says  Had ever Nymph such Reason to be glad  In Duel fell three Lovers two ran mad  Though I cannot indeed produce such dreadful Proofs of my Beauty as some of them nor chuse I to have my Print ex∣hibited before my Work but Testimo∣nies of Authors with Regard to it I hope I may be allowed The same Va∣nity Mr  Pope  shews in the Vindication of his Wit Learning and Humanity may be pardoned in a Female in the Vin∣dication of that far nobler Part external Loveliness for a Mind in a Woman is of little Consequence Dr  Young  seems of a different Mind but great Authors sometimes vary As it is now my Inte∣rest to be of his Side the Question I shall give his Opinion and who knows if it should chance to be true but my Admirers may be real ones  What's Female Beauty but an Air divine  Thro' which the Mind's all gentle Graces shine  They like the Sun irradiate all between  The Body charms because the Soul is seen  Hence some we see are Captives of a Face  They know not why of no peculiar Grace  And so much for what I never had ex∣cept according to his Judgment There as a Proof of my Humility I put in my Claim and will like  See Zenophon's Banquet  Socrates  dispute the Prize even with  Alcibiades  Now I have mentioned this small but inimitable well wrote Book which was recommended to me by Dr  Swift  and which I in return commend to all such of my fair Readers as have a Taste for real Wit in which the divine  Socrates  as con∣spicuously shone as he did in Purity of Life and Constancy in Martyrdom that they peruse it with Care as it will refine their Ideas and improve their Judgments polish their Stile shew them true Beauty and lead them gently and agreeably to its  prime Origin and Source here they will find  Divine Philosophy  Not so harsh and rugged as some falsely think  But musical as is  Apollo  's Lute  And a perpetual Feast of nectar'd Sweets  Where no crude Surfeit reigns  Milton  I must here observe in my tracing Au∣thors thro' each other  Zenophon  and  Plato  borrowed from  Socrates  whose Disciples they were  Zenophon  acknow∣ledges it as freely as I do the Instructions I received from Dr  Swift  Lord  Shafts bury  's Search after Beauty is copied from  Socrates  Mr  Pope  's Ethics stolen from both and the learned Mr  Hutcheson  's Beauty and Harmony an Imitation of the great Philosophers and excellent Moralists first mentioned  Had Mr  Hutcheson  stop'd at this Book by which he had acquired some Degree of Reputation both as a Writer a Divine  and a Mathematician he had done wisely but O his Essay on the Passions over∣turned his scarce established Praise if it has any Meaning it is like dark veil'd  Cotyto  in her Ebon Chair close curtained round impenetrably obscure or from his Flames  No Light but rather Darkness vi∣sible  I really thought it was the Defect of my Head that made me not comprehend this Piece till I heard the present Lord Bishop of  Elphin  whose Learning or Judgment were never yet doubted declare he did not understand it After all whether the Defect lay in the Book or the Bp let the Reader determine  Wollaston  's Religion of Nature deli∣neated tho' frequently intermingled with Mathematical Proofs is yet so plain that it demonstrates the Author's Thoughts clearly which whoever does can never fail to write with equal Per∣spicuity But Learning seems encum∣bered  with Words or technical Terms sig∣nifying nothing and our Schoolmasters lest our Children should attain it too soon if they should lead them to the Fountain from whence the Streams of Knowledge flow copious to quench or rather to in∣crease that Desire of it which we observe from their first prattling Infancy chuse rather to make them begin at the Bottom of some Rivulet from whence with in∣finite Difficulty when they have waded about half Way they are obliged to re∣tire by the Command of another then begin at another till wearied they give over and hate the fruitless endless un∣profitable Toil I believe that formerly they had a better Method of instructing than what is now practised I judge this by the Eloquence shewn by the Youth of those Ages and the beautiful Pieces of Poetry still extant some of them stiled the minor Poets perhaps to distinguish them from the venerable Antients or on Account of the juvenile Years of the Authors  Perhaps Nature in her prime Creation was productive of more Strength and Beauty even in the Mind than at this Time when Luxury and Excess pull down our ros'dcheek'd Youth emaciate their Bodies and enervate their Under∣standings for Mind and Body are so closely united that whatever affects the one must of Consequence affect the other  I hope my Reader will pardon my Re∣flections on the Works of those valuable Writers I have mentioned for I mean no Disrespect to their sacred Memories but as I am accused of being a Plagiary my∣self which I own I am my Intention is to prove all Writers to be Thieves as well as their humble Servant  Shakespear  alone excepted  Some of my learned Correspondents send me Word I do not write these my own Memoirs why I fancy were I to publish their Epistles the World would not believe that any of them were my As∣sistants but their Modesty makes them  conceal their Names and I have no Cu∣riosity to discover them  With such all Authors steal their Works or buy  Garth  did not write his own Dispen∣sary  Pope  But Authors are a little too fond of Fame to let any one run away with it from them or a tolerable Performance pass for the Work of another I speak from Experience I have wrote for Num¦bers and do still but no Human Crea∣ture ever helped me out with a single Line if they did let it appear a∣gainst me and my Writings be torn to Fragments or condemned to Flames  And talking of burning puts me in mind of dear Lord  Kingsborough  who because he saw that I endeavour'd to do but barely Justice to his inimitable Pen bid me burn all his Letters upon which in a Passion I snatch'd up my Pen even before his Face and scribbled the follow∣ing Lines  To the Right Hon the Lord  KINGS∣BOROUGH  For the Benefit of the illiterate to whom these Lines may appear as obscure as some in  Persius  let them read the Works of  Livy  and  Pythagoras  and mayhap they may guess at the meaning if they cannot their Time at least will be innocent∣ly employ'd till they can come at the Grand Ar∣cana of the Rosicrusians or discover the Lon∣gitude  How could my dear Lord make me such a Request  I flatter myself you are only in Jest  Those Epistles which all my soft Rap∣tures inspire  Do you think I could bear to commit to the Fire  Like  Mutius  I'd put my own Hand in the Flame  For the Elements us'd to compose your lov'd Name  Should I promise Obedience I surely should lye  Give me a more gentle Command I'll comply  But here I should baffle the best of your Art  For each Line you have wrote is en∣grav'd on my Heart  His Lordship was so humane as not to insist on my Obedience and now my Lord I tell you publickly that not the grim Tyrant Death shall divorce me from the inestimable Treasure I possess they shall rest with me in the Grave next to my Heart  When every Motion Sense and Pulse is o'er  And even my  Kingsborough  belov'd no more  I have often my Lord reflected with Pleasure on the Blessing my Father gave me when he brought your Lordship in∣to the World why according to the Mid∣wife's Phrase you are one of his Chil∣dren and consequently my Brother for I must prove a Kindred to you though I fetch it from  Japheth  as I have been long buried to my Brother and by your  Lordship's Bounty have acquired a kind of second Birth  New born I may a nobler Brother claim  And join'd to thine immortalize my Name  Pardon my Presumption if I am too bold 'tis owing to your Lordship's Indulgence both to my Scribbling and Prattling Vein So  You must excuse a Nymph of Letters  Thus Poets often treat their Betters  But I think I must speak in the Superla∣tive Mood and call you best of Men for what Day of your Life passes with∣out a worthy Deed to crown it Your Virtue would sigh to lose one  Indeed my Lord I love you and if you are too great to be beloved  Be greater greater still and be ador'd  Now in return I beg a Place in your Friendship where if I grow the Har∣vest is your own  But Oh I am Sick of many Griefs  And this frail Tenement of Clay  Must quickly very quick decay  But perhaps all things are ordered for the best on which Hope I relate what I know to be Truth  A Captain of a Man of War took a Fancy to despise his Wife and engage with another Woman The Wife took it patiently till at last he had the Impu∣dence to tell her he would either bring his Harlot to live with her or she and his three Children should turn out The Lady was confounded at so strange a Proposal and begg'd three Days time to consider of it and then she would give him a determinate Answer He agreed She told her Affliction to a Friend and begg'd her Advice on which they resolved to consult Doctor  Potter  late Lord Archbishop of  Canter∣bury  Accordingly they took a Boat and went to  Lambeth  The good Prelate proposed an Invocation to the Almighty  to direct their Counsels After Prayers he desired the Lady not by any means to quit her House but to acquiesce in her Husband's Desire and let him bring the Woman home and depend on it said he God will assist you and what at present appears an Evil will turn out a Blessing to you So giving them his Be∣nediction they departed full of Hope of an happy Issue  The Husband who flatter'd himself that the Wife would quit the House was not a little astonish'd to find her quite submissive to his Commands and consent∣ing to live with his Mistress  Accordingly he ordered his Chariot bade his Wife prepare Dinner and went for his Harlot whom he brought home triumphant and handed into the Diningroom the Wife received her with a Ci∣vility that confounded and enraged her she brought her a Glass of  Lisbon  Wine and then left her with the Captain who in a few Minutes came down and seeing all things ready for Dinner ordered his Wife to go and bring the Lady down  She obey'd but Madam called her a hundred Names flew at the Captain beat him and put herself in such a Rage that she fell into Fits was seiz'd with a Fever and died  After this Catastrophe the Captain seriously reflecting on the Submission and Virtue of his Wife thus address'd her My Dear if I thought there was a Possibility of your pardoning my past Errors and never reproaching me with them I do assure you I wou'd never fall in∣to them again but make a faithful tender Husband to you The Lady burst into joyful Tears at this happy Change and kindly assured him she would never even think of what was past She told him it was by the Archbishop's Advice she had acted with the Moderation she now found to be so happy in the Event and they both went to thank the venerable Prelate who truly partook in their Joy The Captain died about a Year after and left his whole Fortune to his Lady who lives an honourable Widow at  Green∣wich  Thus we may see if we persevere in our Duty the Almighty is not slow to hear nor reward  But when we sink beneath a Load of Grief  By unforeseen Expedients brings Relief  I was told a pretty Circumstance of his Grace when he was at  Westminster  School It seems he stood terribly in awe of the Rod and having committed some Mistake that deserved Chastisement which Doctor  Busby  was very liberal in bestowing he was ready to die with the Apprehension of it when a good boldspirited Lad taking Compassion on him own'd the Fault and took the Whip∣ing for which his timid Friend pro∣mised to be grateful if ever it came in his way to serve him They both took holy Orders but met not till many Years after when his Grace was an Archbishop his Friend remained a Curate but Time which brings all things about so order'd it that the Archbishop and the Curate  met at a Nobleman's House His Grace hearing him named recollected both the Gentleman the Whipping and his own Promise of Gratitude and finding the Curate had no Preferment he gave him a very good Living  I hope these Incidents will not be dis∣agreeable to my Readers as I really set down nothing but what I know to be Truth which is more than most of our modern Memorialists can say who present us with Heaps of Improbabilities and ex∣pect implicit Faith from us and if what some of them have told us be genuine though it may redound to their Profit it never can to their Honour for their Actions are neither worthy being record∣ed nor their Writings of being read the true End of Writing being to give In∣struction with Pleasure which whoever is so happy to do may justly hope for a Place in the Temple of Fame But  All human kind will needs be Wits  "Tho' Millions miss for one that hits  "Our chilling Climate hardly bears  "A Sprig of Bays in Fifty Years  "Yet every Fool his Claim alleges  "As if it grew in common Hedges  Swift's Rhapsody  And having once more quoted our un∣rivalled Dean and being well assured no Part of my Work can be half so agree∣able or entertaining to the Publick as that which relates to him I shall as far as in my Power present them with his lively Portraiture The most minute Circumstances relating to so great a Man cannot I hope be deem'd trivial since we find by Experience that the NightScene so beautifully drawn by  Shakespear  between  Brutus  and his Domesticks sleeping in his Tent the little Incident of his taking the Lute out of the Boy's Hand and saying when he fell asleep  This is a sleepy TuneO murtherous Sleep  Layest thou thy leaden Mace upon my Boy  That plays thee Musick Gentle Knave good Night  I will not do thee so much Wrong to wake thee  If thou dost nod thou break'st thy Instru∣ment  I'll take it from thee and good Boy good Night  Do we not love him more in this ami∣able View of him than in all his Con∣quests or that sad Act whereby he thought to give his Country Liberty The World are sufficiently acquainted with the Dean's publick Character be it then my Task to trace him in private Life for there only it is we can frame a true Judgment of any Person the rest is frequently mere Outside  When the Dean was at  Bellcamp  at the House of the Reverend Doctor  Grat∣ton  he wrote to Doctor  Delany  to come and dine with him mighty  Thomas Thumb  and her serene Highness of  Lilly∣put  meaning my Husband and me Ac∣cordingly we went the Dean came out  to meet us and I by Agreement hiding my Face Mr  Pilkington  told him they had picked up a Girl on the Road and desired to know whether they might bring her in He guessing who it was said let her shew her Face and if she be likely we'll admit her On this I took down my Fan and said O in∣deed Sir I am Well then said he give me your Hand He led me into a Parlour where there were twelve Clergy men and said those Fellows coming in had brought a Wench with them but added he we'll give her a Dinner poor Devil and keep the Secret of our Bre∣threnAs most of the Gentlemen knew me we were very merry on this odd Introduction  Pox on you you Slut said the Dean you gave me a Hint for my polite Con∣versation which I have pursued You said it would be better to throw it into Dialogue and suppose it to pass amongst the Great I have improved by you O dear Sir said I 'tis impossible you should do otherwise Matchless Sauciness re∣turn'd  he Well but I'll read you the Work which he did with infinite Hu∣mour to our high Entertainment  It was  Christmas  time and froze very hard The Dean meditating Revenge set the Wine before a great Fire the Corks of the Wine being secured with Pitch and Rosin which began in a little while to melt No sooner did the Dean perceive they were fit for his Purpose but he slyly rubbed his Fingers on them and daubed my Face all over Instead of being vexed as he expected I would I told him he did me great Honour in sealing me for his own Plague on her said he I can't put her out of Temper yet he seemed determined to do it if possible for he asked the Company if they had ever seen such a Dwarf and insisted that I should pull off my Shoes till he measured me To this I had no Inclination to submit but he was an ab∣solute Prince and Resistance would have little availed me so when I obey'd he said Why I suspected you had either  broken Stockings or foul Toes and in either Case should have delighted to have exposed you  He then made me stand up against the Wainscot leaned his Hand as heavy as he could upon my Head till I shrunk under the Weight to almost half my Proportion then making a Mark with his Pencil he affirmed I was but three Foot two Inches high  Dinner was brought up and I being like Mrs  Qualmsick  the Curate's Wife always a breeding could not eat any the Gentlemen guessing at my Circum∣stances by my decreasing Face and in∣creasing Waste were so overobliging to know what I liked best that at last I told the Dean I wish'd I was a Man that I might be treated with less Cere∣mony Why said the Dean it may be you are I wish Sir said I you would put the Question to the Company and accordingly to their Votes let my Sex be determined I will said he  Fil∣kington  what say you A Man Sir they all took his Word and in Spite  of Petticoats I was made a Man of af∣ter Dinner I was obliged to put a To∣baccopipe in my Mouth but they so far indulged me as to let it be an empty one as were the Dean's Doctor  Delany  's and my Husband's  The Dean asked me could I play Crib∣bidge I said I could Upon which he called for Cards but upon Recollection said he would not play with a Beggar for he should stand no Chance for if he won he would not take the Money and if he lost he must in Honour pay But why a Beggar Mr Dean said Doctor  Delany  A married Curate must of Con∣sequence be a Beggar return'd he and you are another and Pox on me if I can ever get acquainted with any Persons but Beggars and I don't think but this Woman or Man here is in the way of producing another Then Sir I hope you will be so kind to stand Godfather which will secure it from so hard a Fate So said he more Demands upon me Well if it be a Boy I don't much care  if I do but if it be a little Bitch I'll never answer for her  A Day or two after this the Dean came to Town and summoning a  Sena∣tus Consultum  as he called those few Friends whom he peculiarly regarded he placed us round a great Table where he told us we were an empannell'd Jury and he placed himself at the Head of it where he sat as Judge He then told us the Reason why we were summoned Mr  Gratton  's favourite Hen was put to Death by an unlucky Stroke of a Whip by one of my Fellows as I suppose I accused them and they denied the Fact but as Murder always will come to light I found the Hen's Head and Neck in the Seat of my Chaisebox and now I want to convict the Criminal Accordingly he ordered his three Men Servants to come before us and related the following Story to them When Doctor  Donne  after∣wards Dean of  St Paul's London  took Possession of the first Living he ever had being a speculative Man he took a Walk into the Churchyard where the Sexton  was digging a Grave and throwing up a Skull the Doctor took it up to con∣template thereon and found a small Sprig or headless Nail sticking in the Temple which he drew out secretly and wrapt it up in the Corner of his Hand∣kerchief he then demanded of the Grave∣digger whether he knew whose Skull that was He said he did very well declar∣ing it was a Man's who kept a Brandyshop an honest drunken Fellow who one Night taking two Quarts of that comfortable Creature was found dead in his Bed the next Morning Had he a Wife said the Doctor Yes Sir Is she living Yes What Character does she bear a very good one only indeed the Neighbours reflected on her because she married the Day after her Husband was buried though to be sure she had no great Reason to grieve after him This was enough for the Doctor who under Pretence of visiting all his Parishioners called on her he asked her several Que∣stions and amongst others What Sick∣ness her first Husband died of She giv∣ing  him the same Account he had be∣fore received he suddenly opened the Handkerchief and cried in an authori∣tative Voice  Woman do you know this Nail  She was struck with Horror at the unexpected Demand and instantly owned the Fact And so Fellow said Dean  Swift  do you know this Head The Criminal confessed his Fault and the Jury brought him in guilty of Hen∣slaughter in his own Defence for he declared he was hungry and did eat it having no Malice prepense to it but ra∣ther Love On Account of his Sincerity and our Intercession the Dean pardon'd him  Mr  Gratton  had presented the Dean with a small Cask of fine Ale of which he was very choice good MaltLiquor not being easily purchased even in  Ire∣land  On  Sunday  Evening the Dean's Set of Intimates came as usual to pass it with him and he being in high good Humour said he would treat us with a Pot of this Ale I had the Honour of being intrusted with the Key of the Cel∣lar  with a particular Order to hold the Candle in such a Position that it might drop into the Tankard as also not to put the Spiggot fast in but let the Drink run about After receiving his Com∣mands which I promised punctually to obey I went down but had scarce open'd the Door when Doctor  Delany  and Doc∣tor  Sheridan  were with me O Breach of Trust unpardonable We sat down on a Bench and each of us drank but we laughed so heartily at cheating the Dean that he stole down having some Suspicion that where there was a Wo∣man and two Clergymen there might be a Plot and surprised us I in Imita∣tion of his Servant told him the Par∣sons seduced me and I did drink Pox choke you all said he  In vain did I with all the moving Eloquence of a female Orator plead for Pardon The Key was taken from me and Mr  Rochford  was before my Face invested with my Honours and I Oh fatal Sentence condemn'd to be Sockwasher  to the blackguard Boy who wait∣ed on the under Butler's under Butler  I would have persuaded Mr  Rochford  to plead in my Behalf but he was obdu∣rate as Adamant especially as by my Disgrace he rose However not long after I presented him with an humble Petition wherein I failed not to extol the Neatness of the Boy's Feet since they came into my Hands insomuch  that not the nicest Nose  Cou'd in the Dogdays smell his Toes  And as a Reward I was made In∣spectoressgeneral of all the drinking Ves∣sels but no more intrusted with the Key of the Cellar To say the Truth I could not well vindicate my Conduct in that im∣portant Point  The Dean had twenty of those agree∣able Whims which kept us all chearful as was his Intent for I suppose my Readers will believe that neither he nor we valued the Ale but for the Jest's sake  No Man living told a Story to more Advantage than the Dean there never was a Word too little or too much in it it was always apt full clear and concise truly epigrammatick  It would be well for their Readers if some of our Writers had learn'd this happy Art but they draw out their Tales to a tiresome Length dwelling on every trivial Circumstance and omitting things of greater Consequence and when they would seem wise they grow obscure  Thus the small Silkworm spins her slender Store  And labours till she clouds herself all o'er  Pope  The Dean told me he did remember that he had not laugh'd above twice in his Life once at some Trick a Moun∣tebank's MerryAndrew play'd and the other time was at the Circumstance of  Tom Thumb  's killing the Ghost and I can assure Mr  Fielding  the Dean had a high Opinion of his Wit which must  be a Pleasure to him as no Man was ever better qualified to judge possessing it so eminently himself  Yet was he so free from any vain Os∣stentation of it that he could suit his Converse to the Talents of his Company insomuch that I believe had they pro∣posed to play Pushpin or talk Non∣sense he would have complied even with the latter if it had been in his Power  I have known him fill up Rhymes given after the manner of the  French  though he had found it true musical Rhythm so esteem'd by the Antients nay he could deal in the  Pun ambiguous or Conundrum quaint  Which some booklearned Blockheads for such I have seen with each a Store of Lumber crude and undigested in their Brains would no doubt have scorn'd But as  Horace  observes there is a Sweet∣ness in sometimes mingling Folly with Wisdom and I am well convinced no Person without a good Understanding can even play the Fool agreeably  Triflers can't even in trifling excel  For only solid Bodies polish well  Young  One Night that I had the Honour to be in as polite a Set of Company as ever  Europe  bred they took a Fancy that each of them would imitate the Voice of a different Animal either Bird or Beast each having fixed on what suited their Inclination they began the Con∣sort at once Would not any one who had refused to join in the Frolick have seem'd ridiculous 'Tis true indeed this was attended with one mortifying Con∣sequence for the Servants scar'd at the hideous Yelling and concluding we were all fighting ran hastily in to part us but finding all was right they left us however we heard them laugh heartily at our Entertainment  As I have often mentioned the Dean's Charity one ill conferr'd Instance of it cannot I believe but make my Readers smile  He observed a Woman whose whole Estate was a Sieve of Fruit which she had in a Stall where she sat footing wornout Stockings Seeing the Woman very decent and always at work he judged her to be a proper Person for him to assist especially as by the Re∣port of her Neighbours she was a very honest Woman The Dean asked her why she did not try to borrow twenty Pounds and set up a handsome Fruit∣shop Alasaday Sir said she who would trust a poor Creature like me with such a Sum Why said he if I thought you would improve it I would lend it you The Woman promised fair and the Dean lent her the Money and at the same time wrote down the parti∣cular kinds of Fruit he would have her furnish herself with She was to let him know when she was stock'd and he pro∣mised to recommend her to Customers  The Woman overjoy'd at her good Fortune went about five o'Clock next Morning to a Gardener's produced her Bill of Fare on which they judging by her  Appearance she could not pay for such a Cargo laugh'd at her This provok'd the Pride of the newrais'd Beggar who to convince them of her Wealth produced it to their astonish'd View upon which they alter'd their Note and as it was a cold Morning said That  "Bargains were never made with dry Lips"  They drew in the poor Woman to drink plen∣tifully of  Brandy and Ale mixt  Hotpot which soon left her stupid in the Alehouse but not till they had first done her the Favour to rob her  When she came a little to herself the Woman of the House demanded Pay∣ment the Fellows being gone She was going to pay the Reckoning but alas her Money was gone too It was in vain for her to enquire for it everybody disavowed the Fact but the Gardener out of his great Charity gave her a Basket of Windfalls with which she was obliged seeing no Remedy to return to her origi∣nal Poverty  The Dean vainly look'd for the Pro∣duct of his Charity he could neither  see Shop nor Woman for she kept out of his way at length he happened in Church to be seiz'd with the Cholick and went out in the middle of Service and who stood at the Churchdoor but the very Person He stopp'd and de∣manded why he had not heard from her and how she proceeded Upon this the Woman flew into a Rage abused him all the Way to his own House told him that his cursed Money had bewitch'd her that all the Neighbours knew she was a modest virtuous sober Woman and that he had made her turn Whore and Drunkard the Dean ran in clap'd the the Door upon her and begged the Protection of his Domesticks against the mad Woman  And here I must observe that as the Dean was very justly satirical on the Vices of human Kind yet when he fell on Infirmities he seem'd to have done a displeasing Act to Heaven inasmuch as he was punished with them all in a re∣markable manner he lived to be a  Struldbrugg  helpless as a Child and un∣able to assist himself  I say not this as any Reflection to his sacred Memory Heaven forbid I should but with all the Reverence I have for the Dean I really think he sometimes chose Subjects unworthy of his Muse and which could serve for no other End ex∣cept that of turning the Reader's Sto∣mach as it did my Mother's who upon reading the  Lady's Dressingroom  in∣stantly threw up her Dinner  Here I digress oddly enough on a whimsical Circumstance Having once had the Honour of being known to Lady ****** I took the Liberty of applying to her for a Subscription her Neice came out and mistaking the Per∣son who brought the Letter for me said  "Her Lady wondered at my Impu∣dence to apply to her when I knew how I had used Sir ******"  But if ever I used him or he me then am I no twolegged Creature for to my Knowledge I never even saw him if the Man did dare to contradict me I  wou'd make him eat a Piece of my Pen But how used him not unlawfully I hope Did your Ladyship ever see me lewdly lolling on a Lovebed with him No if we ever met he was supported by two reverend Prelates proper Sup∣porters for a Christian Hero but I never heard that the Gentleman was addicted to Women so that I hope I may rest un∣censured by him and also by your Lp  I do this Madam in regard to the Gentleman's Character for my own is of no Consequence  'Tis Barebit and knawn by Treason's CankerTooth  Shakespear  And pray now Sir  C  for to thee I call but with no friendly Voice What time what Day what Hour did I ever disoblige you the Injuries you have done me I freely forgive and  If you please  Will honour you with Panegyrick Lays  But then take notice you must come down handsomely you are not Lord  Kingsborough  nor will my Verse flow spontaneous  His Virtues might the humblest Bards in∣spire  And fill their Bosoms with poetick Fire  So now for ever and for ever farewel  Brutus  if we do meet again why we shall laugh if not why surely we shall never weep a more inspiring Theme demands my Attention So Sir Knight of the Oracle adieu if thou dyest be∣fore me as you should since you stept into the World thirty Years e'er my dim Speck of Entity was animated I have wrote your Epitaph which I beg you may have engrav'd on your Tombstone lest you should not I will raise you a Monument more lasting than Brass  I presume by the Information of your Boots you have read  Horace  take your Encomium  Here lies the greatest Man that e'er was born  All Womankind sincerely did he scorn  And kept the good old Proverb in his Mind  He that won't go beforemust go be∣hind  And if my Printer should dare to put a dash or blank in your illustrious Name I will in Capitals insert it and you know  When in bold Capitals express'd  The dullest Reader takes the Jest  This Sir I give you as a farther Proof of my Impudence in which I own your Family to have far the Superiority to mine for though some of them did Ex∣ecution in the wellfought Field yet none of them were condemn'd to suffer one So read this and then to Breakfast with what Appetite you may  But after all I have said I bear you no Illwill but you began with me this Tennisgame and I have match'd my Racquet to the Balls and depend on't whoever begins with me I bear the Motto of the Thistle  Nemo me impune lacessit  The Hour now came when the Dean's Promise was to be claim'd as I brought forth a Son I wrote to him but he was in the Country and in five Days the Boy died The Dean did not return till I was a Fortnight brought to Bed  He came directly to visit me Mr  Pilkington  open'd the Door for him and brought him up to me After wishing me Joy he asked where was his God∣sonelect I told him in Heaven The Lord be praised said he I thought there was some good News in the way your Husband look'd so brisk Pox take me but I was in Hopes you were dead your∣self but 'tis pretty well as it is I have  sav'd by it and I should have got no∣thing by you  He drank a little Caudle with me and then went away about an Hour after his Servant brought me a Letter and a great Bundle of brown Paper sealed with the utmost Care and twisted round with I know not how many Yards of Packthread my Curiosity led me to read the Letter before I examined the Contents of the Paper which to the best of my Knowledge was this  Madam  I Send you a Piece of Plumbcake which I did intend should be spent at your Christening if you have any Objection to the Plumbs or do not like to eat them you may return them to  Madam  your sincere Friend and Servant  J Swift  I now examined the Contents of the Paper in which I found a Piece of Gin∣gerbread in which were stuck four  Guineas wrapt in white Paper on the Outside of each was wrote Plumb  I sent the Dean a real Piece of Pumb cake with this Answer  Sir  I Have heard that Ostridges could digest Iron but you give me a harder Task when you bid me eat Gold but suppose I should like the rich Streams of the  Tagus  flow potable Gold the Interpreta∣tion of which is that I mean to drink your Health this Minute in a Glass of Sack and am with the utmost Respect Sir  Your ever devoted Servant  L Pilkington  Just when he had fix'd Mr  Pilkington  to be Chaplain to Alderman  Barber  the Dean received from  Spain  from one Mr  Wogan  a green Velvet Bag in which was contained the Adventures of  Euge∣nius  as also an Account of the Court∣ship and Marriage of the Chevalier to the Princess  Sobiesky  wherein he repre∣sents  himself to have been a principal Ne∣gotiator It was wrote in the Novel Stile but a little heavily There was also some of the Psalms of  David  paraphras'd in  Miltonick  Verse and a Letter to the Dean with Remarks on the  Beggar's Opera  in which he says he believes the People of  England  and  Ireland  had quite lost all Remains of Elegance and Taste since their top Entertainments were com∣posed of Scenes of Highwaymen and Prostitutes who all remain unpunish'd and triumphant in their Crimes He concluded with paying the Dean the Compliment of intreating him to correct the Work  The Dean said he did not care to be troubled with it and bid Mr  Pilking∣ton  take it to  London  and look it over at his Leisure which accordingly he did  He was scarce gone when the Dean came to me for the Bag I told him my Husband had according to his Com∣mands taken it with him He protested he never gave him any such Permission  that I was impudent to say it and my Husband more so to do it the Conclu∣sion of which was that he ordered me to write to him to return it immedi∣ately and least I should forget it he gave me a very good Beating Well I writ Mr  Pilkington  an Account of the Dean's Wrath and he sent me the fatal Bag by a Clergyman I directly carried it to the Dean and hoped he would be pleased by my punctual and ready Obedience to his Will but far otherwise it fell out for the Dean flew into a Pas∣sion for my daring to presume to write for it and gave me another Beating  But did not this more resemble the Actions of a Lunatick than of a Gentle∣man of superior Wit and Knowledge Indeed I believe too much Learning had turn'd his Head or too deep a Search into the Secrets of Nature as nothing could escape his Observation And this wrong Turn in his Brain I fancy had possessed him a long time be∣fore it was taken notice of as number∣less Proofs might be produced and even  amongst the Facts that I have related there are some strong Instances of it had he been less witty it would sooner have been taken notice of but as the Poet observes  Great Wit to Madness sure is near allied  And thin Partitions do their Bounds di∣vide  The first Proof he gave of his Incivility was affronting the Lord Lieutenant at the Lord Mayor's Table who because he had not paid his Compliments to him in due Form he very civilly accosted by the extraordinary Title of you Fellow with the blue String Some little time after this he invited two Clergymen to take the Air with him and when he got them into a Coach he did so belabour them and knock their Heads together that they were obliged to cry out for Assistance  From this he fell into a deep Melan∣cholly and knew no body I was told the last sensible Words he uttered were on this Occasion Mr  Handel  when  about to quit  Ireland  went to take his leave of him The Servant was a con∣siderable Time e'er he could make the Dean understand him which when he did he cry'd  "O A  German  and a Genius A Prodigy admit him"  The Servant did so just to let Mr  Han∣del  behold the Ruins of the greatest Wit that ever liv'd along the Tide of Time where all at length are lost  If ought else relating to him should occur to my Remembrance I will faith∣fully relate it as I am certain it cannot but be acceptable to the Public whose Interest he had evermore at Heart and whose Liberties on all Occasions he warm∣ly and nobly asserted  'Tis mine O honoured Shade to cele∣brate thy Goodness without extenuating thy Faults I deal impartially which is the true Task of an Historian and I would inscribe thy TombStone were I permitted but without Characters Fame lives long Thine will last while Wit or Genius are admired in this sublunary Globe  However disagreeable it may be to me I find I must prosecute my own History till my leaving  London  to which Metro∣polis I never intend to return as has been insinuated in order to hurt my Subscrip∣tion While ever I can find Means of subsisting in my native Country where I have received more Favour than I could reasonably hope for I should esteem my∣self not only ungrateful but unjust to raise Contributions on the Public and carry the Money from this poor Island to spend it in a rich and opulent City  Besides my Days of Vanity are over The Woods Groves Fountains sacred Recesses dear to the Muses would be my Choice even had I a Fortune to entitle me to enjoy the Splendor of a Court in its utmost Magnificence O how I languish for Retirement even as the Heart pant∣eth after the Water Brooks so longeth my Soul after it where I might sit upon sunless Side of some Romantic Moun∣tain Forest crown'd I wish my best and dearest Friend would take this into Con∣sideration and in some Part of his wide  extended Domains afford his Muse an humble Hermitage  I should not then be distracted with Fears of an imperious Landlord's Threats No your happy Tenant would pay her Debt in Weeds which when I once told your Lordship you very politely answered that such Verses as mine were the finest Flowers in the Garden of the Muses  I must here relate to your Lordship a little Circumstance which happened to me lately I took a Lodging in  Drum∣condralane  the two Ladies Sisters who keep the House kindly invited me to Dinner it was very natural for me to enquire what Persons of Distinction lived in our Neighbourhood they told me Lord  Kingsborough  had lately purchased a House in it a most worthy fine Gen∣tleman I happened to express so much Pleasure at hearing this agreeable piece of News and at the same time so warm∣ly joined in their Sentiments that one of the Ladies said Well Madam though you have made a Mystery of your Name  I am certain you are Mrs  Pilkington  I am sure you are the Person because you speak of his Lordship in the very same Stile you have wrote of him I have the two Volumes  As I found they were prepossessed in Mrs  Pilkington  's Favour I confess'd they had guess'd right But whenever I want Concealment if your Lordship is men∣tioned I will take Care to be silent Otherwise I shall soon betray myself as out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh Though I am afraid that like holy David it would be Grief and Pain to me and while I sat musing the Fire would kindle the Sacred Fire of Friendship and Gratitude would un∣lock my Tongue and give me Utterance even though I had been born dumb  Why my dear Lord were but a few Persons of Distinction in your Way of thinking Earth itself would become a Paradise no more would the sorrowful Sighing of the Prisoner nor the Voice of Lamentation be heard in our Streets and 'tis with infinite Pleasure I see our long  stain'd Nobility  who were only fa∣mous for undoing  and built their  Characters on Rapes and Ruin  now al∣most to a Man not only just but bene∣ficent not only learned themselves but Encouragers of Science in others If a∣mongst our Country's Worthies I name you Lord  Molesworth  who have distin∣guished yourself in Fields and Senates in the Seats of the Muses and Academic Groves whose well try'd Valour has ap∣proved itself not in Rashness but a noble Intrepidity and Scorn of Death whenever your God your King or Coun∣try requir'd your Service I hope it will not offend you to say may your God your King and Country make you as happy as my much obliged and most truly grateful Heart sincerely wishes shall ever be my ardent Prayer  Your Lordship has kindly visited the Virtues of my Father on his Daughter I am sure I had no other Claim to the Fa∣vours or Honours for which I am indebt∣ed to your Lordship and for which I rest your faithful Servant  At length through strange Vicissitudes and Variety of Misfortunes finding I could get no Relief from  Ireland  I de∣termined with my Son to revisit it and though late in Life try my Fortune in  Hibernia  But how to compass a Journey and a Voyage without Money was really a difficult Task to this End I set my Wits to Work to find out whether any Persons of my own Country were in  Lon∣don  from whom by revealing my Dis∣tress I could hope for Relief At length I learned that Dr  Delany  was there who never rejected the Petition of the af∣flicted even though they had no other Merit to recommend them but that of Anguish My Suit was granted in the most compassionate and obliging Manner accompanied by his Tears for my Mis∣fortunes and Prayers for the Preserva∣tion of my Soul and Body And sure the Oraisons of one so good must have uncommon Efficacy in them to turn the Sinner and confirm the Just in welldoing while his own Example strengthens all his Precepts  How different was the Reception I met with at the Hands of this worthy Man from the rough Return made to my Sollicitations for a Subscription from Lady **** who  "wondered at my  Impudence  in applying to her"  Ladies let me entreat you will drop that nasty paw Word  impudent  at least don't annex it to my Name who never yet had the Assurance to appear in any publick Place since I came last to this Kingdom nor ever to apply in Person for a Favour But a Woman who has suffered in Reputation knows not what to do 'tis all Impudence though her Betters have more for that in the Cap∣tain is but a Choleric Word which in the Soldier is flat Blasphemy  Upon my Word if instead of the Im∣pudence I am charged with you would call me a desolate afflicted Wretch you would speak the Truth for poor  Laetitia  is become the Football of Fortune but why should I complain when the Son of Man says that the Foxes had Holes and he himself had no Place to lay his Head  in Answer me some of ye great learned and pious Divines why is our Blessed Redeemer stiled the Son of Man When we are told that a Virgin should conceive that the Power of the highest should overshadow her How was he then the Son of Man We are all order∣ed to apply to our Heavenly Father and therefore may stile ourselves the Children of God why then is there any Excep∣tion made in this Case  I hardly dare allow myself the Liberty of thinking lest I should do it too deep∣ly and Reason be my Disease and yet I believe it was given me to follow and search after Truth where then shall I find it not on Earth no more than Peace or Justice who are long fled from these lower Regions Boldly then let me pursue them even to the high Place from whence they sprung the Seat of Calms and Ease the Mansions of the Blest where holy Hope and constant Faith shall be lost in Fruition of that Happiness which hath not yet entered into the Heart of Man to conceive  Mr  Woolaston  's Religion of Nature delineated shews us powerfully how much a Lye must offend the Creator as I am tax'd with numerous Quotations which are tedious as some of my Readers tell me I shall not borrow one from him but refer the Learned to his inimitable Work though I am persuaded no Per∣son who has not a clear Head can taste his Beauties And truly I have paid myself no small Compliment here but as it is written e'en let it pass  And here Mr  Blake  Ignatius Blake  Esq  permit me to tell you though no Person can more re∣vere your every amiable Quality than I do yet as the Objection you started to my Philosophic Doctrine of the Ocean's having no Bottom has deprived me of Rest ever since I could find in my Heart to be angry with you You asked me then how I could account for Islands which must have a Foundation I am not sure of that perhaps they float like  Delos  'Tis demonstrable that wherever we dig  deep we find Water not Salt indeed like that of the Sea but may it not be Purified by running through the Veins of the Earth and arise to us in fresh Foun∣tains mineral Streams or milky Currents such as  Mallow  affords Our Foundation we know is on the Waves our Build∣ing on the Great Deep This was so at the first Creation then when the Windows of Heaven were opened and the deep Abyss or Receptacle of Waters broke up what had we but the Ruins of a World to inhabit the Fragments of which may swim at least most worthy Sir I can find no better Solution for the Doubt you rais'd in my Mind pray con∣sider the Question yourself and if your Learning which I own is extensive be adequate to your Virtue you are better qualified to give me an Answer than most Men livingNow do I know I give your Modesty Pain but amongst other Instances of my  Impudence  I could not forbear this  And had I never honoured you for your own Goodness yet your Answer  when I asked you did you love Lord  Kingsborough    "Who knows him but must love him"  would have com∣manded my Respect and best Wishes and they both sincerely attend you And here my polite  Roman    John Brown  of the  Neal  Esq  then going to take his Trial  my Friend beloved by all but the malici∣ous and unworthy who persecute you for no other Cause but that you excel in Courage and Learning accept of my Thanks for the many fine Encomiums you have bestowed on me think of me as one incapable of pursuing the Advice you gave me of forsaking a Friend in the Hour of Calamity Sure 'tis then our Duty to administer Consolation as far as our Power extends the Fortunate want it not Your Magnanimity of Soul bears up against the Storms of Fortune and  Amidst the Noise of Chains and Keys  Thou can'st of  Cupid  sing  The Warders their hoarse Bawling cease  And Drawers watch thy String  But says my Reader what have I to say to your Philosophy or particular Attach∣ments proceed in your Story inform us how you got to  Ireland  Well now you have reminded me of it I think I will To confess the Truth I had like to have forgotten myself my Thoughts are apt to wander through Eternity and  Like  Pompey  's transported to Regions of Day  Disdain to be ty'd to a Mansion of Clay  After receiving the worthy Doctor  Dela∣ny  's Bounty which was sufficient to pay every Debt I ow'd in  London  which as I was cautious in contracting any a Sum though less would have paid But I had not a Sufficiency to answer the Expence of travelling Charges for two Persons The Parliament was dissolved the Nobi∣lity gone to enjoy the Sweets of Spring  April  having deck'd all Things in fresh and fragrant Bloom all but wretched Humankind from whom whence part∣ed it no more returns to blush or beau∣tify  the Cheek again But let us not Sor∣row after that as those who have no Hope beyond this Life if we can go unstain'd through this World which 'tis almost impossible to do or seeing the Er∣rors of our Ways forsake them we have Assurance given us of a joyful and tri∣umphant Resurrection  Mark with what Hope upon the sur∣row'd Plain  The chearful Plowman casts the pregnant Grain  There hid as in a Grave a while it lies  Till the revolving Season bids it rise  Till Nature's genial Power command a Birth  And potent call it from the teeming Earth  Then large Encrease the buried Treasure yields  And with full Harvest crowns the plen∣teous Fields  I wrote in order to gain Relief to a Prelate of  Ireland  then resident in  Lon∣don    I sent the Letter by the Daughter of a dissenting Clergyman of whose Ho∣nour and Virtue I was confident He re∣ceived her civilly read over my Letter and declared he did not know me but as he had some slight Knowledge of my Fa∣mily there was a Guinea for me This answered no End But yet he gave me some Comfort by bidding her call again and he would think of something for my Service Accordingly in a Week's Time she went again and again till at length his Lordship vouchsafed to send out a very rough Answer not in the least befitting his Function or Dignity espe∣cially to one whom he knew from her Infancy to be a Woman of good Birth and Education  But I resolving to be as chuffy as he sent him in reality another Epistle not overcourteous I own yet it wrought a better Effect than my complaining one produced for his Gentleman came to me early next Morning with a very civil Letter and produced ten Guineas to my unspeakable Joy but there was a Draw∣back  on my Happiness for I was obli∣ged to return ten Shillings Change which I very reluctantly complied with  With this Sum my Son and I quitted  London  and being on the saving Scheme took Places in the Waggon A most tire∣some Way of travelling  May  Morning we set forth our Slowpac'd Cattle were adorned with Ribbands and Flowers and till then I never understood the meaning of the vulgar Expression of being as fine as a Horse for it seems it is customary on this Month to present the Waggoners with a Ribband at every Inn till our Fleabitten Nags were almost blind∣ed by the tawdry partycoloured flow∣ing Honours of their Heads I was really almost fatigued to Death for I was called up at three o'Clock in the Morn∣ing though perhaps you don't set out till five Tea or Coffee none to be had unless in some of the Towns Indeed if I could like our Driver have eat a Breakfast of Salt Beef and Cabbage at that squeamish Hour it was laid there ready They bait not all Day so one  might have an Appetite by Evening but it happened not so to me The Heat and Dust quite depriv'd me of any Inclina∣tion to Food and especially to the rough Fare provided  My chief Delight was listening to the Nightingale who then warbled forth her lovelaboured Song to indulge the Pleasure of hearing the soft Warbler pour forth her plaintive and harmonious Lay I used when we were near our resting Place to alight and walk through the flowerenamell'd Meads filled with Cowslips Primroses and wild Violets for  In rural Scenes the Soul of Beauty reigns  The Soul of Pleasure lives in rural Scenes  POPE  My Son and I found out a sweet Place canopy'd with Woodbine which had enringed itself in Plats about a large Ap∣ple Tree whose Blossoms shed Perfumes while the whole Season warbled round our  Heads we seated ourselves under the wide spreading Shade listening with De∣light to those wild Musicians Suddenly the Boy cry'd out O Mamma what shall I do What is the Matter Child Look at my Leg I did so and behold a Snake had twisted up it I though heartily startled had Presence of Mind sufficient to beg he would not strike it he took my Advice though indeed both he and I were ready to faint and the evil Worm crawled away without doing him any Prejudice But not being well assured that all the Serpent Race sworn Foe to Man might be so complaisant I was never after tempted to sit down in Albion's fruitful Fields  We lodged this Night at a strange old Village whose Name I have forgot I believe the Inn had formerly been a Con∣vent by the numerous little Cells and Cloysters small Windows almost dar∣kened with Jessamine and Vines it had a most romantic melancholy Air fit for studious Contemplation but not reple∣nished with rich Repast or chearful  Wine The next Day being Sunday a Day of Rest we took up our Quarters at another Inn where we got a Chicken and a Pint of Wine and lived sumptu∣ously  We then walk'd out to see what kind of Curiosity this Place afforded worth Remark but finding none we strayed out on a Common when the first Object which struck my Sight was that of a Man suspended high in the Air hanging in Chains on a Gibbet shocking as it was it engaged my Attention I concluded he must have been a most undutiful Son when the Birds of Prey had devoured him and the Ravens picked out his Eyes Suddenly I was surprized with the Voice of a Man who cried O my dear Coshen Paddy I wish those who put you there for noting were there themselves I look∣ed about and saw fifteen or twenty Men and Women lying in a dry Ditch I would have fled but considering that might not be safe I rather chose to walk at an easy Pace One of the Fellows made up to us and asked where we were  going I told him to our Country  Ire∣land  Arah said he are you a Catolic I said I was Upon I which he said Faith poor Paddy  Lawler  who hangs there was a good one And what Sir brought him to so unfortunate an End Why said he he was in Love with a proud scornful Hussey and she slighted him so he met her in this Plaish and because she would not accept of his Shivility he lent her a Nock on the Head and so he got his Will of her She died the next Day after she had given Information against him to be sure her Skull was broke but he did not deshine that  While he was telling me this Story I trembled but made the best Speed I could to the Village being infinitely more frightened at him than I had been at the Snake He accompanied us there for which I return∣ed him Thanks how sincerely my Readers may judge But I made a Virtue of Ne∣cessity and gave him fair Words Now said he are not all these Heretics damn'd Rogues Ay said I and I hope our  true King will put all Villains to Death Arrah give me your Fist for that I was obliged to comply When I got to the Inn I told him I should be glad of his Company but that I had a jealous Hus∣band who would certainly kill me if he found any Man in my Company Damn the Rogue said he if I was as you I would make him a Cuckold in a crack I desired he would please to accept of a Pot of Drink which he did and making a Leg walk'd off leaving us unmolest∣ed and I blest God I had purchased Life at so cheap a Rate  That soft Answers turn away Wrath is most assured for I remember some Years ago when the  Cavan  Rabble were up in Arms my Mother Sister and I went to pay a Visit at  Rathfarnam  to the Lady of our excellent  Eaton Stannard  Esq  who resigned  Recorder On our return home we were surrounded by a Pack of these Wretches who ordered my Father's Coachman to pull off his Hat to them which he refusing and they be∣ing  all armed with short thick Oak Tree Clubs they swore we should not ride in a Coach and they walk my Mother with surprizing Presence of Mind said Gentlemen you are very welcome to the Coach my Daughter and I will walk to oblige you with it which Villains Ruf∣fians and Murtherers as they were they would not permit but only desired we might Huzza for them this notwith∣standing our Terror we chearfully did and my Mother said Gentlemen per∣haps you are dry and gave them a Crown with which they were so well pleased that they huzza'd for us offering to guard us safe to Town but she alledging that would be too much trouble they left us with a kind Assurance that they would drink our Healths and fight for us any Time we stood in need of their Pro∣tection  Nothing material happened to us till we got to  Chester  we took a Survey of the Cathedral Church which had nothing like Beauty to recommend it any more  than the old black Walls which environ Part of the City  Next Day we set out for  Parkgate  which was crowded with Nobility and Gentry waiting for a fair Wind here we were so long detained that my Purse was quite exhausted even my last Shilling gone this was a sad Situation we were fixed to a Point without any Power of Moving one way or another wanting the necessary Agent Money There was but one Way left which was even to apply to Lady  Kildare  who was there but being ashamed to do it in my Name I e'en did it in my Son's who waited on her Ladyship with it met a favourable Reception and brought home a Guinea The Wind sprung up fair and we embar∣ked on board the Race Horse As I am always deadly Sick at Sea I chose to keep on Deck as long as I possibly could My Son being well inured to the wat'ry Ele∣ment skipped about and sung Marine Songs Most of the Passengers went to their Cabbins when Mr  Hudson  the Clergyman seeing my Boy speak to me  asked me was not that young Lad's Name  Pilkington  I said Yes I thought so said he for he is very like Mr  Pilking∣ton  the Clergyman he has some Cause to be so Sir for he is his Son How can you answer for that Madam Why in∣deed Sir I have some Cause of Knowledge of it for I am that worthy Divine's Wife and the Boy's Mother The Gentleman confessed the Force of my Plea and ex∣pressed great Compassion for us both and I do verily believe had he known our Circumstances he would have added Re∣lief to Pity  He seemed to be a learned and worthy Gentleman which I had the better Op∣portunity of discovering as he my Son myself and a Gentleman whom I did not know sat all Night in Lady  Kildare  's Coach which was lash'd upon Deck We there were becalm'd and amongst other things Mr  Hudson  said that had he ever been so unfortunate to take a common Woman and she had brought forth a Son so like him as mine was to  my Husband he would at least have con∣cluded that to be his own  Upon which I related to him a true Story A Servant Maid who had lived with Mr  Pilkington  in  Ireland  enquired of the Persons who kept the next House who were the new Lodgers they had got the Name made her but more inquisitive and she begg'd I would permit her to see me but as I had met with many a Trick in Life I bid my Son and Daughter sit behind the Bed Curtain and then desir'd her to come up I asked her did she know me she said no indeed but she had lived with one Mr  Pilkington  in  Ireland  who had turn'd his Wife out of Doors and that he lived on  Lazer  's  Hill  And what said I were the Names of the Chil∣dren Why returned she there was Master  Billy  Miss  Betty  and Master  Jack  And how came you to leave him Why indeed he was beating Miss and Master sadly and I asked him why he did it he said because they were none of his  Oh Sir said I sure Master Jack is yours for he is your own Picture Ay said he the Mother was thinking of me when he was got In troth Sir said she I don't doubt that for I believe you were the nearest Person to her for which Offence she was directly dismissed And could he have found Matter against her Life he would have prosecuted her  The Children knew her and whatever little Favours she had by Stealth done for them in my Exile I did my utmost to re∣turn to her A Benefit is seldom lost  At length the Day broke and dis∣covered us my native Earth I hail'd the Mother Land which gave me Birth but knowing how little Money I had did not chuse to Land at  Dunlary  which must be attended with more Expence than I had any Possibility of answering The other Passengers all went ashore 'twas about three o'Clock and my Boy and I waited in the Ship not doubting but we should be soon at  Ringsend  but it happened  otherwise for we were becalm'd we once more took our Seats in the Coach and found there the Hammer Cloth in which I wrapt myself and fell fast asleep In the Night I was awaked by the terrible Curses of the Captain of the Ship who swore dreadfully we should be that Mo∣ment lost I dropt the Glass and asked him what was the Matter he said he had fallen asleep and trusted the Ship to one who had directly thrown us on the  North Bull  And are we then to be lost I see no Remedy we shall strike in a Minut  I pulled my Son who laughed at my Fears which really were very great The Ship struck upon a SandBank with such Force that it rebounded on another and beat it almost to Pieces However the Morn arose that gilded all the flowery Plains and presented to our View a most agreeable Prospect both of Land and Water the Tide left our Ship on the Strand so that without Expence or Dif∣ficulty we walked to  Ringsend  Here we took a little decent Lodging till I could be able to remove to  Dublin    and I immediately dispatched my Son with a Letter to a Nobleman whom I had formerly seen at my Father's who obligingly sent me a Guinea This en∣abled me to dismiss my Lodging my Son brought me a Coach in which we put our Portmanteau and remov'd to an Apartment he had taken for me at a small Rent in  Aungierstreet  Well Reader I have now brought you with me to  Hibernia  where you will suppose the Daughter of a Gentleman so universally esteemed as Doctor  Van Lewin  would after so long an Exile have sure∣ly found some Friends  I wrote a very mannerly Epistle to my beloved Spouse in which I slightly men∣tioned his merciless Treatment of me and his poor Children and told him that if he would pay me the Sixty five Pounds for which I had his Bond in Counsellor  Smith  's Hands I would not only forego the Interest which amounted to a considerable Sum but also immedi∣ately leave the Kingdom provided also he would give me Assurance that he  would take Care of his youngest Son I leave every Person of Candour to judge whether or not this was a fair Proposal And I most solemnly protest to Almighty God that I had no other intention as there was not at that Time above forty Pages of my First Volume wrote how∣ever he scorned to send me an Answer of any kind Well I wrote again yet still his Reverence was silent as the Grave  This I confess a little incensed me and first determined me in the Design of publickly vindicating my Innocence and laying open for universal Benefit his unparallel'd Character in which if I have err'd 'tis through Tenderness as his Actions  Call Virtue Hypocrite  Pluck the fair Rose from a young inno∣cent Love  And plant a Blister there  SHAKESPEAR  I wrote to Counsellor  Smith  and told him how Mr  Pilkington  had treated me  and withal informed him that if he had too much Lenity to sue him for my law∣ful Right I insisted on his delivering me the Bond that I might put it in Force for the Relief of myself and my Child  The Counsellor was at a Loss how to act in so critical a Point He knew Mr  Pilkington  's Talent of traducing every Person who did not act in Compliance to his Inclination and on the other Hand Justice compell'd him to think I had a Right to be paid what had so long and so unlawfully been withheld from me and by which I was drove to such Extremi∣ties in  London  He therefore wrote to him and I sup∣pose acquainted him how much it was out of his Power as an honest Man to defend him from the Consequences of that Bond Mr  Pilkington  finding all his Policy of no Effect in this particular Af∣fair condescended to honour the Coun∣sellor with a most stupid Epistle in which he insinuated  "that his Motive for giv∣ing that Bond was in order to make me live virtuously for the future which  he could sufficiently prove I had not done"  Produce your Evidence Mr Parson  "That if he was allow'd only such Time to pay it as his Circum∣stances would not allow he would try what Remedy he could obtain from a Court of Equity when a full State of the Case was laid before them"  These are pretty near the Words I wish you had my dear Spouse as it must have gi∣ven Pleasure to any Court to see you look CONSCIENCE in the Face  But not to be tedious after much Trou∣ble and Vexation of Spirit I procured from him twenty Pounds at one Payment with which I took a little rural Habitation near  BowBridge  I wrote a Letter to my dear old Friend Mr  Cibber  and told him that however improbable it might seem to him I had actually Twenty Pounds in my Pocket and added that I had  A little Room to lodge a Friend  A River at my Garden's End  and wanted nothing but the Delights of his Conversation to make my Situation com∣pleatly agreeable I believe Mr  Cibber  had not till then heard of my Expedition so that my Letter must have surpriz'd him By the return of the Post I re∣ceived from his dear Hand the following humorous Epistle  To Mrs  Laetitia Pilkington  c  THOU frolicksome Farce of For∣tune What is there then ano∣ther Act to come of you yet I thought you had some Time ago made your final Exit Well but without Wit or Com∣pliment I am glad to hear you are so tolerably alive I have your agreeable Narrative from  Dublin  before me and shall as you desire answer every Para∣graph in its Turn without once consider∣ing its Importance or Connection In the first Place you say I have for many Years been the kind Preserver of your Life In this I think I have no great Merit as you seemed to set so little Va∣lue on it yourself otherwise you would  have considered that Poverty was the most helpless Handmaid that ever wait∣ed on a high spirited Lady You seem to have a Glimpse of a new World before you think a little how you are to squeeze through the Crowd with such a Bundle at your Back and do not suppose it pos∣sible you can have a Grain of Wit till you have twenty Pounds clear in your Pocket with half that Sum a greater Sinner than you may look the Devil in the Face  Few People of Sense will turn their Backs on a Woman of Wit that does not look as if she came to borrow Money of them but when Want brings her to her Wit's End every Fool will have Wit enough to avoid her  I am not sure your Spouse's having ta∣ken another Wife before you came over might not have proved the only Means of his becoming a better Husband to you for had he pick'd up a Fortune the Hush of your Prior Claim to him might have been worth a better separate  Maintenance than what you are now like∣ly to get out of him  As to my Health and Spirits they are as usual and full as strong as any body's that has enjoy'd them the same Number of Years  If the Value I have for you gives you any Credit in your own Country pray stretch it as far as you think it can be ser∣viceable to you for under all the Rubbish of your Misfortunes I could see your Merit sparkle like a lost Jewel I have no greater Pleasure than in placing my Esteem on those who can feel and value it Had you been born to a large For∣tune your shining Qualities might have put half the rest of your Sex out of Coun∣tenance If any of them are uncharitable enough to call this Flattery tell them what a poor Devil you are and let that silence them  I hope you have but one Volume of your Works in the Press because if it meets with any Success I believe I could give you some natural Hints which in  the easy Dress of your Pen might a good deal enliven it  You pay your Court very ill to me by depreciating the natural Blessings on your Side the Water Pray what have we to boast off that you want but Wealth and insolent Dominion Are not the Glory of God's Creation thereWoman lovely Woman there in their highest Lustre I have seen several and frequent Samples of them here and have heard of many not only from yourself but others who for the agreeable Enter∣tainments of social Life have not their equal PlayFellows in  Old England  And pray what would Life be worth without them Dear soft Souls for now too they are lavish of Favours which in my Youth they would have trembled to trust me with In a Word if instead of the Sea I had only the dry Ground  Alps  to get over I should think it but a Trip to  Dublin  in the mean time we must even compound for such Interviews as the Post or Packet can bring or send to  Your real Friend and Servant  C Cibber  I communicated this Letter to Lord Chief Baron  Bowes  the Hon  Arthur Hill  Esq  and several Persons of Taste who were infinitely delighted with it as they were with many others which I had from Mr  Cibber  and which would con∣siderably have embelished my Work had I not the Misfortune to lose them by lending them to a Man of Distinction who by some Accident mislaid them so I must e'en entertain you with the neat Product of my own Brain  Mr  Victor  whom I have mentioned in my Second Volume and who is now Treasurer of the Theatre Royal in  SmockAlley  came to visit me several Times and frequently favoured us with an Order to see the Play as we were upon a very friendly and familiar Footing My Son used when he had an Inclination to call on my Friend for a Pass one Night he sent once or twice for that Purpose when the Gentleman was abroad What does the giddy Creature do but aukwardly counterfeits his Hand in an Order for two He told me of it and said he was  sure Mr  Victor  would not deny it when he was informed who had taken that Free∣dom with his Name I laugh'd at the Reflection of the Jest when it came to be known as Mr  Victor  had had the Boy in his Arms when an Infant Ac∣cordingly we took a Coach went to the Play and the Forgery seem'd to pass ex∣tremely well The first Act was scarce begun when a Person entered and as the House was thin of Company tapt my Son on the Shoulder I did not apprehend the Cause of it but began to grow uneasy when I found him stay a full Hour at length he returned and informed me that he had been at the Instigation of Mr  Shn  arrested by two Constables from whom he was only delivered by the Sollicitations of Mr  Victor  This greatly astonished me as I thought Mr  Shn  ought to have had a little more Respect for the Son of a Clergyman especially as he was well convinced that as I knew his Father whom  the Dean  entertained more as a Buffoon than a Friend or Com∣panion and his Mother I had a Power  of furnishing the World with some Anec∣dotes which were hitherto unrevealed but the Scheme of letting my Son escape was not any Lenity in him but a Bait to catch me going out whom they imagined they should discover by the Boy but it happened that a Gentleman handed me me out by which this generous Intent was frustrated  His little deformed Brother had the Assurance to tell my Son some Nights after that Mr  Sn  would esteem any Satire I wrote on him a Panegyrick which when I heard in order to oblige him with a Compliment to his Taste I inclos'd to Mr  Victor  the following Lines to be forwarded to his Mightiness  To Mr Sn  FAIN would the Muse record thy Crimes  And leave them to succeeding Times  But finds it difficult to trace  The Vices of thy motly Race  Whether thy Insolence and Pride  Spring from thy Sl Father's Side  That Pedant who with Rod in Hand  Could in his paultry School command  And underneath his cruel Yoke  Many a generous Spirit broke  Who else were form'd in Camps to shine  Or grace the Noble Patriot Line  Or didst thou from thy Dam inherit  Thy fordid avaricious Spirit  Of whom I heard old SWIFT declare  So many Vices were her Share  That were her Sex created all  Pure as the first before the Fall  And but her Crimes thro' all distributed  The best would merit to be gibbeted  Thy Father he applauded next  Studying a Wench more than a Text  Who having got of Money store  Lavishing all upon a Whore  Was sent to Hell his latest Journey  By her base Brother an Attorney  Such be thy Fate thou Wretch accurs'd  Or else with Spleen and Envy burst  Or with thine Uncle brave  M'Faddin  Whose Infamy thy Soul is clad in  To free the suffering Stage and Nation  Be doom'd like him to Transportation  But who thy Destiny can alter  Thy very Looks presage a Halter  Oh may I live to hail the Day  When the glad Players shall survey  Their Tyrant stript of all Command  High on the well fixt Ladder stand  And taking thence one glorious Swing  How will they spout "God save the King"  Then shall those Cloaths in which disguise  You'd seem a Lord to vulgar Eyes  Did not thy base and abject Mien  Betray the Beggar's Brat within  Be by thy Kinsman Hangman worn  And still a Scoundrel Thief adorn  This Sir I most humbly beg your Ac∣ceptance of as 'tis indeed the only thing which I could without Dissimulation say of you  I was told that this worthy Gentleman in a Letter to the inimitable Mr  Garrick  said  "We shine like  Castor  and  Pollux  you adorn  Great Britain  while I illu∣minate  Hibernia  "  Nothing sure but his matchless Ignorance could have drawn so disproportionate a Parrallel I remem∣ber the first time I had the Pleasure of seeing Mr  Garrick  perform it was the Character of King  Lear  I was in one of the Boxes and when he came to the mad Scene I was so much affected at it that I got up insensibly and was going out till I was wak'd like one from a Trance by the Lady who accompanied me pull∣ing me by the Sleeve and demanding where I was going and to say the Truth  He made me Marble with too much conceiving  MILTON  I am certain no Person was ever capable of making the Audience feel a Part which they did not sincerely do themselves and I'm convinced Mr  Garrick  never play'd a Part wherein he did not through the whole Performance believe himself the Man whereas  Pollux  as  Shn  modestly stiles himself is no other than Tom  Shn  though he change Dress and Perriwig twenty Times a Night he is indeed  Semper Eadem worse  and  worse  as my Countryman has it  This brings to my Memory a Story of a very eminent Player who was to perform the Part of  Hannibal  A Nobleman behind the Scenes took the Liberty to give a Twitch to one Tye of his Peruke The enraged Hero turned on his Heel and with his martial Trun∣cheon smote the Peer over the Cheek  A Blow by Heaven and from an Actor's Hand  He did not stab him for that were poor Revenge  But when he came off the Stage my Lord told him he believed he thought himself really  Hannibal  when he could give with Impunity such an Indignity to a Man of his Consequence My Lord said the Player if I did not think myself  Hannibal  I should never be able to make  the Audience do soSo much for Theatrical Affairs  I now began seriously to resolve on Publishing my Writings and to that End had Proposals printed Persons were at first a little timorous lest I should print a List of Subscribers and by that Means they might unwittingly give Of∣fence but when I declared no Names should be inserted I had a numerous Contribution from all the Nobility Cler∣gy and Gentry amongst whom when I name our excellent  Lord Chancellor  in whom Titles and Honours had made no Alteration but that of increasing his Politeness Munificence and Liberali∣ty to every Individual our Patriot  Speaker  and worthy Recorder  Eaton Stannard  Esq  I believe no Person of Distinction will blush to have their Names mentioned  Well at length my first Volume was finished and I wrote a bantering Letter to Sir  Jn Fke  to whom I have the Dishonour to be allied to tell him that I intended to dedicate it to him  Nemine Con  He whose Mind is truly pictured in his illfavoured Face told my Son that for himself every Body would take it as a thing done to make him ridi∣culous since he had not any Accomplish∣ments that might merit an Encomium which indeed was true except 'tis his matchless Impudence in keeping Pos∣session of an Estate which his own Mo∣ther the Lady told him he had no more Right to than to the Dukedom of  Burgundy  When his supposed Father Sir  Bph Fke  died this young Spark was an Ensign in the Army and stepping at once into Affluence he being naturally of a covetous Disposition refused to pay his Mother the Jointure which she claim'd and was going to commence a Suit with her when one Morning she called on him and said Hark ye Sir  John  do you re∣solve to go to Law with me for what's my Right He begg'd to be excused but told her SelfPreservation was the first Law of Nature so it is Sir said she call∣ing him by his real Father's Name then  you are no longer Sir  Jn Fke  which I will go instantly and make pub∣lick  He fell dutifully on his Knees entreat∣ed her Pardon for his Disobedience and promis'd for the future to pay all proper Resignation to her superior Understand∣ingThis Sir  John  you and many others know to be Fact  He pointed out to me as a subject for everlasting Praise my beloved Lord  Kingsborough  then Sir  Robert King  and though I had not the Felicity I have since experienced of a personal Acquain∣tance with him yet the Character pleased me and accordingly I wrote a trifling Dedication far inferior to his Merit which notwithstanding he kindly accepted and sent me the following Letter  Madam  I Return you my Thanks for the Fa∣vour of your Dedication which tho' I am sensible is too high a Compliment yet my Vanity will not permit me to refuse I beg you will take the Trouble  to send your Servant to me tomorrow Morning and you'll oblige  Madam  Your devoted humble Servant R KING  I accordingly sent my Son who re∣turned with a Letter in which were in∣closed two Notes for ten Pounds each The Letter was only this  Madam  I Once more return you Thanks for the Favour you intend me and have the Honour to be  Madam  Your obliged humble Servant R KING  Yorkstreet  Tuesday Morning  An obliging and easy manner of con∣ferring the highest Favours is what few ev'n amongst the most Polite have been able to arrive at a Perfection which alone is given to adorn a  Marlborough  or a  Kingsborough  But alas how vain how fleeting were all the Joys I ever proposed to myself This Nobleman in whose Esteem I ima∣gined myself to be so deeply riveted that not Fortune Time or Fate could ever displace me was as I have since learn∣ed by the Insinuations of one  Clancy  an old blind Beggar whose Wants I had often supplied both in  London  and  Dublin  persuaded to believe that I had spoken disrespectfully of his Lordship and that my Son said he would print his Letters and sell them for Halspence apiece all which was most notoriously false However it had such an Effect that his Lordship came to me and giving me ten Guineas in a sort of com∣manding Tone desired me to give him his Letters I burst into Tears and told him I would resign them or even any thing if possibly dearer to his Pleasure I went to my Drawer took as many as I could find and delivered them as I would  The ruddy Drops that visit my sad Heart  He took them abruptly and depart∣ing told me he would send in the Morning for the Remainder of them he left me in a Condition which I am utterly incapable of describing A Cir∣cumstance so unlook'd for sunk me into a Train of the most gloomy Reflections which might have been attended with fatal Consequences had not the Entrance of some agreeable Company dissipated my present Reflections  The next Morning before I was up a Chairman came and knock'd at the the Door the Servant asked who he wanted He said he came from Lord  Kingsborough  and must see Mrs  Pil∣kington  herself he told him I was not up but he swore and stormed saying he would not leave the Place till he had his Lord's Letters from me I happened to overhear him and desired the Maid to tell the Chairman I would send to his Lordship presently I accord∣ing arose and piqued at the Usage I had received from the Fellow I must confess with Shame I wrote a little  warmly on the Subject to my Lord and without allowing myself time for Thought dispatched it off  For I bear Anger as the Flint bears Fire  Which much enforced shews a hasty Spark  And strait is cool again  SHAKESPEAR  The fatal Epistle had scarce left my Hand e'er my Heart was agitated with the most sensible Remorse I in vain dispatched a Messenger after the first  'Twas past 'twas gone 'twas irreco∣verable  It reach'd his Hands and he only sent for Answer "'Tis very well"  I believe the judicious Part of my Readers must have apprehended that the Sin of Ingratitude is not amongst the Number of mine since I have endeavour∣ed through my Work if possible to make the contrary conspicuous by ren∣dering  due Praise to all my Benefactors Yet what could my beloved Lord ima∣gine but that he had bestow'd all his Fa∣vours on an unworthy Person  I did not believe that after all the An∣guish of Mind I had sustained through my Life any thing could move my Phi∣losophy which had made me determine never to be overjoyed or surprized at any Advancement in Life nor deject∣ed or cast down at any Adversity on this Side Futurity so much as this  Downy Repose was a Stranger to my Pillow and I fell a Prey to the greatest Languor and Heaviness of Soul How∣ever as I knew his Lordship was filled with the Milk of human Pity I ima∣gined by apologizing for the rash Act I should be blest with his forgiveness and a Renewal of his Friendship to me to which End I wrote the following Lines  To the Right Hon the Lord  Kings∣borough  No more my Lord with Pleasure I expect  Your friendly Aid my Weakness to protect  Lost to those Transports you have oft inspired  And every Happiness my Soul desir'd  Oh where for Succour whither shall I fly  But buried in unheard of Sorrows die  The Soul of Pity dwells not in a Slave  But kind Compassion dignifies the brave  At  Darius  ' Woes great  Philip  's Warlike Son  Was mov'd when Conquests and when Toils were done  Each Godlike Hero has a tender Part  And Woes like mine wou'd melt a sa∣vage Heart  E'er long my Soul had no Desire in View  No Hope or Wish but that of pleasing you  One Smile from you could make a rich Amends  For shatter'd Fortune and the Loss of Friends  Esteem'd by you I could with Ease survey  My Name and Honour to the World a Prey  But now no more I'm ravish'd with that Voice  Whose sacred Sound bids Agony rejoice  The vernal Blooms no longer give me Ease  Nor painted Violets my Fancy please  Each Darling Object but elates my Grief  And Death's cold Hand can only give Relief  Yet when  Laetitia  shall exist no more  But Dust to Dust as she must short re∣store  Shed one kind Tear of Pity on her Hearse  Thou matchless Subject of her latest Verse  And let no Stone or Marble ever tell  What Woes her Children or herself be∣fel  But mix'd and cover'd with forgotten Clay  Time shall dissolve her Memory away  His Lordship sent me the following Answer which only added more Weight to my oppressed Soul  Madam  I Am extremely honoured by that Esteem and Friendship which you profess for me in your really fine Copy of Verses yet when I reflect on a late Letter of yours which I still have by me I cannot help thinking myself as un∣worthy of your Praises as I was of your Threats  I am Madam Your very humble Servant  I concluded from this Letter that I had lost all the Share in his Esteem that I once flattered myself I was possessed of which shews the Instability of human Af∣fairs  And here gentle Reader my Story and my Life draw to a Period I am con∣vinced from the present Situation of my Health that I shall never live to see this Volume published It is the only Legacy I have to leave my poor Boy who I fear  will meet with many Enemies on ac∣count of my Writings when it will be out of my Power to protect him But Oh ye Good and Great to you and the Almighty I commend him and hope that Tenderness which melted you to com∣passionate my Woes will incline you to assist him Believe me my dear Lord  Kingsborough  no Creature living holds your Lordship in higher Esteem than he and as you told me in one of your Letters your Inclinations were and En∣deavours should be to serve him let not the Memory of my Offence prevent your keeping that Promise sacred  APPENDIX  I Promised in my Proposals for print∣ing this Volume by Subscription to give the Readers a Key to the first second and third Volumes in this Place but having been advised by some judici∣ous Friends that such a thing would only tend to create ill Blood and excite a Re∣sentment too powerful to be withstood by so inconsiderable a Person as myself it has been thought expedient to furnish them with an Account of my Mother's Death which I am the more capable of doing as I remained with her to her last Moments  She had been a long time in a declin∣ing State of Health having an extreme bad Stomach and Digestion Nor did  she imagine that Nature could have held out as long as it did  She never seemed in the least uneasy at the Knowledge of her approaching End often declaring that if she could take me with her to Felicity she would leave this World without Reluctance  And indeed I am not surprized that her maternal Love extended so far as she even then foresaw the Calamities which I have since sustained and knew that if the World at her first setting out as a Writer with her extraordinary Ta∣lents scarce afforded her Bread my Fate must be even harder except I met the Patronage of some illustrious Per∣son  And Providence seemed inclinable to comply with her Wish for in the lat∣ter End of  June  I was seized with a most violent Pleuretic Fever which I got by an extreme Cold I sent for Doctor  Fergus  a most eminent Physician and worthy Gentleman my Mother was at this time so weak as to be obliged to keep her Bed When the Doctor saw me and  heard the Symptoms of my Disorder he told me I was a dead Man that I should have applied some Days sooner since he was now of Opinion it had got too far the Ascendency over me for any Cure to be effected However he ordered me to be blooded four times that Day and then went up to my Mother's Apartment  She asked him his Advice upon her own Case and mine and he told her a little too frankly that Nature might do something for my Recovery but that her Death was inevitable she smiling said to him That the Worms would have but a poor Feast of her she being quite worn away  Well I was blooded according to his Order and the Fever abated considerably I had the next Night an excessive Perspi∣ration which carried off all the Symp∣toms except a little Weakness  In the Morning a young Lady who honour'd me with a particular Regard came to see me She was so excessively delighted at my speedy and unexpected Recovery that she resolved to spend the  Day with me and my poor Mother ever willing to contribute to my Satisfac∣tion told the Nursekeeper that she found herself much better and desired she might be brought to my Apartment accord∣ingly she lifted my dear Mother like a Child in her Arms and placed her in an Elbowchair by my Bedside She affect∣ed in order to please me to be extremely chearful and the young Lady kneeled down and asked her Blessing telling her she wanted to have a Wedding in the House instead of a Burying from it My Mother who retained her Spirits and good Humour to the last gave us both her Blessing very devoutly and her sin∣cere Permission to marry I had a small Chicken dressed for my Dinner of which my Mother partook but her Stomach was too weak to keep it or a Glass of Wine which she drank after it so she was obliged to be carried to Bed  After her Departure as the Weather was vastly warm I ordered the Maid to open the Sashwindow and in the mean time comes the Doctor we were just  going to drink Tea This Gentleman is a little nearsighted but seeing the Sash up and Company in the Room What said he this poor Boy's gone I thought so And was going out No Sir said I I am still alive Alive said he And what are all these People doing here He immediately went and darkened the Win∣dow taking the Company by the Shoul∣ders and turning them out he then charged the Nursekeeper not to open the Window nor let any Person talk to me for a Week  I thought this Prescription a little hard as I imagined myself quite well Accordingly the next Morning I sent the Nurse out got up dressed my∣self and went to my poor Mother she was agreeably surprized to see me but upon opening the Curtains I found she had a great Cast in her Eyes which shocked me extremely and she told me that every thing appeared double to her I did not give her to understand that I perceived it but told her she looked better than I had known her do a long  Time She said the Doctor had given her over Why so he did me Madam and yet you see I am alive and if you will take my Prescription I dare say you will make a Fibber of him  She said she would and I proposed that my Spouse as I call'd Miss  Cm  and she and I should the next Morning go to  Chapel Izod  a Place about three Miles from Dublin and spend the Day She seemed quite pleased with my Re∣quest and sent to have a Landau bespoke for that Purpose  In the Morning she was up and dressed before me and was as sprightly as I had ever seen her tho' quite weak inso∣much that she was obliged to be carried into the Machine and out again  We set out before Breakfast and went thro' the  Phoenix  Park it was a fine Day and we had the Landau opened the fresh Air vastly revived her and she repeated a good many Lines of the Poem on  WindsorForest  she even complained of being hungry When we came to the Tavern I ordered some Tea and to  my infinite Surprize my Mother called for a Plate of Ham and some Oil and Vinegar eat very hearty and drank two Glasses of Whitewine  The Readers may judge that I was overjoyed at seeing so fair a Prospect of her Recovery she after made a Shift to walk down into the FlowerGarden and seemed to enjoy the balmy Fragrance with great inward Satisfaction I then went in and bespoke Dinner which was young Ducks and Green Pease my Mother lay down and slept 'till 'twas ready at which Hour she rose and eat very hearty There happened to be a Couple of Gentlemen in the House of our Ac∣quaintance who after Dinner joined Com∣pany with us and my Mother told them that the Doctor had given her over but shewas resolved to outlive the whole Faculty In short she related twenty agreeable Stories to our infinite En∣tertainment  Little did I imagine that our present Joy was only the Prologue to the Grief I too soon after received We did not leave  Chapel Izod  till Ten at Night  when we all set out in the Landau I know not whether the Air might not have been very fatal to her for no sooner were we got a hundred Yards but she began to cough and continued so all that Night during which I sat up with her  We lodged at this Time in the House of one  Sheil  in  PhraperLane Dublin  We had a first and second Floor for which we constantly paid Ten Shillings and Sixpence a Week the Man of the House had been a ParishClerk and had held that Dignity under my Father for some Years he afterwards turned Farrier or HorseDoctor in which meeting with no Success he came to  Dublin  took a House which he let to Lodgers except the Parlours and Kit∣chen and commenced a famous Quack I question whither the most eminent of that Profession in  London  which I take to be  Rk  ever tried more salutary Methods to destroy the human Species than this profound  Esculapius  had done nor with more Success whom we shall  hereafter distinguish by the Title of Doctor  Sheil  This Wretch who was ignorant be∣yond Conception was a Compound of Pragmatacism and Hypocrisy his Eyes were eternally bent to Heaven with the most solemn and austere Aspect while his Heart was perpetrating the Destruc∣tion of all who had the Misfortune to be thrown into his House  The first Instance which convinced me of it was this the light Guineas were now cried down so that People would scarcely accept them on any Account This Doctor was very particular every  Saturday  to call for his Money being the most avaricious Mortal I had seen It happened one Evening that we had no Money in the House but these Gui∣neas one of which was very remarkable and wanted Six Shillings This I gave him and allowed him the Deficiency In a few Days after every light Guinea which my Mother had she sold and took current Guineas for them She had exactly five Weight ones in her Purse  One Morning that I went out she left her Pocket hanging on a Chair as she was never suspicious of any one When I returned she was going to send me to pay some Cash when what should I see but the light Guinea I had some Days before given  Sheil  The Thing astonished me I asked if  Sheil  had been in the Room she said no nor any Person be∣sides Nurse this Nurse under the Rose was much addicted to Liquor I called her and examined her closely about the Matter she strenuously denied her know∣ing any thing of it at length by Threats and Entreaties she confessed that  Sheil  had given her Half a Pint of Rum to change them in her Pocket he assuring her it was the same Thing  I now besought my Mother's Permis∣sion to lay the old canting Rl in Newgate but she begged that I would let her die in Peace and not cause her last Moments to be disturbed with Contention she farther conjured me not to mention it till she was either dead or in some  other Lodging In Compliance to her Request I dropt the Affair  But notwithstanding her Desire of Quietness this Bloodhound for such alone I can stile him resolved to hasten her Exit for the next Day watching his Opportunity when I was out he came up and with an austere Countenance demanded three Weeks Rent which was that Day due to him she told him in a faint Voice that I was gone for Money and would pay him at my Return but he swore he would not be trifled with any longer and if she did not instantly pay him he would turn her into the Street  Imagine what a Shock this Behaviour must be to one in her feeble Condition she could make no Answer but burst into Tears Come Madam said the inhuman Cannibal these Arts won't pass on me give me either my Money or Value for it or by Gd you shall go out of this Lodging  She gave him the Keys of her Draw∣ers and desired him to take any Move∣ables  he thought proper for his Security and intreated for Christian Charity he would leave the Room as his Presence was baneful to her  This was all he aimed at so ve∣ry modestly helped himself to every Thing that was valuable and left the Room  I returned soon after and was greatly surprized to see my poor Mother trembling and pale so that she scarce seemed to live she faintly looked up at me and said my dear Child that Villain  Sheil  has been the Death of your Mother I knew I had not long to exist but sure it was cruel to stab at Half an Hour of my frail Life  I could scarce contain the various Pas∣sions rising in my Breast Love Pity Horror and Resentment reciprocally took Place and I should doubtless have gone and taken his Life but that filial Duty withheld me from adding to my dear Mother's Affliction  I prevailed on her to take a little mull'd Wine after which she went to Bed and I found on the Table these Lines which were the last she ever wrote  My Lord my Saviour and my God  I bow to thy correcting Rod  Nor will I murmur or complain  Tho' ev'ry Limb be fill'd with Pain  Tho' my weak Tongue its Aid denies  And Daylight wounds my wretched Eyes  I sat up with her all this Night during which she slept little for the heavy Cough on her Lungs but she retained her Senses so well that she entertained me with many Stories and repeated Part of a Poem written on Mrs  Waller  I believe Ma∣dam said I she's a Subscriber to you Yes said she she paid the Money to my Father I now found her Brain begin to grow defective which gave the most piercing Anguish to my Heart I had ever received  She doz'd a little about four o'Clock in the Morning and when she awoke  told me she had a mighty agreeable Dream which was that her Father came to her in a Mourning Coach and Six and told her he was very angry she had been so long ill and yet never sent for him whom she knew was always ready to assist her I am come continued he to bring you out of all your Troubles and with that took her in his Arms like a Child and carried her away in the Coach  My boding Heart readily interpreted this Dream as indeed did her own my Dear said she you know the Usage I have received from your Father together with the Knowledge I have that there are but few good Clergymen to be found have ever made me declare that I would permit none of them to visit me in my last Hours except dear Doctor  Delany  However since he is from Town and the World would add Impiety to all they have said of me if I don't have some one of them pray send for the Cu∣rate of this Parish I accordingly did and we all joined in Prayer after which she fell into a good deal of Discourse with  him and they drank a Glass of Wine to∣gether He asked her if she forgave my Father and she related the following Story to him  There was an honest  Irish  Papist on his Deathbed and when the Priest was going to give him Absolution he asked the sick Man If he freely forgave all his Enemies Otherwise he could not admi∣nister that Sacrament to him the Man replied Arah faith Father I do forgive every one only  Teddy Brenan  that poun∣ded my Cow Nay but said the Priest you must forgive him also or I cannot absolve you Well said he Father if I die I will forgive him but if I live I never can Will that do said the sick Man Arah faith said the Priest if it won't do it must do and accordingly proceeded  So Sir said she if I die I do forgive him and I wish the God whom he has offended may do the same but if I live mark you that Master Parson I never will  The Clergyman departed and in about an Hour's time came a great long Letter written I suppose at the Desire of Doctor  Sheil  by some of the enthusiastical Me∣thodists of which  Dublin  is now the chief Receptacle in his Majesty's Domi∣nions it was written in their whining Stile declaring that she my Mother was damned beyond Redemption that she was now on the Brink of Hell and that not the Blood of the Lamb could inter∣cept her  We both laughed at this fantastic Con∣trivance and she only wished for Strength to be able to answer it properly but alas that she never had  This Day she retained her Senses to∣lerably till Evening when she began to talk incoherently I sat up till Four in the Morning at which time I grew very heavy What said she can't you watch and pray a Moment till this bitter Cup passes from me a Moment and I shall be no more Come said she kneel down and take my Blessing and the last Adieu With a Heart rent in twain I complied  and she laid her Hand on my Head and said very devoutly the God of  Abra∣ham Isaac  and  Jacob  bless you the Father the Son and Holy Ghost pro∣tect and guard you and bring you safe to everlasting Peace where I go a little before you for surely my dear Child I believe through Christ I shall be happy hereafter  The Words made so deep an Impres∣sion on my Soul that I could not help repeating them and I do it more par∣ticularly because some People have been cruel enough to say she died an Atheist but surely ev'ry Person who examines her Writings will find that she was a sin∣cere Believer in the Doctrines of Christ∣ianity as taught by the Church of  Eng∣land  the perpetual Benefit of which I hope she now enjoys I remember in the Beginning of her Illness she called me to her and said I have a thing to request and you must by no means deny me but promise on your Life your Honour and your Soul to perform it I told her as I had not often disobeyed her she need  not be so particular in charging me 'tis this said she in a few Days you'll lose your poor little Mother and as you know I have no Money your Father un∣doubtedly will bury me and perhaps may propose putting my Remains in his Family Burial Place but if you suffer that you have my heavy Curse nay if it's possible I will come from the Grave to resent it Lay me by my dear Father and let our kindred Ashes mingle toge∣ther for were I put in the Ground with your Father  She and her Father are buried in  St Anne's  Church  Dawsonstreet  The Miracle of  Thebes  wou'd be re∣new'd  And the dividing Flames burn diffe∣rent Ways  These were her very Words Now said she if ever you grow rich erect a little square Marble Stone over me and let this Inscription be on it  Here lyeth near the Body of her ho∣noured Father  John Vanlewen  M D the Mortal Part of  Mrs  LAETITIA PILKINGTON  Whose Spirit hopes for that Peace thro' the infinite Merit of  CHRIST  which a cruel and merciless World never afforded her  I sincerely promised to obey her In∣junction But to returnBetween Five and Six her Breath grew short and her EyeSight failed her I went and em∣bracing her Hand which was now almost lifeless asked her if she knew me Yes said she you are my eldest Son come from the College for my Blessing you might have called before but God bless you It seemed as if her not being per∣mitted to see him disturbed her last Mo∣ments She then desired me to kneel down and pray by her which I did still keeping her Hand in mine I found it grow cold and heavy and looking up just saw her expire with a Sigh  I now beheld the most tender and en∣dearing Mother departed from me My only Prop and Succour gone While I saw myself ready to be exposed to all the Malice of Fortune I too well before ex∣perienced the obdurate Temper of my  Father to hope any Favour from him However summoning up all my Phi∣losophy and reposing my intire Confi∣dence in divine Providence I left that Scene of Sorrow and Lamentation and retired to take a little Repose  I had some few Days before this se∣cured all my Mother's Manuscripts in the Hands of a Friend which was very fortunate for me since the Moment old  Sheil  heard she was dead he ran into the DiningRoom and secured every Thing he could lay Hands on after which he went to inform my Father of the long wished and joyful News He could scarce credit it at first but when the pious Mr  Sheil  assured him on the Word of a Christian that he spoke Truth my Father with great Composure said it had been well for her to have died some Years ago old  Sheil  assured him that he believed she would not have died this Bout but for the Fright he gave her in her Sickness for which kind Office my Father could not but thank him  He gave immediate Orders for her Funeral which you may depend on it was not profuse he allowed her how∣ever a decent Oak Coffin and Shrowd and the Nursekeeper told me that  Sheil  was so unparalleled a Wretch that she could scarce keep him out of the Room while she stripped the Corpse which the Moment she had done and put her Shrowd on he came and took the Linen in which she died and secured that also  When I arose in the Morning the old Hypocrite asked me to Breakfast with him and endeavoured to comfort me by saying my Father was too good a Christian to let me want and that as the Cause of his Anger to me was now removed by the Death of my Mother the Effect would undoubtedly cease  I told him I expected nothing from him nor should I tho' infinitely di∣stressed make any Application to him that Nature instructed me to love and protect my Mother whose Cause my Duty prompted me to espouse of which  I could not be ashamed since I would do it were it to be done again  He said I ought to submit to my Fa∣ther and write to him and said he those Papers and Letters you have send them to him which will prove your Respect and I will engage to me∣diate Matters so well between you that he shall allow you Twenty Pounds a Year tho' he won't see you  As I am too apt to be credulous had any Person but this Man whom my Soul abhorred made such Overtures I should have thought there was something in it but if the Harmony of Angels proceeded from his Lips whom I looked on as the Murderer of my dear Mother it would to me be hateful as the Hissing of Serpents  However I listened to him and an∣swered that those Papers would certainly obtain Money for me and Promises were often broke that as to Twenty Pounds a Year my Father would as soon give Twenty of his Teeth but if the officious Mr  Sheil  would prevail  on my Father to give me Fifty Pounds I would not only resign them but would go to some Part of the World where he should never hear of me  The latter Part of this my Father would readily agree to nay have given me his Blessing at my Departure  but not a Word of the Nine and Forty Pieces  Indeed another  pious Divine  offered me a Sum of Money to go to  America  which because I did not consent to he has since utterly rejected me but a little Time will shew the World his Motives for that and open a very  unexpected Scene to the Publick  and tho' I have not kept my Promise to him in making the Affair known before now yet I take this Op∣portunity of informing his Reverence that I have not forgot him  In short the Doctor  Sheil  I mean went to my Father and told my Con∣ditions but he only laughed and said I had not my Mother's Genius and must quickly fall into Contempt there∣fore he very fairly set me at Defiance and should I dare to print any Thing  against him he had Interest enough to send me over the Water I am sorry for the disagreeable Necessity I am under of speaking or writing any Thing to displease him but Facts may be related I hope without Offence  The next Day Mr  Faulkner  inserted the following Paragraph in his Paper  Yesterday Morning died Mrs  Letitia Pilkington And the Author of  Pue's Oc∣currences  one of the worst Papers pub∣lished there I suppose by my Father's Direction inserted a very false and scan∣dalous Paragraph while Mr  Esdall  who is a Gentleman of known Worth and In∣tegrity published a genteel Encomium on her  A few Days after I wrote the following little Piece which as it was almost my first Attempt in Rhyme and on so par∣ticular a Subject I hope the Readers will pardon me for introducing it here  On the  DEATH  of my  BELOVED MOTHER  And shall no mournful elegiac Lay  Thy matchless Worth and Excellence dis∣play  From me at least 'tis but a poor Amends  Thou tenderest Mother and thou best of Friends  While from my Eyes the streaming Sorrows run  Accept this Tribute from thy darling Son  Who taught by thee in melting Num∣bers tells  What agonizing Pain his Bosom swells  What dreadful Anguish preys upon his Mind  That thou art fled and he remains be∣hind  Pleas'd if with you he might ascend the Sky  To the bright Regions of Felicity  But here no Joy no Comfort no De∣light  Can charm his Fancy or divert his Sight  Wilt thou from neverfading Bliss de∣scend  Me from the Storms of Fortune to de∣fend  Midst the rude Strokes of adverse Fate protect  Or in sweet Visions all my Ways direct  Alas too many Blessings wait on thee  To know one anxious tender Pang for me  Yet sure the pure celestial Joys above  Cannot extirpate thy maternal Love  Which with a Care Description that sur∣past  Defended me from each untimely Blast  Rais'd me to Knowledge in each polish'd Art  Refin'd my Manners and improv'd my Heart  Taught me from pleasing sacred Truths to know  The Source from whence perpetual Mer∣cies flow  Then to the Throne of neverdying Worth  Taught me to pour my Supplications forth  May that transcendant Pow'r which call'd you hence  Be still my Shield my Refuge and De∣fence  Till the grim Tyrant kindly ends my Pain  And we enraptur'd meet in Heav'n again  I never communicated these Lines to any one and now transcribe them only from my Memory  Since by writing this little Account I have obtained the Honour of speaking to the Public it gives me an Opportu∣nity of saying something in Favour of my∣self who I am convinced have been mis∣represented to them and for which I hope I shall be excused as Selfpreser∣vation is the first Law of Nature There are many Persons of some Note in Life who have on hearing me mentioned cried Oh horrid Dog shocking Fellow c Pray Gentlemen and Ladies for  what Where are my Accusers let them name the particular Crimes for which I deserve those Epithets or else not men∣tion me at all  My Lord  Stafford  I think is the only Instance which  English  History furnishes us with of a Person being condemn'd for accumulated Treason nay even he had a fair Hearing for his Life But these People are for condemning me unheard for no particular Fault only that such and such People say so and so  A Consciousness of this has made me resolve to write my own Life by which means only I shall have a Power of setting Things in a clear Light and of adjusting many present Ambiguities and though I confess the Public are bur∣thened with Things of this kind already many of which have no Tendency to re∣form the Manners of the Age but rather vitiate them yet I flatter myself among the Variety of real Incidents and whimsical Revolutions I have met with they may find as well Entertainment as Matter to moralize on  As I do by no means assume the Name of a Writer so the Public may be as∣sured I shall never attempt Satyr if my Betters have Faults that's no Affair of mine I am to pursue my own Story A Man who can't put up with a Tweak by the Nose and a Foot in the Rump is not fit to live in this fashionable World I therefore assure the Public before hand that I will be quite passive and tho' I name the Error not the Man by which man∣ner of Proceeding 'tis not improbable that by the time I am fourscore I may have an Annuity of forty Pounds a Year upon the Hopes of which I may reaso∣nably subsist and keep up my Spirits And in this I strictly follow the Advice of a certain great Man in  Ireland  whose Place of Abode is not remote from the  PhenixPark  and whose Acquirements have justly raised him from Obscurity to Opulence his extensive Plans in Build∣ing have excited an universal Admiration of his Taste in Architecture This worthy Person I applied to after the Death of my Mother and informed him that I  was possessed of some Letters which he had in her Lifetime been pleased to ho∣nour her with and that as her Papers would undoubtedly fall into the Hands of a Printer I thought proper lest the Publication of them might be offensive to him to give him this Information  He sent his Compliments by the Mes∣senger and desired to see me the next Morning I accordingly waited on him and tho' my Circumstances were not in the flow yet in order to convince him that I had no lucrative Motive in addres∣sing him I put the Letters under a Cover and sent them in before me  I was then introduced to his Presence he received me with the utmost good Manners desiring me to sit Young Man said he I have had a Letter from you lately concerning some Writings of mine to your Mother she was a Lady whom I regarded on account of her Fa∣ther and Family whom I well knew and therefore I corresponded with and assisted her my Letters you have here sent me and young Man I'll  keep them and will give you a Piece of Advice better than Gold if you'll follow it  There has been lately at my House his Gce the Pte ***** and several other Persons of the most eminent Stations in this Kingdom and discour∣sing of your Mother's Writings intro∣duced you and it was said that you had taken the Liberty to write to several great Men very much in the Stile of your Mother they imagined when she was dead they should have heard no more of the Matter but you seem'd to keep her Spirit alive Now young Man said he consider you are not a Woman from whom ev'n a Blow cannot hurt Ho∣nour We tollerated those Things in her which in you would be culpable in the highest degree in short if you have any Talents as I am told you have apply them to make Friends instead of troubling your Head about the Follies of Mankind find out their Virtues and make that your Theme Indeed Sir that said I will be a difficult Matter  In short Sir continued he if you do not apply your Genius according to the Will of your Superiors Care will be taken to send you out of the Kingdom before you are aware of it  I thanked him sincerely for his Admo∣nition which I determined from that Mo∣ment to establish as my Principle and on my Return thro' the Park upon ex∣amining the Affair found it more ratio∣nal to suppose that I should live by writ∣ing Panygeric than Satyr I resolved to try the Experiment and at the same time determined to bestow random Praise no matter to me tho' the Person I addressed was tainted with the most diabolical Vices I was to form the supposed Vir∣tues and Graces from my own copious Idea The first I exerted my Talent on was the  Son of a Bashaw  then resident in these  Dominions  and one whose  wise Interposition  in the  Ste  Matters of that  Kingdom  have made him so much the Darling of the  grateful  People and so far raised Envy on this Side the Wa∣ter that on his Return instead of Ac∣clamations  he is accosted with Sneers and Hisses whereever he appears while he conscious of his innate Worth sheds a contemptuous Smile on the sense∣less Idiots who are weak enough to cen∣sure his superior Abilities  I remembered to have heard him re∣ceive the Applause of the Senatehouse for telling Mr Sr that as the Sea∣son was far advanced and the Gentlemen desirous of returning to their Seats he thought it best to pge the Pt till  April  ensuing  This sublime Piece of Elocution was Matter enough for me who from my present System you'll allow was a pro∣fess'd Sycophant I accordingly wrote some Lines on the Occasion which were not of Consequence enough to subsist till this time therefore cannot be here re∣cited I waited on his Lp and put them into his Hand as he stept into his Chariot he received them and drove off the next Morning I waited at the same Place till he was going out and had the Honour of a gracious Smile  upon which I liv'd elegantly that Day The succeeding Morning I receiv'd What a familiar Nod Upon which I subsisted tollerably till five that After∣noon At that Time indeed some extra∣ordinary Emotion in my Stomach gave me to understand that Nods and Smiles though conferr'd by the Sons of Bashaws will not fill the Belly  The indifferent Success of my first En∣terprize made me almost determine never to attempt any Thing more in that Way though an Affair of like Nature which happened some Time before might if I had common Sense have been sufficient to deter me  As I was walking one Day pensive and pennyless through  Henrystreet  I saw some Footmen and Chairmen with White Gloves and Cockades and on en∣quiring the Occasion was told that Ld  Hth  was that Day married to Miss  Kg  I immediately ran to a CoffeeHouse call'd for Pen Ink and Paper and wrote a flaming Epithalamium which I as suddenly dispatch'd resolving to  have the Start of all  Grubstreet  His Ldship came out and told the Mes∣senger that when Mr  Pilkington  wrote better Verses he would send him a Re∣ward  I was at this Time in a Window op∣posite to his Lordship who saw the Man come over and deliver me the Answer I took a Pen and before his Face wrote Extempore the following Truth  To the Right Hon the Lord  Hth  In a CoffeeHouse hurried and prest by my Fate  I wrote a few Lines to get something to eat  Perhaps though the Subject a Dunce might inspire  The want of Subsistence has slackened my Fire  But if your kind Lordship that Want will supply  No Man shall write faster nor better than I  His Lordship sent Word it was very well It may be so thought I but Faith I found it very ill  I could not avoid repeating the Story in some Companies I after fell into and whether they resented the Reception I met or had some former Pique to that Nn I shall not pretend to say but shortly after the following Epigram was handed about  When in proper Terms we Dulness would cloath  We say you'r as dull as the Hill that's in  Hth    'Tis frequent in  Dublin  to say you are as stu∣pid as the Hill of  Hoath  But would you give Dulness the Force of Record  Say that every Thing stupid resembles my Ld  I should be sorry by producing these Pieces to be thought to harbour the least Resentment for the Fate of my  Marriage Poem the Judgment of a Pr must ever be Superior to that of the Insect called a Scribbler whose Views extend no farther than a Dinner or a Shilling and I only relate these little Anecdotes to shew that I am quite incapable of resenting any Thing my Su∣periors are pleas'd to do  As this is the first Time I have been blessed with an Opportunity of addres∣sing the polite World I find myself much inclin'd to prate though I already begin to fear I shall be censur'd for this impertinent Intrusion where I am an en∣tire Stranger yet as I have got so far and my Publisher who is a Man of real Taste and distinguished Abilities neither of which my Printer is destitute of as they I say have not yet rejected any Part of this Appendix as Nonsense I have a strange Inclication to venture upon a Page or two more  I remember to have seen amongst my Mother's Papers an Advertisement which she intended to have published in  London  and as it contains some Hu∣mour  I here recite it as well as I can recollect  Since it is become customary with every Person to advertise the Talents they either in Reality or Imagination possess I have been told I have a Stock on my Hands which is of no manner of use to me and having sold every Thing but the Gift of God to me if any Simon will purchase I will dispose of it as follows  If any illiterate Divine from  Cam∣bridge  or  Oxford  has a Mind to shew his Parts in a  London  Pulpit let him repair to me and he shall have a Ser∣mon not stolen from  Barrow Tillot∣son  or other eminent Preachers as is frequently the Practice with those who have Sense enough to do it but Firenew from the Mint If any Painter has a Mind to commence Bard without Wit and join the Sister Arts I also will assist him If any Author wants a Copy of Commendatory Ver∣ses to prefix to his Work or a flat∣tering Dedication to a worthless Great  Man any poor Person a Memorial or Petition properly calculated to dis∣solve the Walls of Stone and Flint which invir  n the Hearts of rich Men Ptes in particular any Print∣seller Lines to put under his

of Recantation to his Honoured Father any Minister of Stte an Apology for his Conduct which those Gentlemen frequently want any Undertaker a Funeral Elegy or any StoneCutter an Epi∣taph or in short any Thing in the Poetical Way shall be dispatched in the most private easy and genteel  Manner by applying to me and that at the most reasonable Rates  I think this Advertisement may seri∣ously now serve for me since I find I have no Means of subsisting but by a small Smattering of Wit which is some∣how inherent to me to which I do assure the Readers nothing but Necessity could make me have Recourse I too well know that the greatest Genius's in that Way have been scarce able to keep a Coat to their Backs therefore if some generous noble or humane Person would bestow on me a small Annuity which might barely set me above Want I would resign all Pretensions to the Pen into the Hands of those who by Educa∣tion and native Endowments are better qualified to use it Some Persons of Rank who are inclined to banter tell me they would by no Means deprive the World of their Entertainment by giving me a Provision but if they will please to con∣sider that one leisurewellfinished Line is of more Importance than Volumes  written in a Hurry they will be of another Mind If the great Mr  Dryden  had been possessed of an easy affluent For∣tune his Works which are now almost buried in Oblivion would have been had in much greater Esteem than they are since 'tis impossible to think but a Person of so extensive a Capacity must at one Time or other have produced something excellent  And since I have said so much one Thing more Truth Gratitude and Ho∣nour compels me to say which is in re∣lation to Mr  James Worsdale  so often mentioned in these Memoirs I'm sorry I'm oblig'd to confess that I think my Mother carried her Resentment too far in describing the Character of this Gen∣tleman but all Persons who have any superior Qualification have generally some Imperfection adequate to it which is done by Providence to shew us that none are perfect on Earth Thus we see an  Apollo  in Musick a Swine in his Ap∣petite Thus  Swift  unrival'd in Wit was a Slave to Peevishness and ill Tem∣per  which obscur'd his Merit in the most social Hour and my Mother who possest a pretty Manner of Writing was apt to fall too hard on those whom she imagined herself injured by  However I'm convinced Mr  Wors∣dale  never did nor intended Injury to her or any other Person as he is goodnatur'd to a Fault and as he has said himself  Anxious to gain but not to keep his Pelf  A Friend to ev'ry Creature but him∣self  And this is a Truth that I can assert having liv'd some Years in his House which was truly hospitable to every in∣digent Person that fell in his Knowledge but particularly such as had any Preten∣sions to Merit  What my Mother has said of him proceeded from some little Pique and therefore I hope People who read it will only laugh at her Humour but not seri∣ously  reflect on it to the Disadvantage of a Person who is incapable of acting but with Honour Justice and Integri∣ty which will be more fully in my Power to demonstrate in the little Account I intend to give of my own Life  And though it would exceed the small Limits I am prescrib'd to apologize to every particular Person pointed at in this Volume yet I hope they will be hu∣mane enough to harbour no Resentment against me for any Thing it contains since I have before specified the Necessity I was under of publishing it and as many Characters are there of which I am really ignorant so it would be im∣possible to break in upon the Connection of one Part with another by making Al∣terations or leaving any Part out  There were some Persons whom my Mother was highly obliged to and to whom had she lived to compleat this Work she would have returned her Ac∣knowledgments publickly one of them was the Earl of  Clanrickarde  a Noble∣man  of most illustrious Descent and one who conspicuously retains the united Vir∣tues of his Ancestors My Mother hav∣ing wrote his Lordship a Letter for a Subscription he sent her in Return a most polite Epistle which I have now the Honour to possess in which his Lord∣ship promised shortly to favour her with a Visit and in some Time he came After having sat about half an Hour chatting he told her he had promised to subscribe to her Works but that he imagined a Poem in her Praise written by himself would be of infinitely more Service to her upon which he de∣livered her a Sheet of Paper and she really believing him serious was about to open it Pardon me Madam said my Lord you must not read my Verses while I am present or you'll offend my Modesty She laid the Paper down and shortly after my Lord took has Leave When she opened it she found a Draft on  Dillon  and Company for twenty Pounds I hope I shall obtain his Lord∣ship's Forgiveness for the Freedom I  here take of mentioning his Name but I think such Actions and such alone compose his Life ought not to be ob∣scured and tho' doubtless this is but a trivial Instance of the Munificence and Honour of that worthy Nobleman yet as my Mother was an intire Stranger and that his Lordship did it purely in Compassion to her Sufferings and Regard to her Talents she ever esteemed both the Gift and the Manner it was given in as the genteelest Thing that could possibly be done and as she did not sur∣vive to speak her Sentiments on that Oc∣casion I hope I shall be pardoned for attempting it  FINIS
