 THE RETORT  BY The AUTHOR  Cum tua praetereas oculis male lippus inunctis  Cur in Amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum  Quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius at tibi contra  Evenit inquirant vitia ut

flattery and panegyrick he would at once assign to you the united virtues and abilities of a PITT a JOHNSON  The author of the Rambler  and a MEAD But as he cannot conceive any thing more nauseating to a sensible mind will leave such  polluted  offerings and  mean  artifices to those who  dreading your critic lash  would  thereby  be∣speak your partiality A method of address this which may at first perhaps from its being a little  unfashionable  seem to carry with it an air of vanity to some with a de∣gree of pride to others but as the author is not himself conscious of either he will be as little affected by such constructions as he is by the  ingenious  writings of those who are said to have lashed the town with great humour and severity  Vide CLL and LD'S  reports  of the playhouse

following lines any imputation or impeachment of  that sort  however deserving you may think him of the  lash  in other respects for though he is sensible  their  having acted  an illiberal part is by no means a sufficient plea for him yet he ventures to assert that there are men in the world who can be attacked no other way Who have nor know any other weapon and who if they do not find men guilty

sufficiently  shew cause  why he has mis∣employed so much of his Time on subjects wholly un∣worthy his and the publick's attention An assertion strongly confirmed by a  quaere  the author had put to him the other day by a Gentleman conversing with him upon the intended plan of his Retort Who immediately and  with great justice it must be admitted interrogated  him in the following words from

vocem  And now most humbly submits himself and piece to the candor of the  ingenuous  public avoiding  their  censure being the height of his ambition  THE anecdote intended to be recited is as follows  When Demetrius was arraigned at Athens for tyranny Menander was upon the verge of suffering death on no other account whatever than from a supposition and report prevailing of his being a friend and intimate of the traitor's  Like him has the present author been most illiberally brought under the same lash with a Gen∣tleman whom the NOBLE TRIUMVIRATE have thought proper to censure vilify and defame And like Me∣nander too has he suffered this on no other  apparent  ac∣count than from a seeming intimacy and friendship sub∣sisting between him and this Gentleman  Hinc  sibi  prima
