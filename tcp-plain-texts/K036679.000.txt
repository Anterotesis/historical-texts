dear is Captain Bevil at home  MAID  Who Sir  ROBIN  What is there nobody up yet  MAID  Up yet no Sir I believe they are not long gone to bed Why sure you must be as great a stranger here as I am to think of finding any one stirring at this time of the day  ROBIN  A stranger what then you are a new comerI don't remember having had the pleasure of seeing you before my dear  MAID  No Sir I have been here but a week and I don't know yet who it is I live with Mrs Sudds the washerwoman recommended me mayhap you may know her  ROBIN  I am acquainted with the family but I have not the honour of knowing her  Takes snuff  MAID  And here I am but I have ne'er seen the face of my master since here I've been I never hears any thing of him but when he raps at door in the morning and he is always going to bed just as I begin to think of getting upWhat perhaps you want to speak to Mr Chapeau  ROBIN  Yes I wish I could see him You must know I live with your master's elder brother  MAID  Oh what

dear Sir it is almost two o'clock  Looking at his watch  CHAPEAU  Is it indeed why we were up very late at Almack's last night and lost all our money Come sit down  drawing a chair  A damn'd run against us all night long But however no matter the worse luck now the better another time eh my little smiling Robin  ROBIN  Ay it is to be hoped so Mr ChapeauI think they say that your master has lost considerably of late has not he  CHAPEAU  Oh we have had the cursedest run of ill luck that ever people hadand how to raise money upon earth we don't know there's not a usurer not a thief between this and the Monument but we have brought to a standstill not a penny will they lend usI believethough it is the devil to think of that toobut I believe we must marry somebody we can't keep our heads above water much longer if we do not  ROBIN  I should suppose Mr Chapeau that your master had well nigh spent all his fortune by this time  CHAPEAU  Spent his fortune why we did not begin to make a figure or be at all known in the world till we had lost all we had  ROBIN  Why you don't tell me so  CHAPEAU  You may stare but it is very trueWe did not begin to have credit till we had not a farthing left in the world Ah Robin London is the place for credit pluck up but a good resolution and you may run in debt as much as you please Why the tradesmen are all playing as deep a game as our masters William bring chocolate  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Or would you rather have tea Robin  ROBIN  No thank you Mr Chapeau chocolate if you please I have left off tea some time  CHAPEAU  Why then bring chocolate  Exit  Servant  ROBIN  As one don't drink so confoundedly hard as one used to do I think there's less occasion for tea in a morning But pray what might your master have lost last night  CHAPEAU  Faith I can't justly say Bob told me for you must know we had a little party with him last night that at one in the morning he was out nine hundred and kept calling for Rouleaus till past five and every one quite worn out so you may guess  chocolate brought in  How much do you think I lost last night  ROBIN  Upon my soul I have no guessPerhaps a guinea or two  CHAPEAU  Fifty or may I never rattle a box again You must know that young Flimzy Sir Harry Blackball and some others were all ballotted in last night and we had devilish deep play  ROBIN  What a genteel manner he has  Aside  Fifty guineas Mr Chapeau why that will  make a horrid hole in your strong box won't it  CHAPEAU  A monstrous one I can't say but it will  sipping chocolate  But you must knowdon't take any notice of

little Robina monstrous fine girlShe danced with me at the last masqueradewe were both monstrously well dressed after which we went to a certain house thatshall be namelessThe husband is damn'd

money my little Robin you know is convenient  ROBIN  O yes dammethe money to be sure  sipping  CHAPEAU  Robin don't you remember meeting me in the Park about ten days since with a lady dressed in

But what brought you here to day so early Robin have you any message  ROBIN  Yes my master was not sure but his brother might be on guard so bid me call and ask He is at his brother's in the square I fancy he intends coming down here presentlySome family business in hand I have a notion  CHAPEAU  Ay they want to raise the devil cash I suppose I fancy it is confounded low with  both of them That curst place White's is so full of blacks the poor lads can't keep a farthing for them I suppose they want the oldest to lend  ROBIN  Not my master I warrant you he's a good manager sticks close to the law Why he's to be called to the bar next term Devilish clever he is an't he  CHAPEAU  O devilish clevera monstrous genius Robin  ROBIN  Very true Mr Chapeau he is very monstrous  The house maid

asked for my master I believe they be Jews  CHAPEAU  Jews Gadso they must not be neglected did they say they would call again  MAID  Yes one I think did say he would call again and another on 'em left a paper parcel I put it on the drawingroom table  Exit  CHAPEAU  It's very well Jenny  Bell rings  Well Robin you may tell your master that mine is just awake If he has any business this is the time to see him Now or never Adieu  au revoir  ROBIN  Well my dear Mr Chapeau adieuAdieu as the French have it  Going  CHAPEAU  But Robin damme not a word of the little chandler  ROBIN  Oh upon honour I'll be close as wax  CHAPEAU  Bravo my little dapper Robin you improve  ROBIN  Yes yes thanks to you I shall be some thing at last with a little of your assistance A charming genteel fellow  Exit  CHAPEAU  A foolish awkward toad  Bell rings  I hear you SirWhat a damned situation after all a servant's is  taking snuff  never at ease always attending other people's motionsI begin to be monstrous sick of it As my master is pretty near ruined I take it he will soon either hang or marry himself I shall then beg leave to retire and enjoy the fruits of my industry purchase some genteel sine cure take a snug box in the country and kill my own mutton  Exit  Scenea  DRAWINGROOM  a  COUCHFRENCH CHAIRSBOOKS  and  DRESS CLOATHS  as if taken off the night before  Enter  George Bevil  in his nightgown and  Chapeau  G BEVIL  My brother Harry's man here do you say  CHAPEAU  Yes Sir he came from Mr Bevil's in the square to know if you were upon duty or not  G BEVIL  My brother I suppose then will call here I am glad of it I shall have an opportunity of letting him into my situation  Aside  Any body else  CHAPEAU  The house maid says Sir two Jews were here before I was up they said they would call again and one of them left this parcel  G BEVIL  Oh very well the writings I supposeAy 'tis soLay them downIf they come again I must see themand if any body is with me shew them into my dressing roomThere's no living without these Israelites I am an absolute bankrupt with every christian creature and if my luck does not change shortly they will find me out at Duke's Place too  Enter  HARRY BEVIL  H BEVIL  So George you are just up I see you are as regular in your irregularities I find as  everSt James's dial does not better shew the hour of the day than you do the life of a modern fine gentleman  G BEVIL  St James's dial Sir is not as constant to the sun as I am to my course of life But how comes it that you are dressed so soon are you going to dine with any of your patronizing attorneys in ChanceryLane  H BEVIL  No I dine at this end of the town but I have businese on my handsbusiness which perhaps may occasion business for my patronizing attorneys as you are pleased to call them In short George I am upon the brink of matrimoney  G BEVIL  Indeed Why that's the very business I was wanting to open to you I have thoughts of marrying tooIn short Harry such is my situation at present that formidable as it may be I must marry I must find out a wife whose fortune may set me afloat again for faith as matters go I am sinking very fast  H BEVIL  But the question is where will you find one that can answer your purpose I am sure she must be handsome or you will never like  her and her fortune must be very handsome I am very sure or it will be of no use to you  G BEVIL  In both these points Harry I have been lucky enough to succeedDuring the course of my sauntring duty in the Park with the nursery maids I met with a very fine girl who has a considerable fortune in her own power but may expect a much greater if she marries with the consent of the old folksof them I know nothingThe young thing is entirely mineand I am foolish enough to be in love with her  G BEVIL  Simple indeed And her name is  G BEVIL  There you must excuse meI must be surer of carrying my point before I open myself farther even to youBut what pray is your situation  H BEVIL  Why faith odd enough you will say You have always laughed at me for sticking so close to the old ladies but at last I am rewarded for it One I have often seen at Lady Matchem's assemblies has taken it seems so violent an inclination to me that she has  made me an offer of her daughterTis true I am not acquainted with the girl I have only seen her at a distance but she is reckoned handsome and as I am sure her fortune has numberless charms I have made up my mind and am resolved  G BEVIL  And her name is  H BEVIL  There you must excuse me As you said I must be surer of my point before I open myself even to youLady Matchem has given me the characters of the family which stand thusThe girl amiable and handsome with a considerable fortune in her own power but as you said of yours if papa and mama consent may have a much greater The father is a man who has all his money in the stocks and though he lives on this side TempleBar is as ignorant of good company as if he had never removed from ThamesStreet all his time is taken up in listening to news picking up intelligence and buying in and selling out accordinglyThe mother's only joy is cards and governing her family which she does with as much authority as her husband's obstinacy will let her She has undertaken to open the matter to him and this afternoon I am perhaps to have the honour of an introduction to him More I'll tell you when I know more  G BEVIL  Have you opened this business yet to my brother Frank  H BEVIL  Not yet Does he know your plan of operations  G BEVIL  NoI went to him the other day with an intention of telling him all and begging his advice and assistance but unluckily the conversation turning first upon my losses at play put us both so heartily out of humour that company coming in I took the first opportunity of retreating and have not seen him since It will be time enough to tell him when I am a little surer of success The day wears tho' and I have a great deal of business upon my hands besides dressing I am laying some of my burdens upon the tribe of Issachar  H BEVIL  Who will take care to exonerate themselves I warrant How many Jews may your hohour have in hand now  G BEVIL  Umph why faith I believe about a round dozen but if I marry I will discard them all and play a more christian kind of game for the future  H BEVIL  Well success attend youPerhaps I may look in upon you at Almack's abut eleven  Exit  G BEVIL  Chapeau get my things ready to dress  Exit  Scene changes to  GRUB'S  House  Enter  GRUB  alone  What a miserable man I am with a wife that is positive a daughter that is marriageable

oeconomist three things very much to my mindIf I can but get my confounded wife to agree to itbut she's the devil to deal withIt was lucky I happened to meet with this man for the women are so agog nowadays that you cant provide too soon for them and a fine young girl with thirty thousand pounds in her own power is so tempting an object in this town that the sooner you can get her married and safe out of your hands the betterAhNow if I could but double my capital and bury my wife  sighs  but there is no such thing as real happiness on this side the grave  Exit  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  Enter  GRUB  NOW for this wife of mineI suppose I shall have a fine piece of work with her to make her approve of this matchnay ten to one but as I have found out the man she for that reason only

news  Mrs GRUB  News Heavens Mr Grub will you never leave off that filthy vulgar city custom of yours of asking every body you see for news news as if one was a hawker of Lloyd's Chronicle or the Public Ledger Now you are removed to this end of the town why don't you do like the rest of your neighbours When you are at Rome do as Rome does was always the saying of my poor dear brother Sir Tympany Tar Barrel  GRUB  Your poor dear brother might say what he pleased but he would never do as I have leave the city and all his old friends and begin the world as it were over again only to oblige his wife You could never get him to stir out of GutterLane  Mrs GRUB  Oh hideous name it not but if you are at a loss for friends why don't you do as I do take pains to make thembut noI must do every thing for the honour and credit of our name and if I did not go about to the watering places in the summer with my child and pick up fashionable company and make a point of playing high at their assemblies in the winter neither I nor my poor child would have a friend or acquaintance on this side LudgateMrs Deputy this and Mrs Deputy t'other and Alderman Goose and Alderman Gander pretty creatures to introduce a young lady with the fortune that Miss Grub will have  GRUB  Why it is very true as you say you have taken great pains about her acquaintance that's certainbut now you talk of

Apoplexyeat as hearty a dinner at Gird ler'sHall as man could eat and was dead before he could swallow church and state stiff before the second toast could go round Ah the new paving of the streets

did well I declare that's pat enough he he he I vow and protest I'm pleased at thiswhy our inclinations do seldom jump together  Mrs GRUB  Jump quotha no on my conscience I should wonder they didand how comes it now to pass What I suppose you have been employing some of your brokers as usual or perhaps advertizing as you used to dobut I expect to hear no more of those tricks now we are come to this end of the town  GRUB  No no my dear this is no such matter the gentleman I intend  Mrs GRUB  You intend  GRUB  Yes I intend  Mrs GRUB  You intendwhat do you presume to dispose of my child

the saying isbut leave to me the management of my childWhat things are come to a fine pass indeed I suppose you intend to marry the poor innocent to some of your city cronies your factors supercargoes packers and drysalters but thank my stars I have washed my hands of them and I'll have none of them Mr Grub no I'll have none of themIt never shall be said that after coming to this end of the town the great Miss Grub was forced to trudge into the city again for a husband  GRUB  Why zounds are you mad Mrs Grub  Mrs GRUB  No you shall find I am not mad Mr Grub that I know how to dispose of my child Mr Grubwhat did my poor dear brother leave his fortune to me and my child and shall she now be disposed of without consulting me  GRUB  Why the devil is in you certainly if you will but hear me

up their noses at you and your daughterDid I not treat with my Lord Spindle my Lord Thoughtless and my Lord Maukin and did we not agree for the first time in our lives that it would be better to find out a commonner for her as the people of quality only marry nowadays for a winter or so  Mrs GRUB  Very well we did soand who pray is the proper person to find out a match for herwho but her mother Mr Grub who goes into company with no other view Mr Grubwho flatters herself that she is no contemptible judge of mankind Mr GrubYes Mr Grub I know mankind as well as any woman on earth Mr Grub  GRUB

fortune which I could never find in my heart to enjoy And now when all the comfort I have in the world the settlement of my child is in agitationshall I not speak shall I not have leave to approve of
