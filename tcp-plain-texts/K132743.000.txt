 THE TRAGEDY OF  SOPHONISBA  Acted at the THEATREROYAL IN  DRURYLANE  By His MAJESTY'S Servants  By Mr  THOMSON  LONDON  Printed for A MILLAR at  Buchanan  's Head overagainst St  Clement  's Church in the  Strand  M DCC XXX  TO THE QUEEN  MADAM  _THE notice Your MAJESTY has condescended to take of the following  Tragedy  emboldens me to lay it in the humblest manner at Your MAJESTY'S Feet And to whom can this illustrious  Carthaginian  so properly fly for protection as to a QUEEN who commands the hearts of a  People  more powerful at sea than  Carthage  more flourishing in  commerce  than those  first Merchants  more secure against conquest and under a  Monarchy  more free than a  Commonwealth  itself  I dare not nor indeed need I here attempt a character where both the great and the amiable Qualities shine forth in full perfection All words are faint to speak what is universally felt and acknowledged by a happy people Permit me therefore only to subscribe my self with the truest zeal and veneration  MADAM    Your  MAJESTY'S  Most humble Most dutiful And most devoted Servant  JAMES THOMSON  PREFACE  _IT is not my intention in this preface to defend any faults that may be found in the following piece I am afraid there are too many But those who are best able to discover will be most ready to pardon them They alone know how difficult an undertaking the writing of a tragedy is and this is a first attempt  I beg leave only to mention the reason that determined me to make choice of this subject What pleased me particularly tho' perhaps it will not be least liable to objection with ordinary readers was the great simplicity of the story It is one regular and uniform not charged with a multiplicity of incidents and yet affording several revolutions of fortune by which the passions may be excited varied and driven to their full tumult of emotion  This unity of design was always sought after and admired by the antients and the most eminent among the moderns who understood their writings have chosen to imitate them in this from an intire conviction that the reason of it must hold good in all ages And here allow me to translate a passage from the celebrated  Monsieur Racine  which contains all that I have to say on this head  We must not fancy that this rule has no other foundation but the caprice of those who made it Nothing can touch us in tragedy but what is probable And what probability is there that in one Day should happen a multitude of things which could scarce happen in several Weeks There are some wh  think that this simplicity is a mark of barrenness  invention But they do not consider that on the  contrary invention consists in making something out of nothing and that this huddle of incidents has always been the refuge of poets who did not find in their genius either richness or force enough to engage their spectators for five acts together by a simple action supported by the violence of passions the beauty of sentiments and the nobleness of expression  I would not be understood to mean that all these things are to be found in my performance I only shew the reader what I aimed at and how I would have pleased him had it been in my power  As to the character of  Sophonisba  in drawing it I have confined myself to the truth of history It were an affront to the age to suppose such a character out of nature especially in a country which has produced so many great examples of public spirit and heroic virtues even in the softer sex and I had destroyed her character intirely had I not marked it with that strong love to her country disdain of servitude and inborn aversion to the  Romans  by which all historians have distinguished her Nor ought her marrying  Masinissa  while her former husband was still alive to be reckoned a blemish in her character For by the laws both of  Rome  and  Carthage  the captivity of the husband dissolved the marriage of course as among us impotence or adultery not to mention the reasons of a moral and public nature which I have put into her own mouth in the scene betwixt her and  Syphax  This is all I have to say of the play itself But I cannot conclude without owning my obligations to those concerned in the representation They have indeed done me more than justice Whatever was designed as amiable and engaging in  Masinissa  shines out in Mr  Wilks  's action Mrs  Oldfield  in the character of  Sophonisba  has excelled what even in the fondness of an author I could either wish or imagine The grace dignity and happy variety of her action have been universally applauded and are truly admirable  PROLOGUE  By a FRIEND  Spoken by Mr WILLIAMS  WHEN learning after the long  Gothic  night  Fair o'er the western world renew'd his light  With arts arising  Sophonisba  rose  The tragic muse returning wept her woes  With her th'  Italian  scene first learnt to glow  And the first tears for her were taught to flow  Her charms the  Gallic  muses next inspir'd  Corneille  himself saw wonder'd and was fir'd  What foreign theatres with pride have shewn  Britain  by juster title makes her own  When freedom is the cause 'tis hers to fight  And hers wken freedom is the theme to write  For this a  British Author  bids again  The heroine rise to grace the  British  scene  Here as in life she breathes her genuine flame  She asks what bosom has not felt the same  Asks of the  British Youth  Is silence there  She dares to ask it of the  British Fair  To night our homespun author would be true  At once to nature history and you  Wellpleas'd to give our neighbours due applause  He owns their learning but disdains their laws  Not to his patient touch or happy flame  'Tis to his  British  heart he trusts for fame  If  France  excel him in one freeborn thought  The man as well as poet is in fault  Nature  informer of the poet's art  Whose force alone can raise or melt the heart  Thou art his guide each passion every line  Whate'er he draws to please must all be thine  Be thou his judge in every candid breast  Thy silent whisper is the sacred test  The Persons represented  MASINISSA King of  Massylia    By Mr  Wilks  SYPHAX King of

Phoenissa  this important hour  Or fixes me a queen or from a throne  Throws  Sophonisba  into  Roman  chains  Detested thought For now his utmost force  Collected desperate distress'd and sore  From battles lost with all the rage of war  Illfated  Syphax  makes his last effort  But say thou partner of my hopes and fears  Phoenissa  say while from the lofty tower  Our straining eyes the field of battle sought  Ah thought you not that our  Numidian  troops  Gave up the broken field and scattering fled  Wild o'er the hills from the rapacious sons  Of still triumphant  Rome  PHOENISSA  The dream of care  And think not madam  Syphax  can resign  But with his ebbing life in this last field  A crown a kingdom and a queen he loves  Beyond ambition's brightest wish for whom  Nor mov'd by threats nor bound by plighted faith  He scorn'd the  Roman  friendship that fair name  For slavery and from th' engagements broke  Of  Scipio  fam'd for every winning art  The towering genius of recover'd  Rome  SOPHONISBA  Oh name him not These  Romans  stir my blood  To too much rage I cannot bear the fortune  Of that proud peopleSaid you not  Phoenissa    That  Syphax  lov'd me which would fire his battle  And urge him on to death or conquest True  He loves me with the madness of desire  His every passion is a slave to love  Nor heeds he danger where I bid him go  Nor leagues nor interest Hence these endless wars  These ravag'd countries these successless fights  Sustain'd for  Carthage  whose defence alone  Engag'd my loveless marriagevows with his  But know you not that in the  Roman  camp  I have a lover too a gallant brave  And disappointed lover full of wrath  Returning to a kingdom whence the sword  Of  Syphax  drove him  PHOENISSA  Masinissa  SOPHONISBA  He  Young  Masinissa  the  Massylian  king  The first addresser of my youth for whom  My bosom felt a fond beginning wish  Extinguish'd soon when once to  Scipio  's side  Won o'er and dazled by th' enchanting glare  Of that fair seeming heroe he became  A gay admiring slave yet knew it not  E'er since my heart has held him in contempt  And thrown out each idea of his worth  That there began to grow nay had it been  As allpossest and soft as her's who sits  In secret shades or by the falling stream  And wastes her being in unutter'd pangs  I would have broke or cur'd it of its fondness  PHOENISSA  Heroic  Sophonisba  SOPHONISBA  No  Phoenissa    It is not for the daughter of great  Asdrubal    Descended from a long illustrious line  Of  Carthaginian  heroes who have oft  Fill'd  Italy  with terror and dismay  And shook the walls of  Rome  to pine in love  Like a deluded maid to give her life  And heart highbeating in her country's cause  Meant not for common aims and houshold cares  To give them up to vain presuming man  Much less to one who stoops the neck to  Rome    An enemy to  Carthage    Masinissa  PHOENISSA  Think not I mean to check that glorious flame  That just ambition which exalts your soul  Fires on your cheek and lightens in your eye  Yet would he had been yours this rising prince  For trust me fame is fond of  Masinissa  His various fortune his resplendent deeds  His courage conduct deepexperienc'd youth  And vast unbroken spirit in distress  Still rising stronger from the last defeat  Are all the talk and terror too of  Afric  Who has not heard the story of his woes  How hard he came to his paternal reign  Whence soon by  Syphax  ' unrelenting hate  And jealous  Carthage  driven he with a few  Fled to the mountains Then I think it was  Hem'd in a circle of impending rocks  That all his followers fell save fifty horse  Who thence escap'd thro' secret paths abrupt  Gain'd the  Clupean  plain There overtook  And urg'd by fierce surrounding foes he burst  With four alone sore wounded thro' their ranks  And all amidst a mighty torrent plung'd  Seiz'd by the whirling gulph two sunk and two  With him obliquely hurried down the stream  Wrought to the farther shore Th'astonish'd troops  Stood check'd and shivering on the gloomy brink  And deem'd him lost in the devouring flood  Mean time the dauntless undespairing youth  Lay in a cave conceal'd curing his wounds  With mountainherbs and on his horses fed  Nor here even at the lowest ebb of life  Stoop'd his aspiring mind What need I say  How once again restor'd and once again  Expell'd among the  Garamantian  hills  He since has wander'd till the  Roman  arm  Reviv'd his cause And who shall reign alone  Syphax  or he this day decides  SOPHONISBA  Enough  Thou need'st not blazon thus his fame  Phoenissa  Were he as glorious as the pride of woman  Could wish in all her wantonness of thought  The joy of humankind wise valiant good  With every praise with every laurel crown'd  The warriour's wonder and the virgin's sigh  Yet this would cloud him o'er this blemish all  His mean submission to the  Roman  yoke  That false to  Carthage    Afric  and himself  With proferr'd hand and knee he hither led  These ravagers of earthBut while we talk  The work of fate goes on even now perhaps  My dying country bleeds in every vein  And the warm victor thunders at our gate  SCENE II  SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA  and to them a  MESSENGER  from the Battle  SOPHONISBA  Ha Whence art thou Speak tho' thy bleeding wounds  Might well excuse thy tongue  MESSENGER  Madam escap'd  With much ado from yon wide death  SOPHONISBA  No more  At once thy meaning flashes o'er my soul  Oh all my vanish'd hopes repairless chance  Of undiscerning warAnd is all lost  An universal havock  MESSENGER  Madam all  For scarce a  Masoesylian  save my self  But is or seiz'd or bites the bloody plain  The King  SOPHONISBA  Ah what of him  MESSENGER  His fiery steed  By  Masinissa  the  Massylian  prince  Pierc'd threw him headlong to his clustering foes  And now he comes in chains  SOPHONISBA  'Tis wond'rous fit  Absolute gods All  Afric  is in chains  The weeping world in chainsOh is there not  A time a righteous time reserv'd in fate  When these oppressors of mankind shall feel  The miseries they give and blindly fight  For their own fetters tooThe conquering troops  How points their motion  MESSENGER  At my heels they came  Loudshouting dreadful in a cloud of dust  By  Masinissa  headed  SOPHONISBA  Hark arriv'd  The murmuring crowd rolls frighted to the palace  Thou bleed'st to death poor faithful wretch away  And dress thy wounds if life be worth thy care  Tho'  Rome  methinks will lose a slave in thee  Would  Sophonisba  were as near the verge  Of boundless and immortal liberty  SCENE III  SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA  After a Pause  SOPHONISBA  And wherefore not When liberty is lost  Let slaves and cowards live but in the brave  It were a treachery to themselves enough  To merit chains And is it fit for me  Who in my veins from  Asdrubal  deriv'd  Hold  Carthaginian  enmity to  Rome    On whom I've lavish'd all my burning soul  In everlasting hate for whose destruction  I sold my joyless youth to  Syphax  ' arms  And turn'd him fierce upon them fit for such  A native restless unrelenting foe  To sit down softlypensive and await  Th'approaching victor's rage reserv'd in chains  To grace his triumph and become the scorn  Of every  Roman  dameGods how my soul  Disdains the thought and this shall set it free  Offers to stab her self  PHOENISSA  Hold  Sophonisba  hold my friend my queen  For whom alone I live hold your rash point  Nor thro' your guardian bosom stab your country  That is our last resort and always sure  The gracious gods are liberal of death  To that last blessing lend a thousand ways  Think not I'd have you live to drag a chain  And walk the triumph of insulting  Rome  No by these tears of loyalty and love  Ere I beheld so vile a sight this hand  Should urge the faithful poynard to your heart  And glory in the deed But while hope lives  Let not the generous die 'Tis late before  The brave despair  SOPHONISBA  Thou copy of my soul  And now my friend indeed Shew me but hope  One glimpse of hope and I'll renew my toils  Call patience labour fortitude again  The vext unjoyous day and sleepless night  Nor shrink at danger any shape of death  Shew me the smallest hope Alas  Phoenissa    Too kindly confident Hope lives not here  Fled with her sister Liberty beyond  The  Garamantian  hills to some steep wild  Some undiscover'd country where the foot  Of  Roman  cannot come  PHOENISSA  Yes there she liv'd  With  Massinissa  wounded and forlorn  Amidst the serpents hiss and tygers yell  SOPHONISBA  Why nam'st thou him  PHOENISSA  Madam in this forgive  My forward zeal from him proceeds our hope  He lov'd you once nor is your form impair'd  Warm'd and unfolded into stronger charms  Ask his protection from the  Roman  power  You must prevail for  Sophonisba  sure  From  Masinissa  cannot ask in vain  SOPHONISBA  Now by the prompting genius of my country  I thank thee for the thought True there is pain  Even in descending thus to beg protection  From that degenerate youth But oh for thee  My sinking country and again to gaul  This hated  Rome  what would I not endure  It shall be done  Phoenissa  tho' disgust  Choak'd up my struggling meaning shall be done  kneels  But here I vow propitious  Juno  hear  Could every pomp and every pleasure joyn'd  Love empire glory a whole kneeling world  Unnerve my smallest purpose and remit  That most inveterate enmity I bear  The  Roman  state may  Carthage  smoak in ruins  Rome  rise the mistress of mankind and I  There an abandon'd slave drag out a length  Of life in loathsome baseness and contempt  This way the trumpet sounds let us retire  SCENE IV  MASINISSA    SYPHAX  in Chains  NARVA  Guards  c  SYPHAX  Is there no dungeon in this city dark  As is my troubled soul That thus I'm brought  To my own palace to those rooms of state  Wont in another manner to receive me  With other signs of royalty than these  looking on his chains  MASINISSA  I will not wound thee not insult thee  Syphax    With a recital of thy tyrant crimes  A captive here I see thee fallen below  My most revengeful wish and all the rage  The noble fury that inspir'd this morn  Is sunk to soft compassion In the field  The flaming front of war there is the scene  Of brave revenge and I have sought thee there  Keen as the hunted lyon seeks his foe  But when a broken enemy disarm'd  And helpless lies a falling sword an eye  With pity flowing and an arm as weak  As infant softness then becomes the brave  Now sleeps the sword the passions of the field  Subside to peace and my relenting soul  Melts at thy fate  SYPHAX  This this is all I dread  All I detest this insolence refin'd  This barbarous pity this affected goodness  Pitied by theeIs there a form of death  Of torture and of infamy like that  It kills my very soulYe partial gods  I feel your worst why should I fear you more  Hear me vain youth take noticeI abhor  Thy mercy loath itPoison to my thoughts  Wouldst thou be merciful One way alone  Thou canst oblige meUse me like a slave  As I would thee delicious thought wert thou  Here crouching in my power  MASINISSA  Outragious man  If that is mercy I'll be cruel still  Nor canst thou drive me by thy bitterest rage  To an unmanly deed not all thy wrongs  Nor this worse triumph in them  SYPHAX  Ha ha wrongs  I cannot wrong thee When we lanch the spear  Into the monster's heart or crush the serpent  Destroy what in antipathy we hold  The common foe can that be call'd a wrong  Injurious that Absurd it cannot be  MASINISSA  I'm loth to hurt thee moreThe tyrant works  Too fierce already in thy rankled breast  But since thou seem'st to rank me with thy self  With great destroyers with perfidious kings  I must reply to thy licentious tongue  Bid thee remember whose accursed sword  Began this work of death who broke the ties  The holy ties attested by the gods  Which bind the nations in the bond of peace  Who meanly took advantage of my youth  Unskill'd in arms unsettled on my throne  And drove me to the desart there to dwell  With kinder monsters who my cities sack'd  My country pillag'd and my subjects murder'd  Who still pursu'd me with inveterate hate  When generous force prov'd vain with ruffian arts  The villain's dagger base assassination  And for no reason all Brute violence  Alone thy pleaWhat the least provocation  Say canst thou but pretend  SYPHAX  I needed none  Nature  has in my being sown the seeds  Of enmity to thineNay mark me this  Couldst thou restore me to my former state  Strike off these chains give me the sword again  The sceptre and the wideobedient war  Yet must I still implacable to thee  Seek eagerly thy death or die my self  Life cannot hold us bothUnequal gods  Who love to disappoint mankind and take  All Vengeance to your selves why to the point  Of my longflatter'd wishes did ye lift me  Then sink me thus so low Just as I drew  The glorious stroke that was to make me happy  Why did you blast my strong extended arm  Strike the dry sword unsated to the ground  But that to mock us is your cruel sport  What else is human life  MASINISSA  Thus always join'd  With an inhuman heart and brutal manners  Is irreligion to the ruling gods  Whose schemes our peevish ignorance arraigns  Our thoughtless prideThy lost condition  Syphax    Is nothing to the tumult of thy breast  There lies the sting of evil there the drop  That poisons natureYe mysterious powers  Whose ways are evergracious everjust  As ye think wisest best dispose of me  But whether thro' your gloomy depths I wander  Or on your mountains walk give me the calm  The steady smiling soul where wisdom sheds  Eternal sunshine and eternal joy  Then if misfortune comes she brings along  The bravest virtues And so many great  Illustrious spirits have convers'd with woe  The pride of adverse fate as are enough  To consecrate distress and make even death  Ambition  SYPHAX  Torture Racks The common trick  Of insolent success unsuffering pride  This prate of patience and I know not what  'Tis all a lie impracticable rant  And only tends to make me scorn thee more  But why this talk In mercy send me hence  Yetere I goOh save me from distraction  I know hot youth thou burnest for my queen  But by the majesty of ruin'd kings  And that commanding glory which surrounds her  I charge thee touch her not  MASINISSA  No  Syphax  no  Thou need'st not charge me That were mean indeed  A triumph that to thee But could I stoop  Again to love her Thou what right hast thou  A captive to her bed Nor life nor queen  Nor ought a captive has All laws in this  Roman  and  Carthaginian  all agree  SYPHAX  Here here begins the bitterness of death  Here my chains grind me first  MASINISSA  Poor  Sophonisba  She too becomes the prize of conquering  Rome    What most her heart abhors Alas how hard  Will slavery sit on her exalted soul  How piteous hard But if I know her well  She never will endure it she will die  For not a  Roman  burns with nobler ardor  A higher sense of liberty than she  And tho' she marry'd thee her only stain  False to my youth and faithless to my vows  Yet I must own it from a worthy cause  From publick spirit did her fault proceed  SYPHAX  Blue plagues and poison on thy meddling tongue  Talk not of her for every word of her  Is a keen dagger griding thro' my heart  Oh for a lonely dungeon where I rather  Would talk with my own groans and great revenge  Than in the mansions of the blest with thee  Hell Whither must I go  MASINISSA  Unhappy man  And is thy breast determin'd against peace  On comfort shut  SYPHAX  On all but death from thee  MASINISSA  Narva  be  Syphax  thy peculiar care  And use him well with tenderness and honour  This evening  Lelius  and to morrow  Scipio    To  Cirtha  come Then let the  Romans  take  Their prisoner  SYPHAX  There shines a gleam of hope  Across the gloomFrom thee deliver'dEase  Breathes in that thoughtLead onMy heart grows lighter  SCENE V  MASINISSA  alone  What dreadful havoc in the human breast  The passions make when unconfin'd and mad  They burst unguided by the mental eye  The light of reason which in various ways  Points them to good or turns them back from ill  O save me from the tumult of the soul  From the wild beasts withinFor circling sands  When the swift whirlwind whelms them o'er the lands  The roaring deeps that to the clouds arise  While thwarting thick the mingled lightning flies  The monsterbrood to which this land gives birth  The blazing city and the gaping earth  All deaths all tortures in one pang combin'd  Are gentle to the tempest of the mind  The End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  MASINISSA    NARVA    MASINISSA  'Tis true my friend  Thou good old man by whom my youth was form'd  The firm companion of my various life  I own 'tis true that  Sophonisba  's image  Lives in my bosom still and at each glance  I take in secret of the bright idea  A strange disorder seizes on my soul  Which burns with stronger glory Need I say  How once she had my vows Till  Scipio  came  Resistless man like a descending God  And snatch'd me from the  Carthaginian  side  To nobler  Rome  beneath whose laurel'd brow  And ample eye the nations grow polite  Humane and happy Then thou may'st remember  Such is this woman's high impetuous spirit  That allcontrouling love she bears her country  Her  Carthage  that at this she sacrific'd  To  Syphax  unbelov'd her blooming Years  And won him off from  Rome  NARVA  My generous prince  Applauding  Afric  of thy choice approves  Fame claps her wings and virtue smiles on thee  Of peace thou softner and thou soul of war  But oh beware of that fair foe to glory  Woman and most of  Carthaginian  woman  Who has not heard of fatal  Punic  guile  Of their sly conquests their insidious leagues  Their  Asdrubals  their  Hannibals  with all  Their wily heroes And if such their men  What must their women be  MASINISSA  You make me smile  I thank thy honest zeal But never dread  The firmness of my heart my strong attachment  Severe to  Rome  to  Scipio  and to Glory  Indeed I cannot would not quite forget  The grace of  Sophonisba  how she look'd  And talk'd and mov'd a  Pallas  or a  Juno  Accomplish'd even in trifles when she stoop'd  Ambition's flight and with a soften'd eye  Gave her quick spirit into gayer life  Then every word was liveliness and wit  We heard the Muses' song and the dance swam  Thro' all the maze of harmony I flatter not  Believe me  Narva  yet my panting soul  To  Scipio  taken in the fair pursuit  Of fame and for my people's happiness  Resign'd this  Sophonisba  and tho' now  Constrain'd by soft necessity to see her  And she a captive in my power will still  Resign her  NARVA  Let me not doubt thy fortitude  My  Masinissa  thy exalted purpose  Not to be lost in love but ah we know not  Oft till experience sighs it to the soul  The boundless witchcraft of ensnaring woman  And our own slippery hearts From  Scipio  learn  The temperance of heroes I'll recount  Th' instructive story what these eyes beheld  Perhaps you've heard it but 'tis pleasing still  Tho' told a thousand times  MASINISSA  I burn to hear it  Lost by my late misfortunes in the desart  I liv'd a stranger to the voice of fame  To  Scipio  's last exploits Exalt me now  Great actions raise the mind But when a friend  A  Scipio  does them then with more than wonder  Even with a sort of vanity we listen  NARVA  When to his glorious first essay in war  New  Carthage  fell there all the flower of  Spain  Were kept in hostage a full field presenting  For  Scipio  's generosity to shine  And then it was that when the heroe heardâª  How I to thee belong'd he with large gifts  And friendly words dismiss'd me  MASINISSA  I remember  And in his favour that impress'd me first  But to thy story  NARVA  What with admiration  Struck every heart was thisA noble virgin  Conspicuous far o'er all the captive dames  Was mark'd the general's prize She wept and blush'd  Young fresh and blooming like the morn An eye  As when the blue sky trembles thro' a cloud  Of purest white A secret charm combin'd  Her features and infus'd enchantment thro' them  Her shape was harmonyBut eloquence  Beneath her beauty fails which seem'd on purpose  Pour'd out by lavish nature that mankind  Might see this action in its highest lustre  Soft as she pass'd along with downcast eyes  Where gentle sorrow swell'd and now and then  Dropt o'er her modest cheek a trickling tear  The  Roman  legions languish'd and hard war  Felt more than pity Even  Scipio  's self  As on his high tribunal rais'd he sat  Turn'd from the piercing sight and chiding ask'd  His officers if by this gift they meant  To cloud his glory in its very dawn  MASINISSA  Oh Gods my fluttering heart On stop not  Narva  NARVA  She question'd of her birth in trembling accents  With tears and blushes broken told her tale  But when he found her royally descended  Of her old captive parents the sole joy  And that a hapless  Celtiberian  prince  Her lover and belov'd forgot his chains  His lost dominions and for her alone  Wept out his tender soul sudden the heart  Of this young conquering loving godlike  Roman  Felt all the great divinity of virtueâª  His wishing youth stood check'd his tempting powerâª  By infinite humanity  MASINISSA  Well well  And then  NARVA  Disdaining guilty doubt at once  He for her parents and her lover call'd  The various scene imagine How his troops  Look'd dubious on and wonder'd what he meant  While stretch'd below the trembling suppliants lay  Rack'd by a thousand mingling passions fear  Hope jealousy disdain submission grief  Anxiety and love in every shape  To these as different sentiments succeeded  As mixt emotions when the man divine  Thus the dread silence to the lover broke  " We both are young both charm'd The Right of War  " Has put thy beauteous mistress in my power  " With whom I could in the most sacred ties  " Live out a happy life But know that  Romans  " Their hearts as well as enemies can conquer  " Then take her to thy soul and with her take  " Thy liberty and kingdom In return  " I ask no more but when you view these eyes  " These charms with transport be a friend to  Rome  MASINISSA  There spoke the soul of  Scipio  But the Lovers  NARVA  Joy and extatic wonder held them mute  While the lowd camp and all the clustring crowd  That hung around rang with repeated shouts  Fame took th' alarm and thro' resounding  Spain  Blew fast the fair report which more than arms  Admiring nations to the  Romans  gain'd  MASINISSA  My friend in glory thy awaken'd prince  Springs at thy faithful tale It fires my soul  And nerves each thought anew apt oft perhaps  Too much too much to slacken into love  But now the soft oppression flies and all  My mounting powers expand to deeds like thine  Thou pattern and inspirer of my fame  Scipio  thou first of men and best of friends  What man of soul would live my  Narva  breathe  This idlepuffing element and run  Day after day the stillreturning round  Of life's mean offices and sickly joys  But in compassion to mankind to be  A guardian God below to dissipate  An ardent being in heroic aims  Do something vastly great like what you told  Something to raise him o'er the groveling herd  And make him shine for everOh my friend  Bleed every vein about me every nerve  With anguish tremble every sinew ake  Be toil familiar to my limbs ambition  Mix all my thoughts in an incessant whirl  The third time may I lose my kingdom and again  Wander the false inhospitable Syrts  Yet oh ye liberal Gods in rich award  And amplest recompenceI ask no more  Share me the wreath of fame from  Scipio  's brow  But see she comes mark her majestic port  SCENE II  MASINISSA    SOPHONISBA    NARVA    PHOENISSA  SOPHONISBA  Behold victorious prince the scene revers'd  And  Sophonisba  kneeling here a captive  O'er whom the Gods thy Fortune and thy Virtue  Have given unquestion'd power of life and death  If such a one may raise her suppliant voice  Once music to thy ear if she may touch  Thy knee thy purple and thy victorhand  Oh listen  Masinissa  Let thy soul  Intensely listen While I fervent pray  And strong adjure thee by that regal state  In which with equal pomp we lately shone  By the  Numidian  name our common boast  And by those houshold gods who may I wish  With better omens take thee to this palace  Than  Syphax  hence they sent As is thy pleasure  In all beside determine of my fate  This this alone I beg Never oh never  Into the cruel proud and hated power  Of  Romans  let me fall Since angry heaven  Will have it so that I must be a slave  And that a galling chain must bind these hands  It were some little softning in my doom  To call a kindred son of the same clime  A native of  Numidia  my lord  But if thou canst not save me from the  Romans    If this sad favour be beyond thy power  At least to give me death is what thou canst  Here strikemy naked bosom courts thy sword  And my last breath shall bless thee  Masinissa  MASINISSA  Rise  Sophonisha  rise To see thee thus  Is a revenge I scorn and all the man  Within me though much injur'd by thy pride  And spirit too tempestuous for thy sex  Yet blushes to behold thus at my feet  Thus prostrate low her for whom kings have kneel'd  The fairest but the falsest of her sex  SOPHONISBA  Spare thy reproach'Tis cruel thus to lose  In ranckling discord and ungenerous strife  The few remaining moments that divide me  From the last evil bondage  Roman  bondage  Yes shut thy heart against me Shut thy heart  Against compassion every human thought  Even recollected love Yet know rash Youth  That when thou seest me swell their lofty triumph  Thou seest thy self in me This is my day  To morrow may be thine But here assur'd  Here will I lie on this vile earth forlorn  Of hope abandon'd since despis'd by thee  These locks all loose and sordid in the dust  This sullied bosom growing to the ground  Scorch'd up with anguish and of every shape  Of misery full till comes the soldier fierce  From recent blood and in thy very eye  Lays raging his rude sanguinary grasp  On these weak limbs and clinches them in chains  Then if no friendly steel no nectar'd draught  Of deadly poison can enlarge my soul  It will indignant burst from a slave's body  And join'd to mighty  Dido  scorn ye all  MASINISSA  Oh  Sophonisba  'tis not safe to hear thee  And I mistook my Heart to trust it thus  Hence let me fly  SOPHONISBA  You shall not  Masinissa  Here will I hold you tremble here for ever  Here unremitting grow till you consent  And can'st thou think oh canst thou think to leave me  Expos'd defenceless wretched here alone  A prey to  Romans  flush'd with blood and conquest  The subject of their scorn or baser love  Sure  Masinissa  cannot and tho' chang'd  Tho' cold as that averted look he wears  Sure love can ne'er in generous breasts be lost  To that degree as not from shame and outrage  To save what once they lov'd  MASINISSA  Enchantment Madness  What would'st thou  Sophonisba  Oh my heart  My treacherous heart  SOPHONISBA  What would I  Masinissa  My mean Request sits blushing on my cheek  To be thy slave young prince is what I beg  Here  Sophonisba  kneels to be thy slave  Yet kneels in vain But thou'rt a slave thy self  And canst not from the  Romans  save one woman  Her who was once the triumph of thy soul  E'er they seduc'd it by their lying glory  Immortal gods and am I fallen so low  Scorn'd by a lover by a slave to  Rome  Nought can be worth this baseness life nor empire  I loath me for itOn this kinder earth  Then leave me leave me to despair and death  MASINISSA  What means this conflict with almighty nature  With the whole warring heartRise quickly rise  In all the conquering majesty of charms  O  Sophonisba  rise while here I swear  By the tremendous powers that rule mankind  By heaven and earth and hell by love and glory  The  Romans  shall not hurt you  Romans  cannot  For  Rome  is generous as the gods themselves  And honours not insults a generous foe  Yet since you dread them take this sacred pledge  This hand of surety by which kings are bound  By which I hold you mine and vow to treat you  With all the rev'rence due to ruin'd state  With all the softness of remember'd love  All that can sooth thy fate and make thee happy  SOPHONISBA  I thank thee  Masinissa  now the same  The same warm youth exalted full of soul  With whom in happier days I wont to pass  The sighing hour while dawning fair in love  All song and sweetness life set joyous out  Ere the black tempest of ambition rose  And drove us different waysThus dress'd in war  In nodding plumes o'ercast with sullen thought  With purpos'd vengeance dark I knew thee not  But now breaks out the beauteous fun anew  The gay  Numidian  shines who warm'd me once  Whose love was gloryVain ideas hence  Long since my heart to nobler passions known  Has your acquaintance scorn'd  MASINISSA  Oh while you talk  Enchanting fair one my deluded thought  Runs back to days of love when fancy still  Found worlds of beauty ever rising new  To the transported eye when flattering hope  Form'd endless prospects of increasing bliss  And still the credulous heart believ'd them all  Even more than love could promiseBut the scene  Is full of danger for a tainted eye  I must not dare not will not look that way  O hide it wisdom glory from my view  Or in sweet ruin I shall link again  Disaster clouds thy cheek thy colour goes  Retire and from the troubles of the day  Repose thy weary soul worn out with care  And rough unhappy thought  SOPHONISBA  May  Masinissa  Ne'er want the goodness he has shewn to me  SCENE III  MASINISSA    NARVA  MASINISSA  The danger's o'er I've heard the  Syren  's song  Yet still to glory hold my steady course  I mark'd thy kind concern thy friendly fears  And own them just for she has beauty  Narva    So full so perfect with so great a soul  Inform'd so pointed high with spirit  As strikes like lightning from the hand of  Jove    And raises love to glory  NARVA  Ah my Prince  Too true it is too true her fatal charms  Are powerful and to  Masinissa  's heart  But know the way too well And art thou sure  That the soft poison which within thy veins  Lay unextinguish'd is not rouz'd a new  Is not this moment working thro' thy soul  Doft thou not love Confess  MASINISSA  What said my friend  Of poison love of loving  Sopkon sba  Yes I admire her wonder at her beauty  And he who does not is as dull as earth  The cold unanimated form of man  E'er lighted up with the celestial fire  Wheree'r she goes still admiration gazes  And listens while she talks Even thou thy self  Who saw'st her with the malice of a friend  Even thou thy self admir'st herDost thou not  Say speak sincerely  NARVA  She has Charms indeed  But has she charms like virtue Tho' majestic  Does she command us is her force like glory  MASINISSA  All glory's in her eye Perfection thence  Looks from his throne and on her ample brow  Sits majesty Her features glow with life  Warm with heroic soul Her mienshe walks  As when a towering goddess treads this earth  But when her language flows when such a one  Descends to sooth to sigh to weep to grasp  The tottering knee oh  Narva    Narva  oh  Expression here is dumb  NARVA  Alas my Lord  Is this the talk of sober admiration  Are these the sallies of a heart at ease  Of  Scipio  's friend And was it the calm sense  Of fair perfection that the while she kneel'd  For what you rashly promis'd seiz'd your soul  Stole out in secret transports from your eye  That writh'd you groaning round and shook your Frame  MASINISSA  I tell thee once again too cautious man  That when a woman begs a matchless woman  A woman once belov'd a fallen queen  A  Sophonisba  when she twines her charms  Around our soul and all her power of looks  Of tears of sighs of softness plays upon us  He's more or less than man who can resist her  For me my stedfast soul approves nay more  Exults in the protection it has promis'd  And nought tho' plighted honour did not bind me  Shall shake the happy purpose of my heart  Nought by th'avenging gods who heard my vow  And hear me now again  NARVA  And was it then  For this you conquer'd  MASINISSA  Yes and triumph in it  This was my fondest wish the very point  The plume of glory the delicious prize  Of bleeding years And I had been a brute  A greater monster than  Numidia  breeds  A horror to my self if on the ground  Cast vilely from me I th'illustrious fair one  Had left to bondage bitterness and death  Nor is there ought in war worth what I feel  In pomp and hollow state like this sweet sense  Of infelt bliss which the reflection gives me  Of saving thus such excellence and beauty  From her supreme abhorrence  NARVA  Masinissa  My friend my royal lord alas you slide  You sink from virtue On the giddy brink  Of fate you standOne step and all is loft  MASINISSA  No more no more if this is being lost  If this mistaken is forsaking virtue  And rushing down the precipice of fate  Then down I go far far beyond the din  Of scrupulous dull precautionLeave me  Narva  I want to be alone to find some Shade  Some solitary gloom there to shake off  This weight of life this tumult of mankind  This sick ambition on it self recoiling  And there to listen to the gentle voice  The sigh of peace something I know not what  That whispers transport to my heartFarewel  SCENE IV  NARVA  alone  Struck and he knows it notSo when the field  Elate in heart the warriour scorns to yield  The streaming blood can scarce convince his eyes  Nor will he feel the wound by which he dies  The End of the Second Act  ACT III SCENE I  MASINISSA  alone  _IN vain I wander thro' the shade for peace  'Tis with the calm alone the pure of heart  That there the goddess talksBut in my breast  Some busy thought some secreteating pang  Throbs inexpressible and rowls fromWhat  From charm to charm on  Sophonisba  still  Earnest intent devoted all to her  Oh it must out'Tis love almighty love  Returning on me with a stronger tide  I'll doubt no more but give it up to love  Come to my breast thou rosysmiling god  Come unconfin'd bring all thy joys along  All thy soft cares and mix them copious here  But why invoke I thee Thy power is weak  To  Sophonisba  's eye thy quiver poor  To the resistless lightning of her form  And dull thy bare insinuating arts  To the sweet mazes of her flowing tongue  Quick let me fly to her and there forget  This tedious absence war ambition noise  Even friendship's self the vanity of fame  And all but love for love is more than all  SCENE II  MASINISSA    NARVA  MASINSSSA  Welcome again my friendCome nearer  Narva    Lend me thine arm and I will tell thee all  Unfold my secret heart whose every pulse  With  Sophonisba  beatsNay hear me out  Swift as I mus'd the conflagration spread  At once too strong too general to be quench'd  I love and I approve it doat upon her  Even think these minutes lost I talk with thee  Heavens what emotions have possess'd my soul  Snatch'd by a moment into years of passion  NARVA  Ah  Masinissa    MASINISSA  Argue not against me  Talk down the circling winds that lift the desart  And touch'd by Heaven when all the forests blaze  Talk down the flame but not my stronger love  I have for love a thousand thousand reasons  Dear to the heart and potent o'er the soul  My ready thoughts all rising restless all  Are a perpetual spring of tenderness  Oh  Sophonisba Sophonisba  oh  NARVA  Is this deceitful day then come to nought  This day that set thee on a double throne  That gave thee  Syphax  chain'd thy deadly foe  With perfect conquest crown'd thee perfect glory  Is it so soon eclips'd and does yon sun  Yon setting sun who this fair morning saw thee  Ride through the ranks of long extended war  As radiant as himself with every glance  Wheeling the pointed files and when the storm  Began beheld thee tread the rising surge  Of battle high and drive it on the foe  Does he now blushing see thee sunk so weak  Caught in a smile the captive of a look  I cannot name it without tears  MASINISSA  Away  I'm sick of war of the destroying trade  Smooth'd o'er and gilded with the name of glory  Thou need'st not spread the martial field to me  My happier eyes are turn'd another way  Behold it not or if they do behold it  Shrunk up far off a visionary scene  As to the waking man appears the dream  NARVA  Or rather as realities appear  The virtue pomp and dignities of life  In sick disorder'd dreams  MASINISSA  Think not I scorn  The task of heroes when oppression rages  And lawless violence confounds the world  Who would not bleed with transport for his country  Tear every dear relation from his heart  And greatly die to make a people happy  Ought not to taste of happiness himself  And is lowsoul'd indeedBut sure my friend  There is a time for love or life were vile  A sickly circle of revolving days  Led on by hope with senseless hurry fill'd  And clos'd by disappointment Round and round  Still hope for ever wheels the daily cheat  Impudent hope unjoyous madness all  Till lÃ³ve comes stealing in with his kind hours  His healing lips his cordial sweets his cares  Infusing joy his joys ineffable  That make the poor account of life compleat  And justify the Gods  NARVA  Mistaken Prince  I blame not love But  MASINISSA  Slander not my passion  I've suffer'd thee too farTake heed old man  Love will not bear an accusation  Narva  NARVA  I'll speak the truth when truth and friendship call  Nor fear thy frown unkindThou hast no right  To  Sophonisba  she belongs to  Rome  MASINISSA  Ha she belongs to  Rome  'Tis trueMy thoughts  Where have you wander'd not to think of this  Think e'er I promis'd e'er I lov'dConfusion  I know not what I sayI should have lov'd  Tho'  Jove  in muttering thunder had forbid it  But  Rome  will not refuse so small a boon  Whose gifts are kingdoms  Rome  must grant it sure  One captive to my wish one poor request  So small to them but oh so dear to me  Here let my heart confide  NARVA  Delusive love  Thro' what wild projects is the frantick mind  Beguil'd by theeAnd think'st thou that the  Romans    The senators of  Rome  these gods on earth  Wise steady to the right severely just  All incorrupt and like eternal fate  Not to be mov'd will listen to the sigh  Of idle love They when their country calls  Who know no pain no tenderness no joy  But bid their children bleed before their eyes  That they'll regard the light fantastick pangs  Of a fond heart and with thy kingdom give thee  Their most inveterate foe from their firm side  Like  Syphax  to delude thee and the point  Of their own bounty on themselves to turn  Thou canst not hope it sureImpossible  MASINISSA  What shall I doBe now the friend exerted  For love and honour press me love and honour  All that is dear and excellent in life  All that or sooths the man or lifts the heroe  Bind my soul deep  NARVA  Rash was your vow my lord  I know not what to counselWhen you vow'd  You vow'd what was not in your power to grant  And therefore 'tis not binding  MASINISSA  Never Never  Oh never will I falsify that vow  E'er then destruction seize me Yes ye  Romans    If it be so there take your kingdoms back  Your royal gewgaws all for  Sophonisba  HoldLet me think a whileIt shall be so  By all th'inspiring gods that prompt my thought  This very night shall solemnize our vows  And the next joyous sun that visits  Afric    See  Sophonisba  seated on my throne  Then if they spare her notnot spare my queen  Perdition on their stubborn pride call'd virtue  Be theirs the world but  Sophonisha  mine  NARVA  And is it possible ye Gods that rule us  Can  Masinissa  in his pride of youth  In his meridian glory shining wide  The light of  Afric  and the friend of  Scipio    He take a woman to the nuptial bed  Who scorn'd him for a tyrant old and peevish  His rancorous foe and gave her untouch'd bloom  Her spring of charms to  Syphax  MASINISSA  Horrid friendship  This this has thrown a serpent to my heart  While it o'erflow'd with tenderness with joy  With all the sweetness of exulting love  Now nought but gall is there and burning poison  Yes it was soCurse on her vain ambition  What had her medling sex to do with states  The Business of men For him for  Syphax  Forsook for him my love for his gross passion  The thought is hellOh I had treasur'd up  A world of indignation years of scorn  But her sad suppliant witchcraft sooth'd it down  Where is she now That it may burst upon her  Bear her unbounded from me down the torrent  Far far away And tho' my plighted faith  Shall save her from the  Romans  yet to tell her  That I will never never see her more  Ha there she comesPernicious fair oneLeave me  SCENE III  SOPHONISBA    MASINISSA  SOPHONISBA  Forgive this quick returnThe rage confusion  And mingled passions of this luckless day  Made me forget another warm request  I had to beg of generous  Masinissa    For oh to whom save to the generous can  The miserable flyBut much disturb'd  You look and scowl upon me a denial  Repentance frowns on your contracted brow  Already weary of my sinking fate  You seem to droop and for unhappy  Syphax  I shall implore in vain  MASINISSA  For  Syphax  vengeance  And canst thou mention him Oh grant me breath  SOPHONISBA  I know young prince how deep he has prov ok'd thee  How keen he sought thy youth thro' what a fire  Of great distress from which you come the brighter  On dull indifferent objects or perhaps  Dislik'd a little 'tis but common bounty  To shower relief but when our bitterest foe  Lies sunk disarm'd and desolate then then  To feel the mercies of a pitying God  To raise him from the dust and that best way  To triumph o'er him is heroic goodness  Oh let unhappy  Syphax  touch thy heart  Victorious  Masinissa  MASINISSA  Monstrous this  Still dost thou blast me with that cursed name  The very name thy conscious guilt should shun  Oh had he heap'd all ills upon my head  While it was young and for the storm unfit  Had he but driven me from my native throne  From regal pomp and luxury to dwell  Among the forest beasts to bear the beam  Of red  Numidian  suns and the rank dew  Of cold unshelter'd nights to mix with wolves  To hunt with hungry tygers for my prey  And thirst with  Dipsas  on the burning sand  I could have thank'd him for his angry lesson  The fair occasion that his rage afforded  Of learning patience fortitude and hope  Still rising stronger on incumbent fate  And all that try'd humanity can dictate  But there is one curs'd bitterness behind  One injury the man can never pardon  That scorches up the tear in pity's eye  And even sweet mercy's self converts to gall  I cannotwill not name itHeart of anguish  Down down  SOPHONISBA  Ah whence this sudden storm this madness  That hurries all thy soul  MASINISSA  And dost thou ask  Ask thy own faithless heart snatch'd from my Vows  From the warm wishes of my springing youth  And given to that old hated monster  Syphax  Perfidious  Sophonisba  SOPHONISBA  Nay no more  With too much truth I can return thy charge  Why didst thou drive me to that cruel choice  Why leave me with my country to destruction  Why break thy love thy faith and join the  Romans  MASINISSA  By heavens the  Romans  were my better genius  Sav'd me from fate and form'd my youth to glory  But for the  Romans  I had been a savage  A wretch like  Syphax  a forgotten thing  The tool of  Carthage  SOPHONISBA  Meddle not with  Carthage    Impatient youth for that I will not bear  Tho' here I were a thousand fold thy slave  Not one base word of  Carthage  on thy soul  MASINISSA  How vain thy phrenzy Go command thy slaves  Thy fools thy  Syphaxes  but I will speak  Speak loud of  Carthage  call it false ungenerous  Yet shall I check me since it is thy country  While the  Romans  are the light the glory  SOPHONISBA  Romans  Perdition on the  Romans  and almost  On the too  Romans  are the scourge  Of the red world destroyers of mankind  The ruffians ravagers of earth and all  Beneath the smooth dissimulating mask  Of justice and compassion as if slave  Was but another name for civiliz'd  All vengeance on the  Romans  While fair  Carthage  Unblemish'd rises on the base of commerce  And asks of heaven nought but the general winds  And common tides to carry plenty joy  Civility and grandeur round the world  MASINISSA  No more compare them for the gods themselves  Declare for  Rome  SOPHONISBA  It was not always so  The gods declar'd for  Hannibal  when  Italy  Blaz'd all around him all her streams ran blood  All her incarnate vales were vile with death  And when at  Trebia    Thrasymene  and  Cannae    The  Carthaginian  sword with  Roman  blood  Was drunkOh that he then on that dread day  While lifeless consternation blacken'd  Rome    Had raz'd th' accursed city to the ground  And sav'd the worldWhen will it come again  A day so glorious and so big with vengeance  On those my soul abhors  MASINISSA  Avert  heaven  The  Romans  not enslave but save the world  From  Carthaginian  rage  SOPHONISBA  I'll bear no more  Nor tenderness nor life nor liberty  Nothing shall make me bear itPerish  Rome  And all her menial friendsYes rather rather  Detested as ye are ye  Romans  take me  Oh pitying take me to your nobler chains  And save me from this abject youth your slave  How canst thou kill me thus  MASINISSA  I meant it not  I only meant to tell thee haughty fair one  How this alone might bind me to the  Romans    That in a frail and sliding hour they snatch'd me  From the perdition of thy love which fell  Like baleful lightning where I most could wish  And prov'd destruction to my mortal foe  Oh pleasing fortunate  SOPHONISBA  I thank them too  By heavens for once I love them since they turn'd  My better thoughts from thee thouBut I will not  Give thee the name thy mean servility  From my just scorn deserves  MASINISSA  Oh freely call me  By every name thy fury can inspire  Enrich me with contemptI love no more  It will not hurt me  Sophonisba  Love  Long since I gave it to the passing winds  And would not be a lover for the world  A lover is the very fool of nature  Made sick by his own wantonness of thought  His feaver'd fancy while to your own charms  Imputing all you swell with boundless pride  Shame on the wretch who should be driven from men  To live with  Asian  slaves in one soft herd  All wretched all ridiculous together  For me this moment here I mean to bid  Farewel a glad farewel to love and thee  SOPHONISBA  With all my soul farewelYet ere you go  Know that my spirit burns as high as thine  As high to glory and as low to love  Thy promises are void and I absolve thee  Here in the presence of the listning gods  Take thy repented vowsTo proud  Cornelia  I'd rather be a slave to  Scipio  's mother  Than queen of all  Numidia  by the favour  Of him who dares insult the helpless thus  Pausing  Still dost thou stay behold me then again  Hopeless and wild a lost abandon'd slave  And now thy brutal purpose must be gain'd  Away thou cruel and ungenerous go  MASINISSA  No not for worlds would I resume my vow  Dishonour blast me then all kind of ills  Fill up my cup of bitterness and shame  When I resign thee to triumphant  Rome  Oh lean not thus dejected on the ground  The sight is miserywhat roots me here  Aside  Alas I have urg'd my foolish heart too far  And love depress'd recoils with greater force  Oh  Sophonisha  SOPHONISBA  By thy pride she dies  Inhuman prince  MASINISSA  Thine is the conquest nature  By heaven and earth I cannot hold it more  Wretch that I was to crush th' unhappy thus  The fairest too the dearest of her sex  For whom my soul could dyeTurn quickly turn  O  Sophonisha  my belov'd my glory  Turn and forgive the violence of love  Of love that knows no bounds  SOPHONISBA  And can it be  Can that soft passion prove so fierce of heart  As on the tears of misery the sighs  Of death to  to torture what it loves  MASINISSA  Yes it can be thou goddess of my soul  Whose each emotion is but varied love  All over love its powers its passions all  Its anger indignation fury love  Its pride disdain even detestation love  And when it wild resolves to love no more  Then is the triumph of excessive love  Didst thou not mark me mark the dubious rage  That tore my heart with anguish while I talk'd  Thou didst and must forgive so kind a fault  What would thy trembling lips  SOPHONISBA  That I must die  For such another storm so much contempt  Thrown out on  Carthage  so much Praise on  Rome    Were worse than death Why should I longer tire  My weary fate The most relentless  Roman  What could he more  MASINISSA  Oh  Sophonisba  hear  See me thy suppliant now Talk not of death  I have no life but theeAlas Alas  Hadst thou a little tenderness for me  The smallest part of what I feel thou wouldst  What wouldst thou not forgive But how indeed  How can I hope it Yet I from this moment  Will so devote my being to thy pleasure  So live alone to gain thee that thou must  If there is human nature in thy breast  Feel some relenting warmth  SOPHONISBA  Well well 'tis past  To be inexorable suits not slaves  MASINISSA  Spare spare that word it stabs me to the soul  My crown my life and liberty are thine  Oh give my passion way My heart is full  Oppress'd by love and I could number tears  With all the dews that sprinkle o'er the morn  While thus with thee conversing thus with thee  Even happy to distressEnough enough  Have we been cheated by the trick of state  For  Rome  and  Carthage  suffer'd much too long  And led by gaudy fantoms wander'd far  Far from our bliss But now since met again  Since here I hold thee circle all perfection  The prize of life since fate too presses hard  Since  Rome  and slavery drive thee to the brink  Let this immediate night exchange our vows  Secure my bliss our future fortunes blend  Set thee the queen of beauty on my throne  And make it doubly mineA wretched gift  To what my love could give  SOPHONISBA  What marry thee  This night  MASINISSA  Thou dear one yes this very night  Let injur'd  Hymen  have his rights restor'd  And bind our broken vowsThink serious think  On what I pleadA thousand reasons urge  Captivity dissolves thy former marriage  And if 'tis with the meanest vulgar so  Can  Sophonisba  to a slave to  Syphax    The most exalted of her sex be bound  Besides it is the best perhaps sole way  To save thee from the  Romans  and must sure  Bar their pretensions or if ruin comes  To perish with thee is to perish happy  SOPHONISBA  Yet must I still insist  MASINISSA  It shall be so  I know thy purpose it would plead for  Syphax  He shall have all thou dearest shall have all  Crowns trifles kingdoms all again but thee  But thee thou more than all  SOPHONISBA  Aside  Bear witness heaven  This is alone for  Carthage  To him  Gain'd by goodness  I may be thine Expect no love no sighing  Perhaps hereafter I may learn again  To hold thee dear If on these terms thou canst  Here take me take me to thy wishes  MASINISSA  Yes  Yes  Sophonisba  as a wretch takes life  From off the bleeding rackAll wild with joy  Thus hold thee press thee to my bounding heart  And bless the bounteous GodsCan heaven give more  Oh happy happy happyCome my fair  This ready minute sees thy will perform'd  From  Syphax  knocks his chains and I my self  Even in his favour will request the  Romans  Oh thou hast smil'd my passions into peace  So while conflicting winds embroil'd the Seas  In perfect bloom warm with immortal blood  Young  Venus  rear'd her o'er the raging flood  She smil'd around like thine her beauties glow'd  When smooth in gentle swells the surges flow'd  Sunk by degrees into a liquid plain  And one bright calm sat trembling on the main  The End of the Third Act  ACT IV SCENE I  SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA  PHOENISSA  _HAIL queen of  Masaesylia  once again  And fair  Massylia  join'd This rising day  Saw  Sophonisba  from the height of life  Thrown to the very brink of slavery  State honours armies vanquish'd nothing left  But her own great unconquerable mind  And yet ere evening comes to larger power  Restor'd I see my royal friend and kneel  In grateful homage to the Gods and her  Ye Powers what awful changes often mark  The fortunes of the great  SOPHONISBA  Phoenissa  true  'Tis awful all the wonderous work of fate  But ah this sudden marriage damps my soul  I like it not that wild precipitance  Of youth that ardor that impetuous stream  In which his love return'd At first my friend  He vainly rag'd with disappointed love  And as the hasty storm subsided then  To softness varied to returning fondness  To sighs to tears to supplicating vows  But all his vows were idle till at last  He shook my heart by  Rome  To be his queen  Could only save me from their horrid power  And there is madness in that thought enough  In that strong thought alone to make me run  From nature  PHOENISSA  Was it not auspicious madam  Just as we hop'd just as our wishes plan'd  Nor let your spirit sink Your serious hours  When you behold the  Roman  ravage check'd  From their enchantment  Masinissa  freed  And  Carthage  mistress of the world again  This marriage will approve then will it rise  In all its glory virtuous wise and great  While happy nations then deliver'd join  Their loud acclaim And had the white occasion  Neglected flown where now had been your hopes  Your liberty your country where your all  Think well of this think that think every way  And  Sophonisba  cannot but exult  In what is done  SOPHONISBA  So may my hopes succeed  As love alone to  Carthage  to the public  Led me a marriagevictim to the temple  And justifies my vowsHa  Syphax  here  What would his rage with me  Phoenissa  stay  But this one tryal moreHeroic truth  Support me now  SCENE II  SYPHAX    SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA  SYPHAX  You seem to fly me madam  To shun my gratulationsHere I come  To join the general joy and I sure I  Who have to dotage have to ruin lov'd you  Must take a tender part in your success  In your recover'd state  SOPHONISBA  'Tis very well  I thank you sir  SYPHAX  And gentle  Masinissa    Say will he prove a very coming fool  All pliant all devoted to your will  A glorious wretch like  Syphax  Ha not mov'd  Speak thou perfidious canst thou bear it thus  With such a steady countenance canst thou  Here see the man thou hast so grosly wrong'd  And yet not sink in shame And yet not shake  In every guilty nerve  SOPHONISBA  What have I done  That I should tremble that I should not dare  To bear thy presence Was my heart to blame  I'd tremble for my self and not for thee  Proud man Nor would I live to be asham'd  My soul it self would die could the least shame  On her unspotted fame be justly cast  For of all evils to the generous shame  Is the last deadlypangBut you behold  My late engagement with a jealous false  And selfish eye  SYPHAX  Avenging  Juno  hear  And canst thou think to justify thy self  I blush to hear thee traitress  SOPHONISBA  O my soul  Canst thou hear this this base opprobrious language  And yet be tamely calmWell well for once  It shall be soin pity to thy madness  Impatient spirit downYes  Syphax  yes  Yes I will greatly justify my self  Even by the consort of the thundering  Jove    Who binds the holy marriagevow be judg'd  And every public heart not meanly lost  In little low pursuits to wretched self  Not all devoted will absolve me too  But in the tempest of the soul when rage  Loud indignation unattending pride  And jealousy confound it how can then  The nobler passions how can they be heard  Yet let me tell thee  SYPHAX  Thou canst tell me nought  Away away nought but illusion falshood  SOPHONISBA  My heart will burst in honour to my self  If here I speak not tho' they rage I know  Can never be convinc'd yet shall it be  ConfoundedAnd must I renounce my freedom  Forgoe the power of doing general good  Must yield my self the slave the barbarous triumph  Of insolent enrag'd inveterate  Rome  And all for nothing but to grace thy fall  Nay by my self to perish for thy pleasure  For thee the  Romans  may be mild to thee  But I a  Carthaginian  I whose blood  Holds unrelenting enmity to theirs  Who have my self much hurt them and who live  Alone to work them woe what what can I  Hope from their vengeance but the very dregs  Of the worst fate the bitterness of bondage  Yet thou thou kind man wouldst in thy generous love  Wouldst have me suffer that be bound to thee  For that dire end alone beyond the stretch  Of nature and of law  SYPHAX  Confusion Law  I know the laws permit thee the gross laws  That rule the vulgar I'm a captive true  And therefore may'st thou plead a shameful right  To leave me to my chainsBut say thou base one  Ungrateful say for whom am I a captive  For whom these many years with war and death  Defeats and desolation have I liv'd  For whom has battle after battle bled  For whom my crown my kingdom and my all  Been vilely cast away For whom this day  This very day have I been stain'd with slaughter  With yon last reeking fieldFor one ye gods  Who leaves me for the victor for the wretch  I hold in utter endless detestation  Fire fury hellOh I am richly paid  But thus it is to love a womanWoman  The source of all disaster all perdition  Man in himself is social would be happy  Too happy but the gods to keep him down  Curs'd him with woman fond enchanting smooth  And harmless seeming woman while at heart  All poison serpents tygers furies all  That is destructive in one form combin'd  And gilded o'er with beauty  SOPHONISBA  Hapless man  I pity thee this madness only stirs  My bosom to compassion not to rage  Think as you list of our unhappy sex  Too much subjected to your tyrant force  Yet know that all we were not all at least  Form'd for your trifles for your wanton hours  Our passions too can sometimes soar above  The houshold task assign'd us can expand  Beyond the narrow sphere of families  And take in states into the panting heart  As well as yours ye partial to yourselves  And this is my support my joy my glory  The Conscience that my heart abhors all baseness  And of all baseness most ingratitude  This sure affronted honour may declare  With an unblushing cheek  SYPHAX  False false as Hell  False as your sex when it pretends to virtue  You talk of honour conscience patriotism  A female patriotVanityAbsurd  Even doating dull credulity would laugh  To scorn your talk Was ever Woman yet  Had any better purpose in her eye  Than how to please her pride or wanton will  In various shapes and various manners all  All the same plagues or open or conceal'd  The bane of life  SOPHONISBA  Must I then must I  Syphax    Give thee a bitter proof of what I say  I would not seem to heighten thy distress  Not in the least insult thee thou art fallen  So fate severe has will'd it fallen by me  I therefore have been patient from another  Such language such indignity had fir'd  My soul to madness But since driven so far  I mu stremind thy blind injurious rage  Of our unhappy Marriage  SYPHAX  HorrorOh  Blot it eternal night  SOPHONISBA  Allow me  Syphax  Hear me but once If what I here declare  Shines not with reason and the clearest truth  May I be base despis'd and dumb for ever  I pray thee think when unpropitious  Hymen  Our hands united how I stood engag'd  I need not mention what full well thou know'st  But pray recal was I not flatter'd young  With blooming life elate with the warm years  Of vanity sunk in a passion too  Which few resign Yet then I married thee  Because to  Carthage  deem'd a stronger friend  For that alone On these conditions say  Didst thou not take me court me to thy throne  Have I deceiv'd thee since Have I dissembled  To gain one purpose  pretended what  I never felt Thou  say I have  And if that  inspir'd  My marrying  cannot now  Be wrong Nay since my native city wants  Assistance more and sinking calls for aid  Must be more right  SYPHAX  This reasoning is insult  SOPHONISBA  I'm sorry that thou dost oblige me to it  Then in a word take my fullopen'd soul  All love but that of  Carthage  I despise  I formerly to  Masinissa  thee  Preferr'd not nor to thee now  Masinissa    But  Carthage  to you both And if preferring  Thousands to one a whole collected people  All nature's tenderness whate'er is sacred  The liberty the welfare of a state  To one man's frantic happiness be shame  Here  Syphax  I invoke it on my head  This set aside I careless of my self  And scorning prosperous state had still been thine  In all the depth of misery proudly thine  But since the public good the law supreme  Forbids it I will leave thee with a kingdom  The same I found thee or not reign my self  Alas I see thee hurtWhy cam'st thou here  Thus to inflame thee more  SYPHAX  Why sorceress why  Thou complication of all deadly mischief  Thou lying soothing specious charming fury  I'll tell thee whyTo breathe my great revenge  To throw this load of burning madness from me  To stab thee  SOPHONISBA  Ha  SYPHAX  And springing from thy heart  To quench me with thy blood  Phoenissa interposes  SOPHONISBA  Off give me way  Phoenissa  tempt not thou his brutal rage  Me me he dares not murder if he dares  Here let his fury strike for I dare die  What holds thy trembling point  PHOENISSA  Guards  SOPHONISBA  Seize the king  But look you treat him well with all the state  His dignity demands  SYPHAX  Goodness from thee  Is the worst deathThe  Roman  trumpetsHa  Now I bethink me  Rome  will do me justice  Yes I shall see thee walk the slave of  Rome    Forget my wrongs and glut me with the sight  Be that my best revenge  SOPHONISBA  Inhuman that  If there is death in  Afric  shall not be  SCENE III  LAELIUS    SYPHAX  LAELIUS  Syphax  alas how fallen how chang'd from what  I here beheld thee once in pomp and splendor  At that illustrious interview when  Rome  And  Carthage  met beneath this very roof  Their too great generals  Asdrubal  and  Scipio    To court thy friendship Of the same repast  Both gracefully partook and both reclin'd  On the same couch for personal distaste  And hatred seldom burn between the brave  Then the superiour virtues of the  Roman  Gain'd all thy heart Even  Asdrubal  himself  With admiration struck and just despair  Own'd him as dreadful at the social feast  As in the battle This thou may'st remember  And how thy faith was given before the Gods  And sworn and seal'd to  Scipio  yet how false  Thou since has prov'd I need not now recount  But let thy sufferings for thy guilt attone  The captive for the king A  Roman  tongue  Scorns to pursue the triumph of the sword  With mean upbraidings  SYPHAX  Laelius  'tis too true  Curse on the cause  LAELIUS  But where is  Masinissa  The brave young victor the  Numidian Roman  Where is he that my joy my glad applause  From envy pure may hail his happy state  Why that contemtuous smile  SYPHAX  Too credulous  Roman    I smile to think how that this  Masinissa    This  Rome  devoted heroe must still more  Attract thy praises by a late exploit  In every thing successful  LAELIUS  What is this  These public shouts A strange unusual joy  O'er all the captive city blazes wide  What wanton riot reigns to night in  Cirtha  Within these conquer'd walls  SYPHAX  This  Laelius  is  A night of triumph o'er my conqueror  O'er  Masinissa  LAELIUS  Masinissa  How  SYPHAX  Why he to night is married to my queen  LAELIUS  Impossible  SYPHAX  Yes she the fury she  Who put the nuptial torch into my hand  That set my throne my palace and my kingdom  All in a blazeshe now has seiz'd on him  Will turn him soon from  Rome  I know her power  Her lips distil unconquerable poison  O glorious thoughtwill sink this hated youth  Will crush him deep beneath the mighty ruins  Of falling  Carthage  LAELIUS  Can it be Amazement  SYPHAX  Nay learn it from himselfHe comesAway  Ye furies snatch me from his sight For hell  Its tortures all are gentle to the presence  Of a triumphant rival  LAELIUS  What is man  SCENE IV  MASINISSA    LAELIUS  MASINISSA  Thou more than partner of this glorious day  Which has from  Carthage  torn her chief support  And tottering left her I rejoice to see thee  To  Cirtha  welcome  Laelius  Thy brave legions  Now taste the sweet repose by valour purchas'd  This city pours refreshment on their toils  I order'd  Narva    LAELIUS  Thanks to  Masinissa  All that is well I here observ'd the king  But loosely guarded True indeed from him  There is not much to fear The dangerous spirit  Still not unworthy fear our matchless prize  Is his imperious queen is  Sophonisba  The pride the rage of  Carthage  live in her  How where is she  MASINISSA  She  Laelius  In my care  Think not of her I'll answer for her conduct  LAELIUS  Yes if in chains Till then believe me prince  It were as hopeful answering for the winds  That their broad pinions will not rouze the desart  Or that the darted Lightning will be harmless  As promise peace from herBut why so dark  You shift your place your countenance grows warm  It is not usual this in  Masinissa  Pray what offence can asking for the queen  The  Roman  captive give  MASINISSA  Laelius  no more  You know my marriage  Syphax  has been busy  It is unkind to dally with my passion  LAELIUS  Ah  Masinissa  was it then for this  Thy hurry hither from the recent battle  Is the first instance of the  Roman  bounty  Thus thus abus'd They give thee back thy kingdom  And in return are of their captive robb'd  Of all they valued  Sophonisba    MASINISSA  Robb'd  How  Laelius  Robb'd  LAELIUS  Yes  Masinissa  robb'd  What is it else But I this very night  Will here assert the majesty of  Rome    And mark me tear her from the nuptial bed  MASINISSA  Oh Gods oh patience As soon fiery  Roman  As soon thy rage might from her azure sphere  Tear yonder moonThe man who seizes her  Shall set his foot first on my bleeding heart  Of that be sureAnd is it thus ye treat  Your firm allies Thus kings in friendship with you  Of human passions strip themSlaves indeed  If thus deny'd the common privilege  Of nature what the weakest creatures claim  A right to what they love  LAELIUS  Out outFor shame  This passion makes thee blind Here is a war  Which desolates the nations has almost  Laid waste the world How many widows orphans  And lovelorn virgins pine for it in  Rome  Even her great senate droops her nobles fail  Her  Circus  shrinks her every  lustre  thins  Nature her self by frequent prodigies  Seems at this havock of her works to sicken  And our  Ausonian  plains are now become  A horror to the sight At each sad step  Remembrance weeps Yet her the greatest prize  It hitherto has yielded her whose charms  Are only turn'd to whet its cruel point  Thou to thy wedded breast hast taken her  Hast purchas'd thee her beauties by a sea  Of thy protector's blood and on a throne  Set her this day recover'd by their arms  Canst thou thy self thou think of it with patience  Nor to a  Roman  mention KingA  Roman  Would scorn to be a kingThe  Roman  people  Took liberty from out the very dust  And for great ages urg'd it to the skies  The dread of kings  MASINISSA  Be not so haughty  Laelius  It scarce becomes the gentle  Scipio  's friend  Suits not thy wonted ease the tender manners  I still have mark'd in thee I honour  Rome    But honour too my self my vows my queen  Nor will nor can I tamely hear thee threaten  To seize her like a slave  LAELIUS  I will be calm  This thy rash deed this unexpected shock  Such a peculiar injury to me  Thy friend and fellowsoldier has perhaps  Snatch'd me too far For hast thou not dishonour'd  By this last action a successful war  Our common charge entrusted us by  Scipio  MASINISSA  Ay there it isHas not thy vain ambition  Oh where is friendship plan'd her for thy triumph  To think on't death to think it is dishonour  At such a sight the warriour's eye might wet  His burning cheek and all the  Roman  matrons  Who line the laurel'd way asham'd and fad  Turn from a captive brighter than themselves  But  Scipio  will be milder  LAELIUS  I disdain  This thy surmise and give it up to  Scipio  Those passions are not comelyHere to morrow  Comes the proconsul Mean time  Masinissa    Ah harden not thy self in flattering hope  Scipio  is mild but steadyHa the queen  I think she hates a  Roman  and will leave thee  SCENE V  SOPHONISBA    MASINISSA  SOPHONISBA  Was not that  Roman Laelius  as I enter'd  Who parted gloomy hence  MASINISSA  Madam the same  SOPHONISBA  Unhappy  Afric  since these haughty  Romans  Have in this lordly manner trod thy courts  I read his fresh reproaches in thy face  The lesson'd pupil in thy fallen look  In that forc'd smile which sickens on thy cheek  MASINISSA  Oh say not so thou rapture of my soul  For while I see thee meditate thy charms  I smile as cordial as the sun in may  Deep from the heart in every sense of joy  I fondly smile  SOPHONISBA  Nay tell me  Masinissa    How feels their tyranny when 'tis brought home  When lawless grown it touches what is dear  Pomp for a while may dazle thoughtless man  False glory blind him but there is a time  When ev'n the slave in heart will spurn his chains  Nor know submission moreWhat said his pride  MASINISSA  His disappointment for a moment only  Burst in vain passionâª and  SOPHONISBA  You stood aba  'd  You bore his threats and tamelysilent heard him  Heard the fierce  Roman  mark me for his triumph  Oh bitter  MASINISSA  Banish that unkind suspicion  The thought enflam'd my soul I vow'd my life  My last  Massylian  to the sword ere he  Shou'd touch thy freedom with the least dishonour  But that from  Scipio    SOPHONISBA  Scipio  MASINISSA  That from him  SOPHONISBA  I tell thee  Masinissa  if from him  I gain my freedom from my self conceal it  I shall disdain such freedom  MASINISSA  Sophonisba  Thou all my heart holds precious doubt no more  Nor  Rome  nor  Scipio  nor a world combin'd  Shall tear thee from me till outstretch'd I lie  A nameless wretch  SOPHONISBA  If thy protection fails  Of this at least be sure be very sure  To give me timely death  MASINISSA  Cease thus to talk  Of death of  Romans  of unkind Ambition  My softer thoughts those rugged themes refuse  Can turn alone to loveAll all but thee  All nature is a passing dream to me  Fix'd in my view thou dost for ever shine  Thy form forthbeaming from the soul divineâª  A spirit thine which mortals might adore  Despising love and thence creating more  Thou the high passions I the tender prove  Thy heart was form'd for glory mine for love  The End of the Fourth Act  ACT V SCENE I  MASINISSA    NARVA  MASINISSA  _HAil to the joyous day With purple clouds  The whole horizon glows The breezy  Spring  Stands looselyfloating on the mountaintop  And deals her sweets around The sun too seems  As conscious of my joy with brighter eye  To look abroad the world and all things smile  Like  Sophonisba  Love and friendship sure  Have mark'd this day from out their choicest stores  For beauty rais'd by dignity and virtue  With all the graces all the loves embellish'd  Oh  Sophonisba  's mine and  Scipio  comes  NARVA  My lord the trumpets speak his near approach  MASINISSA  I want his secret audienceLeave us  Narva  SCENE II  SCIPIO    MASINISSA  MASINISSA  Scipio  more welcome than my tongue can speak  Oh greatly dearly welcome  SCIPIO  Masinissa  My heart beats back thy joyA happy friend  With laurel green with conquest crown'd and glory  Rais'd by his prudence fortitude and valour  O'er all his foes and on his native throne  Amidst his rescu'd shouting subjects set  Say can the gods in lavish bounty give  A sight more pleasing  MASINSSSA  My great friend and patron  It was thy timely thy restoring arm  That brought me from the fearful desartlife  To live again in state and purple splendor  And now I wield the sceptre of my fathers  See my dear people from the tyrant's scourge  From  Syphax  freed I hear their glad applauses  And to compleat my happiness have gain'd  A friend worth all O gratitude esteem  And love like mine with what divine delight  Ye fill the heart  SCIPIO  Heroic youth thy virtue  Has earn'd whate'er thy fortune can bestow  It was thy patience  Masinissa  patience  A champion clad in steel that in the waste  Attended still thy step and sav'd my friend  For better days What cannot patience do  A great design is seldom snatch'd at once  'Tis patience heaves it on From savage nature  'Tis patience that has built up human life  The nurse of arts and  Rome  exalts her head  An everlasting monument of patience  MASINISSA  If I have that or any virtue  Scipio    'Tis copy'd all from thee  SCIPIO  No  Masinissa    'Tis all unborrow'd the spontaneous growth  Of nature in thy breastFriendship for once  Must tho' thou blushest wear a liberal tongue  Must tell thee noble youth that long experience  In councils battles many a hard event  Has found thee still so constant so sincere  So wise so brave so generous so humane  So well attemper'd and so fitly turn'd  For what is either great or good in life  As casts distinguish'd honour on thy country  And cannot but endear thee to the  Romans  For me I think my labours all repaid  My wars in  Afric Masinissa  's friendship  Smiles at my soul Be that my dearest triumph  To have assisted thy forlorn estate  And lent a happy hand in raising thee  To thy paternal throne usurp'd by  Syphax  The greatest service could be done my country  Distracted  Afric  and Mankind in general  Was aiding sure thy cause To put the power  The public power into the good man's hand  Is giving plenty life and joy to millions  But has my friend since late we parted armies  Since he with  Laelius  acted such a brave  Auspicious part against the common foe  Has he been blameless quite has he consider'd  How pleasure often on the youthful heart  Beneath the rosy soft disguise of love  All sweetness smiles and seeming innocence  Steals unperceiv'd and lays the victor low  I would not cannot put thee to the pain  It pains me deeperof the least reproach  Let thy too faithful memory supply  The rest  Pausing  Thy silence that dejected look  That honest colour flushing o'er thy cheek  Impart thy better soul  MASINISSA  Oh my good lord  Oh  Scipio  Love has seiz'd me tyrant love  Inthralls my soul I am undone by love  SCIPIO  And art thou then to ruin reconcil'd  Tam'd to destruction Wilt thou be undone  Resign the towering thought the vast design  With future glories big the warriour's wreathe  The glittering files the trumpets sprightly clang  The praise of senates an applauding world  The patriot's statue and the heroes triumph  All for a sigh all for a soft embrace  For a gay transient fancy  Masinissa  For shame my friend for honour's sake for glory  Sit not with folded arms despairing weak  And careless all till certain ruin comes  Like a sick virgin sighing to the gale  Unconquerable love  MASINISSA  How chang'd indeed  The time has been when fir'd from  Scipio  's tongue  My soul had mounted in a flame with his  Where is ambition flown Hopeless attempt  Can love like mine be quell'd Can I forget  What still possesses charms my thoughts for ever  Throw scornful from me what I hold most dear  Not feel the force of excellence To joy  Be dead And undelighted with delight  Soft let me think a momentno no no  I am unequal to thy virtue  Scipio  SCIPIO  Fie  Masinissa  fie By heavens I blush  At thy dejection this degenerate language  What perish for a woman Ruin all  All the fair deeds which an admiring world  Hopes from thy rising day only to sooth  A stubborn fancy a luxurious will  How must it think you sound in future story  Young  Masinissa  was a virtuous prince  And  Afric  smil'd beneath his early ray  But that a  Carthaginian  captive came  By whom untimely in the common fate  Of love he fell The wise will scorn the page  And all thy praise be some fond maid exclaiming  Where are those lovers nowO rather rather  Had I ne'er seen the vital light of heaven  Than like the vulgar live and like them die  Ambition sickens at the very thought  To puff and bustle here from day to day  Lost in the passions of inglorious life  Joys which the careless brutes possess above us  And when some years each duller than another  Are thus elaps'd in nauseous pangs to die  And pass away like those forgotten things  That soon become as they had never been  MASINISSA  And am I dead to this  SCIPIO  The gods young man  Who train up heroes in misfortune's school  Have shook thee with adversity with each  Illustrious evil that can raise expand  And fortify the mind Thy rooted worth  Has stood these wintry blasts grown stronger by them  Shall then in prosperous times while all is mild  All vernal fair and glory blows around thee  Shall then the  dead Serene  of pleasure come  And lay thy faded honours in the dust  MASINISSA  O gentle  Scipio  spare me spare my weakness  SCIPIO  Remember  Hannibal  A signal proof  A fresh example of destructive pleasure  He was the dread of nations once of  Rome  When from  Bellona  's bosom nurs'd in camps  And hard with toil he down the rugged  Alps  Rush'd in a torrent over  Italy    Unconquer'd till the loose delights of  Capua  Sunk his victorious arm his genius broke  Perfum'd and made a lover of the heroe  And now he droops in  Bruttium  fear'd no more  Sinks on our borders like a scatter'd storm  Remember him and yet resume thy spirit  Ere it is quite dissolv'd  MASINISSA  Shall  Scipio  stoop  Thus to regard to teach me wisdom thus  And yet a stupid anguish at my heart  Repel whate'er he saysBut why my lord  Why should we kill the best of passions love  It aids the heroe bids ambition rise  Turns us to please inspires immortal deeds  Even softens brutes and makes the good more good  SCIPIO  There is a holy tenderness indeed  A nameless sympathy a fountainlove  Branch'd infinite from parents to their children  From child to child from kindred on to kindred  In various streams from citizen to citizen  From friend to friend from man to man in general  That binds supports and sweetens human life  But is thy passion suchList  Masinissa    While I the hardest office of a friend  Discharge and with a necessary hand  A hand tho' harsh at present really tender  I paint this passion And if then thou still  Art bent to sooth it I must sighing leave thee  To what the Gods think fit  MASINISSA  O never  Scipio  O never leave me to my self Speak on  I dread and yet desire thy friendly hand  SCIPIO  I hope that  Masinissa  need not now  Be told how much his happiness is mine  With what a warm benevolence I'd spring  To raise confirm it to prevent his wishes  O luxury to thinkBut while he rages  Burns in a fever shall I let him quaff  Delicious poison for a cooling draught  In foolish pity to his thirst shall I  Let a swift flame consume him as he sleeps  Because his dreams are gay shall I indulge  A frenzy flash'd from an infectious eye  A sudden impulse unapprov'd by reason  Nay by thy cool deliberate thought condemn'd  Resolv'd againstA passion for a woman  Who has abus'd thee basely left thy youth  Thy love as sweet as tender as the spring  The blooming heroe for the hoary tyrant  And now who makes thy sheltering arms alone  Her last retreat to save her from the vengeance  Which even her very perfidy to thee  Has brought upon her headNor is this all  A woman who will ply her deepest arts  Ah too prevailing as appears already  Will never rest till  Syphax  ' fate is thine  Till friendship weeping flies we join no more  In glorious deeds and thou fall off from  Rome  I too could add that there is something mean  Inhuman in thy passion Does not  Syphax    While thou rejoicest die The generous heart  Should scorn a pleasure which gives others pain  If this my friend all this consider'd deep  Allarm thee not not rouze thy resolution  And call the heroe from his wanton slumber  Then  Masinissa  's lost  MASINISSA  Oh I am pierc'd  In every thought am pierc'd 'Tis all too true  I wish I could refuse itWhither whither  Thro' what inchanted wilds have I been wandering  They seem'd  Elysium  the delightful plains  The happy groves of heroes and of lovers  But the divinity that breathes in thee  Has broke the charm and I am in a desart  Far from the land of peace It was but lately  That a pure joyous calm o'erspread my soul  And reason tun'd my passions into bliss  When love came hurrying in and with rash hand  Mix'd them delirious till they now ferment  To miseryThere is no reasoning down  This deep deep anguish this continual pang  A thousand things whene'er my raptur'd thought  Runs back a littleBut I will not think  And yet I mustOh Gods that I could lose  What a fond few hours memory has grav'd  On adamant  SCIPIO  But one strong effort more  And the fair field is thineA conquest far  Excelling that o'er  Syphax  What remains  Since now thy madness to thy self appears  But an immediate manly resolution  To shake off this effeminate disease  These soft ideas which seduce thy soul  Make it all idle unaspiring weak  A scene of dreams to puff them to the winds  And be my former friend thy self again  I joy to find thee touch'd by generous motives  And that I need not bid thee recollect  Whose awful property thou hast usurp'd  Need not assure thee that the  Roman  people  The senators of  Rome  will never suffer  A dangerous woman their devoted foe  A woman whose irrefragable spirit  Has in great part sustain'd this bloody war  Whose charms corrupted  Syphax  from their side  And fir'd embattled nations into rage  Will never suffer her when gain'd so dear  To ruin thee too taint thy faithful breast  And kindle future war No fate it self  Is not more steady to the right than they  And where the public good but seems concern'd  No motive their impenetrable hearts  Nor fear nor tenderness can touch such is  The spirit that has rais'd  Imperial Rome  MASINISSA  Ah killing truthBut I have promis'd  Scipio  Have sworn to save her from the  Roman  power  My plighted faith is pass'd my hand is given  And by the conscious gods who mark'd my vowsâª  The whole united world shall never have her  For I will die a thousand thousand deaths  With all  Massylia  in one field expire  Ere to the lowest wretch much more to her  I love to  Sophonisba  to my queen  I violate my word  SCIPIO  My heart approves  Thy resolution thy determin'd honour  For ever sacred be thy word and oath  Virtue by virtue will alone be clear'd  And scorns the crooked methods of dishonour  But thus divided how to keep thy faith  At once to  Rome  and  Sophonisba  how  To save her from our chains and yet thyself  From greater bondage this thy secret thought  Can best inform thee  MASINISSA  Agony Distraction  These wilful tearsO look not on me  Scipio  For I'm a child again  SCIPIO  Thy tears are no reproach  Tears oft look graceful on the manly cheek  The Cruel cannot weep Even Friendship's eye  Gives thee the drop it would refuse itself  I know 'tis hard wounds every bleeding nerve  About thy heart thus to tear off thy passion  But for that very reason  Masinissa    'Tis hop'd from thee The harder thence results  The greater gloryWhy should we pretend  To conquer rule mankind be first in power  In great assemblies honour place and pleasure  While slaves at heart while by fantastick turns  Our frantic passions rage The very thought  Should turn our pomp to shame our sweet to bitter  And when the shouts of millions meet our ears  Whisper reproachO ye celestial powers  What is it in a torrent of success  To bear down nations and o'erflow the world  All your peculiar favour Real glory  Springs from the silent conquest of ourselves  And without that the conqueror is nought  Save the first slaveThen rouze thee  Masinissa  Nor in one weakness all thy virtues lose  And oh beware of long of vain repentance  MASINISSA  Well well no moreIt is but dying too  SCENE III  SCIPIO  alone  I wish I have not urg'd the truth to rigour  There is a time when virtue grows severe  Too much for nature and even almost cruel  SCENE IV  SCIPIO    LAELIUS  SCIPIO  Poor  Masinissa    Laelius  is undone  Betwixt his passion and his reason tost  In miserable conflict  LAELIUS  Entering  Scipio    He shot athwart me nor vouchsaf'd one look  Hung on his clouded brow I mark'd despair  And his eye glaring with some dire resolve  Fast o'er his cheek too ran the hasty tear  It were great pity that he should be lost  SCIPIO  By heavens to lose him were a shock as if  I lost thee  Laelius  lost my dearest brother  Bound up in friendship from our infant years  A thousand lovely qualities endear him  Only too warm of heart  LAELIUS  What shall be done  SCIPIO  Here let it rest till time abates his passion  Nature is nature  Laelius  let the Wise  Say what they please But now perhaps he dies  Haste haste and give him hopeI have not time  To tell thee whatThy prudence will direct  Whatever is consistent with my honour  My duty to the publick and my friendship  To him himself say promise shall be done  I hope returning reason will prevent  Our farther care  LAELIUS  I fly with joy  SCIPIO  His life  Not only save but  Sophonisba  's too  For both I fear are in this passion mixt  LAELIUS  It shall be done  SCENE V  SCIPIO  alone  If friendship pierces thus  When love pours in his added violence  What are the pangs which  Masinissa  feels  SCENE VI  SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA  SOPHONISBA  Yes  Masinissa  loves meHeavens how fond  But yet I know not what hangs on my spirit  A dismal boding for this fatal  Scipio    I dread his virtues this prevailing  Roman    Even now perhaps deludes the generous king  Fires his ambition with mistaken glory  Demands me from him for full well he knows  That while I live I must intend their ruin  PHOENISSA  Madam these fears  SOPHONISBA  And yet it cannot be  Can  Scipio  whom even hostile fame proclaims  Of perfect honour and of polish'd manners  Smooth artful winning moderate and wise  Make such a wild demand Or if he could  Can  Masinissa  grant it give his queen  Whom love and honour bind him to protect  Yield her a captive to triumphant  Rome  'Tis baseness to suspect it 'tis inhuman  What then remainsSuppose they should resolve  By right of war to seize me for their prize  Ay there it killsWhat can his single arm  Against the  Roman  power that very power  By which he stands restor'd Distracting thought  Still o'er my head the rod of bondage hangs  Shame on my weaknessThis poor catching hope  This transient taste of joy will only more  Imbitter death  PHOENISSA  A moment will decide  Madam till then  SOPHONISBA  Would I had dy'd before  And am I dreaming here Here from the  Romans    Beseeching I may live to swell their triumph  When my free spirit should ere now have join'd  That great assembly those devoted shades  Who scorn'd to live till liberty was lost  But ere their country fell abhorr'd the light  Whence this pale slave he trembles with his message  SCENE VII  SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA  and to them a  SLAVE  with a letter and poison from  MASINISSA  SLAVE  kneeling  This Madam from the King and this  SOPHONISBA  HaStay  Reads the Letter  Rejoice  Phoenissa  Give me joy my friend  For here is liberty My fears are air  The hand of  Rome  can never touch me more  Hail perfect freedom hail  PHOENISSA  How what my queen  Ah what is this  Pointing to the poison  SOPHONISBA  The first of blessings death  PHOENISSA  Alas alas can I rejoice in that  SOPHONISBA  Shift not thy colour at the sound of death  For death appears not in a dreary light  Seem not a blank to me a losing all  Those fond sensations those enchanting dreams  Which cheat a toiling world from day to day  And form the whole of happiness they know  It is to me perfection glory triumph  Nay fondly would I chuse it tho' persuaded  It were a long dark night without a morning  To bondage far prefer it since it is  Deliverance from a world where  Romans  rule  Where violence prevailsAnd timely too  Before my country falls before I feel  As many stripes as many chains and deaths  As there are lives in  Carthage  Glorious charter  By which I hold immortal life and freedom  Come let me read thee once againAnd then  To thy great purpose  Reads the letter aloud  MASINISSA to his QUEEN  The Gods know with what pleasure I would have kept my faith to  Sophonisba  in another manner But since this fatal bowl can alone deliver thee from the  Romans  call to mind thy father thy country that thou hast been the wife of two kings and act up to the dictates of thy own heart I will not long survive thee  Oh 'tis wondrous well  Ye Gods of death who rule the  Stygian  gloom  Ye who have greatly dy'd I come I come  I die contented since I die a queen  By  Rome  untouch'd unsullied by their power  So much their terror that I must not live  And thou go tell the king if this is all  The nuptial present he can send his bride  I thank him for itBut that death had worn  An easier face before I trusted him  His poison tell him too he might have spar'd  These times may want it for himself and I  Live not of such a cordial unprovided  Add hither had he come I could have taught  Him how to dieI linger not remember  I stand not shivering on the brink of life  And but these votive drops which grateful thus  Taking them from the poison  To  Jove  the high  Deliverer  I shed  Assure him that I drank it drank it all  With an unalter'd smileAway  Drinks  SCENE VIII  SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA  SOPHONISBA  My friend  In tears my friend Dishonour not my death  With womanish complaints Weep not for me  Weep for thy self  Phoenissa  for thy country  But not for me There is a certain hour  Which one would wish all undisturb'd and bright  No care no sorrow no dejected passions  And that is when we die when hence we go  Ne'er to be seen again then let us spread  A bold exalted wing and the last voice  We hear be that of wonder and applause  PHOENISSA  Who with the patriot wishes not to die  SOPHONISBA  And is the sacred moment then so near  The moment when yon sun those heavens this earth  Hateful to me polluted by the  Romans    And all the busy slavish race of men  Shall sink at once and strait another state  New scenes new joys new faculties new wonders  Rise on a sudden round but this the gods  In clouds and horror wrap or none would live  How liberal is deathMethinks I seem  To touch the happy shoreBehind me frowns  A stormy sea with tossing mortals thick  While unconfin'd and green before me lies  The land of bliss and everlasting freedom  Where walk the mighty dead all of one mind  One blooming smile one language and one country  Oh to be theremy breast begins to burn  My tainted heart grows sickAh me  Phoenissa    How many virgins infants tender wretches  Must feel these pangs ere  Carthage  is no more  Softlead me to my couchMy shivering Limbs  Do this last office and then rest for ever  I pray thee weep not pierce me not with groans  The king too hereNay then my death is full  SCENE IX  SOPHONISBA    PHOENISSA    MASINISSA    LAELIUS    NARVA  MASINISSA  Has  Sophonisha  drank this cursed bowl  Oh horror horror what a sight is here  SOPHONISBA  Had I not drank  Masinissa  then  I had deserv'd it  MASINISSA  Exquisite distress  Oh bitter bitter fate And this last hope  Compleats my woe  SOPHONISBA  When will these ears be deaf  To misery's complaint These eyes be blind  To mischief wrought by  Rome  MASINISSA  Too soon too soon  Ah why so hasty But a little while  Hadst thou delay'd this horrid draught I then  Had been as happy as I now am wretched  SOPHONISBA  What means this talk of hope of coward waiting  MASINISSA  What have I done Oh heavens I cannot think  Without distraction hell and burning anguish  On my rash deedBut while I talk she dies  And how what where am I thenSay canst thou  Forgive me  Sophonisba  SOPHONISBA  Yes and more  More than forgive thee thank thee  Masinissa  Hadst thou been weak and dally'd with my freedom  Till by proud  Rome  enslav'd that injury  I never had forgiven  MASINISSA  I came with life  Laelius  and I from  Scipio  hasted hither  But Death was here before usthis vile poison  SOPHONISBA  With lifeThere was some merit in the poison  But this destroys it allAnd couldst thou think  Me mean enough to take itOh  Phoenissa    This mortal toil is almost at an end  Receive my parting soul  PHOENISSA  Alas my queen  MASINISSA  Dies dies and scorns meMercy  Sophonisba  Grant one forgiving look while yet thou canst  Or death it self the grave cannot relieve me  But with the furies join'd my frantic ghost  Will how  for everQuivering and pale  Have I done this  SOPHONISBA  Come nearer  Masinissa    Out stubborn nature  MASINISSA  Misery these pangs  To me transfer'd were easeA moment only  An agonizing moment while I have  An age of things to say  SOPHONISBA  We but for  Rome    Might have been happyRouze thee now my soul  The cold deliverer comesBe mild to  Syphax    In my surviving friend behold me still  Farewell'Tis doneO never never  Carthage    Shall I behold thee more  Dies  MASINISSA  Dead dead oh dead  Is there no death for me  Snatches  Laelius  's sword to stab himself  LAELIUS  Hold  Masinissa  MASINISSA  And wouldst thou make a coward of me  Laelius  Have me survive that murder'd excellence  Did she not stir Ha Who has shock'd my brain  It whirls it blazesWas it thou old man  NARVA  Alas alasgood  Masinissa  softly  Let me conduct thee to thy couch  MASINISSA  The grave  Were welcomeBut ye cannot make me live  Oppress'd with lifeOffcrowd not thus around me  For I will hear see think no moreThou sun  Keep up thy hated beams And all I want  Of thee kind earth is an immediate grave  Ay there she lyesWhy to that pallid sweetness  Can not I Nature lay my lips and die  Throws himself beside her  LAELIUS  See there the ruins of the noble mind  When from calm reason passion tears the sway  What pity she should perishCruel war  'Tis not the least misfortune in thy train  That oft by thee the brave destroy the brave  She had a  Roman  soul for every one  Who loves like her his country is a  Roman  Whether on  Afric  's sandy plains he glows  Or lives untam'd among  Riphoean  snows  If parentliberty the breast inflame  The gloomy  Libyan  then deserves that name  And warm with freedom under frozen skies  In farthest  Britain Romans  yet may rise  The End of the Fifth Act  EPILOGUE  By a FRIEND  Spoken by Mrs  CIBBER  NOW I'm afraid the modest taste in vogue  Demands a strong highseason'd epilogue  Else might some silly soul take pity's part  And odious virtue sink into the heart  Our squeamish author scruples this proceeding  He says it hurts sound morals and good breeding  Nor  Sophonisba  would he here produce  A glaring model of no private use  Ladies he bid me say behold your  Cato  What tho' no  Stoic  she nor read in  Plato  Yet sure she offer'd for her country's sake  A sacrifice which  Cato  could not make  Already now these wicked men are sneering  Some wresting what one says and others leering  I vow they have not strength forpublic spirit  That ladies must be your superior merit  Mercy forbid we should lay down our lives  Like these old  Punic  barbarous heathen wives  Spare  christian  bloodBut sure the devil's in her  Who for her country would not lose a pinner  Lard how could such a creature shew her face  HowJust as you do therethro'  Brussels  Lace  The  Roman  fair the public in distress  Gave up the dearest ornaments of dress  How much more cheaply might you gain applause  One yard of  Ribban  and two ells of  Gause  And  Gause  each deepread critic must adore  Your  Roman  ladies dress'd in  Gause  all o'er  Should you fair patriots come to dress so thin  How clear might all yoursentiments be seen  To foreign looms no longer owe your charms  Nor make their trade more fatal than their arms  Each  British  dame who courts her country's praise  By quitting these  outlandish  modes might raise  Not from yon powder'd band so thin and spruce  Ten ablebodied men forpublic use  But now a serious word about the play  Auspicious smile on this his first essay  Ye generous  Britons  your own sons inspire  Let your applauses fan their native fire  Then other  Shakespears  yet may rouze the stage  And other  Otways  melt another age  FINIS  A  NUPTIAL SONG  intended to have been inserted in the  Fourth Act  COME gentle  Venus  and asswage  A warring world a bleeding age  For nature lives beneath thy ray  The wintry tempests haste away  A lucid calm invests the sea  Thy native deep is full of thee  And flowering earth where'er you fly  Is all o'er spring all sun the sky  A genial spirit warms the breeze  Unseen among the blooming trees  The feather'd lovers tune their throat  The desart growls a soften'd note  Glad o'er the meads the cattle bound  And love and harmony go round  But chief into the human heart  You strike the dear delicious dart  You teach us pleasing pangs to know  To languish in luxurious woe  To feel the generous passions rise  Grow good by gazing mild by sighs  Each happy moment to improve  And fill the perfect year with love  Come thou delight of heaven and earth  To whom all creatures owe their birth  Oh come redsmiling tender come  And yet prevent our final doom  For long the furious god of war  Has crush'd us with his iron car  Has rag'd along our ruin'd plains  Has curs'd them with his cruel stains  Has clos'd our youth in endless sleep  And made the widow'd virgin weep  Now let him feel thy wonted charms  Oh take him to thy twining arms  And while thy bosom heaves on his  While deep he prints the humid kiss  Ah then his stormy heart controul  And sigh thy self into his soul  Thy son too  Cupid  we implore  To leave the green  Idalian  shore  Be he sweet god our only foe  Long let him draw the twanging bow  Transfix us with his golden darts  Pour all his quiver on our hearts  With gentler anguish make us sigh  And teach us sweeter deaths to die  ERRATA  PAGE  Line  read  fairseeming  instead of  fair seeming  Page  Line  read  Ere  for
