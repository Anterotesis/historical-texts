 ODE TO Mr PINCHBECK UPON HIS NEWLY INVENTED PATENT CANDLESNUFFERS By MALCOLM M  c  GREGGOR  Esq  Author of the Heroic Epistle to Sir WILLIAM CHAMBERS and the Heroic Postscript  Quosque ergo frustr√† pascemus ignigenum istum  Apuleii Met Lib  Why should a Patent be granted to this CandleSnuffer in vain  THE SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed for J ALMON opposite BurlingtonHouse Piccadilly  MDCCLXXVI  Price SIXPENCE  ADVERTISEMENT  EVER since my first Pulication the Curiosity not to say Anxiety of the World concerning my Name has been so great that it has frequently given me Pain to conceal what the World will now see it was not possibly in my Power to discover  In short I had no Name till the Royal Favour lately restored my very antient and honourable Clan to its pristine Title and Honours I was therefore in the same deplorable Case with a certain nameless Lady whom I have long had the Honour to call my Neighbour and who I sincerely hope will soon by the same Favour be restored to that Title which upon my Honour I believe she has erroneously and not intentionally forfeited  I have only to add that now when the Public is in possession of my real Name it will not I hope suffer any national Prejudice to prevent it from receiving  this my first Lyrical Attempt with its former Candour But I must needs say that if this Ode does not sell as well as Mr CUMBERLAND'S I shall be apt to impute it not to any inferiority of Lyrical Ordonance but merely to its having been written by a Scotchman  Knightsbridge  May    ODE TO Mr PINCHBECK  I  ILLUSTRIOUS PINCHBECK condescend  Thou wellbelov'd and best King'sFriend  These Lyric Lines to view  O may they prompt thee e'er too late  To snuff the Candle of the State  That burns a little blue  II  It once had got a stately Wick  When in its PatentCandlestick  The Revolution put it  As white as Wax we saw it shine  Thro' two whole Lengths of BRUNSWICK's Line  'Till Bfirst dar'd to smut it  III  Since thenbut wherefore tell the Tale  Enough that now it burneth pale  And sorely wastes its Tallow  Nay if thy Poet rightly weens  Though little skill'd in Ways and Means  Its Saveall is but shallow  IV  Come then ingenious Artist come  And put thy Finger and thy Thumb  Into each polish'd Handle  On thee alone our Hopes depend  Thy King's and eke thy Country's Friend  To trim Old England's Candle  V  But first we pray for its Relief  Pluck from its Wick each Tory Thief  It else must quickly rue it  These Initials like those in the Banns of Marriage published between N and M may be filled up at the Reader's Pleasure  Vide Common Prayer Book  While Nand Msputter there  Thou'lt ne'er prevent with all thy Care  The melting of the Suet  VI  There's TWITCHER too that old Hewitch  Sticks in his Bole as black as Pitch  Our ingenious Inventor's Snuffer  are peculiarly calculated to remedy this evil to which indeed all Candles are more or less subject  See the Patentee's Advertisement  And makes a silthy pother  When curst with such a sorry Fiend  And lighted too at either End  'Twill soon be in a smother  VII  I fear me much in sucha plight  Those Tapers blest would lose their Light  Canadian Fanes that deck  Which pious*ordains to blaze  And gild with their establish'd Rays  Our Lady of Quebec  VIII  It is humbly presumed that the classical Reader will here perceive a boldness of Transition only to be equalled by PINDAR and perhaps by HORACE in some of his sublimer Odes  His Arms thou hallowed Image bless  And surely thou canst do no less  He is thy Faith's Defender  Thou owest thy Place to him alone  As other Jacobites have done  And not to the Pretender  IX  Haste then and quash the hot Turmoil  That flames in Boston's angry Soil  And frights the MotherNation  Know Lady if its Rage you stop  PINCHBECK shall send you from his Shop  A most superb Oblation  X  His Patentsnuffers in a Dish  Of burnish'd Gold if more you wish  His Cyclops shall bestir  Their brawny Stumps and for thy sake  Of PINCHBECK's own Mixtmetal make  A huge Extinguisher  XI  To form the Massthy Zeal  Shall furnish that welltemper'd Steel  Thou didst at Minden brandish  Nor yet shall G's reverend Dean  Counting its Worth refuse I ween  His ponderous leaden Standish  XII  Poor Doctor JOHNSON I'm afraid  Can give but metaphoric Aid  His Style's caseharden'd Graces  M' PHERSON without Shame or Fear  Sir JOHN DALRYMPLE and SHEBBEARE  Shall melt their brazen Faces  XIII  And sure this mixt metallic Stuff  Will yield Materials large enough  To mold the mighty Cone  But how transport it when 'tis cast  Across the deep Atlantic Vast  'Twill weigh some thousand Stone  XIV  "Leave that to me" our Lady cries  "Howe'er gigantic be its Size  "I have a Scheme in petto  "I'll fly with it from Shore to Shore  "Safe as my sooty Sister bore  "Her Cottage to Loretto  XV  "Swift to the Congress with my Freight  "I'll speed and on their Heads its Weight  "Souse with such Skill and Care  "That PUTTNAM WASHINGTON beneath  "And grasping LEE shall wish to breathe  "  This great Philosopher has lately discovered a Method of fabricating a new Species of Air of so infinitely superior salubrity and duration to that vulgar atmospherical Air which for want of better we have been obliged to breathe for upwards of five thousand Years that it is to be supposed that no Macaroni Savoir Vivre or in plain English no body that knows what's what will in future condescend to respire any Air that is not sealed with the Doctor's own Arms and signed with his own Handwriting It is to be feared however that his Pneumatic Vials will be liable to be counterfeited as our Philosopher has not Interest enough at Court to procure a Patent Indeed were such a Patent granted it might supersede Mr PINCHBECK's because that in this Air a Candle is found to burn with so bright and continued a Flame that it could never want snuffing  See Vol II of Dr Priestley's Experiments on Air  A Pint of PRIESTLEY's Air  XVI  "The Deed is done thy Foes are dead  "No longer England shalt thou dread  "Such Presbyterean Huffers  "Thy Candle's Radiance ne'er shall fade  "With now and then a little Aid  "From PINCHBECK's Patentsnuffers"
