satisfy'd I'm in Love enough to be suspicious of every Body  San  And yet methinks Sir you should leave me out  Car  It may be so I can't tell but I'm not at Ease If they don't make a Knave at least they'll make a Fool of thee  San  I don't believe a Word on't But good faith Master▪ your Love makes somewhat of you I don't know what 'tis but methinks when you suspect me you don't seem  Man of half those Parts I us'd to take you for Look i  my Face 'tis round and comely not one hollow Line of  Villain in it Men of my Fabrick don't use to be suspecte  for Knaves and when you take us for Fools we never tak  you for wise men For my Part in this present Case I tak  myself to be mighty deep A Standerby Sir sees more than a Gamester You are pleas'd to be jealous of your poo  Mistress without a Cause she uses you but too well in my humble Opinion she sees you and talks with you till I am quite tir'd on't sometimes and your Rival that you are so  scar'd about forces a Visit upon her about once in a Fortnight  Car  Alas thou art ignorant in these Affairs He that's the civill'st receiv'd is often the least car'd for Women appear warm to one to hide a Flame for another Lorenzo in short appears too compos'd of late to be a rejected Lover and the Indifference he shews upon the Favours I seem to receive from her poisons the Pleasure I else should taste in them and keeps me upon a perpetual Rack NoI would fain see some of his jealous Transports have him fire at the Sight o'me contradict me whenever I speak affront me wherever he meets me challenge me fight me  San  Run you thro' the Guts  Car  But he's too calm his Heart's too much at Ease to leave me mine at Rest  San  For my Part Master I'm not so great a Philosopher as you be nor thank my Stars so bitter a Lover but what I seethat I generally believe and when Jacinta tells me she loves me dearly I have good Thoughts enough of my Person never to doubt the Truth on't See here the Baggage comes  Enter  Jacinta  with a Letter  Hist Jacinta my Dear  Jacin  Who's that Blunderbuss Where's your Master  San  Hard by  Shewing him  Jacin  O Sir I'm glad I have found you at last I believe I have travell'd five Miles after you and could neither find you at home nor in the Walks nor at Church nor at the Opera nor  San  Nor any where else where he was not to be found if you had look'd for him where he was 'twas ten to one but you had met with him  Jacin  I had Jackadandy  Car  But prithee what's the Matter Who sent you after me  Jac  One who's never well but when she sees you I think 'twas my Lady  Car  Dear Jacinta I fain would flatter myself but am not able the Blessing's too great to be my Lot Yet 'tis  not well to trifle with me how short soe'er I am in other Merit the Tenderness I have for Leonora claims something from her Generosity I should not be deluded  Jacin  And why do you think you are methinks she's pretty well above board with you what must be done more to satisfy you  San  Why Lorenzo must hang himself and then we are content  Jacin  How Lorenzo  San  If less will do he'll tell you  Jacin  Why you are not mad Sir are you Jealous of him Pray which Way may this have got into your Head I took you for a Man of Sense beforeIs this your Doings Log  To  Sancho  San  No forsooth Pert I'm not much given to Suspicion as you can tell Mrs ForwardIf I were I might find more Cause I guess than your Mistress has given our Master here But I have so many pretty Thoughts of my own Person Housewife more than I have of yours that I stand in dread of no Man  Jacin  That's the Way to prosper however so far I'll confess the Truth to thee at least if that don't do nothing else will Men are mighty simple in Lovematters Sir When you suspect a Woman's falling off you fall a plaguing her to bring her on again attack her with Reason and a sour Face Udslife Sir attack her with a Fiddle double your good Humourgive her a Ballpowder your Periwig at her let her cheat you at Cards a little and I'll warrant all's right again  Car  Say no more I have been to blame but there shall be no more on't  Jacin  I should punish you but justly however for what's past if I carry'd back what I have brought you But I'm good natur'd so here 'tis open it and see how wrong you tim'd your Jealousy  Car  reads  If you love me with that Tenderness you have made me long believe you do this Letter will be welcome 'tis to tell you you have Leave to plead a Daughter's  Weakness to a Father's Indulgence and if you prevail with him to lay his Commands upon me you shall be as happy as my Obedience to them can make you  LEONORA  Then I shall be what Man was never yet  Kissing the Letter  ten thousand Blessings on thee for thy News I could adore thee as a Deity  Embracing  Jacinta  San  True Flesh and Blood every Inch of her for all that  Car reads again  And if you prevail with him to lay his Commands upon me you shall be as happy as my Obedience to them can make you  O haypy happy Carlos But what shall I say to thee for this welcome Message    To  Jacinta  Alas I want Words But let this speak for me and this and this and  Giving her his Ring Watch and Purse  San  Hold Sir pray leave a little something for our BoardWages You can't carry them all I believe    To  Jacinta  Shall I ease thee of this  Offering to take the Purse  Jacin  No but you may carryThat Sirrah  Giving him a Box o'th' Ear  San  the Jade's grown Purseproud already  Car  Well dear Jacinta say something to your charming Mistress that I am not able to say myself But above all excuse my late unpardonable Folly and offer her my Life to expiate my Crime  Jacin  The best Plea for Pardon will be never to repeat the Fault  Car  If that will do 'tis seal'd for ever  Jacin  Enough but I must be gone Success attend you with the old Gentleman Goodby t'ye Sir  Exit  Jacin  Car  Eternal Blessings follow thee  San  I think she has taken them all with her the Jade has got her Apron full  Car  Is not that Lorenzo's Man coming this Way  San  Yes 'tis he Shall I draw him on a Scotch Pair of Boots Master and make him tell all  Car  Some Questions I must ask him call him hither  San  Hem Lopez hem  Enter  Lopez  Lop  Who calls  San  I and my Master  Lop  I can't stay  San  You can indeed Sir  Laying hold of him  Car  Whither in such Haste honest Lopez What upon some Love Errand  Lop  Sir your Servant I ask your Pardon but I was going  Car  I guess where but you need not be shy of me any more thy Master and I are no longer Rivals I have yielded up the Cause the Lady will have it so so I submit  Lop  Is it possible Sir Shall I then live to see my Master and you Friends again  San  Yes and what's better thou and I shall be Friends too There will be no more Fear of Christian Bloodshed I give thee up Jacinta she's a slippery Housewife so Master and I are going to match ourselves elsewhere  Lop  But is it possible Sir your Honour should be in Earnest I'm afraid you're pleas'd to be merry with your poor humble Servant  Car  I'm not at present much dispos'd to Mirth my Indifference in this Matter is not so thoroughly foem'd but my Reason has so far master'd my Passion to shew me 'tis in vain to pursue a Woman whose Heart is already another's 'Tis what I have so plainly seen of late I have rouz'd my Resolution to my Aid and broke my Chains for ever  Lop  Well Sir to be plain with you this is the joyfullest News I have heard this long Time for I always knew you to be a mighty honest Gentleman and good Faith it often went to the Heart o'me to see you so abused Dear dear have I often said to myself when they have had a private Meeting just after you have been gone  Car  Ha  San  Hold Master don't kill him yet  To  Car  aside  Lop  I say I have said to myself what wicked Things are Women and what Pity it is they should be suffer'd in a  Christian Country what a Shame they should be allow'd to play WillintheWisp with Men of Honour and lead them through Thorns and Briars and Rocks and rugged Ways till their Hearts are torn in Pieces like an old Coat in a FoxChace I say I have said to myself  Car  Thou hast said enough to thyself but say a little more to me Where were these secret Meetings thou talk'st of  Lop  In sundry Places and by divers Ways sometimes in the Cellar sometimes in the Garret sometimes in the Court sometimes in the Gutter but the Place where the Kiss of Kisses was given was  Car  In Hell  Lop  Sir  Car  Speak Fury what dost thou mean by the Kiss of Kisses  Lop  The Kiss of Peace Sir the Kiss of Union the Kiss of Consummation  Car  Thou ly'st Villain  Lop  I don't know but I may SirWhat the Devil's the Matter now  Aside  Car  There's not one Word of Truth in all thy cursed Tongue has utter'd  Lop  No Sir IIbelieve there is not  Car  Why then didst thou say it Wretch  Lop  Oonly in Jest Sir  Car  I am not in a jesting Condition  Lop  Nor Iat present Sir  Car  Speak then the Truth as thou wouldst do it at the Hour of Death  Lop  Yes at the Gallows and be turn'd off as soon as I've done  Aside  Car  What's that you murmur  Lop  Nothing but a short Prayer  Car  I am distracted and fright the Wretch from telling me what I am upon the Rack to know  Aside  Forgive me Lopez I am to blame to speak thus harshly to thee Let this obtain thy Pardon  Gives him Money  Thou see'st I'm disturb'd  Lop  Yes Sir I see I have been led into a Snare I have said too much  Car  And yet thou must say more nothing can lessen my Torment but a farther Knowledge of what causes my Misery Speak then Have I any Thing to hope  Lop  Nothing but that you may be a happier Batchelor than my Master may probably be a married Man  Car  Married say'st thou  Lop  I did Sir and I believe he'll say so too in a Twelvemonth  Car  O TormentBut give me more on't when now to who where  Lop  Yesterday to Leonora by the Parson in the Pantry  Car  Look to't if this be false thy Life shall pay the Torment thou hast given me Be gone  Lop  With the Body and the Soul o'me  Exit  Lopez  San  Base News Master  Car  Now my insulting Rival's Smile speaks out O cursed cursed Women  Enter  Jacinta  Jacin  I'm come in Haste to tell you Sir that as soon as the Moon's up my Lady will give you a Meeting in the CloseWalk by the BackDoor of the Garden she thinks she has something to propose to you will certainly get her Father's Consent to marry you  Car  Past Sufferance this Aggravation is not to be borne go thank herwith my Curses Flyand let them blast her while their Venom's strong  Exit  Car  Jacin  Won't thou explain What's this Storm for  San  And dar'st thou ask me Questions smoothfac'd Iniquity Crocodile of  Nile  Syren of the Rocks Go carry back the too gentle Answer thou hast receiv'd only let me add with the Poet  We are no Fools Trollop my Master nor me  And thy Mistress may goto the Devil with thee  Exit  Sancho  Jacinta  sola  Am I awakeI fancy not a very idle Dream this Well I'll go talk in my Sleep to my Lady about it and when I awake we'll try what Interpretation we can make on't  ACT II  Enter  Leonora  and  Jacinta  Jancin  YOU see me as much enrag'd at it as you are yourself yet my Brain is roving after the Cause for something there must be never Letter was receiv'd by Man with more Passion and Transport I was almost as charming a Goddess as yourself only for bringing it Yet when in a Moment after I come with a Message worth a dozen on't never was Witch so handled something must have pass'd between one and t'other that's sure  Leo  Nothing cou'd pass worth my enquiring after since nothing cou'd happen that can excuse his Usage of me he had a Letter under my Hand which own'd him Master of my Heart and till I contradicted it with my Mouth he ought not to doubt the Truth on't  Jacin  Nay I confess Madam I ha'nt a Word to say for him I'm afraid he's but a Rogue at bottom as well as my Shameless that attends him we are bit by my Troth and haply well enough serv'd for listning to the glib Tongues of the Rascals  Leo  Well Let him laugh let him glory in what he has done He shall see I have a Spirit can use him as I ought  Jacin  And let one Thing be your Comfort by the Way Madam that in spight of all your dear Affections to him you have had the Grace to keep him at Arms End You han't thank'd me for't but good Faith 'twas well I did not stir out of the Chamber that fond Night For there are Times the stoutest of us are in Danger the Rascals wheedle so  Leo  In short my very Soul is sir'd with this Treatment and if ever that perfidious Monster should relent tho' he shou'd crawl like a poor Worm beneath my Feet nay plunge a Dagger in his Heart to bleed for Pardon I charge thee strictly charge thee on thy Life thou do not urge a Look to melt me toward him but strongly buy me up in brave Resentment and if thou seest which Heav'ns avert a Glance of Weakness in me rouse to my Memory the vile Wrongs I have born and blazon them with Skill in all their glaring Colours  Jacin  Madam never doubt me I'm charg'd to the Mouth with Fury and if ever I meet that Traytor of mine such a Volly will I pour about his EarsNow Heav'n prevent all hasty Vows but in the Humour I am methinks I'd carry my MaidenHead to my cold Grave with me before I'd let it simper at the Rascal but come come Madam we'll be reveng'd on them never fear  Exeunt  Enter Don  Carlos  and  Sancho  Car  Repuls'd again This is not to be borne What tho' this Villain's Story be a Falshood was I to blame to hearken to it This Usage cannot be supported How was it she treated thee  San  Never was Ambassado worse receiv'd Madam my Master asks ten thousand Pardons and humbly begs one Moment's InterviewBe gone you Rascal you Madam what Answer shall I give my Master Tell him he's a Villain Indeed fair Lady I think this is hasty TreatmentHere my Footmen toss me this Fellow out at the Window and away she went to her Devotions  Car  Did you see  Jacinta  San  Yes she saluted me with halfascore Rogues and Rascals too I think our Destinies are much alike Sir And o'my Conscience a couple of scurvy Jades we are hamper'd with  Car  Ungrateful Women to receive with such Contempt so quick a Return of a Heart so justly alarm'd  San  Ha ha ha  Car  What no Allowance to be made to the first Transports of a Lover's Fury when rous'd by so dreadful an Appearance As just as my Suspicions were have I long suffer'd them to arraign her  San  No  Car  Have I waited for Oaths or Imprecations to clear her  San  No  Car  Nay even now is not the whole World still in suspence about her whilst I alone conclude her innocent  San  'Tis very true  Car  She might methinks thro' this profound Respect observe a Flame another would have cherish'd she might support me against groundless Fears and save me from a Rival's Tyranny she might release me from these cruel Racks and wou'd no doubt if she cou'd love as I do  San  Ha ha ha  Car  But since she don't what do I whining here Curse on the base Humilities of Love  San  Right  Car  Let Children kiss the Rod that fleas them let Dogs lie down and lick the Shoe that spurns them  San  Ay  Car  I am a Man by Nature meant for Power the Scepter's given us to wield and we betray our Trust whenever we meanly lay it at a Woman's Feet  San  True we are Men booCome Master let us both be in a Passion here's my Scepter  Showing a Cudgel  Subject Jacinta look about you Sir was you ev  r in Muscovy the Women there love the Men dearly why because  Shaking his Stick  there's your Lovepowder for you Ah Sir were we but wise and stout what Work shou'd we make with them But this humble Love making spoils them all A rare Way indeed to bring Matters about with them we are persuading them all Day they are Angels and Goddesies in Order to use them at Night like human Creatures we are like to succeed truly  Car  For my Part I never yet cou'd bear a Slight from any Thing nor will I now There's but one Way however to resent it from a Woman and that's to drive her bravely from your Heart and place a worthier in her vacant Throne  San  Now with Submission to my Betters I have another Way Sir I'll drive my Tyrant from my Heart and place myself in her Throne Yes I will be Lord of my own Tenement and keep my Houshold in Order Wou'd you wou'd do so too Master for look you I have been Servitour in a College at Salamancha and read Philosophy with the Doctors where I found that a Woman in all Times has been observ'd to be an Animal hard to understand and much inclin'd to Mischief Now as an Animal is always an Animal and a Captain always a Captain so a Woman is always a Woman Whence it is that a certain Greek says her Head is like a Bank of Sand or as another a solid Rock or according to a third a dark Lanthorn Pray Sir observe for this is close Reasoning and so as the Head is the Head of the Body and that the Body without a Head is like a Head without a Tail and that where there is neither Head nor Tail 'tis a very strange Body So I say a Woman is by Comparison do you see for nothing explains things like Comparisons I say by Comparison as Aristotle has often said before me one may compare her to the raging Sea for as the Sea when the Wind rises knits its Brows like an angry Bull and that Waves mount upon Rocks and Rocks mount upon Waves that Porpusses leap like Trouts and Whales skip about like Gudgeons that Ships roll like Beer Barrels and Mariners pray like Saints just so I say a WomanA Woman I say just so when her Reason is shipwreck'd upon her Passion and the Hulk of her Understanding lies thump thump thumping against the Rock of her Fury then it is I say that by certain Immotions which umcause as one may suppose a sort of Convulsiveyeshurricaniousumlikein short a Woman is like the Devil But here come the Crocodiles to weep us into Mercy  Enter  Leonora  and  Jacinta  Master let us shew ourselves Men and leave their briny Tears to wash their dirty Faces  Car  It is not in the Power of Charms to move me  San  Nor me I hope and yet I fear those Eyes will ook out sharp to snatch up such a Prize  Pointing to  Jacinta  Jacin  He's coming to us Madam to beg Pardon but sure you'll never grant it him  Leo  If I do may Heav'n ne'er grant me mine  Jacin  That's brave  Car  You look Madam upon me as if you thought I came to trouble you with my usual Importunities I'll ease you of that Pain by telling you my Business now is calmly to assure you but I assure it you with Heav'n and Hell for Seconds for may the Joys of one fly from me whilst the Pains of t'other overtake me if all your Charms display'd ever shake my Resolution I'll never see you more  San  Bon  Leo  You are a Man of that nice Honour Sir I know you'll keep your Word I expected this Assurance from you and came this Way only to thank you for't  Jacin  Very well  Car  You did imperious Dame you did How base is Woman's Pride How wretched are the Ingredients it is form'd of If you saw Cause for just Disdain why did you not at first repulse me Why lead a Slave in Chains that cou'd not grace your Triumphs If I am thus to be contemned think on the Favours you have done the Wretch and hide your Face for ever  San  Well argued  Leo  I own you have hit the only Fault the World can charge me with the Favours I have done to you I am indeed asham'd of but since Women have their Frailties you'll allow me mine  Car  'Tis well extremely well Madam I'm happy however you at last speak frankly I thank you for it from  my Soul I thank you but don't expect me greveling at your Feet again don't for if I do  Leo  You will be treated as you deserve trod upon  Car  Give me Patiencebut I don't want it I am calm Madam farewel be happy if you can by Heav'ns I wish you so but never spread your Net for me again for if you do  Leo  You'll be running into it  Car  Rather run headlong into Fire and Flames rather be torn with Pincers Bit from BitBut I am wrong this sounds like Passion and Heaven can tell I am not angry Madam I think we have no farther Business together your most humble Servant  Leo  Farewel t'ye Sir  Car  Come along  To  Sancho  Goes to the Scene and returns  Yet once more before I go lest you should doubt my Resolution may I starve perish rot be blasted dead damn'd or any other Thing that Men or Gods can think on if on any Occasion whatever Civil or Military Pleasure or Business Love or Hate or any other Accident of Life I from this Moment change one Word or Look with you  Going off  Sancho  clap him upon the Back  Leo  Content Come away Jacinta  Carlos  returns  Car  Yet one word Madam if you please I have a little Thing here belongs to you a foolish Bawble I once was fond of  Twitching her Picture from his Breast  Will you accept a Trifle from your Servant  Leo  Willingly Sir I have a Bawble too I think you have some Claim to you'll wear it for my Sake  Breaks a Bracelet from her Arm and gives it him  Car  Most thankfully this too I shou'd restore you if once was yours  Giving her a TableBook  By your Favour Madamthere is a Line or two in it I think you did me once the Honour to write with your own fair Hand Here it is  Reads  You love me  Carlos  and would know  The secret Movements of my Heart  Whether I give you mine or no  With yours methinks I'd never never part  Thus you have encourag'd me and thus you have deceiv'd me  San  Very true  Leo  I have some faithful Lines too I think I can produce 'em  Pulls out a TableBook reads and then gives it him  How long soe'er to sigh in vain  My Destiny may prove  My Fate in Spite of your Disdain  Will let me glory in your Chain  And give me Leave eternally to love  There Sir take your Poetry again  Throwing it at his Feet  'Tis not much the worse for my wearing 'till serve again upon a fresh Occasion  Jacin  Well done  Car  I believe I can return the Present Madam with a Pocket full of your ProseThere  Throwing a Handful of Letters at her Feet  Leo  Jacinta give me his Letters There Sir not to be behind hand with you  Takes a Handful of his Letters out of a Box and throws them in his Face  Jacin  And there and there and there Sir  Jacinta  throws the rest at him  San  'Cods my Life we want Ammunition but for a  hiftThere and there you saucy Slut you  Sancho  pulls a Pack of dirty Cards out of his Pocket and throws 'em at her then they close he pulls off her HeadCloaths and she his Wig and then part she running to her Mistress he to his Master  Jacin  I think Madam we have clearly the better on't  Leo  For a Proof I resolve to keep the Field  Jacin  Have a Care he don't rally and beat you yet tho' pray walk off  Leo  Fear nothing  San  How the Armies stand and gaze at one another after the Battle What think you Sir of shewing yourself a great General by making an honourable Retreat  Car  I scorn it  San  Sir  Car  I scorn it  San  Oh  Car  Oh Leonora Leonora A Heart like mine should not be treated thus  Leo  Carlos Carlos I have not deserv'd this Usage  Car  Barbarous Leonora but 'tis useless to reproach you she that is capable of what you have done is form'd too cruel ever to repent of it Go on then Tyrant make your Bliss compleat torment me still for still alas I love enough to be tormented  Leo  Ah Carlos little do you know the tender Movements of that Thing you name the Heart where Love presides admits no Thought against the Honour of its Ruler  Car  'Tis not to call that Honour into Doubt if conscious of our own Unworthiness we interpret every Frown to our Destruction  Leo  When Jealousy proceeds from such humble Apprehensions it shews itself with more Respect than yours has done  Car  And where a Heart is guiltless it easily forgives a greater Crime  Leo  Forgiveness is not now in our Debate if both have been in Fault 'tis fit that both should suffer for it our Separation will do Justice on us  Car  But since we are ourselves the Judges of our Crimes what if we should inflict a gentler Punishment  Leo  'Twould but encourage us to sin again  Car  And if it should  Leo  'Twould give a fresh Occasion for the pleasing Exercise of Mercy  Car  Right and so we act the Part of Earth and Heav'n together of Men and Gods and taste of both their Pleasures  Leo  The Banquet's too inviting to refuse it  Car  Then thus let us fall on and feed upon't for ever  Carries her off embracring her and kissing her Hand  Jacin  Ah Woman foolish foolish Woman  San  Very foolish indeed  Jacin  But don't expect I'll follow her Example  San  You wou'd Mopsy if I'd let you  Jacin  I'd sooner tear my Eyes out ahthat she had a little of my Spirit in her  San  I believe I shall sind thou hast a great deal of her Flesh my Charmer but 'twont do I am all Rock hard Rock very Marble  Jacin  A very Pumicestone you Rascal you if one wou'd try thee but to prevent thy Humilities and shew thee all Submission would be in vain to convince thee thou hast nothing but Misery and Despair before thee heretake back thy paultry Thimble and be in my Debt for the Shirts I have made thee with it  San  Nay if y're at that 'port Mistress I believe I shall lose nothing by the Balance of thy Presents There take thy Tobaccostopper and stop thy  Jacin  Heretake thy Sattin Pincushion with thy curious half Hundred of Pins in't thou mad'st such a vapouring about Yesterday Tell them carefully there's not one wanting  San  There's thy Ivoryhasted Knife again whet it well 'tis so blunt 'twill cut nothing but Love  Jacin  And there's thy pretty Pocket Scissars thou hast honour'd me with they'll cut off a Leg or an Arm Heav'n bless them  San  Here's the inchanted Handkerchief you were pleas'd to endear with your precious Blood when the Violence of your Love at Dinner t'other Day made you cut your FingersThere  Blows his Nose in it and gives it her  Jacin  The Rascal so provokes me I won't even keep his paultry Garters from him D'you see these You pitiful beggarly Scoundrel youThere take 'em there  She takes her Garters off and flaps them about his Face  San  I have but one Thing more of thine  Shewing his Cudgel  I own 'tis the Top of all thy Presents and might be useful to me but that thou may'st have nothing to upbraid me with e'en take it again with the rest of them  Lifting it up to strike her she leaps about his Neck  Jacin  Ah cruel SanchoNow beat me Sancho do  San  Rather like Indian Beggars beat my precious self  Rather let Infants Blood about the Streets  Rather let all the Wine about the Cellar  Rather let*Oh Jacintathou hast o'ercome  Throws away his Stick and embraces her  How foolish are the great Resolves of Man  Resolves which we neither would keep nor can  When those bright Eyes in Kindness please to shine  Their Goodness I must needs return with mine  Bless my Jacinta in her Sancho's Arms  Jacin  And I my Sancho with Jacinta's Charms  Exeunt  FINIS
