 The Vision  A POEM Being an ANSWER to the Lord  Beilhaven  's SPEECH  By a Person of Quality  COme hither ye Dreamers of Dreams  Ye Soothsayers Vizards and Witches  That puzzle the World with hard Names  And without any meaning make Speeches  Here's a Lord in the North  Near  Edinburgh  Frith  Tho little has been said of his Name or his Worth  He's seen such a Vision no Mortal can reach it  I challenge the Clan of  Egyptians  to match it  And first in the dark it was told him  Which might very well appall us  That the World was a fighting of old time  From  Nimrod  to  Sardanapalus    That it's all Revelation  You may pawn your Salvation  For the Devil a History gives the relation  But it's all in the Deeps no Mortal can reach it  We may challenge the Clan of  Egyptians  to match it  Then  Scotland  comes next on the Stage  For in Visions you must not be nice  And a skip of three thousand Years age  Is nothing where Men are Concise  I name it the rather  Because you may gather  How that every Man is the Son of his Father  A Truth for the future no Mortal can doubt  Whatever they might before he found it out  But heark now the Wonders begin  And take care least the Vision should fright ye  For if it should make you unclean  He has not told how he would dight ye  First the National Church  Left quite in the Lurch  Was a truckling down to the Steeple and Porch  But what is still worse she's afraid of her Friends  So Fevers make frantick Menhasten their Ends  Was ever such Conjuring known  Or the Church so claw'd by the Steeple  Nonjurors are her Champions grown  And the Prelatists vote for the People  Protesters appear  And the  Jacques  they adhere  And Antichrist votes the true Church to secure  O  Scotland  Was ever such Conjuring known  That the Mitre supports the same Church pull'd her down  Then the Nation in Sackcloth appear'd  And the Visionest sadly bewail'd her  For Mischiefs the like were ne'er heard  Her Priv'lege of Slavery fail'd her  For the Mob he complain'd  That being born Chain'd  Blest Bondage was lost and damn'd Freedom remain'd  So with Liberty scar'd and afraid to grow Rich  They su'd for Repentance in a dolorous Speech  And first our Amazement 'll increase  The Souldiers disbanded appear  Poor Drudges put Prentices to Peace  For want of the Blessings of War  For tho it's in the Book  Yet the Scripture mistook  When it told us our Swords should to Plowshares be broke  It might be long ago a Happiness there  But it's plain by the Vision it's otherwise here  The Merchants are next on the Stage  The Enchantment has circl'd them in  For fear they in Wealth should engage  They resolve they'll never begin  The Burghs are afraid  They shall have too much Trade  And the Nation to Plenty be safely betray'd  So they gravely Address that to keep them secure  As you find them you leave them both Foolish and Poor  The next is indeed a sad Sight  The like on't has rarely been known  'Twill ruin the Country quite  It will never recover its own  The Plow Man's undone  From Father to Son  For a terrible drawback on Corn will come on  In plenty they'll Ship it be there never so much  And to load us with Money sell all to the  Dutch    O ye Virgins both Sexes draw near  And tho it's but in Spectrum showen  In sympathy lend us a Tear  As the Case may sometime be your own  The Ladies Condition  Deserves your Compassion  'Tis very severe to make Beauty petition  Yet here his strange Tragedies turn'd to a Jigg  That the Men want Employments yet the Ladies shou'd Beg  Then a Crew of old Sailers were brought  At their true Benefactors to Rail  Their Freight for strange Nations was bought  And this will cut off the Entail  They thought it was hard  The  Dutch  Ships to discard  And to force the poor  Scots  their own Trade to regard  For Liberty claims a Freedom to ill  And it's hard to get Money against a Man's Will  And now the Exorcist in turn  Like a Ghost in a Circle arises  Without any Tears he can mourn  He is Extasies all and Surprises  But what's wildest of all  And does strangely appall  Two hours he talk'd and said nothing at all  But let drop a few hypocritical Tears  So the Crocodale weeps on the Carcase she tears  Then in strange Hebrew words he bewail'd ye  Tho the Jest was by few understood  Tu quoque mi fili Squadrone    Or in Scots  the Parliament  's  wood    So  Coesar  they say  Cry'd out in a fray  When they kill'd him because he'd his Country betray  For  Brutus  his Country's Liberty sought  Was a Simily e'resoon happily brought  Thus he rummag'd the Histories old  Like the Tale of the Bear and the Fiddle  For as 'twas unluckily told  So the Story broke off in the middle  Some said my Lord cry'd  Tho others deny'd  Which Matter of Moment it's hard to decide  But here's a more difficult Matter remains  To tell if he shew'd us less Manners or Brains  Printed at  Edinburgh  And Reprinted at  London  for  Benjamin Bragg  at the Black Raven in  PaternosterRow
