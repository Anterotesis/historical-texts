 A SERMON Preach'd in  LambethChapel  AT THE CONSECRATION OF THE Right Reverend Father in God JOHN Lord Bishop of BANGOR On  Sunday Jan  th  By  WILLIAM HAYLEY  DD Dean of  Chichester  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  within  Gray'sInnGate  next  Gray'sInnLane    A SERMON Preach'd at the Consecration of JOHN Lord Bishop of  Bangor  Ephes iv  And he gave some Apostles and some Prophets and some Evangelists and some Pastors and Teachersfor the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministery for the Edifying of the Body of Christ  THese Words contain the Substance of the Apostle's design both in this Chapter and in his more copious Discourse upon the same Subject in the th and th Chapters of his First Epistle to the  Corinthians  In which places he  gives us an Account of the  Government  instituted in the Church of Christ the diversity of its  Officers  and their  Gifts  and  Powers  the  Author  of the Institution and the Spring of their  Commission  together with the great  End  and Purpose for which this wise Administration was contriv'd and established Things of the highest Importance and very pertinent to the present  Occasion  And therefore I shall as far as the time allotted for my Discourse will permit take notice of these several things under the several Parts of my Text and then conclude with such  Observations  as naturally flow from this Doctrine  I Here is an Account of the several Orders entrusted with the Government of the Church  Some Apostles and some Prophets and some Evangelists and some Pastors and Teachers  II The Apostle here tells us who was the Author of this Establishment  He gave  even our  Lord Jesus Christ  himself who  descended into  the Grave  the lower parts of the Earth  and then  ascended far above all Heavens that he might fill all things  v  III We are here Instructed in the End and Design of this Dispensation And are made acquainted that all this was done  for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministery for the Edifying of the Body of Christ  I I begin with the first  The several Orders  c where it may be needful to shew that there was a  Disparity  in these Orders as to their Office and a  Subordination  in their Ministery To consider what they were wherein they differ'd and what were the peculiar  Employments  and  Powers  of each Office and to reflect upon the Goodness and Providence of God by which they have all been continued down to the present time and establish'd in this our Church  That there was a  Subordination  in the Office of the several Orders in the Christian Church Now this appears from St  Paul  's  Reasoning  and  Allusions  both here and in the other Epistle to the  Corinthians  At the th Verse of this Chapter he tells the  Ephesians  that the Church of Christ is  one Body  that  there is one Spirit one Lord one Faith one Baptism and one God and Father of all  and yet he adds at the th verse  But unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ  i e agreeably to the true meaning of the Original word  in this and other places to every one of us is given his  Office  or employment in the Church different according to the different gifts which it has pleased our Lord to bestow upon us  And this he exemplifies in the following Verse by representing our Saviour distributing these Gifts as  Conquerors  used to do when they made triumphal Entries into their Capital Cities after some notable Victories over their Enemies when we know it was usual to disperse among the People  Medals  of different Bigness and different Metal and other  Gifts  some of greater and some of lesser price Thus our Lord  Jesus  when he had conquered Satan and Sin and Hell and Death and made his Triumphant Entry into Heaven distributed the different Gifts of his holy Spirit in such  kinds  and such  proportions  as the Persons and Offices required to which  they were conveyed v  Wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men  some  Apostles  some  Prophets  c  But least the  Subordination  of the different Orders should not sufficiently appear from this  disparity  of their Gifts our Apostle renders it yet more evident  Cor  by comparing them to the several parts of the Body of man where he not only tells us at the v c that  there are diversities of Gifts differences of Administrations  and  diversities of Operations  but that these have a  relation  to and a  dependance  upon one another as the  Head  and  Hands  and  Feet  have in mans Body v  For as the Body is one and hath many Members and all the Members of that one Body being many are one Body so also is Christ  that is in his Body the Church Now we know in our Bodies the  Head  and  Hands  and  Feet  c are not only  different  but  subordinate  the Feet must walk by the direction of the  Eye  and the Hands act at the command of the  Head  otherwise the Actions will be  disorderly  and the whole Body must suffer And if there be not the like  regard in the Inferior Officers in the Church toward the Superior but all affect to direct them selves and to be the Head there can be nothing else but  Schism  and  Confusion  in it for  if all will be one Member where then is the Body  v  I shall crave leave only to add to this Head that this subordination of Ministers in the Church of Christ is agreeable to what was practis'd both under the Law of  Nature  and that of  Moses  I need not take notice of the  Heathen  World who were left to bare  Reason  in this matter among whom we every where find a  distinction  of dignity in the Orders of their Priests the thing being evident among the Worshippers of the  True  God who were not without some light of  Revelation  even under the Law of Nature long before the  Mosaical  dispensation  Abraham  himself paid Tithes to  Melchizedec  and was blessed by him and  without all contradiction the Less is blessed of the Greater  as the Author to the  Heb  argues c v The  Priesthood  was a natural right of  Primogeniture  at first and God by a particular Command order'd the  FirstBorn  to be Sanctified  to his Service and 'tis no question but these are the  Priests  which we read of before the giving of the Law  Exodus    The Lord said unto  Moses  go down charge the People least they break through unto the Lord to gaze and many of them perish and let the Priests also which come near to the Lord Sanctify themselves least the Lord break forth among them  And yet these first Born thus honour'd with the Priesthood were subject to the  Heads  of their  Families  and commanded by them Thus  Moses  and under him the Twelve Heads of  Tribes  and the Seventy Fathers of  Families  governed the Church till it pleased God to take to himself the Tribe of  Levi  instead of the  FirstBorn  and then the  HighPriest Priests  and  Levites  minister'd in the Service of God in an undeniable  Subordination  From all which I think it is very plain that a  Coordinate  ministery or a  Parity  among all such as are employed about holy things is a Scheme that never was found in any  Nation  or  Age  of the World it was never either Commanded of God or Invented by Men till the confusions of  Late  times brought it forth and  let the  Enemies  of our Church have the honour of it  The Subordination of these Offices being Establish'd we are now to consider what they were wherein they differ'd and what were the peculiar Employments and Powers of each Office Now in order to find out this we must compare the  Catalogue  of them in this place with the other in  Cor  Here it is  he gave some Apostles and some Prophets and some Evangelists and some Pastors and Teachers  There it is thus  God hath set some in the Church first Apostles secondarily Prophets thirdly Teachers  after which no more  Orders  are named but only those  Powers  that attended them in their work  Miracles Gifts of Healing  c and at v the Apostle asks  Are all Apostles are all Prophets are all Teachers  and without enquiring after more  Orders  asks only of the Exercise of such  Powers  as are before mentioned  Are all workers of Miracles Have all the gift of Healing Do all speak with Tongues Do all Interpret  Whence it seems very reasonable to infer that  Apostles Prophets and Evangelists  in the one place must be the same with  Apostles Prophets and Teachers  in the other and that  Pastors and Teachers  which are added over and above in my  Text  must not be different  Officers  from those before named but other  Words  for the same Officers relating to the different manner of receiving their  Commission  or the different parts of their Employments And therefore it is the Judgment of very Learned men that  Prophets and Evangelists  and  Prophets and Teachers  are the very same Ministers with  Pastors and Teachers  with this only difference that the  former  were such as out of the  FirstFruits  of the Believers were set apart and consecrated to their Office by the  Manifestation of the Spirit  or by a Supernatural effusion of Gifts proper to their Employments The  latter  were such as were Ordained and Constituted by  Imposition of Hands  as stated Governours of the Churches allotted to their Charge However this be it is plain that  Evangelists  in the one place are called  Teachers  in the other from their  Teaching  and Instructing their Converts and it seems as reasonable that Christian  Prophets  may be called  Pastors  from their  Feeding  and Governing their Flocks so that whether these are different  Names for the very same  Persons  or whether they signify the same  Office  but with this difference that the one respects it as given immediately by the  Holy Ghost  and the other by the Imposition of the Hands of the  Apostles  the result will be the same that there are only  Three  Orders properly here intended and that it is of their Office and Employments that we are to enquire  And I the rather encline to this Conclusion because it is agreeable to the  Promise  and  Prediction  of our  Saviour  himself while he was upon Earth  Mat    Behold I send to you Prophets and Wise men and Scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify  c Where there are only these Three Orders promis'd the  Second  of which though here first placed are called by the same name as in the  Text Prophets  The  Apostles  are called  Wise men  agreeably to their distinguishing Gift which we shall see by and by was the  Word of Wisdom  and therefore St  Luke  who was St  Paul  's Evangelist calls them by the same Name which St  Paul  himself gives them that of  Apostles  c v  Therefore also said the Wisdom of God I will send them Prophets  and Apostles and some of them shall they Slay and Persecute  c and for the  Third  sort our Saviour calls them  Scribes  from the nature of their Office for the Office of the  Scribes  was to Teach the Law and for this reason they are in the Gospels frequently call'd by the name of  Doctors  or  Teachers  of the Law So that  Evangelists  or  Teachers  under the Gospel whose Office was  parallel  to theirs might very properly bear the same  Name  for to  Teach  and  Preach the Gospel teaching and preaching Jesus Christ  are the same things in Scripture  Luk    Acts  Thus our Saviour built the  Christian  Church upon the Model of the  Jewish  and in condescension to that people and in pursuanee of the  Types  that preceded was pleased as it were to Copy their  HighPriest Priests and Levites  in the Orders of the Ministery which he establish'd under the Gospel  We are then in the next place to consider the different  Employments  of these Three Orders and the different  Powers  that enabled them to discharge the same And because the Higher always included the Lower it may not be amiss to begin with the Lowest  first and so to ascend to what was peculiar to the rest  The  Evangelists  or  Teachers  their business was properly to  preach  the Gospel to  Ʋnbelievers  to convince them of its Truth by working  Miracles  and to  Baptize  them upon their Conversion An account of which we have in the  th  c of the  Acts  where we are taught that the  Apostles  remaining at  Jerusalem  the rest were  dispersed into  Judea  and  Samaria  preaching the Word  And that particularly  Philip  who was one of the Seven  Deacons  and is called the  Evangelist went down to  Samaria  and preached Christ to them  v And that notwithstanding the Opposition of  Simon  the Sorcerer they  believed  Philip  preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ beholding the Miracles and Signs which were done and were Baptized both Men and Women  v  The  Prophets  besides this were to  preside  in the Assemblies of the  faithful  to perform Divine Offices Administer the Lords Supper and Instruct their Flocks in the Scriptures and in the fuller knowledge of the Truths of the Gospel and of this St  Paul  gives us a large Account in the c o  Cor  where he exhorts them to desire the gift of  Prophecy  rather than that of  Tongues  shewing that  Tongues were a Sign to them that believe not but Prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them that believe  v and he ocasionally mentions all the parts of the Christian Prophets Office in that Chapter his  Preaching  v  He that Prophesieth speaketh unto men to Edification and Exhortation and comfort  His  Praying  and  Singing  Praises v  I will pray with the Spirit and I will pray with the Ʋnderstanding also I will Sing with the Spirit and Sing with the Ʋnderstanding also  Which  Praying  and  Singing  are likewise in the Old Testament called  Prophesying  Kin Sam Chr  And last of all his Celebrating of the  Eucharist  v which is there called  Blessing  and  giving of Thanks  by all which he shews that the  Prophets  Office was peculiarly directed to the Edification of  Believers  and for this reason he tells them v  He that speaketh in an unknown Tongue edifieth himself but he that Prophesieth edifieth the Church  The  Apostles  besides all this had the Supreme  care of all the Churches  upon them they were to give  Orders  and  Rules  for their establishment to  Confirm  Converts  Ordain  Church Officers and  Govern  and  Direct  them when Ordain'd and by this means to preserve that  Peace  and  Order  which became the Church of Christ Thus we find in the forementioned th of the  Acts  v that  when the Apostles had heard that  Samaria  had receiv'd the Word of God  by  Philip  the  Evangelist they sent unto them  Peter  and  John the Apostles  who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost For as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were Baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost  That is the Powers and Gifts of the  Holy Ghost  which fitted them for the several parts of the  Ministery  for so we see it  Acts  when  Paul  hah laid his hands upon those Converts at  Ephesus the Holy Ghost came upon them and they spake with Tongues and Prophecyed  i e had the Power of  Miracles  and particularly that of  Tongues  given them to convert  Ʋnbelievers  and that of  Prophecy  to direct the  Faithful  And besides this we find the same Apostle c going over the several  Churches Confirming the Souls of the Disciples exhorting them to continue in the Faith ordaining them Elders  or Church Officers  in every Church  and then  commending them to the Lord on whom they believed  Such was the  Subordination  of  Officers  in the Church of Christ And it pleased our Lord to accommodate his  Gifts  to the Nature of their several Employments and these we have likewise laid down  Cor  c  To one is given by the Spirit the word of Wisdom to another knowledge by the same Spirit to another Faith by the same Spirit  Where the Gifts of  Wisdom Knowledge  and  Faith  Answer to the Three sorts of Ministers v  Apostles Prophets  and  Teachers  By  Faith  the gift of  Evangelists  or Teachers is meant the Faith of  Miracles  according to what our Saviour says to his Disciples  Mark    Have Faith in God for verily I say unto you whosoever shall say to this Mountain be thou remov'd and be thou cast into the Sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall  come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith  And from this  Stephen  is said  Acts  to be  full of Faith and Power and to do great wonders and Miracles among the People  And that this is the Faith here mentioned is evident from what follows which is an enumeration of some of the great  Powers  of this Faith  To one the gifts of Healing to another the working of Miracles  properly the casting out Devils  to another Prophecy  or foretelling things to come  to another discerning of Spirits to another divers kinds of Tongues to another the interpretation of Tongues  all Supernatural Powers for the convincing of Unbelievers and necessary for the first Preachers of Christianity who were  unlearn'd  and plain men and therefore preached Christ not by the Strength of human  Eloquence  and Persuasion but by the Testimony of  Miracles  and the demonstration of the Power of God  By  Knowledge  the gift of Christian  Prophets  seems to be meant the Understanding of the  Scripture  and the  Mysteries  of the Gospel how they were foretold in the Prophecies of old and how accomplish'd in our Saviour Jesus and therefore St  Paul  joyns  these things together  Cor    Though I have the gift of  Prophecy  and understand all  Mysteries  and all  Knowledge  and though I have all Faith so that I could remove Mountains and have no Charity I am nothing  And this Gift also was a necessary qualification for those who were to Instruct  Believers  and preach to the Assemblies of Persons converted whose knowledge was to be improv'd whose Faith was to be confirmed and whose Growth in the understanding of the Gospel was to be promoted by these Labourers in the Vineyard of Christ  But the principal Gift was that of  Wisdom  communicated to the  Apostles  the Supream Governours of the Christian Church to support them in the greatest and most difficult Task that of  Government  Wisdom to direct even the Preachers and Prophets themselves in their several Functions to contrive the most proper Methods for the  Planting  of Christianity and the most prudent Rules for the nourishing and  preserving  it and to find out the fittest  Instruments  for both Wisdom to Instruct them when to bear with  Patience  when to condescend with  Meekness  and when to resist with  Courage  and punish with  Vigor  A gift infinitely beyond any of the rest here mentioned though not appearing in the same pomp with the Miraculous operations of the Spirit which the  Corinthians  were for that reason too fond of Without this the  Preachers  might have been unruly the  Prophets  disorderly and the  zealous  themselves indiscreet and therefore it pleased the Wisdom of God to consult the Strength and Order and Peace of his Church by placing therein an Authority that might  preside  over the Subordinate Officers in it that might direct the  Imprudent  restrain the  Disorderly  encourage the  Laborious  and take care that all things might be done in that  Order  and  Decency  which becomes the Body of Christ  Thus does the  Wisdom  of God appear in settling the Oeconomy of his Church But we must in the Third place Adore his  Goodness  in having preserved this excellent Order to us however unworthy of so great a Blessing We have thanks be to the Divine Providence not only our  Priests  and  Deacons  answerable to the  Prophets  and  Evangelists  in my Text but we have the  Apostolical  Authority derived to us by a continued Succession of our  Bishops  from the Apostles themselves Such as these the Scripture tells us the Apostles committed their Authority to such have all ages of the Church acknowledged for the Successors of the Apostles and it has been by the Care and Conduct of such that  Heresies  have been conquer'd  Schisms  prevented or repair'd and the purity of the Christian  Faith  and  Discipline  handed down to our present times and therefore we have a great deal of reason to be thankful to Almighty God that among all the Confusions of this latter Age he has been pleased to preserve to us this inestimable advantage  Nor ought we to overlook the  Grace  and Mercy of God who in these times of difficulty has been pleased to give to the  present  Governours of our poor Church so plentiful an effusion of that  Spirit of Wisdom  which attended the Apostles their Predecessors and who constantly directs them in supplying the places of those whom their Lord calls away from their Labours with persons distinguish'd  with the visible  Characters  of the same Spirit with that  Wisdom which is from above first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of Mercy and good Fruits without Partiality and without Hypocrisy  And may God every day make us more  sensible  of the Greatness of this Blessing more  fruitful  under it and more  thankful  for it that he may be prevail'd upon to continue it down to our  Posterity  and to preserve his own Institution to the end of the World And this leads me to my Second General where I am to enquire after  II The  Author  of this Establishment And in this I need be but very short since he appears so visible in the Discourse of our Apostle in both the places I have mention'd 'Tis our  Lord Jesus  whom he declares to be the Original of these Orders and 'tis to his  Holy Spirit  that he tells us the Church is indebted for those several Gifts that accompany them v of this Chapter  To every one of us is given Grace  or Office  according to the measure of the gift of  Christ  When he led Captivity Captive  He  gave Gifts unto  men By  Christ  the whole Body is fitly joyned together and compacted by these  several Joynts v and  Cor    There are diversities of Operations but the same  Lord  and  God  hath set some in the Church first Apostles secondly Prophets  c v and he adds that their Gifts are the  manifestation of the Spirit  that though there be diversities of them yet they all proceed from that one  Spirit  And that  all these worketh that one and the same  Spirit  dividing to every man severally as he will  v So that whatever men may say out of an itch of  Novelty  or out of a design to  weaken  or  abolish  the Establishment to prove this Order to have been the effect of  Choice  and the result of human  Deliberation  must all vanish before the clear light of the word of God and we must see the  Divine  Original of our Church Government in spite of all the Labour that is taken to reduce it to the Inventions of  Men  Our  Lord  himself has raised his Spiritual Temple according to his own method and his Church is  built upon the Foundation of the Apostles and  Christian  Prophets  Jesus Christ  himself being the chief corner Stone  III We must therefore hasten to the Third thing to be considered the  end  and design of this Dispensation in these Words  For the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministry for the edifying of the Body of Christ  Now here are Three Excellent ends of this Order to which we must briefly give a distinct Consideration  The first is  The perfecting of the Saints  Or the Uniting the several Members of Christ's Church to  one another  and to himself their  Head  that by the Ministery of the different Parts his  Grace  and  Spirit  might be orderly conveyed to the whole  Body  for its Spiritual improvement and  Perfection  for so it follows v  Till we all come in the Ʋnity of the Faith and of the Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect Man unto the measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ  And this is consonant to what the Apostle says upon the same occasion  Cor  All this was done  That there should be no Schism in the Body but that the Members should have the same care one of another  The Second end is  The work of the Ministery  that it might be  regular  and  decent  and  successful  to that great end for which it was Ordained that all who are employed in it might be confin'd to their proper  Posts  and proper  Work  and not obstruct the progress of the Gospel by wandring out of their due Ranks and Stations that the  Feet  might not affect the work or place of the  Hands  and neither of them that of the  Head  but that they might remember that 'tis  God  who  hath set the Members every one in the Body as it has pleased him  and that  if they were all one Member there would be no Body    Cor  'Tis in pursuance of this that St  Paul  c commands that all things in the Christian Assemblies be done  decently and in Order  and that the Prophets themselves observe the Rules prescribed them telling them v that  the Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the Prophets for God is not the Author of confusion but of peace as in all Churches of the Saints  The third end is what follows from the blessing of God upon the work of the Ministery and that is the  Edifying of the Body of  of Christ  the confirming Believers in a sound  Faith  and a holy  Life  the former St  Paul  instances in at the th v  That we henceforth be no more Children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive  And the latter at v  this I say therefore and testifie in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their minds  And he joins both together at v  but speaking the truth in Love ye may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ  Thus have we consider'd the different  Orders  of the Ministery the  Author  of the Institution and the  Ʋsefulness  of it to the Church of Christ suffer me now to draw two or three Conclusions from what has been said which I shall do very briefly and so conclude  Is the Manifestation of the Spirit  given to every man to profit withall  Were these Orders Instituted not to gratifie the Vanity or Ambition of the  Persons  employ'd but to serve and feed the  Flock  of Christ then all those that are call'd to any holy Function  must remember that they are called to be  Watchful  and  Diligent  to deny themselves and to guide others to labour hard to bear much and to apply their whole Thoughts to acquit themselves to their great Master and to carry on the Salvation of those Souls which he has  purchas'd with his own Blood  And whoever shall through  Pride  or  Sloth  or  unconcern  neglect this work of the Lord or do it deceitfully he betrays a Sacred Trust abuses his Talents and will one day receive the bitter Sentence of the unprofitable Servant  Is  God  the Author of this Institution and is the  Church  edified by the work of its Pastors Then are they that  Labour in the Word and Doctrine  entitled to a  double Honor  both for the dignity of their  Commission  and the benefit that arises from their  Service  And therefore their Persons ought to be respected their necessities supplyed and their endeavours promoted by those that are committed to their Charge and they should be  esteemed very highly in Love both for their Master's and their Work's sake  And if there be any so bold as to despise their  Office or to contemn or prophane the sacred Functions in which they serve he must remember that he affronts God that sent them and injures the Church of Christ for whose good they were sent and must hereafter be accountable for both at the Tribunal of our Lord  Lastly did our Saviour  Institute  and has he  preserv'd  in his Church such a  Subordination  of Ministers as we have describ'd and for such excellent  Ends  Men ought then to be very careful of breaking in upon this establishment both as they tender the honour of our  Saviour  and the good of his  Church  Sure it must be bold to pretend to alter by  Human  Authority or for reasons of our own what was settled by the Authority of our  Lord  for reasons of such weight as the  perfecting of the Saints the work of the Ministry and the edifying of the Body of Christ  Nor can it well be imagin'd that they are true Friends to the  Edification of Christ's Body  to  purity  of Doctrine or  Holiness  of Life or the  Ʋnity  of the Church who would innovate in these things and alter that Form of Church Government which the Wisdom of  Christ our head establish'd for this end for the  Beauty  and order of his Body and for the  Happiness  of its Members May we therefore be truly thankful to God for the preservation of this  primitive  Government May we be zealous for it's  Honour  and  Support  and  Continuance  and above all may the Persons employed in it be a  Grace  and  Ornament  to their Function May the Piety and Wisdom of our  Fathers  and the Labours and Order of their  Clergy  make the Ministry of the Church of  England  a Pattern for the Governours and Pastors of all other Churches And may God give a visible Blessing to their endeavours in rendring their  Flocks  discernable from the rest of the Christian World in purity of  Faith  rectitude of  Manners  and union of  Hearts  That so Imitating the Apostolical Churches in Doctrine Practice and Discipline we may be an Exemplary Part of the Church  Militant  in this World and a Glorious Part of the Church  Triumphant  in a Future  Amen  FINIS
