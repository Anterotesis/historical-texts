 A COLLECTION Of the Moral and Instructive SENTIMENTS MAXIMS CAUTIONS and REFLEXIONS Contained in the Histories of PAMELA CLARISSA and Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  Digested under Proper HEADS With

DODSLEY in  PallMall  And J LEAKE at  Bath  MDCCLV  PREFACE  By a FRIEND  _PLUTARCH  that justly admired philosopher who has greatly obliged the world by his writings and amongst these by the many curious  Apophthegms  he has given us of the wise and good men of antiquity tells us  "That Socrates meeting one day with Menon whom he considered as a man well exercised in all the varieties of conversation as well as a great proficient in speculative wisdom ask'd him WHAT IS VIRTUE And that Menon answer'd There were proper virtues for Youth and Oldage  for Man and Woman for Magistrate and Private person for Master and Servant An answer which the writer says excited the admiration and applause of Socrates"  But what would this wise heathen have said and how much greater would have been his transport had his friend Menon by way of answer presented him with writings in which he had entered minutely into  the nature of the Virtues  proper for such different  Ages Sexes  and  Stations  had he described these social excellencies so  affectingly  as to command attention so  accurately  as to prevent mistake and so  invitingly  as to engage imitation  But a delineation of moral Virtue like this was beyond the powers of human  Reason  and the utmost efforts of antient  Philosophy  And it is to REVELATION that  greater light  to rule the moral world that we owe the more perfect knowledge not only of  Religion  in matters relative to GOD but of  Virtue  also in matters relative to  ourselves and one another  No wonder therefore that what Menon only mentioned in the general and what even Socrates could not have described justly in the particulars should have been executed in these  latter times with greater clearness and precision  And yet whatever improvements have been made by Christians in the system of Moral Duty how powerfully soever men are now exhorted to act like  reasonable  and  religious  beings how strongly soever those exhortations are enforced by the surer and more animating sanctions of the Gospel yetis it not too visible that immorality and irreligion still obtain in the lives of  many  and perhaps dreadful thought of the  majority  And shall not every man who is convinced of the real importance of virtuous principles and practices and of the very frequent apostasy from them stand forth and prevent as far as in him lies this alarming degeneracy from growing more prevalent  Many it is acknowledged with pleasure and with gratitude have been the laudable attempts of writers in our own country to obtain this end and these both from the  clergy  and  laity  And a valuable accession has been made within the last fourteen years by an author modestly  anonymous  in his Three Works called PAMELA CLARISSA and  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON Works which amiably illustrate and strongly enforce the proper Virtues of  Man and Woman Parent and Child Oldage and Youth Master and Servant  Each of them commuicated in  a regular collection of Familiar Letters  "written to the moment while the heart is agitated by hopes and fears on events undecided"  A method which must engage more strongly and prove far more interesting to the reader than a cold unanimating narrative of events long since determined  With such a knowledge of life and manners as is displayed in those Works with a capacity to entertain with wit and enliven with humour as well as to correct with delicacy and exhort with dignity we cannot but greatly respect the man who in an age  like this  has attempted to steal upon the world  reformation  under the notion of  amusement  who has found the expedient of engaging the  private attention  of those who put themselves out of the reach of  public exhortation  pursuing to their  closets  those who fly from the  pulpit  and there under the gay air and captivating semblance of a  Novel  tempting  them to the perusal of many a persuasive  Sermon  In order to render these Letters more completely useful in this volume are collected their various important  Maxims  digested under their general heads with  references  from each Maxim to its proper volume and page A work this that has not been more productive of trouble than I presume it will be of entertainment and advantage  Sententious Maxims  and  Moral Aphorisms  collecting into a point and concisely but strongly expressing  elevated thoughts beautiful sentiments  or  instructive lessons  have always been well received by the public They have been considered as the first strokes of a picture in which are seen the justness and beauty of the painter's design though it has not the colouring  The  maxims of state  for instance drawn up by Lord HALIFAX have been greatly esteemed as being the result of long experience and sound policy And the  maxims  of ROCHEFOUCAULT have met with a reception perhaps too favourable as their tendency  seems to be to  disgrace human nature  and  destroy all the virtues  And indeed the translator of them says  "I must confess I have not read any thing in this age that has given me a greater  contempt  for man"  The very reverse of this is the plan on which the following Maxims are grounded namely on  the real  dignity  of human nature  in order to animate man to act up to his genuine greatness  "It exhibits man as he really is a compound probationary being fallen indeed from the primitive  perfection  of his nature yet still great and amiable in the  sincerity  of his virtues frequently rebelling against the sacred laws of reason and revelation and then always an enemy to his own happiness and the peace of society But sometimes so worthily improving the graces and the gifts of heaven as to secure the blessing of others and the applause of his own mind and advancing within his proper sphere of action the salvation of himself and his fellowcreatures by a life exemplary in all the duties of a Man and of a Christian"  Such is the great plan such the benevolent  scheme of those three collections of  Familiar Letters  which have been already translated into several foreign languages and received in our own country with uncommon favour But as the  narrative  part of those Letters was only meant as a vehicle for the  instructive  no wonder that many readers who are desirous of fixing in their minds those maxims which deserve notice distinct from the story that first introduced them should have often wished and pressed to see them separate from that chain of engaging incidents that will sometimes steal the most fixed attention from its pursuit of serious truth  For the use therefore of all such as are desirous of  repeatedly inculcating  on their own minds and the minds of others the important  Maxims  which those three works contain and who would  refer  themselves occasionally to the volumes for the illustration of these maxims this  General Index  both of  Maxims  and of  References  is now offered to the public in one pocket volume  I shall only remark farther that the  Histories  may be considered as the LIVES of so many eminent persons and this collection of  Maxims  as the MORALS And I presume to add with all due deference to the sentiments of othersthat  These Lives and Morals  will perhaps last as long probably be as much admired and certainly prove much more extensively beneficial as they describe persons exemplary in  private  and  common  life than the  Lives and Morals  of the HEROES of the truly illustrious philosopher mentioned in the beginning of this Preface  A COLLECTION OF THE Moral  and  Instructive SENTIMENTS Contained in the History of  PAMELA  The Numerals i ii iii iv denote the Volumes the first Figures refer to the Octavo Edition those inclosed thus to the  d  and subsequent Editions of the Twelves  A  Address  to the Rich  _HOW great will be the condemnation of the Rich at the great Day of Account when they shall be asked What uses they made of the opportunities put into their hand to do good to their indigent fellow creatures and are able only to say  "We have lived but to ourselves We heaped up treasures for those who came after us tho' we knew not but  they  would make a still worse use of them than we ourselves have done"  ii  Little knows the narrowminded man the pleasures that fill the heart of a beneficent person on reflecting on the good he has been enabled to do to worthy objects ii  See  Beneficence  The  Rich  Advantages  of Men over Women owing to Women themselves  THE love of praise and to be flattered and admired which predominates in the sex from sixteen to sixty gives the men great advantages over them iv  The readiness with which women are apt to forgive the men who have deceived other women  And that inconsiderate notion of too many of them  that a reformed rake makes the best husband  are great encouragements to vile men to continue their profligacy iv seq seq  Virtue and Sobriety are surely as beautiful parts of a man's character as of a woman's The most abandon'd of men think these Graces indispensable in the women they hope to marryShall women of prudence dispense with them in the men they choose for partners for life iv  The foolish vanity which some women have in the hopes of reforming a wild young fellow which others of their sex have in vain tried to do has often cost them the happiness of their lives and given at the same time great encouragement to men to continue in their guilt and to add to their other vices that of hypocrisy if they think the object a prize worth feigning for iv  The cruelty of women to an unhappy creature who has been betrayed by the perfidy of her Lover while they scruple not to admit among them the vile seducer is another great encouragement to base and artful men iv    See  Advice  to Young Women  Female  Dignity  Love  Adversity  PERSONS may the rather hope to be extricated from difficulties and distresses if they have not involved themselves in them by their vanity and presumption i  In some apprehended evils the very event we dread often brings relief i  What we look upon as our greatest unhappiness in a difficulty we are involved in may possibly be the evil hastening to its crisis and happy days may ensue i  How knows a person struggling with Calamity what ends the Almighty has to bring about by the trials he is exercised with Was not  Joseph  's exaltation owing to his unjust imprisonment i  Distresses however heavy at the time appear light and even joyous to the reflecting mind when worthily overcome ii  In a deep distress we are apt to engage every body in it and to wonder that things animate and inanimate wear the same face they did while our hearts were free and easy iv  See  Beneficence Resignation  Advice  to young married Women  YOUNG married Women who grow negligent in their dress shew a slight to the husband that they shewed not to the lover and as good as declare that they are indifferent about preserving the heart which perhaps they took no small pains to engage ii  See  Dress High  Life  Husband  and Wife  Marriage Wife  Advice  to Young Women  A YOUNG Woman of whatever degree who keeps men at a modest distance will be sure to be the more valued for it even by those who had formed designs upon her honour i  A truly worthy and modest Young Woman will value herself more on being descended from honest parents though poor than if she were highborn and her parents unworthy i  The Young Woman who at the request of her pretended lover keeps secret the indecencies offered to her by him encourages him to repeat them i  The anger of a superior to a Young Woman who has had the virtue to repulse him is to be considered by her as her glory i  She that is more ashamed of dishonesty than of poverty will not be easily overcome i  A Young Woman whose virtue has been once attempted yet throws herself into the same person's company or continues where he is when she can avoid it ought to charge herself with the consequences if she receives new indignities i iii  Those things disgrace not men in the eye of the world which ruin Women i  The man who is capable of rudeness to a Woman to whom he professes honourable love ought to be rejected as an husband by a Woman of virtue and spirit for his sake as well as for the sake of her own honour i  How much better is it by good fame and integrity to get every one's good word but one than by pleasing that one to incur the censure of everybody else i  A man professing honour to a Woman has it generally in his power to convince her of his sincerity by more than words i  Wicked men will stoop to the most degrading meanness to obtain a favourite end i  If a Woman knows a man to be a libertine yet will without scruple give him her company he will think half the ceremony between them is over and will probably only want an opportunity to make her repent of her confidence in him iii  When a man wishes a Young Woman of inferior circumstances to confide in his  Honour  he ought to be explicite and not leave it to her to explain in her own perhaps  too  hopeful way what he means by the word In short the word  Marriage  is as soon spoken as the word  Honour  iii  Men frequently take little liberties with Women and as those are received are encouraged or discouraged from greater so that it is in a Woman's power effectually to overawe an audacious presumer and obtain even such a one's good opinion and esteem iii to to  A Young Woman will be in less danger when she  rather fears an enemy in the acquaintance she favours of the other sex than hopes a friend especially as so much depends upon the issue either of her doubt or of her confidence iv  A prudent Woman will not want to be reminded with regard to her conduct to fops coxcombs and pretty fellows that she is not always secure in their company by her superior good sense since good Generals trusting to their strength and skill have been often defeated by a weak enemy iv  The wife of a selfadmirer must expect a very cold and negligent husband iv  The Young Woman who will admit into her company any man who shall be of opinion and know it to be  hers  that it is his province to ask hers to deny will expose her reputation if not her virtue to great risques iv  Presuming men are always ready to construe every little civility in their own favour  ibid  Men have generally more hardness of heart than Women whence the latter when they meet not with men of honour engage upon very unequal terms iv  It is so customary with Men to make promises and vows and to set light by them when made that a Woman ought not to regard any thing they either say or vow that carries not demonstration with it  ibid  The difference in the education of men and Women must give the former great advantages over the latter even where genius's are equal  ibid  A man who is worthy of the Woman he pretends to love needs not generally speaking take indirect means to obtain her in marriage iv  Hope in material cases should never be unaccompanied by fear iv  When a Young Woman begins to find in her own heart an inclination to a man pretending love to her then if he be not a man of undoubted honour is her danger doubled as ought to be her vigilance since she has  herself  to guard against as well as him iv  A prudent Woman will not trust to her lover's mercy  or honour but to her own discretion and the rather as if he mean well he himself will value her the more for it if not well she will detect him the sooner  ibid  The doubt which a Woman has of her lover's honour is needful not only to preserve her own but his If she wrongs him she can make him amends by instances of greater confidence when she pleases But if yesterday she granted him little favours he will not allow her this day to recede till at last perhaps she puts herself out of her own power into his in order to manifest the insistedon generosity of her affection for him iv  There have been cases where a man himself pursuing the dictates of his encroaching passion and finding a Woman conceding has taken advantages which probably at first he did not presume to think of  ibid  See  Advantages  of Men over Women  ▪ Cautions  to young female Servants  Credulity Female  Dignity  Flattery Heroic  Poverty  Histories  and Characters  Libertines Love Low  Life  ▪ Masters  Behaviour to female Servants  Parents  and Children  Promises Romances Temptations Virtue  Anger  IT is giving a base man too much consequence in the common concerns of life to be violently angry with him iii  See  Passion  B  Bashfulness Sheepishness  BASHFUL people frequently confound themselves by endeavouring to avoid confusion i  Bashfulness even to a fault is always to be preferred to an undistinguishing and hardy confidence iv  Sheepishness is a damp upon merit iv Yet it may be looked upon as an outward fence or inclosure to virtue which may keep off the lighter attacks of immorality iv  It may be expected that a sheepish youth is docile humane goodhumoured diffident while a mind that never doubts itself is likely to be conceited impetuous overbearing incorrigible iv  See  Merit Modesty  Beauty  VIRTUE only is the true Beauty i  Beauty without goodness is but a skindeep perfection iv  Beneficence  THE power of doing good to worthy objects is the only enviable circumstance in the lives of people of fortune i ii  The beneficent heart gives benignity to the countenance i  Where the power of doing a beneficent action is wanting there is nearly as much merit in the will to do it as in the fact ii  The fortune of a person who has the blessing of a beneficent heart is the more valuable to him as it enables him to reward merit whereever he finds it ii  The pleasure of doing good to our not unworthy fellowcreatures who stand in need of our relief is of itself a sufficient reward for our Beneficence were there to be no afterremuneration ii iv  What joy is it in the power of the wealthy to give themselves whenever they please by comforting those who struggle with undeserved distress iii  A beneficent heart may be called the gift of God iii  Nothing in human nature is so Godlike as the disposition to do good to our fellowcreatures iii  A generous mind when it grants a favour will do it with a grace ii  See  Address  to the Rich  Charity  The  Rich  C  Calumny Censure Censoriousness  A GOOD person will rather choose to be censured for doing his duty than for a defect in it iii  Were evil actions to pass uncensured good ones would lose their reward and vice by being put on a foot with virtue in this life would meet with general countenance iii  No one is exempt from Calumny Words said the occasion of saying them not known however justly reported may bear a very different construction from what they would have done had the occasion been told iv  Cautions  to young Female Servants  THE least freedoms of a master to his handsome Female Servant and even his smiles when he is alone with her are to be apprehended by her as meaning too much for her honesty i  She is then to be most apprehensive for her virtue when she finds her heart elated with joy and gratitude for the distinction he pays her i  No riches no favour of the great can compensate for the loss of virtue i  The young woman who sacrifices her virtue to the distinction paid her by her master may well be said to be too grateful i  A handsome Female Servant should not wish to live in the house of a single man since she will be likely by it to suffer in her reputation in the world's eye may be more subject to temptation and if he marry will not most probably be continued in her place by his wife i  Distance regulated by civility and a freedom from pride will make a young woman in service respected by her equals and valued by her superiors i  Great favour shewn to a handsome young woman of low fortune by a man of high is to be suspected i  Happy ought to be the Servant in her own reflexion  who is dismissed for refusing compliance with the wicked will of her master i  Innocence is the sweetest companion a young creature can have  ibid  See  Advice  to young Women  Credulity Heroic  Poverty  Love Low  Life  Masters  Behaviour to Female Servants  Promises Temptations Virtue  Charity Almsgiving  WHEN we reflect that we serve a MASTER who exacts from us no hard terms but only requires of us to do justice and shew mercy to one another it must be a great inducement to acts of Charity and Benevolence iii  But were there  not  that inducement the pleasure that attends such acts is of itself a high reward to a beneficent and generous mind    See Pamela's methods of Charity to the Poor and Sick around her in the  COUNTRY iii  seq    seq    There are hardly any cases which require more judgment in distinguishing between objects worthy and unworthy and what is and is not Charity than those we call charitable cases iii  Such as make a trade of begging and are as tenacious of their stand as others of their freehold are not those who deserve relief  As do the industrious poor who are reduced by sickness casualty or misfortune or even by mistake not wilful or persisted in who sigh in secret and cannot make known what they suffer iii  The tender treatment of a sick servant is a great encouragement to all the rest as they will see by it how  they  will be taken care of should they happen to be ill iv  For a particular account of Pamela's Charities in  TOWN see iv  seq    seq    The worthy indigent become so by unavoidable accidents and casualties are to be distinguished in our acts of Charity from those who have brought upon themselves  want and distress by their extravagance or wilful folly iv  See Pamela's method in her acts of Charity and in her religious duties at home in order to avoid giving offence to her husband's gay spirit  iv seq seq  See  Address  to the Rich  Adversity Beneficence Consolation  to the Poor The  Poor  not to be despised by the Rich The  Rich Sickness  CHASTITY  See  Virtue  Chearfulness  THAT seriousness in giving advice will be most likely to be efficacious on a gay mind that is mingled with Chearfulness and throws not a cloud over innocent enjoyments ii  See  Parents  and Children  Children  in their early Infancy  SLEEP is an admirable nourisher both to the once young and the twice young iv  It is a most inconsiderate foolish and pernicious custom in nurses to awaken the Child from its nourishing sleep for fear it should suffer from hunger  ibid  Nurses by cramming and stuffing the little bowels of Infants till they are ready to burst occasion indigestions which turn to bad humours  ibid  Infants can have no corrupt taste to gratify All in them is pure as out of the hand of nature the food therefore that is given them should be plain all that is not so must vitiate and offend  How bad then is the custom which nurses have to mix wine or spirituous liquors however small in quantity in their liquid food on pretence of breaking the wind generated in their bowels iv  Children should not be used to physic That given them by way of precaution as it is called introduces the necessity of physic Would a parent beget a disorder where there is none or by frequent use render the salutary force of medicine ineffectual when it was wanted  ibid  See Pamela's description of an Infant pinned down  and swathed round with a roller ten or a dozen times blanket upon blanket wrapt round it Its head oppressed with covering upon covering its arms pinioned close to its body its legs hundled up as if to prevent those kindly stretchings which ought to be promoted as so many efforts for growth and enlargement lying a miserable little captive on the nurse's lap its head pinned by stays to the shoulders goggling and staring with its eyes the only organs it has at liberty as if supplicating for freedom to its fettered limbs  iv  Children in arms will by their fondness or dislike of their attendants let a parent know the treatment they meet with behind their backs iv  Children  how to be treated in their Infantile State with a View to the Cultivation of their Minds  CHILDREN'S minds are sooner capable of cultivation than is generally imagined iv  May not the Child which can tell its wants and make known its inclinations be easily made sensible of what is expected from it if proper methods be taken with it iv  For sometimes signs and tokens and even looks uniformly practised will do as well as words as we see in such of the young of the Brute Creation as we are disposed to domesticate and to teach to practise those little tricks of which the docility of their nature makes them capable  ibid  There is such a natural connexion and progression between the infantile and more adult state of Childrens minds that those who would know how to account for their inclinations should not be wholly inattentive to them in the former state  ibid  Every creature has its natural or instinctive pointings as they may be called teaching it to choose its good and to avoid what is hartful to it In Infants the desire they have to be carried abroad into the free air is one of those iv  The wisest ought not to be above attending to the first rules for the management of Infants If the Child has not good health and are not early rules the foundation of that blessing its animal functions will play but poorly thro' weak and crazy organs iv  At two or three years old or before the Buds of Childrens minds will begin to open a watchful Parent will then be employed like a skilful gardener in defending the flower from blights and assisting it thro' its several stages to perfection  ibid  An unreasonable appetite is to be checked at its first appearance iv  But if small and innocent indulgences will lead the Child to an observance of its duty it may be complied with in such  ibid  Great vigilance should be exercised over the tempers of Children when their notices of things and persons grow strong and significant iv  Childrens future tempers as to benevolence may be guessed at by their willingness to part with any thing they are fond of iv  Children should not be allowed to enter too early into discourse with grown people nor to give their opinions on subjects unless called upon to do so  Since knowledge is obtained rather by hearing than speaking iv  Yet they ought to be encouraged to ask questions for their information  ibid  Pamela observes to her Billy  that nature has given two ears to one tongue as if it meant that we should hear twice as much as we speak  ibid  See  Education Maternal  Duties  Parents  and Children  Children  and Servants  Too great a distance kept up between Children and Servants may fill the former with an arrogance that is not warranted by any condition or rank to their fellowcreatures and if care be taken by good examples of superiors to make good Servants such will not deserve to be treated contemptuously iv  The principles of universal benevolence and kindness especially to inferiors should be early inculcated in the minds of Children of birth and condition iv  No part of their superiority will be hereby lost says Mr  Locke  but the distinction increased and their authority strengthened when love in inferiors is joined with outward respect and an esteem of the person has a share in their submission iv  Domestics adds Mr  Locke  will pay a more ready and chearful service when they find themselves not spurned because fortune has laid them below the level of others at their master's feet  ibid  There is a pride a selflove in human minds that will seldom be kept so low as to make men and women humbler than they ought to be iv  That superiority will be best maintained which is accompanied by humanity and kindness and is grounded on the perfections of the mind rather than on the accidental advantages of birth and fortune iv  See  Education Parents  and Children  Servants  Clergy  To be a Clergyman and all that is compassionate and virtuous ought to be the same thing iii  The failings of some of the Clergy ought not to make impressions upon any one to the disadvantage of the function in general iii  This indiscriminate censoriousness  says Pamela  is a very common fault and frequently indicates an uncharitable and perhaps profligate heart seeking to level characters in order to cover enormities they will not be instructed to amend iii  The presence of a Clergyman known to be good will be always an awe upon free and forward spirits iii  A truly good Clergyman will be cautious of doing any thing that will require a dispensation and which would be unlawful without it iii  The treatment which the Clergy give to one another makes it the less to be wondered it that the laity use them with disrespect iii  Where a small stipend out of a good benefice is paid to the man who does all the duty it may be said that the principals help the invidious to a method of estimating the value of performing the sacred Service iii  He who takes two livings when one of them would afford him a handsome maintenance as good as declares that he is resolved to make the most of their profits iii  One of the causes of the contempt of the Clergy is the insufficient provision made for those of the inferior order iii  See the Conversation between Mr B Pamela and their Friends on Impropriations Pluralities  c iii  seq    seq    Bad as the world is a  prudent  Clergyman will always meet with respect iii  A good Clergyman will be unwilling to leave his flock tho' for a richer benefice if he find his ministry among them attended with good effects  ibid  Many people can receive benefit from one man's preaching who cannot by that of another tho' the abilities of both may be equal iii  There is a great deal in a delivery as it is called in a way a manner a deportment to engage people's attention and liking  ibid  Where the flock loves the shepherd his work is easy and more than half done where it does not let him have the tongue of an angel and live the life of a saint he will be heard with indifference and oftentimes as his subject may be with disgust iii  A  prudent  regard to worldly interest misbecomes not the character of a good Clergyman iii  Pity that all worthy Clergymen were not set above want and that not only for their own sakes but for that of their hearers since independency gives a man respect besides the power of doing good which will  inhance that respect and of consequence give greater efficacy to his doctrines  ibid  Temptations should not be laid in the way even of good men lest they should be overcome by them and thereby weaken influences which from such are of high consequence to the public weal iii  It is of public concern that we reverence the function in general notwithstanding the failure of individuals in it iii  God's providence is a better reliance than the richest benefice iii  The manifestation and reward of merit do not always go together iii  See the Hardships which the inferior Clergy lie under more than any other body of men as set forth by Mr B  iii  seq    seq    Worthy young men who have but just quitted college and have made the improvement of their minds their chief study in it know little of the world and depending on the goodness of their own hearts are more liable to be imposed upon than men of half their understanding iv  See  Patrons Religion Tythes  Clergyman  's Wife  IT is necessary in order to preserve the respect due to a good Clergyman that his Wife should be nearly if not quite as unexceptionable in her manners as himself iv  How shall a good Clergyman be able to pursue his studies with comfort to himself or with edification to his flock if he be made uneasy at home  ibid  And how can it be expected that his female parishioners will regard his public preaching if he has no influence over the private conduct of his Wife iv  The Wife of a country Clergyman ought to know something of oeconomy and houshold management iv  She should not delight in dress so as to be thought to  vie with the wives and daughters of the principal families in her neighbourhood  ibid  Whoever thinks of being a Clergyman's Wife  says Pamela to her Polly Barlowe confirming the above rules  should resolve to be as good as himself  Should determine to set an example to her female neighbours and shew how much weight her husband's doctrines have with her  Should be humble circumspect gentle in her temper and manners frugal  Should resolve to sweeten his labours and to be obliging to the poor as well as rich  Should be careful that her husband get no discredit by her means which would weaken his influence upon his auditors iv to to  COMEDY  See  Public  Entertainments  Competency  THE man who being not born to an estate is not satisfied with a Competency will hardly know any limit to his desires iii  See  Heroic  Poverty The  Rich  Conscience Consciousness  ALL outward finery is nothing weighed against a good Conscience i  The great man who will permit his Conscience to be his preacher will stand in less need of a chaplain i  There are cases in which the Consciousness of secret guilt will restrain a pleasure that in a happier situation it would have been equally delightful and laudable to manifest iii  What a poor figure does the proudest man make under the sense of a concealed guilt in company of the innocent who happens to know it iii  How would the innocent person who fears an unjust judge tremble were she  not  innocent and to appear before a just one i  See  Consolation  to the Poor  Heroic  Poverty  Resignation Shame  Conjugal  Piety  A GOOD wife who is intent upon doing her duty to God and her husband cannot but hope for a more elevated companionship than this transitory state can yield to her and the man of choice iii  What a dreadful case is hers who being as exemplary in the performance of her general duties as human frailty will allow looks upon the sole object of her earthly love the father of her children as an unhappy soul destined without a miracle to a seperate and miserable existence for ever iii  But what transports at times must she know who shall be blessed with the hope of being an humble instrument to reclaim a partner so dear to her  And that heart in heart hand in hand they shall one day issue forth from this incumbered state into a blessed eternity benefited in life by each other's example iii  What exalted happiness must that man and wife know who one spirit as well as one flesh join in the same prayers and thanksgivings both in their public and private duties iv  See  Husband  and Wife  Libertines Love  Consolation  IN all the inevitable changes and chances of this mortal life the worthy mind will comfort itself that Providence best knows what is good for it ii  The very evils most dreaded by a worthy mind are often turned by an allwise Providence to its honour and happiness ii  See  Adversity Resignation  Consolation  to the Poor  IN the midst of poverty and misfortune God's goodness is the honest man's surest reliance i  The next world not this is the rewarding place for the virtue and honesty of the suffering Poor i  Let none even think children a burden where it may happen that the merits of some one of them may be the  means of raising all the rest and a benefit and credit to honest parents i  While the virtuous Poor can be blessed with contented minds all day and sound sleep at night and the hours of night bear so near a proportion in number to those of the day may not such even at the worst be said to pass at least half their lives with more comfort than the voluptuous and distemper'd great iii  Honest Poverty is not such a deplorable thing as some imagine iii  Poor people who live low very seldom when taken ill want any thing but reviving cordials and afterwards wholsome kitchen physic and then the wheels of nature being unclogged newoiled as it were will go round again with ease and pleasantness by aid of that exercise which their labour gives them iii  While the rich and voluptuous are obliged to undergo great fatigues to keep theirs in order iii  Great inconveniencies attend people in  genteel  life which those in  lower  know nothing of Were the conveniencies and inconveniencies of the one and the other to be weighed perhaps the difference as to true happiness would not be so great as the latter imagine if it did not turn in their favour iii  See  Adversity Charity Heroic  Poverty  Low  Life  Prosperity Resignation  CONTENT  See  Consolation  to the Poor  Heroic

benefit to a young woman of no fortune i  People in a high condition generally so educate their children as not to suffer them to bear the least contradiction to their violent wills which indulgence as they grow up multiplies not only their own disquiets but those of every one else who have concerns with them i ii  Tutors should treat their pupils with regard to such of their faulty habits as cannot easily be eradicated as prudent physicians do their patients in chronical cases rather with gentle palliatives than harsh extirpatives which by means of the resistance given to them by the habit may create such ferments as may utterly defeat their intention iv  A generous mind will choose to win youth to do its  duty by mildness and good usage rather than by severity iv  It must be painful to such a one to be always inculcating on his children or pupils the doctrine of selfdenial in cases of an indifferent nature by methods quite grievous to his own  ibid  Encouragements given to children should however be innocent ones and not such as should lead to luxury either of food or apparel  ibid  The Almighty by rewards and punishments makes it our interest as well as our duty to obey him and can we propose to ourselves for the government of our children a better example  ibid  We must not expect from children at an early age that they should distinguish beyond facts iv  Grown  people have an eye to the reward for service performed nor will deserve to be thought less good or virtuous that they do a painful duty and even that they submit to be servants for the reward's sake  ibid  Selfdenial is indeed an excellent doctrine to be inculcated into children's minds and it must be done early too but we must not be too severe in enforcing it for a duty too rigidly insisted on will make it odious iv  A child should not be either compelled or induced by rewards to endeavour to master a study or byass that is not an indispensable requisite to his future life or morals to which it shews a natural or riveted aversion iv  If the Education and Studies of children were suited to their inclinations and capacities many would be made useful members of society that otherwise would make no figure in it iv  If as the child grows up its mind can be raised from the love of the reward to the love of its duty for the duty's sake it should by all means be done iv  The child which can be brought to prefer its duty to its appetites  as Mr Locke proposes it should  wants but little of the selfdenial of the wisest philosopher  ibid  If the child refuses obedience the parent must insist  upon it The necessity of using severity may be the issue A wise parent will therefore make as few things as possible necessary parts of its duty except they are likely to affect its future morals iv  Children from their beginning to talk  Mr Locke says  should have about them some sober discreet person whose care it should be to keep them from the infection of bad company iv  An acquaintance with the muses in the Education of youth contributes not a little to soften the manners It gives a delicate turn to the imagination and a kind of polish to the mind in severer studies iv  However it is not to wished that a youth should have such strong inclinations that way as to make that delightful amusement his predominant passion since we see very few poets whose warm imaginations do not run away with their judgments iv  And yet in order to learn the dead languages in their purity it will be necessary to study the antient poets which cannot fail of giving youth a relish for poetry in general  ibid  Latin and Language  in Mr Locke's judgment  is the least part of Education iv  See his method by which a mother may teach her son Latin without her understanding it herself and Pamela's reasonings upon it  iv  seq    seq  See also his method of instructing a child at once in Latin and French Arithmetic Geography Chronology History and Geometry with an instance in point as quoted by Pamela  iv  Languages and Sciences and all other accomplishments of Education will be to no purpose Mr Locke observes but to make the worse and more dangerous man if the tutor makes it not his chief care to form the mind of his scholar so as to keep out evil and vicious habits iv  On a  Home  and  School  EDUCATION  MR Locke for several weighty reasons prefers a  Home  to a  School  Education but makes it next to impossible  to procure such a tutor as he thinks necessary to direct it iv  See  TUTOR  It is impossible he says that in a  School  Education a master can have a great number of boys under his eye  any longer than they are in School together iv  Hence Pamela takes occasion humbly to propose it as a matter for her Mr B's consideration and determination Whether there cannot be found out  A middle way of  EDUCATION  between both  CANNOT  asks she  some master be engaged who shall be so well rewarded for his care of a few as shall make it worth his while to be contented with those few Suppose five six seven or eight at most whose morals and good breeding he may attend to as well as to their learning iv  seq    seq    The further this master lives from the friends of the young gentleman perhaps the better it will be  ibid  He should be a man of mild temper but strict in his discipline  One who makes it a rule not to give correction for small faults or till every other method has been tried  Who carries such a just dignity in his manner without the appearance of tyranny that his looks may be of greater force than the chidings of some and his chidings than the stripes of others  And who will rather endeavour to shame than terrify a youth out of his faults  She supposes that this gentleman should allot a particular portion of time for the prosecuting of the more  learned  studies  And before the youth was tired with them she supposes another portion should be allotted for writing and arithmetic  And then for a relief to his mind that the dancingmaster should take his part  Innocent recreations to fill up the rest at his own choice in which diverted by such a rotation of employments all rendered delightful by their successive variety he would hardly wish to pass much time  Since the dancing itself will answer both parts that of good breeding and that of exercise  And thus different Studies may at once be mastered  Moreover the emulation which will be raised where there are several young gentlemen will greatly lessen the trouble of the tutor and advance the learning of the pupils  An emulation which cannot be obtained in a home education where there is but a single youth to be taken care of  Such a master not having a great number of servants will be better able to answer for their conduct and behaviour  The young gentlemen will have young gentlemen for their companions all under the influence of the same precepts and example  And as little honours and distinctions must needs be very attractive to the minds of youth suppose as a reward for some excellence the excelling youth should be set to read at a little desk raised a step or two to his master and schoolfellows sometimes a little portion from the best translations of the Greek or Roman histories at other times from the English histories  The master explaining difficult passages and customs as the youth proceeded  Might not this in a very engaging manner initiate them into the knowlege of the history of past times and of their own country and lead them in the master's absence to pass some of their vacant hours in the like laudable manner  Why may not like triumphs on excelling be as incentive to engage children to conquer difficult tasks as the Roman triumphs their civic and mural crowns were to the heroes of old since men as the poet observes are but children of a larger growth iv  But if a  Home Education  is chosen to which Pamela as well as Mr Locke inclines she thus expatiates upon the qualities of a tutor  iv  He ought to be a man of free and generous principles yet not tainted with sceptical or heterodox notions  Who has travelled and preserved his moral character unimpeached  Whose behaviour and carriage is easy unaffected genteel  Who is not on one hand dogmatical positive or overbearing on the other yielding suppliant fawning  Who will study the child's natural bent in order to direct his genius to the attainment which he is most likely to master  In order to preserve the respect due to his own character with every one he must not be a talebearer a whisperer a busybody in the family  Must on the contrary have a benevolent turn of mind Be ready without officiousness to compose differences  Who will avoid the foppishness in dress by which the petitmaitres and French ushers at boardingschools often distinguish themselves since peculiarities of habit and uncharacteristic appearance generally denote a wrong head iv seq  As in a  home education  it will be very difficult to keep children as Mr Locke requires from the conversation of servants  It will be a securer as well as more laudable method for parents to insist upon the regular behaviour of the whole family than to expect that the child and its tutor shall be the only good ones in it iv  Nor is this so difficult to be effected as some may imagine If on the hiring of a new servant sobriety of manners and a virtuous conversation be insisted upon as indispensible conditions of their continuing in their service and if the principals take care to support their injunctions by their own example it would be seen that if their service did not find them good it would make them so iv  And why should not this be thought a practicable scheme when it is considered that servants when taken are generally at years of discretion and have the strong tie of interest superadded to the duty we require of them to influence them and which they must needs know let them have contracted habits ever so evil are as right for them to discharge as for us to exact from them iv  A bad person wholly convinced is half reformed iv  The Home Education is only to be preferred to that of the private school or university in cases where the parents set a good example in their families and take care of the morals of their servants iv  The emulation so useful in a School Education to lead children on in their studies and duties would be obtained in an home one if the child of some honest neighbour of middling or low circumstances of like years and of an ingenuous and modest disposition were taken into the family and put under the care of the same tutor and on a foot as to encouragement as each excelled iv  See the advantages of such an adoption as it may be called to the child of a man of affluence and the generosity and propriety of such an institution as set forth  iv  The noble doctrine of independence should be early instilled into the mind of a youth and how unworthy of a manly spirit a slavish dependence is iv  As a child is indulged or checked in its early follies a ground is generally laid for the happiness or misery of the future man iv  The restive tricks which horses dogs and other animals have learned when young are hardly ever to be mended when knit and yet says Mr Locke none of these creatures are half so wilful and proud and half so desirous to be masters of themselves as men  ibid  Shame is a

shame he is convinced of his error iv  The plays and sports of children are as salutary to  them as labour and work are to grown persons iv  See Pamela's opinion of the playthings and diversions of children  iv  seq    See  Children  in their Infantile State  Children  and Servants  Maternal  Duty  Parents  and Children  Travelling Tutor  Female EDUCATION  IN the Education of a young lady of strong passions it will be best to endeavour till she can be taught to love virtue for its own sake to conduct her spirit to proper ends rather than totally to subdue it iv  There may be a decent pride in humility iv  A young lady may behave with so much true dignity as shall command respect by the turn of her eye sooner than by assuming speech  ibid  A young lady should be told that it is no honour to be better born than servants if she be not better behaved too  ibid  And that humility is a grace that shines in a high condition but cannot equally in a low one because a person in the latter is already perhaps too much humbled  ibid  Women in their education  Pamela says  are generally forced to struggle for knowlege like the poor feeble infant who is pinioned legs arms and head on the nurse's lap iv  If its little arms happen by great chance to gain freedom and expand they are instantly seized and fastened down to passive behaviour by the tyrannic nurse  ibid  So when a poor girl in spite of her narrow education breaks into notice her genius is immediately tamed by trifling employments and she is kept back as if it were apprehended she would become the envy of her own sex

generally treat as freely the most sacred subjects iv  To what does the contemptuous treatment of the one half if not the better half of the human species tend to but to render the sex vile in the eyes of the most vile and to make women the subjects of the attempts of profligates iv  Since when a woman is no longer beheld with that dignity with which the innocence of her mind and perhaps the

learning generally succeeds with us accordingly and we reward our masters as we did our nurses with greater instances of our insolence than observance ii  After our wise parents have  bribed  our way

blameable sign of Love when we are ready to think well of a person against all appearances of demerit ii  Where we love we dwell on every little incident that can make for the advantage of the object ii  Love when permitted to reign in a tender bosom is an absolute tyrant requiring unconditional obedience  and deeming every instance of discretion and prudence and even too often of virtue an act of rebellion against its usurped authority iii  How often do the blemishes of those we love appear to us as graces Crimes themselves will be construed by inconsiderate minds into human failings and those are made a common cause of and excused or at least extenuated by each person for his or her own sake  ibid  People deeply in Love generally think too highly of the beloved object and too lowly of themselves iii  Love or the passion miscalled Love puts its votaries upon the meanst actions It levels with the dust the proudest spirit iii  True Love bears not the thought of any object but of that it sighs for iv  Wrong methods taken with a generous spirit in a supposed beginning Love are often the means of bringing about the event most dreaded and which perhaps but for those wrong methods would have come to nothing iv  Persons in a beginning liking who have not had an opportunity to declare themselves will nevertheless find out a silent language that shall be full as expressive as the plainest words iv  The passion which is generally dignified by the name of Love and which puts its votaries upon a thousand extravagancies usually owes its Being rather to ungoverned fancy than to solid judgment iv  Were we to judge of it by the consequences that usually attend it it ought rather to be called rashness inconsideration weakness any thing but Love  ibid  When once we dignify the wild misleader by that name all the absurdities which we read of in novels and romances take place and we are induced to follow examples that seldom any where end happily but in  story ibid  Love

request favours which a modest woman ought to refuse  If he treat either her person or dress with boistrous or rude freedoms  If he avoids urging marriage to her when he has a fair opportunity of doing it or  Leaves it once to her to wonder he does not so urge her  In any of these cases he is to be suspected and his visits ought not to be admitted  ibid  See  Advice  to Young Women  Libertines  Platonic  Love Promises  Love  at first sight  LOVE at first sight supposes such a susceptibility of passion as however it may pass in a man very little becomes the delicacy of the female character iv  There are many chances to one that a liking so precipitate ends unhappily  ibid  What room can there be in such a Love for caution for enquiry for the display of merit and sincerity and even for the assurance of a grateful return of Love iv  Love at first sight is a random shot It is a demon  tration of weakness In a woman it is a giving up  he negative voice that belongs to the sex even while she  oubts to meet with the affirmative one from him she wishes to be hers  ibid  Such a passion in a woman shews that her heart has been too much in the power of her eye and that she has permitted her fancy to be much more busy than her judgment iv  On the least favourable impressions of this kind to a man to whose character and merit she is a stranger a woman ought immediately to retire into herself she ought to reflect upon what she owes to her family to her character and to her sex in order to check such a random prepossession which as there are so many undeserving men to one who has real merit may more probably make her the prey of a base man than the wife of a worthy one  ibid  A Love of this sort may be stopt at a first liking if a young woman broods not over the

being lifted into a higher sphere iii  To make such a one easy and happy in his station is generally as much as ought to be done for him or as he ought to wish for  Native poverty is not a very grievous state where health is not denied and industry and diligence are not wanting  Labour is necessary to health Moderate labour which brings with it subsistence to a poor man is far from being an evil  Content alone is the blessing if that be wanting where there is a competence it will probably be so in affluence  He who has passed the meridian of life should be rather sollicitous to improve his circumstances in the way he has been used to than to aim at a higher and more dangerous situation  Has he talents for a higher sphere he will make that figure in his lower that will exalt him among his compeers and make him highly useful to them but which will give him little or no consequence among his superiors who by the advantages of education added to talents must be  always  his

engagement and as it is a change of life that can never be recalled will fill a thoughtful mind with anxiety on its approaches to it ii  If a modest young woman on the day of her nuptials cannot forbear thinking apprehensively on the great change of her condition though with the man of her choice how much to be pitied must she be who is compelled to marry the man she cannot love and perhaps to the losing of him she could ii  Such joys flow from virtuous and mutual love as the narrow mind of the libertine cannot comprehend ii  A man or woman may have as good a chance for happiness in marriage with a person of fortune as with one who has not any iii  With a man of sense a woman of tolerable prudence must be happy in Marriage iii  There cannot be any great happiness in the married life except each in turn give up their own humours and lesser inclinations iii  Most of the misunderstandings among married people are owing to trifles to petty distinctions to unguarded petulances Who would forego the solid satisfactions of life for the sake of triumphing in such poor contentions could they overcome in them iii  No man even by Marriage can do complete justice to the woman he has robbed of her honour iv  The wife  Pamela observes  is absolutely her husband's Every excellence by which she is adorned redounds to his honour even more than to her own in like manner as no

Pamela says  to think all the world her own upon it having to encounter with the illwill and contempts of her husband's relations with the envy of the rest of her sex her husband perhaps treated contemptuously on her account herself considered as the lowest of his family and a disgrace to it iv  Tho'  Pamela  made so great a figure in the station to which she was exalted it is much more likely that the generality of lowdescended women lifted up like her would have their heads made giddy by their exaltation than imitate her and shine as she did iv  The result is that those marriages

her distance to her master when he departs from his to her i  If  says Pamela to her master on a certain occasion  you could be so much afraid of your own servants knowing of your attempt upon a poor unworthy creature who is under your protection surely you ought to be more afraid of God Almighty in whose presence we all stand  in every action of our lives and to whom the greatest as well as the

puffedup by the compliments made either to her mind or to her person since did she on comparison with some others seem to merit the distinction paid her she will reflect that she owes not to herself the talents or form for which she is admired ii  A worthy person will be able to pray that God will frustrate her most desirable wishes if the possession of them would corrupt her heart and make her proud and vain ii  See  Humility Modesty Pride  Reformation  How greatly  says Mr B in his reformed state  do the innocent pleasures I now hourly enjoy exceed the guilty tumults that used formerly to agitate my unequal mind iii  One such hour  says he to his Pamela  as I now enjoy is an ample reward for all the benefits I can confer on you and yours in my whole life  ibid  How will it anticipate low reflection  says he  when it will be seen that I can bend my mind to partake with your parents on my retiring to visit them in their farm in a summer month or two the pleasures of their humble but decent life iii  And shall I not be rewarded for it too with better health better spirits and a better mind  ibid  Happy is the man who leaves his vices before the power of committing them leaves him iii  The man who reforms in the prime of life and before he is overtaken by some awakening misfortune may be called one of the happiest of those who have erred  ibid  A too great aiming at perfection will be apt rather to discourage others than allure them iii  Good people aiming to reform evil ones should proceed as able generals do in a difficult siege They should gain ground inch by inch and then intrench and fortify in order to maintain what they have gained and not by rushing at once upon an attack subject themselves to such a repulse as may oblige them to abandon an hopeful enterprize iii  In other words  Very great strictnesses all at once enjoined are not fit for a beginning Reformation but for stronger christians only and therefore possibly in the former case may do more harm than good iii  Thus Pamela encourages a desponding gentlewoman on a sick bed who had called herself miserable if all the good Pamela did and her exemplary behaviour were no more than necessary for salvation  Don't be cast down The Almighty gives us all a light to walk by in these our dark paths and it is my humble opinion he will judge us according to the  unforced  and  unbiassed  use we make of that light iii  I think it is  my  duty to do several things which perhaps the circumstances of others will not permit them to do In each case our judgments are as a law to each  ibid  Circumstances and situation may make that a duty in one person's case which may not be so in another's iii  See Pamela's method of devotion in her family    seq    seq    The sincerity of a man's Reformation is the less to be doubted when he can bear being gently told by a friend of his past errors iv  Reformation begun in the bloom of youth in full health and humanly speaking altogether spontaneously is indeed an hopeful one But as sacred tests must have been got over by a man who was at any time of life a libertine as the fences of virtue must have been broken down by such a one it is better that a woman of virtue  and honour prefers the man who always shewed a sacred regard to those tests who never broke down those fences iv  See  Religion  Relations  Pamela reasons as follows with her father who consulted her on the offer made him by several of their relations to serve him in cultivating the farm and estate committed to his care by Mr B  WE are apt to expect more regard from relations they more indulgence from us than strangers can have reason for iii  If you bear with their faults there will be no end of impositions if you dismiss them you will have their illwill they will impute to pride and unnaturalness your very justice Your prosperous lot will raise you enemies who will believe them rather than you  ibid  The world moreover will be apt to think you are crouding upon our benefactor a numerous family of low and indigent people tho' they should be ever so deserving  ibid  One would not therefore for  their  sakes accept of their services especially as they may serve others with equal benefit to themselves iii  For I would not that any of them should be lifted out of his station and made independent at Mr B's expence if their own industry would not make them so tho' I would never scruple reasonably to reward their industry in the way of their callings iii  If you receive some of them will not others expect to be equally favoured And may not this sow the seeds of envy among  them  and occasion ill will to  you ibid  Mr B himself will perhaps when he visits you for a month or two as he proposes be under some polite difficulty how to avoid taking notice of people who are your relations tho' were they not so their offices would not intitle them to it  ibid  And if they are modest and worthy would not his more than common notice of them lay  them  under equal difficulty  ibid  As for myself believe me I could sit down and rejoice with the meanest and remotest relation I have But to the world's eye I must if I have ever so much reluctance to appear superior in theirs endeavour to behave so properly as not to give additional discredit to his choice iii  And will you not have it in your power without injuring in the least our common benefactor and without incurring censure for your partiality to do kinder things by any of our relations when  not  with you than you can do were they to live with you  ibid  There are undoubtedly more happy persons in low than in high life one would not therefore encourage in any of our relations such a proud spirit as should make them want to raise themselves by favour rather than merit  ibid  I am sure tho' four or five years of different life had passsed with me in my old lady's days I had at a certain time a pleasure which I cannot express in the thought of working for my

indulged in too keen a taste for such kind of writings  iv  Romances in general are calculated rather to fire the imagination than to inform the judgment iv  The hero in them is usually distinguished by tilts tournaments marvellous and improbable adventures which he is continually hunting after in order to shew his prowess by engaging with monsters that never had being but in the writer's imagination  ibid  The heroine on the other hand is in them taught to consider her father's house as an enchanted castle herself as a prisoner in it and her lover is to break the charm and set her at liberty She is to be put upon climbing of walls to drop from windows to leap down precipices and all to shew the violence of a mad passion of which she ought to be ashamed she is to be  taught by them

meanness or debasement  That she will aim at an uniform and regular conduct  Willing however to conceal involuntary errors as she would be to have her own forgiven  And not to be too industrious to discover real ones that might be of no bad consequence and unlikely to be repeated  Yet not to conceal such as might encourage bad hearts or unclean hands in cases where damage might ensue to  their

case be guilty of a sin which as it admits not of repentance cannot of hope to be forgiven  And wilt thou to shorten thy  transitory  griefs heavy as they are plunge both soul and body into everlasting misery  Hitherto thou art an innocent sufferer wilt thou make thyself a guilty aggressor  How do I know but the Almighty may have permitted these sufferings as trials of my fortitude and to make me wholly rely on his grace and assistance  Wilt thou in one moment suffer all the good lessons of thy honest parents and the benefit of their examples to be thrown away upon thee and blemish in this last act a whole life which they have hitherto approved of  What presumptuous Pamela dost thou here Quit with speed these dangerous banks and fly from these dashing waves that seem by their murmurs this still night to reproach thy rashness  Whilst thou hast power left thee avoid the temptation lest thy grand enemy now by divine grace repulsed return to the assault with a force that thou

summer months between his other studies and as a diversion to him  ibid  She is of opinion that these excursions might be made to most advantage in company of his father as well as tutor and gives her reason for it  ibid  If his father cannot accompany the youth she proposes what may be of the next greatest advantage in this scheme of hometravelling to both son and tutor  ibid  That the young man visit the seacoasts as well as inland parts of Great Britain and Ireland and the other principal circumjacent islands iv  That he look into the art of navigation the curious structure of a ship as he is a native of the greatest maritime kingdom in the world From which knowlege tho' but in theory he will be taught to love and value the British sailors an useful and brave set of men who  are the

have studied my temper And if ever she had any points to carry any desire of overcoming it must have been by sweetness and complaisance  And yet  says he  not such a slavish one as should make her condescension seem to be rather the effect of her insensibility than of her judgment and affection  I should have thought I ought not to have desired any thing of her that was not reasonable to be complied with and that then she should have shewn no reluctance uneasiness or doubt to oblige me even at half a word  Yet if I were not always in the right I should expect that she should bear with me if she saw me determined and that she should expostulate with me on the right side of compliance  This would have shewn me that she differed from me not for contradiction sake but desired to convince me for my own and that I should another time take fitter resolutions  In all companies she must have shewn that she had an high opinion of and regard for me whether altogether deserved or not  And this the rather as such a regard would be not only a reputation but a security to herself since if libertines ever attempt a married woman their first incitement next to their own vanity arises from her known indifference to or contempt of her husband  I should have expected therefore that she would draw a kind veil over my faults That such as she could not hide she would endeavour to extenuate and shew to every one that I had  her  good opinion whatever liberties the world took with my character  She must have valued my friends for my sake been chearful and easy whomsoever I brought home with me and whatever faults she had observed in me have never blamed me before company much less with such an air as should have shewn that she had a better opinion of her own judgment than of mine  I know  proceeds he  my own imperfections They are many and great yet I will not allow that they should excuse those of my Wife or give her room to imagine I will bear faults in her which she  can  rectify because she sees greater in me  Upon the whole I expect  adds he to his Pamela  that you will bear with me till and only till you find me capable of returning insult for condescension and till you think I shall be so mean as to be the gentler for negligent or pertinacious treatment  And then your behaviour such I should scorn myself if there were one privilege of a Wife that a princess were

herself into the power of a man to say what she  will  or will  not  do iii  How can a woman who treating  herself  unpolitely gives a man an opportunity to run away with her expect him to treat her politely iii  See also  ii iii ii  See also  iii    The man who makes a flagrant tho' unsuccessful attempt and is forgiven or expostulated with meets with encouragement to renew it at an opportunity

a Lady to give him her hand at the altar ought not to press her to favour him with it at public entertainments iii iv  Libertines in order the better to carry on their designs upon the unwary of the Female Sex  particularly against those who are prudish  frequently make pretences to  Platonic Love  iii iv  If a woman suffers her Lover to see she is loth to disoblige  him let her beware of an encroacher iii iv  The Libertine who by his specious behaviour can lay asleep a woman's suspicion and caution is in the way to complete all his views iii iv  If a woman will keep company with a man who has reason to think himself suspected by her  I am sure says Lovelace  it is a very hopeful sign  ibid  Women are apt to allow too much to a kneeling Lover iv  Nine parts in ten of women who fall  says Lovelace  owe their disgrace to their own vanity or levity or to want of circumspection and proper reserve iv  Libertines  equally tyrannical and suspicious  expect that a wife should have no will no eyes no love no hate but at their direction iv  Travelling together gives opportunities of familiarity between the Sexes  says Lovelace  iv  Women therefore should be choice of the company they travel with  Women should be early taught to think highly of their sex for pride  as Lovelace says  is an excellent substitute to virtue iv  A woman of the brightest talents who throws herself into the power of a Libertine brings into question those talents as well as her discretion not only with himself but with his lewd companions to whom in secret triumph he will be proud to shew his prize iv vi iv vii  A modest woman fallen into gross company should avow her correctives by her eye and not affect ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed iv  A woman who has put herself into the power of a designing man must be satisfied with very poor excuses and pretences for delay of marriage iv  Want of power is the only bound that a Libertine puts to his views upon any of the Sex iv  A fallen woman is the more inexcusable as from the cradle the Sex is warned against the delusions of men iv  Men presume greatly on the liberties taken and  laughed off in Romping iv  See also

present  illtreatment from him intitles herself when his Wife to his future jealousy and censure v  She who puts herself out of a natural protection is not to expect miracles in her favour v vi  The woman who hopes to reclaim a Libertine  may  have reason to compare herself to one who attempting to save a drowning wretch is drawn in after him and perishes with him v vi vi  Men take great advantages even of women of character who can bear their free talk and boasts of Libertinism without resentment v vi  Chastity like piety is an uniform grace If in look if in speech a girl give way to undue levity depend upon it  says Lovelace  the devil has already got one of his cloven feet in her heart v vi  That woman must be indeed unhappy whose conduct has laid her under obligations to a man's silence vi  A bold man's effrontery in company of women must be owing to his low opinion of them and his high one of himself vi  A  good  woman who vows a duty to a wicked man knowing him to be such puts to hazard her eternal happiness vi  How dreadfully sunk is the woman who supplicates for marriage to a man who has robbed her of her honour and who can be thankful to him for doing her such poor justice vi  How must such a one appear before  his  friends and  her own  divested of that noble confidence which arises from a mind unconscious of deserving reproach vi  How does she subject herself to the Violator's upbraidings and to his insults of generosity and pity exerted in her favour  ibid  It must cut to the heart a thoughtful Mother whose Husband continues in his profligate courses to look round upon her Children with the reflection that she has given a Father destin'd without a miracle to perdition vi  It would be as unpardonable in a Lady  says Lovelace in the true Libertine spirit  to break her word with me as it would be strange if I kept mine to her In Love cases I mean for as to rest I am an honest moral man vi vii  If a woman is conscious of having shewn weakness to a man who has insulted her modesty she may then come to a composition with him and forgive him vi vii  I never knew a man  says Miss Howe  who deserved to be thought well of for his morals who had a slight opinion of our Sex in general vi vii  If a woman consents to go off with a man and he prove ever so great a villain to her she must take into her own bosom  the whole reproach and  a share of his guilty baseness vi vii  Offences against women and those of the most heinous nature constitute and denominate  the Man of Gallantry  vii  The pen next to the needle of all employments whether for improvement or amusement is the most proper and best adapted to the genius of women vii viii  The woman who neglects the  useful  and the  elegant  which distinguishes her own Sex for the sake of obtaining the learning which is supposed peculiar to men incurs more contempt by what she foregoes than she gains credit by what she acquires vii viii  The practical knowlege of the domestic duties is the principal glory of a woman vii viii  The woman who aims at more than a knowlege of the beauty and graces of her mother tongue too often endangers her family usefulness vii viii  Young

most apprehensive is sometimes that which we ought to wish for ii  Threateners when they have an opportunity to put in force their threats are seldom to be feared ii iii  It is better in a critical

greatest ravages in the finest faces is not always to be thought an evil v  Goodness and generosity give grace and lustre to beauty vi  Blushes Blushing  SILENCE and Blushes are now no graces  says Lovelrce  with our fine Ladies iii  A distinction is to be made between the confusion which guilt will be attended with and the noble consciousness that overspreads the face of a fine spirit on its being thought capable of an imputed evil iii  Harden'd by frequent public appearances our modern fine Ladies would be as much ashamed as men to be found guilty of blushing  Lovel  iii  The woman who at a gross hint puts her fan before her face seems to be conscious that her Blush is not quite ready  Lovel  iv  See  Modesty  C  Censure Character  THE world illnatur'd as it is said to be is generally more just in giving characters speaking by what it  feels  than is usually imagined i  Those who complain most of the Censoriousness of the world perhaps ought to look  inward  for the occasion oftener than they do i  A wrong step taken by a woman who aims to excel subjects her to more severe censures from the world whose envy she has excited than that world would cast on a less perfect character i  Characters very good or extremely bad are seldom justly given i  We should be particularly careful to keep clear of the faults we censure i ii  Hasty  Censurers subject themselves to the charge of variableness in judgment ii  We should always make allowances for the characters whether bad or good that are given us by interested persons ii  Many of those who have escaped censure have not merited applause ii  Good people  says Lovelace    or rather those who affect to be thought good  are generally so uncharitable that I should not chuse to be good were the consequence to be that I must think hardly of everybody else iii iv iv v  Where reputation is concerned we should not be in haste to censure iii  We should never judge peremptorily on first appearances  ibid  Every man and woman  says Lovelace  is apt to judge of others by what they know of themselves iii iv  A man who proves base to the confidence a woman places in him justifies the harshest censures of such of his enemies as would have persuaded her to reject him iv v  Character runs away with and byasses all mankind v  In the very Courts of Justice Character acquits and condemns as often as fact and sometimes

Human depravity it is feared will oftener justify those who judge harshly than those who judge favourably yet will not good people part with their charity vii viii  Nevertheless it is right to make that charity consist with caution and prudence  ibid  Charity Beneficence Benevolence  BENEVOLENT spirits are sufficiently happy in the noble consciousness that attends their Benevolence i  'Tis a generous pleasure in a Landlord to love to see all his tenants look fat sleek and contented i  That spirit ought not to have the credit of being called bountiful that reserves not to itself the power of being just iii iv  In cases where great good is wished to be done it is grievous to have the will without having the power iii iv  True Generosity is Greatness of soul it incites to do more by a

poor of such assistance as would set the wheels of their industry going  ibid  That Charity which provides for the  morals  as well as for the bodily wants of the poor gives a double benefit to the public as it adds to the number of the hopeful what it takes from that of the profligate vii viii  Can there be in the eyes of that God who requires nothing so much from us as acts of beneficence to one another a charity more worthy than that of providing for the souls as well as bodies of our fellowcreatures vii viii  See  Generosity  Church Clergy  THE Church is a good place to begin a reconciliation in if people mean any thing by their prayers  says Lovelace  i  Who that has views either worldly or cruel can go to Church and expect a blessing ii  It is a juster satire upon human nature than upon the Cloth if we suppose that those who have the  best  opportunities of being good are less perfect than others iv v  Professional  as well as  national  reflexions are to be avoided

says Lovelace  have been taken at advantage by wine and intoxicating viands v  Dancing is a diversion that women love but they ought to be wary of their company v  Women to women when warm'd by

to have for her ii  One of the greatest indignities that can be cast on a woman in Courtship is for a man to be so profligate as to engage himself in lewd pursuits at the time he pretends his whole heart to be hers ii  A woman accustomed to be treated with obsequiousness will expect obsequiousness to the end of the Courtship chapter  says Miss Howe  iii  The man who expresses high respect to a

has not generosity enough to use moderately the power which his great affection gives her vi vii  Such a woman gives reason to free livers to suppose and to presume upon it that the man to whom she intends to give her hand has no share in her heart vi vii  And if she shew that regard to him  after  marriage of which she shewed none  before  it will be construed as a compliment to the  Husband

to approve of and reward a wellmeant service  That she has a mind that lifts her above the little captious follies which some attribute to the sex  That she resents not if ever she has reason to be displeased with pride or thro' petulance  That by insisting on little points she aims not to come at or to secure great ones perhaps not proper to be carried  Nor leaves room to suppose that she thinks she has so much cause to doubt her own merit as to make it needful to put her Lover upon disagreeable or arrogant trials  But lets reason be the principal guide of her actions  And then she

Signs  of Love  Suspense  A STATE of Suspense to a lover is the most cruel of all states ii  It is ungenerous to keep an expecting mind in Suspense tho' with a view of obliging in the end ii  The surprize intended to be raised on such an occasion carries in its appearance an air of insult  ibid  Doubtful minds will increase their Suspense by fanciful circumstances ii iii  A woman of honour when she knows her own mind will not leave a worthy lover in Suspense iii  Certainty in what  must  be however afflicting is much better than Suspense iii  See  Artful  Men  Love Lover Signs  of Love  Sincerity  T  Taste  WE should conform whenever we innocently can to the Taste of the times in which we live ii iii  Expensiveness is not always the mark of a true Taste iii  A man of Taste in buildings and alterations studies situation and convenience  ibid  He pretends not to level hills or to force or distort nature but to help it as he finds it without permiting art if he can possibly avoid it to be seen in his works  ibid  He would rather let a stranger be pleased with what he sees as if it were  always  so than to seek to obtain  comparative  praise by informing him what it was in its former situation  ibid  And why Because there is as much praise due to a man who knows how to let a thing remain well that is well as to him who makes it so when otherwise  Those who have a Taste for trifles if innocent ones should not be diverted from pursuing it unless there were a likelihood that they would bestow their time better iv  The best  any  thing carries with it the

do a wrong thing has it  yet  in his or her power to reject the Temptation and to do a right one ii iii  In a Temptation yielded to with our eyes open it is mean to accuse the Tempter ii iii  Temptation strengthened by power is often the corrupter of a before unsuspected heart iv v  Travellers Travelling  HUMAN nature is pretty much the same in every country allowing for different customs i  ibid    Let men  says Miss Byron  make ever such strong pretensions to knowlege from farfetched and dearbought experience cannot a penetrating spirit learn as much of human nature from an Englishman at home as he could from an Italian a Frenchman or a Spaniard in their respective countries i  ibid    Men not bad may possibly in their Travels mistake and import some gay weeds for flowers i  ibid    A prudent and good man visiting foreign countries will not either prevaricate or deny his religious principles yet in good manners will shew respect to the religion of the country he passes thro' or resides in and venerate the good men of all communions iii  Honour and the laws of hospitality will be the guides of a young Traveller's conduct iii  What can Travellers see but the ruins of the gay once busy world of which they have read iii iv  At best but ruins of ruins since the imagination aided by reflexion must be left after all to make out the greater glories which the

their country and the religion they were educated in would suffer  less than they do from the scandals they give to both in the eyes of enemies iv v  A prudent young man on his Travels will endeavour

own particular gratifications ii  Habitual Wickedness debases as habitual goodness exalts the human mind and gives an actual superiority and inferiority respectively to persons naturally of equal parts and abilities ii iii  Wickedness may be always put out of countenance by a person who has an established character for goodness  and who is not ashamed of doing his duty in the public eye v vi  Vincibility  of Love  THE woman who would have conquered her passion had the object of it been married gives a proof that it may be overcome ii  Few women marry their first Loves iii iv  Like merits where  person  is not the principal motive of love may produce like attachments  ibid  To love with an ardor that would be dangerous to a person's peace of mind there must be more tenderness than reverence for the object iii iv  A woman of delicacy will deprecate being in such a situation as to warrant the compassion of the best man in the world iii iv  The passion that can admit of raving on a disappointment is temporary and seldom dangerous iv v  If the head be safe pride and supposed slight will in time harden the heart and resentment in a woman of spirit will take place of Love iv v  The unexperienced virgin is to mistrust her heart when she begins to meditate with pleasure the good qualities of an object with whom she has frequent opportunities of conversing iv v  To suppose that

such a one is likely to raise a fortune which if he be so kind as to die in good time may recommend her to the arms of a gayer second v vi  When such a worthy couple set out in taste business the good

man of Wit ii  Sprightly persons often make it necessary for them to ask two forgivenesses instead of one ii  That species of Wit which cannot shine without a foil is not a Wit to be proud of ii iii  A Witty Woman should not think of marrying a man of inferior understanding if she cannot resolve to shield him not only against her own but every other person's ridicule ii iii  Such a one should confine her vivacities to time and place ii iii  The lively woman who has not the offer of a man of understanding superior to her own should encourage the addresses of one who will be likely to allow the superiority of hers ii iii  A Witty Woman's vivacity may less become the wife than the single woman iii  Vivacity should never carry us beyond the bounds of prudence and discretion iii  Witty people seem to think they cannot shew their own consequence but by putting a fool's coat on the back of a friend iii  Sterling Wit requires not a foil to set it off  ibid  It is sometimes the misfortune of a Witty Woman herself sometimes that of her companions that she cannot  help  being Witty iii iv  Witlings study for their pleasantries and hunt for occasions to be smart iv  There can

Mar    MADAM  I Write to your commands sent me yesterday  I have no intention of pursuing further the History of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON And hope when you consider the circumstances of the Story you will be of opinion that it ends very properly where it does tho' at the first perusal it may seem to a Lady who honours the piece with her approbation to conclude a little abruptly and the rather as the necessary delay in publishing the last volume occasioned by the treatment I met with from Dublin made persons imagine that marvellous events and violent catastrophes were preparing and but for which treatment the three last volumes would have been published together  The Story of PAMELA was supposed to have taken place within thirty years that of CLARISSA within twenty of their respective publications In either of those spaces of time there was room to marry and bury half a generation of people  That of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON is supposed to be more recent In his recital of what passed between himself and Clementina long before the Story began and before he had hopes of being allowed by his Father then living to return to England he mentions the rebellion in and and that the exultations made over him in Italy on the reported success of the young Adventurer obliged him to go to Vienna  What passed between him and Clementina and her Family on his return from thence to Bologna till he quitted Italy and on his Father's death arrived in England may be supposed to take up a considerable space of time  He had been about fifteen months in England when the Story begins That takes up a year and half  All this may be supposed to bring it down pretty near to the present time  EMILY under the direction of so prudent a guardian was not for example sake to be married till she was near twenty  Lady GRANDISON'S circumstances and her lyingin would not  permit her to leave England for a voyage to Italy so soon as might be hoped for by Clementina and her friends Sir Charles had a view I fansy to those delicate circumstances when he offered to make them judges of the reasons should he and his Harriet be unable to attend them within the next year why they could not  Do you think Harriet would not be a Nurse as well as Lady G It would be a desirable thing we may suppose to all their Italian friends as well as suitable to the maternal fondness for her to take her child with her But would she do so till it was at least a year old There is no doubt but it would be a very fine and forward child But the heir of Sir Charles Grandison must not be needlesly or for a compliment exposed to dangers and difficulties Read again the passage by land over mount Cenis acquaint yourself with the Bay of Biscay were they to go by sea  As to the good JERONYMO he is happy where he is Lady G makes him alive and merry And have you not an intimation that he is to go to Bath And do you think that those salutary springs will not for the honour of our country quite establish him  CLEMENTINA at the year's end may either marry the Count of BELVEDERE her malady not returning or as Sir Charles has engaged all her friends to promise may at her own request be allowed more time You have seen that the COUNT acquiesces entirely with whatever shall be her will in this particular  Do you think Madam I have not been very complaisant to my Readers to leave to them the decision of this important article I am apt to think from what I have already heard from several of them of no small note and great good sense that a considerable time will pass before this point will be agreed upon among  them  And some of my correspondents rejoice that Clementina is not married in the book hoping that she will never marry while others express their satisfaction in the time given her and doubt not but she will Some are pleased with the Count others not Some are of opinion with Jeronymo that her compliance with the silent wishes of her friends when left entirely to her own will was the only duty wanting to complete her character she having voluntarily renounced so nobly as she did the only man whom she preferred to  him  who was the choice of her parents and given up her wishes to be allowed to take the veil  Let us take a survey of what is done for the other characters  No more need be said than is of EVERARD GRANDISON or of Aunt ELEANOR  Mr DEANE you see is provided for to his own and every one's content  So is good Dr BARTLETT  The skilful LOWTHER also  Sir EDW BEAUCHAMP and EMILY are in a way to be happy  Who can be more so than Mrs SHIRLEY Why Madam would you wish to have further time taken in to conclude a life so valuable so exemplary  Sir ROWLAND and Mr FOWLER are not unhappy They are going to Caermarthen and you remember Sir Rowland says there are fine girls in Caermarthenshire  Mr SELBY goes on at Selbyhouse crowing over his Wife and his Nieces and tho' always defeated by their goodhumoured arguments and superior sense crowing on and making all around him pleasant  Who can be happier than Mr and Mrs REEVES  LUCY has already her PEER  I could have given NANCY SELBY to Mr ORME but that it is not right to put together two persons who neither of them have entire health till they are quite recovered and that would take up time He accompanied by his Sister is a second time gone to Lisbon you know And she Emily hints is not without her Lover  Miss ORME is a good girl and must be happy  As for GREVILLE and FENWICK who cares for them  The fate of Sir HARGRAVE of MERCEDA of BAGENHALL is absolutely and exemplarily decided  JAMES SELBY is as good as provided for But if he had not it would not have been much matter  Lady BETTY WILLIAMS indeed and her forward Daughter and Miss CANTILLON are deservedly unhappy and there are too many of such characters in everybody's knowlege to require  theirs  to be further dwelt upon  Lady BEAUCHAMP Lady MANSFIELD and her family Lord and Lady W Lord and Lady L are all happy Lord G also And his CHARLOTTE is as good as  she  can be Her Lord wishes her not better than we leave her  Sir CHARLES is the happiest of men Plans of his beneficence oeconomy charity have been actually laid down  His LADY is as she deserves to be the happiest of women  By what we have seen of  both  we know how they will behave on every future call or occasion  CLEMENTINA let me add to the notice I have taken of her is mistress of her own will By the power Sir Charles in the articles he drew stipulated for her we know she will make herself happy in acts of beneficence and as he has foretold will see everything in a chearful light that before appeared to her in a cloudy one What will be the result  LAURANA has been punished in kind as we may say  Lady SFORZA also  The MARQUIS the MARCHIONESS the GENERAL the BISHOP in short the whole  Porretta family  are happy to the extent of their wishes  Mrs BEAUMONT is highly so in the general felicity  So is Father MARESCOTTI  Should the story which were it prolonged to do everything that seems to be expected would take up more time though not quantity of matter than it has already taken up be continued for the sake of OLIVIA Surely No  Can it then be more happily concluded than it is  As to what you are pleased to hint of the Hero's appearing to shine in the parental character have I not in PAMELA entered into that subject pretty largely And have I not in this history avoided touching upon the same topics that I have treated on in either of the two former  But you will be apt to say You expected more on these subjects from Sir Charles's character than from that of Mr B or even of his Pamela  But to say nothing of his care for the education of his Father's natural children by Mrs Oldham see we not from his tenderness to Mrs Reeves's little boy from his goodness to Lady L's son and to Lady G's little girl from the observation of his Lady that the Brave are always tender and humane from his general prudence as well as from his own duty to a blameable Father whose failings he occasionally deplored with a piety worthy of himself that he would have shone in every part of the parental character Who ever knew a dutiful Son that made not a good Father And where and at what age of his children had I entered into such particulars should I have been allowed to stop since as they grew in years they would have had larger demands on his cares  I might indeed in what  is done  have introduced a conversation in which the Education of Children might have been touched upon and his opinion given But the lovers of Story would have found fault with me for it as they have done with the few independent conversations that appear in the book however useful others have thought them And besides the occasion must have been forced in Nor would the subject have appeared with the requisite advantage handled by or before single men and women or even by young married people who had no opportunities to strengthen their opinions by experience  Permit me further to observe that the conclusion of a  single story  is indeed generally some great and decisive event as a  Death  or a  Marriage  But in scenes of life carried down nearly to the present time and in which a  variety of interesting characters  is introduced all events cannot be decided unless as in the History of  Tom Thumb the Great  all the actors are killed in the last scene since persons presumed to be still living must be supposed liable to the various turns of human affairs  All that can be expected therefore in such a work if its ending is proposed to afford the most complete scene of felicity of which human life is capable must be to leave the principal characters happy and the rest with fair prospects of being so  I am however greatly obliged to you Madam for having so  far interested yourself in the story as to write to me upon it and beg leave to subscribe myself  Your obliged and most obedient Servant  ANSWER to a LETTER from a FRIEND who had objected to Sir CHARLES GRANDISON's Offer to allow his Daughters by Lady CLEMENTINA had his Marriage with her taken Effect to be educated Roman Catholics  Mar  I HAVE received my dear friend several anonymous Letters written on the same subject with your favour before me of the th finding fault with Sir Charles Grandison for his offered compromise with the friends of Clementina in the article of Religion all of them expressing as yours does a laudable zeal for the interests of the Protestant cause  One of the gentlemen desired an answer to what he wrote directing whither it was to be sent I do not think myself at liberty to transcribe for you his Letter though an anonymous one and which would do credit to any writer But as your Letter and his are in substance pretty much the same you will allow me to hope for your attention to the extracts I shall make from my answer to his and if they are not of sufficient weight with you to excuse the Hero in this important article I shall be ready at your command to reconsider it  This gentleman wishes as you do that I had gone further into the subject That I had exposed the iniquity of such compromises and shewn that the souls of girls ought to be as much regarded as those of boys and the rather as such stipulations are now made a point in course in the marriagetreaties of persons of different religions He is so good as to call for my opinion on the subject Thus I answered  Give me leave Sir to say I have shewn in the work when the subject required it that I have the honour to be of your opinion as to this compromise I have in Vol iii  Octavo  p made the Bishop Clementina's Brother thus say to Mr Grandison after a debate between them on the two religions  "You will call to mind Chevalier that  your  church allows of a possibility of salvation out of its pale  Ours  does not"    "My Lord" answers the Chevalier "our church allows not of its members indulging themselves in capital errors against conviction"  Mr Grandison was a young man He pretended not to be divested of passion It was necessary to let the Porretta family and the Reader who it was supposed would not be unconcerned in the destiny of Clementina see that he was willing to make some sacrifices for those the family made in consideration of so excellent a creature who had suffered so much and was actually in a  state of suffering for her Love of him What could he do  more  he asks Dr Bartlett than to make such an offer He considers it as a very great concession though he must know that it was as you Sir observe a too usual one And he tells her warmest relations the General in particular  "that he would not have come into such a compromise no not in favour of a princess in a  beginning  address"  And this he says in answer to the General's question  "What Chevalier must the poor daughters have done that  they  should have been left to perdition"  And this put by that haughty man when he knew that Mr Grandison was of a religion which inspires its professors with more charity than does that which allows not salvation out of its own pale and the souls of whose daughters therefore in his opinion could not be endanger'd merely by such an education  Who that thinks the Porretta family bigotted must not have allowed  them  to think Mr Grandison so had he not made some such sort of concession as he expected them to make Nay the actually made a much greater than  be  offered The SONS of the family and besides were more apprehensive of their Daughter's change of religion were the marriage to take place than hopeful of his  Some concessions are expected to be made in all marriage treaties and contrary to what was proposed in  this  greater frequently on the man's than on the woman's part since it is understood that the wife is more the property of the husband than he is hers and he therefore in marriage makes an acquisition Pecuniary sacrifices could not have affected Mr Grandison Nothing but what touched his principles could This was a severe trial to him Clementina at the time was the only woman he could have loved He knew not then Miss Byron But we have reason to believe from different parts of the story that he thought himself not unhappy that a marriage to be entered into on such terms took not effect as well as that it was owing to Clementina herself and not to him that it did not frequent as such compromises are in marriagetreaties between people of different persuasions  That these observations lie scattered as I may say in different parts of the story is owing a good deal to the manner of writing to the moment as it may be called as occasions arose in the progress of the story A manner of writing that has its conveniencies and inconveniencies The  latter  in such cases as that before us the  former  in giving opportunities to describe the agitations that fill the heart in the progress of a material and interesting subject the event of which remains undecided  You will be pleased to observe that I had a very nice and difficult task to manage to convince nice and delicate Ladies who it might be imagined would sit in judgment upon the conduct of a man in a Lovecase who was presumed to be nearly perfect and proposed as a pattern that a Lady so excellent as Clementina of  so high a family and fortune all her relations adoring her so deeply in love with him yet so delicate in her whole behaviour to him was not slighted by  him  What would the Ladies and the men of gallantry have said had he not done all it was possible for him to do to obtain so rich a prize  Allow me to say that if his distress in different scenes of the story were duly attended to attacked as he was on the side of his Generosity his Compassion his Gratitude his Love together with his stedfastness in his own Religion I presume that in the whole affair between him and Clementina he would be rather thought a confessor for it than a lukewarm man in it Be pleased to reperuse what he says to Miss Byron on this subject in the library at Colnebrook  Vol  iii  Octavo p    Vol  iii  p    Duodecimo  'What must be my grief to be obliged to disappoint such expectations as were raised by persons who had so sincere a value for me You cannot madam imagine my distress So little as could be expected to be allowed by them to the principles of a man whom they supposed to be in an error that would inevitably cast him into perdition But when the friendly Brother implored my compliance when the excellent Mother in effect besought me to have pity on  her  heart and on her  child  's head and when the tender the amiable Clementina putting  herself  out of the question urged me for my soul's sake to embrace the doctrines of her holy mother the churchWhat madamBut how I grieve you'  'He stopt says Miss ByronHis handkerchief was of use to him as mine was to meWhat a distress was here'  'And what and what Sir sobbing was the result Could you  could  you resist'  'Satisfied in my own faith Entirely satisfied Having insuperable objections to that I was wished to embraceA Lover of my native country tooWere not my God and my Country to be the sacrifice if I complied But I  laboured  I  studied  for a compromise I must have been unjust to Clementina's merit and to my own character had she not been dear to me And indeed I beheld graces in her  then  that I had before resolved to shut my eyes against her Rank next to princely her Fortune high as her rank Religion Country all so many obstacles that had appeared to me insuperable removed by  themselves  and no apprehension left of a breach of the laws of hospitality which had till now made me struggle to behold one of the most amiable and nobleminded of women with indifference'  Then he relates his offer of compromise  And let me add here that noble apostrophe of his when he had been contemplating the perfections of Clementina the worthiness of her family and their great offers to him  "But O my Religion and my Country I cannot cannot renounce you  What can this world give what can it promise to warrant such a sacrifice"  Nor are these the strongest instances that he gives of his attachment to his Religion and Country in the course of the work to say nothing of what might be supposed to pass between him and the Bishop in their debate on the two Religions in which he convinced the Prelate who from that time forbore to attack him on that subject that he had a great deal to say in behalf of his own  In an omission in the Sixth Volume Octavo which is supplied p Lucy Selby is made thus to express herself with regard to this compromise in order to weaken the danger to Religion that might be apprehended from the example  "How could Sir Charles so thorough an Englishman have been happy with an Italian wife His heart indeed is generously open and benevolent to people of all countries He is in the noblest sense a Citizen of the World But see we not that his long residence abroad has only the  more  endeared to him the Religion the Government the Manners of England"  "How was this nobleminded man proceeds she entangled by delicacies of situation by friendship by compassion that he should ever have been likely to be engaged in a family of Roman Catholics and lived half of his days out of his beloved country and the other half to have set as to the world's eye such an example in it"  "I know adds Miss Selby he would have made it his study to prevent any mischief to his neighbours from the active zeal of his Lady's confessor had a certain compromise taken effect I remember the hint he gave to Father Marescotti  Vol iv p OctaveVol v p Duodecimo  But would even that good man have thought himself bound to observe faith with heretics in such a case"  And in the Concluding Note to the work I have further endeavoured to obviate the apprehended mischief by declining to  contend  with such of my Readers whose laudable zeal led them to consider this compromise as a fault  Thus my dear Friend you will see that however usual it may be for people of different Religions when they intermarry to enter into compromises of this kind they are not countenanced by the  judgment  of Sir Charles Grandison who considered as the greatest misfortune that could have befallen him the situation he was in which in a manner  compelled  him to make some concessions in compassion to an excellent woman who laboured under a disorder of mind on his account  After all if this concession of Sir Charles is to be deemed a blemish it is rather a blemish in his conduct than in his character Very few in  his  circumstances would have done better few so well And what he offered in so  peculiar  a situation is by no means a precedent to be pleaded in  common  cases  Believe me to be with equal truth and affection Sir  Your most obedient Servant
