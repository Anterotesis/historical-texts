years  Pick  Now wou'dn't any one think to hear you talk that my son had actually some vice in him for my part I own there is something so whimsical in all his tricks that I can't in my heart but forgive him aye and for aught I know love him the better into the bargain  Miss P  Yes trulybecause you have never been a sufferer by themhad you been rendered rediculous as I have been by his tricks

P  If you had the smallest spark of taste you wou'd admire the effusions of Mr Tagg's pen and be enchanted with his admirable acting as much as I ambut as to this story it may serve as another sample of my nephew's sweet disposition to coin base falsehoods against his aunt's character  Pick  Do you tell me I can't educate my own child and make a Lord Chancellor of him or an archbishop of Canterburywhich ever I like just as I please  During the last speech  Pickle  leans on the table which is drawn away by a string and he falls    Miss P  I'll lay my life that is another trick of that

wasn't so much to blame Sir not so  very  much  Miss P  Don't aggravate your faults by pretending to excuse them your father is too kind to you  Little P  Dear Sir I own I was unfortunate but I heard you often complain how wild and vicious Daisey was and so Sir sooner than you should suffer I was resolv'd to venture my own neck and try to tame her for you that's all Sirand so I was no sooner mounted but off she setI cou'dn't help that you know Sirand so this misfortune happen'dbut indeed Sir  Pick  Cou'd I be sure this was your motive that it was merely  love  and  regard  for your old father makes you thus teize and torment him perhaps I might be inclined  John  Yes Sir but 'twas no love and regard for I made him beat me so  Little P  John you know you were to blameindeed Sir the truth is John was scolding me for it and when I told him as I have told you why I did it and that it was to hinder your being hurt he said  that  was no  business of mine and if your neck  was  broke 'twas no such great matter  Pick  What no great matter to have my neck broke  Little P  No Sir so he said and I was vex'd to hear him speak so of youand I believe I might take up the whip and give him a cut or two on the legsit cou'd not hurt him much  Pick  Well child I believe I must forgive you and so shall John toobut I had forgot poor Poll what did you roast the parrot for you young dog you

Little P  Illnature ma'amI'm sure nobody can accuse me of that  Miss P  How will you justify the report you spread of my being lock'd up in my closet with Mr Tagg the authorcan you defend so vile an attempt to injure my dear reputation  Pick  What that too I suppose was from your care of her characterand so to hinder your aunt from being thought an old maid you lock'd her up in her closet with

long is this scheme of yours to last how long am I to be deprived of him  Miss P  How long why till he's brought duly to reflect on his bad behaviour which nothing will induce him to do sooner than thinking he is no longer your son but the child of poor parentsI yesterday spoke to Margaret our old nurse and she fully comprehends the whole affair  Pick  But why in addition to the quitting my own child am I to have the torment of receiving her'swont the sending him away be sufficient  Miss P  Unless the plot's manag'd my way I'll have nothing to say to it but begone can't you tell that his distress at losing his situation will be augmented by seeing it in possession of another come come Brother a week's purgatory will reform him depend on it  Pick  Why to be sure as you say it will
