 THE DEVIL UPON TWO STICKS A COMEDY WRITTEN by Mr FOOTE PUBLISHED by Mr COLMAN  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  THE DEVIL UPON TWO STICKS A COMEDY IN THREE ACTS AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL in the HAYMARKET WRITTEN BY THE LATE SAMUEL FOOTE  Esq  AND NOW PUBLISHED BY Mr COLMAN  LONDON Printed by T Sherlock For T CADELL in the Strand MDCCLXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  SOME copies of spurious impressions of the Cozeners and the Maid of Bath having been printed and circulated before the application to the Court of Chancery for an Injunction it has been thought advisable in vindication of the property of the Editor as well as in justice to the deceased Author immediately to commit to the press genuine editions of the two dramatick pieces abovementioned together with THIS COMEDY which had been also without authority advertised for publication  On inspection of the spurious impressions it appears that all the errors of careless and ignorant transcribers are there religiously preserved and all the additions and improvements made by the facetious Writer are omitted Many instances of this will occur on perusal of those Comedies and particularly the Cozeners in which besides the restoration of several passages always spoken on the stage the Reader will find a whole scene at the end of the First Act and  another still more entertaining and popular at the beginning of the Third both which were wholly wanting in the spurious Impressions  Unauthorized publications are not only always detrimental to private property but commonly prove injurious to the publick For the copies being obtained by clandestine and indirect means are for the most part as has happened in the present instance incorrect and imperfect  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  DEVIL  Mr Foote  Sir THOMAS MAXWELL

these curs'd newspaper patriots have shatter'd her brains nothing less than a senator of seven years standing can conceive what she means  Marg  Why Sir Thomas my conversation is neither deficient in order precision or dignity  Sir Tho  Dignity and what occasion for dignity in tne common concerns of my house why the deuce can't you converse like the rest of the world If you want money to pay off my bills you move me for further supplies if I turn away a  servant you condemn me for so often changing my ministry and because I lock up my daughter to prevent her eloping with the paltry clerk of a pitiful trader it is forsooth an invasion of the Bill of Rights and a mortal stab to the great Charter of Liberty  Marg  As Serjeant Second'em said in the debate on the cornbill  Then why don't you chuse better ground brother and learn to enlarge your bottom a little Consider you must draw the line of liberty somewhere for if these rights belong    Sir Tho  Mercy on us  Marg  But indeed my dear brother you are got quite out of your depth Woman I tell you is a microcosm and rightly to rule her requires as great talents as to govern a state And what says the Aphorism of Cardinal Polignac  If you would not have a person deceive you be careful not to let him know you mistrust him  and so of your daughter  Sir Tho  Mrs Margaret Maxwell bestow your advice where it is wanted Out of my depth a likely story indeed that I who am fix'd here in a national trust appointed guardian of the English interest at the court of Madrid should not know how to manage a girl  Marg  And pray Mr Consul what information  will your station afford you I don't deny your knowledge in export and import nor doubt your skill in the difference between wet and dry goods you may weigh with exactness the ballance of trade or explain the true spirit of a treaty of commerce the surface the mere skimmings of the political pot  Sir Tho  Mighty well  Marg  But had you with me traced things to their original source had you discover'd all social subordination to arise from original compact had you read Machiavel Montesquieu Locke Bacon Hobbes Harrington Hume had you studied the political testaments of Alberoni and Cardinal Richlieu  Sir Tho  Mercy on us  Marg  Had you analiz'd the Pragmatic Sanction and the familycompact had you toil'd thro' the laborious page of the Vinerian professor or estimated the prevailing manners with the Vicar of Newcastle in a word had you read Amicus upon Taxation and Inimicus upon Representation you would have known  Sir Tho  What  Marg  That in spite of the frippery French Salick laws woman is a free agent a noun substantive entity and when treated with confidence  Sir Tho  Why perhaps she may not abuse it But still my sage sister it is but a  perhaps  now my method is certain infallible by confining her I can't be deceiv'd  Marg  And pray Sir what right have you to confine her look in your Puffendorff tho' born in Spain she is a native of England her birthright is libertya better patrimonial estate than any of your despotic countries could give her  Sir Tho  Zooks you would tire the patience of Job Pray answer me this is Harriet my daughter  Marg  What then for that inestimable blessing she is not beholden to you nor can you tho' a father with reason justice or law take it from her  Sir Tho  Why Margaret you forget where you are This child is the town of Madrid you are amongst a sage steady people who know and revere the natural rights of a parent  Marg  Natural rights Can a right to tyrannize be founded in nature  Sir Tho  Look'ee Margaret you are but losing your time for unless you can prevail on Count Wall or the president of Castille to grant you a Habeas why Harriet shall stay where she is  Marg  Ay ay you know where you are but  if my niece will take my advice the justice that is denied to her here she will instantly seek for elsewhere  Sir Tho  Elsewhere hark you sister is it thus you answer my purpose in bringing you hither I hop'd to have my daughter's principles form'd by your prudence her conduct directed by your experience and wisdom  Marg  The preliminary is categorically true  Sir Tho  Then why don't you abide by the treaty  Marg  Yes you have given me powerful motives  Sir Tho  But another word madam as I don't chuse that Harriet should imbibe any more of your romantic republican notions I shall take it as a great favour if you would prepare to quit this country with the first opportunity  Marg  You need not have remonstrated a petition would have answered your purpose I did intend to withdraw and without taking leave nor will I reside on a spot where the great charter of my sex is hourly invaded No Sir Thomas I shall return to the land of liberty but there expect to have your despotic dealings properly and publickly handled  Sir Tho  What you design to turn author  Marg  There's no occasion for that liberty has already a champion in one of my sex The same  pen that has dar'd to scourge the arbitrary actions of some of our monarchs shall do equal justice to the oppressive power of parents  Sir Tho  With all my heart  Marg  I may perhaps be too late to get you into the historical text but I promise you you shall be soundly swinged in the marginal note  Enter a Servant who whispers Sir Thomas  Sir Tho  What now  Serv  This instant  Sir Tho  How did he get in  Serv  By a ladder of ropes dropped I suppose by Miss Harriet from the balcony  Sir Tho  That way I reckon he thinks to retreat but I shall prevent him Here Dick do you and Ralph run into the street and front the house with a couple of carbines bid James bring my toledo and let the rest of the fellows follow my steps  Marg  Heyday what can be the meaning of this civil commotion  Sir Tho  Nothing extraordinary only the natural consequence of some of your salutary suggestions  Marg  Mine Sir Thomas  Sir Tho  Yes yours sister Margaret  Marg  I don't understand you  Sir Tho  Oh nothing but Harriet making use  of her great natural charter of liberty by letting young Invoice Abraham Indigo's clerk by the means of a ladder of ropes into her chamber  Marg  I am not surprized  Sir Tho  Nor I neither  Marg  The instant your suspicions gave her a guard I told her the act was tantamount to an open declaration of war and sanctified every stratagem  Sir Tho  You did mighty well madam I hope then for once you will approve my proceedings the law of nations shall be strictly observed you shall see how a spy ought to be treated who is caught in the enemy's camp  Enter Servant with the toledo  Oh here's my trusty toledo Come follow your leader  Exit with Servants  Marg  Oh Sir I shall pursue and reconoitre your motions and tho' no cartel is settled between you take care how you infringe the  jus gentium  Exit Marg  Another chamber Harriet and Invoice discovered  Har  Are you sure you were not observed  Inv  I believe not  Har  Well Mr Invoice you can I think now no longer doubt of my kindness tho' let me tell you you are a good deal indebted for this early proof of it to my father's severity  Inv  I am sorry madam an event so happy for me should proceed from so unlucky a cause But are there no hopes that Sir Thomas may be softened in time  Har  None He is both from nature and habit inflexibly obstinate This too is his favourite foible no German baron was ever more attached to the genealogical laws of alliance than he Marry his daughter to a person in trade no Put his present favourite out of the question he can never be brought to submit to it  Inv  Dear Miss Harriet then why will you hesitate there can be no other alternative you must either submit to marry the count or by flight escape from the  Har  No Mr Invoice not till the last necessity drives me Besides where can we go how subsist whe will receive us  Inv  The world is all before us where to chuse  and as we fly from oppression  Providence our guide  Har  The world Mr Invoice is but a cold kind of common and as to Providence let  us first be sure we deserve its protection  A noise without  Bless me don't I hear some bustle below  Inv  Madam  Har  Hush my father as I live I fear Mr Invoice you are discovered  Inv  No surely  Sir Tho  without  Have you secured all the posts  Serv  without  All Sir  Sir Tho  Both the front and the rear  Serv  Both  Har  Lost past redemption  Sir Tho  Then advance now let us unharbour the rascal  Har  What can we do  Sir Tho  Come madam open your doors  Har  The balcony quick Mr Invoice the balcony  Sir Tho  Unlock Mrs Minx your minion is discovered  Inv  A couple of fellows stand below with their pieces pointed directly against it  Sir Tho  What then you will compel us to batter  Har  The whole house is surrounded how can you escape  Inv  Where will this window conduct us  Har  To the leads that join our house to the chymist's  Inv  To the leads it is but a step there is no danger  Har  Then instantly fly you have every thing to fear from my father  Sir Tho  John fetch the mattock and crow  Inv  And leave my Harriet behind me  Har  Secure yourself and abandon me to my fate  Inv  No madam that I will never do I'll dare your father's utmost resentment  Sir Tho  Where is that rascal aloitering  Har  Then you are lost  Inv  Would my Harriet accompany my flight  Har  Can you desire it  Inv  I do I do my dearest angel I do By all that's sacred your honour shall be as secure with me as in the cell of a saint  Har  But character decency prudence  Inv  The occasion the danger all justify  Sir Tho  Oh what you are come at last  Inv  Determine my life You have but a moment  Har  Should you Mr Invoice deceive me  Inv  When I do may my last hope deceive me  Har  It is a bold a dangerous step  Inv  Fear nothing my love  Advances to the window and gets out  Sir Tho  Drive at the pannel  Marg  without  I enter my protest  Sir Tho  And I will enter the room  Inv  Now leap all is safe  Harriet gets out at the window  Sir Thomas adieu  Sir Tho  Wrench open the lock  Marg  Ay do at your peril  Sir Tho  Down with the door  Marg  Then you shall all be swingeingly sous'd Produce your authority  Sir Tho  Mine  Marg  You have none not so much as the sanction of a general warrant  Sir Tho  What then I see I must do it myself There it goes Pretty law indeed to lock a man out of his own house  Enter Sir Thomas Margaret and Servants  Now MrsHeyday what are become of the parties vanished  Marg  Deceiv'd by your spies no uncommon thing brother for a blundering general  Sir Tho  You are sure you saw him come in  Serv  Certain Sir Thomas  Sir Tho  Then I warrant we will ferret them  out Come lads let not a corner escape you  Exeunt Sir Tho and Servants  Marg  I shall wait on your motions and bring up the rear  Exit  Scene changes to the Chymist's  Enter Invoice and Harriet through the sash  Inv  Safely landed however  Har  Are you sure you are not pursued  Inv  Not a soul Never fear they will hardly venture this road  Har  What a step have you induced me to take to what distress and difficulties have I exposed myself  Inv  Banish your fears and let us look forward my love  Har  Nay I have gone too far to retreat Well Sir what is next to be done  Inv  The Spaniards are naturally generous perhaps upon hearing our story the owner of the house may lend his assistance This I suppose is the Laboratory and this door leads to the shop  Devil  in a bottle  Heighho  Har  Who is that  Inv  That where  Har  Did not you hear a voice  Inv  None Fancy my love only your feats  Devil  Heighho  Har  There again  Inv  I hear it nowWho is there  Devil  Me  Inv  Me he speaks English Who and where are you  Devil  Here in this bottle where I have been cork'd up for these six months  Inv  Cork'd up in a bottle I never heard of such a thing in my life unless indeed in the Haymarket onceCork'd up in a bottle d'ye say  Devil  Ay by the master of this house a magician  Inv  A magician Why then you are a spirit I suppose  Devil  You are right I am the Devil  Har  Mercy on us  Devil  Don't be terrified Miss You remember the old proverb  The Devil is not so black as he is painted  Inv  Well but Sir  Devil  A truce to your questions my good Sir for the presentConsider ramm'd up in this narrow compass I can't be much at my ease now if you will but break the bottle before you on the floor  Har  For heaven's sake Mr Invoice take care what you do  Devil  Why my pretty Miss what risque do you run your affairs can hardly be changed for the worse  Har  That's true indeed  Devil  Believe me Miss as matters stand we can be of mutual use Your lover may deliver me from prison and I can prevent you both from going into confinement  Inv  What says my Harriet shall I rely on the gentleman's word  Devil  Do madam I am a Devil of honour Besides you have but a little time to consider in less than five minutes you will have the Consul and all his crew in the house  Inv  Nay thenPray which is the bottle  Devil  That in the middle right before you  Inv  There it goes  He breaks the bottle and Devil rises out of it Thunder  Har  Oh what a  Devil  I am not surpriz'd Miss that you are a little shock'd at my figure I could have assum'd a much more agreeable form but as we are to be a little better acquainted I thought it best to quit all disguise and pretence therefore madam you see me just as I am  Har  I am sure Sir you are vevevery agreeable  Devil  Yoyoyou are pleas'd to compliment madamCome answer me sincerely am I such a being as you expected to see  Har  Really Sir I can hardly say what I expected to see  Devil  I own it is a puzzling question at least if the world does us justice in the contradictory qualities they are pleas'd to afford us  Inv  You will forgive me if I don't understand you  Devil  Why for all their superlative epithets you cannot but see how much men are beholden to us by our means it is that you measure the extent both of your virtues and vices  Inv  As how  Devil  As thus In describing your friends or your foes they are  devilish  rich  devilish  poor  devilish  ugly  devilish  handsome now and then indeed to vary the mode of conversing you make a little free with our condition and country as  hellish  dull  damn'd  clever  hellish  cold Psha how  damn'd  hot it is  Inv  True Sir but I consider this as a rhetorical figure a manner of speaking devis'd and practis'd by dulness to conceal the lack of ideas and the want of expressions  Devil  Partly that I confess Not but there is some truth in the case for at different times we  have the power and do assume the various forms you assign us  Inv  We I observe you always make use of the plural is that Sir by way of distinction or is your family pretty large and extensive  Devil  Multitudinous as the sands on the beach or the moats in a sunbeam How the deuce else do you think we could do all the business below Why there's scarce an individual amongst you at least of any rank or importance but has five or six of us in his train  Inv  Indeed  Devil  A little before I got rammed in that phial I had been for some time on very hard duty in this part of the world  Inv  Of what kind  Devil  The Daemon of Power and I had long laid siege to a subject the man a grandee I was then a popular spirit and wore the mask of a patriot at different times we possessed him by turns but in the midst of a violent struggle by which means I got lame on this leg and obtained the nickname of the Devil Upon Sticks the Daemon of Vanity a low understrapper amongst us held over his head a circle of gold with five knobs on the top and  whew  flew away with our prize in an instant  Inv  Understrapper what are there different ranks and orders amongst you  Devil  Without doubt  Inv  And pray SirI hope no offence but I would not be wanting in proper respect are you when at home of condition or how must I  Devil  You mean am I a Devil of fashion or one of the base born  Inv  I do  Devil  I have no reason to be asham'd of my family  Inv  I don't doubt it You will forgive me if I make a mistake Perhaps my lord Lucifer  Devil  Who  Inv  Lord Lucifer  Devil  Lord  Lucifer how little you know of our folks Lucifer a  lord  Why that's the meanest rascal amongst us  Inv  Indeed  Devil  Oh a paltry mechanic the very genius of jobbing a mere Bull and Bear booby the patron of lame ducks brokers and fraudulent bankrupts  Inv  You amaze me I vow I always thought him a principal agent  Devil  He Not at all The fellow indeed gave himself some airs of importance upon following the camp and having the Contractors and Commissaries under his care but that affair you know closed with the war  Inv  What then are they now entirely out of his hands  Devil  Yes quite out of his He only suggested their  cent per cent  squeezings and prompted the various modes of extortion and rapine But in his room they have six or seven Daemons apiece to direct the dissipation of their illgotten wealth  Inv  Indeed  Devil  Poor Lucifer it is all over with him if it were not for the fluctuation of India an occasional lottery or a contested election the Alley would be empty and Lucifer have as little to do as a pickpocket when the playhouses are shut  Inv  Perhaps Sir then your name may be Belzebub  Devil  He worse and worse Not a devil that has the least regard to his character would chuse to be seen in his company Besides it is the most petulant waspish quarrelsome cur But no wonder he is the imp of chicane and protects the rotten part of the law  Inv  Then he at least has employment enough  Devil  Yes during the Term he has a good deal to do He is the parent of quibbles the guardian of pettifoggers bad bail and of bailiffs  the supporter of  alibi's  the source of sham pleas the maker and finder of flaws the patron of perjury and a sworn foe to all trials by jury Not long ago though my gentleman was put to his shifts  Inv  How was that  Devil  The law had laid hold of an old friend of his for being too positive as to a matter of fact evidence evasion protraction pleas every art was employed to acquit him that the most consummate skill could suggest but all to no purpose  Inv  That was strange  Devil  Beyond all belief he could have hang'd a dozen innocent people with half the pains that this paltry perjury gave him  Inv  How came that about  Devil  WhyI don't knowhe had unfortunately to do with an obstinate magistrate who bears a mortal hatred to rogues and whose sagacity could not be deceived But however tho' he was not able to save his friend from the shame of conviction a trifle which he indeed but little regarded yet he had the address to evade or at least defer the time of his punishment  Inv  By what means  Devil  By finding a flaw  Inv  A flaw what's a flaw  Devil  A legal loophole that the lawyers leave open for a rogue now and then to creep through that the game mayn't be wholly destroyed  Inv  Provident sportsmen Would it not be too much trouble to favour me with this particular instance  Devil  Not at all Why Sir when matters grew desperate and the case was given over for lost little Belzy starts up in the form of an able practitioner and humbly conceived that his client could not be convicted upon that indictment forasmuch as therein he was charg'd with forswearing himself NOW whereas it clearly appeared by the evidence that he had only forsworn himself THEN If indeed he had been indicted generally for committing perjury  now  AND  then  proofs might be produced of any perjury he may have committed whereas by limiting the point of time to the  now  no proofs could be admitted as to the  then  So that with submission he humbly conceived his client was clearly absolved and his character as fair and as spotless as a babe that's just born and immaculate as a sheet of white paper  Inv  And the objection was good  Devil  Fatal there was no getting rid of the flaw  Inv  And the gentleman  Devil  Walks about at his ease not a public place but he thrusts his person full in your face  Inv  That ought not to be the contempt of the Public that necessary supplement to the bestdigested body of laws should in these cases be never dispensed with  Devil  In days of yore when the world was but young that method had merit and the sense of shame was a kind of a curb but knaves are now so numerous and wealthy they can keep one another in countenance and laugh at the rest of the world  Inv  There may be something in that Well Sir I have twice been out of my guess will you give me leave to hazard a third Perhaps you are Belphegor or Uriel  Devil  Neither They too are but diminutive devils The first favours the petty pilfering frauds he may be traced in the double score and soap'd pot of the publican the allum and chalk of the baker in the sophisticated mixtures of the brewers of wine and of beer and in the false measures and weights of them all  Inv  And Uriel  Devil  He is the Daemon of quacks and of mountebanks a thriving race all over the world but their true seat of empire is England  There a short sword a tye and a nostrum a month's advertising with a shower of handbills never fail of creating a fortune But of this tribe I foresee I shall have occasion to speak hereafter  Inv  Well but Sir  Devil  Come Sir I will put an end to your pain for from my appearance it is impossible you should ever guess at my personNow Miss what think you of Cupid  Har  You you Cupid you the gay god of love  Devil  Yes me me MissWhat I suppose you expected the quiver at my back and the bow in my hand the purple pinions and filleted forehead with the blooming graces of youth and of beauty  Har  Why I can't but say the poets had taught me to expect charms  Devil  That never existed but in the fire of their fancy all fiction and phrenzy  Inv  Then perhaps Sir these creative gentlemen may err as much in your office as it is clear they have mistaken your person  Devil  Why their notions of me are but narrow It is true I do a little business in the amorous way but my dealings are of a different kind to those they describeMy province  lies in forming conjunctions absurd and preposterous It is I that couple boys and beldames girls and greybeards together and when you see a man of fashion lock'd in legitimate wedlock with the stale leavings of half the fellows in town or a lady of fortune setting out for Edinburgh in a postchaise with her footman you may always set it down as some of my handywork But this is but an inconsiderable branch of my business  Inv  Indeed  Devil  The several arts of the drama danceing musick and painting owe their existence to me I am the father of fashions the inventor of  quints trente quarante  and hazard the guardian of gamesters the genius of gluttony and the author protector and patron of licentiousness lewdness and luxury  Inv  Your department is large  Devil  One time or other I may give you a more minute account of these matters at present we have not a moment to lose Should my tyrant return I must expert to be again cork'd up in a bottle  Knocking  And hark it is the consul that knocks at the door therefore be quick how can I serve you  Inv  You are no stranger Sir to our distress Here we are unprotected and friendless could your art convey us to the place of our birth  Devil  To England  Inv  If you please  Devil  Without danger and with great expedition Come to this window and lay hold of my cloakI have often resided in England At present indeed there are but few of our family there every seventh year we have a general dispensation for residence for at that time the inhabitants themselves can play  the devil  without our aid or assistanceOff we go stick fast to your hold  Thunder Exeunt  ACT II  A Street in London  Enter Devil Invoice and Harriet  Devil  WELL my good friends I hope you are not displeased with your journey  Inv  We had no time to be tired  Har  No vehicle was ever so easy  Devil  Then by you mortals what injustice is done us when every crazy creeking jolting jumbling coach is called  the devil of a carriage  Inv  Very true  Devil  Oh amongst you we are horridly used Well Sir you now see I am a Devil of honour and have punctually obeyed your commands But I sha'n't limit my gratitude to a literal compliance with our compact is there any thing else for your service  Inv  Were I not afraid to trespass too much on your time  Devil  A truce to your compliments Tho' they are the common change of the world we know of what base metal the coin is composed  and have cried down the currency Speak your wishes at once  Inv  England Sir is our country it is true but Miss Maxwell being born abroad and my leaving it young have made us both as much strangers to its manners and customs as if you had set us down at Ispahan or Delhi Give us then some little knowledge of the people with whom we are to live  Devil  That task young gentleman is too much even for the Devil himself Where liberty reigns and property is pretty equally spread independence and pride will give each individual a peculiar and separate character When classed in professions indeed they then wear some singular marks that distinguish them from the rest of their race these it may be necessary for you to know  Inv  You will highly oblige me  Devil  And at the same time that I am shewing you persons I will give you some little light into things Health and property you know are the two important objects of human attention You shall first see their state and situation in London  Inv  You mean the practice of physick and law  Devil  I do And as to the first you will find it in some of the professors a science noble salutary and liberal in others a trade as mean as it is mercenary a contemptible combination of  dunces nurses and apothecaries But you have now a lucky opportunity of knowing more in an hour of the great improvements in this branch of civil society than by any other means seven years could have taught you  Inv  Explain if you please  Devil  The spirit of Discord prevails The republic of tied periwigs like the Romans of old have turned their arms from the rest of mankind to draw their short swords on themselves  Inv  But how came this about  Devil  To carry on the metaphor you must know in this great town there are two corps of these troops equally numerous and equally formidable The first it is true are disciplined and fight under a general whom they christen a President The second contains the hussars and pandours of physick they rarely attack a patient together not but the latter singlehanded can do good execution  Inv  But their cause of contention  Devil  Pride The light troops are jealous of some honours the others possess by prescription and though but a militia think they have right to an equal rank with the regulars  Inv  Why this in time may ruin their state  Devil  True but that we must prevent it is our interest to make up this breach Already we  feel the fatal effects of their feuds By neglecting their patients the weekly bills daily decline and new subjects begin to grow scarce in our realms  Inv  This does indeed claim your attention  Devil  We purpose to call in the aid of the law bleeding the purse is as effectual for damping the spirit as opening a vein for lowering the pulse The Daemon of Litigation has already possessed the Licentiates I must infuse the same passion into the President and I warrant you in two or three terms with two or three trials all sides will be heartily tired But apropos I see a brace of apothecaries coming this way they seem deep in debate Let us listen we shall best learn from them the present posture ofHush hideYou shall here too have a proof what a Proteus I am  They retire  Enter Julep and Apozem with a letter  Julep  I tell you Apozem you are but young in the business and don't foresee how much we shall be all hurt in the end  Apozem  Well but what can be done Mr Julep Here Dr Hellebore writes me word that they threaten a siege and are provided with firearms Would you have them surrender the College at once  Julep  Firearms If they are mad enough not  to know that the pen is the doctor's best pistol why let them proceed  Apozem  But are we to stand quietly by and see the very seat of the science demolished and torn  Julep  And with what arms are we to defend it where are our cannon We have mortars indeed but then they are fit to hold nothing but pestles and as to our small arms of what use can they be in a siege they are made you know to attack only the rear  Apozem  Come come Mr Julep you make too light of these matters To have the lawful descendants from Galen the throne of Esculapius overturned by a parcel of Goths  Julep  Peace Apozem or treat your betters with proper respect What numskull do you think all physicians are blockheads who have not washed their hands in the Cam or the Isis  Apozem  Well but I hope you will allow that a universitydoctor  Julep  May for aught you know be a dunce Besides fool what have we to do with degrees The doctor that doses best is the best doctor for us You talk of the College there are some of their names I am sure that I never desire to see on my file  Apozem  Indeed  Julep  Indeed no indeed Why there's Dr Diet that makes such a dust He had a person of fashion a patient of mine under his care t'other day as fine a slow fever I was in hopes of half making my fortune  Apozem  Yes I love a slow fever Was it nervous  Julep  Ay with a lovely dejection of spirits  Apozem  That was delightful indeed I look upon the nerves and the bile to be the two best friends we have to our backWell pray and how did it answer  Julep  Not at all the scoundrel let him slip through my hands for a song only a paltry six pounds and a crown  Apozem  Shameful  Julep  Infamous and yet forsooth he was one of your College Well now to shew you the difference in men but the very week after Dr Linctus from Leyden run me up a bill of thirty odd pounds for only attending Alderman Soakpot six days in a surfeit  Apozem  Ay that was doing of business  Julep  Ah that's a sweet pretty practitioner Apozem We must all do our utmost to push him  Apozem  Without doubt But notwithstanding all that you say Mr Julep there are some of the gentlemen of the College that I know  Julep  Ah as fine fellows as ever fingered a pulse not one of the trade will deny it  Apozem  But amongst all now old Nat Nightshade is the man for my money  Julep  Yes Nat Nat has merit I own but pox take him he is so devilish quick To be sure he has a very pretty fluent pen whilst it lasts but then he makes such dispatch that one has hardly time to send in two dozen of draughts  Apozem  Yes the doctor drives on to be sure  Julep  Drives on If I am at all free in the house when old Nightshade is sent for as a preparatory dose I always recommend an attorney  Apozem  An attorney for what  Julep  To make the patient's will before he swallows the doctor's prescription  Apozem  That is prudent  Julep  Yes I generally afterwards get the thanks of the family  Apozem  What Mr Julep for the attorney or the physician ha ha  Julep  Ha ha you are arch little Apozem quite a wag I profess  Apozem  Why you know brother Julep these are subjects upon which one can hardly be serious  Julep  True true but then you should never laugh loud in the street We may indulge indeed a kind of simpering smile to our patients as we  drive by in our chariots but then there is a decency not to say dignity that becomes the publick deméanour of us who belong to the faculty  Apozem  True And yet there are times when one can hardly forbear Why t'other day now I had like to have burst I was following a funeral into St George'sa sweet pretty burying velvet pall hatband and gloves and indeed the widow was quite handsome in all things paid my bill the next week without sconcing off sixpence though they were thought to have lived happily togetherbut as I was asaying as we were entering the church who should stand in the porch but Kit Cabbage the taylor with a new pair of breeches under his arm The sly rogue made me a bow  "Servant master Apozem" says he "what you are carrying home your work too I see"  Did you ever hear such a dog  Julep  Ay ay let them let themBut is not that Dr Squib that is crossing the way  Apozem  Yes you may see it is Squib by his shuffle What I suppose now he is scouring away for the College  Julep  Who Squib how little you know of him he did not care if all our tribe was tipped into the Thames  Apozem  No  Julep  No Lord help you he is too much taken up with the national illness to attend to particular ails Why he would quit the best patient in town to hunt after a political secret and would rather have a whisper from a great man in the Court of Requests than five hundred pounds for attending him in a chronical case  Apozem  WonderfulWho can that dirty boy be that he has in his hand  Julep  One of his scouts I supposeWe shall see  Reenter Devil as Dr Squib and

Julep  Ay ay  Squib  Who rouzes Britannia by tickling her nose with that straw she starts and with a jerk  starting strikes Julep  I beg pardonand with a jerk knocks the bottle of laudanum out of his hand and so by that there means you see Britannia is delivered from death  Julep  Ay ay  Squib  Hey you swallow the satire Pretty bitter I think  Julep  I can't say that I quite understandthat isaa

prescription at all at all For what signifies a palliative regiment with such a rotten constitution May I never finger a pulse as long as I live if you get their voluntary consent to go in unless indeed it be by compulsion  Osas  I entirely coincide with my very capable countryman Dr Sligo d'ye see and do give my advice in this consultation for putting the whole College under a course of steel without further delay  Sligo  I am much obligated to you for your  kind compliment doctor But pray what may your name be  Osas  Dr Osasafras at your humble service  Sligo  I am your very obadient alsho I have hard tell of your name But what did you mane by my countryman Pray doctor of what nation are you  Osas  Sir I have the honour to be a native of Ireland  Sligo  Osasafras that's a name of no note he is not a Milesian I am sure The family I suppose came over t'other day with Strongbow not above seven or eight hundred years ago or perhaps a descendant from one of Oliver's drummers'Pon my conscience doctor I should hardly belave you were Irish  Osas  What Sir d'ye doubt my veracity  Sligo  Not at all my dear doctor it is not for that But between me and yourself you have lived a long time in this town  Osas  Like enough  Sligo  Ay and was here a great while before ever I saw it  Osas  What of that  Sligo  Very well my dear doctor Then putting that and t'other together my notion of the upshot is that if so be you are a native of Ireland upon my conscience you must have been born there very young  Osas  Young ay to be sure Why my soul I was christened there  Sligo  Ay  Osas  Ay was I in the county of Meath  Sligo  Oh that alters the property that makes it as clear as FleetDitch I should be glad countryman of your nearer acquaintance But what little slim doctor is that in his own head of hair I don't recollect to have seen his features before  Osas  Nor I to my knowledge  Sligo  Perhaps he may be able to tell me if I aks him himselfI am proud to see you doctor on this

 Botany  Sligo  Botany in what college  Macp  The university of St Andrews  Osas  Pray doctor is not botany a very dry sort of a study  Sligo  Most damnably so in those parts my dear doctor for all the knowledge they have they must get from dried herbs becaase the devil of any green that will grow there  Macp  Sir your information is wrong  Sligo  Come my dear doctor hold your palaver and don't be after puffing on us becaase why you know in your conscience that in your part of the world you get no cabbage but thistles and those you are oblig'd to raise upon hotbeds  Macp  Thistles zounds Sir

 None at all There is in the whole catalogue but one sin you need be at all shy of committing  Inv  What's that  Devil  Simony  Inv  Simony I don't comprehend you  Devil  Simony Sir is a new kind of canon devised by these upstart fanatics that makes it sinful not to abuse the confidence and piously plunder the little property of an indigent man and his family  Inv  A most noble piece of casuistical cookery and exceeds even the sons of Ignatius But this honour I must beg to decline  Devil  What think you then of trying the stage You are a couple of good theatrical figures but how are your talents can you sing  Inv  I can't boast of much skill Sir but Miss Harriet got great reputation in Spain  Har  Oh Mr InvoiceMy father Sir as we seldom went out established a domestic kind of drama and made us perform some little musical pieces that were occasionally sent us from England  Devil  Come Sir will you give us a taste of yourjust a short  te ti te tor  Sings a short preludio  Inv  I must beg to be excused Sir I have not a musical note in my voice that can please you  Devil  No Why then I believe we must  trouble the lady Come Miss I'll charm a band to accompany you  Waves his stick  Harriet sings  Devil  Exceedingly well You have nothing to do now but to offer yourselves to one of the houses  Inv  And which Sir would you recommend  Devil  Take your choice for I can serve you in neither  Inv  No I thought Sir you told me just now that the several arts of the drama were under your direction  Devil  So they were formerly but now they are directed by the Genius of Insipidity He has entered into partnership with the managers of both houses and they have set up a kind of circulating library for the vending of dialogue novels I dare not go near the new house for the Daemon of Power who gave me this lameness has possessed the pates and sown discord among the mock monarchs there and what one receives the other rejects And as to the other house the manager has great merit himself with skill to discern and candor to allow it in others but I can be of no use in making your bargain for in that he would be too many for the cunningest Devil amongst us  Inv  I have heard of a new playhouse in the Haymarket  Devil  What Foote's Oh that's an eccentric narrow establishment a mere summerfly He But however it may do for a  coup d'essai  and prove no bad foundation for a future engagement  Inv  Then we will try him if you please  Devil  By all means And you may do it this instant he opens tonight and will be glad of your assistance I'll drop you down at the door and must then take my leave for some time  Allons  but don't tremble you have nothing to fear The public will treat you with kindness at least if they shew but half the indulgence to you that they have upon all occasions shewn to that Manager  FINIS
