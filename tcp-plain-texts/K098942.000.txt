 POEMS  POEMS BY A GENTLEMAN  AMAT NEMUS ET FUGIT URBES  HORACE  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXII  COLIN's ELEGY On Revisiting the Place where he first became acquainted with DELIA  Indeed said  Lucid  I have often heard  Faire  Rosalind  of divers fowly blamed  For being to that Swaine too cruel hard  That her bright glorie else hath much defamed  Spenser's Colin Clout's come home again  YET once again by wayward fortune led  I view the sacred walls where dwelt my fair  Where blest with her my days in rapture fled  Too soon alloy'd and shaded with despair  Three years are past since first my yielding heart  It's virgin vows to love and  Delia  paid  Sincere itself it ne'er suspected art  And ah what changes those three years have made  Young  Corydon  to whom the fair one gave  Her earliest faith and holiest union vow'd  Sleeps in the silent chamber of the grave  And for a wedding garment wears a shroud  Large tides of grief in  Delia  's bosom roll'd  But soon  Dametas  dried the mourner's tears  Dametas  rich but petulant and old  And damn'd with jealousy the crime of years  What need I moreby treach'rous friends deceiv'd  He mark'd each venial fault with jaundic'd eyes  Each paltry tale with partial ear believ'd  And construed Indiscretion into Vice  Now banish'd from a husband's board she mourns  Her woes embitter'd by a parent's frown  Condemn'd rejected for a crime she scorns  And like a dream her transient glories flown  Fair daughter of the morn thy star is set  Thy star is set nor ever more must rise  O may no wrongs of mine in judgment met  Swell thy full soul's distress with added cries  We might have liv'dAh sadly pleasing thought  Vain Recollection What art thou to me  We might have liv'd As virtuous love had taught  In unreproved pleasures ever free  We might have liv'dBut execrable gold  Love's unsubstantial claims and tears outweigh'd  For wealth her charms the venal  Delia  sold  For wealth her lover and her friend betray'd  For me who now with pain review the place  Where once my  Delia  call'd her  Colin  dear  Each wellknown path with aching heart retrace  Think on her  ickleness and drop a tear  Silent and sole I seek th' accustom'd bow'r  The Bow'r once sacred to my love and me  Where oft with her I pass'd th' enraptur'd hour  And bore the syren charmer on my knee  I seek the Plane whose trunk with mine combin'd  Bears the dear letters of my  Delia  's name  I mark their growth but that distracts my mind  For such I once had hop'd our mutual flame  E'en while I write these scenes of former bliss  Such fond reflections in my bosom move  What then my fortune was what now it is  That though I can't esteem I still must love  I love but 'tis not with that youthful heat  Which once inflam'd my soul to reason blind  'Tis with that soothing grief that soft regret  Which those who think on friends departed find  I grieve but 'tis a calm and virtuous woe  By reason sanctified by heav'n approv'd  'Tis such as kindred saints in heaven might know  Seeing those fall whom when on earth they lov'd  Time and reflection long have chas'd away  The painted phantoms that bewitch'd my sight  God's wise behests submissive I obey  And own convinc'd "Whatever is is right"  Vain love farewellfor me should heav'n design  Such added blessing to my future life  Soon may I call th' ingenuous  Mira  mine  And meet unwarpt by love a virtuous wife  COLIN TO HIS FRIENDS Exhorting him to the attainment of Honours by a steady Application to the LAW  "Business too oft the frivolous pretence  "Of human lusts to shake off innocence  "Business the grave impertinence  "Business the thing which I of all things hate  "Business the contradiction of thy fate  Cowley's ComplaintThe muse speaks  MY friends no moreyour kind remonstrance spare  Your kind remonstrance your advice is vain  Conscious I shall not answer half your care  It serves no purpose but to give me pain  I cannot feel one wish for pomp or pow'r  I seek no titles I desire no place  Born as I was in unambitious hour  I scorn the prize and can I run the race  When  Westminster Hall  in  the Courts  I take my silent stand  Unenvious I behold the judge's state  Behold with pitying eye Law's restless band  And wonder man will bustle to be great  Onward I passA soberer scene succeeds  Westminster Abbey  'Tis the sad mansion of departed kings  Where every stone that blazons forth their deeds  Proclaims the vanity of earthly things  Proclaims th' aspiring croud I left behind  Mere insect swarms that shine but for an hour  Then nipt by cold or shatter'd by the wind  Fleet like the transient bow that gilds a show'r  Shall I then sacrifice life's happiest prime  To gain employments I should wish to shun  Enslave the sacred freedom of my time  To win a title I should hate when won  NoLet me live with independence blest  Blest with the sweets of no unlearned ease  Indulge th' unruffl'd calm my soul loves best  And eat my bread in privacy and peace  One sole inducement could have rous'd my mind  That sole inducement has been long no more  Delia  was falsewith her at once resign'd  Fled all the schemes I ever form'd for pow'r  Had she been mine what could not I have done  To give that wealth she now has bought so dear  What prize so great that I could not have won  When all my efforts were inspir'd by her  Now for myself I liveWith books my morn  With friends perchance my evening hours are spent  The rich man's wonder and the proud man's scorn  I envy neither for I feel content  Free unconstrain'd my country's laws I choose  Those laws by which e'en monarchs are control'd  Their changes trace their origin deduce  But do it for instruction not for gold  Thus let me live till manhood's steadier day  Matures the seeds that lab'ring youth has sown  Then might some fav'ring female chastly gay  Wise without pride and fair without a frown  Would such a one from mean coquetry free  Who held her word as sacred as her fame  Would  Mira  plight her spotless faith to me  And at the altar grace her  Colin  's name  Blest beyond hope how gladly I'd forswear  The wild fantastick pageants  London  yields  To breathe the country's pure untainted air  That sweeps with fresh'ning breeze the newplough'd fields  Me rural scenes me woods and streams can please  That through the fertile vales irriguous rove  Here let me stretch my wearied limbs at ease  For I inglorious woods and streams can love  Happy the man whose philosophick eye  Could to their causes Nature's workings trace  Could learn from thence death's terrors to defy  And joy to meet his Maker face to face  Blest too is he whom woods and streams can charm  Whose humble thoughts to lesser flights aspire  Who tunes his heart with thankful rapture warm  To Nature's bounteous lord the rural lyre  No toil of office ruffles his repose  No purpled monarch's proud unyielding state  Unvers'd in publick scenes he little knows  The loud discordant senate's vain debate  He little knows th' embattled pow'rs that join  From  Britain's  grasp her western world to rend  Nor sees her sick'ning Genius droop and pine  Nor deems her less'ning glories near their end  Untost by storms he gently glides through life  His fields his trees give sweet though simple fare  He scapes the madding town's unholy strife  He scapes the noisy clamours of the Bar  THE DELIGHTS OF FANCY  On the green bank I sat and listen'd long  Sitting was more convenient for the song  Nor till her lay was ended could I move  But wish'd to dwell for ever in the grove  Only methought the time too swiftly pass'd  And every note I fear'd would be the last  My sight and smell and hearing were employ'd  And all three senses in full gust enjoy'd  And what alone did all the rest surpass  The sweet possession of the fairy place  Single and conscious to myself alone  Of pleasures to th' excluded world unknown  Pleasures which no where else were to be found  And all Elysium in a spot of ground  Dryden  's  flower and leaf  imitated from  Chaucer  Again the summer shines with mightier flame  The Sun exults his lengthen'd course to roll  And wide diffuses through the human frame  A languid bliss that melts the poet's soul  It melts the soul but gives the pow'r to sing  Those visionary scenes itself inspires  Tunes it to harmonies of noblest string  And bids it glow with more than mortal fires  Great Life of all the world and Lord of day  Best symbol of our common Maker's might  Well might th' unguided heathen thee obey  And prostrate hail thy orb's returning light  For oft myself have felt thy rapt'rous heat  Steal o'er my senses like a fairy dream  Then when my yielding limbs have sought retreat  And sunk in silence near some shaded stream  My soul on Fancy's wing sublimely borne  Hath mus'd of scenes too bright for mortal eye  Hath seen white robes by saints and martyrs worn  And heard th' eternal carols of the sky  Oft too luxuriant Fancy reigns alone  And calls from fablers old a varying band  And scenes of bliss to waking life unknown  Rise change and vanish as she gives command  Imagination works with all her pow'rs  And gorgeous Knights in glitt'ring troops are seen  And courteous squires and dwarfs and moated tow'rs  And all the splendours of the gothick scene  Bards too of other times resume their lyres  The glorious tale that  Chaucer's  Knight hath told  Sounds in mine ears and fills me with its fires  And now the jousting warriours I behold  And  Palamon  is to the stake convey'd  Now from the earth upstarts th' infernal fiend  Now dying  Arcite  wills the dear bought maid  If she can ever love to love his friend  Anon  See Spenser's Faerie Queene  prince  Arthur  's blazing shield o'erthrows  The giant conqueror of the Red Cross Knight  Or ruthless  Talus  drives his host of foes  With unrelenting flail and iron might  Dear scenes of blest delusion golden dreams  And always innocent and always new  Where oft with truths sublime the fiction teems  And Virtue's noblest patterns strike the view  Ye feed the fancy nor seduce the heart  For from our reach remote your actions lie  No youth can now assume  Pyrochles'  part  No modern maid like poor  See Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia  Parthenia  die  Not so the spurious and destructive brood  The graceless toys of more enlighten'd times  That teach the child to languish to be woo'd  Create her follies and contrive her crimes  These clear the paths to ruin and to shame  Perhaps by these poor  Delia  was undone  Delia  whose lost and desolated fame  Friendship can only weep and virtue shun  But O the gorgeous tales of earlier days  Where fancy shines in mystick fiction bright  Where chastity is woman's fairest praise  And virtue's cause inspires the vent'rous knight  Be these my choice and who by these refin'd  Would bear the bus'ness of life's publick croud  Would change these wand'rings of th' enchanted mind  For all the splendid slav'ry of the proud  But these to few are giv'nunknown they lie  Unsought unhonour'd by the venal herd  Where purseproud wealth can injur'd worth defy  And poverty alone is shunn'd and fear'd  Unknown they lie where sturdy labour lives  And earns with ceaseless care his scanty meal  Oft too where chance the pow'rs of leisure gives  Superior fate denies the pow'r to feel  Yet some perchance in this tempestuous time  Some still remain and sure not meanly blest  Whose rambling thoughts have reach'd this rapt'rous clime  And view'd these scenes of fancy and of rest  For them all nature breathes elysian grace  And sweets ambrosial stream from every flow'r  Fairies for them the greensward ringlets trace  And magick's mightiest influence guards their bow'r  And should blest Competence from heav'n descend  And from a patron's will their freedom save  To such congenial with myself I'll bend  And consecrate the verse these visions gave  THE END
