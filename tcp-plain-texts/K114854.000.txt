the following Volume we need only say that it contains the Remainder of those Miscellaneous Pieces which were in some sort promised in the Preface to the former Volumes or which have been written since The  Verses  are paged separately that they may be added to that  Volume which wholly consists of Verse and the Treatise of the  Bathos  placed in their stead in This The Reader may be assured no other Edition is either Genuine or Compleat and that they are all the Things of this Kind which will ever be Printed by the same Hands  There are in this Volume as in the former one or two small pieces by other Hands  THE NARRATIVE OF Dr  Robert Norris  CONCERNING The  Strange  and  Deplorable  FRENZY of Mr  J  N D  IS  an Officer of the Customhouse  IT is an acknowledg'd Truth that nothing is so dear to an honest Man as his good Name nor ought he to neglect the just Vindication of his Character when it is injuriously attack'd by any Man The Person I have at present Cause to complain of is indeed in very melancholy Circumstances it having pleas'd God to deprive him of his Senses which may extenuate the Crime in Him But I should be wanting in my Duty not only to my self but also to my FellowCreatures to whom my  Talents may prove of benefit shou'd I suffer my Profession or Honesty to be undeservedly aspers'd I have therefore resolv'd to give the Publick an account of all that has past between that unhappy Gentleman and my self  On the  th  instant while I was in my Closet pondering the Case of one of my Patients I heard a Knocking at my Door upon opening of which enter'd an old Woman with Tears in her Eyes and told me that without my Assistance her Master would be utterly ruin'd I was forc'd to interrupt her Sorrow by enquiring her Master's Name and Place of Abode She told me he was one Mr  D  is  an Officer of the Customhouse who was taken ill of a violent Frenzy last  April  and had continu'd in those melancholy Circumstances with few or no Intervals Upon this I ask'd her some Questions relating to his Humour and Extravagancies that I might the better know under what Regimen to put him when the Cause of his Distemper was found out Alas Sir says she this Day fortnight in the Morning a poor simple Child came to him from the Printer's the Boy had no sooner enter'd the Room but he cry'd out  the Devil was come  He often stares ghastfully raves aloud and mutters between his Teeth the Word  Cator  or  Cato  or some such thing Now Doctor this  Cator  is certainly a  Witch  and my poor Master is under an evil Tongue for I have heard him say  Cator  has bewitch'd the whole Nation It pitied my very Heart to think that a Man of my Master's Understanding and great Scholarship who as the  Child told me had a Book of his own in Print should talk so outragiously Upon this I went and laid out a Groat for a Horshoe which is at this time nail'd on the Threshold of his Door but I don't find my Master is at all the better for it he prepetually starts and runs to the Window when any one knocks crying out  S' death a Messenger from the French King I shall die in the  Bastile  Having said this the Old Woman presented me with a Viol of his Urine upon Examination of which I preceiv'd the whole Temperament of his Body to be exceeding  hot  I therefore instantly took my Cane and my Beaver and repair'd to the Place where he dwelt  When I came to his Lodgings near  CharingCross  up  three Pair  of Stairs which I should not have publish'd in this manner but that this Lunatick  conceals  the Place of his Residence on purpose to prevent the good Offices of those charitable  Friends  and  Physicians  who might attempt his Cure when I came into the Room I found this unfortunate Gentleman seated on his Bed with Mr  Bernard Lintott  Bookseller on the one side of him and a grave elderly Gentleman on the other who as I have since learnt calls himself a  Grammarian  the Latitude of whose Countenance was not a little eclips'd by the Fullness of his Peruke As I am a black lean Man of a pale Visage and hang my Clothes on somewhat slovenly I no sooner went in but he frown'd upon me and cry'd out with violence  '  S'Death  a  Frenchman  I am betray'd to the Tyrant who cou'd have thought the  Queen would have deliver'd me up to  France  in this Treaty and least of all that you my Friends wou'd have been in a Conspiracy against me'  Sir said I here is neither Plot nor Conspiracy but for your advantage The Recovery of your Senses requires my Attendance and your Friends sent for me on no other account I then took a particular Survey of his Person and the Furniture and Disposition of his Apartment His Aspect was furious his Eyes were rather fiery than lively which he roll'd about in an uncommon manner He often open'd his Mouth as if he wou'd have utter'd some Matter of Importance but the Sound seem'd lost inwardly His Beard was grown which they told me he would not suffer to be shav'd believing the modern Dramatick Poets had corrupted all the Barbers in the Town to take the first Opportunity of cutting his Throat His Eyebrows were grey long and grown together which he knit with Indignation when any thing was spoken insomuch that he seem'd not to have smooth'd his Forehead for many Years His Flannel Night Cap which was exceedingly begrim'd with Sweat and Dirt hung upon his Left Ear the Flap of his Breeches dangled between his Legs and the Rolls of his Stockings fell down to his Ankles  I observ'd his Room was hung with  old Tapestry  which had several Holes in it caus'd as the Old Woman inform'd me by his having cut out of it the Heads of divers  Tyrants  the Fierceness of whose Visages had much provoked him On all sides of his Room were pinned a great  many Sheets of a Tragedy called  Cato  with Notes on the Margin with his own Hand The Words  Absurd Monstrous Execrable  were every where written in such large Characters that I could read them without my Spectacles By the Freside lay Threefarthingsworth of Smallcoal in a  Spectator  and behind the Door huge Heaps of Papers of the same Title which his Nurse inform'd me she had convey'd thither out of his sight believing they were Books of the Black Art for her Master never read in them but he was either quite  mop'd  or in  raving Fits  There was nothing neat in the whole Room except some Books on his Shelves very well bound and gilded whose Names I had never before heard of nor I believe are any where else to be found such as  Gibraltar a Comedy Remarks on Prince Arthur the Grounds of Criticism in Poetry an Essay on publick Spirit  The only one I had any Knowledge of was a  Paradise Lost  interleav'd The whole Floor was cover'd with Manuscripts as thick as a Pastry Cook's Shop on a Christmas Eve On his Table were some Ends of Verse and of Candles a Gallipot of Ink with a yellow Pen in it and a Pot of halfdead Ale cover'd with a  Longinus  As I was casting my Eyes round on all this odd Furniture with some Earnestness and Astonishment and in a profound Silence I was on a sudden surpriz'd to hear the Man speak in the following manner  "Beware Doctor that it fare not with you as with your Predecessor the famous  Hippocrates  whom the mistaken Citizens of  Abdera  sent  for in this very manner to cure the Philosopher  Democritus  he return'd full of Admiration at the Wisdom of that Person whom he had suppos'd a Lunatic Behold Doctor it was thus  Aristotle  himself and all the great Antients spent their Days and Nights wrapt up in Criticism and beset all around with their own Writings As for me whom you see in the same manner be assur'd I have none other Disease than a Swelling in my Legs whereof I say no more since your Art may further certify you"  I began now to be in hopes that his Case had been misrepresented and that he was not so far gone but some timely Medicines might recover him I therefore proceeded to the proper Queries which with the Answers made to me I shall set down in Form of Dialogue in the very Words they were spoken because I would not omit the least Circumstance in this Narrative and I call my Conscience to witness as if upon Oath that I shall tell the Truth without addition or diminution  Doct  Pray Sir how did you contract this Swelling  Denn  By a Criticism  Doct  A Criticism that's a Distemper I never read of  Denn  S'Death Sir a Distemper It is no Distemper but a Noble Art I have sat fourteen Hours a Day at it and are you a Doctor and don't know there's a Communication between the Legs and the Brain  Doct  What made you sit so many Hours Sir  Denn  Cato  Sir  Doct  Sir I speak of your Distemper what gave you this Tumor  Denn  Cato Cato Cato  Remarks on  Cato  published by Mr  D  in the Year  Old Wom  For God's sake Doctor name not this evil Spirit 'tis the whole Cause of his Madness Alas poor Master's just falling into his Fits  Mr  Lintott  Fits Z  what Fits A Man may well have Swellings in his Legs that sits writing fourteen Hours in a Day He got this by the  Remarks  Doct  The  Remarks  what are those  Denn  S'Death have you never read my Remarks I will be damn'd if this Dog  Lintott  ever publish'd my Advertisements  Mr  Lint  Z  I publish'd Advertisement upon Advertisement and if the Book be not read it is none of my fault but his that made it By G  as much has been done for the Book as cou'd be done for any Book in Christendom  Doct  We do not talk of Books Sir I fear those are the Fuel that feed his  Delirium  mention them no more You do very ill to promote this Discourse  I desire a Word in private with this other Gentleman who seems a grave and sensible Man I suppose Sir you are his Apothecary  Gent  Sir I am his Friend  Dr  I doubt it not What Regimen have you observ'd since he has been under your Care You remember I suppose the Passage of  Celsus  which says if the Patient on the third Day have an Interval suspend the Medicaments at Night let Fumigations be used to corroborate the Brain I hope you have upon no Account promoted Sternutation by Hellebore  Gent  Sir no such matter you utterly mistake  Dr  Mistake Am I not a Physician and shall an Apothecary dispute my  Nostrums  You may perhaps have fill'd up a Prescription or two of  Ratcliff  's which chanced to succeed and with that very Prescription injudiciously prescrib'd to different Constitutions have destroy'd a Multitude  Pharmacopola componat Medicus solus prescribat  Fumigate him I say this very Evening while he is relieved by an Interval  Denn  S'Death Sir my Friend an Apothecary a base Mechanic He who like my self professes the noblest Sciences in the Universe Criticism and Poetry Can you think I would submit my Writings to the Judgment of an Apothecary By the Immortals he himself inserted three whole Paragraphs in my  Remarks  had a Hand in my  Publick Spirit  nay assisted me in my Description of the  Furies and infernal Regions  in my  Appius  Mr  Lintott  He is an Author you mistake the Gentleman Doctor he has been an Author these twenty Years to his Bookseller's Knowledge and no Man's else  Denn  Is all the Town in a Combination Shall Poetry fall to the Ground Must our Reputation be lost to all foreign Countries O Destruction Perdition  He wrote a Treatise proving the Decay of Publick Spirit to proceed from  Italian  Opera's  Opera Opera  As Poetry once rais'd Cities so when Poetry fails Cities are overturn'd and the World is no more  Dr  He raves he raves Mr  Lintott  I pray you pinion down his Arms that he may do no Mischief  Denn  O I am sick sick to Death  Dr  That is a good Symptom a very good Symptom To be sick to Death say the modern Physicians is an excellent Symptom When a Patient is sensible of his Pain 'tis half a Cure Pray Sir of what are you sick  Denn  Of every thing Of every thing I am sick of the  Sentiments  of the  Diction  of the  Protasis  of the  Epitasis  and the  Catastrophe  Alas what is become of the  Drama  the  Drama  Old Wom  The  Dram  Sir Mr  Lintott  drank up all the Gin just now but I'll go fetch more presently  Denn  O shameful Want scandalous Omission By all the Immortals here is no  Peripaetia  no Change of Fortune in the Tragedy Z  no Change at all  Old Wom  Pray good Sir be not angry I'll fetch  Change  Dr  Hold your Peace Woman his Fit increases good Mr  Lintott  hold him  Mr  Lintott  Plague on't I am damnably afraid they are in the right of it and he is mad in earnest If he should be really mad who the Devil will buy the  Remarks  Here Mr  Lintott  scratch'd his Head  Doct  Sir I shall order you the cold Bath to morrowMr  Lintott  you are a sensible Man pray send for Mr  Verdier  's Servant and as you are a friend to the Patient be so kind as to stay this Evening whilst he is cupp'd on the Head The Symptoms of his Madness seem to be desperate for  Avicen  says that if Learning be mix'd with a Brain that is not of a Contexture fit to receive it the Brain ferments till it be totally exhausted We must eradicate these undigested Ideas out of the  Perecranium  and reduce the Patient to a competent Knowledge of himself  Denn  Caitiffs stand off unhand me Misoreants Is the Man whose whole Endeavours are to bring the Town to Reason mad is the Man who settles Poetry on the Basis of Antiquity mad Dares any one assert there is a  Peripaetia  in that vile Piece that's foisted upon the Town for a Dramatick Poem That Man is mad the Town is mad the World is mad See  Longinus  in my right Hand and  Aristotle  in my left I am the only Man among the Moderns that support them Am I to be assassinated and shall a Bookseller who hath liv'd upon my Labours take away that Life to which he owes his Support  Gent  By your Leave Gentlemen I apprehend you not I must not see my Friend ill  treated he is no more affected with Lunacy than my self I am also of the same Opinion as to the  Peripaetia  Sir by the Gravity of your Countenance and Habit I would conceive you to be a graduate Physician but by your indecent and boisterous Treatment of this Man of Learning I perceive you are a violent sort of  Person  I am loath to say  Quack  who rather than his Drugs should lie upon his own Hands would get rid of them by cramming them into the Mouths of others The Gentleman is of good Condition sound Intellectuals and unerring Judgment I beg you will not oblige me to resent these Proceedings  THESE were all the Words that pass'd among us at this Time nor was there need for more it being necessary we should make use of Force in the Cure of my Patient  I privately whisper'd the old Woman to go to Mr  Verdier  's in  LongAcre  with Orders to come immediately with Cupping Glasses in the mean time by the Assistance of Mr  Lintott  we lock'd his Friend into a Closet who 'tis plain from his last Speech was likewise touch'd in his Intellects after which we bound our Lunatick Hand and Foot down to the Bedsted where he continued in violent Ravings notwithstanding the most tender Expressions we could use to perswade him to submit to the Operation till the Servant of  Verdier  arrived He had no sooner clapp'd half a dozen Cupping Glasses on his Head and behind his Ears but the Gentleman abovemention'd bursting open the Closet ran furiously  upon us cut Mr  D  is  's Bandages and let drive at us with a vast Folio which sorely bruis'd the Shin of Mr  Lintott  Mr  John D  is  also starting up with the Cupping Glasses on his Head seized another Folio and with the same dangerously wounded me in the Skull just above my right Temple The Truth of this Fact Mr  Verdier  's Servant is ready to attest upon Oath who taking an exact Survey of the Volumes found that which wounded my Head to be  Gruterus  's  Lampas Critica  and that which broke Mr  Lintott  's Shin was  Scaliger's Poetices  After this Mr  John D  is  strengthen'd at once by Rage and Madness snatch'd up a PerukeBlock that stood by the Bedside and weilded it round in so furious a Manner that he broke three of the Cupping Glasses from the Crown of his Head so that much Blood trickled down his VisageHe look'd so ghastly and his Passion was grown to such a prodigious Height that my self Mr  Lintott  and  Verdier  's Servant were oblig'd to leave the Room in all the Expedition imaginable  I took Mr  Lintott  home with me in order to have our Wounds drest and laid hold of that Opportunity of entering into Discourse with him about the Madness of this Person of whom he gave me the following remarkable Relation  That on the th of  May  between the Hours of and in the Morning Mr  John D  is  enter'd into his Shop and opening one of the Volumes of the  Spectator  in the large Paper did suddenly without the least Provocation tear out that of Nowhere the Author treats  of Poetical Justice and cast it into the Street That the said Mr  John D  is  on the  th  of  March  finding on the said Mr  Lintott  's Counter a Book called an  Essay on Criticism  just then publish'd he read a Page or two with much Frowning till coming to these two Lines  Some have at first for Wits then Poets past  Turn'd Ctiticks next and prov'd plain Fools at last  He flung down the Book in a terrible Fury and cried out  By G  d he means Me  That being in his Company on a certain Time when  Shakespear  was mention'd as of a contrary Opinion to Mr  Dennis  he swore the said  Shakespear  was a  Rascal  with other defamatory Expressions which gave Mr  Lintott  a very ill Opinion of the said  Shakespear  That about two Months since he came again into the Shop and cast several suspicious Looks on a Gentleman that stood by him after which he desired some Information concerning that Person He was no sooner acquainted that the Gentleman was a new Author and that his first Piece was to be publish'd in a few Days but he drew his Sword upon him and had not my Servant luckily catch'd him by the Sleeve I might have lost one Author upon the spot and another the next Sessions  Upon recollecting all these Circumstances Mr  Lintott  was entirely of Opinion that he had been mad for some Time and I doubt not but this whole Narrative must sufficiently convince  the World of the excess of his Frenzy It now remains that I give the Reasons which obliged me in my own Vindication to publish this whole unfortunate Transaction  In the first place Mr  John D  is  had industriously caused to be reported that I enter'd into his Room  Vi Armis  either out of a Design to deprive him of his Life or of a new Play called  Cariolanus  which he has had ready for the Stage these Four Years  Secondly He hath given out about  Fleetstreet  and the  Temple  that I was an Accomplice with his Bookseller who visited him with Intent to take away divers valuable Manuscripts without paying him CopyMoney  Thirdly He hath told others that I am no Graduate Physician and that he had seen me upon a Mountebank Stage in  Moorfields  when he had Lodgings in the College there  Fourthly Knowing that I had much Practice in the City he reported at the  Royal Exchange Customhouse  and other Places adjacent that I was a foreign Spy employ'd by the  French  King to convey him into  France  that I bound him Hand and Foot and that if his Friend had not burst from his Confinement to his Relief he had been at this Hour in the  Bastile  All which several Assertions of his are so very extravagant as well as inconsistent that I appeal to all Mankind whether this Person be not out of his Senses I shall not decline giving and producing further Proofs of this Truth in open Court if he drives the Matter so far In the mean  time I heartily forgive him and pray that the Lord may restore him to the full Enjoyment of his Understanding So wisheth as becometh a Christian  Robert Norris M D  From my House on  Snowhill  July the th  God Save the Queen  A full and true ACCOUNT OF A Horrid and Barbarous REVENGE by POISON On the Body of Mr  EDMUND CURLL  Bookseller With a faithful COPY of his Last WILL and TESTAMENT  HISTORY furnishes us with Examples of many Satyrical  Authors  who have fallen Sacrifices to Revenge but not of any  Booksellers  that I know of except the unfortunate Subject of the following Paper I mean Mr  Edmund Curll  at the  Bible  and  Dial  in  Fleetstreet  who was yesterday poison'd by Mr  Pope  after having liv'd many Years  an Instance of the mild Temper of the  British  Nation  Every Body knows that the said Mr  Edmund Curll  on  Monday  the th Instant publish'd a Satyrical Piece entituled  Court Poems  in the Preface whereof they were attributed to a Lady of Quality Mr  Pope  or Mr  Gay  by which indiscreet Method though he had escap'd one Revenge there were still two behind in reserve  Now on the  Wednesday  ensuing between the Hours of Ten and Eleven Mr  Lintott  a neighb'ring Bookseller desired a Conference with Mr  Curll  about settling a  TitlePage  inviting him at the same Time to take a Whet together Mr  Pope  who is not the only Instance how Persons of bright Parts may be carry'd away by the Instigation of the Devil found Means to convey himself into the same Room under Pretence of Business with Mr  Lintott  who it seems is the Printer of his  Homer  This Gentleman with a seeming Coolness reprimanded Mr  Curll  for wrongfully ascribing to him the aforesaid Poems He excused himself by declaring that one of his Authors Mr  Oldmixon  by Name gave the Copies to the Press and wrote the  Preface  Upon this Mr  Pope  being to all appearance reconcil'd very civily drank a Glass of Sack to Mr  Curll  which he as civilly pledged and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Taste differed not from common Sack yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer felt soon after that some poisonous Drug had been secretly infused therein  About eleven a Clock he went home where his Wife observing his Colour chang'd said  Are you not Sick my Dear  He reply'd  Bloody Sick  and incontinently fell a vomiting and straining in an uncommon and unnatural Manner the Contents of his vomiting being as green as Grass His Wife had been just reading a Book of her Husband's printing concerning  Jane Wenham  the famous Witch of  Hertford  and her Mind misgave her that he was  bewitch'd  but he soon let her know that he suspected Poison and recounted to her between the Intervals of his Yawnings and Reachings every Circumstance of his Interview with Mr  Pope  Mr  Lintott  in the mean time coming in was extreamly affrighted at the sudden Alteration he observ'd in Him  Brother  Curll says he  I fear you have got the Vomiting Distemper which I have heard kills in half an Hour This comes from your not following my Advice to drink old Hock in a Morning as I do and abstain from Sack  Mr  Curll  reply'd in a moving Tone  Your Author's Sack I fear has done my Business Z  ds  says Mr  Lintott my AuthorWhy did not you drink old Hock  Notwithstanding which rough Remonstrance he did in the most friendly Manner press him to take warm Water but Mr  Curll  did with great Obstinacy refuse it which made Mr  Lintott  Infer that he chose to die as thinking to recover greater Damages  All this Time the Symptoms encreas'd violently with accute Pains in the lower Belly  Brother  Lintott says he  I perceive my last Hour  approaching do me the friendly Office to call my Partner Mr  Pemberton  that we may settle our Worldly Affairs  Mr  Lintott  like a kind Neighbour was hastening out of the Room while Mr  Curll  rav'd aloud in this manner  If I survive this I will be reveng'd on  Tonson  it was he first detected me as the Printer of these Poems and I will reprint these very Poems in his Name  His Wife admonish'd him not to think of Revenge but to take care of his Stock and his Soul And in the same Instant Mr  Lintott  whose Goodness can never be enough applauded return'd with Mr  Pemberton  After some Tears jointly shed by these humane Booksellers Mr  Curll  being as he said in his perfect Senses though in great bodily Pain immediately proceeded to make a verbal Will Mrs  Curll  having first put on his NightCap in the following Ma nner  GEntlemen in the first Place I do sincerely pray Forgiveness for those indirect Methods I have pursued in inventing new Titles to old Books putting Authors Names to things they never saw publishing private Quarrels for publick Entertainment all which I hope will be pardoned as being done to get an honest livelihood  I do also heartily beg Pardon of all Persons of Honour Lords Spiritual and Temporal Gentry Burgesses and Commonalty to whose Abuse I have any or every way contributed by my Publications particularly I hope it will be consider'd  that if I have vilify'd his Grace the Duke of  Marlborough  I have likewise aspers'd the late Duke of  Ormond  if I have abused the honourable Mr  Walpole  I have also libell'd the Lord  Bolingbroke  so that I have preserv'd that  Equality  and  Impartiality  which becomes an  honest Man  in Times of Faction and Division  I call my Conscience to witness that many of these Things which may seem malicious were done out of  Charity  I having made it wholly my business to print for poor disconsolate Authors whom all other Booksellers refuse Only God bless Sir  Richard Blackmore  you know he takes no  Copymoney  The second Collection of Poems which I groundlesly call'd Mr  Prior  's will sell for Nothing and hath not yet paid the Charge of the Advertisements which I was obliged to publish  against him  Therefore you may as well suppress the Edition and beg that Gentleman's pardon in the name of a dying Christian  The  French Cato  with the Criticism showing how superior it is to Mr  Addison  's which I wickedly ascribed to Madam  Dacier  may be suppress'd at a reasonable Rate being damnably translated  I protest I have no Animosity to Mr  Rowe  having printed part of  Callipaedia  and an incorrect Edition of his Poems without his Leave in Quarto Mr  Gildon  's  Rehearsal  or  Bays the Younger  did more harm to me than to Mr  Rowe  though upon the Faith of an honest  Man I paid him double for abusing both him and Mr  Pope  Heaven pardon me for publishing the  Trials of Sodomy  in an  Elzevir  Letter but I humbly hope my printing Sir  Richard Blackmore  's  Essays  will attone for them I beg that you will take what remains of these last which is near the whole Impression Presents excepted and let my poor Widow have in exchange the sole Propriety of the Copy of Madam  Mascranny    Here Mr  Pemberton  interrupted and would by no means consent to this Article about which some Dispute might have arisen unbecoming a dying Person if Mr  Lintott  had not interposed and Mr  Curll  vomited    What this poor unfortunate Man spoke afterwards was so indistinct and in such broken Accents being perpetually interrupted by Vomitings that the Reader is intreated to excuse the Confusion and Imperfection of this Account  Dear Mr  Pemberton  I beg you to beware of the Indictment at  Hicks  's  Hall  for publishing  Rochester  's bawdy Poems that Copy will otherwise be my best Legacy to my dear Wife and helpless Child  The Case of Impotence  was my best Support all the last long Vacation    In this last Paragraph Mr  Curll  's Voice grew more free for his Vomitings abated upon his Dejections and he spoke what follows from his Closestool    For the Copies of Noblemen's and Bishop's  Last Wills and Testaments  I solemnly declare I printed them not with any Purpose of Defamation but meerly as I thought those Copies lawfully purchased from  Doctors Commons  at  One Shilling  a piece Our Trade in Wills turning to small Account we may divide them blindfold  For Mr  Manwaring  's  Life  I ask Mrs  Oldfield  's Pardon Neither  His  nor my Lord  Halifax  's Lives though they were of service to their Country were of any to me But I was resolved since I could not print their Works while they liv'd to print their Lives after they were dead  While he was speaking these Words Mr  Oldmixon  enter'd  Ah Mr  Oldmixon said poor Mr  Curll    to what a Condition have your Works reduced me I die a Martyr to that unlucky Preface However in these my last Moments I will be just to all Men you shall have your third Share of the  Court Poems  as was stipulated When I am dead where will you find  another Bookseller  Your  Protestant Packet  might have supported you had you writ a little less scurrilously there is a Mean in all things  Here Mr  Lintott  interrupted Why not find  another Bookseller Brother Curll  and then took Mr  Oldmixon  aside and whisper'd him  Sir As soon as  Curll  is dead I shall be glad to talk with you over a Pint at the  Devil  Mr  Curll  now turning to Mr  Pemberton  told him he had several  Taking TitlePages  that only wanted Treatises to be wrote to them and earnestly desired that when they were writ his Heirs might have some Share of the Profit of them  After he had said this he fell into horrible Gripings upon which Mr  Lintott  advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer He desir'd his Wife to step into the Shop for a  Common Prayer Book  and read it by the Help of a Candle without Hesitation He clos'd the Book fetch'd a Groan and recommended to Mrs  Curll  to give Forty Shillings to the Poor of the Parish of St  Dunstan  's and a  Week  's  Wages  advance to each of his GentlemenAuthors with some small Gratuity in particular to Mrs  Centlivre  The poor Man continued for some Hours with all his disconsolate Family about him in Tears expecting his final Dissolution when of a sudden he was surprizingly relieved by a plentiful foetid Stool which obliged them all to retire out of the Room Notwithstanding it is judged by Sir  Richard Blackmore  that the Poison is still latent in his Body and will infallibly destroy him by slow Degrees in less than a Month It is to be hoped the other Enemies of this wretched Stationer will not further pursue their Revenge or shorten this small Period of his miserable Life  A FURTHER ACCOUNT Of the most Deplorable Condition OF Mr  EDMUND CURLL  Bookseller  THE Publick is already acquainted with the Manner of Mr  Curll  's Impoisonment by a faithful tho' unpolite Historian of  Grubstreet  I am but the Continuer of his History yet I hope a due Distinction will be made between an undignify'd Scribler of a Sheet and half and the Author of a Threepenny stitch'd Book like my self  Blackmore  's  Essays  Vol  Wit  saith Sir  Richard Blackmore    proceeds from a Concurrence of regular and exalted Ferments and an Affluence of Animal Spirits rectify'd and refin'd to a Degree of Purity  On the contrary when the igneous Particles rise with the vital Liquor they produce an abstraction  of the rational Part of the Soul which we commonly call  Madness  The Verity of this Hypothesis is justify'd by the Symptoms with which the unfortunate Mr  Edmund Curll  Bookseller hath been afficted ever since his swallowing the Poison at the  Swan  Tavern in  Fleetstreet  For tho' the  Neck  of his  Retort  which carries up the Animal Spirits to the Head is of an extraordinary length yet the said Animal Spirits rise muddy being contaminated with the inflammable Particles of this uncommon Poison  The Symptoms of his Departure from his usual Temper of Mind were at first only  speaking civilly to his Customers singeing a Pig with a new purchased Libel  and  refusing TwoandNinePence for Sir  Richard Blackmore  's Essays  As the poor Man's Frenzy encreas'd he began to  void his Excrements in his Bed read  Rochester  's bawdy Poems to his Wife  gave  Oldmixon  a  slap  on the  Chops  and wou'd have kiss'd Mr  Pemberton  's A  by Violence  But at last he came to such a pass that he wou'd  dine upon nothing but CopperPlates  took a  Clyster for a whipt Syllabub  and made Mr  Lintott  eat a  Suppository  for a  Raddish  with  Bread  and  Butter  We leave it to every tender Wife to imagine how sorely all this afflicted poor Mrs  Curll  At first she privately put a  Bill  into several Churches desiring Prayers of the Congregation for a  wretched Stationer  distemper'd in Mind But when she was sadly convinc'd that his Misfortune  was publick to all the World she writ the following Letter to her good Neighbour Mr  Lintott  A true Copy of Mrs  Curll  's Letter to Mr  Lintott  Worthy Mr  Lintott  YOU and all the Neighbours know too well the Frenzy with which my poor Man is visited I never perceived he was out of himself till that melancholy Day that he thought he was poison'd in a Glass of Sack upon this he ran a Vomiting all over the House nay in the newwash'd Diningroom Alas this is the greatest Adversity that ever befel my poor Man since he lost  one Testicle  at School by the bite of a black Boar Good Lord if he should die where should I dispose of the  Stock  unless Mr  Pemberton  or you would help a distressed Widow for God knows he never publshed any Books that lasted above a Week so that if we wanted  daily Books  we wanted  daily Bread  I can write no more for I hear the Rap of Mr  Curll  's  Ivoryheaded Cane  upon the CounterPray recommend me to your  PastryCook  who furnishes you yearly with Tarts in exchange for your Papers for Mr  Curll  has disoblig'd ours since his Fits came upon himbefore that we generally liv'd upon bak'd MeatsHe is coming in and I have but just time to put his  Son  out of the way for  fear of Mischief So wishing you a merry  Easter  I remain your  Most humble Servant C Curll  P S As to the Report of my poor Husband's stealing a  Calf  it is really groundless for he always binds in  Sheep  But return we to Mr  Curll  who all  Wednesday  continued outragiously mad On  Thursday  he had a  lucid Interval  that enabled him to send a general Summons to all  his Authors  There was but one Porter who cou'd perform this Office to whom he gave the following Bill of Directions where to find 'em This Bill together with Mrs  Curll  's Original Letter lie at Mr  Lintott  's Shop to be perus'd by the Curious  Instructions to a Porter how to find Mr  Curll  's Authors  AT a Tallowchandlers in  Petty France  half way under the blind Arch Ask for the  Historian

appear'd at the Hour appointed in Mr  Curll  's Dining Room two excepted one of whom was the Gentleman in the Cockloft his Landlady being out of the way and the  Gradus ad Parnassum  taken down the other happened to be too closely watch'd by the Bailiffs  They no sooner enter'd the Room but all of them shew'd in their Behaviour some  Suspicion  of each other some turning away their Heads with an Air of Contempt others squinting with a Leer that shew'd at once  Fear  and  Indignation  each with a haggard abstracted Mien the lively Picture of  Scorn Solitude  and  short Commons  So when a Keeper feeds his hungry Charge of Vultures Panthers and of  Lybian  Leopards each eyes his Fellow with a siery Glare High hung the bloody Liver tempts their Maw Or as a Housewife stands before her Pales surrounded by her Geese they fight they hiss they gaggle beat their Wings and Down is scatter'd as the Winter's  Snow for poor Grain of Oat or Tare or Barley Such Looks shot through the Room transverse oblique direct such was the stir and din 'till  Curll  thus spoke but without rising from his Closestool  '  Whores  and  Authors  must be paid beforehand to put them in good Humour therefore here is half a Crown a piece for you to drink your own Healths and Confusion to Mr  Addison  and all other successful Writers'  'Ah Gentlemen what have I not done what have I not suffer'd

Lintott  's could mean nothing else but starving you by poisoning me It remains for us to consult the best and speediest Methods of Revenge'  He had scarce done speaking but the  Historian  propos'd a History of his Life The  Exeter  ExchangeGentleman was for penning Articles of his Faith Some pretty smart  Pindarick  says the RedStocking Poet would effectually do his Business But the  Indexmaker  said there was nothing like an  Index  to his  Homer  After several Debates they came to the following Resolutions  Resolv'd  That every Member of this Society according to his several Abilities shall contribute some way or other to the Defamation of Mr  Pope  Resolv'd  That towards the Libelling of the said  Pope  there be a Sum employ'd not exceeding Six Pounds Sixteen shillings and Nine Pence not including Advertisements  Resolv'd  That he has on purpose in several Passages perverted the true ancient  Heathen  Sense of  Homer  for the more effectual Propagation of the  Popish  Religion  Resolv'd  That the Printing of  Homer  's  Battles  at this Juncture has been the Occasion of all the Disturbances of this Kingdom  Ordered  That Mr  Barnivelt  be invited to be a Member of this Society in order to make further Discoveries  Resolv'd  That a number of effective  Errata  's be raised out of  Pope  's  Homer  not exceeding and that every Gentleman who shall send in one Error for his Encouragement shall have the whole Works of this Society  gratis  Resolv'd  That a Sum not exceeding Ten Shillings and Six pence be distributed among the Members of this Society for  Coffee  and  Tobacco  in order to enable them the more effectually to defame him in  CoffeeHouses  Resolv'd  That towards the further lessening the Character of the said  Pope  some Persons be deputed to abuse him at Ladies  TeaTables  and that in consideration our Authors are not  well dress'd  enough Mr  C  y  and Mr  Ke  l  be deputed for that Service  Resolv'd  That a  Ballad  be made against Mr  Pope  and that Mr  Oldmixon  Mr  Gildon  and Mrs  Centlivre  do prepare and bring in the same  Resolv'd  That above all some effectual Ways and Means be found to encrease the Joint Stock of the Reputation of this Society which at present is exceeding low and to give their Works the greater Currency whether by raising the Denomination of the said Works by counterfeit Title Pages or mixing a greater Quantity of the fine Metal of other Authors with the Alloy of this Society  Resolv'd  That no Member of this Society for the future mix  Stout  in his  Ale  in a Morning and that Mr  B  remove from the  Hercules  and  Still  Resolv'd  That all our Members except the  Cook  's Wife be provided with a sufficient Quantity of the  vivifying Drops  or  Byfield  's  Sal Volatile  Resolv'd  That Sir  R  B  be appointed to endue this Society with a large Quantity of  regular and exalted Ferments  in order to  enliven  their  cold Sentiments  being his true Receipt to make Wits  These Resolutions being taken the Assembly was ready to break up but they took so near apart in Mr  Curll  's Afflictions that none of them could leave him without giving him some Advice to reinstate him in his Health  Mr  Gildon  was of opinion That in order to drive a  Pope  out of his  Belly  he should get the Mummy of some deceas'd  Moderator  of the  General Assembly  in  Scotland  to be taken inwardly as an effectual Antidote against  Antichrist  but Mr  Oldmixon  did conceive that the  Liver  of the Person who administred the Poison boil'd in Broth would be a more certain Cure  While the Company were expecting the Thanks of Mr  Curll  for these demonstrations of their Zeal a whole pile of Sir  Richard  's  Essays  on a sudden fell on his Head the Shock of which in an Instant brought back his Delirium He immediately rose up overturn'd the Closestool and besht the  Essays  which may  probably occasion a  second Edition  then without putting up his Breeches in a most furious Tone he thus broke out to his Books which his distemper'd Imagination represented to him as alive coming down from their Shelves flutterring their Leaves and flapping their Covers at him  Now  Gd damn all Folio's Quarto's Octavo's  and  Duodecimo's  ungrateful Varlets that you are who have so long taken up my House without paying for your LodgingAre you not the beggarly Brood of fumbling  Journeymen  born in  Garrets  among  Lice  and  Cobwebs  nurs'd up on  Grey Peas Bullocks Liver  and  Porters Ale  Was not the first Light you saw the  Farthing  candle I paid for Did you not come before your Time into  dirty Sheets  of brown PaperAnd have not I cloath'd you in double  Royal  lodg'd you handsomely on  decent Shelves  lac'd your  Backs  with  Gold  equipt you with splendid  Titles  and sent you into the World with the Names of  Persons of Quality  Must I be  always  plagu'd with you Why flutter ye your Leaves and flap your Covers at me  Damn ye all  ye  Wolves  in  Sheeps Cloathing Rags ye were and to Rags ye shall return  Why hold you forth your  Texts  to me ye paltry  Sermons  Why cry yeat every Word to me ye  bawdy Poems  To my Shop at  Tunbridge  ye shall go by G  and thence be drawn like the rest of your Predecessors bit by bit to the  PassageHouse  For in this present Emotion of my Bowels how  do I compassionate those who have great need and nothing to wipe their Breech with  Having said this and at the same Time recollecting that his own was yet unwiped he abated of his Fury and with great Gravity apply'd to that Function the unfinish'd Sheets of the Conduct of the Earl of  N  m  A Strange but True RELATION HOW  EDMUND CURLL  of  Fleetstreet  Stationer Out of an extraordinary Desire of Lucre went into  ChangeAlley  and was converted from the Christian Religion by certain Eminent  Jews  And how he was circumcis'd and initiated into their Mysteries  AVARICE as Sir  Richard  in the Third Page of his Essays hath elegantly observ'd  is an inordinate Impulse of the Soul towards the amassing or heaping together a Superfluity of Wealth without the least Regard of applying it to its proper Uses  And how the Mind of Man is possessed with this Vice may be seen every Day both in the City and Suburbs thereof It has been always esteemed by  Plato Puffendorf  and  Socrates  as the darling Vice of old Age But now our young Men are turn'd Usurers and Stockjobbers and instead of lusting after the real Wives and Daughters of our rich Citizens they covet nothing but their Money and Estates Strange Change of Vice when the Concupiscence of Youth is converted into the Covetousness of Age and those Appetites are now become VENAL which should be VENEREAL  In the first Place let us shew you how many of the ancient Worthies and Heroes of Antiquity have been undone and ruin'd by this Deadly Sin of Avarice  I shall take the Liberty to begin with  Brutus  that noble  Roman  Does not  Aetian  inform us that he received Fifty Broad Pieces for the Assassination of that renowned Emperor  Julius Caesar  who fell a Sacrifice to the  Jews  as Sir  Edmund Bury Godfrey  did to the  Papists  Did not  Themistocles  let in the  Goths  and  Vandals  into  Carthage  for a Sum of Money where they barbarously put out the other Eye of the famous  Hannibal  As  Herodotus  hath it in his ninth Book upon the  Roman  Medals  Even the great  Cato  as the late Mr  Addison  hath very well observ'd though otherwise a Gentleman of good Sense was not unsully'd by this pecuniary Contagion For he sold  Athens  to  Artaxerxes Longimanus  for a hundred  RixDollars  which in our Money will amount to two  Talents  and thirty  Sestertii  according to Mr  Demoiver  's Calculation  See  Hesiod  in his    th Chapter of  Feasts  and  Festivals  Actuated by the same Diabolical Spirit of Gain  Scylla  the  Roman  Consul shot  Alcibiades  the Senator with a Pistol and robb'd him of several  Bank Bills  and  Chequer Notes  to an immense Value for which he came to an untimely End and was deny'd  Christian  Burial Hence comes the Proverb  incidat in Scyllam  To come near to our own Times and give you one modern Instance tho' well known and often quoted by Historians  viz Echard Dionysius Halicarnassaeus Virgil Horace  and others 'Tis that I mean of the famous  Godfrey  of  Bulloigne  one of the great Heroes of the Holy War who robb'd  Cleopatra  Queen of  Egypt  of a Diamond Necklace EarRings and a  Tompion  's Gold Watch which was given her by  Mark Antony  all these things were found in  Godfrey  's Breeches Pocket when he was kill'd at the Seige of  Damascus  Who then can wonder after so many great and illustrious Examples that Mr  Edmund Curll  the Stationer should renounce the  Christian Religion  for the  Mammon  of Unrighteousness and barter his precious Faith for the filthy Prospect of Lucre in the present Fluctuation of  Stocks  It having been observed to Mr  Curll  by some of his ingenious Authors who I fear are not overcharg'd with any Religion what immense Sums the  Jews  had got by  Bubbles  c he immediately turned his Mind from the Business in which he was educated but thriv'd little and resolv'd to quit his Shop for  Change Alley  Whereupon falling into Company  with the  Jews  at their Club at the Sign of the  Cross  in  Cornhill  they began to tamper with him upon the most important Points of the  Christian Faith  which he for some time zealously and  like a good Christian obstinately  defended They promised him  Paradise  and many other Advantages  hereafter  but he artfully insinuated that he was more inclinable to listen to  present  Gain They took the Hint and promis'd him that immediately upon his Conversion to their Persuasion he should become as rich as a  Jew  They made use likewise of several other Arguments to wit  That the wisest Man that ever was and inasmuch the richest beyond all peradventure was a  Jew  videlicet  Solomon  That  David  the Man after God's own Heart was a  Jew  also And most of the Children of  Israel  are suspected for holding the same Doctrine  This Mr  Curll  at first strenuously deny'd for indeed he thought them  Roman Catholicks  and so far was he from giving way to their Temptations that to convince them of his  Christianity  he call'd for a  Pork Grisking  They now promis'd if he would poison his Wife and give up his  Grisking  that he should marry the rich  Ben Meymon  's only Daughter This made some Impression on him  They then talk'd to him in the  Hebrew  Tongue which he not understanding it was observ'd had very great Weight with him  They now perceiving that his  Godliness  was only  Gain  desisted from all other Arguments and attack'd him on his weak side namely that of  Avarice  Upon which  John Mendez  offer'd him an Eighth of an advantagious Bargain for the  Apostles Creed  which he readily and wickedly renounced  He then sold the  Nine and thirty Articles  for a  Bull  but insisted hard upon  BlackPuddings  being a great Lover thereof  Joshua Parrara  engag'd to let him share with him in his  Bottomrye  upon this he was persuaded out of his  Christian Name  but he still adher'd to  BlackPuddings  Sir  Gideon Lopez  tempted him with  Forty Pound  Subscription in  Ram  's  Bubble  for which he was content to give up the  Four Evangelists  and he was now compleated a perfect  Jew  all but  BlackPudding  and  Circumcision  for both of which he would have been glad to have had a Dispensation  But on the th of  March  Mr  Curll  unknown to his Wife came to the Tavern asoresaid At his Entrance into the Room he perceived a meagre Man with a sallow Countenance a black forky Beard and long Vestment In his Right Hand he held a large Pair of Sheers and in his Left a red hot SearingIron At Sight of this Mr  Curll  's Heart trembled within him and feign would he retire but he was prevented by six Jews who laid Hands upon him and unbuttoning his Breeches  threw him upon the Table a pale pitiful Spectacle  He now intreated them in the most moving Tone of Voice to dispense with that  unmanly  Ceremonial which if they would consent to he faithfully promis'd that he would eat a Quarter of  Paschal Lamb  with them the next  Sunday  following  All these Protestations availed him nothing for they threatned him that all Contracts and Bargains should be void unless he would submit to bear all the  outward  and  visible  Signs of  Judaism  Our Apostate hearing this stretched himself upon his Back spread his Legs and waited for the Operation but when he saw the HighPriest take up the  Cleft Stick  he roared most unmercifully and swore several Christian Oaths for which the  Jews  rebuked him  The Savour of the  Effluvia  that issued from him convinced the Old  Levite  and all his Assistants that he needed no present  Purgation  wherefore without farther  anointing  him he proceeded in his Office when by an unfortunate Jerk upward of the impatient Victim he lost five times as much as ever Jew did before  They finding that he was too much circumcis'd which by the  Levitical Law  is worse than not being circumcis'd at all refused to stand to any of their Contracts Wherefore they cast him forth from their Synagogue and he now remains a most piteous woful and miserable Sight at the Sign of the  Old Testament  and  Dial  in  Fleetstreet  his Wife poor Woman  is at this Hour lamenting over him wringing her hands and tearing her Hair for the barbarous Jews still keep and expose at  Jonathan  's and  Garraway  's the Memorial of her Loss and her Husband's Indignity  PRAYER To save the Stamp  KEEP us we beseech thee from the Hands of such barbarous and cruel  Jews  who albeit they abhor the Blood of  BlackPuddings  yet thirst they vehemently after the Blood of  White ones  And that we may avoid such like Calamities may all good and welldisposed Christians be warn'd by this unhappy Wretch's woful Example to abominate the heinous Sin of  Avarice  which sooner or later will draw them into the cruel Clutches of  Satan Papists Jews  and  Stockjobbers  Amen  GOD's Revenge AGAINST PUNNING  Shewing the miserable Fates of Persons addicted to this Crying Sin in Court and Town  MAnifold have been the Judgments which Heav'n from Time to Time for the Chastisement of a Sinful People has inflicted on whole Nations For when the Degeneracy becomes Common 'tis but Just the Punishment should be General Of this kind in our own unfortunate Country was that destructive Pestilence whose Mortality was so fatal as to sweep away if Sir  William Petty  may be believ'd Five Millions of Christian Souls besides Women and Jews  Such also was that dreadful Conflagration ensuing in this famous metropolis of  London  which consumed according to the Computation of Sir  Samuel Morland  Houses not to mention Churches and Stables  Scarce had this Unhappy Nation recover'd these Funest Disasters when the Abomination of Playhouses rose up in this Land From hence hath an Inundation of Obscenity flow'd from the Court and overspread the Kingdom Even Infants disfigured the Walls of holy Temples with exorbitant Representations of the Members of Generation nay no sooner had they learnt to Spell but they had Wickedness enough to Write the Names thereof in large Capitals an Enormity observ'd by Travellers to be found in no Country but  England  But when Whoring and Popery were driven hence by the Happy  Revolution  still the Nation so greatly offended that  Socinianism Arianism  and  Whistonism  triumph'd in our Streets and were in a manner become Universal  And yet still after all these Visitations it has pleased Heaven to visit us with a Contagion more Epidemical and of consequence more Fatal This was foretold to us First by that unparallel'd Eclipse in Secondly By the dreadful Coruscation in the Air this present Year And Thirdly By the Nine Comets seen at once over  SohoSquare  by Mrs  Katherine Wadlington  and Others a Contagion that first crept in amongst the First Quality descended to their Footman and infused it self into their Ladies I mean the woful Practice of PUNNING This does occasion the Corruption of our Language and therein of the Word of God translated into our Language which certainly every sober Christian must Tremble at  Now such is the Enormity of this Abomination that our very Nobles not only commit  Punning  over Tea and in Taverns but even on the  Lord  's  Day  and in the King's Chappel Therefore to deter Men from this evil Practice I shall give some True and Dreadful Examples of God's Revenge against  Punsters  The Right Honourable  but it is not safe to insert the Name of an eminent Nobleman in this Paper yet I will venture to say that such a one has been  seen  which is all we can say considering the largeness of his Sleeves This young Nobleman was not only a flagitious  Punster  himself but was accessary to the Punning of others by Consent by Provocation by Connivance and by Defence of the Evil committed for which the Lord mercifully spared his Neck but as a Mark of Reprobation  wryed his Nose  Another Nobleman of great Hopes no less guilty of the same Crime was made the Punisher of himself with his own Hand in the Loss of Pounds at Box and Dice whereby this unfortunate young Gentleman incurr'd the heavy Displeasure of his aged Grandmother  A Third of no less illustrious Extraction for the same Vice was permitted to fall into the Arms of a  Dalilah  who may one day cut off his curious Hair and deliver him up to the  Philistines  Colonel  F    an ancient Gentleman of grave Deportment gave into this Sin so early in his Youth that whenever his Tongue endeavours  to speak Common Sense he Hesitates so as not to be understood  Thomas Pickle  Gentleman for the same Crime banish'd to  Minorca  Muley Hamet  from a healthy and hopeful Officer in the Army turn'd a miserable Invalid at  Tilbury  Fort  Eustace  Esq  for the Murder of much of the King's  English  in  Ireland  is quite depriv'd of his Reason and now remains a lively Instance of Emptiness and Vivacity  Poor  Daniel Button  for the same Offence depriv'd of his Wits  One  Samuel  an  Irishman  for his forward Attempt to  Pun  was stunted in his Stature and hath been visited all his Life after with Bulls and Blunders  George Simmons  Shoemaker at  Turnstile  in  Holborn  was so given to this Custom and did it with so much Success that his Neighbours gave out he was a Wit Which Report coming among his Creditors no body would trust him so that he is now a Bankrupt and his Family in a miserable Condition  Divers eminent Clergymen of the University of  Cambridge  for having propagated this Vice became great Drunkards and Tories  From which Calamities the Lord in his Mercy defend us all  c c  THE WONDERFUL WONDER of WONDERS  THERE is a certain Person lately arrived at this City whom it is very proper the World should be informed of His Character may perhaps be thought very Inconsistent Improbable and Unnatural however I intend to draw it with the utmost Regard to Truth This I am the better qualified to do because he is a sort of  Dependant  upon our Family and  almost  of the same  Age  tho' I cannot directly say I have ever  secn  him He is a Native of this Country and hath lived long among us but what appears wonderful and hardly credible was never seen  before  by any Mortal  It is true indeed he always chuses the  lowest  Place in Company and contrives it so to keep  out of Sight  It is reported however that in his younger Days he was frequently  exposed  to  View  but always against his Will and was sure to  smart  for it  As to his Family he came into the World a Younger Brother being of  six  Children the  fourth  in order of    Birth of which the eldest is now  Head  of the House the second and third carry  Arms  but the two Youngest are only  Footmen  Some indeed add that he hath likewise a TwinBrother who lives  overagainst  him and keeps a      VictuallingHouse  He has the Reputation to be a  close griping squeezing  Fellow and that when his Bags are  full  he is often  Needy  yet when the Fit takes him as fast as he gets he  lets it fly  When in  Office  no one  dischargeth  himself or  does his Business  better He hath sometimes  strained hard  for an Honest Livelihood and never got a  Bit  till every Body else had  done  One Practice appears very blameable in him that every Morning he privately frequents  unclean Houses  where any modest Person would blush to be seen And altho' this be generally known yet the World as Censorious as it is is so kind to overlook this Infirmity in him To deal Impartially it must be granted that he is too great a Lover of himself and very often consults his own  Ease  at the Expence of his best Friends But this is one of his  blindSides  and the best of Men I fear are not without  them  He hath been constituted by the  higher  Powers in the Station of  ReceiverGeneral  in which Employment some have censured him for playing  fast  and  loose  He is likewise  Overseer  of the  Golden Mines  which he daily inspects when his Health will permit him  He was long bred under a      Master of Arts  who instilled good  Principles  in him but these  were soon  Corrupted  I know not whether this deserves mention that he is so very Capricious as to take it for an equal Affront to talk either of  kissing  or  kicking  him which hath occasion'd a Thousand Quarrels However no body was ever so great a Sufferer for Faults which he neither was nor possibly could be guilty of  In his  Religion  he has thus much of the Quaker that he stands  always covered  even in the Presence of the King in most other Points a perfect      Idolater  altho' he endeavours to  conceal  it for he is known to offer daily Sacrifices to certain  Subterraneous Nymphs  whom he worships in an  humble Posture prone on his Face  and  stript stark Naked  and so leaves his  Offerings behind him  which the      Priests  of those Goddesses are careful enough to remove upon certain Seasons with the utmost Privacy at  Midnight  and from thence maintain'd themselves and Families In all  urgent Necessities  and  Pressures  he applies himself to these Deities and sometimes even in the  Streets  and  Highways  from an  Opinion  that those Powers have an Influence in all Places altho' their peculiar Residence is in Caverns under Ground Upon these  Occasions  the fairest Ladies will not refuse to  lend  their  Hands  to assist him For altho' they are asham'd to have him  seen  in their Company or even so much as to hear him  Named  yet it is well known that he is one of their  constant Followers  In  Politicks  he always submits to what is  uppermost  but he peruses Pamphlets  on both  Sides  with great Impartiality tho' seldom till  every Body else have done with them  His  Learning  is of a mixed kind and he may properly be called a  Helluo librorum  or another  Jacobus de Voragine  tho' his Studies are chiefly confined to  Schoolmen Commentators  and  German Divines  together with  Modern Poetry  and  Criticks  And he is an  Atomick  Philosopher strongly maintaining a  Void  in  Nature  which he seems to have fairly proved by many  Experiments  I shall now proceed to describe some peculiar Qualities which in several Instances seem to distinguish this Person from the common Race of other Mortals  His  Grandfather  was a Member of the  Rump  Parliament as the  Grandson  is of the  Present  where he often  rises  sometimes  grumbles  but never  speaks  However he lets nothing pass  willingly  but what is  well digested  His Courage is indisputable for he will take the boldest Man alive  by the Nose  He is generally the  first a Bed  in the Family and the  last up  which is to be lamented because when he happens to  rise before  the rest it hath been thought to forebode some  good Fortune to his Superiors  As Wisdom is acquired by Age so by every new      Wrinkle  in his  Face  he is reported to gain some  new Knowledge  In him we may observe the true Effects and Consequences of  Tyranny  in a State For as he is a great  Oppressor  of all  below  him so there is no Body more  oppressed  by those  above  him  Yet in this Time he hath been so highly in Favour that many  Illustrious Persons  have been entirely indebted to  him  for their  Preferments  He hath discovered from his own Experience the true  Point  wherein all human Actions Projects and Designs do chiefly  terminate  and how  mean  and  sordid  they are  at the Bottom  It behoves the Publick to keep him  quiet  for his  frequent Murmurs  are a certain Sign of  intestine  Tumults  No Philosopher ever lamented more the Luxury for which these Nations are so justly taxed it hath been known to cost him      Tears of Blood  For in his own Nature he is far from being  Profuse  tho' indeed he never stays a Night at a Gentleman's House without  leaving something behind him  He receives with g eat Submission whatever his Patrons think fit to give him and when they lay  heavy Burthens  upon him which is frequently enough he gets rid of them as soon as he can but not without  some Labour  and  much Grumbling  He is a perpetual  Hangeron  yet no Body knows how to be  without him  He patiently fuffers himself to be  kept under  but loves to be well used and in that Case will sacrifice his  Vitals  to give you  Ease  and he has hardly one Aquaintance for whom he hath not been  Bound  yet as far as we can find was never known to  lose  any thing by it  He is observ'd to be very      unquiet  in the Company of a  Frenchman  in  New Cloaths  or a young  Coquett  He is in short the Subject of much  Mirth  and  Raillery  which he seems to take well enough tho' it hath not been observ'd that ever any  good Thing  came from himself  There is so general an Opinion of his Justice that sometimes very  hard Cases  are left to his Decision And while he  sits  upon them he carries himself exactly  even between both sides  except where some  knotty Point  arises and then he is observed to  lean  a little to the  Right  or  Left  as the  Matter  inclines him but his Reasons for it are so manifest and convincing that every Man approves them  POSTSCRIPT  Gentle Reader  THO' I am not insensible how many Thousand Persons have been and still are with great Dexterity  handling  this Subject and no less aware of what infinite Rheams of Paper have been  laid out upon it  however in my Opinion no Man living has  touch'd  it with greater Nicety and more delicate Turns than our Author But because there is some intended Obscurity in this Relation and Curiosity inquisitive of  Secrets  may possibly not enter into the  Bottom  and  Depth  of the Subject 'twas thought not improper to take off the Veil and gain the Reader's Favour by inlarging his  Insight ARS enim non habet Inimicum  nisi ignorantem  'Tis well known that it has been the Policy of all Times to deliver down  Important  Subjects by Emblem and Riddle and not to suffer the Knowledge of Truth to be derived to us in plain and simple Terms which are generally as soon forgot as conceived For this Reason the  Heathen  Religion is mostly couched under  Mythology  For the like Reason this being a FUNDAMENTAL in its kind the Author has thought fit to wrap up his Treasure in  clean Linnen  which it is our Business to  lay open  and set in a due Light for I have observed upon any accidental Discovery the least  Glimpse  has given great Diversion to the eager Spectator as many Ladies could testify  were it proper  or  the Case would admit  The politest Companies have vouchsafed to smile at the  bare  Name and some People of Fashon have been so little scrupulous of  bringing it in Play  that it was the usual saying of a Knight and a Man of good Breeding  That whenever he rose his Ase rose with him  He alludes to the Manner of our Birth the  Head  and  Arms  appearing before the Posteriors and the two  Feet  which he calls the  Footmen

Offerings in the Night of which see more in the Story of  Bell  and the  Dragon    Wrinkle  This refers to a Proverb  You have one Wrinkle in your Ase more than you had before    Tears of Blood    Haemorrhoids  according to the Physicians are a frequeut Consequence of Intemperance    Unquiet  Their Tails being generally observed to be most restless  THE WONDER Of all the Wonders that ever the World wonder'd at  For all Persons of Quality and Others  NEWLY arriv'd at this City the famous Artist  John Emanuel Schoitz  who to the great Surprize and Satisfaction of all Spectators is ready to do the following Wonderful Performances the like before never seen in this Kingdom  He will heat a Bar of Iron red hot and thrust it into a barrel of Gunpowder before all the Company and yet it shall not take fire  He lets any Gentleman charge a Blunderbuss with the same Gunpowder and twelve Leaden Bullets which Blunderbuss the said Artist discharges full in the Face of the said Company without the least hurt the Bullets sticking in the Wall behind them  He takes any Gentleman's own Sword and runs it through the said Gentleman's Body so that the Point appears bloody at the back to all the Spectators then he takes out the Sword wipes it clean and returns it to the owner who receives no manner of hurt  He takes a Pot of Scalding Oyl and throws it by great Ladles full directly at the Ladies without spoiling their Cloaths or burning their Skins  He takes any Person of Quality's Child from two Years Old to six and lets the Child's own Father or Mother take a Pike in their Hands then the Artist takes the Child in his Arms and tosses it upon the Point of the Pike where it sticks to the great Satisfaction of all Spectators and is then taken off without so much as a hole in his Coat  He mounts upon a Scaffold just over the Spectators and from thence throws down a great Quantity of large Tiles and Stones which fall like so many Pillows without so much as discomposing either Perukes or Headdresses  He takes any Person of Quality up to the said Scaffold which Person pulls off his Shoes and leaps nine Foot directly down on a Board prepar'd on Purpose full of sharp Spikes six Inches long without hurting his Feet or Damaging his Stockings  He places the said Board on a Chair upon which a Lady sits down with another Lady in her Lap while the Spikes instead of entring into the under Lady's flesh will feel like a Velvet Cushion  He takes any Person of Quality's Footman tyes a Rope about his bare Neck and draws him up by Pullies to the Cieling and these keeps him hanging as long as his Master or the Company pleases the said Footman to the Wonder and Delight of all Beholders with a Pot of Ale in one Hand and a Pipe in the other and when he is let down there will not appear the least Mark of the Cord about his Neck  He bids a Lady's Maid put her finger into a Cup of clear Liquor like Water upon which her Face and both her Hands are immediately wither'd like an Old Woman of fourscore her Belly swells as if she were in a Week of her Time and her Legs are as thick as MillPosts but upon putting her finger into another Cup she becomes as Young and Handsome as she was before  He gives any Gentleman leave to drive forty Twelvepenny Nails up to the Head in a Porter's backside and then places the said Porter on a Loadstone Chair which draws out every Nail and the Porter feels no Pain  He likewise draws the Teeth of half a Dozen Gentlemen mixes and jumbles them in a Hat gives any Person leave to blindfold him and raturns each their own and fixes them as well as ever  With his Forefinger and Thumb he thrusts several Gentlemen's and Lady's Eyes out of their Heads without the least Pain at which time they see an unspeakable Number of beautiful Colours and after they are entertain'd to the  full he places them again in their proper Sockets without any Damage to the sight  He lets any Gentleman drink a Quart of hot melted Lead and by a Draught of prepared Liquor of which he takes part himself he makes the said Lead pass through the said Gentleman before all the Spectators without any Damage After which it is produced in a Cake to the Company  With many other Wonderful Performances of Art too tedious here to mention  The said Artist has perform'd before most Kings and Princes in  Europe  with great Applause  He Performs every Day except  Sundays  from Ten of the Clock to One in the Forenoon and from Four till Seven in the Evening at the New Inn in  Smithfield  The first Seat a  British  Crown the second a  British  HalfCrown and the lowest a  British  Shilling  N B  The best Hands in Town are to play at the said Show  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The MAYOR and ALDERMEN of the City of LONDON The Humble Petition Of the  Colliers Cooks CookMaids Blacksmiths Jackmakers Brasiers  and Others  SHEWETH  THAT whereas certain  Virtuosi  Disaffected to the Government and to the Trade and Prosperity of this Kingdom taking upon them the Name and Title of the CATOPTRICAL VICTUALLERS have presumed by Gathering Breaking Folding and Bundlingup the  SunBeams  by the help of certain  Glasses  to Make Produce and Kindle up several New  Focus  's or Fires within these His Majesty's Dominions and thereby to Boil Bake Stew Fry and Dress all sorts of Victuals and Provisions to Brew Distil Spirits Smelt Oar and in general to perform all the Offices of Culinary Fires and are endeavouring to procure  to themselves the Monopoly of this their said Invention We beg leave humbly to represent to your Honours  That such Grant or Patent will utterly Ruin and reduce to Beggery your Petitioners their Wives Children Servants and Trades on them depending there being nothing left to them after the said Invention but Warming of Cellars and Dressing of Suppers in the Wintertime That the abolishing so considerable a Branch of the Coasting Trade as that of the Colliers will destroy the  Navigation  of this Kingdom That whereas the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  talk of making use of the  Moon  by Night as of the  Sun  by Day they will utterly ruin the numerous Body of  TallowChandlers  and impair a very considerable branch of the  Revenue  which arises from the  Tax  upon Tallow and Candles  That the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  do profane the Emanations of that Glorious Luminary the  Sun  which is appointed to  Rule the Day  and not to  Roast Mutton  And we humbly conceive it will be found contrary to the known Laws of this Kingdom to Confine Forestall and Monopolize the Beams of the Sun And whereas the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  have undertaken by BurningGlasses made of Ice to Roast an Ox upon the  Thames  next Winter We conceive all such Practices to be an Encroachment upon the Rights and Privileges of the  Company  of  Watermen  That the Diversity of Exposition of the several Kitchens in this great City whereby  some receive the Rays of the Sun sooner and others later will occasion great Irregularity as to the  Time of Dining  of the several Inhabitants and consequently great Uncertainty and Confusion in the dispatch of Business And to those who by reason of their Northern Exposition will be still forced to be at the Expences of Culinary Fires it will reduce the Price of their Manufacture to such Inequality as is inconsistent with common Justice And the same Inconveniency will affect  Landlords  in the  Value  of their  Rents  That the Use of the said Glasses will oblige Cooks and Cookmaids to study Opticks and Astronomy in order to know the due Distances of the said  Focus  's or Fires and to adjust the Position of their Glasses to the several Altitudes of the Sun varying according to the Hours of the Day and the Seasons of the Year which Studies at these years will be highly Troublesome to the said Cooks and CookMaids not to say any thing of the utter Incapacity of some of them to go through with such difficult Arts or which is still a greater Inconvenience it will throw the whole Art of  Cookery  into the Hands of Astronomers and GlassGrinders Persons utterly unskill'd in other parts of that Profession to the great Detriment of the  Health  of His Majesty's good Subjects  That it is known by Experience That Meat Roasted with SunBeams is extreamly unwholesome witness several that have dy'd suddenly after eating the Provisions of the said  Catoptrical Victuallers  forasmuch as the SunBeams taken  inwardly render the Humours too Hot and Adust occasion great Sweatings and dry up the Rectual Moisture  That Sunbeams taken  inwardly  shed a Malignant Influence upon the  Brain  by their natural Tendency towards the  Moon  and produce Madness and Distraction at the time of the Full Moon That the constant use of so great Quantities of this  Inward Light  will occasion the Growth of  Quakerism  to the Danger of the  Church  and  Poetry  to the Danger of the State  That the Influences of the Constellations through which the Sun passes will with his Beams be convey'd into the  Blood  and when the Sun is amongst the Horned Signs may produce such a Spirit of  Unchastity  as is dangerous to the Honour of your Worships Families  That Mankind living much upon the Seeds and other Parts of Plants these being impregnated with the SunBeams may  vegetate  and  grow  in the Bowels a Thing of more dangerous Consequence to human Bodies than Breeding of Worms and this will fall heaviest upon the Poor who live upon Roots and the Weak and Sickly who live upon Barley and RiceGruel  c  for which we are ready to produce to your Honours the Opinions of Eminent Physicians That the Taste and Property of the Victuals is much alter'd to the worse by the said  Solar Cookery  the Fricasses being depriv'd of the  Haut Gout  they acquire by being dress'd over Charcoal  Lastly  Should it happen by an Eclipse of an extraordinary Length that this City should be depriv'd of the SunBeams for several Months how will His Majesty's Subjects subsist in the Interim when common Cookery with the Arts depending upon it is totally lost  In Consideration of these and many other Inconveniencies your Petitioners humbly pray That your Honours would either totally prohibit the Confining and Manufacturing the  SunBeams  for any of the useful Purposes of Life or in the ensuing Parliament procure a  Tax to be laid  upon them which may answer both the Duty and Price of  Coals  and which we humbly conceive cannot be less than Thirty Shillings  per  Yard Square reserving the sole Right and Privilege of the  Catoptrical Cookery  to the  Royal Society  and to the Commanders and Crew of the BombVessels under the Direction of Mr  Whiston  for finding out the Longitude who by Reason of the Remoteness of their Nations may be reduc'd to Streights for want of Firing  And we likewise beg that your Honours as to the forementioned Points would hear the Reverend Mr  Flamstead  who is the Legal Officer appointed by the Government to  look after the Heavenly Luminaries  whom we have constituted our Trusty and Learned Solicitor  REASONS Humbly Offer'd By the Company exercising the Trade and Mistery of UPHOLDERS against Part of the BILL  For the better Viewing Searching and Examining Drugs Medicines  c  BEING call'd upon by several Retailers and Dispensers of  Drugs  and  Medicines  about Town to use our Endeavours against the Bill now depending  for Viewing  c In regard of our common Interest and in Gratitude to the said Retailers and Dispensers of Medicines which we have always found to be very effectual we presume to lay the following Reasons before the Publick against the said Bill  That the Company of Upholders  are far from being averse to the giving of Drugs and Medicines in general  provided they may be of such Qualities as we require and administer'd by  such Persons in whom our Company justly repose the greatest Confidence And provided they tend to the Encouragement of Trade and the Consumption of the  Woollen Manufacture  of this Kingdom  We beg Leave to observe that  there hath been no Complaint from any of the Nobility Gentry and Citizens whom we have attended  Our Practice which consists chiefly in outward Applications having been always so effectual that none of our Patients have been oblig'd to undergo a second Operation Excepting one Gentlewoman who after her first Burial having burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of posthumous Children her second Funeral was by us perform'd without any farther Charges to the said Husband of the deceas'd And we humbly hope that one single Instance of this Kind a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of a Sexton in cutting off a Ring will not be imputed to any Want of Skill or Care in our Company  We humbly conceive that the  Power by this Bill lodged in the Censors of the College of Physicians  to restrain any of His Majesty's Subjects from dispensing and welldisposed Persons from taking what Medicines they please  is a manifest Encroachment on the Liberty and Property of the Subjects  As the Company exercising the Trade and Mistery of Upholders have an undisputed Right in and upon the  Bodies  of all and every the Subjects of the Kingdom we conceive the passing of this Bill though not absolutely depriving them of their said Right might keep them  out  of Possession  by unreasonable  Delays  to the great Detriment of our Company and their numerous Families  We hope it will be consider'd that there are Multitudes of necessitous Heirs and penurious Parents Persons in pinching Circumstances with numerous Families of Children Wives that have lived long many robust aged Women with great Jointures elder Brothers with bad Understandings single Heirs of great Estates whereby the Collateral Line are for ever excluded Reversionary Patents and Reversionary Promises of Preferments Leases upon Single Lives and Playdebts upon joint Lives and that the Persons so aggrieved have no Hope of being speedily relieved any other Way than by the dispensing of  Drugs  and  Medicines  in the Manner they  now are  Burying  alive  being judg'd repugnant to the known Laws of this Kingdom  That there are many of the Deceased who by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are carried about Town who would have been put into our Hands long before this Time by any other wellorder'd Government By want of a due  Police  in this Particular our Company have been great Sufferers  That  frequent Funerals  contribute to preserve the Genealogies of Families and the Honours conferred by the Crown which are no where so well illustrated as on this solemn Occasion to maintain  necessitous Clergy  to enable the  Clerks  to appear in decent Habits to officiate on  Sundays  to feed the great Retinue of  sober  and  melancholy Men  who appear at the said Funerals and who  must starve without constant and regular Employment Moreover we desire it may be remember'd that by the passing of this Bill the Nobility and Gentry will have their  old Coaches  lie upon their Hands which are now employed by our Company  And we further hope that frequent Funerals will not be discouraged as is by this Bill proposed it being the only Method left of  carrying  some People to  Church  We are afraid that by the Hardships of this Bill our Company will be reduced to leave their Business here and  practise at  York  and  Bristol  where the free Use of bad Medicines will be still allowed  It is therefore hoped that no specious Pretence whatsoever will be thought sufficient to introduce an Arbitrary and Unlimited Power for Peope to live  in Defiance of  Art  as long as they can by the Course of  Nature  to the Prejudice of our Company and the Decay of Trade  That as our Company are like to suffer in some measure by the Power given to Physicians to dissect the Bodies of Malefactors we humbly hope that the Manufacture of Cases for Skeletons will be reserved solely to the Coffinmakers  We likewise humbly presume that the Interests of the several Trades and Prosessions which depend upon ours may be regarded such as that of Hearses Coaches Coffins Epitaphs and Bellropes Stonecutters Feathermen and Bellringers and especially the Manusacturers of Crapes and the Makers  of Snuff  who use  great Quantities of old Coffins and who consider'd in the Consumption of their Drugs employ by far the greatest Number of Hands of any Manufacture of the Kingdom  Annus Mirabilis  OR The Wonderful Effects of the approaching Conjunction of the Planets  Jupiter Mars  and  Saturn  By MART SCRIBLERUS  Philomath  A WellWisher to the Mathematicks  In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas  Corpora  I SUPPOSE every Body is sufficiently appriz'd of and duly prepar'd for the famous Conjunction to be celebrated the th of this Instant  December  foretold by all the Sages of Antiquity under the Name of the  Annus Mirabilis  or the  Metamorphostical  Conjunction a Word which denotes the mutual Transformation of Sexes the Effect of that Configuration of the Celestial Bodies the human Males being to be turn'd into Females and the human Females into Males  The  Egyptians  have represented this great Transformation by several significant Hieroglyphicks particularly one very remarkable There are carv'd upon an Obelisk a  Barber  and a  Midwife  the Barber delivers his  Razor  to the Midwife and she her  Swadling Cloaths  to the Barber Accordingly  Thales Milesius  who like the rest of his Countrymen borrow'd his Learning from the  Egyptians  after having computed the Time of this famous Conjunction  Then  says he  shall Men and Women mutually exchange the Pangs of  Shaving  and  Childbearing  Anaximander  modestly describes this Metamorphosis in mathematical Terms  Then  says he  shall the negative Quantity of the Women be turn'd into positive their  into  ✚ i e their  Minus  into  Plus  Plato  not only speaks of this great Change but describes all the Preparations towards it  "Long before the bodily Transformation says he Nature shall begin the most difficult Part of her Work by changing the  Ideas  and  Inclinations  of the two Sexes Men shall turn effeminate and Women manly Wives shall domineer and Husbands obey Ladies shall  ride a Horseback  dress'd like  Cavaliers  Princes and Nobles appear in  Nightrails  and  Petticoats  Men shall  squeak  upon Theatres with  Female  Voices and Women  corrupt Virgins  Men shall  knot  and  cut Paper  and even the  Northern  People  A Phrase which for Modesty's Sake  I forbear to translate which denotes a Vice too frequent amongst us"  So far  Plato  That the Ministry foresaw this great Change is plain from the CallicoAct whereby it is now become the Occupation of the Women all over  England  to convert their useless Female Habits into Beds WindowCurtains Chairs and Jointstools  undressing  themselves as it were  before their Transformation  The Philosophy of this Transformation will not seem surprising to People who search into the  Bottom  of Things Madam  Bourignon  a devout  French  Lady has shewn us how Man was at first created Male and Female in one Individual having the Faculty of Propagation within himself A Circumstance necessary to the State of Innocence wherein a Man's Happiness was not to depend upon the Caprice of another It was not till after he had made a  saux pas  that he had his Female Mate Many such Transformations of Individuals have been well attested particularly one by  Montaigne  and another by the late Bishop of  Salisbury  From all which it appears that this System of Male and Female has already undergone and may hereafter suffer several Alterations Every Smatterer in Anatomy knows that a Woman is but an introverted Man a new Fusion and  Flatus  will turn the hollow Bottom of a Bottle into a Convexity but I forbear for the Sake of my  Modest Men Readers  who are in a few Days to be Virgins  In some Subjects the smallest Alterations will do some Men are sufficiently spread about the Hips and contriv'd with that Female Softness  that they want only the Negative Quantity to make them Buxom Wenches and there are Women who are as it were already the  Ebauche  of a good sturdy Man If Nature cou'd be puzzl'd it will be how to bestow the redundant Matter of the exuberant Bubbies that now appear about Town or how to roll out the short dapper Fellows into wellsiz'd Women  This great Conjunction will begin to operate on  Saturday  the th Instant Accordingly about Eight at Night as  Senezino  shall begin at the Opera  Si videte Did you but see  He shall be observed to make an  unusual Motion  upon which the Audience will be affected with a  red Suffusion  over their Countenance And because a strong Succession of the Muscles of the Belly is necessary towards performing this great Operation both Sexes will be thrown into a  profuse involuntary Laughter  Then to use the modest Terms of  Anaximander    shall negative Quantity be turn'd into positive  c Time never beheld nor will it ever assemble such a Number of  untouch'd Virgins  within those Walls but alas such will be the Impatience and Curiosity of People to act in their new Capacity that many of them will go to pot that  very Night  To prevent the Disorders that may happen upon this Occasion is the chief Design of this Paper  Gentlemen have begun already to make use of this Conjunction to Compass their filthy Purposes They tell the Ladies forsooth that it is only parting with a perishable Commodity hardly of so much Value as a Callico Underpetticoat  since like its Mistress it will be useless in the Form it is now in If the Ladies have no Regard to the Dishonour and Immorality of the Action I desire they will consider that Nature who never destroys her own Productions will exempt bigbelly'd Women till the time of their Lyingin so that not to be transform'd will be the same as to be pregnant If they don't think it worth while to defend a Fortress that is to be demolish'd in a few Days let them reflect that it will be a melancholy thing Nine Months hence to be brought to Bed of a Bastard a posthumous Bastard as it were to which the  Quondam  Father can be no more than a  dry Nurse  This wonderful Transformation is the Instrument of Nature to balance Matters between the Sexes The Cruelty of scornful Mistresses shall be return'd The slighted Maid shall grow into an imperious Gallant and reward her Undoer with a big Belly and a Bastard  c  It is hardly possible to imagine the Revolutions that this wonderful Phaenomenon will occasion over the Face of the Earth I long impatiently to see the Proceedings of the Parliament of  Paris  as to the Title of Succession to their Crown this being a Case not provided for by the  Salique  Law There will be no preventing Disorders amongst Friars and Monks for certainly Vows of Chastity don't bind but under the Sex in which they were made The same will hold good with Marriages tho' I think it will be a Scandal amongst Protestants for Husbands and Wives to part since there remains still a possibility to perform the  Debitum  Conjugale  by the Husbands being  femme Couverte  I submit it to the Judgment of the Gentlemen of the Long Robe whether this Transformation does not discharge all Suits of  Rapes  The Pope must undergo a new groping but the false Prophet  Mahomet  has contriv'd Matters well for his Successors for as the Grand Signior has now a great many fine Women he will then have as many fine young Gentlemen at his Devotion  These are surprizing Scenes but I beg leave to affirm that the solemn Operations of Nature are Subjects of Contemplation not of Ridicule therefore I make it my earnest Request to the merry Fellows and giggling Girls about Town that they would not put themselves in a high Twitter when they go to visit a  General  Lying in of his first Child his  Officers  serving as Midwifes Nurses and Rockers dispensing Caudle or if they behold the  Reverend Prelates  dressing the Heads and airing the Linnen at Court I beg they will remember that these Offices must be fill'd with People of the greatest Regularity and best Characters For the same Reason I am sorry that a certain Prelate who notwithstanding his Confinement still preserves his healthy chearful Countenance cannot come in time to be a  Nurse at Court  I likewise earnestly intreat the  Maids of Honour  then  Ensigns  and  Captains  of the  Guards  that at their first setting out they have some Regard to their former Station and do not run wild through all the infamous Houses about Town That the present  Grooms of the BedChamber  then Maids of Honour would not eat Chalk and Lime  in their GreenSickness and in general that the Men would remember that they are become  Retremingent  and not by Inadvertency lift up against Walls and Post  Petticoats will not be burdensome to the  Clergy  but Balls and Assemblies will be indecent for some Time  As for you Coquettes Bawds and Chambermaids the future  Ministers Plenipotentaries  and  CabinetCounsellors  to the Princes of the Earth manage the  great Intrigues  that will be committed to your Charge with your usual Secrecy and Conduct and the Affairs of your Master will go better than ever  O ye  Exchange  Women our Right Worshipful  Representatives  that are to be be not so griping in the Sale of your Ware as your Predecessors but consider that the Nation like a spendthrift Heir has run out Be likewise a little more continent in your  Tongues  than you are at present else the Length of Debates will spoil your Dinners  You Housewifely good Women who now preside over the  Confectionary  henceforth  Commissioners  of the  Treasury  be so  as to dispence the  SugarPlumbs  of the Government with a more impartial and frugal Hand  Ye Prudes and censorious old Maids the Hopes of the  Bench  exert but your usual Talent of  finding Faults  and the Laws will be strictly executed only I would not have you proceed upon such  slender Evidences  as you have done hitherto  It is from you eloquent OysterMerchants of  Billingsgate  just ready to be call'd to the  Bar  and quoif'd like your SisterSerjeants that we expect the shortening the Time and lessening the Expences of LawSuits For I think you are oblig'd to bring your Debates to a  short Issue  and even custom will restrain you from taking the  Oyster  and leaving only the  Shell  to your Clients  O ye Physicians who in the Figure of old Women are to clean the  Tripe  in the Markets scour it as effectually as you have done that of your Patients and the Town will fare most deliciously on  Saturdays  I cannot but congratulate human Nature upon this happy Transformation the only Expedient left to restore the Liberties and Tranquility of Mankind which is so evident that it is almost an Affront to common Sense to insist upon the Proof of it If there can be any such stupid Creature who doubts it I desire he will make but the following obvious Reflection There are in  Europe  alone at present about a Million of sturdy Fellows under the Denomination of  standing Forces  with Arms in their Hands That those are Masters of the Lives Liberties and Fortunes of all the rest I believe no body will deny It is no less true in Fact that Reams of Paper and above a square Mile of Skins of Vellum have been employ'd to no Purpose to settle Peace amongst those Sons of Violence Pray who is he that will say unto them  Go and disband your selves  But lo by this Transformation it is done at once and the  Halcyon  Days of publick Tranquility return For neither the Military Temper nor Dicipline can taint the soft Sex for a  whole Age to come  Bellaque matribus invisa' Wars odious now to Mothers  will not grow immediately palatable in their  Paternal  State  Nor will the Influence of this Transformation be less in  Family  Tranquility than it is in  National  Great Faults will be amended and Frailties forgiven on both Sides A Wife who has been disturb'd with late Hours and choak'd with the Haugoût of a Sot will remember her Sufferings and avoid the Temptation and will for the same Reason indulge her Mate in his Female Capacity in some Passions which she is sensible from Experience are natural to the Sex Such as Vanity of fine Cloths being admir'd  c  And now tenderly must she use her Mate under the Breeding Qualms and LabourPains which she hath felt her self In short all unreasonable Demands upon Husbands must cease because they are already satisfy'd from natural Experience that they are impossible That the Ladies may govern the Affairs of the World and the Gentlemen those of their Houshold better than either of them have hitherto done is the hearty desire of  Their Most Sincere WellWisher M S  ADVERTISEMENTS  PLanetary Powders as necessary for the new Births of Sexes as  Sperma Ceti  for Puerperous Women

of SCIENCES  Written to the most Learned  Dr  F R S from the  Deserts  of  NUBIAD  AMONG all the Enquiries which have been pursu'd by the Curious and Inquisitive there is none more worthy the search of a Learned Head than the Source from whence we derive those Arts and Sciences which raise us so far above the Vulgar the Countries in which they rose and the Channels by which they have been convey'd As they who first brought them amongst us travell'd into the remotest Parts of the Earth to attain them I may  boast of some advantages by the same means since I write this from the Deserts of  Ethiopia  from those Plains of Sand which have buried the Pride of Invading Armies with my Foot perhaps at this instant ten Fathom over the Grave of  Cambyses  a Solitude to which neither  Pythagoras  nor  Apollonius  ever penetrated  It is universally agreed that Arts and Sciences took their Rise among the  Aegyptians  and  Indians  but from whom  they  first receiv'd them is yet a Secret The highest Period of Time to which the Learned attempt to trace them is from the beginning of the  Assyrian Monarchy  when their Inventors were worship'd as Gods It is therefore necessary to go backward into Times even more remote and to gain some knowledge of their History from whatever dark and broken Hints may any way be found in ancient Authors concerning them  Nor  Troy  nor  Thebes  were the first of Empires we have mention tho' not Histories of an earlier warlike People call'd the  Pygmaeans  I cannot but perswade my self from those Accounts of  Il  Hom  Homer Aristotle  and others that their History Wars and Revolutions were then a part of the Study of the Learned from the very Air in which those Authors speak of them as of things universally known And tho' all we directly hear is of their Military Atchievements in the brave defence of their Country from the annual Invasions of a Powerful Enemy yet I cannot  doubt but that they excell'd as much in the Arts of peaceful Government tho' there remain no Traces of their Civil Institutions Empires as great have been swallow'd up in the wreck of Time and such certain Periods have been put to them as occasion a Total Ignorance of their Story And if I should conjecture that the like happen'd to this Nation from a general extirpation of the People by those Flocks of Monstrous Birds wherewith Antiquity agrees they were continually infested it ought not to seem more incredible than that one of the  Baleares  was wasted by Rabbits  Eustathius in Hom  II    Smynthe  by Mice and of late  Speede in  Bermudas  Bermudas  almost depopulated by Rats Nothing is more natural to imagine than that the few survivers of that Empire retired into the depths of their Deserts where they liv'd undisturb'd 'till they were found out by  Osyris  in his Travels to instruct Mankind  He met says  L ch Diod  Diodorus  in  Aethiopia  a sort of  little Satyrs  who were  hairy one half of their Body  and whose leader  Pan  accompany'd him in his Expedition for the civilizing of Mankind Now of this great Personage  Pan  we have a very particular Description in the ancient Writers who unanimously agree to represent him  shaggy Bearded Hairy all over half a Man  and  half a Beast  and walking  erect  with a  Staff  the Posture in which his race are to this Day shown among us And since the chief thing to which he apply'd himself was the  civilizing of Mankind  it should seem that the first Principles of Science  must be receiv'd from this People to whom the  Gods  were by  Il    st  Homer  said to resort  twelve Days every Year  for the Conversation of its Wise and Just Inhabitants  If from  Aegypt  we proceed to take a View of  India  we shall find that their knowledge also deriv'd itself from the same Source To that Country did these Noble Creatures accompany  Bacchus  in his Expedition under the Conduct of  Silenus  who is also describ'd to us with the very same Marks and Qualifications Mankind is ignorant saith  L ch Diod  Diodorus  whence  Silenus  derived his Birth through his great Antiquity but he had a  Tail on his Loins  as likewise had  all his Progeny in sign of their descent  Here then they settled a Colony which to this Day subsists with the same Tails From this time they seem to have communicated themselves only to those Men who retir'd from the Converse of their own Species to a more uninterrupted Life of Contemplation I am much inclin'd to believe that in the midst of those Solitudes they instituted the so much celebrated Order of  Gymnosophists  For whoever observes the  scene  and  manner  of their Life will easily find them to have imitated with all exactness imaginable the Manners and Customs of their Masters and Instructors They are said to  dwell in the thickest Woods  to  go naked  to suffer their Bodies to be  overrun with Hair  and their  Nails  to grow to a  prodigious length  Plutarch  in his first Orat on  Alexander  's Fortune  Plutarch  says they eat what they could  get  in the Fields  their Drink was  Water  and their  Bed  made of  Leaves  or  Moss  And  Herod L  Herodotus  tells us that they esteem'd it a great exploit to  kill very many Ants or creeping Things  Hence we see that the two Nations which contend for the Origine of Learning are the same that have ever most abounded with this ingenious Race Tho' they have contested which was first blest with the rise of Science yet have they conspir'd in being grateful to their common Masters  Aegypt  is well known to have worshipp'd them of old in their  own Images  and  India  may be credibly suppos'd to have done the same from that adoration which they paid in latter times to the  Tooth  of one of these hairy Philosophers as it should seem in just Gratitude to the  Mouth  from which they receiv'd their Knowledge  Pass we now over into  Greece  where we find  Orpheus  returning out of  Aegypt  with the same intent as  Osyris  and  Bacchus  made their Expeditions From this period it was that  Greece  first heard the Name of  Satyrs  or own'd them for  Semidei  And hence it is surely reasonable to conclude that he brought some of this wonderful Species along with him who also had a leader of the line of  Pan  of the same Name and expressly call'd  King  by  Theo Id  st  Theocritus  If thus much be allow'd we easily account for two of the strangest reports in all Antiquity One that the Tradition of  Beasts  following the Musick of  Orpheus  which has been interpreted of his taming Savage Tempers will thus have a  literal Application  The other which we most insist upon is that the Love which these Sages bear to the Females of our Kind affords a Solution of all those Fables of the  Gods compressing Women  in Woods under  bestial appearances  I am sensible it may be objected that they are said to have been compress'd in the Shape of different Animals but to this we answer that Women under such apprehensions hardly know what shape they have to deal with  From what has been last said 'tis highly credible that to this ancient and generous Race the World is indebted if not for the  Heroes  at least for the acutest  Wits  of Antiquity One of the most remarkable instances is that great mimick Genius  Vit Aesop initio  Aesop  for whose extraction from these  Sylvestres Homines  we may gather an Argument from  Planudes  who says that  Aesop  signifies the same thing as  Aethiop  the Original Nation of our People For a second Argument we may offer the description of his Person which was  short deform'd  and almost  Savage  insomuch that he might have liv'd in the Woods had not the benevolence of his Temper made him rather adapt himself to our Manners and come to Court in wearing Apparel The third Proof is his acute and satyrical Wit and lastly his great Knowledge in the  Nature of Beasts  together with the natural Pleasure he took to speak of them upon all Occasions  The next instance I shall produce is  Vid  Plato  and  Xenophon  Socrates  First it was a Tradition that he was of an uncommon Birth from the rest of Men Secondly he had a Countenance confessing the Line he sprung from being  bald flatnos'd  with  prominent Eyes  and a  downward look  Thirdly he turn'd certain Fables of Aesop into Verse probably out of his respect to Beasts in general and love to his Family in particular  In process of time the Women with whom these Sylvans would have lovingly cohabited were either taught by Mankind or induc'd by an abhorrence of their Shapes to shun their embraces so that our Sages were necessitated to mix with Beasts This by degrees occasion'd the Hair of their Posterity to grow higher than their Middles It arose in one Generation to their Arms in the Second it invaded their Necks in the Third it gain'd the ascendant of their Heads 'till the degenerate Appearance in which the Species is now immers'd became compleated Tho' we must here observe that there were a few who fell not under the common Calamity there being some unprejudic'd Women in every Age by virtue of whom a Total extinction of the Original Race was prevented And it is remarkable also that even where they were mix'd the Defection from their Nature was not intire there still appear'd marvellous Qualities among them as was manisest in those who follow'd  Alexander  in  India  How did they attend his Army and survey his Order How did they cast themselves into  the same forms for March or for Combat W  an imitation was there of all his Discipline the ancient true remains of a warlike Disposition and of that Constitution which they enjoy'd while they were a Monarchy  To proceed to  Italy  At the first Appearance of these wild Philosophers there were some of the least mix'd who vouchsafed to converse with Mankind which is evident from the Name of  Livy  Fauns  a  fando  or  speaking  Such was he who coming out of the Woods in hatred to Tyranny encourag'd the  Roman  Army to proceed against the  Hetruscans  who would have restor'd  Tarquin  But here as in all the Western Parts of the World there was a great and memorable  Aera  in which they began to be  Silent  This we may place something near the time of  Aristotle  when the Number Vanity and Folly of Human Philosophers encreas'd by which Men's Heads became too much puzzled to receive the Wisdom of these ancient Sylvans the Questions of that Academy were too numerous to be consistent with their ease to answer and too intricate extravagant idle or pernicious to be any other than a derision and scorn unto them From this Period if ever we hear of their giving Answers it is only when  caught bound  and  constrain'd  in like manner as was that Ancient  Grecian  Prophet  Proteus  Accordingly we read in  Plutarch in Vit Sylla  Sylla  's Time of such a Philosopher taken near  Dyrrachium  who wou'd not be persuaded to give them a Lecture by all  they cou'd say to him and only shew'd his Power in  Sounds  by Neighing like a Horse  But a more successful attempt was made in  Augustus  's reign by the Inquisitive Genius of the great  Virgil  whom together with  Varus  the Commentators suppose to have been the true Persons who are related in the th Bucolick to have caught a Philosopher and doubtless a genuine one of the Race of the old  Silenus  To prevail upon him to be communicative of the importance of which  Virgil  was well aware they not only ty'd him fast but allur'd him likewise by making him a present of a comely Maiden call'd  Aegle  which made him sing both merrily and instructively In this Song we have their  Doctrine  of the  Creation  the same in all probability as was taught so many Ages before in the great  Pygmaean  Empire and several Hieroglyphical Fables under which they couch'd or embellish'd their Morals For which reason I look upon this Bucolick as an inestimable Treasure of the most ancient Science  In the Reign of  Constantine  we hear of another taken in a Net and brought to  Alexandria  round whom the People flock'd to hear his Wisdom but as  Ammianus Marcellinus  reporteth he prov'd a dumb Philosopher and only instructed by  Action  The last we shall speak of who seemeth to be of the true Race is said by St  Jerome  to have met St  Vit St Ant  Anthony  in a Desert who enquiring the Way of him he shew'd his understanding  and Courtesy by pointing but wou'd not answer for he was a dumb Philosopher also  These are all the Notices which I am at present able to gather of the appearance of so great and learned a People in  your side  of the World But if we return to their ancient native Seats  Africa  and  India  we shall there find even in modern times the Traces of their Original Conduct and Valour  In  Africa  as we read among the indefatigable Mr  Purchas  's Collections a Body of them whose Leader was inflam'd with Love for a Woman by martial Powers and Stratagem won a Fort from the  Portuguese  But I must leave all others at present to celebrate the Praise of two of their unparallel'd Monarchs in  India  The one was  Perimal the Magnificent  a Prince most Learned and Communicative to whom in  Malabar  their excess of Zeal dedicated a Temple rais'd on Seven hundred Pillars not inferior in  Maff l  Maffaeus  's Opinion to those of  Agrippa  in the  Pantheon  The other  Hanimant the Marvellous  his Relation and Successor whose Knowledge was so great as made his followers doubt if even that Wise Species cou'd arrive at such Perfection and therefore they rather imagin'd him and his Race a sort of  Gods  form'd into  Apes  His was the  Tooth  which the  Portuguese  took in  Bisnagar  for which the  Indians  offer'd according to  Linschot ch  Linschotten  the immense Sum of Seven hundred thousand Ducats Nor let me quit this Head without mentioning  with all due respect  Oran Outang  the Great the last of this Line whose unhappy Chance it was to fall into the Hands of  Europeans Oran Outang  whose Value was not known to us for he was a mute Philosopher  Oran Outang  by whose dissection the Learned Dr  Tyson  has added a Confirmation to this System from the resemblance between the  Homo Sylvestris  and our  Humane Body  in those Organs by which the rational Soul is exerted  We must now descend to consider this People as sunk into the  bruta Natura  by their continual Commerce with Beasts Yet even at this time what Experiments do they not afford us of relieving some from the Spleen and others from Imposthumes by occasioning Laughter at proper Seasons With what readiness do they enter into the imitation of whatever is remarkable in Human Life and what surprising Relations have  Le Comte  and others given of their Appetites Actions Conceptions Affections Varieties of Imaginations and Abilities capable of pursuing them If under their present low circumstances of  Birth  and  Breeding  and in so short a Term of Life as is now allotted them they so far exceed all Beasts and equal many Men what Prodigies may we not conceive of those who were  Nati melioribus annis  those Primitive  Longaeval  and  Antideluvian ManTegers  who first taught Sciences to the World  This Account which is entirely my own I am proud to imagine has traced Knowledge from a Fountain correspondent to several Opinions of the Ancients tho' hitherto undiscover'd both  by them and the Moderns And now what shall I say to Mankind in the Thought of this great Discovery What but that they should abate of their Pride and consider that the Authors of our Knowledge are among  Beasts  That these who were our elder Brothers by a Day in the Creation whose Kingdom was like the Scheme of  Plato  govern'd by Philosophers who flourish'd with Learning in  Aethiopia  and  India  are now undistinguish'd from and known only by the same Appellation as the  ManTeger  and the  Monkey  As to  Speech  I make no question that there are Remains of the First and less corrupted Race in their Native Deserts who yet have the Power of it But the vulgar Reason given by the  Spaniards  "that they will not speak for fear of being set to Work"  is alone a sufficient one considering how exceedingly all other Learned Persons affect their  Ease  A Second is That these observant Creatures having been EyeWitnesses of the  Cruelty  with which that Nation treated their Brother  Indians  find it necessary not to show themselves to be  Men  that they may be protected not only from Work but from Cruelty also Thirdly They cou'd at best take no delight to converse with the  Spaniards  whose  grave  and  sullen  Temper is so averse to that natural and open  Chearfulness  which is generally observ'd to accompany all true Knowledge  But now were it possible that any way cou'd be found out to draw forth their Latent Qualities I cannot but think it wou'd be highly serviceable to the Learned World both in respect of recovering past Knowledge and promoting the Future  Might there not be found certain gentle artful Methods whereby to endear us to them Is there no Nation in the World whose natural turn is adapted to engage their Society and win them by a  sweet Similitude  of  Manners  Is there no Nation where the Men might allure them by a distingushing Civility and in a manner  fascinate  them by  assimilated Motions  No Nation where the Women with easy freedoms and the gentlest Treatment might oblige the loving Creatures to sensible returns of Humanity The Love I bear my native Country prompts me to wish this Nation might be  Great Britain  but alas in our present wretched divided Condition how can we hope that  Foreigners  of so great Prudence will  freely declare  their Sentiments in the midst of violent  Parties  and at so vast a distance from their Friends Relations and Country The Affection I bear our NeighbourState wou'd incline me to wish it were  HollandSed laevâ in parte Mamillae Nil salit Arcadico  'Tis from  France  then we must expect this Restoration of Learning whose late Monarch took the Sciences under his Protection and rais'd them to so great a Height May we not hope their Emissaries will some time or other have Instructions not only to invite Learned Men into their Country but Learned Beasts the true ancient ManTegers I mean of  Aethopia  and  India  Might not the Talents of each Kind of these be adapted to the Improvement of the several Sciences The ManTegers to instruct Heroes Statesmen and Scholars Baboons to teach the Courtiers Ceremony and Address Monkeys the Art of pleasing  in Conversation and agreeable Affectations to Ladies and their Lovers The Apes of less learning Comedians and Dancing Masters The Marmosets Court Pages and young  English  Travellers But the distinguishing each Kind and allotting them to their proper Business I leave to the Inquisitive and penetrating Genius of the  Jesuits  in their respective Missions  Vale Fruere  M S  VIRGILIUS RESTAURATUS SEU  MARTINI SCRIBLERI  Summi Critici CASTIGATIONUM in AENEIDEM SPECIMEN  AENEIDEM to tam

 As also of the  Faustina  the celebrated  Italian  Singing Woman And of the CopperFarthing Dean from  Ireland  And Lastly Of the wonderful Wild Man that was nursed in the Woods of  Germany  by a Wild Beast hunted and taken in Toyls how he behaveth himself like a dumb Creature and is a Christian like one of us being call'd  Peter  and how he was brought to Court all in green to the great Astonishment of the Quality and Gentry  WE shall begin with a Description of  Peter  the Savage deferring our other Curiosities to some following Papers  Romulus  and  Remus  the two famous wild Men of Antiquity and  Orsin  that of the Moderns have been justly the Admiration of all Mankind Nor can we presage less of this wild Youth as may be gather'd from that famous and well known Prophecy of  Lilly  's which being now accomplish'd is most easily interpreted  When  Rome  shall wend to  Benevento  And  Espagne  breaking the  Assiento  When Eagle Split shall fly to  China  And Christian Folks adore  Faustina  Then shall an Oak be brought to Bed  Of Creature neither taught nor fed  Great Feats shall he atchieve  The Pope is now going to  Benevento  the  Spaniards  having broke their Treaty the Emperor Trades to  China  and  Lilly  were he alive must be convinced that it was not the Empress  Faustina  that was meant in the Prophecy  It is evident by several Tokens about this wild Gentleman that he had a Father and Mother like one of us but there being no Register of his Christening his Age is only to be guessed at by his Stature and Countenance and appeareth to be about Twelve or Thirteen His being so young was the Occasion of the great Disappointment of the Ladies who came to the Drawing Room in full Expectation of some Attempt upon their Chastity So far is true that he endeavour'd to Kiss the young Lady  W  le  who for that reason is become the Envy of the Circle this being a Declaration of Nature in favour of her superior Beauty  Aristotle  saith That Man is the most Mimick of all Animals which Opinion of that great Philosopher is strongly confirm'd by the Behaviour of this wild Gentleman who is endow'd with that Quality to an extream Degree He receiv'd his first Impressions at Court His  Maners are first to lick People's Hands and then turn his Breech upon them to thurst his Hand into every body's  Pocket  to climb over People's  Heads  and even to make use of the  Royal Hand  to  take  what he has a mind to At his first Appearance he seiz'd on the Lord Chamberlain's Staff and put on his Hat before the King from whence some have conjectur'd that he is either descended from a Grandee of  Spain  or the Earls of  Kingsale  in  Ireland  However these are manifest Tokens of his innate Ambition he is extreamly tenacious of his own Property and ready to invade that of other People By this mimick Quality he discover'd what wild Beast had nurs'd him Observing Children to ask Blessing of their Mothers one Day he fell down upon his Knees to a Sow and mutter'd some Sounds in that humble Posture  It has been commonly thought that he is  Ulrick  's natural Brother because of some resemblance of Manners and the officious Care of  Ulrick  about him but the Superiority of the Parts and Genius in  Peter  demonstrates this to be impossible  Though he is ignorant both of ancient and modern Languages that Care being left to the ingenious Physician who is entrusted with his Education yet he distinguishes Objects by certain Sounds fram'd to himself which Mr  Rotenberg  who brought him over understands perfectly Beholding one day the Shambles with great Fear and Astonishment ever since he calls Man by the same Sound which expresseth Wolf A young Lady is a Peacock old Women Magpyes and Owls a  Beau with a  Toupee  a Monkey Glass Ice Blue Red and Green Ribbons he calls Rainbows an Heap of Gold a Turd The first Ship he saw he took to be a great Beast swimming on her Back and her Feet tied above her The Men that came out of the Hold he took to be her Cubs and wonder'd they were so unlike their Dam He understands perfectly the Language of all Beasts and Birds and is not like them confin'd to that of one Species He can bring any Beast what he calls for and no doubt is much miss'd now in his Native Woods where he us'd to do good Offices among his Fellow Citizens and serv'd as a Mediator to reconcile their Differences One Day he warn'd a Flock of Sheep that were driving to the Shambles of their Danger and upon uttering some Sounds they all fled He takes vast Pleasure in Conversation with Horses and going to the  Meuse  to converse with two of his intimate Acquaintances in the King's Stable as he pass'd by he Neighed to the horse at  CharingCross  being as it were surpriz'd to see him so high he seem'd to take it ill that the Horse did not answer him but I think no body can undervalue his Understanding for not being skill'd in Statuary  He expresseth his Joy most commonly by Neighing and whatever the Philosophers may talk of their Risibility Neighing is a more Noble Expression of that Passion than Laughing which seems to me to have something Silly in it and besides is often attended with Tears Other Animals are sensible they debase themselves by mimicking Laughter and I take it to be a general Observation that the top Felicity of Mankind is  to imitate Monkeys and Birds Witness  Hartequins Scaramouches  and  Masquerades  on the other Hand Monkeys when they would look extreamly silly endeavour to bring themselves down to Mankind Love he expresseth by the Cooing of a Dove and Anger by the Croaking of a Raven and it is not doubted but that he will serve in Time as an Interpreter between us and other Animals  Great Instruction is to be had from this wild Youth in the knowledge of Simples and I am of Opinion that he ought always to attend the Censors of the College in their Visitation of Apothecaries Shops  I am told that the new  Sect  of  Herbeaters  intend to follow him into the Fields or to beg him for a Clerk of their Kitchen And that there are many of them now thinking of turning their Children into Woods to Graze with the Cattle in hopes to raise a healthy and moral Race refin'd from the Corruptions of this Luxurious World  He sings naturally several pretty Tunes of his own Composing and with equal Facility in the  Chromatick Inharmonick  and  Diatonick  Stile and consequently must be of infinite Use to the Academy in judging of the Merits of their Composers and is the only Person that ought to decide betwixt  Cuzzoni  and  Faustina  I cannot omit his first Notion of Cloaths which he took to be the natural Skins of the Creatures that wore them and seem'd to be in great Pain for the pulling off a Stocking thinking the poor Man was a Fleaing  I am not ignorant that there are disaffected People  who say he is a  Pretender  and no genuine wild Man This Calumny proceeds from the false Notions they have of wild Men which they frame from such as they see about the Town whose Actions are rather absurd than wild therefore it will be incumbent on all young Gentlemen who are ambitious to excel in this Character to Copy this true Original of Nature  The Senses of this wild Man are vastly more acute than those of a tame One he can follow the Track of a Man or any other Beast of Prey A Dog is an Ass to him for finding Troufles his Hearing is more perfect because his Ears not having been confin'd by Bandages he can move them like a Drill and turn them towards the Sonorous Object  Let us pray the Creator of all Beings Wild and Tame that as this wild Youth by being brought to Court has been made a Christian so such as are at Court and are no Christians may lay aside their Savage and Rapacious Nature and return to the Meekness of the Gospel  An INFALIBLE SCHEME To Pay the PUBLICK DEBT OF IRELAND in Six Months  THE great Distress of this unhappy  Country  is too visible to all except those who have Power to redress it  We may observe thro' the whole Nation one universal Complaint of the Decay of Trade the Oppression of Landlords and the Deficiency of Money and yet I cannot find among all the Schemes proposed to lessen these Evils any one in particular which seems likely to succeed  But what is still an Addition to this melancholy Prospect of Affairs is the unbounded  Luxury  and  Extravagance  both in Apparel and  Entertaiments which Persons of all Ranks and Degrees run into at present tho' in general we labour under such Hardships and Poverty  We are affected in a quite different Manner from all the Nations upon Earth for with others  Wealth  is the Mother of  Luxury  but with us  Poverty  has the very same Effect With others  Scarcity  is the Parent of Industry but with us it is the Nurse of  Idleness  and  Vice  We labour to imitate our neighbouring Kingdoms in nothing but their Extravagance without having the same plentiful Aids of  Commerce  or applying ourselves to the Study of  Fairdealing  to maintain it So that in short by our own ill Management we are brought to so low an Ebb of Wealth and Credit that our Condition seems incapable of any Relief  But as I have the Interest of this misguided People very much at Heart I do not intend this Essay as a Detection of their present Grievances but as a Remedy against them And for that Purpose I have labour'd to find out such a  Scheme  as will discharge our publick Debt with all possible Ease and Pleasure to the Subject and in so short a Time that we may neither complain of being oppressed with long continued Taxes as some unreasonable People often presume to do nor quite despair of being once more in a thriving Condition  Let us consider what those  Vices  are which at present prevail most among us and I believe upon Enquiry they will be found  Perjury Fornication Drunkenness Swearing Slander Infidelity Fraud Blasphemy  and many others  Would it not then be worthy of our Consideration whether a moderate Tax upon every particular  Vice  instead of laying an additional Duty upon  Wine Hops  and other Commodities wou'd not supply us with a sufficient Sum in a very short Time Such a Tax must of Necessity yield a vast Revenue and prove the most infallible and indeed the only Scheme for our Prosperity if it shall be thought proper to be continued  But before I proceed to Particulars it may not be amiss to premise that this Tax is not designed for any one County or Province in this Kingdom but to extend itself universally over the whole Nation because different Vices may flourish in different Counties as different Plants in their different Soils as  Perjury  in one  Theft  in another  Dissimulation  and  Flattery  in another  Rapine  in another and so of the rest However I take  Theft  to be our peculiar  staple Vice  And least any Disputes may hereafter arise about the Nature of  Perjury  the Intention of the  Act  in this particular or what Persons are to be subject to this Tax I must here also premise that every  Lie  confirmed by an Oath is undoubtedly  Perjury  whether before a  Magistrate  or behind a  Counter  And therefore we do not doubt but the Trading Part of our People will be great Benefactors to the Publick in this particular Article as well as many others  These two Things being premis'd let us  suppose that in this large Country Persons are guilty of this Infirmity each DayWhich Computation must be allow'd very moderate if we recollect that this Number is not above a fourhundredth Part of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom who are generally computed to amount to  Two Millions  And if we further consider what strong Inducements our Natives have to practise it from its being often so exceeding beneficial if we consider the great Use made of it in all Sorts of  Traffick  the great Demands for it in  Lawsuits  the great Advantage of it in  Elections  and the undeniable Profit of it in all  Prosecutions  we shall think the Number of still more reasonable  Let us then suppose every one of this Number to be perjur'd only once every Day which is a very favourable Supposition and subject only to a Tax of Sixpence for each Offence for which Sum perhaps he may procure either the Death of an Enemy an Estate for his Friend or a Fortune for himself all which are esteem'd very desirable the Tax will be too inconsiderable to make any one murmur and yet will yield the Sum of  l per Day  towards discharging our National Debt  Besides this Tax tho' very low may in Reality be very profitable for Mankind for  Attornies Sollicitors Usurers Butchers  and other honest Traders will scarce think it answerable to the Expence of Time to forswear themselves for any Profit from One Penny to Six Pence inclusive as now customary but will at least  for every Transgression expect to gain sufficient to defray the Tax  However I would have all sworn  Constables  and all  Collectors  of this and many other Taxes entirely exempted from any Penalty as priviledg'd Persons because by that Means they will be enabled to be very serviceable in their several Stations  Fornication as the World is at present would furnish the Publick with a large Sum even at a very moderate Tax for it is now made an essential Part of the polite Gentleman's Character and he that has prevail'd on the greatest Number proportionably rises in Reputation  Let us then compute that in the several Parts of this Nation  per  Day were liable to be taxed for this general Vice only at two Shillings The Sum arising from this to the publick Good will amount to  l per  Day and in Six Months to almost one Third of our National Debt  I know it may be here objected that I have computed upon too small a Number and that I might justly account rather upon Twenty or Thirty Thousand  per  Day in the several Counties of this Kingdom But tho' I own this Objection to be very strong if we were to consider the Opportunities of  Wakes PatronDays Haymaking  Seasons  MayDays Religious Pilgrimages to Holy Wells Balls  publick and private and many other commodious Scenes for that kind of Entertainment yet I would rather chuse to err on the right Side in too small than too great a Computation  I know the  Popish  Clergy will make strong Remonstrances against this Tax and plead that it is design'd to oppress them that all Nations of the Earth allow them a  Toleration  in this particular Point as they are  frail  Mortals and sworn to  Celibacy  and what is still worse that such a Tax would be the most effectual Means to drain them of their whole Revenues but as I would not have such pious Persons justly complain of the least Rigour I shall readily agree to their being exempted  Drunkenness I would only Tax at Six Pence because it might be prejudicial to  His Majesty's Revenue  to discourage it and consequently subject the Proposer to Penalties  Let us then compute that only Twenty Thousand Persons which is but one hundredth Part of the People in this Kingdom were daily liable to be tax'd the Amount would be  l per  Day And how extreamly moderate this Computation is may appear to any one who considers that besides the usual Opportunities of  Taverns  and  private Houses  there are  Elections Fairs Mayor  's  Feasts University Treats Corporation Dinners Christmas Regales Weddings  and  Christnings  both in Town and Country and many other irresistible Inducements to this manly Vice which would perhaps if nicely calculated daily furnish us with two Thirds more than our computed Number and by that Means greatly conduce to the Publick Good  But however I would by all Means exempt all Country  Justices of the Peace  whether  Squires  or  Parsons  because it would be unseemly to see such honourable and reverend Personages insulted by meaner Officers as often as they might be discover'd in such a Condition  Swearing would be a most universal Benefit in this Case because at present it serves to season the Discourse of all Ranks and Degrees of Men It is the principal Ingredient and Decoration of all modern  Jokes Gibes Quarrels LoveSpeeches Disputes Threats  and  Promises  and consequently capable of affording an incredible Revenue  However let us suppose Persons  per  Day liable to the Tax of Six Pence only for each Offence of this Kind which considering the great Number of  Markets CoffeeHouses Shambles Barracks  and  GamingHouses  in this Kingdom is a very inconsiderable Number yet even this Article will furnish us with  l per  Day which would amount to near two Thirds of the publick Debt  Our Laws have amerced each Offence in this way at One Shilling ordering one half to the Informer and the other to the Poor which in my humble Opinion was very ill concerted for if the  Legislature  did really intend that this Law should be punctually enforced they ought to have divided the whole  Mulct  between the  Informer  and the  Justice  without any regard to the Poor and then they might be assured it would be vigorously executed  I am already apprehensive that all military Persons will expect an Exemption from Taxes on this Account because they may plead Precedents  for many Generations may alledge the Power of Custom the Decency and Comliness of it when properly mingled with other Discourse or that the censorious World would perhaps suspect they knew nothing of  God  at all if they did not sometimes mention his Name and many other Reasons of equal Weight But though these Remonstrances are very just yet as this is the only Means by which some think a Standing Army can conduce to the national Good it will be hard to exempt them  However as the military Power would infallibly be liable to this Tax in all its Branches by which Means they might be utterly impoverish'd I believe it may not be improper to allow all  FootSoldiers  and  FieldOfficers  all young  Ensigns  spruce  Cornets  naval  Captains CabinBoys  and  QuarterMasters  forty or fifty Oaths a Day entirely free from any Tax or Penalty  As for  Slander  supposing only twenty thousand  per  Day taxed at Six Pence for every Offence this Article would daily afford the Publick at the lowest reasonable Computation five hundred Pounds  And as this is a favourite Talent we might have ventur'd to tax it much higher but I would not seem to discourage so charitable a Disposition especially where it may promote the Interest of my Country  As to the  Ladies  I have been always too great an Admirer of theirs to desire any Restriction should be laid on their Pleasure either private or publick and therefore I would have  them tax'd only half as much as the Men for every little Error of this Kind because  Slander  in Men is a Talent unnatural and acquired and generally practised to ingratiate themselves with the opposite Sex whereas this genteel Failing in  Females  is innate and impossible to be restrain'd which is a Case that demands our utmost Compassion  I think all  DrawingRooms Assemblies  and all Places of publick Resort for Ladies ought to be exempt from any Penalty because it is so material a Part of the Discourse and Amusement of those Places that to tax them for each Offence would be in Effect to enjoin them perpetual Silence which if it were possible would be too great a Misfortune both to themselves and the World to be exacted from them  Infidelity and  Blasphemy  would furnish us with a considerable Sum and as they are not originally of our own Growth but annually imported from neighbouring Kingdoms they ought to be subject to some Duty which in few Years would probably be a vast Addition to the publick Revenue Yet as this Traffick is principally carried on by young  Lawyers  and  travelling Squires  any Attempt to tax it would certainly meet with too vigorous an Opposition But on condition it might pass into a Law I would gladly exempt both  Lawyers  of all Ages  Subaltern  and  FieldOfficers young Heirs DancingMasters PickPockets  and  Players  Let us now only consider the several Sums arising from the Tax on our  Vices  as we have before computed them and the Justness and  Infallibility of this Scheme must appear demonstrably     l  The publick Debt of this Nation is about    And the Tax  l per  Day  For Perjury    Fornication    Drunkenness    Swearing    Slander    Total  per  Day    which in Days or half a Year will amount to  l  which is considerably more than our National Debt  But left by the universal Poverty of our People which is much to be fear'd or by their growing more virtuous which never can be reasonably apprehended this daily Income should fall short of what we have computed I must humbly beg Leave to offer some other Improvements of this Scheme which will undoubtedly answer all Deficiencies  And for this Purpose what if a severe Tax was laid on all manner of Persons who presum'd to marry 'till they were full Forty Years old If any should prove Foolhardy enough to transgress a Law so calculated for the Happiness of Men each Offence would be of signal Benefit to the Publick and if providentially it should prove an effectual  Restraint there must of Necessity be fewer Children in each Family and of Consequence the Number of Beggars and Wretches in this Kingdom must proportionably decrease And what would still be more material perhaps in one Age if this beneficial Act should be continued the greatest part of this Country would require to be new peopled from  E  d  a Circumstance greatly to be wish'd because such an Accident would probably cure that Nation of its inveterate Antipathy to the Inhabitants of this at least for some Generations  As for the Scheme to tax Batchelors which has lately been propos'd to the House by one of its Honourable Members I must beg leave to think it highly improper because batchelors of all Ranks and Degrees are real Benefactors to the Publick by not furnishing it either with  Beggars  or  Oppressors of Beggars  one of which must infallibly be the Consequence of Marriage in this Country  I would also earnestly request that all young  Clergymen  who with more Passion than Prudence shall dare to marry before they are benefic'd may be liable to a most severe Tax equal to a Prohibition because such Offenders must inevitably multiply  Beggars  live in  Contempt  and die in  Poverty  These and many other Expedients might easily be found upon any Emergency to furnish considerable Sums for the National Debt  But as there will remain about  l  over and above our publick Debt I will allow One Hundred Thousand Pounds of it for Sallaries to  such Persons as shall be appointed Collectors and I hope this will be a reasonable Provision tho' generally above one half of every Tax is expended in paying proper Officers to collect it The Overplus may be deposited in the Treasury for any other pious Use  And if this Scheme should be so fortunate as to succeed as I have no Reason to doubt from the present Disposition of the H  of C  s all those Noblemen who shall be appointed Commissioners will have excellent Opportunities of promoting their  Nephews Cousins Footmen Fosterers Valets  and other valuable Dependants to good Incomes and Places of Trust and Credit But I would by all Means have none but  Englishmen  nominated to be Tax Gatherers because we may rationally suppose that they will be entirely free from Prejudice in Favour of the Natives of this Kingdom  Thus would a moderate Tax upon our  Vices  apparently contribute to save this Nation from utter Ruin Many Persons who have not the least Excuse for their Irregularities at present except the commendable Publickspirited Contempt for Religion might then plead in their own Defence that their Immoralities had preserved their Country And by this Means we might be furnish'd with a Multitude of  Patriots  who probably would never prove so in any other Respect  But I must humbly beg leave to dissent from that religious Gentleman the excellent Author of the  Fable of the Bees  though perhaps such a Particularity of Opinion may injure my Character  with several of my Laybrethren of most Professions and I must publickly declare that there can be no other Method half so good as mine to make  Private Vices Publick Benefits  A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR Preventing the Children of poor people in  Ireland  from being a Burden to their Parents or Country and for making them Beneficial to the Publick  IT is a melancholy Object to those who walk through this great Town or travel in the Country when they see the  Streets  the  Roads  and  Cabbindoors  crowded with  Beggars  of the Female Sex followed by three four or six Children  all in Rags  and importuning every Passenger for an Alms These  Mothers  instead of being able to work for their honest livelyhood are forced to employ all their time in Stroling to beg Sustenance for their  helpless Infants  who as they grow up either turn  Thieves  for want of Work or leave their  dear Native Country to fight for the Pretender in  Spain or sell themselves to the  Barbadoes  I think it is agreed by all Parties that this prodigious number of Children in the Arms or on the Backs or at the  Heels  of their  Mothers  and frequently of their  Fathers  is  in the present deplorable state of the Kingdom  a very great additional Grievance and therefore whoever could find out a fair cheap and easy method of making these Children sound and useful Members of the Commonwealth would deserve so well of the Publick as to have his Statue set up for a Preserver of the Nation  But my Intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the Children of  professed Beggars  it is of a much greater Extent and shall take in the whole Number of Infants at a certain Age who are born of Parents in effect as little able to support them as those who demand our Charity in the Streets  As to my own Part having turned my Thoughts for many Years upon this important Subject and maturely weighed the several  Schemes for no Projectors  I have always found them grossly mistaken in their Computation It is true a Child  just dropt from its Dam  may be supported by her Milk for a Solar Year with little other Nourishment at most not above the Value of two Shillings which the Mother may certainly get or the Value in  Scraps  by her lawful Occupation of Begging and it is exactly at one Year Old that I propose to provide for them in such a Manner as instead of being a Charge upon their  Parents  or the  Parish  or  wanting Food and Raiment  for the rest of their Lives they shall on the Contrary contribute to the feeding and partly to the  Cloathing of many Thousands  There is likewise another great Advantage in my Scheme that it will prevent those  voluntary Abortions  and that horrid Practice of  Women murdering their Bastard Children  alas too frequent among us Sacrificing the  poor innocent Babes  I doubt more to avoid the Expence than the Shame which would move Tears and Pity in the most savage and inhuman Breast  The number of Souls in this Kingdom being usually reckoned one Million and a half Of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand Couple whose Wives are Breeders from which number I substract thirty Thousand Couples who are able to maintain their own Children although I apprehend there cannot be so many under  the present Distresses of the Kingdom  but this being granted there will remain an hundred and seventy Thousand Breeders I again substract fifty Thousand for those Women who miscarry or whose Children die by accident or disease within the Year There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand Children of poor Parents annually born The question therefore is How this number shall be reared and provided for which as I have already said under the present Situation of Affairs is utterly impossible by all the Methods hitherto proposed for we can  neither employ them in Handicraft  or  Agriculture  we neither build Houses I mean in the Country nor cultivate Land They can very seldom pick up a Livelihood  by Stealing  'till they arrive at six years old except where they are of towardly parts although I confess they learn the Rudiments  much earlier during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as  Probationers  as I have been informed by a principal Gentleman in the County of  Cavan  who protested to me that he never knew above one or two Instances under the Age of six even in a part of the Kingdom  so renowned for the quickest Proficiency in that Art  I am assured by our Merchants that a Boy or a Girl before twelve years old is no saleable Commodity and even when they come to this Age they will not yield above three Pounds or three Pounds and half a Crown at most on the Exchange which cannot turn to Account either to the Parents or Kingdom the Charge of Nutriment and Rags having been at least four times that Value  I shall now therefore humbly propose my own Thoughts which I hope will not be liable to the least Objection  I have been assured by a very knowing  American  of my Acquaintance in  London  that a young healthy Child well Nursed is at a Year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome Food whether  Stewed Roasted Baked  or  Boiled  and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a  Fricasie  or a  Ragoust  I do therefore humbly offer it to  publick Consideration  that of the Hundred and twenty thousand Children already computed twenty thousand may be reserved for Breed whereof only one fourth Part to be Males which is more than we allow to  Sheep black Cattle  or  Swine  and my Reason is that these Children are seldom the Fruits of Marriage  a Circumstance not much  regarded by our Savages  therefore  one Male  will be sufficient to serve four Females That the remaining Hundred thousand may at a Year old be offered in Sale to the Persons of  Quality  and  Fortune  through the Kingdom always advising the Mother to let them Suck plentifully in the last Month so as to render them Plump and Fat for a good Table A Child will make two Dishes at an Entertainment for Friends and when the Family dines alone the fore or hind Quarter will make a reasonable Dish and seasoned with a little Pepper or Salt will be very good Boiled on the fourth Day especially in  Winter  I have reckoned upon a Medium that a Child just born will weigh Pounds and in a solar Year if tolerably nursed encreaseth to Pounds  I grant this food will be somewhat dear and therefore very  proper for Landlords  who as they have already devoured most of the Parents seem to have the best Title to the Children  Infant's flesh will be in Season throughout the Year but more plentiful in  March  and a little before and after for we are told by a grave Author an eminent  French  Physician that  Fish being a prolifick Dyet  there are more Children born in  Roman Catholick Countries  about nine Months after  Lent  than at any other Season therefore reckoning a Year after  Lent  the Markets will be more glutted than usual because the Number of  Popish Infants  is at least three to one in this Kingdom and therefore it will have one other Collateral Advantage by lessening the Number of  Papists  among us  I have already computed the Charge of nursing a Beggar's Child in which List I reckon all  Cottagers Labourers  and fourfifths of the  Farmers  to be about two Shillings  per Annum  Rags included and I believe no Gentleman would repine to give Ten Shillings for the  Carcass of a good fat Child  which as I have said will make four Dishes of excellent Nutritive Meat when he hath only some particular Friend or his own Family to dine with him Thus the Squire will learn to be a good Landlord and grow popular among his Tenants the Mother will have Eight Shillings neat Profit and be fit for Work 'till she produces another Child  Those who are more thrifty  as I must confess the Times require  may flea the Carcass the Skin of which Artificially dressed will make admirable  Gloves for Ladies  and  Summer Boots  for  fine Gentlemen  As to our City of  Dublin  Shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the most convenient Parts of it and Butchers we may be assured will not be wanting although I rather recommend buying the Children alive and dressing them hot from the Knife as we do  roasting Pigs  A very worthy Person  a true Lover of his Country  and whose Virtues I highly esteem was lately pleased in discoursing on this Matter to offer a Refinement upon my Scheme He said that many Gentlemen of this Kingdom having of late destroyed their Deer he conceived that the Want of Venison might be well supply'd by the Bodies of young Lads and Maidens not exceeding  fourteen Years of Age nor under twelve so great a Number of both Sexes in every Country being now ready to starve for want of Work and Service And these to be disposed of by their Parents if alive or otherwise by their nearest Relations But with due deference to so excellent a Friend and so deserving a Patriot I cannot be altogether in his Sentiments for as to the Males my  American  Acquaintance assured me from frequent Experience that their Flesh was generally Tough and Lean like that of our Schoolboys by continual Exercise and their Taste disagreeable and to fatten them would not answer the Charge Then as to the Females it would I think with humble Submission  be a Loss to the Publick  because they soon would become Breeders themselves And besides it is not improbable that some scrupulous People might be apt to Censure such a Practice although indeed very unjustly as a little bordering upon Cruelty which I confess hath always been with me the strongest Objection against any Project how well soever intended  But in order to justify my Friend he confessed that this Expedient was put into his Head by the famous  Sallmanaazor  a Native of the Island  Formosa  who came from thence to  London  above twenty Years ago and in Conversation told my Friend that in his Country when any young Person happened to be put to Death the Executioner sold the Carcass to  Persons of Quality  as a prime Dainty and that in his Time the Body of a plump Girl of fifteen who was crucified for an Attempt to poison the Emperor  was sold to his Imperial  Majesty's prime Minister of State  and other great  Mandarins  of the Court  in Joints from the Gibbet  at four hundred Crowns Neither indeed can I deny that if the same Use were made of several plump young Girls in this Town who without one single Groat to their Fortunes cannot stir abroad without a Chair and appear at a  Playhouse  and  Assemblies  in foreign Fineries which they never will pay for the Kingdom would not be the worse  Some Persons of a desponding Spirit are in great Concern about that vast Number of poor People who are Aged Diseased or Maimed and I have been desired to employ my Thoughts what Course may be taken to ease the Nation of so grievous an Incumbrance But I am not in the least Pain upon that Matter because it is very well known that they are every Day  dying  and  rotting  by  Cold  and  Famine  and  Filth  and  Vermin  as fast as can be reasonably expected And as to the young Labourers they are now in almost as hopeful a Condition They cannot get Work and consequently pine away for want of Nourishment to a degree that if at any Time they are accidentally hired to common Labour they have not Strength to perform it and thus the Country and themselves are happily delivered from the Evils to come  I have too long digressed and therefore shall return to my Subject I think the Advantages by the Proposal which I have made are obvious and many as well as of the highest Importance  For  First  as I have already observed it would  greatly lessen  the Number of Papists  with whom we are Yearly overrun being the principal Breeders of the Nation as well as our most dangerous Enemies and who stay at home on purpose with a Design  to deliver the Kingdom to the Pretender  hoping to take their Advantage by the Absence  of so many good Protestants  who have chosen rather to leave their Country than stay at home and pay Tithes against their Conscience to an  Episcopal Curate  Scecondly  The poorer Tenants will have something valuable of their own which by Law may be made liable to Distress and help to pay their Landlord's Rent their Corn and Cattle being already seized and  Money a thing unknown  Thirdly  Whereas the Maintainance of an hundred thousand Children from two Years old and upwards cannot be computed at less than Ten Shillings a piece  per Annum  the Nation's Stock will be thereby encreased fifty thousand Pounds  per Annum  besides the Profit of a new Dish introduced to the Tables of all  Gentlemen of Fortune  in the Kingdom who have any Refinement in Taste and the Money will circulate among our Selves the Goods being entirely of our own Growth and Manufacture  Fourthly  The constant Breeders besides the Gain of eight Shillings  Sterling per Annum  by the Sale of their Children will be rid of the Charge of maintaining them after the first Year  Fifthly  This Food would likewise bring great  Custom to Taverns  where the Vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best Receipts for dressing it to Perfection and consequently have their Houses frequented by all the fine  Gentlemen  who justly value themselves upon their Knowledge in good Eating and a skilful Cook who understands how to oblige his Guests will contrive to make it as expensive as they please  Sixthly  This would be a great Inducement to Marriage which all wise Nations have either encouraged by Rewards or enforced by Laws and Penalties It would encrease the Care and Tenderness of Mothers towards their Children when they were sure of a Settlement for Life to the poor Babes provided in some Sort by the Publick to their annual Profit instead of Expence we should soon see an honest Emulation among the married Women  which of them could bring the fattest Child to the Market  Men would become as  fond  of their Wives during the Time of their Pregnancy as they are now of their  Mares  in Foal their  Cows  in Calf or  Sows  when they are ready to farrow nor offer to beat or kick them as is too  frequent  a Practice for fear of a Miscarriage  Many other advantages might be enumerated For Instance the Addition of some thousand Carcasses in our exportation of Barrel'd Beef The Propagation of  Swines Flesh  and Improvement in the Art of making good  Bacon  so much wanted among us by the great Destruction of  Pigs  too frequent at our Tables which are no way comparable in  Taste or Magnificence to a well grown fat Yearly Child which roasted whole will make a considerable Figure at a  Lord Mayor's Feast  or any other Publick Entertainment But this and many others I omit being studious of Brevity  Supposing that one thousand Families in this City would be constant Customers for Infants Flesh besides others who might have it at  merry Meetings  particularly at  Weddings  and  Christenings  I compute that  Dublin  would take off Annually about twenty thousand Carcasses and the rest of the Kingdom where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper the remaining eighty Thousand  I can think of no one Objection that will possibly be raised against this Proposal unless it should be urged that the Number of People will be thereby much lessened in the Kingdom This I freely own and 'twas indeed one principal Design in offering it to the World I desire the Reader will observe that I calculate my Remedy  for this one individual Kingdom of  IRELAND  and for no Other that ever was is or I think ever can be upon Earth  Therefore let no Man talk to me of other Expedients  Of taxing our Absentees at five Shillings a Pound Of using neither Cloaths nor Houshold Furniture except what is of our own Growth and Manufacture Of utterly rejecting the Materials and Instruments that promote Foreign Luxury Of curing the Expensiveness of Pride Vanity Idleness and Gameing in our Women Of introducing a Vein of Parcimony Prudence and Temperance Of learning to love our Country wherein we differ even from  LAPLANDERS  and the Inhabitants of  TOPINAMBOO  Of quitting our Animosities and Factions nor act any longer like the  Jews  who were murdering one another at the very moment their City was taken Of being a little cautious not to sell our Country and Consciences for nothing Of teaching Landlords to have at least one Degree of Mercy towards their Tenants  Lastly  Of putting a Spirit of Honesty Industry and Skill into our Shopkeepers who if a Resolution could now be taken to buy only our Native Goods would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the Price the Measure and the Goodness nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair Proposal of just Dealing though often and earnestly invited to it  Therefore I repeat let no Man talk to me of these and the like Expedients 'till he hath at least some Glimpse of Hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere Attempt to put  them in Practice  But as to my self having been wearied out for many Years with offering vain idle visionary Thoughts and at length utterly desparing of Success I fortunately fell upon this Proposal which as it is wholly new so it hath something Solid and Real of no Expence and little Trouble full in our own Power and whereby we can incur no Danger in  disobliging  ENGLAND For this kind of Commodity will not bear Exportation the Flesh being of too tender a Consistence to admit a long Continuance in Salt  although perhaps I could name a Country which would be glad to eat up our whole Nation without it  After all I am not so violently bent upon my  own Opinion as to reject any Offer proposed by wise Men which shall be found equally innocent cheap easy and effectual But before something of that Kind shall be advanced in Contradiction to my Scheme and offering a better I desire the Author or Authors will be pleased maturely to consider two Points  First  As things now stand how they will be able to find Food and Raiment for a hundred Thousand useless Mouths and Backs And  Secondly  There being a round Million of Creatures in Humane Figure throughout this Kingdom whose whole subsistence put into a common Stock would leave them in Debt two Millions of Pounds  Sterling  adding those who are Beggars by Profession to the Bulk of Farmers Cottagers and Labourers with their Wives and Children who are Beggars in effect I desire those Politicians who dislike my Overture and may perhaps be so bold to attempt an Answer that they will first ask the Parents of these Mortals Whether they would not at this Day think it a great Happiness to have been sold for Food at a Year old in the manner I prescribe and thereby have avoided such a perpetual Scene of Misfortunes as they have since gone through by the  Oppression of Landlords  the Impossibility of paying Rent without Money or Trade the Want of common Sustenance with neither House nor Cloaths to cover them from the Inclemencies of the Weather and the most inevitable Prospect of intailing the like or greater Miseries upon their Breed for ever  I prosess in the Sincerity of my Heart that I have not the least Personal Interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary Work having no other  Motive than the  Publick Good of my Country by advancing our Trade providing for Infants relieving the Poor and giving some pleasure to the Rich  I have no Children by which I can propose to get a single Penny the youngest being nine Years Old and my Wife past Childboaring  A VINDICATION OF THE Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland  THE Lord  CARTERET  From the CHARGE of favouring  Tories HighChurchMen  and  Jacobites  IN order to treat this important Subject with the greatest Fairness and Impartiality perhaps it may be convenient to give some Account of his Excellency in whose Life and Character there are certain Particulars which might suggest a very just Suspicion of some Truth in the Accusation he lies under  He is descended from two noble ancient and most loyal Families the  Carterets  and the  Granvilles  too much distinguished I confess for  what they acted and what they suffered in defending the former Constitution in Church and State under King  Charles  the Martyr I mean that very Prince on Account of whose Martyrdom  a Form of Prayer with Fasting was enjoin'd by Act of Parliament to be used on the Thirtieth Day of  January  every Year to implore the Mercies of God that the Guilt of that sacred and innocent Blood  c  might not be visited on us or our Posterity  as we may read at large in our  CommonPrayerBooks  which Day hath been solemnly kept even within the Memory of many Men now alive  His Excellency the present Lord was educated in the University of  Oxford  from thence with a Singularity scarce to be justified he carried away more  Greek Latin  and Philosophy than properly became a Person of his Rank indeed much more of each than most of those who are forc'd to live by their Learning will be at the unnecessary Pains to load their Heads with  This was the Rock he split on upon his first Appearance in the World just got clear of his Guardians For as soon as he came to Town some Bishops and Clergymen and other Persons most eminent for Learning and Parts got him among them from whom though he were fortunately dragg'd by a Lady and the Court yet he could never wipe off the Stain nor wash out the Tincture of his University Acquirements and Disposition  To this another Missortune was added That it pleased God to endow him with great natural  Talents Memory Judgment Comprehension Eloquence and Wit and to finish the Work all these were fortify'd even in his Youth with the advantages received by such Employments as are best fitted both to exercise and polish the Gifts of Nature and Education having been Ambassador in several Courts when his Age would hardly allow him to take a Degree and made Principal Secretary of State at a Period when according to Custom he ought to have been busied in losing his Money at a Chocolatehouse or in other Amusements equally laudable and epidemick among Persons of Honour  I cannot omit another weak Side in his Excellency for it is known and can be proved upon him that  Greek  and  Latin  Books might be found every Day in his DressingRoom if it were carefully searched and there is Reason to suspect that some of the said Books have been privately convey'd to him by  Tory  Hands I am likewise assured that he hath been taken in the very Fact of reading the said Books even in the midst of a Session to the great Neglect of publick Affairs  I own there may be some Grounds for this Charge because I have it from good Hands that when his Excellency is at Dinner with one or two Scholars at his Elbows he grows a most insupportable and unintelligible Companion to all the sine Gentlemen round the table  I cannot deny that his Excellency lies under another great Disadvantage for besides all the Accomplishments abovementioned having that of a most comely and graceful Person he hath during the Prime of Youth Spirits and Vigour in  a most exemplary Manner led a regular domestick Life discover'd a great Esteem Friendship and Love for his Lady as well as a true Affection for his Children And when he is dispos'd to admit an entertaining Evening Companion he doth not always enough reflect whether the Person may possibly in former Days have lain under the Imputation of a  Tory  Nor at such Times do the natural or affected Fears of  Popery  and the  Pretender  make any Part of the Conversation I presume because neither  Homer Plato Aristotle  nor  Cicero  have made any mention of them  These I freely acknowledge to be his Excellency's Failings yet I think it is agreed by Philosophers and Divines that some Allowance ought to be given to human Infirmity and the Prejudices of a wrong Education  I am well aware how much my Sentiments differ from the orthodox Opinion of one or two principal Patriots for these have decided the Matter directly against me by declaring that no Person who was ever known to lie under the Suspicion of one single  Tory  Principle or who had been once seen at a great Man's Levee in the  worst of Times  should be allow'd to come within the Verge of the Castle much less to bow in the AntiChamber appear at the  Assemblies  or dance at a BirthNight However I dare assert that this Maxim hath been often controul'd and that on the contrary a considerable Number of  early Penitents  have been received into Grace who are now an  Ornament Happiness  and  Support  to the Nation  Neither do I find any Murmuring on some  other Points of greater Importance where this favourite Maxim is not so strictly observed  To instance only in one I have not heard that any Care hath hitherto been taken to discover whether  A famous Ropedancer  Madam  Violante  be a  Whig  or  Tory  in her Principles or even that she hath ever been  offer'd the Oaths to the Governmem t  on the contrary I am told that she openly professeth herself to be a  HighFlyer  and it is not improbable but by her  Outlandish  Name she may also be a  Papist  in her Heart Yet we see this illu strious and dangerous Female openly caress'd by principal Persons of both Parties who contribute to support her in a splendid Manner without the least Apprehensions from a  Grand Jury  And as  Hobbs  wisely observes  so much Money  being equivalent to  so much Power  it may deserve considering with what Safety such an Instrument of  Power  ought to be trusted in the Hands of an  Alien  who hath not given any legal Security for her good Affection to the Government  I confess there is one Evil which I could wish our Friends would think proper to redress There are many  Whigs  in this Kingdom of the  oldfashion'd Stamp  of whom we might make very good Use they bear the same Loyalty with us to the  Hanoverian  Family in the Person of King  George  the Second the same Abhorrence of the  Pretender  with the Consequents of  Popery  and Slavery and the same Indulgence to  tender Consciences  but having nothing to ask for themselves and consequently the more Leisure to think for the Publick they are often apt to entertain  Fears and melancholy Prospects concerning the State of their Country the Decay of Trade the Want of Money the miserable Condition of the People with other Topicks of like Nature all which do equally concern both  Whig  and  Tory  who if they have any Thing to lose must be equally Sufferers Perhaps one or two of these melanchly Gentlemen will sometimes venture to publish their Thoughts in Print Now I can by no Means approve our usual Custom of cursing and railing at this Species of Thinkers under the Names of  Tories Jacobites Papists Libellers Rebels  and the like  This was the utter Ruin of that poor angry bustling wellmeaning Mortal  Pistorides  who lies equally under the Contempt of both Parties with no other Difference than a Mixture of  Pity  on one Side and of  Aversion  on the other  How hath he been pelted pester'd and pounded by one single Wag who promiseth never to forsake him living or dead  I was much pleased with the Humour of a  Surgeon  in this Town who having in his own Apprehensions received some great Injustice from the Earl of  Galloway  and desparing of Revenge as well as Relief declared to all his Friends that he had set apart a hundred Guineas to purchase the Earl's Carcass from the Sexton whenever I T should die to make a Skeleton of the Bones stuff the Hide and shew them for three Pence and thus get Vengeance for the Injuries he had suffer'd by the owner  Of the like Spirit too often is that implacable Race of Wits against whom there is no Defence  but Innocence and Philosophy neither of which is likely to be at Hand and therefore the Wounded have no where to fly for a Cure but to downright Stupidity a crazed Head or a profligate Contempt of Guilt and Shame  I am therefore sorry for that other miserable Creature  L  d V  t  A  n who spoke against the Libel in the Privy Council and likewise in the House of Lords  Traulus  who altho' of somewhat a different Species yet seems very far to outdo even the Genius of  Pistorides  in that miscarrying Talent of Railing without Consistency or Discretion against the most innocent Persons according to the present Situation of his Gall and Spleen I do not blame an  honest  Gentleman for the bitterest Invectives against one to whom he professeth the greatest Friendship provided he acts in the Dark so as not to be discovered but in the midst of  Caresses Visits  and  Invitations  to run into the Streets or to  as publick a Place  and without the least pretended Incitement sputter out the basest and falsest Accusations then to wipe his Mouth come up smiling to his Friend shake him by the Hand and tell him in a Whisper it was  all for his Service  This Proceeding I am bold to think a great Failure in Prudence and I am afraid lest such a Practitioner with a Body so  open  so  foul  and  so full of Sores  may fall under the Resentmen of an incens'd political  Surgeon  who is not in much Renown for his Mercy upon great Provocation who without waiting for his Death will flay and dissect him alive and to the View of Mankind lay open all the disorder'd Cells of his Brain the Vonom of his Tongue the Corruption of his  Heart and Spots and Flatuses of his Spleenand all this for three Pence  In such a Case what a Scene would be laid open And to drop my Metaphor what a Character of our mistaken Friend might an angry Enemy draw and expose Particularizing that unnatural Conjunction of Vices and Follies so inconsistent with each other in the same Breast Furious and fawning scurrilous and flattering cowardly and provoking insolent and abject most profligately salse with the strongest Professions of Sincerity positive and variable tyrannical and slavish  In vain would his Excusers endeavour to palliate his Enormities by imputing them to Madness beause it is well knowm that Madness only operates by inflaming and enlarging the good or evil Dispositions of the Mind for the Curators of  Bedlam  assure us that some Lunaticks are Persons of  Honour Truth Benevolence  and many other Virtues which appear in their highest Ravings although after a wild incoherent Manner while others on the contrary discover in every Word and action the utmost  Baseness  and Depravity of human Minds which infallibly they possessed in the same Degree although perhaps under a better Regulation before their Entrance into that  Academy  But it may be objected that there is an Argument of much more Force to excuse the Overflowings of that zeal which our  Friend  shews or means for our Cause And it must be confessed that the  easy and smooth Fluency of his Elocution bestowed on him by Nature and cultivated by  continual Practice  added to the  Comelyness of his Person the Harmony of his Voice  the  Gracefulness of his Manner  and the  Decency of his Dress  are Temptations too strong for such a Genius to resist upon any publick Occasion of making them appear with  universal Applause  And if good Men are sometimes accused of loving their  Jest  better than their  Friend  surely to gain the Reputation of the first  Orator  in the Kingdom no Man of Spirit would scruple to lose all the  Friends  he had in the World  It is usual for Masters to make their Boys declaim on both Sides of an Argument and as some kinds of Assemblies are called the  Schools of Principles  I confess nothing can better improve political SchoolBoys than the Art of making plausible or implausible Harangues against the very Opinion for which they resolve to determine  So Cardinal  Perron  after having spoke for an Hour to the Admiration of all his Hearers to prove the Existence of God told some of his Intimates that he could have spoken another Hour and much better to prove the contrary  To return from this long Digression If Persons in high Sations have been allow'd to chuse Mistresses without Regard even to Difference in Religion yet never incurred the least Reflection on their Loyalty or their Protestantism shall the chief Govenour of a great Kingdom be censured for chusing a  Companion  who may formerly have been suspected for differing from the  Orthodox  in some speculative Opinions of Persons and Things which cannot  affect the fundamental Principles of a sound  Whig  But let me suppose a very possible Case Here is a Person sent to govern  Ireland  whose unfortunate weak Side it happens to be for several Reasons abovemention'd that he hath encouraged the Attendance of  one  or  two  Gentlemen distinguished for their Taste their Wit and their Learning who have taken the Oaths to his Majesty and pray heartily for him yet because they may perhaps be stigmatized as  quondam  Tories by  Pistorides  and his Gang his Excellency must be forced to banish them under the Pain and Peril of displeasing the Zealots of his own Party and thereby be put into a worse Condition than every common Goodfellow who may be a sincere  Protestant  and a loyal Subject and yet rather chuse to drink fine Ale at the  Pope  's  Head  than muddy at the  King  's  Let me then return to my Supposition It is certain the Highflown Loyalists in the  present  Sense of the Word have their Thoughts and Studies and Tongues so entirely diverted by political Schemes that the Zeal of their  Principles  hath  eaten up  their Understandings neither have they Time from their Employments their Hopes and their hourly Labours for acquiring new Additions of Merit to amuse themselves with philological Converse or Speculations which are utterly ruinous to all Schemes of rising in the World What must then a Great Man do whose ill Stars have fatally perverted him to a Love and Taste and Possession  of Literature Politeness and good Sense Our thoroughsped Republick of  Whigs  which contains the Bulk of all  Hopers Pretenders Expectors  and  Possessors  are beyond all Doubt most  highly useful  to Princes to Govenours to great Ministers and to their Country but at the same Time and by necessary Consequence the most disagreable Companions to all who have that unfortunate Turn of Mind peculiar to his Excellency and perhaps to five or six more in a Nation  I do not deny it possible that an Original or Proselyte Favourer of the Times might have been born to these useless Talents which in former Ages qualified a Man to be a Poet or a Philosopher All I contend for is that where the true Genius of Party once enters it  sweeps the House clean  and leaves Room for many  other Spirits  to take joint Possession 'till the  last State of that Man is exceedingly better than the first  I allow it a great Error in his Excellency that he adheres so obstinately to his old unfashionable academick Education Yet so perverse is human Nature that the usual Remedies for this Evil in others have produced a contrary Effect in him to a Degree that I am credibly informed he will as I have already hinted in the Middle of a Session quote Passages out of  Plato  and  Pindar  at his own Table to some  Booklearn'd  Companion without Blushing even when Persons of  great Stations  are by  I will venture one Step farther which is freely to confess that this mistaken Method of  educating Youth in the Knowledge of ancient Learning and Language is too apt to spoil their  Politicks  and  Principles  because the Doctrine and Examples of the Books they read teach them Lessons  directly contrary in every Point  to the  present Practice  of the World And accordingly  Hobbes  most judiciously observes that the Writings of the  Greeks  and  Romans  made young Men imbibe Opinions against  absolute Power  in a  Prince  or even in a first  Minister  and to embrace Notions of  Liberty  and  Property  It hath been therefore a great Felicity to these Kingdoms that the Heirs to Titles and large Estates have a Weakness in their Eyes and a Tenderness in their Constitutions are not able to bear the Pain and Indignity of Whipping and as the Mother rightly expresses it could never take to their Books yet are well enough qualified to sign a Receipt for half a Year's Rent to put their Name  rightly spelt  to a Warrant and to read Pamphlets against  Religion  and  HighFlying  whereby they fill their Niches and carry themselves through the World with that Dignity which best becomes a Senator and a  Squire  I could heartily wish his Excellency would be more condescending to the  Genius  of the Kingdom he Governs to the Condition of the Times and to the Nature of the Station he sills Yet if it be true what I have read in old  English  StoryBooks that one  Agesilaus  no Matter to the Bulk of my Readers whether I spell the Name right or wrong was caught by the  Parson  of the Parish  riding on a HobbyHorse with his Children that  Socrates  a  Heathen  Philosopher was found dancing by himself at Fourscore that a King called  Caesar Augustus  or some such Name used to play with Boys whereof some might possibly be Sons of  Tories  and two great Men called  Scipio  and  Laelius  I forget their  Christian  Names and whether they were Poets or Generals often play'd at Duck and Drake with smooth Stones on a River Now I say if these Facts be true and the Book where I found them is in Print I cannot imagine why our most zealous Patriots may not a little indulge his Excellency in an Infirmity which is not mortally Evil provided he gives no publick Scandal which is by all Means to be avoided I say why he may not be indulged twice a Week to converse with one or two particular Persons and let him and them conn over their old  exploded  Readings together after Mornings spent in hearing and prescribing Ways and Means from and to his  most obedient  Politicians for the Welfare of the Kingdom although the said particular Person or Persons may not have made so publick a Declaration of their political Faith in all its Parts as the Business of the Nation requires still submitting my Opinion to that  happy Majority  which I am confident is  always in the right  by whom the  Liberty  of the Subject hath been so frequently so strenuously and so successfully asserted who by their wise Councils have made  Commerce  to flourish  Money  to abound  Inhabitants  to increase  the  Value  of  Lands  and  Rents  to rise and the whole Island put on a new Face of  Plenty  and Prosperity  But in order to clear his Excellency more fully from this Accusation of shewing his Favours to  Highflyers Tories  and  Jacobites  it will be necessary to come to Particulars  The first Person of a  Tory  Denomination to whom his Excellency gave any Marks of his Favour was Doctor  Thomas Sheridan  It is to be observed that this happened so early in his Exellency's Government as it may be justly supposed he had not been informed of that Gentleman's Character upon so  dangerous  an Article The Doctor being well known and distinguish'd for his Skill and Success in the Education of Youth beyond most of his Profession for many Years past was recommended to his Excellency on the Score of his Learning and particularly for his Knowledge in the  Greek  Tongue whereof it seems his Excellency is a great Admirer although for what Reasons I could never imagine However it is agreed on all Hands that his Lordship was too easily prevail'd on by the Doctor's Request or indeed rather from the Biass of his own Nature to hear a Tragedy acted in that  unknown  Language by the Doctor's Lads which was written by some  Heathen  Author but whether it contained any  Tory  or  HighChurch  Principles must be left to the Consciences of the  Boys  the  Doctor  and his Excellency the only Witnesses in this Case whose Testimonies can be depended upon  It seems his Excellency a Thing never to be sufficiently wonder'd at was so pleas'd with his entertainment that some Time after he gave the Doctor a Church Living to the Value almost of one Hundred Pounds a Year and made him one of his Chaplains from an  antiquated  Notion that good Schoolmasters ought to be encouraged in every Nation professing Civility and Religion Yet his Excellency did not venture to make this bold Step without strong Recommendations from Persons of undoubted Principles  fitted to the Times  who thought themselves bound in Justice Honour and Gratitude to do the Doctor a good Office in Return for the Care he had taken of their Children or those of their Friends Yet the Catastrophe was terrible for the Doctor in the Height of his Felicity and Gratitude going down to take Possession of his Parish and furnished with a few led Sermons whereof as it is to be supposed the Number was very small having never served a Cure in the Church he stopp'd at  Cork  to attend on his Bishop and going to Church on the  Sunday  following was according to the usual Civility of Country Clergymen invited by the Minister of the Parish to supply the Pulpit It happened to be the first of  August  and the first of  August  happened that Year to light upon a  Sunday  And it happened that the Doctor's Text was in these Words  Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof  And lastly it happened that some one Person of the Congregation whose Loyalty  made him watchful upon every Appearance of Danger to his Majesty's Person and Government when Service was over gave the Alarm Notice was immediately sent up to Town and by the Zeal of one Man of no large Dimensions of Body or Mind such a clamour was raised that we in  Dublin  could apprehend no less than an Invasion by the  Pretender  who must be landed in the South The Result was that the Doctor must be struck out of the Chaplains List and appear no more at the Castle Yet whether he were then or be at this Day a  Whig  or a  Tory  I think is a Secret only it is manifest that he is a zealous  Hanoverian  at least in Poetry and a great Adorer of the present Royal Family thro' all its Branches his Friends likewise assert that he had preached this same Sermon often under the same Text that not having observed the Words 'till he was in the Pulpit and had opened his Notes as he is a Person a little abstracted he wanted Presence of Mind to change them And that in the whole Sermon there was not a Syllable relating to Government or Party or to the Subject of the Day  In this Incident there seems to have been an Union of Events that will probably never happen again to the End of the World or at least like the grand Conjunction in the Heavens which I think they say can arrive but once in twenty Thousand Years  The second Gentleman if I am right in my Chronology who under the Suspicion of a  Tory  received some Favour from his Excellency is Mr  James Stopford  very strongly recommended by the most eminent  Whig  in  England  on the Account of his Learning and Virtue and other Accomplishments He had pass'd the greatest Part of his Youth in close Study or in travelling and was either not at Home or not at Leisure to trouble his Thoughts about Party which I allow to be a great Omission tho' I cannot honestly place him in the List of  Tories  and therefore think his Excellency may be fairly acquitted for making him Vicar of  Finglass  worth about one Hundred and fifty Pounds a Year  The third is Doctor  Patrick Delany  this Divine lies under some Disadvantage having in his Youth received many Civilities from a certain Person  Sir  Constantine Phipps  Lord Chancellor of Ireland when Queen  Anne  died  then in a very high Station here for which Reason I doubt the Doctor never  drunk his Confusion  since and what makes the Matter desperate it is now too late unless our Inquisitors will be content with drinking  Confusion  to his  Memory  The aforesaid eminent Person who was a Judge of all Merit but  Party  distinguished the Doctor among other Juniors in our University for his Learning Virtue Discretion and good Sense but the Doctor was then in too good a Situation at his College to hope or endeavour at a better Establishment from one who had no Power to give it him  Upon the present Lord Lieutenant's coming over the Doctor was named to his Exdellency by a Friend among other Clergymen of Distinction as Persons whose Characters it was proper his Excellency should know And by the Truth of which the Giver would be content to stand or fall in his Excellency's Opinion since not one of those Persons were in particular Friendship with the Gentlemen who gave in their Names By this and some other Incidents particularly the Recommendation of the late Archbishop of  Dublin  the Doctor became known to his Excellency whose fatal Turn of Mind towards  heathenish  and  outlandish  Books and Languages finding as I conceive a like Disposition in the Doctor was the Cause of his becoming so domestick as we are told he is at the Castle of  Dublin  Three or four Years ago the Doctor grown weary of an Academick Life for some Reasons best known to the Managers of the Discipline in that learned Society which it may not be for their Honour to mention resolved to leave it although by the Benefit of his Pupils and his Seniorfellowship with all its Perquisites he received every Year between nine Hundred and a Thousand Pounds And a small Northern Living in the University's Donation of somewhat better than a hundred Pounds a Year falling at the same Time with the Chancellorship of  ChristChurch  to about equal Value in the Gist of his Excellency the Doctor ventured into the World in a very scanty Condition having  squander'd away all his annual Income in a manner which although perhaps proper enough for a Clergyman without a Family will not be for the Advantage of his Character to discover either on the  Exchange  or at a Banker's Shop  About two Months ago his Excellency gave the Doctor a Prebend in St  Patrick  's Cathedral which being of near the same Value with either of the two former will add a third Part to his Revenues after he shall have paid the great Incumbrances upon it so that he may now be said to possess of Church Preserments in scattered Tythes three hundred Pounds a Year instead of the like Sum of infallible Rents from a senior Fellowship with the Offices annexed besides the Advantage of a free Lodging and some other Easements But since the Doctor hath not in any of his Writings his Sermons his Actions his Discourse or his Company discovered one single Principle of either  Whig  or  Tory  and that the Lord Lieutenant still continues to admit him I shall boldly pronounce him  one of us  but like a new  FreeMason  who hath not yet learned all the Dialect of the Mystery Neither can he justly be accused of any  Tory  Doctrines except perhaps some among those few with which that  wicked Party  was charged during the Height of their Power but have been since transferred for the most  solid Reasons  to the  whole Body  of our firmest Friends I have now done with the Clergy and upon the strictest Examination  have not been able to find above one of that Order against whom any  Party  Suspicion can lie which is the unfortunate Gentleman Dr  Sheridan  who by mere Chancemedly shot his own Fortune dead with a single Text  As to the Laity I can hear of but one Person of the  Tory  Stamp who since the Beginning of his Excellency's Government did ever receive any solid Mark of his Favour I mean Sir  Arthur Acheson  reported to be an acknowledged  Tory  and what is almost as bad a  Scholar  into the Bargain It is whisper'd about as a certain Truth that this Gentleman is to have a Grant of a certain Barrack upon his Estate within two Miles of his own House for which the Crown is to be his Tenant at the Rent of sixty Pounds  per Annum  he being only at the Expence of about  five hundred  Pounds to put the House in Repair build Stables and other Necessaries I will place this  invidious  Mark of Beneficence conferred on a  Tory  in a fair Light by computing the Costs and necessary Defalcations after which it may be seen how much  Sir Arthur  will be annually a clear Gainer by the Publick notwithstanding his  unfortunate  Principles and his Knowledge in  Greek  and  Latin     l  s  d  For Repairs  c    l  the Interest whereof  per Ann        For all Manner of Poultry to furnish the Troopers but which the said Troopers must be at the Labour of catching valued  per Ann        For straggling Sheep        For Game destroyed five miles round                 Rent paid to Sir  Arthur        Deduct        Remains clear        Thus if Sir  Arthur Acheson  shall have the good Fortune to obtain a Grant of this Barrack he will receive neat Profit annually from the Crown Eleven Pounds  Sterling  to help him in entertaining the Officers and making Provision for his younger Children  It is true there is another Advantage to be expected which may fully compensate the Loss of Cattle and Poultry by multiplying the Breed of Mankind and particularly of  good Protestants  in a Part of the Kingdom half depopulated by the wild Humour among the Farmers thereof leaving their Country But I am not so skilful in Arithmetick as to compute the Value  I have reckoned one  per Cent  below the legal Interest for the Money that Sir  Arthur  must expend And valued the Damage in the other Articles very moderately However I am confident he may with good Management be a  Saver  at least which is a  prodigious Instance of Moderation  in our Friends towards a professed  Tory  whatever Merit he may pretend by the Unwillingness he hath shewn to make his Excellency uneasy in his Administration  Thus I have with the utmost Impartiality collected every single Favour further than personal Civilities conferred by his Excellency on  Tories  and reputed  Tories  since his first Arrival hither to this present th Day of  April  in the Year of our Lord giving all Allowance possible to the Arguments on the other Side of the Question  And the Account will stand thus  Disposed of Preferments and Employments to  Tories  or reputed  Tories  by his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant in about the Space of six Years           To Doctor  Thomas Sheridan  in a Rectory near  Kinsale per Ann        To Sir  Arthur Acheson  Baronet a Barrack  per Ann                 Give me Leave now to compute in Gross the  Value of the Favours done by his Excellency to the  true Friends  of their King and Country and of the  Protestant Religion  It is to be remembered that although his Excellency cannot be properly said to bestow Bishopricks Commands in the Army the Place of a Judge or Commissioner in the Revenue and some others yet they are for the most Part disposed upon his Recommendation except where the Persons are immediately sent from  England  by their Interest at Court for which I have allowed large Defalcations in the following Accounts And it is remarkable that the  only  considerable Station conferred on a reputed  Tory  since his present Excellency's Government was of this  latter  Kind  And indeed it is but too remarkable that in a neighbouring Nation where that dangerous Denomination of Men is incomparably more numerous more powerful and of Consequence more formidable  real Tories  can often with much less Difficulty obtain very high Favours from the Government than their  reputed  Brethren can arrive to the lowest in ours I observe this with all possible Submission to the Wisdom of their Policy which however will not I believe dispute the Praise of Vigilance with ours  WHIG Account  To Persons promoted to Bishopricks or removed to more beneficial Ones computed  per Ann        To Civil Employments        To Military Commands                 TORY Account  To  Tories        Balance        I shall conclude with this Observation that as I think the  Tories  have sufficient Reason to be  fully satisfied  with the Share of  Trust  and  Power  and  Employments  which they possess under the  Lenity  of the present Goverment so I do not find how his Excellency can be justly censured for favouring none but  HighChurch Highflyers Termagants Laudists Sacheverellians Tiptopgallonmen Jacobites Tantivyes AntiHannoverians Friends to Popery and the Pretender and to Arbitrary Power Disobligers of  England  Breakers of  DEPENDENCY  Inflamers of Quarrels between the two Nations Publick Incendiaries Enemies to the King and Kingdoms Haters of  TRUE  Protestants Lawrelmen Annists Complainers of the Nation's Poverty Ormondians Iconoclasts AntiGloriousMemorists Whiterosalists TenthaJunians  and the like When by a fair State of the Account the Balance I conceive plainly lies on the other Side  AN ESSAY ON THE Fates of CLERGYMEN  THere is no  Talent  so useful towards rising in the World or which puts Men more out of the Reach of Fortune than that Quality generally possessed by the dullest Sort of People and is in common Speech called  Discretion  a Species of lower Prudence by the Assistance of which People of the meanest Intellectuals without any other Qualification pass through the World in great Tranquility and with universal good Treatment neither giving nor taking Offence  Courts  are seldom unprovided of Persons under this Character on whom if they happen to be of great Quality most Employments even the Greatest naturally fall when Competitors will not agree and in such Promotions no Body rejoices or grieves The Truth of this I could prove by several Instances within my own Memory for I say nothing of the present Times  And indeed as Regularity and Forms are of great Use in carrying on the Business of the World so it is very convenient that Persons endued with this Kind of Discretion should have that Share which is proper to their Talents in the Conduct of Affairs but by no means to meddle in Matters which require  Genius Learning strong Comprehension Quickness of Conception Magnanimity Generosity Sagacity  or any other superior Gift of human Minds Because this sort of  Discretion  is usually attended with a strong Desire of Money and few Scruples about the Way of obtaining it with servile Flattery and Submission with a Want of all publick Spirit or Principle with a perpetual wrong Judgment when the Owners come into Power and high Place how to dispose of Favour and Preferment having no Measure for Merit and Virtue in others but those very Steps by which themselves ascended nor the least Intention of doing Good or Hurt to the Publick farther than either one or t'other is likely to be subservient to their own Security or Interest Thus being void of all Friendship and Enmity they never complain nor find Fault with the Times and indeed never have Reason to do so  Men of eminent Parts and Abilities as well as Virtues do sometimes rise in the  Courts  sometimes in the  Law  and sometimes even in the  Church  Such were the Lord  Bacon  the Earl of  Strafford  Archbishop  Laud  in the Reign of King  Charles  I and others in our own Times whom I shall not name but these and  many more under different Princes and in different Kingdoms were  Disgraced  or  Banished  or  suffered Death  merely in Envy to their Virtues and superior  Genius  which emboldened them in great Exigencies and Distresses of State wanting a reasonable Infusion of this Aldermanly Discretion to attempt the Service of their Prince and Country out of the common Forms  This evil Fortune which generally attends extraordinary Men in the Management of great Affairs hath been imputed to divers Causes that need not be here set down when so obvious an One occurs if what a certain Writer observes be true that  when a great Genius appears in the World the Dunces are all in Confederacy against him  And thus although he employs his  Talents  wholly in his Closet without interfering with any Man's Ambition or Avarice what must he expect when he ventures out to seek for Preferment in a Court but universal Opposition when he is mounting the Ladder and every Hand ready to turn him off when he is at the Top And in this Point Fortune generally acts directly contrary to Nature for in Nature we find that Bodies full of Life and Spirits mount easily and are hard to fall whereas heavy Bodies are hard to rise and come down with greater Velocity in Proportion to their Weight but we find Fortune every day acting just the Reverse of this  This Talent of  Discretion  as I have described it in its several Adjuncts and Circumstances is no where so serviceable as to the  Clergy  to whose Preserment nothing is so fatal as the  Character of Wit Politeness in Reading or Manners or that Kind of Behaviour which we contract by having too much conversed with Persons of high Stations and Eminency these Qualifications being reckoned by the  Vulgar  of  all Ranks  to be Marks of  Levity  which is the last Crime the World will pardon in a  Clergyman  To this I may add a free Manner of Speaking in mixt Company and too frequent an Appearance in Places of much Resort which are equally noxious to spiritual Promotions  I have known indeed a few Exceptions to some Parts of these Regulations I have seen some of the dullest Men alive aiming at Wit and others with as little Pretensions affecting Politeness in Manners and Discourse but never being able to persuade the World of their Guilt they grew into considerable Stations upon the firm Assurance which all People had of their  Discretion  because they were a Size too low to deceive the World to their own Disadvantage But this I confess is a Tryal too dangerous often to engage in  There is a known Story of a  Clergyman  who was recommended for a Preferment by some great Men at Court to an Archbishop His Grace said he had heard that the  Clergyman  used to play at Whisk and Swobbers that as to playing now and then a sober Game at Whisk for Pastime it might be pardoned but he could not digest those wicked Swobbers and it was with some Pains that my Lord  S  rs  could undeceive him I ask by what Talents we may suppose that great Prelate ascend so  high or what sort of Qualifications he would expect in those whom he took into his Patronage or would probably recommend to Court for the Government of  Distant Churches  Two  Clergymen  in my Memory stood Candidates for a small  FreeSchool  in  Shire  where a Gentleman of Quality and Interest in the Country who happened to have a better Understanding than his Neighbours procured the Place for him who was the better Scholar and more gentlemanly Person of the two very much to the Regret of all the Parish the other being disappointed came up to  London  where he became the greatest Pattern of this lower  Discretion  that I have known and possessed with as heavy Intellectuals which together with the Coldness of his Temper and Gravity of his Deportment carried him safe through many Difficulties and he lived and died in a great Station while his Competitor is too obscure for Fame to tell us what become of him  This Species of  Discretion  which I so much celebrate and do most heartily recommend hath one Advantage not yet mentioned that it will carry a Man safe through all the Malice and Variety of Parties so far that whatever Faction happens to be uppermost his Claim is usually allowed for a Share of what is going And the Thing seems to me highly reasonable For in all great Changes the prevailing Side is usually so tempestuous that it wants the Ballast of those whom the World calls  Moderate Men  and I call  Men of Discretion  whom People in  Power may with little Ceremony load as heavy as they please drive them through the hardest and deepest Roads without Danger of found'ring or breaking their Backs and will be sure to find them neither rusty nor vicious  I will here give the Reader a short History of two  Clergymen  in  England  the Characters of each and the Progress of their Fortunes in the World by which the Force of worldly Discretion and the bad Consequences from the Want of that Virtue will strongly appear  Corusodes  an  Oxford  Student and a Farmer's Son was never absent from Prayers or Lecture nor once out of his  College  after  Tom  had toll'd He spent every Day ten Hours in his Closet in reading his Courses Dozing clipping Papers or darning his Stockings which last he performed to Admiration He could be soberly drunk at the Expence of others with  College  Ale and at those Seasons was always most devout He wore the same Gown five Years without dragling or tearing He never once look'd into a Playbook or a Poem He read  Virgil  and  Ramus  in the same Cadence but with a very different Taste He never understood a Jest or had the least Conception of Wit  For one Saying he stands in Renown to this Day Being with some other Students over a Pot of Ale one of the Company said so many pleasant Things that the rest were much diverted only  Corusodes  was silent and unmoved When they parted he called this merry Companion  aside and said  Sir I preceive by your often speaking and our Friends Laughing that you spoke many Jests and you could not but observe my Silence But Sir this is my Homour I never make a Jest myself nor ever laugh at another Man's  Corusodes  thus endowed got into Holy Orders having by the most extreme Parsimony saved thirty four Pounds out of a very beggarly Fellowship went up to  London  where his Sister was waiting Woman to a Lady and so good a Sollicitor that by her Means he was admitted to read Prayers in the Family twice a Day at fourteen Shillings a Month He had now acquired a low obsequious awkward Bow and a Talent of gross Flattery both in and out of Season he would shake the Butler by the Hand he taught the Page his  Catechism  and was sometimes admitted to dine at the Steward's Table In short he got the good Word of the whole Family and was recommended by my Lady for Chaplain to some other Noble House by which his Revenue beside Vales amounted to about thirty Pounds a Year his Sister procured him a Scarf from my Lord who had a small Design of Gallantry upon her and by his Lordship's Sollicitation he got a Lectureship in Town of sixty Pounds a Year where he preached constantly in Person in a grave Manner with an audible Voice a Style Ecclesiastick and the Matter such as it was well suited to the Intellectuals of his Hearers Some time after a Country Living fell in my Lord's Disposal and his Lordship who had  now some Encouragement given him of Success in his Amour bestow'd the Living on  Corusodes  who still kept his Lectureship and Residence in Town where he was a constant Attendant at all Meetings relating to Charity without ever contributing further than his frequent pious Exhortations If any Women of better Fashion in the Parish happened to be absent from Church they were sure of a Visit from him in a Day or two to chide and to dine with them  He had a select Number of Poor constantly attending at the Street Door of his Lodgings for whom he was a common Sollicitor to his former Patroness dropping in his own HalfCrown among the Collections and taking it out when he disposed of the Money At a Person of Quality's House he would never sit down 'till he was thrice bid and then upon the Corner of the most distant Chair His whole Demeanor was formal and starched which adhered so close that he could never Shake it off in his highest Promotion  His Lord was now in high Employment at Court and attended by him with the most abject Assiduity and his Sister being gone off with Child to a private Lodging my Lord continued his Graces to  Corusodes  got him to be a Chaplain in Ordinary and in due Time a Parish in Town and a  Dignity in the Church  He paid his  Curates  punctually at the lowest Sallary and partly out of the CommunionMoney but gave them good Advice in Abundance He married a Citizen's Widow who  taught him to put out small Sums at  Ten per Cent  and brought him acquainted with Jobbers in  ChangeAlley  By her Dexterity he sold the Clarkship of his Parish when it became vacant  He kept a miserable House but the Blame was laid wholly upon  Madam  for the good Doctor was always at his  Books  or visiting the Sick or doing other Offices of Charity and Piety in his Parish  He treated all his Inferiors of the Clergy with a most sanctified Pride was rigorously and universally censorious upon all his Brethren of the Gown on their first Appearance in the World or while they continued meanly preferred but gave large Allowance to the Laiety of high Rank or great Riches using neither Eyes nor Ears for their Faults He was never sensible of the least Corruption in  Courts Parliaments  or  Ministries  but made the most favourable Constructions of all publick Proceedings and Power in whatever Hands or whatever Party was always secure of his most charitable Opinion He had many wholesome Maxims ready to excuse all Miscarriages of State  Men are but Men Erunt vitia donee homines  and  Quod supra nos nil ad nos  with several others of equal Weight  It would lengthen my Paper beyond Measure to trace out the whole System of his Conduct his dreadful Apprehensions of  Popery  his great Moderation towards Dissenters of all Denominations with hearty Wishes that by yielding somewhat on both Sides there might  be a general Union among Protestants his short inoffensive Sermons in his Turns at Court and the Matter exactly suited to the present Juncture of prevailing Opinions The Arts he used to obtain a Mitre by writing against Episcopacy and the Proofs he gave of his Loyalty by palliating or defending the Murder of a martyr'd Prince  Endowed with all these Accomplishments we leave him in the full Career of Success mounting fast towards the Top of the Ladder Ecclesiastical which he hath a fair Probability to reach without the Merit of one single Virtue moderately stocked with the least valuable Parts of Erudition utterly devoid of all  Taste Judgment  or  Genius  and in his Grandeur naturally chusing to hawl up others after him whose Accomplishments most resemble his own except his beloved Sons Nephews or other Kindred be not in Competition or lastly except his Inclinations be diverted by those who have Power to mortify or further advance him  Eugenio  set out from the same University and about the same Time with  Corusodes  he had the Reputation of an arch Lad at School and was unfortunately possessed with a  Talent  for  Poetry  on which Account he received many chiding Letters from his Father and grave Advice from his Tutor He did not neglect his College Learning but his chief Study was the Authors of Antiquity with a perfect Knowledge in the  Greek  and  Roman Tongues  He could never procure himself to be chosen Fellow for it was objected against him that he  had written Verses and particularly some wherein he glanced at a certain Reverend Doctor famous for Dulness That he had been seen bowing to Ladies as he met them in the Streets and it was proved that once he had been found dancing in a private Family with half a dozen of both Sexes  He was the younger Son to a Gentleman of a good Birth but small Fortune and his Father dying he was driven to  London  to seek his Fortune He got into Orders and became Reader in a ParishChurch at twenty Pounds a Year was carried by an  Oxford  Friend to  Will  's  CoffeeHouse  frequented in those Days by Men of Wit where in some Time he had the bad Luck to be distinguished His scanty Sallery compelled him to run deep in Debt for a new Gown and Cassock and now and then forced him to write some Paper of Wit or Humour or preach a Sermon for ten Shillings to supply his Necessities He was a thousand Times récommended by his Poetical Friends to great Persons as a young Man of excellent Parts who deserved Encouragement and received a thousand Promises but his Modesty and a generous Spirit which disdained the Slavery of continual Application and Attendance always disappointed him making room for vigilant Dunces who were sure to be never out of Sight  He had an excellent Faculty in preaching if he were not sometimes a little too refined and apt to trust too much to his own Way of thinking and reasoning  When upon the Vacancy of Preferment he was hardly drawn to attend upon some promising Lord he received the usual Answer that he came too late for it had been given to another the very Day before And he had only this Comfort left that every Body said it was a thousand Pities something could not be done for poor Mr  Eugenio  The Remainder of his Story will be dispatched in a few Words Wearied with weak Hopes and weaker Pursuits he accepted a Curacy in  Derbyshire  of thirty Pounds a Year and when he was five and forty had the great Felicity to be prefered by a Friend of his Father's to a Vicaridge worth annually sixty Pound in the most desert Parts of  Lincolnshire  where his Spirit quite sunk with those Reflections that Solitude and Disappointments bring he married a Farmer's Widow and is still alive utterly undistinguished and forgotten only some of the Neighbours have accidentally heard  that he had been a notable Man in his Youth  AN ESSAY ON  Modern Education  FROM frequently reflecting upon the Course and Method of educating Youth in this and a neighbouring Kingdom with the general Success and Consequence thereof I am come to this Determination That Education is always the  worse  in Proportion to the  Wealth  and  Grandeur  of the Parents nor do I doubt in the least that if the whole World were now under the Dominion of  one Monarch  provided I might be allowed to chuse  where  he should fix the Seat of his Empire the only Son and Heir of that Monarch would be the worst educated Mortal that ever was born since the Creation and I doubt the same Proportion will hold through all Degrees and Titles from an Emperor downwards to the common Gentry  I do not say that this hath been always the Case for in better Times it was directly otherwise and a Scholar may fill half his  Greek  and  Roman  Shelves with Authors of the noblest Birth as well as highest Virtue Nor do I tax all Nations at present with this Defect for I know there are some to be excepted and particularly  Scotland  under all the Disadvantages of its Climate and Soil if that Happiness be not rather owing even to those very Disadvantages What is then to be done if this Reflection must fix on two Countries which will be most ready to take Offence and which of all others it will be least prudent or safe to offend  But there is one Circumstance yet more dangerous and lamentable For if according to the  Postulatum  already laid down the highest Quality any Youth is of he is in greater Likelyhood to be worse educated it behoves me to dread and keep far from the Verge of  Scandalum Magnatum  Retracting therefore that hazardous  Postulatum  I shall venture no further at present than to say that perhaps some additional Care in educating the Sons of Nobility and principal Gentry might not be ill employed If this be not delivered with Softness enough I must for the future be silent  In the mean Time let me ask only two Questions which relate to  England  I ask first how it comes about that for above sixty Years past the chief Conduct of Affairs hath been generally placed in the Hands of  Newmen  with very few Exceptions The Noblest Blood of  England  having been shed in the grand Rebellion many great Families became extinct or supported only by Minors When the King  was restored very few of those Lords remained who began or at least had improved their Education under the happy Reign of King  James  or King  Charles  I of which Lords the two principal were the Marquis of  Ormond  and the Earl of  Southampton  The Minors have or had during the Rebellion and Usurpation either received too much Tincture of bad Principles from those fanatick Times or coming to Age at the Restoration fell into the Vices of that dissolute Reign  I date from this Aera the corrupt Method of Education among us and the Consequence thereof in the Necessity the Crown lay under of introducing  Newmen  into the chief Conduct of publick Affairs or to the Office of what we now call Prime Ministers Men of Art Knowledge Application and Insinuation merely for Want of a Supply among the Nobility They were generally though not always of good Birth sometimes younger Brothers at other Times such who although inheriting good Estates yet happened to be well educated and provided with Learning such under that King were  Hyde Bridgeman Clifford Osborn Godolphin AshleyCooper  Few or none under the short Reign of King  James  II Under King  William Sommers Mountague Churchil Vernon Boyle  and many others Under the Queen  Harley St John Harcourt Trevor  who indeed were Persons of the best private Families but unadorn'd with Titles So in the following Reign Mr  Robert Walpole  was for many Years Prime Minister in which  Post he still happily continues His Brother  Horace  is Ambassador Extraordinary to  France  Mr  Addison  and Mr  Craggs  without the least Allowance to support them have been Secretaries of State  If the Facts have been thus for above sixty Years past whereof I could with a little further Recollection produce many more Instances I would ask again how it hath happened that in a Nation plentifully abounding with Nobility so great Share in the most competent Parts of publick Management hath been for so long a Period chiefly entrusted to Commoners unless some Omissions or Defects of the highest Import may be charged upon those to whom the Care of educating our Noble Youth had been committed For if there be any Difference between human Creatures in the Point of natural Parts as we usually call them it should seem that the Advantage lies on the Side of Children born from noble and wealthy Parents the same traditional Sloth and Luxury which render their Body weak and effeminate perhaps refining and giving a freer Motion to the Spirits beyond what can be expected from the gross robust Issue of meaner Mortals Add to this the peculiar Advantages which all young Noblemen possess by the Privileges of their Birth Such as a free Access to Courts and a universal deference paid to their Persons  But as my Lord  Bacon  chargeth it for a Fault on Princes that they are impatient to compass  Ends  without giving themselves the Trouble of consulting or executing the  Means  So perhaps it may be the Disposition of young Nobles either from the Indulgence of Parents Tutors and Governors or their own Inactivity that they expect the  Accomplishments  of a good Education without the least Expence of  Time  or  Study  to acquire them  What I said last I am ready to retract for the Case is infinitely worse and the very Maxims set up to direct modern Education are enough to destroy all the Seeds of Knowledge Honour Wisdom and Virtue among us The current Opinion prevails that the Study of  Greek  and  Latin  is Loss of Time that publick Schools by mingling the Sons of Noblemen with those of the Vulgar engage the former in bad Company that Whipping breaks the Spirits of Lads well born that Universities make young Men Pedants that to dance fence speak  French  and know how to behave yourself among great Persons of both Sexes comprehends  the whole Duty of a Gentleman  I cannot but think this wise System of Education hath been much cultivated among us by those Worthies of the Army who during the last War returning from  Flanders  at the Close of each Campaign became the Dictators of Behaviour Dress and Politeness to all those Youngsters who frequent ChocolateCoffeeGamingHouses DrawingRooms Opera's Levees and Assemblies where a Colonel by his Pay Perquisites and Plunder was qualified to outshine many Peers of the Realm and by the Influence of an  exotick  Habit and Demeanor added to other foreign Accomplishments  gave the Law to the whole Town and was copyed as the StandardPattern of whatever was refined in Dress Equipage Conversation or Diversions  I remember in those Times an admired Original of that Vocation sitting in a Coffeehouse near two Gentlemen whereof one was of the Clergy who were engaged in some Discourse that savoured of Learning this Officer thought fit to interpose and professing to deliver the Sentiments of his Fraternity as well as his own and probably did so of too many among them turning to the ClergyMan spoke in the following Manner  D  n me Doctor say what you will the Army is the only School for Gentlemen Do you think my Lord  Marlborough  beat the  French  with  Greek  and  Latin  D  n me a Scholar when he comes into good Company what is he but an Ass D  n me I would be glad by Gd to see any of your Scholars with his Nouns and his Verbs and his Philosophy and Trigonometry what a Figure he would make at a Siege or Blockade or rencountringD  n me  c After which he proceeded with a Volley of Military Terms less significant sounding worse and harder to be understood than any that were ever coined by the Commentators upon  Aristotle  I would not here be thought to charge the Soldiery with Ignorance and Contempt of Learning without allowing Exceptions of which I have known many but however the worse Example especially in a great Majority will certainly prevail  I have heard that the late Earl of  Oxford  in the Time of his Ministry never pass'd by  White  's  ChocolateHouse  the common Rendezvous of infamous Sharpers and Noble Cullies without bestowing a Curse upon that famous Academy as the Bane of half the  English Nobility  I have likewise been told another Passage concerning that great Minister which because it gives a humorous Idea of one principal Ingredient in modern Education take as followeth  Le Sack  the famous  French  Dancingmaster in great Admiration asked a Friend whether it were true that Mr  Harley  was made an Earl and Lord Treasurer And finding it confirmed said  Well I wonder what the Devil the Queen could see in him for I attended him two Years and he was the greatest Dunce that ever I taught  Another Hindrance to good Education and I think the greatest of any is that pernicious Custom in rich and noble Families of entertaining  French  Tutors in their Houses These wretched  Pedagogues  are enjoyned by the Father to take special Care that the Boy shall be perfect in his  French  by the Mother that  Master  must not walk 'till he is hot nor be suffered to play with other Boys nor be wet in his Feet nor daub his Cloaths and to see the Dancingmaster attends constantly and does his Duty she further insists that the Child be not kept too long poring on his Book because he is subject to sore eyes and of a weakly Constitution  By these Methods the young Gentleman is in every Article as fully accomplished at eight  Years old as at eight and twenty Age adding only to the Growth of his Person and his Vice so that if you should look at him in his Boyhood through the magnifying End of a Perspective and in his Manhood through the other it would be impossible to spy any Difference the same Airs the same Strutt the same Cock of his Hat and Posture of his Sword as far as the Change of Fashions will allow the same Understanding the same Compass of Knowledge with the very same Absurdity Impudence and Impertinence of Tongue  He is taught from the Nursery that he must inherit a great Estate and hath no need to mind his Book which is a Lesson he never forgets to the End of his Life His chief Solace is to steal down and play at Spanfarthing with the Page or young Blackamoor or little favourite FootBoy one of which is his principal Confident and BosomFriend  There is one young Lord in this Town who by an unexampled Piece of good Fortune was miraculously snatched out of the Gulph of Ignorance confined to a publick School for a due Term of Years well whipped when he deserved it clad no better than his Comrades and always their PlayFellow on the same Foot had no Precedence in the School but what was given him by his Merit and lost it whenever he was negligent It is well known how many Mutinies were bred at this unprecedented Treatment what Complaints among his  Relations  and other  Great Ones  of both Sexes that his Stockings with silver Clocks were ravish'd from  him that he wore his own Hair that his Dress was undistinguished that he was not fit to appear at a Ball or Assembly nor suffered to go to either And it was with the utmost Difficulty that he became qualified for his present Removal where he may probably be farther persecuted and possibly with Success if the Firmness of a very worthy Governor and his own good Dispositions will not preserve him I confess I cannot but wish he may go on in the Way he began because I have a Curiosity to know by so singular an Experiment whether Truth Honour Justice Temperance Courage and good Sense acquired by a  School  and  College  Education may not produce a very tolerable Lad although he should happen to fail in one or two of those Accomplishments which in the general Vogue are held so important to the finishing of a Gentleman  It is true I have known an Academical Education to have been exploded in publick Assemblies and have heard more than one or two Persons of high Rank declare they could learn nothing more at  Oxford  and  Cambridge  than to drink Ale and smoke Tobacco wherein I firmly believed them and could have added some hundred Examples from my own Observation in one of those Universities but they all were of young Heirs sent thither only for Form either from Schools where they were not suffered by their careful Parents to stay above three Months in the Year or from under the Management of  French  FamilyTutors who yet often attended them to their  College  to prevent all Possibility of their Improvement But I never yet knew any one Person of Quality who followed his Studies at the University and carried away his just Proportion of Learning that was not ready upon all Occasions to celebrate and defend that Course of Education and to prove a Patron of learned Men  There is one Circumstance in a learned Education which ought to have much Weight even with those who have no Learning at all The Books read at  School  and  Colleges  are full of Incitements to Virtue and Discouragements from Vice drawn from the wisest Reasons the strongest Motives and the most influencing Examples Thus young Minds are filled early with an Inclination to Good and an Abhorrence of Evil both which encrease in them according to the Advances they make in Literature and although they may be and too often are drawn by the Temptations of Youth and the Opportunities of a large Fortune into some Irregularities when they come forward into the great World it is ever with Reluctance and Compunction of Mind because their Byass to Virtue still continues They may stray sometimes out of Infirmity or Compliance but they will soon return to the right Road and keep it always in View I speak only of those Excesses which are too much the Attendants of Youth and warmer Blood for as to the Points of Honour Truth Justice and other noble Gifts of the Mind wherein the Temperature of the Body hath no Concern they are seldom or ever known to be mild  I have engaged my self very unwarily in too copious a Subject for so short a Paper The present Scope I would aim at is to prove that some Proportion of human Knowledge appears requisite to those who by their Birth or Fortune are called to the making of Laws and in a subordinate Way to the Execution of them and that such Knowledge is not to be obtained without a Miracle under the frequent corrupt and sottish Methods of educating those who are born to Wealth or Titles For I would have it remembered that I do by no Means confine these Remarks to young Persons of Noble Birth the same Errors running through all Families where there is Wealth enough to afford that their Sons at least the Eldest may be good for nothing Why should my Son be a Scholar when it is not intended that he should live by his Learning By this Rule if what is commonly said be true that Money answereth all Things why should my Son be honest temperate just or charitable since he hath no Intention to depend upon any of these Qualities for a Maintenance  When all is done perhaps upon the Whole the Matter is not so bad as I would make it and God who worketh Good out of Evil acting only by the ordinary Cause and Rule of Nature permits this continual Circulation of human Things for his own unsearchable Ends The Father grows rich by Avarice Injustice Oppression he is a Tyrant in the Neighbourhood over Slaves and Beggars whom he calls his Tenants Why should he desire to have  Qualities infused into his Son which himself never possessed or knew or found the Want of in the Acquisition of his Wealth The Son bred in Sloth and Idleness becomes a Spendthrift a Cully a Profligate and goes out of the World a Beggar as his Father came in Thus the former is punished for his own Sins as well as for those of the latter The Dunghill having raised a huge Mushroom of short Duration is now spread to enrich other Mens Lands It is indeed of worse Consequence where noble Families are gone to Decay because their Titles and Privileges outlive their Estates And Politicians tell us that nothing is more dangerous to the Publick than a numerous Nobility without Merit or Fortune But even here God hath likewise prescribed some Remedy in the Order of Nature so many great Families coming to an End by the Sloth Luxury and abandoned Lusts which enervated their Breed through every Succession producing gradually a more effeminate Race wholly unfit for Propagation  A LETTER TO THE INTELLIGENCER  SIR  IT may appear to you perhaps a Thing very unnatural to receive a Complaint from a  Son  against his  Father  but the Treatment which I meet with from mine is of such a Nature that it is impossible for me not to complain  You must know there are three Brethren of us  George Patrick  and  Andrew  I am the second but the last in Affection with my  Father  for which I call Heaven and Earth to Witness I never committed any Fault to incur his Displeasure or to deserve his Neglect But so it is that the best of Men have often Times been misled in the Choice of their Minions and very undiscerning in conferring their Favours where they ought  If Parents could but once bring themselves to be impartial it would beyond all doubt produce  a delighful Union in their Children and be the most binding Cement that could be thought of to preserve their Affections because an equal Dispensation of Favours would entirely remove all Cause of Murmuring Repining or Envy and what is of the greatest Consequence would secure the Love and Esteem of their Children whereas a partial Behaviour in Parents must necessarily produce the contrary  But to state my Case in the best Manner I can and with an unbiassed Regard to Truth I think it first necessary to give you our Characters with an Account of my  Father  's Behaviour that you may be the better able to give me your  Advice  First then to begin with my Brother  George  He was ever a great Lover of his Belly and formerly used to cram himself with  Beef Pudding  and  WhitePot  but for some Time past he has taken more Delight in new fangled  Tossups  and  French KeckShaws  This high Feeding does naturally dispose him to be haughty stubborn cholerick and rebellious insomuch that besides his Insults towards others he is ready upon all Occasions to fly in his owm  Father  's Face and apt to despise every Body but himself  He is so various in his Opinions that he is of as many  Religions  as there are and have been  Sects  since the Beginning of  Christianity  but the  True  and  Reformed Church as by Law established  is what he chiefly frequents He was once a great Admirer of ancient Learning but he has long since quitted this for the  Reading of  NewsPapers Pamphlets  and  Modern Languages  In his younger Years he was fond of manly Exercises such as  Fencing Leaping Boxing pitching the Bar Wrestling Hurling Football Hunting  c but of late he has fallen into a strange and unaccountable Effeminacy and seems to take Delight in nothing but  Masquerades Plays  and  Italian Opera  's He is very fond of  Italian  magnificent Buildings although entirely inconsistent with our Climate extravagant in the highest Degree in purchasing fine Paintings and Statues and no less expensive in vast extensive Parks and Gardens by which Means he has almost run out all his Fortune  My younger Brother  Andrew  who has Cunning enough to outwit the  Devil  joined with Brother  George  some Years ago and they manage so dextrously together that whatever they say is a  Law  with my  Father  however they are not without their Quarrels now and then but Brother  Andrew  still comes by the worst although he is cautious enough to go always armed for Brother  George  wears a longer Sword Brother  Andrew  is not very nice in his Food but loves fine Cloaths This I suppose he has learned abroad for he is a great Traveller His chief Studies are  Mathematicks  and the  CivilLaw  in both which he has made a considerable Progress As for his  Religion  although he openly professes himself a most rigid  Fanatick of the Kirk  yet he is shrewdly suspected to have a Hankering after  Popery  He has one eminent bad Quality  which is that he cannot easily forgive and forget I remember I was once so unfortunate as to tell a fair  Lady  a  Mistress  of mine before his Face that I would stand by her against him and all her other Adversaries which he took heinously ill and has not forgiven me to this Hour but lies upon the Watch to do me all the ill Offices he can  I come now to my own Character in which I shall not conceal nor gloss over my Vices Errors or Failings but at the same Time I shall not think it inconsistent with Modesty to tell you my Virtues  I have but a small Fortune can hardly keep Soul and Body together yet out of a Regard to my Family which is very Ancient I love to make what they call a Figure upon extraordinary Occasions And now and then I furnish my Table with Victuals and Liquors of the best Kinds which makes my  Father  and Brother  George  think I have got the World in a String I am kind and hospitable to Strangers although they frequently rob my House and turn my Children to lye in the Barn  I am so fond of Learning that I put them to the best School in the Kingdom and I plainly see they will be only the Wiser but never the Richer for it because my  Father  uses all his Interest for Brother  George  's Sons and the greatest  Dunce  among them shall be better provided for than the most Ingenious of mine And I must say I have some who are equal in Learning to the best of his I had a Design once to follow  Merchandise  that I might the  better be able to provide for my poor Children but Brother  George  having a Mind to make a  Monopoly  prevailed upon my  Father  to join against me and so at last they contrived it that I should sell nothing but a few of my  Cattle  and some  LinnenCloth  which is all the Support I have whereas Brother  George  can sell every Thing he has all the World over and so cruel is he to me that he will not let me have even a Bit of his Dirt if he thinks it will be of any Advantage to me My  Religion  is of three Sorts the  Established Popish  and  Presbyterian  but I have a greater Share of the first in me I think it is best because it encourages Obedience to my  Father  more than either of the other two It is not long since Brother  George  and  Andrew  were in a Confederacy against my  Father  with an Intent to turn him out of his House and give another the Possession at which critical Juncture I mustered up a great Number of my Sons and Servants to his Assistance and for ought I know saved both his Life and Fortune  Soon after this I had like to have been ruined by a Project for one of my Brother  George  's Family endeavoured to persuade my  Father  that  Gold  and  Silver  were of no Use to me and desired Leave to furnish me with a few  Counters  in Lieu thereof and I fear I should have been so weak as to accept of them had it not been for the seasonable Remonstrances made by some of my own  House  These are a few of the many Hardships I have suffered notwithstanding all which I am  willing to continue in  Passive Obedience  to my dear  Father  for I have Reason to believe that his Unkindness to me is owing to ill Advisers who have prejudiced him against me and my Children but I hope before long he will be able to distinguish his most faithful Son In the mean Time I do humbly entreat the Favour of you to write a Letter to my  Father  which he may see in Print for I fear all my Letters to him hitherto have been intercepted  PATRICK  SIR  YOU have not told me your  Father  's Name nor his Quality and therefore I am at a Loss in what Manner I should address him But in common Humanity because I think your Case deplorable I will give you what Comfort I am able together with my best Advice  You are not the only Instance of  suffering Innocence  and therefore it ought not surprze you that  Providence  for Reasons unaccountable to us has laid two great Tryals in your Way  Oppression  from your  Brethren  and  Unkindness  from your  Father  this too without any Fault on your Side If you did not meet with these Afflictions you would want an Opportunity of shewing your Humility and Resignation as I understand you do not by your Letter  Let me advise you to consider that your Condition is not quite so lamentable as that of  Joseph  who triumphed in GOD's own Time over all his Misfortunes and Sufferings and at last had the Pleasure of doing Good even to his Persecutors but indeed there is this Difference that his Grievance was chiefly from his  Brethren  for had his Father joined in the Cruelty the Wounds would have pierced nearer to his Heart  I do not in the least doubt but there are some about your Father who do you ill Offices I hope some Time or other they will be detected You may find a convenient Opportunity of getting fairly at him State your Case and expostulate with him concerning your own and your Childrens Sufferings When he hears your Story and beholds your Sincerity you may be sure of his Compassion and a Redress for there is no Heart so hard as not to sympathize with Real Woe no Advocate so powerful as Innocence In the mean Time let me conjure you not to turn aside to the Right or to the Left from that indispensable Duty which the express Laws of God enjoin you for let me assure you that Ingratitude to a Parent is no less than Rebellion like the Sin of Witchcraft  I commit you to his Care and Direction who is best able to govern the unruly Affections of Men to turn the Hearts of the Malicious and to relieve and support those who suffer for the Sake of Righteousness  I am your faithful Friend The INTELLIGENCER  A SECOND LETTER TO THE Intelligencer  Quantum stagna Tagi rudibus stillantia venis  Effluxere decus quanto pretiosa metallo  Hermi ripa micat quantas per Lidia culta  Despumat rutilas dives Pactolus arenas  CLAUDIAN  Mr Intelligencer  HAving lately with great Candour and Impartiality perused some of your  Papers  upon the Distress and Poverty of this  Island  which you take Care to describe in the most pathetick Manner you must forgive me if I differ from you and think it one of the most flourishing and wealthy Kingdoms in the whole World And to support my Opinion I will venture to affirm that there never was such Affluence in ready Cash as at this present Juncture For have we not more  Bankers  than ever were known among us And whether the  Money  circulates in  Specie  or  Paper  it is the same Thing to us since those who would rather have  Cash  than  Paper  can as is well known have their Choice whenever they please It is to be presum'd that no  Banker  gives a NOTE before the  Money  is first laid down on his  Counter  then of Consequence there is as much  Money  as there is  Paper  and that we have a great deal of  Paper  is most certain therefore a great deal of  Money  But I will proceed farther and prove that we have much more  Money  than  Paper  because there are Multitudes who keep their own  Money  This appears from the great Number of  Iron Chests  imported from  Holland  within these last  seven Years  for what Use can they be of but to lodge  Money  They are at least two hundred We will suppose that these one with another may contain  two thousand Pounds  a piece then the Sum total amounts to  four hundred thousand Pounds  which is so much superfluous and unnecessary  Cash  If this  Island  were not very wealthy it is strongly to be presumed that so many  wise  and  able  Heads Men of great Learning and superior Talents whose Reputations reach'd us from distant Regions long before they came among us so well distinguished in their own  Countries  for their great Knowledge in their several Professions and here more especially remarkable for their speaking in publick and their profound Skill in Religion Politicks and Law I say that Men of such Accomplishments would never quit their own Native Soil where so  many Estates are daily made if they were not sure that this  Island  must on account of its greater Wealth afford them Opportunities of making larger Acquisitions than they could at home  Have not almost all the Gentlemen thro' this  Kingdom  for some Years past  declined  all  profitable Employments  and left them to be filled by others Can there be a stronger Argument of their Wealth than their chusing to live at their  Ease out of Office  rather than be at the small Trouble which attends the Discharge of a beneficial Employment  Could so many estated Gentlemen thro' the North of  Ireland  afford to keep so much of their  Lands waste  and  untenanted  if they had not  Money  enough by them to live without Tenants and would not the Tenants likewise be glad to take this waste Land to plow and sow but that they have ready Money enough to buy  Bread Corn  and other Necessaries from all the World beside  As another signal Mark of our Riches there is scarce a Gentleman who does not educate his Sons at our UNIVERSITY  which as the World sees wants not its due Encouragement  where they live at vast Expences take Degrees return to their Fathers who without ever troubling  Law  or  Gospel  maintain them afterwards at  Home  like  Gentlemen  Do not many of our Nobility through Wantonness and Superfluity reside constantly in  another Kingdom  where it is well known they make a better Figure as to  Houses Coaches  and  Equipages  than their Neighbours And do not our young  Peers  and  Gentry  who go thither  to see the World Game Race Drink  c beyond any in  GreatBritain  of the same Age and Quality Which they could not possibly do if their Agents here had not an  undrainable Fund to supply them  For as the  Philosopher  says  Nemo dat quod non habet  Or as the  Juglar  very elegantly expresses it  Where nothing is there nothing can come out  If it be true I know it is confidently reported that a great Number of  English Robbers  are come over that likewise is a very strong Argument of our Wealth for they would never quit the  English Streets  and  Roads  for ours unless they were sure to find an Advantage by the Change It is most certain we never had such a Number of  Robbers  as at this very Juncture from whence we may conclude that they could not possibly multiply thus if they did not find Houses and People enough to rob for all Professions and Trades encrease according to the Encouragement they meet with  Are not whole Streets adding every Day to our  Metropolis  when one would think it large enough already Some entire Streets and many Houses I must confess are waste and uninhabited But does not this shew the Wealth and Wantonness of the Inhabitants who not content with their present Dwellings change them for others more costly and expensive  Do not great Numbers of our Inhabitants daily go off to  America  will any Man say this can be done with empty Pockets Can any  Man think otherwise but that it must be the Effect of vast Superfluity when People wantonly take such long Voyages and Journeys to go where they have no Business  The last Argument I shall offer for the Wealth of this Kingdom is the great Number of  Beggars  in which it abounds for it is a common Observation that Riches are the Parent of Idleness Sloth and Luxury and are not these naturally productive of Want and Beggary  I could offer many more Arguments but that I hope you and your Countrymen are sufficiently convinced by what I have said that  Ireland  is a Place of great Wealth Affluence and Plenty Therefore let me advise you the next Time you put Pen to Paper not to dress up  Hibernia  in Rags and Dirt but cloath her in  Scarlet  and  fine Linnen  for she can very well afford them Draw the  God  of Riches hovering over your  Island  shaking ten Thousand of Golden Feathers from his Wings much more than the Inhabitants can gather And thus will your Countrymen who have retrenched upon your last groundless Alarm return to their former Hospitality and we shall see  Halcyon  that is  Irish  Days once more  A True and Faithful NARRATIVE OF What pass'd in LONDON during the general Consternation of all Ranks and Degrees of Mankind On  Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  and  Friday  last  ON  Tuesday  the th of  October  Mr  Whiston  held his Lecture near the  Royal Exchange  to an Audience of Fourteen worthy Citizens his Subscribers and constant Hearers Besides these there were five chance Auditors for that Night only who had paid their Shillings apeice I think my self oblig'd to be very particular in this Relation lest my Veracity should be suspected which makes me appeal to the Men who were Present of which Number I my self was one Their Names are  Henry Watson  Haberdasher  George Hancock  Druggist  John Lewis  DrySalter  William Jones  CornChandler  Henry Theobald  Watchmaker  James Peters  Draper  Thomas Floyer  Silversmith  John Wells  Brewer  Samuel Greg  SoapBoyler  William Cooley  Fishmonger  James Harper  Hosier  Robert Tucker  Stationer  George Ford  Ironmonger  Daniel Lynch  Apothecary  Apprentices  William Bennet  David Somers  Charles Lock  Leonard Daval  Henry Croft  Mr  Whiston  began by acquainting us that contrary to his Advertisement he thought himfelf in duty and conscience oblig'd to change the subject Matter of his intended discourseHere he paus'd and seem'd for a short space as it were lost in Devotion and mental Prayer after which with great earnestness and vehemence he spake as follows  "Friends and Fellow Citizens all speculative Science is at an end the Period of all things is at Hand on  Friday  next this World shall be no more Put not your confidence in me Brethren for to morrow Morning five  Minutes after five the Truth will be Evident in that instant the Comet shall appear of which I have heretofore warn'd you As ye have heard believe Go hence and prepare your Wives your Families and Friends for the universal Change"  At this solemn and dreadful Prediction the whole Society appear'd in the utmost Astonishment but it would be unjust not to remember that Mr  Whiston  himself was in so calm a Temper as to return a Shilling a piece to the Youths who had been disappointed of their Lecture which I thought from a Man of his Integrity a convincing Proof of his own Faith in the Prediction  As we thought it a Duty in Charity to warn all Men in two or three Hours the News had spread through the City At first indeed our report met with but little Credit it being by our greatest dealers in Stocks thought only a CourtArtifice to sink them that some choice Favourites might purchase at a lower Rate for the  South Sea  that very Evening fell five  per Cent  the  India  eleven and all the other Funds in Proportion But at the Courtend of the Town our Attestations were intirely disbeliev'd or turn'd into ridicule yet nevertheless the News spread every where and was the subject matter of all Conversation  That very Night as I was credibly inform'd Mr  Whiston  was sent for to a great Lady who is very curious in the Learned Sciences and addicted to all the Speculative Doubts of the most able Philosophers but he  was not now to be found and since at other times he has been known not to decline that Honour I make no doubt he conceal'd himself to attend the great Business of his Soul But whether it was the Lady's Faith or Inquisitiveness that ocasion'd her to send is a Point I shall not presume to determine As for his being sent for to the Secretary's Office by a Messenger it is now known to be a Matter notoriously false and indeed at first it had little credit with me that so Zealous and Honest a Man should be  ordered into Custody  as a  Seditious Preacher  who is known to be so well affected to the  present happy Establishment  'Twas now I reflected with exceeding trouble and sorrow that I had disus'd Family Prayers for above five Years and though it hath been a Custom of late intirely neglected by Men of any Business or Station I determin'd within myself no longer to omit so reasonable and religious a Duty I acquainted my Wife with my Intentions But two or three Neighbours having been engaged to Sup with us that Night and many Hours being unwarily spent at Cards I was prevail'd upon by her to put it off till the next Day she reasoning that it would be time enough to take off the Servants from their Business which this practice must infallibly occasion for an Hour or two every Day after the  Comet  had made its appearance  Zachary Bowen  a Quaker and my next Neighbour had no sooner heard of the Prophecy but he made me a Visit I informed  him of every thing I had heard but found him quite obstinate in his unbelieve for said he be comforted Friend thy tidings are Impossibilities for were these things to happen they must have been foreseen by some of our Brethren This indeed as in all other spiritual Cases with this Sett of People was his only reason against believing me and as he was fully persuaded that the Prediction was erroneous he in a very neighbourly Manner admonished me against  selling my Stock  at the present low Price which he said beyond dispute must have a Rise before  Monday  when this unreasonable Consternation should be over  But on WEDNESDAY Morning I believe to the exact Calculation of Mr  Whiston  the  Comet  appear'd For at three Minutes aster five by my own Watch I saw it He indeed foretold that it would be seen at five Minutes after Five but as the best Watches may be a Minute or two too slow I am apt to think his Calculation just to a Minute  In less than a quarter of an Hour all  Cheapside  was crouded with a vast concourse of People and notwithstanding it was so early 'tis thought that through all that part of the Town there was not Man Woman or Child except the Sick or Infirm left in their Beds From my own Balcony I am consident I saw several Thousands in the Street and counted at least seventeen who were upon their Knees and seem'd in actual Devotion Eleven of them indeed appear'd to be old Women of about Fourscore The Six others were Men in an  advanc'd Life but as I could guess two of them might be under Seventy  It is highly probable that an event of this Nature may be pass'd over by the greater Historians of our Times as conducing very little or nothing to the unravelling and laying open the deep Schemes of Politicians and Mysteries of State for which reason I thought it might not be unacceptable to record the Facts which in the Space of three Days came to my Knowledge either as an Eyewitness or from unquestionable Authorities nor can I think this Narrative will be intirely without its Use as it may enable us to form a more just Idea of our Countrymen in general particularly in regard to their Faith Religion Morals and Politicks  Before WEDNESDAY Noon the Belief was universal that the Day of Judgment was at Hand insomuch that a Waterman of my accquaintance told me he counted no less than one hundred and twenty three Clergymen who had been ferry'd over to  Lambeth  before twelve aClock these 'tis said went thither to Petition that a  short Prayer  might be  Penn'd  and  Order'd  there being none in the Service upon that occasion But as in things of this Nature it is necessary that the  Council  be consulted their request was not immediately comply'd with and this I affirm to be the true and only Reason that the Churches were not that Morning so well attended and is in no ways to be imputed to the Fears and Consternation of the Clergy with which the Freethinkers  have since very unjustly reproach'd them  My Wife and I went to Church where we had not been for many Years on a Weekday and with a very large Congregation were disappointed of the Service But what will be scarce credible by the carelessness of a 'Prentice in our absence we had a Piece of fine  Cambric  carried off by a Shoplifter so little impression was yet made on the minds of those wicked Women  I cannot omit the care of a particular  Director of the Bank  I hope the worthy and wealthy Knight will forgive me that I endeavour to do him Justice for it was unquestionably owing to Sir  G  H  's sagacity that all the  FireOffices  were requir'd to have a particular Eye upon the  Bank of England  Let it be recorded to his Praise that in the general hurry this struck him as his nearest and tenderest concern but the next day in the Evening after having taken due care of all his Books Bills and Bonds I was inform'd his mind was wholly turn'd upon Spiritual Matters yet ever and anon he could not help expressing his resentment against the  Tories  and  Jacobites  to whom he imputed that sudden  Run upon the Bank  which happen'd on this occasion  A Great Man whom at this time it may not be prudent to name employ'd all the  Wednesday  Morning to make up such an Account as might appear fair in case he should be call'd upon to produce it on the  Friday  but was forced to desist after having  for several Hours together attempted it not being able to bring himself to a resolution to trust the many hundred Articles of his secret Transactions upon Paper  Another seem'd to be very melancholy which his flatterers imputed to his dread of losing his Power in a Day or two but I rather take it that his chief concern was the Terror of being try'd in a Court that could not be influenc'd and where a Majority of Voices could avail him nothing It was observ'd too that he had few Visitors that Day this added so much to his Mortification that he read thro' the first Chapter of the Book of  Job  and wept over it bitterly in short he seem'd a true Penitent in every thing but in Charity to his Neighbour No business was that Day done in his  ComptingHouse  'tis said too that he was advis'd to Restitution but I never heard that he comply'd with it any farther than in giving half a Crown a piece to several craz'd and starving Creditors who attended in the outward Room  Three of the  Maids of Honour  sent to countermand their Birthday Cloaths two of them burnt all their Collections of Novels and Romances and sent to a Bookseller's  in Pallmall  to buy each of them a Bible and  Taylor  's  Holy Living and Dying  But I must do all of them the Justice to acknowledge that they shew'd a very decent Behaviour in the drawing Room and restrain'd themselves from those innocent Freedoms and little Levities so commonly incident to young Ladies of their Profession So many Birthday Suits were countermanded the next  Day that most of the Taylors and Mantuamakers discharg'd all their Journeymen and Women A grave elderly Lady of great Erudition and Modesty who visits these young Ladies seem'd to be extreamly shock'd by the Apprehensions that She was to appear naked before the whole World and no less so that all Mankind was to appear naked before Her which might so much divert her Thoughts as to incapacitate her to give Ready and apt Answers to the Interrogatories that might be made her The Maids of Honour who had both Modesty and Curiosity could not imagine the Sight so disagreeable as was represented nay one of them went so far as to say she perfectly long'd to see it for it could not be so indecent when every body was to be alike and they had a Day or two to prepare themselves to be seen in that condition Upon this reflection each of them order'd a BathingTub to be got ready that Evening and a LookingGlass to be set by it So much are these young Ladies both by Nature and Custom addicted to cleanly appearance  A WestCountry Gentleman told me he got a ChurchLease fill'd up that Morning for the same Sum which had been refus'd for three Years successively I must impute this meerly to accident for I cannot imagine that any Divine could take the advantage of his Tenant in so unhandsome a Manner or that the shortness of the Life was in the least his Consideration though I have heard the same worthy  Prelate aspers'd and malign'd since upon this very Account  The  Term  being so near the alarm among the LAWYERS was inexpressible though some of them I was told were so vain as to promise themselves some advantages in making their defence by being vers'd in the Practice of our earthly Courts It is said too that some of the chief Pleaders were heard to express great satisfaction that there had been but sew  StateTryals  of late Years Several Attornies demanded the  return of Fees  that had been given the Lawyers but it was answered the Fee was undoubtedly charg'd to their Client and that they could not connive at such Injustice as to suffer it to be sunk in the Attorney's Pockets Our sage and learned  Judges  had great consolation insomuch as they had not pleaded at the Bar for several Years the  Barristers  rejoyced in that they were not  Attornies  and the Attornies felt no less satisfaction that they were not  Pettifoggers Scriveners  and other meaner Officers of the Law  As to the ARMY far be it from me to conceal the Truth Every Soldier's behaviour was as undismayed and undaunted as if nothing was to happen I impute not this to their want of Faith but to their martial Disposition though I cannot help thinking they commonly accompany their commands with more  Oaths  than are requisite of which there was no remarkable diminution this Morning on the Parade in St  James  's Park But possibly it was by choice and on consideration that they  continued this way of Expression not to intimidate the common Soldiers or give occasion to suspect that even the Fear of Damnation could make any impression upon their Superior Officers A  Duel  was fought the same Morning between two Colonels not occasion'd as was reported because the one was put over the other's Head that being a Point which might at such a Juncture have been accommodated by the Mediation of Friends but as this was upon the account of a Lady 'twas judg'd it could not be put off at this time above all others but demanded immediate Satisfaction I am apt to believe that a young Officer who desir'd his Surgeon to defer putting him into a Salivation till  Saturday  might make this request out of some Opinion he had of the truth of the Prophecy for the apprehensions of any danger in the Operation could not be his Motive the Surgeon himself having assured me that he had before undergone three severe Operations of the like Nature with great resignation and fortitude  There was an Order issued that the  Chaplains  of the several  Regiments  should attend their Duty but as they were dispers'd about in several parts of  England  it was believ'd that most of them could not be found or so much as heard of till the great Day was over  Most of the considerable PHYSICIANS by their outward demeanor seem'd to be Unbelievers but at the same time they every where insinuated that there might be a  Pestilential Malignancy  in the  Air  occasion'd by the  Comet  which might be arm'd against by proper and timely Medicines This caution had but little effect for as the time approach'd the Christian Resignation of the People encreas'd and most of them which was never before known had their Souls more at Heart than their Bodies  If the Reverend CLERGY show'd more Concern than others I charitably impute it to their great  charge of Souls  and what confirm'd me in this Opinion was that the  Degrees  of  Apprehension  and  Terror  could be distinguish'd to be greater or less according to their  Ranks  and  Degrees  in the  Church  The like might be observ'd in all sorts of Ministers though not of the Church of  England  the higher their Rank the more was their Fear  I speak not of the COURT for fear of offence and I forbear Inserting the  Names  of particular Persons to avoid the imputation of Slander so that the Reader will allow this Narrative must be deficient and is therefore desir'd to accept hereof rather as a Sketch than a regular circumstantial History  I was not inform'd of any Persons who shew'd the least Joy except three Malefactors who were to be executed the  Monday  following and one Old Man a constant Churchgoer who being at the point of Death exprest some satisfaction at the News  On  Thursday  Morning there was little or nothing transacted in  ChangeAlley  there were a Multitude of Sellers but so few Buyers  that one cannot affirm the Stocks bore any certain Price except among the  Jews  who this Day reap'd great Profit by their Infidelity There were many who call'd themselves  Christians  who offer'd to buy  for time  but as these were People of  great Distinction  I chuse not to mention them because in effect it would seem to accuse them both of Avarice and Infidelity  The  Run  upon the  Bank  is too well known to need a particular Relation for it never can be forgotten that no one Person whatever except the  Directors  themselves and some of their particular Friends and Associates could convert a  Bill  all that Day into  Specie  all hands being imploy'd to serve  them  In the several Churches of the City and Suburbs there were seven Thousand two Hundred and Forty Five who publickly and solemnly declar'd before the Congregation that they took to Wife their several  kept Mistresses  which was allow'd as valid Marriage the Priests not having time to pronounce the Ceremony in Form  At St  Bride  's Church in  Fleetstreet  Mr  Woolston  who writ against the Miracles of our Saviour in the utmost Terrors of Conscience made a publick Recantation Dr  Mandevil  who had been groundlessly reported formerly to have done the same did it now in good earnest at St  James  's Gate as did also at the  Temple  Church several Gentlemen who frequent  CoffeeHouses  near the Bar So great was the Faith and Fear of two of them that they  dropt Dead on the Spot but I will not record their Names lest I should be thought invidiously to lay an Odium on their Families and Posterity  Most of the  Players  who had very little Faith before were now desirous of having as much as they cou'd and therefore embrac'd the  Roman Catholick Religion  the same thing was observ'd of some  Bawds  and  Ladies of Pleasure  An  Irish  Gentleman out of pure Friendship came to make me a Visit and advis'd me to  hire a Boat  for the ensuing Day and told me that unless I gave earnest for one immediately he fear'd it might be too late for his Countrymen had secured almost every Boat upon the River as judging that in the  general Conflagration  to be upon the  Water  would be the  safest Place  There were  two Lords  and  three Commoners  who out of a scruple of Conscience very hastily threw up their Pensions as imagining a Pension was only an annual  retaining Bribe  All the other great Pensioners I was told had their Scruples quieted by a  Clergyman  or two of distinction whom they happily consulted  It was remarkable that several of our very richest  Tradesmen  of the City in common Charity gave away Shillings and Sixpences to the Beggars who ply'd about the Church Doors and at a particular Church in the City a Wealthy  Churchwarden  with his own Hands distributed Fifty twelvepenny Loaves to the Poor by way of Restitution for the many great and  costly Feasts which he had eaten of at their expence  Three great Ladies a  Valet de Chambre  two Lords a CustomHouse Officer five Halfpay Captains and a Baronet all noted  Gamesters  came publickly into a Church at  Westminster  and deposited a very considerable Sum of Money in the Minister's Hands the Parties whom they had defrauded being either out of Town or not to be found But so great is the Hardness of Heart of this Fraternity that among either the Noble or Vulgar Gamesters though the Profession is so general I did not hear of any other restitution of this Sort At the same time I must observe that in comparison of these through all parts of the Town the Justice and Penitence of the  HighwayMen Housebreakers  and common  PickPockets  was very remarkable  The  Directors  of our  Publick Companies  were in such dreadful apprehensions that one would have thought a  Parliamentary Enquiry  was at hand yet so great was their presence of Mind that all the  Thursday  Morning was taken up in  private Transfers  which by malicious People was thought to be done with design to conceal their Effects  I forbear mentioning the private Confessions of particular  Ladies  to their  Husbands  for as their Children were born in Wedlock and of consequence are Legitimate it would be an invidious Task to record them as Bastards and particularly after their several Husbands have so charitably forgiven them  The Evening and Night through the whole Town were spent in Devotions both Publick and Private the Churches for this one Day were so crowded by the Nobility and Gentry that Thousands of common People were seen praying in the publick Streets In short one would have thought the whole Town had been really and seriously religious But what was very remarkable all the different Persuasions kept by themselves for as each thought the other would be damned not one would join in Prayer with the other  At length FRIDAY came and the People cover'd all the Streets Expecting Watching and Praying But as the Day wore away their Fears first began to abate then lessen'd every hour at Night they were almost extinct till the total Darkness that hitherto us'd to terrify now comforted every  Freethinker  and  Atheist  Great numbers went together to the  Taverns  bespoke  Suppers  and broke up whole  Hogsheads  for joy The subject of all Wit and Conversation was to ridicule the Prophecy and railly each other All the Quality and Gentry were  perfectly asham'd  nay some utterly disown'd that they had manifested any Signs of Religion  But the next Day even the Common People as well as their Betters appear'd in their usual state of Indifference They Drank they Whor'd they Swore they Ly'd they Cheated they Plunder'd they Gam'd they Quarrell'd they Murder'd In short the World went on in the old Channel  I need not give any Instances of what will so easily be credited but I cannot omit relating that Mr  Woolston  advertis'd in that very  Saturday  's  EveningPost  a new  Treatise  against the  Miracles  of our Saviour and that the few who had given up their Pensions the Day before solicited to have them continued which as they had not been thrown up upon any Ministerial Point I am inform'd was readily granted  THE JOURNAL OF A Modern LADY  IT was a most unfriendly Part  In you who ought to know my Heart  So well acquainted with my Zeal  For all the Female Commonweal  How cou'd it come into your

our Lectures  And when She has him by the Neck fast  Hauls him and scolds Us down to Break fast  We squander there an Hour or more  And then all Hands Boys to the Oar  All Heteroctil  Dan  except  Who

us Hares when he can catch 'em  How skilfully  Dan  mends his Nets  How Fortune fails him when he sets  Or how the Dean delights to vex  The Ladies or lampoon the Sex  Or how our Neighbour lifts his

turn topsyturvy  They talk of further Alterations  Which causes many Speculations  ON Cutting down the OLD THORNE AT  MARKET HILL  AT  Market Hill  as well appears  By Chronicle of antient Date  There stood for many a hundred Years  A spacious Thorn before the Gate  Hither came every Village Maid  And on the Boughs her Garland hung  And here beneath the spreading Shade  Secure from Satyrs sat and sung  Sir  Archibald Acheson  Secretary of State for  Scotland  Sir  Archibald  that val'rous Knight  The Lord of all the fruitful Plain  Would come and listen with Delight  For he was fond of rural Strain  Sir  Archibald  whose fav'rite Name  Shall stand for Ages on Record  By  Scotish  Bards of highest Fame  Drummond  of  Hawthorden  and Sir  William Alexander  E of  Sterling  both famous for their Poetry who were Friends to Sir  Archibald  Wise  Hawthorden  and  Sterline  's Lord  But Time with Iron Teeth I ween  Has canker'd all its Branches round  No Fruit or Blossom to be seen  Its Head reclining tow'rds the Ground  This aged sickly sapless Thorn  Which must alass no longer stand  Behold the cruel Dean in Scorn  Cuts down with sacreligious Hand  Dame Nature when she saw the Blow  Astonish'd gave a dreadful Shriek  And Mother  Tellus  trembled so  She scarce recover'd in a Week  The  Silvan  Pow'rs with Fear perplex'd  In Prudence and Compassion sent  For none could tell whose Turn was next  Sad Omens of the dire Event  The Magpye lighting on the Stock  Stood chatt'ring with incessant Din  And with her Beak gave many a Knock  To rouse and warn the Nymph within  The Owl foresaw in pensive Mood  The Ruin of her antient Seat  And fled in haste with all her Brood  To seek a more secure Retreat  Last trolled forth a gentle Swine  To ease her Itch against the Stump  And dismally was heard to whine  All as she scrubb'd her meazly Rump  The Nymph who dwells in every Tree  If all be true that Poets chant  Condemn'd by Fate's supreme Decree  Must die with her expiring Plant  Thus when the gentle  Spina  found  The Thorn committed to her Care  Receive its last and deadly Wound  She fled and vanish'd into Air  But from the Root a dismal Groan  First issuing struck the Murd'rers Ears  And in a shrill revengeful Tone  This Prophecy he trembling hears  " Thou chief Contriver of my Fall  " Relentless Dean to Mischief born  " My Kindred oft' thine Hide shall gall  " Thy Gown and Cassock oft be torn  " And thy consed'rate Dame who brags  " That she condemn'd me to the Fire  " Shall rent her Petticoats to Rags  " And wound her Legs with ev'ry Bry'r  " Nor thou Lord  Sir  Arthur Acheson  Arthur  shalt escape  " To thee I often call'd in vain  " Against that Assassin in Crape  " Yet thou could'st tamely see me slain  " Nor when I felt the dreadful Blow  " Or chid the Dean or pinch'd thy Spouse  " Since you could see me treated so  " An old Retainer to your House  " May that fell Dean by whose Command  " Was formed this  Machi'villian  Plot  " Not leave a Thistle on the Land  " Then who will own thee for a  Scot  " Pigs and Fanaticks Cows and Teagues  " Thro' all thy Empire I forsee  " To tear thy Hedges join in Leagues  " Sworn to revenge my Thorn and me  " And thou the Wretch ordain'd by Fate  "  Neal Gabagan Hibernian  Clown  " With Hatchet blunter than thy Pate  " To hack my hallow'd Timber down  " When thou suspended high in Air  " Dy'st on a more ignoble Tree  " For thou shalt steal thy Landlord's Mare  " Then bloody  Caitiff  think on me  A PASTORAL DIALOGUE  DERMOT SHEELAH  A Nymph and Swain  Sheelah  and  Dermot  hight  Who wont to weed the Court of  Gosford Knight  While each with stubbed Knife remov'd the Roots  That rais'd between the Stones their daily Shoots  As at their Work they sate in counterview  With mutual Beauty smit their Passion grew  Sing heavenly Muse in sweetly flowing Strain  The soft Endearments of the Nymph and Swain  DERMOT  My Love to  Sheelah  is more firmly fixt  Than strongest Weeds that grow these Stones betwixt  My Spud these Nettles from the Stones can part  No Knife so keen to weed thee from my Heart  SHEELAH  My Love for gentle  Dermot  faster grows  Than yon tall Dock that rises to thy Nose  Cut down the Dock 'twill sprout again but O  Love rooted out again will never grow  DERMOT  No more that Bry'r thy tender Legs shall rake  I spare the Thistle for Sir  Arthur  's sake  Sharp are the Stones take thou this rushy Matt  The hardest Bum will bruise with sitting squat  SHEELAH  Thy Breeches torn behind stand gaping wide  This Petticoat shall save thy dear Backside  Nor need I blush although you feel it wet  Dermot  I vow 'tis nothing else but sweat  DERMOT  At an old stubborn Root I chanc'd to tug  When the Dean threw me this Tobacco plug  A longer halfp'orth never did I see  This dearest  Sheelah  thou shalt share with me  SHEELAH  In at the Pantry door this Morn I slipt  And from the Shelf a charming Crust I whipt  Dennis  was out and I got hither safe  And thou my dear shalt have the bigger half  DERMOT  When you saw  Tady  at longbullets play  You sat and lows'd him all the Sunshine Day  How could you  Sheelah  listen to his Tales  Or crak such Lice as his betwixt your Nails  SHELAH  When you with  Oonah  stood behind a Ditch  I peept and saw you kiss the dirty Bitch  Dermot  how could you touch those nasty Sluts  I almost wisht this Spud were in your Guts  DERMOT  If  Oonah  once I kiss'd forbear to chide  Her Aunt's my Gossip by my Father's Side  But if I ever touch her Lips again  May I be doom'd for Life to weed in Rain  SHEELAH  Dermot  I swear tho'  Tady's  Locks could hold  Ten thousand Lice and ev'ry Louse was gold  Him on my Lap you never more should see  Or may I lose my Weeding knifeand Thee  DERMOT  O could I earn for thee my lovely Lass  A pair of Brogues to bear thee dry to Mass  But see where  Norah  with the Sowins comes  Then let us rise and rest our weary Bums  Mary  the CookMaid's LETTER TO Dr  SHERIDAN  WELL if ever I saw such another Man since my Mother bound my Head  You a Gentleman marry come up I wonder where you were bred  I am sure such Words does not become a Man of your Cloth  I would not give such Language to a Dog faith and troth  Yes you call'd my Master a Knave Fie Mr  Sheridan  'tis a Shame  For a Parson who shou'd know better Things to come out with such a Name  Knave in your Teeth Mr  Sheridan  'tis both a Shame and a Sin  And the Dean my Master is an honester Man than you and all your kin  He has more goodness in his little Finger than you have in your whole Body  My Master is a parsonable Man and not a spindleshank'd hoddy doddy  And now whereby I find you would fain make an excuse  Because my Master one Day in anger call'd you Goose  Which and I am sure I have been his Servant four Years since  October  And he never call'd me worse than Sweetheart drunk or sober  Not that I know his Reverence was ever concern'd to my knowledge  Tho' you and your Comerogues keep him out so late in your Colledge  You say you will eat Grass on his Grave a Christian eat Grass  Whereby you now confess your self to be a Goose or on Ass  But that's as much as to say that my Master should die before ye  Well well that's as God pleases and I don't believe that's a true Story  And so say I told you so and you may go tell my Master what care I  And I don't care who knows it 'tis all one to  Mary  Every body knows that I love to tell Truth and shame the Devil  I am but a poor Servant but I think Gentlefolks should be civil  Besides you found fault with our Vittles one Day that you was here  I remember it was on a  Tuesday  of all Days in the Year  And  Saunders  the Man says you are always jesting and mocking  Mary  said he one Day as I was mending my Master's Stocking  My Master is so fond of that Minister that keeps the School  I thought my Master a wise Man but that Man makes him a Fool  Saunders  said I I would rather than a Quart of Ale  He would come into our Kitchen and I would pin a Dishclout to his Tail  And now I must go and get  Saunders  to direct this Letter  For I write but a sad Scrawl but my Sister  Marget  she writes better  Well but I must run and make the Bed before my Master comes from Pray'rs  And see now it strikes ten and I hear him coming up Stairs  Whereof I cou'd say more to your Verses if I cou'd write written hand  And so I remain in a civil way your Servant to command  A DIALOGUE Between Mad MULLINIX and TIMOTHY  M  I Own 'tis not my Bread and Butter  But prithee  Tim  why all this Clutter  Why ever in these raging Fits  Damning to Hell the  Jacobites  When if you search the Kingdom round  There's hardly twenty to be found  No not among the  Priests  and  Fryers  T  'Twixt you and me G  Damn the Lyars  M  The  Tories  are gone ev'ry Man over  To our Illustrious House of  Hanover  From all their Conduct this is plain  And then  T  G  Damn the Lyars again  Did not an Earl but lately vote  To bring in I could cut his Throat  Our whole Accounts of publick Debts  M  Lord how this frothy Coxcomb frets  aside  T  Did not an able StatesmanB  This dang'rous horrid Motion dishup  As  Popish  Craft Did he not rail on't  Shew Fire and Faggot in the Tail on't  Proving the  Earl  a grand Offender  And in a Plot for the  Pretender  Whose Fleet 'tis all our Friends Opinion  Was then embarking at  Avignon  These brangling Jars of  Whig  and  Tory  Are stale and worn as  TroyTown Story  The Wrong 'tis certain you were both in  And now you find you fought for nothing  Your Faction when their Game was new  Might want such noisy Fools as you  But you when all the Show is past  Resolve to stand it out the last  Like  Martin Marral  gaping on  Not minding when the Song is done  When all the  Bees  are gone to settle  You clatter still your Brazen Kettle  The Leaders whom you listed under  Have dropt their Arms and seiz'd the Plunder  And when the War is past you come  To rattle in their Ears your Drum  And as that hateful hideous  Grecian  Thersites  he was your Relation  Was more abhor'd and scorn'd by those  With whom he serv'd than by his Foes  So thou art grown the Detestation  Of all thy Party through the Nation  Thy peevish and perpetual Teazing  With Plots and  Jacobites  and Treason  Thy busy nevermeaning Face  Thy screw'dup Front thy State grimace  Thy formal Nods important Sneers  Thy Whisp'rings foisted in all Ears  Which are whatever you may think  But Nonsese wrapt up in a stink  Have made thy Presence in a true Sense  To thy own Side so damn'd a Nuisance  That when they have you in their Eye  As if the  Devil  drove they fly  T  My good Friend  Mullinix  sorbear  I vow to G  you're too severe  If it could ever yet be known  I took Advice except my own  It shou'd be yours But D  my Blood  I must pursue the publick Good  The Faction is it not notorious  Keck at the Memory of  Glorious  'Tis true nor need I to be told  My  quondam  Friends are grown so cold  That scarce a Creature can be found  To prance with me his Statue round  The publick Safety I foresee  Henceforth depends alone on me  And while this vital Breath I blow  Or from above or from below  I'll sputter swagger curse and rail  The  Tories  Terror Scourge and Flail  M  Tim  you mistake the Matter quite  The Tories you are their  Delight  And should you act a differens Part  Be grave and wise'twould break their Heart  Why  Tim  you have a Taste I know  And often see a  Puppetshow  Observe the Audience is in Pain  While  Punch  is hid behind the Scene  But when they hear his rusty Voice  With what Impatience they rejoice  And then they value not two Straws  How  Solomon  decides the Cause  Which the true Mother which  Pretender  Nor listen to the Witch of  Endor  Shou'd  Faustus  with the Devil behind him  Enter the Stage they never mind him  If  Punch  to spur their Fancy shows  In at the Door his monstrous Nose  Then sudden draws it back again  O what a Pleasure mixt with Pain  You ev'ry Moment think an Age  'Till he appears upon the Stage  And first his Bum you see him clap  Upon the Queen of  Sheba  's Lap  The Duke of  Lorrain  drew his Sword  Punch  roaring ran and running roar'd  Revil'd all People in his Jargon  And sold the  King of Spain  a Bargain  St  George  himself he plays the Wag on  And mounts astride upon the  Dragon  He gets a thousand Thumps and Kicks  Yet cannot leave his roguish Tricks  In every Action thrusts his Nose  The Reason why no Mortal knows  In doleful Scenes that break our Heart  Punch  comes like you and lets a F  t  There's not a Puppet made of Wood  But what wou'd hang him if they cou'd  While teizing all by all he's teaz'd  How well are the Spectators pleas'd  Who in the Motion have no Share  But purely come to hear and stare  Have no Concern for  Sabra  's Sake  Which gets the better Saint or Snake  Provided  Punch  for there's the Jest  Be foundly mawl'd and plague the rest  Thus  Tim  Philosophers suppose  The World consists of Puppetshows  Where petulant conceited Fellows  Perform the Part of  Punchinelloes  So at this Booth which we call  Dublin  Tim  thou'rt the  Punch  to stir up Trouble in  You wriggle fidge and make a Rout  Put all your Brother Puppets out  Run on in a perpetual Round  To teaze perplex disturb confound  Intrude with Monkey Grin and Clatter  To interrupt all serious Matter  Are grown the Nuisance of your  Clan  Who hate and scorn you to a Man  But then the Lookerson the  Tories  You still divert with merry Stories  They wou'd consent that all the Crew  Were hang'd before they'd part with you  But tell me  Tim  upon the Spot  By all this Coyl what hast thou got  If  Tories  must have all the Sport  I fear you'll be disgrac'd at  Court  T  Got  D  my Blood  I frank my Letters  Walk by my Place before my Betters  And simple as I now stand here  Expect in Time to be a P  Got  D  me why I got my Will  Ne'er hold my Peace and ne'er stand still  I f  t with twenty Ladies by  They call me Beast and what care I  I bravely call the  Tories Jacks  And Sons of Whoresbehind their Backs  But could you bring me once to think  That when I strut and stare and stink  Revile and slander fume and storm  Betray make Oath impeach inform  With such a constant loyal Zeal  To serve my self and Commonweal  And fret the  Tories  Souls to Death  I did but lose my precious Breath  And when I damn my Soul to plague 'em  Am as you tell me but their Maygame  Consume my Vitals they shall know  I am not to be treated so  I'd rather hang my self by half  Than give those Rascals Cause to laugh  But how my Friend can I endure  Once so renown'd to live obscure  No little Boys and Girls to cry  There's nimble  Tim  a passing by  No more my dear delightful Way tread  Of keeping up  a PartyHatred  Will none the  Tory Dogs  pursue  When thro' the Streets I cry  Hallooe  Must all my D  mee's Bloods and Wounds  Pass only now for empty Sounds  Shall  Tory  Rascals be elected  Although I swear them disaffected  And when I roar  a Plot a Plot  Will our own Party mind me not  So qualify'd to swear and lye  Will they not trust me for a  Spy  Dear  Mullinix  your good Advice  I beg you see the Case

they think not of yousnap  The worst that Envy or that Spite  E'er said of me is I can bite  That idle Gypsies Rogues in Rags  Who poke at me can make no Brags  And that to towze such Things as

Boyle  Alas one bad Example shown  How quickly all the Sex pursue  See Madam see the Arts o'erthrown  Between  John Overton  and  You  On a certain Lady at Court  I Know the thing that's most uncommon  Envy be silent and attend  I know a Reasonable Woman  Handsome and witty yet a Friend  Not warp'd by Passion aw'd by Rumour  Not grave thro' Pride or gay thro' Folly  An equal Mixture of good Humour  And sensible soft Melancholy  " Has she no Faults then Envy says Sir"  Yes she has one I must aver  When all the World conspires to praise her  The Woman's deaf and does not hear  A SOLDIER AND A SCHOLAR OR A Lady's Judgment on those two Characters  THUS spoke to my Lady the Knight full of Care  Let me have your Advice in a weighty Affair  This  Hamilton  's Bawn while it sticks on my Hand  I lose by the House what I get by the Land  But how to dispose of it to the best Bidder  For a  Barrack  or  Malthouse  we now must consider  First let me suppose I make it a Malthouse  Here I have computed the Profit will fall t'us  There's nine hundred Pounds for Labour and Grain  I increase it to Twelve so Three hundred remain  A handsome Addition for Wine and good Cheer  Three Dishes a Day and ten Hogsheads a Year  With a Dozen large Vessels my Vaules shall be stor'd  No little scrub Joint shall e'er come on my Board  And you and the Dean no more shall combine  To stint me at Night to one Bottle of Wine  Nor shall I for his Humours permit you to purloin  A Stone and a half of good Beef from my Surloin  If I make it a  Barrack  the Crown is my Tenant  My Dear I have ponder'd again and again on't  In Poundage and Drawback I lose half my Rent  Whatever they give me I must be content  Or join with the Court in every Debate  And rather than that I would lose my Estate  Thus ended the Knight Thus began the meek Wife  It must and it shall be a Barrack my Life  I am grown a mere Mopus no Company comes  But a Rabble of Tenants and rusty dull  Rums  With Parsons what Lady can keep her self clean  I am all over dawb'd when I sit by the  Dean of St  Patrick  's  Dean  But if you will give us a Barrack my Dear  The Captain I'm sure will always come here  I then shall not value his Deanship a Straw  For the Captain I'll warrant will keep him in Awe  Or should he pretend to be brisk and alert  We'll tell him that Chaplains should not be so pert  That Men of his Coat should be minding their Prayers  And not among Ladies to give themselves Airs  Thus argu'd my Lady but argu'd in vain  The Knight his Opinion resolv'd to maintain  But  Hannah  who listen'd to all that was past  And could not endure so vulgar a Taste  As soon as her Ladyship call'd to be drest  Cry'd Madam why surely my Master's possest  Sir  Arthur  the Malster how fine it would Sound  I'd rather the Bawn were funk under Ground  But Madam I guess'd there would never come Good  When I saw him so often with  Sir  A  A  's Receiver and one of his Tenants  Darby  and  Wood  And now my Dream's out for I was adream'd  That I saw a huge Rat O dear how I scream'd  And after methought I lost my new Shoes  And  Molly  she said I should hear some ill News  Dear Madam had you but the Spirit to teaze  You might have a Barrack whenever you please  And Madam I always believ'd you so stout  That for twenty Denials you would not give out  If I had a Husband like him I protest  Till he gave me my Will I would give him no Rest  And rather than come in the same Pair of Sheets  With such a cross Man I wou'd lie in the Streets  But Madam I beg you'll contrive and invent  And worry him out till he gives his Consent  Dear Madam whene'er on a Barrack I think  An I were to be hang'd I can't sleep a Wink  For if a new Crotchet comes into my Brain  I can't get it out tho' I'd never so fain  I fancy already a Barrack contriv'd  At  Hamilton  's Bawn and the Troop is arriv'd  Of this to be sure Sir  Arthur  has warning  And waits on the Captain betimes in the Morning  Now see when they meet how their Honours behave  Noble Captain your ServantSir  Arthur  your Slave  You honour me muchThe Honour is mine  'Twas a sad rainy NightBut the Morning is fine  Pray how does my LadyMy Wife's at your Service  I think I have seen her Picture at  Jervais'  Goodmorrow good CaptainI'll wait on you down  You shan't stir a FootYou'll think me a Clown  For all the World Captain not half an Inch farther  You must be obey'd your Servant Sir  Arthur  My humble Respects to my Lady unknown  I hope you will use my House as your own  " Go bring me my Smock and leave off your Prate  " Thou hast certainly gotten a Cup in thy Pate  Pray Madam be quiet what was it I said  You had like to have put it quite out of my Head  Next day to be sure the Captain will come  At the Head of his Troop with his Trumpet and Drum  Now Madam observe how he marches in State  The Man with the KettleDrum enters the Gate  Dub dub a dub dub the Trumpeters follow  Tantara Tantara while all the Boys halloo  See now comes the Captain all dawb'd with Gold Lace  O law the sweet Gentleman look in his Face  And see how he rides like a Lord of the Land  And the fine FlamingSword he holds in his Hand  And his Horse the dear  Creature  it prances and rears  With Ribbands in Knots at his Tail and his Ears  At last comes the Troop at the Word of Command  Drawn up in our Court 'till the Captain cries Stand  Your Ladyship lifts up the Sash to be seen  For sure I had dizen'd you out like a Queen  The Captain to shew he is proud of the Favour  Looks up to the Window and cocks up his Beaver  His Beaver is cockt pray Madam mind that  For a Captain of Horse never takes off his Hat  Because he has never a Hand that is idle  For the Right holds the Sword and the Left holds the Bridle  Then he flourishes thrice his Sword in the Air  As a Compliment due to a Lady so fair  How I tremblo to think of the Blood it has spilt  Then he lowers the Point then he kisses the Hilt  Your Ladyship smiles and thus you begin  " Pray Captain be pleas'd to alight and walk in  The Captain salutes you with Congee profound  And your Ladyship curtsies halfway to the Ground  "  Kit  run for your Master and bid him come to us  " I'm sure he'll be proud of the Honour you do us  " And Captain you'll do us the Favour to stay  " And take a short Dinner here with us to day  " You're heartily welcome but as for good Cheer  " You are come in the very worst Time of the Year  " Had I but expected so worthy a Guest  Lord Madam your Ladyship sure is in Jest  You banter me Madam the Kingdom must grant  " You Officers Captain are so complaisant  " Hist Hussy I think I hear Somebody coming  No Madam 'tis only Sir  Arthur  a humming  To shorten my Tale for I hate a long Story  The Captain at Dinner appears in his Glory  The  Dr  Swift  Dean and the  Dr  Jenny  Doctor have humbled their Pride  For the Captain's intreated to sit by your Side  And because he's their Betters you carve for him first  The Parsons for Envy are ready to burst  The Servants amaz'd are scarce ever able  To keep off their Eyes as he sits at the Table  And  Molly  and I have thrust in our Nose  To peep at the Captain in all his fine Cloaths  Dear Madám 'be sure he's a finespoken Man  Do but hear on the Clergy how glib his Tongue ran  " And Madam said he if such Dinners you give  " You'll never want Parsons as long as you live  " I ne'er knew a Parson without a good Nose  " But the Devil's as welcome whereever he goes  " G  d  me they bid us reform and repent  " But Z  ds by their Looks they never keep Lent  " Mr Curate for all your grave Looks I'm afraid  " You cast a Sheep's Eye on her Ladyship's Maid  " I wish she would lend you her lillywhite Hand  " In mending your Gown and smoothing your Band  " For the Dean was so shabby and look'd like a Ninny  " That the Captain suppos'd he was Curate to  Jenny    " Whenever you see a Cassock and Gown  " An hundred to one but it covers a Clown  " Observe how a Parson comes into a Room  " G  d  me he hobbles as bad as my Groom  " A Scholar when just from the College broke loose  " Can hardly tell how to cry  Bo  to a Goose  " Your  Novids  and  Bluturks  and  Omers  and Stuff  " By G  they don't signify this Pinch of Snuff  " To give a young Gentleman right Education  " The Army's the very best School in the Nation  " My Schoolmaster call'd me a Dunce and a Fool  " But at Cuffs I was always the Cock of the School  " I never could take to my Books for the Blood o'me  " And the Puppy consest he expected no Good o'me  " Now Madam you'll think it a strange thing to say  " But the Sight of a Book makes me sick to this Day  Never since I was born did I hear so much Wit  And Madam I laugh'd till I thought I should split  So then you look'd scornful and sniff'd at the Dean  As who should say "Now am I skinny and lean  But he durst not so much as once open his Lips  And the Doctor was plaguily down in the Hips  Thus merciless  Hannah  run on in her Talk  Till she heard the Dean call "Will your Ladyship walk  Her Ladyship answersI'm just coming down  Then turning to  Hannah  and forcing a Frown  Altho' it was plain in her Heart she was glad  Ory'd Hussy why sure the Wench is gone mad  How could these Chimera's get into your Brains  Come hither and take this old Gown for your Pains  But the Dean if this Secret should get to his Ears  Will never have done with his Jibes and his Jeers  For your Life not a Word of this Matter I charge you  Give me but a Barrack a Fig for the Clergy  TO Doctor  D  L  Y  ON THE LIBELS Writ against him  AS some raw Youth in Country bred  To Arms by Thirst of Honour led  When at a Skirmish first he hears  The Bullets whistling round his Ears  Will duck his Head aside will start  And feel a trembling at his Heart  Till 'scaping oft' without a Wound  Lessens the Terror of the Sound  Fly Bullets now as thick as Hops  He runs into a Cannon's Chops  An Author thus who pants for Fame  Begins the World with Fear and Shame  When first in Print you see him dread  Each Potgun levell'd at his Head  The Lead yon Critick's Quill contains  Is destin'd to beat out his Brains  As if he heard loud Thunders roll  Cries Lord have Mercy on his Soul  Concluding that another Shot  Will strike him dead upon the Spot  But when with squibbing flashing popping  He cannot see one Creature dropping  That missing Fire or missing Aim  His Life is safe I mean his Fame  The Danger past takes Heart of Grace  And looks a Critick in the Face  Though Splendor gives the fairest Mark  To poison'd Arrows  the Dark  Yet  In seipso totus teres atque rotundus  in your self when smooth and round  They glance aside without a Wound  'Tis said the Gods try'd all their Art  How  Pain  they might from  Pleasure  part  But little could their Strength avail  Both still are fast'ned by the Tail  Thus  Fame  and  Censure  with a Tether  By Fate are always link'd together  Why will you aim to be preferr'd  In Wit before the common Herd  And yet grow mortify'd and vext  To pay the Penalty annext  'Tis Eminence makes Envy rise  As fairest Fruits attract the Flyes  Shou'd stupid Libels grieve your Mind  You soon a Remedy may find  Lie down obscure like other Folks  Below the Lash of Snarlers Jokes  Their Faction is five hundred odds  For ev'ry Coxcomb lends them Rods  And sneers as learnedly as they  Like Females o'er their Morning Tea  You say the Muse will not contain  And write you must or break a Vein  Then if you find the Terms too hard  No longer my Advice regard  But raise your Fancy on the Wing  The  Irish Senate  's Praises sing  How jealous of the Nation's Freedom  And for Corruptions how they weed 'em  How each the Publick Good pursues  How far their Hearts from private Views  Make all true Patriots up to Shoeboys  Huzza their Brethren at the  Blueboys  And dread no more the Rage of Grub  You then may soon be of the Club  How oft' am I for Rhime to seek  To dress a Thought I toyl a Week  And then how thankful to the Town  If all my Pains will earn a Crown  Whilst ev'ry Critick can devour  My Work and me in half an Hour  Would Men of Genius cease to write  The Rogues must die for Want of Spight  Must die for Want of Food and Rayment  If Scandal did not find them Payment  How chearfully the Hawkers cry  A Satire and the Gentry buy  While my hardlabour'd Poem pines  Unsold upon the Printer's Lines  A  Genius  in the Rev'rend Gown  Must ever keep its Owner down  'Tis an unnatural Conjunction  And spoils the Credit of the Function  Round all your Brethren cast your Eyes  Point out the surest Men to rise  That Club of Candidates in Black  The least deserving of the Pack  Aspiring factious fierce and loud  With Grace and Learning unendow'd  Will sooner coyn a Thousand Lyes  Than suffer Men of Parts to rise  They croud about Preferment's Gate  And press you down with all their Weight  For as of old Mathematicans  Were by the Vulgar thought Magicians  So Academick dull Aledrinkers  Pronounce all Men of Wit Freethinkers  Wit as the chief of Virtue's Friends  Disdains to serve ignoble Ends  Observe what Loads of stupid Rhimes  Oppress us in corrupted Times  What Pamphlets in a Court's Defence  Shew Reason Grammar Truth or Sense  For though the Muse delights in Fiction  She ne'er inspires against Conviction  Then keep your Virtue still unmixt  And let not Faction come betwixt  By Party steps no Grandeur clime at  Tho' it would make you  England  's Primate  First learn the Science to be dull  You then may soon your Conscience lull  If not however seated high  Your Genius in your Face will fly  When  Jove  was from his teeming Head  Of Wit's fair Goodness brought to Bed  There follow'd at his Lyingin  For Afterbirth a  Sooterkin  Which as the Nurse pursu'd to kill  Attain'd by Flight the Muses

caught in Traps  Dame Nature as the Learned show  Provides each Animal its Foe  Hounds hunts the Hare the wily Fox  Devours your Geese the Wolf your Flocks  Thus Envy pleads a nat'ral Claim  To persecute the Muses Fame  On Poets in all Times abusive  From  Homer  down to  Pope  inclusive  Yet what avails it to complain  You try to take Revenge in vain  A Rat your utmost Rage defies  That
