 ANECDOTES OF EMINENT PAINTERS IN  SPAIN  c  VOL I  ANECDOTES OF EMINENT PAINTERS IN  SPAIN  During the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries WITH CURSORY REMARKS UPON THE PRESENT STATE OF ARTS IN THAT KINGDOM  BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND  IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON PRINTED FOR J WALTER CHARINGCROSS MDCCLXXXII  ANECDOTES OF EMINENT PAINTERS IN  SPAIN  c  SPAIN has given birth to so many eminent Painters of whom there is no memorial in the rest of Europe and abounds with so many admirable examples of their art dispersed in churches convents and palaces where the curiosity of modern travellers rare∣ly carries them that I persuade  myself it will not be unacceptable to the public to have some ac∣count of men and works so little known and yet so highly worthy to be recorded I am not aware that this has been professedly at∣tempted by any Spanish writer except by  Palomino  who in an elaborate treatise on the Art of Painting in two folio volumes has inserted the lives of two hun∣dred and thirtythree Painters and Sculptors who florished in Spain from the time of  Ferdinand the Catholic  to the conclusion of the reign of  Philip the Fourth  of these materials I have principally availed myself in the following sheets but not without due attention to other authorities that interpose accounts  differing from his or extend to particulars which he has failed to enumerate He is said to have written with a competent know∣ledge of his subject as an art of which he was himself a professor and in rules for the practice of painting he is very diffusive If he had been more communicative or entertaining in those matters for which I chiefly consulted him I might have needed less apology for the present publication Many particulars however have been furnished to me from tradition which help out the sterility and dryness of his catalogue and I must not omit to acknowledge the assistance I drew from the treatise of  Pacheco  a book now become  extremely rare and hardly to be obtained I know there was an English abridgement of Palomi∣no's Painters published in the year but the original is in very few hands so that unless some Spanish biographer shall speedily be found with public spirit to en∣gage in the task of rescuing the fame of his ingenious country∣men from approaching extinction their histories at least will soon be lost whatever may be the fate of their works The world is in pos∣session of many memoirs of the ar∣tists of Italy France and Flan∣ders and the Painters who dis∣tinguished themselves in England have by happy fortune found a biographer whose entertaining ta∣lents  will secure to them a recep∣tion with posterity whilst of all the Painters to whose memory I have dedicated this slight at∣tempt scarce a name is heard without the limits of Spain ex∣cept those of  Velasquez Murillo  and  Ribeira  The paintings of the latter it is true are very gene∣rally known many excellent per∣formances of his being dispersed through Europe Some respecta∣ble remains of  Velasquez  are to be found in Italy but the principal exertions of his pencil were reser∣ved for his own country and the Sovereign who entertained him in his service these we may natu∣rally suppose can never be ex∣tracted And as for  Murillo  al∣though  some pieces of his have in time past been extracted from Se∣ville yet I think I may venture to say that not many of them which pass under his name are legiti∣mate and in a less proportion can we find amongst such as are true pictures any of so capital a rank as to impart a competent idea of his extraordinary merit  The candid reader will observe that I do not profess to give the Lives of the Painters who are treated of in this catalogue for which my materials do not suffice nor shall I hazard many criticisms upon their respective works for which more science would be re∣quisite than I can pretend to still I hope there will be sound suffi∣cient  novelty to amuse such of my readers as can endure to hear of paintings as they strike the feelings of an ordinary observer without presuming to dissect them in the learned jargon of a Virtuoso It will be remembered therefore that I offer nothing more to the public than Anecdotes of the Eminent Painters who have flo∣rished in Spain during the two centuries last past and in this de∣scription I include all such illus∣trious foreigners as have resorted to Spain for the display of their talents under protection of the Princes or Nobles of that king∣dom these are a pretty numerous class and in treating of them I shall study to avoid repeating  what may have been better told by others but even of these per∣haps some local anecdotes will occur which may at least be sup∣plementary to the accounts al∣ready in existence My residence in Spain and some advantages in∣cident to my peculiar situation there gave me repeated access to every thing I wished to see al∣most every religious foundation throughout the kingdom contains a magazine of art in resorting to these nothing will be found of which a stranger can complain unless of the gloominess of some of the edifices and the unfavour∣able lights in which many capi∣tal paintings are disposed In pri∣vate houses it is not unusual to  discover very fine pictures in neg∣lect and decay thrown aside amongst the rubbish of castoff furniture whether it be that the possessor has no knowledge of their excellence or thinks it be∣low his notice to attend to their preservation but how much so∣ever the Spaniards have declined from their former taste and pas∣sion for the elegant arts I am persuaded they have in no degree fallen off from their national cha∣racter for generosity which is still so prevalent amongst them that a stranger who is interestedly dis∣posed to avail himself of their munificence may in a great measure obtain whatever is the object of his praise and admira∣tion  As for the royal collections at Madrid the Escorial and else∣where he will meet a condescen∣sion so accommodated to his cu∣riosity that the one is as little likely to be exhausted as the other the facility of access to every palace in possession of His Catholic Majesty is only to be equalled by the gratification it produces  THE Arts which revived in Italy during the th century did not reach Spain till the time of  Ferdinand the Catholic Antonio Del Rincon  a native of  Guadalax∣ara  may be considered as the fa∣ther of the Spanish school he studied in Rome and returning to his native country was taken into the service of  Ferdinand  who bestowed on him the Order of  Santiago  and made him Groom of his Chamber There are two por∣traits of  Ferdinand  and  Isabella  painted by him still to be seen at  Toledo  in the church of  San Juan de los Reyes  and several pictures by his hand perished in the fire that destroyed the palace of the  Pardo  in the year This ar∣tist died in the year  The unhappy catastrophe of  Torrigiano  the Florentine follow∣ed in the year After having enriched the cities of  Andalusia  with several pieces of sculpture not unworthy the disciple and ri∣val of  Michael Angelo  he was condemned to death by the In∣quisition and expired in the pri∣son of  Seville  under the horrors of an approaching execution The story is as follows  Torrigiano  had undertaken to carve a Madona and child of the natural size at the order of a certain Spanish Gran∣dee it was to be made after the model of one which he had al∣ready executed and promise was given him of a reward propor∣tioned to the merit of his work His employer was one of the first Grandees of Spain and  Torrigi∣ano  who conceived highly of his generosity and well knew what  his own talents could perform was determined to outdo his for∣mer work he had passed great part of his life in travelling from kingdom to kingdom in search of employment and flattering him∣self with the hope that he had now at last found a restingplace after all his labours the ingenious artist with much pains and appli∣cation compleated the work and presented to his employer a matchless piece of sculpture the utmost effort of his art the Gran∣dee surveyed the striking perfor∣mance with great delight and re∣verence applauded  Torrigiano  to the skies and impatient to pos∣sess himself of the enchanting idol forthwith sent to demand it  at the same time to set off his generosity with a better display he loaded two lacqueys with the money that was to defray the purchase the bulk at least was promising but when  Torrigiano  turned out the bags and found the specie nothing better than a parcel of brass maravedi amount∣ing only to the paltry sum of thir∣ty ducats vexation at this sudden disappointment of his hopes and just resentment for what he con∣sidered as an insult to his merit so transported him that snatch∣ing up his mallet in a rage and not regarding the perfection or what to him was of more fatal consequence the sacred character of the image he had made he  broke it suddenly in pieces and dismissed the lacqueys with their load of farthings to tell the tale They executed their errand too well The Grandee in his turn fired with shame vexation and revenge and assuming or per∣haps conceiving horror for the sacrilegious nature of the act pre∣sented himself before the Court of Inquisition and impeached the unhappy artist at that terrible tri∣bunal it was in vain that poor  Torrigiano  urged the right of an author over his own creation Reason pleaded on his side but Superstition sate in judgement the decree was death with torture The Holy Office lost its victim for  Torrigiano  expired under the hor∣rors  not under the hands of the executioner That he was of a fierce impatient spirit we may well believe from what is related of his maiming the great  Michael Angelo  by a violent blow on the sace the heretical reader perhaps will think this blow a more in∣excusable offence than that for which he suffered and an enthu∣siast in the arts will scarce lament the punishment which by a just transition fell upon him for my part I lament both his offence and his punishment the man who could be so frantic with pas∣sion as in the person of  Michael Angelo  to deface one of the di∣vinest works of heaven might easily be tempted to demolish his  own and it has been generally observed that hearts so prone to anger have on occasion been as susceptible of apprehension and fear it is to be supposed that  Torrigiano  's case was not better in the eyes of the Holy Office for his having been resident in England and employed by King  Henry the Eighth  Whether they considered him as tinctured with the heresy of that Royal apostate does not ap∣pear I am inclined to believe he more resembled Henry in temper than in opinion At least if we are to credit his assault on  Michael Angelo  and try him on that ac∣tion since the days of Diomed few mortals ever launched a more impious blow  The arts being thus trans∣planted from Italy into Spain found a ready naturalization in a country then abounding with ge∣nius The province of Andalu∣sia took the lead on this occasion and has in all times been produc∣tive of extraordinary talents it was the cradle of most of the Spa∣nish painters it's natives conti∣nue to be remarked for quick and volatile parts differing much in manners and disposition from the Castilians Certain it is that Spain has many local qualifications for becoming a nursery of Painters which other countries are in want os It enjoys a clear and vivid sky with a dry and healthy air fa∣vourable to the preservation if not  to the production of works of art the human countenance there is in general of a grave historical cast the intermixture of the Jewish and Moorish tribes have marked the lower classes with a strong peculi∣arity of features the forms of the children till they attain the age of eight or ten are good and of∣tentimes their faces beautiful the eyes of the women black and piercing and as they use much action when they converse and are universally addicted to the Moor∣ish modes of dancing which al∣most every peasant can accom∣pany with his voice and instru∣ment their groupes become ex∣tremely picturesque To these may be added the character of their  dress particularly that of Anda∣lusia which both in male and fe∣male is uncommonly antique and graceful the cloak alone may be folded twenty different ways for different applications and each attitude presents a specimen of drapery worthy the study of an academy The Painters have a∣vailed themselves of this Italians as well as natives and the  Capa  will be found frequently upon their canvasses even where the scene does not lie in Spain In speaking of Spain as a country favourable to Painters I think it is just to except painters of land∣scapes in these it has neither ex∣celled nor abounded and the ge∣neral want of trees and verdure  readily supplies a reason Groves and rivers and scattered habita∣tions emblematic of rural tranquil∣lity which furnish the most pleas∣ing subjects to the imagination of the scenist are there but thinly spread the face of Nature is adust and frowning  The Emperor  Charles  though not very cordially attached to his Spanish subjects nor over partial to their country cultivated not∣withstanding the genius of their Painters and this he effected not only by sending them to study under the Italian masters but also by inviting the Italian masters in∣to Spain the fertile genius of  Titiano  might have been alone sufficient to illuminate a kingdom  and there were many others in the like employ  Julio  and  Alexan∣dro  Italians of the school of  Juan de Udine  a disciple of  Ra∣fael  were artists of great emi∣nence  Charles  employed them in a royal work the beautifying the Alhambra of Grenada they en∣riched the Hospital of  Santiago  in the city of  Ubeda  with many no∣ble paintings and the famous Duke of Alva found employment for their talents  Alonso Berruguete  a Castilian educated in the school of the great  Michael Angelo  the friend and contemporary of  Andrea del Sarto Bachio Bandinello  and others re∣turned into Spain an eminent proficient in painting sculpture  and architecture deeply skilled in the theory of his art he exhi∣bited to the world a new system of human symmetry and propor∣tion differing at once from the rules of  Pomponio Gaurico Philipo de Borgona  and  Alberto Durero  over whom he finally triumphed both in principle and practice leaving many illustrious monu∣ments of his excellence in all the branches of his study both at Madrid the Pardo and the Al∣hambra of Grenada for which he was suitably honoured and re∣warded by the Emperor  Charles  and died full of years and replete with fame and fortune in in the city of Madrid I should observe in this place that in the  choir of the cathedral in  Toledo  there are an innumerable number of beautiful carvings by  Berru∣guete Philip de Borgona  executed one side of the choir and  Berru∣guete  the other  The success of this artist was an encouragement to others and the school of  Michael Angelo  was eagerly resorted to by  Baptista Bergamo  and  Gaspar Becerra  of  Baiza  in  Andalusia  these illustri∣ous students returned together to Spain and were immediately tak∣en into the protection of the Em∣peror The arts which  Rincon  had transplanted into Spain which  Berruguete  had so prosper∣ously advanced they but espe∣cially  Becerra  pushed into matu∣rity  this man who even in Rome at that period in her zenith had attracted general admiration ex∣celled in sculpture equally as in painting in the latter art his mode of colouring and his ma∣nagement in the relief of his fi∣gures greatly improved the prac∣tice of the Spanish school and taught his countrymen to look upon their first manner with con∣tempt As a statuary he seems to have found ample field for the exercise of his talents the altars now began to wear a different form instead of the distorted bar∣barous shapes of Gothic masonry crucifixes saints and virgins now took place in all the grande gusto of  Michael Angelo  The  churches of  Astorga Zamora Burgos  and  Salamanca  contended which should first engage him in their service he executed all these commissions to the satisfac∣tion of the Fathers and when they had equipped his images in wide hoops and furbelowed petti∣coats they applauded the artist and adored his manufacture It was not so easy to satisfy the ca∣price of  Isabella  of  Valois  she commissioned him to carve a wooden image of our Lady of the  Solidad  for the convent of  San Francisco de Paulo Becerra  re∣ceived her Majesty's commands and addressed himself with dili∣gence to the work after the la∣bour of a year he compleated an  image to his intire satisfaction he presented it to the Queen with an assurance of success but in vain his image did not reach the ideas of the Queen the expression did not please her and he was com∣manded not only to make a bet∣ter but to take less time in mak∣ing it He executed his order a second time and produced an image to the admiration of all beholders even the Fathers of the Convent acknowledged it to be a perfect and exact representa∣tion of nature it was again sub∣mitted to the Queen and again condemned for falling short of her Majesty's conceptions of our Lady of the  Solidad  the unhappy artist was threatened to be super∣seded  in the commission by some abler master but anxious to pre∣serve his preeminence and ful∣fil her Majesty's ideas he again applied himself with ardour to the task he racked his imagination without ceasing to frame some vi∣sage and devise some form that  Isabella  might confess bore a re∣semblance to the image in her mind Wearied out with the tor∣menting investigation the ex∣hausted artist one day fell into a profound sleep whilst this was passing he saw or thought he saw a female figure presenting herself at the feet of his bed he looked in hopes perhaps to have ob∣tained a model for his image but the lady unluckily concealed her  face at length addressing him in the most courteous stile she de∣sired him to open his eyes get out of bed and take the log that he would find burning on his hearth and set to work upon it and he would find an image to his mind  Becerra  overjoyed lost no time in following her advice he found the log quenched it 'twas a convenient piece of timber and with this supernatural aid com∣pleated a figure to the heart's content of  Isabella  the Monks whose prayers assisted the execu∣tion received the miraculous image with joy it was erected on the high altar of the convent in  Valladolid  with all proper cere∣monials fitting the solemnity it  was habited in the weeds of Queen  Joanna  widow of  Philip the Handsome  and remains to this day not indeed a monument of  Becerra  's art for no part of that is to be seen but of his pa∣tience and proves that however eminent might be his talent for sculpture if it had not been for his faculty of dreaming he would have made a shameful shipwreck of his fame Happy had it been for poor  Torrigiano  if he had had  Becerra  's discretion or  Becerra  's dreams  Antonio Flores  and  Fernando Gallegos  the one of Seville and the other of Salamanca were Painters of great merit and much in the favour of the Emperor  particularly the latter they for∣med themselves in the school of  Alberto Durero  and  Gallegos  co∣pied the manner of his master so closely that many of his pictures cannot be distinguished from  Du∣rero  's Some of his works remain at Salamanca but most of them so impaired by time and by the cloister where they hang that they are become scarce visible Charles the Vth also brought with him into Spain out of Italy the celebrated  Pedro Campana  a Fle∣ming by birth who had studied twenty years in the school of  Ra∣fael Urbin  When Charles made his entry into  Bologna  in the year  Pedro Campana  devised the grand triumphal arch under  which he passed  Campana  soon after came into Spain resid∣ing chiefly at Seville In the chapel of the Purification in that city there is still to be seen a ca∣pital painting by this master on the subject of the ceremony to which the chapel is dedicated a Descent from the Cross and a Nati∣vity both celebrated pictures are yet to be seen in the church of  San Lorenzo  and in the convent of  San Pablo  in a small chapel adjoining to the Chapterhouse there is a picture by  Campana  on the subject of the Circumcision all which are much extolled by  Pacheco  in his treatise on the Art of Painting  Campana  died in the year at Brussels where his  portrait is still to be seen in the Consistory  It was this visit made by the Em∣peror Charles to Bologna in which brought about an event of the first importance in the history of the arts in Spain I mean the introduction of the works of  Titi∣ano  and some time after of  Titiano  himself that great master was in Bologna when Charles made his entry and like Charles was then in the full lustre of his fame scarce a character of eminence in Europe but was to be found on the canvass of  Titiano  to be de∣livered to posterity in the glowing colours of his pencil seemed an object of general ambition and in some degree an anticipation  of immortality  Alonso de Ferra∣ra Federico Gonzaga  Duke of Mantua  Francisco Maria  Duke of Urbino the  Marquis del Basto Pescara Alva Francisco Sforza Antonio de Leyva Diego de Men∣doza Arretino Bembo Fracastorio Ferdinand  King of the Romans and his son  Maximilian  both af∣terwards Emperors the Popes  Six∣tus  IV  Julius  II and  Paulus  III the great Emperor  Soliman  and the Sultaness  Rosa  were amongst the illustrious personages who had been painted by  Titiano  The Em∣peror sate to him at Bologna as he passed through that city in the year above mentioned he was in the meridian of life and though he could not be said to inherit the  beauty of  Philip the Handsome  he was nevertheless of a majestic comely aspect the portrait pleased him well and though so weak an ingredient as vanity was not to be found in Charles's composition yet he was not insensible to im∣pressions and henceforward deter∣mined never to commit his person to any other limner than  Titiano  He was a lover of arts not an en∣thusiast he knew the force of their effects and reverenced them for their power withoutbeing captivated by their charms to men of eminence he was liberal without familiarity in short his affections in this particular as in every other were directed regu∣larly to their object by reason not driven impetuously by constitution  or passion Upon this principle he rewarded  Titiano  for his portrait with a thousand golden scudi consulting thereby no less his own magnificence than the artist's merit he paid him ducats for a small piece and upon  Titi∣ano's  presenting him with a pic∣ture of the Annunciation for which his countrymen the Venetians had refused to pay him more than scudi Charles rewarded him for the present with a thousand He invited  Titiano  into Spain and pressed him to comply using many promises and some intreaties anx∣ious to wrest the palm of glory from the brows of his rival  Fran∣cis  in arts as well as arms he perceived there was no other living  merit but  Titiano  's which he could oppose to that of  Leonardo da Vinci Carlos Rodolfi  the biographer of  Titiano  says he never came into Spain but he is mistaken it was not however till the year that he complied with the Empe∣ror's invitation from that period till he resided in Spain dur∣ing this residence he composed many admirable works and re∣ceived many princely rewards Charles gave him the key the order of  Santiago  at Brussels and in constituted him a Count Palatine of the empire at Barcelona by an instrument worthy to be re∣corded viz Carolus V divinâ fa∣vente clementiâ Romanorum Im∣perator augustus ac Rex Germa∣niae  Hispaniarumque spectabili nostro et imperii sacri

consortu gratanter aggregamus et adscribimus c  These favours alarmed the jealou∣sy of the nobles both of Germany and Spain but their envy drew no other answer from Charles than that he had many nobles in his empire and but one  Titiano  the artist who was at some distance employed upon a picture overheard the retort with conscious satisfaction and as he made his reverence to the Emperor dropt a pencil on the floor the courteous monarch took it up and delivering it to  him confounded by this second mark of his condescension added  that to wait on  Titiano  was a ser∣vice for an Emperor  Charles did not only grace this eminent ar∣tist with the splendid ornaments and titles above mentioned he gave him more solid marks of his favour appointing him rents in Naples of two hundred ducats annually each besides a munifi∣cent compensation for every pic∣ture he executed  Palomino  says that Charles regarded the posses∣sion of a capital piece of  Titiano  more than he did the acquisition of a new province to his domi∣nion but  Palomino  was a painter and more familiar with the pic∣tures of  Titiano  than with the po∣litics  of the Emperor This would have been a caprice unworthy of any prince but Charles's charac∣ter was not the sport of caprice whilst to the very moment of his life when he resigned his domi∣nions it was evident that ambi∣tion was his ruling passion had he been capable of that preference which  Palomino  ascribes to him he would hardly have taken such pains to the last hour of his reign to persuade his brother Ferdinand to make a sacrifice of his succession of the empire nor have retired into the unfurnished cell of his convent with his puppets and his birds without one consolatory re∣membrance of his favourite author to cheer his solitude or to enflame  his devotion I can hardly be persuaded that Charles's abdica∣tion of his empire was any proof of caprice he plainly enough perceived his health was gone and he was not willing that his fame should follow it  Titiano  had quitted Spain be∣fore Philip took possession of the throne the arts however had rapidly advanced Charles had made some improvement to the royal edifices but all with a view to accommodation rather than magnificence he had fronted the old palace of Madrid beautified and repaired the venerable Al∣hambra of Grenada planted and disposed the walks and avenues of Aranjuez in the Flemish taste  and built the Pardo at two leagues distance from the capital in a retired situation and in a stile by no means imperial it is a square building of moderate dimensions flanked with four small towers at the angles and environed with a foss exactly on the scale of a no∣bleman's seat in his native coun∣try Superstition soon engaged Philip in a more important un∣dertaking and having made a vow upon the victory of St Quin∣tin to dedicate a church and mo∣nastery to  San Lorenzo  he began in the midst of a solitary and frightful desart to displace the rocks and compel them to take the shape of an edifice on the feastday of St George with much  temporal and spiritual pomp he laid the foundationstone of the monastery of  San Lorenzo  called the Escorial with the following Inscription  Deus O M operi Aspiciat  Philippus II Hispaniarum Rex  a fundamentis erexit  MDLXIII  Joan  Baptista Architectus  IX Ka MAII  So much has been said on the subject of this extraordinary edi∣fice and the Spanish writers make such a pompous display of its magnificence that I might appear to affect a singularity of opinion if I was to offer freely what my  imperfect judgment suggests on the matter to such of my readers as have seen the Escorial what I should have to say would have little novelty and in their opinions who have not seen it and been taught to respect it it might have too much The scale undoubtedly is magnificent though the mass is graceless as a monastery it is vast and aweful fitly calculated to entomb the living and the dead as a palace it is justly em∣blematic of its founder who on the summit of the superincum∣bent mountain was accustomed to sit and survey his rising fabric in silent contemplation and de∣light  Francisco de los Santos  the monk who wrote a pompous  escription of the Escorial ob∣  erves that the sensation which a  pectator feels upon entering the  reat court is the same as at sud∣  enly hearing a delightful concert  he soul  says he  in both cases is  bsorbed in extasy  what then must  ave been the sensations of Phi∣  ip as he sate upon the top of the  ountain where at one glance he  ook in the whole birdseye of the  difice Certainly if the good Fa∣  her heard a concert upon his en∣  ering only one of the courts of  he monastery His Catholic Ma∣  esty when stationed on the moun∣  ain must have enjoyed a full cho∣  us of musical extasy For my  art taking into consideration the  crupulous performance of his vow  I am inclined to believe his chief pleasure consisted in observing how exactly he had made the building correspond to the  gridiron  of  San Lo∣renzo  this he did in honourable commemoration of the martyrdom of the Saint above mentioned He also took the pious precaution of disposing a number of relics in the balls of the cupolas crosses and different parts of the building to preserve it from fire storm or any other injury These holy pre∣servatives have not been very suc∣cessful in their office for great part of the edifice with not a few of the relics in charge were con∣sumed by a dreadful conflagration Nor is this the only element at war with the Escorial the furious gusts  of wind that occasionally sweep from the impending mountains surpass description The Escorial is placed in the very eddy of these furious gusts as neither man nor beast nor carriages can stand be∣fore them a subterranean passage is cut through the rock under the area of the court for a communi∣cation with the town which is better sheltered from the blast The massy walls of the building are proof against the violence of the storms but the covering of the roof though fortified with all pos∣sible care against the attack con∣tinually exhibits melancholy proofs os its insufficiency whilst the ar∣chitect by disposing the windows to resist the wind seems to have  forgot that one part of their office was to admit the light  If the architect however finds something to condemn the paint∣er will find much to admire It is undoubtedly a repository of noble arts As soon as Philip had con∣ceived the idea of enriching the royal convent with every thing suitable to the magnificence of its scale and which the mines of America that flowed in upon his treasury could procure he cast his eyes towards his father's favourite painter  Titiano  then returned in∣to his own country Whether he solicited him to come again into Spain does not appear but he had certainly given him several com∣missions for pictures In a letter  which Philip writes to  Titiano  of the th of July from Ghent he acknowledges the re∣ceipt of one from  Titiano  of the th of the preceding month and expresses the satisfaction it gave him to hear that he had com∣pleated his picture of Calixtus and one also of Diana bathing He tells him that  he had wrote to Gar∣cias Fernandez at Genoa to forward these pictures for Spain and desires Titiano himself to superintend the backing and to direct the cases that no other of his valuable productions might be again exposed to the like misfortune as had befallen his paint∣ing of the Christ which had been ruined by the way  He earnestly  equests of  Titiano to restore that  loss by another of the same composi∣tion which he shall highly prize as coming from the hand of so great a master  In conclusion he expresses his regret  to hear that the rents settled upon him in Milan and Naples had fallen into arrear  and tells him that  he will put those pay∣ments in such train that there shall be no cause of complaint in future  This in effect he performed by a peremptory mandate to his gover∣nor of Milan directing him to sa∣tisfy the  arrears due to Titiano from the date of the grants in    and    and put the same in regular course of payment for the future either from the Ducal chamber or such other funds as might be more conveniently applied to that purpose  This mandate bears date the th of December and at the foot of it the King writes these lines with his own hand  You know how I am interested in this order as it affects Titiano comply with it therefore in such a manner as to give me no occasion to repeat it  The King had the further attention to continue to him the grant of his Key and nominated him First Painter of the chamber  The pictures which  Titiano  made in Spain and those he sent into Spain form of themselves a large and magnificent collection the catalogues of the Escorial and Madrid give some idea of them but do not nearly reach the amount to particularize their re∣spective  merit is not the object of this work and would be an un∣dertaking far above my hands In a posthumous publication of  Antonio Rafael Mengs  printed at Madrid in there are some observations on  Titiano  's pictures in the palace at Madrid I could wish for the reader's better gra∣tification that more had been said by  Mengs  upon the subject and in general it is to be regretted that he had not entered into a fuller description of the Madrid collection of which he professes to give an account But it is not in these collections of the Escorial and palace of Madrid as I before observed that we can find the sum of  Titiano  's works in Spain  many capital pictures are dispers∣ed many perished in the deplorable fire that destroyed the Pardo some have been by late decree exiled for their dishonesty and some condemned and executed in the flames Amongst the pictures that perished at the Pardo many portraits of the Austrian family were lost toge∣ther with one of  Titiano  himself painted by order of Charles V a celebrated work in which the painter is represented holding in his hand the portrait of Charles transferring by this courtly device the honour of the representation from himself to the Emperor On the subject of the exiles and mar∣tyrs above mentioned I am un∣willing  to enlarge it will suffice to say that being most in the  nude  their crime will in some people's judgment appear their recommendation certain it is that the unparalleled and inestimable figure of the sleeping Venus which was given by Philip the IVth to our Charles the First when Prince of Wales upon the visit he made in Spain and which after the death of that unhappy monarch was purchased by the Spanish am∣bassador in England has been res∣cued from execution by the ad∣dress of  Mengs  I frequently vi∣sited this matchless deity in her hidingplace where I found her miserably lodged though respec∣tably attended by an Atalanta in  the race by  Guido  divinely ex∣ecuted a Helen and Paris by  Rubens  and three Graces of the same master coloured to a mira∣cle but much more  embonpoint  than their principal To attempt any description of this sleeping Venus appears to me as impossi∣ble as it would be to condemn such perfect and withal such modest beauties to the flames a graceful turn of the neck gives the full countenance to the spectator in which the masterartist has dis∣played beauty and sweetness of the divinest sort with the most perfect innocence of character the limbs are elegantly and de∣cently disposed the hues are glow∣ing and transparent the outline  round and glittering and the lo∣cal lights and shades produced by those tender and imperceptible touches that form the  magic  of  Corregio  in short it is a miracle of art and was so decidedly the  chef d'oeuvre  of the master that after several efforts to rival his own matchless work he quitted this selfemulation in despair It is to the honour of  Don Anto∣nio Mengs  that he saved it from destruction It had another escape from the flames of the Pardo which fatal accident being re∣ported to Philip the IVth then on the throne he instantly demanded if the  TitianVenus  had escaped the conflagration the messenger as∣sured him that it was saved  then  replied the King  all other losses may be supported  I cannot dis∣miss this enchanting object with∣out observing that by testimony of all the best judges of its merit it yields in no particular to the Venus of Medicis but in the weaker nature of it's material twice rescued from the flames it still exists in perfect condition May no future age of the world produce a hand to raise an ax against the one or to construct a funeral pile for the other  There are several paintings of  Titiano  in the Madrid collection upon fabulous subjects and in par∣ticular a Tarquin and Lucretia so naturally executed that what be∣tween the excess of chastity in one  prince and the notorious abuse of it in the other it must be owned the lady has had an escape But of all his pictures upon subjects of this description the most beau∣tiful are two celebrated compa∣nions the one a groupe of Bac∣chanals the other of Cupids in the apartments of the Princess the figures in each are of the third part of the natural size In the fore ground of the groupe of Bac∣chanals there is a young female votarist asleep of which  Don An∣tonio Mengs  in his critique above mentioned speaks with rapture he says that he never saw it with∣out that striking novelty of de∣light as if he had never discovered it before The colouring of this  figure he observes is in  Titiano  's clearest manner and the degrada∣tion of tints through the whole groupe which is all in the  nude  and which with an infinite variety of nice discriminations composes one uniform tone is wonderfully contrived and constitutes such a model in the art of colouring as he never met with in any other example he concludes his re∣marks on this picture by observ∣ing that all the harmonious ac∣companiments of sky variegated soil with deep and tender shades of the trees form such an assem∣blage of beautiful objects in na∣ture perfectly imitated that a bet∣ter picture in this stile he does not think the world can produce  The other picture represents a very numerous groupe of beautiful Cu∣pids disposed in a wonderful vari∣ety of attitudes employed in pu∣erile sports under a grove of ap∣pletrees the fruit of which they have scattered about the ground and are playing with in the most gay and natural manner The same curious degradation of hues in the carnations of the flesh and colours of the hair obtains in this picture as in the former and to an equal degree of excellence the same remarks therefore as I have quoted in that case are ap∣plicable to this  Don Antonio Mengs  adds that these pictures were formerly in the Ludovici palace at Rome and were a pre∣sent  to the king of Spain  Sand∣rart  reports of this groupe of Cu∣pids that it served for a study to  Dominiquino Pousin  and  Flamenco Albano  has transcribed a part of this groupe into a composition of his painting and there are two copies made by  Rubens  of these pictures to be seen in the palace the ingenious author above quot∣ed adds with rather too much cri∣tical severity  that these copies of Rubens are like an elegant author translated into Dutch where the sentiments of the original may be guest at but all the grace is va∣nished  Of scriptural subjects treated by the hand of this great master the Escorial presents a host of va∣luable  examples not a few art also to be found in the palace at Madrid the celebrated pic∣ture of the Last Supper in the re∣fectory at the Escorial has been repeatedly described and is known to all Europe as a miracle of art In a letter of  Titiano  to Philip which is preserved he informs the King that he had been seven years employed in painting it this must surely be understood with latitude as to other inter∣mediate compositions for al∣though the artist as it is well known lived to a very uncommon age yet the life of a Patriarch would scarce suffice to warrant undertakings of such labour nor would the reward of golden  scudi which the King sent him by way of Genoa and which was in fact a magnificent price in those times be a proportionable com∣pensation for the dedication of so great a portion of his time  The composition which is call∣ed  la gloria de Titiano  that of Christ in the garden and the Santa Mar∣garita with the Dragon would claim some description if much more capable judges had not al∣ready passed the due encomiums on these excellent performances the scrupulous sanctity of the monks was offended at some li∣berties taken by Santa Margarita in tucking up her robe and dis∣covering part of a very graceful leg a thing not seemly to be  done when in company with a Dragon especially as all Dragons have not the prudence and good faith of that which was in keep∣ing by the Hesperides But  Jor∣dan  's rapid pencil pieced the petti∣coat which now like Raphael's wings  Her feet  Shadows from either heel  Titiano  was born in and consequently was years old when he came into Spain he staid there five years and after Charles's abdication painted many pieces for Philip it is to be ex∣pected therefore that there will be found some tokens of natural  decay in his later works and cer∣tain it is that though his colour∣ing is always good some pictures there are in the royal collection of another pencil from his Venus and far less bright than his slum∣bring Bacchant He prattles some∣times with the privilege of old age but still it is the prattle of Nestor  It is not to be understood that all the pictures of  Titiano  that are in the royal collection were paint∣ed by him whilst he was King's painter to Charles and to Philip Many are of his earlier and better age and were either presented to the Crown or purchased in Italy after the death of  Titiano  An in∣stance of this occurred in the case  of the famous pictures abovementioned extracted from the Lu∣dovice palace which were a pre∣sent to Philip There is also in the sacristy of the Escorial a San Sebastian in his best manner which was given by the  Conde de Bena∣vente  and several pieces of  Titiano  were collected by the great paint∣er  Velazquez  in his excursion to Italy by order of Philip the IVth Whilst Philip the IId was thus solicitous to enrich his royal con∣vent of  San Lorenzo  with the va∣luable works of  Titiano  extracted out of Italy his own kingdom of Spain offered to his choice many eminent professors and disciples in the art the residence of that great master in Spain and the emulation  of contemporary genius roused into action by the study of his brilliant compositions as well as by the introduction of other dis∣tinguished foreigners engaged in compleating and adorning that vast fabric operated to produce an Augustan age in Spain I shall proceed to name some of the prin∣cipal painters as well foreigners as natives who were employed in furnishing and adorning the Esco∣rial  Juan Fernandez Ximenez  of Na∣varre commonly called  El Mudo  or  the Dumb  and generally acknow∣ledged as the  Titiano  of Spain was born at  Logrono  of a respectable family the defects of nature for he was deaf as well as dumb  were in some degree compensated to him by most quick and brilliant sense in the remaining faculties He was first instructed in the art of painting by  Fray Vicente de Santo Domingo  a monk of  Santo Catalina  in a convent at Talavera in Castile of the order of Geroni∣mytes his early marks of genius were such that  Fray Vicente  pro∣posed to the parents of  El Mudo  to send him into Italy which be∣ing accordingly done he travelled to Florence Venice Milan and Naples visiting many of the most famous academies but princi∣pally forming himself in the school of  Titiano  He soon established so general a reputation in Italy that Philip being apprized of his fame  recalled him into Spain and ap∣pointed him one of his painters at the Escorial after having given some sketches of Prophets in black and white in the adornments of the sacristy as samples of his art he proceeded to compositions of greater consequence and paint∣ed the Baptism of our Saviour in the Prior's cell he was after that employed in several paintings for a chapel which King Philip caused to be erected in the wood of Se∣govia these paintings were re∣moved to the upper cloyster of the Escorial and in one of these which represents the beheading of Santiago  El Mudo  has inserted the portrait of Santoyo in the cha∣racter of the Executioner in re∣venge  for some ill offices which that minister had done him San∣toyo complained to the King making suit that the figure might be expunged and his person not delivered to posterity in the dis∣graceful occupation of a hangman the King who probably knew the cause of the offence did not dis∣approve of the nature of the re∣venge and excusing himself to  Santoyo  on account of the excel∣lence of the performance would not allow the picture to be defaced The Twelve Apostles on the great pillars of the church next to the high altar are also painted by  El Mudo  When  Titiano  's famous painting of the Last Supper arrived at the Escorial  El Mudo  was em∣ployed  and upon Philip's propos∣ing to cut the canvass to the size of the pannel in the refectory where it was destined to hang  El Mudo  to prevent the mutilation of so ca∣pital a work made earnest signs of intercession with the King to be permitted to copy it and reduce it to the size of the place allotted offering to do it in the space of six months upon the King's expres∣sing a hesitation on account of the length of the time required by  El Mudo  for the work and pro∣ceeding to put his design in exe∣cution  El Mudo  repeated his sup∣plications in behalf of his favour∣ite master with more fervency than ever offering to compleat his copy in less time than he at first de∣manded  tendering at the same time his head as the punishment of noncompliance laying his hand on his breast as a sign that he claimed the order of  Santiago  as his reward if he should succeed the offer was not accepted and execution was performed upon  Ti∣tiano  accompanied with the most distressful attitudes and distortions of  El Mudo  He died soon after at the Escorial to the great regret of Philip at the age of in the year generally intitled the  Titiano  of Spain and was honour∣ed with an epitaph by  Fra Lope Feliz de Vega Carpio  El Divino Morales  was born at Badajoz in the province of Estre∣madura in the beginning of the  sixteenth century He was in∣structed at Seville in the academy of  Pedro Campana  a disciple of  Raphael  from his constant choice of divine subjects and the ex∣treme delicacy of his pencil he acquired the appellation of  El Di∣vino  and is known to the present age by no other name than that of  El Divino Morales  All his paint∣ings are upon board or copper and almost generally heads of the crucified Saviour no instance oc∣curring of his having executed any composition or figure at full length His heads are finished off with infinite care and laboured to the utmost yet not so as to dimi∣nish the force of the expression for I have seen some examples of  his  Ecce Homo  of a most exquisite and touching character also some heads of the Christ bearing the cross approaching very near to the Saviour in the famous  Pasmo de Sicilia  Though  Morales  never fails to impress the countenance with the deepest tints of human agony I never met with any instance of his doing violence to our ideas of the divinity of the object he re∣presents His conception of the countenance seems to be original and his own more resembling however the face of the Christ in  Raphael  's picture abovemention∣ed than any other and worked as it appears to me after the man∣ner of the highlyfinished heads of  Leonardo da Vinci  He was un∣doubtedly  an artist of a very li∣mited invention and design in aerial perspective and the clear∣obscure I have sometimes found him evidently deficient nor has he any tincture of art or academy in grouping his figures and dis∣posing his attitudes every thing is left to a simple expression of af∣fecting nature His  Mater dolorosa  is the very extreme of sorrow nor is he anxious to maintain any trace of beauty amidst his expressions of affliction I am of opinion that no imagination which had not been aided by the spectacles of exhaust∣ed nature which a nunnery ex∣hibits could have devised an ob∣ject so extremely woebegone It is in short the aggravated por∣trait  of an emaciated devotee ex∣piring in her vigils It may rea∣dily be believed in a country where paintings of this sort are amongst the objects of devotion and where every private house is furnished with its oratory and its altar that the pictures of  Morales  must have been in general request it has been for the same reason extremely difficult for travellers to extract out of Spain any piece of this author and as he worked very slowly and was not very industri∣ous or interested in his art his pictures are both very rare and ve∣ry permanent in their stations  Since this book went to the press I have received out of Spain an  Ecce Homo  by  Morales  painted upon stone which was affixed to a private oratory in the house of the Duque de Osuna and transmitted to me by the favour of that distinguished Grandee    Enough may be had of illegiti∣mate or suspicious pretensions but in general they are easily to be dis∣tinguished One would expect to find in  Morales  's private life a character in unison with his stu∣dies but the contrary of this ap∣pears from his history When  Morales  was summoned to the Es∣corial by Philip he left Badajoz at the King's command and put∣ting himself in the best array that his whole substance could procure presented himself to the sovereign more like an Ambassador upon the  delivery of his credentials than a rural artist called to labour at his profession for hire Upon the King's remarking on the unex∣pected splendor of his appear∣ance he answered with an air of national gallantry that being re∣solved to dedicate every thing he possest by nature or by fortune to the service of his sovereign he had presented himself in the best condition and attire that his means admitted in obedience to his sum∣mons It does not appear that his reply displeased neither was the King dissatisfied with his per∣formances for which he liberally rewarded him However when upon completion of his undertak∣ings he returned to Badajoz he  seems to have carried home the same spirit of extravagance for when Philip passed through that place in on his way to take pos∣session of the kingdom of Portu∣gal  Morales  presented himself in a far different condition reduced by poverty and age for he was then years old  Morales  says the King  methinks you are grown very old since last I saw you True Sen̄or  replied he  and also very poor  Philip of whom the arts at least have nothing to complain directly turning to the city trea∣surer ordered him ducats telling him it was to purchase him a dinner  and a supper too  said  Morales No  answered the King  give him a hundred ducats more  a  fortunate rencounter for poor  Mo∣rales  He survived this event some years and died in Some of his paintings are preserved at Cor∣dova and Seville and at Madrid in the chapel of  our Lady of the Soledad  belonging to the convent of the Trinitarians I have been shewn a  Santa Veronica  by his hand There is also an  Ecce Homo  in the convent of the nuns of Corpus Christi which with other specimens I have met in private cabinets confirm to me his title to the appellation of  El Divino  Miguel Barroso  a disciple of  Becerra  and  Domingo Beltran  the Jesuit a native of Victoria were men of eminent talents they were both excellent architects and of  great erudition The former was employed at the Escorial in paint∣ing part of the principal cloyster the latter who had formed him∣self in Italy executed some sta∣tues in the great church of admi∣rable workmanship and in the grande gusto of  Michael Angelo Beltran  also carved a crucisix for the high altar at the Imperial col∣lege lately occupied by the Je∣suits at Madrid a work of infinite merit and expression there is another on the high altar of the college at Alcala de Henares which I have not seen but which is no less celebrated Both these ingenious artists died in the year both were men of amiable  manners great candour and re∣markable modesty  The same year was also fatal to  Teodosio Mingot  the Catalan a dis∣ciple of  Michael Angelo  and  Luis de Carvajal  of Toledo both emi∣nent painters and both employed at the Escorial Part of the prin∣cipal cloyster is painted by  Carva∣jal  and amongst the paintings in the church specimens of a respect∣able sort are to be found of both these masters  But amongst the principal ar∣tists employed by Philip in the paintings of the Escorial the Elder  Coello  was one in the chief favour and esteem of that sove∣reign who in his letters stiles him  Titiano Portugues  for he was of  that nation and addresses him by the affectionate appellation of my beloved son  Alonso Sanchez Coello  He studied at Rome in the school of  Rafael de Urbino  and compleat∣ed himself in his art under the in∣struction of  Antonio Moro  in Spain he passed from Spain into Portu∣gal and was in the service of Don Juan and afterwards of his widow Donna Juana sister of Philip the second Upon the retirement of Antonio Moro the King of Spain solicited his sister to supply the loss of that great artist by send∣ing him  Coello  upon his arrival at the court Philip lodged him in an apartment near at hand with which he had a private communi∣cation for the purpose of visiting  him whilst he was at work On these occasions he treated  Coello  with great familiarity and conde∣scension he was in such favour with all the Royal family that his apartment became at times their general rendezvous and in these visits  Coello  made several portraits of Philip on foot and horseback and of all the Royal or distin∣guished personages that composed the court In short he became considered as a man in such high degree of favour that his protec∣tion was lookt up to by the Cour∣tiers and Grandees and his house and table frequented by the first persons in the nation not except∣ing Cardinal Grambela Don Gas∣par de Zueroga archbishop of To∣ledo  and Don Rodrigo de Castro archbishop of Seville  Coello  was no less in favour with Pope Gre∣gory the XIIIth and Sixtus Quin∣tus with the Dukes of Florence and Savoy Cardinal Farnese and many other illustrious characters of that time After endowing a cha∣ritable foundation for the reception of poor orphans at Valladolid  Co∣ello  died in the sixtyfifth year of his age in an aera fatal to the arts in Spain  If  Coello  cannot properly be considered as a native of Spain he must be acknowledged to rank high amongst the chief artists who have flourished in that king∣dom His paintings in the Esco∣rial which are chiefly of Saints af∣fixed  to the respective altars do great honour to his memory the portrait that he made of the great patriarch San Ignacio drawn from an impression of his face taken in wax after his death is much ce∣lebrated and his original figures of Sisiphus and Titius as well as his copies from  Titiano  of Tanta∣lus and Ixion now in the palace of Madrid are noble specimens His portraits of many royal and noble persons which are spoken of as excellent perished with many other of his capital works in the unfortunate fire of the Par∣do of all which survive the prin∣cipal in point of composition is preserved in the church of San Geronimo in Madrid represent∣ing  the martyrdom of San Sebas∣tian on the right hand of the Saint stands the figure of Christ on the left the Virgin Mary and lower in the front San Bernardo and San Francisco above a glory and a fi∣gure representing El Padre Eter∣no the whole is executed with great majesty of design a bold re∣lief and a strong and masterly ex∣pression He colours in the stile of  Titiano  and seems to draw with great facility and freedom He died universally regretted by the artists lamented by Philip who regarded him highly and cele∣brated by the famous  Lopez de Vega  who wrote his epitaph  Philip in the decline of fortune and life by the death of  Coello  lost  his best and perhaps only resource against the vexations of state and the intrusions of remorse Haugh∣ty by nature and harsh through disappointment there were still some moments when his pride sought the relief of familiarity and when his temper for a while relaxed into complacency In those moments he would mount the ladder the only one he ever climbed without ambition or dis∣grace that privately communi∣cated with the paintingroom of  Coello  Philip had deserved well of the arts and in company with them he found himself for once amongst his friends  Coello  had dis∣cretion good manners and much acquaintance with the world if  the King encouraged conversa∣tion  Coello  knew every body and every thing and out of those could chuse his topics suitably and treat them agreeably if the King was disposed to silence during his visit as was frequently the case  Coello  pursued his work with fixt atten∣tion he pressed his canvass into life with all the energy and spirit of his genius The king sate by contemplating the new creation which the hand of art was forming in his sight and for a while per∣haps forgot the breaches he had caused in that of nature's produ∣cing By the easel of  Coello  if he was not defended from the cares he was at least secure from the in∣trusions of Royalty Whoever has  been accustomed to look on du∣ring the operations of industry or art must have experienced a re∣pose of thought an interval from worldly inquietude that steals in∣sensibly and gradually upon the mind as sleep does on the body If such are our sensations whilst contemplating the labourer at his task or the mechanic at his trade how much do we improve the avo∣cation when the eye is called off from every other object and fixed upon one of the most pleasing and surprizing in the whole circle of human arts and inventions We may naturally believe that Philip felt the benefits of this resource In his councilchamber the defec∣tion of provinces galled his pride  and the dispersion of armadas thwarted his ambition In his closet the injured Perez stung his conscience and the unhappy Don Carlos haunted his imagination but in the academy of  Coello  he saw himself in his most favourable light and perhaps the only one which can reflect a lustre on his memory  The great works which Philip was carrying on at the Escorial and the magnificent collection of paintings he was there amassing at∣tracted the attention of all the ar∣tists in Europe whilst the wealth and munificence of the King held out ample encouragement to ad∣venturers of merit Spain at that brilliant aera was in possession of  many native painters who had they been happy enough to have found an historian to have done justice to their fame would at this day have ranked with the most dis∣tinguished masters of the age in Italy but their names are buried in the obscurity of time and their works in that of cloysters and con∣vents  Philip pressed his favourite un∣dertaking with such ardour and the immeasurable walls of the con∣vent of  San Lorenzo  offered such a field for emulation that the har∣vest could not be reaped by natives only however numerous so that to conclude the work within the period of his reign it was necessa∣ry to call in the assistance of more  labourers and a great body of in∣genious emigrants accepted the invitation My design is to pre∣sent the reader with a few local anecdotes relative to the principal characters of this description the gleanings of their better history which in general is so well known as to make any more diffusive re∣lation superfluous and imperti∣nent  In selecting these I shall princi∣pally follow the order of time in which they flourished for the pre∣sent however confining myself to the reign of Philip the IId  Antonio Moro  Sir Antony More the predecessor and pre∣ceptor of the elder  Coello  above mentioned was born at Utrecht  where in the early years of his life he studied in the school of  Juan Escorelio  from thence he passed into Italy where he ultimately formed himself upon the models of the great masters  Michael An∣gelo  and  Rafael de Urbino  He came into Spain Charles V being then on the throne under the protection of his countryman Cardinal Grambeli he made a portrait of Prince Philip and being recommended by the Cardi∣nal to the service of the Emperor he was sent by him into Portugal to take the portrait of the Prin∣cess Donna Maria then contract∣ed to Philip At the same time he painted John III of Portugal and his queen Donna Catalina  Charles's youngest sister by all which portraits he gave entire sa∣tisfaction and was magnificently rewarded both by Charles and the Royal personages abovemention∣ed Having succeeded so well in this commission he was next dis∣patcht by the Emperor into Eng∣land to the court of Mary to take the portrait of that princess previous to her espousals with Phi∣lip  Moro  employed all the flat∣tering aids of his art in this por∣trait and so captivated the cour∣tiers of Spain with the charms of Mary's person that he was em∣ployed by his patron the Cardinal and many of the Grandees to make copies of his picture one of which I have seen in possession of a noble  family and by which it should appear that  Moro  was not only a very good painter but an excel∣lent courtier Having enriched himself by his embassy to Eng∣land he returned into Spain upon the conclusion of peace between that kingdom and France and was eagerly received into the ser∣vice of Philip II then on the throne His excellence in the painting of portraits supplied him with ample employ in this court Philip who made slaves of his friends and friends of his painters treated  Moro  with extraordinary familiarity This great artist had not all the courtly disoretion of his scholar  Coello  and met the King's advances with the same ease  that they were made so that one day whilst he was at his work and Philip looking on  Moro  dipt his pencil in carmine and with it smeared the hand of the King who was resting his arm on his shoulder The jest was rash and the character to which it was applied not to be played upon with impunity the hand of the Sovereign of Spain which even the fair sex kneel down to salute was never so treated since the foundation of the monarchy the King surveyed it seriously a while and in that perilous moment of suspence the fate of  Moro  balan∣ced on a hair the courtiers who were in awful attendance revolt∣ed from the sight with horror and  amazement could  Luca Jordano  have seized the groupe in that mo∣ment and dashed it off with his rapid facility what a subject for a painter caprice or I would ra∣ther say pity turned the scale and Philip passed the silly action off with a smile of complacency The painter dropping on his knees eagerly seized those of the King and kissed his seet in humble a∣tonement for the offence and all was well or seemed at least so to be but the person of the King was too sacred in the consideration of those times and the act too daring to escape the notice of the awful office of the Inquisition these holy and enlightened Fathers maturely weighing all the cir∣cumstances  of the case learnedly concluded that  Antonio Moro  be∣ing a foreigner and a traveller had either learnt the art magic or obtained in England some spell or charm wherewith he had bewicht the King Nor let the heretical reader treat this story as a fiction or think that the Fathers accord∣ing to the premises on which their judgments then were and still are formed reasoned much amiss for a disbelief in witches is a spe∣cies of criminal infidelity to the present moment condemnable at that sacred tribunal of which I could give a late very notable ex∣ample if it was proper to make public a gentleman's disgrace for which he has suffered punishment  and of which it is hoped he has duly repented If  Antonio  had contended that he practised no other charms upon Philip than those of his art which over some minds has a kind of bewitching influence such a plea would scarce have passed with his judges whose hearts were far out of reach of such mechanical fascination and as little would it have served his cause to plead the natural gaiety and goodhumour of the Monarch such an argument would have been fairly set down amongst those  quae non admittuntur  so that his con∣demnation would have been ine∣vitable for as it is hard to sup∣pose how any man could daub the fingers of a King of Spain with  carmine unless by the correspon∣dence and conspiracy of the De∣vil or some of his agents in witchcraft no doubt the tragedy of poor  Torregiano  would have been revived on this occasion had not the same Devil in the shape of one of Philip's ministers luckily snatcht  Antonio  from his fate whilst the tortures were preparing to force out the impious secrets of his black and diabolic art This same minister of Philip or I should rather say of the Devil spirited away his brother imp of darkness to Brussels without loss of time upon the feigned pre∣tence which on such occasions is readily enough supplied to the wicked of an immediate and pres∣sing  avocation It was in vain that Philip moved him to revoke his resolution in vain that he so∣licited him by letters under his own hand expressed in terms the most kind and condescending and declarations even of affection to his person as well as of esteem for his talents the terrors of a tribunal from which even the Royal hand that he had so fami∣liarly treated could not snatch him weighed down all the ca∣resses all the solicitations of the King and he departed loaded with the rewards of Philip's muni∣ficence and penetrated with the proofs of his complacency and in∣dulgence He left many por∣traits and some historical pieces in  the Royal collection but most of them perished at the Pardo  As the elder  Coello  supplied the loss of  Antonio Moro  in the list of Philip's painters so that of  El Mudo  was filled by  Luqueto  or  Lucas Cambiaso  or according to Spanish orthography  Cangiaso  of Genoa one of the most celebrated painters of his time His principal work at the Escorial is the roof of the choir for which it is re∣corded that he received the sum of ducats a work of infinite labour consisting of a vast multi∣tude of the blest received into heaven with a great host of angels surrounding the holy Trinity plac∣ed in the center of the groupe The disposition of these figures is  void of all grace or art as to picturesque effect being seated re∣gularly upon benches one behind the other a direct counterpart of the reverend Fathers below The whole composition presents to the spectator's eye one living range of heads amongst these the painter has taken the liberty of introduc∣ing his own and that of his friend  Fra Antonio de Villacartin  Con∣sidering it as a pavement of faces worked by the square yard  Lucas Cangiaso  has executed his com∣mission like an able and honest mechanic the honour of the de∣sign is due to certain Theologians of the time who regarding the beauty of effect with pious con∣tempt considered only how to  dispose the assembly in decent form and order most resembling as I before observed the congregation of the monks in the choir King Charles the IId would have en∣gaged  Luca de Jordano  to under∣take the repainting it to dispose it after his own fancy and design but that painter excused himself from the task probably for other reasons than the respect he pre∣tended to entertain for the merit and superior excellence of the ori∣ginal  Lucas Cangiaso  was accom∣panied out of Italy by  Lazaro Ta∣baron  and his brother  Horatio Can∣giaso  on whom Philip settled pro∣portionable appointments  Lucas  died at the Escorial much enrich∣ed  by the munificence of the King by whom he was highly favoured  Mateo Perez de Alesio  a Roman by birth was amongst the many eminent foreigners that migrated into Spain during the reign of Philip though I do not find that he came thither by invita∣tion of the King or that he exe∣cuted any thing at the Escorial His great work was a magnificent fresco on the subject of St Chris∣topher in the cathedral of Seville which those who have visited that church speak of with rapture It will be sufficient for me to ob∣serve of this artist whose history authors of better information have already recorded that after abid∣ing  some time in Spain where he was held in universal estimation he departed for Italy candidly de∣claring that a country in posses∣sion of so great a living master as  Luis de Vargas  then residing at Seville of which place he was na∣tive could not be benefited by his talents nor needed his assist∣ance and so high was the opi∣nion he conceived of  Vargas  's su∣perior merits that one day whilst he was contemplating a picture by that artist of Adam and Eve and observing upon the masterly fore∣shortening of some of the parts  that single limb  said he pointing to the leg of Adam  is more worth than my whole Saint Christopher  alluding to the great fresco paint∣ing  abovementioned On which artist of the two this testimony reflects most honour I leave with the reader to determine  Federico Zucaro  is well known to all who are conversant in the histories of the Italian masters the dissatisfaction that his perform∣ances in Spain gave to Philip is no less notorious insomuch that his works were removed out of the Escorial by order of that King and his fresco paintings in the cloyster replaced by others of  Pe∣regrino Tibaldi  Whether Philip's expectations were raised too high by the report his emissaries in Italy had made of  Zucaro  's ta∣lents or whether the vanity of the man disgusted him which might  well be the case so it was that of all the artists employed at the Es∣corial he alone fell short in exe∣cution and failed of success At the same time that Philip dis∣missed him from his service he compensated him in so princely a manner for his undertaking that I am inclined to think upon the evi∣dence of some letters which pass∣ed between the King and his am∣bassador at Rome  Don Juan de Zuniga  and the  Conde de Olivares  that the payments made to  Zucaro  were larger than to any other painter which came into Spain but however he might profit in respect of interest he certainly was a considerable loser in point of re∣putation by his adventure  Sen̄or  says  Zucaro  as he was displaying a painting of the Nativity for the great altar at the Escorial  you now behold all that art can execute be∣yond this which I have done the powers of painting cannot go  The King was silent for a time and so unmoved that neither approba∣tion nor contempt could be deter∣mined from the expression of his countenance at last preserving still the same indifference he ask∣ed if those were eggs which one of the shepherds in the act of running carried in his basket the painter answered him they were  'Tis well he did not break them  said the King and turned away the picture was dismissed Upon another occasion when Philip ex∣pressed  his dissatisfaction with a composition  Zucaro  had made up∣on the subject of the Visitation he excused himself by saying it was painted by his scholars Philip desired him to paint the same sub∣ject with his own hand he did so and the second work fell short of the first and Philip remained still more dissatisfied than before At length he gave him his dismission paying him as I before observed with an extraordinary munificence  Antonio El Obrero  who had been instrumental in recommending him to the King kissed his Ma∣jesty's hand on the occasion and re∣turned him thanks for his extraor∣dinary bounty to  Zucaro It is not Zucaro replied the King that is in  fault the blame is their's who re∣commended him Peregrin Tibaldi  or  Peregrin of Bologna  was a co∣pyist of the grand stile of  Michael Angelo  and as  Palomino  informs us his scholar but according to the testimony of  Zanoti  whose au∣thority is to be preferred he stu∣died under  Bagnacabalo  Philip sent for him to paint the lower cloyster of the Escorial in fresco having expunged the unsuccessful attempts of  Zucaro Peregrino  ac∣quitted himself of this invidious task to the entire satisfaction of his royal employer the figures are models of correctness and drawn in a free and masterly stile with great attention to truth and nature In these paintings he has  treated the subjects of the Purifi∣cation the Flight into Egypt the Slaughter of the Innocents Christ in the Temple the Temptations in the Wilderness the Election of the Apostles the Resurrection of La∣zarus the Expulsion of the Mo∣neychangers out of the Temple and the various passages of the Passion and Resurrection of the Saviour with other subjects of sa∣cred history The cloyster is of the conventual sort sad and gloomy and neither very spacious nor lof∣ty it was when I saw it very un∣cleanly and I found it in the same condition upon repeated visits The frescos have received great injury not only from time and climate but from actual violence  and notorious want of care their effect in my opinion is by no means pleasing whether owing to the cause abovementioned or the dry harsh uniformity of the co∣louring of a red and bricky hue unrelieved by any accompaniment or compartment and the sizes dis∣proportionate to the cloyster which as I before observed is neither lofty nor wide I have no doubt they would make a conspicuous fi∣gure as engravings and the date of their existence might be there∣by prolonged but that I conceive will reach its final period without reprieve of this or any other sort Several paintings of  Peregrino  are to be seen in the great church particularly a St Michael with the  Fall of the Angels a Martyrdom of San Lorenzo and two very grand compositions of the Nati∣vity and Adoration which he exe∣cuted to replace those of  Zucaro  on the same subjects which Philip had rejected The paintings in the Sagrario are by  Peregrino  on the subject of Abraham and Mel∣chisedech but what above all things else establishes his reputa∣tion in Spain is the cieling of the Library In this composition the painter has personified the Arts and Sciences in different compart∣ments the four Doctors of the church with several eminent an∣tient philosophers Socrates Plato Aristotle and Seneca accompanied with all their proper attributes and  insignia interspersed with many beautiful groupes of children and figures in the nude supporting the cornice and festoons in various postures and foreshortenings of grand force and expression in the stile of  Michael Angelo  in perfect drawing and admirable perspective  Peregrino  was liberally rewarded by Philip and returning to Italy died at Milan in aged years  In the same year died  Romuh Cincinnato  the Florentine he also was one of Philip's painters and contributed to illuminate this aera of arts and sciences by a residence of many years in Spain during which he made many excellent paintings particularly in fresco not only in the Escorial but also  at Guadalaxara in the palace of the Duque del Infantado a gran∣dee of an illustrious family In the Escorial part of the great cloy∣ster is painted by  Romulo Cincin∣nato  in the church there are seve∣ral of his paintings particularly one of San Geronimo reading and another of the same Saint dic∣tating to his disciples and in the choir two fresco paintings taken from passages in the life of San Lorenzo also a picture in the chapel of San Mauricio apper∣taining to that church In the Je∣suits' church at Cuenca there is a Circumcision of his painting great∣ly celebrated particularly for the admirable effect in the foreshorten∣ing of one of the figures which  is represented with his back turn∣ed to the spectator of this he was so conscious that he is reported to have declared that he prized one limb of this figure above all his paintings in the Escorial He died in the year in an ad∣vanced age universally esteemed and lamented  In this year  Caesar Arbasia  came into Spain upon the invitation of  Pablo de Cespedes  canon of Cordo∣va with whom he had formed an intimacy at Rome He re∣mained in Cordova long enough to paint the cieling of the cathe∣dral and returned into Italy  Bartolome de Carducho  accompa∣nied his master  Zucaro  into Spain and was employed in the Escori∣al  He was a native of Florence and of great eminence in his art he was concerned with  Peregrin de Bolonia  in painting the famous cieling of the library the figures of Aristotle Euclid Archimedes and Cicero are his and do him high honour both for their execu∣tion and design Part of the fresco in the cloysters is of his painting and gave entire satisfaction to Phi∣lip who rewarded him with two hundred ducats over and above his salary and when  Carducho  was in∣vited into France by order of his most Christian Majesty Philip ex∣prest such regret at the proposal of his departure that he excused himself to the French Ambassador  n the handsomest manner he could  and continued in Spain There is no doubt but  Carducho  passed some time at Valladolid where several of his pictures are remaining he painted also some pictures for the palace of Madrid particularly one of the Last Supper and another on the subject of the Circumcision which is an excellent performance but the picture which of all others establishes his reputation in Spain is a Descent from the Cross which now hangs in a small chapel near the side door of the church of San Phelipe el Real in Madrid a piece of such superior execution that it may well be taken for one of  Ra∣phael  's In the church of San Ge∣ronimo in the second chapel on the right hand there is an excellent  figure of San Francisco the sera∣phic Patriarch in which accord∣ing to custom he is represented wounded there is also in the chapel of the old palace at Segovia a very respectable composition of this painter on the subject of the Adoration of the Magi and ano∣ther over it with the supposed re∣presentation of the  Padre Eterno Carducho  continued in Spain seve∣ral years after the death of Philip the second and was appointed by the succeeding King Philip the third to paint a gallery in the pa∣lace of the Pardo the subject was to be taken from the life and ac∣tions of the Emperor Charles  Car∣ducho  begun the work but died at the Pardo aged years before  he had made any great progress in the completion of it His brother  Vicencio  who had studied with him undertook to finish the gallery which he did but took the history of Achilles instead of that of Charles the Vth  Barto∣lome Carducho  was not only an eminent painter but a statuary and architect he was also a man of an exemplary character patient and content with a little a hard student and exceedingly industri∣ous in his profession He was much in favour with Philip the IId and his son but he does not appear to have shared much of their liberality though we hear of a gratuity from Philip the IId of which I have already  taken notice He died in the year  I have now enumerated the most eminent painters employed by Philip the IId in the Royal monastery of San Lorenzo it re∣mains to say something of the con∣temporary artists who were not engaged in his service at the Esco∣rial and of these one of the first in time and of the most distin∣guished in point of merit was the celebrated  Blas de Prado  a Casti∣lian born in the neighbourhood of Toledo and educated in the academy of  Berruguete  Some of his paintings are to be found in the city of Toledo particularly in the chapel dedicated to San Blas but in general they have  suffered great injury by length of time and unfavourable exposures in the churches and convents at Madrid I have been shewn some compositions of  Blas de Prado  particularly in the parish church of San Pedro a Descent from the Cross which is evidently the work of a great master In the early part of his life he passed into Africa upon the solicitation of the Emperor of Morocco to take a portrait of his daughter and pas∣sed some time at that court in high favour returning into Spain much enriched by his expedition  Blas de Prado  died at the age of in the year in the city of Madrid  Sofonisba Angusciola  of Cremona with her three sisters passed some  years in Spain in the houshold of Queen Isabella I have seen a let∣ter written by  Sofonisba  to Pope Pius the fourth dated from Ma∣drid the th of September transmitting a portrait of the Queen above mentioned the receipt of which his Holiness acknowledges by an answer from Rome of the th day of the succeeding month highly extolling her performance and assuring her that he has placed it amongst his most select pictures expressing at the same time much paternal affection for the illustri∣ous lady which it so exactly re∣presents  Palomino  thinks that  Sofonisba  died at Madrid in aged somewhat more than fifty years this circumstance he men∣tions  doubtfully but perhaps it is cleared up by  Vasari  whose ac∣count of her I have not read These examples will serve to shew that the fair sex had their share of fame at this illustrious aera of the arts the religious orders also sub∣scribed to the national stock of genius many eminent names in particular Father  Nicolas Fattor  a Franciscan monk born in the city of Valencia  Pablo de Cespedes  of Cordova a dignitary in that church Father  Francisco Galeas  of the or∣der of Carthusians a native of Seville and Father  Juan de la Mi∣seria  a Carmelite friar by birth a Neapolitan of these  Cespedes  was the most eminent a man of such diffusive talents that there is  scarce a branch of literature in which he was not profoundly versed He had a deep knowledge of the oriental and classic lan∣guages and spoke several of the living ones He composed many works which his modesty with∣held from the world and some that he published Amongst the latter is a treatise on the antiquities of his church proving it to have been a temple of Janus and ex∣plaining many emblems and in∣scriptions in proof of his position In the art of painting whether in respect of theory or practice  Ces∣pedes  holds his rank with the very first names Spain has to boast of in pursuit of this study he went twice to Rome and formed his  stile upon the model of the great  Michael Angelo  not in painting only but in architecture and sculp∣ture also in both which by the happy fertility of his genius he acquired great fame It was his practice to model the heads of his principal figures when he was en∣gaged in any great historical com∣position and several of these are yet to be found in his native city of Cordova When he was at Rome he supplied a head to a fa∣mous antique trunk of his country∣man Seneca in white marble and acquitted himself so happily in this arduous undertaking that he was generally thought to have ex∣celled the original and in testi∣mony of his triumph the Romans  caused to be engraved upon it the following words  Victor it Spag∣nuolo  He composed a treatise in which he compares the antient and modern art and practice of paint∣ing His contemporaries speak of this work in high strains but it is unfortunately lost to the world together with one in verse on the general subject of painting for the talents of this extraordinary man amidst the circle of arts and sciences which they embraced are reported to have excelled in that of poetry  Cespedes  composed several pictures during his resi∣dence at Rome and in the church of the Holy Trinity he was em∣ployed amongst the principal art∣ists of the time and left there  some paintings in fresco of distin∣guished excellence Amongst these artists  Federico Zucaro  was engaged with whom  Cespedes  formed an in∣timate and lasting friendship as I have been led to give some in∣stances of  Zucaro  's vanity on a former occasion I am more happy in recording to the credit of his candour and modesty that when he was applied to by the Bishop and Chapter of Cordova for a painting of Santa Margarita to be affixed to the high altar of the cathedral he peremptorily de∣clined the commission giving for answer that while  Pablo de Ces∣pedes  was in Spain there would be no occasion to send into Italy for pictures Though the works of  Cespedes  are dispersed in Seville and the cities of Andalusia it is in Cordova that we must expect to find his principal performances particularly his famous composi∣tion of the Last Supper in the high church  Palomino  gives this picture great commendation for the nice discrimination of charac∣ters in Christ and his disciples and relates a circumstance of the dis∣gust which  Cespedes  conceived from the silly adoration of some of his countrymen who were so en∣chanted with the execution of some vases and jars of porcelain intro∣duced into the piece that they to∣tally overlooked the superior parts of the composition and this be∣ing repeated upon several visits by  the mob of spectators which the fame of so great a work drew to∣gether it angered him to that de∣gree that he would have pro∣ceeded to strike out all these sub∣servient ornaments from his piece is he had not been diverted from his purpose by the intreaties of his friends and the submission of these false and contemptible admirers As a colourist Spain never pro∣duced a painter superior to  Ces∣pedes  In anatomy drawing and perspective he was peculiarly cor∣rect His angels in the Martyr∣dom of Santa Catalina a picture which he painted for the late Je∣suits' college at Cordova are touch∣ed with all the colouring and ef∣fect of  Coregio  whom he much  resembled in those particulars This great man is no less cele∣brated for his extraordinary virtue modesty and humility than for the variety and extent of his ge∣nius he died at Cordova in being turned of seventy and is interred in the cathedral under a stone on which the following words are engraved viz  Paulus de Ces∣pedes hujus almae ecclesiae Porcio∣narius Picturae sculpturae archi∣tecturae omniumque bonarum artium variarumque linguarum peritissimus hic situs est obiit anno Dom MDCVIII septimo Kalendas Sex∣tilis  Of the other religious art∣ists before mentioned Father  Ni∣colas Fattor  died in the year after being admitted to a conver∣sation  in person with our Lady of Atocha  Francisco Galeas  died in and  Juan de la Miseria  two years after him This lastmen∣tioned person travelled into Spain as a hermit to visit the tomb of the holy apostle Saint James and coming afterwards to Madrid was taken into protection of the court and received into the house of  Alonso Sanchez Coello  painter and favourite of Philip the IId with whom he studied several years and painted many excellent pictures chiefly portraits amongst these one which he was admitted to draw of the person of Santa Te∣resa the nun by which he gained great reputation and another of the most blessed Virgin with which  he is said to have performed many miracles  Luis de Vargas  was one of the greatest painters of the sixteenth century he was born in Seville and studied painting in Italy as well as in his own country he returned to Seville after seven years residence at Rome and find∣ing himself excelled in his art by  Antonio Florez  and  Pedro Campana  he returned without delay back to Rome and after serving another apprenticeship of seven years to his art returned so compleat a master that the famous  Perez de Alesio  contemplating his picture of our First Parents in the cathe∣dral of Seville exclaimed in rap∣ture at the performance that one  limb of the Adam of  de Vargas  was worth more than the whole composition of his colossal Saint Christopher and returning into Italy soon after gave that remark∣able testimony of his own candour and the merit of  de Vargas  of which we have before taken no∣tice  There are several paintings by  de Vargas  in the famous cathedral of Seville particularly in the tow∣er which was his last work  Luis de Vargas  was not less remark∣able for his devotion than for his talents and following the exam∣ple of the great emperor Charles he used at his private hours to deposit himself in a coffin which he kept in his closet and in that  posture pursue his meditation up∣on death This event for which he used such edifying preparation took place in the year  In endeavouring to apportion their due degrees of merit to the several Spanish painters of this aera so fruitful in arts I sensibly feel the insufficiency of descrip∣tion and have more than once desisted from my work in despair of giving any thing to the world worth its notice and acceptance The description of a picture like that of a battle rarely brings its object before the reader though it be ever so scientifically exe∣cuted I know no method of speaking intelligibly on the sub∣ject of any particular Spanish  painter whose name and character are unknown to the rest of Eu∣rope except by comparing him with some artist of general noto∣riety and yet Spain has produced some whose manner is so much their own that it will not be il∣lustrated by any known compari∣son of this sort was the great artist whom I am next to men∣tion  Juan Bau  a  Juanes  a na∣tive of Valencia a man whose ce∣lebrity would rank with that of the first artists of the age of Leo X if his works laid in the track of travellers or by happy emanci∣pation could be set at liberty and made to circulate through the ca∣binets of Europe  Juanes  like  Morales  selected his subjects  without an instance to the contrary from the most sacred passages of revelation but his life unlike that of  Morales  was in unison with the purity and austerity of his taste prepared by confession and fasting he first approached the al∣tar before he visited the easel painting with him was an act of piety and devotion The charac∣ters which filled his canvass were of the holiest sort and as he gave them life he gave them adoration As the exercise of his art was in him an office of devotion so his moderation kept him from en∣gaging in any private commissions with a view to gain and I am inclined to doubt if any picture of  Juanes  is at this hour in lay pos∣session  Both  Pacheco  and  Lauren∣tio Surio  give him high encomi∣ums these he most unquestionably merits but credulity will never go such lengths upon their autho∣rity or that of  Palomino  as to rank him not only before  Morales  but above  Rafael  himself As there is much to be ascribed to national prejudice so there is something to be excused in it Certain it is the pictures of  Juanes  are finished with astonishing truth colouring and beauty though they are laboured to a minuteness that lets not even a hair escape still their force is unimpaired and the sublimity of design suffers no prejudice by the delicacy of its execution as every work is the work of the heart  nothing is neglected or left every figure is laboured into life and the labour is the labour of love not the task of the hireling It is greatly to be lamented that these precious remains are shut in the convents of Valencia without any hope of delivery and that free dis∣play of which the mortmain of superstition seems for ever to de∣prive them In the sacristy of the church of  San Pedro  in Valencia there will be found a Christ by  Juanes  a San Sebastian and a San Francisco de Paula in the convent of the lastnamed order In the chapel of San Francisco de Borja there is a Santa Ines and in the chapel of Santo Thomas de Villa∣nueva belonging to the Augus∣tine  monks of San Julian there are three grand compositions by this master that in the middle on the subject of the Nativity with the Martyrdom of Santa Ines on one side and the Burial of a de∣vout priest of that chapel named  Moses Bauta Agnesio  on the other side As soon as you enter the cathedral of Valencia on your left hand hangs a picture of the Baptism of Christ in the river Jor∣dan by this artist he has intro∣duced the persons of some Saints present at this scene by privileged anachronism as  Rafael  has done in his famous Madona del Pez in the Escorial This composition of  Juanes  is entirely in the stile of the great master abovementioned  the heads are excellent the ex∣pression just and natural and the execution delicate in the highest degree the glory above with the Padre eterno and the groupe of Seraphim is managed with infinite art and effect That  Juanes  was a copyist of  Rafael  appears from the example of a Holy Family painted by him now in the ca∣thedral of Valencia in which the Nino Jesus is an exact transcript of that in  Rafael  's Madona del Pez but touched with all the spirit of an original many other paintings of  Juanes  will be found in Valen∣cia but care must be taken to distinguish his true pictures as several of his scholars have passed their works under his name that  for which he is chiefly celebrated is his composition on the subject of the Immaculate Conception in the late college of the Jesuits in that city this picture is the ob∣ject of general veneration and by the devout and credulous consi∣dered as an actual original or very little removed from an ori∣ginal for the tradition runs that it was painted by the order of Father  Martin Alberto  to whom the blessed Virgin condescended to appear on the eve of the Assump∣tion and required the holy Father to cause her portrait to be taken in the dress she then wore which was a white frock or tunic with a blue cloak together with the fol∣lowing accompaniments viz at  her feet the moon over head the Padre eterno and her most blessed Son in the act of placing a crown on her head with the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove hovering over the groupe  Alberto  who was all obedience to the sacred vi∣sitor communicated to  Juanes  the honourable office of fulfilling the commands which he himself was unable to execute the devout painter sate to work with extraor∣dinary preparations for the task and having sketched a groupe af∣ter the description of  Alberto  pre∣sented it to the Father for his opi∣nion the first design being found imperfect and unlike  Juanes  was incited to address himself to the undertaking with fresh and more  elaborate acts of penitence and contrition no austerities deterred  Juanes  whilst the Father assisted him with his prayers the work succeeded for every touch was sanctified and his pencil like a sword blest and made invincible by the Pope never missed its stroke Some intervals there were in which the work stood still and then the painter would sit looking and pondering on his canvass till the happy inspiration seized him and the prayers of Father  Alberto  gave him fortitude and vigour to resume the task  Pacheco  relates an anecdote so much to the credit of the parties concerned that it would be wrong to omit it which is that the pious  Juanes  being  one day seated on a scaffold at work upon the upper parts of this picture the frame gave way and the painter being in the act of falling the holy personage whose portrait he had finished stept sud∣denly forward out of the canvass and seizing his hand preserved him from the fall This being done and  Juanes  safe landed on the floor the gracious Lady with all possible composure returned to her post and has continued there ever since dispensing her favours to her supplicants and worshippers and is universally believed upon the testimony of  Alberto  to be an exact counterpart of the original and indeed if we admit the cir∣cumstance of the rescue I do not  see how we can dispute the like∣ness which I should guess from the same circumstance had not erred on the unfavourable side With legends of this sort  Pacheco  's book is filled a specimen or two will serve to shew the credulity and superstition of the time I shall give this very sparingly and I hope without offence to the opi∣nions of any reasonable man This great artist died in in the town of Bocairente in Valen∣cia after having painted the great altar of that church which was his last work In the year his body was removed agreeable to his last will and testament to the parish church of Santa Cruz in Valencia from that of Bocairente  attended by a considerable train of secular priests and others Re∣duced by religious austerities and mortifications he died at the age of fiftysix years By his piety he merited a place in the calendar of Saints by his genius a name amongst the first class of his art high in the school of  Rafael  at least if not on a level with the great master himself  Juan Labrador  a Spaniard was a scholar of the  Divino Morales  and the best painter of fruits and flowers and of stilllife in general that Spain ever produced he died in at Madrid at a very ad∣vanced age  Juan Pantoia de la Cruz  was born in Madrid and studied under the  celebrated  Alonso Sanchez Coello  whom he succeeded as painter of the chamber to Philip the IId he chiefly excelled in portraits and died in  I have now nearly enumerated the principal artists who flourish∣ed in Spain during the reign of Philip the second that prince died in September at his fa∣vourite monastery of San Lorenzo in the most deplorable and loath∣some state of misery to which hu∣man nature can be reduced before its actual dissolution It must be acknowledged he was a liberal pro∣tector of the arts the great work of the Escorial in which his pride and superstition engaged him gave occupation and display to many  eminent men The genius which this encouragement called up ap∣pears to have lost none of its force during the reign of his son and suc∣cessor Philip the IIId Artists of dis∣tinguished abilities will be found in this period  Bartolome Gonzalez  a native of Valladolid and a dis∣ciple of  Patricio Caxes  came to Madrid in and was made King's painter upon his arrival he made many portraits of the Austrian family for the palace of the Pardo in a very excellent stile though he was of an advanced age when he entered into the service of King Philip the IIId for he died at the age of sixtythree in the year in the city of Madrid  Juan de Solo  and  Juan de Chisinos  were natives of Madrid both emi∣nent artists and both died in the year In the same year died  El Doctor Pablo de las Roellas  of Seville and the Cartusian monk  Padre Luis Pasqual Gaudin  born at Villafranca in Biscay the for∣mer of these was a scholar of  Ti∣tiano  's and left many respectable monuments of his art at Cordova and Seville  Phelipe de Liano  was born at Madrid was a scholar of  Alonso Sanchez Coello  and became so famous for portraits of a small size which he executed with such spirit that he got the name of  El Ticiano Pequino  he died in This year was also fatal to the fa∣mous  Patricio Caxes  a noble Flo∣rentine in the service of Philip  the IIId who engaged him to paint the Queen's gallery at the Pardo in fresco The story which  Caxes  chose was that of Joseph and the wife of Potiphar a subject not very flattering to female delicacy but it perished with many other works of art in the lamentable fire which consumed that palace  Dominico Teotocopoli  commonly called  El Greco  flourished in this aera there are many remains of his art both as painter staruary and architect in the cities of New Cas∣tile He came so near the manner of his master  Titiano  that many of his pictures have passed upon the world under that character this it seems was not fame sufficient for the vanity of  Dominico  but in his  efforts at originality he has exposed himself to the ridicule of all good judges When he departs from  Titiano  he departs from nature and substitutes in her stead an ex∣travagance of design with so faulty a mode both of colouring and drawing that he is no longer the same master Of this sort are his paintings in the convent of Donna Maria de Aragon at Madrid and the picture which he drew for the Escorial by order of Philip the IId on the subject of the martyrdom of San Mauricio and his compa∣nions Philip was too good a judge not to see the extravagance of his composition and refused it a place in his collection  Dominico Greco  made humble suit to save the credit  of his work and it is likely was convinced of the errors into which he had been led by an affectation of singularity for he made some corrections after which his pic∣ture was with some degree of dif∣ficulty admitted to a place though not very conspicuous in the Sala de Capitulo whilst  Romulo Cin∣cinnato  was deputed in his stead to the more honourable task of paint∣ing an altarpiece for the chapel of the Saint above mentioned In the cathedral of Toledo there are some pictures by  Dominico  in his best manner which are admirable performances particularly a grand composition on the parting of the raiment of our Saviour before his crucifixion which hangs in the sa∣cristy  and is so entirely in the stile and manner of  Titiano  that his re∣putation could have suffered no in∣jury by its adoption In the same place are the twelve Apostles by the same master but in an inferior stile In the parish church of Santo Tomé is a very capital picture of  Dominico  's on the interment of  DonGonzalo Ruiz  of Toledo this illustrious person who was  Conde de Orgaz  founded an Augustine convent un∣der the title of San Estevan in the city of Toledo in commemoration of which pious act  Dominico  has re∣presented San Augustin and San Estevan in the act of placing his body in the tomb This picture cost the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo  Don Gaspar de Quiroga  two thousand  ducats a great sum in the year when it was executed at the suit of the parish priest of Santo Tomé and put up in that church which as well as the convent be∣fore mentioned was founded by this noble and devout person This picture and that on the part∣ing of our Saviour's raiment are the most capital performances of this author in Spain there are va∣rious others however both at To∣ledo and Madrid but chiefly at the former city which would well repay the curiosity of a tra∣veller At Illescas which is half way between the said cities the church of the Hospital de la Caridad was designed by  Dominico  and is with its altars carvings  and paintings a very respectable proof of his merit in the several elegant arts which he professed He was near eighty years old when he died at Toledo in and was interred in the parish church of San Bartolomé  Domi∣nico Greco  was the first painter in Spain who had the spirit to oppose the exaction of a royal tax upon the pictures painted and sold by living masters which he litigated and obtained a favourable decree  Diego de Romulo Cincinnato  was son and scholar of the elder  Ro∣mulo  painter to Philip the IId he entered into the service of  Don Fernando Enriquez de Ribera  third Duke of Alcala and went with him to Rome when he was ap∣pointed  ambassador extraordinary from Philip the IVth for the pur∣pose of doing homage to Pope Urban the VIIIth he painted his Holiness three several times and so much to his satisfaction with such applause from all the artists at Rome that he was rewarded with many handsome presents and made a Knight of Christ in Por∣tugal where the ceremony was performed by Cardinal  Trexo Par∣riagua  a Spaniard This was done in presence of the Duke of Alcala his patron in the house of the Cardinal beforementioned who gave him a gold chain and the medal of the order This passed in December of the year and in the year following this in∣genious  artist died in the city of Rome and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo with all the cere∣monials due to a Knight of the order and a man of so distinguished a genius Philip the IVth of Spain had the consideration to so∣licit his Holiness to transfer the dignity of Knight of Christ to  Francisco  the brother of  Diego  which was accordingly done  Francisco  and  Juan Ribalta  were father and son born in Valencia and painters of such equal emi∣nence that it is exceedingly dif∣ficult to distinguish their respec∣tive hands the father's pictures are however rather more finished than those of the son's which on their part have the advantage in  force and effect In many of his pictures he appears to have pro∣posed his countryman  Juanes  for his model and sometimes paints so like his contemporary  Vicencio Carducho  the Florentine as scarce to be distinguished from him of this sort is his picture of the Last Supper on the high altar of the college of the Patriarch in Valen∣cia which if compared with that of  Carducho  on the same subject upon the high altar of the church of the nuns of Corpus Christi in Madrid will be found so exactly corresponding in stile and manner that both might pass for the work of either master One of the best works of  Ribalta  in Valencia is a dead Christ in the hall of the chap∣terhouse  of the Carmelitish con∣vent copied from  Sebastian del Piombo  the original of which is in the Royal collection In this same place are two other copies from  Piombo  of admirable exe∣cution It is related of  Fran∣cisco Ribalta  that having painted a crucifixion for the Pope's nuncio in Spain the picture was carried to Rome and upon being shewn to an eminent painter in that city he immediately exclaimed  O Di∣vino Rafaelo  judging it to be a capital performance of that master upon being told of his mistake by the nuncio he proceeded to exa∣mine it afresh with great attention and concluded with a common Spanish proverb  Que verdadera∣mente  donde yeguas hay patros nacen  viz Where there are mares there will be colts importing that all countries may at times produce extraordinary men  Francisco Ri∣balta  died in Valencia in and his son in he had the ho∣nour of being the first master of  Ribera  called  Span̄olet  Adriano  of Cordova was a lay brother of the barefooted Carme∣lites his works are few and con∣fined to the city abovementioned the chief composition is a cruci∣fixion in which he has introduced the mother of Christ San Juan and la Magdalena with other fi∣gures of half length in the man∣ner of  Rafael Sadeler  to whom he was greatly attached this picture  is in the antichamber to the sa∣cristy of the Carmelitish convent at Cordova in which city  Adriano  died in the year This artist was so diffident of himself that he used to deface or destroy his pic∣tures as soon as he had executed them and so general was this practice with him that his friends took occasion to intercede with him for the preservation of his va∣luable productions in the name of the souls in purgatory knowing his attachment to the holy offices in their behalf By this mode of exorcism the destroying spirit which his selfdissatisfaction had conjured up was kept in cheek and thanks to the souls in purga∣tory some very valuable pictures  were rescued from extinction by their influence and authority  Vicencio Carducho  a Florentine the brother and scholar of  Bartho∣lome Carducho  was King's painter in the reigns of Philip the IIId and IVth He was in singular esteem and favour with those princes and employed in many eminent works at the palace of the Pardo the works of this master are to be found in all the cities of Castile in Toledo Salamanca Segovia Alcala and Valladolid as well as in Madrid where he died in this date is ascertained by the fol∣lowing memorandum inscribed on a picture of San Geronimo in the great church of Alcala de He∣nares  Vincentius Carduchi Floren∣tinus  hic vitam non opus finin anno  He died at the age of years He instructed the fa∣mous  Rizi  who was painter to Philip the IVth and Charles the IId and formed many other dis∣ciples in his academy  Philip the IIId died and was succeeded in by his son Phi∣lip the IVth a great patron of the arts in whose time flourished men of very illustrious talents In Charles Prince of Wales came to Madrid upon a youthful sally of gallantry to throw him∣self at the feet of the Infanta sister of Philip and conclude as he be∣lieved a treaty of marriage which had been long in dependence and obstructed by many difficulties and  delays In this expedition he was accompanied by  Pedro Pablo Ru∣bens  of Antwerp This great mas∣ter was then in his fortysixth year had concluded a long course of study in Italy being in high esti∣mation upon his return to Flan∣ders and greatly in favour with the Archduke Albert and the In∣fanta Donna Isabel Clara Eugenia his spouse he had painted several pictures by order of the Emperor and of the King of England and had visited Paris where by order of Mary of Medicis he had exe∣cuted his famous paintings for the Luxembourg palace with great credit and success Charles had an early passion for the arts and was greatly attached to his fellow  traveller the honours which the King of Spain lavished upon his Royal visitor with all the profuse magnificence that Spanish gal∣lantry could devise extended themselves to the person of his in∣genious companion Olivares then the minister of Spain had splendor and Philip was in pos∣session of taste Rubens was in turns caressed by both the Royal collections of the Escorial Pardo and Madrid opened to his view an inexhaustible magazine of arts Mr Horace Walpole is mistaken in thinking Rubens was in Spain during the administration of the Duke of Lerma This was not so Rubens had studied  Titiano  and  Pablo Verones  at Venice with  distinguishing attention the cabi∣nets of Philip now displayed such superb compositions of these mas∣ters particularly of  Titiano  as equally captivated both the painter and the Prince  Rubens  by order of the Catholic King copied the Europa the Baths of Diana and several other pictures of  Titiano  which Charles had particularly ad∣mired when these copies were finished it was expected that Philip should present them to the Prince of Wales and the compli∣ment would surely have been a worthy one both to Charles and to his favourite artist but the ge∣nerosity of Philip meditated greater lengths and in truth it scarce knew any bounds towards his  princely guest He retained to himself the copies and sent to Charles the originals It is pro∣per in this place to observe that these valuable originals returned again to the possession of the King of Spain when Charles by the instigation of Buckingham made occasion to dissolve his engage∣ments with the Infanta to reject the sister and yet to retain the pre∣sents of the Catholic monarch would have been a conduct irre∣concileable to the spirit and prin∣ciples of Charles though his at∣tachment to the arts was as ardent as any man's he had the senti∣ments of a gentleman and pride of honour superior even to his love of the art of painting In  the event of things it has come to pass that Charles instead of tak∣ing from the Royal stock in Spain has been the means of some addi∣tions to it of the highest value Charles having taken his depar∣ture for England and the high punctilio of the Spanish monarch having supported ifself to the latest moment of his abode by erecting a pillar on the spot where they parted  Rubens  at the same time returned to Flanders and Philip having now compleated his hunt∣ingseat of the Torre de la Prada in the neighbourhood of Madrid applied to that artist for several pictures in character with the pa∣lace with exact descriptions of the sizes of the canvasses and the  rooms and positions in which they were to be hung all these were executed by  Rubens  and trans∣mitted to the King who highly approved of them many of the dogs and other animals in these huntingpieces were put in by his scholars  Azneira  and  Pedro de Vos  who excelled in that branch of the art About this time the  Conde Duque de Olivares  Philip's mini∣ster had compleated his founda∣tion of a convent of barefooted Carmelites at the little town of Loeches in the neighbourhood of Madrid now belonging to his Excellency the  Duque de Alba  Philip to do a grace to his fa∣vourite and to make a merit with the religious of that order com∣missioned  Rubens for some pic∣tures which he executed in his grandest stile and richest glow of colours Two of these which flank the altar are of considerable dimensions and in point of exe∣cution not to be exceeded by any of the master the first is an alle∣gorical composition on the Tri∣umph of Religion which he has personified and habited very grace∣fully This figure is seated in a su∣perb triumphal carr drawn by four angels with others in atten∣dance bearing the cross and other symbols properly in character four figures that express the va∣rious characters of Infidelity or Ignorance over which Religion is supposed to triumph follow the  carr like slaves or captives bound with chains whilst the piece is crowned with beautiful cheru∣bims that hover over the groupe with chaplets of various descrip∣tions in their hands disposed with singular art and astonishing effect The other which companions it in size is the Interview of Abra∣ham and Melchisedech who of∣fers him bread and the tenth of the spoils in the drapery of the priests and the armour of the sol∣diers  Rubens  has exhausted every resource that his fund of colour∣ing could supply there are two other pictures in this small but precious collection of the same author and of equal size and ex∣cellence with the above that can∣not  be passed over in silence they hang in the choir that on the left∣hand represents the four Doctors of the church with Santo Thomas San Buenaventura and Santa Clara its companion on the opposite side represents the Four Evangelists with their proper emblems com∣positions of unspeakable majesty and expression The original sketch of this latter piece is preserved in the Sitio of the Buen Retiro that of the Doctors in the palace of Madrid It is painful to observe that these magnificent perform∣ances are suffering daily for want of new straining and the obvious repairs which if not speedily ap∣plied these monuments of art  will be in ruin In the nave of the church there are two other large compositions by Rubens the one of Elias and the Angel comfort∣ing him in the desart the other of the Israelites gathering manna the fcenery in both these pictures is uncommonly beautiful so is the sky in the latter The drapery of Elias is finely disposed but as the painter has neglected to dreis the Prophet in the habit of a Car∣melite the holy Fathers who claim him as the founder of their order are not a little scandalized by the omission I cannot inform myself upon what proofs these rigid devotees carry up the pedigree of their order to the asoresaid pro∣phet but whatever flaws a scru∣pulous  enquirer might find in their title this I am sure of that the strength of their faith can make up for the weakness of the autho∣rity The Angel in this piece is coloured to a miracle and as the Fathers do not claim to derive from him there is no exception to the habit which the painter has thought fit to give him The fi∣gures in these pieces are above na∣tural size  The three great kingdoms of Europe Spain France and Eng∣land were at this time governed by the ministers Olivares Richelieu and Buckingham it was the reign of favourites Buckingham who had more caprice and less genius than either of his contemporaries  had nevertheless contracted a great esteem for  Rubens  during their expedition to Madrid this was not directed to his professional ta∣lents but to those qualities and good conduct which undoubtedly he had and which Buckingham sagaciously enough determined to call forth when any great occasion should present itself Such was now in view Buckingham was at Paris negociating a marriage be∣tween Charles who had lately suc∣ceeded to the throne and the prin∣cess Mary whom that prince had seen at Paris in his way to Spain and of whose beauty and attractions we have such striking testimo∣nials under the hand of  Vandyke  Though Buckingham at Madrid  had wantonly avowed eternal en∣mity to the minister of Spain he now entered upon a correspondence with  Rubens  on the means of recon∣ciling the kingdoms and this pro∣duced the second visit which that artist paid to Madrid in quality of ambassador extraordinary from the court of Brussels in the year He staid nine months in Madrid on this negociation and being at times confined to his chamber by the gout in his feet he took the opportunity of working at his easel in which time he compleated eight grand pictures for the great saloon of the palace of which his famous Rape of the Sabines was one and also his Battle of the Romans and the Sabines In this period such  was the rapidity of his pencil that he took five several portraits of King Philip one of which is equestrian and grouped with se∣veral other figures a magnificent performance and for which he re∣ceived a magnificent reward with the honour of knighthood of naturalization and the golden key as gentleman of the chamber He painted the Infanta a halflength and the King of the same size by commission from the Archduchess Isabella he made five or six other portraits of illustrious persons  Superior to the little vain punc∣tilios of his art he returned with ardour to his task of copying the most capital works of  Titiano  in the royal possession such as the  Venus and Adonis the Venus and Cupid the Adam and Eve and many others with several por∣traits particularly of the Land∣grave the Duke of Saxony and the great Alva he made a con∣siderable addition to his grand composition on the Adoration of the Magi which now holds so con∣spicuous a place in the Madrid col∣lection of all the crown of Spain possesses of the works of this emi∣nent master this picture of the Adoration appears to me the most superb and brilliant and his dead Christ in the Sala del Capitulo of the Escorial the most touching and expressive I have never yet sound any picture that speaks so strong∣ly to the passions as this last  Amongst the capital performances of  Rafael Titiano  and others this composition has attracted and will probably continue to attract little notice or applause but I am bold to believe every spectator who shall review this wonderful collec∣tion with independent taste and de∣termination not to be told what he is to feel and where he is to ad∣mire and will stop a while to con∣template the tragic spectacle of a mangled Saviour surrounded by a groupe of such mourners as seem to feel a sorrow like the object which creates it more than hu∣man will own with me that  Ru∣bens  in this affecting piece has touched the passions with some∣thing more than a painter's with a  poet's hand Contemplating this picture I could not help calling to mind the bitterness of  Mengs'  criticism when he is comparing  Rubens'  copy of  Titiano  to a Dutch translation of an elegant author and in this train of thinking I could not avoid drawing a comparison in my mind between the piece before me and that which  Mengs  himself has composed on the like subject The scene is the same the actors the same and the catastro∣phe not to be diversified But with  Mengs  all is lifeless cold and flat methodized by art and measured by rule the groupe of an academy sitters for attitudes and hirelings for sorrow the dead body of the Christ is laid out and in like man∣ner  exposed to view in the one case as in the other but what a contrast  Mengs  has indeed labour∣ed hard to make a beautiful corpse he has rounded the muscles and polished the skin and given it such a hue that it ceases to be flesh and is a shining waxen figure with no trace of pain or sufferings past look upon the other and you contemplate as it should seem the very person  who himself bore our sorrows on the tree by whose stripes we are healed  Yet  Mengs  is the author whom courtly pre∣judice has put above comparison in Spain whom not to admire is treason against state and whose worship is become canonical a part almost of the orthodox ido∣latry  of their religion  Mengs  is the critic who professedly treat∣ing of the collection of pictures in the palace at Madrid can afford no commendation or description of  Reubens  's capital picture of the Adoration and records his name apparently with no other view but to make a needless sacrifice of it to that of  Titiano  whom it seems he had had the temerity to copy  It is hardly to be believed that  Rubens  during these nine months finished several other considerable pictures particularly his Martyr∣dom of the apostle San Andres which now makes the altarpiece of the Flemish chapel an enchant∣ing composition I have related that he arrived in Spain in the year  on the th of April in the year following he took his de∣parture not without many dis∣tinguishing tokens of favour from his Catholic Majesty by whose order the Conde Duque de Oli∣vares presented  Rubens  with a ring worth two thousand ducats he was also made secretary to the privy council at the court of Brus∣sels for his life with the succession to his son Alberto a very consider∣able benefice Having now attend∣ed him to the time of his leaving Spain I shall commit him for the remainder of his career to his more professed biographers observing only that he formed a sriendship in Madrid with the great Spanish painter  Diego Velazquez de Silva  which friendship was continued by a correspondence that lasted many years  Juan del Castillo  of Seville was a painter of eminence and in great repute as a master and instructor in the art he had the double ho∣nour of being disciple of  Luis de Vargas  and teacher of  Bartolome Murillo  the famous  Alonso Cano  and  Pedro de Moya  were likewise his scholars He died at Cadiz aged in the year  At this period of time under the fostering auspices of Philip the fourth such a host of artists pre∣sent themselves to my view that whilst I perceive the impracticabi∣lity of recording all I feel repug∣nance at omitting any as I would  not willingly present to the public a mere catalogue of painters and their works so neither would I strain the truth of circumstances by endeavouring at variety In this dilemma therefore I have judged it best to select some of the most eminent and pass over the less interesting in silence amongst the former  Eugenio Caxes  undoubtedly deserves a place if it were only that he was found worthy to be of the list of King's painters and to enter into com∣petition with the celebrated  Velaz∣quez  in the branches both of his∣torical and portrait painting Though he was a native of Madrid yet his father  Patricio  by whom he was educated in his art was a  Florentine Philip the fourth sate in person to  Eugenio  but what became of the picture or whether it is in existence I have not been able to discover it was his fate with many others to be eclipsed by the superior lustre of  Velazquez  's talents and from the time that artist entered into the royal service and employ  Eugenio  principally employed his talents in painting for the convents and churches who in emulation of the court held forth a very liberal encourage∣ment to the arts The convent of San Phelipe in the city of Madrid contained the chief collection of this master's works where they perished by fire together with the convent itself in He was  jointly engaged with  Vicencio Car∣ducho  in the frescos of the Pardo where the like fatal accident again consumed his labours with many others equally to be lamented He died in at the age of sixtyfive  In the same year died  Pedro Orrente  by others called  Pedro Rente  born in Murcia and Fa∣miliar of the Inquisition in that city a disciple of  Bassan  and pro∣tected by the minister Olivares who employed him in the paint∣ings then collecting at the palace of the Buen Retiro Many of his works are to be found in Valencia and Cordova and some at Toledo particularly a Santa Leocadia com∣ing out of the sepulchre over the  door of the sacristy of the cathe∣dral and in the chapel de los Reyes nuevos belonging to the said church a Nativity which compa∣nions an Adoration of the Magi by  Caxes  beforementioned both which are excellent compositions and finely executed He coloured in the stile of his master but in his choice of nature did not imi∣tate his vulgarity of taste in cor∣rectness of drawing he has been rarely exceeded He was buried in the parish church of San Barto∣lome at Toledo in which he died far advanced in years and is de∣servedly to be numbered amongst the most eminent Spaniards of his profession  Francisco Fernandez  and  Alonso  Vazquez  were the favourite disci∣ples the one of  Carducho  and the other of the celebrated  Luis d  Vargas Vazquez  was a native o  Ronda and practised his art it the city of Seville His figures in the nude are drawn with grea  truth and anatomical skill they are slight and sketchlike bu  executed with effect and force  whilst he was painting in Seville  Francisco Pacheco  from whos  treatise some of these anecdote  are drawn was keeping an acade¦my in that city with great repu¦tation and success  Velazquez  wh  afterwards rose to such high ho¦nours and favour with his King  was a disciple of  Pacheco  's at thi  time  Vazquez  and  Pacheco  wer  rival artists and painted some pic∣tures professedly in competition for the cathedral of the convent of barefooted Carmelites and other places the manner of  Pa∣checo  though learned and cor∣rect was harsh and dry in the ex∣treme so that  Vazquez  was much the more popular painter of the two and young  Velazquez  who about this time married  Pacheco  's daughter did not think fit to es∣pouse his taste and formed him∣self upon other models There is a little couplet upon a crucifix of  Pacheco  's which satyrizes this harshness of manner with so much smartness and such neatness of versification that I present it in the original to the reader  Quien os puso assi Sen̄or  Tan desabrido y tan seco  Vos me direis que el amor  Mas yo digo que Pacheco  Nothing can be more musical than the chime of the words but the idea cannot be well conveyed in English It seems natural for academicians like  Pacheco  who are so much concerned in the grammar of their art to contract a stiff pedantic stile as was the case but his pictures are said to be good studies and if he was not a painter of the first manner he appears to have been a great master and author in his art He was a man of liberal sentiments strict morals and uncommon me∣desty  He died in Seville in having survived his competitor  Vazquez  four years As to  Francisco Fernandez  who was unquestion∣ably one of the first artists of his time he died in at Madrid of which place he was a native being killed by  Francisco de Baras  in a sudden fit of passion at the age of fortytwo years universally regretted  Joses de Ribera  known to Eu∣rope by the name of  Il Spagnoleto  was a native of Xativa in the kingdom of Valencia a country rich in natural productions and of a most happy temperature in point of climate In this particu∣lar it has been frequently com∣pared to Greece and like Greece  has been found uncommonly pre∣liric in giving birth to men of genius and talents How far the growth and culture of the human mind may like vegetable nature depend upon the skiey influences there is no need at present to en∣quire the seeds of genius like those of any other tender plant may well be supposed susceptible of nutrition advancement or re∣pression by the operations of the atmosphere and if this obtains in the general I think we may con∣clude for it more strongly in fa∣vour of the particular art now un∣der consideration than of any other perhaps in the whole cata∣logue of human study or inven∣tion Painting which is an ope∣ration  manual as well as mental demands the joint vigour and ex∣ertion of body and mind it should seem that there is in demand a force of atmosphere to brace the corporeal system and at the same time such a degree of genial warmth and relaxation of climate as shall give imagination its full play and scope these can only be obtained in those happy latitudes where our scene is now laid It is needless perhaps to observe that there must be proper lights for the creation of the art and there should be a commodious tempera∣ture for their preservation and continuance These are to be had in their highest perfection in Spain as well as Greece If the Ice∣lander  in his native climate ever should experience the impulse of a painter's genius the year itself would not supply many hours in which his fingers could obey its summons and in the other extre∣mity of climate where every fibre is unstrung by relaxation all who have experienced know the inap∣titude both of mind and body to∣wards any action or employ of ei∣ther unfit alike for arts and arms the emasculate and soft inhabitant sinks into sloth and slumbers away a life that scarce deserves a better name than vegetation Upon the whole I think we may admit that there are some portions of the ha∣bitable earth where nature has declared herself against the pro∣duction  of painters and no por∣tion yet discovered where an as∣semblage of more happy requisites ever centered than in the climate and country in which the artist now before us had his birth  It may be proper to observe that although there cannot be found amongst the Spanish pain∣ters a greater instance of poverty in the extreme than what  Ri∣bera  experienced yet his preten∣sions in respect of family were as high and his blood as pure as most in Spain This pride of pe∣digree is there to the full as much at heart and as ceremoniously maintained amongst men in the last degree of worldly misery as it is with the rich and great  To enumerate a line of ancestors unadulterated with Moorish or Jewish blood and not made vile by any ignoble and dishonourable trades is the glory of an old Cas∣tilian though in rags and wretch∣edness The house of  Ribera  tho' it had branched into Valencia was in its original rooted in the pure terra firma of Old Castile and I dare say his parents would as soon have brought up their son to the occupation of a hangman as apprenticed him to the trade of a shoemaker This is amongst the occupations which an old Spaniard calls  dishonest  and by which he would as effectually pollute his blood as an Indian would forfeit his cast by eating hog'sflesh out  of the unclean platter of a Portu∣guese To be a mender of shoes or in vulgar phrase a cobler is no degradation to a Spaniard's dig∣nity but to be a maker of them in the first instance is corrupt and vile and such an artisan cannot consort or intermarry with the persons that are uncontaminated with any thing but poverty and ver min  With these principles and no other earthly possession for his inhe∣ritance young  Ribera  entered him∣self a disciple of  Francisco de Ribalta  as I have already related how long he continued or how far he pro∣ceeded to form the peculiarities of his taste under the tuition of this master I cannot precisely ascer∣tain  he was certainly very young when he first went to Rome be∣cause it was there he first received the puerile appellation of  Il Spag∣noleto  or the Little Spaniard and that this was in early time is also manifest from other reasons As for his singularity in chusing sub∣jects of terror and expressions of pain that was not owing to the infusions of precept or the effect of imitation but was in him at once characteristic and original He had a strong mind hardened by ad∣versity and naturally superior to those passions which though soft and enervating have operated to produce the beautiful in art In the sublime and terrific  Ribera  stands forth as a great master In  tragic compositions the distortions of agonized nature and in the strong and horrible reliefs of the deepest lights and shades he is emi∣nently distinguished England is in possession of so many examples in this cast of the author that I shall not enter into a minute de∣scription of his works in Spain but I cannot dispense with myself from observing that he is capable of expressing his ideas with uncom∣mon elegance and delicacy Some of the characters of his Baptist some Magdalens and Madonas which I have met are equal in grace and tenderness of expression to the best heads of  Guido  and  Guercino  I confess my surprize was great in discovering him in a  character which was new and un∣known to me before I went to Spain at the same time in a pri∣vate closet at the Escorial where there is an altar belonging to the Prior and to which admittance is rarely allowed I felt equal sur∣prize and delight at being shewn a small Holy Family by  Michael An∣gelo Bonarota  finished and coloured to a miracle In this inestimable little piece the face of the Madona is of a most singular cast such as I had never before seen extremely beautiful but not by the result of the correctest symmetry of sea∣tures for the face is lengthened beyond its proportion by which and other means with a peculiar action of the eyes and muscles an  expression is obtained which at the same time that it exceeds na∣ture does not violate it appear∣ing to be at once above and yet within it  Young  Ribera  though suffering the extreme of poverty felt within himself such powers of genius as were superior to depression and in the school of  Ribalta  meditated an excursion to Rome there to receive the last finishings of education in his art Thither he repaired and enlisting himself in the academy pursued his studies with an industry which knew no remission but whilst he was in pursuit of the scanty necessaries for the demands of life these he obtained by the sale of some of his sketches and drawings  in the academy Without friends and at times almost without food or raiment he persisted in his course with a stubborn virtuous perseverance which nothing could divert from its object if such a mind and imagination are found to delight in images of savage great∣ness and terrific sublimity it is little to be wondered at and a greater proof of his excellence cannot be given than the high estimation in which his pieces of the character abovementioned continue to be held notwith∣standing the false effeminate deli∣cacy of modern taste and fashion in pictures now prevailing in Eng∣land which discourages all at∣tempts at tragedy in painting and  shrinks from an  Ugolino  and  Pro∣metheus  with as much dread and horror as a modern petite maitresse would from the spectacle of a bull∣fight Such an academician as young  Ribera  could not long re∣main undistinguished in the mass of common students Rome was not a place where merit could be long hidden nor was his merit of a sort that could be concealed any where his fellowstudents and teachers soon discovered the supe∣riority of his talents and  par ex∣cellence  gave him the name of  Il Spagnoleto  and a certain Cardinal one day passing in his coach ob∣served a tattered figure employed in painting a board affixed to the outside of one of the ordinary  houses in the streets of Rome the youth and wretchedness of the spectacle engaged his pity and the singular attention with which he pursued his work attracted his curiosity It was  Il Spagnoleto  in the act of earning his bread of which his appearance made evi∣dent he was absolutely in want The Cardinal called him to his coachside and ordering him to his palace immediately domici∣liated the lucky youth Here he lived in ease and affluence but that virtue which the frowns of fortune could not shake was no proof against her caresses Young  Ribera  became a slave to plea∣sures of which he had not before even speculative enjoyment but  his virtue though repulsed was not subdued his apostacy from the purity of his native principles pres∣sed upon his conscience and the ruin which his genius was now me∣naced with alarmed his pride of nature with one gallant effort he burst the shackles of temptation and sallying out of the palace of the Cardinal reassumed his dig∣nity of soul and poverty at once Perhaps the history of human na∣ture will afford few examples of so strong an act  He had now all his former mi∣series to encounter with the aggra∣vating contrast of experienced de∣lights In addition to all these he was to suffer the reproaches of his protector who occasionally meet∣ing  him upbraided his ingrati∣tude in the severest terms The virtuous Spaniard made a suitable reply and cheering himself with the resources of his art and the ap∣plauses of his conscience persisted in his poverty The clear obscure of  Caravagio  became his favourite manner and in the language tho' not with the motives of Doctor Young's Zanga he might have said that  horrors now were not dis∣pleasing to him  The meagre en∣couragement he found in Rome determined him to seek his better fortune at Naples For this place he set out in a ragged jacket hav∣ing pledged his capa for a viaticum In Naples he let himself out to a common painter for hire This man  however had great humanity and some science the abilities of  Il Spagnoleto  surprized him he clear∣ly saw how superior his talents were to the low occupation he had engaged in a further acquaintance opened to him the singular virtues and good qualities he was possessed of and he soon conceived the de∣sign of converting his servant into his soninlaw He had an only child a daughter the girl being exceedingly handsome and the fa∣ther very rich an abundance of suitors presented themselves to the choice of her parents but the mo∣ment which Providence had de∣creed for rewarding the virtues of poor  Ribera  being now arrived all their pretensions availed nothing  with the father who had determined upon his part and calling  Ribera  aside proposed at once to bestow his daughter with the better part of his means immediately upon him a proposition so totally above expectation or hope staggered his belief and he entreated his mas∣ter not to make his misery and ill fortune the object of his raillery and ridicule he was at a loss to think what presumption could have escaped him to merit this re∣buke he was not conscious of having conceived or entertained a thought that aspired to a match so totally above his reach with some difficulty the father con∣quered his incredulity when young  Ribera  transported with joy and  gratitude was in one moment from being the poorest made the happiest of beings Behold him now occupying a whole floor the palace of the Viceroy with all the comforts of life and the conveniencies of his art in abun∣dance around him at the height of his fame in request of all the great and eminent in Europe and honoured by his Holiness the Pope with the knighthood of Christ A new choice of subjects now present∣ed themselves to the world and people saw with a terror partaking of delight martyrdoms executions and torments expressed to the truth nay in some cases even aggra∣vated beyond it He selected all that sacred or classic history afford∣ed  in the terrible all that the pa∣gan theology or the poetical hell had represented to appall the guilty was to be found on the canvasses of  Ribera  a martyred San Bartolome stript to the muscles became a study for anatomists Cato of  Utica  in the act of tearing out his bowels brought the horror of selfmurder to the eyes and hearts of men Hercules struggling in the throes of death and all the tortured in the fabulous realm of Pluto were now exhibited like Eschylus's suries on the stage of Athens and in some instances with the same effects for it is related that a certain lady of Amsterdam named Jacoba de Usfel having miscarried upon seeing some paintings of Sisyphus Tantalus and Ixion by  Ribera  her hus∣band's  gallantry induced him to dispose of them and being carried into Italy they were purchased on the part of His Catholic Majesty and transported into Spain where they are now preserved in the pa∣lace of the Buen Retiro Many other pictures of this master were collected by the Viceroys of Naples for the King and also for particu∣lar Grandees and brought into Spain In the royal collections of Madrid and the Escorial there are many the great altarpiece of the church of Santa Isabel on the sub∣ject of the Conception is by  Ribera  and the head of the Virgin is the portrait of his daughter He died at Naples in aged years leaving only one child above men∣tioned  whom he married to a man of distinction in Naples He left be∣hind him a tract in manuscript on the principles of the art of painting which is reported to have been a most elaborate and excellent com∣position  Luis Tristan  a disciple of  Domi∣nico Greco  was born in a small vil∣lage near the city of Toledo He certainly exceeded his master in correctness of drawing and purity of taste It does not appear that  Dominico  had any of the jealousies of his art about him in his treat∣ment of  Tristan  whilst he was under his tuition on the contrary he took early notice of his talents and brought them into practice and display with all the advantages in his power to give the monasteries  of Spain as I have elsewhere ob∣served were in that period con∣siderable patrons of the elegant arts of painting and sculpture most of these religious Societies are rich and those whose funds did not enable them to set the artists at work found benefactors amongst the great whose devotion or va∣nity disposed them to beautify and enrich the churches and altars which they frequented and where such donations would be accepted in the way of atonement or re∣corded as acts of voluntary piety and meritorious munificence The monks of La Sisla in the neighbour∣hood of Toledo had applied to  Dominico Greco  for a picture of our Lord's last supper to be painted for  their refectory in the manner that  Titiano  had adorned that in the monastery of San Lorenzo  Dominico  being obliged to decline the com∣mission on account of indisposition recommended his young pupil  Luis Tristan  to the undertaking the monks accepted his services and upon delivery of the picture were with reason satisfied with the per∣formance nothing remained to be adjusted but the price and the de∣mand of the artist being for ducats was deemed exorbitant the Fathers referred themselves to  Do∣minico  who being then in a fit of the gout was put into a coach and conveyed to the convent as soon as he arrived there and had deli∣berately surveyed the piece he  turned suddenly to his disciple and with a menacing tone and air lift∣ing up his crutch exclaimed against  Tristan  for disgracing his art and all who professed it by demanding ducats for the picture in question The triumph of the Fathers upon this testimony of their umpire so decidedly as it seemed in their fa∣vour was however soon reversed when  Dominico  directed his dis∣ciple to roll up the picture and take it away with him to Toledo for that he should not leave it there for five hundred ducats then launching out into rapturous en∣comiums on the performance he began to put his decision into exe∣cution Vexation and surprize now took possession of the convicted  monks their murmuring and com∣plaints were changed to inter∣cessions and after sufficient a∣tonement on their part the mo∣ney was paid and the picture sur∣rendered to the refectory and obli∣vion Certainly it is a capital com∣position and whenever the Fathers shall repent of the bargain made by their predecessors there is not a collector in Europe but will give them their principal with ample interest upon their purchase  Tris∣tan  died at Toledo in the year at the age of fiftyfour with the honour of being imitated by the celebrated  Velazquez  who declared himself his admirer and quitting the precepts of  Pacheco  professedly modelled himself after  the stile and manner of  Luis Tris∣tan  Juan Baptista Mayno  a monk of the order of the Predicadores was a contemporary of  Tristan  and a disciple also of  Dominico Greco  In the convent of San Pedro the Martyr at Toledo there is an altar∣piece in four compartments repre∣senting the subjects of the four Pasquas viz the Nativity the Re∣surrection the
