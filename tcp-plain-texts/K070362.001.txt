 ALCIPHRON  OR THE MINUTE PHILOSOPHER IN SEVEN DIALOGUES  Containing an  APOLOGY  for the  Christian Religion  against those who are called  Freethinkers  VOLUME  the  FIRST  They have forsaken me the Fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water  Jerem ii  Sin mortuus ut quidam minuti Philosophi censent nihil sentiam non vereor ne hunc errorem meum mortui Philosophi irrideant  Cicero  DUBLIN  Printed for  G Risk G Ewing  and  W Smith  Booksellers in  DameStreet  M DCC XXXII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Author's Design being to consider the Freethinker in the various Lights of Atheist Libertine Enthusiast Scorner Critic Metaphysician Fatalist and Sceptic it must not therefore be imagined that every one of these Characters agrees with every individual Freethinker no more being implied than that each Part agrees with some or other of the Sect There may possibly be a Reader who shall think the Character of Atheist agrees with none But though it hath been often said there is no such thing as a Speculative Atheist yet we must allow there are several Atheists who pretend to Speculation This the Author knows to be true and is well assured that one of the most noted Writers against Christianity in our Times declared he had found out a Demonstration against the Being of a God And he doubts not whoever will be at the pains  to inform himself by a general Conversation as well as Books of the Principles and Tenets of our modern Freethinkers will see too much Cause to be persuaded that nothing in the ensuing Characters is beyond the Life As for the Treatise concerning VISION why the Author annexed it to the MINUTE PHILOSOPHER will appear upon Perusal of the Fourth Dialogue  THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  The FIRST DIALOGUE  SECT

my self  Theages  that before this time I might have been able to have sent you an agreeable Account of the Success of the Affair which brought me into this remote corner of the Country But instead of this I shou'd now give you the Detail of its Miscarriage  if I did not rather choose to entertain you with some amusing Incidents which have helped to make me easy under a Circumstance I cou'd neither obviate nor foresee Events are not in our power but it always is to make a good use even of the very worst And I must needs own the Course and Event of this Affair gave opportunity for Reflections that make me some amends for a great loss of Time Pains and Expence A Life of Action which takes its Issue from the Counsels Passions and Views of other Men if it doth not draw a Man to imitate will at least teach him to observe And a Mind at liberty to reflect on its own Observations if it produce nothing useful to the World seldom fails of Entertainment to it self For several Months past I have enjoy'd such Liberty and Leisure in this distant Retreat far beyond the Verge of that great Whirlpool of Business Faction and Pleasure which is called  the World  And a Retreat in it self agreeable after a long Scene of Trouble and Disquiet was made much more so by the Conversation and good Qualities of my Host  Euphranor  who unites in his own Person the Philosopher and the Farmer two Characters not so inconsistent in nature as by Custom they seem to be  Euphranor  from the time he left the University hath lived in this small Town where he is possessed of a convenient House with a hundred Acres of Land adjoining to it which being improved by his own Labour yield him a plentiful Subsistence He hath a good Collection chiefly of old Books left him by a Clergyman his Uncle under whose Care he was brought up And the Business of his Farm doth not hinder him from making good use of it He hath read much and thought more his Health and Strength of Body enabling him the better to bear Fatigue of Mind He is of opinion that he cou'd not carry on his Studies with more Advantage in the Closet than the Field where his Mind is seldom idle while he prunes the Trees follows the Plough or looks after his Flocks In the House of this honest  Friend I became acquainted with  Crito  a neighbouring Gentleman of distinguished Merit and Estate who lives in great Friendship with  Euphranor  Last Summer  Crito  whose ParishChurch is in our Town dining on a Sunday at  Euphranor  's I happened to inquire after his Guests whom we had seen at Church with him the Sunday before They are both well said  Crito  but having once occasionally conformed to see what sort of Assembly our Parish cou'd afford they had no farther Curiosity to gratify at Church and so chose to stay at home How said  Euphranor  are they then Dissenters No replied  Crito  they are Freethinkers  Euphranor  who had never met with any of this Species or Sect of Men and but little of their Writings shew'd a great Desire to know their Principles or System That is more said  Crito  than I will undertake to tell you Their Writers are of different Opinions Some go farther and explain themselves more freely than others But the current general Notions of the Sect are best learned from Conversation with those who profess themselves of it Your Curiosity may now be satisfy'd if you and  Dion  wou'd spend a Week at my House with these Gentlemen who seem very ready to declare and propagate their Opinions  Alciphron  is above Forty and no stranger either to Men or Books I knew him first at the Temple which upon an Estate's falling to him he quitted to travel through the polite parts of  Europe  Since his Return he hath lived in the Amusements of the Town which being grown stale and tasteless to his Palate have flung him into a sort of splenetic Indolence The young Gentleman  Lysicles  is a near Kinsman of mine one of lively Parts and a general Insight into Letters who after having passed the Forms of Education and seen a little of the World fell into an Intimacy with Men of Pleasure and Freethinkers I am afraid much to the damage of his Constitution and his Fortune But what I most regret is the Corruption of his Mind by a Set of pernicious Principles  which having been observed to survive the Passions of Youth forestal even the remote Hopes of Amendment They are both Men of Fashion and wou'd be agreeable enough if they did not fancy themselves Freethinkers But this to speak the Truth has given them a certain Air and Manner which a little too visibly declare they think themselves wiser than the rest of the World I shou'd therefore be not at all displeased if my Guests met with their Match where they least expected it in a Country Farmer I shall not replied  Euphranor  pretend to any more than barely to inform my self of their Principles and Opinions For this end I propose tomorrow to set a Week's Task to my Labourers and accept your Invitation if  Dion  thinks good To which I give consent Mean while said  Crito  I shall prepare my Guests and let them know that an honest Neighbour hath a mind to discourse them on the Subject of their Freethinking And if I am not much mistaken they will please themselves with the Prospect of leaving a Convert behind them even in a Country Village Next Morning  Euphanor  rose early and spent the Forenoon in ordering his Affairs After Dinner we took our Walk to  Crito  's which lay through half a dozen pleasant Fields planted round with Planetrees that are very common in this part of the Country We walked under the delicious Shade of these Trees for about an Hour before we came to  Crito  's House which stands in the middle of a small Park beautify'd with two fine Groves of Oak and Walnut and a winding Stream of sweet and clear Water We met a Servant at the Door with a small Basket of Fruit which he was carrying into a Grove where he said his Master was with the two Strangers we found them all three sitting under a Shade And after the usual Forms at first meeting  Euphranor  and I sat down by them Our Conversation began upon the Beauty of this rural Scene the fine Season of the Year and some late Improvements which had been  made in the adjacent Country by new Methods of Agriculture Whence  Alciphron  took occasion to observe That the most valuable Improvements came latest I should have small Temptation said he to live where Men have neither polished Manners nor improved Minds though the Face of the Country were ever so well improved But I have long observed that there is a gradual Progress in humane Affairs The first Care of Mankind is to supply the Cravings of Nature in the next place they study the Conveniencies and Comforts of Life But the subduing Prejudices and acquiring true Knowledge that  Herculean  Labour is the last being what demands the most perfect Abilities and to which all other Advantages are preparative Right said  Euphranor Alciphron  hath touched our true Defect It was always my Opinion That as soon as we had provided Subsistence for the Body our next Care should be to improve the Mind But the Desire of Wealth steps between and engrosseth Mens Thoughts  II  ALC  Thought is that which we are told distinguisheth Man from Beast and Freedom of Thought makes as great a difference between Man and Man It is to the noble Asserters of this Privilege and Perfection of humane Kind the Freethinkers I mean who have sprung up and multiplied of late Years that we are indebted for all those important Discoveries that Ocean of Light which hath broke in and made its way in spight of Slavery and Superstition  Euphranor  who is a sincere Enemy to both testified a great Esteem for those Worthies who had preserved their Country from being ruined by them having spread so much Light and Knowledge over the Land He added That he liked the Name and Character of a Freethinker but in his Sense of the Word every honest Inquirer after Truth in any Age or Country was intitled to it He therefore desired to know what this Sect was that  Alciphron  had spoken  of as newly sprung up what were their Tenets what were their Discoveries and wherein they employ'd themselves for the benefit of Mankind Of all which he shou'd think himself obliged if  Alciphron  wou'd inform him That I shall very easily replied  Alciphron  for I profess my self one of the number and my most intimate Friends are some of the most considerable among them And perceiving that  Euphranor  heard him with respect he proceeded very fluently You must know said he that the mind of Man may be fitly compared to a piece of Land What stubbing plowing digging and harrowing is to the one that thinking reflecting examining is to the other Each hath its proper culture and as Land that is suffered to lie waste and wild for a long tract of time will be overspread with brushwood brambles thorns and such vegetables which have neither use nor beauty even so there will not fail to sprout up in a neglected uncultivated mind a great number of prejudices and absurd opinions which owe their origin partly to the Soil it self the passions and imperfections of the mind of Man and partly to those Seeds which chance to be scattered in it by every wind of Doctrine which the cunning of Statesmen the singularity of Pedants the superstition of Fools or the imposture of Priests shall raise Represent to your self the mind of Man or humane Nature in general that for so many ages had lain obnoxious to the frauds of designing and the follies of weak Men How it must be overrun with prejudices and errors what firm and deep Roots they must have taken and consequently how difficult a task it must be to extirpate them And yet this work no less difficult than glorious is the employment of the modern Freethinkers  Alciphron  having said this made a pause and looked round on the Company Truly said I a very laudable undertaking We think said  Euphranor  that it is praiseworthy to clear and subdue the earth to tame brute Animals to fashion the outsides of Men provide  sustenance for their Bodies and cure their Maladies But what is all this in comparison of that most excellent and useful undertaking to free Mankind from their errors and to improve and adorn their minds For things of less merit towards the world Altars have been raised and Temples built in antient times Too many in our days replied  Alciphron  are such Fools as not to know their best Benefactors from their worst Enemies They have a blind respect for those who enslave them and look upon their Deliverers as a dangerous sort of Men that wou'd undermine received Principles and Opinions  EUPH  It were a great pity such worthy ingenious Men shou'd meet with any discouragement For my part I shou'd think a Man who spent his time in such a painful impartial search after Truth a better friend to Mankind than the greatest Statesman or Hero the advantage of whose Labours is confined to a little part of the world and a short space of time whereas a Ray of Truth may enlighten the whole world and extend to future ages  ALC  It will be some time I fear before the common herd think as you do But the better sort the Men of parts and polite Education pay a due regard to the Patrons of Light and Truth  III  EUPH  The Clergy no doubt are on all occasions ready to forward and applaud your worthy endeavours Upon hearing this  Lysicles  cou'd hardly refrain from laughing And  Alciphron  with an air of pity told  Euphranor  that he perceived he was unacquainted with the real character of those Men For saith he you must know that of all Men living they are our greatest Enemies If it were possible they wou'd extinguish the very light of nature turn the world into a dungeon and keep mankind for ever in Chains and darkness  EUPH  I never imagined any thing like this of our Protestant Clergy particularly those of the established Church whom if I may be allowed to judge by what I have seen of them and  their writings I shou'd have thought lovers of learning and useful knowledge  ALC  Take my word for it Priests of all Religions are the same wherever there are Priests there will be Priestcraft and whereever there is Priestcraft there will be a persecuting Spirit which they never fail to exert to the utmost of their power against all those who have the courage to think for themselves and will not submit to be hoodwinked and manacled by their Reverend Leaders Those great Masters of Pedantry and Jargon have coined several Systems which are all equally true and of equal importance to the world The contending Sects are each alike fond of their own and alike prone to discharge their fury upon all who dissent from them Cruelty and Ambition being the darling vices of Priests and Churchmen all the world over they endeavour in all Countries to get an ascendant over the rest of mankind and the Magistrate having a joint interest with the Priest in subduing amusing and scaring the People too often lends a hand to the Hierarchy who never think their authority and possessions secure so long as those who differ from them in opinion are allowed to partake even in the common rights belonging to their birth or species To represent the matter in a true light figure to your selves a monster or spectre made up of Superstition and Enthusiasm the joint issue of Statecraft and Priestcraft rattling chains in one hand and with the other brandishing a flaming Sword over the Land and menacing destruction to all who shall dare to follow the dictates of Reason and common Sense Do but consider this and then say if there was not danger as well as difficulty in our undertaking Yet such is the generous ardour that Truth inspires our Freethinkers are neither overcome by the one nor daunted by the other In spight of both we have already made so many Proselytes among the better sort and their numbers increase so fast that we hope we shall be able to carry all before us beat down the Bulwarks of all Tyranny  Secular of Ecclesiastical break the Fetters and Chains of our Countrymen and restore the original inherent Rights Liberties and Prerogatives of Mankind  Euphranor  heard this discourse with his mouth open and his eyes fixed upon  Alciphron  who having uttered it with no small emotion stopt to draw breath and recover himself But finding that no body made answer he resumed the thread of his discourse and turning to  Euphranor  spoke in a lower note what follows The more innocent and honest a Man is the more liable is he to be imposed on by the specious pretences of other Men You have probably met with certain writings of our Divines that treat of grace virtue goodness and such matters fit to amuse and deceive a simple honest mind But believe me when I tell you they are all at bottom however they may gild their designs united by one common principle in the same Interest I will not deny there may be here and there a poor halfwitted Man that means no mischief but this I will be bold to say that all the Men of Sense among them are true at bottom to these three pursuits of ambition avarice and revenge  IV  While  Alciphron  was speaking a Servant came to tell him and  Lysicles  that some Men who were going to  London  waited to receive their orders Whereupon they both rose up and went towards the house They were no sooner gone but  Euphranor  addressing himself to  Crito  said he believed that poor Gentleman had been a great sufferer for his Freethinking for that he seemed to express himself with the passion and Resentment natural to Men who have received very bad usage I believe no such thing answered  Crito  but have often observed those of his Sect run into two faults of conversation declaiming and bantering just as the tragic or the comic humour prevails Sometimes they work themselves into high passions and are frightened at Spectres of their own raising In those fits every Country Curate passes  for an Inquisitor At other times they affect a sly facetious manner making use of hints and allusions expressing little insinuating much and upon the whole seeming to divert themselves with the Subject and their Adversaries But if you wou'd know their opinions you must make them speak out and keep close to the point Persecution for Freethinking is a topic they are apt to enlarge on though without any just cause every one being at full liberty to think what he pleases there being no such thing in  England  that I know as Persecution for opinion sentiment or thought But in every Country I suppose some care is taken to restrain petulant Speech and whatever Mens inward thoughts may be to discourage an outward contempt of what the public esteemeth Sacred Whether this care in  England  hath of late been so excessive as to distress the Subjects of this once free and easy Government whether the Freethinkers can truly complain of any hardship upon the score of conscience or opinion you will better be able to judge when you hear from themselves an account of the numbers progress and notions of their Sect which I doubt not they will communicate fully and freely provided no body present seem shocked or offended For in that case it is possible good manners may put them upon some reserve Oh said  Euphranor  I am never angry with any Man for his opinion whether he be  Jew Turk  or  Idolater  he may speak his mind freely to me without fear of offending I shou'd even be glad to hear what he hath to say provided he saith it in an ingenuous candid manner Whoever digs in the Mine of Truth I look on as my Fellowlabourer but if while I am taking true pains he diverts himself with teizing me and flinging Dust in mine Eyes I shall soon be tired of him  V  In the mean time  Alciphron  and  Lysicles  having dispatched what they went about returned to us  Lysicles  sate down where he had been before But  Alciphron  stood overagainst us with his arms folded across and his head reclined on the left shoulder in the posture of a Man meditating We sate silent not to disturb his thoughts and after two or three Minutes he uttered these words oh Truth oh Liberty after which he remained musing as before Upon this  Euphranor  took the freedom to interrupt him  Alciphron  said he it is not fair to spend your time in Soliloquies The conversation of learned and knowing Men is rarely to be met with in this corner and the opportunity you have put into my Hands I value too much not to make the best use of it  ALC  Are you then in earnest a Votary of Truth and is it possible you shou'd bear the liberty of a fair Inquiry  EUPH  It is what I desire of all things  ALC  What upon every Subject upon the notions you first sucked in with your Milk and which have been ever since nursed by parents pastors tutors religious assemblies books of Devotion and such methods of prepossessing Mens minds  EUPH  I love information upon all Subjects that come in my way and especially upon those that are most important  ALC  If then you are in earnest hold fair and stand firm while I probe your prejudices and extirpate your principles  Dum veteres avias tibi de pulmone revello  Having said thus  Alciphron  knit his brows and made a short pause after which he proceeded in the following manner If we are at the pains to dive and penetrate into the bottom of things and analyse Opinions into their first principles we shall find that those Opinions which are thought of greatest consequence have the slightest original being derived either from the casual customs of the Country where we live or from early instruction instilled into our tender minds before we are able to discern between right and wrong true and false The Vulgar by whom I understand all those who do not make a free  use of their Reason are apt to take these prejudices for things sacred and unquestionable believing them to be imprinted on the hearts of men by God himself or convey'd by Revelation from Heaven or to carry with them so great light and evidence as must force an assent without any inquiry or examination Thus the shallow Vulgar have their heads furnished with sundry conceits principles and doctrines religious moral and political all which they maintain with a zeal proportionable to their want of Reason On the other hand those who duly employ their faculties in the search of Truth take especial care to weed out of their minds and extirpate all such notions or prejudices as were planted in them before they arrived at the free and intire use of Reason This difficult task hath been successfully performed by our modern Freethinkers who have not only dissected with great Sagacity the received Systems and traced every established prejudice to the fountainhead the true and genuine motives of assent But also having been able to embrace in one comprehensive view the several parts and ages of the World they observed a wonderful variety of Customs and Rites of Institutions Religious and Civil of Notions and Opinions very unlike and even contrary one to another A certain sign they cannot all be true And yet they are all maintained by their several Partisans with the same positive air and warm zeal and if examined will be found to bottom on one and the same Foundation the strength of prejudice By the help of these Remarks and Discoveries they have broke through the bands of popular Custom and having freed themselves from Imposture do now generously lend a hand to their Fellow Subjects to lead them into the same paths of Light and Liberty Thus Gentlemen I have given you a summary account of the views and endeavours of those Men who are called Freethinkers If in the course of what I have said or shall say hereafter there be some things contrary to your preconceived Opinions  and therefore shocking and disagreeable you will pardon the freedom and plainness of a Philosopher and consider that whatever displeasure I give you of that kind I do it in strict regard to Truth and Obedience to your own commands I am very sensible that Eyes long kept in the dark cannot bear a sudden view of noon day light but must be brought to it by degrees It is for this Reason the ingenious Gentlemen of our Profession are accustomed to proceed gradually beginning with those prejudices to which Men have the least Attachment and thence proceeding to undermine the rest by slow and insensible degrees till they have demolished the whole Fabric of Human Folly and Superstition But the little time I can propose to spend here obligeth me to take a shorter course and be more direct and plain than possibly may be thought to suit with Prudence and good Manners Upon this we assured him he was at full liberty to speak his mind of Things Persons and Opinions without the least reserve It is a liberty replied  Alciphron  that we Freethinkers are equally willing to give and take We love to call things by their right Names and cannot endure that Truth shou'd suffer through Complaisance Let us therefore lay it down for a Preliminary that no offence be taken at any thing whatsoever shall be said on either side To which we all agreed  VI  In order then said  Alciphron  to find out the Truth we will suppose that I am bred up for instance in the Church of  England  When I come to maturity of Judgment and reflect on the particular Worship and Opinions of this Church I do not remember when or by what means they first took possession of my mind but there I find them from time immemorial Then casting an Eye on the Education of Children from whence I can make a judgment of my own I observe they are instructed in religious matters before they can reason about them and consequently  that all such instruction is nothing else but filling the tender mind of a Child with prejudices I do therefore reject all those religious notions which I consider as the other Follies of my Childhood I am confirmed in this way of thinking when I look abroad into the World where I observe Papists and several Sects of Dissenters which do all agree in a general profession of Belief in Christ but differ vastly one from another in the particulars of Faith and Worship I then enlarge my View so as to take in  Jews  and  Mahometans  between whom and the Christians I perceive indeed some small agreement in the Belief of one God but then they have each their distinct Laws and Revelations for which they express the same regard But extending my view still further to Heathenish and Idolatrous Nations I discover an endless variety not only in particular Opinions and Modes of Worship but even in the very notion of a Deity wherein they widely differ one from another and from all the forementioned Sects Upon the whole instead of Truth simple and uniform I perceive nothing but Discord Opposition and wild Pretensions all springing from the same source to wit the prejudice of Education From such reasonings and reflections as these thinking Men have concluded that all Religions are alike false and fabulous One is a Christian another a Jew a third a Mahometan a fourth an Idolatrous Gentile but all from one and the same reason because they happen to be bred up each in his respective Sect In the same manner therefore as each of these contending Parties condemns the rest so an unprejudiced standerby will condemn and reject them all together observing that they all draw their origin from the same fallacious Principle and are carried on by the same Artifice to answer the same ends of the Priest and the Magistrate  VII  EUPH  You hold then that the Magistrate concurs with the Priest in imposing on the People  ALC  I do and so must every one who considers things in a true light For you must know the Magistrates principal aim is to keep the People under him in awe Now the public Eye restrains Men from open Offences against the Laws and Government But to prevent secret Transgressions a Magistrate finds it expedient that Men shou'd believe there is an Eye of Providence watching over their private Actions and Designs And to intimidate those who might otherwise be drawn into Crimes by the prospect of Pleasure and Profit he gives them to understand that whoever escapes Punishment in this Life will be sure to find it in the next and that so heavy and lasting as infinitely to overbalance the Pleasure and Profit accruing from his Crimes Hence the Belief of a God the Immortality of the Soul and a future state of Rewards and Punishments have been esteemed useful Engines of Government And to the end that these notional airy Doctrines might make a sensible impression and be retained on the minds of Men skilful Rulers have in the several civilized Nations of the Earth devised Temples Sacrifices Churches Rites Ceremonies Habits Music Prayer Preaching and the like spiritual trumpery whereby the Priest maketh temporal gains and the Magistrate findeth his account in frightening and subduing the People This is the original of the Combination between Church and State of Religion by Law established of rights immunities and incomes of Priests all over the World There being no Government but wou'd have you fear God that you may honour the King or civil Power And you will ever observe that politic Princes keep up a good understanding with their Clergy to the end that they in return by inculcating Religion and Loyalty into the minds of the People may render them tame timorous and slavish  Crito  and I heard this Discourse of  Alciphron  with the utmost attention though without any appearance of surprize there being indeed nothing  in it to us new or unexpected But  Euphranor  who had never before been present at such Conversation cou'd not help shewing some Astonishment which  Lysicles  observing asked him with a lively Air how he liked  Alciphron  's Lecture It is said he the first I believe that you ever heard of the kind and requireth a strong Stomach to digest it  EUPH  I will own to you that my Digestion is none of the quickest but it hath sometimes by degrees been able to master things which at first appeared indigestible At present I admire the free Spirit and Eloquence of  Alciphron  but to speak the Truth I am rather astonished than convinced of the Truth of his Opinions How said he turning to  Alciphron  is it then possible you shou'd not believe the Being of a God  ALC  To be plain with you I do not  VIII  But this is what I foresaw a Flood of Light let in at once upon the Mind being apt to dazzle and disorder rather than enlighten it Was I not pinched in Time the regular way would be to have begun with the Circumstantials of Religion next to have attacked the Mysteries of Christianity after that proceeded to the practical Doctrines and in the last place to have extirpated that which of all other religious Prejudices being the first taught and Basis of the rest hath taken the deepest root in our Minds I mean the Belief of a God I do not wonder it sticks with you having known several very ingenious Men who found it difficult to free themselves from this Prejudice  EUPH  All Men have not the same Alacrity and Vigour in thinking for my own part I find it a hard matter to keep pace with you  ALC  To help you I will go a little way back and resume the Thread of my Reasoning First I must acquaint you That having applied my Mind to contemplate the Idea of Truth I discovered it to be of a stable permanent and uniform nature not various and changeable like Modes or Fashions and things depending  on Fancy In the next place having observed several Sects and Subdivisions of Sects espousing very different and contrary Opinions and yet all professing Christianity I rejected those Points wherein they differed retaining only that which was agreed to by all and so became a  Latitudinarian  Having afterwards upon a more enlarged View of things perceived that Christians Jews and Mahometans had each their different Systems of Faith agreeing only in the Belief of one God I became a  Deist  Lastly extending my View to all the other various Nations which inhabit this Globe and finding they agreed in no one Point of Faith but differed one from another as well as from the forementioned Sects even in the Notion of a God in which there is as great Diversity as in the Methods of Worship I thereupon became an  Atheist  it being my Opinion that a Man of Courage and Sense shou'd follow his Argument wherever it leads him and that nothing is more ridiculous than to be a Freethinker by halves I approve the Man who makes thorough Work and not content with lopping off the Branches extirpates the very Root from which they sprung  IX  Atheism therefore that Bugbear of Women and Fools is the very Top and Perfection of Freethinking It is the grand  Arcanum  to which a true Genius naturally riseth by a certain Climax or Gradation of Thought and without which he can never possess his Soul in absolute Liberty and Repose For your thorough Conviction in this main Article do but examine the Notion of a God with the same Freedom that you would other Prejudices Trace it to the fountainhead and you shall not find that you had it by any of your Senses the only true means of discovering what is real and substantial in Nature You will find it lying amongst other old Lumber in some obscure corner of the Imagination the proper Receptacle of Visions Fancies and Prejudices of all  kinds and if you are more attached to this than the rest it is only because it is the oldest This is all take my Word for it and not mine only but that of many more the most ingenious Men of the Age who I can assure you think as I do on the Subject of a Deity Though some of them hold it proper to proceed with more Reserve in declaring to the World their Opinion in this Particular than in most others And it must be owned there are still too many in  England  who retain a foolish Prejudice against the Name of Atheist But it lessens every Day among the better sort and when it is quite worn out our Freethinkers may then and not till then be said to have given the finishing Stroke to Religion it being evident that so long as the Existence of God is believed Religion must subsist in some Shape or other But the Root being once plucked up the Scions which shot from it will of course wither and decay Such are all those whimsical Notions of Conscience Duty Principle and the like which fill a Man's Head with Scruples awe him with Fears and make him a more thorough Slave than the Horse he rides A Man had better a thousand times be hunted by Bailiffs or Messengers than haunted by these Spectres which embarass and embitter all his Pleasures creating the most real and sore Servitude upon Earth But the Freethinker with a vigorous flight of Thought breaks through those airy Springes and asserts his original Independency Others indeed may talk and write and fight about Liberty and make an outward Pretence to it but the Freethinker alone is truly free  Alciphron  having ended this Discourse with an Air of Triumph  Euphranor  spoke to him in the following Manner You make clear Work The Gentlemen of your Profession are it seems admirable Weeders You have rooted up a world of Notions I shou'd be glad to see what fine things you have planted in their stead  ALC  Have Patience good  Euphranor  I will shew you in the first place That whatever was  sound and good we leave untouched and encourage it to grow in the Mind of Man And secondly I will shew you what excellent things we have planted in it You must know then that pursuing our close and severe Scrutiny we do at last arrive at something solid and real in which all Mankind agree to wit the Appetites Passions and Senses These are founded in Nature are real have real Objects and are attended with real and substantial Pleasures Food Drink Sleep and the like animal Enjoyments being what all Men like and love And if we extend our view to the other kinds of Animals we shall find them all agree in this that they have certain natural Appetites and Senses in the gratifying and satisfying of which they are constantly employ'd Now these real natural good things which include nothing of Notion or Fancy we are so far from destroying that we do all we can to cherish and improve them According to us every wise Man looks upon himself or his own bodily Existence in this present World as the Center and ultimate End of all his Actions and Regards He considers his Appetites as natural Guides directing to his proper Good his Passions and Senses as the natural true Means of enjoying this Good Hence he endeavours to keep his Appetites in high Relish his Passions and Senses strong and lively and to provide the greatest Quantity and Variety of real Objects suited to them which he studieth to enjoy by all possible means and in the highest Perfection imaginable And the Man who can do this without Restraint Remorse or Fear is as happy as any other Animal whatsoever or as his Nature is capable of being Thus I have given you a succinct View of the Principles Discoveries and Tenets of the select Spirits of this enlightned Age  X  Crito  remarked that  Alciphron  had spoke his Mind with great Clearness Yes replied  Euphranor  we are obliged to the Gentleman for letting us at once  into the Tenets of his Sect But if I may be allowed to speak my Mind  Alciphron  though in compliance with my own Request hath given me no small Uneasiness You need said  Alciphron  make no Apology for speaking freely what you think to one who professeth himself a Freethinker I shou'd be sorry to make one whom I meant to oblige uneasy Pray let me know wherein I have offended I am half ashamed replied  Euphranor  to own that I who am no great Genius have a Weakness incidental to little ones I wou'd say that I have favourite Opinions which you represent to be Errors and Prejudices For Instance the Immortality of the Soul is a Notion I am fond of as what supports the Mind with a very pleasing Prospect And if it be an Error I shou'd perhaps be of  Tully  's Mind who in that Case professed he shou'd be sorry to know the Truth acknowledging no sort of Obligation to certain Philosophers in his Days who taught the Soul of Man was mortal They were it seems Predecessors to those who are now called Freethinkers which Name being too general and indefinite inasmuch as it comprehends all those who think for themselves whether they agree in Opinon with these Gentlemen or no it shou'd not seem amiss to assign them a specific Appellation or peculiar Name whereby to distinguish them from other Philosophers at least in our present Conference For I cannot bear to argue against Freethinking and Freethinkers  ALC  In the Eyes of a wise Man Words are of small moment We do not think Truth attached to a Name  EUPH  If you please then to avoid Confusion let us call your Sect by the same Name that  Tully  who understood the force of Language bestow'd upon them  ALC  With all my heart Pray what may that Name be  EUPH  Why he calls them  Minute Philosophers  Right said  Crito  the modern Freethinkers are the very same with those  Cicero  called Minute Philosophers which Name admirably suits them they being a sort  of Sect which diminish all the most valuable things the thoughts views and hopes of Men all the Knowledge Notions and Theories of the Mind they reduce to Sense Humane Nature they contract and degrade to the narrow low Standard of Animal Life and assign us only a small pittance of Time instead of Immortality  Alciphron  very gravely remark'd That the Gentlemen of his Sect had done no injury to Man and that if he be a little shortlived contemptible Animal it was not their saying it made him so And they were no more to blame for whatever defects they discover than a faithful Glass for making the wrinkles which it only shews As to what you observe said he of those we now call Freethinkers having been anciently termed  Minute Philosophers  it is my opinion this Appellation might be derived from their considering things minutely and not swallowing them in the gross as other Men are used to do Besides we all know the best Eyes are necessary to discern the minutest Objects It seems therefore that Minute Philosophers might have been so called from their distinguished perspicacity  EUPH  O  Alciphron  these Minute Philosophers since that is their true Name are a sort of Pirates who plunder all that come in their way I consider my self as a Man left stript and desolate on a bleak Beach  XI  But who are these profound and learned Men that of late Years have demolished the whole Fabric which Lawgivers Philosophers and Divines had been erecting for so many Ages  Lysicles  hearing these words smiled and said he believed  Euphranor  had figured to himself Philosophers in square caps and long gowns but thanks to these happy Times the Reign of Pedantry was over Our Philosophers said he are of a very different kind from those aukward Students who think to come at Knowledge by poring on dead Languages and old Authors or  by sequestring themselves from the Cares of the World to meditate in Solitude and Retirement They are the best bred Men of the Age Men who know the World Men of pleasure Men of fashion and fine Gentlemen  EUPH  I have some small notion of the People you mention but shou'd never have taken them for Philosophers  CRI  Nor wou'd any one else till of late The World it seems was long under a mistake about the way to Knowledge thinking it lay through a tedious course of Academical Education and Study But among the Discoveries of the present Age one of the principal is the finding out that such a Method doth rather retard and obstruct than promote Knowledge  ALC  Academical Study may be comprised in two points Reading and Meditation Their Reading is chiefly employ'd on ancient Authors in dead Languages so that a great part of their Time is spent in learning Words which when they have mastered with infinite pains what do they get by it but old and obselete Notions that are now quite exploded and out of use Then as to their Meditations what can they possibly be good for He that wants the proper Materials of Thought may think and meditate for ever to no purpose Those Cobwebs spun by Scholars out of their own Brains being alike unserviceable either for Use or Ornament Proper Ideas or Materials are only to be got by frequenting good Company I know several Gentlemen who since their Appearance in the World have spent as much time in rubbing off the rust and pedantry of a College Education as they had done before in acquiring it  LYS  I'll undertake a Lad of fourteen bred in the modern way shall make a better Figure and be more considered in any DrawingRoom or Assembly of polite People than one of four and twenty who hath lain by a long time at School and College He shall say better things in a better manner and be more liked by good Judges  EUPH  Where doth he pick up all this Improvement  CRI  Where our grave Ancestors wou'd never have look'd for it in a DrawingRoom a CoffeeHouse a ChocolateHouse at the Tavern or GroomPorter's In these and the like fashionable Places of Resort it is the Custom for polite Persons to speak freely on all Subjects religious moral or political So that a young Gentleman who frequents them is in the way of hearing many instructive Lectures seasoned with Wit and Raillery and uttered with Spirit Three or four Sentences from a Man of quality spoke with a good Air make more Impression and convey more Knowledge than a dozen Dissertations in a dry Academical way  EUPH  There is then no Method or Course of Studies in those Places  LYS  None but an easy free Conversation which takes in every thing that offers without any Rule or Design  EUPH  I always thought that some Order was necessary to attain any useful degree of Knowledge that Haste and Confusion begat a conceited Ignorance that to make our Advances sure they shou'd be gradual and those Points first learned which might cast a light on what was to follow  ALC  So long as Learning was to be obtained only by that slow formal course of Study few of the better sort knew much of it but now it is grown an Amusement our young Gentry and Nobility imbibe it insensibly amidst their Diversions and make a considerable Progress  EUPH  Hence probably the great number of Minute Philosophers  CRI  It is to this that Sect is owing for so many ingenious Proficients of both Sexes You may now commonly see what no former Age ever saw a young Lady or a  Petit Maitre  nonplus a Divine or an oldfashioned Gentleman who hath read many a  Greek  and  Latin  Author and spent much Time in hard methodical Study  EUPH  It shou'd seem then that Method Exactness and Industry are a Disadvantage Here  Alciphron  turning to  Lysicles  said he cou'd make the point very clear if  Euphranor  had any notion of  Painting  EUPH  I never saw a firstrate Picture in my Life but have a tolerable Collection of Prints and have seen some good Drawings  ALC  You know then the difference between the  Dutch  and the  Italian  manner  EUPH  I have some notion of it  ALC  Suppose now a Drawing finished by the nice and laborious Touches of a  Dutch  Pencil and another off hand scratched out in the free manner of a great  Italian  Master The  Dutch  Piece which hath cost so much pains and time will be exact indeed but without that Force Spirit or Grace which appear in the other and are the Effects of an easy free Pencil Do but apply this and the Point will be clear  EUPH  Pray inform me did those great  Italian  Masters begin and proceed in their Art without any choice of Method or Subject and always draw with the same ease and freedom Or did they observe some Method beginning with simple and elementary parts an Eye a Nose a Finger which they drew with great pains and care often drawing the same thing in order to draw it correctly and so proceeding with Patience and Industry till after a considerable length of Time they arrived at the free masterly manner you speak of If this were the Case I leave you to make the Application  ALC  You may dispute the Matter if you please But a Man of parts is one thing and a Pedant another Pains and Method may do for some sort of People A Man must be a long time kindling wet Straw into a vile smothering Flame but Spirits blaze out at once  EUPH  The Minute Philosophers have it seems better Parts than other Men which qualifies them for a different Education  ALC  Tell me  Euphranor  what is it that gives one Man a better Mien than another more Politeness in Dress Speech and Motion Nothing but frequenting good Company By the same means Men get insensibly a delicate Taste a refined Judgment a certain Politeness in thinking and expressing one's self No wonder if you Countrymen are strangers to the  Advantage of polite Conversation which constantly keeps the Mind awake and active exercising its Faculties and calling forth all its Strength and Spirit on a thousand different Occasions and Subjects that never came in the way of a Bookworm in a College no more than of a Ploughman  CRI  Hence those lively Faculties that quickness of Apprehension that slyness of Ridicule that egregious Talent of Wit and Humour which distinguish the Gentlemen of your Profession  EUPH  It shou'd seem then that your Sect is made up of what you call fine Gentlemen  LYS  Not altogether for we have among us some contemplative Spirits of a coarser Education who from observing the Behaviour and Proceedings of Apprentices Watermen Porters and the Assemblies of Rabble in the Streets have arrived at a profound Knowledge of Humane Nature and made great Discoveries about the Principles Springs and Motives of moral Actions These have demolished the received Systems and done a world of good in the City  ALC  I tell you we have Men of all Sorts and Professions plodding Citizens thriving Stockjobbers skilful Men in Business polite Courtiers gallant Men of the Army but our chief Strength and Flower of the Flock are those promising young Men who have the Advantage of a modern Education These are the growing Hopes of our Sect by whose Credit and Influence in a few Years we expect to see those great things accomplished that we have in view  EUPH  I cou'd never have imagined your Sect so considerable  ALC  There are in  England  many honest Folk as much in the dark about these matters as your selves  XII  To judge of the prevailing Opinion among People of fashion by what a Senator saith in the House a Judge upon the Bench or a Priest in the Pulpit who all speak according to Law that is to the reverend prejudices of our Forefathers wou'd  be wrong You should go into good Company and mind what Men of parts and breeding say those who are best heard and most admired as well in public places of resort as in private visits He only who hath these opportunities can know our real strength our numbers and the figure that we make  EUPH  By your account there must be many Minute Philosophers among the Men of Rank and Fortune  ALC  Take my word for it not a few and they do much contribute to the spreading our notions For he who knows the World must observe that fashions constantly descend It is therefore the right way to propagate an Opinion from the upper end Not to say that the Patronage of such Men is an encouragement to our Authors  EUPH  It seems then you have Authors among you  LYS  That we have several and those very great Men who have obliged the World with many useful and profound discoveries  CRI Moschon  for instance hath proved that Man and Beast are really of the same nature That consequently a Man need only indulge his Senses and Appetites to be as happy as a Brute  Gorgias  hath gone further demonstrating Man to be a piece of Clockwork or Machine and that Thought or Reason are the same thing as the impulse of one Ball against another  Cimon  hath made noble use of these discoveries proving as clearly as any proposition in Mathematics that conscience is a whim and morality a prejudice and that a Man is no more accountable for his actions than a Clock is for striking  Tryphon  hath written irrefragably on the usefulness of vice  Thrasenor  hath confuted the foolish prejudice Men had against Atheism shewing that a republick of Atheists might live very happily together  Demylus  hath made a jest of Loyalty and convinced the World there is nothing in it To him and another Philosopher of the same stamp this age is indebted for discovering that public Spirit is an idle Enthusiasm which seizeth only on weak minds It wou'd be endless to  recount the Discoveries made by writers of this Sect  LYS  But the Masterpiece and finishing Stroke is a learned Anecdote of our great  Diagoras  containing a demonstration against the Being of God which it is convinced the public is not yet ripe for But I am assured by some judicious Friends who have seen it that it is as clear as Daylight and will do a world of good at one blow demolishing the whole System of Religion These discoveries are published by our Philosophers sometimes in just Volumes but often in Phamphlets and loose Papers for their readier conveyance through the Kingdom And to them must be ascribed that absolute and independent freedom which groweth so fast to the terrour of all Bigots Even the dull and ignorant begin to open their Eyes and be influenced by the example and authority of so many ingenious Men  EUPH  It shou'd seem by this account that your Sect extend their discoveries beyond Religion and that Loyalty to his Prince or Reverence for the Laws are but mean things in the Eye of a Minute Philosopher  LYS  Very mean we are too wise to think there is any thing Sacred either in King or Constitution or indeed in any thing else A Man of Sense may perhaps seem to pay an occasional regard to his Prince but this is no more at bottom than what he pays to God when he kneels at the Sacrament to qualify himself himself for an Office Fear God and honour the King are a pair of slavish maxims which had for a long time crampt Human Nature and awed not only weak minds but even Men of good Understanding till their Eyes as I observed before were opened by our Philosophers  EUPH  Methinks I can easily comprehend that when the fear of God is quite extinguished the mind must be very easy with respect to other Duties which become outward pretences and formalities from the moment that they quit their hold upon the Conscience and Conscience always supposeth the Being of a God But I still  thought that  Englishmen  of all denominations how widely soever they differ as to some particular points agreed in the Belief of a God and of so much at least as is called natural Religion  ALC  I have already told you my own Opinion of those matters and what I know to be the Opinion of many more  CRI  Probably  Euphranor  by the title of  Deists  which is sometimes given to Minute Philosophers you have been misled to imagine they believe and worship a God according to the light of Nature but by living among them you may soon be convinced of the contrary They have neither time nor place nor form of Divine worship they offer neither Prayers nor Praises to God in public and in their private practice shew a contempt or dislike even of the Duties of natural Religion For instance the saying Grace before and after meals is a plain point of natural worship and was once universally practised but in proportion as this Sect prevailed it hath been laid aside not only by the Minute Philosophers themselves who wou'd be infinitely ashamed of such a weakness as to beg God's blessing or give God thanks for their daily Food but also by others who are afraid of being thought Fools by the Minute Philosophers  EUPH  Is it possible that Men who really believe a God shou'd yet decline paying so easy and reasonable a Duty for fear of incurring the contempt of Atheists  CRI  I tell you there are many who believing in their Hearts the truth of Religion are yet afraid or ashamed to own it lest they shou'd forfeit their Reputation with those who have the good luck to pass for great wits and Men of genius  ALC  O  Euphranor  we must make allowance for  Crito  's prejudice he is a worthy Gentleman and means well But doth it not look like prejudice to ascribe the respect that is paid our ingenious Freethinkers rather to good luck than to merit  EUPH  I acknowledge their merit to be very wonderful and that those Authors must needs be great  Men who are able to prove such Paradoxes for example That so knowing a Man as a Minute Philosopher shou'd be a meer Machine or at best no better than a Brute  ALC  It is a true maxim that a Man shou'd think with the Learned and speak with the Vulgar I shou'd be loth to place a Gentleman of merit in such a light before prejudiced and ignorant Men The tenets of our Philosophy have this in common with many other Truths in Metaphysics Geometry Astronomy and natural Philosophy that vulgar ears cannot bear them All our discoveries and notions are in themselves true and certain but they are at present known only to the better sort and wou'd sound strange and odd among the Vulgar But this it is to be hoped will wear off with time  EUPH  I do not wonder that vulgar minds shou'd be startled at the notions of your Philosophy  CRI  Truly a very curious sort of Philosophy and much to be admired  XIII  The profound Thinkers of this way have taken a direct contrary course to all the great Philosophers of former ages who made it their Endeavour to raise and refine Humane Kind and remove it as far as possible from the Brute to moderate and subdue Mens Appetites to remind them of the dignity of their nature to awaken and improve their superior Faculties and direct them to the noblest Objects to possess Mens minds with a high Sense of the Divinity of the supreme Good and the Immortality of the Soul They took great pains to strengthen the Obligations to Virtue and upon all those Subjects have wrought out noble Theories and treated with singular force of Reason But it seems our Minute Philosophers act the reverse of all other wise and thinking Men it being their end and aim to erase the Principles of all that is great and good from the mind of Man to unhinge all order of civil Life to undermine the foundations of morality and instead  of improving and ennobling our natures to bring us down to the maxims and way of thinking of the most uneducated and barbarous nations and even to degrade Humane Kind to a level with Brute Beasts And all the while they wou'd pass upon the World for Men of deep Knowledge But in effect what is all this negative Knowledge better than downright savage Ignorance That there is no Providence no Spirit no future State no moral Duty truly a fine System for an honest Man to own or an ingenious Man to value himself upon  Alciphron  who heard this discourse with some uneasiness very gravely replied Disputes are not to be decided by the weight of Authority but by the force of Reason You may pass indeed general reflexions on our notions and call them brutal and barbarous if you please But it is such brutality and such barbarism as few cou'd have attained to if Men of the greatest Genius had not broke the Ice there being nothing more difficult than to get the better of Education and conquer old prejudices To remove and cast off a heap of Rubbish that has been gathering upon the Soul from our very infancy requires great courage and great strength of Faculties Our Philosophers therefore do well deserve the name of  Esprits forts Men of strong heads Freethinkers  and such like Appellations betokening great force and liberty of mind It is very possible the Heroic Labours of these Men may be represented for what is not capable of misrepresentation as a piratical plundering and stripping the mind of its wealth and ornaments when it is in truth the divesting it only of its prejudices and reducing it to its untainted original State of Nature Oh Nature the genuine Beauty of pure Nature  EUPH  You seem very much taken with the Beauty of Nature Be pleased to tell me  Alciphron  what those things are which you esteem natural or by what mark I may know them  XIV  ALC  For a thing to be natural for instance to the mind of Man it must appear originally therein it must be universally in all Men it must be invariably the same in all Nations and Ages These limitations of original universal and invariable exclude all those notions found in the Humane Mind which are the effect of Custom and Education The case is the same with respect to all other Species of Beings A Cat for example hath a natural inclination to pursue a Mouse because it agrees with the forementioned marks But if a Cat be taught to play tricks you will not say those tricks are natural For the same reason if upon a Plumbtree Peaches and Apricots are engrafted no body will say they are the natural growth of the Plumbtree  EUPH  But to return to  Man  It seems you allow those things alone to be natural to him which shew themselves upon his first entrance into the World to wit the Senses and such Passions and Appetites as are discovered upon the first application of their respective objects  ALC  That is my opinion  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  if from a young Appletree after a certain period of time there shou'd shoot forth Leaves Blossoms and Apples wou'd you deny these things to be natural because they did not discover and display themselves in the tender bud  ALC  I wou'd not  EUPH  And suppose that in a Man after a certain season the Appetite of Lust or the Faculty of Reason shall shoot forth open and display themselves as Leaves and Blossoms do in a Tree wou'd you therefore deny them to be natural to him because they did not appear in his original infancy  ALC  I acknowledge I wou'd not  EUPH  It seems therefore that the first mark of a thing's being natural to the mind was not warily laid down by you to wit that it shou'd appear originally in it  ALC  It seems so  EUPH  Again inform me  Alciphron  whether you do not think it natural for an Orangeplant to produce Oranges  ALC  I do  EUPH  But plant it in the  North end of  Great Britain  and it shall with care produce perhaps a good Sallad in the Southern parts of the same Island it may with much pains and culture thrive and produce indifferent Fruit but in  Portugal  or  Naples  it will produce much better with little or no pains Is this true or not  ALC  It is true  EUPH  The Plant being the same in all places doth not produce the same Fruit Sun Soil and Cultivation making a difference  ALC  I grant it  EUPH  And since the case is you say the same with respect to all Species why may we not conclude by a parity of reason that things may be natural to Human Kind and yet neither found in all Men nor invariably the same where they are found  ALC  Hold  Euphranor  you must explain yourself further I shall not be over hasty in my concessions  LYS  You are in the right  Alciphron  to stand upon your guard I do not like these ensnaring Questions  EUPH  I desire you to make no concessions in complaisance to me but only to tell me your opinion upon each particular that we may understand one another know wherein we agree and proceed jointly in finding out the Truth But added  Euphranor  turning to  Crito  and me if the Gentlemen are against a free and fair inquiry I shall give them no further trouble  ALC  Our Opinions will stand the test We fear no trial proceed as you please  EUPH  It seems then that from what you have granted it shou'd follow Things may be natural to Men although they do not actually shew themselves in all Men nor in equal perfection there being as great difference of culture and every other advantage with respect to Humane Nature as is to be found with respect to the vegetable nature of Plants to use your own similitude Is it so or not  ALC  It is  EUPH  Answer me  Alciphron  do not Men in all times and places when they arrive at a certain Age express their Thoughts by Speech  ALC  They do  EUPH  Shou'd it not seem then that Language is natural  ALC  It shou'd  EUPH  And yet there is a great variety of Languages  ALC  I acknowledge there is  EUPH  From all this will it not follow a thing may be natural and yet admit of variety  ALC  I grant it will  EUPH  Shou'd it not seem therefore to follow that a thing may be natural to Mankind though it have not those marks or conditions assigned though it be not original universal and invariable  ALC  It shou'd  EUPH  And that consequently religious Worship and civil Government may be natural to Man notwithstanding they admit of sundry forms and different degrees of Perfection  ALC  It seems so  EUPH  You have granted already that Reason is natural to Mankind  ALC  I have  EUPH  Whatever therefore is agreeable to Reason is agreeable to the nature of Man  ALC  It is  EUPH  Will it not follow from hence that Truth and Virtue are natural to Man  ALC  Whatever is reasonable I admit to be natural  EUPH  And as those Fruits which grow from the most generous and mature stock in the choicest soil and with the best culture are most esteemed even so ought we not to think those sublime Truths which are the Fruits of mature Thought and have been rationally deduced by Men of the best and most improved understandings to be the choicest productions of the rational nature of Man And if so being in fact reasonable natural and true they ought not to be esteemed unnatural whims errors of education and groundless prejudices because they are raised and forwarded by manuring and cultivating our tender minds because they take early root and sprout forth betimes by the care and diligence of our Instructors  ALC  Agreed provided still they may be rationally deduced But to take this for granted of what Men vulgarly call the Truths of Morality and Religion wou'd be begging the question  EUPH  You are in the right I do not therefore take for granted  that they are rationally deduced I only suppose that if they are they must be allowed natural to Man or in other words agreeable to and growing from the most excellent and peculiar part of Humane Nature  ALC  I have nothing to object to this  EUPH  What shall we think then of your former Assertions That nothing is natural to Man but what may be found in all Men in all Nations and Ages of the World That to obtain a genuine view of Humane Nature we must extirpate all the effects of Education and Instruction and regard only the Senses Appetites and Passions which are to be found originally in all Mankind That therefore the notion of a God can have no foundation in nature as not being originally in the mind nor the same in all Men Be pleased to reconcile these things with your late concessions which the force of Truth seems to have extorted from you  XV  ALC  Tell me  Euphranor  whether Truth be not one and the same uniform invariable thing and if so whether the many different and inconsistent notions which Men entertain of God and Duty be not a plain proof there is no Truth in them  EUPH  That Truth is constant and uniform I freely own and that consequently Opinions repugnant to each other cannot be true but I think it will not hence follow they are all alike false If among various Opinions about the same thing one be grounded on clear and evident Reasons that is to be thought true and others only so far as they consist with it Reason is the same and rightly applied will lead to the same conclusions in all times and places  Socrates  two thousand years ago seems to have reasoned himself into the same notion of a God which is entertained by the Philosophers of our days if you will allow that name to any who are not Atheists And the remark of  Confucius  That a Man shou'd guard in his youth against  Lust in manhood against Faction and in old age against Covetousness is as current morality in  Europe  as in  China ALC  But still it wou'd be a satisfaction if all Men thought the same way difference of Opinions implying uncertainty  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  what you take to be the cause of a Lunar Eclipse  ALC  The shadow of the Earth interposing between the Sun and Moon  EUPH  Are you assured of this  ALC  Undoubtedly  EUPH  Are all Mankind agreed in this Truth  ALC  By no means Ignorant and barbarous People assign different ridiculous causes of this appearance  EUPH  It seems then there are different Opinions about the nature of an Eclipse  ALC  There are  EUPH  And nevertheless one of these Opinions is true  ALC  It is  EUPH  Diversity therefore of Opinions about a thing doth not hinder but that the thing may be and one of the Opinions concerning it may be true  ALC  I acknowledge it  EUPH  It shou'd seem therefore that your Argument against the Belief of a God from the variety of Opinions about his nature is not conclusive Nor do I see how you can conclude against the truth of any moral or religious tenet from the various Opinions of Men upon the same Subject might not a Man as well argue that no historical account of a matter of fact can be true when different relations are given of it Or may we not as well infer that because the several Sects of Philosophy maintain different opinions none of them can be in the right not even the  Minute Philosophers  themselves During this conversation  Lysicles  seemed uneasy like one that wished in his heart there was no God  Alciphron  said he methinks you sit by very tamely while  Euphranor  saps the foundation of our Tenets Be of good courage replied  Alciphron  a skilful gamester has been known to ruin his adversary by yielding him some advantage at first I am glad said he turning to  Euphranor  that you are drawn in  to argue and make your appeals to Reason For my part wherever Reason leads I shall not be afraid to follow Know then  Euphranor  that I freely give up what you now contend for I do not value the success of a few crude notions thrown out in a loose discourse any more than the  Turks  do the loss of that vile infantry they place in the front of their armies for no other end but to waste the powder and blunt the swords of their enemies Be assured I have in reserve a body of otherguess arguments which I am ready to produce I will undertake to prove  EUPH  O  Alciphron  I do not doubt your faculty of proving But before I put you to the trouble of any farther proofs I shou'd be glad to know whether the notions of your Minute Philosophy are worth proving I mean whether they are of use and service to Mankind  XV  ALC  As to that give me leave to tell you a thing may be useful to one Man's Views and not to another's but Truth is Truth whether useful or not and must not be measured by the Convenience of this or that Man or Party of Men  EUPH  But is not the general Good of Mankind to be regarded as a rule and measure of moral Truths of all such Truths as direct or influence the moral Actions of Men  ALC  That Point is not clear to me I know indeed that Legislators and Divines and Politicians have always alledged That it is necessary to the wellbeing of Mankind that they shou'd be kept in awe by the slavish Notions of Religion and Morality But granting all this how will it prove these Notions to be true Convenience is one thing and Truth is another A genuine Philosopher therefore will overlook all Advantages and consider only Truth it self as such  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  is your genuine Philosopher a wise Man or a Fool  ALC  Without question the wisest of Men  EUPH  Which is to be thought the wise Man he who acts with design  or he who acts at random  ALC  He who acts with design  EUPH  Whoever acts with design acts for some end Doth he not  ALC  He doth  EUPH  And a wise Man for a good end  ALC  True  EUPH  And he sheweth his Wisdom in making choice of fit means to obtain his end  ALC  I acknowledge it  EUPH  By how much therefore the end proposed is more excellent and by how much fitter the means employ'd are to obtain it so much the wiser is the Agent to be esteemed  ALC  This seems to be true  EUPH  Can a rational Agent propose a more excellent end than Happiness  ALC  He cannot  EUPH  Of good things the greater Good is most excellent  ALC  Doubtless  EUPH  Is not the general happiness of Mankind a greater Good than the private happiness of one Man or of some certain Men  ALC  It is  EUPH  Is it not therefore the most excellent end  ALC  It seems so  EUPH  Are not then those who pursue this end by the properest methods to be thought the wisest Men  ALC  I grant they are  EUPH  Which is a wise Man govern'd by wise or foolish Notions  ALC  By wise doubtless  EUPH  It seems then to follow that he who promotes the general wellbeing of Mankind by the proper necessary means is truly wise and acts upon wise grounds  ALC  It shou'd seem so  EUPH  And is not Folly of an opposite nature to Wisdom  ALC  It is  EUPH  Might it not therefore be inferred that those Men are foolish who go about to unhinge such Principles as have a necessary connexion with the general good of Mankind  ALC  Perhaps this might be granted but at the same time I must observe that it is in my power to deny it  EUPH  How you will not surely deny the Conclusion when you admit the Premises  ALC  I wou'd fain know upon what terms we argue whether in this progress of Question and Answer if a Man makes a slip it be utterly irretrievable For if you are on the catch to lay hold  of every advantage without allowing for surprise or inattention I must tell you this is not the way to convince my Judgment  EUPH  O  Alciphron  I aim not at Triumph but at Truth You are therefore at full liberty to unravel all that hath been said and to recover or correct any slip you have made But then you must distinctly point it out otherwise it will be impossible ever to arrive at any conclusion  ALC  I agree with you upon these terms jointly to proceed in search of Truth for to that I am sincerely devoted In the progress of our present Inquiry I was it seems guilty of an oversight in acknowledging the general happiness of Mankind to be a greater Good than the particular happiness of one Man For in fact the individual happiness of every Man alone constitutes his own entire Good The happiness of other Men making no part of mine is not with respect to me a Good I mean a true natural Good It cannot therefore be a reasonable end to be proposed by me in Truth and Nature for I do not speak of political pretences since no wise Man will pursue an end which doth not concern him This is the voice of Nature Oh Nature thou art the fountain original and pattern of all that is good and wise  EUPH  You wou'd like then to follow Nature and propose her as a guide and pattern for your imitation  ALC  Of all things  EUPH  Whence do you gather this respect for Nature  ALC  From the excellency of her Productions  EUPH  In a Vegetable for instance you say there is use and excellency because the several parts of it are so connected and fitted to each other as to protect and nourish the whole make the individual grow and propagate the kind and because in its fruits or qualities it is adapted to please the Sense or contribute to the benefit of Man  ALC  Even so  EUPH  In like manner do you not infer the excellency of Animal Bodies from observing the frame and fitness of their several parts by which they mutually conspire to the wellbeing of each other  as well as of the whole Do you not also observe a natural union and consent between Animals of the same kind and that even different kinds of Animals have certain qualities and instincts whereby they contribute to the exercise nourishment and delight of each other Even the inanimate unorganized Elements seem to have an excellence relative to each other Where was the excellency of Water if it did not cause Herbs and Vegetables to spring from the Earth and put forth flowers and fruits And what wou'd become of the beauty of the Earth if it was not warmed by the Sun moistened by Water and fanned by Air Throughout the whole System of the visible and natural World do you not perceive a mutual connexion and correspondence of parts And is it not from hence that you frame an Idea of the perfection and order and beauty of Nature  ALC  All this I grant  EUPH  And have not the Stoics heretofore said who were no more Bigots than you are and did you not your self say this pattern of Order was worthy the imitation of rational Agents  ALC  I do not deny this to be true  EUPH  Ought we not therefore to infer the same Union Order and Regularity in the moral World that we perceive to be in the natural  ALC  We ought  EUPH  Shou'd it not therefore seem to follow that reasonable Creatures were as the philosophical Emperor  M Antonin l  observes made one for another and consequently that  Man  ought not to consider himself as an independent Individual whose happiness is not connected with that of other Men but rather as the part of a whole to the common good of which he ought to conspire and order his Ways and Actions suitably if he wou'd live according to Nature  ALC  Supposing this to be true what then  EUPH  Will it not follow that a wise Man  shou'd consider and pursue his private Good with regard to and in conjunction with that of other Men in granting of which you thought your self guilty of an oversight Though indeed the sympathy of pain and pleasure and the mutual affections by which Mankind are knit together have been always allowed a plain proof of this point And though it was the constant Doctrine of those who were esteemed the wisest and most thinking Men among the Ancients as the Platonists Peripatetics and Stoics to say nothing of Christians whom you pronounce to be an unthinking prejudiced sort of people  ALC  I shall not dispute this point with you  EUPH  Since therefore we are so far agreed shou'd it not seem to follow from the Premises That the belief of a God of a future State and of moral Duties are the only wise right and genuine Principles of Humane Conduct in case they have a necessary connection with the wellbeing of Mankind This Conclusion you have been led to by your own concessions and by the analogy of Nature  ALC  I have been drawn into it step by step through several Preliminaries which I cannot well call to mind but one thing I observe that you build on the necessary connection those Principles have with the wellbeing of Mankind which is a point neither proved nor granted  LYS  This I take to be a grand fundamental Prejudice as I doubt not if I had time I cou'd make appear But it is now late and we will if you think fit defer this Subject till tomorrow Upon

Alciphron  and  Lysicles  said the Weather was so fine they had a mind to spend the Day abroad and take a cold Dinner under a Shade in some pleasant part of the Country Whereupon after Breakfast we went down to a Beach about  half a mile off where we walked on the smooth sand with the Ocean on one hand and on the other wild broken Rocks intermixed with shady Trees and Springs of Water till the Sun began to be uneasy We then withdrew into a hollow Glade between two Rocks where we had no sooner seated our selves but  Lysicles  addressing himself to  Euphranor  said I am now ready to perform what I undertook last Evening which was to shew there is nothing in that necessary Connection which some Men imagine between those Principles you contend for and the public Good I freely own that if this Question was to be decided by the authority of Legislators or Philosophers it must go against us For those Men generally take it for granted that Vice is pernicious to the Public and that Men cannot be kept from Vice but by the fear of God and the sense of a future State whence they are induced to think the belief of such things necessary to the wellbeing of humane Kind This false notion hath prevailed for many ages in the World and done an infinite deal of mischief being in truth the cause of religious Establishments and gaining the protection and encouragement of Laws and Magistrates to the Clergy and their Superstitions Even some of the wisest among the Ancients who agreed with our Sect in denying a Providence and the Immortality of the Soul had nevertheless the weakness to lie under the common prejudice that Vice was hurtful to Societies of Men But  England  hath of late produced great Philosophers who have undeceived the world and proved to a demonstration that private Vices are public Benefits This Discovery was reserved to our times and our Sect hath the glory of it  CRI  It is possible some Men of fine Understanding might in former ages have had a glimpse of this important Truth but it may be presumed they lived in ignorant times and bigotted countries which were not ripe for such a discovery  LYS  Men of narrow capacities and short sight being able  to see no further than one link in a chain of Consequences are shocked at small evils which attend upon Vice But those who can enlarge their view and look through a long series of events may behold Happiness resulting from Vice and Good springing out of Evil in a thousand instances To prove my point I shall not trouble you with Authorities or farfetched Arguments but bring you to plain Matter of Fact Do but take a view of each particular Vice and trace it through its Effects and Consequences and then you will clearly perceive the advantage it brings to the Public  II  Drunkenness for instance is by your sober Moralists thought a pernicious Vice but it is for want of considering the good effects that flow from it For in the first place it increases the MaltTax a principal branch of his Majesty's Revenue and thereby promotes the safety strength and glory of the Nation Secondly it employs a great number of hands the Brewer the Malster the Ploughman the dealer in Hops the Smith the Carpenter the Brasier the Joiner with all other artificers necessary to supply those enumerated with their respective instruments and utensils All which advantages are procured from Drunkenness in the vulgar way by strong Beer This point is so clear it will admit of no dispute But while you are forced to allow thus much I foresee you are ready to object against Drunkenness occasion'd by Wine and Spirits as exporting wealth into foreign countries But you do not reflect on the number of hands which even this sets on work at home The Distillers the Vintners the Merchants the Sailors the Shipwrights with all those who are employ'd towards victualling and fitting out Ships which upon a nice computation will be found to include an incredible variety of Trades and Callings Then for freighting our Ships to answer these foreign importations all our manufactures  throughout the Kingdom are employ'd the Spinners the Weavers the Dyers the Woolcombers the the Carriers the Packers And the same may be said of many other manufactures as well as the woollen And if it be further considered how many Men are enriched by all the forementioned ways of trade and business and the expences of these Men and their families in all the several articles of convenient and fashionable living whereby all sorts of trades and callings not only at home but throughout all parts wherever our commerce reaches are kept in employment you will be amazed at the wonderfully extended scene of benefits which arise from the single vice of Drunkenness so much run down and declaimed against by all grave Reformers With as much judgment your halfwitted folk are accustomed to censure Gaming And indeed such is the ignorance and folly of Mankind a Gamester and a Drunkard are thought no better than public nusances when in truth they do each in their way greatly conduce to the public benefit If you look only on the furface and first appearance of things you will no doubt think playing at Cards a very idle and fruitless occupation But dive deeper and you shall perceive this idle amusement employs the Cardmaker and he sets the Papermills at work by which the poor Ragman is supported not to mention the Builders and Workers in wood and iron that are employ'd in erecting and furnishing those Mills Look still deeper and you shall find that Candles and Chairhire employ the industrious and the poor who by these means come to be relieved by Sharpers and Gentlemen who wou'd not give one penny in charity But you will say that many Gentlemen and Ladies are ruined by play without considering that what one Man loses another gets and that consequently as many are made as ruined money changeth hands and in this circulation the life of business and commerce consists When money is spent it is all one to the Public who  spends it Suppose a fool of quality becomes the dupe of a Man of mean birth and circumstance who has more wit In this case what harm doth the Public sustain Poverty is relieved Ingenuity is rewarded the Money stays at home and has a lively circulation the ingenious Sharper being enabled to set up an equipage and spend handsomely which cannot be done without employing a world of people But you will perhaps object that a Man reduced by play may be put upon desperate courses hurtful to the Public Suppose the worst and that he turns Highwayman such Men have a short life and a merry While he lives he spends and for one that he robs makes twenty the better for his expence And when his time is come a poor Family may be relieved by fifty or a hundred Pounds set upon his Head A vulgar eye looks on many a Man as an idle or mischievous fellow whom a true Philosopher viewing in another light considers as a Man of pleasant occupation who diverts himself and benefits the Public And that with so much ease that he employs a multitude of Men and sets an infinite Machine in motion without knowing the good he does or even intending to do any which is peculiar to that Gentlemanlike way of doing good by Vice I was considering Play and that insensibly led me to the advantages which attend robbing on the highway Oh the beautiful and never enough admired connection of Vices It wou'd take too much time to shew how they all hang together and what an infinite deal of good takes its rise from every one of them One word for a favourite Vice and I shall leave you to make out the rest your self by applying the same way of reasoning to all other vices A poor Girl who might not have the spending of half a Crown a week in what you call an honest way no sooner hath the good fortune to be a kept Mistress but she employs Milliners Laundresses Tirewomen Mercers and a number of other trades to the benefit of her Country It wou'd be endless  to trace and pursue every particular Vice through its consequences and effects and shew the vast advantage they all are of to the Public The true Springs that actuate the great Machine of Commerce and make a flourishing State have been hitherto little understood Your Moralists and Divines have for so many ages been corrupting the genuine Sense of mankind and filling their heads with such absurd principles that it is in the power of few Men to contemplate real life with an unprejudiced Eye And fewer still have sufficient Parts and Sagacity to pursue a long train of consequences relations and dependences which must be done in order to form a just and entire notion of the public weal But as I said before our Sect hath produced Men capable of these discoveries who have displayed them in a full light and made them public for the benefit of their Country  III  Oh Said  Euphranor  who heard this discourse with great attention you  Lysicles  are the very Man I wanted eloquent and ingenious knowing in the principles of your Sect and willing to impart them Pray tell me do these principles find an easy admission in the World  LYS  They do among ingenious Men and People of fashion though you will sometimes meet with strong prejudices against them in the middle sort an effect of ordinary Talents and mean Breeding  EUPH  I shou'd wonder if Men were not shocked at notions of such a surprising nature so contrary to all Laws Education and Religion  LYS  They wou'd be shocked much more if it had not been for the skilful address of our Philosophers who considering that most Men are influenced by names rather than things have introduced a certain polite way of speaking which lessens much of the abhorrence and prejudice towards Vice  EUPH  Explain me this  LYS  Thus in our Dialect a vicious Man is a Man of pleasure a Sharper is one that plays the whole game a Lady is said to have  an affair a Gentleman to be a gallant a Rogue in business to be one that knows the World By this means we have no such things as Sots Debauchees Whores Rogues or the like in the  beau monde  who may enjoy their vices without incurring disagreeable Appellations  EUPH  Vice then is it seems a fine thing with an ugly name  LYS  Be assured it is  EUPH  It shou'd seem then that  Plato  's fearing lest youth might be corrupted by those Fables which represented the Gods vicious was an effect of his weakness and ignorance  LYS  It was take my word for it  EUPH  And yet  Plato  had kept good Company and lived in a Court And  Cicero  who knew the World well had a profound esteem for him  CRI  I tell you  Euphranor  that  Plato  and  Tully  might perhaps make a figure in  Athens  or  Rome  But were they to revive in our days they wou'd pass but for underbred Pedants there being at most Coffeehouses in  London  several able Men who cou'd convince them they knew nothing in what they are valued so much for Morals and Politics  LYS  How many longheaded Men do I know both in the Courtend and the City with five times  Plato  's Sense who care not one straw what notions their Sons have of God or Virtue  IV  CRI  I can illustrate this Doctrine of  Lysicles  by examples that will make you perceive its force  Cleophon  a Minute Philosopher took strict care of his Son's Education and entered him betimes in the principles of his Sect  Callicles  that was his Son's name being a Youth of parts made a notable progress insomuch that before he became of age he killed his old covetous Father with vexation and ruined the Estate he left behind him or in other words made a present of it to the Public spreading the Dunghill collected by his Ancestors over the face of the Nation and making out of the overgrown Estate several pretty fortunes for ingenious Men who live by the  vices of the Great  Telesilla  though a Woman of Quality and Spirit made no figure in the World till she was instructed by her Husband in the tenets of the Minute Philosophy which he wisely thought wou'd prevent her giving any thing in Charity From that time she took a turn towards expensive Diversions particularly deep Play by which means she soon transferred a considerable share of his fortune to several acute Men skilled in that Mystery who wanted it more and circulate it quicker than her Husband wou'd have done who in return hath got an Heir to his Estate having never had a Child before That same  Telesilla  who was good for nothing as long as she believed her Catechism now shines in all public places is a Lady of gallantry and fashion and has by her extravagant parade in Lace and fine Clothes raised a Spirit of expence in other Ladies very much to the public benefit though it must be owned to the mortification of many frugal Husbands While  Crito  related these facts with a grave face I cou'd not forbear smiling which  Lysicles  observing superficial minds said he may perhaps find something to ridicule in these accounts but all who are Masters of a just way of thinking must needs see that those maxims the benefit whereof is universal and the damage only particular to private Persons or Families ought to be encouraged in a wise Commonwealth For my part said  Euphranor  I confess my self to be rather dazzled and confounded than convinced by your reasoning which as you observed you self taking in the connection of many distant points requires great extent of thought to comprehend it I must therefore intreat you to bear with my defects suffer me to take to pieces what is too big to be received at once and where I cannot keep pace with you permit me to follow you step by step as fast as I can  LYS  There is reason in what you say Every one cannot suddenly take a long concatenation of Arguments  V  EUPH  Your several Arguments seem to center in this that vice circulates money and promotes industry which causeth a People to flourish Is it not so  LYS  It is  EUPH  And the reason that vice produceth this effect is because it causeth an extravagant consumption which is the most beneficial to the Manufactures their encouragement consisting in a quick demand and high price  LYS  True  EUPH  Hence you think a Drunkard most beneficial to the Brewer and the Vintner as causing a quick consumption of Liquor inasmuch as he drinks more than other Men  LYS  Without doubt  EUPH  Says  Lysicles  who drinks most a sick Man or a healthy  LYS  A healthy  EUPH  And which is healthiest a sober Man or a Drunkard  LYS  A Sober Man  EUPH  A Sober Man therefore in health may drink more than a Drunkard when he is sick  LYS  He may  EUPH  What think you will a Man consume more Meat and Drink in a long life or a short one  LYS  In a long  EUPH  A Sober healthy Man therefore in a long life may circulate more Money by eating and drinking than a Glutton or Drunkard in a short one  LYS  What then  EUPH  Why then it shou'd seem that he may be more beneficial to the Public even in this way of eating and drinking  LYS  I shall never own that temperance is the way to promote drinking  EUPH  But you will own that sickness lessens and death puts an end to all drinking The same Argument will hold for ought I can see with respect to all other vices that impair Mens health and shorten their lives And if we admit this it will not be so clear a point that vice hath merit towards the public  LYS  But admitting that some Artificers or Traders might be as well encouraged by the sober Men as the vicious what shall we say of those who subsist altogether by Vice and Vanity  EUPH  It such there are may they not be otherwise employ'd without  loss to the Public Tell me  Lysicles  is there any thing in the nature of Vice as such that renders it a public blessing or is it only the consumption it occasions  LYS  I have already shewn how it benefits the nation by the consumption of its Manufactures  EUPH  And you have granted that a long and healthy life consumes more than a short and sickly one and you will not deny that many consume more than one Upon the whole then compute and say which is most likely to promote the industry of his Countrymen a virtuous married Man with a healthy numerous Offspring and who feeds and cloaths the Orphans in his Neighbourhood or a fashionable Rake about Town I wou'd fain know whether Money spent innocently doth not circulate as well as that spent upon Vice And if so whether by your own rule it doth not benefit the Publick as much  LYS  What I have proved I proved plainly and there is no need of more words about it  EUPH  You seem to me to have proved nothing unless you can make it out that it is impossible to spend a fortune innocently I shou'd think the publick weal of a Nation consists in the number and good condition of its Inhabitants have you any thing to object to this  LYS  I think not  EUPH  To this end which would most conduce the employing Men in open air and manly exercise or in sedentary business within doors  LYS  The former I suppose  EUPH  Shou'd it not seem therefore that building gardening and agriculture would employ Men more usefully to the Public than if Tailors Barbers Perfumers Distillers and such arts were multiplied  LYS  All this I grant but it makes against you For what moves Men to build and plant but vanity and what is vanity but vice  EUPH  But if a Man shou'd do those things for his convenience or pleasure and in proportion to his fortune without a foolish ostentation or overrating them beyond their due value they would not then be the effect of vice and how do you know but this may be the case  CRI  One thing  I know that the readiest way to quicken that sort of industry and employ Carpenters Masons Smiths and all such trades wou'd be to put in practice the happy hint of a celebrated Minute Philosopher who by profound thinking has discovered that burning the City of  London  wou'd be no such bad action as silly prejudiced People might possibly imagine inasmuch as it wou'd produce a quick circulation of property transferring it from the rich to the poor and employing a great number of Artificers of all kinds This at least cannot be denied that it hath opened a new way of thinking to our Incendiaries of which the Public hath of late begun to reap the benefit  EUPH  I cannot sufficiently admire this ingenious thought  VI  But methinks it wou'd be dangerous to make it public  CRI  Dangerous to whom  EUPH  In the first place to the publisher  CRI  That is a mistake for the notion hath been published and met with due applause in this most wise and happy age of Freethinking Freespeaking Freewriting and Freeacting  EUPH  How may a Man then publish and practise such things with impunity  CRI  To speak the truth I am not so clear as to the practic part An unlucky accident now and then befals an ingenious Man The Minute Philosopher  Magirus  being desirous to benefit the Public by circulating an Estate possessed by a near Relation who had not the heart to spend it soon convinced himself upon these principles that it wou'd be a very worthy action to dispatch out of the way such a useless fellow to whom he was next heir But for this laudable attempt he had the misfortune to be hanged by an underbred Judge and Jury Could any thing be more unjust  EUPH  Why unjust  CRI  Is it not unjust to punish actions when the principles from which they directly follow are tolerated and applauded by the Public Can any thing be more inconsistent  than to condemn in practice what is approved in speculation Truth is one and the same it being impossible a thing should be practically wrong and speculatively right Thus much is certain  Magirus  was perfect Master of all this Theory and argued most acutely about it with a Friend of mine a little before he did the fact for which he died  LYS  The best on't is the World every day grows wiser  CRI  You mistake  Euphranor  if you think the Minute Philosophers idle Theorists They are Men of practical views  EUPH  As much as I love Liberty I shou'd be afraid to live among such People it would be as  Seneca  somewhere expresseth it  in libertate bellis ac tyrannis saeviore LYS  What do you mean by quoting  Plato  and  Seneca  Can you imagine a Freethinker is to be influenced by the Authority of such old fashioned Writers  EUPH  You  Lysicles  and your Friend have often quoted to me ingenious Moderns profound fine Gentlemen with new names of Authors in the Minute Philosophy to whose merits I am a perfect stranger Suffer me in my turn to cite such Authorities as I know and have passed for many ages upon the World  VII  But Authority apart what do you say to Experience My Observation can reach as far as a private Family and some wise Men have thought a Family may be considered as a small Kingdom or a Kingdom as a great Family Do you admit this to be true  LYS  If I say  yes  you'll make an inference and if I say  no  you'll demand a reason The best way is to say nothing at all There is I see no end of answering  EUPH  If you give up the point you undertook to prove there is an end at once But if you hope to convince me you must answer my questions and allow me the liberty to argue and infer  LYS  Well suppose I admit that a Kingdom may be considered as a great Family  EUPH  I shall ask you then whether ever you knew private Families  thrive by those vices you think so beneficial to the Public  LYS  Suppose I have not  EUPH  Might not a Man therefore by a parity of reason suspect their being of that benefit to the Public  LYS  Fear not the next age will thrive and flourish  EUPH  Pray tell me  Lysicles  suppose you saw a fruit of a new untried kind would you recommend it to your own Family to make a full meal of  LYS  I would not  EUPH  Why then would you try upon your own Country these maxims which were never admitted in any other  LYS  The experiment must begin somewhere and we are resolved our own Country shall have the honour and advantage of it  EUPH  O  Lysicles  hath not old  England  subsisted for many ages without the help of your notions  LYS  She has  EUPH  And made some figure  LYS  I grant it  EUPH  Why then shou'd you make her run the risque of a new experiment when it is certain she may do without it  LYS  But we would make her do better We wou'd produce a change in her that never was seen in any Nation  EUPH Sallust  observes that a little before the downfal of the  Roman  Empire avarice the effect of Luxury had erased the good old principles of probity and justice had produced a contempt for Religion and made every thing venal while ambition bred dissimulation and caused Men to unite in clubs and parties not from honourable motives but narrow and interested views The same Historian observes of that great Freethinker  Catiline  that he made it his business to insinuate himself into the acquaintance of young Men whose minds unimproved by years and experience were more easily seduced I know not how it happens but these passages have occurred to my Thoughts more than once during this Conversation  LYS Sallust  was a sententious Pedant  EUPH  But consult any Historian look into any Writer See for instance what  Xenophon  and  Livy  say of  Sparta  and  Rome  and then tell me if  Vice be not the likeliest way to ruin and enslave a People  LYS  When a point is clear by its own evidence I never think it worth while to consult old Authors about it  CRI  It requires much thought and delicate observation to go to the bottom of things But one who hath come at Truth with difficulty can impart it with ease I will therefore  Euphranor  explain to you in three words what none of your old Writers ever dreamt of the true cause of ruin to those States You must know that Vice and Virtue being opposite and contradictory Principles both working at once in a state will produce contrary effects which intestine discord must needs tend to the dissolution and ruin of the whole But it is the design of our Minute Philosophers by making Men wicked upon principle a thing unknown to the Ancients so to weaken and destroy the force of virtue that its effects shall not be felt in the Public In which case Vice being uncontrolled without let or impediment of principle pure and genuine without allay of virtue the Nation must doubtless be very flourishing and triumphant  EUPH  Truly a noble Scheme  CRI  And in a fair way to take effect For our young proficients in the Minute Philosophy having by a rare felicity of Education no tincture of bigotry or prejudice do far outgo the old standers and professors of the Sect who though Men of admirable parts yet having had the misfortune to be imbued in their Childhood with some religious Notions cou'd never after get intirely rid of them but still retain some small grains of conscience and superstition which are a check upon the noblest Genius In proof of this I remember that the famous Minute Philosopher old  Demodicus  came one day from conversation upon business with  Timander  a young Gentleman of the same Sect full of astonishment I am surprised said he to see so young and withal so compleat a Villain and such was the force of prejudice spoke of  Timander  with abhorrence not considering  that he was only the more egregious and profound Philosopher of the two  VIII  EUPH  Though much may be hoped from the unprejudiced education of young Gentlemen yet it seems we are not to expect a settled and intire Happiness before Vice reigns pure and unmixed till then much is to be feared from the dangerous struggle between Vice and Virtue which may perchance overturn and dissolve this Government as it hath done others  LYS  No matter for that if a better comes in its place We have cleared the land of all Prejudices towards Government or Constitution and made them fly like other Phantasms before the light of Reason and good Sense Men who think deeply cannot see any reason why Power shou'd not change hands as well as Property or why the fashion of a Government shou'd not be changed as easy as that of a Garment The perpetual circulating and revolving of Wealth and Power no matter through what or whose hands is that which keeps up Life and Spirit in a State Those who are even slightly read in our Philosophy know that of all Prejudices the silliest is an attachment to forms  CRI  To say no more upon so clear a point the overturning a Government may be justified upon the same Principles as the burning a Town wou'd produce parallel effects and equally contribute to the public good In both cases the natural springs of Action are forcibly exerted and in this general Industry what one loses another gets a quick circulation of Wealth and Power making the Sum Total to flourish  EUPH  And do the Minute Philosophers publish these things to the World  LYS  It must be confessed our Writers proceed in Politics with greater caution than they think necessary with regard to Religion  CRI  But those things plainly follow from their Principles and are to be admitted for the genuine Doctrine of the Sect expressed perhaps with more freedom and perspicuity  than might be thought prudent by those who wou'd manage the Public or not offend weak brethren  EUPH  And pray is there not need of caution a Rebel or Incendiary being Characters that many Men have a prejudice against  LYS  Weak People of all ranks have a world of absurd Prejudices  EUPH  But the better sort such as Statesmen and Legislators do you think they have not the same Indisposition towards admitting your Principles  LYS  Perhaps they may but the reason is plain  CRI  This puts me in mind of that ingenious Philosopher the Gamester  Glaucus  who used to say that Statesmen and Lawgivers may keep a stir about right and wrong just and unjust but that in truth Property of every kind had so often passed from the right owners by fraud and violence that it was now to be considered as lying on the common and with equal right belonged to every one that cou'd seize it  EUPH  What are we to think then of Laws and Regulations relating to Right and Wrong Crimes and Duties  LYS  They serve to bind weak minds and keep the Vulgar in awe But no sooner doth a true Genius arise but he breaks his way to Greatness through all the trammels of Duty Conscience Religion Law to all which he sheweth himself infinitely superior  IX  EUPH  You are it seems for bringing about a thorough Reformation  LYS  As to what is commonly called the Reformation I cou'd never see how or wherein the World was the better for it It is much the same as Popery with this difference that it is the more prudelike and disagreeable thing of the two A noted Writer of ours makes it too great a compliment when he computes the benefit of Hoopedpetticoats to be nearly equal to that of the Reformation Thorough Reformation is thorough Liberty Leave Nature at full freedom to work her own way and all will be well This is  what we aim at and nothing short of this can come up to our Principles  Crito  who is a zealous Protestant hearing these words cou'd not refrain The worst effect of the Reformation said he was the rescuing wicked Men from a darkness which kept them in awe This as it hath proved was holding out Light to Robbers and Murderers Light in it self is good and the same Light which shews a Man the folly of Superstition might shew him the truth of Religion and the madness of Atheism But to make use of Light only to see the Evils on one side and never to see but to run blindly upon the worse extreme this is to make the best of things produce Evil in the same sense that you prove the worst of things to produce Good to wit accidentally or indirectly and by the same method of arguing you may prove that even Diseases are useful but whatever benefit seems to accrue to the Public either from disease of Mind or Body is not their genuine offspring and may be obtained without them  Lysicles  was a little disconcerted by the affirmative air of  Crito  but after a short pause replied briskly That to contemplate the public good was not every one's talent True said  Euphranor  I question whether every one can frame a notion of the public good much less judge of the means to promote it  X  But you  Lysicles  who are master of this subject will be pleased to inform me whether the public good of a Nation doth not imply the particular good of its Individuals  LYS  It doth  EUPH  And doth not the good or happiness of a Man consist in having both Soul and Body sound and in good condition enjoying those things which their respective Natures require and free from those things which are odious or hurtful to them  LYS  I do not deny all this to be true  EUPH  Now it shou'd seem worth while to consider whether the regular decent life of a virtuous Man may not  as much conduce to this end as the mad sallies of Intemperance and Debauchery  LYS  I will acknowledge that a Nation may meerly subsist or be kept alive but it is impossible it shou'd flourish without the aid of Vice To produce a quick circulation of traffick and wealth in a State there must be exorbitant and irregular motions in the Appetites and Passions  EUPH  The more people a Nation contains and the happier those people are the more that Nation may be said to flourish I think we are agreed in this point  LYS  We are  EUPH  You allow then that Riches are not an ultimate end but shou'd only be considered as the means to procure Happiness  LYS  I do  EUPH  It seems that means cannot be of use without our knowing the end and how to apply them to it  LYS  It seems so  EUPH  Will it not follow that in order to make a Nation flourish it is not sufficient to make it wealthy without knowing the true end and happiness of Mankind and how to apply wealth towards attaining that end In proportion as these points are known and practised I think the Nation shou'd be likely to flourish But for a people who neither know nor practise them to gain riches seems to me the same advantage that it wou'd be for a sick Man to come at plenty of meat and drink which he cou'd not use but to his hurt  LYS  This is meer sophistry it is arguing without persuading Look into common Life examine the pursuits of Men have a due respect for the consent of the World and you will soon be convinced that Riches alone are sufficient to make a Nation flourishing and happy Give them Riches and they will make themselves happy without that political Invention that Trick of Stasemen and Philosophers called Virtue  XI  EUPH  Virtue then in your account is a Trick of Statesmen  LYS  It is  EUPH  Why then do your sagacious Sect betray and divulge that Trick or Secret of State which wise Men have judged necessary for the good Government of the World  Lysicles  hesitating  Crito  made answer That he presumed it was because their Sect being wiser than all other wise Men disdained to see the World governed by wrong Maxims and wou'd set all things on a right bottom  EUPH  Thus much is certain If we look into all institutions of Government and the political Writings of such as have heretofore passed for wise Men we shall find a great regard for Virtue  LYS  You shall find a strong tincture of Prejudice But as I said before consult the Multitude if you wou'd find Nature and Truth  EUPH  But among Country Gentlemen and Farmers and the better sort of Tradesmen is not Virtue a reputable thing  LYS  You pick up Authorities among Men of low life and vile education  EUPH  Perhaps we ought to pay a decent respect to the Authority of Minute Philosophers  LYS  And I wou'd fain know whose Authority shou'd be more considered than that of those Gentlemen who are alone above Prejudice and think for themselves  EUPH  How doth it appear that you are the only unprejudiced part of Mankind May not a Minute Philosopher as well as another Man be prejudiced in favour of the leaders of his Sect May not an atheistical Education prejudice towards Atheism What shou'd hinder a Man's being prejudiced against Religion as well as for it Or can you assign any reason why an attachment to Pleasure Interest Vice or Vanity may not be supposed to prejudice Men against Virtue  LYS  This is pleasant What Suppose those very Men influenced by Prejudice who are always disputing against it whose constant aim it is to detect and demolish Prejudices of all kinds Except their own replied  Crito  for you must pardon me if I cannot  help thinking they have some small Prejudice though not in favour of Virtue  XII  I observe  Lysicles  that you allowed to  Euphranor  the greater number of happy People are in a State the more that State may be said to flourish it follows therefore That such methods as multiply Inhabitants are good and such as diminish them are bad for the Public And one wou'd think no body need be told that the strength of a State consists more in the number and sort of People than in any thing else But in proportion as Vice and Luxury those public blessings encouraged by this Minute Philosophy prevail among us fewer are disposed to marry too many being diverted by Pleasure disabled by Disease or frightned by Expence Nor doth Vice only thin a Nation but also debaseth it by a puny degenerate Race I might add that it is ruinous to our Manufactures both as it makes labour dear and thereby enables our more frugal Neighbours to undersel us and also as it diverts the lower sort of People from honest Callings to wicked Projects If these and such considerations were taken into the account I believe it wou'd be evident to any Man in his senses that the imaginary benefits of Vice bear no proportion to the solid real woes that attend it  Lysicles  upon this shook his head and smiled at  Crito  without vouchsafing any other answer After which addressing himself to  Euphranor  There cannot said he be a stronger instance of Prejudice than that a Man shou'd at this time of day preserve a reverence for that idol Virtue a thing so effectually exposed and exploded by the most knowing Men of the age who have shewn that a Man is a meer engine play'd upon and driven about by sensible objects and that moral Virtue is only a Name a Notion a Chimaera an Enthusiasm or at best a Fashion uncertain and changeable like all other Fashions  EUPH  What do you think  Lysicles  of Health doth it depend on Fancy and Caprice or is it something real in the bodily composition of a Man  LYS  Health is something real which results from the right Constitution and Temperature of the Organs and the Fluids circulating through them  EUPH  This you say is health of Body  LYS  It is  EUPH  And may we not suppose an healthy constitution of Soul when the Notions are right the Judgments true the Will regular the Passions and Appetites directed to their proper objects and confined within due bounds This in regard to the Soul seems what Health is to the Body And the Man whose mind is so constituted is he not properly called virtuous And to produce this healthy disposition in the minds of his Countrymen shou'd not every good Man employ his endeavours If these things have any appearance of Truth as to me they seem to have it will not then be so clear a point that Virtue is a meer whim or fashion as you are pleased to represent it I must own something unexpectedly after what had been discoursed in last Evening's Conference which if you wou'd call to mind it might perhaps save both of us some trouble  LYS  Wou'd you know the truth  Euphranor  I must own I have quite forgot all your discourse about Virtue Duty and all such Points which being of an airy notional nature are apt to vanish and leave no trace on a mind accustomed only to receive Impression from Realities  XIII  Having heard these words  Euphranor  looked at  Crito  and me and said smiling I have mistaken my part it was mine to learn and his to instruct Then addressing himself to  Lysicles  Deal faithfully said he and let me know whether the public Benefit of Vice be in truth that which makes you plead for it  LYS  I love to speak frankly what I think Know then that private Interest is the first and principal consideration with Philosophers of our Sect  Now of all Interests Pleasure is that which hath the strongest charms and no Pleasures like those which are heightened and enlivened by licence Herein consists the peculiar excellency of our Principles that they shew People how to serve their Country by diverting themselves causing the two streams of public Spirit and Selflove to unite and run in the same channel I have told you already that I admit a Nation might subsist by the rules of Virtue But give me leave to say it will barely subsist in a dull joyless insipid state whereas the sprightly excesses of Vice inspire Men with joy And where Particulars rejoice the Public which is made up of Particulars must do so too that is the Public must be happy This I take to be an irrefragable argument But to give you its full force and make it as plain as possible I will trace things from their original Happiness is the end to which created beings naturally tend but we find that all Animals whether Men or Brutes do naturally and principally pursue real Pleasure of Sense which is therefore to be thought their supreme Good their true End and Happiness It is for this Men live and whoever understands Life must allow that Man to enjoy the top and flower of it who hath a quick sense of Pleasure and withal Spirit Skill and Fortune sufficient to gratify every appetite and every taste Niggards and Fools will envy or traduce such a one because they cannot equal him Hence all that sober trifling in disparagement of what every one wou'd be master of if he cou'd a full freedom and unlimited scope of Pleasure  EUPH  Let me see whether I understand you Pleasure of Sense you say is the chief Pleasure  LYS  I do  EUPH  And this wou'd be crampt and diminished by Virtue  LYS  It wou'd  EUPH  Tell me  Lysicles  is Pleasure then at the height when the Appetites are satisfied  LYS  There is then only an Indolence the lively sense of  Pleasure being past  EUPH  It shou'd seem therefore that the appetites must be always craving to preserve Pleasure alive  LYS  That is our sense of the matter  EUPH  The  Greek  Philosopher therefore was in the right who considered the body of a Man of pleasure as a leaky Vessel always filling and never full  LYS  You may divert your self with Allegories if you please But all the while ours is literally the true taste of Nature Look throughout the Universe and you shall find Birds and Fishes Beasts and Insects all kinds of Animals with which the Creation swarms constantly engaged by instinct in the pursuit of sensible Pleasure And shall Man alone be the grave fool who thwarts and crosses and subdues his appetites while his fellowcreatures do all most joyfully and freely indulge them  EUPH  How  Lysicles  I thought that being governed by the Senses Appetites and Passions was the most grievous Slavery and that the proper business of Freethinkers or Philosophers had been to set Men free from the power of Ambition Avarice and Sensuality  LYS  You mistake the point We make Men relish the World attentive to their Interests lively and luxurious in their Pleasures without fear or restraint either from God or Man We despise those preaching Writers who used to disturb or cramp the pleasures and amusements of Human Life We hold that a wise Man who meddles with business doth it altogether for his interest and refers his interest to his pleasure With us it is a maxim that a Man shou'd seize the moments as they fly Without Love and Wine and Play and late hours we hold Life not to be worth living I grant indeed that there is something gross and illbred in the vices of mean Men which the genteel Philosopher abhors  CRI  But to cheat whore betray get drunk do all these things decently this is true wisdom and elegance of taste  XIV  EUPH  To me who have been us'd to another way of thinking this new Philosophy seems difficult to digest I must therefore beg leave to examine its Principles with the same freedom that you do those of other Sects  LYS  Agreed  EUPH  You say if I mistake not that a wise Man pursues only his private interest and that this consists in sensual pleasure for proof whereof you appeal to Nature Is not this what you advance  LYS  It is  EUPH  You conclude therefore that as other Animals are guided by natural instinct Man too ought to follow the dictates of sense and appetite  LYS  I do  EUPH  But in this do you not argue as if Man had only sense and appetite for his guides on which supposition there might be truth in what you say But what if he hath intellect reason a higher instinct and a nobler life If this be the case and you being Man live like a Brute is it not the way to be defrauded of your true happiness to be mortified and disappointed Consider most sorts of Brutes you shall perhaps find them have a greater share of sensual happiness than Man  LYS  To our sorrow we do This hath made several Gentlemen of our Sect envy Brutes and lament the lot of Humane Kind  CRI  It was a consideration of this sort which inspired  Erotylus  with the laudable ambition of wishing himself a snail upon hearing of certain particularities discovered in that animal by a modern Virtuoso  EUPH  Tell me  Lysicles  if you had an inexhaustible fund of gold and silver shou'd you envy another for having a little more copper than you  LYS  I shou'd not  EUPH  Are not Reason Imagination and Sense Faculties differing in kind and in rank higher one than another  LYS  I do not deny it  EUPH  Their acts therefore differ in kind  LYS  They do  EUPH  Consequently the pleasures perfective of those acts are also different  LYS  They are  EUPH  You admit therefore three sorts of pleasure pleasure of Reason  pleasure of imagination and pleasure of Sense  LYS  I do  EUPH  And as it is reasonable to think the operation of the highest and noblest faculty to be attended with the highest pleasure may we not suppose the two former to be as gold or silver and the latter only as copper Whence it shou'd seem to follow that Man need not envy or imitate a Brute  LYS  And nevertheless there are very ingenious Men who do And surely every one may be allowed to know what he wants and wherein his true happiness consists  EUPH  Is it not plain that different Animals have different pleasures Take a Hog from his ditch or dunghil lay him on a rich bed treat him with sweetmeats and music and perfumes All these things will be no entertainment to him Do not a Bird a Beast a Fish amuse themselves in various manners insomuch that what is pleasing to one may be death to another Is it ever seen that one of these Animals quits its own element or way of living to adopt that of another And shall Man quit his own Nature to imitate a Brute  LYS  But Sense is not only natural to Brutes is it not also natural to Man  EUPH  It is but with this difference it maketh the Whole of a Brute but is the lowest part or faculty of a Humane Soul The nature of any thing is peculiarly that which doth distinguish it from other things not what it hath in common with them Do you allow this to be true  LYS  I do  EUPH  And is not Reason that which makes the principal difference between Man and other Animals  LYS  It is  EUPH  Reason therefore being the principal part of our Nature whatever is most reasonable shou'd seem most natural to Man Must we not therefore think rational Pleasures more agreeable to Human Kind than those of Sense Man and Beast having different Natures seem to have different Faculties different Enjoyments and different sorts of Happiness You can easily conceive that the sort of Life which makes the happiness of a Mole or a  Bat wou'd be a very wretched one for an Eagle And may you not as well conceive that the happiness of a Brute can never constitute the true happiness of a Man A Beast without Reflection or Remorse without Foresight or Appetite of Immortality without notion of Vice or Virtue or Order or Reason or Knowledge What motive what grounds can there be for bringing down Man in whom are all these things to a level with such a creature What merit what ambition in the Minute Philosopher to make such an Animal a guide or rule for Humane Life  XV  LYS  It is strange  Euphranor  that one who admits freedom of thought as you do shou'd yet be such a slave to prejudice You still talk of order and virtue as of real things as if our Philosophers had never demonstrated that they have no foundation in Nature and are only the effects of Education I know said  Crito  how the Minute Philosophers are accustomed to demonstrate this point They consider the animal nature of Man or Man so far forth as he is animal and it must be owned that considered in that light he hath no sense of Duty no notion of Virtue He therefore who shou'd look for Virtue among meer animals or Human Kind as such wou'd look in the wrong place But that Philosopher who is attentive only to the animal part of his Being and raiseth his Theorys from the very dregs of our Species might probably upon second thoughts find himself mistaken Look you  Crito  said  Lysicles  my argument is with  Euphranor  to whom addressing his discourse I observe said he that you stand much upon the dignity of Humane Nature This thing of dignity is an old wornout notion which depends on other notions old and stale and wornout such as an immaterial Spirit and a Ray derived from the Divinity But in these days Men of Sense make a jest of all this Grandeur and Dignity and many there  are wou'd gladly exchange their share of it for the repose and freedom and sensuality of a Brute But comparisons are odious waving therefore all inquiry concerning the respective excellencies of Man and Beast and whether it is beneath a Man to follow or imitate Brute Animals in judging of the chief good and conduct of Life and Manners I shall be content to appeal to the Authority of Men themselves for the truth of my notions Do but look abroad into the World and ask the common run of Men whether pleasure of Sense be not the only true solid substantial good of their kind  EUPH  But might not the same vulgar sort of Men prefer a piece of Signpost Painting to one of  Raphael  's or a  Grubstreet  Ballad to an Ode of  Horace  Is there not a real difference between good and bad Writing  LYS  There is  EUPH  And yet you will allow there must be a maturity and improvement of understanding to discern this difference which doth not make it therefore less real  LYS  I will  EUPH  In the same manner what shou'd hinder but there may be in nature a true difference between Vice and Virtue although it require some degree of reflexion and judgment to observe it In order to know whether a thing be agreeable to the rational nature of Man it seems one shou'd rather observe and consult those who have most employ'd or improved their Reason  LYS  Well I shall not insist on consulting the common herd of mankind From the ignorant and gross Vulgar I might my self appeal in many cases to Men of rank and fashion  EUPH  They are a sort of Men I have not the honour to know much of by my own Observation But I remember a remark of  Aristotle  who was himself a Courtier and knew them well  Virtue saith he  Ethic ad Nicom l c  and good Sense are not  the property of high Birth or a great Estate Nor if they who posess these advantages wanting a taste for rational pleasures betake themselves to those of Sense ought we therefore to esteem them eligible any more than we shou'd the toys and pastimes of Children because they seem so to them  And indeed one may be allowed to question whether the truest estimate of things was to be expected from a mind intoxicated with Luxury and dazzled with the splendor of high living  CÃ¹m stupet insanis acies fulgoribus cÃ¹m  Acclinis falsis animus meliora recusat  Hor  Crito  upon this observed that he knew an  English  Nobleman who in the prime of Life professeth a liberal art and is the first Man of his profession in the World and that he was very sure he had more pleasure from the exercise of that elegant art than from any sensual enjoyment within the power of one of the largest fortunes and most bountiful Spirits in  Great Britain  XVI  LYS  But why need we have recourse to the judgment of other Men in so plain a case I appeal to your own breast consult that and then say if sensible pleasure be not the chief good of Man  EUPH  I for my part have often thought those pleasures which are highest in the esteem of sensualists so far from being the chiefest good that it seemed doubtful upon the whole whether they were any good at all any more than the meer removal of pain Are not our wants and appetites uneasy  LYS  They are  EUPH  Doth not sensual pleasure consist in satisfying them  LYS  It doth  EUPH  But the cravings are tedious the satisfaction momentary Is it not so  LYS  It is but what then  EUPH  Why then it shou'd seem that sensual pleasure is but a short deliverance from long pain A long avenue  of uneasiness leads to a point of pleasure which ends in disgust or remorse  CRI  And he who pursues this  ignis fatuus  imagines himself a Philosopher and Freethinker  LYS  Pedants are governed by words and notions while the wiser Men of pleasure follow Fact Nature and Sense  CRI  But what if notional pleasures should in fact prove the most real and lasting Pure pleasures of Reason and Imagination neither hurt the health nor waste the fortune nor gall the conscience By them the mind is long entertained without loathing or satiety On the other hand a notion which with you it seems passeth for nothing often embitters the most lively sensual pleasures which at bottom will be found also to depend upon notion more than perhaps you imagine it being a vulgar remark that those things are more enjoyed by hope and foretaste of the Soul than by possession Thus much is yielded that the actual enjoyment is very short and the alternative of Appetite and Disgust long as well as uneasy So that upon the whole it should seem those Gentlemen who are called Men of pleasure from their eager pursuit of it do in reality with great expence of fortune ease and health purchase pain  LYS  You may spin out plausible Arguments but will after all find it a difficult matter to convince me that so many ingenious Men shou'd not be able to distinguish between things so directly opposite as pain and pleasure How is it possible to account for this  CRI  I believe a reason may be assigned for it but to Men of pleasure no truth is so palatable as a fable  Jove  once upon a time having ordered that pleasure and pain shou'd be mixed in equal proportions in every dose of Humane Life upon a complaint that some Men endeavoured to separate what he had joined and taking more than their share of the sweet wou'd leave all the sour for others commanded  Mercury  to put a stop to this evil by fixing on each Delinquent a pair of invisible Spectacles which shou'd change the appearance of things making  pain look like pleasure and pleasure like pain labour like recreation and recreation like labour From that time the Men of Pleasure are eternally mistaking and repenting  LYS  If your Doctrine takes place I wou'd fain know what can be the advantage of a great fortune which all mankind so eagerly pursue  CRI  It is a common saying with  Eucrates  That  a great fortune is an edged tool  which a hundred may come at for one who knows how to use it so much easier is the art of getting than that of spending What its advantage is I will not say but I will venture to declare what it is not I am sure that where abundance excludes want and enjoyment prevents appetite there is not the quickest sense of those pleasures we have been speaking of in which the Footman hath often a greater share than his Lord who cannot enlarge his Stomach in proportion to his Estate  XVII  Reasonable and welleducated Men of all Ranks have I believe pretty much the same amusements notwithstanding the difference of their fortunes But those who are particularly distinguished as Men of pleasure seem to possess it in a very small degree  EUPH  I have heard that among Persons of that character a game of Cards is esteemed a chief diversion  LYS  Without Cards there cou'd be no living for People of fashion It is the most delightful way of passing an Evening when Gentlemen and Ladies are got together who wou'd otherwise be at a loss what to say or do with themselves But a pack of Cards is so engaging that it doth not only employ them when they are met but serves to draw them together  Quadrille  gives them pleasure in prospect during the dull hours of the day they reflect on it with delight and it furnishes discourse when it is over  CRI  One wou'd be apt to suspect these People of condition pass their time but heavily and are but little the better for their fortunes whose  chief amusement is a thing in the power of every Porter or Footman who is as well qualified to receive pleasure from Cards as a Peer I can easily conceive that when People of a certain turn are got together they shou'd prefer doing any thing to the  ennui  of their own conversation but it is not easily to conceive there is any great pleasure in this What a Cardtable can afford requires neither parts nor fortune to judge of  LYS  Play is a serious amusement that comes to the relief of a Man of pleasure after the more lively and affecting enjoyments of Sense It kills time beyond any thing and is a most admirable Anodyne to divert or prevent thought which might otherwise prey upon the mind  CRI  I can easily comprehend that no Man upon Earth ought to prize Anodynes for the Spleen more than a Man of fashion and pleasure An ancient Sage speaking of one of that character saith he is made wretched by disappointments and appetites  And if this was true of the  Greeks  who lived in the Sun and had so much Spirit I am apt to think it is still more so of our modern  English  Something there is in our climate and complexion that makes idleness no where so much its own punishment as in  England  where an uneducated fine Gentleman pays for his momentary pleasures with long and cruel intervals of Spleen for relief of which he is driven into sensual excesses that produce a proportionable depression of Spirits which as it createth a greater want of pleasures so it lessens the ability to enjoy them There is a cast of Thought in the Complexion of an  Englishman  which renders him the most unsuccessful Rake in the World He is as  Aristotle  expresseth it at variance with himself He is neither Brute enough to enjoy his appetites nor Man enough to govern them He knows and feels that what he pursues is not his true good his reflexion serving only to shew him that misery which his habitual sloth and indolence will not suffer him to remedy At length being  grown odious to himself and abhorring his own Company he runs into every idle Assembly not from the hopes of pleasure but meerly to respite the pain of his own mind Listless and uneasy at the present he hath no delight in reflecting on what is past or in the prospect of any thing to come This Man of pleasure when after a wretched Scene of vanity and woe his animal nature is worn to the Stumps wishes and dreads Death by turns and is sick of living without having ever tried or known the true life of Man  EUPH  It is well this sort of Life which is of so little benefit to the owner conduceth so much to that of the Public But pray tell me do these Gentlemen set up for Minute Philosophers  CRI  That Sect you must know contains two sorts of Philosophers the wet and the dry Those I have been describing are of the former kind They differ rather in Practice than in Theory As an older graver or duller Man from one that is younger and more capable or fond of pleasure The dry Philosopher passeth his time but drily He has the honour of pimping for the Vices of more sprightly Men who in return offer some small incense to his Vanity Upon this encouragement and to make his own mind easy when it is past being pleased he employs himself in justifying those excesses he cannot partake in But to return to your question those miserable Folk are mighty Men for the Minute Philosophy  EUPH  What hinders them then from putting an end to their lives  CRI  Their not being persuaded of the Truth of what they profess Some indeed in a fit of despair do now and then lay violent hands on themselves And as the Minute Philosophy prevails we daily see more examples of Suicide But they bear no proportion to those who wou'd put an end to their lives if they durst My friend  Clinias  who had been one of them and a Philosopher of rank let me into the secret History of their doubts and fears and irresolute resolutions of making away with themselves which  last he assures me is a frequent topic with Men of pleasure when they have drunk themselves into a little Spirit It was by virtue of this mechanical valour the renowned Philosopher  Hermocrates  shot himself through the head The same thing hath since been practised by several others to the great relief of their friends Splenetic worried and frightened out of their wits they run upon their doom with the same courage as a Bird runs into the mouth of a Rattle Snake not because they are bold to die but because they are afraid to live  Clinias  endeavoured to fortify his irreligion by the discourse and opinion of other Minute Philosophers who were mutually strengthened in their own unbelief by his After this manner authority working in a circle they endeavoured to atheize one another But though he pretended even to a demonstration against the Being of a God yet he cou'd not inwardly conquer his own Belief He fell sick and acknowledged this truth is now a sober Man and a good Christian owns he was never so happy as since he became such nor so wretched as while he was a Minute Philosopher And he who has tried both conditions may be allowed a proper judge of both  LYS  Truly a fine account of the brightest and bravest Men of the Age  CRI  Bright and brave are fine attributes But our Curate is of opinion that all your Freethinking Rakes are either Fools or Cowards Thus he argues if such a Man doth not see his true Interest he wants Sense if he doth but dare not pursue it he wants Courage In this manner from the defect of Sense and Courage he deduceth that whole Species of Men who are so apt to value themselves upon both those qualities  LYS  As for their Courage they are at all times ready to give proof of it and for their understanding thanks to nature it is of a size not to be measured by Country Parsons  XVIII  EUPH  But  Socrates  who was no Country Parson suspected your Men of pleasure were such through ignorance  LYS  Ignorance of what  EUPH  Of the art of computing It was his opinion that Rakes cannot reckon  Plato in protag  And that for want of this skill they make wrong judgments about pleasure on the right choice of which their happiness depends  LYS  I do not understand you  EUPH  Do you grant that Sense perceiveth only sensible things  LYS  I do  EUPH  Sense perceiveth only things present  LYS  This too I grant  EUPH  Future pleasures therefore and pleasures of the understanding are not to be judged of by actual Sense  LYS  They are not  EUPH  Those therefore who judge of pleasure by Sense may find themselves mistaken at the foot of the account  Persius Sat  CÃ¹m lapidosa chiragra  Contudit articulos veteris ramalia fagi  Tum crassos transÃ®sse dies lucemque palustrem  Et sibi jam seri vitam ingemuere relictam  To make a right computation shou'd you not consider all the faculties and all the kinds of Pleasure taking into your account the future as well as the present and rating them all according to their true value  CRI  The  Epicureans  themselves allowed that Pleasure which procures a greater Pain or hinders a greater Pleasure shou'd be regarded as a Pain and that Pain which procures a greater Pleasure or prevents a greater Pain is to be accounted a Pleasure In order therefore to make a true estimate of Pleasure the great spring of action and that from whence the conduct of Life takes its bias we ought to compute intellectual Pleasures and future Pleasures  as well as present and sensible We ought to make allowance in the valuation of each particular Pleasure for all the Pains and Evils for all the Disgust Remorse and Shame that attend it We ought to regard both kind and quantity the sincerity the intenseness and the duration of Pleasures  EUPH  And all these points duly considered will not  Socrates  seem to have had reason of his side when he thought ignorance made Rakes and particularly their being ignorant of what he calls the Science of more and less greater and smaller equality and comparison that is to say of the art of Computing  LYS  All this discourse seems notional For real abilities of every kind it is well known we have the brightest Men of the age among us But all those who know the World do calculate that what you call a good Christian who hath neither a large Conscience nor unprejudiced Mind must be unfit for the affairs of it Thus you see while you compute your selves out of pleasure others compute you out of business What then are you good for with all your computation  EUPH  I have all imaginable respect for the abilities of Freethinkers My only fear was their parts might be too lively for such slow talents as Forecast and Computation the gifts of ordinary Men  XIX  CRI  I cannot make them the same compliment that  Euphranor  does For though I shall not pretend to characterize the whole Sect yet thus much I may truly affirm That those who have fallen in my way have been mostly raw Men of pleasure old Sharpers in business or a third sort of lazy Sciolists who are neither Men of business nor Men of speculation but set up for judges or critics in all kinds without having made a progress in any These among Men of the World pass for profound Theorists and among speculative Men wou'd seem to know the World a conceited race equally useless to the affairs and studies of Mankind Such as these for the most  part seem to be Sectaries of the Minute Philosophy I will not deny that now and then you may meet with a Man of easy manners that without those faults and affectations is carried into the party by the meer stream of Education Fashion or Company all which do in this age prejudice Men against Religion even those who mechanically rail at Prejudice I must not forget that the Minute Philosophers have also a strong party among the Beaux and fine Ladies and as affectations out of character are often the strongest there is nothing so dogmatical and inconvincible as one of these fine things when it sets up for Freethinking But be these professors of the Sect never so dogmatical their authority must needs be small with Men of sense For who wou'd choose for his guide in the search for Truth a Man whose Thoughts and Time are taken up with Dress Visits and Diversions Or whose Education hath been behind a Counter or in an Office Or whose Speculations have been employed on the forms of business who are only well read in the ways and commerce of Mankind in stockjobbing purloining supplanting bribing Or wou'd any Man in his senses give a fig for Meditations and Discoveries made over a bottle And yet it is certain that instead of Thought Books and Study most Freethinkers are the Proselytes of a drinking Club Their Principles are often settled and decisions on the deepest Points made when they are not fit to make a bargain  LYS  You forget our Writers  Crito  They make a world of Proselytes  CRI  So wou'd worse Writers in such a cause Alas how few read and of these how few are able to judge How many wish your notions true How many had rather be diverted than instructed How many are convinced by a title I may allow your reasons to be effectual without allowing them to be good Arguments in themselves of small weight have great effect when  they are recommended by a mistaken interest when they are pleaded for by passion when they are countenanced by the humour of the age and above all with some sort of Men when they are against Law Government and established Opinions things which as a wise or good Man wou'd not depart from without clear evidence a weak or a bad Man will affect to disparage on the slightest Grounds  LYS  And yet the arguments of our Philosophers alarm  CRI  The force of their reasoning is not what alarms their contempt of Laws and Government is alarming their application to the young and ignorant is dangerous  EUPH  But without disputing or disparaging their talent at Ratiocination it seems very possible their success might not be owing to that alone May it not in some measure be ascribed to the defects of others as well as to their own perfections My friend  Eucrates  used to say that the Church wou'd thrive and flourish beyond all opposition if some certain persons minded Piety more than Politics Practics than Polemics Fundamentals than Consectaries Substance than Circumstance Things than Notions and Notions than Words  LYS  Whatever may be the cause the effects are too plain to be denied And when a considering Man observes that our Notions do in this most learned and knowing age spread and multiply in opposition to established Laws and every day gain ground against a body so numerous so learned so well supported protected encouraged for the service and defence of Religion I say when a Man observes and considers all this he will be apt to ascribe it to the force of Truth and the merits of our cause which had it been supported with the revenues and establishments of the Church and Universities you may guess what a figure it wou'd make by the figure that it makes without them  EUPH  It is much to be pitied that the learned professors of your Sect do not meet with the encouragement they deserve  LYS  All in  due time People begin to open their eyes It is not impossible but those revenues that in ignorant times were applied to a wrong use may hereafter in a more enlightned age be applied to a better  CRI  But why professors and encouragement for what needs no teaching An acquaintance of mine has a most ingenious Footman that can neither write nor read who learned your whole System in half an hour he knows when and how to nod shake his head smile and give a hint as well as the ablest Sceptic and is in fact a very Minute Philosopher  LYS  Pardon me it takes time to unlearn religious Prejudices and requires a strong head  CRI  I do not know how it might have been once upon a time But in the present laudable education I know several who have been imbued with no religious notions at all and others who have had them so very slight that they rubbed off without the least pains  XX  Panope  young and beautiful under the care of her Aunt an admirer of the Minute Philosophy was kept from learning the Principles of Religion that she might not be accustomed to believe without a reason nor assent to what she did not comprehend  Panope  was not indeed prejudiced with religious notions but got a notion of Intriguing and a notion of Play which ruined her reputation by fourteen and her fortune by four and twenty I have often reflected on the different fate of two Brothers in my neighbourhood  Cleon  the elder being designed an accomplish'd Gentleman was sent to town had the first part of his education in a great School What Religion he learned there was soon unlearned in a certain celebrated Society which till we have a better may pass for a nursery of Minute Philosophers  Cleon  dressed well cou'd cheat at cards had a nice palate understood the mystery of the Die was a mighty Man in the Minute Philosophy And having shined a few years in these accomplishments he died before  thirty childless and rotten expressing the utmost indignation that he cou'd not outlive that old dog his Father who having a great notion of polite manners and knowledge of the World had purchased them to his favourite Son with much expence but had been more frugal in the education of  Chaerephon  the younger Son who was brought up at a CountrySchool and entered a Commoner in the University where he qualified himself for a Parsonage in his Father's gift which he is now possessed of together with the Estate of the Family and a numerous Offspring  LYS  A pack of unpolish'd cubbs I warrant  CRI  Less polished perhaps but more sound more honest and more useful than many who pass for fine Gentlemen  Crates  a worthy Justice of the Peace in this County having had a Son miscarry at  London  by the conversation of a Minute Philosopher used to say with a great air of complaint If a Man spoils my Corn or hurts my Cattle I have a remedy against him but if he spoils my Children I have none  LYS  I warrant you he was for penal methods he wou'd have had a Law to persecute tender Consciences  CRI  The tender Conscience of a Minute Philosopher He who tutored the Son of  Crates  soon after did justice on himself For he taught  Lycidas  a modest young Man the Principles of his Sect  Lycidas  in return debauched his Daughter an only child upon which  Charmides  that was the Minute Philosopher's Name hanged himself Old  Bubalion  in the City is carking and starving and cheating that his Son may drink and game keep Mistresses Hounds and Horses and die in a Jail  Bubalion  nevertheless thinks himself wise and passeth for one that minds the main chance He is a Minute Philosopher which learning he acquired behind the counter from the works of  Prodicus  and  Tryphon  This same  Bubalion  was one night at supper talking against the Immortality of the Soul with two or three grave Citizens one of whom the next day declared  himself bankrupt with five thousand Pound of  Bubalion  's in his hands and the night following he received a note from a Servant who had during his lecture waited at table demanding the sum of fifty guineas to be laid under a stone and concluding with most terrible threats and imprecations  LYS  Not to repeat what hath been already demonstrated That the Public is at bottom no suffer by such accidents which in truth are inconvenient only to private persons who in their turn too may reap the benefit of them I say not to repeat all that hath been demonstrated on that head I shall only ask you whether there wou'd not be Rakes and Rogues although we did not make them Believe me the World always was and always will be the same as long as Men are Men  CRI  I deny that the World is always the same Humane Nature to use  Alciphron  's comparison is like Land better or worse as it is improved and according to the Seeds or Principles sown in it Though no body held your Tenets I grant there might be bad Men by the force of corrupt appetites and irregular passions But where Men to the force of appetite and passion add that of opinion and are wicked from Principle there will be more Men wicked and those more incurably and outrageously so The error of a lively Rake lies in his passions and may be reformed But the dry Rogue who sets up for judgment is incorrigible It is an observation of  Aristotle  's That there are two sorts of Debauchees the  and the  of which the one is so against his judgment the other with it and that there may be hopes of the former but none of the latter And in fact I have always observed that a Rake who is a Minute Philosopher when grown old becomes a sharper in business  LYS  I cou'd name you several such who have grown most noted Patriots  CRI  Patriots such Patriots as  Catiline  and  Marc Antony LYS  And what then Those famous  Romans  were brave though unsuccessful  They wanted neither Sense nor Courage and if their Schemes had taken effect the brisker part of their Countrymen had been much the better for them  XXI  The wheels of Government go on though wound up by different hands if not in the same form yet in some other perhaps a better There is an endless variety in nature weak Men indeed are prejudiced towards Rules and Systems in Life and Government and think if these are gone all is gone But a Man of a great Soul and free Spirit delights in the noble experiment of blowing up Systems and dissolving Governments to mold them anew upon other principles and in another shape Take my word for it there is a plastic nature in things that seeks its own end Pull a State to pieces jumble confound and shake together the particles of Humane Society and then let them stand a while and you shall soon see them settle of themselves in some convenient order where heavy heads are lowest and Men of genius uppermost  EUPH Lysicles  speaks his mind freely  LYS  Where was the advantage of Freethinking if it were not attended with Freespeaking or of Freespeaking if it did not produce Freeacting We are for absolute independent original freedom in thought word and deed Inward freedom without outward is good for nothing but to set a Man's judgment at variance with his practice  CRI  This free way of  Lysicles  may seem new to you it is not so to me As the Minute Philosophers lay it down for a maxim that there is nothing sacred of any kind nothing but what may be made a jest of exploded and changed like the fashion of their Clothes so nothing is more frequent than for them to utter their schemes and principles not only in select Companies but even in public In a certain part of the World where ingenious Men are wont to retail their Speculations I remember to have seen a  Valetundinarian  in a long Wig and a Cloak sitting at the upper end of a  Table with half a dozen of Disciples about him After he had talked about Religion in a manner and with an air that wou'd make one think Atheism established by Law and Religion only tolerated he entered upon Civil Government and observed to his Audience that the natural World was in a perpetual circulation Animals said he who draw their sustenance from the Earth mix with that same Earth and in their turn become Food for Vegetables which again nourish the Animal kind The Vapours that ascend from this Globe descend back upon it in showers The Elements alternately prey upon each other That which one part of nature loseth another gains the sum total remaining always the same being neither bigger nor lesser better nor worse for all these intestine changes Even so said this learned Professor the revolutions in the civil World are no detriment to Human Kind one part whereof rises as the other fails and wins by another's loss A Man therefore who thinks deeply and hath an eye on the whole System is no more a Bigot to Government than to Religion He knows how to suit himself to occasions and make the best of every event For the rest he looks on all translations of power and property from one hand to another with a philosophic indifference Our Lecturer concluded his discourse with a most ingenious Analysis of all political and moral Virtues into their first principles and causes shewing them to be meer fashions tricks of State and illusions on the Vulgar  LYS  We have been often told of the good effects of Religion and Learning Churches and Universities But I dare affirm that a dozen or two ingenious Men of our Sect have done more towards advancing real knowledge by extemporaneous Lectures in the compass of a few years than all the Ecclesiastics put together for as many Centuries  EUPH  And the Nation no doubt thrives accordingly But it seems  Crito  you have heard them discourse  CRI  Upon hearing this and other Lectures  of the same tendency methought it was needless to establish Professors for the Minute Philosophy in either University while there are so many spontaneous Lecturers in every corner of the Streets ready to open Mens Eyes and rub off their prejudices about Religion Loyalty and public Spirit  LYS  If wishing was to any purpose I cou'd wish for a Telescope that might draw into my view things future in time as well as distant in place Oh that I cou'd but look into the next age and behold what it is that we are preparing to be the glorious harvest of our Principles the spreading of which hath produced a visible tendency in the Nation towards something great and new  CRI  One thing I dare say you wou'd expect to see be the changes and agitations of the Public what they will that is every Freethinker upon his legs You are all Sons of Nature who chearfully follow the fortunes of the common Mass  LYS  And it must be owned we have a maxim that  each shou'd take care of one CRI  Alas  Lysicles  you wrong your own Character You wou'd fain pass upon the World and upon your selves for interested cunning Men But can any thing be more disinterested than to sacrifice all regards to the abstracted Speculation of Truth Or can any thing be more void of all cunning than to publish your discoveries to the World teach others to play the whole game and arm Mankind against your selves  XXII  If a Man may venture to suggest so mean a thought as the love of their Country to Souls fired with the love of Truth and the love of Liberty and grasping the whole extent of Nature I wou'd humbly propose it to you Gentlemen to observe the caution practised by all other discoverers projectors and makers of experiments who never hazard all on the first trial Wou'd it not be prudent to try the success of your principles on a small model in some remote corner For instance set up a Colony of Atheists  in  Monomotapa  and see how it prospers before you proceed any further at home Half a dozen Shipload of Minute Philosophers might easily be spread upon so good a design In the mean time you Gentlemen who have found out that there is nothing to be hoped or feared in another Life that Conscience is a Bugbear that the bands of Government and the cement of Human Society are rotten things to be dissolved and crumbled into nothing by the argumentation of every Minute Philosopher be so good as to keep these sublime discoveries to your selves Suffer us our Wives our Children our Servants and our Neighbours to continue in the Belief and way of Thinking established by the Laws of our Country In good earnest I wish you wou'd go try your experiments among the  Hottentots  or  Turks LYS  The  Hottentots  we think well of believing them to be an unprejudiced People but it is to be feared their diet and customs wou'd not agree with our Philosophers As for the  Turks  they are Bigots who have a notion of God and a respect for Jesus Christ I question whether it might be safe to venture among them  CRI  Make your experiment then in some other part of  Christendom LYS  We hold all other Christian Nations to be much under the power of prejudice even our Neighbours the  Dutch  are too much prejudiced in favour of their Religion by Law established for a prudent Man to attempt innovations under their Government Upon the whole it seems we can execute our Schemes no where with so much security and such prospect of success as at home Not to say that we have already made a good progress Oh That we cou'd but once see a Parliament of true staunch libertine Freethinkers  CRI  God forbid I shou'd be sorry to have such Men for my Servants not to say for my Masters  LYS  In that we differ  XXIII  But you will agree with me that the right way to come at this was to begin with extirpating the prejudices of particular Persons We have carried on this work for many years with much art and industry and at first with secrecy working like Moles under ground concealing our progress from the Public and our ultimate views from many even of our own Proselytes blowing the Coals between polemical Divines laying hold on and improving every incident which the passions and folly of Churchmen afforded to the advantage of our Sect As our principles obtained we still proceeded to farther inferences and as our numbers multiplied we gradually disclosed our selves and our Opinions where we are now I need not say We have stubbed and weeded and cleared Humane Nature to that degree that in a little time leaving it alone without any labouring or teaching you shall see natural and just Ideas sprout forth of themselves  CRI  But I have heard a man who had lived long and observed much remark that the worst and most unwholesom weed was this same Minute Philosophy We have had said he divers epidemical distempers in the State but this hath produced of all others the most destructive Plague Enthusiasm had its day its effects were violent and soon over This infects more quietly but spreads widely The former bred a fever in the State this breeds a consumption and final decay A Rebellion or an Invasion alarms and puts the Public upon its defence but a corruption of principles works its ruin more slowly perhaps but more surely This may be illustrated by a Fable I somewhere met with in the writings of a  Swiss  Philosopher setting forth the original of Brandy and Gunpowder The Government of the North being once upon a time vacant the Prince of the power of the air convened a Council in Hell wherein upon competition between two Daemons of rank it was determined they shou'd both  make trial of their abilities and he shou'd succeed who did most mischief One made his appearance in the shape of Gunpowder the other in that of Brandy The former was a declared Enemy and roared with a terrible noise which made folks afraid and put them on their guard The other passed as a Friend and a Physician through the World disguised himself with Sweets and Perfumes and Drugs made his way into the Ladies Cabinets and the Apothecaries Shops and under the notion of helping digestion comforting the Spirits and checring the Heart produced direct contrary effects and having insensibly thrown great numbers of Humane Kind into a lingring but fatal decay was found to people Hell and the Grave so fast as to merit the Governemnt which he still possesses  XXIV  LYS  Those who please may amuse themselves with Fables and Allegories This is plain  English  Liberty is a good thing and we are the support of Liberty  CRI  To me it seems that Liberty and Virtue were made for each other If any Man wish to enslave his Country nothing is a fitter preparative than Vice and nothing leads to Vice so surely as Irreligion For my part I cannot comprehend or find out after having considered it in all lights how this crying down Religion shou'd be the effect of honest views towards a just and legal Liberty Some seem to propose an indulgence in Vice Others may have in prospect the advantages which needy and ambitious Men are used to make in the ruin of a State One may indulge a pert petulant Spirit another hope to be esteemed among Libertines when he wants wit to please or abilities to be useful But be Mens views what they will let us examine what good your principles have done who has been the better for the instructions of these Minute Philosophers Let us compare what we are in respect of Learning Loyalty Honesty Wealth Power and Public Spirit with  what we have been Freethinking as it is called hath wonderfully grown of late years Let us see what hath grown up with it or what effects it hath produced To make a catalogue of ills is disagreeable and the only blessing it can pretend to is Luxury That same blessing which revenged the World upon old  Rome  That same Luxury that makes a Nation like a diseased pampered body look full and fat with one foot in the Grave  LYS  You mistake the matter There are no People who think and argue better about the public good of a State than our Sect who have also invented many things tending to that end which we cannot as yet conveniently put in practice  CRI  But one point there is from which it must be owned the Public hath already received some advantage which is the effect of your principles flowing from them and spreading as they do I mean that old  Roman  practice of Selfmurder which at once puts an end to all distress ridding the World and themselves of the miserable  LYS  You were pleased before to make some reflexions on this Custom and laugh at the irresolution of our Freethinkers But I can aver for matter of fact that they have often recommended it by their example as well as arguments and that it is soley owing to them that a practice so useful and magnanimous hath been taken out of the hands of Lunatics and restored to that credit among Men of sense which it anciently had In whatever light you may consider it this is in fact a solid Benefit But the best effect of our principles is that light and truth so visibly shed abroad in the World From how many prejudices errors perplexities and contradictions have we freed the minds of our FellowSubjects How many hard words and intricate absurd notions had possessed the minds of Men before our Philosophers appeared in the World But now even Women and Children have right and sound notions of things What say you to this  Crito CRI  I say with respect to  these great advantages of destroying Men and Notions that I question whether the Public gains as much by the latter as it loseth by the former For my own part I had rather my Wife and Children all believed what they had no notion of and daily pronounced words without a meaning than that any one of them shou'd cut his Throat or leap out of a Window Errors and nonsense as such are of small concern in the eye of the Public which consider not the metaphysical Truth of notions so much as the tendency they have to produce good or evil Truth it self is valued by the Public as it hath an influence and is felt in the course of Life You may confute a whole shelf of Schoolmen and discover many speculative Truths without any great merit towards your Country But if I am not mistaken the Minute Philosophers are not the Men to whom we are most beholden for discoveries of that kind This I say must be allowed supposing what I by no means grant your notions to be true For to say plainly what I think the tendency of your opinions is so bad that no good Man can endure them and your arguments for them so weak that no wise Man will admit them  LYS  Has it not been proved as clear as the Meridian Sun that the politer sort of Men lead much happier lives and swim in pleasure since the spreading of our Principles But not to repeat or insist further on what has been so amply deduced I shall only add that the advantages flowing from them extend to the tenderest Age and the softer Sex Our principles deliver Children from terrors by night and Ladies from splenetic hours by day Instead of these old fashioned things Prayers and the Bible the grateful amusements of Drams Dice and Billetsdoux have succeeded The fair Sex have now nothing to do but dress and paint drink and game adorn and divert themselves and enter into all the sweet Society of Life  CRI  I thought  Lysicles  the argument from pleasure had been exhausted but since you have not  done with that point let us once more by  Euphranor  's rule cast up the account of pleasure and pain as credit and debt under distinct Articles We will set down in the life of your fine Lady rich clothes dice cordials scandal late hours against vapours distaste remorse losses at play and the terrible distress of ill spent age increasing every day suppose no cruel accident of jealousy no madness or infamy of love yet at the foot of the account you shall find that empty giddy gaudy fluttering thing not half so happy as a butterfly or a grashopper on a Summer's day And for a Rake or Man of pleasure the reckoning will be much the same if you place listlesness ignorance rottenness loathing craving quarrelling and such qualities or accomplishments over against his little circle of fleeting amusements long woe against momentary pleasure and if it be considered that when Sense and Appetite go off though he seek refuge from his Conscience in the Minute Philosophy yet in this you will find if you sift him to the bottom that he affects much believes little knows nothing Upon which  Lysicles  turning to me observed that  Crito  might dispute against fact if he pleased but that every one must see the Nation was the merrier for their principles True answered  Crito  we are a merry Nation indeed Young Men laugh at the old Children despise their Parents and Subjects make a jest of the Government happy effects of the Minute Philosophy  XXV  LYS  Infer what effects you please that will not make our principles less true  CRI  Their truth is not what I am now considering The point at present is the usefulness of your principles and to decide this point we need only take a short view of them fairly proposed and laid together That there is no God or Providence that Man is as the Beasts that perish that his Happiness as theirs consists in obeying animal instincts appetites and passions  that all stings of conscience and sense of guilt are prejudices and errors of Education that Religion is a State trick that Vice is beneficial to the Public that the Soul of Man is corporeal and dissolveth like a flame or vapour that Man is a Machine actuated according to the Laws of motion that consequently he is no agent or subject of guilt that a wise Man will make his own particular individual interest in this present life the rule and measure of all his actions These and such Opinions are it seems the Tenets of a Minute Philosopher who is himself according to his own principles an Organ play'd on by sensible objects a Ball bandied about by appetites and passions so subtle is he as to be able to maintain all this by artful reasonings so sharpsighted and penetrating to the very bottom of things as to find out that the most interested occult cunning is the only true wisdom To compleat his Character this curious piece of Clockwork having no principle of Action within it self and denying that it hath or can have any one Free Thought or Motion sets up for the Patron of Liberty and earnestly contends for  Freethinking Crito  had no sooner made an end but  Lysicles  addressed himself to  Euphranor  and me  Crito  said he has taken a world of pains but convinced me only of one single point to wit That I must despair of Convincing him Never did I in the whole course of my life meet with a Man so deeply immersed in Prejudice let who will pull him out for me But I entertain better hopes of you I can answer said I for my self that my eyes and ears are always open to Conviction I am attentive to all that passes and upon the whole shall form whether right or wrong a very impartial judgment  Crito  said  Euphranor  is a more enterprising Man than I thus to rate and lecture a Philosopher For my part I always find it easier to learn than to teach I shall therefore beg your assistance to rid me of some scruples about the tendency of your Opinions which  I find my self unable to master though never so willing This done though we shou'd not tread exactly in the same steps nor perhaps go the same road yet we shall not run in all points diametrically opposite one to another  XXVI  Tell me now  Lysicles  you who are a minute observer of things whether a shade be more agreeable at morning or evening or noonday  LYS  Doubtless at noonday  EUPH  And what disposeth Men to rest  LYS  Exercise  EUPH  When do Men make the greatest fires  LYS  In the coldest weather  EUPH  And what creates a love for icid Liquors  LYS  Excessive heat  EUPH  What if you raise a Pendulum to a great height on one side  LYS  It will when left to it self ascend so much the higher on the other  EUPH  It shou'd seem therefore that Darkness ensues from Light Rest from Motion Heat from Cold and in general that one Extreme is the consequence of another  LYS  It shou'd seem so  EUPH  And doth not this observation hold in the civil as well as natural World Doth not Power produce Licence and Licence Power Do not Whigs make Tories and Tories Whigs Bigots make Atheists and Atheists Bigots  LYS  Granting this to be true  EUPH  Will it not hence follow that as we abhor Slavish Principles we shou'd avoid running into Licentious ones I am and always was a sincere lover of Liberty Legal  English  Liberty which I esteem a chief blessing ornament and comfort of Life and the great Prerogative of an  Englishman  But is it not to be feared that upon the Nation's running into a Licentiousness which hath never been endured in any civilized Country Men feeling the intolerable evils of one extreme may naturally fall into the other You must allow the bulk of Mankind are not Philosophers like you and  Alciphron LYS  This I readily acknowledge  EUPH  I have another scruple about the tendency of your  Opinions Suppose you shou'd prevail and destroy this Protestant Church and Clergy How cou'd you come at the Popish I am credibly informed there is a great number of Emissaries of the Church of  Rome  disguised in  England  who can tell what harvest a Clergy so numerous so subtle and so well furnished with arguments to work on vulgar and uneducated minds may be able to make in a Country despoiled of all Religion and feeling the want of it Who can tell whether the Spirit of Freethinking ending with the Opposition and the Vanity with the Distinction when the whole Nation are alike Infidels who can tell I say whether in such a juncture the Men of Genius themselves may not affect a new Distinction and be the first converts to Popery  LYS  And suppose they shou'd Between friends it wou'd be no great matter These are our maxims In the first place we hold it wou'd be best to have no Religion at all Secondly we hold that all Religions are indifferent If therefore upon trial we find the Country cannot do without a Religion why not Popery as well as another I know several ingenious Men of our Sect who if we had a Popish Prince on the Throne wou'd turn Papists tomorrow This is a Paradox but I shall explain it A Prince whom we compliment with our Religion to be sure must be grateful  EUPH  I understand you But what becomes of Freethinking all the while  LYS  Oh we shou'd have more than ever of that for we shou'd keep it all to our selves As for the amusement of retailing it the want of this wou'd be largely compensated by solid advantages of another kind  EUPH  It seems then by this account the Tendency you observed in the Nation towards something great and New proves a Tendency towards Popery and Slavery  LYS  Mistake us not good  Euphranor  The thing first in our intention is Consummate Liberty But if this will not do and there must after all be such things tolerated as Religion  and Government we are wisely willing to make the best of both  CRI  This puts me in mind of a thought I have often had That Minute Philosophers are Dupes of the Jesuits The two most avowed professed busy propagators of Infidelity in all companies and upon all occasions that I ever met with were both Bigotted Papists and being both Men of considerable estates suffered considerably on that score which it is wonderful their Thinking Disciples shou'd never reflect upon  Hegemon  a most distinguished Writer among the Minute Philosophers and Hero of the Sect I am well assured was once a Papist and never heard that he professed any other Religion I know that many of the Church of  Rome  abroad are pleased with the growth of Infidelity among us as hoping it may make way for them The Emissaries of  Rome  are known to have personated several other Sects which from time to time have sprung up amongst us and why not this of the Minute Philosophers of all others the best calculated to ruin both Church and State I my self have known a Jesuit abroad talk among  English  Gentlemen like a Freethinker I am credibly informed that Jesuits known to be such by the Minute Philosophers at home are admitted into their Clubs And I have observed them to approve and speak better of the Jesuits than of any other Clergy whatsoever Those who are not acquainted with the subtle Spirit the refined Politics and wonderful Occonomy of that renowned Society need only read the account given of them by the Jesuit  Inchofer  in his Book  De Monarchia Solipsorum  and those who are will not be surprized they shou'd be able to make Dupes of our Minute Philosophers Dupes I say for I can never think they suspect they are only tools to serve the ends of cunninger Men than themselves They seem to me drunk and giddy with a false notion of Liberty and spur'd on by this principle to make mad Experiments on their Country they agree only in pulling  down all that stands in their way without any concerted Scheme and without caring or knowing what to erect in its stead To hear them as I have often done descant on the moral Virtues resolve them into Shame then laugh at Shame as a weakness admire the unconfined lives of Savages despise all order and decency of Education one wou'd think the intention of these Philosophers was when they had pruned and weeded the notions of their fellowsubjects and divested them of their Prejudices to strip them of their Clothes and fill the country with naked Followers of Nature enjoying all the Privileges of Brutality Here  Crito  made a pause and fixed his eyes on  Alciphron  who during this whole coversation had sate thoughtful and attentive without saying a word and with an air one while dissatisfied at what  Lysicles  advanced another serene and pleased seeming to approve some better thought of his own But the day being now far spent  Alciphron  proposed to adjourn the Argument till the following when said he I shall set matters on a new Foundation and in so full and clear a Light as I doubt not will give intire Satisfaction So we changed the discourse and after a repast upon cold provisions took a walk on the Strand and in the cool of the evening returned to  Crito  's  The THIRD DIALOGUE  I Alciphron  's account of Honour  II  Character and conduct of Men of Honour  III  Sense of moral Beauty  IV  The Honestum or  of the ancients  V  Taste for moral Beauty whether a sure guide or rule  VI  Minute Philosophers ravished with the abstract Beauty of Virtue  VII  Their Virtue alone disinterested and heroic  VIII  Beauty of sensible objects what and how perceived  IX  The idea of Beauty explained by Painting and Architecture  X  Beauty of the moral System wherein it consists  XI  It supposeth a Providence  XII  Influence of  and  XIII  Enthusiasm of  Cratylus  compared with the sentiments of  Aristotle XIV  Compared with the Stoical principles  XV  Minute Philosophers their talent for Raillery and Ridicule  XVI  The wisdom of those who make virtue alone its own reward  I  THE following day as we sate round the Teatable in a SummerParlour which looks into the Garden  Alciphron  after the first dish turned down his cup and reclining back in his Chair proceeded as follows Above all the Sects upon earth it is the peculiar Privilege of ours not to be tied down by any Principles While other Philosophers profess a servile adherence to certain Tenets ours assert a noble freedom differing not only one from another but very often the same Man from himself Which method of proceeding beside other advantages hath this annexed to it that we are of all Men the hardest to confute You may perhaps confute a particular  Tenet but then this affects only him who maintains it and so long only as he maintains it Some of our Sect dogmatize more than others and in some more than other points The Doctrine of the usefulness of Vice is a point wherein we are not all agreed Some of us are great admirers of Virtue With others the points of Vice and Virtue are problematical For my own part though I think the Doctrine maintained yesterday by  Lysicles  an ingenious speculation yet upon the whole there are divers Reasons which incline me to depart from it and rather to espouse the Virtuous side of the question with the smallest perhaps but the most contemplative and laudable part of our Sect It seemeth I say after a nice inquiry and balancing on both sides that we ought to prefer Virtue to Vice and that such preference wou'd contribute both to the public Weal and the reputation of our Philosophers You are to know then we have among us several that without one grain of Religion are Men of the nicest Honour and therefore Men of Virtue because Men of Honour Honour is a noble unpolluted Source of Virtue without the least mixture of Fear Interest or Superstition It hath all the advantages without the evils which attend Religion It is the mark of a great and fine soul and is to be found among Persons of Rank and Breeding It affects the Court the Senate and the Camp and in general every Rendezvous of people of fashion  EUPH  You say then that honour is the Source of Virtue  ALC  I do  EUPH  Can a thing be the source of it self  ALC  It cannot  EUPH  The Source therefore is distinguished from that of which it is the Source  ALC  Doubtless  EUPH  Honour then is one thing and Virtue another  ALC  I grant it Virtuous actions are the effect and Honour is the Source or Cause of that effect  EUPH  Tell me Is Honour the Will producing those actions or the final Cause for which they are produced  or right Reason which is their rule and limit or the Object about which they are conversant Or do you by the word  Honour  understand a Faculty or Appetite All which are supposed in one sense or other to be the Source of humane actions  ALC  Nothing of all this  EUPH  Be pleased then to give me some notion or definition of it  Alciphron  having mused a while answered that he defined Honour to be a Principle of virtuous Actions To which  Euphranor  replied if I understand it rightly the word Principle is variously taken Sometimes by Principles we mean the parts of which a whole is composed and into which it may be resolved Thus the Elements are said to be principles of compound bodies And thus words syllables and letters are the principles of Speech Sometimes by Principle we mean a small particular seed the growth or gradual unfolding of which doth produce an Organized Body animal or vegetable in its proper size and shape Principles at other times are supposed to be certain fundamental Theorems in Arts and Sciences in Religion and Politics Let me know in which of these senses or whether it be in some other sense that you understand this word when you say Honour is a Principle of Virtue To this  Alciphron  replied that for his part he meant it in none of those senses but defined Honour to be a certain Ardour or Enthusiasm that glowed in the breast of a gallant Man Upon this  Euphranor  observed it was always admitted to put the Definition in place of the thing defined Is this allowed said he or not  ALC  It is  EUPH  May we not therefore say that a Man of Honour is a warm Man or an Enthusiast  Alciphron  hearing this declared that such exactness was to no purpose that Pedants indeed may dispute and define but cou'd never reach that high sense of Honour which distinguished the fine Gentleman and was a thing rather to be felt than explained  II  Crito  perceiving that  Alciphron  cou'd not bear being pressed any farther on that article and willing to give some satisfaction to  Euphranor  said that of himself indeed he should not undertake to explain so nice a point but he wou'd retail to them part of a conversation he once heard between  Nicander  a Minute Philosopher and  Menecles  a Christian upon the same subject which was for substance as follows  M  From what principle are you Gentlemen virtuous  N  From Honour We are Men of Honour  M  May not a Man of Honour debauch another's wife or get drunk or sell a vote or refuse to pay his debts without lessening or tainting his Honour  N  He may have the vices and faults of a Gentleman But is obliged to pay debts of Honour that is all such as are contracted by Play  M  Is not your Man of Honour always ready to resent Affronts and engage in Duels  N  He is ready to demand and give Gentleman's satisfaction upon all proper occasions  M  It shou'd seem by this account that to Ruin tradesmen Break faith to one's own wife Corrupt another Man's Take bribes Cheat the Public Cut a Man's throat for a word are all points consistent with your principle of Honour  N  It cannot be denied that we are Men of gallantry Men of fire Men who know the world and all that  M  It seems therefore that Honour among Infidels is like Honesty among Pirates something confined to themselves and which the Fraternity perhaps may find their account in but every one else shou'd be constantly on his guard against By this Dialogue continued  Crito  a Man who lives out of the grand  Monde  may be enabled to form some notion of what the world calls Honour and men of Honour  EUPH  I must intreat you not to put me off with  Nicander  's opinion whom I know nothing of but rather give me your own judgment drawn from your own observation upon Men of Honour  CRI  If I must pronounce  I can very sincerely assure you that by all I have heard or seen I cou'd never find that Honour considered as a principle distinct from Conscience Religion Reason and Virtue was more than an empty name And I do verily believe that those who build upon that notion have less Virtue than other Men and that what they have or seem to have is owing to Fashion being of the reputable kind if not to a Conscience early imbued with religious principles and afterwards retaining a Tincture from them without knowing it These two principles seem to account for all that looks like Virtue in those Gentlemen Your Men of Fashion in whom animal life abounds a sort of Bullies in Morality who disdain to have it thought they are afraid of Conscience these descant much upon Honour and affect to be called Men of Honour rather than conscientious or honest Men But by all that I cou'd ever observe this specious Character where there is nothing of Conscience or Religion underneath to give it life and substance is no better than a meteor or painted cloud  EUPH  I had a confused notion that Honour was something nearly connected with truth and that Men of Honour were the greatest enemies to all Hypocrisy Fallacy and Disguise  CRI  So far from that an Infidel who sets up for the nicest Honour shall without the least grain of Faith or Religion pretend himself a Christian take any test join in any act of worship kneel pray receive the Sacrament to serve an interest The same person without any impeachment of his Honour shall most solemnly declare and promise in the face of God and the World that he will love his Wife and forsaking all others keep only to her when at the same time it is certain he intends never to perform one tittle of his vow and convinceth the whole world of this as soon as he gets her in his power and her fortune for the sake of which this Man of untainted Honour makes no scruple to cheat and lye  EUPH  We have a notion here in the  Country that it was of all things most odious and a matter of much risque and hazard to give the Lye to a Man of Honour  CRI  It is very true He abhors to take the Lye but not to tell it  III  Alciphron  having heard all this with great composure of mind and countenance spake as follows You are not to think that our greatest strength lies in our greatest Number Libertines and meer Men of Honour No we have among us Philosophers of a very different character Men of curious contemplation not governed by such gross things as Sense and Custom but of an abstracted Virtue and sublime Morals and the less religious the more virtuous For Virtue of the high and disinterested kind no Man is so well qualified as an Infidel it being a mean and selfish thing to be virtuous through fear or hope The notion of a Providence and future State of Rewards and Punishments may indeed tempt or scare Men of abject spirit into practices contrary to the natural bent of their Souls but will never produce a true and genuine Virtue To go to the bottom of things to analyse Virtue into its first principles and fix a scheme of Duty on its true basis you must understand that there is an idea of Beauty natural to the mind of Man This all Men desire this they are pleased and delighted with for its own sake purely from an Instinct of Nature A Man needs no arguments to make him discern and approve what is beautiful it strikes at first sight and attracts without a reason And as this Beauty is found in the shape and form of corporeal things so also is there analogous to it a Beauty of another kind an order a symmetry and comeliness in the moral world And as the Eye perceiveth the one so the Mind doth by a certain interior sense perceive the other which sense talent or faculty is ever quickest and purest in the noblest Minds Thus as by sight I discern the Beauty of a Plant or an Animal even so the mind apprehends the  moral Excellence the Beauty and Decorum of Justice and Temperance And as we readily pronounce a Dress becoming or an Attitude graceful we can with the same free untutored judgment at once declare whether this or that Conduct or Action be comely and beautiful To relish this kind of Beauty there must be a delicate and fine Taste But where there is this natural Taste nothing further is wanting either as a principle to convince or as a motive to induce Men to the love of Virtue And more or less there is of this Taste or Sense in every creature that hath Reason All Rational Beings are by nature social They are drawn one towards another by natural affections they unite and incorporate into families clubs parties and commonwealths by mutual Sympathy As by means of the sensitive Soul our several distinct parts and members do consent towards the animal Functions and are connected in one Whole even so the several parts of these Rational Systems or Bodies Politic by virtue of this moral or interior Sense are held together have a fellowfeeling do succour and protect each other and jointly cooperate towards the same end Hence that joy in Society that propension towards doing good to our Kind that gratulation and delight in beholding the virtuous deeds of other Men or in reflecting on our own By contemplation of the fitness and order of the parts of a moral System regularly operating and knit together by benevolent affections the Mind of Man attaineth to the highest notion of Beauty Excellence and Perfection Seized and rapt with this sublime idea our Philosophers do infinitely despise and pity whoever shall propose or accept any other motive to Virtue Interest is a mean ungenerous thing destroying the merit of Virtue and Falshood of every kind is inconsistent with the genuine spirit of Philosophy  CRI  The Love therefore that you bear to moral Beauty and your passion for abstracted Truth will not suffer you to think with patience  of those fraudulent Impositions upon Mankind Providence the Immortality of the Soul and a future Retribution of rewards and punishments which under the notion of promoting do it seems destroy all true Virtue and at the same time contradict and disparage your noble Theories manifestly tending to the perturbation and disquiet of Mens minds and filling them with fruitless hopes and vain terrors  ALC  Mens first Thoughts and natural Notions are the best in moral matters And there is no need that Mankind shou'd be preached or reasoned or frightened into Virtue a thing so natural and congenial to every Human Soul Now if this be the case as it certainly is it follows that all the ends of Society are secured without Religion and that an Infidel bids fair to be the most virtuous Man in a true sublime and heroic Sense  IV  EUPH  O  Alciphron  while you talk I feel an affection in my soul like the trembling of one lute upon striking the unison strings of another Doubtless there is a Beauty of the mind a Charm in Virtue a Symmetry and Proportion in the moral world This moral Beauty was known to the ancients by the name of  Honestum  or  And in order to know its force and influence it may not be amiss to inquire what it was understood to be and what light it was placed in by those who first considered it and gave it a name  according to  Aristotle  is the  or laudable according to  Plato  it is the  or  pleasant or profitable which is meant with respect to a reasonable mind and its true interest Now I wou'd fain know whether a mind which considers an action as laudable be not carried beyond the bare action it self to regard the opinion of others concerning it  ALC  It is  EUPH  And whether this be a sufficient ground or principle of Virtue for a Man to act upon when he thinks himself removed from the eye and observation of every other intelligent Being  ALC  It seems not  EUPH  Again I ask whether a Man who doth a thing pleasant or profitable as such might not be supposed to forbear doing it or even to do the contrary upon the prospect of greater pleasure or profit  ALC  He might  EUPH  Doth it not follow from hence that the Beauty of Virtue or  in either  Aristotle  's or  Plato  's sense is not a sufficient principle or ground to engage sensual and worldlyminded Men in the practice of it  ALC  What then  EUPH  Why then it will follow that Hope of reward and Fear of punishment are highly expedient to cast the balance of pleasant and profitable on the side of virtue and thereby very much conduce to the benefit of Human Society  Alciphron  upon this appealed Gentlemen said he you are witnesses of this unfair proceeding of  Euphranor  who argues against us from explications given by  Plato  and  Aristotle  of the Beauty of Virtue which are things we have nothing to say to the Philosophers of our Sect abstracting from all Praise Pleasure and Interest when they are enamoured and transported with that sublime Idea I beg pardon replied  Euphranor  for supposing the Minute Philosophers of our days think like those ancient Sages But you must tell me  Alciphron  since you do not think fit to adopt the sense of  Plato  or  Aristotle  what sense it is in which you understand the Beauty of Virtue Define it explain it make me to understand your meaning that so we may argue about the same thing without which we can never come to a conclusion  V  ALC  Some things are better understood by definitions and descriptions but I have always observed that those who wou'd define explain and dispute about this point make the least of it Moral Beauty is of so peculiar and abstracted a nature something so subtile fine and fugacious that it will not bear being handled and inspected like every gross  and common subject You will therefore pardon me if I stand upon my Philosophic liberty and choose rather to intrench my self within the general and indefinite sense rather than by entering into a precise and particular explication of this Beauty perchance lose sight of it or give you some hold whereon to cavil and infer and raise doubts queries and difficulties about a point as clear as the Sun when no body reasons upon it  EUPH  How say you  Alciphron  is that notion clearest when it is not considered  ALC  I say it is rather to be felt than understood a certain  je ne sÃ§ay quoy  An object not of the discursive faculty but of a peculiar sense which is properly called the moral sense being adapted to the preception of moral Beauty as the Eye to colours or the Ear to sounds  EUPH  That Men have certain instinctive Sensations or Passions from nature which make them amiable and useful to each other I am clearly convinced Such are a Fellowfeeling with the distressed a Tenderness for our offspring an Affection towards our friends our neighbours and our country an Indignation against things base cruel or unjust These Passions are implanted in the Human Soul with several other fears and appetites aversions and desires some of which are strongest and uppermost in one mind others in another Shou'd it not therefore seem a very uncertain guide in morals for a Man to follow his passion or inward feeling and wou'd not this rule infallibly lead different Men different ways according to the prevalency of this or that appetite or passion  ALC  I do not deny it  EUPH  And will it not follow from hence that Duty and Virtue are in a fairer way of being practised if Men are led by Reason and Judgment balancing low and sensual pleasures with those of a higher kind comparing present losses with future gains and the uneasiness and disgust of every Vice with the delightful practice of the opposite Virtue and the pleasing reflexions and hopes which attend it Or can there  be a stronger motive to Virtue than the shewing that considered in all lights it is every Man's true interest  VI  ALC  I tell you  Euphranor  we contemn the Virtue of that Man who computes and deliberates and must have a reason for being virtuous The refined Moralists of our Sect are ravished and transported with the abstract Beauty of Virtue They disdain all forinsecal motives to it and love Virtue only for Virtue's sake Oh Rapture Oh Enthusiasm Oh the Quintessence of Beauty Methinks I cou'd dwell for ever on this Contemplation But rather than entertain my self I must endeavour to convince you Make an experiment on the first Man you meet Propose a villanous or unjust action Take his first sense of the matter and you shall find he detests it He may indeed be afterwards misled by Arguments or overpowered by Temptation but his original unpremeditated and genuine thoughts are just and orthodox How can we account for this but by a moral sense which left to it self hath as quick and true a perception of the Beauty and Deformity of Human Actions as the Eye hath of Colours  EUPH  May not this be sufficiently accounted for by Conscience Affection Passion Education Reason Custom Religion which principles and habits for ought I know may be what you metaphorically call a Moral Sense  ALC  What I call a moral sense is strictly properly and truly such and in kind different from all those things you enumerate It is what all men have though all may not observe it Upon this  Euphranor  smiled and said  Alciphron  has made discoveries where I least expected it For said he in regard to every other point I shou'd hope to learn from him but for the knowledge of my self or the faculties and powers of my own mind I shou'd have looked at home And there I might have looked long enough without  finding this new talent which even now after being tutored I cannot comprehend For  Alciphron  I must needs say is too Sublime and Aenigmatical upon a point which of all others ought to be most clearly understood I have often heard that your deepest adepts and oldest professors in science are the obscurest  Lysicles  is young and speaks plain Wou'd he but favour us with his sense of this point it might perhaps prove more upon a level with my apprehension  VII  Lysicles  shook his head and in a grave and earnest manner addressed the Company Gentlemen said he  Alciphron  stands upon his own legs I have no part in these refined notions he is at present engaged to defend If I must subdue my passions abstract contemplate be enamoured of Virtue in a word if I must be an Enthusiast I owe so much deference to the laws of my Country as to choose being an Enthusiast in their way Besides it is better being so for some end than for none This Doctrine hath all the solid inconveniences without the amusing hopes and prospects of the Christian  ALC  I never counted on  Lysicles  for my Second in this point which after all doth not need his assistance or explication All subjects ought not to be treated in the same manner The way of Definition and Division is dry and pedantic Besides the subject is sometimes too obscure sometimes too simple for this method One while we know too little of a point another too much to make it plainer by discourse  CRI  To hear  Alciphron  talk puts me in mind of that Ingenious  Greek  who having wrapt a man's brother up in a cloak asked him whether he knew that person being ready either by keeping on or pulling off the cloak to confute his answer whatever it shou'd be For my part I believe if matters were fairly stated that rational satisfaction that peace of mind that inward comfort and conscientious  joy which a good Christian finds in good actions wou'd not be found to fall short of all the Ecstasy Rapture and Enthusiasm supposed to be the effect of that high and undescribed principle In earnest can any Ecstasy be higher any Rapture more affecting than that which springs from the love of God and Man from a Conscience void of offence and an inward discharge of Duty with the secret delight trust and hope that attends it  ALC  O  Euphranor  we Votaries of Truth do not envy but pity the groundless joys and mistaken hopes of a Christian And as for Conscience and rational Pleasure how can we allow a Conscience without allowing a vindictive Providence Or how can we suppose the charm of Virtue consists in any pleasure or benefit attending virtuous actions without giving great advantages to the Christian Religion which it seems excites its believers to Virtue by the highest Interests and Pleasures in reversion Alas shou'd we grant this there wou'd be a door opened to all those rusty Declaimers upon the necessity and usefulness of the great points of Faith the Immortality of the Soul a Future State Rewards and Punishments and the like exploded Conceits which according to our system and principles may perhaps produce a low popular interested kind of Virtue but must absolutely destroy and extinguish it in the sublime and heroic sense  VIII  EUPH  What you now say is very intellible I wish I understood your main principle as well  ALC  And are you then in earnest at a loss Is it possible you shou'd have no notion of Beauty or that having it you shou'd not know it to be amiable amiable I say in it self and for it self  EUPH  Pray tell me  Alciphron  are all mankind agreed in the notion of a beauteous face  ALC  Beauty in Human Kind seems to be of a more mixt and various nature forasmuch as the passions sentiments and  qualities of the Soul being seen through and blending with the features work differently on different minds as the sympathy is more or less But with regard to other things is there no steady principle of Beauty Is there upon earth a Human mind without the idea of order harmony and proportion  EUPH  O  Alciphron  it is my weakness that I am apt to be lost and bewildered in abstractions and generalities but a particular thing is better suited to my faculties I find it easy to consider and keep in view the objects of sense let us therefore try to discover what their Beauty is or wherein it consists and so by the help of these sensible things as a scale or ladder ascend to moral and intellectual Beauty Be pleased then to inform me what it is we call Beauty in the objects of sense  ALC  Every one knows Beauty is that which pleases  EUPH  There is then Beauty in the smell of a Rose or the taste of an Apple  ALC  By no means Beauty is to speak properly perceived only by the eye  EUPH  It cannot therefore be defined in general that which pleaseth  ALC  I grant it cannot  EUPH  How then shall we limit or define it  Alciphron  after a short pause said that Beauty consisted in a certain symmetry or proportion pleasing to the eye  EUPH  Is this proportion one and the same in all things or is it different in different kinds of things  ALC  Different doubtless The proportions of an Ox wou'd not be beautiful in a Horse And we may observe also in things inanimate that the Beauty of a Table a Chair a Door consists in different proportions  EUPH  Doth not this proportion imply the relation of one thing to another  ALC  It doth  EUPH  And are not these relations founded in size and shape  ALC  They are  EUPH  And to make the proportions just must not those mutual relations of size and shape in the parts be such as shall make the whole compleat and perfect in its kind  ALC  I grant they must  EUPH  Is not a thing said  to be perfect in its kind when it answers the end for which it was made  ALC  It is  EUPH  The parts therefore in true proportions must be so related and adjusted to one another as that they may best conspire to the use and operation of the whole  ALC  It seems so  EUPH  But the comparing Parts one with another the considering them as belonging to one Whole and the referring this whole to its use or end shou'd seem the work of Reason Shou'd it not  ALC  It shou'd  EUPH  Proportions therefore are not strictly speaking perceived by the sense of Sight but only by Reason through the means of Sight  ALC  This I grant  EUPH  Consequently Beauty in your sense of it is an object not of the eye but of the mind  ALC  It is  EUPH  The Eye therefore alone cannot see that a Chair is handsom or a Door well proportioned  ALC  It seems to follow but I am not clear as to this point  EUPH  Let us see if there be any difficulty in it Cou'd the Chair you sit on think you be reckon'd well proportioned or handsom if it had not such a height breadth wideness and was not so far reclinedas to afford a convenient seat  ALC  It cou'd not  EUPH  The Beauty therefore or Symmetry of a Chair cannot be apprehended but by knowing its use and comparing its figure with that use which cannot be done by the Eye alone but is the effect of Judgment It is therefore one thing to see an Object and another to discern its Beauty  ALC  I admit this to be true  IX  EUPH  The Architects judge a Door to be of a beautiful Proportion when its height is double of the breadth But if you shou'd invert a wellproportion'd Door making its breadth become the height and its height the breadth the figure would still be the same but without that Beauty in one Situation which it had in another What can be the cause of this but that in the forementioned Supposition the Door  wou'd not yield a convenient entrance to Creatures of a Human Figure But if in any other part of the Universe there shou'd be supposed rational animals of an inverted Stature they must be supposed to invert the Rule for Proportion of Doors and to them that wou'd appear beautiful which to us was disagreeable  ALC  Against this I have no Objection  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  is there not something truly decent and beautiful in Dress  ALC  Doubtless there is  EUPH  Are any likelier to give us an Idea of this Beauty in Dress than Painters and Sculptors whose proper business and study it is to aim at graceful Representations  ALC  I believe not  EUPH  Let us then examine the Draperies of the great Masters in these Arts How for instance they use to clothe a Matron or a Man of Rank Cast an eye on those Figures said he pointing to some Prints after  Raphael  and  Guido  that hung upon the Wall what appearance do you think an  English  Courtier or Magistrate with his  Gothic  succinct plaited Garment and his fullbottom'd Wig or one of our Ladies in her unnatural Dress pinched and stiffened and enlarged with Hoops and Whalebone and Buckram must make among those Figures so decently clad in Draperies that fall into such a variety of natural easy and ample Folds that appear with so much dignity and simplicity that cover the Body without encumbering it and adorn without altering the Shape  ALC  Truly I think they must make a very ridiculous appearance  EUPH  And what do you think this proceeds from Whence is it that the Eastern Nations the  Greeks  and the  Romans  naturally ran into the most becoming Dresses while our  Gothic  Gentry after so many Centuries racking their Inventions mending and altering and improving and whirling about in a perpetual rotation of Fashions have never yet had the luck to stumble on any that was not absurd and ridiculous It is not from hence that instead  of consulting Use Reason and Convenience they abandon themselves to irregular Fancy the unnatural Parent of Monsters Whereas the Ancients considering the use and end of Dress made it subservient to the Freedom Ease and Convenience of the Body and having no Notion of mending or changing the natural Shape they aimed only at shewing it with decency and advantage And if this be so are we not to conclude that the Beauty of Dress depends on its subserviency to certain Ends and Uses  ALC  This appears to be true  EUPH  This subordinate relative nature of Beauty perhaps will be yet plainer if we examine the respective Beauties of a Horse and a Pillar  Virgil  's Description of the former is  Illi ardua cervix  Argutumque caput brevis alvus obesaque terga  Luxuriatque toris animosum pectus  Now I wou'd fain know whether the perfections and uses of a Horse may not be reduced to these three points Courage Strength and Speed and whether each of the Beauties enumerated doth not occasion or betoken one of these Perfections After the same manner if we inquire into the Parts and Proportions of a beautiful Pillar we shall perhaps find them answer to this same Idea Those who have considered the Theory of Architecture tell us  See the learned Patriarch of  Aquilcia  's Commentary on  Vitruvius  l c  the Proportions of the three  Grecian  Orders were taken from the Human Body as the most beautiful and perfect Production of Nature Hence were derived those graceful Ideas of Columns which had a Character of Strength without clumsiness or of Delicacy without weakness Those beautiful Proportions were I say taken originally from Nature which in her Creatures as hath been already observed referreth them to some end use or design  The  Gonsiezza  also or swelling and the diminution of a Pillar is it not in such proportion as to make it appear strong and light at the same time In the same manner must not the whole Entablature with its Projections be so proportioned as to seem great but not heavy light but not little inasmuch as a Deviation into either extreme wou'd thwart that reason and use of Things wherein their Beauty is founded and to which it is subordinate The Entablature and all its Parts and Ornaments Architrave Freeze Cornice Triglyphs Metopes Modiglions and the rest have each an use or appearance of use in giving firmness and union to the Building in protecting it from the Weather and casting off the Rain in representing the Ends of Beams with their intervals the production of Rafters and so forth And if we consider the graceful Angels in Frontispieces the Spaces between the Columns or the Ornaments of their Capitels shall we not find that their Beauty riseth from the appearance of Use or the imitation of natural Things whose Beauty is originally founded on the same Principle which is indeed the grand distinction between  Graecian  and  Gothic  Architecture the latter being fantastical and for the most part founded neither in Nature nor in Reason in Necessity nor Use the appearance of which accounts for all the Beauty Grace and Ornament of the other  CRI  What  Euphranor  has said confirms the Opinion I always entertained that the Rules of Architecture were founded as all other Arts which flourished among the  Greeks  in Truth and Nature and good Sense But the Ancients who from a thorough consideration of the Grounds and Principles of Art formed their Idea of Beauty did not always confine themselves strictly to the same Rules and Proportions But whenever the particular Distance Position Elevation or Dimension of the Fabric or its Parts seemed to require it made no scruple to depart from them without deserting the  original Principles of Beauty which governed whatever Deviations they made This latitude or licence might not perhaps be safely trusted with most modern Architects who in their bold Sallies seem to act without aim or design and to be governed by no Idea no Reason or principle of Art but pure Caprice joined with a thorough contempt of that noble Simplicity of the Ancients without which there can be no unity gracefulness or grandeur in their Works which of consequence must serve only to disfigure and dishonour the Nation being so many Monuments to future Ages of the opulence and ill taste of the present which it is to be feared wou'd succeed as wretchedly and make as mad work in other Affairs were Men to follow instead of rules precepts and models their own taste and first thoughts of Beauty  ALC  I shou'd now methinks be glad to see a little more distinctly the use and tendency of this Digression upon Architecture  EUPH  Was not Beauty the very thing we inquired after  ALC  It was  EUPH  What think you  Alciphron  can the appearance of a thing please at this time and in this place which pleased two thousand Years ago and two thousand Miles off without some real principle of Beauty  ALC  It cannot  EUPH  And is not this the case with respect to a just piece of Architecture  ALC  No body denies it  EUPH  Architecture the noble Offspring of judgment and fancy was gradually formed in the most polite and knowing Countries of  Asia Egypt Greece  and  Italy  It was cherished and esteemed by the most flourishing States and most renowned Princes who with vast expence improved and brought it to perfection It seems above all other Arts peculiarly conversant about Order Proportion and Symmetry May it not therefore be supposed on all accounts most likely to help us to some rational Notion of the  je ne sÃ§ay quoy  in Beauty And in effect have we not learned from this Digression that as there is no Beauty without  Proportion so Proportions are to be esteem'd just and true only as they are relative to some certain use or end their Aptitude and Subordination to which end is at bottom that which makes them please and charm  ALC  I admit all this to be true  X  EUPH  According to this Doctrine I wou'd fain know what Beauty can be found in a moral System formed connected and governed by Chance Fate or any other blind unthinking Principle forasmuch as without thought there can be no end or design and without an end there can be no use and without use there is no aptitude or fitness of Proportion from whence Beauty springs  ALC  May we not suppose a certain vital Principle of Beauty Order and Harmony diffused throughout the World without supposing a Providence inspecting punishing and rewarding the moral Actions of Men Without supposing the Immortality of the Soul or a Life to come in a word without admitting any part of what is commonly called Faith Worship and Religion  CRI  Either you suppose this Principle intelligent or not intelligent If the latter it is all one with Chance or Fate which was just now argued against If the former let me intreat  Alciphron  to explain to me wherein consists the Beauty of a moral System with a supreme Intelligence at the head of it which neither protects the innocent punishes the wicked nor rewards the virtuous To suppose indeed a Society of rational Agents acting under the Eye of Providence concurring in one design to promote the common benefit of the whole and conforming their Actions to the established Laws and Order of the Divine Parental Wisdom Wherein each particular Agent shall not consider himself apart but as the Member of a great City whose Author and Founder is God In which the Civil Laws are no other than the Rules of Virtue and the Duties of Religion And where every one's  true Interest is combined with his Duty To suppose this wou'd be delightful on this Supposition a Man need be no Stoic or Knighterrant to account for his Virtue In such a System Vice is Madness Cunning is Folly Wisdom and Virtue are the same thing where notwithstanding all the crooked Paths and Byroads the wayward Appetites and Inclinations of Men sovereign Reason is sure to reform whatever seems amiss to reduce that which is devious make straight that which is crooked and in the last Act wind up the whole Plot according to the exactest Rules of Wisdom and Justice In such a System or Society governed by the wisest precepts enforced by the highest rewards and discouragements it is delightful to consider how the regulation of Laws the distribution of Good and Evil the aim of moral Agents do all conspire in due Subordination to promote the noblest End to wit the compleat Happiness or Wellbeing of the whole In contemplating the Beauty of such a moral System we may cry out with the Psalmist  Very excellent Things are spoken of thee thou City of God  XI  In a System of Spirits subordinate to the Will and under the Direction of the Father of Spirits governing them by Laws and conducting them by Methods suitable to wise and good Ends there will be great Beauty But in an incoherent fortuitous System governed by Chance or in a blind System governed by Fate or in any System where Providence doth not preside how can Beauty be which cannot be without order which cannot be without design When a Man is conscious that his will is inwardly conformed to the Divine Will producing Order and Harmony in the Universe and conducting the whole by the justest Methods to the best End This gives a beautiful Idea But on the other hand a Consciousness of Virtue overlooked neglected distressed by Men and not regarded or  rewarded by God illused in this World without Hope or Prospect of being better used in another I wou'd fain know where is the Pleasure of this Reflection where is the Beauty of this Scene Or how cou'd any Man in his Senses think the spreading such Notions the way to spread or propagate Virtue in the World Is it not I beseech you an ugly System in which you can suppose no Law and prove no Duty wherein Men thrive by Wickedness and suffer by Virtue Would it not be a disagreeable Sight to see an honest Man peeled by Sharpers to see virtuous Men injured and despised while Vice triumph'd An Enthusiast may entertain himself with Visions and fine Talk about such a System but when it comes to be considered by Men of cool Heads and close Reason I believe they will find no Beauty nor Perfection in it nor will it appear that such a moral System can possibly come from the same Hand or be of a piece with the natural throughout which there shines so much Order Harmony and Proportion  ALC  Your Discourse serves to confirm me in my Opinion You may remember I declared that touching this Beauty of Morality in the high Sense a Man's first Thoughts are best and that if we pretend to examine and inspect and reason we are in danger to lose sight of it That in Fact there is such a thing cannot be doubted when we consider that in these Days some of our Philosophers have a high Sense of Virtue without the least Notion of Religion a clear Proof of the Usefulness and Efficacy of our Principles  XII  CRI  Not to dispute the Virtue of Minute Philosophers we may venture to call its Cause in question and make a doubt whether it be an inexplicable Enthusiastic Notion of Moral Beauty or rather as to me it seems what was already assigned by  Euphranor  Complexion Custom and Religious Education But allowing what Beauty you please  to Virtue in an Irreligious System it cannot be less in a Religious unless you will suppose that her Charms diminish as her Dowry increaseth The Truth is a Believer hath all the Motives from the Beauty of Virtue in any sense whatsoever that an Unbeliever can possibly have besides other Motives which an Unbeliever hath not Hence it is plain those of your Sect who have Moral Virtue owe it not to their peculiar Tenets which serve only to lessen the Motives to Virtue Those therefore who are good are less good and those who are bad are more bad than they wou'd have been were they Believers  EUPH  To me it seems those heroic infidel Inamorato's of abstracted Beauty are much to be pitied and much to be admired  Lysicles  hearing this said with some Impatience Gentlemen You shall have my whole Thoughts upon this Point plain and frank All that is said about a Moral Sense or Moral Beauty in any signification either of  Alciphron  or  Euphranor  or any other I take to be at bottom meer Bubble and Pretence The  and the  the beautiful and decent are Things outward relative and superficial which have no Effect in the dark but are specious Topics to discourse and expatiate upon as some formal Pretenders of our Sect though in other Points very Orthodox are used to do But shou'd one of them get into Power you wou'd find him no such Fool as  Euphranor  imagines He wou'd soon shew he had found out that the Love of one's Country is a Prejudice That Mankind are Rogues and Hypocrites and that it were Folly to sacrifice one's self for the sake of such That all Regards center in this Life and that as this Life is to every Man his own Life it clearly follows that Charity begins at Home Benevolence to Mankind is perhaps pretended but Benevolence to himself is practised by the Wise The livelier sort of our Philosophers do not scruple to own these Maxims and as for the graver if they are true to their Principles one may guess  what they must think at the Bottom  CRI  Whatever may be the Effect of pure Theory upon certain select Spirits of a peculiar Make or in some other Parts of the World I do verily think that in this Country of ours Reason Religion Law are all together little enough to subdue the Outward to the Inner Man and that it must argue a wrong Head and weak Judgment to suppose that without them Men will be enamoured of the golden Mean To which my Countrymen perhaps are less inclined than others there being in the Make of an  English  Mind a certain Gloom and Eagerness which carries to the sad Extreme Religion to Fanaticism Freethinking to Atheism Liberty to Rebellion Nor shou'd we venture to be governed by Taste even in matters of less Consequence The Beautiful in Dress Furniture and Building is as  Euphranor  hath observed something real and well grounded And yet our  English  do not find it out of themselves What wretched Work do they and other Northern People make when they follow their own Taste of Beauty in any of these Particulars instead of acquiring the true which is to be got from ancient Models and the Principles of Art as in the Case of Virtue from great Models and Meditation so far as natural Means can go But in no Case is it to be hoped that  will be the leading Idea of the many who have quick Senses strong Passions and gross Intellects  XIII  ALC  The fewer they are the more ought we esteem and admire such Philosophers whose Souls are touched and transported with this sublime Idea  CRI  But then one might expect from such Philosophers so much good Sense and Philanthropy as to keep their Tenets to themselves and consider their weak Brethren who are more strongly affected by certain Senses and Notions of another kind than that of the Beauty of pure disinterested Virtue  Cratylus  a Man prejudiced against the Christian Religion  of a crazy Constitution of a Rank above most Mens Ambition and a Fortune equal to his Rank had little Capacity for sensual Vices or Temptation to dishonest ones  Cratylus  having talked himself or imagined that he had talked himself into a Stoical Enthusiasm about the Beauty of Virtue did under the Pretence of making Men heroically virtuous endeavour to destroy the Means of making them reasonably and humanly so A clear Instance that neither Birth nor Books nor Conversation can introduce a Knowledge of the World into a conceited Mind which will ever be its own Object and contemplate Mankind in its own Mirrour  ALC Cratylus  was a Lover of Liberty and of his Country and had a mind to make Men incorrupt and virtuous upon the purest and most disinterested Principles  CRI  His Conduct seems just as wise as if a Monarch shou'd give out that there was neither Jayl nor Executioner in his Kingdom to enforce the Laws but that it wou'd be beautiful to observe them and that in so doing Men wou'd taste the pure Delight which results from Order and  Decorum ALC  After all is it not true that certain ancient Philosophers of great Note held the same Opinion with  Cratylus  declaring that he did not come up to the Character or deserve the Title of a good Man who practised Virtue for the sake of any thing but its own Beauty  CRI  I believe indeed that some of the Ancients said such Things as gave Occasion for this Opinion  Aristotle  Ethic ad Eudemum lib cap ult  distinguisheth between two Characters of a good Man the one he calleth  or simply good the other  from whence the Compound Term  which cannot perhaps be render'd by any one Word in our Language But his Sense is plainly this  he defineth to be that Man to whom the  good Things of Nature are good for according to him those Things which are vulgarly esteemed the greatest Goods as Riches Honours Power and bodily Perfections are indeed good by Nature but they happen nevertheless to be hurtful and bad to some Persons upon the account of evil Habits Inasmuch as neither a Fool nor an unjust Man nor an Intemperate can be at all the better for the Use of them any more than a sick Man for using the Nourishment proper for these who are in Health But  is that Man in whom are to be found all Things worthy and decent and laudable purely as such and for their own sake and who practiseth Virtue from no other Motive but the sole Love of her own innate Beauty That Philosopher observes likewise that there is a certain political Habit such as the  Spartans  and others had who thought Virtue was to be valued and practised on account of the natural Advantages that attend it For which Reason he adds They are indeed good Men but they have not the  or supreme consummate Virtue From hence it is plain that according to  Aristotle  a Man may be a good Man without believing Virtue its own Reward or being only moved to Virtue by the Sense of Moral Beauty It is also plain that he distinguisheth the political Virtues of Nations which the Publick is every where concerned to maintain from this sublime and speculative kind It might also be observed that his exalted Idea did consist with supposing a Providence which inspects and rewards the Virtues of the best Men For saith he in another Place  Ad Nicom l c  if the Gods have any Care of Human Affairs as it appears they have it shou'd seem reasonable to suppose they are most delighted with the most excellent Nature and most approaching their own which is the Mind and that they will reward those who chiefly love and cultivate  what is most dear to them The same Philosopher observes  Ibid c  that the Bulk of Mankind are not naturally disposed to be awed by Shame but by Fear nor to abstain from vicious Practices on account of their Deformity but only of the Punishment which attends them And again  Ibid  he tells us that Youth being of it self averse from Abstinence and Sobriety shou'd be under the Restraint of Laws regulating their Education and Employment and that the same Discipline shou'd be continued even after they became Men For which saith he we want Laws and in one word for the whole ordering of Life inasmuch as the Generality of Mankind obey rather Force than Reason and are influenced rather by Penalties than the Beauty of Virtue  From all which it is very plain what  Aristotle  wou'd have thought of those who shou'd go about to lessen or destroy the Hopes and Fears of Mankind in order to make them virtuous on this sole Principle of the Beauty of Virtue  XIV  ALC  But whatever the  Stagirite  and his Peripatetics might think is it not certain that the Stoics maintained this Doctrine in its highest Sense asserting the Beauty of Virtue to be allsufficient that Virtue was her own Reward that this alone cou'd make a Man happy in spight of all those Things which are vulgarly esteemed the greatest Woes and Miseries of Human Life And all this they held at the same time that they believed the Soul of Man to be of a corporeal Nature and in Death dissipated like a Flame or Vapour  CRI  It must be owned the Stoics sometimes talk as if they believed the Morality of the Soul  Seneca  in a Letter of his to  Lucilius  speaks much like a Minute Philosopher in this Particular But in several other Places he declares  himself of a clear contrary Opinion affirming that the Souls of Men after Death mount aloft into the Heavens look down upon Earth entertain themselves with the Theory of coelestial Bodies the Course of Nature and the Conversation of wise and excellent Men who having lived in distant Ages and Countries upon Earth make one Society in the other World It must also be acknowledged that  Marcus Antoninus  sometimes speaks of the Soul as perishing or dissolving into its Elementary Parts But it is to be noted that he distinguisheth three Principles in the Composition of Human Nature the    L c  Body Soul Mind or as he otherwise expresseth himself  and  Flesh Spirit and governing Principle What he calls the  or Soul containing the brutal Part of our Nature is indeed represented as a Compound dissoluble and actually dissolved by Death But the  or  the Mind or ruling Principle he held to be of a pure coelestial Nature  a Particle of God which he sends back intire to the Stars and the Divinity Besides among all his magnificent Lessons and splendid Sentiments upon the Force and Beauty of Virtue he is positive as to the Being of God and that not meerly as a plastic Nature or Soul of the World but in the strict Sense of a Providence inspecting and taking care of Human Affairs  Marc Antonin l Â§  The Stoics therefore though their Style was high and often above Truth and Nature yet it cannot be said that they so resolved every Motive to a virtuous Life into the sole Beauty of Virtue as to endeavour to destroy the Belief of the Immortality of the Soul and a distributive Providence After all allowing the disinterested Stoics therein not unlike our modern Quietists to have made Virtue its own sole Reward  in the most rigid and absolute Sense yet what is this to those who are no Stoics If we adopt the whole Principles of that Sect admitting their Notions of Good and Evil their celebrated Apathy and in one word setting up for compleat Stoics we may possibly maintain this Doctrine with a better Grace at least it will be of a piece and consistent with the whole But he who shall borrow this splendid Patch from the Stoics and hope to make a Figure by inserting it into a Piece of modern Composition seasoned with the Wit and Notions of these Times will indeed make a Figure but perhaps it may not be in the Eyes of a wise Man the Figure he intended  XV  Though it must be owned the present Age is very indulgent to every thing that aims at profane Raillery which is alone sufficient to recommend any fantastical Composition to the Public You may behold the Tinsel of a modern Author pass upon this knowing and learned Age for good Writing affected Strains for Wit Pedantry for Politeness Obscurities for Depths Ramblings for Flights the most aukward Imitation for original Humour and all this upon the sole Merit of a little artful Profaneness  ALC  Every one is not alike pleased with Writings of Humour nor alike capable of them It is the fine Irony of a Man of Quality  That certain Reverend Authors who can condescend to Laywit are nicely qualified to hit the Air of Breeding and Gentility and that they will in time no doubt refine their Manner to the Edification of the polite World who have been so long seduced by the way of Raillery and Wit  The Truth is the various Taste of Readers requireth various Kinds of Writers Our Sect hath provided for this with great Judgment To proselyte the graver sort we have certain profound Men at Reason and Argument For the Coffeehouses and Populace we have Declaimers of a copious Vein Of such a Writer it is no Reproach  to say  fluit lutulentus  he is the fitter for his Readers Then for Men of Rank and Politeness we have the finest and wittiest  Railleurs  in the World whose Ridicule is the surest Test of Truth  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  are those ingenious  Railleurs  Men of Knowledge  ALC  Very knowing  EUPH  Do they know for Instance the  Copernican  System or the Circulation of the Blood  ALC  One wou'd think you judged of our Sect by your Country Neighbours There is no body in Town but knows all those Points  EUPH  You believe then Antipodes Mountains in the Moon and the Motion of the Earth  ALC  We do  EUPH  Suppose five or six Centuries ago a Man had maintained these Notions among the  beau Esprits  of an  English  Court how do you think they would have been received  ALC  With great Ridicule  EUPH  And now it wou'd be ridiculous to ridicule them  ALC  It wou'd  EUPH  But Truth was the same then and now  ALC  It was  EUPH  It shou'd seem therefore that Ridicule is no such sovereign Touchstone and Test of Truth as you Gentlemen imagine  ALC  One thing we know Our Raillery and Sarcasms gall the black Tribe and that is our Comfort  CRI  There is another thing it may be worth your while to know That Men in a Laughing Fit may applaud a Ridicule which shall appear contemptible when they come to themselves witness the Ridicule of  Socrates  by the Comic Poet the Humour and Reception it met with no more proving that than the same will yours to be just when calmly considered by Men of Sense  ALC  After all thus much is certain our ingenious Men make Converts by deriding the Principles of Religion And take my word it is the most successful and pleasing Method of Conviction These Authors laugh Men out of their Religion as  Horace  did out of their Vices  Admissi circum praecordia ludunt  But a Bigot cannot relish or find out their Wit  XVI  CRI  Wit without Wisdom if there be such a thing is hardly worth finding And as for the Wisdom of these Men it is of a kind so peculiar one may well suspect it  Cicero  was a Man of Sense and no Bigot nevertheless he makes  Scipio  own himself much more vigilant and vigorous in the Race of Virtue from supposing Heaven the Prize  Somn Scipionis  And he introduceth  Cato  declaring he wou'd never have undergone those virtuous Toils for the Service of the Public if he had thought his Being was to end with this Life  De Senectute    ALC  I acknowledge  Cato Scipio  and  Cicero  were very well for their Times but you must pardon me if I do not think they arrived at the high consummate Virtue of our modern Freethinkers  EUPH  It shou'd seem then that Virtue flourisheth more than ever among us  ALC  It shou'd  EUPH  And this abundant Virtue is owing to the Method taken by your profound Writers to recommend it  ALC  This I grant  EUPH  But you have acknowledged that the Enthusiastic Lovers of Virtue are not the many of your Sect but only a few select Spirits To which  Alciphron  making no Answer  Crito  addressed himself to  Euphranor  To make said he a true Estimate of the Worth and Growth of modern Virtue you are not to count the virtuous Men but rather to consider the quality of their Virtue Now you must know the Virtue of these refined Theorists is something so pure and genuine that a very little goes far and is in truth invaluable To which that reasonable interested Virtue of the old  English  or  Spartan  kind can bear no proportion  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  are there not Diseases of the Soul as well as of the Body  ALC  Without doubt  EUPH  And are not those Diseases vicious Habits  ALC  They are  EUPH  And as bodily Distempers are cured by Physic those of the Mind are cured by Philosophy are they not  ALC  I acknowledge it  EUPH  It seems therefore that Philosophy is a Medicine for the Soul of Man  ALC  It is  EUPH  How shall we be able to judge of Medicines or know which to prefer Is it not from the Effects wrought by them  ALC  Doubtless  EUPH  Where an Epidemical Distemper rages suppose a new Physician shou'd condemn the known established Practice and recommend another Method of Cure wou'd you not in proportion as the Bills of Mortality increased be tempted to suspect this new Method notwithstanding all the plausible Discourse of its Abettors  ALC  This serves only to amuse and lead us from the question  CRI  It puts me in mind of my Friend  Lamprocles  who needed but one Argument against Infidels I observed said he that as Infidelity grew there grew Corruption of every kind and new Vices This simple Observation on matter of Fact was sufficient to make him notwithstanding the Remonstrance of several ingenious Men imbue and season the Minds of his Children betimes with the Principles of Religion The new Theories which our acute Moderns have endeavoured to substitute in place of Religion have had their full Course in the present Age and produced their Effect on the Minds and Manners of Men That Men are Men is a sure Maxim But it is as sure that  Englishmen  are not the same Men they were whether better or worse more or less virtuous I need not say Every one may see and judge Though indeed after  Aristides  had been banished and  Socrates  put to death at  Athens  a Man without being a Conjurer might guess what the Beauty of Virtue cou'd do in  England  But there is now neither room nor occasion for guessing We have our own Experience to open our Eyes which yet if we continue to keep shut till the Remains  of religious Education are quite worn off from the Minds of Men it is to be feared we shall then open them wide not to avoid but to behold and lament our Ruin  ALC  Be the Consequences what they will I can never bring my self to be of a mind with those who measure Truth by Convenience Truth is the only Divinity that I adore Wherever Truth leads I shall follow  EUPH  You have then a Passion for Truth  ALC  Undoubtedly  EUPH  For all Truths  ALC  For all  EUPH  To know or to publish them  ALC  Both  EUPH  What wou'd you undeceive a Child that was taking Physic Wou'd you officiously set an Enemy right that was making a wrong Attack Wou'd you help an enraged Man to his Sword  ALC  In such Cases common Sense directs one how to behave  EUPH  Common Sense it seems then must be consulted whether a Truth be salutary or hurtful fit to be declared or concealed  ALC  How you wou'd have me conceal and stifle the Truth and keep it to my self Is this what you aim at  EUPH  I only make a plain Inference from what you grant As for my self I do not believe your Opinions true And although you do you shou'd not therefore if you wou'd appear consistent with yourself think it necessary or wise to publish hurtful Truths What Service can it do Mankind to lessen the Motives to Virtue or what Damage to increase them  ALC  None in the World But I must needs say I cannot reconcile the received Notions of a God and Providence to my Understanding and my Nature abhors the Baseness of conniving at a Falshood  EUPH  Shall we therefore appeal to Truth and examine the Reasons by which you are withheld from believing these Points  ALC  With all my Heart but enough for the present We will make this the Subject of our next Conference  The FOURTH DIALOGUE  I  Prejudices concerning a Deity  II  Rules laid down by  Alciphron  to be observed in proving a God  III  What Sort of Proof he expects  IV  Whence we collect the being of other Thinking Individuals  V  The same Method  Ã  fortiori  proves the Being of God  VI Alciphron  's second Thoughts on this Point  VII  God speaks to Men  VIII  How Distance is perceived by Sight  IX  The proper Objects of Sight at no Distance  X  Lights Shades and Colours variously combined form a Language  XI  The Signification of this Language learned by Experience  XII  God explaineth himself to the Eyes of Men by the arbitrary Use of sensible Signs  XIII  The Prejudice and twofold Aspect of a Minute Philosopher  XIV  God present to Mankind informs admonishes and directs them in a sensible Manner  XV  Admirable Nature and Use of this visual Language  XVI  Minute Philosophers content to admit a God in certain Senses  XVII  Opinion of some who hold that Knowledge and Wisdom are not properly in God  XVIII  Dangerous Tendency of this Notion  XIX  Its Original  XX  The Sense of Schoolmen upon it  XXI  Scholastic Use of the Terms Analogy and Analogical explained Analogical Perfections of God misunderstood  XXII  God intelligent wise and good in the proper Sense of the Words  XXIII  Objection from Moral Evil considered  XXIV  Men argue from their own Defects against a Deity  XXV  Religious Worship reasonable and expedient  I  EARLY the next Morning as I looked out of my Window I saw  Alciphron  walking in the Garden with all the Signs of a Man in deep Thought Upon which I went down to him  Alciphron  said I this early and profound Meditation puts me in no small Fright How so Because I shou'd be sorry to be convinced there was no God The Thought of Anarchy in Nature is to me more shocking than in Civil Life inasmuch as Natural Concerns are more important than Civil and the Basis of all others I grant replied  Alciphron  that some Inconvenience may possibly follow from disproving a God but as to what you say of Fright and Shocking all that is nothing but mere Prejudice Men frame an Idea or Chimaera in their own Minds and then fall down and worship it Notions govern Mankind but of all Notions that of God's governing the World hath taken the deepest Root and spread the farthest It is therefore in Philosophy an heroical Atchievement to dispossess this imaginary Monarch of his Government and banish all those Fears and Spectres which the Light of Reason alone can dispel  Non radii solis non lucida tela diei  Discutiunt sed Naturae species ratioque  Lucretius    My Part said I shall be to stand by as I have hitherto done and take Notes of all that passeth during this memorable Event while a Minute Philosopher not six Foot high attempts to dethrone the Monarch of the Universe Alas replied  Alciphron  Arguments are not to be measured by Feet and Inches One Man may see more than a Million and a short Argument managed by a Freethinker may be sufficient  to overthrow the most Gigantic Chimaera As we were engaged in this Discourse  Crito  and  Euphranor  joined us I find you have been beforehand with us to day said  Crito  to  Alciphron  and taken the Advantage of Solitude and early Hours while  Euphranor  and I were asleep in our Beds We may therefore expect to see Atheism placed in the best Light and supported by the strongest Arguments  II  ALC  The Being of a God is a Subject upon which there has been a world of Commonplace which it is needless to repeat Give me leave therefore to lay down certain Rules and Limitations in order to shorten our present Conference For as the End of debating is to persuade all those Things which are foreign to this End shou'd be left out of our Debate First then let me tell you I am not to be persuaded by Metaphysical Arguments such for Instance as are drawn from the Idea of an Allperfect Being or the Absurdity of an infinite Progression of Causes This sort of Arguments I have always found dry and jejune and as they are not suited to my way of Thinking they may perhaps puzzle but never will convince me Secondly I am not to be persuaded by the Authority either of past or present Ages of Mankind in general or of particular wise Men all which passeth for little or nothing with a Man of sound Argument and free Thought Thirdly All Proofs drawn from Utility or Convenience are foreign to the purpose They may prove indeed the Usefulness of the Notion but not the Existence of the Thing Whatever Legislators or Statesmen may think Truth and Convenience are very different Things to the rigorous Eyes of a Philosopher And now that I may not seem partial I will limit myself also not to object in the first place from any thing that may seem irregular or unaccountable in the Works of Nature against a Cause of infinite Power and Wisdom because I already  know the Answer you wou'd make to wit That no one can judge of the Symmetry and Use of the Parts of an infinite Machine which are all relative to each other and to the whole without being able to comprehend the intire Machine or the whole Universe And in the second place I shall engage my self not to object against the Justice and Providence of a Supreme Being from the Evil that befals good Men and the Prosperity which is often the Portion of wicked Men in this Life because I know that instead of admitting this to be an Objection against a Deity you wou'd make it an Argument for a future State in which there shall be such a Retribution of Rewards and Punishments as may vindicate the Divine Attributes and set all Things right in the End Now these Answers though they shou'd be admitted for good ones are in truth no Proofs of the Being of God but only Solutions of certain Difficulties which might be objected supposing it already proved by proper Arguments Thus much I thought fit to premise in order to save Time and Trouble both to you and myself  CRI  I think that as the proper End of our Conference ought to be supposed the Discovery and Defence of Truth so Truth may be justified not only by persuading its Adversaries but where that cannot be done by shewing them to be unreasonable Arguments therefore which carry Light have their Effect even against an Opponent who shuts his Eyes because they shew him to be obstinate and prejudiced Besides this Distinction between Arguments that puzzle and that convince is least of all observed by Minute Philosophers and need not therefore be observed by others in their favour But perhaps  Euphranor  may be willing to encounter you on your own Terms in which Case I have nothing farther to say  III  EUPH Alciphron  acts like a skilful General who is bent upon gaining the Advantage of the  Ground and alluring the Enemy out of their Trenches We who believe a God are intrenched within Tradition Custom Authority and Law And nevertheless instead of attempting to force us he proposes that we shou'd voluntarily abandon these Intrenchments and make the Attack when we may act on the defensive with much Security and Ease leaving him the Trouble to dispossess us of what we need not resign Those Reasons continued he addressing himself to  Alciphron  which you have mustered up in this Morning's Meditation if they do not weaken must establish our Belief of a God for the utmost is to be expected from so great a Master in his Profession when he sets his Strength to a Point  ALC  I hold the confused Notion of a Deity or some invisible Power to be of all Prejudices the most unconquerable When half a dozen ingenious Men are got together over a Glass of Wine by a chearful Fire in a Room well lighted we banish with ease all the Spectres of Fancy or Education and are very clear in our Decisions But as I was taking a solitary Walk before it was broad Daylight in yonder Grove me thought the Point was not quite so clear nor cou'd I readily recollect the Force of those Arguments which used to appear so conclusive at other Times I had I know not what Awe upon my Mind and seemed haunted by a sort of Panic which I cannot otherwise account for than by supposing it the Effect of Prejudice For you must know that I like the rest of the World was once upon a Time catechised and tutored into the Belief of a God or Spirit There is no surer Mark of Prejudice than the believing a Thing without Reason What Necessity then can there be that I shou'd set myself the difficult Task of proving a Negative when it is sufficient to observe that there is no Proof of the Affirmative and that the admitting it without Proof is unreasonable Prove therefore your Opinion or if you cannot you may indeed remain in possession of  it but you will only be possessed of a Prejudice  EUPH  O  Alciphron  to content you we must prove it seems and we must prove upon your own Terms But in the first place let us see what sort of Proof you expect  ALC  Perhaps I may not expect it but I will tell you what sort of Proof I wou'd have And that is in short such Proof as every Man of Sense requires of a Matter of Fact or the Existence of any other particular Thing For Instance shou'd a Man ask why I believe there is a King of  Great Britain  I might answer because I had seen him Or a King of  Spain  because I had seen those who saw him But as for this King of Kings I neither saw him myself nor any one else that ever did see him Surely if there be such a Thing as God it is very strange that he shou'd leave himself without a Witness that Men shou'd still dispute his Being and that there shou'd be no one evident sensible plain Proof of it without recourse to Philosophy or Metaphysics A Matter of Fact is not to be proved by Notions but by Facts This is clear and full to the Point You see what I wou'd be at Upon these Principles I defy Superstition  EUPH  You believe then as far as you can see  ALC  That is my Rule of Faith  EUPH  How will you not believe the Existence of Things which you hear unless you also see them  ALC  I will not say so neither When I insisted on seeing I wou'd be understood to mean perceiving in general Outward Objects make very different Impressions upon the animal Spirits all which are comprised under the common Name of Sense And whatever we can perceive by any Sense we may be sure of  IV  EUPH  What do you believe then there are such Things as animal Spirits  ALC  Doubtless  EUPH  By what Sense do you perceive them  ALC  I do not perceive them immediately by any of my Senses I am nevertheless persuaded of their  Existence because I can collect it from their Effects and Operations They are the Messengers which running to and fro in the Nerves preserve a Communication between the Soul and outward Objects  EUPH  You admit then the Being of a Soul  ALC  Provided I do not admit an immaterial Substance I see no Inconvenience in admitting there may be such a Thing as a Soul And this may be no more than a thin fine Texture of subtile Parts or Spirits residing in the Brain  EUPH  I do not ask about its Nature I only ask whether you admit that there is a Principle of Thought and Action and whether it be perceivable by Sense  ALC  I grant that there is such a Principle and that it is not the Object of Sense itself but inferred from Appearances which are perceived by Sense  EUPH  If I understand you rightly from animal Functions and Motions you infer the Existence of animal Spirits and from reasonable Acts you infer the Existence of a reasonable Soul Is it not so  ALC  It is  EUPH  It shou'd seem therefore that the Being of Things imperceptible to Sense may be collected from Effects and Signs or sensible Tokens  ALC  It may  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  is not the Soul that which makes the principal Distinction between a real Person and a Shadow a living Man and a Carcase  ALC  I grant it is  EUPH  I cannot therefore know that you for Instance are a distinct thinking Individual or a living real Man by surer or other Signs than those from which it can be inferred that you have a Soul  ALC  You cannot  EUPH  Pray tell me are not all acts immediately and properly perceived by Sense reducible to Motion  ALC  They are  EUPH  From Motions therefore you infer a Mover or Cause and from reasonable Motions or such as appear calculated for a reasonable End a rational Cause Soul or Spirit  ALC  Even so  V  EUPH  The Soul of Man actuates but a small Body an insignificant Particle in respect of the great Masses of Nature the Elements and heavenly Bodies and System of the World And the Wisdom that appears in those Motions which are the Effect of Human Reason is incomparably less than that which discovers it self in the structure and use of organized natural Bodies Animal or Vegetable A Man with his Hand can make no Machine so admirable as the hand it self Nor can any of those Motions by which we trace out Human Reason approach the skill and contrivance of those wonderful Motions of the Heart and Brain and other vital parts which do not depend on the Will of Man  ALC  All this is true  EUPH  Doth it not follow then that from natural Motions independent of Man's Will may be inferred both Power and Wisdom incomparably greater than that of the Human Soul  ALC  It shou'd seem so  EUPH  Further is there not in natural Productions and Effects a visible Unity of counsel and design Are not the Rules fixed and immoveable Do not the same Laws of Motion obtain throughout The same in  China  and here the same two thousand years ago and at this day  ALC  All this I do not deny  EUPH  Is there not also a Connexion or Relation between Animals and Vegetables between both and the Elements between the Elements and Heavenly Bodies so that from their mutual Respects Influences Subordinations and Uses they may be collected to be parts of one whole conspiring to one and the same end and fulfilling the same design  ALC  Supposing all this to be true  EUPH  Will it not then follow that this vastly great or infinite Power and Wisdom must be supposed in one and the same Agent Spirit or Mind and that we have at least as clear full and immediate Certainty of the being of this infinitely wise and powerful Spirit as of any one Human  Soul whatsoever besides our own  ALC  Let me consider I suspect we proceed too hastily What Do you pretend you can have the same Assurance of the Being of a God that you can have of mine whom you actually see stand before you and talk to you  EUPH  The very same if not greater  ALC  How do you make this appear  EUPH  By the person  Alciphron  is meant an individual thinking thing and not the Hair Skin or visible Surface or any part of the outward Form Colour or Shape of  Alciphron ALC  This I grant  EUPH  And in granting this you grant that in a strict Sense I do not see  Alciphron  i e that individual thinking thing but only such visible signs and tokens as suggest and infer the Being of that invisible thinking Principle or Soul Even so in the self same manner it seems to me that though I cannot with Eyes of Flesh behold the Invisible God yet I do in the strictest Sense behold and perceive by all my Senses such Signs and Tokens such Effects and Operations as suggest indicate and demonstrate an invisible God as certainly and with the same Evidence at least as any other Signs perceived by Sense do suggest to me the Existence of your Soul Spirit or thinking Principle which I am convinced of only by a few Signs or Effects and the Motions of one small organized Body Whereas I do at all times and in all places perceive sensible Signs which evince the Being of God The point therefore doubted or denied by you at the beginning now seems manifestly to follow from the Premises Throughout this whole Inquiry have we not considered every step with care and made not the least advance without clear Evidence You and I examined and assented singly to each foregoing Proposition What shall we do then with the Conclusion For my part if you do not help me out I find my self under an absolute necessity of admitting it for true You  must therefore be content henceforward to bear the blame if I live and die in the Belief of a God  VI  ALC  It must be confest I do not readily find an answer There seems to be some Foundation for what you say But on the other hand if the point was so clear as you pretend I cannot conceive how so many sagacious Men of our Sect shou'd be so much in the dark as not to know or believe one Syllable of it  EUPH  O  Alciphron  it is not our present business to account for the Oversights or vindicate the Honour of those great Men the Freethinkers when their very Existence is in danger of being called in question  ALC  How so  EUPH  Be pleased to recollect the Concessions you have made and then shew me if the Arguments for a Deity be not conclusive by what better Argument you can prove the Existence of that thinking Thing which in strictness constitutes the Freethinker As soon as  Euphranor  had uttered these Words  Alciphron  stopt short and stood in a posture of Meditation while the rest of us continued our walk and took two or three turns after which he joined us again with a smiling Countenance like one who had made some Discovery I have found said he what may clear up the point in dispute and give  Euphranor  intire satisfaction I wou'd say an Argument which will prove the Existence of a Freethinker the like whereof cannot be applied to prove the Existence of a God You must know then that your Notion of our perceiving the Existence of God as certainly and immediately as we do that of a Human Person I cou'd by no means digest though I must own it puzzled me till I had considered the matter At first methought a particular Structure Shape or Motion was the most certain Proof of a thinking reasonable Soul But a little attention satisfied me that these things have no necessary Connexion with Reason Knowledge and Wisdom And that allowing them to be certain Proofs of a living Soul  they cannot be so of a thinking and reasonable one Upon second Thoughts therefore and a minute Examination of this point I have found that nothing so much convinces me of the Existence of another Person as his speaking to me It is my hearing you talk that in strict and philosophical Truth is to me the best Argument for your Being And this is a peculiar Argument inapplicable to your purpose for you will not I suppose pretend that God speaks to Man in the same clear and sensible manner as one Man doth to another  VII  EUPH  How is then the Impression of Sound so much more evident than that of other Senses Or if it be is the voice of Man louder than that of Thunder  ALC  Alas You mistake the point What I mean is not the Sound of Speech meerly as such but the arbitrary use of sensible Signs which have no Similitude or necessary Connexion with the things signified so as by the apposite Management of them to suggest and exhibit to my mind an endless variety of things differing in nature time and place thereby informing me entertaining me and directing me how to act not only with regard to things near and present but also with regard to things distant and future No matter whether these Signs are pronounced or written whether they enter by the Eye or the Ear they have the same use and are equally Proofs of an intelligent thinking designing Cause  EUPH  But what if it shou'd appear that God really speaks to Man wou'd this content you  ALC  I am for admitting no inward Speech no holy Instincts or Suggestions of Light or Spirit All that you must know passeth with Men of Sense for nothing If you do not make it plain to me that God speaks to Men by outward sensible Signs of such sort and in such manner as I have defined you do nothing  EUPH  But if it shall appear plainly that God speaks to Men by the intervention  and use of arbitrary outward sensible Signs having no Resemblance or necessary Connexion with the things they stand for and suggest if it shall appear that by innumerable Combinations of these Signs an endless variety of things is discovered and made known to us and that we are thereby instructed or informed in their different Natures that we are taught and admonished what to shun and what to pursue and are directed how to regulate our Motions and how to act with respect to things distant from us as well in time as place will this content you  ALC  It is the very thing I wou'd have you make out for therein consists the force and use and nature of Language  VIII  EUPH  Look  Alciphron  do you not see the Castle upon yonder Hill  ALC  I do  EUPH  Is it not at a great Distance from you  ALC  It is  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  is not Distance a Line turned Endwise to the Eye  ALC  Doubtless  EUPH  And can a Line in that Situation project more than one single Point on the Bottom of the Eye  ALC  It cannot  EUPH  Therefore the Appearance of a long and of a short Distance is of the same Magnitude or rather of no Magnitude at all being in all Cases one single Point  ALC  It seems so  EUPH  Shou'd it not follow from hence that Distance is not immediately perceived by the Eye  ALC  It shou'd  EUPH  Must it not then be perceived by the mediation of some other Thing  ALC  It must  EUPH  To discover what this is let us examine what Alteration there may be in the Appearance of the same Object placed at different Distances from the Eye Now I find by Experience that when an Object is removed still farther and farther off in a direct Line from the Eye its visible Appearance still grows lesser and fainter and this Change of Appearance being proportional and universal seems to me to be that by which we apprehend the various Degrees  of Distance  ALC  I have nothing to object to this  EUPH  But Littleness or Faintness in their own Nature seem to have no necessary Connexion with greater Length of Distance  ALC  I admit this to be true  EUPH  Will it not follow then that they cou'd never suggest it but from Experience  ALC  It will  EUPH  That is to say we perceive Distance not immediately but by mediation of a Sign which hath no Likeness to it or necessary Connexion with it but only suggests it from repeated Experience as Words do Things  ALC  Hold  Euphranor  now I think of it the Writers in Optics tell us of an Angle made by the two Optic Axes where they meet in the visible Point or Object which Angle the obtuser it is the nearer it shews the Object to be and by how much the acuter by so much the farther off and this by a necessary demonstrable Connexion  EUPH  The Mind then finds out the Distance of Things by Geometry  ALC  It doth  EUPH  Shou'd it not follow therefore that no body cou'd see but those who had learned Geometry and knew something of Lines and Angles  ALC  There is a sort of natural Geometry which is got without Learning  EUPH  Pray inform me  Alciphron  in order to frame a Proof of any kind or deduce one Point from another is it not necessary that I perceive the Connexion of the Terms in the Premises and the Connexion of the Premises with the Conclusion and in general to know one Thing by means of another must I not first know that other Thing when I perceive your Meaning by your Words must I not first perceive the Words themselves and must I not know the Premises before I infer the Conclusion  ALC  All this is true  EUPH  Whoever therefore collects a nearer Distance from a wider Angle or a farther Distance from an acuter Angle must first perceive the Angles themselves And he who doth not perceive those Angles can infer nothing from them Is it so or not  ALC  It is as you say  EUPH  Ask now the first Man you meet whether he perceives or knows any thing of those Optic Angles Or whether he ever thinks about them or makes any Inferences from them either by natural or artificial Geometry What Answer do you think he wou'd make  ALC  To speak the Truth I believe his Answer wou'd be that he knew nothing of those Matters  EUPH  It cannot therefore be that Men judge of Distance by Angles Nor consequently can there be any Force in the Argument you drew from thence to prove that Distance is perceived by means of something which hath a necessary Connexion with it  ALC  I agree with you  IX  EUPH  To me it seems that a Man may know whether he perceives a Thing or no and if he perceives it whether it be immediately or mediately And if mediately whether by means of something like or unlike necessarily or arbitrarily connected with it  ALC  It seems so  EUPH  And is it not certain that Distance is perceived only by Experience if it be neither perceived immediately by itself nor by means of any Image nor of any Lines and Angles which are like it or have a necessary Connexion with it  ALC  It is  EUPH  Doth it not seem to follow from what hath been said and allowed by you that before all Experience a Man wou'd not imagine the Things he saw were at any Distance from him  ALC  How let me see  EUPH  The Littleness or Faintness of Appearance or any other Idea or Sensation not necessarily connected with or resembling Distance can no more suggest different Degrees of Distance or any Distance at all to the Mind which hath not experienced a Connexion of the Things signifying and signified than Words can suggest Notions before a Man hath learned the Language  ALC  I allow this to be true  EUPH  Will it not thence follow that a Man born blind and made to see wou'd upon first  receiving his Sight take the Things he saw not to be at any Distance from him but in his Eye or rather in his Mind  ALC  I must own it seems so and yet on the other hand I can hardly persuade myself that if I were in such a State I shou'd think those Objects which I now see at so great Distance to be at no Distance at all  EUPH  It seems then that you now think the Objects of Sight are at a Distance from you  ALC  Doubtless I do Can any one question but yonder Castle is at a great Distance  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  can you discern the Doors Windows and Battlements of that same Castle  ALC  I cannot At this Distance it seems only a small round Tower  EUPH  But I who have been at it know that it is no small round Tower but a large square Building with Battlements and Turrets which it seems you do not see  ALC  What will you infer from thence  EUPH  I wou'd infer that the very Object which you strictly and properly perceive by Sight is not that Thing which is several Miles distant  ALC  Why so  EUPH  Because a little round Object is one thing and a great square Object is another Is it not  ALC  I cannot deny it  EUPH  Tell me is not the visible Appearance alone the proper Object of Sight  ALC  It is What think you now said  Euphranor  pointing towards the Heavens of the visible Appearance of yonder Planet Is it not a round luminous Flat no bigger than a Sixpence  ALC  What then  EUPH  Tell me then what you think of the Planet itself Do you not conceive it to be a vast Opaque Globe with several unequal Risings and Vallies  ALC  I do  EUPH  How can you therefore conclude that the proper Object of your Sight exists at a Distance  ALC  I confess I know not  EUPH  For your farther Conviction do but consider that crimson Cloud Think you that if you were in the very Place where it is you wou'd perceive any Thing like what you now see  ALC  By  no means I shou'd perceive only a dark Mist  EUPH  Is it not plain therefore that neither the Castle the Planet nor the Cloud which you see here are those real ones which you suppose exist at a Distance  X  ALC  What am I to think then Do we see any thing at all or is it altogether Fancy and Illusion  EUPH  Upon the whole it seems the proper Objects of Sight are Light and Colours with their several Shades and Degrees all which being infinitely diversified and combined do form a Language wonderfully adapted to suggest and exhibit to us the Distances Figures Situations Dimensions and various Qualities of tangible Objects not by Similitude nor yet by Inference of necessary Connexion but by the arbitrary Imposition of Providence just as Words suggest the Things signified by them  ALC  How Do we not strictly speaking perceive by Sight such Things as Trees Houses Men Rivers and the like  EUPH  We do indeed perceive or apprehend those Things by the Faculty of Sight But will it follow from thence that they are the proper and immediate Objects of Sight any more than that all those Things are the proper and immediate Objects of Hearing which are signified by the Help of Words or Sounds  ALC  You wou'd have us think then that Light Shades and Colours variously combined answer to the several Articulations of Sound in Language and that by means thereof all sorts of Objects are suggested to the Mind through the Eye in the same manner as they are suggested by Words or Sounds through the Ear that is neither from necessary Deduction to the Judgment nor from Similitude to the Fancy but purely and solely from Experience Custom and Habit  EUPH  I wou'd not have you think any thing more than the Nature of Things obligeth you to think nor submit in the least to my Judgment but only to the Force of Truth which is an Imposition  that I suppose the freest Thinkers will not pretend to be exempt from  ALC  You have led me it seems Step by Step till I am got I know not where But I shall try to get out again if not by the Way I came yet by some other of my own finding Here  Alciphron  having made a short Pause proceeded as follows  XI  Answer me  Euphranor  shou'd it not follow from these Principles that a Man born blind and made to see wou'd at first Sight not only not perceive their Distance but also not so much as know the very Things themselves which he saw for Instance Men or Trees which surely to suppose must be absurd  EUPH  I grant in consequence of those Principles which both you and I have admitted that such a one wou'd never think of Men Trees or any other Objects that he had been accustomed to perceive by Touch upon having his Mind filled with new Sensations of Light and Colours whose various Combinations he doth not yet understand or know the Meaning of no more than a  Chinese  upon first hearing the Words  Man  and  Tree  wou'd think of the Things signified by them In both Cases there must be Time and Experience by repeated Acts to acquire a Habit of knowing the Connexion between the Signs and Things signified that is to say of understanding the Language whether of the Eyes or of the Ears And I conceive no Absurdity in all this  ALC  I see therefore in strict Philosophical Truth that Rock only in the same Sense that I may be said to hear it when the Word  Rock  is pronounced  EUPH  In the very same  ALC  How comes it to pass then that every one shall say he sees for Instance a Rock or a House when those things are before his Eyes but no body will say he hears a Rock or a House but only the words or sounds themselves by which those things are said to be signified or suggested but not heard Besides if Vision be only a Language speaking to the Eyes it may be asked When did  Men learn this Language To acquire the knowledge of so many Signs as go to the making up a Language is a work of some difficulty But will any Man say he hath spent time or been at pains to learn this Language of Vision  EUPH  No wonder we cannot assign a time beyond our remotest Memory If we have been all practising this Language ever since our first entrance into the World If the Author of Nature constantly speaks to the Eyes of all Mankind even in their earliest Infancy whenever the Eyes are open in the Light whether alone or in Company It doth not seem to me at all strange that Men shou'd not be aware they had ever learned a Language begun so early and practised so constantly as this of Vision And if we also consider that it is the same throughout the whole World and not like other Languages differing in different places it will not seem unaccountable that Men shou'd mistake the Connexion between the proper Objects of Sight and the things signified by them to be founded in necessary Relation or Likeness or that they shou'd even take them for the same things Hence it seems easy to conceive why Men who do not think shou'd confound in this Language of Vision the Signs with the things signified otherwise than they are wont to do in the various particular Languages formed by the several Nations of Men  XII  It may be also worth while to observe that Signs being little considered in themselves or for their own sake but only in their relative Capacity and for the sake of those things whereof they are Signs it comes to pass that the mind often overlooks them so as to carry its Attention immediately on to the things signified Thus for example in reading we run over the Characters with the slightest regard and pass on to the meaning Hence it is frequent for Men to say they see Words and Notions and Things in reading of a Book whereas in strictness  they see only the Characters which suggest Words Nations and Things And by parity of Reason may we not suppose that Men not resting in but overlooking the immediate and proper Objects of Sight as in their own Nature of small moment carry their Attention onward to the very things signified and talk as if they saw the secondary Objects which in truth and strictness are not seen but only suggested and apprehended by means of the proper Objects of Sight which alone are seen  ALC  To speak my mind freely this Dissertation grows tedious and runs into points too dry and minute for a Gentleman's Attention I thought said  Crito  we had been told the Minute Philosophers loved to consider things closely and minutely  ALC  That is true but in so polite an Age who wou'd be a meer Philosopher There is a certain scholastic Accuracy which ill suits the freedom and case of a wellbred Man But to cut short this Chicane I propound it fairly to your own Conscience whether you really think that God himself speaks every day and in every place to the Eyes of all Men  EUPH  That is really and in truth my Opinion and it shou'd be yours too if you are consistent with your self and abide by your own Definition of Language Since you cannot deny that the Great Mover and Author of Nature constantly explaineth himself to the Eyes of Men by the sensible intervention of arbitrary Signs which have no Similitude or Connexion with the things signified so as by compounding and disposing them to suggest and exhibit an endless variety of Objects differing in nature time and place thereby informing and directing Men how to act with respect to things distant and future as well as near and present In consequence I say of your own Sentiments and Concessions you have as much reason to think the universal Agent or God speaks to your Eyes as you can have for thinking any particular Person speaks to your Ears  ALC  I cannot help thinking that some  Fallacy runs throughout this whole Ratiocination though perhaps I may not readily point it out Hold let me see In Language the Signs are arbitrary are they not  EUPH  They are  ALC  And consequently they do not always suggest real matters of Fact Whereas this natural Language as you call it or these visible Signs do always suggest things in the same uniform way and have the same constant regular Connexion with matters of Fact whence it shou'd seem the Connexion was necessary and therefore according to the Definition premised it can be no Language How do you solve this Objection  EUPH  You may solve it your self by the help of a Picture or Lookingglass  ALC  You are in the right I see there is nothing in it I know not what else to say to this Opinion more than that it is so odd and contrary to my way of thinking that I shall never assent to it  XIII  EUPH  Be pleased to recollect your own Lectures upon Prejudice and apply them in the present case Perhaps they may help you to follow where Reason leads and to suspect Notions which are strongly riveted without having been ever examined  ALC  I disdain the suspicion of Prejudice And I do not speak only for my self I know a Club of most ingenious Men the freest from Prejudice of any Men alive who abhor the Notion of a God and I doubt not wou'd be very able to untie this knot Upon which Words of  Alciphron  I who had acted the part of an indifferent standerby observed to him that it misbecame his Character and repeated Professions to own an Attachment to the Judgment or build upon the presumed Abilities of other Men how ingenious soever and that this proceeding might encourage his Adversaries to have recourse to Authority in which perhaps they wou'd find their account more than he Oh said  Crito  I have often observed the Conduct of Minute Philosophers When one  of them has got a ring of Disciples round him his method is to exclaim against Prejudice and recommend thinking and reasoning giving to understand that himself is a Man of deep Researches and close Argument one who examines impartially and concludes warily The same Man in other Company if he chance to be pressed with Reason shall laugh at Logic and assume the lazy supine Airs of a fine Gentleman a Wit a Railleur to avoid the dryness of a regular and exact Inquiry This double Face of the Minute Philosopher is of no small use to propagate and maintain his Notions Though to me it seems a plain Case that if a fine Gentleman will shake off Authority and appeal from Religion to Reason unto Reason he must go And if he cannot go without leading strings surely he had better be led by the Authority of the Public than by that of any knot of Minute Philosophers  ALC  Gentlemen this Discourse is very irksome and needless For my part I am a friend to Inquiry I am willing Reason shou'd have its full and free Scope I build on no Man's Authority For my part I have no interest in denying a God Any Man may believe or not believe a God as he pleases for me But after all  Euphranor  must allow me to stare a little at his Conclusions  EUPH  The Conclusions are yours as much as mine for you were led to them by your own Concessions  XIV  You it seems stare to find that God is not far from every one of us and that in him we live and move and have our Being You who in the beginning of this Morning's Conference thought it strange that God shou'd leave himself without a witness do now think it strange the witness shou'd be so full and clear  ALC  I must own I do I was aware indeed of a certain Metaphysical Hypothesis of our seeing all things in God by the union of the Humane Soul with the intelligible Substance of the Deity which neither I nor any one else cou'd  make sense of But I never imagined it cou'd be pretended that we saw God with our fleshly Eyes as plain as we see any Human Person whatsoever and that he daily speaks to our Senses in a manifest and clear Dialect  CRI  This Language hath a necessary Connexion with Knowledge Wisdom and Goodness It is equivalent to a constant Creation betokening an immediate act of Power and Providence It cannot be accounted for by mechanical Principles by Atoms Attractions or Effluvia The instantaneous Production and Reproduction of so many Signs combined dissolved transposed diversified and adapted to such an endless variety of purposes ever shifting with the occasions and suited to them being utterly inexplicable and unaccountable by the Laws of Motion by Chance by Fate or the like blind Principles doth set forth and testify the immediate Operation of a Spirit or thinking Being and not meerly of a Spirit which every Motion or Gravitation may possibly infer but of one wise good and provident Spirit who directs and rules and governs the World Some Philosophers being convinced of the Wisdom and Power of the Creator from the make and contrivance of organized Bodies and orderly System of the World did nevertheless imagine that he left this System with all its parts and contents well adjusted and put in motion as an Artist leaves a Clock to go thenceforward of it self for a certain Period But this visual Language proves not a Creator meerly but a provident Governor actually and intimately present and attentive to all our Interests and Motions who watches over our Conduct and takes care of our minutest Actions and Designs throughout the whole course of our lives informing admonishing and directing incessantly in a most evident evident and sensible manner This is truly wonderful  EUPH  And is it not so that Men shou'd be encompassed by such a wonder without reflecting on it  XV  Something there is of Divine and Admirable in this Language addressed to our Eyes that may well a waken the Mind and deserve its utmost Attention it is learned with so little pains it expresseth the Differences of Things so clearly and aptly it instructs with such Facility and Dispatch by one Glance of the Eye conveying a greater Variety of Advices and a more distinct Knowledge of Things than cou'd be got by a Discourse of several Hours And while it informs it amuses and entertains the Mind with such singular Pleasure and Delight It is of such excellent Use in giving a Stability and Permanency to Humane Discourse in recording Sounds and bestowing Life on dead Languages enabling us to converse with Men of remote Ages and Countries And it answers so apposite to the Uses and Necessities of Mankind informing us more distinctly of those Objects whose Nearness and Magnitude qualify them to be of greatest Detriment or Benefit to our Bodies and less exactly in Proportion as their Littleness or Distance make them of less Concern to us  ALC  And yet these strange Things affect Men but little  EUPH  But they are not strange they are familiar and that makes them be overlooked Things which rarely happen strike whereas Frequency lessens the Admiration of Things though in themselves ever so admirable Hence a common Man who is not used to think and make Reflexions wou'd probably be more convinced of the Being of a God by one single Sentence heard once in his life from the Sky than by all the Experience he has had of this visual Language contrived with such exquisite skill so constantly addressed to his Eyes and so plainly declaring the Nearness Wisdom and Providence of him with whom we have to do  ALC  After all I cannot satisfy my self how Men shou'd be so little surprised or amazed about this visive Faculty if it was really of a nature so surprising and amazing  EUPH  But  let us suppose a Nation of Men blind from their Infancy among whom a Stranger arrives the only Man who can see in all the Country Let us suppose this Stranger travelling with some of the Natives and that one while he foretels to them that in case they walk straight forward in half an Hour they shall meet Men or Cattle or come to a House that if they turn to the right and proceed they shall in a few Minutes be in danger of falling down a Precipice that shaping their course to the left they will in such a time arrive at a River a Wood or a Mountain What think you Must they not be infinitely surprised that one who had never been in their Country before shou'd know it so much better than themselves And wou'd not those Predictions seem to them as unaccountable and incredible as Prophecy to a Minute Philosopher  ALC  I cannot deny it  EUPH  But it seems to require intense thought to be able to unravel a Prejudice that has been so long forming to get over the vulgar Error of Ideas common to both Senses and so to distinguish between the Objects of Sight and Touch  See the annexed Treatise wherein this Point and the whole Theory of Vision are more fully explained  which have grown if I may so say blended together in our Fancy as to be able to suppose our selves exactly in the State that one of those Men wou'd be in if he were made to see And yet this I believe is possible and might seem worth the pains of a little thinking especially to those Men whose proper Employment and Profession it is to think and unravel Prejudices and confute Mistakes I frankly own I cannot find my way out of this Maze and shou'd gladly be set right by those who see better than my self  CRI  The pursuing this Subject in their own Thoughts wou'd possibly open a new Scene to those speculative Gentlemen of  the Minute Philosophy It puts me in mind of a passage in the Psalmist where he represents God to be covered with Light as with a Garment and wou'd methinks be no ill Comment on that ancient Notion of some Eastern Sages That God had Light for his Body and Truth for his Soul This Conversation lasted till a Servant came to tell us the Tea was ready Upon which we walked in and found  Lysicles  at the Teatable  XVI  As soon as we fate down I am glad said  Alciphron  that I have here found my Second a fresh Man to maintain our common Cause which I doubt  Lysicles  will think hath suffered by his absence  LYS  Why so  ALC  I have been drawn into some Concessions you won't like  LYS  Let me know what they are  ALC  Why that there is such a thing as a God and that his Existence is very certain  LYS  Bless me How came you to entertain so wild a Notion  ALC  You know we profess to follow Reason wherever it leads And in short I have been reasoned into it  LYS  Reasoned You shou'd say amused with Words bewildered with Sophistry  EUPH  Have you a mind to hear the same Reasoning that led  Alciphron  and me Step by Step that we may examine whether it be Sophistry or no  LYS  As to that I am very easy I guess all that can be said on that Head It shall be my Business to help my Friend out whatever Arguments drew him in  EUPH  Will you admit the Premises and deny the Conclusions  LYS  What if I admit the Conclusion  EUPH  How will you grant there is a God  LYS  Perhaps I may  EUPH  Then we are agreed  LYS  Perhaps not  EUPH  O  Lysicles  you are a subtle Adversary I know not what you wou'd be at  LYS  You must know then that at bottom the Being of a God is a Point in it self of small consequence and a Man may make this Concession without yielding much The great Point  is what Sense the word God is to be taken in The very  Epicureans  allowed the Being of Gods but then they were indolent Gods unconcerned with Human Affairs  Hobbes  allowed a corporeal God and  Spinosa  held the Universe to be God And yet no body doubts they were staunch Freethinkers I cou'd wish indeed the word God were quite omitted because in most minds it is coupled with a sort of superstitious Aw the very Root of all Religion I shall not nevertheless be much disturbed though the name be retained and the Being of God allowed in any Sense but in that of a Mind which knows all things and beholds Human Actions like some Judge or Magistrate with infinite Observation and Intelligence The Belief of a God in this Sense fills a Man's Mind with Scruples lays him under Constraints and imbitters his very Being But in another Sense it may be attended with no great ill Consequence This I know was the Opinion of our great  Diagoras  who told me he wou'd never have been at the pains to find out a Demonstration that there was no God if the received Notion of God had been the same with that of some Fathers and Schoolmen  EUPH  Pray what was that  XVII  LYS  You must know  Diagoras  a Man of much reading and inquiry had discovered that once upon a time the most profound and speculative Divines finding it impossible to reconcile the Attributes of God taken in the common Sense or in any known Sense with Human Reason and the Appearances of things taught that the words Knowledge Wisdom Goodness and such like when spoken of the Deity must be understood in a quite different Sense from what they signify in the vulgar Acceptation or from any thing that we can form a Notion of or conceive Hence whatever Objections might be made against the Attributes of God they easily  solved by denying those Attributes belonged to God in this or that or any known particular Sense or Notion which was the same thing as to deny they belonged to him at all And thus denying the Attributes of God they in effect deny'd his Being though perhaps they were not aware of it Suppose for instance a Man shou'd object that future Contingencies were inconsistent with the Foreknowledge of God because it is repugnant that certain Knowledge shou'd be of an uncertain thing it was a ready and an easy answer to say that this may be true with respect to Knowledge taken in the common Sense or in any Sense that we can possibly form any Notion of but that there wou'd not appear the same Inconsistency between the contingent Nature of Things and Divine Foreknowledge taken to signify somewhat that we know nothing of which in God supplies the place of what we understand by Knowledge from which it differs not in Quantity or Degree of Perfection but altogether and in kind as Light doth from Sound and even more since these agree in that they are both Sensations whereas Knowledge in God hath no sort of Resemblance or Agreement with any Notion that Man can frame of Knowledge The like may be said of all the other Attributes which indeed may by this means be equally reconciled with every thing or with nothing But all Men who think must needs see this is cutting knots and not untying them For how are things reconciled with the Divine Attributes when these Attributes themselves are in every intelligible Sense denied and consequently the very Notion of God taken away and nothing left but the Name without any meaning annexed to it In short the Belief that there is an unknown Subject of Attributes absolutely unknown is a very innocent Doctrine which the acute  Diagoras  well saw and was therefore wonderfully delighted with this System  XVIII  For said he if this cou'd once make its way and obtain in the World there wou'd be an end of all natural or rational Religion which is the Basis both of the Jewish and the Christian for he who comes to God or enters himself in the Church of God must first believe that there is a God in some intelligible Sense and not only that there is something in general without any proper Notion though never so inadequate of any of its Qualities or Attributes for this may be Fate or Chaos or Plastic Nature or any thing else as well as God Nor will it avail to say there is something in this unknown Being analogous to Knowledge and Goodness that is to say which produceth those Effects which we cou'd not conceive to be produced by Men in any Degree without Knowledge and Goodness For this is in Fact to give up the Point in dispute between Theists and Atheists the Question having always been not whether there was a Principle which Point was allowed by all Philosophers as well before as since  Anaxagoras  but whether this Principle was a  a thinking intelligent Being That is to say whether that Order and Beauty and Use visible in Natural Effects cou'd be produced by any thing but a Mind or Intelligence in the proper Sense of the Word and whether there must not be true real and proper Knowledge in the first Cause We will therefore acknowledge that all those natural Effects which are vulgarly ascribed to Knowledge and Wisdom proceed from a Being in which there is properly speaking no Knowledge or Wisdom at all but only something else which in reality is the Cause of those things which Men for want of knowing better ascribe to what they call Knowledge and Wisdom and Understanding You wonder perhaps to hear a Man of Pleasure who diverts himself as I do philosophize at this rate But you shou'd consider that much is to be got by conversing with ingenious  Men which is a short way to Knowledge that saves a Man the drudgery of Reading and Thinking And now we have granted to you that there is a God in this indefinite Sense I wou'd fain see what use you can make of this Concession You cannot argue from unknown Attributes or which is the same thing from Attributes in an unknown Sense You cannot prove that God is to be loved for his Goodness or feared for his Justice or respected for his Knowledge All which Consequences we own wou'd follow from those Attributes admitted in an intelligible Sense But we deny that those or any other Consequences can be drawn from Attributes admitted in no particular Sense or in a Sense which none of us understand Since therefore nothing can be inferred from such an Account of God about Conscience or Worship or Religion you may e'en make the best of it and not to be singular we will use the Name too and so at once there is an end of Atheism  EUPH  This Account of a Deity is new to me I do not like it and therefore shall leave it to be maintain'd by those who do  XIX  CRI  It is not new to me I remember not long since to have heard a Minute Philosopher triumph upon this very Point which put me on inquiring what Foundation there was for it in the Fathers or Schoolmen And for ought that I can find it owes its Original to those Writings which have been published under the Name of  Dionysius the Areopagite  The Author of which it must be owned hath written upon the Divine Attributes in a very singular Style In his Treatise of the Coelestial Hierarchy  De Hierarch Coelest c  he saith that God is something above all Essence and Life  and again in his Treatise of the Divine Names  De Nom Div c  that he is above  all Wisdom and Understanding  ineffable and innominable  the Wisdom of God he terms an unreasonable unintelligent and foolish Wisdom  But then the Reason he gives for expressing himself in this strange manner is that the Divine Wisdom is the Cause of all Reason Wisdom and Understanding and therein are contained the Treasures of all Wisdom and Knowledge He calls God  and  as if Wisdom and Life were Words not worthy to express the Divine Perfections And he adds that the Attributes unintelligent and unperceiving must be ascribed to the Divinity not  by way of Defect but  by way of Eminency which he explains by our giving the Name of Darkness to Light inaccessible And notwithstanding the Harshness of his Expressions in some Places he affirms over and over in others that God knows all Things not that he is beholden to the Creatures for his Knowledge but by knowing himself from whom they all derive their Being and in whom they are contained as in their Cause It was late before these Writings appear to have been known in the World and although they obtained Credit during the Age of the Schoolmen yet since critical Learning hath been cultivated they have lost that Credit and are at this Day given up for spurious as containing several evident Marks of a much later Date than the Age of  Dionysius  Upon the whole although this Method of growing in Expression and dwindling in Notion of clearing up Doubts by Nonsense and avoiding Difficulties by running into affected Contradictions may perhaps proceed from a wellmeant Zeal yet it appears not to be according to Knowledge and instead of reconciling Atheists to the Truth hath I doubt a Tendency to confirm them in their own Persuasion It shou'd seem therefore very weak and rash in a Christian to adopt this harsh Language of an Apocryphal Writer preferably to that of the  Holy Scriptures I remember indeed to have read of a certain Philosopher who lived some Centuries ago that used to say if these supposed Works of  Dionysius  had been known to the Primitive Fathers they wou'd have furnished them admirable Weapons against the Hereticks and wou'd have saved a world of Pains But the Event since their Discovery hath by no means confirmed his Opinion It must be owned the celebrated  Picus  of  Mirandula  among his Nine Hundred Conclusions which that Prince being very young proposed to maintain by public Disputation at  Rome  hath this for one to wit that it is more improper to say of God he is an Intellect or intelligent Being than to say of a reasonable Soul that it is an Angel Which Doctrine it seems was not relished And  Picus  when he comes to defend it supports himself altogether by the Example and Authority of  Dionysius  and in effect explains it away into a meer verbal Difference affirming that neither  Dionysius  nor himself ever meant to deprive God of Knowledge or to deny that he knows all Things But that as Reason is of kind peculiar to Man so by Intellection he understands a kind or manner of Knowing peculiar to Angels And that the Knowledge which is in God is more above the Intellection of Angels than Angel is above Man He adds that as his Tenet consists with admitting the most perfect Knowledge in God so he wou'd by no means be understood to exclude from the Deity Intellection it self taken in the common or general Sense but only that peculiar sort of Intellection proper to Angels which he thinks ought not to be attributed to God any more than Human Reason  Pic Mirand in Apolog p Ed Bas    Picus  therefore though he speaks as the Apocryphal  Dionysius  yet when he explains himself it is evident he speaks like other Men And although the forementioned  Books of the Coelestial Hierarchy and of the Divine Names being attributed to a Saint and Martyr of the Apostolical Age were respected by the Schoolmen yet it is certain they rejected or softned his harsh Expressions and explained away or reduced his Doctrine to the received Notions taken from Holy Scripture and the Light of Nature  XX  Thomas Aquinas  expresseth his Sense of this Point in the following manner All Perfections saith he derived from God to the Creatures are in a certain higher Sense or as the Schoolmen term it eminently in God Whenever therefore a Name borrowed from any Perfection in the Creature is attributed to God we must exclude from its Signification every thing that belongs to the imperfect Manner wherein that Attribute is found in the Creature Whence he concludes that Knowledge in God is not an Habit but a pure Act  Sum Theolog p Quest Art  And again the same Doctor observes that our Intellect gets its Notions of all sorts of Perfections from the Creatures and that as it apprehends those Perfections so it signifies them by Names Therefore saith he in attributing these Names to God we are to consider two Things first The Perfections themselves as Goodness Life and the like which are properly in God and secondly The Manner which is peculiar to the Creature and cannot strictly and properly speaking be said to agree to the Creator  Ibid Quest Art  And although  Suarez  with other Schoolmen teacheth that the Mind of Man conceiveth Knowledge and Will to be in God as Faculties or Operations by Analogy only to created Beings yet he gives it plainly as his Opinion that when Knowledge is said not to be properly in God it must be understood in a Sense including  Imperfection such as discursive Knowledge or the like imperfect kind found in the Creatures And that none of those Imperfections in the Knowledge of Men or Angels belonging to the formal Notion of Knowledge or to Knowledge as such it will not thence follow that Knowledge in its proper formal Sense may not be attributed to God And of Knowledge taken in general for the clear evident understanding of all Truth he expresly affirms that it is in God and that this was never denied by any Philosopher who believed a God  Suarez Disp Metaph Tom Disp Sect  It was indeed a current Opinion in the Schools that even Being itself shou'd be attributed analogically to God and the Creatures That is they held that God the supreme independent selforiginate Cause and Source of all Beings must not be supposed to exist in the same Sense with created Beings not that he exists less truly properly or formally than they but only because he exists in a more eminent and perfect Manner  XXI  But to prevent any Man's being led by mistaking the Scholastic Use of the Terms  Analogy  and  Analogical  into an Opinion that we cannot frame in any Degree a true and proper Notion of Attributes applied by Analogy or in the School Phrase predicated analogically it may not be amiss to inquire into the true Sense and Meaning of those Words Every one knows that Analogy is a  Greek  Word used by Mathematicians to signify a Similitude of Proportions For Instance when we observe that Two is to Six as Three is to Nine this Similitude or Equality of Proportion is termed Analogy And although Proportion strictly signifies the Habitude or Relation of one Quantity to another yet in a looser and translated Sense it hath been applied to signify every other Habitude and consequently the Term Analogy comes to signify all Similitude of Relations  or Habitudes whatsoever Hence the Schoolmen tell us there is Analogy between Intellect and Sight forasmuch as Intellect is to the Mind what Sight is to the Body And that he who governs the State is analogous to him who steers a Ship Hence a Prince is analogically stiled a Pilot being to the State as a Pilot is to his Vessel  Vide Cajetan de Nom Analog c  For the farther clearing of this Point it is to be observed that a twofold Analogy is distinguished by the Schoolmen metaphorical and proper Of the first Kind there are frequent Instances in Holy Scripture attributing Human Parts and Passions to God When he is represented as having a Finger an Eye or an Ear when he is said to repent to be angry or grieved every one sees the Analogy is meerly metaphorical Because those Parts and Passions taken in the proper Signification must in every Degree necessarily and from the formal Nature of the Thing include Imperfection When therefore it is said the Finger of God appears in this or that Event Men of common Sense mean no more but that it is as truly ascribed to God as the Works wrought by Human Fingers are to Man and so of the rest But the case is different when Wisdom and Knowledge are attributed to God Passions and Senses as such imply Defect but in Knowledge simply or as such there is no Defect Knowledge therefore in the proper formal meaning of the Word may be attributed to God proportionably that is preserving a Proportion to the infinite Nature of God We may say therefore that as God is infinitely above Man so is the Knowledge of God infinitely above the Knowledge of Man and this is what  Cajetan  calls  Analogia propriÃ¨ facta  And after this same Analogy we must understand all those Attributes to belong to the Deity which in themselves simply and as such denote Perfection We  may therefore consistently with what hath been premised affirm that all sorts of Perfection which we can conceive in a finite Spirit are in God but without any of that allay which is found in the Creatures This Doctrine therefore of Analogical Perfections in God or our knowing God by Analogy seems very much misunderstood and misapplied by those who wou'd infer from thence that we cannot frame any direct or proper Notion though never so inadequate of Knowledge or Wisdom as they are in the Deity or understand any more of them than one born blind can of Light and Colours  XXII  And now Gentlemen it may be expected I shou'd ask your Pardon for having dwelt so long on a point of Metaphysics and introduced such unpolished and unfashionable Writers as the Schoolmen into good Company but as  Lysicles  gave the occasion I leave him to answer for it  LYS  I never dreamt of this dry Dissertation But if I have been the occasion of discussing these Scholastic Points by my unluckily mentioning the Schoolmen it was my first fault of the kind and I promise it shall be the last The meddling with crabbed Authors of any sort is none of my taste I grant one meets now and then with a good Notion in what we call dry Writers such an one for example as this I was speaking of which I must own struck my Fancy But then for these we have such as  Prodicus  or  Diagoras  who look into obsolete Books and save the rest of us that trouble  CRI  So you pin your Faith upon them  LYS  It is only for some odd Opinions and matters of Fact and critical Points Besides we know the Men to whom we give credit They are judicious and honest and have no end to serve but Truth And I am confident some Author or other has maintained the forementioned Notion in the same Sense as  Diagoras  related it  CRI  That may be But it never was a received Notion and never will so long as  Men believe a God the same Arguments that prove a first Cause proving an intelligent Cause Intelligent I say in the proper Sense Wise and Good in the true and formal Acceptation of the Words Otherwise it is evident that every Syllogism brought to prove those Attributes or which is the same thing to prove the Being of a God will be found to consist of four terms and consequently can conclude nothing But for your part  Alciphron  you have been fully convinced that God is a thinking intelligent Being in the same sense with other Spirits though not in the same imperfect manner or degree  XXIII  ALC  And yet I am not without my Scruples For with Knowledge you infer Wisdom and with Wisdom Goodness But how is it possible to conceive God so good and Man so wicked It may perhaps with some Colour be alledged that a little soft shadowing of Evil sets off the bright and luminous parts of the Creation and so contributes to the Beauty of the whole Piece But for Blots so large and so black it is impossible to account by that Principle That there shou'd be so much Vice and so little Virtue upon Earth and that the Laws of God's Kingdom shou'd be so ill observed by his Subjects is what can never be reconciled with that surpassing Wisdom and Goodness of the supreme Monarch  EUPH  Tell me  Alciphron  wou'd you argue that a State was ill administred or judge of the manners of its Citizens by the Disorders committed in the Goal or Dungeon  ALC  I wou'd not  EUPH  And for ought we know this Spot with the few Sinners on it bears no greater Proportion to the Universe of Intelligences than a Dungeon doth to a Kingdom It seems we are led not only by Revelation but by common Sense observing and inferring from the Analogy of visible Things to conclude there are innumerable Orders of intelligent Beings more happy and more perfect than Man  whose Life is but a Span and whose place this earthly Globe is but a Point in respect of the whole System of God's Creation We are dazzled indeed with the Glory and Grandeur of Things here below because we know no better But I am apt to think if we knew what it was to be an Angel for one hour we shou'd return to this World though it were to sit on the brightest Throne in it with vastly more loathing and reluctance than we wou'd now descend into a loathsome Dungeon or Sepulchre  XXIV  CRI  To me it seems natural that such a weak passionate and shortsighted Creature as Man shou'd be ever liable to Scruples of one kind or other But as this same Creature is apt to be over positive in judging and over hasty in concluding it falls out that these Difficulties and Scruples about God's Conduct are made Objections to his Being And so Men come to argue from their own Defects against the Divine Perfections And as the Views and Humours of Men are different and often opposite you may sometimes see them deduce the same atheistical Conclusion from contrary Premises I knew an Instance of this in two Minute Philosophers of my Acquaintance who used to argue each from his own Temper against a Providence One of them a Man of a choleric and vindictive Spirit said he cou'd not believe a Providence because  London  was not swallowed up or consumed by Fire from Heaven the Streets being as he said full of People who shew no other Belief or Worship of God but perpetually praying that he wou'd damn rot sink and confound them The other being of an indolent and easy Temper concluded there cou'd be no such thing as a Providence for that a Being of consummate Wisdom must needs employ himself better than in minding the Prayers and Actions and little Interests of Mankind  ALC  After all if God have no Passions how can it be true that Vengeance is his Or  how can he be said to be jealous of his Glory  CRI  We believe that God executes Vengeance without Revenge and is jealous without Weakness just as the mind of Man sees without Eyes and apprehends without Hands  XXV  ALC  To put a Period to this Discourse we will grant there is a God in this dispassionate Sense but what then What hath this to do with Religion or Divine Worship To what purpose are all these Prayers and Praises and Thanksgivings and Singing of Psalms which the foolish Vulgar call serving God What sense or use or end is there in all these things  CRI  We worship God we praise and pray to him not because we think that he is proud of our Worship or fond of our Praise or Prayers and affected with them as Mankind are or that all our Service can contribute in the least Degree to his Happiness or Good But because it is good for us to be so disposed towards God because it is just and right and suitable to the Nature of Things and becoming the Relation we stand in to our supreme Lord and Governor  ALC  If it be good for us to worship God it shou'd seem that the Christian Religion which pretends to teach Men the Knowledge and Worship of God was of some use and benefit to Mankind  CRI  Doubtless  ALC  If this can be made appear I shall own my self very much mistaken  CRI  It is now near Dinner time Wherefore if you please we will put an end to this Conversation for the present and tomorrow morning resume our Subject  The FIFTH DIALOGUE  I  Minute

ourselves next Day every one to his Fancy till Nine of the Clock when Word was brought that the Teatable was set in the Library which is a Gallery on a Groundfloor with an arched Door at one End opening into a Walk of Limes where as soon as we had drank Tea we were tempted by fine Weather to take a Walk which led us to a small Mount of easy Ascent on the Top whereof we found a Seat under a spreading Tree Here we had a Prospect on one hand of a narrow Bay or Creek of the Sea inclosed on either Side by a Coast beautified with Rocks and Woods and green Banks and Farmhouses At the End of the Bay was a small Town placed upon the Slope of a Hill which from the Advantage of its Situation made a considerable Figure Several Fishingboats and Lighters gliding up and down on a Surface as smooth and bright as Glass enlivened the Prospect On the other Side we looked down on green Pastures Flocks and Herds basking beneath in Sunshine while we in our superior Situation enjoy'd the Freshness of Air and Shade Here we felt that sort of joyful Instinct which a rural Scene and fine Weather inspire and proposed no small Pleasure in resuming and continuing our Conference without Interruption till Dinner But we had hardly seated ourselves and looked about us when we saw a Fox run by the Foot of our Mount into an adjacent Thicket A few Minutes after we heard a confused Noise of the opening of Hounds the winding of Horns and the roaring of Country Squires While our Attention was suspended by this  Event a Servant came running out of Breath and told  Crito  that his Neighbour  Ctesippus  a Squire of Note was fallen from his Horse attempting to leap over a Hedge and brought into the Hall where he lay for dead Upon which we all rose and walked hastily to the House where we found  Ctesippus  just come to himself in the midst of half a dozen Sunburnt Squires in Frocks and short Wigs and JockeyBoots Being asked how he did he answered it was only a broken Rib With some Difficulty  Crito  persuaded him to lie on a Bed till the Chirurgeon came These Foxhunters having been up early at their Sport were eager for Dinner which was accordingly hastened They passed the Afternoon in a loud rustic Mirth gave Proof of their Religion and Loyalty by the Healths they drank talked of Hounds and Horses and Elections and Country Affairs till the Chirurgeon who had been employed about  Ctesippus  desired he might be put into  Crito  's Coach and sent home having refused to stay all Night Our Guests being gone we reposed ourselves after the Fatigue of this tumultuous Visit and next Morning assembled again at the Seat on the Mount Now  Lysicles  being a nice Man and a  bel esprit  had an infinite Contempt for the rough Manners and Conversation of Foxhunters and cou'd not reflect with Patience that he had lost as he called it so many Hours in their Company I flattered myself said he that there had been none of this Species remaining among us Strange that Men shou'd be diverted with such uncouth Noise and Hurry or find Pleasure in the Society of Dogs and Horses How much more elegant are the Diversions of the Town There seems replied  Euphranor  to be some Resemblance between Foxhunters and Freethinkers the former exerting their animal Faculties in pursuit of Game as you Gentlemen employ your Intellectuals in the pursuit of Truth The kind of Amusement is the same although  the Object be different  LYS  I had rather be compared to any Brute upon Earth than a rational Brute  CRI  You wou'd then have been less displeased with my Friend  Pythocles  whom I have heard compare the common sort of Minute Philosophers not to the Hunters but the Hounds For said he you shall often see among the Dogs a loud Babler with a bad Nose lead the unskilful part of the Pack who join all in his Cry without following any Scent of their own any more than the Herd of Freethinkers follow their own Reason  II  But  Pythocles  was a blunt Man and must never have known such Reasoners among them as you Gentlemen who can sit so long at an Argument dispute every Inch of Ground and yet know when to make a reasonable Concession  LYS  I don't know how it comes to pass but methinks  Alciphron  makes Concessions for himself and me too For my own part I am not altogether of such a yielding Temper But yet I don't care to be singular neither  CRI  Truly  Alciphron  when I consider where we are got and how far we are agreed I conceive it probable we may agree altogether in the end You have granted that a Life of Virtue is upon all Accounts eligible as most conducive both to the general and particular Good of Mankind And you allow that the Beauty of Virtue alone is not a sufficient Motive with Mankind to the Practice of it This led you to acknowledge that the Belief of a God wou'd be very useful in the World and that consequently you shou'd be disposed to admit any reasonable Proof of his Being Which Point hath been proved and you have admitted the Proof If then we admit a Divinity why not Divine Worship And if Worship why not Religion to teach this Worship And if a Religion why not the Christian if a better cannot be assigned and it be already established by the Laws of our Country and handed  down to us from our Forefathers Shall we believe a God and not pray to him for future Benefits nor thank him for the past Neither trust in his Protection nor love his Goodness nor praise his Wisdom nor adore his Power And if these Things are to be done can we do them in a Way more suitable to the Dignity of God or Man than is prescribed by the Christian Religion  ALC  I am not perhaps altogether sure that Religion must be absolutely bad for the Public But I cannot bear to see Policy and Religion walk hand in hand I do not like to see Human Rights attached to the Divine I am for no  Pontifex Maximus  such as in ancient or in modern  Rome  No High Priest as in  Judaea  No Royal Priests as in  Aegypt  and  Sparta  No such Things as  Dairos  of  Japan  or  Lamas  of  Tartary  III  I knew a late witty Gentleman of our Sect who was a great Admirer of the ancient  Druids  He had a mortal Antipathy to the present established Religion but used to say he shou'd like well to see the  Druids  and their Religion restored as it anciently flourished in  Gaul  and  Britain  for it wou'd be right enough that there shou'd be a Number of contemplative Men set apart to preserve a Knowledge of Arts and Sciences to educate Youth and teach Men the Immortality of the Soul and the moral Virtues Such said he were the  Druids  of old and I shou'd be glad to see them once more established among us  CRI  How wou'd you like  Alciphron  that Priests shou'd have Power to decide all Controversies adjudge Property distribute Rewards and Punishments that all who did not acquiesce in their Decrees shou'd be excommunicated held in Abhorrence excluded from all Honours and Privileges and deprived of the common Benefit of the Laws and that now and then a Number of Laymen shou'd be crammed together in a Wickeridol and burnt for an Offering to their Pagan Gods How shou'd you like living under such  Priests and such a Religion  ALC  Not at all Such a Situation wou'd by no means agree with Freethinkers  CRI  And yet such were the  Druids  and such their Religion if we may trust  Caesar  's Account of them  De Bello Gallico    LYS  I am now convinced more than ever there ought to be no such Thing as an established Religion of any kind Certainly all the Nations of the World have been hitherto out of their Wits Even the  Athenians  themselves the wisest and freest People upon Earth had I know not what foolish Attachment to their established Church They offered it seems a Talent as a Reward to whoever shou'd kill  Diagoras  the  Melian  a Freethinker of those Times who derided their Mysteries And  Protagoras  another of the same Turn narrowly escaped being put to Death for having wrote something that seemed to contradict their received Notions of the Gods Such was the Treatment our generous Sect met with at  Athens  And I make no doubt but these  Druids  wou'd have sacrificed many a Holocaust of Freethinkers I wou'd not give a single Farthing to exchange one Religion for another Away with all together Root and Branch or you had as good do nothing No  Druids  or Priests of any sort for me I see no occasion for any of them  IV  EUPH  What  Lysicles  saith puts me in mind of the Close of our last Conference wherein it was agreed in the following to resume the Point we were then entered upon to wit the Use or Benefit of the Christian Religion which  Alciphron  expected  Crito  shou'd make appear  CRI  I am the readier to undertake this Point because I conceive it to be no difficult one and that one great Mark of the Truth of Christianity is in my mind its Tendency to do good which seems the North Star to conduct our Judgment  in moral Matters and in all Things of a practic Nature Moral or practical Truths being ever connected with universal Benefit But to judge rightly of this Matter we shou'd endeavour to act like  Lysicles  upon another Occasion taking into our View the Sum of Things and considering Principles as branched forth into Consequences to the utmost Extent we are able We are not so much to regard the Humour or Caprice or imaginary Distresses of a few idle Men whose Conceit may be offended though their Conscience cannot be wounded but fairly to consider the true Interest of Individuals as well as of Human Society Now the Christian Religion considered as a Fountain of Light and Joy and Peace as a Source of Faith and Hope and Charity and that it is so will be evident to whoever takes his Notion of it from the Gospel must needs be a Principle of Happiness and Virtue And he who sees not that the destroying the Principles of good Actions must destroy good Actions sees nothing And he who seeing this shall yet persist to do it if he be not wicked who is  V  To me it seems the Man can see neither deep nor far who is not sensible of his own Misery Sinfulness and Dependence who doth not perceive that this present World is not designed or adapted to make rational Souls happy who wou'd not be glad of getting into a better State and who wou'd not be overjoy'd to find that the Road leading thither was the Love of God and Man the practising every Virtue the living reasonably while we are here upon Earth proportioning our Esteem to the Value of Things and so using this World as not to abuse it for this is what Christianity requires It neither injoyns the Nastiness of the Cynic nor the Insensibility of the Stoic Can there be a higher Ambition than to overcome the World or a wiser than to subdue our selves or a more comfortable Doctrine than  the Remission of Sins or a more joyful Prospect than that of having our base Nature renewed and assimilated to the Deity our being made Fellowcitizens with Angels and Sons of God Did ever  Pythagoreans  or  Platonists  or Stoics even in Idea or in Wish propose to the Mind of Man purer Means or a nobler End How great a Share of our Happiness depends upon Hope How totally is this extinguished by the Minute Philosophy On the other hand how is it cherished and raised by the Gospel Let any Man who thinks in earnest but consider these Things and then say which he thinks deserveth best of Mankind he who recommends or he who runs down Christianity Which he thinks likelier to lead a happy Life to be a hopeful Son an honest Dealer a worthy Patriot He who sincerely believes the Gospel or He who believes not one Title of it He who aims at being a Child of God or He who is contented to be thought and to be one of  Epicurus  's Hogs And in fact do but scan the Characters and observe the Behaviour of the common sort of Men on both sides Observe and say which live most agreeably to the Dictates of Reason How Things shou'd be the Reason is plain how they are I appeal to Fact  VI  ALC  It is wonderful to observe how Things change Appearance as they are viewed in different Lights or by different Eyes The Picture  Crito  that I form of Religion is very unlike yours when I consider how it unmans the Soul filling it with absurd Reveries and slavish Fears how it extinguishes the gentle Passions inspiring a Spirit of Malice and Rage and Persecution When I behold bitter Resentments and unholy Wrath in those very Men who preach up Meekness and Charity to others  CRI  It is very possible that Gentlemen of your Sect may think Religion a Subject beneath their Attention but yet it seems that whoever lets up for opposing any Doctrine shou'd know what it is he disputes against  Know then that Religion is the virtuous Mean between Incredulity and Superstition We do not therefore contend for superstitious Follies or for the Rage of Bigots What we plead for is Religion against Profaneness Law against Confusion Virtue against Vice the Hope of a Christian against the Despondency of an Atheist I will not justify bitter Resentments and unholy Wrath in any Man much less in a Christian and least of all in a Clergyman But if Sallies of Human Passion shou'd sometimes appear even in the best it will not surprise any one who reflects on the Sarcasms and ill Manners with which they are treated by the Minute Philosophers For as  Cicero  somewhere observes  Habet quendam aculeum Contumelia quem pati prudentes ac viri boni difficillimÃ¨ possunt  But although you might sometimes observe particular Persons professing themselves Christians run into faulty Extremes of any kind through Passion and Infirmity while Infidels of a more calm and dispassionate Temper shall perhaps behave better Yet these natural Tendencies on either side prove nothing either in favour of Infidel Principles or against Christian If a Believer doth Evil it is owing to the Man not to his Belief And if an Infidel doth good it is owing to the Man and not to his Infidelity  VII  LYS  To cut this Matter short I shall borrow an Allusion to Physic which one of you made use of against our Sect It will not be denied that the Clergy pass for Physicians of the Soul and that Religion is a sort of Medicine which they deal in and administer If then Souls in great numbers are diseased and lost how can we think the Physician skilful or his Physic good It is a common Complaint that Vice increases and Men grow daily more and more wicked If a Shepherd's Flock be diseased or unsound who is to blame but the Shepherd for neglecting or not knowing how to cure them a Fig therefore for such Shepherds such Physic and such  Physicians who like other Mountebanks with great Gravity and elaborate Harangues put off their Pills to the People who are never the better for them  EUPH  Nothing seems more reasonable than this Remark that Men shou'd judge of a Physician and his Physic by its Effect on the Sick But Pray  Lysicles  wou'd you judge of a Physician by those Sick who take his Physic and follow his Prescriptions or by those who do not  LYS  Doubtless by those who do  EUPH  What shall we say then if great numbers refuse to take the Physic or instead of it take Poison of a direct contrary Nature prescribed by others who make it their Business to discredit the Physician and his Medicines to hinder Men from using them and to destroy their Effect by Drugs of their own Shall the Physician be blamed for the miscarriage of those People  LYS  By no means  EUPH  By a parity of Reason shou'd it not follow that the Tendency of religious Doctrines ought to be judged of by the Effects which they produce not upon all who hear them but upon those only who receive or believe them  LYS  It seems so  EUPH  Therefore to proceed fairly shall we not judge of the Effects of Religion by the Religious of Faith by Believers of Christianity by Christians  VIII  LYS  But I doubt these sincere Believers are very few  EUPH  But will it not suffice to justify our Principles if in proportion to the Numbers which receive them and the degree of Faith with which they are received they produce good Effects Perhaps the number of Believers are not so few as you imagine and if they were whose fault is that so much as of those who make it their professed Endeavour to lessen that number And who are those but the Minute Philosophers  LYS  I tell you it is owing to the Clergy themselves to the Wickedness and Corruption of Clergymen  EUPH  And who denies but there may be Minute Philosophers even among  the Clergy  CRI  In so numerous a Body it is to be presumed there are Men of all sorts But notwithstanding the cruel Reproaches cast upon that Order by their Enemies an equal Observer of Men and Things will if I mistake not be inclined to think those Reproaches owing as much to other Faults as those of the Clergy especially if he considers the declamatory manner of those who censure them  EUPH  My Knowledge of the World is too narrow for me to pretend to judge of the Virtue and Merit and liberal Attainments of Men in the several Professions Besides I shou'd not care for the odious work of Comparison But I may venture to say the Clergy of this Country where I live are by no means a disgrace to it on the contrary the People seem much the better for their Example and Doctrine But supposing the Clergy to be what all Men certainly are Sinners and faulty supposing you might spy out here and there among them even great Crimes and Vices what can you conclude against the Profession it self from its unworthy Professors any more than from the Pride Pedantry and bad Lines of some Philosophers against Philosophy or of Lawyers against Law  IX  It is certainly right to judge of Principles from their Effects but then we must know them to be Effects of those Principles It is the very Method I have observed with respect to Religion and the Minute Philosophy And I can honestly aver that I never knew any Man or Family grow worse in proportion as they grew religious But I have often observed that Minute Philosophy is the worst thing which can get into a Family the readiest way to impoverish divide and disgrace it  ALC  By the same Method of tracing Causes from their Effects I have made it my Observation that the Love of Truth Virtue and the Happiness of Mankind are specious Pretexts but not the inward Principles that set Divines  at work Else why shou'd they affect to abuse Human Reason to disparage natural Religion to traduce the Philosophers as they universally do  CRI  Not so universally perhaps as you imagine A Christian indeed is for confining Reason within its due Bounds and so is every reasonable Man If we are forbid meddling with unprofitable Questions vain Philosophy and Science falsly so called it cannot be thence inferred that all Inquiries into profitable Questions useful Philosophy and true Science are unlawful A Minute Philosopher may indeed impute and perhaps a weak Brother may imagine those Inferences but Men of Sense will never make them God is the common Father of Lights and all Knowledge really such whether natural or revealed is derived from the same Source of Light and Truth To amass together Authorities upon so plain a Point wou'd be needless It must be owned some Mens attributing too much to Human Reason hath as is natural made others attribute too little to it But thus much is generally acknowledged that there is a natural Religion which may be discovered and proved by the light of Reason to those who are capable of such Proofs But it must be withal acknowledged that Precepts and Oracles from Heaven are incomparably better suited to popular Improvement and the good of Society than the Reasonings of Philosophers and accordingly we do not find that natural or rational Religion ever became the popular national Religion of any Country  X  ALC  It cannot be denied that in all Heathen Countries there have been received under the colour of Religion a world of Fables and superstitious Rites But I question whether they were so absur'd and of so bad Influence as is vulgarly represented since their respective Legislators and Magistrates must without doubt have thought them useful  CRI  It were needless to inquire into all the Rites and Notions of  the Gentile World This hath been largely done when it was thought necessary And whoever thinks it worth while may be easily satisfied about them But as to the Tendency and Usefulness of the Heathen Religion in general I beg leave to mention a Remark of St  Augustine  's  De civitate Dei l  who observes that the Heathens in their Religion had no Assemblies for preaching wherein the People were to be instructed what Duties or Virtues the Gods required no Place or Means to be taught what  Persius  Sat  exhorts them to learn  Disciteque Ã´ miseri causas cognoscite rerum  Quid sumus quidnam victuri gignimur  ALC  This is the true Spirit of the Party never to allow a Grain of Use or Goodness to any thing out of their own Pale But we have had learned Men who have done Justice to the Religion of the  Gentiles CRI  We do not deny but there was something useful in the old Religions of  Rome  and  Greece  and some other Pagan Countries On the contrary we freely own they produced some good Effects on the People But then these good Effects were owing to the Truths contained in those false Religions the truer therefore the more useful I believe you will find it a hard Matter to produce any useful Truth any moral Precept any salutary Principle or Notion in any Gentile System either of Religion or Philosophy which is not comprehended in the Christian and either enforced by stronger Motives or supported by better Authority or carried to a higher Point of Perfection  XI  Consequently you wou'd have us think our selves a finer People than the ancient  Greeks  or  Romans  CRI  If by finer you mean better perhaps we are and if we are not it is not owing to the Christian Religion but to the want of it  ALC  You say perhaps we are I do not pique my self on my reading But shou'd be very ignorant to be capable of being imposed on in so plain a Point What compare  Cicero  or  Brutus  to an  English  Patriot or  Seneca  to one of our Parsons Then that invincible Constancy and Vigour of Mind that disinterested and noble Virtue that adorable publick Spirit you so much admire are things in them so well known and so different from our Manners that I know not how to excuse your  perhaps Euphranor  indeed who passeth his Life in this obscure Corner may possibly mistake the Characters of our Times but you who know the World how cou'd you be guilty of such a Mistake  CRI  O  Alciphron  I wou'd by no means detract from the noble Virtue of ancient Heroes But I observe those great Men were not the Minute Philosophers of their Times that the best Principles upon which they acted are common to them with Christians of whom it wou'd be no difficult Matter to assign many Instances in every kind of Worth and Virtue publick or private equal to the most celebrated of the Ancients Though perhaps their Story might not have been so well told set off with such fine Lights and colourings of Style or so vulgarly known and considered by every Schoolboy But though it shou'd be granted that here and there a  Greek  or  Roman  Genius bred up under strict Laws and severe Discipline animated to public Virtue by Statues Crowns Triumphal Arches and such Rewards and Monuments of great Actions might attain to a Character and Fame beyond other Men yet this will prove only that they had more Spirit and lived under a civil Polity more wisely ordered in certain points than ours Which advantages of Nature and civil Institution will be no Argument for their Religion or against ours On the contrary it seems an invincible  Proof of the Power and Excellency of the Christian Religion that without the help of those civil Institutions and Incentives to Glory it shou'd be able to inspire a Phlegmatic People with the noblest Sentiments and soften the rugged Manners of Northern Boors into Gentleness and Humanity and that these good Qualities shou'd become National and rise and fall in proportion to the Purity of our Religion as it approaches to or recedes from the Plan laid down in the Gospel  XII  To make a right Judgment of the Effects of the Christian Religion let us take a survey of the prevailing Notions and Manners of this very Country where we live and compare them with those of our Heathen Predecessors  ALC  I have heard much of the glorious Light of the Gospel and shou'd be glad to see some Effects of it in my own dear Country which by the bye is one of the most corrupt and profligate upon Earth notwithstanding the boasted Purity of our Religion But it wou'd look mean and diffident to affect a Comparison with the barbarous Heathen from whence we drew our Original If you wou'd do Honour to your Religion dare to make it with the most renowned Heathens of Antiquity  CRI  It is a common Prejudice to despise the present and overrate remote Times and Things Something of this seems to enter into the Judgments Men make of the  Greeks  and  Romans  For though it must be allowed those Nations produced some noble Spirits and great Patterns of Virtue yet upon the whole it seems to me they were much inferior in point of real Virtue and good Morals even to this corrupt and Profligate Nation as you are now pleased to call it in dishonour to our Religion however you may think fit to characterize it when you wou'd do honour to the Minute Philosophy This I think will be plain to any one who shall turn off his Eyes from a few shining Characters to view the general  Manners and Customs of those People Their insolent treatment of Captives even of the highest Rank and softer Sex their unnatural exposing of their own Children their bloody Gladiatorian Spectacles compared with the common Notions of  Englishmen  are to me a plain Proof that our Minds are much softened by Christianity Cou'd any thing be more unjust than the condemning a young Lady to the most infamous Punishment and Death for the guilt of her Father or a whole Family of Slaves perhaps some hundreds for a Crime committed by one Or more Abominable than their Bacchanals and unbridled Lusts of every kind which notwithstanding all that has been done by Minute Philosophers to debauch the Nation and their successful Attempts on some part of it have not yet been matched among us at least not in every circumstance of Impudence and Effrontery While the  Romans  were poor they were temperate but as they grew rich they became luxurious to a degree that is hardly believed or conceived by us It cannot be denied the old  Roman  Spirit was a great one But it is as certain there have been numberless Examples of the most resolute and clear Courage in  Britons  and in general from a Religious Cause Upon the whole it seems an instance of the greatest Blindness and Ingratitude that we do not see and own the exceeding great Benefits of Christianity which to omit higher considerations hath so visibly softened polished and embellished our Manners  XIII  ALC  O  Crito  we are alarmed at Cruelty in a foreign Shape but overlook it in a familiar one Else how is it possible that you shou'd not see the Inhumanity of that barbarous Custom of Duelling a thing avowed and tolerated and even reputable among us Or that seeing this you shou'd suppose our  Englishmen  of a more gentle disposition than the old  Romans  who were altogether Strangers to it  CRI  I will by no means make an Apology for every  Goth  that walks the Streets with a determined purpose to murder any Man who shall but spit in his Face or give him the Lye Nor do I think the Christian Religion is in the least answerable for a practice so directly opposite to its Precepts and which obtains only among the idle part of the Nation your Men of Fashion who instead of Law Reason or Religion are governed by Fashion Be pleased to consider that what may be and truly is a most scandalous reproach to a Christian Country may be none at all to the Christian Religion For the Pagan encouraged Men in several Vices but the Christian in none  ALC  Give me leave to observe that what you now say is foreign to the purpose For the question at present is not concerning the respective tendencies of the Pagan and the Christian Religions but concerning our Manners as actually compared with those of ancient Heathens who I aver had no such barbarous Custom as Duelling  CRI  And I aver that bad as this is they had a worse and that was Poisoning By which we have reason to think there were many more Lives destroyed than by this  Gothic  Crime of Duelling Inasmuch as it extended to all Ages Sexes and Characters and as its Effects were more secret and unavoidable and as it had more Temptations Interest as well as Passion to recommend it to wicked Men And for the Fact not to waste time I refer you to the  Roman  Authors themselves  LYS  It is very true Duelling is not so general a Nusance as Poisoning nor of so base a Nature This Crime if it be a Crime is in a fair way to keep its ground in spight of the Law and the Gospel The Clergy never preach against it because themselves never suffer by it and the Man of honour must not appear against the means of vindicating Honour  CRI  Though it be remarked by some of your Sect that the Clergy are not used to preach against Duelling yet I neither think the Remark it self just nor the Reason assigned  for it In effect one half of their Sermons all that is said of Charity Brotherly Love Forbearance Meekness and Forgiving Injuries is directly against this wicked Custom by which the Clergy themselves are so far from never suffering that perhaps they will be found all things considered to suffer oftner than other Men  LYS  How do you make this appear  CRI  An Observer of Mankind may remark two kinds of Bully the Fighting and the Tame both public Nusances the former who is the more dangerous Animal but by much the less common of the two employs himself wholly and solely against the Laity while the tame Species exert their Talents upon the Clergy The Qualities constituent of this tame Bully are natural Rudeness joined with a delicate sense of Danger For you must know the force of inbred Insolence and ill Manners is not diminished though it acquire a new Determination from the fashionable custom of calling Men to account for their Behaviour Hence you may often see one of these tame Bullies ready to burst with Pride and ill Humour which he dares not vent till a Parson has come in the way to his Relief And the Man of Raillery who wou'd as soon bite off his Tongue as break a jest on the profession of Arms in the presence of a military Man shall instantly brighten up and assume a familiar Air with Religion and the Church before Ecclesiastics  Dorcon  who passeth for a Poltron and stupid in all other Company and really is so when he is got among Clergymen affects a quite opposite Character And many  Dorcons  there are which owe their Wit and Courage to this Passive Order  XIV  ALC  But to return to the point in hand can you deny the old  Romans  were as famous for Justice and Integrity as Men in these days for the contrary Qualities  CRI  The Character of the  Romans  is not to be taken from the Sentiments of  Tully  or  Cato  's Actions or a shining passage here and there  in their History but from the prevailing tenor of their Lives and Notions Now if they and our modern  Britons  are weighed in this same equal balance you will if I mistake not appear to have been prejudiced in favour of the old  Romans  against your own Country probably because it professeth Christianity Whatever instances of Fraud or Injustice may be seen in Christians carry their own censure with them in the care that is taken to conceal them and the shame that attends their discovery There is even at this day a sort of Modesty in all our public Councils and Deliberations And I believe the boldest of our Minute Philosophers wou'd hardly undertake in a popular Assembly to propose any thing paralled to the Rape of the  Sabines  the most unjust usage of  Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus  or the ungrateful treatment of  Camillus  which as a learned Father observes were instances of Iniquity agreed to by the public body of the  Romans  And if  Rome  in her early days were capable of such flagrant Injustice it is most certain she did not mend her Manners as she grew great in Wealth and Empire having produced Monsters in every kind of Wickedness as far exceeding other Men as they surpassed them in power I freely acknowledge the Christian Religion hath not had the same influence upon the Nation that it wou'd in case it had been always professed in its Purity and cordially believed by all Men But I will venture to say that if you take the  Roman  History from one end to the other and impartially compare it with our own you will neither find them so good nor your Countrymen so bad as you imagine On the contrary an indifferent Eye may I verily think perceive a vein of Charity and Justice the effect of Christian Principles run through the latter which though not equally discernible in all parts yet discloseth it self sufficiently to make a wide difference upon the whole in spight of the general Appetites and Passions of Human Nature as well as of the particular  hardness and roughness of the block out of which we were hewn And it is observable what the  Roman  Authors themselves do often suggest that even their Virtues and magnanimous Actions rose and fell with a sense of Providence and a future State and a Philosophy the nearest to the Christian Religion  XV  Crito  having spoke thus paused But  Alciphron  addressing himself to  Euphranor  and me said It is natural for Men according to their several Educations and Prejudices to form contrary Judgments upon the same things which they view in very different lights  Crito  for instance imagines that none but Salutary Effects proceed from Religion on the other hand if you appeal to the general Experience and Observation of other Men you shall find it grown into a Proverb that Religion is the root of evil  Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum  And this not only among  Epicureans  or other ancient Heathens but among Moderns speaking of the Christian Religion Now methinks it is unreasonable to oppose against the general concurring Opinion of the World the Observation of a particular Person or particular set of Zealots whose Prejudice sticks close to them and ever mixeth with their Judgment and who read collect and observe with an Eye not to discover the Truth but to defend their Prejudice  CRI  Though I cannot think with  Alciphron  yet I must own I admire his Address and Dexterity in Argument Popular and general Opinion is by him represented on certain occasions to be a sure mark of Error But when it serves his ends that it shou'd seem otherwise he can as easily make it a Character of Truth But it will by no means follow that a profane Proverb used by the Friends and  admired Authors of a Minute Philosopher must therefore be a received Opinion much less a Truth grounded on the Experience and Observation of Mankind Sadness may spring from Guilt or Superstition and Rage from Bigotry but Darkness might as well be supposed the natural Effect of Sunshine as sullen and furious Passions to proceed from the glad Tidings and divine Precepts of the Gospel What is the Sum and Substance Scope and End of Christ's Religion but the Love of God and Man To which all other Points and Duties are relative and subordinate as Parts or Means as Signs Principles Motives or Effects Now I wou'd fain know how it is possible for Evil or Wickedness of any kind to spring from such a source I will not pretend there are no evil Qualities in Christians nor good in Minute Philosophers But this I affirm that whatever evil is in us our Principles certainly lead to Good and whatever good there may be in you it is most certain your Principles lead to evil  XVI  ALC  It must be owned there is a fair outside and many plausible things may be said for the Christian Religion taken simply as it lies in the Gospel But it is the Observation of one of our great Writers that the first Christian Preachers very cunningly began with the fairest Face and the best moral Doctrines in the World It was all Love Charity Meekness Patience and so forth But when by this means they had drawn over the World and got Power they soon changed their Appearance and shewed Cruelty Ambition Avarice and every bad quality  CRI  That is to say some Men very cunningly preached and underwent a world of hardships and laid down their lives to propagate the best Principles and the best Morals to the end that others some Centuries after might reap the benefit of bad ones Whoever may be cunning there is not much Cunning in the maker of this Observation  ALC  And  yet ever since this Religion hath appeared in the World we have had eternal Feuds Factions Massacres and Wars the very reverse of that Hymn with which it is introduced in the Gospel  Glory be to God on high on Earth Peace Goodwill towards Men CRI  This I will not deny I will even own that the Gospel and the Christian Religion have been often the Pretexts for these Evils but it will not thence follow they were the Cause On the contrary it is plain they cou'd not be the real proper Cause of these Evils because a rebellious proud revengeful quarrelsome Spirit is directly opposite to the whole Tenor and most express Precepts of Christianity a Point so clear that I shall not prove it And secondly because all those Evils you mention were as frequent nay much more frequent before the Christian Religion was known in the World They are the common Product of the Passions and Vices of Mankind which are sometimes covered with the Masque of Religion by wicked Men having the Form of Godliness without the Power of it This Truth seems so plain that I am surprised how any Man of Sense Knowledge and Candour can make a doubt of it  XVII  Take but a view of Heathen  Rome  what a Scene is there of Faction and Fury and civil Rage Let any Man consider the perpetual Feuds between the  Patricians  and  Plebeians  the bloody and inhuman Factions of  Marius  and  Sylla Cinna  and  Octavius  and the vast havoc of Mankind during the two famous Triumvirates To be short let any Man of common Candour and common Sense but cast an Eye from one end to the other of the  Roman  Story and behold that long Scene of Seditions Murders Massacres Proscriptions and Desolations of every kind enhansed by every cruel circumstance of Rage Rapine and Revenge and then say whether those Evils were introduced into the World with the Christian Religion or whether they are not less frequent now than before  ALC  The ancient  Romans  it must be owned had a high and fierce Spirit which produced eager Contentions and very bloody Catastrophes The  Greeks  on the other hand were a polite and gentle sort of Men softened by Arts and Philosophy It is impossible to think of the little States and Cities of  Greece  without wishing to have lived in those times without admiring their Policy and eavying their Happiness  CRI  Men are apt to consider the dark sides of what they possess and the bright ones of things out of their reach A fine Climate elegant Taste polite Amusements love of Liberty and a most ingenious inventive Spirit for Arts and Sciences were indisputable Prerogatives of ancient  Greece  But as for Peace and Quietness Gentleness and Humanity I think we have plainly the advantage For those envied Cities composed of gentle  Greeks  were not without their Factions which persecuted each other with such Treachery Rage and Malice that in respect of them our factious Folk are meer Lambs To be convinced of this Truth you need only look into  Thucydides  Thucyd l  where you will find those Cities in general involved in such bitter Factions as for FellowCitizens without the formalities of War to murder one another even in their Senatehouses and their Temples no regard being had to Merit Rank Obligation or Nearness of Blood And if Human Nature boiled up to so vehement a pitch in the politest People what wonder that savage Nations shou'd scalp roast torture and destroy each other as they are known to do It is therefore plain that without Religion there wou'd not be wanting Pretexts for Quarrels and Debates all which can very easily be accounted for by the natural Infirmities and Corruption of Men It wou'd not perhaps be so easy to account for the Blindness of those who impute the most hellish Effects  to the most divine Principle if they cou'd be supposed in earnest and to have considered the Point One may daily see ignorant and prejudiced Men make the most absurd Blunders But that Freethinkers Divers to the Bottom of Things Fair Inquirers and Openers of Eyes should be capable of such a gross Mistake is what one would not expect  XVIII  ALC  The rest of Mankind we cou'd more easily give up but as for the  Greeks  Men of the most refined Genius express an high esteem of them not only on account of those Qualities which you think fit to allow them but also for their Virtues  CRI  I shall not take upon me to say how far some Men may be prejudiced against their Country or whether others may not be prejudiced in favour of it But upon the fullest and most equal Observation that I am able to make it is my opinion that if by Virtue is meant Truth Justice Gratitude there is incomparably more Virtue now at this day in  England  than at any time cou'd be found in ancient  Greece  Thus much will be allowed that we know few Countries if any where Men of eminent Worth and famous for deserving well of the Public met with harder Fate and were more ungratefully treated than in the most polite and learned of the  Grecian  States Though  Socrates  it must be owned wou'd not allow that those Statesmen by adorning the City augmenting the Fleet or extending the Commerce of  Athens  deserved well of their Country or cou'd with justice complain of the ungrateful Returns made by their FellowCitizens whom while they were in power they had taken no care to make better Men by improving and cultivating their Minds with the Principles of Virtue which if they had done they needed not to have feared their Ingratitude If I were to declare my opinion what gave the chief Advantage to  Greeks  and  Romans  and other Nations which have made the greatest Figure in the World I shou'd be  apt to think it was a peculiar Reverence for their respective Laws and Institutions which inspired them with Steadiness and Courage and that hearty generous Love of their Country by which they did not meerly understand a certain Language or Tribe of Men much less a particular spot of Earth but included a certain System of Manners Customs Notions Rites and Laws Civil and Religious  ALC  Oh I perceive your Drift you wou'd have us reverence the Laws and religious Institutions of our Country But herein we beg to be excused if we do not think fit to imitate the  Greeks  or to be governed by any Authority whatsoever But to return As for Wars and Factions I grant they ever were and ever will be in the World upon some pretext or other as long as Men are Men  XIX  But there is a sort of War and Warriors peculiar to Christendom which the Heathens had no notion of I mean Disputes in Theology and Polemical Divines which the World hath been wonderfully pestered with these Teachers of Peace Meekness Concord and what not if you take their word for it But if you cast any eye upon their Practice you find them to have been in all Ages the most contentious quarrelsome disagreeing Crew that ever appeared upon Earth To observe the Skill and Sophistry the Zeal and Eagerness with which those Barbarians the School Divines split Hairs and contest about Chimaera's gives me more Indignation as being more absurd and a greater scandal to human Reason than all the ambitious Intrigues Cabals and Politics of the Court of  Rome CRI  If Divines are quarrelsome that is not so far forth as Divine but as Undivine and Unchristian Justice is a good thing and the Art of Healing is excellent nevertheless in the administring of Justice or Physic Men may be wronged or poisoned But as Wrong  cannot be Justice or the Effect of Justice so Poison cannot be Medicine or the Effect of Medicine so neither can Pride or Strife be Religion or the effect of Religion Having premised this I acknowledge you may often see hotheaded Bigots engage themselves in religious as well as civil Parties without being of credit or service to either And as for the Schoolmen in particular I do not in the least think the Christian Religion concerned in the Defence of them their Tenets or their Method of handling them but whatever futility there may be in their Notions or inelegancy in their Language in pure justice to Truth one must own they neither banter nor rail nor declaim in their Writings and are so far from shewing Fury or Passion that perhaps an impartial Judge will think the Minute Philosophers are by no means to be compared with them for keeping close to the Point or for Temper and good Manners But after all if Men are puzzled wrangle talk nonsense and quarrel about Religion so they do about Law Physic Politics and every thing else of moment I ask whether in these Professions or in any other where men have refined and abstracted they do not run into Disputes Chicane Nonsense and Contradictions as well as in Divinity And yet this doth not hinder but there may be many excellent Rules and just Notions and useful Truths in all those Professions In all Disputes human Passions too often mix themselves in proportion as the Subject is conceived to be more or less important But we ought not to confound the Cause of Men with the Cause of God or make Human Follies an Objection to Divine Truths It is easy to distinguish what looks like Wisdom from above and what proceeds from the passion and weakness of Men This is so clear a Point that one wou'd be tempted to think the not doing it was an Effect not of Ignorance but of something worse  XX  The Conduct we object to Minute Philosophers is a natural consequence of their Principles Whatsoever they can reproach us with is an Effect not of our Principles but of Human Passion and Frailty  ALC  This is admirable So we must no longer object to Christians the absurd Contentions of Councils the Cruelty of Inquisitions the Ambition and Usurpations of Churchmen  CRI  You may object them to Christians but not to Christianity If the Divine Author of our Religion and his Disciples have sowed a good Seed and together with this good Seed the Enemies of his Gospel among whom are to be reckoned the Minute Philosophers of all Ages have sowed bad Seeds whence spring Tares and Thistles is it not evident these bad Weeds cannot be imputed to the good Seed or to those who sowed it Whatever you do or can object against Ecclesiastical Tyranny Usurpation or Sophistry may without any blemish or disadvantage to Religion be acknowledged by all true Christians provided still that you impute those wicked effects to their true Cause not blaming any Principles or Persons for them but those that really produce or justify them Certainly as the Interests of Christianity are not to be supported by unchristian Methods whenever these are made use of it must be supposed there is some other latent Principle which sets them at work If the very Court of  Rome  hath been known from Motives of Policy to oppose settling the Inquisition in a Kingdom where the secular Power hath endeavoured to introduce it in spight of that Court  P Paolo istoria dell' Inquisitione p  We may well suppose that elsewhere Factions of State and political Views of Princes have given birth to Transactions seemingly religious wherein at bottom neither Religion nor Church nor Churchmen were at all  consider'd As no Man of common Sense and Honesty will engage in a general Desence of Ecclesiastics so I think no Man of common Candour can condemn them in general Wou'd you think it reasonable to blame all Statesmen Lawyers or Soldiers for the Faults committed by those of their Profession though in other Times or in other Countries and influenced by other Maxims and other Discipline And if not why do you measure with one Rule to the Clergy and another to the Laity Surely the best Reason that can be given for this is Prejudice Shou'd any Man rake together all the Mischiefs that have been committed in all Ages and Nations by Soldiers and Lawyers you wou'd I suppose conclude from thence not that the State shou'd be deprived of those useful Professions but only that their Exorbitances shou'd be guarded against and punished If you took the same equitable Course with the Clergy there wou'd indeed be less to be said against you but then you wou'd have much less to say This plain obvious Consideration if every one who read considered wou'd lessen the Credit of your Declaimers  ALC  But when all is said that can be said it must move a Man's Indignation to see reasonable Creatures under the Notion of Study and Learning employ'd in reading and writing so many voluminous Tracts  de lanÃ¢ caprinÃ¢ CRI  I shall not undertake the Vindication of Theological Writings a general Defence being as needless as a general Charge is groundless Only let them speak for themselves and let no Man condemn them upon the Word of a Minute Philosopher But we will imagine the very worst and suppose a wrangling Pedant in Divinity disputes and ruminates and writes upon a refined Point as useless and unintelligible as you please Suppose this same Person bred a Layman might he not have employ'd himself in tricking Bargains vexatious Lawsuits Factions Seditions and such like Amusements with much more Prejudice  to the Public Suffer then curious Wits to spin Cobwebs where is the hurt  ALC  The Mischief is what Men want in light they commonly make up in Heat Zeal and ill Nature being Weapons constantly exerted by the Partisans as well as Champions on either Side And those perhaps not mean Pedants or Bookworms You shall often see even the learned and eminent Divine lay himself out in explaining Things inexplicable or contend for a barren Point of Theory as if his Life Liberty or Fortune were at stake  CRI  No doubt all Points in Divinity are not of equal Moment Some may be too fine spun and others have more Stress laid on them than they deserve Be the Subject what it will you shall often observe that a Point by being controverted singled out examined and nearly inspected groweth considerable to the same Eye that perhaps wou'd have overlooked it in a large and comprehensive View Nor is it an uncommon thing to behold Ignorance and Zeal united in Men who are born with a Spirit of Party though the Church or Religion have in Truth but small Share in it Nothing is easier than to make a  Caricatura  as the Painters call it of any Profession upon Earth But at bottom there will be found nothing so strange in all this Charge upon the Clergy as the Partiality of those who censure them in supposing the common Defects of Mankind peculiar to their Order or the Effect of religious Principles  ALC  Other Folks may dispute or squabble as they please and no Body mind them but it seems these venerable Squabbles of the Clergy pass for Learning and interest Mankind To use the Words of the most ingenious Characterizer of our Times  A Ring is made and Readers gather in abundance Every one takes Party and encourages his own Side This shall be my Champion This Man for my Money Well hit on our Side Again a good Stroke There he was even with him Have at him the  next Bout Excellent Sport  Characteristics Vol III c  CRI  Methinks I trace the Man of Quality and Breeding in this delicate Satyr which so politely ridicules those Arguments Answers Defences and Replications which the Press groans under  ALC  To the infinite waste of Time and Paper and all the while no Body is one whit the wiser And who indeed can be the wiser for reading Books upon Subjects quite out of the way incomprehensible and most wretchedly written What Man of Sense or Breeding wou'd not abhor the Infection of prolix Pulpit Eloquence or of that dry formal pedantic stiff and clumsy Style which smells of the Lamp and the College  XXI  They who have the Weakness to reverence the Universities as Seats of Learning must needs think this a strange Reproach but it is a very just one For the most ingenious Men are now agreed that they are only Nurseries of Prejudice Corruption Barbarism and Pedantry  LYS  For my part I find no Fault with Universities All I know is that I had the spending three hundred Pounds a Year in one of them and think it the chearfullest time of my Life As for their Books and Style I had not leisure to mind them  CRI  Whoever hath a mind to weed will never want work and he that shall pick out bad Books on every Subject will soon fill his Library I do not know what Theological Writings  Alciphron  and his Friends may be conversant in but I will venture to say one may find among our  English  Divines many Writers who for compass of Learning weight of Matter Strength of Argument and Purity of Style are not inferiour to any in our Language It is not my Design to apologize for the Universities whatever is amiss in them and what is there perfect among Men I heartily wish amended But  I dare affirm because I know it to be true that any impartial Observer although they shou'd not come up to what in Theory he might wish or imagine will nevertheless find them much superior to those that in Fact are to be found in other Countries and far beyond the mean Picture that is drawn of them by Minute Philosophers It is natural for those to rail most at Places of Education who have profited least by them Weak and fond Parents will also readily impute to a wrong Cause those Corruptions themselves have occasion'd by allowing their Children more Money than they knew how to spend innocently And too often a Gentleman who has been idle at the College and kept idle Company will judge of a whole University from his own Cabal  ALC Crito  mistakes the Point I vouch the Authority not of a Dunce or a Rake or absurd Parent but of the most consummate Critic this Age has produced This great Man characterizeth Men of the Church and Universities with the finest Touches and most masterly Pencil What do you think he calls them  EUPH  What  ALC  Why the black Tribe Magicians Formalists Pedants bearded Boys and having sufficiently

a noble Writer another  ALC  Both Characters are coincident as you may see  XXII  Upon which  Alciphron  pulled a Treatise out of his Pocket entitled a Soliloquy or Advice to an Author Wou'd you behold said he looking round upon the Company a noble Specimen of fine Writing do but dip into this Book which  Crito  opening read verbatim as follows  Part Sect    'Where then are the Pleasures which Ambition promises  'And Love affords How's the gay World enjoy'd  'Or are those to be esteem'd no Pleasures  'Which are lost by Dulness and Inaction  'But Indolence is the highest Pleasure  'To

once I have dismist thy Patroness  And despised her threats  Thus I contend with Fancy and Opinion  Euphranor  having heard thus far cried out What will you never have done with your Poetry another time may serve But why shou'd we break off our Conference to read a Play You are mistaken it is no Play nor Poetry replied  Alciphron  but a famous modern Critic moralizing in Prose You must know this great Man hath to use his own Words revealed a  Grand Arcanum  to the World having instructed Mankind in what he calls  Mirrourwriting Selfdiscoursing Practice and Author Practice  and shew'd  That by virtue of an intimate Recess we may discover a certain Duplicity of Soul and divide our  Self  into two Parties or as he varies the Phrase practically form the Dual Number  In consequence whereof he hath found out that a Man may argue with himself and not only with himself but also with Notions Sentiments and Vices which by a marvellous Prosopopoeia he converts into so many Ladies and so converted he confutes and confounds them in a Divine Strain Can any thing be finer bolder or more sublime  EUPH  It is very wonderful I thought indeed you had been reading a Piece of a Tragedy Is this he who despiseth our Universities and sets up for reforming the Style and Taste of the Age  ALC  The very same This is the admired Critic of our Times Nothing can  stand the Test of his correct Judgment which is equally severe to Poets and Parsons  The  British  Muses saith this great Man lisp as in their Cradles and their stammering Tongues which nothing but Youth and Rawness can excuse have hitherto spoken in wretched Pun and Quibble Our Dramatic  Shakespear  our  Fletcher Johnson  and our Epique  Milton  preserve this Style And according to him even our later Authors aiming at a false Sublime entertain our raw Fancy and unpractised Ear which has not yet had leisure to form it self and become truly musical  EUPH  Pray what Effect may the Lessons of this great Man in whose Eyes our learned Professors are but bearded Boys and our most celebrated Wits but wretched Punsters have had upon the Public Hath he rubbed off the College Rust cured the rudeness and rawness of our Authors and reduced them to his own Attic Standard Do they aspire to his true Sublime or imitate his chaste unaffected Style  ALC  Doubtless the Taste of the Age is much mended in proof whereof his Writings are universally admired When our Author published this Treatise he foresaw the public Taste wou'd improve apace that Arts and Letters wou'd grow to great perfection that there wou'd be a happy Birth of Genius of all which things he spoke as he saith himself in a prophetic Style  CRI  And yet notwithstanding the prophetical Predictions of this Critic I do not find any Science that throve among us of late so much as the Minute Philosophy In this kind it must be confessed we have had many notable Productions But whether they are such Masterpieces for good Writing I leave to be determined by their Readers  XXIII  In the mean time I must beg to be excused if I cannot believe your great Man on his bare word when he wou'd have us think that Ignorance and ill Taste are owing to the Christian Religion or  the Clergy it being my sincere Opinion that whatever Learning or Knowledge we have among us is derived from that Order If those who are so sagacious at discovering a Mote in other Eyes wou'd but purge their own I believe they might easily see this Truth For what but Religion cou'd kindle and preserve a Spirit towards Learning in such a Northern rough People  Greece  produced Men of active and subtile Genius The public Conventions and Aemulations of their Cities forwarded that Genius And their natural Curiosity was amused and excited by learned Conversations in their public Walks and Gardens and Porticos Our Genius leads to Amusements of a grosser kind we breathe a grosser and a colder Air and that Curiosity which was general in the  Athenians  and the gratifying of which was their chief Recreation is among our People of Fashion treated like Affectation and as such banished from polite Assemblies and places of Resort and without doubt wou'd in a little Time be banished the Country if it were not for the great Reservoirs of Learning where those Formalists Pedants and bearded Boys as your profound Critic calls them are maintained by the Liberality and Piety of our Predecessors For it is as evident that Religion was the Cause of those Seminaries as it is that they are the Cause or Source of all the Learning and Taste which is to be found even in those very Men who are the declared Enemies of our Religion and public Foundations Every one who knows any thing knows we are indebted for our Learning to the  Greek  and  Latin  Tongues This those severe Censors will readily grant Perhaps they may not be so ready to grant what all Men must see that we are indebted for those Tongues to our Religion What else cou'd have made foreign and dead Languages in such request among us What cou'd have kept in being and handed them down to our times through so many dark Ages in which the World was wasted and disfigured by Wars and Violence What  but a regard to the Holy Scriptures and Theological Writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church And in fact do we not find that the Learning of those Times was solely in the Hands of Ecclesiastics that they alone lighted the Lamp in succession one from another and transmitted it down to Afterages and that ancient Books were collected and preserved in their Colleges and Seminaries when all Love and Remembrance of polite Arts and Studies was extinguished among the Laity whose Ambition intirely turned to Arms  XXIV  ALC  There is I must needs say one sort of Learning undoubtedly of Christian Original and peculiar to the Universities where our Youth spend several Years in acquiring that mysterious jargon of Scholasticism than which there cou'd never have been contrived a more effectual Method to perplex and confound Human Understanding It is true Gentlemen are untaught by the World what they have been taught at the College but then their Time is doubly lost  CRI  But what if this scholastic Learning was not of Christian but of Mahomeran Original being derived from the  Arabs  And what if this Grievance of Gentlemen's spending several Years in learning and unlearning this Jargon be all Grimace and a Specimen only of the truth and candour of certain Minute Philosophers who raise great Invectives from slight occasions and judge too often without inquiring Surely it wou'd be no such deplorable loss of Time if a young Gentleman spent a few Months upon that so much despised and decried Art of Logic a Surfeit of which is by no means the prevailing Nusance of this Age It is one thing to waste one's Time in learning and unlearning the barbarous Terms wiredrawn Distinctions and prolix Sophistry of the Schoolmen and another to attain some exactness in Defining and Arguing Things perhaps not altogether beneath the Dignity even of a  Minute Philosopher There was indeed a Time when Logic was considered as its own Object And that Art of Reasoning instead of being transferred to Things turned altogether upon Words and Abstractions which produced a sort of Leprosy in all parts of Knowledge corrupting and converting them into hollow verbal Disputations in a most impure Dialect But those Times are passed and that which had been cultivated as the principal Learning for some Ages is now considered in another Light and by no means makes that Figure in the Universities or bears that Part in the Studies of young Gentlemen educated there which is pretended by those admirable Reformers of Religion and Learning the Minute Philosophers  XXV  But who were they that encouraged and produced the Restoration of Arts and polite Learning What Share had the Minute Philosophers in this Affair  Matthias Corvinus  King of  Hungary Alphonsus  King of  Naples Cosmus de Medicis Picus  of  Mirandula  and other Princes and great Men famous for Learning themselves and for encouraging it in others with a munificent Liberality were neither Turks nor Gentiles nor Minute Philosophers Who was it that transplanted and revived the  Greek  Language and Authors and with them all polite Arts and Literature in the West Was it not chiefly  Bessarion  a Cardinal  Marcus Musurus  an Archbishop  Theodore Gaza  a private Clergyman Has there been a greater and more renowned Patron and Restorer of elegant Studies in every kind since the days of  Augustus Caesar  than  Leo  the tenth Pope of  Rome  Did any Writers approach the Purity of the  Classics  nearer than the Cardinals  Bembus  and  Sadoletus  or than the Bishops  Jovius  and  Vida  not to mention an endless Number of ingenious Ecclesiastics who flourished on the other side of the  Alpes  in the Golden Age as the  Italians  call it of  Leo  the Tenth and wrote  both in their own Language and the  Latin  after the best Models of Antiquity It is true this first Recovery of Learning preceded the Reformation and lighted the way to it But the Religious Controversies which ensued did wonderfully propagate and improve it in all Parts of Christendom And surely the Church of  England  is at least as well calculated for the Encouragement of Learning as that of  Rome  Experience confirms this Observation and I believe the Minute Philosophers will not be so partial to  Rome  as to deny it  ALC  It is impossible your account of Learning beyond the  Alpes  shou'd be true The noble Critic in my hands having complimented the  French  to whom he allows some good Authors asserts of other Foreigners particularly the  Italians  That they may be reckoned no better than the Corrupters of true Learning and Erudition  CRI  With some sorts of Critics Dogmatical Censures and Conclusions are not always the result of perfect Knowledge or exact Inquiry And if they harangue upon Taste truth of Art a just Piece grace of Style Attic Elegance and such Topics they are to be understood only as those that would fain talk themselves into Reputation for Courage To hear  Thrasymachus  speak of Resentment Duels and point of Honour one wou'd think him ready to burst with Valour  LYS  Whatever Merit this Writer may have as a Demolisher I always thought he had very little as a Builder It is natural for careless Writers to run into Faults they never think of But for an exact and severe Critic to shoot his Bolt at random is unpardonable If he who professes at every turn an high esteem for polite Writing shou'd yet despise those who most excel in it one would be tempted to suspect his Taste But if the very Man who of all Men talks most about Art and Taste and critical Skill and wou'd be thought to have most considered those Points shou'd often deviate from his own Rules into  the false Sublime or the  mauvaise Plaisanterie  What reasonable Man wou'd follow the Taste and Judgment of such a Guide or be seduced to climb the steep Ascent or tread in the rugged Paths of Virtue on his Recommendation  XXVI  ALC  But to return methinks  Crito  makes no Compliment to the Genius of his Country in supposing that  Englishmen  might not have wrought out of themselves all Art and Science and good Taste without being beholden to Church or Universities or ancient Languages  CRI  What might have been is only Conjecture What has been it is not difficult to know That there is a Vein in  Britain  of as rich an Ore as ever was in any Country I will not deny but it lies deep and will cost Pains to come at And extraordinary Pains require an extraordinary Motive As for what lies next the Surface it seems but indifferent being neither so good nor in such plenty as in some other Countries It was the Comparison of an ingenious  Florentine  that the celebrated Poems of  Tasso  and  Ariosto  are like two Gardens the one of Cucumbers the other of Melons In the one you shall find few bad but the best are not a very Good Fruit in the other much the greater part are good for nothing but those that are good are excellent Perhaps the same Comparison may hold between the  English  and some of their Neighbours  ALC  But suppose we should grant that the Christian Religion and its Seminaries might have been of use in preserving or retrieving polite Arts and Letters what then Will you make this an Argument of its Truth  CRI  I will make it an Argument of Prejudice and Ingratitude in those Minute Philosophers who object Darkness Ignorance and Rudeness as an Effect of that very thing which above all others hath enlightened and civilized and embellished their Country which is as truly indebted to it for Arts and Sciences which nothing but Religion was ever  known to have planted in such a Latitude as for that general Sense of Virtue and Humanity and the Belief of a Providence and future State which all the Argumentation of Minute Philosophers hath not yet been able to abolish  XXVII  ALC  It is strange you shou'd still persist to argue as if all the Gentlemen of our Sect were Enemies to Virtue and downright Atheists Though I have assured you of the contrary and that we have among us several who profess themselves in the Interests of Virtue and Natural Religion and have also declared that I my self do now argue upon that Foot  CRI  How can you pretend to be in the Interest of Natural Religion and yet be professed Enemies of the Christian the only established Religion which includes whatever is excellent in the Natural and which is the only means of making those Precepts Duties and Notions so called become reverenced throughout the World Would not he be thought weak or insincere who shou'd go about to persuade People that he was much in the Interests of an earthly Monarch that he loved and admired his Government when at the same time he shewed himself on all occasions a most bitter Enemy of those very Persons and Methods which above all others contributed most to his Service and to make his Dignity known and revered his Laws observed or his Dominion extended And is not this what Minute Philosophers do while they set up for Advocates of God and Religion and yet do all they can to discredit Christians and their Worship It must be owned indeed that you argue against Christianity as the Cause of Evil and Wickedness in the World but with such Arguments and in such a manner as might equally prove the same thing of civil Government of Meat and Drink of every Faculty and Profession of Learning of Eloquence and even of Human Reason it self After all even those of  your Sect who allow themselves to be called Deists if their Notions are thoroughly examined will I fear be found to include little of Religion in them As for the Providence of God watching over the Conduct of Human Agents and dispensing Blessings or Chastisements the Immortality of the Soul a final Judgment and future State of Rewards and Punishments how few if any of your Freethinkers have made it their Endeavour to possess Mens Minds with a serious sense of those great points of Natural Religion How many on the contrary endeavour to render the Belief of them doubtful or ridiculous  LYS  To speak the Truth I for my part had never any liking to Religion of any kind either revealed or unrevealed And I dare venture to say the same for those Gentlemen of our Sect that I am acquainted with having never observed them guilty of so much meanness as even to mention the Name of God with Reverence or speak with the least regard of Piety or any sort of Worship There may perhaps be found one or two formal pretenders to Enthusiasm and Devotion in the way of Natural Religion who laughed at Christians for publishing Hymns and Meditations while they plagued the World with as bad of their own But the sprightly Men make a jest of all this It seems to us meer Pedantry Sometimes indeed in good Company one may hear a Word dropt in Commendation of Honour and Goodnature but the former of these by  Connoisseurs  is always understood to mean nothing but Fashion as the latter is nothing but Temper and Constitution which guides a Man just as Appetite doth a Brute  XXVIII  And after all these Arguments and Notions which beget one another without end to take the matter short neither I nor my Friends for our Souls cou'd ever comprehend why Man might not do very well and govern himself without any Religion at all as well as a Brute which is thought the sillier Creature of the two Have Brutes Instincts  Senses Appetites and Passions to steer and conduct them So have Men and Reason over and above to consult upon occasion From these Premises we conclude the Road of Human Life is sufficiently lighted without Religion  CRI  Brutes having but small power limited to things present or particular are sufficiently opposed and kept in order by the Force or Faculties of other Animals and the Skill of Man without Conscience or Religion But Conscience is a necessary balance to Human Reason a Faculty of such mighty Extent and Power especially toward Mischief Besides other Animals are by the Law of their Nature determined to one certain end or kind of Being without Inclination or Means either to deviate or go beyond it But Man hath in him a Will and higher Principle by virtue whereof he may pursue different or even contrary ends and either fall short of or exceed the Perfection natural to his Species in this World as he is capable either by giving up the Reins to his sensual Appetites of degrading himself into the condition of Brutes or else by well ordering and improving his Mind of being transformed into the similitude of Angels Man alone of all Animals hath understanding to know his God What availeth this Knowledge unless it be to ennoble Man and raise him to an Imitation and Participation of the Divinity Or what cou'd such Ennoblement avail if to end with this Life Or how can these things take effect without Religion But the points of Vice and Virtue Man and Beast Sense and Intellect have been already at large canvassed What  Lysicles  wou'd you have us go back where we were three or four days ago  LYS  By no means I had much rather go forward and make an end as soon as possible But to save trouble give me leave to tell you once for all that say what you can you shall never persuade me so many ingenious agreeable Men are in the wrong and a pack of snarling four Bigots in the right  XXIX  CRI  O  Lysicles  I neither look for Religion among Bigots nor Reason among Libertines each kind disgrace their several Pretensions the one owning no regard even to the plainest and most important Truths while the others exert an angry Zeal for points of least concern And surely whatever there is of silly narrow and uncharitable in the Bigot the same is in great measure to be imputed to the conceited Ignorance and petulant Profaneness of the Libertine And it is not at all unlikely that as Libertines make Bigots so Bigots shou'd make Libertines the Extreme of one party being ever observed to produce a contrary Extreme of another And although while these Adversaries draw the Rope of Contention Reason and Religion are often called upon yet are they perhaps very little considered or concerned in the Contest  Lysicles  instead of answering  Crito  turned short upon  Alciphron  It was always my Opinion said he that nothing cou'd be sillier than to think of destroying Christianity by crying up Natural Religion Whoever thinks highly of the one can never with any consistency think meanly of the other it being very evident that Natural Religion without Revealed never was and never can be established or received any where but in the brains of a few idle speculative Men I was aware what your Concessions wou'd come to The Belief of God Virtue a Future State and such fine Notions are as every one may see with half an eye the very Basis and corner Stone of the Christian Religion Lay but this Foundation for them to build on and you shall soon see what Superstructures our Men of Divinity will raise from it The Truth and Importance of those points once admitted a Man need be no Conjurer to prove upon that Principle the Excellency and Usefulness of the Christian Religion And then to be sure there must be Priests to teach and propagate this useful Religion And if Priests a regular  Subordination without doubt in this worthy Society and a Provision for their Maintenance such as may enable them to perform all their Rites and Ceremonies with Decency and keep their sacred Character above Contempt And the plain consequence of all this is a Confederacy between the Prince and the Priesthood to subdue the People So we have let in at once upon us a long train of Ecclesiastical Evils Priestcraft Hierarchy Inquisition We have lost our Liberty and Property and put the Nation to vast Expence only to purchase Bridles and Saddles for their own backs  XXX  This being spoke with some Sharpness of Tone and an upbraiding Air touched  Alciphron  to the quick who replied nothing but shew'd Confusion in his Looks  Crito  smiling look'd at  Euphranor  and me then casting an eye on the two Philosophers spoke as follows If I may be admitted to interpose good Offices for preventing a Rupture between old Friends and Brethren in Opinion I wou'd observe that in this Charge of  Lysicles  there is something right and something wrong It seems right to assert as he doth that the real Belief of Natural Religion will lead a Man to approve of Revealed But it is as wrong to assert that Inquisitions Tyranny and Ruin must follow from thence Your FreeThinkers without Offence be it said seem to mistake their Talent They imagine strongly but reason weakly mighty at Exaggeration and jejune in Argument Can no Method be found to relieve them from the Terror of that fierce and bloody Animal an  English  Parson Will it not suffice to pair his Talons without chopping off his Fingers Then they are such wonderful Patriots for Liberty and Property When I hear these two Words in the mouth of a Minute Philosopher I am put in mind of the  Teste di Ferro  at  Rome  His Holiness it seems not having Power to assign Pensions on  Spanish  Benefices to any but Natives  of  Spain  always keeps at  Rome  two  Spaniards  called  Teste di Ferro  who have the Name of all such Pensions but not the Profit which goes to  Italians  As we may see every day both Things and Notions placed to the account of Liberty and Property which in reality neither have nor are meant to have any share in them What Is it impossible for a Man to be a Christian but he must be a Slave or a Clergyman but he must have the Principles of an Inquisitor I am far from screening and justifying Appetite of Domination or Tyrannical Power in Ecclesiastics Some who have been guilty in that respect have sorely paid for it and it is to be hoped they always will But having laid the Fury and Folly of the ambitious Prelate is it not time to look about and spy whether on the other hand some Evil may not possibly accrue to the State from the overflowing Zeal of an Independent Whig This I may affirm without being at any pains to prove it that the worst Tyranny this Nation ever felt was from the Hands of Patriots of that Stamp  XXXI  LYS  I don't know Tyranny is a harsh Word and sometimes misapplied When spirited Men of independent Maxims create a Ferment or make a Change in the State He that loseth is apt to consider things in one light and he that wins in another In the mean time this is certainly good Policy that we shou'd be frugal of our Money and reserve it for better Uses than to expend on the Church and Religion  CRI  Surely the old Apologue of the Belly and Members need not be repeated to such knowing Men It shou'd seem as needless to observe that all other States which ever made any Figure in the World for Wisdom and Politeness have thought Learning deserved Encouragement as well as the Sword that Grants for religious Uses were as fitting as for Knights Service and Foundations for propagating Piety as necessary to the publick Welfare and  Defence as either Civil or Military Establishments But I ask who are at this Expence and what is this Expence so much complained of  LYS  As if you had never heard of Church Lands and Tithes  CRI  But I wou'd fain know how they can be charged as an Expence either upon the Nation or private Men Where nothing is exported the Nation loseth nothing and it is all one to the Public whether Money circulates at Home through the Hands of a Vicar or a Squire Then as for private Men who for want of Thought are full of Complaint about the payment of Tithes can any Man justly complain of it as a Tax that he pays what never belonged to him The Tenant rents his Farm with this Condition and pays his Landlord proportionably less than if his Farm had been exempt from it So he loseth nothing it being all one to him whether he pays his Pastor or his Landlord The Landlord cannot complain that he has not what he hath no Right to either by Grant Purchase or Inheritance This is the Case of Tithes and as for the Church Lands he surely can be no Freethinker nor any Thinker at all who doth not see that no Man whether Noble Gentle or Plebeian hath any sort of Right or Claim to them which he may not with equal Justice pretend to all the Lands in the Kingdom  LYS  At present indeed we have no Right and that is our Complaint  CRI  You wou'd have then what you have no Right to  LYS  Not so neither what we wou'd have is first a Right convey'd by Law and in the next place the Lands by virtue of such Right  CRI  In order to this it might be expedient in the first place to get an Act passed for excommunicating from all civil Rights every Man that is a Christian a Scholar and wears a black Coat as guilty of three capital Offences against the public Weal of this Realm  LYS  To deal frankly I think it wou'd be an excellent good Act It wou'd provide at once for several deserving Men rare Artificers in Wit and Argument and Ridicule who have too many  of them but small Fortunes with a great Arrear of Merit towards their Country which they have so long enlightened and adorned  gratis EUPH  Pray tell me  Lysicles  are not the Clergy legally possessed of their Lands and Emoluments  LYS  No Body denies it  EUPH  Have they not been possessed of them from Time immemorial  LYS  This too I grant  EUPH  They claim then by Law and ancient Prescription  LYS  They do  EUPH  Have the oldest Families of the Nobility a better Title  LYS  I believe not It grieves me to see so many overgrown Estates in the hands of ancient Families on account of no other Merit but what they brought with them into the World  EUPH  May you not then as well take their Lands too and bestow them on the Minute Philosophers as Persons of more Merit  LYS  So much the better This enlarges our View and opens a new Scene It is very delightful in the Contemplation of Truth to behold how one Theory grows out of another  ALC  Old  Paetus  used to say that if the Clergy were deprived of their Hire we shou'd lose the most popular Argument against them  LYS  But so long as Men live by Religion there will never be wanting Teachers and Writers in Defence of it  CRI  And how can you be sure they wou'd be wanting though they did not live by it since it is well known Christianity had its Defenders even when Men died by it  LYS  One thing I know there is a rare Nursery of young Plants growing up who have been carefully guarded against every Air of Prejudice and sprinkled with the Dew of our choicest Principles mean while Wishes are wearisome and to our infinite Regret nothing can be done so long as there remains any Prejudice in favour of old Customs and Laws and national Constitutions which at bottom we very well know and can demonstrate to be only Words and Notions  XXXII  But I can never hope  Crito  to make you think my Schemes reasonable We reason each right  upon his own Principles and shall never agree till we quit our Principles which cannot be done by reasoning We all talk of Just and Right and Wrong and public Good and all those things The Names may be the same but the Notions and Conclusions very different perhaps diametrically opposite and yet each may admit of clear Proofs and be inferred by the same way of reasoning For instance the Gentlemen of the Club which I frequent define Man to be a sociable Animal Consequently we exclude from this Definition all those Human Creatures of whom it may be said we had rather have their Room than their Company And such though wearing the Shape of Man are to be esteem'd in all account of Reason not as Men but only as Human Creatures Hence it plainly follows that Men of Pleasure Men of Humour and Men of Wit are alone properly and truly to be considered as Men Whatever therefore conduceth to the Emolument of such is for the good of Mankind and consequently very just and lawful although seeming to be attended with Loss or Damage to other Creatures inasmuch as no real injury can be done in life or property to those who know not how to enjoy them This we hold for clear and well connected Reasoning But others may view things in another light assign different Definitions draw other Inferences and perhaps consider what we suppose the very Top and Flower of the Creation only as a wart or excrescence of Human Nature From all which there must ensue a very different System of Morals Politics Rights and Notions  CRI  If you have a mind to argue we will argue if you have more mind to jest we will laugh with you  LYS  Ridentem dicere verum  Quid vetat  This Partition of our kind into Men and Human Creatures puts me in mind of another Notion broached by one of our Club whom we used to call the  Pythagorean  XXXIII  He made a threefold Partition of the Human Species into Birds Beasts and Fishes being of Opinion that the Road of Life lies upwards in a perpetual Ascent through the Scale of Being In such sort that the Souls of Insects after death make their second Appearance in the Shape of perfect Animals Birds Beasts or Fishes which upon their death are preferred into Human Bodies and in the next Stage into beings of a higher and more perfect kind This Man we considered at first as a sort of Heretic because his Scheme seemed not to consist with our fundamental Tenet the Mortality of the Soul But he justified the Notion to be innocent inasmuch as it included nothing of Reward or Punishment and was not proved by any Argument which supposed or implied either incorporeal Spirit or Providence being only inferred by way of Analogy from what he had observed in Human Affairs the Court the Church and the Army wherein the Tendency is always upwards from lower Posts to higher According to this System the Fishes are those Men who swim in pleasure such as  petits maitres bons vivans  and honest Fellows The beasts are dry drudging covetous rapacious Folk and all those addicted to care and business like Oxen and other dry land Animals which spend their lives in labour and fatigue The Birds are airy notional Men Enthusiasts Projectors Philosophers and such like in each Species every Individual retaining a Tincture of his former State which constitutes what is called Genius If you ask me which Species of Human Creatures I like best I answer The flying Fish that is a Man of animal Enjoyment with a mixture of Whim Thus you see we have our Creeds and our Systems as well as graver Folks with this Difference that they are not straitlaced but sit easy to be slipped off or on as humour or occasion serves And now I can with the greatest  aequanimity imaginable hear my Opinions argued against or confuted  XXXIV  ALC  It were to be wished all Men were of that mind But you shall find a sort of Men whom I need not name that cannot bear with the least temper to have their Opinions examined or their Faults censured They are against Reason because Reason is against them For our parts we are all for Liberty of Conscience If our Tenets are absurd we allow them to be freely argued and inspected and by parity of Reason we might hope to be allowed the same Privilege with respect to the Opinions of other Men  CRI  O  Alciphron  Wares that will not bear the light are justly to be suspected Whatever therefore moves you to make this Complaint take my Word I never will But as hitherto I have allowed your Reason its full scope so for the future I always shall And though I cannot approve of railing or declaiming not even in my self whenever you have shewed me the way to it Yet this I will answer for that you shall ever be allowed to reason as closely and as strenuously as you can But for the love of Truth be candid and do not spend your Strength and our Time in points of no significancy or foreign to the purpose or agreed between us We allow that Tyranny and Slavery are bad things but why shou'd we apprehend them from the Clergy at this time Rites and Ceremonies we own are not Points of chief moment in Religion but why shou'd we ridicule things in their own Nature at least Innocent and which bear the Stamp of supreme Authority That Men in Divinity as well as other Subjects are perplexed with useless Disputes and are like to be as so long as the World lasts I freely acknowledge But why must all the Human Weakness and Mistakes of Clergymen be imputed to wicked Designs Why indiscriminately abuse their Character and Tenets Is this like Candour  love of Truth and Freethinking It is granted there may be found now and then spleen and illbreeding in the Clergy But are not the same Faults incident to  English  Laymen of a retired Education and Country Life I grant there is infinite Futility in the Schoolmen but I deny that a Volume of that doth so much Mischief as a page of Minute Philosophy That weak or wicked Men shou'd by favour of the World creep into Power and high Stations in the Church is nothing wonderful and that in such Stations they shou'd behave like themselves is natural to suppose But all the while it is evident that not the Gospel but the World not the Spirit but the Flesh not God but the Devil puts them upon their unworthy Atchievements We make no difficulty to grant that nothing is more infamous than Vice and Ignorance in a Clergyman nothing more base than a Hypocrite more frivolous than a Pedant more cruel than an Inquisitor But it must be also granted by you Gentlemen that nothing is more ridiculous and absurd than for pedantic ignorant and corrupt Men to cast the first Stone at every shadow of their own Defects and Vices in other Men  XXXV  ALC  When I consider the detestable State of Slavery and Superstition I feel my Heart dilate and expand it self to grasp that inestimable blessing of Liberty absolute Liberty in its utmost unlimited Extent This is the sacred and high Prerogative the very life and health of our  English  Constitution You must not therefore think it strange if with a vigilant and curious Eye we guard it against the minutest Apperance of Evil You must even suffer us to cut round about and very deep and make use of the magnifying Glass the better to view and extirpate every the least speck which shall discover it self in what we are careful and jealous to preserve as the Apple of our Eye  CRI  As for unbounded Liberty I leave it to Savages among whom  alone I believe it is to be found But for the reasonable legal Liberty of our Constitution I most heartily and sincerely wish it may for ever subsist and flourish among us You and all other  Englishmen  cannot be too vigilant or too earnest to preserve this goodly frame or to curb and disappoint the wicked Ambition of whoever Laymen or Ecclesiastic shall attempt to change our free and gentle Government into a slavish or severe one But what Pretext can this afford for your Attempts against Religion or indeed how can it be consistent with them Is not the Protestant Religion a main part of our Legal Constitution I remember to have heard a Foreigner remark that we of this Island were very good Protestans but no Christians But whatever Minute Philosophers may wish or Foreigners say it is certain our Laws speak a different Language  ALC  This puts me in mind of the wise reasoning of a certain sage Magistrate who being pressed by the Raillery and Arguments of an ingenious Man had nothing to say for his Religion but that ten Millions of People inhabiting the same Island might whether right or wrong if they thought good establish Laws for the worshipping of God in their Temples and appealing to him in their Courts of Justice And that in case ten thousand ingenious Men shou'd publickly deride and trample on those Laws it might be just and lawful for the said ten Millions to expel the said ten thousand ingenious Men out of their said Island  EUPH  And pray what answer wou'd you make to this remark of the sage Magistrate  ALC  The answer is plain By the Law of Nature which is superior to all positive Institutions Wit and Knowledge have a right to command Folly and Ignorance I say ingenious Men have by natural Right a Dominion over Fools  EUPH  What Dominion over the Laws and People of  Great Britain  Minute Philosophers may be entitled to by Nature I shall not dispute but leave to be considered by the Public  ALC  This Doctrine it  must be owned was never thoroughly understood before our own times In the last age  Hobbes  and his Followers though otherwise very great Men declared for the Religion of the Magistrate probably because they were afraid of the Magistrate but times are changed and the Magistrates may now be afraid of us  CRI  I allow the Magistrate may well be afraid of you in one sense I mean afraid to trust you This brings to my Thoughts a Passage on the trial of  Leander  for a capital Offence That Gentleman having picked out and excluded from his Jury by peremptory exception all but some Men of Fashion and Pleasure humbly moved when  Dorcon  was going to kiss the Book that he might be required to declare upon Honour whether he believed either God or or Gospel  Dorcon  rather than hazard his Reputation as a Man of Honour and Freethinker openly avowed that he believed in neither Upon which the Court declared him unfit to serve on a Jury By the same reason so many were set aside as made it necessary to put off the Trial We are very easy replied  Alciphron  about being trusted to serve on Juries if we can be admitted to serve in lucrative Employments  CRI  But what if the Government shou'd injoin that every one before he was sworn into Office shou'd make the same Declaration which  Dorcon  was required to make  ALC  God forbid I hope there is no such Design on foot  CRI  Whatever Designs may be on foot thus much is certain The Christian Reformed Religion is a principal Part and Cornerstone of our free Constitution and I verily think the only thing that makes us deserving of Freedom or capable of enjoying it Freedom is either a Blessing or a Curse as Men Use it And to me it seems that if our Religion were once destroy'd from among us and those Notions which pass for Prejudices of a Christian Education erased from the minds of  Britons  the best thing that cou'd befal us wou'd be the loss of our Freedom Surely a People  wherein there is such restless Ambition such high Spirits such Animosity of Faction so great Interests in Contest such unbounded Licence of Speech and Press amidst so much Wealth and Luxury nothing but those  veteres aviae  which you pretend to extirpate cou'd have hitherto kept from ruin  XXXVI  Under the Christian Religion this Nation hath been greatly improved From a sort of Savages we have grown civil polite and learned we have made a decent and noble Figure both at home and abroad And as our Religion decreaseth I am afraid we shall be found to have declined Why then shou'd we persist in the dangerous Experiment  ALC  One wou'd think  Crito  you had forgot the many Calamities occasioned by Churchmen and Religion  CRI  And one wou'd think you had forgot what was answered this very day to that Objection But not to repeat eternally the same things I shall observe in the first place That if we reflect on the past State of Christendom and of our Country in particular with our Feuds and Factions subsisting while we were all of the same Religion for instance that of the White and Red Roses so violent and bloody and of such long continuance we can have no assurance that those ill humours which have since shewn themselves under the masque of Religion wou'd not have broke out with some other Pretext if this had been wanting I observe in the second place that it will not follow from any Observations you can make on our History that the Evils accidentally occasioned by Religion bear any proportion either to the good Effects it hath really produced or the Evils it hath prevented Lastly I observe that the best things may by accident be the occasion of Evil which accidental Effect is not to speak properly and truly produced by the good thing it self but by some evil thing which being neither Part Property nor Effect of it happens to be joined with it But I shou'd be ashamed  to insist and enlarge on so plain a Point and shall only add that whatever Evils this Nation might have formerly sustained from Superstition no Man of common sense will say the Evils felt or apprehended at present are from that Quarter Priestcraft is not the reigning Distemper at this Day And surely it will be owned that a wise Man who takes upon him to be vigilant for the public Weal shou'd touch proper things at proper times and not prescribe for a Surfeit when the Distemper is a Consumption  ALC  I think we have sufficiently discussed the Subject of this day's Conference And now let  Lysicles  take it as he will I must in regard to my own Character as a fair impartial Adversary acknowledge there is something in what  Crito  hath said upon the Usefulness of the Christian Religion I will even own to you that some of our Sect are for allowing it a Toleration I remember at a meeting of several ingenious Men after much debate we came successively to divers Resolutions The first was that no Religion ought to be tolerated in the State But this on more mature thought was judged impracticable The second was that all Religions shou'd be tolerated but none countenanced except Atheism But it was apprehended that this might breed Contentions among the lower sort of People We came therefore to conclude in the third place that some Religion or other shou'd be established for the use of the Vulgar And after a long Dispute what this Religion shou'd be  Lysis  a brisk young Man perceiving no signs of Agreement proposed that the present Religion might be tolerated till a better was found But allowing it to be expedient I can never think it true so long as there lie unanswerable Objections against it which if you please I shall take the Liberty to propose at our next meeting To which we all agreed  The End of the First Volume
