which a  Soldier  carries off the  Prize  has a sort of Right to a  Patron  out of the  Camp  Your condescending to serve for some little Time as Subaltern Officer while You are in the actual Possession of so Noble a Paternal Estate is equally Admir'd and Applauded by All who have the Happiness to know You This is  truly doing an Honour to the  British  Service And how much is it to be desir'd that so Bright an Example may be Imitated by other Gentlemen of the best Families and Fortunes  We have scarce an Instance in  Antient  or  Modern History  of any Hero who has  Commanded  WELL without having first learn'd what it was to OBEY The Greatest among the  Greek  and  Roman  Generals made their First Campaigns in the Nature of Voluntiers and the Greatest  Modern Hero  whose Loss we so lately lamented serv'd first in the  same Post  You now Adorn  IF a Fine  Person  a most Graceful and Easy  Behaviour  joyn'd to a great Knowledge of the  World  and a general  Insight  into all Parts of  Polite Learning  are the most likely Means to raise a Man to Greatness  I know not what Bounds You can reasonably set to Your Ambition One Thing I am well assur'd of That it will be a Happiness to your Country to see You in some of her Highest Military Honours  I confess I am glad to lay hold of any Opportunity of paying my Early Court to so distinguish'd a Merit and hope Sir That my laying this Trifle at Your Feet however poor it may be in itself will be at least some small Proof of that Zeal and Respect with which I am  SIR  Your Most Obedient and Most Humble Servant  SUSANNA

Fain  _HA  Freeman  in  Black  Dear  Jack  how must I distinguish thee  Sir John  Dear  Jack  How came you and I so well acquainted Fellow  Fain  Oh that's too long a Story at present  Sir John  Fainwell  what the Devil is this  Metamorphose  for  Fain  Love Almighty Love Copying of the  Gods  you know  Sir John  What Game are you in Pursuit of  Fain  The  old standing Dish  a WIFE Here's no Hopes of  War  no  Rising  in View and  Subaltern  's Pay will make a Man  rub but slowly through the World  I have got Leave of my Colonel to be absent from my Post for Two Months in which Time  I intend to make my Fortune  You know the Widow  Headless    Sir John  Very well Ha is not that  her Livery  Fain  Yes faith I march in the Number of her  Retinue    Sir John  To what End  Fain  That's uncertain If you know the  Widow  you are no Stranger to  her Taste  in  Servants    Sir John  I know she keeps none but  awkard Country Things    Fain  Ay and is a perfect  Jockey  in her Family and takes as much Pains to polish her  Train  as they do to break their young  Colts  Now you must know I pass with her for as arrant a  Rustick  as  ever wielded Cudgel at a Country Wake  or  tumbled Girl upon a Haymow    Sir John  But wherein can this advance your Design  Fain  Why you must know I make Love to her  Sir John  Make Love to her what under the Character of a Footman  Fain  No no under the Character of a Gentleman of Fifteen hundred Pounds a Year in  Gloucestershire  of which Country I pretend to be for having Quarter'd heretofore in that Shire I counterfeit the Dialect very well  Sir John  But what Service can this be to you  Fain  Why I write to her as from Mr  Worthy  my Man brings the Letters and I deliver them as  Jeffrey  her Footman and when I find her in Humour I intend to give her my Picture in so simple a Manner that she shall take it all for Gospel  Sir John  But what signifies the Copy How will you introduce the Original  Fain  That has been done already I have made her several Visits My Man is now gone to her with a Letter  Sir John  But suppose she should enquire after this Mr  Worthy  It is an easy Matter to know all the Gentlemen in  Gloucestershire  and what Estates they are possess'd of too  Fain  She can't trap me there if she does For between you and I there is such a Person as Mr  Worthy  Master of the very Estate I mention who has given me Leave to take his Name But I have discover'd since I have been in her House that an  Irish  Baron is my Rival  Sir John  Then you are undone for I am told she declares against Matrimony without a Title Who is he  Fain  My Lord  PharoahBank  I think they call him of the County of  Tipperary    Sir John  I don't remember ever to have heard of any such Nobleman  Fain  Recommended they say by Sir  Philip MoneyLove    Sir John  For which he is to have a valuable Consideration for I am sure he does nothing out of Honour or Honesty I wish thee Success with all my Heart  Fain  I thank you  Freeman  but prithee who are you in Mourning for Is the old Knight at Rest Six Foot deep ha  Jack  Sir John  He has been dead to me these Seven Years but is now so to all the World  Fainwell    Fain  Sir  John  I give thee Joy of Four thousand Pounds  per Annum    Embracing him  Sir John  I hope you'll give me the Estate too  Fainwell  for I assure you I have not one Foot of Land by the Death of my Father  Enter  Sam  Fain  He did not disinherit thee sure  Sir John  Neither better nor worse  Sam  I ever thought my old Master would dye hard and take the Lefthand Road  Sir John  Ha what is  Sam  with you still  Sam  You know Sir I always stick as close to my Masters as their Breeches  Sir John  Ay whilst there is any Money in them but I remember you left me for fear of Starving  Sam  Starving Oh no no Not Starving Sir though I must confess my Waistband was Three Inches too wide for me  Fain  You saucy Rascal ha ha Well did you deliver my Letter  Sam  Yes I did Sir and into the Widow's own Hands and truly by what I can find Sir▪ you have nothing to hope for if I have any Judgment  Fain  Why What have you discover'd  Sam  Why I observ'd when she read your Epistle she smil'd scornfully thus toss'd your Letter upon her Toylet turn'd upon her Heel tipp'd her Maid a Box o' the Ear for Grinning and bad me tell you it required no Answer  Sir John  Cold Comfort  Fain  Not a Jot the less for giving herself that Air But is it possible that pure PartyRage could make thy Father so unkind Sir  John    Sir John  Add to that some little Wildnesses But the main thing that did my Business was this When I found nothing wou'd open his Pursestrings I pretended to embrace his Principles  Sam  I remember that Time Sir We lived in Clover then Many a delicious Morsel of Flesh have I serv'd up and supp'd luxuriously out of your Leavings Sir  Sir John  But as the Devil wou'd have it one Day in my Cups I chanced to stumble into a Nonjuring Meeting with half a Dozen honest Officers at my Back drove out the Congregation ty'd the Parson Neck and Heels lock'd the Door and took the Key in my Pocket  Fain  Good And what became of Old Sedition  Sir John  Some of his Flock returning to Evening Prayer broke open the Door and freed him from Durance amongst which Number was my natural Father  Fain  Rather Unnatural That was very unlucky Sir  John    Sir John  Ay for that Action not only lost me a paternal Blessing but a paternal Estate  Fain  Which would have afforded thee many Blessings Wine and Women Sir  John  the only Blessings in this World So your younger Brother  Ned  has the Estate I suppose  Sir John  Every Acre My Fortune is cramm'd into such a Narrow Circumference I can cover it with my Thumb Only a single Shilling  Fain  Damn'd Barbarity 'S' Death were he my Brother I'd cut his Throat  Sam  There's the Inside of a Soldier for you  aside  Sir John  So say Passion and Necessity but Conscience and Humanity offer to my cooler Thoughts a brown Musquet rather I confess I long to exert the elder Brother and beat him a little In order to which I have done all I could to provoke him to give me Occasion but he avoids me as carefully as if he durst not fight though I know he's no Coward  Fain  Well Heaven be prais'd I am not afraid of being disinherited I wear my Fortune with my Red Coat and whilst there is one Mischiefmaking Priest in the World Soldiers will never want Bread  Sam  Ay the Priests have ever been fast Friends to the Soldiers Nothing like a PulpitDrum But it ruins the Surgeons Business quite  Sir John  Ay how so  Sam  Why where's the Occasion for their retailing Lancet when the other lets the Nation Blood by Wholesale  Fain  My Rascal has a kind of smattering after Wit ha ha No more of your Impertinence  Sam  Impertinence these Gentlemen will allow no body to say a good Thing but themselves  Aside  Sir John  Ha yonder's my Brother coming this Way How stately the Rogue walks with Three Footmen at his Heels  Fain  Whilst thou hast not so much as one Scoundrel to pick up a Wench for thee  Sam  Oh for that Sir with your Leave he may always command his humble Servant  Fain  He struts like an elder Brother He wants nothing but your Title Sir  John    Sir John  I wish I could transfer it for it is of no Use to me Honour's a Commodity not vendable among the Merchants there is no Drawback upon't  Fain  That's a Mistake Sir  John  I have known a Statesman pawn his Honour as often as Merchants enter the same Commodity for Exportation and like them draw it back so cleverly that those who give him Credit upon't never perceiv'd it 'till the Great Man was out of Post  Sir John  Honour's a stale Cheat  Fain  It may pass at Court or the GroomPorter's but no Citizen will lend a Shilling upon it  Enter  Ned Freeman  Ned  Brother Your Servant If this young Fellow had not been in a Livery I should have sworn it had been Ensign  Fainwell  Fain  The very Numerical Person you mention is as you see at your Service Mr  Freeman  I believe you are surpriz'd at the Figure I make but there are Reasons which another time shall be yours In the  mean while I must intreat that wherever you see me you know me for nothing above my present Appearance  Ned  Whatever Design you may have in View it shall never miscarry through any Fault of mine Well how go Matters in the North Captain  Sir John  Your Party perform'd no Wonders there  Ned  Nay if you are entring upon Party Matters good byt'ye You know I always decline Politicks in your Company  Sir John  'Tis the Sign of an ill Cause  Ned  Then Disputes won't mend it Here which Colour would you advise me to for a Wedding Suit  Fain  What just upon the Brink of Matrimony Is it with the  Dutch  Lady you wrote such Panegyricks on when you was in  Holland  Ned  What the old Burgomaster's Daughter of  Haerlem  No no that Affair's ended long since She was a good natur'd fond Fool and to say Truth I did love her but the old Carl her Father did not like a younger Brother for a SoninLaw then and I'm a better Friend to my Country than to take a  Dutch  Wife now I did him one Piece of Service I left some  English  Blood in his Family I met a Gentleman at  Paris  who told me she was brought to Bed of a fine Boy  Sir John  If I mistake not you made that Lady a Promise of Marriage Brother  Ned  Cou'd I do less for a Maidenhead  Fain  It is the Custom in  Holland  after such a Promise the Girl never scruples to go to Bed and thinks herself as much your Wife as if the Parson had said Grace and if ever you are found in that Country their Laws will oblige you to perform Articles  Ned  Ay if they catch me in the Corn let 'em put me in the Pound  Sir John  Whatever you think of such Proceedings I assure you I should have very little Confidence in  that Man who forfeited his Faith and Honour to a Woman  Ned  Preserve your Opinion Brother the Ladies will like you never the better for't Every Female has Vanity enough to believe her Charms sufficient to secure what another lost  Fain  But who is the Object of your present Passion  Sir John  Pray Heaven it proves not where I guess  Aside  Fain  Who is the Beauty that inslaves you now  Ned  Nay I'm not so prodigiously inslav'd as you imagine  Sir John  What and just going to be Married  Sam  Mr  Freeman  speaks like an experienc'd Traveller he is entring upon a Journey for Life the Whip and Spur are for the short Stages of Love It would kill the Devil to ride full Speed down a Lane that has neither End nor Turning  Ned  Ha ha ha  Sam  has a right Notion of Matrimony  Sir John  A Lady must be extremely happy with such a Husband But may we not know the Lady  Ned  Yes Yes Brother I'm not asham'd of the Lady she has Beauty enough for a Wife and One Charm as desirable as a New Mistress  Fain  Videlicet  Ned  Twenty thousand Pounds  Sir John  Ha that one Article strikes through me  Aside  Ned  'Tis Sir  Philip MoneyLove  's Daughter  Sir John  As I imagin'd This Blow wounds deeper than my being disinherited Have you that Lady's Consent Brother  Ned  I have her Father's and he has the Disposal of her Fortune though left by her Grandfather She commands not a Penny if she marries without his Consent  Sir John  A most pernicious Clause Yet if  Louisa  his  Dutch  Mistress who I have sent for comes  Time enough I may chance to spoil your Market  Aside  Ned  I think I stand very fair I have had his Promise these Ten Days  Sir John  Just the Time that Sir  Philip  forbid me his House since when I have often watch'd him in and fearing the Consequence I sent for his Mistress and if there is the least Grain of Vertue left in that Heap of Muck and Immorality Sir  Philip  I may yet prevent this hateful Match  Aside  Fain  I wish you Joy Mr  Freeman    Sir John  Wish him Hell where he may Taste in part the Pains he gives me now  Olivia  Oh my  Olivia    Aside  Ned  My Brother has no Relish for my good Fortune I perceive you affect Gravity in my Company Sir  John  and seem to have no Taste for any Joy of mine Prithee how have I offended You may have Reason to blame our Father perhaps but how is that my Fault I have really as much Love for you as if you had been born a Year after me and will treat you as well  Fain  That is to say he shall live like your Brother  Ned  He shall live as he thinks fit Sir I shan't pretend to direct him  Fain  But you must put it in his Power Come shall I make a Proposal  Ned  Out with it  Fain  Buy him a Colonel's Post in the Guards  Ned  I don't think to part with any Money that way  Sir John  Not without it were to serve a certain Person you know where Oh that vile restless Principle of yours  Ned  Shall never disturb you with a Commission any where Look ye Brother you shan't want for what is Necessary  Sir John  Necessary I suppose you reserve to your own Judgment how far that Word may extend  Ned  It shall extend so far Sir as becomes a Brother who has the Estate to him that has none  Sam  Humph That is as much as to say in plain  English  you may Starve or Steal and be Hang'd for Him  Aside  Sir John  As far as becomes your Elder Brother  Ned  I can't say that for perhaps you may fancy my Estate may become you better than it does me  Sir John  Your  Estate  Going up to him  Sam    Stepping between    Sir Sir With your Leave Whereabouts do you think the Soul of my old Master may be now  Ned  That Thought never enter'd my Head Sirrah I know where his material Soul the Estate is and how to Spend it too So Brother if you will be Chearful  Sir John  Chearful Bid the Directors when there's a Run upon the  Bank  be Chearful the Merchant who hears the Shipwreck of his freighted Vessel or bid the Mother weeping o'er the Corps of her departed Son be ChearfulBid them be Mad rather to avoid ReflectionChearful Quotha  Sam  That's breaking a Man's Legs and then bidding him cut Capers  Aside  Fain  Philosophy is a noble Study Sir  John  ▪ but few of us poor Rogues can pursue it  Sir John  With what Elegance might my Brother there display the Beauty of Patience and Poverty  Ned  No Faith  Jack  I am no Orator  Keeps looking upon the Papers  Sir John  Oh What Serenity of Mind attends Four Thousand Pounds a Year whilst Passion Pride and all the DeadlySins fill up the Train of a poor Dog like me  Sam  That's true to a Tittle I know it by my self  Aside  Sir John  Poor  Olivia  now I understand thy Letter wherein thou saidst That we must part for Ever but I will see Thee now tho' certain Death attend it tho' robb'd of Birthright by this younger Brother let him not hope to take my Mistress from me  Such an Attempt will far more dang'rous prove  He robs me of my Life that robs me of my Love  Exit  Ned  That is the Colour for my Money  Fain  Ay White is the Bridegroom's Colour  Ned  Ha What is my Brother gone  Fain  So it seems Poor Sir  John    Ned  Pox of this Livery I shou'd have been glad we cou'd have Din'd together to Day  Sam  Now you talk of Diningyour Uncle call'd at your Lodging this Morning Sir and bad me tell you he wonders how you bestow your Time that you don't come and Dine with him as usual  Ned  Who's that  Fain  An Uncle of mine to whom I had once some hopes of being Heir  Ned  And what has stifled them  Fain  Why the Devil put Matrimony in his Head and spoil'd my Fortune  Ned  Then he has Children has he  Fain  One which happening to be Redhair'd and the Parson of the Parish being Sandy my Uncle not content with forbidding him his House bid adieu to the Country and brought my Aunt to Town  Sam  An excellent Place to preserve Vertue in  Ned  How came he to suspect the Doctor  Fain  Why my Aunt is a  Roman Catholick  you must know and I suppose my Uncle had a mind to make a good Protestant of her and brought the Doctor to Convert her but finding his Arguments more prevalent for Love than Religion thought fit to remove her  Ned  Ha ha ha Where has he Lodg'd her  Fain  He has taken a House in the  PallMall  within a Door of my Colonel's  Sam  Who has as good a hand at Converting as the Parson if he can find a way to come at her  Aside  Ned  In the  PallMall  If this shou'd be my Mistress now    Aside    So the old Fellow is very Jealous of her you say  Fain  So Jealous that he locks her up it seems resolving to Father no Children for the future but his own He allows her the Sight of nothing that's Male  Ned  It must be she this agrees exactly with her Story    Aside    Such Restraint sets all the Wheels of Invention at Work and a Million to Nothing but she'll find a way to use him as he deserves And how does she take it  Sam  Oh not at all SirYou hear my Master say she's Lock'd up  Ned  Her Confinement I mean Sirrah  Sam  Oh her Confinement  Fain  Not seeing her the last Time I din'd there I inquir'd after her Health and was answer'd she was Indispos'd yet I observ'd he cut her a Plate of ev'ry thing that came to the Table and sent up to her Chamber which as the Maid told me afterwards is his constant Custom of late when any body Dines with him He is a true  Spanish  Husband  Ned  And if she proves but a true  English  Wife his Children may be nothing akin to him for all his Caution Is she handsome  Fain  So handsome that I could venture my Soul with her and if I had her Consent my Uncle  Watchit  should be advanced in HonoursYou understand me  Ned  Watchit  Mum that's the Name  Fainwell  must not know where I live    Aside    You would not Cuckold your Uncle would ye  Fain  Why not I think a  well bred  Gentleman ought to have as much regard to the Breed of his  Family as a  FoxHunter  has to those of his Dogs and Horses Where do you Lodge Mr  Freeman  I must bring a SchoolFellow of mine to wait on you one who has a Play upon the Stocks You must give him leave to Dedicate to you It is young  Distich    Ned  Ha Little  Distich  I shall be glad to see him When I have finish'd an Affair which I have upon my Hands at present I shall come somewhere to this End of the Town but I am  Incog  for a little while  Fain  What are you upon an Intrigue  Ned  Yes Faith and with one of the prettiest Women in Town a Citizen's Wife whose Husband is Tinctur'd with thy Uncle's Distemper He permits her neither to pay or receive Visits but in spight of his  Blockade  I have found means to open a  Communication  between my Self and his Female and hope I shall be able to spring a  Mine  and blow up the  Fort  of her Chastity maugre all his Iron Guards  Fain  You talk like an Engineer Mr  Freeman  but if she is so closely confin'd how got you acquainted with her  Ned  Very accidentally You must know her House and That which I lodge in were formerly one so that there are Doors remaining tho' fasten'd upSitting one Evening in my Chamber reading I heard the Voice of Women and found by their Discourse 'twas a Lady complaining to her Maid of her Husband's ill Usage If I were in your place says the Maid I'd be reveng'd of the old Brute Ay quoth the Lady but shew me the MeansUpon which having bor'd a Hole in the Door I put my Mouth to it and cry'd The Means is ready Madam if you'll Consent to it She was a little surpriz'd at first but we soon came to a right Understanding  Fain  Ha ha so she open'd the Door  Ned  Not that Door But the ChamberMaid who knew her Business perfectly well after inquiring who Lodg'd at next House in the Morning knock'd  gently at this private Door and calling me by my Name gave me to understand that there was a Door between her Room and a Garret in our House which if I cou'd find the way to open I might have an Opportunity of playing a Game at Picquet with her Lady sometimes in her Master's Absence I took the Hint agreed with my Landlord for that Garret and fell to work immediately The Passage was soon open'd and we came to an Interview lik'd one another's Proposals call'd for the Cards and sat down to Play where I had the Game all to Nothing having  Point Quint  and  Quatorze  the first Deal had not the old Fellow come in and forc'd us to throw up our Cards  Fain  For which you both curs'd him I suppose but you have found a Time 'tis to be hop'd to finish your Game  Ned  I shall do this Day I believe Wish me Success  Fainwell    Fain  I do with all my Heart I know you us'd to be Generous you'll not expose her When you have corrupted her you may help your Friends before she falls into the Hands of the Publick  Ned  With all my Heart Now for the finishing Stroke I'll Home and watch the old Fellow out and then L'  Affair il sera fait  as the  French  say Which way are you going  Fainwell  Fain  Every way I have some Twenty Howd'ye's to deliver the constant Business of Men of my Cloth you know  Ned  Ha yonder comes my Fatherinlaw that is to be I must avoid him  Fain  And the Widow's Lord with him  Aside  Pray who is the Gentleman with him Mr  Freeman  Ned  His Name is  Bite  to the best of my Memory He belongs to a  PharoahTable  I us'd to see him Tally sometimes that's all I know of him Adieu  Exit  Fain  I'm glad I know so much of him  Bite  Quotha Egad I'll take care he shan't Bite me of the Widow Is this her Man of Quality  Sam  go you home and don't you be out of the way if I shou'd want you Do you hear  Sam  Yes yes Sir  Exit  Sam  Fain  Egad this Woman fatigues me more than a long March But the Hopes of her Gold like the Hopes of Plunder give me fresh Courage for continuing the Siege  Still to Besiege and Storm the Soldier's Trade is  In  War  to carry Towns In  Peace  the Ladies  ACT II  SCENE Sir  Philip Moneylove  's House  Enter  Olivia  and  Louisa  weeping    Oli  _YOUR Story Madam I confess is moving but I am more surpriz'd at  Freeman  's Insensibility than at his Perjury It is no wonder to find a Man false but that he should be Blind to so much Beauty is an Argument of Stupidity  Lou
