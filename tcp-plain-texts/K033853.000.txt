 BRAGANZA  A TRAGEDY  PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURYLANE  WRITTEN BY ROBERT JEPHSON ESQ  LONDON Printed for T EVANS near YorkBuildings in the Strand AND T DAVIES in RusselStreet CoventGarden M DCC LXXV  Price One Shilling and SixPence  TO LADY VISCOUNTESS NUNEHAM  MADAM  I HAVE many reasons to be flattered with the public reception of this Tragedy yet I confess my solicitude for its reputation extends further  Your Ladyship's having permitted me the honour of inscribing it to you will in some measure gratify my ambition by recommending it to the reader whose judgment is not influenced by the adventitious assistance of theatrical decorations and the graces of action  Where your Ladyship's name appears as a patroness merit will be expected and where there is a wish to find any probably none will pass unnoticed  Whatever motive may be assigned for this Address my principal purpose will be fully answered if your Ladyship accepts it as a testimony of my gratitude for the favours I have received from the Noble Family to which you are so happily united and of the perfect esteem and respect of  MADAM  Your Ladyship's Much obliged and Most obedient Humble Servant ROBERT JEPHSON  Dublin Castle  Febr  PROLOGUE  Written by ARTHUR MURPHY Esq  SPOKEN BY MR PALMER  WHILE in these days of sentiment and grace  Poor comedy in tears resigns her place  And smit with novels full of maxims crude  She that was frolick once now turns a prude  To her great end the tragic muse aspires  At Athens born and faithful to her sires  The comic sister in hysteric fit  You'd swear has lost all memory of wit  Folly for her may now exult on high  Feather'd by ridicule no arrows fly  But if you are distress'd she's sure to cry  She that could jig and nickname all heav'n's creatures  With sorrows not her own deforms her features  With stale reflections keeps a constant pother  Greece gave her one face and she makes another  So very pious and so full of woe  You well may bid her "To a nunnery go"  Not so Melpomene to nature true  She holds her own great principle in view  She from the first when men her pow'r confest  When grief and terror seiz'd the tortur'd breast  She made to strike her moral to the mind  The stage the great tribunal of mankind  Hither the worthies of each clime she draws  Who founded states or rescued dying laws  Who in base times a life of glory led  And for their country who have toil'd or bled  Hither they come again they breathe they live  And virtue's meed through ev'ry age receive  Hither the murd'rer comes with ghastly mien  And the fiend conscience hunts him o'er the scene  None are exempted all must reappear  And even kings attend for judgement here  Here find the day when they their pow'r abuse  Is a scene furnish'd to the tragic muse  Such is her art weaken'd perhaps at length  And while she aims at beauty losing strength  Oh when resuming all her native rage  Shall her true energy alarm the stage  This night a bardour hopes may rise too high  'Tis yours to judge'tis yours the cause to try  This night a bard as yet unknown to fame  Once more we hope will rouze the genuine flame  His no French play tame polish'd dull by rule  Vigorous he comes and warm from Shakespeare's school  Inspir'd by him he shews in glaring light  A nation struggling with tyrannic might  Oppression rushing on with giant strides  A deep conspiracy which virtue guides  Heroes for freedom who dare strike the blow  A tablature of honour guilt and woe  If on his canvass nature's colours shine  You'll praise the hand that trac'd the just design  EPILOGUE  By a FRIEND  SPOKEN BY MRS YATES  IS it permitted in this age severe  For female softness to demand a tear  Is it allow'd in such censorious days  For female virtue to solicit praise  Dares manly sense beneath a tender form  Presume to dictate and aspire to warm  May so unnatural a being venture  As a true heroine on the stage to enter  No says a wit made up of French grimaces  Yet selfordain'd the highpriest of the graces  Women are playthings for our idle hours  Their souls unfinish'd and confin'd their pow'rs  Loquacious vain by slight attentions won  By flattery gain'd and by untruths undone  Or should some grave great plan engage their minds  The first caprice can give it to the winds  And the chief stateswoman of all the sex  Grows nervous if a fop or pimple vex  Injurious slandersin Louisa's air  Behold th' exemplar of a perfect fair  Just tho' aspiring merciful tho' brave  Sincere tho' politic and tho' fond no slave  In danger calm and smiling in success  But as securing ampler means to bless  Nor think as Zeuxis for a faultless piece  Cull'd various charms from various nymphs of Greece  Our bard has center'd in one beauteous whole  The rays that gleam thro' many a separate soul  On Britain's and Ierne's shores he saw  The models of the fair he dar'd to draw  True virtue in these isles has fix'd her throne  And many a bright Louisa is our own

LEMOS  and  COREA  following  RIBIRO  at a little Distance  RIBIRO  HOLD officerWhat means this spectacle  Why lead you thus in fetters thro' the streets  These aged citizens  OFFICER  Behold this order  shews a paper  RIBIRO  I know the character 'Tis signed Velasquez  st CITIZEN  We have not mines of unexhausted gold  To feed rapacious Spain and stern Velasquez  And wrung by hard exactions for the state  OFFICER  No moreI must not suffer it  RIBIRO  pointing to the prisoners  Pray Sir  See these white hairs these shacklesMisery  May sure complainYou are a soldier Sir  Your mien bespeaks a brave one  OFFICER  I will walk by  Detain them not too long'Tis a harsh sentence  Officer withdraws a little  d CITIZEN  O good Ribiro what have we deserved  That these rude chains shou'd gall us  RIBIRO  What deserved  st CITIZEN  The little all our industry had earn'd  To smooth the bed of sickness nurse old age  And give a decent grave to our cold ashes  Spain's hungry minions have already seized  RIBIRO  I know the restDry up these scalding tears  The hour of your deliv'rance is at hand  An arm more strong than shuts your prison doors  Shall burst them soon and give you ample vengeance  CITIZENS  May we indeed expect  RIBIRO  Most sureBut hush  Resume the semblance of this transient shame  And hide your hope in sadnessBrave Castilian  Thanks for this courtesy  To the Officer who returns  CITIZENS  Lead onFarewell  Exeunt Guard and Citizens  LEMOS  and  COREA  come forward to  RIBIRO  RIBIRO  Was that a fight for Lisbon  LEMOS  O shame shame  What crime cou'd they commitOld helpless plunder'd  RIBIRO  Even thoughts are crimes in this distemper'd state  They once had wealth as you haveSpain thought meet  To seize itThey rash men have dar'd to murmur  Velasquez hereour scourgeKing Philip's idol  Whom Portugal must bow tomildly dooms them  But to perpetual bondage for this treason  LEMOS  We must be patient'Tis a cureless evil  RIBIRO  Is patience then the only virtue left us  Come come there is a remedy more manly  COREA  Wou'd it were in our reach  RIBIRO  Look here I grasp it  Laying his hand on his sword  What turned to statues Hence enfranchisement  If the quick fire that lately warm'd your breasts  Already wastes to embersAm I rash  We touch'd this theme beforeYou felt it then  Wou'd I cou'd put a tongue in every ingot  That now lies pil'd within your massy stores  Your gold perhaps might move youSpain will seize it  Then bid you mourn the loss in the next dungeon  Or dig her mines for moreIs't not enough  Instruct me Lemos you good Corea teach me  This meekness so convenient to our foes  Or pierce this swelling bosom  LEMOS  Who can teach it  'Tis not in art RibiroKnow us better  The canker discontent consumes within  And mocks our smooth exterior  COREA  Hear me for both  For all th' indignant hearts in Portugal  If curses sped like plagues and pestilence  Thus wou'd I strike them at the towers of Spain  May her swoln pride burst like an empty bubble  Distraction rend her councils route and shame  Pursue her flying squadronsTempests scatter  And whirlpools swallow up her full man'd navies  Bold insurrection spread thro' all her states  Shaking like pentup winds their loose allegiance  All Europe arm and every frowning king  Point at one foe and let that foe be Spain  RIBIRO  O be that curse propheticHere 'tis dangerous  Nor will the time allow to tell you all  But thus far rest assured I speak not rashly  A project is on foot and now just rip'ning  Will give our indignation nobler scope  Than tears or curses priests and womens weapons  All that secures the event of great designs  Sage heads firm hearts and executing arms  In formidable union league with us  And chain capricious fortune to our standard  LEMOS  Say can our aid promote this glorious cause  RIBIRO  All private virtue is the public fund  As that abounds the state decays or thrives  Each shou'd contribute to the general stock  And who lends most is most his country's friend  LEMOS  O wou'd Braganza meet the people's wish  RIBIRO  He is not yet resolvedbut may be won  Cou'd I assure him men like you but wish'd it  For well he knows and loves you Trust me Lemos  It wou'd do more to knit him to this cause  Than legions of our hot nobility  COREA  We love his virtuewill support his rights  RIBIRO  Then shew it by your deedsYour artizans  Are prompt bold hardy fond of violence  Alarm their slumb'ring courage rouse their rage  Wake their dulled senses to the shame and scorn  That hisses in the ears of willing bondmen  If they will hazard one bold stroke for freedom  A leader shall be found a bravea just one  Anon expect me where the ivied arch  Rears the bold image of our late Braganza  In sullen discontent he seems to frown  As if still hostile to the foes of Lisbon  There we'll discourse at largeAlmada comes  LEMOS  Is he a friend  RIBIRO  A firm oneNo dishonour  E'er bow'd that rev'rend headThat mighty spirit  When first the oppressor like a flood o'erwhelm'd us  Rear'd high his country's standard and defied him  He comes to seek meLose no timeRemember  Exeunt Lemos and Corea  RIBIRO  alone  I shou'd detest my zeal cou'd it be stir'd  Against the wholesome rigour of restraint  Licentiousness made needfulBut good Heaven  Foul murders unprovok'd delib'rate cruelty  The God within us must rise up against it  Enter  ALMADA  ALMADA  Well met RibiroWhat new proselytes  Thy ardor every hour or finds or makes them  RIBIRO  Nothank the Spaniards for our proselytes  Scarce half an hour ago two citizens  My blood still boils by fell Velasquez order  Were drag'd to prison  ALMADA  Spare my soul Ribiro  Superfluous detestation of that villain  RIBIRO  Knowing this way they were to pass I brought  Lemos and Corea whom last night I founded  That their own eyes might see the outrages  Men of their order must expect to meet  From power that knows no bounds and owns no law  ALMADA  'Twas wisely done for minds of coarse alloy  But bluntly feel the touch of others wrongs  Tho' deep they take the impression of their own  RIBIRO  By heav'n their fury bore a nobler stamp  Their honest rage glow'd on their kindling cheeks  Broke thro' the cold restraints of coward caution  And swell'd even to an eloquence of anger  ALMADA  'Tis wellBut are they yet inform'd how near  Th' approaching hour decisive of our fate  That gives us death or freedomthat the dawn  RIBIRO  Not yet They still believe the Duke at noon  But visits Lisbon to command the march  Of our new levies to the Spanish bounds  Himself to follow streightEre then I mean  Again to see them and still more to whet  The keeness of their hate against our tyrants  At least a thousand follow where they lead  ALMADA  Their boldness well directed may do much  RIBIRO  That care be mineI've studiedand I know them  Inconstant sanguine easily inflam'd  But like the nitrous powder uncompress'd  Consuming by the blaze nought but itself  'Tis ours to charge the mine with deadly skill  And bury usurpation in the ruin  ALMADA  I think we cannot failOur friends are firm  Honour will bind the nobleHope the weak  And common interest allThe insulting Spaniard  Broods over embryo mischiefs nor suspects  The wretched worm conceals a mortal sting  To pierce the haughty heel that tramples him  RIBIRO  How great will be our triumph Spain's disgrace  When ev'ry mischief that perfidious court  Has fram'd against Braganza's precious life  Recoils on the contriver  ALMADA  Urge that home  Urge how the Duke's affection to his country  His right unquestionable to her crown  First mark'd him for the victim of false Spain  That his commission as high admiral  His general's staff and all the lofty pomp  Of his high sounding titles were but meant  As gilded snares to invite him to his death  RIBIRO  These truths shameful to Philip must be told  They will endear Don Juan to the people  Will keep them waking restless and dispos'd  To aid the glorious tumult of tomorrow  ALMADA  My heart expands and with a prophet's fire  Seizes the bright reversion of our hopes  I see the genius of our realm restor'd  And smiling lead him to his rightful throne  No wild ambition like a pamper'd steed  O'erleaps the boundaries of law and reason  And tramples every seed of social virtue  But o'er the temp'rate current of his blood  The gentlest passions brush their breezy wings  To animate but not disturb the stream  Such is his temperThe approaching hour  Demands perhaps a sterner  RIBIRO  Heaven still kind  Has in his confort's breast struck deep the root  Of each aspiring virtueBright Louisa  To all the softness of her tender sex  Unites the noblest qualities of man  A genius to embrace the amplest scheme  That ever swell'd the labouring statesman's breast  Judgment most sound persuasive eloquence  To charm the froward and convince the wise  Pure piety without religion's dross  And fortitude that shrinks at no disaster  ALMADA  She is indeed a wonder O Ribiro  That woman was the spring that mov'd us all  She canvass'd all our strength urged all our wrongs  Combin'd our force and methodized our vengeance  Taught us that ends which seem impossible  Are lost or compass'd only by the means  That fortune is a false divinity  But folly worships what the wise man makes  She turn'd our cold dejection to device  And rous'd despondency to active valour  My age delights to dwell on her perfections  RIBIRO  And I could ever hear themVirtue's praise  To honest ears is music But no more  A noise comes this way and that hurrying throng  Proclaims the upstart Minister's approach  This is the hour with fancy pageantry  Thro' our thin'd streets he takes his wonted round  Like the dire clapping of the harpy's wing  To choak the frugal meal with bitter tears  And scare content from every humble board  I will avoid him But I go proud man  When next we meet to make my presence dreadful  Exit Ribiro  ALMADA  alone  Honest RibiroTo this hour my soul  Has kept her purpose my firm foot has ne'er  Swerv'd from its path in Lisbon nor shall now  Give way to insolenceYour country's dregs  Looking towards the train of Velasquez  Ye supple sycophants Ay cringe and beg  That he will tread upon your prostrate necks  Or ride you like his mulesAuthority  Thy worship'd symbols round a villain's trunk  Provoke men's mockery not their reverence  OFFICER  entering  Make way thereroom room for the Minister  Know you the lord Velasquez comes this way  To Almada  Pray Sir give place  ALMADA  Officious varlet off  Let not thy servile touch pollute my robe  Can hirelings frown  Enter  VELASQUEZ  and  PIZARRO  The Magistrates of Lisbon with their Insignia Guards and Attendants preceding  VELASQUEZ  looking sternly at Almada  How Am I then despised  A tumult in my presenceGood my lord  It better wou'd become your gravity  To set the fair example of obedience  To trust and office than instruct the rabble  In what they are the most prone to feuds and faction  ALMADA  Most reverend admonition Hold my spleen  Ye golden coronets and ermin'd robes  Bend from your stools behold this wond'rous man  This Lusitanian censor this sage Cato  This consul with his lictors rods and axes  Reprove the boy Almada for his lightness  PIZARRO  Regard not his wild words he's old and choleric  VELASQUEZ    To his train    Attend me at the citadelMove on  Exeunt attendants  I know not whether to accuse my fortune  Or blame my own demerits brave Almada  That ever when we meet thy angry brow  Rebukes me with its frown or keen reproach  Darts from thy tongue and checks the forward wish  That fain wou'd court thy friendship and esteem  ALMADA  Friendship with theeIs it so slight a boon  If such deserve the name go seek for friends  Amidst the desp'rate crew whose only bond  Is the black conscience of confederate crimes  Nor in prepost'rous union think to join  Integrity with guilt and shame with honour  Know me for what I amthy foe profess'd  Fall on thy kneesolicit Heaven for mercy  And tell that seat of pride thy obdurate he art  Its last its only virtue isremorse  Exit Almada  Manent  VELASQUEZ  and  PIZARRO  VELASQUEZ  Go hoary fool preach to the whistling winds  I scorn thy council and defy thy hate  'Tis time enough for lagging penitence  When age like thine has quench'd ambition's flame  Now nobler thoughts possess my active soul  This haughty province first shall feel my weight  And since it scorns my love thro' fear obey me  PIZARRO  Already all the power of Spain is thine  The Vice Queen Marg'ret tho' of Austrian blood  Discreet firm virtuous complains in vain  You leave her but a regent's empty title  While power is only yoursAnd happier still  Braganza summon'd to attend the King  Will soon cut off his country's only hope  And leave no rival to obscure thy lustre  'Bate but the shew and name of royalty  Thou art already King  VELASQUEZ  The shew the name  All that gives grace and awe to majesty  Shall soon be mine PizarroOlivarez  Whose counsels rule the Escurial to my hand  Has long resign'd the reins of Portugal  And dreams not unsuspicious of my faith  The Delegate the creature of his breath  Anon will bid defiance to his power  And rank himself with monarchs  PIZARRO  O take heed  Consider Sir that power still awes the world  VELASQUEZ  My towering fortune rises on a rock  And firm as Atlas will defy the storm  The purple cement of a Prince's blood  Shall strengthen its foundation  PIZARRO  Ha  VELASQUEZ  Braganza's  The precious mischief swells my exulting breast  And soon shall burst its prison  PIZARRO  Can it be  I know thy dauntless temper mocks at fear  And prudence guides thy daringBut a Prince  Follow'd by faithful guardsencompass'd round  With troops of gallant friendsthe people's idol  VELASQUEZ  Is mortal like the meanest of his train  And dies before tomorrowCease to wonder  But when this mighty ruin shakes the realm  Prepare like me with welldissembled grief  To hide our real joy and blind suspicion  Flourish of trumpets  These trumpets speak his entrance never more  Such sprightly notes nor shout of joyful friends  Paean or choral song shall usher him  But sad solemnity of funeral pomp  Mute sorrow mournful dirges ghastly rites  Marshal'd by death in comfortless array  Wait his cold relics to their sepulchre  End of the First  ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  An Antichamber in the Duke of  BRAGANZA  's Palace  RIBIRO MENDOZA  RIBIRO  A Moment's pause Mendoza here appointed  By promise to the Duke at noon to wait him  I could not mingle with his followers  So saw it but in part  MENDOZA  The air still rings  With loudest acclamations  RIBIRO  Yes Mendoza  With joy I heard themheard the vaulted sky  Echo Braganza'Twas no hireling noise  No faction's roar of mercenary joy  Sound without transportbut the heartfelt cry  Of a whole nation's welcome Hear it Spain  Proud usurpation hear it  MENDOZA  The whole way  Was cover'd thick with panting multitudes  That scarce left passage for their chariot wheels  The trees were bent with people ev'ry roof  Dome temple portico so closely fill'd  The gazers made the wonder Here and there  A discontented Spaniard stalk'd along  Should'ring the crowd and with indignant scorn  Turn'd up his sallow cheek in mockery  RIBIRO  We shall retort their scornMark'd you the Duke  His mind is ever letter'd in his face  MENDOZA  Pleasure was mingled with anxiety  Both visible at once But O what words  Can paint the angel form that grac'd his side  His bright Louisa like th' Olympian Queen  When o'er her fragrant bosom Venus bound  Th' enchanting Cestusfrom her lucid eyes  Stream'd the pure beams of soft benevolence  And glories more than mortal shone around her  Harmonious sounds of dulcet instruments  Swell'd by the breath or swept from tuneful wire  Floated in airwhile yellow Tagus burn'd  With prows of flaming gold their painted flags  In gandy frolick fluttering to the breeze  On to their palace thus the triumph came  Alighted at the gate the princely pair  Express'd their thanks in silent dignity  Of gesture far more eloquent than words  Then turn'd them from the throng  RIBIRO  Why this looks well  The Duke will sure be rous'd to resolution  By this bright presage of his coming glory  MENDOZA  With grief I learn he still is undetermin'd  His fears prevail against the public wish  And thus the illpois'd scale of our fair hopes  Mounts light and unsubstantial  RIBIRO  O you wrong him  I know his noble natureJuan's heart  Pants not with selfish fearHis wife his friends  An infant family a kingdom's fate  More than his own besiege his struggling soul  He must be more than man who will not hear  Such powerful calls and less who can despise them  MENDOZA  Indeed I cannot wonder he's disturb'd  But doubts are treason in a cause like this  RIBIRO  Dismiss these fearsLouisa's gentle sway  Will fix him to our purpose Night's chaste orb  Rules not the heavings of the restless tide  More sure than she with mild ascendancy  Can govern all his ebbs and flows of passion  But come by this time the fond multitude  Have gaz'd away their longing and retire  Our greeting will be seasonable now  Exeunt  SCENE II  A magnificent Chamber in the Duke of  BRAGANZA'  s Palace The Duke speaking to  LEMOS  and  COREA  Other Citizens at a little Distance  DUKE  No more kind countrymenThis goodness melts me  What can I render back for all these honours  This wond'rous prodigality of praise  What but my life whene'er your wellfare asks it  LEMOS  Heav'n guard that precious life for Portugal  To you as to a tutelary God  This sinking country lifts her suppliant hands  And certain of your strength implores your arm  To raise her prostrate genius from the dust  DUKE  A private man a subject like yourselves  Bankrupt of power though rich in gratitude  The sense of what you suffer wrings my soul  Nor makes your sorrows less  DUTCHESS  Much injur'd men  Whom love not fear should governfrom this hour  Know we espouse your causeWe have not hearts  Of aliens to behold with passing glance  And cold indifference the ruthless spoiler  Smile o'er the ravage of your fertile plains  We feel the fetters that disgrace your limbs  We mourn the vigour of your minds depress'd  With horror we behold your gen'rous blood  Drain'd by the infatiate thirst of ravening wolves  If we have nature we must feel your wrongs  If we have power redress them  COREA  Matchless lady  There spoke our rightful Queen our better angel  In us behold your servants subjects soldiers  Though yet unpractis'd in the trade of war  Our swords will find an edge at your command  DUKE  We neither doubt your courage nor your love  And both perhaps ere long may meet the trial  I would detain youbut our conference  Might now be dangerousRank me with your friends  And know I have a heart for Portugal  Exeunt Lemos Corea c  Manent  DUKE  and  DUTCHESS  DUTCHESS  Why wears my Juan's brow that thoughtful cloud  Why thus with downcast look and folded arms  When ev'ry other bosom swells with hope  When expectation like a fiery steed  Anticipates the course and pants to hear  The sprightly signal start him for the goal  Think that the people from their leader's eye  Catch the sure omens of their future fate  With his their courage falls their spirits rise  For confidence is conquest's harbinger  DUKE  Light of thy Juan's life My soul's best joy  Swifter than meteors glide or wings of wind  My nimble thoughts shoot thro' their whirling round  A thousand cares distract this anxious breast  To recompense the dark uncertainty  Of this dread interval 'twixt now and morn  Would ask whole years of happiness to come  Now thou art mine these faithful arms enfold thee  But oh tomorrow may behold thee torn  By barbarous ruffians from their fond embrace  The flowing honours of that beauteous head  May sweep a scaffold's dust and iron death  Close in eternal sleep those radiant eyes  That beam with love and joy unutterable  DUTCHESS  O make me not your curse as sure I must be  The stain the blot of your immortal fame  If one soft passion like a languid spell  Dissolve thy manly fortitude of soul  And melt the prince and patriot in the husband  DUKE  That tender union is the healing balm  The cordial of my soulour destinies  Are twin'd togetherWere my single life  The only forfeit of this perilous chance  I'd throw it like a heedless prodigal  And wanton with my fortuneBut alas  More than the wealth of worlds is now at stake  And can I hazard this dear precious pledge  Venture my all of bliss on one bold cast  Nor feel the conflict that now rends my heart  DUTCHESS  Why do you trembleThese cold struggling drops  DUKE  They fall for thee Louisamy quell'd spirit  Avows its weakness there  DUTCHESS  'Tis cruel fondness  It wounds me deeply Juan  DUKE  Witness honour  Thy martial call ne'er found Braganza's ear  Cold till this bitter momentI have met  Nay courted death in the steel'd files of war  When squadrons wither'd as the giant trod  Nor shrunk ev'n when the hardiest in the field  Have paused upon the dangerHere I own  My agonizing nerves degrade the soldier  Ev'n to a coward's frailtyShould the sword  Which black destruction soon may wave o'er all  Avert it Heaven strike at thy precious life  Should but one drop forc'd by rude violence  Stain that dear bosom I were so accurs'd  The outstretch'd arm of mercy could not save me  DUTCHESS  I have a woman's form a woman's fears  I shrink from pain and start at dissolution  To shun them is great Nature's prime command  Yet summon'd as we are your honour pledg'd  Your own just rights engag'd your country's fate  Let threat'ning death assume his direst form  Let dangers multiply still would I on  Still urge exhort confirm thy constancy  And though we perish'd in the bold attempt  With my last breath I'd bless the glorious cause  And think it happiness to die so nobly  DUKE  O thou hast roused meFrom this hour I banish  Each fond solicitude that hover'd round thee  Thy voicethy looksthy soul are heav'n's own fire  'Twere impious but to doubt that pow'r ordain'd thee  To guide me to this glorious enterprize  DUTCHESS  Thou shalt be chronicl'd to latest time  Heaven's chosen instrument to punish tyrants  The great restorer of a nation's freedom  Thou shalt complete what Brutus but attempted  Nor withering age nor cold oblivion's shade  Nor envy's cank'rous tooth shall blast thy wreaths  But every friend to virtue shall inscribe  To Juan's name eternal monuments  But see our friends approach awhile I leave thee  Remember stillthou must be king or nothing  Exit Dutchess  DUKE  alone  I will suppress th' emotions of my heart  Quite to subdue them is impossible  Enter  RIBIRO  and  MENDOZA  Welcome ye wakeful guardians of your country  Had we in all the people's mighty mass  But twenty spirits match'd with you in virtue  How might we bid defiance to proud Spain  How scorn the close disguise of secret councils  And challenge their full force in open combat  RIBIRO  Led by Don Juan can we doubt th' event  All things conspireAntipathy to Spain  Is here hereditary'Tis nature's instinct  'Tis principle religion vital heat  Old men to list'ning sons with their last breath  Bequeath it as a dying legacy  Infants imbibe it at the mother's breast  It circles with their blood spreads with their frame  Its fountain is the heart and till that fails  The stream it fed can never cease to flow  MENDOZA  That furious impulse gives the spleen of fiends  To softest tempers the unpractis'd arm  Sinews with lion's strength and drives us on  Resistless as the sweeping whirlwind's force  DUKE  All is propitious Every post is fill'd  With officers devoted to our service  Already in their hearts they own my title  And wait but for our orders to proclaim it  Enter  ALMADA  DUKE  Come to my breast my sage admonisher  The tutor and example of my arms  The proud Iberian soon shall feel their force  And learn from Juan's sword to venerate  The fame of brave Almada  ALMADA  Thus my prince  Thus did I hope to find thee Hence no more  Shall hard exactions grind the prostrate people  Our gentry to their provinces confin'd  Languish no more in shameful circumscription  No more our ancient noblemen be stripp'd  Of all but empty titles tinsel names  Like tarnish'd gold on rags to mock the wearer  Our posts of eminence no more be filled  With upstart strangers or the sordid lees  Of base plebian natives  DUKE  My impatient breast  Full of the expected joy like a young bridegroom  Upbraids the lazy hours that lag between  My wishes and enjoymentThe onset is  ALMADA  When St Lazar beats five about that hour  We'll welcome the sun's rising with an offering  More glorious than the Persians Hecatomb  RIBIRO  At night your friends assemble with Almada  In dreadful secrecy Then with rais'd arm  We rush to cancel our long debt to vengeance  And glut our thirsty blades with Spanish gore  ALMADA  If we suspend the blow beyond tomorrow  All may be lost Three thousand veterans  Lye canton'd on the river's southern side  Should our design be known they will be call'd  To reinforce the posts and guard the city  Adieu then to our dream of liberty  We rivet closer chains on Portugal  And drag the doom of traytors on ourselves  Enter  DUTCHESS  DUTCHESS  Suspend your consultations for a moment  Within the minister of Spain attends  Forgive th' officious love of your Louisa  No stranger to his arts she warns her Juan  DUKE  I know he comes in solemn mockery  To make a hollow tender of his service  With most obsequious falshood  DUTCHESS  My best Lord  Hold strictest watch on all your words and motions  Guard every look with that discerning villain  Subtle infiduous false and plausible  He can with ease assume all outward forms  Seem the most honest plain sincere good man  And keep his own designs lock'd close within  While with the lynx's beam he penetrates  The deep reserve of every other breast  DUKE  I too will wear my vizor in the scene  And play the dupe I am notFriends farewell  Perhaps ere morning we may meet again  The hour is fix'd Louisaall prepar'd  DUTCHESS  Then this is our last night of slavery  A brighter aera rises with the dawn  Exit Duke  If we may dare without impiety  To challenge heavenly aid and swell the breast  With confidence of more than mortal vigour  Can Heaven stand neuter in a cause like this  Or favour fraud oppression cruelty  Now gentle friends I am a suitress to you  ALMADA  You are our sovereign madam'tis your right  Not to solicit but command our duty  DUTCHESS  Think me not light capricious variable  If I who urg'd ye to this bold attempt  And ever when your anger seem'd to cool  Pour'd oil to wake the flame and feed its blaze  Now supplicate with milder earnestness  And strive to allay its fury  ALMADA  Speak your

VELASQUEZ PIZARRO  PIZARRO  YOU seem disturb'd  VELASQUEZ  With reasondull Braganza  Must have been tutor'dAt our interview  I practis'd every supple artifice  That glides into man's bosomThe return  Was blank reserve ambiguous compliment  And hatred thinly veil'd by ceremony  PIZARRO  Might I presume  VELASQUEZ  Pizarro I am stung  His father Theodosius that proud Prince  Who durst avow his enmity to Philip  And menac'd thunders at my destin'd head  With all his empty turbulence of rage  Cou'd never move me like the calm disdain  Of this cold blooded Juan  PIZARRO  Then my Lord  Your purpose holds  VELASQUEZ  It doesI will dispatch  This tow'ring Duke who keeps the cheek of Spain  Pale with perpetual danger  PIZARRO  For what end  Unconscious of his fate he blindly speeds  To find a grave in SpainWhy then resolve  To spill that blood which elsewhere will be shed  Without your crime or peril  VELASQUEZ  That's the question  Were I assur'd they meant his death 'twere needless  But when they draw him once from Portugal  Where only he is dangerous then perhaps  Their fears or lenity may let him live  And while he lives my fiery course is check'd  My sun climbs slowly never can ascend  To its meridian brightness  PIZARRO  Still my Lord  My short lin'd wisdom cannot sound your depth  VELASQUEZ  I mean to tell thee all for thou may'st aid me  And thy tried faith deserves my confidence  PIZARRO  I am your own for everYour kind hand  Bounteous beyond my merit planted here  Favours innumerable  VELASQUEZ  Think them little  An earnest not the acquittal of my love  The enormous wealth of Juan's royal house  His large domains extended influence  His numerous vassals so have swell'd his state  That were his means but push'd to one great end  How easy might he wrest this realm from Spain  And brave King Philip's rage  PIZARRO  Good careless prince  Mild and uxorious No ambitious dream  Disturbs his tranquil slumber  VELASQUEZ  Just his nature  On household wing he flutters round the roof  That with the princely eagle might have soar'd  And met the dazzling sun Now by his death  My engine cannot fail this night he meets it  His wealth his mightiness his followers  Become Louisa's dowerWhat think'st thou now  Cou'd I but win her to accept my hand  And much my art will move and more my power  Might not our union like the impetuous course  Of blending torrents break all feeble mounds  Spain cou'd oppose to bar me from the crown  That once obtain'd let Olivarez rail  Let his inglorious master call me traitor  I'll scorn their idle fury  PIZARRO  Still I fear  Louisa's heart cold and impenetrable  To all but Juan's love will own no second  Tho' big ambition swells her female breast  Beyond the sex's softness  VELASQUEZ  My hope rests  Even on that favourite passionGrief at first  Will drive her far from love A second flame  Perhaps may ne'er rekindle in her heart  Yet give her momentary frenzy scope  It wastes itself ambition then regains  Its wonted force and winds her to my lure  But comeI must not lose these precious moments  The Fates are busy nowWhat's yet untold  There place thyself and learnTake heed you move not  Pizarro retires  Without there Ho  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  What is your lordship's pleasure  VELASQUEZ  Attends the monk Ramirez  OFFICER  He does my lord  VELASQUEZ  Conduct him in and leave us  Enter  RAMIREZ  You are welcome  Most welcome reverend fatherPray draw near  We have a business for your privacy  Of an especial natureThe circling air  Shou'd not partake it nor the babbling winds  Lest their invisible wings disperse one breath  Of that main secret which thy faithful bosom  Is only fit to treasure  RAMIREZ  Good my lord  I am no common talker  VELASQUEZ  Well I know it  And therefore chose thee from the brotherhood  Not one of whom but wou'd lay by all thoughts  Of earth and Heaven and fly to execute  What I the voice of Spain commission'd him  RAMIREZ  Vouchsafe directly to unfold your will  My deeds and not my words must prove my duty  VALESQUEZ  Nay trust me cou'd they but divine my purpose  The holiest he that wastes the midnight lamp  In prayers and penance wou'd prevent my tongue  And hear me thank the deed but not persuade it  Therefore good friend 'tis not necessity  That sometimes forces any present means  And chequers chance with wisdom but free will  The election of my judgment and my love  That gives thy aptness this preeminence  RAMIREZ  The state I know has store of instruments  Like wellrang'd arms in ready order plac'd  Each for its several use  VELASQUEZ  Observe me well  Think not I mean to snatch a thankless office  Who serves the state while I direct her helm  Commands my friendship and his own reward  Say can you be content in these poor weeds  To know no earthly hopes beyond a cloyster  But stretch'd on musty matts in noisome caves  To rouse at midnight bells and mutter prayers  For souls beyond their reach to senseless saints  To wage perpetual war with nature's bounty  To blacken sick men's chambers and be number'd  With the loath'd leavings of mortality  The watchlight hourglass and the nauseous phial  Are these the ends of life Was this fine frame  Nerves exquisitely textur'd soft desires  Aspiring thoughts this comprehensive soul  With all her train of godlike faculties  Given to be sunk in this vile drudgery  RAMIREZ  These are the hard conditions of our state  We sow our humble seeds with toil on earth  To reap the harvest of our hopes in Heaven  VALESQUEZ  Yet wiser they who trust no future chance  But make this earth a Heaven Raise thy eyes  Up to the temporal splendors of our church  Behold our priors prelates cardinals  Survey their large revenues princely state  Their palaces of marble beds of down  Their statues pictures baths luxurious tables  That shame the fabled banquets of the gods  See how they weary art and ransack nature  To leave no taste no wish ungratified  Nowif thy spirit shrink notI can raise thee  To all this pomp and greatnessPledge thy faith  Swear thou wil't do this thingwhate'er I urge  And Lisbon's envied crozier shall be thine  RAMIREZ  This goodness so transcending all my hopes  Confounds my astonish'd senseWhate'er it be  Within the compass of man's power to act  I here devote me to the execution  VELASQUEZ  I must not hear of conscience and nice scruples  Tares that abound in none but meagre soils  To choak the aspiring seeds of manly daring  Those puny instincts which in feeble minds  Unfit for great exploits are miscall'd virtue  RAMIREZ  Still am I lost in dark uncertainty  And must for ever wander till thy breath  Deign to dispel the impenetrable mist  Fooling my sight that strives in vain to pierce it  VELASQUEZ  You are the Duke of Braganza's confessor  And fame reports him an exact observer  Of all our churches' holy ceremonies  He still is won't whene'er he visits Lisbon  Ere grateful slumber seal his pious lids  With all due reverence from some priestly hand  To take the mystic symbol of our faith  RAMIREZ  It ever was his custom and this night  I am commanded to attend his leisure  With preparation for the solemn act  VELASQUEZ  I know itTake  gives him a box  thou thisIt holds a wafer  Of sovereign virtue to enfranchise souls  Too righteous for this world from mortal cares  A monk of Milan mix'd the deadly drug  Drawn from the quintessence of noxious plants  Minerals and poisonous creatures whose dull bane  Arrests the nimble current of life's tide  And kills without a pang  RAMIREZ  I knew him well  The Carmelite Castruccio was it not  VELASQUEZ  The same he first approv'd it on a wretch  Condemn'd for murder to the ling'ring wheel  This night commit it to Braganza's lips  Had he a heart of iron giant strength  The antidotes of PontusAll were vain  To struggle with the venom's potency  RAMIREZ  This night my lord  VELASQUEZ  This very night nay shrink not  Unless thou mean'st to take the lead in death  And pull thy own destruction on thy head  RAMIREZ  Give me a moment's pauseA deed like this  VELASQUEZ  Should be at once resolv'd and executed  Think'st thou I am a raw unpractis'd novice  To make thy breast a partner to the trust  And not thy hand accomplice of the crime  Why 'tis the bond for my security  Look not amaz'd but mark me heedfully  Thou hast thy choicedispatch mine enemy  The means are in thy handbe safe and great  Or instantly prepare thee for a death  Which nothing but compliance can avert  RAMIREZ  Numbers I know even thus have tasted death  But sure imagination scarce can form  A way so horrid impious  VELASQUEZ  How's this How's this  Hear me pale miscreant my rage once rous'd  That hell thou dread'st this moment shall receive thee  Look here and tremble  Draws a dagger and seizes him  RAMIREZ  My lord be not so rash  Your fury's deafWill you not hear me speak  By ev'ry hope that cheers all vows that bind  Whatever horror waits upon the act  Your will shall make it justiceI'm resolv'd  VALASQUEZ  No trifling Monktake heed for should'st thou fail  RAMIREZ  Then be my life the forfeitMy obedience  Not only follows from your high command  But that my bosom swells against this Duke  With the full sense of my own injuries  VELASQUEZ  EnoughI thank theeLet me know betimes  How we have prosper'd Hence retire with caution  Deserve my favour and then meet me boldly  Exit Ramirez  'Tis doneHis doom is seal'dCome forth Pizarro  Pizarro comes forward  Is't not a subtle mischief  PIZARRO  Past all praise  The holy tool had qualms  VELASQUEZ  Pointing to his

 Shall hear the chearful sound of liberty  Again fair commerce welcom'd to our shore  Shall loose her swelling canvas to the winds  And golden Tagus heave once more to meet her  But see the Duke  Enter  DUKE  ALMADA  Your unexpected presence  Like a propitious omen cheers the night  And gives a royal sanction to this meeting  DUKE  My wish surpass'd my speed A call like this  Might imp the tardiness of feeble age  The general perseverance in our cause  Transcends all gratitudebut these wrong'd virtues  To Mello and Roderic  MELLO  Pray forbear  The painful error brought its punishment  Ribiro bore our duties to your grace  DUKE  He did and soon will join usOn our way  He left me with design once more to view  The posture of the guardsfor still we fear  Some dark impending mischief from Velasquez  ALMADA  Whatever fortune waits upon our swords  Your highness must not share the common hazard  Lest in the tumult some inglorious chance  Deprive your country of its last best bulwark  DUKE  And shou'd I merit to be call'd her bulwark  Or rank with men like youcou'd I submit  To hear and not partake the glorious danger  ALMADA  Pray be advis'din this I must command  DUKE  Then be it sobut yet shou'd ought betide  To claim the interest of thy prince's arm  I cannot wrong our friendship to suspect  You will forbear my summons to the field  ALMADA  Trust your AlmadaLo the night wears fast  Nor are our scatter'd numbers yet return'd  DUKE  Welcome Ribiro What intelligence  Enter  RIBIRO  RIBIRO  The worst if we delayOh had your eyes  Beheld the sight that blasted mine  DUKE  What fight  RIBIRO  Lemos is seiz'd this momentand Pizarro  The ready tool of fell Velasquez' crimes  Leads him to prison  DUKE  Soon we'll wrench the gates  And from their gloomy caverns draw to light  All that remains of those unhappy men  Whom unarraign'd unheard the tyrants nod  Consign'd to horrors nature shakes to think of  ALMADA  His triumph will be shortThe subtle fiend  May league with hell to thwart usbut in vain  His fate or ours must quickly be decided  RIBIRO  Even now it seems his demon whispers him  His audit is at hand and scares his soul  Anxious at this late hour he walks his chamber  Nor seeks the season's restand still more strange  The palace guards stretch'd by their glimmering fires  Their arms cast by lye wrapt in thoughtless sleep  DUKE  Anon we'll rouse them with so loud a peal  That death's dull ear shall hear it  ALMADA  Corea  Soon as our work begins your hardy tribes  Must thro' the streets proclaim Don Juan King  Press towards the palace shou'd our friends give ground  Sustain their fainting strength  COREA  We will not fail  ALMADA  The general suffrage to thy sword Ribiro  Commits our master work a deed so envied  That ev'ry trenchant steel of Portugal  Did not thy gallant zeal demand it first  Would strike to share the glory  RIBIRO  Pointing to his sword  This shall thank you  And if it reek not with his hated blood  Exchange it for a distaff  ALMADA  Friends I mean not  By gloomy presage to allay your ardor  We must not look to fortune in this cause  But on ourselves rely for sure success  The least disorder in our bold approach  The least repulse may drive our engine back  One brave man's rashness or one coward's fear  Turns all our fairest hopes to shame and ruin  DUKE  Now to our stationsYet ere we depart  This honest pledge the soldier's short embrace  The sweet remembrance if we fall for freedom  Will more than soften half the pains of dying  But if we meet in stronger clasps renew'd  Will double all the joys of victory  End of the Fourth  ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  The Apartments of  VELASQUEZ  in the royal Palace  VELASQUEZ  alone  WHY am I haunted by these phantom fears  It cannot be my fate 'Tis nature's weakness  The spirits rais'd too high like billows puff'd  By sudden storms lift up our little bark  Then slipping from their burthen sink as fast  And leave it wreck'd and found'ring  Enter  PIZARRO  VELASQUEZ  Have you as I commanded question'd Lemos  PIZARRO  Just now I left him  VELASQUEZ  Has the slave confess'd  PIZARRO  With sullen calmness he defies your power  Or answers but with scorn  VELASQUEZ  We'll find the means  To make him speak more plainly to bring down  This daring spiritHe is dangerous  And under the fair mask of public virtue  Combines with proud Almada and the rest  In dark confed'racy against my state  PIZARRO  He is my Lord the masterspring that moves  The factious populace  VELASQUEZ  I know it well  But I have ta'en such care as shall unhinge  Their illcontriv'd designs Ere noon tomorrow  Don Garcia with the Spanish veterans  From Saint Jago's fortress shall pour in  And bend these stubborn necks to due obedience  How will their disappointed fury rave  To find their royal demagogue Braganza  The idol their vain worship rais'd so high  Low levell'd with the earthI wonder much  Ramirez not returnsNight's latest watch  Will soon be told  PIZARRO  Perhaps he but delays  For better welcome to behold the effect  Of the dire venom and to glad your ears  By telling how your enemy expir'd  VELASQUEZ  It may be so I cannot doubt the effect  Poison administer'd will do its work  And this most speedily 'tis swift perdition  Yet tho' this hour cuts off my greatest foe  If my firm soul were capable of fear  I might distrust the promise of my fortunes  PIZARRO  Wherefore my Lord  VELASQUEZ  I almost blush to tell it  Tir'd with the travail of this anxious night  I threw me on my couch and try'd to rest  I try'd in vainmy vexed lids scarce clos'd  Or when a momentary slumber seal'd them  Strange visions swam before their twilight sense  But why retrace the hideous phantasy  Yet still it hovers round me still remains  A fearful reverence of the past illusion  PIZARRO  Such reverence but degrades a noble mind  And sinks its vigour to an infant's weakness  Beldams and priests infuse these idle fears  And turn the milk of nature to its bane  Noise at a distance  VELASQUEZ  Heard you that noise Didst thou not mark Pizarro  The monk has kept his word'Tis Juan's knell  His followers who shouted him at noon  Now wail his deathMy genius now has room  Their sorrows are my triumph and proclaim  Assur'd success to my aspiring soul  PIZARRO  Sure 'tis the din of clashing armsagain  It comes this way  Enter  OFFICER  with his sword drawn  VELASQUEZ  Ha bleedingspeak  Know you the causeSpeak instant speak  OFFICER  Too well  The raging multitude have forc'd their way  Their cry is Where's the tyrantWhere's Velasquez  Don Juan's at their head and guides the storm  VELASQUEZ  Juan alive eternal silence seize thee  Impossible  OFFICER  These eyes my Lord beheld him  Saw his rais'd arm  VELASQUEZ  Ha am I then betray'd  Perdition catch RamirezYou Pizarro  Collect my scatter'd trainI'll forth and meet  The rebel's sword  PIZARRO  Be not so rash  Nor venture singly  Exit  VELASQUEZ  OFFICER  He rushes on his death  Two of my soldiers are already slain  Striving to bar the outward palace gates  Where like a tide the frantic people press  Bearing down all before them  PIZARRO  Hence begone  The uproar's louderWake the sleeping grooms  Bid them bring armsAlarm the magistrates  Send to the guard and draw them to the square  Exit  OFFICER  Reenter  VELASQUEZ  VELASQUEZ  Ruin'd undone all's lostthe streets are throng'd  With raging citizensA furious band  Of armed Portugueze just now are mounting  Fate's bloody book is open'd and I read  My dreadful doom yet I'll not tamely yield  But grapple to the last with destiny  PIZARRO  All is not lostperhaps some means are left  VELASQUEZ  Just at the gate I met the dastard monk  Struggling for entrancescarce his breath suffic'd  To tell me that our purpose had miscarried  And Juan livesI stabb'd him to the heart  The best reward for unperforming fear  PIZARRO  Think not of himbut save yourself by flight  VELASQUEZ  Where can I flyI am beset devoted  Our foes like famish'd bloodhounds are abroad  And have us in the wind  PIZARRO  Resolve at once  The postern's yet unforc'd that way escape  Disguise yourself and fly to Juan's palace  'Tis but the terrace lengthImplore his mercy  It is the foolish weakness of his nature  To spare where he may punish  VELASQUEZ  Ask my life  No rather let me perishHoldhis wife  Perhaps alone unguardedIf I fall  I'll leave a scorpion in the traitor's breast  Shall make him curse the hour he rous'd my fury  Exit  PIZARRO  alone  Now let the tempest riseOh fickle fortune  This moment mounted to thy giddy top  Now whirl'd to earth and grovelingHarkthey come  RIBIRO  entering with others  Search all the chambersIf the villain 'scape  Our work's but half accomplish'd  PIZARRO  Pass no farther  RIBIRO  This is the tyrant's bosom counsellor  Where is thy master Spaniard  PIZARRO  Safe I hope  From lawless rage like thine and still will live  To punish this outrageous violence  RIBIRO  Insolent slaveAnd yet I like thy courage  'Tis vain to strive deliver up thy sword  I will not force thee to betray thy master  Perfidious as he isEven in a foe  I can discern a virtue and esteem it  Gonsalez guard him

the Duke of  BRAGANZA'S  Palace Enter  DUTCHESS  an Attendant following  DUTCHESS  No Ines no I love my husband much  But more his honour Cou'd I press his stay  In tame inaction here to wait the event  While almost in his sight his crown and glory  Hung on the doubtful fate of others swords  Wou'd he have heard me No I knew him better  Soon as Almada's danger reach'd his ear  Who twice repuls'd cou'd scarce renew the charge  Swift as a javelin cuts the whistling air  He snatch'd his sword and breaking from my arms  Rush'd to the fight and join'd the warring throng  INES  That favouring power which has so oft preserv'd  Will not forsake him now  DUTCHESS  O grant it Heaven  Go Ines to the terrace and observe  If any friend for sure I may expect it  Bring tidings from my husband  Exit Ines  Would this arm  This feeble arm had strength to second him  The conflict here is worseMy restless heart  Swell'd with eventful expectation throbs  And feels its bounds too narrowFear on fear  Like light reflected from the dancing wave  Visits all places but can rest in none  The distant shouts that break the morning sky  Lift up a while my mounting thoughts to Heaven  Then sinking leave them to fall down as low  In boding apprehensionWelcome welcome  Enter  MENDOZA  What of my lord  MENDOZA  He bad me fly to greet you  Himself a while detain'd to stop the rage  Of cruelty and carnage  DUTCHESS  He returns  Unhurt victorious to these happy arms  MENDOZA  All all your fondest wish cou'd form he brings  Crown conquest allOppression is no more  Pierc'd by a thousand wounds the giant dies  While freeborn men with fearless gaze walk round  And view the monster's bulk  DUTCHESS  I wou'd know more  Was it a dear bought triumph Must we mourn  The fall of many friends  MENDOZA  Scarce one of note  But lives to share our joyThe regent seiz'd  Gave orders for the citadel's surrender  To save the threaten'd lives of the whole council  Whom sleeping we secur'dPoorly content  To obey her mandate though he knew it forc'd  The dastard governor resign'd his charge  And struck the Austrian bannerSuch the power  Of Juan's royal name and conquering arm  The rest himself will tellI must return  Abroad the wild commotion rages still  The King may want my serviceAngels guard you  Exit Mendoza  DUTCHESS  O fly begone lose not a thought on me  Now to thy

tyrant's dead  DUKE  Say'st thou Velasquez  RIBIRO  Aye what was Velasquez  Dispers'd and mangled by the people's rage  In bloody fragments stains a thousand hands  Like ravenous wolves by eager famine pinch'd  With worrying fangs they dragg'd him from my grasp  And in my fight tore out his reeking entrails  DUKE  His blood be on his head and may his end  Provok'd by crimes beyond the reach of pardon  Strike terror to the souls of impious men  Who own no God but from his pow'r to punish  THE END
