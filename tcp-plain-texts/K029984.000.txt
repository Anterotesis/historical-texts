 Address to a Locket  The Words from Emma Corbet  COME thou soft and sacred favour  The remembrance chaste impart  Take thy station on my bosom  Lightly lodging near the heart  While that tender heart shall flutter  Thou the secret cause shalt share  Whether pleasure or disaster  Thou shalt see what stirs it there  When the hopes of happy tidings  Shall the sweet sensations move  When the white and winged agents  Whisper friendship whisper love  Then all sympathetic thrilling  Thou the rosy form shalt guide  While as runs the  iddy treasure  Thou'rt the genius of the tide  Happy when this heart is sinking  Thou shalt sooth the rising sigh  When with woe surcharg'd 'tis heaving  Thou shalt see the reason why  Come thou dear and decent favour  Learn what thou wilt ne'er impart  Fix thy throne and fix it ever  In the regions of my heart  FOWLER PRINTER SALISBURY
