 A POEM On the Marriage of His SERENE HIGHNESS the PRINCE of  ORANGE  WITH ANN PrincessRoyal of GREAT BRITAIN  By  STEPHEN DUCK  To which are added VERSES to the AUTHOR By a DIVINE With the AUTHOR'S ANSWER  LONDON  Printed for WEAVER BICKERTON at Lord  Bacon  's  Head  without  Templebar  Price One Shilling  TO His SERENE HIGHNESS the PRINCE of  ORANGE    This POEM is humbly Inscribed by His  Most Dutiful Servant S DUCK  ON THE MARRIAGE Of His SERENE HIGHNESS the PRINCE of  ORANGE  _ILLustrious Prince forgive the feeble Lay  That now aspires to hail your Nuptialday  Nor  a Muse the meanest of the Nine  Who brings her humble Off'ring to your Shrine  And You Imperial Nymph whose lovely Face  Invites the Hero to your chaste Embrace  Vouchsafe a Spark of your Coelestial Fire  Harmonious Words and pleasing Thoughts inspire  Soft as your Love and tuneful as your Lyre  So shall my Numbers charm the list'ning Ear  And ev'n the glad NASSAU delighted hear  NASSAU has long enrich'd the Book of Fame  And ANNA now adorns the Noble Name  Nations who saw the Light of ORANGE rise  With awful Splendor in the  Belgian  Skies  Shall soon behold it with new Lustre shine  Join'd to a glorious Star of BRUNSWICK's Line  So where the flowing  Sambre  gently glides  The Swain delights to view the beauteous Tides  But when his moreextended Eye surveys  The shining Torrent join the spacious  Maese    Both Rivers thus with friendly Union flow  And to the Sight superior Beauty show  Whene'er the Gods a noble Race intend  They suit the Causes to their destin'd End  Nor yoke unequal Hearts in Nuptial Love  Jove  's valiant Bird disdains the fearful Dove  Great Minds by native Sympathy combine  As golden Particles the closest join  Paternal Virtues in their Bosom roll  Ally'd in Love by Nobleness of Soul  Hence Thrones and Scepters shine neglected Things  Hence Royal ANN prefers NASSAU to Kings  While  Britons  with united Hearts rejoice  And willing Senators applaud the Choice  To see their King to Honour ever true  Discharge the Debt to sacred WILLIAM due  Immortal WILLIAM by whose prudent Cares  We yet enjoy the Fruits of all our Wars  Our Laws Religion Liberty and Peace  And ev'n the Blessings of the BRUNSWICK Race  Nor Thou Illustrious ORANGE blush to own  Thy Honour thus ally'd to  Albion  's Crown  Blest with a Princess in whose Form we trace  Her Fathers Majesty and Mother's Grace  Bright Orbs of Pow'r that with propitious Ray  Dispel our Clouds and beautify our Day  Not as the Comet raging thro' the Air  Infects the World with Pestilence and War  But like the Sun their Beams of Goodness glow  Inspiring Life and chearing All below  Such are the glorious SIRE and gracious DAME  From whence the beauteous Bride of ORANGE came  And shall unerring Nature change her Kind  What Lion e'er produc'd a tim'rous Hind  The Royal Eagles Royal Eagles breed  And Heroes from Heroic Sires proceed  Rome  's Founder thus confest his Race Divine  Thus NASSAU copies the NASSOVIAN Line  Thus ANNA's noble Stream of Virtue flows  High as the Regal Spring from whence it rose  Thrice happy Nymph with ev'ry grace supply'd  Thrice happy Prince with such a heav'nly Bride  In whom superior Sense with Judgment joins  Her Beauty much but more her Merit shines  How glorious when such Worth adorns the Great  We hear we see admire and imitate  Virtue in Them attracts remotest Eyes  But in the Vulgar Soul unheeded lies  As radiant  Phoebus  darts superior Light  While smaller Planets shun the watchful Sight  Accomplish'd thus let her Example fire  The drooping Muse and wake the sounding Lyre  To aid Religion be her chiefest Care  Heav'n justly claims the Soul it made so fair  To stem the Torrent of licentious Rage  And prop the Virtues of a sinking Age  Exalting Science to her ancient Height  To raise declining Arts and make the rude Polite  While Great NASSAU whom native Glory warms  Whene'er his Country calls him forth to Arms  May fire the  Belgians  in the Field of  Mars    Consult their Peace or animate their Wars  Paint his Forefathers to their wond'ring Eye  And teach 'em how to conquer or to die  Like him who bravely dar'd to break their Chain  Tho' held by all the Force and Fraud' of  Spain    For injur'd Liberty the Sword he draws  Resolv'd to gain or perish in the Cause  And having long the doubtful Combat try'd  Like  Caesar  vanquish'd and like  Caesar  King  William  's Great Grandfather the first Great Assertor of the  Belgian  Liberties Assassinated at  Delph  dy'd  Tho' diff'rent far the Motives of their Mind  That fought to Conquer This to Save Mankind  Till prais'd lamented envied and admir'd  The Hero Patriot and the Prince expir'd  Oh where did then the guardian Angels hide  Nor watch'd to turn the guilty Ball aside  When he whom armed Hosts cou'd not withstand  Now falls a Victim to one Villain's hand  But rise ye Muses quit the pensive Lay  Nor damp the Joys of this auspicious Day  Since yet the glorious Name of ORANGE stands  Since Royal ANNA seals the Nuptialbands  Soon may Imperial ADOLPHS rise again  Again new FREDERICKS thunder on the Main  Rousing the Martial Youth to War's alarms  If proud  Ierians  shine again in Arms  To guard their Country from tyrannic Pow'r  And be what glorious WILLIAM was before  Nor shall the  states invading Forces fear  'Ere pregnant Time the promis'd Heroes bear  Nor want Allies their Freedom to defend  Since BRUNSWICK reigns and ALBION is their Friend  As branching Oaks protect the rural Swain  Secure from Summerheat and Winterrain  So shall our Monarch with Paternal Aid  His Regal Shelter o'er  Batavia  spread  Long as the Sceptre fills his Royal Hand  A true  Palladium  shall Insure the Land  And if the praescient Muses guide my Lay  Or future Secrets  Phoebus  can display  The Day shall shine distinguish'd from the rest  That ANNA dignify'd and  Hymen  blest  In which AUGUSTUS fortifies his Throne  And plans a Scheme of Union for his Son  Bespeaks Allies for Princes yet to come  New Friends to  Britain  and new Foes to  Rome  Proceed Great MONARCH new Allies to gain  And with new Nuptialleagues our Peace maintain  So shall thy beauteous Nymphs secure with Charms  That safety other Kings defend with Arms  They  Venus  like cou'd  Mars  himself surprize  And awe stern Tyrants with their conqu'ring Eyes  VERSES to the Author In Imitation of HORACE's ODE on PINDAR  By a DIVINE  Applyed to the Marriage of his Highness the Prince of  Orange  with ANN Princess Royal of  Great Britain  WHO hopes to rival MILTON's Flame  With waxen Pinions fondly flies  His Fall will give the Sea a Name  While he attempts to reach the Skies  MILTON is like a Flood whose Tide  Swell'd with tempestous Deluge roars  Which from some lofty Mountain's Side  Resistless foams and knows no Shores  With sacred Lawrels justly crown'd  Whether in bold unfetter'd Strains  His tow'ring Muse the common Bound  Superior to all Rhime disdains  Whether the Realms of endless Day  He fill with Wars and rude Alarms  Or set in terrible Array  Seraphic  Legions  clad in Arms  Aloft with all their Forests thrown  See Hills from their Foundations raz'd  See Angels hurl'd with Vengeance down  When the MESSIAH's Standard blaz'd  Or leads he to conubial Bow'rs  The newform'd Pair The teeming Ground  Smiles with a Wilderness of Flow'rs  Diffusing Gales of Fragrance round  Lo ADAM with Majestic Mein  For Empire and Command design'd  Consumate Beauty crowns his Queen  With Dignity and Sweetness join'd  While he the charming Scene displays  Where Innocence and Pleasure reign'd  Delighted with his sacred Lays  We hear it lost and feel it gain'd  His Lays inimitably fine  With Extasy each Passion move  When loud they trumpet War divine  Or softly warble human Love  O STEPHEN this Britannic Swan  Surmounts the Clouds with noble Flight  While I at distance only can  Admire him less'ning to the Sight  As the poor Bee with endless Toil  To suck the Thyme and blooming Rose  Skims over RICHMOND's fragrant Soil  Thus I with pleasing Pain compose  You with a happy Genius blest  In bolder Strains shall NASSAU sing  When ANNA by the Graces drest  He to the Nuptial Dome shall bring  ANNA enrich'd with various Charms  By the indulgent Care of Heav'n  Than whom into his longing Arms  No greater Treasure can be giv'n  Not tho' with Riches of the East  At his Command the  Ganges  flow  Tho' with full Empire he possest  Whate'er Ambition wish'd below  Ye  Nereids  with propitious Gales  The gilded Vessel kindly aid  Let CUPIDS fan the swelling Sails  And waft him to the Royal Maid  This was written in  October  last when the Prince was expected  When  Thames  with floating Forests crown'd  LEANDER safe arriv'd proclaims  And of tumultuous Joy the Sound  Shall bid AUGUSTA rise in Flames  Loud Thunder bursting from her Tow'rs  Shall signalize the sacred Day  And transport to the  Belgic  Shores  For Blessings which they lent convey  Around while Hymenaeals ring  My Voice to highest Pitch I'll raise  Thrice happy if I can but sing  An humble Ode to NASSAU's Praise  You soaring in Heroic Verse  By native Strength of Wing upborn  His Godlike Virtues shall rehearse  And Beauties which the Bride adorn  He in your Lays shall finish'd rise  For Council or th' embattled Field  Immortals the contested Prize  To her superior Charms shall yield  Then ravish'd with prophetick Views  Succeeding Glories shall presage  And from the Genial Bed the Muse  Raise Princes to improve the Age  Who bravely prodigal of Blood  Shall prove that to set free Mankind  And conquer for the Publick Good  The Race of NASSAU was design'd  Thus Great ALCIDES Poets feign  By Labours gain'd the Seats above  Countries preserv'd and Monsters slain  Assert the Genuine Son of Jove  The Answer  WHEN I in feeble Verse essay'd  NASSAU and ANNA's Praise  A Lyrick Muse flew o'er my Head  And dropp'd a Branch of Bays  I wou'd have fix'd it on my Brow  But PHOEBUS said forbear  'Tis Vanity to touch the Bough  And Sacrilege to wear  Give it the Bard who boldly dares  Attempt the  Roman  Lyre  Who wisely checks but not impairs  The tow'ring PINDAR's Fire  Thus Sir to you in PHOEBUS' Name  The Lawrel Wreath I send  And since the God denies me Fame  Am glad it crowns my Friend  FINIS
