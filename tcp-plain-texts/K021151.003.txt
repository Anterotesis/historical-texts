 An Invocation  COME bright Love of Fame inspire my glowing Breast Not thee I call who over swelling Tides of Blood and Tears dost bear the Heroe on to Glory while Sighs of Millions waft his spreading Sails but thee fair gentle Maid whom  Mnesis  happy Nymph first on the Banks of  Hebrus  didst produce Thee whom  Maeonia  educated whom  Mantua  charm'd and who on that fair Hill which overlooks the proud Metropolis of  Britain  sat with thy  Milton  sweetly tuning the Heroic Lyre fill my ravished Fancy with the Hopes of charming Ages yet to come Foretel me that some tender Maid whose Grandmother is yet unborn hereafter when under the fictitious Name of  Sophia  she reads the real worth which once existed in  my  Charlotte  shall from her sympathetic Breast send forth the heaving Sigh Do thou teach me not only to foresee but to enjoy nay even to feed on future Praise Comfort me by a solemn Assurance that when the little Parlour in which I sit at this Instant shall be reduced to a worse furnished Box I shall be read with Honour by those who never knew nor saw me and whom I shall neither know nor see  And thou much plumper Dame whom no airy Forms nor Phantoms of Imagination cloathe Whom the wellseasoned Beef and Pudding richly stained with Plumbs delight Thee I call of whom in a  Trachtchugt  in some  Dutch  Canal the fat Ufrow Gelt impregnated by a jolly Merchant of  Amsterdam  was delivered In  Grubstreet  School didst thou suck in the Elements of thy Erudition Here hast thou in thy maturer Age taught Poetry to tickle not the Fancy but the Pride of the Patron Comedy from thee learns a grave and solemn Air while Tragedy storms loud and rends the affrighted Theatres with its Thunder To sooth thy wearied Limbs in Slumber Alderman History tells his tedious Tale and again to awaken thee Monsieur Romance performs his surprizing Tricks of Dexterity Nor less thy wellfed Bookseller obeys thy Influence By thy Advice the heavy unread Folio Lump which long had dozed on the dusty Shelf piecemealed into Numbers runs nimbly through the Nation Instructed by thee some Books like Quacks impose on the World by promising Wonders while others turn Beaus and trust all their Merits to a gilded Outside Come thou jolly Substance with thy shining Face keep back thy Inspiration but hold forth thy tempting Rewards thy shining chinking Heap thy quicklyconvertible Bankbill big with unseen Riches thy oftenvarying Stock the warm the comfortable House and  lastly a fair Portion of that bounteous Mother whose flowing Breasts yield redundant Sustenance for all her numerous Offspring did not some too greedily and wantonly drive their Brethren from the Teat Come thou and if I am too tasteless of thy valuable Treasures warm my Heart with the transporting Thought of conveying them to others Tell me that through thy Bounty the prattling Babes whose innocent Play hath often been interrupted by my Labours may one Time be amply rewarded for them  And now this illyoked Pair this lean Shadow and this fat Substance have prompted me to write whose Assistance shall I invoke to direct my Pen  First Genius thou Gift of Heaven without whose Aid in vain we struggle against the Stream of Nature Thou who dost sow the generous Seeds which Art nourishes and brings to Perfection Do thou kindly take me by the Hand and lead me through all the Mazes the winding Labyrinths of Nature Initiate me into all those Mysteries which profane Eyes never beheld Teach me which to thee is no difficult Task to know Mankind better than they know themselves Remove that Mist which dims the Intellects of Mortals and causes them to adore Men for their Art or to detest them for their Cunning in deceiving others when they are in reality the Objects only of Ridicule for deceiving themselves Strip off the thin Disguise of Wisdom from SelfConceit of Plenty from Avarice and of Glory from Ambition Come thou that hast inspired thy  Aristophanes  thy  Lucian  thy  Cervantes  thy  Rabelais  thy  Moliere  thy  Shakespear  thy  Swift  thy  Marivaux  fill my Pages with Humour 'till Mankind learn the Goodnature to laugh only at the Follies of others and the Humility to grieve at their own  And thou almost the constant Attendant on true Genius Humanity bring all thy tender Sensations If thou hast already disposed of them all between thy  Allen  and thy  Lyttleton  steal them a little while from their Bosoms Not without these the tender Scene is painted From these alone proceed the noble disinterested Friendship the melting Love the generous Sentiment the ardent Gratitude the soft Compassion the candid Opinion and all those strong Energies of a good Mind which fill the moistened Eyes with Tears the glowing Cheeks with Blood and swell the Heart with Tides of Grief Joy and Benevolence  And thou O Learning for without thy Assistance nothing pure nothing correct can Genius produce do thou guide my Pen Thee in thy favourite Fields where the limpid gently rolling  Thames  washes thy  Etonian  Banks in early Youth I have worshipped To thee at thy birchen Altar with true  Spartan  Devotion I have sacrificed my Blood Come then and from thy vast luxuriant Stores in long Antiquity piled up pour forth the rich Profusion Open thy  Maeonian  and thy  Mantuan  Coffers with whatever else includes thy Philosophic thy Poetic and thy Historical Treasures whether with  Greek  or  Roman  Characters thou hast chosen to inscribe the ponderous Chests Give me a while that Key to all thy Treasures which to thy  Warburton  thou hast entrusted  Lastly come Experience long conversant with the Wise the Good the Learned and the Polite Nor with them only but with every Kind of Character from the Minister at his Levee to the Bailiff in his SpungingHouse from the Dutchess at her Drum to the Landlady behind her Bar From thee only can the Manners of Mankind be known to which  the recluse Pedant however great his Parts or extensive his Learning may be hath ever been a Stranger  Come all these and more if possible for arduous is the Task I have undertaken And without all your Assistance will I find be too heavy for me to support But if you all smile on my Labours I hope still to bring them to a happy Conclusion  CHAP II  What befel Mr  Jones  on his Arrival in  London  THE learned Dr  Misaubin  used to say that the proper Direction to him was  To Dr  Misaubin  in the World  intimating that there were few People in it to whom his great Reputation was not known And perhaps upon a very nice Examination into the Matter we shall find that this Circumstance bears no inconsiderable Part among the many Blessings of Grandeur  The great Happiness of being known to Posterity with the Hopes of which we so delighted ourselves in the preceding Chapter is the Portion of few To have the several Elements which compose our Names as  Sydenham  expresses it repeated a thousand Years hence is a Gift beyond the Power of Title and Wealth and is scarce to be purchased unless by the Sword and the Pen But to avoid the scandalous Imputation while we yet live of being  one whom Nobody knows  a Scandal by the by as old as the Days of  Homer  See the d Odyssey ver  will always be the envied Portion of those who have a legal Title either to Honour or Estate  From that Figure therefore which the  Irish  Peer who brought  Sophia  to Town hath already made in this History the Reader will conclude doubtless it  must have been an easy Matter to have discovered his House in  London  without knowing the particular Street or Square which he inhabited since he must have been one  whom every Body knows  To say the Truth so it would have been to any of those Tradesmen who are accustomed to attend the Regions of the Great For the Doors of the Great are generally no less easy to find than it is difficult to get Entrance into them But  Jones  as well as  Partridge  was an entire Stranger in  London  and as he happened to arrive first in a Quarter of the Town the Inhabitants of which have very little Intercourse with the Householders of  Hanover  or  Grosvenor  Square for he entered through  GraysInn  Lane so he rambled about some Time before he could even find his Way to those happy Mansions where Fortune segregates from the Vulgar those magnanimous Heroes the Descendants of antient  Britons Saxons  or  Danes  whose Ancestors being born in better Days by sundry Kinds of Merit have entailed Riches and Honour on their Posterity  Jones  being at length arrived at those terrestrial  Elysian  Fields would now soon have discovered his Lordship's Mansion but the Peer unluckily quitted his former House when he went for  Ireland  and as he was just entered into a new one the Fame of his Equipage had not yet sufficiently blazed in the Neighbourhood So that after a successless Enquiry 'till the Clock had struck Eleven  Jones  at last yielded to the Advice of  Partridge  and retreated to the  Bull  and  Gate  in  Holborn  that being the Inn where he had first alighted and where he retired to enjoy that Kind of Repose which usually attends Persons in his Circumstances  Early in the Morning he again set forth in Pursuit of  Sophia  and many a weary Step he took to no better Purpose than before At last whether it was that  Fortune relented or whether it was no longer in her Power to disappoint him he came into the very Street which was honoured by his Lordship's Residence and being directed to the House he gave one gentle Rap at the Door  The Porter who from the Modesty of the Knock had conceived no high Idea of the Person approaching conceived but little better from the Appearance of Mr  Jones  who was drest in a Suit of Fustian and had by his Side the Weapon formerly purchased of the Serjeant of which tho' the Blade might be composed of welltempered Steel the Handle was composed only of Brass and that none of the brightest When  Jones  therefore enquired after the young Lady who had come to Town with his Lordship this Fellow answered surlily  'That there were no Ladies there'  Jones  then desired to see the Master of the House but was informed that his Lordship would see no Body that Morning And upon growing more pressing the Porter said  'He had positive Orders to let no Person in but if you think proper' said he 'to leave your Name I will acquaint his Lordship and if you call another Time you shall know when he will see you'  Jones  now declared  'that he had very particular Business with the young Lady and could not depart without seeing her  Upon which the Porter with no very agreeable Voice or Aspect affirmed  'That there was no young Lady in that House and consequently none could he see adding Sure you are the strangest Man I ever met with for you will not take an Answer'  I have often thought that by the particular Description of  Cerberus  the Porter of Hell in the th  Aeneid Virgil  might possibly intend to satyrize the Porters of the great Men in his Time the Picture at least resembles those who have the Honour to attend  at the Doors of our great Men The Porter in his Lodge answers exactly to  Cerberus  in his Den and like him must be appeased by a Sop before Access can be gained to his Master Perhaps  Jones  might have seen him in that Light and have recollected the Passage where the Sybil in order to procure an Entrance for  Aeneas  presents the Keeper of the  Stygian  Avenue with such a Sop  Jones  in like Manner now began to offer a Bribe to the human  Cerberus  which a Footman overhearing instantly advanced and declared  'if Mr  Jones  would give him the Sum proposed he would conduct him to the Lady'  Jones  instantly agreed and was forthwith conducted to the Lodging of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  by the very Fellow who had attended the Ladies thither the Day before  Nothing more aggravates ill Success than the near Approach to Good The Gamester who loses his Party at Piquet by a single Point laments his bad Luck ten Times as much as he who never came within a Prospect of the Game So in a Lottery the Proprietors of the next Numbers to that which wins the great Prize are apt to account themselves much more unfortunate than their FellowSufferes In short these kind of hairbreadth Missings of Happiness look like the Insults of Fortune who may be considered as thus playing Tricks with us and wantonly diverting herself at our Expence  Jones  who more than once already had experienced this frolicksome Disposition of the Heathen Goddess was now again doomed to be tantalized in the like Manner For he arrived at the Door of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  about ten Minutes after the Departure of  Sophia  He now addressed himself to the WaitingWoman belonging to Mrs  Fitzpatrick  who told him the disagreeable News that the Lady was gone but could not tell him whither and the same  Answer he afterwards received from Mrs  Fitzpatrick  herself For as that Lady made no doubt but that Mr  Jones  was a Person detached from her Uncle  Western  in Pursuit of his Daughter so she was too generous to betray her  Though  Jones  had never seen Mrs  Fitzpatrick  yet he had heard that a Cousin of  Sophia  was married to a Gentleman of that Name This however in the present Tumult of his Mind never once recurred to his Memory But when the Footman who had conducted him from his Lordship's acquainted him with the great Intimacy between the Ladies and with their calling each other Cousin he then recollected the Story of the Marriage which he had formerly heard and as he was presently convinced that this was the same Woman he became more surprized at the Answer which he had received and very earnestly desired Leave to wait on the Lady herself but she as positively refused him that Honour  Jones  who though he had never seen a Court was better bred than most who frequent it was incapable of any rude or abrupt Behaviour to a Lady When he had received therefore a peremptory Denial he retired for the present saying to the waiting Woman  'That if this was an improper Hour to wait on her Lady he would return in the Afternoon and that he then hoped to have the Honour of seeing her'  The Civility with which he uttered this added to the great Comeliness of his Person made an Impression on the WaitingWoman and she could not help answering  'Perhaps Sir you may And indeed she afterwards said every Thing to her Mistress which she thought most likely to prevail on her to admit a Visit from the handsome young Gentleman for so she called him'  Jones  very shrewdly suspected that  Sophia  herself was now with her Cousin and was denied to him  which he imputed to her Resentment of what had happened at  Upton  Having therefore dispatched  Partridge  to procure him Lodgings he remained all Day in the Street watching the Door where he thought his Angel lay concealed but no Person did he see issue forth except a Servant of the House And in the Evening he returned to pay his Visit to Mrs  Fitzpatrick  which that good Lady at last condescended to admit  There is a certain Air of natural Gentility which it is neither in the Power of Dress to give nor to conceal Mr  Jones  as hath been before hinted was possessed of this in a very eminent Degree He met therefore with a Reception from the Lady somewhat different from what his Apparel seemed to demand and after he had paid her his proper Respects was desired to sit down  The Reader will not I believe be desirous of knowing all the Particulars of this Conversation which ended very little to the Satisfaction of poor  Jones  For though Mrs  Fitzpatrick  soon discovered the Lover as all Women have the Eyes of Hawks in those Matters yet she still thought it was such a Lover as a generous Friend of the Lady should not betray her to In short she suspected this was the very Mr  Blifil  from whom  Sophia  had flown and all the Answers which she artfully drew from  Jones  concerning Mr  Allworthy'  s Family confirmed her in this Opinion She therefore strictly denied any Knowledge concerning the Place whither  Sophia  was gone nor could  Jones  obtain more than a Permission to wait on her again the next Evening  When  Jones  was departed Mrs  Fitzpatrick  communicated her Suspicion concerning Mr  Blifil  to her Maid who answered  'Sure Madam he is too pretty a Man in my Opinion for any Woman in the World to run away from I had rather fancy  it is Mr  Jones  'Mr  Jones  said the Lady what  Jones  '  For  Sophia  had not given the least Hint of any such Person in all their Conversation But Mrs  Honour  had been much more communicative and had acquainted her Sister  Abigail  with the whole History of  Jones  which this now again related to her Mistress  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  no sooner received this Information than she immediately agreed with the Opinion of her Maid and what is very unaccountable saw Charms in the gallant happy Lover which she had overlooked in the slighted Squire  'Betty  says she 'you are certainly in the right He is a very pretty Fellow and I don't wonder that my Cousin's Maid should tell you so many Women are fond of him I am sorry now I did not inform him where my Cousin was And yet if he be so terrible a Rake as you tell me it is a Pity she should ever see him any more for what but her Ruin can happen from marrying a Rake and a Beggar against her Father's Consent I protest if he be such a Man as the Wench described him to you it is but an Office of Charity to keep her from him and I am sure it would be unpardonable in me to do otherwise who have tasted so bitterly of the Misfortunes attending such Marriages'  Here she was interrupted by the Arrival of a Visitor which was no other than his Lordship and as nothing passed at this Visit either new or extraordinary or any Ways material to this History we shall here put an End to this Chapter  CHAP III  A Project of Mrs  Fitzpatrick  and her Visit to Lady  Bellaston  WHEN Mrs  Fitzpatrick  retired to Rest her Thoughts were entirely taken up by her Cousin  Sophia  and Mr  Jones  She was indeed a little offended with the former for the Disingenuity which she now discovered In which Meditation she had not long exercised her Imagination before the following Conceit suggested itself That could she possibly become the Means of preserving  Sophia  from this Man and of restoring her to her Father she should in all human Probability by so great a Service to the Family reconcile to herself both her Uncle and her Aunt  Western  As this was one of her most favourite Wishes so the Hope of Success seemed so reasonable that nothing remained but to consider of proper Methods to accomplish her Scheme To attempt to reason the Case with  Sophia  did not appear to her one of those Methods For as  Betty  had reported from Mrs  Honour  that  Sophia  had a violent Inclination to  Jones  she conceived that to dissuade her from the Match was an Endeavour of the same Kind as it would be very heartily and earnestly to entreat a Moth not to fly into a Candle  If the Reader will please to remember that the Acquaintance which  Sophia  had with Lady  Bellaston  was contracted at the House of Mrs  Western  and must have grown at the very Time when Mrs  Fitzpatrick  lived with this latter Lady he will want no Information that Mrs  Fitzpatrick  must have been acquainted with her likewise They were besides both equally her distant Relations  After much Consideration therefore she resolved to go early in the Morning to that Lady and endeavour  to see her unknown to  Sophia  and to acquaint her with the whole Affair For she did not in the least doubt but that the prudent Lady who had often ridiculed romantic Love and indiscreet Marriages in her Conversation would very readily concur in her Sentiments concerning this Match and would lend her utmost Assistance to prevent it  This Resolution she accordingly executed and the next Morning before the Sun she huddled on her Cloaths and at a very unfashionable unseasonable unvisitable Hour went to Lady  Bellaston  to whom she got Access without the least Knowledge or Suspicion of  Sophia  who though not asleep lay at that Time awake in her Bed with  Honour  snoring by her Side  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  made many Apologies for this early abrupt Visit at an Hour when  'she said she should not have thought of disturbing her Ladyship but upon Business of the utmost Consequence'  She then opened the whole Affair told all she had heard from  Betty  and did not forget the Visit which  Jones  had paid to herself the preceding Evening  Lady  Bellaston  answered with a Smile  'Then you have seen this terrible Man Madam pray is he so very fine a Figure as he is represented For  Etoff  entertained me last Night almost two Hours with him The Wench I believe is in Love with him by Reputation'  Here the Reader will be apt to wonder but the Truth is that Mrs  Etoff  who had the Honour to pin and unpin the Lady  Bellaston  had received complete Information concerning the said Mr  Jones  and had faithfully conveyed the same to her Lady last Night or rather that Morning while she was undressing on which Accounts she had been detained in her Office above the Space of an Hour and half  The Lady indeed though generally well enough  pleased with the Narratives of Mrs  Etoff  at those Seasons gave an extraordinary Attention to her Account of  Jones  for  Honour  had described him as a very handsome Fellow and Mrs  Etoff  in her Hurry added so much to the Beauty of his Person to her Report that Lady  Bellaston  began to conceive him to be a kind of Miracle in Nature  The Curiosity which her Woman had inspired was now greatly increased by Mrs  Fitzpatrick  who spoke as much in Favour of the Person of  Jones  as she had before spoken in Dispraise of his Birth Character and Fortune  When Lady  Bellaston  had heard the whole she answered gravely  'Indeed Madam this is a Matter of great Consequence Nothing can certainly be more commendable than the Part you act and I shall be very glad to have my Share in the Preservation of a young Lady of so much Merit and for whom I have so much Esteem'  'Doth not your Ladyship think says Mrs  Fitzpatrick  eagerly that it would be the best Way to write immediately to my Uncle and acquaint him where my Cousin is'  The Lady pondered a little upon this and thus answered  'Why no Madam I think not  Di Western  hath described her Brother to me to be such a Brute that I cannot consent to put any Woman under his Power who hath escaped from it I have heard he behaved like a Monster to his own Wife for he is one of those Wretches who think they have a Right to tyrannize over us and from such I shall ever esteem it the Cause of my Sex to rescue any Woman who is so unfortunate to be under their PowerThe Business dear Cousin will be only to keep Miss  Western  from seeing this young Fellow till the good Company which she will  have an Opportunity of meeting here give her a proper Turn'  'If he should find her out Madam answered the other your Ladyship may be assured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her'  'But Madam replied the Lady it is impossible he should come heretho' indeed it is possible he may get some intelligence where she is and then may lurk about the HouseI wish therefore I knew his Person'  'Is there no Way Madam by which I could have a Sight of him For otherwise you know Cousin she may contrive to see him here without my Knowledge'  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  answer'd  'that he had threatened her with another Visit that Afternoon and that in her Ladyship pleased to do her the Honour of calling upon her then she would hardly fail of seeing him between six and seven and if he came earlier she would by some Means or other detain him till her Ladyship's Arrival'  Lady  Bellaston  replied  'she would come the Moment she could get from Dinner which she supposed would be by seven at farthest for that it was absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his Person Upon my Word Madam says she it was very good to take this Care of Miss  Western  but common Humanity as well as Regard to our Family requires it of us both for it would be a dreadful Match indeed'  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  failed not to make a proper Return to the Compliment which Lady  Bellaston  had bestow'd on her Cousin and after some little immaterial Conversation withdrew and getting as fast as she could into her Chair unseen by  Sophia  or  Honour  returned home  CHAP IV  Which consists of Visiting  MR  Jones  had walked within Sight of a certain Door during the whole Day which though one of the shortest appeared to him to be one of the longest in the whole Year At length the Clock having struck five he returned to Mrs  Fitzpatrick  who though it was a full Hour earlier than the decent Time of visiting receiv'd him very civilly but still persisted in her Ignorance concerning  Sophia  Jones  in asking for his Angel had drop'd the Word Cousin upon which Mrs  Fitzpatrick  said  'Then Sir you know we are related and as we are you will permit me the Right of enquiring into the Particulars of your Business with my Cousin'  Here  Jones  hesitated a good while and at last answered He had a considerable Sum of Money of hers in his Hands which he desired to deliver to her He then produced the Pocketbook and acquainted Mrs  Fitzpatrick  with the Contents and with the Method in which they came into his Hands He had scarce finished his Story when a most violent Noise shook the whole House To attempt to describe this Noise to those who have heard it would be in vain and to aim at giving any Idea of it to those who have never heard the like would be still more vain For it may be truly said  Non acuta  Sic geminant Corybantes Aera  The Priests of  Cybele  do not so rattle their sounding Brass  In short a Footman knocked or rather thundered at the Door  Jones  was a little surprised at the  Sound having never heard it before but Mrs  Fitzpatrick  very calmly said that as some Company were coming she could not make him any Answer now but if he pleased to stay till they were gone she intimated she had something to say to him  The Door of the Room now flew open and after pushing in her Hoop sideways before her entered Lady  Bellaston  who having first made a very low Curtesy to Mrs  Fitzpatrick  and as low a one to Mr  Jones  was ushered to the upper End of the Room  We mention these minute Matters for the Sake of some Country Ladies of our Acquaintance who think it contrary to the Rules of Modesty to bend their Knees to a Man  The Company were hardly well settled before the Arrival of the Peer lately mentioned caused a fresh Di  urbance and a Repetition of Ceremonials  here being over the Conversation began to be as the Phrase is extremely brilliant However as nothing past in it which can be thought material to this History or indeed very material in itself I shall omit the Relation the rather as I have known some very fine polite Conversation grow extreamly dull when transcribed into Books or repeated on the Stage Indeed this mental Repast is a Dainty of which those who are excluded from polite Assemblies must be contented to remain as ignorant as they must of the several Dainties of  French  Cookery which are only served at the Tables of the  Great  To say the Truth as neither of these are adapted to every Taste they might both be often thrown away on the Vulgar  Poor  Jones  was rather a Spectator of this elegant Scene than an Actor in it for though in the short Interval before the Peer's Arrival Lady  Bellaston  first and afterwards Mrs  Fitzpatrick  had addressed some of their Discourse to him yet no sooner was  the noble Lord entered than he engrossed the whole Attention of the two Ladies to himself and as he took no more Notice of  Jones  than if no such Person had been present unless by now and then staring at him the Ladies followed his Example  The Company had now staid so long that Mrs  Fitzpatrick  plainly perceived they all designed to stay out each other She therefore resolved to rid herself of  Jones  he being the Visitant to whom she thought the least Ceremony was due Taking therefore an Opportunity of a Cessation of Chat she addressed herself gravely to him and said  'Sir I shall not possibly be able to give you an Answer Tonight as to that Business but if you please to leave Word where I may send to you Tomorrow'    Jones  had natural but not artificial good Breeding Instead therefore of communicating the Secret of  is Lodgings to a Servant he acquainted the Lady  e  self with it particularly and soon after very ceremoniously withdrew  He was no sooner gone than the great Personages who had taken no Notice of him present began to take much Notice of him in his Absence but if the Reader hath already excused us from relating the more brilliant Part of this Conversation he will surely be very ready to excuse the Repetition of what may be called vulgar Abuse Though perhaps it may be material to our History to mention an Observation of Lady  Bellaston  who took her Leave in a few Minutes after him and then said to Mrs  Fitzpatrick  at her Departure  'I am satisfied on the Account of my Cousin she can be in no Danger from this Fellow'  Our History shall follow the Example of Lady  Bellaston  and take Leave of the present Company which was now reduced to two Persons between whom as nothing passed which in the least concerns us or our Reader we shall not suffer ourselves to be  diverted by it from Matters which must seem of more Consequence to all those who are at all interested in the Affairs of our Heroe  CHAP V  An Adventure which happened to Mr  Jones  at his Lodgings with some Account of a young Gentleman who lodged there and of the Mistress of the House and her two Daughters  THE next Morning as early as it was decent  Jones  attended at Mrs  Fitzpatrick'  s Door where he was answered that the Lady was not at Home an Answer which surprised him the more as he had walked backwards and forwards in the Street from Break of Day and if she had gone out he must have seen her This Answer however he was obliged to receive and not only now but to five several Visits which he made her that Day To be plain with the Reader the noble Peer had from some Reason or other perhaps from a Regard for the Lady's Honour insisted that she should not see Mr  Jones  whom he looked on as a Scrub any more and the Lady had complied in making that Promise to which we now see her so strictly adhere  But as our gentle Reader may possibly have a better Opinion of the young Gentleman than her Ladyship and may even have some Concern should it be apprehended that during this unhappy Separation from  Sophia  he took up his Residence either at an Inn or in the Street we shall now give an Account of his Lodging which was indeed in a very reputable House and in a very good Part of the Town  Mr  Jones  then had often heard Mr  Allworthy  mention the Gentlewoman at whose House he used to lodge when he was in Town This Person who as  Jones  likewise knew lived in  BondStreet  was the Widow of a Clergyman and was left by him at his Decease in Possession of two Daughters and of a compleat Set of Manuscript Sermons  Of these two Daughters  Nancy  the elder was now arrived at the Age of seventeen and  Betty  the younger at that of ten  Hither  Jones  had dispatched  Partridge  and in this House he was provided with a Room for himself in the second Floor and with one for  Partridge  in the fourth  The first Floor was inhabited by one of those young Gentlemen who in the last Age were called Men of Wit and Pleasure about Town and properly enough For as Men are usually denominated from their Business or Profession so Pleasure may be said to have been the only Business or Profession of those Gentlemen to whom Fortune had made all useful Occupations unnecessary PlayHouses CoffeeHouses and Taverns were the Scenes of their Rendezvous Wit and Humour were the Entertainment of their looser Hours and Love was the Business of their more serious Moments Wine and the Muses conspired to kindle the brightest Flames in their Breasts nor did they only admire but some were able to celebrate the Beauty they admired and all to judge of the Merit of such Compositions  Such therefore were properly called the Men of Wit and Pleasure but I question whether the same Appellation may with the same Propriety be given to those young Gentlemen of our Times who have the same Ambition to be distinguished for Parts Wit certainly they have nothing to do with To give them their due they soar a Step higher than their Predecessors and may be called Men of Wisdom and Vertù take heed you do not read Virtue Thus at an Age when the Gentlemen abovementioned employed their Time in toasting the Charms of a Woman or in  making Sonnets in her Praise in giving their Opinion of a Play at the Theatre or of a Poem at  Will'  s or  Button'  s these Gentlemen are considering of Methods to bribe a Corporation or meditating Speeches for the House of Commons or rather for the Magazines But the Science of Gaming is that which above all others employs their Thoughts These are the Studies of their graver Hours while for their Amusements they have the vast Circle of Connoisseurship Painting Music Statuary and natural Philosophy or rather  unnatural  which deals in the Wonderful and knows nothing of Nature except her Monsters and Imperfections  When  Jones  had spent the whole Day in vain Enquiries after Mrs  Fitzpatrick  he returned at last disconsolate to his Apartment Here while he was venting his Grief in private he heard a violent Uproar below Stairs and soon after a female Voice begged him for Heaven's Sake to come and prevent Murder  Jones  who was never backward on any Occasion to help the Distressed immediately ran down Stairs when stepping into the Diningroom whence all the Noise issued he beheld the young Gentleman of Wisdom and  Vertù  just before mentioned pinned close to the Wall by his Footman and a young Woman standing by wringing her Hands and crying out  'He will be murdered he will be murdered and indeed the poor Gentleman seemed in some Danger of being choaked'  when  Jones  flew hastily to his Assistance and rescued him just as he was breathing his last from the unmerciful Clutches of the Enemy  Though the Fellow had received several Kicks and Cuffs from the little Gentleman who had more Spirit than Strength he had made it a kind of Scruple of Conscience to strike his Master and would have contented himself with only choaking him but towards  Jones  he bore no such Respect He no sooner therefore  found himself a little roughly handled by his new Antagonist than he gave him one of those Punches in the Guts which tho' the Spectators at  Broughton'  s Amphitheatre have such exquisite Delight in Seeing them convey but very little Pleasure in the Feeling  The lusty Youth had no sooner received this Blow than he meditated a most grateful Return and now ensued a Combat between  Jones  and the Footman which was very fierce but short for this Fellow was no more able to contend with  Jones  than his Master had before been to contend with him  And now Fortune according to her usual Custom reversed the Face of Affairs the former Victor lay breathless on the Ground and the vanquished Gentleman had recovered Breath enough to thank Mr  Jones  for his seasonable Assistance He received likewise the hearty Thanks of the young Woman present who was indeed no other than Miss  Nancy  the eldest Daughter of the House  The Footman having now recovered his Legs shook his Head at  Jones  and with a sagacious Look cry'dO dn me I'll have nothing more to do with you you have been upon the Stage or I am dnably mistaken And indeed we may forgive this his Suspicion for such was the Agility and Strength of our Heroe that he was perhaps a Match for one of the first Rate Boxers and could with great Ease have beaten all the muffled  Lest Posterity should be puzzled by this Epithet I think proper to explain it by an Advertisement which was published  Feb    N B  Mr  Broughton  proposes with proper Assistance to open an Academy at his House in the  HayMarket  for the Instruction of those who are willing to be initiated in the Mystery of Boxing where the whole Theory and Practice of that truly  British  Art with all the various Stops Blows CrossButtocks  c  incident to Combatants will be fully taught and explain'd and that Persons of Quality and Distinction may not be deterred from entering into  a Course of these Lectures  they will be given with the utmost Tenderness and Regard to the Delicacy of the Frame and Constitution of the Pupil for which Reason Mufflers are provided that will effectually secure them from the Inconveniency of black Eyes broken Jaws and bloody Noses  Graduates of Mr  Broughton'  s School  His Master foaming with Wrath ordered his Man immediately to strip to which the latter very readily agreed on Condition of receiving his Wages This Condition was presently complied with and the Fellow was discharged  And now the young Gentleman whose Name was  Nightingale  very strenuously insisted that his Deliverer should take Part of a Bottle of Wine with him to which  Jones  after much Entreaty consented tho' more out of Complaisance than Inclination for the Uneasiness of his Mind fitted him very little for Conversation at this Time Miss  Nancy  likewise who was the only Female then in the House her Mamma and Sister being gone to the Play condescended to favour them with her Company  When the Bottle and Glasses were on the Table the Gentleman began to relate the Occasion of the preceding Disturbance  'I hope Sir said he to  Jones  you will not from this Accident conclude that I make a Custom of striking my Servants for I assure you this is the first Time I have been guilty of it in my Remembrance and I have passed by many provoking Faults in this very Fellow before he could provoke me to it but when you hear what hath happened this Evening you will I believe think me  excuseable I happened to come home several Hours before my usual Time when I found four Gentlemen of the Cloth at Whisk by my Fireand my  Hoyle  Sirmy best  Hoyle  which cost me a Guinea lying open on the Table with a Quantity of Porter spilt on one of the most material Leaves of the whole Book This you will allow was provoking but I said nothing till the rest of the honest Company were gone and then gave the Fellow a gentle Rebuke who instead of expressing any Concern made me a pert Answer  '"That Servants must have their Diversions as well as other People that he was sorry for the Accident which had happened to the Book but that several of his Acquaintance had bought the same for a Shilling and that I might stop as much in his Wages if I pleased"  'I now gave him a severer Reprimand than before when the Rascal had the Insolence toIn short he imputed my early coming Home toIn short he cast a ReflectionHe mentioned the Name of a young Lady in a MannerIn such a Manner that incensed me beyond all Patience and in my Passion I struck him'  Jones  answered  'That he believed no Person living would blame him for my Part said he I confess I should on the last mentioned Provocation have done the same Thing'  Our Company had not sat long before they were joined by the Mother and Daughter at their Return from the Play And now they all spent a very chearful Evening together for all but  Jones  were heartily merry and even he put on as much constrained Mirth as possible Indeed half his natural Flow of animal Spirits joined to the Sweetness of his Temper was sufficient to make a most amiable Companion and notwithstanding the Heaviness of his Heart so agreeable did he make himself on the present Occasion  that at their breaking up the young Gentleman earnestly desired his further Acquaintance Miss  Nancy  was well pleased with him and the Widow quite charm'd with her new Lodger invited him with the other next Morning to Breakfast  Jones  on his Part was no less satisfied As for Miss  Nancy  tho' a very little Creature she was extremely pretty and the Widow had all the Charms which can adorn a Woman near fifty As she was one of the most innocent Creatures in the World so she was one of the most chearful She never thought nor spoke nor wished any ill and had constantly that Desire of pleasing which may be called the happiest of all Desires in this that it scarce ever fails of attaining its Ends when not disgraced by Affectation In short though her Power was very small she was in her Heart one of the warmest Friends She had been a most affectionate Wife and was a most fond and tender Mother  As our History doth not like a NewsPaper give great Characters to People who never were heard of before nor will ever be heard of again the Reader may hence conclude that this excellent Woman will hereafter appear to be of some Importance in our History  Nor was  Jones  a little pleased with the young Gentleman himself whose Wine he had been drinking He thought he discerned in him much good Sense though a little too much tainted with Town Foppery but what recommended him most to  Jones  were some Sentiments of great Generosity and Humanity which occasionally dropt from him and particularly many Expressions of the highest Disinterestedness in the Affair of Love On which Subject the young Gentleman delivered himself in a Language which might have very well become an  Arcadian  Shepherd of Old and which appeared very extraordinary when  proceeding from the Lips of a modern fine Gentleman but he was only one by Imitation and meant by Nature for a much better Character  CHAP VI  What arrived while the Company were at Breakfast with some Hints concerning the Government of Daughters  OUR Company brought together in the Morning the same good Inclinations towards each other with which they had separated the Evening before but poor  Jones  was extreme disconsolate for he had just received Information from  Partridge  that Mrs  Fitzpatrick  had left her Lodging and that he could not learn whither she was gone This News highly affected him and his Countenance as well as his Behaviour in Defiance of all his Endeavours to the contrary betrayed manifest Indications of a disordered Mind  The Discourse turned at present as before on Love and Mr  Nightingale  again expressed many of those warm generous and disinterested Sentiments upon this Subject which wise and sober Men call romantic but which wise and sober Women generally regard in a better Light Mrs  Miller  for so the Mrs of the House was called greatly approved these Sentiments but when the young Gentleman appealed to Miss  Nancy  she answered only  'That she believed the Gentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling the most'  This Compliment was so apparently directed to  Jones  that we should have been sorry had he passed it by unregarded He made her indeed a very polite Answer and concluded with an oblique Hint that her own Silence subjected her to a Suspicion of the same  Kind For indeed she had scarce opened her Lips either now or the last Evening  'I am glad  Nanny  says Mrs  Miller  the Gentleman hath made the Observation I protest I am almost of his Opinion What can be the Matter with you Child I never saw such an Alteration What is become of all your Gayety Would you think Sir I used to call her my little Prattler She hath not spoke twenty Words this Week'  Here their Conversation was interrupted by the Entrance of a MaidServant who brought a Bundle in her Hands which she said  'was delivered by a Porter for Mr  Jones  '  She added  'that the Man immediately went away saying it required no Answer'  Jones  expressed some Surprize on this Occasion and declared it must be some Mistake But the Maid persisting that she was certain of the Name all the Women were desirous of having the Bundle immediately opened which Operation was at length performed by little  Betsy  with the Consent of Mr  Jones  and the Contents were found to be a Domino a Mask and a Masquerade Ticket  Jones  was now more positive than ever in asserting that these Things must have been delivered by Mistake and Mrs  Miller  herself expressed some Doubt and said  'she knew not what to think'  But when Mr  Nightingale  was asked he delivered a very different Opinion  'All I can conclude from it Sir' said he 'is that you are a very happy Man For I make no doubt but these were sent you by some Lady whom you will have the Happiness of meeting at the Masquerade'  Jones  had not a sufficient Degree of Vanity to entertain any such flattering Imagination nor did Mrs  Miller  herself give much Assent to what Mr  Nightingale  had said 'till Miss  Nancy  having lifted up the  Domino a Card dropt from the Sleeve in which was written as follows  To Mr  Jones  The Queen of the Fairies sends you this  Use her Favours not amiss  Mrs  Miller  and Miss  Nancy  now both agreed with Mr  Nightingale  nay  Jones  himself was almost persuaded to be of the same Opinion And as no other Lady but Mrs  Fitzpatrick  he thought knew his Lodging he began to flatter himself with some Hopes that it came from her and that he might possibly see his  Sophia  These Hopes had surely very little Foundation but as the Conduct of Mr  Fitzpatrick  in not seeing him according to her Promise and in quitting her Lodgings had been very odd and unaccountable he conceived some faint Hopes that she of whom he had formerly heard a very whimsical Character might possibly intend to do him that Service in a strange Manner which she declined doing by more ordinary Methods To say the Truth as nothing certain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an Incident he had the greater Latitude to draw what imaginary Conclusions from it he pleased As his Temper therefore was naturally sanguine he indulged it on this Occasion and his Imagination worked up a thousand Conceits to favour and support his Expectations of meeting his dear  Sophia  in the Evening  Reader if thou hast any good Wishes towards me I will fully repay them by wishing thee to be possessed of this sanguine Disposition of Mind Since after having read much and considered long on that Subject of Happiness which hath employed so many great Pens I am almost inclined to fix it in the Possession of this Temper which puts us in a Manner out of the Reach of Fortune and makes us happy without  her Assistance Indeed the Sensations of Pleasure it gives are much more constant as well as much keener than those which that blind Lady bestows Nature having wisely contrived that some Satiety and Languor should be annexed to all our real Enjoyments lest we should be so taken up by them as to be stopt from further Pursuits I make no Manner of doubt but that in this Light we may see the imaginary future Chancellor just called to the Bar the Archbishop in Crape and the Prime Minister at the Tail of an Opposition more truly happy than those who are invested with all the Power and Profit of these respective Offices  Mr  Jones  having now determined to go to the Masquerade that Evening Mr  Nightingale  offered to conduct him thither The young Gentleman at the same Time offered Tickets to Miss  Nancy  and her Mother but the good Woman would not accept them She said  'She did not conceive the Harm which some People imagined in a Masquerade but that such extravagant Diversions were only proper for Persons of Quality and Fortune and not for young Women who were to get their Living and could at best hope to be married to a good Tradesman'    'A Tradesman cries  Nightingale  you shan't undervalue my  Nancy  There is not a Nobleman upon Earth above her Merit'  'O fie Mr  Nightingale  ' answered Mrs  Miller  'you must not fill the Girl's Head with such Fancies But if it was her good Luck says the Mother with a Simper to find a Gentleman of your generous Way of thinking I hope she would make a better Return to his Generosity than to give her Mind up to extravagant Pleasures Indeed where young Ladies bring great Fortunes themselves they have some Right to insist on spending what is their own  and on that Account I have heard the Gentlemen say a Man has sometimes a better Bargain with a poor Wife than with a rich oneBut let my Daughters marry whom they will I shall endeavour to make them Blessings to their HusbandsI beg therefore I may hear of no more Masquerades  Nancy  is I am certain too good a Girl to desire to go for she must remember when you carried her thither last Year it almost turned her Head and she did not return to herself or to her Needle in a Month afterwards'  Though a gentle Sigh which stole from the Bosom of  Nancy  seemed to argue some secret Disapprobation of these Sentiments she did not dare openly to oppose them For as this good Woman had all the Tenderness so she had preserved all the Authority of a Parent and as her Indulgence to the Desires of her Children was only restrained by her Fears for their Safety and future Welfare so she never suffered those Commands which proceeded from such Fears to be either disobeyed or disputed And this the young Gentleman who had lodged two Years in the House knew so well that he presently acquiesced in the Refusal  Mr  Nightingale  who grew every Minute fonder of  Jones  was very desirous of his Company that Day to Dinner at the Tavern where he offered to introduce him to some of his Acquaintance but  Jones  begged to be excused  'as his Cloaths he said were not yet come to Town'  To confess the Truth Mr  Jones  was now in a Situation which sometimes happens to be the Case of young Gentlemen of much better Figure than himself In short he had not one Penny in his Pocket a Situation in much greater Credit among the ancient Philosophers than among the modern wise Men who live in  Lombard  Street or those who frequent  White'  s  Chocolate House And perhaps the great Honours which those Philosophers have ascribed to an empty Pocket may be one of the Reasons of that high Contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid Street and ChocolateHouse  Now if the antient Opinion that Men might live very comfortably on Virtue only be as the modern wise Men just abovementioned pretend to have discovered a notorious Error no less false is I apprehend that Position of some Writers of Romance that a Man can live altogether on Love For however delicious Repasts this may afford to some of our Senses or Appetites it is most certain it can afford none to others Those therefore who have placed too great a Confidence in such Writers have experienced their Error when it was too late and have found that Love was no more capable of allaying Hunger than a Rose is capable of delighting the Ear or a Violin of gratifying the Smell  Notwithstanding therefore all the Delicacies which Love had set before him namely the Hopes of seeing  Sophia  at the Masquerade on which however illfounded his Imagination might be he had voluptuously feasted during the whole Day the Evening no sooner came than Mr  Jones  began to languish for some Food of a grosser Kind  Partridge  discovered this by Intution and took the Occasion to give some oblique Hints concerning the Bankbill and when those were rejected with Disdain he collected Courage enough once more to mention a Return to Mr  Allworthy  'Partridge  cries  Jones  you cannot see my Fortune in a more desperate Light than I see it myself and I begin heartily to repent that I suffered you to leave a Place where you was settled and to follow me However I insist now on your returning Home and for the Expence and Trouble which  you have so kindly put yourself to on my Account all the Cloaths I left behind in your Care I desire you would take as your own I am sorry I can make you no other Acknowledgment'  He spoke these Words with so pathetic an Accent that  Partridge  among whose Vices IllNature or Hardness of Heart were not numbered burst into Tears and after swearing he would not quit him in his Distress he began with the most earnest Intreaties to urge his return Home  'For Heaven's Sake Sir' says he 'do but consider What can your Honour do How is it possible you can live in this Town without Money Do what you will Sir or go wherever you please I am resolved not to desert youBut pray Sir considerDo pray Sir for your own Sake take it into your Consideration and I'm sure' says he 'that your own GoodSense will bid you return Home'  'How often shall I tell thee answered  Jones  that I have no Home to return to Had I any Hopes that Mr  Allworthy'  s Doors would be open to receive me I want no Distress to urge meNay there is no other Cause upon Earth which could detain me a Moment from flying to his Presence but alas that I am for ever banished from it His last Words wereO  Partridge  they still ring in my EarsHis last Words were when he gave me a Sum of Money what it was I know not but considerable I'm sure it wasHis last Words wereI am resolved from this Day forward on no Account to converse with you any more'  Here Passion stopt the Mouth of  Jones  as Surprize for a Moment did that of  Partridge  But he soon recovered the Use of Speech and after a short Preface in which he declared he had no Inquisitiveness in his Temper enquired what  Jones  meant by  a considerable Sum he knew not how much and what was become of the Money  In both these Points he now received full Satisfaction on which he was proceeding to comment when he was interrupted by a Message from Mr  Nightingale  who desired his Master's Company in his Apartment  When the two Gentlemen were both attired for the Masquerade and Mr  Nightingale  had given Orders for Chairs to be sent for a Circumstance of Distress occurred to  Jones  which will appear very ridiculous to many of my Readers This was how to procure a Shilling but if such Readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from the Want of a thousand Pound or perhaps of ten or twenty to execute a favourite Scheme they will have a perfect Idea of what Mr  Jones  felt on this Occasion For this Sum therefore he applied to  Partridge  which was the first he had permitted him to advance and was the last he intended that poor Fellow should advance in his Service To say the Truth  Partridge  had lately made no Offer of this Kind whether it was that he desired to see the Bankbill broke in upon or that Distress should prevail on  Jones  to return Home or from what other Motive it proceeded I will not determine  CHAP VII  Containing the whole Humours of a Masquerade  OUR Cavaliers now arrived at that Temple where  Heydegger  the great  Arbiter Deliciarum  the great HighPriest of Pleasure presides and like other Heathen Priests imposes on his Votaries by the pretended Presence of the Deity when in reality no such Deity is there  Mr  Nightingale  having taken a Turn or two with  his Companion soon left him and walked off with a Female saying  'Now you are here Sir you must beat about for your own Game'  Jones  began to entertain strong Hopes that his  Sophia  was present and these Hopes gave him more Spirits than the Lights the Music and the Company though these are pretty strong Antidotes against the Spleen He now accosted every Woman he saw whose Stature Shape or Air bore any Resemblance to his Angel To all of whom he endeavoured to say something smart in order to engage an Answer by which he might discover that Voice which he thought it impossible he should mistake Some of these answered by a Question in a squeaking Voice  Do you know me  Much the greater Numbers said  I don't know you Sir  and nothing more Some called him an impertinent Fellow some made him no Answer at all some said  Indeed I don't know your Voice and I shall have nothing to say to you  and many gave him as kind Answers as he could wish but not in the Voice he desired to hear  Whilst he was talking with one of these last who was in the Habit of a Shepherdess a Lady in a Domino came up to him and slapping him on the Shoulder whispered him at the same Time in the Ear  'If you talk any longer with that Trollop I will acquaint Miss  Western  '  Jones  no sooner heard that Name than immediately quitting his former Companion he applied to the Domino begging and entreating her to shew him the Lady she had mentioned if she was then in the Room  The Mask walked hastily to the upper end of the innermost Apartment before she spoke and then instead of answering him sat down and declared she was tired  Jones  sat down by her and still persisted in his Entreaties at last the Lady coldly answered  'I imagined Mr  Jones  had been a more discerning Lover than to suffer any Disguise to conceal his Mistress from him Is she here then Madam replied  Jones  with much Vehemence'  Upon which the Lady cry'd  'Hush Sir you will be observedI promise you upon my Honour Miss  Western  is not here'  Jones  now taking the Mask by the Hand fell to entreating her in the most earnest Manner to acquaint him where he might find  Sophia  And when he could obtain no direct Answer he began to upbraid her gently for having disappointed him the Day before and concluded saying  'Indeed my good Fairy Queen I know your Majesty very well notwithstanding the affected Disguise of your Voice Indeed Mrs  Fitzpatrick  it is a little cruel to divert yourself at the Expence of my Torments'  The Mask answered  'Though you have so ingeniously discovered me I must still speak in the same Voice lest I should be known by others And do you think good Sir that I have no greater Regard for my Cousin than to assist in carrying on an Affair between you two which must end in her Ruin as well as your own Besides I promise you my Cousin is not mad enough to consent to her own Destruction if you are so much her Enemy as to tempt her to it'  'Alas Madam said  Jones  you little know my Heart when you call me an Enemy of  Sophia  '  'And yet to ruin any one cries the other you will allow is the Act of an Enemy and when by the same Act you must knowingly and certainly bring Ruin on yourself is it not Folly or Madness as well as Guilt Now Sir my Cousin hath very little more than her Father will please to give her very little for one of her Fashionyou know him and you know your own Situation'  Jones  vowed he had no such Design on  Sophia  'That he would rather suffer the most violent of Deaths than sacrifice her Interest to his Desires He said he knew how unworthy he was of her every Way that he had long ago resolved to quit all such aspiring Thoughts but that some strange Accidents had made him desirous to see her once more when he promised he would take Leave of her for ever No Madam concluded he my Love is not of that base Kind which seeks its own Satisfaction at the Expence of what is most dear to its Object I would sacrifice every Thing to the Possession of my  Sophia  but  Sophia  herself'  Though the Reader may have already conceived no very sublime Idea of the Virtue of the Lady in the Mask and tho' possibly she may hereafter appear not to deserve one of the first Characters of her Sex yet it is certain these generous Sentiments made a strong Impression upon her and greatly added to the Affection she had before conceived for our young Heroe  The Lady now after a Silence of a few Moments said  'She did not see his Pretensions to  Sophia  so much in the Light of Presumption as of Imprudence Young Fellows says she can never have too aspiring Thoughts I love Ambition in a young Man and I would have you cultivate it as much as possible Perhaps you may succeed with those who are infinitely superior in Fortune nay I am convinced there are Womenbut don't you think me a stronge Creature Mr  Jones  to be thus giving Advice to a Man with whom I am so little acquainted and one with whose Behaviour to me I have so little Reason to be pleased'  Here  Jones  began to apologize and to hope he had not offended in any thing he had said of her Cousin To which the Mask answered  'And are you so little versed in the Sex to imagine you can well  affront a Lady more than by entertaining her with your Passion for another Woman If the Fairy Queen had had no better Opinion of your Gallantry she would scarce have appointed you to meet her at a Masquerade'  Jones  had never less Inclination to an Amour than at present but Gallantry to the Ladies was among his Principles of Honour and he held it as much incumbent on him to accept a Challenge to Love as if it had been a Challenge to Fight Nay his very Love to  Sophia  made it necessary for him to keep well with the Lady as he made no doubt but she was capable of bringing him into the Presence of the other  He began therefore to make a very warm Answer to her last Speech when a Mask in the Character of an old Woman joined them This Mask was one of those Ladies who go to a Masquerade only to vent Illnature by telling People rude Truths and by endeavouring as the Phrase is to spoil as much Sport as they are able This good Lady therefore having observed  Jones  and his Friend whom she well knew in close Consultation together in a Corner of the Room concluded she could no where satisfy her Spleen better than by interrupting them She attacked them therefore and soon drove them from their Retirement nor was she contented with this but pursued them to every Place which they shifted to avoid her till Mr  Nightingale  seeing the Distress of his Friend at last relieved him and engaged the old Woman in another Pursuit  While  Jones  and his Mask were walking together about the Room to rid themselves of the Teazer he observed his Lady speak to several Masks with the same Freedom of Acquaintance as if they had been barefaced He could not help expressing his Surprise at this saying  'Sure Madam you must have infinite Discernment to know People in all Disguises'  To which the Lady answered  'You cannot conceive any Thing more insipid and childish than a Masquerade to the People of Fashion who in general know one another as well here as when they meet in an Assembly or a Drawingroom nor will any Woman of Condition converse with a Person with whom she is not acquainted In short the Generality of Persons whom you see here may more properly be said to kill Time in this Place than in any other and generally retire from hence more tired than from the longest Sermon To say the Truth I begin to be in that Situation myself and if I have any Faculty at guessing you are not much better pleased I protest it would be almost Charity in me to go Home for your Sake'  'I know but one Charity equal to it cries  Jones  and that is to suffer me to wait on you Home Sure answered the Lady you have a strange opinion of me to imagine that upon such an Acquaintance I would let you into my Doors at this Time o'Night I fancy you impute the Friendship I have shewn my Cousin to some other Motive Confess honestly don't you consider this contrived Interview as little better than a downright Assignation Are you used Mr  Jones  to make these sudden Conquests I am not used Madam said  Jones  to submit to such sudden Conquests but as you have taken my Heart by Surprize the rest of my Body hath a Right to follow so you must pardon me if I resolve to attend you wherever you go'  He accompanied these Words with some proper Actions upon which the Lady after a gentle Rebuke and saying their Familiarity would be observed told him  'She was going to sup with an Acquaintance whither she hoped he would not follow her for if you should said she I shall be thought an unaccountable Creature though my Friend indeed is not censorious yet I  hope you won't follow me I protest I shall not know what to say if you do'  The Lady presently after quitted the Masquerade and  Jones  notwithstanding the severe Prohibition he had received presumed to attend her He was now reduced to the same Dilemma we have mentioned before namely the want of Shilling and could not relieve it by borrowing as before He therefore walked boldly on after the Chair in which his Lady rode pursued by a grand Huzza from all the Chairmen present who wisely take the best Care they can to discountenance all walking afoot by their Betters Luckily however the Gentry who attend at the OperaHouse were too busy to quit their Stations and as the Lateness of the Hour prevented him from meeting many of their Brethren in the Street he proceeded without Molestation in a Dress which at another Season would have certainly raised a Mob at his Heels  The Lady was set down in a Street not far from  HanoverSquare  where the Door being presently opened she was carried in and the Gentleman without any Ceremony walked in after her  Jones  and his Companion were now together in a very wellfurnished and wellwarm'd Room when the Female still speaking in her Masquerade Voice said she was surprized at her Friend who must absolutely have forgot her Appointment at which after venting much Resentment she suddenly exprest some Apprehension from  Jones  and asked him what the World would think of their having been alone together in a House at that Time of Night But instead of a direct Answer to so important a Question  Jones  began to be very importunate with the Lady to unmask and at length having prevailed there appeared not Mrs  Fitzpatrick  but the Lady  Bellaston  herself  It would be tedious to give the particular Conversation  which consisted of very common and ordinary Occurrences and which lasted from two till six o'Clock in the Morning It is sufficient to mention all of it that is any wise material to this History And this was a Promise that the Lady would endeavour to find out  Sophia  and in a few Days bring him to an Interview with her on Condition that he would then take his Leave of her When this was thoroughly settled and a second Meeting in the Evening appointed at the same Place they separated the Lady returned to her House and  Jones  to his Lodgings  CHAP VIII  Containing a Scene of Distress which will appear very extraordinary to most of our Readers  JONES  having refreshed himself with a few Hours Sleep summoned  Partridge  to his Presence and delivering him a Bank Note of fifty Pounds ordered him to go and change it  Partridge  received this with sparkling Eyes though when he came to reflect farther it raised in him some Suspicions not very advantageous to the Honour of his Master to these the dreadful Idea he had of the Masquerade the Disguise in which his Master had gone out and returned and his having been abroad all Night contributed In plain Language the only Way he could possibly find to account for the Possession of this Note was by Robbery and to confess the Truth the Reader unless he should suspect it was owing to the Generosity of Lady  Bellaston  can hardly imagine any other  To clear therefore the Honour of Mr  Jones  and to do Justice to the Liberality of the Lady he had really received this Present from her who though she did not give much in to the Hackney Charities of the Age such as building Hospitals  c  was not however entirely void of that Christian Virtue and conceived  very righty I think that a young Fellow of Merit without a Shilling in the World was no improper Object of this Virtue  Mr  Jones  and Mr  Nightingale  had been invited to dine this Day with Mrs  Miller  At the appointed Hour therefore the two young Gentlemen with the two Girls attended in the Parlour where they waited from three till almost five before the good Woman appeared She had been out of Town to visit a Relation of whom at her Return she gave the following Account  'I hope Gentlemen you will pardon my making you wait I am sure if you knew the OccasionI have been to see a Cousin of mine about six Miles off who now lies inIt should be a Warning to all Persons says she looking at her Daughters how they marry indiscreetly There is no Happiness in this World without a Competency O  Nancy  how shall I describe the wretched Condition in which I found your poor Cousin she hath scarce lain in a Week and there was she this dreadful Weather in a cold Room without any Curtains to her Bed and not a Bushel of Coals in her House to supply her with Fire Her second Son that sweet little Fellow lies ill of a Quinzy in the same Bed with his Mother for there is no other Bed in the House Poor little  Tommy  I believe  Nancy  you will never see your Favourite any more for he is really very ill The rest of the Children are in pretty good Health but  Molly  I am afraid will do herself an Injury she is but thirteen Years old Mr  Nightingale  and yet in my Life I never saw a better Nurse She tends both her Mother and her Brother and what is wonderful in a Creature so young she shows all the Chearfulness in the World to her Mother and yet I saw herI saw the poor Child Mr  Nightingale  turn about  and privately wipe the Tears from her Eyes'  Here Mrs  Miller  was prevented by her own Tears from going on and there was not I believe a Person present who did not accompany her in them at length she a little recovered herself and proceeded thus  'In all this Distress the Mother supports her Spirits in a surprising Manner The Danger of her Son sits heaviest upon her and yet she endeavours as much as possible to conceal even this Concern on her Husband's Account Her Grief however sometimes gets the better of all her Endeavours for she was always extravagantly fond of this Boy and a most sensible sweettempered Creature it is I protest never was I more affected in my Life than when I heard the little Wretch who is hardly yet seven Years old while his Mother was wetting him with her Tears beg her to be comfortedIndeed Mamma cry'd the Child I shan't die God Almighty I'm sure wont take  Tommy  away let Heaven be ever so fine a Place I had rather stay here and starve with you and my Papa than go to itPardon me Gentlemen I can't help it saus she wiping her Eyes such Sensibility and Affection in a ChildAnd yet perhaps he is least the Object of Pity for a Day or two will most probably place him beyond the Reach of all human Evils The Father is indeed most worthy of Compassion Poor Man his Countenance is the very Picture of Horror and he looks rather like one dead than alive Oh Heavens what a Scene did I behold at my first coming into the Room The good Creature was lying behind the Bolster supporting at once both his Child and his Wife He had nothing on but a thin Waistcoat for his Coat was spread over the Bed to supply the Want of BlanketsWhen he rose up at my Entrance I scarce knew him As comely a Man Mr  Jones  within this Fortnight as you ever beheld Mr  Nightingle  had seen him His Eyes sunk his Face pale with a long Beard His Body shivering with Cold and worn with Hunger too for my Cousin says she can hardly prevail upon him to eatHe told me himself in a Whisperhe told meI can't repeat ithe said he could not bear to eat the Bread his Children wanted And yet can you believe it Gentlemen In all this Misery his Wife has as good a Cawdle as if she lay in in the midst of the greatest Affluence I tasted it and I scarce ever tasted betterThe Means of procuring her this' he said he believed was sent him by an Angel from Heaven I know not what he meant for I had not Spirits enough to ask a single Question'  'This was a LoveMatch as they call it on both Sides that is a Match between two Beggars I must indeed say I never saw a fonder Couple but what is their Fondness good for but to torment each other Indeed Mamma cries  Nancy  I have always looked on my Cousin  Anderson  for that was her Name as one of the happiest of Women'  I am sure' says Mrs  Miller  'the Case at present is much otherwise for any one might have discerned that the tender Consideration of each other's Sufferings makes the most intolerable Part of their Calamity both to the Husband and the Wife Compared to which Hunger and Cold as they affect their own Persons only are scarce Evils Nay the very Children the youngest which is not two Years old excepted feel in the same Manner for they are a most loving Family and if they had but a bare Competency would be the happiest People in the World I never saw the least Sign of Misery at her House replied  Nancy  I am sure my Heart bleeds for what  you now tell meO Child' answered the Mother 'she hath always endeavoured to make the best of every Thing They have always been in great Distress but indeed this absolute Ruin hath been brought upon them by others The poor Man was Bail for the Villain his Brother and about a Week ago the very Day before her Lyingin their Goods were all carried away and sold by an Execution He sent a Letter to me of it by one of the Bailiffs which the Villain never deliveredWhat must he think of my suffering a Week to pass before he heard of me'  It was not with dry Eyes that  Jones  heard this Narrative when it was ended he took Mrs  Miller  apart with him into another Room and delivering her his Purse in which was the Sum of  l  desired her to send as much of it as she thought proper to these poor People The Look which Mrs  Miller  gave  Jones  on this Occasion is not easy to be described She burst into a Kind of Agony of Transport and cry'd out  'Good Heavens Is there such a Man in the World'  But recollecting herself she said  'Indeed I know one such but can there be another I hope Madam cries  Jones  there are many who have common Humanity For to relieve such Distresses in our FellowCreatures can hardly be called more'  Mrs  Miller  then took ten Guineas which were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept and said  'she would find some Means of conveying them the next Morning' adding 'that she had herself done some little Matter for the poor People and had not left them in quite so much Misery as she found them'  They then returned to the Parlour where  Nightingale  express'd much Concern at the dreadful Situation of these Wretches whom indeed he knew  for he had seen them more than once at Mrs  Mil  ler's  He inveighed against the Folly of making one's self liable for the Debts of others vented many bitter Execrations against the Brother and concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate Family  'Suppose Madam said he you should recommend them to Mr  Allworthy  Or what think you of a Collection I will give them a Guinea with all my Heart'  Mrs  Miller  made no Answer and  Nancy  to whom her Mother had whispered the Generosity of  Jones  turned pale upon the Occasion though if either of them was angry with  Nightingale  it was surely without Reason For the Liberality of  Jones  he had known it was not an Example which he had any Obligation to follow and there are Thousands who would not have contributed a single Halfpenny as indeed he did not in Effect for he made no Tender of any Thing and therefore as the others thought proper to make no Demand he kept his Money in his Pocket  I have in Truth observed and shall never have a better Opportunity than at present to communicate my Observation that the World are in general divided into two Opinions concerning Charity which are he very reverse of each other One Party seems to  old that all Acts of this Kind are to be esteemed as  oluntary Gifts and however little you give if in  eed no more than your good Wishes you acquire a  reat Degree of Merit in so doingOthers on the  ontrary appear to be as firmly persuaded that Be  eficence is a positive Duty and that whenever the  ich fall greatly short of their Ability in relieving the Distresses of the Poor their pitiful Largesses are so  r from being meritorious that they have only per  ormed their Duty by Halves and are in some Sense more contemptible than those who have entirely ne  lected it  To reconcile these different Opinions is not in my Power I shall only add that the Givers are generally of the former Sentiment and the Receivers are almost universally inclined to the latter  CHAP IX  Which treats of Matters of a very different Kind from those in the preceding Chapter  IN the Evening  Jones  met his Lady again and a long Conversation again ensued between them but as it consisted only of the same ordinary Occurrences as before we shall avoid mentioning Particulars which we despair of rendring agreeable to the Reader unless he is one whose Devotion to the Fair Sex like that of the Papists to their Saints wants to be raised by the Help of Pictures But I am so far from desiring to exhibit such Pictures to the Public that I would wish to draw a Curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain  French  Novels very bungling Copies of which have been presented us here under the Name of Translations  Jones  grew still more and more impatient to see  Sophia  and finding after repeated Interviews with Lady  Bellaston  no Likelihood of obtaining this by her Means for on the contrary the Lady began to treat even the Mention of the Name of  Sophia  with Resentment he resolved to try some other Method He made no Doubt but that Lady  Bellaston  knew where his Angel was so he thought it most likely that some of her Servants should be acquainted with the same Secret  Partridge  therefore was employed to get acquainted with those Servants in order to fish this Secret out of them  Few Situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor Master was at present reduced for besides the Difficulties he met with in discovering  Sophia  besides the Fears he had of having disobliged  er and the Assurances he had received from the Lady  Bellaston  of the Resolution which  Sophia  had taken against him and of her having purposely concealed herself from him which he had sufficient Reason to believe might be true he had still a Difficulty to combat which it was not in the Power of his Mistress to remove however kind her Inclination might have been This was the exposing of her to be disinherited of all her Father's Estate the almost inevitable Consequence of their coming together without a Consent which he had no Hopes of ever obtaining  Add to all these the many Obligations which Lady  Bellaston  whose violent Fondness we can no longer conceal had heaped upon him so that by her Means he was now become one of the best dress'd Men about Town and was not only relieved from those ridiculous Distresses we have before mentioned but was actually raised to a State of Affluence beyond what he had ever known  Now though there are many Gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their Consciences to possess themselves of the whole Fortune of a Woman without making her any Kind of Return yet to a Mind the  roprietor of which doth not deserve to be hang'd  othing is I believe more irksome than to support Love with Gratitude only especially where Inclina  ion pulls the Heart a contrary Way Such was the unhappy Case of  Jones  for tho' the virtuous Love which he bore to  Sophia  and which left very little Affection for any other Woman had been entirely out of the Question he could never have been able to  ave made an adequate Return to the generous Pas  ion of this Lady who had indeed been once an Ob  ect of Desire but was now entered at least into the Autumn of Life though she wore all the Gayety of Youth both in her Dress and Manner nay she contrived  still to maintain the Roses in her Cheeks but these like Flowers forced out of Season by Art had none of that lively blooming Freshness with which Nature at the proper Time bedecks her own Productions She had besides a certain Imperfection which renders some Flowers tho' very beautiful to the Eye very improper to be placed in a Wilderness of Sweets and what above all others is most disagreeable to the Breath of Love  Though  Jones  saw all these Discouragements on the one Side he felt his Obligations full as strongly on the other nor did he less plainly discern the ardent Passion whence these Obligations proceeded the extreme Violence of which if he failed to equal he well knew the Lady would think him ungrateful and what is worse he would have thought himself so He knew the tacit Consideration upon which all her Favours were conferred and as his Necessity obliged him to accept them so his Honour he concluded forced him to pay the Price This therefore he resolved to do whatever Misery it cost him and to devote himself to her from that great Principle of Justice by which the Laws of some Countries oblige a Debtor who is no otherwise capable of discharging his Debt to become the Slave of his Creditor  While he was meditating on these Matters he received the following Note from the Lady  'A very foolish but a very perverse Accident hath happened since our last Meeting which makes it improper I should see you any more at the usual Place I will if possible contrive some other Place by Tomorrow In the mean Time Adieu'  This Disappointment perhaps the Reader may conclude was not very great but if it was he was quickly relieved for in less than an Hour afterwards another Note was brought him from the same Hand which contained as follows  'I have altered my Mind since I wrote a Change which if you are no Stranger to the tenderest of all Passions you will not wonder at I am now resolved to see you this Evening at my own House whatever may be the Consequence Come to me exactly at seven I dine abroad but will be at Home by that Time A Day I find to those that sincerely love seems longer than I imagined'  'If you should accidentally be a few Moments before me bid them shew you into the DrawingRoom'  To confess the Truth  Jones  was less pleased with this last Epistle than he had been with the former as he was prevented by it from complying with the earnest Entreaties of Mr  Nightingale  with whom he had now contracted much Intimacy and Friendship These Entreaties were to go with that young Gentleman and his Company to a new Play which was to be acted that Evening and which a very large Party had agreed to damn from some Dislike they had taken to the Author who was a Friend to one of Mr  Nightingale'  s Acquaintance And this Sort of Funn our Heroe we are ashamed to confess would willingly have preferred to the above kind Appointment but his Honour got the better of his Inclination  Before we attend him to this intended Interview with the Lady we think proper to account for both the preceding Notes as the Reader may possibly be not a little surprized at the Imprudence of Lady  Bellaston  in bringing her Lover to the very House where her Rival was lodged  First then the Mistress of the House where these Lovers had hitherto met and who had been for some Years a Pensioner to that Lady was now become a Methodist and had that very Morning waited upon her Ladyship and after rebuking her severely for her past Life had positively declared that she would  on no Account be instrumental in carrying on any of her Affairs for the future  The Hurry of Spirits into which this Accident threw the Lady made her despair of possibly finding any other Convenience to meet  Jones  that Evening but as she began a little to recover from her Uneasiness at the Disappointment she set her Thoughts to work when luckily it came into her Head to propose to  Sophia  to go to the Play which was immediately consented to and a proper Lady provided for her Companion Mrs  Honour  was likewise dispatched with Mrs  Etoff  on the same Errand of Pleasure and thus her own House was left free for the safe Reception of Mr  Jones  with whom she promised herself two or three Hours of uninterrupted Conversation after her Return from the Place where she dined which was at a Friend's House in a pretty distant Part of the Town near her old Place of Assignation where she had engaged herself before she was well apprized of the Revolution that had happened in the Mind and Morals of her late Confidante  CHAP X  A Chapter which though short may draw Tears from some Eyes  MR  Jones  was just dress'd to wait on Lady  Bellaston  when Mrs  Miller  rapp'd at his Door and being admitted very earnestly desired his Company below Stairs to drink Tea in the Parlour  Upon his Entrance into the Room she presently introduced a Person to him saying  'This Sir is my Cousin who hath been so greatly beholden to your Goodness for which he begs to return you his sincerest Thanks'  The Man had scarce entered upon that Speech which Mrs  Miller  had so kindly prefaced when both  Jones  and he looking stedfastly at each other showed  at once the utmost Tokens of Surprize The Voice of the latter began instantly to faulter and instead of finishing his Speech he sunk down into a Chair crying  'It is so I am convinced it is so'  'Bless me what's the Meaning of this cries Mrs  Miller  you are not ill I hope Cousin Some Water a Dram this Instant'  'Be not frighted Madam cries  Jones  I have almost as much Need of a Dram as your Cousin We are equally surprized at this unexpected Meeting Your Cousin is an Acquaintance of mine Mrs  Miller  '  'An Acquaintance cries the ManOh Heaven'  'Ay an Acquaintance repeated  Jones  and an honoured Acquaintance too When I do not love and honour the Man who dares venture every thing to preserve his Wife and Children from instant Destruction may I have a Friend capable of disowning me in Adversity'  'O you are an excellent young Man cries Mrs  Miller  yes indeed poor Creature he hath ventured every thingif he had not had one of the best of Constitutions it must have killed him'  'Cousin cries the Man who had now pretty well recovered himself this is the Angel from Heaven whom I meant This is he to whom before I saw you I owed the Preservation of my  Peggy  He it was to whose Generosity every Comfort every Support which I have procured for her was owing He is indeed the worthiest bravest noblest of all human Beings O Cousin I have Obligations to this Gentleman of such a Nature'  'Mention nothing of Obligations cries  Jones  eagerly not a Word I insist upon it not a Word'  Meaning I suppose that he would not have him betray the Affair of the Robbery to any Person  'If by the Trifle you have received from me I have preserved a whole Family sure Pleasure was never bought so cheap'  'O Sir cries the Man I wish you could this Instant see my House If any Person had ever a Right to the Pleasure you mention I am convinced it is yourself My Cousin tells me she acquainted you with the Distress in which she found us That Sir is all greatly removed and chiefly by your GoodnessMy Children have now a Bed to lie onand they havethey haveeternal Blessings reward you for itthey have Bread to eat My little Boy is recovered my Wife is out of Danger and I am happy All all owing to you Sir and to my Cousin here one of the best of Women Indeed Sir I must see you at my HouseIndeed my Wife must see you and thank youMy Children too must express their GratitudeIndeed Sir they are not without a Sense of their Obligation but what is my Feeling when I reflect to whom I owe that they are now capable of expressing their GratitudeOh Sir the little Hearts which you have warmed had now been cold as Ice without your Assistance'  Here  Jones  attempted to prevent the poor Man from proceeding but indeed the Overflowing of his own Heart would of itself have stopped his Words And now Mrs  Miller  likewise began to pour forth Thanksgivings as well in her own Name as in that of her Cousin and concluded with saying she doubted not but such Goodness would meet a glorious Reward  Jones  answered  'He had been sufficiently rewarded already Your Cousin's Account Madam said he hath given me a Sensation more pleasing than I have ever known He must be a Wretch who  is unmoved at hearing such a Story how transporting then must be the Thought of having happily acted a Part in this Scene If there are Men who cannot feel the Delight of giving Happiness to others I sincerely pity them as they are incapable of tasting what is in my Opinion a greater Honour a higher Interest and a sweeter Pleasure than the ambitious the avaritious or the voluptuous Man can ever obtain'  The Hour of Appointment being now come  Jones  was forced to take a hasty Leave but not before he had heartily shaken his Friend by the Hand and desired to see him again as soon as possible promising that he would himself take the first Opportunity of visiting him at his own House He then stept into his Chair and proceeded to Lady  Bellaston'  s greatly exulting in the Happiness which he had procured to this poor Family nor could he forbear reflecting without Horror on the dreadful Consequences which must have attended them had he listened rather to the Voice of strict Justice than to that of Mercy when he was attacked on the high Road  Mrs  Miller  sung forth the Praises of  Jones  during the whole Evening in which Mr  Enderson  while he stayed so passionately accompanied her that he was often on the very Point of mentioning the Circumstances of the Robbery However he luckily recalled himself and avoided an Indiscretion which would have been so much the greater as he knew Mrs  Miller  to be extremely strict and nice in her Principles He was likewise well apprised of the Loquacity of this Lady and yet such was his Gratitude that it had almost got the better both of Discretion and Shame and made him publish that which would have defamed his own Character rather than omit any Circumstances which might do the fullest Honour to his Benefactor  CHAP XI  In which the Reader will be surprized  MR  Jones  was rather earlier than the Time appointed and earlier than the Lady whose Arrival was hindered not only by the Distance of the Place where she dined but by some other cross Accidents very vexatious to one in her Situation of Mind He was accordingly shewn into the DrawingRoom where he had not been many Minutes before the Door opened and in cameno other than  Sophia  herself who had left the Play before the End of the first Act for this as we have already said being a new Play at which two large Parties met the one to damn and the other to applaud a violent Uproar and an Engagement between the two Parties had so terrified our Heroine that she was glad to put herself under the Protection of a young Gentleman who safely conveyed her to her Chair  As Lady  Bellaston  had acquainted her that she should not be at Home till late  Sophia  expecting to find no one in the Room came hastily in and went directly to a Glass which almost fronted her without once looking towards the upper End of the Room where the Statue of  Jones  now stood motionlessIn this Glass it was after contemplating her own lovely Face that she first discovered the said Statue when instantly turning about she perceived the Reality of the Vision Upon which she gave a violent Scream and scarce preserved herself from fainting till  Jones  was able to move to her and support her in his Arms  To paint the Looks or Thoughts of either of these Lovers is beyond my Power As their Sensations from their mutual Silence may be judged to have been too big for their Utterance it cannot be supposed  that I should be able to express them And the Misfortune is that few of my Readers have been enough in Love to feel by their own Hearts what past at this Time in theirs  After a short Pause  Jones  with faultering Accents said  'I see Madam you are surprized'    'Surprized answered she Oh Heavens Indeed I am surprized I almost doubt whether you are the Person you seem'  'Indeed cries he my  Sophia  pardon me Madam for this once calling you so I am that very wretched  Jones  whom Fortune after so many Disappointments hath at last kindly conducted to you Oh my  Sophia  did you know the thousand Torments I have suffered in this long fruitless Pursuit'    'Pursuit of whom'  said  Sophia  a little recollecting herself and assuming a reserved Air  'Can you be so cruel to ask that Question' cries  Jones  'Need I say of you  'Of me' answered  Sophia  'Hath Mr  Jones  then any such important Business with me'  'To some Madam cries  Jones  'this might seem an important Business giving her the PocketBook' I hope Madam you will find it of the same Value as when it was lost'  Sophia  took the PocketBook and was going to speak when he interrupted her thus  'Let us not I beseech you lose one of these precious Moments which Fortune hath so kindly sent usO my  Sophia  I have Business of a much superior KindThus on my Knees let me ask your Pardon'    'My Pardon' cries she'Sure Sir after what is past you cannot expect after what I have heard'    'I scarce know what I say answered  Jones  'By Heavens I scarce wish you should pardon me O my  Sophia  henceforth never cast away a Thought on such a Wretch as I am If any Remembrance of me should ever intrude to give a Moment's Uneasiness  to that tender Bosom think of my Unworthiness and let the Remembrance of what past at  Upton  blot me for ever from your Mind'    Sophia  stood trembling all this while Her Face was whiter than Snow and her Heart was throbbing through her Stays But at the mention of  Upton  a Blush arose in her Cheeks and her Eyes which before she had scarce lifted up were turned upon  Jones  with a Glance of Disdain He understood this silent Reproach and replied to it thus  'O my  Sophia  my only Love you cannot hate or despise me more for what happened there than I do myself But yet do me the Justice to think that my  Heart  was never unfaithful to you  That  had no Share in the Folly I was guilty of it was even then unalterably yours Though I despaired of possessing you nay almost of ever seeing you more I doated still on your charming Idea and could  seriously  love no other Woman But if my Heart had not been engaged she into whose Company I accidentally fell at that cursed Place was not an Object of serious Love Believe me my Angel I never have seen her from that Day to this and never intend or desired to see her again'  Sophia  in her Heart was very glad to hear this but forcing into her Face an Air of more Coldness than she yet had assumed Why said she Mr  Jones  do you take the  'Trouble to make a Defence where you are not accused If I thought it worth while to accuse you I have a Charge of an unpardonable Nature indeed'  'What is it for Heaven's Sake'  answered  Jones  trembling and pale expecting to hear of his Amour with Lady  Bellaston  'Oh said she how is it possible Can every Thing noble and every Thing base be lodged together in the same Bosom'  Lady  Bellaston  and the ignominious Circumstance of having been  kept  rose again in his Mind and stopt  his Mouth from any Reply  'Could I have expected proceeded  Sophia  such Treatment from you Nay from any Gentleman from any Man of Honour To have my Name traduced in Public in Inns among the meanest Vulgar To have any little Favours that my unguarded Heart may have too lightly betray'd me to grant boasted of there Nay even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my Love'  Nothing could equal  Jones'  s Surprize at these Words of  Sophia  but yet not being guilty he was much less embarrassed how to defend himself than if she had touched that tender String at which his Conscience had been alarmed By some Examination he presently found that her supposing him guilty of so shocking an Outrage against his Love and her Reputation was entirely owing to  Partridge'  s Talk at the Inns before Landlords and Servants for  Sophia  confessed to him it was from them that she received her Intelligence He had no very great Difficulty to make her believe that he was entirely innocent of an Offence so foreign to his Character but she had a great deal to hinder him from going instantly home and putting  Partridge  to Death which he more than once swore he would do This Point being cleared up they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other that  Jones  quite forgot he had begun the Conversation with conjuring her to give up all Thoughts of him and she was in a Temper to have given Ear to a Petition of a very different Nature For before they were aware they had both gone so far that he let fall some Words that sounded like a Proposal of Marriage To which she replied  'That did not her Duty to her Father forbid her to follow her own Inclinations Ruin with him would be more welcome to her than the most affluent Fortune with another Man'  At the mention of the Word Ruin he started let drop her Hand  which he had held for some Time and striking his Breast with his own cried out  'Oh  Sophia  can I then ruin thee No by Heavens no I never will act so base a Part Dearest  Sophia  whatever it costs me I will renounce you I will give you up I will tear all such Hopes from my Heart as are inconsistent with your real Good My Love I will ever retain but it shall be in Silence it shall be at a Distance from you it shall be in some foreign Land from whence no Voice no Sigh of my Despair shall ever reach and disturb your Ears And when I am dead'  He would have gone on but was stopt by a Flood of Tears which  Sophia  let fall in his Bosom upon which she leaned without being able to speak one Word He kissed them off which for some Moments she allowed him to do without any Resistance but then recollecting herself gently withdrew out of his Arms and to turn the Discourse from a Subject too tender and which she found she could not support bethought herself to ask him a Question she had never had Time to put to him before  'How he came into that Room'  He begun to stammer and would in all Probability have raised her Suspicions by the Answer he was going to give when at once the Door opened and in came Lady  Bellaston  Having advanced a few Steps and seeing  Jones  and  Sophia  together she suddenly stopt when after a Pause of a few Moments recollecting herself with admirable Presence of Mind she saidtho' with sufficient Indications of Surprize both in Voice and Countenance  'I thought Miss  Western  you had been at the Play'  Though  Sophia  had had no Opportunity of learning of  Jones  by what Means he had discovered her yet as she had not the least Suspicion of the real Truth or that  Jones  and Lady  Bellaston  were acquainted  so she was very little confounded And the less as the Lady had in all their Conversations on the Subject entirely taken her Side against her Father With very little Hesitation therefore she went through the whole Story of what had happened at the Playhouse and the Cause of her hasty Return  The Length of this Narrative gave Lady  Bellaston  an Opportunity of rallying her Spirits and of considering in what Manner to act And as the Behaviour of  Sophia  gave her Hopes that  Jones  had not betray'd her she put on an Air of GoodHumour and said  'I should not have broke in so abruptly upon you Miss  Western  if I had known you had Company'  Lady  Bellaston  fixed her Eyes on  Sophia  whilst she spoke these Words To which that poor young Lady having her Face overspread with Blushes and Confusion answered in a stammering Voice  'I am sure Madam I shall always think the Honour of your Ladyship's Company    'I hope at least' cries Lady  Bellaston  'I interrupt no Business'    'No Madam answered  Sophia  our Business was at an End Your Ladyship may be pleased to remember I have often mentioned the Loss of my PocketBook which this Gentleman having very luckily found was so kind to return to me with the Bill in it'  Jones  ever since the Arrival of Lady  Bellaston  had been ready to sink with Fear He sat kicking his Heels playing with his Fingers and looking more like a Fool if it be possible than a young boody Squire when he is first introduced into a polite Assembly He began however now to recover himself and taking a Hint from the Behaviour of Lady  Bellaston  who he saw did not intend to claim any Acquaintance with him he resolved as entirely to affect the Stranger on his Part He said  'Ever since  he had had the PocketBook in his Possession he had used great Diligence in enquiring out the Lady whose Name was writ in it but never till that Day could be so fortunate to discover her'  Sophia  had indeed mentioned the Loss of her PocketBook to Lady  Bellaston  but as  Jones  for some Reason or other had never once hinted to her that it was in his Possession she believed not one Syllable of what  Sophia  now said and wonderfully admired the extreme Quickness of the young Lady in inventing such an Excuse The Reason of  Sophia'  s leaving the Playhouse met with no better Credit and though she could not account for the Meeting between these two Lovers she was firmly perswaded it was not accidental  With an affected Smile therefore she said  'Indeed Miss  Western  you have had very good Luck in recovering your Money Not only as it fell into the Hands of a Gentleman of Honour but as he happened to discover to whom it belonged I think you would not consent to have it advertisedIt was great good Fortune Sir that you found out to whom the Note belonged'  'O Madam cries  Jones  it was inclosed in a PocketBook in which the young Lady's Name was written'  'That was very fortunate indeed cries the LadyAnd it was no less so that you heard Miss  Western  was at my House for she is very little known'  Jones  had at length perfectly recovered his Spirits and as he conceived he had now an Opportunity of satisfying  Sophia  as to the Question she had asked him just before Lady  Bellaston  came in he proceeded thus Why Madam answered he  'it was by the luckiest Chance imaginable I made this Discovery I was mentioning what I had found and  the Name of the Owner the other Night to a Lady at the Masquerade who told me she believed she knew where I might see Miss  Western  and if I would come to her House the next Morning she would inform me I went according to her Appointment but she was not at Home nor could I ever meet with her till this Morning when she directed me to your Ladyship's House I came accordingly and did myself the Honour to ask for your Ladyship and upon my saying that I had very particular Business a Servant shewed me into this Room where I had not been long before the young Lady returned from the Play'  Upon his mentioning the Masquerade he look'd very slyly at Lady  Bellaston  without any Fear of being remarked by  Sophia  for she was visibly too much confounded to make any Observations This Hint a little alarmed the Lady and she was silent when  Jones  who saw the Agitations of  Sophia'  s Mind resolved to take the only Method of relieving her which was by retiring But before he did this he said  'I believe Madam it is customary to give some Reward on these OccasionsI must insist on a very high one for my HonestyIt is Madam no less than the Honour of being permitted to pay another Visit here'  'Sir replied the Lady I make no Doubt that you are a Gentleman and my Doors are never shut to People of Fashion'  Jones  then after proper Ceremonials departed highly to his own Satisfaction and no less to that of  Sophia  who was terribly alarmed lest Lady  Bellaston  should discover what she knew already but too well  Upon the Stairs  Jones  met his old Acquaintance Mrs  Honour  who notwithstanding all she had said against him was now so wellbred to behave with great Civility This Meeting proved indeed a lucky  Circumstance as he communicated to her the House where he lodged with which  Sophia  was unacquainted  CHAP XII  In which the Thirteenth Book is concluded  THE elegant Lord  Shaftsbury  somewhere objects to telling too much Truth By which it may be fairly inferred that in some Cases to lie is not only excusable but commendable  And surely there are no Persons who may so properly challenge a Right to this commendable Deviation from Truth as young Women in the Affair of Love for which they may plead Precept Education and above all the Sanction nay I may say the Necessity of Custom by which they are restrained not from submitting to the honest Impulses of Nature for that would be a foolish Prohibition but from owning them  We are not therefore ashamed to say that our Heroine now pursued the Dictates of the abovementioned Right Honourable Philosopher As she was perfectly satisfied then that Lady  Bellaston  was ignorant of the Person of  Jones  so she determined to keep her in that Ignorance though at the Expence of a little Fibbing  Jones  had not been long gone before Lady  Bellaston  cry'd  'Upon my Word a good pretty young Fellow I wonder who he is For I don't remember ever to have seen his Face before'  'Nor I neither Madam cries  Sophia  I must say he behaved very handsomely in relation to my Note'  'Yes and he is a very handsome Fellow said the Lady don't you think so'  I did not take much Notice of him answered  Sophia  'but I thought he seemed rather awkward and ungenteel than otherwise'  'You are extremely right cries Lady  Bellaston  You may see by his Manner that he hath not kept good Company Nay notwithstanding his returning your Note and refusing the Reward I almost question whether he is a GentlemanI have always observed there is a Something in Persons wellborn which others can never acquireI think I will give Orders not to be at Home to him'  'Nay sure Madam answered  Sophia  one can't suspect after what he hath doneBesides if your Ladyship observed him there was an Elegance in his Discourse a Delicacy a Prettiness of Expression that that'  'I confess said Lady  Bellaston  the Fellow hath WordsAnd indeed  Sophia  you must forgive me indeed you must'  'I forgive your Ladyship said  Sophia  '  'Yes indeed you must answered she 'laughing for I had a horrible Suspicion when I first came into the RoomI vow you must forgive it but I suspected it was Mr  Jones  himself'  'Did your Ladyship indeed cries  Sophia  blushing and affecting a Laugh'  'Yes I vow I did answered she I can't imagine what put it into my Head For give the Fellow his due he was genteelly drest which I think dear  Sophy  is not commonly the Case with your Friend'  'This Raillery cries  Sophia  is a little cruel Lady  Bellaston  after my Promise to your Ladyship'  'Not at all Child' said the LadyIt would have been cruel before but after you have promised me never to marry without your Father's  Consent in which you know is implied your giving up  Jones  sure you can bear a little Raillery on a Passion which was pardonable enough in a young Girl in the Country and of which you tell me you have so entirely got the better What must I think my dear  Sophy  if you cannot bear a little Ridicule even on his Dress I shall begin to fear you are very far gone indeed and almost question whether you have dealt ingenuously with me'  'Indeed Madam cries  Sophia  your Ladyship mistakes me if you imagine I had any Concern on his Account'  'On his Account' answered the Lady  'You must have mistaken me I went no farther than his Dressfor I would not injure your Taste by any other ComparisonI don't imagine my dear  Sophy  if your Mr  Jones  had been such a Fellow as this'  'I thought' says  Sophia  'your Ladyship had allowed him to be handsome'  'Whom pray' cried the Lady hastily  'Mr  Jones'  answered  Sophia  and immediately recollecting herself  'Mr  Jones  no no I ask your PardonI mean the Gentleman who was just now here'  'O  Sophy Sophy'  cries the Lady  'this Mr  Jones  I am afraid still runs in your Head'  'Then upon my Honour Madam' said  Sophia  'Mr  Jones  is as entirely indifferent to me as the Gentleman who just now left us'  'Upon my Honour' said Lady  Bellaston  'I believe it Forgive me therefore a little innocent Raillery but I promise you I will never mention his Name any more'  And now the two Ladies separated infinitely more to the Delight of  Sophia  than of Lady  Bellaston  who would willingly have tormented her Rival a little longer had not Business of more Importance called her  away As for  Sophia  her Mind was not perfectly easy under this first Practice of Deceit upon which when she retired to her Chamber she reflected with the highest Uneasiness and conscious Shame Nor could the peculiar Hardship of her Situation and the Necessity of the Case at all reconcile her Conduct to her Mind the Frame of which was too delicate to bear the Thought of having been guilty of a Falshood however qualified by Circumstances Nor did this Thought once suffer her to close her Eyes during the whole succeeding Night  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK XIV  Containing Two Days  CHAP I  An Essay to prove that an Author will write the better for having some Knowledge of the Subject on which he writes  AS several Gentlemen in these Times by the wonderful Force of Genius only without the least Assistance of Learning perhaps without being well able to read have made a considerable Figure in the Republic of Letters the modern Critics I am told have lately begun to assert that all kind of Learning is entirely useless to a Writer and indeed no other than a kind of Fetters on the natural Spriteliness and Activity on the Imaginations which is thus weighed down and prevented  from soaring to those high Flights which otherwise it would be able to reach  This Doctrine I am afraid is at present carried much too far For why should Writing differ so much from all other Arts The Nimbleness of a DancingMaster is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move nor doth any Mechanic I believe exercise his Tools the worse by knowing how to use them For my own Part I cannot conceive that  Homer  or  Virgil  would have writ with more Fire if instead of being Masters of all the Learning of their Times they had really been as ignorant as most of the Authors of the present Age Nor do I believe that all the Imagination Fire and Judgment of  Pitt  could have produced those Orations that have made the Senate of  England  in these our Times a Rival in Eloquence to  Greece  and  Rome  if he had not been so well read in the Writings of  Demosthenes  and  Cicero  as to have transfused their whole Spirit into his Speeches and with their Spirit their Knowledge too  I would not here be understood to insist on the same Fund of Learning in any of my Brethren as  Cicero  perswades us is necessary to the Composition of an Orator On the contrary very little Reading is I conceive necessary to the Poet less to the Critic and the least of all to the Politician For the first perhaps  Bysse'  s Art of Poetry and a few of our modern Poets may suffice for the second a moderate Heap of Plays and for the last an indifferent Collection of political Journals  To say the Truth I require no more than that a Man should have some little Knowledge of the Subject on which he treats according to the old Maxim of Law  Quam quisque norit artem in eâ se exerceat  With this alone a Writer may sometimes do tolerably well and indeed without this all the other Learning in the World will stand him in little stead  For Instance let us suppose that  Homer  and  Virgil Aristotle  and  Cicero Thucydides  and  Livy  could have met all together and have clubbed their several Talents to have composed a Treatise on the Art of Dancing I believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent Treatise which Mr  Essex  hath given us on that Subject entitled  The Rudiments of genteel Education  And indeed should the excellent Mr  Broughton  be prevailed on to set  Fist  to Paper and to complete the abovesaid Rudiments by delivering down the true Principles of Athletics I question whether the World will have any Cause to lament that none of the great Writers either ancient or modern have ever treated about that noble and useful Art  To avoid a Multiplicity of Examples in so plain a Case and to come at once to my Point I am apt to conceive that one Reason why many  English  Writers have totally failed in describing the Manners of upper Life may possibly be that in Reality they know nothing of it  This is a Knowledge unhappily not in the Power of many Authors to arrive at Books will give us a very imperfect Idea of it nor will the Stage a much better The fine Gentleman formed upon reading the former will almost always turn out a Pedant and he who forms himself upon the latter a Coxcomb  Nor are the Characters drawn from these Models better supported  Vanbrugh  and  Congreve  copied Nature but they who copy them draw as unlike the present Age as  Hogarth  would do if he was to paint a Rout or a Drum in the Dresses of  Titian  and of  Vandyke  In short Imitation here will not do the Business The Picture must be after Nature herself A true Knowledge of the World is gained only by Conversation and the Manners of every Rank must be seen in order to be known  Now it happens that this higher Order of Mortals is not to be seen like all the rest of the Human Species for nothing in the Streets Shops and Coffeehouses Nor are they shewn like the upper Rank of Animals for so much apiece In short this is a Sight to which no Persons are admitted without one or other of these Qualifications  viz  either Birth or Fortune or what is equivalent to both the honourable Profession of a Gamester And very unluckily for the World Persons so qualified very seldom care to take upon themselves the bad Trade of Writing which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer Sort as it is a Trade which many think requires no Kind of Stock to set up with  Hence those strange Monsters in Lace and Embroidery in Silks and Brocades with vast Wigs and Hoops which under the Name of Lords and Ladies strut the Stage to the great Delight of Attornies and their Clerks in the Pit and of Citizens and their Apprentices in the Galleries and which are no more to be found in real Life than the Centaur the Chimera or any other Creature of mere Fiction But to let my Reader into a Secret this Knowledge of upper Life though very necessary for the preventing Mistakes is no very great Resource to a Writer whose Province is Comedy or that Kind of Novels which like this I am writing is of the comic Class  What Mr  Pope  says of Women is very applicable to most in this Station who are indeed so entirely made up of Form and Affection that they have no Character at all at least none which appears I will venture to say the highest Life is much the dullest and affords very little Humour or Entertainment The various Callings in lower Spheres produce the great Variety of humorous Characters whereas here except among the few who are engaged in the Pursuit of Ambition and the fewer still who have a Relish for  Pleasure all is Vanity and servile Imitation Dressing and Cards eating and drinking bowing and curtesying make up the Business of their Lives  Some there are however of this Rank upon whom Passion exercises its Tyranny and hurries them far beyond the Bounds which Decorum prescribes of these the Ladies are as much distinguished by their noble Intrepidity and a certain superior Contempt of Reputation from the frail ones of meaner Degree as a virtuous Woman of Quality is by the Elegance and Delicacy of her Sentiments from the honest Wife of a Yeoman or Shopkeeper Lady  Bellaston  was of this intrepid Character but let not my Country Readers conclude from her that this is the general Conduct of Women of Fashion or that we mean to represent them as such They might as well suppose that every Clergyman was represented by  Thwackum  or every Soldier by Ensign  Northerton  There is not indeed a greater Error than that which universally prevails among the Vulgar who borrowing their Opinion from some ignorant Satyrists have affixed the Character of Lewdness to these Times On the contrary I am convinced there never was less of Love Intrigue carried on among Persons of Condition than now Our present Women have been taught by their Mothers to fix their Thoughts only on Ambition and Vanity and to despise the Pleasures of Love as unworthy their Regard and being afterwards by the Care of such Mothers married without having Husbands they seem pretty well confirmed in the Justness of those Sentiments whence they content themselves for the dull Remainder of Life with the Pursuit of more innocent but I am afraid more childish Amusements the bare Mention of which would ill suit with the Dignity of this History In my humble Opinion the true Characteristick of the present  Beau  Monde  is rather Folly than Vice and the only Epithet which it deserves is that of  Frivolous  CHAP II  Containing Letters and other Matters which attend Amours  JONES  had not long been at Home before he received the following Letter  I was never more surprized than when I found you was gone When you left the Room I little imagined you intended to have left the House without seeing me again Your Behaviour is all of a Piece and convinces me how much I ought to despise a Heart which can doat upon an Idiot though I know not whether I should not admire her Cunning more than her Simplicity Wonderful both For though she understood not a Word of what passed between us she yet had the Skill the Assurance thewhat shall I call it to deny to my Face that she knows you or ever saw you beforeWas this a Scheme laid between you and have you been base enough to betray meO how I despise her you and all the World but chiefly myself forI dare not write what I should afterwards run mad to read but remember I can detest as violently as I have loved  Jones  had but little Time given him to reflect on his Letter before a second was brought him from  e same Hand and this likewise we shall set down  n the precise Words  When you consider the Hurry of Spirits in which I must have writ you cannot be surprised at any Expressions in my former NoteYet perhaps on Reflection they were rather too warm At least I would if possible think all owing to  the odious Playhouse and to the Impertinence of Fool which detained me beyond my Appointmen  How easy is it to think well of those w  lovePerhaps you desire I should think so I have resolved to see you to Night so come to m  immediately  P S  I have ordered to be at Home to none b  'yourself  P S  Mr  Jones  will imagine I shall assist hi  in his Defence for I believe he cannot desir  to impose on me more than I desire to impo  on myself  P S  Come immediately  To the Men of Intrigue I refer the Determination whether the angry or the tender Letter gave th  greatest Uneasiness to  Jones  Certain it is he ha  no violent Inclination to pay more Visits that Even+ing unless to one single Person However he though  his Honour engaged and had not this been Moti  sufficient he would not have ventured to blow th  Temper of Lady  Bellaston  into that Flame of which he had Reason to think it susceptible and of which he feared the Consequence might be a Discovery  Sophia  which he dreaded After some disconten  Walks therefore about the Room he was prepari  to depart when the Lady kindly prevented him n  by another Letter but by her own Presence S  entered the Room very disordered in her Dress a  very discomposed in her Looks and threw herself i  to a Chair where having recovered her Breath s  said  'You see Sir when Women have go  one Length too far they will stop at none If a  Person would have sworn this to me a Week ag  I would not have believed it of myself'  'I hop  Madam said  Jones  my charming Lady  Bellaston  will be as difficult to believe any thing against o  who is so sensible of the many Obligations she ha  conferred upon him'    'Indeed says she sensible of Obligations Did I expect to hear such cold Language from Mr  Jones  '  'Pardon me my dear Angel said he if after the Letters I have received the Terrors of your Anger though I know not how I have deserved it'    'And have I then says she with a Smile so angry a CountenanceHave I really brought a chiding Face with me'    'If there be Honour in Man said he I have done nothing to merit your Anger'You remember the Appointment you sent meI went in Pursuance'    'I beseech you cry'd she do not run through the odious RecitalAnswer me but one Question and I shall be easyHave you not betrayed my Honour to her'  Jones  fell upon his Knees and began to utter the most violent Protestations when  Partridge  came dancing and capering into the Room like one drunk with Joy crying out  'she's found she's foundHere Sir here she's hereMrs  Honour  is upon the Stairs'  'Stop her a Moment cries  Jones  Here Madam step behind the Bed I have no other Room nor Closet nor Place on Earth to hide you in sure never was so damn'd an Accident'    'Dn'd indeed'  said the Lady as she went to her Place of Concealment and presently afterwards in came Mrs  Honour  'Hey day says she Mr  Jones  what's the MatterThat impudent Rascal your Servant would scarce let me come up Stairs I hope he hath not the same Reason now to keep me from you as he had at  Upton  I suppose you hardly expected to see me but you have certainly bewitched my Lady Poor dear young Lady To be sure I loves her as tenderly as if she was my own Sister Lord have Mercy upon you if you don't make her a good Husband and to be sure if you do not nothing can be bad enough for you'  Jones  'begged her only to whisper for that there was a Lady dying in the next Room'  'A Lady cries she ay I suppose one of your LadiesO Mr  Jones  there are too many of them in the World I believe we are got into the House of one for my Lady  Bellaston  I darst to say is no better than she should be'    'Hush hush cries  Jones  every Word is overheard in the next Room'  'I don't care a Farthing cries  Honour  I speaks no Scandal of any one but to be sure the Servants makes no Scruple of saying as how her Ladyship meets Men at another Placewhere the House goes under the Name of a poor Gentlewoman but her Ladyship pays the Rent and many's the good Thing besides they say she hath of her'  Here  Jones  after expressing the utmost Uneasiness offered to stop her Mouth  'Hey day why sure Mr  Jones  you will let me speak I speaks no Scandal for I only says what I heard from othersand thinks I to myself much good may it do the Gentlewoman with her Riches if she comes by it in such a wicked Manner To be sure it is better to be poor and honest'  'The Servants are Villains cries  Jones  and abuse their Lady unjustly'    'Ay to be sure Servants are always Villains and so my Lady says and won't hear a Word of it'    'No I am convinced says  Jones  my  Sophia  is above listening to such base Scandal'  'Nay I believe it is no Scandal neither cries  Honour  for why should she meet Men at another HouseIt can never be for any Good for if she had a lawful Design of being courted as to be sure any Lady may lawfully give her Company to Men upon that Account why where can be the Sense'    'I protest cries  Jones  I can't hear all 'this of a Lady of such Honour and a Relation of  Sophia  besides you will distract the poor Lady in the next RoomLet me intreat you to walk  with me down StairsNay Sir you won't let me speak I have doneHere Sir is a Letter from my young Ladywhat would some Men give to have this But Mr  Jones  I think you are not over and above generous and yet I have heard some Servants say but I am sure you will do me the Justice to own I never saw the Colour of your Money'  Here  Jones  hastily took the Letter and presently after slip'd five Pieces into her Hand He then returned a thousand Thanks to his dear  Sophia  in a Whisper and begged her to leave him to read her Letter she presently departed not without expressing much grateful Sense of his Generosity  Lady  Bellaston  now came from behind the Curtain How shall I describe her Rage Her Tongue was at first incapable of Utterance but streams of Fire darted from her Eyes and well indeed they might for her Heart was all in a Flame And now as soon as her Voice found Way instead of expressing any Indignation against  Honour  or her own Servants she began to attack poor  Jones  'You see said she what I have sacrificed to you my Reputation my Honourgone for ever And what Return have I found Neglected slighted for a Country Girl for an Idiot'    'What Neglect Madam or what Slight cries  Jones  have I been guilty ofMr  Jones  said she it is in vain to dissemble if you will make me easy you must entirely give her up and as a Proof of your Intention shew me the Letter'    'What Letter Madam said  Jones  Nay surely said she you cannot have the Confidence to deny your having received a Letter by the Hands of that Trollop' And can your Ladyship cries he ask of me what I must part with my Honour before I grant Have I acted in such a Manner by your Ladyship Could I be guilty of betraying this poor innocent Girl to you what Security could you have  that I should not act the same Part by yourself A Moment's Reflection will I am sure convince you that a Man with whom the Secrets of a Lady are not safe must be the most contemptible of Wretches Very well said sheI need not insist on your becoming this contemptible Wretch in your own Opinion for the Inside of the Letter could inform me of nothing more than I know already I see the Footing you are upon'  Here ensued a long Conversation which the Reader who is not too curious will thank me for not inserting at length It shall suffice therefore to inform him that Lady  Bellaston  grew more and more pacified and at length believed or affected to believe his Protestations that his meeting with  Sophia  that Evening was merely accidental and every other Matter which the Reader already knows and which as  Jones  set before her in the strongest Light it is plain that she had in Reality no Reason to be angry with him  She was not however in her Heart perfectly satisfied with his Refusal to shew her the Letter so dea  are we to the clearest Reason when it argues against our prevailing Passions She was indeed well convinced that  Sophia  possessed the first Place in  Jones  Affections and yet haughty and amorous as this Lady was she submitted at last to bear the second Place or to express it more properly in a legal Phrase wa  contented with the Possession of that of which another Woman had the Reversion  It was at length agreed that  Jones  should for th  future visit at the House for that  Sophia  her Mai  and all the Servants would place these Visits to th  Account of  Sophia  and that she herself would  considered as the Person imposed upon  This Scheme was contrived by the Lady and high+ly relished by  Jones  who was indeed glad to have Prospect of seeing his  Sophia  at any Rate and th  Lady herself was not a little pleased with the Imposition on  Sophia  which  Jones  she thought could not possibly discover to her for his own Sake  The next Day was appointed for the first Visit and then after proper Ceremonials the Lady  Bellaston  returned Home  CHAP III  Containing various Matters  JONES  was no sooner alone than he eagerly broke open his Letter and read as follows  Sir it is impossible to express what I have suffered since you left this House and as I have Reason to think you intend coming here again I have sent  Honour  though so late at Night as she tells me she knows your Lodgings to prevent you I charge you by all the Regard you have for me not to think of visiting here for it will certainly be discovered nay I almost doubt from some Things which have dropt from her Ladyship that she is not already without some Suspicion Something favourable perhaps may happen we must wait with Patience but I once more entreat you if you have any Concern for my Ease do not think of returning hither  This Letter administred the same Kind of Consolation to poor  Jones  which  Job  formerly received from his Friends Besides disappointing all the Hopes which he promised to himself from seeing  Sophia  he was reduced to an unhappy Dilemma with Regard to Lady  Bellaston  for there are some certain Engagements which as he well knew do very difficultly admit of any Excuse for the Failure and to go after the strict Prohibition from  Sophia  he was not to be forced by any human Power At length after much Deliberation which during that Night supply'd  the Place of Sleep he determined to feign himself sick For this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed Visit without incensing Lady  Bellaston  which he had more than one Reason of desiring to avoid  The first Thing however which he did in the Morning was to write an Answer to  Sophia  which he enclosed in one to  Honour  He then dispatched another to Lady  Bellaston  containing the abovementioned Excuse and to this he soon received the following Answer  I am vexed that I cannot see you here this Afternoon but more concerned for the Occasion take great Care of yourself and have the best Advice and I hope there will be no DangerI am so tormented all this Morning with Fools that I have scace a Moment's Time to write to you Adieu  P S  I will endeavour to call on you this Evening at nineBe sure to be alone  Mr  Jones  now received a Visit from Mrs  Miller  who after some formal Introduction began the following Speech  'I am very sorry Sir to wait upon you on such an Occasion but I hope you will consider the ill Consequence which it must be to the Reputations of my poor Girls if my House should once be talked of as a House of ill Fame I hope you won't think me therefore guilty of Impertinence if I beg you not to bring any more Ladies in at th  Time of Night The Clock had struck two before one of them went away'  'I do assure you Madam said  Jones  the Lady who was here last Night and who staid the latest for the other only brought me a Letter is a Woman of very great Fashion and my near Relation I don't know what Fashion she is of answered Mrs  Miller  but I am sure  Woman of Virtue unless a very near Relation in+deed would visit a young Gentleman at ten  Night and stay four Hours in his Room with him alone besides Sir the Behaviour of her Chairmen shews what she was for they did nothing but make Jests all the Evening in the Entry and asked Mr  Partridge  in the hearing of my own Maid if Madam intended to stay with his Master all Night with a great deal of Stuff not proper to be repeated I have really a great Respect for you Mr  Jones  upon your own Account nay I have a very high Obligation to you for your Generosity to my Cousin Indeed I did not know how very good you had been till lately Little did I imagine to what dreadful Courses the poor Man's Distress had driven him Little did I think when you gave me the ten Guineas that you had given them to a Highwayman O Heavens What Goodness have you shewn How have you preserved this FamilyThe Character which Mr  Allworthy  hath formerly given me of you was I find strictly trueAnd indeed if I had no Obligation to you my Obligations to him are such that on his Account I should shew you the utmost Respect in my PowerNay believe me dear Mr  Jones  if my Daughters and my own Reputation were out of the Case I should for your own Sake be sorry that so pretty a young Gentleman should converse with these Women but if you are resolved to do it I must beg you to take another Lodging for I do not myself like to have such Things carried on under my Roof but more especially upon the Account of my Girls who have little Heaven knows besides their Characters to recommend them'  Jones  started and changed Colour at the Name of  Allworthy  'Indeed Mrs  Miller  answered he a little warmly I do not take this at all kind I will never bring any Slander on your House but I must insist on seeing what Company I please in my own Room and if that gives  you any Offence I shall as soon as I am able look for another Lodging'  'I am sorry we must part then Sir said she but I am convinced Mr  Allworthy  himself would never come within my Doors if he had the least Suspicion of my keeping an ill House'    'Very well Madam' said  Jones  'I hope Sir said she 'you are not angry for I would not for the World offend any of Mr  Allworthy'  s Family I have not slept a wink all Night about this Matter'    'I am sorry I have disturbed your Rest Madam' said  Jones  but I beg you will send  Partridge  up to me immediately'  which she promised to do and then with a very low Courtesy retired  As soon as  Partridge  arrived  Jones  fell upon him in the most outrageous manner  'How often' said he 'am I to suffer for your Folly or rather for my own in keeping you Is that Tongue of yours resolved upon my Destruction'    'What have I done Sir'  answered affrighted  Partridge  'Who was it gave you Authority to mention the Story of the Robbery or that the Man you saw here was the Person''I Sir' cries  Partridge  'Now don't be guilty of a Falshood in denying it said  Jones  '    'If I did mention such a Matter answers  Partridge  'I am sure I thought no Harm For I should not have opened my Lips if it had not been to his own Friends and Relations who I imagined would have let it go no farther'  'But I have a much heavier Charge against you' cries  Jones  than this How durst you after all the Precautions I give you mention the Name of Mr  Allworthy  in this House'  Partridge  denied that he ever had with many Oaths  'How else' said  Jones  should Mrs  Miller  be acquainted that there was any Connection between him and me And it is but this Moment she told me she respected me on his Account'    'O Lord Sir' said  Partridge  I desire only to be heard out and to be sure never was any thing so unfortunate hear me but out and you will own how wrongfully you have accused me When Mrs  Honour  came down Stairs last Night she met me in the Entry and asked me when my Master had heard from Mr  Allworthy  and to be sure Mrs  Miller  heard the very Words and the Moment Madam  Honour  was gone she called me into the Parlour to her'  'Mr  Partridge'  says she What Mr  Allworthy  is that the Gentlewoman mentioned Is it the great Mr  Allworthy  of  Somersetshire'  'Upon my Word Madam' says I I know nothing of the Matter'    'Sure' says she 'your Master is not the Mr  Jones  I have heard Mr  Allworthy  talk of'  'Upon my Word Madam' says I I know nothing of the Matter'    'Then' says she turning to her Daughter  Nancy'  says she as sure as ten Pence this is the very young Gentleman and he agrees exactly with the Squire's Description 'The Lord above knows who it was told her for I am the arrantest Villain that ever walked upon two Legs if ever it came out of my Mouth    'I promise you Sir I can keep a Secret when I am desired'    'Nay Sir so far was I from telling her any thing about Mr  Allworthy  that I told her the very direct contrary For though I did not contradict it at that Moment yet as second Thoughts they say are best so when I came to consider that some body must have informed her thinks I to myself I will put an End to the Story and so I went back again into the Parlour some time afterwards and says I Upon my word says I whoever says I told you that this Gentleman was Mr  Jones  that is says I that this Mr  Jones  was that Mr  Jones  told you a confounded Lie and I beg says I you will never mention any such Matter says I for  my Master says I will think I must have told you so and I defy any body in the House ever to say I mentioned any such Word To be certain Sir it is a wonderful Thing and I have been thinking with myself ever since how it was she came to know it not but I saw an old Woman here t'other Day a begging at the Door who looked as like her we saw in  Warwickshire  that caused all that Mischief to us To be sure it is never good to pass by an old Woman without giving her something especially if she looks at you for all the World shall never persuade me but that they have a great Power to do Mischief and to be sure I shall never see at old Woman again but I shall think to myself  Infandum Regina jubes renovare Dolorem  '  The Simplicity of  Partridge  set  Jones  a laughing and put a final end to his Anger which had indeed seldom any long Duration in his Mind and instead o  commenting on his Defence he told him he intende  presently to leave those Lodgings and ordered him t  go and endeavour to get him others  CHAP IV  Which we hope will be very attentively perused i  young People of both Sexes  PARTRIDGE  had no sooner left Mr  Jones  tha  Mr  Nightingale  with whom he had now contracted a great Intimacy came to him and after short Salutation said  'So  Tom  I hear you had Company very late last Night Upon my Soul you are a happy Fellow who have not been in Town above a Fortnight and can keep Chairs waiting at you  Door till two in the Morning'  He then ran on wit  much commonplace Raillery of the same Kind  Jones  at last interrupted him saying  'I suppos  you have received all this Information from M  Miller  who hath been up here a little while ago to give me Warning The good Woman is afraid it seems of the Reputation of her Daughters'  'O she is wonderfully nice' says  Nightingale  'upon that Account if you remember she would not let  Nancy  go with us to the Masquerade'  'Nay upon my Honour I think she's in the Right of it' says  Jones  however I have taken her at her Word and have sent  Partridge  to look for another Lodging'  'If you will' says  Nightingale  we may I believe be again together for to tell you a Secret which I desire you won't mention in the Family I intend to quit the House today'    'What hath Mrs  Miller  given you Warning too my Friend'  cries  Jones  'No' answered the other but the Rooms are not convenient enoughBesides I am grown weary of this part of the Town I want to be nearer the Places of Diversion so I am going to  Pallmall    'And do you intend to make a Secret of your going away'  said  Jones  'I promise you' answered  Nightingale  'I don't intend to bilk my Lodgings but I have a private Reason for not taking a formal Leave'  'Not so private' answered  Jones  'I promise you I have seen it ever since the second Day of my coming to the HouseHere will be some wet Eyes on your DeparturePoor  Nancy  I pity her faith    'Indeed  Jack  you have play'd the Fool with that GirlYou have given her a Longing which I am afraid nothing will ever cure her of'  Nightingale  answered  'What the Devil would you have me do Would you have me marry her to cure her'    'No' answered  Jones  'I would not have had you make Love to her as you have often done in my Presence I have been astonished at the Blindness of her Mother in never seeing i  '  'Pugh see it' cries  Nightingale  'What the Devil should she  see'  'Why see' said  Jones  'that you have made her Daughter distractedly in Love with you The poor Girl cannot conceal it a Moment her Eyes are never off from you and she always colours every time you come into the Room Indeed I pity her heartily for she seems to be one of the best natured and honestest of human Creatures'  'And so answered  Nightingale  according to your Doctrine one must not amuse one's self by any common Gallantries with Women for fear they should fall in love with us'  'Indeed  Jack'  said  Jones  'you wilfully misunderstand me I do not fancy Women are so apt to fall in love but you have gone far beyond common Gallantries'    'What do you suppose' says  Nightingale  'that we have been a bed together'  'No upon my Honour' answered  Jones  very seriously 'I do not suppose so ill of you nay I will go farther I do not imagine you have laid a regular premeditated Scheme for the Destruction of the Quiet of a poor little Creature or have even foreseen the Consequence for I am sure thou art a very goodnatured Fellow and such a one can never be guilty of a Cruelty of that Kind but at the same time you have pleased your own Vanity without considering that this poor Girl was made a Sacrifice to it and while you have had no Design but of amusing an idle Hour you have actually given her Reason to flatter herself that you had the most serious Designs in her Favour Prithee  Jack  answer me honestly To what have tended all those elegant and luscious Descriptions of Happiness arising from violent and mutual Fondness all those warm Professions of Tenderness and generous disinterested Love did you imagine she would not apply them or speak ingenuously did not you intend she should'  'Upon my Soul  Tom'  cries  Nightingale  'I did not think this was in thee Thou wilt make an admirable Parson    'So I suppose you would not go to Bed to  Nancy  now if she would let you'    'No' cries  Jones  may I be dn'd if I would'  '  'Tom Tom'  answered  Nightingale  'last Night remember last Night'  'When every Eye was clos'd and the pale Moon  'And silent Stars shone conscious of the Theft  'Lookee Mr  Nightingale'  said  Jones  I am no 'canting Hypocrite nor do I pretend to the Gift of Chastity more than my Neighbours I have been guilty with Women I own it but am not conscious that I have ever injured anynor would I to procure Pleasure to myself be knowingly the Cause of Misery to any human Being'  'Well well' said  Nightingale  I believe you and I am convinced you acquit me of any such Thing'  'I do from my Heart' answered  Jones  of having debauched the Girl but not from having gained her Affections'  'If I have' said  Nightingale  I am sorry for it but Time and Absence will soon wear off such Impressions It is a Receipt I must take myself For to confess the Truth to youI never liked any Girl half so much in my whole Life but I must let you into the whole Secret  Tom  My Father hath provided a Match for me with a Woman I never saw and she is now coming to Town in order for me to make my Addresses to her'  'At these Words  Jones  burst into a loud Fit of Laughter when  Nightingale  cried'Nay prithee don't turn me into Ridicule The Devil take me if I am not half mad about this Matter  my poor  Nanny  Oh  Jones Jones  I wish I had  Fortune in my own Possession'  'I heartily wish you had' cries  Jones  'for if th  be the Case I sincerely pity you both But surely you don't intend to go away without taking you  Leave of her'  'I would not answered  Nightingale  undergo the Pain of taking Leave for ten thousand Pound be+sides I am convinced instead of answering an  good Purpose it would only serve to inflame m  poor  Nancy  the more I beg therefore you would not mention a Word of it to day and in the Eve  +ing or tomorrow morning I intend to deaprt'  Jones  promised he would not and said upon Re+flection he thought as he had determined and w  obliged to leave her he took the most prudent Metho  he then told  Nightingale  he should be very glad  lodge in the same House with him and it was accord+ingly agreed between them that  Nightingale  should procure him either the Ground Floor or the two P  of Stairs for the young Gentleman himself was  occupy that which was between them  This  Nightingale  of whom we shall be present  obliged to say a little more was in the ordina  Transactions of Life a Man of strict Honour an  what is more rare among young Gentlemen of t  Town one of strict Honesty too yet in Affairs  Love he was somewhat looser in his Morals not th  he was even here as void of Principle as Gentlem  sometimes are and oftner affect to be but it is cer+tain he had been guilty of some indefensible Trea+chery to Women and had in a certain Mystery call  making Love practiced many Deceits which if  had used in Trade he would have been counted  greatest Villain upon Earth  But as the World I know not well for what Rea+son agree to see this Treachery in a better Light  was so far from being ashamed of his Iniquities of this Kind that he gloried in them and would often boast of his Skill in gaining of Women and his Triumphs over their Hearts for which he had before this Time received some Rebukes from  Jones  who always exprest great Bitterness against any Misbehaviour to the fair Part of the Species who if considered he said as they ought to be in the Light of the dearest Friends were to be cultivated honoured and caressed with the utmost Love and Tenderness but if regarded as Enemies were a Conquest of which a Man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it  CHAP V  A short Account of the History of Mrs  Miller  JONES  this Day eat a pretty good Dinner for a sick Man that is to say the larger Half a Shoulder of Mutton In the Afternoon he received an Invitation from Mrs  Miller  to drink Tea For that good Woman having learnt either by Means of  Partridge  or by some other Means natural or super natural that he had a Connection with Mr  Allworthy  could not endure the Thoughts of parting with him in an angry Manner  Jones  accepted the Invitation and no sooner was the Teakettle removed and the Girls sent out of the Room than the Widow without much Preface began as follows  'Well there are very surprizing Things happen in this World but certainly it is a wonderful Business that I should have a Relation of Mr  Allworthy  in my House and never know any Thing of the Matter Alas Sir you little imagine what a Friend that best of Gentlemen hath been to me and mine Yes Sir I am not ashamed to own it it is owing to his Goodness  that I did not long since perish for Want and leave my poor little Wretches two destitute helpless friendless Orphans to the Care or rather to the Cruelty of the World'  'You must know Sir though I am now reduced to get my Living by letting Lodgings I was born and bred a Gentlewoman My Father was an Officer of the Army and died in a considerable Rank But he lived up to his Pay and as that expired with him his Family at his Death became Beggars We were three Sisters One of us had the good Luck to dies soon afterwards of the Smallpox A Lady was so kind to take the second out of Charity as she said to wait upon her The Mother of this Lady had been a Servant to my Grandmother and having inherited a vast Fortune from her Father which he had got by Pawnbroking was married to a Gentleman of great Estate and Fashion She used my Sister so barbarously often upraiding her with her Birth and Poverty calling her in Derision a Gentlewoman that I believe she at length broke the Heart of the poor Girl In short she likewise died within a Twelvemonth after my Father Fortune thought proper to provide better for me and within a Month from his Decease I was married to a Clergyman who had been my Lover a long▪ Time before and who had been very i  used by my Father upon that Account for though my poor Father could not give any of us a Shilling yet he bred us up as delicately considered us and would have had us consider ourselves as highly as if we had been the richest Heiresses But my dear Husband forgot all this Usage and the Moment we were become fatherless he immediately renewed his Addresses to me so warmly that I who always liked and now more than ever esteemed him soon comply'd Five Years did I live in a State of perfect  Happiness with that best of Men 'till at lastOh cruel cruel Fortune that ever separated us that deprived me of the kindest of Husbands and my poor Girls of the tenderest ParentO my poor Girls you never knew the Blessing which ye lostI am ashamed Mr  Jones  of this womanish Weakness but I shall never mention him without Tears''I ought rather Madam' said  Jones  'to be ashamed that I do not accompany you'Well Sir' continued she 'I was now left a second Time in a much worse Condition than before besides the terrible Affliction I was to encounter I had now two Children to provide for and was if possible more pennyless than ever when that great that good that glorious Man Mr  Allworthy  who had some little Acquaintance with my Husband accidentally heard of my Distress and immediately writ this Letter to me Here Sirhere it is I put it into my Pocket to shew it you This is the Letter Sir I must and will read it you'  Madam  I I heartily condole with you on your late grievous Loss which your own good Sense and the excellent Lessons you must have learnt from the worthiest of Men will better enable you to bear than any Advice which I am capable of giving Nor have I any Doubt that you whom I have heard to be the tenderest of Mothers will suffer any immoderate Indulgence of Grief to prevent you from discharging your Duty to those poor Infants who now alone stand in Need of your Tenderness  However as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of much worldly Consideration you will pardon my having ordered a Person to wait on you and to pay you Twenty Guineas which I beg you will accept 'till I have the Pleasure of seeing you and believe me to be Madam  c  'This Letter Sir I received within a Fortnight after the irreparable Loss I have mentioned and within a Fortnight afterwards Mr  Allworthy  the blessed Mr  Allworthy  came to pay me a Visit when he placed me in the House you now see me gave me a large Sum of Money to furnish it and settled an Annuity of  l  a Year upon me which I have constantly received ever since Judge then Mr  Jones  in what Regard I must hold a Benefactor to whom I owe the Preservation of my Life and of those dear Children for whose Sake alone my Life is valuableDo not therefore think me impertinent Mr  Jones  since I must esteem one for whom I know Mr  Allworthy  hath so much Value if I beg you not to converse with these wicked Women You are a young Gentleman and do not know half their artful Wiles Do not be angry with me Sir for what I said upon account of my House you must be sensible i  would be the Ruin of my poor dear Girls Besides Sir you cannot but be acquainted that Mr  Allworthy  himself would never forgive my conniving at such Matters and particularly with you'  'Upon my Word Madam' said  Jones  'you need make no farther Apology nor do I in the least take any Thing ill you have said but give me Leave as no one can have more Value than myself for Mr  Allworthy  to deliver you from one Mistake which perhaps would not be altogether for his Honour I do assure you I am no Relation of his'  'Alas Sir' answered she 'I know you are not I know very well who you are for Mr  Allworthy  hath told me all But I do assure you had you been twenty Times his Son he could not have express  more Regard for you than he hath often expresse  in my Presence You need not be ashamed Sir  of what you are I promise you no good Person will esteem you the less on that Account No Mr  Jones  the Words dishonourable Birth are Nonsense as my dear dear Husband used to say unless the Word dishonourable be applied to the Parents for the Children can derive no real Dishonour from an Act of which they are entirely innocent'  Here  Jones  heaved a deep Sigh and then said Since I perceive Madam you really do know me and Mr  Allworthy  hath thought proper to mention my Name to you and since you have been so explicit with me as to your own Affairs I will acquaint you with some more Circumstances concerning myself' And these Mrs  Miller  having expressed great Desire and Curiosity to hear he began and related to her his whole History without once mentioning the Name of  Sophia  There is a Kind of Sympathy in honest Minds by Means of which they give an easy Credit to each other Mrs  Miller  believed all which  Jones  told her to be true and exprest much pity and Concern for him She was beginning to comment on the Story but  Jones  interrupted her For as the Hour of Assignation now drew nigh he began to stipulate for a second Interview with the Lady that Evening which he promised should be the last at her House swearing at the same Time that she was one of great Distinction and that nothing but what was entirely innocent was to pass between them and I do firmly believe he intended to keep his Word  Mrs  Miller  was at length prevailed on and  Jones  departed to his Chamber where he sat alone till Twelve o'Clock but no Lady  Bellaston  appeared  As we have said that this Lady had a great Affection for  Jones  and as it must have appeared that she really had so the Reader may perhaps wonder at the first Failure of her Appointment as she apprehended him  to be confined by Sickness a Season when Friendship seems most to require such Visits This Behaviour therefore in the Lady may by some be condemned as unnatural but that is not our Fault for our Business is only to record Truth  CHAP VI  Containing a Scene which we doubt not will affect all our Readers  MR  Jones  closed not his Eyes during all the former Part of the Night not owing to any Uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed by Lady  Bellaston  nor was  Sophia  herself though most of his waking Hours were justly to be charged to her Account the present Cause of dispelling his Slumber  In Fact poor  Jones  was one of the bestnatured fellows alive and had all that Weakness which is called Compassion and which distinguishes this imperfect Character from that noble Firmness of Mind which rolls a Man as it were within himself and like a polished Bowl enables him to run through the Work without being once stopped by the Calamities which happen to others He could not help therefore compassionating the Situation of poor  Nancy  whose Lord for Mr  Nightingale  seemed to him so apparent th  he was astonished at the Blindness of her Mother who had more than once the preceding Evening remarked to him the great Change in the Temper o  her Daughter  'who from being' she said one o  the liveliest merriest Girls in the World was o  a sudden become all Gloom and Melancholy  Sleep however at length got the better of all Resistance and now as if he had really been a Deity as the Ancients imagined and an offended one too he seemed to enjoy his dearbought ConquestTo speak simply and without any Metaphor Mr  Jones  slept till Eleven the next Morning and would perhaps have continued in the same quiet Situation much longer had not a violent Uproar awakened him  Partridge  was now summoned who being asked what was the Matter answered  'That there was a dreadful Hurricane below Stairs that Miss  Nancy  was in Fits and that the other Sister and the Mother were both crying and lamenting over her'  Jones  expressed much Concern at this News which  Partridge  endeavoured to relieve by saying with a Smile  'He fancied the young Lady was in no Danger of Death for that  Susan  which was the Name of the Maid had given him to understand it was nothing more than a common Affair In short' said he 'Miss  Nancy  hath had a Mind to be as wise as her Mother that's all She was a little hungry it seems and so sat down to Dinner before Grace was said and so there is a Child coming for the Foundling Hospital''Prithee leave thy stupid jesting' cries  Jones  'is the Misery of these poor Wretches a Subject of Mirth Go immediately to Mrs  Miller  and tell her I beg LeaveStay you will make some Blunder I will go myself for she desired me to breakfast with her'  He then rose and dressed himself as fast as he could and while he was dressing  Partridge  notwithstanding many severe Rebukes could not avoid throwing forth certain Pieces of Brutality commonly called Jests on this Occasion  Jones  was no sooner dressed than he walked down Stairs and knocking at the Door was presently admitted by the Maid into the outward Parlour which was as empty of Company as it was of any Apparatus for eating Mrs  Miller  was in the inner Room with her Daughter whence the Maid presently brought a Message to Mr  Jones  'that her Mistress hoped he would excuse the Disappointment  but an Accident had happened which made it impossible for her to have the Pleasure of his Company at Breakfast that Day and begged his Pardon for not sending him up Notice sooner'  Jones  'desired she would give herself no Trouble about any Thing so triffling as his Disappointment that he was heartily sorry for the Occasion and that if he could be of any Service to her she might command him'  He had scarce spoke these Words when Mrs  Miller  who heard them all suddenly threw open the Door and coming out to him in a Flood of Tears said  'O Mr  Jones  you are certainly one of the best young Men alive I give you a thousand Thanks for your kind Offer of your Service but alas Sir it is out of your Power to preserve my poor GirlO my Child my Child She is undone she is ruined for ever'  'I hope Madam' said  Jones  no Villain'    'O Mr  Jones'  said she 'tha  Villain who Yesterday left my Lodgings hath betrayed my poor Girl hath destroyed herknow you are a Man of Honour You have gooda noble Heart Mr  Jones  The Actions to which I have been myself a Witness could proceed from no other I will tell you all Nay indeed it is impossible after what hath happened to keep it a Secret That  Nightingale  that barbarous Villain hath undone my Daughter She isshe isoh Mr  Jones  my Girl is with Child by him and in that Condition he hath deserted he  Here here Sir is his cruel Letter read it Mr  Jones  and tell me if such another Monster lives'  The Letter was as follows  Dear  Nancy  As I found it impossible to mention to you what am afraid will be no less shocking to you than it  to me I have taken this Method to inform you that my Father insists upon my immediately paying my Addresses to a young Lady of Fortune whom he hath provided for myI need not write the detested Word Your own good Understanding will make you sensible how entirely I am obliged to an Obedience by which I shall be for ever excluded from your dear Arms The Fondness of your Mother may encourage you to trust her with the unhappy Consequence of our Love which may be easily kept a Secret from the World and for which I will take Care to provide as I will for you I wish you may feel less on this Account than I have suffered But summon all your Fortitude to your Assistance and forgive and forget the Man whom nothing but the Prospect of certain Ruin could have forced to write this Letter I bid you forget me I mean only as a Lover but the best of Friends you shall ever find in  Your faithful tho' unhappy J N  When  Jones  had read this Letter they both stood ent during a Minute looking at each other at last began thus  'I cannot express Madam how much I am shocked at what I have read yet let me beg you in one Particular to take the Writer's Advice Consider the Reputation of your Daughter'  '  'It is gone it is lost Mr  Jones'  cry'd she 'as well as her Innocence She received the Letter  n a Roomfull of Company and immediately swooning away upon opening it the Contents were known to every one present But the loss of her Reputation bad as it is is not the worst I shall  ose my Child she hath attempted twice to destroy herself already And though she hath been hitherto prevented vows she will not outlive it nor could  I myself outlive any Accident of that NatureWhat then will become of my little  Betsy  a help+less infant Orphan And the poor little Wret  will I believe break her Heart at the Miseries wi  which she sees her Sister and myself distracted wh  she is ignorant of the CauseO 'tis the most sen+sible and the bestnatured little Thing The bar+barous cruelhath destroyed us all O my poo  Children Is this the Reward of all my Cares this the Fruit of all my Prospects Have I so cheer+fully undergone all the Labours and Duties of Mother Have I been so tender of their Infancy so careful of their Education Have I been to  so many Years denying myself even the Conv  +niencies of Life to provide some little Sustena  for them to lose one or both in such a Manner  'Indeed Madam' said  Jones  with Tears in b  Eyes 'I pity you from my Soul'    'O Mr  Jones'  answered she 'even you though I kno  the Goodness of your Heart can have no Idea what I feel The best the kindest the most d  +tiful of Children O my poor  Nancy  the Darli  of my Soul the Delight of my Eyes the Pride my Heart Too much indeed my Pride for these foolish ambitious Hopes arising from  Beauty I owe her Ruin Alas I saw with Plea+sure the Liking which this young Man had for h  I thought it an honourable Affection and flatter my foolish Vanity with the Thoughts of seeing  married to one so much her superior And a thou+sand Times in my Presence nay often in you  he hath endeavoured to sooth and encourage th  Hopes by the most generous Expressions of disin+rested Love which he hath always directed to  poor Girl and which I as well as she believed be real Could I have believed that these were on+ly Snares laid to betray the Innocence of my Chi  and for the Ruin of us all'  At these Words  ittle  Betsy  came running into the Room crying  'Dear Mamma for Heaven's Sake come to my Sister for she is in another Fit and my Cousin can't hold her'  Mrs  Miller  immediately obeyed the Summons but first ordered  Betsy  to stay with Mr  Jones  and begged him to entertain her a few Minutes saying in the most pathetic Voice  'Good Heaven let me preserve one of my Children at least'  Jones  in Compliance with this Request did all he could to comfort the little Girl though he was in Reality himself very highly affected with Mrs  Miller'  s Story He told her  'her Sister would be very well again soon That by taking on in that Manner she would not only make her Sister worse but make her Mother ill too'  'Indeed Sir says she I would not do any Thing to hurt them for the World I would burst my Heart rather than they should see me cryBut my poor Sister can't see me cryI am afraid she will never be able to see me cry any more Indeed I can't part with her indeed I can'tAnd then poor Mamma too what will become of herShe says she will die too and leave me but I am resolved I won't be left behind'  'And are you not afraid to die my little  Betsy  '  said  Jones  'Yes' answered she 'I was always afraid to die because I must have left my Mamma and my Sister but I am not afraid of going any where with those I love'  Jones  was so pleased with this Answer that he  gerly kissed the Child and soon after Mrs  Miller  urned saying  'She thanked Heaven  Nancy  was  ow come to herself And now  Betsy'  says she you may go in for your Sister is better and longs to see you'  She then turned to  Jones  and began  renew her Apologies for having disappointed him his Breakfast  'I hope Madam' said  Jones  'I shall have a more exquisite Repast than any you could have provided for me This I assure you will be the Case if I can do any Service to this little Family of Love Bu  whatever Success may attend my Endeavours I am resolved to attempt it I am very much deceived in Mr  Nightingale  if notwithstanding what hat  happened he hath not much Goodness of Heart a  the Bottom as well as a very violent Affection for your Daughter If this be the Case I think th  Picture which I shall lay before him will affect him Endeavour Madam to comfort yourself an  Miss  Nancy  as well as you can I will go instant+ly in quest of Mr  Nightingale  and I hope to brin  you good News'  Mrs  Miller  fell upon her Knees and invoked a  the Blessings of Heaven upon Mr  Jones  to which sh  aftewards added the most passionate Expressions o  Gratitude He then departed to find Mr  Nightin+gale  and the good Woman returned to comfort he Daughter who was somewhat cheared at what he  Mother told her and both joined in resounding th  Praises of Mr  Jones  CHAP VII  The Interview between Mr  Jones  and Mr  Nightingale  THE Good or Evil we confer on others ve  often I believe recoils on ourselves For Men of a benign Disposition enjoy their own Acts Beneficence equally with those to whom they a  done so there are scarce any Natures so entirely di  +bolical as to be capable of doing Injuries with  paying themselves some Pangs for the Ruin wh  they bring on their FellowCreatures  Mr  Nightingale  at least was not such a Pers  On the contrary  Jones  found him in his new Lo  +ings sitting melancholy by the Fire and silently  menting the unhappy Situation in which he had placed poor  Nancy  He no sooner saw his Friend appear than he rose hastily to meet him and after much Congratulation said  'Nothing could have been more opportune than this kind Visit for I was never more in the Spleen in my Life'  'I am sorry' answered  Jones  'that I bring News very unlikely to relieve you nay what I am convinced must of all other shock you the most However it is necessary you should know it Without further Preface then I come to you Mr  Nightingale  from a worthy Family which you have involved in Misery and Ruin'  Mr  Nightingale  changed Colour at these Words but  Jones  without regarding it proceeded in the liveliest Manner to paint the tragical Story with which the Reader was acquainted in the last Chapter  Nightingale  never once interrupted the Narration though he discovered violent Emotions at many Parts of it But when it was concluded after fetching a  eep Sigh he said  'What you tell me my Friend affects me in the tenderest Manner Sure there never was so cursed an Accident as the poor Girl's betraying my Letter Her Reputation might otherwise have been safe and the Affair might have remained a profound Secret and then the Girl might have gone off never the worse for many such Things happen in this Town and if the Husband should suspect a little when it is too late it will be his wiser Conduct to conceal his Suspicion both from his Wife and the World'  'Indeed my Friend' answered  Jones  'this could not have been the Case with your poor  Nancy  You have so entirely gained her Affections that it is the Loss of you and not of her Reputation which afflicts her and will end in the Destruction of her and her Family'  'Nay for that Matter I promise  you' cries  Nightingale  'she hath my Affections so absolutely that my Wife whoever she is to be will have very little Share in them' And is it possible then' said  Jones  'you can think of deserting her'  'Why what can I do' answered the other'  'Ask Miss  Nancy'  replied  Jones  warmly 'In the Condition to which you have reduced her I sincerely think she ought to determine what Reparation you shall make her Her Interest alone and not yours ought to be your sole Consideration But if you ask me what you shall do what can you do less' cries  Jones  'than to fulfil the Expectations of her Family and her own Nay and I sincerely tell you they were mine too ever since I first saw you together You will pardon me if I presume on the Friendship you have favoured me with moved as I am with Compassion for those poor Creatures But your own Heart will best suggest to you whether you have never intended by your Conduct to persuade the Mother as well as the Daughter into an Opinion that you designed honourably And if so though there may have been no direct Promise of Marriage in the Case I will leave to your own good Understanding how far you are bound to proceed'  'Nay I must not only confess what you have hinted' said  Nightingale  'but I am afraid even that very Promise you mention I have given'  'And can you after owning that' said  Jones  'hesitate a Moment'  'Consider my Friend' answered the other 'I know you are a Man of Honour and would advise no one to act contrary to its Rules if there were no other Objection can I after this Publication of her Disgrace think of such an Alliance with Honour'  'Undoubtedly' replied  Jones  'and the very best and truest Honour which is Goodness requires it of you As you mention a Scruple  of this Kind you will give me leave to examine it Can you with Honour be guilty of having under false Pretences deceived a young Woman and her Family and of having by these Means treacherously robbed her of her Innocence Can you with Honour be the knowing the wilful nay I must add the artful Contriver of the Ruin of a Human Being Can you with Honour destroy the Fame the Peace nay probably both the Life and Soul too of this Creature Can Honour bear the Thought that this Creature is a tender helpless defenceless young Woman A young Woman who loves who doats on you who dies for you who hath placed the utmost Confidence in your Promises and to that Confidence hath sacrificed every Thing which is dear to her Can Honour support such Contemplations as these a Moment'  'Common Sense indeed' said  Nightingale  'warrants all you say but yet you well know the Opinion of the World is so much the contrary that was I to marry a Whore tho' my own I should be ashamed of ever showing my Face again'  'Fie upon it Mr  Nightingale'  said  Jones  'do not call her by so ungenerous a Name When you promised to marry her she became your Wife and she hath sinned more against Prudence than Virtue And what is this World which you would be ashamed to face but the Vile the Foolish and the Profligate Forgive me if I say such a Shame must proceed from false Modesty which always attends false Honour as its ShadowBut I am well assured there is not a Man of real Sense and Goodness in the World who would not honour and applaud the Action But admit no other would would not your own Heart my Friend applaud it And do not the warm rapturous Sensations which we feel from the Consciousness of an honest noble generous  benevolent Action convey more Delight to the Mind than the undeserved Praise of Millions Set the Alternative fairly before your Eyes On the one Side see this poor unhappy tender believing Girl in the Arms of her wretched Mother breathing her last Hear her breaking Heart in Agonies sighing out your Name and lamenting rather than accusing the Cruelty which weighs her down to Destruction Paint to your Imagination the Circumstances of her fond despairing Parent driven to Madness or perhaps to Death by the Loss of her lovely Daughter View the poor helpless OrphanInfant And when your Mind hath dwelt a Moment only on such Ideas consider yourself as the Cause of all the Ruin of this poor little worthy defenceless Family On the other Side consider yourself as relieving them from their temporary Sufferings Think with what Joy with what Transports that lovely Creature will fly to your Arms See her Blood returning to her pale Cheeks her Fire to her languid Eyes and Raptures to her tortured Breast Consider the Exultations of her Mother the Happiness of all Think of this little Family made by one Act of yours completely happy Think of this Alternative and sure I am mistaken in my Friend if it requires any long Deliberation whether he will sink these Wretches down for ever or by one generous noble Resolution raise them all from the Brink of Misery and Despair to the highest Pitch of human Happiness Add to this but one Consideration more the Consideration that it is your Duty so to doThat the Misery from which you will relieve these poor People is the Misery which you yourself have wilfully brought upon them'  'O my dear Friend' cries  Nightingale  'I wanted not your Eloquence to rouse me I pity poor  Nancy  from my Soul and would willingly give any Thing in my Power that no Familiarities had ever passed between us Nay believe me I had many Struggles with my Passion before I could prevail with myself to write that cruel Letter which hath caused all the Misery in that unhappy Family If I had no Inclinations to consult but my own I would marry her Tomorrow Morning I would by Heaven but you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on my Father to consent to such a Match besides he hath provided another for me and Tomorrow by his express Command I am to wait on the Lady'  'I have not the Honour to know your Father' said  Jones  'but suppose he could be persuaded would you yourself consent to the only Means of preserving these poor People' 'As eagerly as I would pursue my Happiness' answered  Nightingale  'for I never shall find it in any other WomanO my dear Friend could you imagine what I have felt within these twelve Hours for my poor Girl I am convinced she would not engross all your Pity Passion leads me only to her and if I had any foolish Scruples of Honour you have fully satisfied them Could my Father be induced to comply with my Desires nothing would be wanting to compleat my own Happiness or that of my  Nancy  '  'Then I am resolved to undertake it' said  Jones  'You must not be angry with me in whatever Light it may be necessary to set this Affair which you may depend on it could not otherwise be long hid from him for Things of this Nature make a quick Progress when once they get abroad as this unhappily hath already Besides should any fatal Accident follow as upon my Soul I am afraid will unless immediately prevented the Public would ring of your Name in a Manner which if your Father  hath common Humanity must offend him If you will therefore tell me where I may find the old Gentleman I will not loose a Moment in the Business which while I pursue you cannot do a more genereous Action than by paying a Visit to the poor Girl You will find I have not exaggerated in the Account I have given of the Wretchedness of the Family'  Nightingale  immediately consented to the Proposal and now having acquainted  Jones  with his Father's Lodging and the Coffeehouse where he would most probably find him he hesitated a Moment and then said  'My dear  Tom  you are going to undertake an Impossibility If you knew my Father you would never think of obtaining his ConsentStay there is one WaySuppose you told him I was already married it might be easier to reconcile him to the Fact after it was done and upon my Honour I am so affected with what you have said and I love my  Nancy  so passionately I almost wish it was done whatever might be the Consequence'  Jones  greatly approved the Hint and promised to pursue it They then separated  Nightingale  to visit his  Nancy  and  Jones  in quest of the old Gentleman  CHAP VIII  What passed between  Jones  and old Mr  Nightingale  with the Arrival of a Person not yet mentioned in this History  NOtwithstanding the Sentiment of the  Roman  Satyrist which denies the Divinity of Fortune and the Opinion of  Seneca  to the same Purpose  Cicero  who was I believe a wiser Man than either of them expresly holds the contrary and certain it is there are some Incidents in Life so very strange and unaccountable that it seems to require more than human Skill and Foresight in producing them  Of this Kind was what now happened to  Jones  who found Mr  Nightingale  the elder in so critical a Minute that Fortune if she was really worthy all the Worship she received at  Rome  could not have contrived such another In short the old Gentleman and the Father of the young Lady whom he intended for his Son had been hard at it for many Hours and the  atter was just now gone and had left the former delighted with the Thoughts that he had succeeded in a long Contention which had been between the two Fathers of the future Bride and Bridegroom in which both endeavoured to overreach the other and as not rarely happens in such Cases both had retreated fully satisfied of having obtained the Victory  This Gentleman whom Mr  Jones  now visited was what they call a Man of the World that is to say a Man who directs his Conduct in this World as one who being fully persuaded there is no other as resolved to make the most of this In his early Years he had been bred to Trade but having acquired a very good Fortune he had lately declined his Business or to speak more properly had changed it from dealing in Goods to dealing only in Money of which he had always a plentiful Fund at Command and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful Advantage sometimes of the Necessities of private Men and sometimes those of the Public He had indeed conversed so entirely with Money that it may be almost doubted whether he imagined there was any other thing really existing in the World this at least may be certainly averred that he firmly believed nothing else to have any real Value  The Reader will I fancy allow that Fortune could not have culled out a more improper Person for Mr  Jones  to attack with any Probability of Success nor could the whimsical Lady have directed this Attack at a more unseasonable Time  As Money then was always uppermost in this Gentleman's Thoughts so the Moment he saw a Stranger within his Doors it immediately occurred to his Imagination that such Stranger was either come to bring him Money or to fetch it from him And according as one or other of these Thoughts prevailed he conceived a favourable or unfavourable Idea of the Person who approached him  Unluckily for  Jones  the latter of these was the Ascendant at present for as a young Gentleman had visited him the Day before with a Bill from his Son for a Play Debt he apprehended at the first Sight of  Jones  that he was come on such another Errand  Jones  therefore had no sooner told him that he was come on his Son's Account than the old Gentleman being confirmed in his Suspicion burst forth into an Exclamation 'That he would lose his Labour'  'Is it then possible Sir' answered  Jones  'that you can guess my Business' If I do guess it replied the other I repeat again to you you will lose your Labour What I suppose you are one of those Sparks who lead my Son into all those Scenes of Riot and Debauchery which will be his Destruction but I shall pay no more of his Bills I promise you I expect he will quit all such Company for the future If I had imagined otherwise I should not have provided a Wife for him for I would be instrumental in the Ruin of no Body' 'How Sir said  Jones  and was this Lady of your providing'  'Pray Sir' answered the old Gentleman 'how comes it to be any Concern of yours'    'Nay dear Sir' replied  Jones  'be not offended that I interest myself in what regards your Son's Happiness for whom I have so great an Honour and Value It was upon that very Account I came to wait upon you I can't express the Satisfaction you have given me by what you say for I do assure you your Son is a Person for whom  I have the highest HonourNay Sir it is not easy to express the Esteem I have for you who could be so generous so good so kind so indulgent to provide such a Match for your Son a Woman who I dare swear will make him one of the happiest Men upon Earth'  There is scarce any thing which so happily introduces Men to our good Liking as having conceived some Alarm at their first Appearance when once those Apprehensions begin to vanish we soon forget the Fears which they occasion and look on ourselves as indebted for our present Ease to those very Persons who at first rais'd our Fears  Thus it happened to  Nightingale  who no sooner found that  Jones  had no Demand on him as he suspected than he began to be pleased with his Presence  'Pray good Sir said he be pleased to sit down I do not remember to have ever had the Pleasure of seeing you before but if you are a Friend of my Son and have any thing to say concerning this young Lady I shall be glad to hear you As to her making him happy it will be his own Fault if she doth not I have discharged my Duty in taking Care of the main Article She will bring him a Fortune capable of making any reasonable prudent sober Man happy'  'Undoubtedly cries  Jones  for she is in herself a Fortune so beautiful so genteel so sweettempered and so well educated she is indeed a most accomplished young Lady sings admirably well and hath a most delicate Hand at the Harpsichord' 'I did not know any of these Matters answered the old Gentleman for I never saw the the Lady but I do not like her the worse for what you tell me and I am the better pleased with her Father for not laying any Stress on these Qualifications in our Bargain I shall always think it a Proof of his Understanding A silly Fellow would have  brought in these Articles as an Addition to her Fortune but to give him his due he never mentioned any such Matter though to be sure they are no Disparagements to a Woman'  'I do assure you Sir' cries  Jones  'she hath them all in the most eminent Degree For my Part I own I was afraid you might have been a little backward a little less inclined to the Match For your Son told me you had never seen the Lady therefore I came Sir in that Case to entreat you to conjure you as you value the Happiness of your Son not to beaverse to his Match with a Woman who hath not only all the good Qualities I have mentioned but many more'    'If that was your Business Sir said the old Gentleman we are both obliged to you and you may be perfectly easy for I give you my Word I was very well satisfied with her Fortune'  'Sir' answered  Jones  I honour you every Moment more and more To be so easily satisfied so very moderate on that Account is a Proof of the Soundness of your Understanding as well as the Nobleness of your Mind'    'Not so very moderate young Gentleman not so very moderate answered the FatherStill more and more noble replied  Jones  and give me Leave to add sensible For sure it is little less than Madness to consider Money as the sole Foundation of Happiness Such a Woman as this with her little her nothing of a Fortune'    'I find cries the old Gentleman you have a pretty just Opinion of Money my Friend or else you are better acquainted with the Person of the Lady than with her Circumstances Why pray what Fortune do you imagine this Lady to have'    'What Fortune cries  Jones  why too contemptible a one to be named for your Son Well well well said the other perhaps he might have done better''That I deny said  Jones  for she is one of the best of Women'  'Ay ay but in Point of Fortune I meananswered the otherAnd yet as to that now how much do you imagine your Friend is to have'    'How much cries  Jones  how muchWhy at the utmost perhaps  l  '  'Do you mean to banter me young Gentleman said the Father a little angry'    'No upon my Soul answered  Jones  I am in Earnest nay I believe I have gone to the utmost Farthing If I do the Lady an Injury I ask her Pardon'  'Indeed you do cries the Father I am certain she hath fifty Times that Sum and she shall produce fifty to that before I consent that she shall marry my Son'  'Nay said  Jones  it is too late to talk of Consent nowIf she hath not fifty Farthings your Son is married'    'My Son married answered the old Gentleman with Surprise'  'Nay said  Jones  'I thought you was unacquainted with it'    'My Son married to Miss  Harris  ' answered he again'    'To Miss  Harris  Said  Jones  no Sir to Miss  Nancy Miller  the Daughter of Mrs  Miller  at whose House he lodged a young Lady who though her Mother is reduced to let Lodgings'    'Are you bantering or are you in Earnest'  cries the Father with a most solemn Voice  'Indeed Sir answered  Jones  'I scorn the Character of a Banterer I came to you in most serious Earnest imagining as I find true that your Son had never dared acquaint you with a Match so much inferior to him in Point of Fortune tho' the Reputation of the Lady will suffer it no longer to remain a Secret'  While the Father stood like one struck suddenly  mb at this News a Gentleman came into the  oom and saluted him by the Name of Brother  But though these two were in Consanguinity so  arly related they were in their Dispositions almost  e opposites to each other The Brother who now  arrived had likewise been bred to Trade in which he no sooner saw himself worth  l  than he purchase  a small Estate with the greatest Part of it and retired into the Country where he married the Daughter o  an unbeneficed Clergyman a young Lady who though she had neither Beauty nor Fortune had recommended herself to his Choice entirely by her good Humour of which she possessed a very immoderate Share  With this Woman he had during twentyfive Years lived a Life more resembling the Model which certain Poets ascribe to the Golden Age than any o  those Patterns which are furnished by the present Times By her he had four Children but none o  them arrived at Maturity except only one Daughter whom in vulgar Language he and his Wife had spoiled that is had educated with the utmost Tenderness and Fondness which she returned to such a Degree that she had actually refused a very extraordinary Match with a Gentleman a little turned of forty because she could not bring herself to part with her Parents  The young Lady whom Mr  Nightingale  had intended for his Son was a near Neighbour of his Brother and an Acquaintance of his Niece and in reality it was upon the Account of this projected Match that he was now come to Town not indeed to forward but to dissuade his Brother from a Purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his Nephew for  foresaw no other Event from a Union with Miss  Harris  notwithstanding the Largeness of her Fortune  neither her Person nor Mind seemed to him to promi  any Kind of matrimonial Felicity for she was very tall very thin very ugly very affected very silly and very illnatured  His Brother therefore no sooner mentioned the Marriage of his Nephew with Miss  Miller  than he exprest  the utmost Satisfaction and when the Father had very bitterly reviled his Son and pronounced Sentence of Beggary upon him the Uncle began in the following Manner  'If you was a little cooler Brother I would ask you whether you love your Son for his Sake or for your own You would answer I suppose and so I suppose you think for his Sake and doubtless it is his Happiness which you intended in the Marriage you proposed for him'  'Now Brother to prescribe Rules of Happiness to others hath always appeared to me very absurd and to insist on doing this very tyrannical It is a vulgar Error I know but it is nevertheless an Error And if this be absurd in other Things it is mostly so in the Affair of Marriage the Happiness of which depends entirely on the Affection which subsists between the Parties'  'I have therefore always thought it unreasonable in Parents to desire to chuse for their Children on this Occasion since to force Affection is an impossible Attempt nay so much doth Love abhor Force that I know not whether through an unfortunate but incureable Perverseness in our Natures it may not be even impatient of Persuasion'  'It is however true that though a Parent will not I think wisely prescribe he ought to be consulted on this Occasion and in Strictness perhaps should at least have a negative Voice My Nephew therefore I own in marrying without asking your Advice hath been guilty of a Fault But honestly speaking Brother have you not a little promoted this Fault Have not your frequent Declarations on this Subject given him a moral Certainty of your Refusal where there was any Deficiency in Point of Fortune nay doth not your present Anger arise solely from that Deficiency And if he hath  failed in his Duty here did not you as much exceed that Authority when you absolutely bargained with him for a Woman without his Knowledge whom you yourself never saw and whom if you had seen and known as well as I it must have been Madness in you to have ever thought of bringing her into your Family'  'Still I own my Nephew in a Fault but surely it is not an unpardonable Fault He hath acted indeed without your Consent in a Matter in which he ought to have asked it but it is in a Matter in which his Interest is principally concerned you yourself must and will acknowledge that you consulted his Interest only and if he unfortunately differed from you and hath been mistaken in his Notion of Happiness will you Brother if you love your Son carry him still wider from the Point Will you encrease the ill Consequences of his simple Choice Will you endeavour to make an Event certain Misery to him which may accidentally prove so In a Word Brother because he hath put it out of your Power to make his Circumstances as affluent as you would will you distress them as much as you can'  By the Force of the true Catholic Faith St  Anthony  won upon the Fishes  Orpheus  and  Amphi  went a little farther and by the Charms of Music enchanted Things merely inanimate Wonderful both  But neither History nor Fable have ever yet ventured to record an Instance of any one who by Force o  Argument and Reason had triumphed over habitu  Avarice  Mr  Nightingale  the Father instead of attempting to answer his Brother contented himself with only observing that they had always differed in their Sentiments concerning the Education of their Children  'I wish said he Brother you would have consined  your Care to your own Daughter and never have troubled yourself with my Son who hath I believe as little profited by your Precepts as by your Example'  For young  Nightingale  was his Uncle's  odson and had lived more with him than with his  ather So that the Uncle had often declared he loved  is Nephew almost equally with his own Child  Jones  fell into Raptures with this good Gentleman  nd when after much Perswasion they found the Fa  er grew still more and more irritated instead of ap  eased  Jones  conducted the Uncle to his Nephew at  e House of Mrs  Miller  CHAP IX  Containing strange Matters  AT his Return to his Lodgings  Jones  found the Situation of Affairs greatly altered from what  ey had been in at his Departure The Mother the  wo Daughters and young Mr  Nightingale  were now  t down to Supper together when the Uncle was at  s own Desire introduced without any Ceremony to the Company to all of whom he was well known  he had several Times visited his Nephew at that  ouse  The old Gentleman immediately walked up to Miss  Nancy  saluted and wished her Joy as he did afterwards the Mother and the other Sister and lastly  paid the proper Compliments to his Nephew with  e same good Humour and Curtesy as if his Nephew  d married his equal or superior in Fortune with all  e previous Requisites first performed  Miss  Nancy  and her supposed Husband both turned  e and looked rather foolish than otherwise upon  e Occasion but Mrs  Miller  took the first Oppor  nity of withdrawing and having sent for  Jones  into  e Dining Room she threw herself at his Feet and in  a most passionate Flood of Tears called him her good Angel the preserver of her poor little Family with many other respectful and endearing Appellations and made him every Acknowledgment which the highest Benefit can extract from the most grateful Hearts  After the first Gust of her Passion was a little over which she declared if she had not vented would have burst her she proceeded to inform Mr  Jones  that all Matters were settled between Mr  Nightingale  and her Daughter and that they were to be married the next Morning At which Mr  Jones  having exprest much Pleasure the poor Woman fell again into a Fit of Joy and Thanksgiving which he at lengt  with Difficulty silenced and prevailed on her t  return with him back to the Company whom the  found in the same good Humour in which they ha  left them  This little Society now past two or three very a+greeable Hours together in which the Uncle wh  was a very great Lover of his Bottle had so w  +ply'd his Nephew that this latter though not dru  began to be somewhat flustered and now Mr  Night+ingale  taking the old Gentleman with him up St  into the Apartment he had lately occupied unb  +somed himself as follows  'As you have been always the best and kindest Uncles to me and as you have shewn such un  +rallelled Goodness in forgiving this Match which be sure may be thought a little improvident I sho  never forgive myself if I attempted to deceive y  in any thing'  He then confessed the Truth a  opened the whole Affair  'How  Jack  said the old Gentleman and  you really then not married to this young Woman No upon my Honour answered  Nightingale  have told you the simple Truth My dear B  cries the Uncle kissing him I am heartily glad to hear it I never was better pleased in my Life If you had been married I should have assisted you as much as was in my Power to have made the best of a bad Matter but there is a great Difference between considering a Thing which is already done and irrecoverable and that which is yet to do Let your Reason have fair Play  Jack  and you will see this Match in so foolish and preposterous a Light that there will be no Need of any dissuasive Arguguments'  'How Sir replies young  Nightingale  is there this Difference between having already done an Act and being in Honour engaged to do it'  'Pugh said the Uncle Honour is a Creature of the World's making and the World hath the Power of a Creator over it and may govern and direct it as they please Now you well know how trivial these Breaches of Contract are thought even the grossest make but the Wonder and Conversation of a Day Is there a Man who will be afterwards more backward in giving you his Sister or Daughter Or is there any Sister or Daughter who would be more backward to receive you Honour is not concerned in these Engagements'  'Pardon me dear Sir cries  Nightingale  I can never think so and not only Honour but Conscience and Humanity are concerned I am well satisfied that was I now to disappoint the young Creature her Death would be the Consequence and I should look on myself as her Murderer nay as her Murderer by the cruel  est of all Methods by breaking her Heart'  'Break her Heart indeed no no  Jack  cries the Uncle the Hearts of Women are not so soon broke they are tough Boy they are tough'  'But Sir answered  Nightingale  my own Affections are engaged and I never could be happy with any other Woman'  'How often have I heard you say that  Children should be always suffered to chuse for themselves and that you would let my Cousin  Harriet  do so'  'Why ay replied the old Gentleman so I would have them but then I would have them chuse wisely'    'Indeed  Jack  you must and shall leave this Girl'    'Indeed Uncle cries the other I must and will have her'  'You will young Gentleman said the Uncle I did not expect such a Word from you I should not wonder if you had used such Language to your Father who had always treated you like a Dog and kept you at the Distance which a Tyrant preserves over his Subjects but I who have lived with you upon an equal Footing might surely expect better Usage But I know how to account for it all it is all owing to your preposterous Education in which I have had too little Share There is my Daughter now whom I have brought up as my Friend never doth any thing without my Advice nor ever refuses to take it when I give it her'  'You have never yet given her Advice in an Affair of this Kind said  Nightingale  for I am greatly mistaken in my Cousin if she would be very ready to obey even your most positive Command in abandoning her Inclinations'  'Don't abuse my Girl answered the old Gentleman with some Emotion don't abuse my  Harriet  I have brought her up to have no Inclinations contrary to my own By suffering her to do whatever she pleases I have enured her to a Habit of being pleased to do whatever I like'  'Pardon me Sir said  Nightingale  I have not the least Design to reflect on my Cousin for whom I have the greatest Esteem and indeed I am convinced you will never put he  to so severe a Trial or lay such hard Command on her as you would do on meBut dear Sir le  us return to the Company for they will begin to be uneasy at our long Absence I must beg on  Favour of my dear Uncle which is that he would not say any thing to shock the poor Girl or her Mother'  'O you need not fear me answered he I understand myself too well to affront Women so I will readily grant you that Favour and in Return I must expect another of you'  'There are but few of your Commands Sir said  Nightingale  which I shall not very chearfully obey'  'Nay Sir I ask nothing said the Uncle but the Honour of your Company home to my Lodging that I may reason the Case a little more fully with you For I would if possible have the Satisfaction of preserving my Family notwithstanding the headstrong Folly of my Brother who in his own Opinion is the wisest Man in the World'  Nightingale  who well knew his Uncle to be as  adstrong as his Father submitted to attend him  ome and then they both returned back into the  om where the old Gentleman promised to carry himself with the same Decorum which he had before  aintained  CHAP X  A short Chapter which concludes the Book  THE long Absence of the Uncle and the Nephew occasioned some Disquiet in the Minds of whom they had left behind them and the more during the preceding Dialogue the Uncle had  re than once elevated his Voice so as to be heard  wn Stairs which though they could not distin  sh what he said had caused some evil foreboding  Nancy  and her Mother and indeed even in  Jones  self  When the good Company therefore again assembled  e was a visible Alteration in all their Faces and good Humour which at their last Meeting universally  shone forth in every Countenance was now changed into a much less agreeable Aspect It was a Change indeed common enough to the Weather in this Climate from Sunshine to Clouds from  June  to  December  This Alteration was not however greatly remarked by any present for as every one was now endeavouring to conceal their own Thoughts and to act a Part they became all too busily engaged in the Scene to be Spectators of it Thus neither the Uncle nor Nephew saw any Symptoms of Suspicion in the Mother or Daughter nor did the Mother or Daughter remark the overact+ed Complaisance of the old Man nor the counterfeit Satisfaction which grinned in the Features of th  young one  Something like this I believe frequently happens where the whole Attention of two Friends being en+gaged in the Part which each is to act in order to impose on the other neither sees nor suspects the A  practised against himself and thus the Thrust of bo  to borrow no improper Metaphor on the Occasion alike takes Place  From the same Reason it is no unusual Thing f  both Parties to be overreached in a Bargain thoug  the one must be always the greater Loser as was  who sold a blind Horse and received a bad Note i  Payment  Our Company in about half an Hour broke up and the Uncle carried off his Nephew but not be+fore the latter had assured Miss  Nancy  in a Whisper that he would attend her early in the Morning an  fulfil all his Engagements  Jones  who was the least concerned in this Sce  saw the most He did indeed suspect the very Fact for besides observing the great Alteration in the Beha+viour of the Uncle the Distance he assumed and  overstrained Civility to Miss  Nancy  the carrying  Bridegroom from his Bride at that Time of Night was so extraordinary a Proceeding that it could be only accounted for by imagining that young  Nightingale  had revealed the whole Truth which the ap  arent Openness of his Temper and his being flustered with Liquor made too probable  While he was reasoning with himself whether he could acquaint these poor People with his Suspicion  he Maid of the House informed him that a Gentlewoman desired to speak with himHe went  mmediately out and taking the Candle from the Maid ushered his Visitant up Stairs who in the Person of Mrs  Honour  acquainted him with such dread  ul News concerning his  Sophia  that he immediately  ost all Consideration for every other Person and his whole Stock of Compassion was entirely swallowed  p in Reflections on his own Misery and on that of  is unfortunate Angel  What this dreadful Matter was the Reader will be  formed after we have first related the many preceding Steps which produced it and those will be the Subject of the following Book  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK XV  In which the History advances about two Days  CHAP I  Too short to need a Preface  THERE are a Set of Religious or rather Mo+ral Writers who teach that Virtue is th  certain Road to Happiness and Vice to Mi+sery in this World A very wholsome and comfort+able Doctrine and to which we have but one Objec+tion namely That it is not true  Indeed if by Virtue these Writers mean the Ex+ercise of those Cardinal Virtues which like good Housewives stay at home and mind only the Busi+ness of their own Family I shall very readily conced the Point For so surely do all these contribute an lead to Happiness that I would almost wish in Vio+lation of all the antient and modern Sages to ca  them rather by the Name of Wisdom than by that o  Virtue For with regard to this Life no System I  onceive was ever wiser than that of the ancient  picureans  who held this Wisdom to constitute the  hief Good nor foolisher than that of their Opposites those modern  Epicures  who place all Fe  ity in the abundant Gratification of every sensual  ppetite  But if by Virtue is meant as I almost think it ought certain relative Quality which is always busying self without Doors and seems as much interested pursuing the Good of others as its own I cannot easily agree that this is the surest way to human  appiness because I am afraid we must then include  overty and Contempt with all the Mischiefs which  ckbiting Envy and Ingratitude can bring on Man  d in our Idea of Happiness nay sometimes per  ps we shall be obliged to wait upon the said Happi  ss to a Goal since many by the above Virtue have  ought themselves thither  I have not now Leisure to enter upon so large a  eld of Speculation as here seems opening upon  e my Design was to wipe off a Doctrine that lay my Way since while Mr  Jones  was acting the  ost virtuous Part imaginable in labouring to preserve fellow Creatures from Destruction the Devil or  e other evil Spirit one perhaps cloathed in human  sh was hard at Work to make him completely  serable in the Ruin of his  Sophia  This therefore would seem an Exception to the  ve Rule if indeed it was a Rule but as we have  our Voyage through Life seen so many other Ex  tions to it we chuse to dispute the Doctrine on  ich it is founded which we don't apprehend to be  ristian which we are convinced is not true and  ich is indeed destructive of one of the noblest Ar  ents that Reason alone can furnish for the Belief Immortality  But as the Reader's Curiosity if he hath any mu  be now awake and hungry we shall provide to feed it as fast as we can  CHAP II  In which is opened a very black Design against  Sophia  I Remember a wise old Gentleman who used to say when Children are doing nothing they are doing Mischief I will not enlarge this quaint Saying to the most beautiful Part of the Creation in general but so far I may be allowed that when the  Effects of female Jealousy do not appear openly i  their proper Colours of Rage and Fury we may suspect that mischievous Passion to be at work privately and attempting to undermine what it doth not attack aboveground  This was exemplified in the Conduct of the Lady  Bellaston  who under all the Smiles which she wor  in her Countenance concealed much Indignation against  Sophia  and as she plainly saw that this young Lady stood between her and the full Indulgence o  her Desires she resolved to get rid of her by som  Means or other nor was it long before a very favour+able Opportunity of accomplishing this presented it+self to her  The Reader may be pleased to remember that whe  Sophia  was thrown into that Consternation at the Play house by the Wit and Humour of a Set of young Gentlemen who call themselves the Town we inform+ed him that she had put herself under the Protectio  of a young Nobleman who had very safely conduct+ed her to her Chair  This Nobleman who frequently visited Lady  Bel+laston  had more than once seen  Sophia  there sin  her Arrival in Town and had conceived a very grea  liking to her which Liking as Beauty never look  more amiable than in Distress  Sophia  had in th  Fright so encreased that he might now without any great Impropriety be said to be actually in love with her  It may easily be believed that he would not suffer so handsome an Occasion of improving his Acquaintance with the beloved Object as now offered itself to elapse when goodbreeding alone might have prompted him to pay her a Visit  The next Morning therefore after this Accident he waited on  Sophia  with the usual Compliments and Hopes that she had received no Harm from her last Night's Adventure  As Love like Fire when once thoroughly kindled  s soon blown into a Flame  Sophia  in a very short Time completed her Conquest Time now flew away unperceived and the Noble Lord had been two Hours in Company with the Lady before it entered  nto his Head that he had made too long a Visit Tho'  his Circumstance alone would have alarmed  Sophia  who was somewhat more a Mistress of Computation at present she had indeed much more pregnant Evidence from the Eyes of her Lover of what  ast within his Bosom nay though he did not make  ny open Declaration of his Passion yet many of  is Expressions were rather too warm and too tender  o have been imputed to Complaisance even in the Age when such Complaisance was in Fashion the very Reverse of which is well known to be the reign  ng Mode at present  Lady  Bellaston  had been apprised of his Lordship's Visit at his first Arrival and the Length of it very well satisfied her that Things went as she wished and is indeed she had suspected the second Time she saw this young Couple together This Business she rightly I think concluded that she should by no means forward by mixing in the Company while they were  ogether she therefore ordered her Servants that when my Lord was going they should tell him she  desired to speak with him and employed the intermediate Time in meditating how best to accomplish a Scheme which she made no doubt but his Lord hip would very readily embrace the Execution of  Lord  Fellamar  for that was the Title of this young Nobleman was no sooner introduced to her Ladyship than she attacked him in the following Strain  'Bless me my Lord are you here yet I thought my Servants had made a Mistake and let you got away and I wanted to see you about an Affair of some Importance'    'Indeed Lady  Bellaston'  said he I don't wonder you are astonished at the Length of my Visit For I have staid above two Hours and did not think I had staid above half a one'    'What am I to conclude from thence my Lord' said she 'The Company must be very agreeable which can make Time slide away so very deceitfully'    'Upon my Honour' said he 'the most agreeable I ever saw Pray tell me Lady  Bellaston  who is this blazing Star which you have produced among us all of a sudden'What blazing Star my Lord'  said she affecting a Surprize  'I mean' said he 'the Lady I saw here the other Day whom I had last Night in my Arms at the Playhouse and to whom I have been making that unreasonable Visit'    'O my Cousin  Western'  said she 'why that blazing Star my Lord is the Daughter of a Country Booby Squire and hath been in own about a fortnight for the first Time'    'Upon my Soul' said he 'I should swear she had been bred in a Court for besides her Beauty I never saw any thing so genteel so sensible so polite'    'O brave' cries the Lady 'My Cousin hath you I find'    'Upon my Honour' answered he 'I wish she had for I am in Love with her to Distraction'    'Nay my Lord' said she 'it is not wishing yourself very ill neither for she is a very great Fortune I  assure you she is an only Child and her Father's Estate is a good  l  a Year'  'Then I can assure you Madam' answered the Lord 'I think her the best Match in  England  '  'Indeed my Lord' replied she 'if you like her I heartily wish you had her'  'If you think so kindly of me Madam' said he 'as she is a Relation of yours will you do me the Honour to propose it to her Father'  'And are you really then in earnest'  cries the Lady with an affected Gravity  'I hope Madam' answered he 'you have a better Opinion of me than to imagine I would jest with your Ladyship in an Affair of this Kind'  'Indeed then' said the Lady 'I will most readily propose your Lordship to her Father and I can I believe assure you of his joyful Acceptance of the Proposal but there is a Bar which I am almost ashamed to mention and yet it is one you will never be able to conquer You have a Rival my Lord and a Rival who though I blush to name him neither you nor all the World will ever be able to conquer'  'Upon my Word Lady  Bellaston'  cries he 'you have struck a damp to my Heart which hath almost deprived me of Being'  'Fie my Lord' said she 'I should rather hope I had struck Fire into you A Lover and talk of Damps in your Heart I rather imagined you would have asked your Rivil's Name that you might have immediately entered the Lists with him'  'I promise you Madam' answered he 'there are very few Things I would not undertake for your charming Cousin but pray who is this happy Man'    'Why he is' said she 'what I am sorry to say most happy Men with us are one of the lowest Fellows in the World He is a Beggar a Bastard a Foundling a Fellow in meaner Circumstances than one of your Lordship's Footmen'  'And is it possible' cried he  that a young Creature with such Perfections should think of bestowing herself so unworthily'  'Alas my Lord' answered she 'consider the Countrythe Bane of all young Women is the Country There they learn a Set of romantic Notions of Love and I know not what Folly which this Town and good Company can scarce eradicate in a whole Winter'  'Indeed Madam' replied my Lord your Cousin is of too immense a Value to be thrown away Such Ruin as this must be prevented'  'Alas' cries she 'my Lord how can it be prevented'  The  'Family have already done all in their Power but the Girl is I think intoxicated and nothing less than Ruin will content her And to deal more openly with you I expect every Day to hear she is run away with him'  'What you tell me Lady  Bellaston'  answered his Lordship 'affects me most tenderly and only raises my Compassion instead of lessening my Adoration of your Cousin Some Means must be found to preserve so inestimable a Jewel Hath your Ladyship endeavoured to reason with her'  Here the Lady affected a Laugh and cried  'My dear Lord sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young Woman out of her Inclinations These inestimable Jewels are as deaf as the Jewels they wear Time my Lord Time is the only Medicine to cure their Folly but this is a Medicine which I am certain she will not take nay I live in hourly Horrors on her Account In short nothing but violent Methods will do'  'What is to be done' cries my Lord 'what Methods are to be taken'    'Is there any Method upon Earth'    'Oh Lady  Bellaston  there is nothing which I would not undertake for such a Reward'    'I really know not'  answered the Lady after a Pause and then pausing again she cried out  'Upon my Soul I am at my Wit's End on this Girl's AccountIf she can be preserved something must  be done immediately and as I say nothing but violent Methods will doIf your Lordship hath really this Attachment to my Cousin and to do her Justice except in this silly Inclination of which she will soon see her Folly she is every way deserving I think there may be one Way indeed it is a very disagreeable one and what I am almost afraid to think ofIt requires great Spirit I promise you'  'I am not conscions Madam' said he 'of any Defect there nor am I I hope suspected of any such It must be an egregious Defect indeed which could make me backward on this Occasion'  'Nay my Lord' answered she 'I am far from doubting you I am much more inclined to doubt my own Courage for I must run a monstrous Risque In short I must place such a Confidence in your Honour as a wise Woman will scarce ever place in a Man on any Consideration'  In this Point likewise my Lord very well satisfied her for his Reputation was extremely clear and common Fame did him no more than Justice in speaking well of him  'Well then' said she my LordII vow I can't bear the Apprehension of itNo it shall not beAt least every other Method must be tried Can you get rid of your Engagements and dine here today Your Lordship will have an Opportunity of seeing a little more of Miss  Western  I promise you we have no time to lose Here will be nobody but Lady  Betty  and Miss  Eagle  and Colonel  Hampsted  and  Tom Edwards  they will all go soonand I shall be at home to nobody Then your Lordship may be a little more explicit Nay' I will contrive some Method to convince you of her Attachment to this Fellow'  My Lord made proper Compliments accepted the Invitation and then they parted to dress it being now past three in  the Morning or to reckon by the old Style in the Afternoon  CHAP III  A further Explanation of the foregoing Design  THO' the Reader may have long since concluded Lady  Bellaston  to be a Member and no inconsiderable one of the Great World she was in reality a very considerable Member of  the Little World  by which Appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honourable Society which not long since flourished in this Kingdom  Among other good Principles upon which this Society was founded was one very remarkable for as it was a Rule of an honourable Club of Heroes who assembled at the close of the late War that all the Members should every Day fight once at least so 'twas in this that every Member should within the twenty four Hours tell at least one merry Fib which was to be propagated by all the Brethren and Sisterhood  Many idle Stories were told about this Society which from a certain Quality may be perhaps not unjustly supposed to have come from the Society themselves As that the Devil was the President and that he sat in Person in an elbow Chair at the upper End of the Table but upon very strict Enquiry I find there is not the least Truth in any of those Tales and that the Assembly consisted in reality of a Set of very good sort of People and the Fibs which they propagated were of a harmless Kind and tended only to produce Mirth and good Humour  Edwards  was likewise a Member of this comical Society To him therefore Lady  Bellaston  applied as a proper Instrument for her Purpose and furnished him with a Fib which he was to vent whenever the Lady gave him her Cue and this was not to be till  the Evening when all the Company but Lord  Fellamar  and himself were gone and while they were engaged in a Rubbers at Whist  To this Time then which was between seven and eight in the Evening we will convey our Reader when Lady  Bellaston  Lord  Fellamar  Miss  Western  and  Tom  being engaged at Whist and in the last Game of their Rubbers  Tom  received his Cue from Lady  Bellaston  which was I protest  Tom  you are grown intolerable lately you used to tell us all the News of the Town and now you know no more of the World than if you lived out of it  Mr  Edwards  then began as follows  'The Fault is not mine Madam It lies in the Dulness of the Age that doth nothing worth talking OfO la tho' now I think on't there hath a terrible Accident befallen poor Col  Wilcox  Poor  Ned  You know him my Lord every body knows him faith I am very much concerned for him'  'What is it pray'  says Lady  Bellaston  'Why he hath killed a Man this Morning in a Duel that's all'  His Lordship who was not in the Secret asked gravely whom he had killed to which  Edwards  answered  'A young Fellow we none of us know a  Somersetshire  Lad just come to town one  Jones  his Name is a near Relation of one Mr  Allworthy  of whom your Lordship I believe hath heard I saw the Lad lie dead in a CoffeehouseUpon my Soul he is one of the finest Corpses I ever saw in my Life'  Sophia  who just began to deal as  Tom  had mentioned that a Man was killed stopt her Hand and listened with Attention for all Stories of that Kind affected her but no sooner had he arrived at the latter part of the Story than she began to deal again and having dealt three Cards to one and seven to another  and ten to a third at last dropt the rest from her Hand and fell back in her Chair  The Company behaved as usually on these Occasions The usual Disturbance ensued the usual Assistance was summoned and  Sophia  at last as it is usual returned again to Life and was soon after at her earnest Desire led to her own Apartment where at my Lord's Request Lady  Bellaston  acquainted her with the Truth attempted to carry it off as a Jest of her own and comforted her with repeated Assurances that neither his Lordship nor  Tom  though she had taught him the Story were in the true Secret of the Affair  There was no farther Evidence necessary to convince Lord  Fellamar  how justly the Case had been represented to him by Lady  Bellaston  and now at her Return into the Room a Scheme was laid between those two noble Persons which though it appeared in no very heinous Light to his Lordship as he faithfully promised and faithfully resolved too to make the Lady all the subsequent amends in his Power by Marriage yet many of our Readers we doubt not will see with just Detestation  The next Evening at seven was appointed for the fatal Purpose when Lady  Bellaston  undertook that  Sophia  should be alone and his Lordship should be introduced to her The whole Family were to be regulated for the Purpose most of the Servants dispatched out of the House and for Mrs  Honour  who to prevent any suspicion was to be left with her Mistress till his Lordship's Arrival Lady  Bellaston  herself was to engage her in an Apartment as distant as possible from the Scene of the intended Mischief and out of the Hearing of  Sophia  Matters being thus agreed on his Lordship took his Leave and her Ladyship retired to Rest highly pleased with a Project of which she had no reason to doubt the Success and which promised so effectually  to remove  Sophia  from being any future Obstruction to her Amour with  Jones  by a Means of which she should never appear to be guilty even if the Fact appeared to the World but this she made no doubt of preventing by huddling up a Marriage to which she thought the ravished  Sophia  would easily be brought to consent and at which all the rest of her Family would rejoice  But Affairs were not in so quiet a Situation in the Bosom of the other Conspirator His Mind was tost in all the distracting Anxiety so nobly described by  Shakespear  Between the Acting of a dreadful Thing  And the first Motion all the Interim is  Like a Phantasma or a hideous Dream  The Genius and the mortal Instruments  Are then in Council and the State of Man  Like to a little Kingdom suffers then  The Nature of an Insurrection  Though the Violence of his Passion had made him eagerly embrace the first Hint of this Design especially as it came from a Relation of the Lady yet when that Friend to Reflection a Pillow had placed the Action itself in all its natural black Colours before his Eyes with all the Consequences which must and those which might probably attend it his Resolution began to abate or rather indeed to go over to the other Side and after a long Conflict which lasted a whole Night between Honour and Appetite the former at length prevailed and he determined to wait on Lady  Bellaston  and to relinquish the Design  Lady  Bellaston  was in Bed though very late in the Morning and  Sophia  sitting by her Bedside when the Servant acquainted her that Lord  Fellamar  was below in the Parlour upon which her Ladyship desired him to stay and that she would see him presently but the Servant was no sooner departed than poor  Sophia  began to intreat her Cousin not to encourage the Visits of that odious Lord so she called him though a little unjustly upon her Account  'I see his Design' said she 'for he made downright Love to me Yesterday Morning but as I am resolved never to admit it I beg your Ladyship not to leave us alone together any more and to order the Servants that if he enquires for me I may be always denied to him'  'La Child' says Lady  Bellaston  'you Country Girls have nothing but SweetHearts in your Head you fancy every Man who is civil to you is making Love He is one of the most gallant young Fellows about Town and I am convinced means no more than a little Gallantry Make Love to you indeed I wish with all my Heart he would and you must be an arrant mad Woman to refuse him'  'But as I shall certainly be that mad Woman' cries  Sophia  'I hope his Visits shall not be intruded on me'  'O Child' said Lady  Bellaston  'you need not be so fearful if you resolve to run away with that  Jones  I know no Person who can hinder you'  'Upon my Honour Madam' cries  Sophia  'your Ladyship injures me I will never run away with any Man nor will I ever marry contrary to my Father's Inclinations'  'Well Miss  Western'  said the Lady 'if you are not in a Humour to see Company this Morning you may retire to your own Apartment for I am not frightned at his Lordship and must send for him up into my DressingRoom'  Sophia  thanked her Ladyship and withdrew and presently afterwards  Fellamar  was admitted up Stairs  CHAP IV  By which it will appear how dangerous an Advocate a Lady is when she applies her Eloquence to an ill Purpose  WHEN Lady  Bellaston  heard the young Lord's Scruples she treated them with the same Disdain with which one of those Sages of the Law called  Newgate  Solicitors treats the Qualms of Conscience in a young Witness  'My dear Lord' said she 'you certainly want a Cordial I must send to Lady  Edgely  for one of her best Drams Fie upon it have more Resolution Are you frightned by the Word Rape Or are you apprehensive Well if the Story of  Helen  was modern I should think it unnatural I mean the Behaviour of  Paris  not the Fondness of the Lady for all Women love a Man of Spirit There is another Story of the  Sabine  Ladiesand that too I thank Heaven is very ancient Your Lordship perhaps will admire my Reading but I think Mr  Hook  tells us they made tolerable good Wives afterwards I fancy few of my married Acquaintance were ravished by their Husbands' 'Nay dear Lady  Bellaston'  cried he 'don't ridicule me in this Manner 'Why my good Lord' answered she do you think any Woman in  England  would not laugh at you in her Heart whatever Prudery she might wear in her CountenanceYou force me to use a strange Kind of Language and to betray my Sex most abominably But I am contented with knowing my Intentions are good and that I am endeavouring to serve my Cousin for I think you will make her a Husband notwithstanding this or upon my Soul I would not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an empty Title She should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a Man  of Spirit for that his Enemies allow this poor young Fellow to be'  Let those who have had the Satisfaction of hearing Reflections of this Kind from a Wife or a Mistrss declare whether they are at all sweetened by coming from a Female Tongue Certain it is they sunk deeper into his Lordship than any Thing which  Demosthenes  or  Cicero  could have said on the Occasion  Lady  Bellaston  perceiving she had fired the young Lord's Pride began now like a true Orator to rouse other Passions to its Assistance  'My Lord' said she in a graver Voice 'you will be pleased to remember you mentioned this Matter to me first for I would not appear to you in the Light of one who is endeavouring to put off my Cousin upon you Fourscore thousand Pounds do not stand in Need of an Advocate to recommend them Nor doth Miss  Western'  said he 'require any Recommendation from her Fortune for in my Opinion no Woman ever had half her Charms'  'Yes yes my Lord' replied the Lady looking in the Glass 'there have been Women with more than half her Charms I assure you not that I need lessen her on that Account She is a most delicious Girl that's certain and within these few Hours she will be in the Arms of one who surely doth not deserve her tho' I will give him his due I believe he is truly a Man of Spirit'  'I hope so Madam' said my Lord 'though I must own he doth not deserve her for unless Heaven or your Ladyship disappoint me she shall within that Time be in mine'  'Well spoken my Lord' answered the Lady 'I promise you no Disappointment shall happen from my Side and within this Week I am convinced I shall call your Lordship my Cousin in Public'  The Remainder of this Scene consisted entirely of Raptures Excuses and Compliments very pleasant to have heard from the Parties but rather dull when related at second Hand Here therefore we shall put an End to this Dialogue and hasten to the fatal Hour when every Thing was prepared for the Destruction of poor  Sophia  But this being the most tragical Matter in our whole History we shall treat it in a Chapter by itself  CHAP V  Containing some Matters which may affect and others which may surprize the Reader  THE Clock had now struck Seven and poor  Sophia  alone and melancholy sat reading a Tragedy It was the  Fatal Marriage  and she was now come to that Part where the poor distrest  Isabella  disposes of her WeddingRing  Here the Book dropt from her Hand and a Shower of Tears ran down into her Bosom In this Situation she had continued a Minute when the Door opened and in came Lord  Fellamar Sophia  started from her Chair at his Entrance and his Lordship advancing forwards and making a low Bow said  'I am afraid Miss  Western  I break in upon you abruptly'  'Indeed my Lord' says she 'I must own myself a little surprized at this unexpected Visit'  'If this Visit be unexpected Madam' answered Lord  Fellamar  'my Eyes must have been very faithless Interpreters of my Heart when last I had the Honour of seeing you For surely you could not otherwise have hoped to detain my Heart in your Possession without receiving a Visit from its Owner'  Sophia  confus'd as she was answered this Bombast and very properly I think with a Look of inconceivable Disdain My Lord then made another and a longer Speech of the same Sort Upon  which  Sophia  trembling said  'Am I really to conceive your Lordship to be out of your Senses Sure my Lord there is no other Excuse for such Behaviour'    'I am indeed Madam in the Situation you suppose' cries his Lordship 'and sure you will pardon the Effects of a Frenzy which you yourself have occasioned For Love hath so totally deprived me of Reason that I am scarce accountable for any of my Actions'  'Upon my Word my Lord' said  Sophia  I neither understand your Words nor your Behaviour'    'Suffer me then Madam' cries he 'at your Feet to explain both by laying open my Soul to you and declaring that I doat on you to the highest Degree of Distraction O most adorable most divine Creature what Language can express the Sentiments of my Heart'  'I do assure you my Lord' said  Sophia  'I shall not stay to hear any more of this'  'Do not' cries he 'think of leaving me thus cruelly could you know half the Torments which I feel that tender Bosom must Pity what those Eyes have caused'  Then fetching a deep Sigh and laying hold of her Hand he ran on for some Minutes in a Strain which would be a little more pleasing to the Reader than it was to the Lady and at last concluded with a Declaration  'That if he was Master of the World he would lay it at her Feet'  Sophia  then forcibly pulling away her Hand from his answered with much Spirit  'I promise you Sir your World and its Master I should spurn from me with equal Contempt'  She then offered to go and Lord  Fellamar  again laying Hold of her Hand said  'Pardon me my beloved Angel Freedoms which nothing but Despair could have tempted me takeBelieve me could I have had any Hope that my Title and Fortune neither of them inconsiderable unless when compared with your Worth would  have been accepted I had in the humblest Manner presented them to your AcceptanceBut I cannot lose youby Heaven I will sooner part with my SoulYou are you must you shall be only mine'  'My Lord' said she 'I intreat you to desist from a vain Pursuit for upon my Honour I will never hear you on this Subject Let go my Hand my Lord for I am resolved to go from you this Moment nor will I ever see you more'  'Then Madam' cries his Lordship 'I must make the best Use of this Moment for I cannot nor will live without you'    'What do you mean my Lord' said  Sophia  'I will raise the Family'  'I have no Fear Madam' answered he 'but of losing you and that I am resolved to prevent the only Way which Despair points to me'  He then caught her in his Arms upon which she screamed so loud that she must have alarmed some one to her Assistance had not Lady  Bellaston  taken Care to remove all Ears But a more lucky Circumstance happened for poor  Sophia  another Noise now broke forth which almost drowned her Cries For now the whole House rung with Where is she Dn me I'll unkennel her this Instant Shew me her Chamber I say Where is my Daughter I know she's in the House and I'll see her if she's above Ground Shew me where she is'At which last Words the Door flew open and in came Squire  Western  with his Parson and a set of Myrmidons at his Heels  How miserable must have been the Condition of poor  Sophia  when the enraged Voice of her Father was welcome to her Ears Welcome indeed it was and did he luckily come for it was the only Accident  pon Earth which could have preserved the Peace of  er Mind from being for ever destroyed  Sophia  notwithstanding her Fright presently knew  er Father's Voice and his Lordship notwithstanding  his Passion knew the Voice of Reason which peremptorily assured him it was not now a Time for the Perpetration of his Villainy Hearing therefore the Voice approach and hearing likewise whose it was for as the Squire more than once roared forth the Word Daughter so  Sophia  in the Midst of her Struggling cried out upon her Father he thought proper to relinquish his Prey having only disordered her Handkerchief and with his rude Lips committed Violence on her lovely Neck  If the Reader's Imagination doth not assist me I shall never be able to describe the Situation of these two Persons when  Western  came into the Room  Sophia  tottered into a Chair where she sat disordered pale breathless bursting with Indignation at Lord  Fellamar  affrighted and yet more rejoiced at the Arrival of her Father  His Lordship sat down near her with the Bag of his Wig hanging over one of his Shoulders the rest of his Dress being somewhat disordered and rather a greater Proportion of Linnen than is usual appearing at his Bosom As to the rest he was amazed affrighted vexed and ashamed  As to Squire  Western  he happened at this Time to be overtaken by an Enemy which very frequently pursues and seldom fails to overtake most of the Country Gentlemen in this Kingdom He was literally speaking drunk which Circumstance together with his natural Impetuosity could produce no other Effect than his running immediately up to hi  Daughter upon whom he fell foul with his Tongue in the most inveterate Manner nay he had proba+bly committed Violence with his Hands had not the Parson interposed saying  'For Heaven's Sake Si  animadvert that you are in the House of a great Lady Let me beg you to mitigate your Wrath  it should minister a Fullness of Satisfaction that yo  have found your Daughter for as to Revenge it belongeth not unto us I discern great Contrition in the Countenance of the young Lady I stand assured if you will forgive her she will repent her of all her past Offences and return unto her Duty'  The Strength of the Parson's Arms had at first  en of more Service than the Strength of his Rhe  ric However his last Words wrought some Effect and the Squire answered  'I'll forgee her if she wull ha un If wot ha un  Sophy  I'll forgee thee all Why dost unt speak Shat ha un Dn me shat ha un Why dost unt answer Was ever such a stubborn Tuoad'  'Let me intreat you Sir to be a little more moderate said the Parson you frighten the young Lady so that you deprive her of all Power of Utterance'  'Power of mine A anwered the Squire You take her Part then you do A pretty Parson truly to side with an undutiful Child Yes yes I will gee you a Living with a Pox I'll gee un to the Devil sooner'  'I humbly crave your Pardon said the Parson I assure your Worship I meant no such Matter'  My Lady  Bellaston  now entered the Room and me up to the Squire who no sooner saw her than solving to follow the Instructions of his Sister he  de her a very civil Bow in the rural Manner and  d her some of his best Compliments He then  mediately proceeded to his Complaints and said  'There my Lady Cousin there stands the most undutiful Child in the World she hankers after a beggarly Rascal and won't marry one of the greatest Matches in all  England  that we have provided for her'  'Indeed Cousin  Western  ' answered the Lady I am persuaded you wrong my Cousin 'I am sure  she hath a better Understanding I am convinced she will not refuse what she must be sensible is so much to her Advantage'  This was a wilful Mistake in Lady  Bellaston  for she well knew whom Mr  Western  meant tho' per+haps she thought he would easily be reconciled to his Lordship's Proposals  'Do you hear there quoth the Squire what he Ladyship says All your Family are for the Match Come  Sophy  be a good Girl and be dutiful an  make your Father happy'  'If my Death will make you happy Sir answer+ed  Sophia  you will shortly be so'  'It's a Lie  Sophy  it's a dnd Lie and yo  know it said the Squire'  'Indeed Miss  Western  said Lady  Bellaston  yo  injure your Father he hath nothing in View bu  your Interest in this Match and I and all you  Friends must acknowledge the highest Honour don  to your Family in the Proposal'  'Ay all of us quoth the Squire nay it was n  Proposal of mine She knows it was her Aunt pro+posed it to me firstCome  Sophy  once mo  let me beg you to be a good Girl and gee me you  Consent before your Cousin'  'Let me give him your Hand Cousin said th  Lady It is the Fashion nowadays to dispen  with Time and long Courtships'  'Pugh said the Squire what signifies Tim  won't they have Time enough to court afterward  People may Court very well after they have be  abed together'  As Lord  Fellamar  was very well assured that  was meant by Lady  Bellaston  so never having hea  nor suspected a Word of  Blifil  he made no doubt his being meant by the Father Coming up therefo  to the Squire he said  'Though I have not the Hono  Sir of being personally known to you yet as  find I have the Happiness to have my Proposals accepted let me intercede Sir in Behalf of the young Lady that she may not be more solicited at this Time'  'You intercede Sir said the Squire why who the Devil are you'  'Sir I am Lord  Fellamar  answered he and am  he happy Man whom I hope you have done the Honour of accepting for a Soninlaw'  'You are a Son of a B replied the Squire for  ll your laced Coat You my SoninLaw and be  nd to you'  'I shall take more from you Sir than from any  lan answered the Lord but I must inform you  hat I am not used to hear such Language without Resentment'  'Resent my A quoth the Squire Don't think  am afraid of such a Fellow as thee art Because  ast got a Spit there dangling at thy Side Lay by  our Spit and I'll give thee enough of meddling with what doth not belong to theeI'll teach  ou to Fatherinlaw me I'll lick thy Jacket'  'It's very well Sir said my Lord I shall make  Disturbance before the Ladies I am very well  tisfied Your humble Servant Sir Lady  Bellaston  your most obedient'  His Lordship was no sooner gone than Lady  Bel  n  coming up to Mr  Western  said  'Bless me  r what have you done You know not whom  ou have affronted he is a Nobleman of the first  nk and Fortune and Yesterday made Proposals  your Daughter and such as I am sure you must  cept with the highest Pleasure'  Answer for yourself Lady Cousin said the Squire  will have nothing to do with any of your Lords  y Daughter shall have an honest Country Gen  man  'I have pitched upon one for herand  e shall ha' unI am sorry for the trouble she  'hath given your Ladyship with all my Heart'  Lady  Bellaston  made a civil Speech upon the Word Trouble to which the Squire answered  'Why that's kindand I would do as much for your Ladyship To be sure Relations should do for one another So I wish your Ladyship a good NightCome Madam you must go along with me by fair Means or I'll have you carried down to the Coach'  '  Sophia  said she would attend him without Force but begged to go in a Chair for she said she should not be able to ride any other Way'  'Prithee cries the Squire wout unt persuade m  canst not ride in a Coach wouldst That's a pretty Thing surely No no I'll never let thee ou  of my Sight any more till art married that I promise thee'  Sophia  told him she saw he was resolve to break her Heart' 'O break thy Heart and b  dnd quoth he if a good Husband will break i  I don't value a Brass Varden not a Halfpenny o  any undutiful Bupon Earth'  He then took vio+lently hold of her Hand upon which the Parso  once more interfered begging him to use gentle Me+thods At that the Squire thundered out a Curse an  bid the Parson hold his Tongue saying  'At'n't i  Pulpit now when art a got up there I never mi  what dost say but I won't be Priestridde  nor taught how to behave myself by thee I wi  your Ladyship a good Night Come along  Sophy  be a good Girl and all shall be well Shat  un dn me shat ha un'  Mrs  Honour  appeared below Stairs and with low Curtesy to the Squire offered to attend her Mi  +tress but he pushed her away saying  'Hold M  +dam hold you come no more near my House And will you take my Maid away from me' sa  Sophia  'Yes indeed Madam will I cries t  Squire you need not fear being without a Se  +  vant I will get you another Maid and a better Maid than this who I'd lay five Pound to a Crown is no more a Maid than my Grannum No no  Sophy  she shall contrive no more Escapes I promise you'  He then packed up his Daughter and the Parson into the Hackney Coach after which he  ounted himself and ordered it to drive to his Lodg  ngs In the Way thither he suffered  Sophia  to be  uiet and entertained himself with reading a Lecture  o the Parson on good Manners and a proper Beha  iour to his Betters  It is possible he might not so easily have carried  ff his Daughter from Lady  Bellaston  had that good Lady desired to have detained her but in reality she was not a little pleased with the Confinement into which  Sophia  was going and as her Project with Lord  Fellamar  had failed of Success she was well  ontented that other violent Methods were now go  g to be used in Favour of another Man  CHAP VI  y what Means the Squire came to discover his Daughter  THOUGH the Reader in many Histories is obliged to digest much more unaccountable Ap  arances than this of Mr  Western  without any Sa  sfaction at all yet as we dearly love to oblige him  henever it is in our Power we shall now proceed  shew by what Method the Squire discovered where  s Daughter was  In the third Chapter then of the preceding Book  e gave a Hint for it is not our Custom to unfold at  y Time more than is necessary for the Occasion  at Mrs  Fitzpatrick  who was very desirous of re  nciling herself to her Uncle and Aunt  Western  ought she had a probable Opportunity by the Service  preserving  Sophia  from committing the same Crime  hich had drawn on herself the Anger of her Family  After much Deliberation therefore she resolved to inform her Aunt  Western  where her Cousin was and accordingly she writ the following Letter which we shall give the Reader at length for more Reasons than one  Honoured Madam  The Occasion of my writing this will perhaps make a Letter of mine agreeable to my dear Aunt for the Sake of one of her Neices though I have little Reason to hope it will be so on the account of another  Without more Apology as I was coming to throw my unhappy Self at your Feet I met by the strangest Accident in the World my Cousin  Sophy  whose History you are better acquainted with than myself though alas I know infinitely too much enough indeed to satisfy me that unless she is immediately prevented she is in Danger of running into the same fatal Mischief which by foolishly and ignorantly refusing your most wise and prudent Advice I have unfortunately brought on myself  I short I have seen the Man nay I was most part of Yesterday in his Company and a charming young Fellow I promise you he is By what Accident he came acquainted with me is too tedious to tell you now but I have this Morning changed my Lodging to avoid him lest he should by my Means discover my Cousin for he doth not yet know where she is and it is adviseable he should not till my Uncle hath secured herNo Time therefore is to be lost and I need only inform you that she is now with Lady  Bellaston  whom I have seen and who hath I find a Design to conceal her from her Family You know Madam she is a strange Woman but nothing could misbecome me more than to presume to give any Hint to one of your great Understanding and great Knowledge of the World besides barely informing you of the Matter of Fact  I hope Madam the Care which I have shewn on this Occasion for the good of my Family will recommend me again to the Favour of a Lady who hath always exerted so much Zeal for the Honour and true Interest of us all and that it may be a Means of restoring me to your Friendship which hath made so great a Part of my former and is so necessary to my future Happiness I am  With the utmost Respect  Honoured Madam  Your most dutiful obliged Neice And most Obedient Humble Servant  Harriet Fitzpatrick  Mrs  Western  was now at her Brother's House where she had resided ever since the Flight of  Sophia  order to administer Comfort to the poor Squire in  is Affliction Of this Comfort which she doled out  him in daily Portions we have formerly given a  pecimen  She was now standing with her Back to the Fire  ad with a Pinch of Snuff in her Hand was dealing  orth this daily Allowance of Comfort to the Squire while he smoaked his Afternoon Pipe when she received the above Letter which she had no sooner  ad than she delivered it to him saying  'There Sir there is an Account of your lost Sheep Fortune hath again restored her to you and if you will be governed by my Advice it is possible you may preserve her yet'  The Squire had no sooner read the Letter than he  aped from his Chair threw his Pipe into the Fire  d gave a loud Huzza for Joy He then summoned  Servants called for his Boots and ordered the  evalier and several other Horses to be saddled and  at Parson  Supple  should be immediately sent for  Having done this he turned to his Sister caught her in his Arms and gave her a close Embrace saying  'Zounds you don't seem pleased one would imagine you was sorry I have found the Girl'  'Brother answered she the deepest Politicians who see to the Bottom discover often a very different Aspect of Affairs from what swims on the Surface It is true indeed Things do look rather less desperate than they did formerly in  Holland  when  Lewis  the fourteenth was at the Gates of  Amsterdam  but there is a Delicacy required in this Matter which you will pardon me Brother if  suspect you want There is a Decorum to he used with a Woman of Figure such as Lady  Bellaston  Brother which requires a Knowledge of the World superior I am afraid to yours'  'Sister cries the Squire I know you have no Opinion of my Parts but I'll shew you on this Occasion who is Fool Knowledge quotha I have not been in the Country so long without having some Knowledge of Warrants and the Law of the Land I know I may take my own wherever can find it Shew me my own Daughter and if don't know how to come at her I'll suffer you to call me Fool as long as I live There be Justices o  Peace in  London  as well as in other Places'  'I protest cries she you make me tremble forth Event of this Matter which if you will proceed b  my Advice you may bring to so good an Issue  Do you really imagine Brother that the House o  a Woman of Figure is to be attacked by Warran  and brutal Justices of the Peace I will inform yo  how to proceed As soon as you arrive in Tow  and have got yourself into a decent Dress for in+deed Brother you have none at present sit to ap+pear in you must send your Compliments to Lad  Bellaston  and desire Leave to wait on her Wh  you are admitted to her Presence as you certainly will be and have told her your Story and have made proper Use of my Name for I think you only just know one another by Sight though you are Relations I am confident she will withdraw her Protection from my Niece who hath certainly imposed upon her This is the only MethodJustices of the Peace indeed do you imagine any such Event can arrive to a Woman of Figure in a civilized Nation'  'Dn their Figures cries the Squire a pretty civilized Nation truly where Women are above the Law And what must I stand sending a Parcel of Compliments to a confounded Whore that keeps away a Daughter from her own natural Father I tell you Sister I am not so ignorant as you think meI know you would have Women above the Law but it is all a Lie I heard his Lordship say at 'Size that no one is above the Law But this of yours is  Hannover  Law I suppose'  'Mr  Western  said she I think you daily improve in IgnoranceI protest you are grown an errant Bear'  'No more a Bear than yourself Sister  Western  said the SquirePox you may talk of your Civility an you will I am sure you never shew any to me I am no Bear no nor no Dog neither though I know Somebody that is something that begins with a B but Pox I will shew you I have a got more good Manners than some Folks'  'Mr  Western  answered the Lady you may say what you please  Je vous mesprise de tout mon Coeur  I shall not therefore be angryBesides as my Cousin with that odious  Irish  Name justly says I have that Regard for the Honour and true Interest of my Family and that concern for my Niece who is a part of it that I have resolved to go to Town myself upon this Occasion for indeed indeed  Brother you are not a fit Minister to be employed at a polite Court  Greenland  Greenland  should always be the Scene of the Tramontane Negotiation'  'I thank Heaven cries the Squire I don't understand you now You are got to your  Hannoverian  Linguo However I'll shew you I scorn to be behindhand in Civility with you and as you are not angry for what I have said so I am not angry for what you have said Indeed I have always thought it a Folly for Relations to quarrel and if they do now and then give a hasty Word why People should give and take for my Part I never bear Malice▪ and I take it very kind of you to go up to  London  for I never was there but twice in my Life and then I did not stay above a Fortnight at a Time and to be sure I can't be expected to know much of the Streets and the Folks in that Time I never denied that you known'd all these Matters better than I For me to dispute that would be all as one as fo  you to dispute the Management of a Pack of Dogs or the finding a Hare sitting with meWhich promise you says she I never willWell and promise you returned he that I never will dispute the t'other'  Here then a League was struck to borrow a Phras  from the Lady between the contending Parties an  now the Parson arriving and the Horses being ready the Squire departed having promised his Sister to fol+low her Advice and she prepared to follow him th  next Day  But having communicated these Matters to the Par+son on the Road they both agreed that the prescribe Formalities might very well be dispensed with an  the Squire having changed his Mind proceeded in th  Manner we have already seen  CHAP VII  In which various Misfortunes befal poor  Jones  AFFAIRS were in the aforesaid Situation when Mrs  Honour  arrrived at Mrs  Miller'  s and called  Jones  out from the Company as we have before seen with whom when she found herself alone she began as follows  'O my dear Sir how shall I get Spirits to tell you you are undone Sir and my poor Lady's undone and I am undone'  'Hath any thing happened to  Sophia  '  cries  Jones  staring like a Madman  'All that is bad cries  Honour  O I shall never get such another Lady O that I should ever live to see this Day'  At these Words  Jones  turned pale as Ashes rembled and stammered but  Honour  went on  'O Mr  Jones  I have lost my Lady for ever'  'How What for Heaven's Sake tell meO my dear  Sophia    'You may well call her so said  Honour  she was the dearest Lady to meI shall never have such another Place'    'Dn your Place'  ries  Jones  'where is what what is become of my  Sophia'  'Ay to be sure cries she Servants may be dn'd It signifies nothing what becomes of them tho' they are turned away and ruined ever so much To be sure they are not Flesh and Blood like other People No to be sure it signifies nothing what becomes of them    'If you have any Pity any Compassion cries  Jones  I beg you will instantly tell me what hath happened to  Sophia  '  'To be sure I have more Pity for you than you have for me answered  Honour  I don't dn you because you have lost the sweetest Lady in the World To be sure you are worthy to be pitied and I am worthy to be pitied too For to be sure if ever there was a good Mistress'    'What hath happened'  cries  Jones  in almost a raving Fit  'WhatWhat said  Honour  'why the worst that could have happened  both for you and for meHer Father is come to Town and hath carried her away from us both'  Here  Jones  fell on his Knees in Thanksgiving that it was no worse  'No worse repeated  Honour  what could be worse for either of us He carried her off swearing she should marry Mr  Blifil  that's for your Comfort and for poor me I am turned out of Doors'  'Indeed Mrs  Honour  answered  Jones  you frightned me out of my Wits I imagined some most dreadfuled sudden Accident had happened to  Sophia  something compared to which even the seeing her married to  Blifil  would be a Trifle but while there is Life there are Hopes my dear  Honour  Women in this Land of Liberty cannot be married by actual brutal Force'  'To be sure Sir said she 'that's true There may be some Hopes for you but alackaday what Hopes are there for poor me And to be sure Sir you must be sensible I suffer all this upon your Account All the Quarrel the Squire hath to me is for taking your Part as I have done against Mr  Blifil'  'Indeed Mrs  Honour  answered he 'I am sensible of my Obligations to you and will leave nothing in my Power undone to make you amends'  'Alas Sir said she what can make a Servant amends for the Loss of one Place but the getting another altogether as good'    'Do not despair Mrs  Honour  said  Jones  'I hope to reinstate you again in the same'  'Alackaday Sir said she how can I flatter myself with such Hopes when I know it is a Thing impossible for the Squire is so set against me and yet if you should ever have my Lady as to be sure I now hopes heartily you will for you are a generous good natured Gentleman and I am sure you loves her and to be sure she loves you as dearly as her own Soul it is a Matter in vain to deny it because as why every Body that is in the least acquainted with my Lady must see it for poor  dear Lady she can't dissemble and if two People who loves one another a'n't happy why who should be so Happiness don't always depend upon what People has besides my Lady has enough for both To be sure therefore as one may say it would be all the Pity in the World to keep two such Loviers asunder nay I am convinced for my Part you will meet together at last for if it is to be there is no preventing it If a Marriage is made in Heaven all the Justices of Peace upon Earth can't break it off To be sure I wishes that Parson  Supple  had but a little more Spirit to tell the Squire of his Wickedness in endeavouring to force his Daughter contrary to her Liking but then his whole Dependance is on the Squire and so the poor Gentleman though he is a very religious good sort of Man and talks of the Badness of such Doings behind the Squire's Back yet he dares not say his Soul is his own to his Face To be sure I never saw him make so bold as just now I was afeard the Squire would have struck himI would not have your Honour be melancholy Sir nor dispair Things may go better as long as you are sure of my Lady and that I am certain you may be for she never will be brought to consent to marry any other Man Indeed I am terribly afeard the Squire will do her a Mischief in his Passion For he is a prodigious passionate Gentleman and I am afeard too the poor Lady will be brought to break her Heart for she is as tenderhearted as a Chicken it is pity methinks she had not a little of my Courage If I was in Love with a young Man and my Father offered to lock me up I'd tear his Eyes out but I'd come at him but then there's a great Fortune in the Case which it is in her Father's Power either to give her or not that to be sure may make some Difference'  Whether  Jones  gave strict Attention to all the foregoing Harangue or whether it was for want of any  Vacancy in the Discourse I cannot determine but he never once attempted to answer nor did she once stop till  Partridge  came running into the Room and informed him that the great Lady was upon the Stairs  Nothing could equal the Dilemma to which  Jones  was now reduced  Honour  knew nothing of any Acquaintance that subsisted between him and Lady  Bellaston  and she was almost the last Person in the World to whom he would have communicated it In this Hurry and Distress he took as is common enough the worst Course and instead of exposing her to the Lady which would have been of little Consequence he chose to expose the Lady to her he therefore resolved to hide  Honour  whom he had but just time to convey behind the Bed and to draw the Curtains  The Hurry in which  Jones  had been all Day engaged on Account of his poor Landlady and her Family the Terrors occasioned by Mrs  Honour  and the Confusion into which he was thrown by the sudden Arrival of Lady  Bellaston  had altogether driven former Thoughts out of his Head so that it never once occurr'd to his Memory to act the Part of a sick Man which indeed neither the Gayety of his Dress nor the Freshness of his Countenance would have at all supported  He received her Ladyship therefore rather agreeably to her Desires than to her Expectations with all the good Humour he could muster in his Countenance and without any real or affected Appearance of the least Disorder  Lady  Bellaston  no sooner entered the Room than she squatted herself down on the Bed  'So my dear  Jones'  said she you find nothing can detain me long from you Perhaps I ought to be angry with you that I have neither seen nor heard from you all Day for I perceive your Distemper would have suffered you to come abroad Nay I suppose you have not sat in your Chamber all Day drest up  like a fine Lady to see Company after a Lyingin but however don't think I intend to scold you For I never will give you an Excuse for the cold Behaviour of a Husband by putting on the ill Humour of a Wife'  'Nay Lady  Bellaston'  said  Jones  'I am sure your Ladyship will not upbraid me with neglect of Duty when I only waited for Orders Who my dear Creature hath Reason to complain Who missed an Appointment last Night and left an unhappy Man to expect and wish and sigh and languish'  'Do not mention it my dear Mr  Jones'  cries she 'If you knew the Occasion you would pity me In short it is impossible to conceive what Women of Condition are obliged to suffer from the Impertinence of Fools in order to keep up the Farce of the World I am glad however all your languishing and wishing have done you no harm for you never looked better in your Life Upon my Faith  Jones  you might at this Instant sit for the Picture of  Adonis'  There are certain Words of Provocation which  en of Honour hold can only properly be answered  y a Blow Among Lovers possibly there may be  ome Expressions which can only be answered by a Kiss The Compliment which Lady  Bellaston  now made  Jones  seems to be of this Kind especially as  t was attended with a Look in which the Lady con  eyed more soft Ideas than it was possible to express with her Tongue  Jones  was certainly at this Instant in one of the most disagreeable and distrest situations imaginable  or to carry on the Comparison we made use of be  ore tho' the Provocation was given by the Lady  ones  could not receive Satisfaction nor so much as  ffer to ask it in the Presence of a third Person Seconds in this kind of Duels not being according to  the Law of Arms As this Objection did not occur to Lady  Bellaston  who was ignorant of any other Woman being there but herself she waited some time in great Astonishment for an Answer from  Jones  who conscious of the ridiculous Figure he made stood at a Distance and not daring to give the proper Answer gave none at all Nothing can be imagined more comic nor yet more tragical than this Scene would have been if it had lasted much longer The Lady had already changed Colour two or three times had got up from the Bed and sat down again while  Jones  was wishing the Ground to sink under him or the House to fall on his Head when an odd Accident freed him from an Embarassment out of which neither the Eloquence of  Cicero  nor the Politicks of a  Machiavel  could have delivered him without utter Disgrace  This was no other than the Arrival of young  Nightingale  dead drunk or rather in that State of Drunkenness which deprives Men of the Use of their Reason without depriving them of the Use of their Limbs  Mrs  Miller  and her Daughters were in Bed and  Partridge  was smoaking his Pipe by the Kitchen Fire so that he arrived at Mr  Jones'  s Chamber Door with+out any Interruption This he burst open and was entering without any Ceremony when  Jones  started from his Seat and ran to oppose him which he did so effectually that  Nightingale  never came far enough within the Door to see who was sitting on the Bed  Nightingale  had in Reality mistaken  Jones'  s Apart+ment for that in which himself had lodged he there+fore strongly insisted on coming in often swearing that he would not be kept from his own Bed  Jones  however prevailed over him and delivered him in to the Hands of  Partridge  whom the Noise on th  Stairs soon summoned to his Master's Assistance  And now  Jones  was unwillingly obliged to return to his own Apartment where at the very Instant of his Entrance he heard Lady  Bellaston  venting an Exclamation though not a very loud one and at the same time saw her flinging herself into a Chair in a vast Agitation which in a Lady of a tender Constitution would have been an Hysteric Fit  In reality the Lady frightened with the Struggle between the two Men of which she did not know what would be the Issue as she heard  Nightingale  swear many Oaths he would come to his own Bed attempted to retire to her known Place of Hiding which to her great Confusion she found already occupied by another  'Is this Usage to be borne Mr  Jones'  cries the Lady 'basest of MenWhat Wretch is this to whom you have exposed me'  'Wretch' cries  Honour  bursting in a violent Rage from her Place of Concealment'marry come up'Wretch forsoothAs poor a Wretch as I am I am honest that is more than some Folks who are richer can say'  Jones  instead of applying himself directly to take off the Edge of Mrs  Honour'  s Resentment as a more experienced Gallant would have done fell to cursing his Stars and lamenting himself as the most unfortunate Man in the World and presently after addresing himself to Lady  Bellaston  he fell to some very absurd Protestations of Innocence By this time the Lady having recovered the Use of her Reason which he had as ready as any Woman in the World especially on such Occasions calmly replied  'Sir you need make no Apologies I see now who the Person is I did not at first know Mrs  Honour  but now I do I can suspect nothing wrong between her and you and I am sure she is a Woman of too good Sense to put any wrong Constructions upon my Visits to you I have been always her Friend  and it may be in my Power to be much more so hereafter'  Mrs  Honour  was altogether as placable as she was passionate Hearing therefore Lady  Bellaston  assume the soft Tone she likewise softened her's 'I'm sure Madam' said she  'I have been always ready to acknowledge your Ladyship's Friendships to me sure I never had so good a Friend as your Ladyshipand to be sure now I see it is your Ladyship that I spoke to I could almost bite my Tongue off for very madI Constructions upon your Ladyshipto be sure it doth not become a Servant as I am to think about such a great LadyI mean I was a Servant for indeed I am no Body's Servant now the more miserable Wretch is meI have lost the best Mistress'  Here  Honour  thought fit to produce a Shower of Tears '  'Don't cry Child' says the good Lady 'Ways perhaps my be found to make you amends Come to me tomorrow Morning'  She then took up her Fan which lay on the Ground and without even looking at  Jones  walked very majestically out of the Room there being a kind of Dignity in the Impudence of Women of Quality which their Inferiors vainly aspire to attain to in Circumstances of this Nature  Jones  followed her down Stairs often offering her his Hand which she absolutely refused him and go  into her Chair without taking any Notice of him as he stood bowing before her  At his Return up Stairs a long Dialogue past between him and Mrs  Honour  while she was adjusting herself after the Discomposure she had undergone The Subject of this was his Infidelity to her young Lady on which she enlarged with great Bitterness but  Jones  at last found means to reconcile her and not only so but to obtain a Promise of most inviolable Secrecy and that she would the next Morning endeavour  to find out  Sophia  and bring him a further Account of the Proceedings of the Squire  Thus ended this unfortunate Adventure to the Satisfaction only of Mrs  Honour  for a Secret as some of my Readers will perhaps acknowledge from Experience is often a very valuable Possession and  hat not only to those who faithfully keep it but sometimes to such as whisper it about till it comes to  he Ears of every one except the ignorant Person who pays for the supposed concealing of what is publickly known  CHAP VIII  Short and sweet  NOTWITHSTANDING all the Obligations she had received from  Jones  Mrs  Miller  could  ot forbear in the Morning some gentle Remonstrances for the Hurricain which had happened the preceding Night in his Chamber These were however so gen  le and so friendly professing and indeed truly to  im at nothing more than the real good of Mr  Jones  himself that he far from being offended thankfully  eceived the Admonition of the good Woman ex  ressed much Concern for what had past excused it  s well as he could and promised never more to bring he same Disturbances into the House  But though Mrs  Miller  did not refrain from a  hort Expostulation in private at their first meeting  et the Occasion of his being summoned down Stairs  hat Morning was of a much more agreeable Kind  eing indeed to perform the Office of a Father to Miss  Nancy  and to give her in Wedlock to Mr  Nightingale  who was now ready drest and full as sober  s many of my Readers will think a Man ought to  e who receives a Wife in so imprudent a Man  er  And here perhaps it may be proper to account for the Escape which this young Gentleman had made from his Uncle and for his Appearance in the Condition in which we have seen him the Night before  Now when the Uncle had arrived at his Lodgings with his Nephew partly to indulge his own Inclinations for he dearly loved his Bottle and partly to disqualify his Nephew from the immediate Execution of his Purpose he ordered Wine to be set on the Table with which he so briskly ply'd the young Gentleman that this latter who though not much used to Drinking did not detest it so as to be guilty of Disobedience or of want of Complaisance by refusing was soon completely finished  Just as the Uncle had obtained this Victory and was preparing a Bed for his Nephew a Messenger arrived with a Piece of News which so entirely disconcerted and shocked him that he in a Moment lost all Consideration for his Nephew and his whole Mind became entirely taken up with his own Concerns  This sudden and afflicting News was no less than that his Daughter had taken the Opportunity of almost the first Moment of his Absence and had gone off with a Neighbouring young Clergyman against whom tho' her Father could have had but one Objection namely that he was worth nothing yet she had never thought proper to communicate her Amoun  even to that Father and so artfully she managed that it had never been once suspected by any till now that it was consummated  Old Mr  Nightingale  no sooner received this Account than in the utmost Confusion he ordered a PostChaise to be instantly got ready and having recommended his Nephew to the Care of a Servant he directly left the House scarce knowing what he did nor whither he went  The Uncle being thus departed when the Servant came to attend the Nephew to Bed had waked him for that Purpose and had at last made him sensible that his Uncle was gone he instead of accepting the kind Offices tendered him insisted on a Chair being called with this the Servant who had received no strict Orders to the contrary readily complied and thus being conducted back to the House of Mrs  Miller  he had staggered up to Mr  Jones'  s Chamber as hath been before recounted  This Bar of the Uncle being now removed though young  Nightingale  knew not as yet in what Manner and all Parties being quickly ready the Mother Mr  Jones  Mr  Nightingale  and his Love stept into a HackneyCoach which conveyed him to Doctor's Commons where Miss  Nancy  was in vulgar Language soon made an honest Woman and the poor Mother became in the purest Sense of the Word one of the happiest of all human Beings  And now Mr  Jones  having seen his good Offices to that poor Woman and her Family brought to a happy Conclusion began to apply himself to his own Concerns but here lest many of my Readers should censure his Folly for thus troubling himself with the Affairs of others and lest some few should think he acted more disinterestedly than indeed he did we think proper to assure our Reader that he was so far from being unconcerned in this Matter that he had  ndeed a very considerable Interest in bringing it to that final Consummation  To explain this seeming Paradox at once he was one who could truly say with him in  Terence Homo sum Nihil humani a me alienum puto  He was never an  ndifferent Spectator of the Misery or Happiness of  ny one and he felt either the one or the other in greater Proportion as he himself contributed to either He could not therefore be the Instrument of raising a whole Family from the lowest State of  Wretchedness to the highest Pitch of Joy without conveying great Felicity to himself more perhaps than worldly Men often purchase to themselves by undergoing the most severe Labour and often by wading through the deepest Iniquity  Those Readers who are of the same Complexion with him will perhaps think this short Chapter contains abundance of Matter while others may probably wish short as it is that it had been totally spared as impertinent to the main Design which I suppose they conclude is to bring Mr  Jones  to the Gallows or if possible to a more deplorable Catastrophe  CHAP IX  Containing LoveLetters of several Sorts  MR  Jones  at his Return Home found the fellowing Letters lying on his Table which he luckily opened in the Order they were sent  LETTER I  Surely I am under some strange Infatuation I cannot keep my Resolutions a Moment however strongly made or justly founded Last Night I resolved never to see you more this Morning I am willing to hear if you can as you say clear up this Affair And yet I know that to be impossible I have said every Thing to myself which you can inventPerhaps not Perhaps your Invention is stronger Come to me therefore the Moment you receive this If you can forge an Excuse I almost promise you to believe it Betrayed toI will think no moreCome to me directlyThis is the third Letter I have writ the two for+mer are burntI am almost inclined to burn thi  tooI wish I preserve my SensesCome to me presently  LETTER II  If you ever expect to be forgiven or even suffered within my Doors come to me this instant  LETTER III  I now find you was not at Home when my Notes came to your Lodgings The Moment you receive this let me see youI shall not stir out nor shall any Body be let in but yourself Sure nothing can detain you long  Jones  had just read over these three Billets when Mr  Nightingale  came into the Room  'Well  Tom'  said he 'any News from Lady  Bellaston  after last Night's Adventure'  for it was now no Secret to any one in that House who the Lady was  'The Lady  Bellaston  answered  Jones  very gravely  'Nay dear  Tom  ' cries  Nightingale  'don't be so reserved to your Friends Though I was too drunk to see her last Night I saw her at the Masquerade Do you think I am ignorant who the Queen of the Fairies is'  'And did you really then know the Lady at the Masquerade'  said  Jones  'Yes upon my Soul did I' said  Nightingale  'and have given you twenty Hints of it since though you seemed always so tender on that Point that I wou'd not speak plainly I fancy my Friend by your extreme Nicety in this Matter you are not so well acquainted with the Character of the Lady as with her Person Don't be angry  Tom  but upon my Honour you are not the first young Fellow she hath debauched Her Reputation is in no Danger believe me'  Though  Jones  had no Reason to imagine the Lady  o have been of the vestal Kind when his Amour began  yet as he was thoroughly ignorant of the Town and had very little Acquaintance in it he had yet no Knowledge of that Character which is vulgarly called a Demirep that is to say a Woman that intrigues 'with every Man she likes under the Name and Appearance of Virtue and who though some overnice Ladies will not be seen with her is visited as they term it by the whole Town in short whom every Body knows to be what no Body calls her  When he found therefore that  Nightingale  was perfectly acquainted with his Intrigue and began to suspect that so scrupulous a Delicacy as he had hitherto observed was not quite necessary on the Occasion he gave a Latitude to his Friend's Tongue and desired him to speak plainly what he knew on had ever heard of the Lady  Nightingale  who in many other Instances wa  rather too effeminate in his Disposition had a pretty strong Inclination to Tittle Tattle He had no sooner therefore received a full Liberty of speaking from  Jones  than he entered upon a long Narrative concerning the Lady which as it contained many Particulars highly to her Dishonour we have to  great a Tenderness for all Women of Condition to repeat we would cautiously avoid giving an Oppor+tunity to the future Commentators on our Works of making any malicious Application and of forc+ing us to be against our Will the Author of Scandal which never entered into our Head  Jones  having very attentively heard all that  Night+ingale  had to say fetched a deep Sigh which th  other observing cried  'Heyday Why thou a  not in Love I Hope Had I imagined my Storie  would have affected you I promise you should ne+ver have heard them'  'O my dear Friend' crie  Jones  'I am so entangled with this Woman that know not how to extricate myself' 'In Love in+deed No my Friend but I am under Obliga+  tions to her and very great ones Since you know so much I will be very explicit with you It is owing perhaps solely to her that I have not before this wanted a Bit of Bread How can I possibly desert such a Woman And yet I must desert her or be guilty of the blackest Treachery to one who deserves infinitely better of me than she can A Woman my  Nightingale  for whom I have a Passion which few can have an Idea of I am half distracted with doubts how to act'  'And is this other pray an honourable Mistress'  cries  Nightingale  'Honourable' answered  Jones  'No Breath ever yet durst sully her Reputation The sweetest Air is not purer the limpid Stream not clearer than her Honour She is all over both in Mind and Body consummate Perfection She is the most beautiful Creature in the Universe and yet she is Mistress of such noble elevated Qualities that though she is never from my Thoughts I scarce ever think of her Beauty but when I see it'  'And can you my good Friend cries  Nightingale  'with such an Engagement as this upon your Hands hesitate a Moment about quitting such a'  'Hold said  Jones  'no more Abuse of her I detest the Thoughts of Ingratitude'  'Pooh answered the other 'you are not the first upon whom she hath conferred Obligations of this Kind She is remarkably liberal where she likes though let me tell you her Favours are so prudently bestowed that they should rather raise a Man's Vanity than his Gratitude'  In short  Nightingale  proceeded so far on this Head and told his Friend so many Stories of the Lady which he swore to the Truth of that he entirely removed all Esteem for her from the Breast of  Jones  and his Gratitude was lessened in Proportion Indeed he began to look on all the Favours he had received rather as Wages than Benefits which not only depreciated  her but himself too in his own Conceit and put him quite out of Humour with both From this Disgust his Mind by a natural Transition turned towards  Sophia  Her Virtue her Purity her Love to him her Sufferings on his Account filled all his Thoughts and made his Commerce with Lady  Bellaston  appear still more odious The Result of all was that though his turning himself out of her  Service  in which Light he now saw his Affair with her would be the Loss of his Bread yet he determined to quit her if he could but find a handsome Pretence which having communicated to his Friend  Nightingale  considered a little and then said  'I have it my Boy I have found out a sure Method Propose Marriage to her and I would venture Hanging upon the Success'  'Marriage' cries  Jones  Ay propose Marriage' answered  Nightingale  'and she will declare off in a Moment I knew a young Fellow whom she kept formerly who made the Offer to her in earnest and was presently turned off for his Pains'  Jones  declared he could not venture the Experiment  'Perhaps' said he 'she may be less shocked at this Proposal from one Man than from another And if she should take me at my Word where am I then Caught in my own Trap and undone for ever'  'No' answered  Nightingale  'not if I can give you an Expedient by which you may at any Time get out of the Trap'    'What Expedient can that be'  replied  Jones  'This answered  Nightingale  'The young Fellow I mentioned who is one of the most intimate Acquaintances I have in the World is so angry with her for some ill Offices she hath since done him that I am sure he would without any Difficulty give you a Sight of her Letters upon which you may decently break with her and declare off before  the Knot is ty'd if she should really be willing to tie it which I am convinced she will not'  After some Hesitation  Jones  upon the Strength of this Assurance consented but as he swore he wanted the Confidence to propose the Matter to her Face he wrote the following Letter which  Nightingale  dictated  Madam  I am extremely concerned that by an unfortunate Engagement abroad I should have missed receiving the Honour of your Ladyship's Commands the Moment they came and the Delay which I must now suffer of vindicating myself to your Ladyship greatly adds to this Misfortune O Lady  Bellaston  what a Terror have I been in for Fear your Reputation should be exposed by these perverse Accidents There is one only Way to secure it I need not name what that is Only permit me to say that as your Honour is as dear to me as my own so my sole Ambition is to have the Glory of laying my Liberty at your Feet and believe me when I assure you I can never be made completely happy without you generously bestow on me a legal Right of calling you mine for ever I am  Madam  With most profound Respect Your Ladyship's most obliged Obedient Humble Servant Thomas Jones  To this she presently returned the following Answer  Sir  When I read over your serious Epistle I could from its Coldness and Formality have sworn that you had already the legal Right you mention nay that we had for many Years composed that monstrous Animal a Husband and a Wife Do you  really then imagine me a Fool Or do you fancy yourself capable of so entirely persuading me out of my Senses that I should deliver my whole Fortune into your Power in order to enable you to support your Pleasures at my Expence Are these the Proofs of Love which I expected Is this the Return forbut I scorn to upbraid you and am in great Admiration of your profound Respect  P S  I am prevented from revisingPerhaps I have said more than I meantCome to me at Eight this Evening  Jones  by the Advice of his PrivyCouncil reply'd  Madam  It is impossible to express how much I am shocked at the Suspicion you entertain of me Can Lady  Bellaston  have conferred Favours on a Man whom she could believe capable of so base a Design Or can she treat the most solemn Tie of Love with Contempt Can you imagine Madam that if the Violence of my Passion in an unguarded Moment overcame the Tenderness which I have for your Honour I would think of indulging myself in the Continuance of an Intercourse which could not possibly escape long the Notice of the World and which when discovered must prove so fatal to your Reputation If such be your Opinion of me I must pray for a sudden Opportunity of returning those pecuniary Obligations which I have been so unfortunate to receive at your Hands and for those of a more tender Kind I shall ever remain  c  And so concluded in the very Words with which he had concluded the former Letter  The Lady answered as follows  I see you are a Villain and I despise you from my Soul If you come here I shall not be at Home  Though  Jones  was well satisfied with his Deliverance from a Thraldom which those who have ever experienced it will I apprehend allow to be none of the lightest he was not however perfectly easy in his Mind There was in this Scheme too much of Fallacy to satisfy one who utterly detested every Species of Falshood or Dishonesty Nor would he indeed have submitted to put it in Practice had he not been involved in a distressful Situation where he was obliged to be guilty of some Dishonour either to the one Lady or the other and surely the Reader will allow that every good Principle as well as Love pleaded strongly in Favour of  Sophia  Nightingale  highly exulted in the Success of his Stratagem upon which he received many Thanks and much Applause from his Friend He answered  'Dear  Tom  we have conferred very different Obligations on each other To me you owe the regaining your Liberty to you I owe the Loss of mine But if you are as happy in the one Instance as I am in the other I promise you we are the two happiest Fellows in  England  '  The two Gentlemen were now summoned down to Dinner where Mrs  Miller  who performed herself the Office of Cook had exerted her best Talents to celebrate the Wedding of her Daughter This joyful Circumstance she ascribed principally to the friendly behaviour of  Jones  her whole Soul was fired with Gratitude towards him and all her Looks Words and Actions were so busied in expressing it that her Daughter and even her new SoninLaw were very little the Objects of her Consideration  Dinner was just ended when Mrs  Miller  received a Letter but as we had Letters enough in this Chapter we shall communicate the Contents in our next  CHAP X  Consisting partly of Facts and partly of Observations upon them  THE Letter then which arrived at the End of the preceding Chapter was from Mr  Allworthy  and the Purport of it was his Intention to come immediately to Town with his Nephew  Blifil  and a Desire to be accommodated with his usual Lodgings which were the first Floor for himself and the second for his Nephew  The Chearfulness which had before display'd itself in the Countenance of the poor Woman was a little clouded on this Occasion This News did indeed a good deal disconcert her To requite so disinterested a Match with her Daughter by presently turning her new SoninLaw out of Doors appeared to her very unjustifiable on the one Hand and on the other she could scarce bear the Thoughts of making any Excuse to Mr  Allworthy  after all the Obligations received from him for depriving him of Lodgings which were indeed strictly his Due For that Gentleman in conferring all his numberless Benefits on others acted by a Rule diametrically opposite to what is practised by most generous People He contrived on all Occasions to hide his Beneficence not only from the World but even from the Object of it He constantly used the Words Lend and Pay instead of Give and by every other Method he could invent always lessened the Favours he conferred with his Tongue while he was heaping them with both his Hands When he settled the Annuity of  l  a Year therefore on Mrs  Miller  he told her  'It was in Consideration of always having her FirstFloor when he was in Town'  which he scarce ever intended to be  'but that she might let it at any other Time for that he would always send her a Month's  Warning'  He was now however hurried to Town so suddenly that he had no Opportunity of giving such Notice and this Hurry probably prevented him when he wrote for his Lodgings adding  if they were then empty  For he would most certainly have been well satisfied to have relinquished them on a less sufficient Excuse than what Mrs  Miller  could now have made  But there are a Sort of Persons who as  Prior  excellently well remarks direct their Conduct by something  Beyond the fix'd and settled Rules  Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools  Beyond the Letter of the Law  To these it is so far from being sufficient that their Defence would acquit them at the  OldBailey  that they are not even contented though Conscience the severest of all Judges should discharge them Nothing short of the Fair and Honourable will satisfy the Delicacy of their Minds and if any of their Actions fall short of this Mark they mope and pine are as uneasy and restless as a Murderer who is afraid of a Ghost or of the Hangman  Mrs  Miller  was one of these She could not conceal her Uneasiness at this Letter with the Contents of which she had no sooner acquainted the Company and given some Hints of her Distress than  Jones  her good Angel presently relieved her Anxiety  'As for myself Madam' said he 'my Lodging is at your Service at a Moment's Warning and Mr  Nightingale  I am sure as he cannot yet prepare a House fit to receive his Lady will consent to return to his new Lodging whither Mrs  Nightingale  will certainly consent to go  With which Proposal both Husband and Wife instantly agreed  The Reader will easily believe that the Cheeks of Mrs  Miller  began again to glow with additional Gratitude to  Jones  but perhaps it may be more difficult  to persuade him that Mr  Jones  having in his last Speech called her Daughter Mrs  Nightingale  it being the first Time that agreeable Sound had ever reached her Ears gave the fond Mother more Satisfaction and warmed her Heart more towards  Jones  than his having dissipated her present Anxiety  The next Day was then appointed for the Removal of the newmarried Couple and of Mr  Jones  who was likewise to be provided for in the same House with his Friend And now the Serenity of the Company was again restored and they past the Day in the utmost Chearfulness all except  Jones  who though he outwardly accompanied the rest in their Mirth felt many a bitter Pang on the Account of his  Sophia  which were not a little heightened by the News of Mr  Blifil'  s coming to Town for he clearly saw the Intention of his Journey And what greatly aggravated his Concern was that Mrs  Honour  who had promised to enquire after  Sophia  and to make her Report to him early the next Evening had disappointed him  In the Situation that he and his Mistress were a  this Time there were scarce any Grounds for him to hope that he should hear any good News yet he was as impatient to see Mrs  Honour  as if he had expected she would bring him a Letter with an Assigna+tion in it from  Sophia  and bore the Disappointment a  ill Whether this Impatience arose from that natura  Weakness of the Human Mind which makes it desirous to know the worst and renders Uncertainty th  most intolerable of Pains or whether he still flattered himself with some secret Hopes we will not deter+mine But that it might be the last whoever ha  loved cannot but know For of all the Powers exer+cised by this Passion over our Minds one of the mo  wonderful is that of supporting Hope in the midst o  Despair Difficulties Improbabilities nay  Impossibilities are quite overlook'd by it so that to any Man extremely in Love may be applied what  Addison  says of  Caesar  The  Alps  and  Pyrenaeans  sink before him  Yet it is equally true that the same Passion will sometimes make Mountans of Molehills and produce Despair in the midst of Hope but these cold Fits last not  ong in good Constitutions Which Temper  Jones  was  ow in we leave the Reader to guess having no ex  act Information about it but this is certain that he had spent two Hours in Expectation when being unable any longer to conceal his Uneasiness he retired to his Room where his Anxiety had almost made him frantick when the following Letter was brought him from Mrs  Honour  with which we shall present the Reader  verbatim literatim  SIR  I shud sartenly haf kaled on you a cordin too mi Prommiss haddunt itt bin that hur Lashipp prevent mee for too bee sur Sir you nose very wel that evere

Sir  Ure Onur's umble Sarvant To Cumand till Deth Honour Blackmore  Various are the Conjectures which  Jones  entertained on this Step of Lady  Bellaston  who in reality had little further Design than to secure within her own House the Repository of a Secret which she chose should make no farther Progress than it had made already but mostly she desired to keep it from the Ears of  Sophia  for tho' that young Lady was almost the only one who would never have repeated it again her Ladyship could not persuade herself of this since as she now hated poor  Sophia  with most implacable Hatred she conceived a reciprocal Hatred to herself to be lodged in the tender Breast of our Heroine where no such Passion had ever yet found an Entrance  While  Jones  was terrifying himself with the Apprehension of a thousand dreadful Machinations and deep political Designs which he imagined to be at the  Bottom of the Promotion of  Honour  Fortune who hitherto seems to have been an utter Enemy to his Match with  Sophia  try'd a new Method to put a final End to it by throwing a Temptation in his Way which in his present desperate Situation it seemed unlikely he should be able to resist  CHAP XI  Containing curious but not unprecedented Matter  THERE was a Lady one Mrs  Hunt  who had often seen  Jones  at the House where he lodged being intimately acquainted with the Women there and indeed a very great Friend to Mrs  Miller  Her Age was about thirty for she owned six and twenty her Face and Person very good only inclining a little too much to be fat She had been married young by her Relations to an old  Turkey  Merchant who having got a great Fortune had left off Trade With him she lived without Reproach but not without Pain in a State of great Self denial for about twelve Years and her Virtue was rewarded by his dying and leaving her very rich The first Year of her Widowhood was just at an End and she had past it in a good deal of Retirement seeing only a few particular Friends and dividing her Time between her Devotions and Novels of which she was always extremely fond Very good Health a very warm Constitution and a great deal of Religion made it absolutely necessary for her to marry again and she resolved to please herself in her second Husband as she had done her Friends in the first From her the following Billet was brought to  Jones  Sir  From the first Day I saw you I doubt my Eyes have told you too plainly that you were not indifferent to me but neither my Tongue nor my Hand should ever have avowed it had not the Ladies of  the Family where you are lodged given me such a Character of you and told me such Proofs of your Virtue and Goodness as convince me you are not only the most agreeable but the most worthy of Men I have also the Satisfaction to hear from them that neither my Person Understanding or Character are disagreeable to you I have a Fortune sufficient to make us both happy but which cannot make me so without you In thus disposing of myself I know I shall incur the Censure of the World but if I did not love you more than I fear the World I should not be worthy of you One only Difficulty stops me I am informed you are engaged in a Commerce of Gallantry with a Woman of Fashon If you think it worth while to sacrifice that to the Passion of me I am yours if not forget my Weakness and let this remain an eternal Secret between you and  Arabella Hunt  At the reading of this  Jones  was put into a violent Flutter His Fortune was then at a very low Ebb the Source being stopt from which hitherto he had been supplied Of all he had received from Lady  Bellaston  not above five Guineas remained and that very Morning he had been dunned by a Tradesman for twice that Sum His honourable Mistress was in the Hands of her Father and he had scarce any Hopes ever to get her out of them again To be subsisted at her Expence from that little Fortune she had independent of her Father went much against the Delicacy both of his Pride and his Love This Lady's Fortune would have been exceeding convenient to him and he could have no Objection to her in any Respect On the contrary he liked her as well as he did any Woman except  Sophia  But to abandon  Sophia  and marry another that was impossible he could no  think of it upon any Account Yet why should h  not since it was plain she could not be his Would  it not be kinder to her than to continue her longer engaged in a hopeless Passion for him Ought he not to do so in Friendship to her This Notion prevailed some Moments and he had almost determined to be false to her from a high Point of Honour but that Refinement was not able to stand very long against the voice of Nature which cried in his Heart that such Friendship was Treason to Love At last he called for Pen Ink and Paper and writ as follows to Mrs  Hunt  Madam  It would be but a poor Return to the Favour you have done me to sacrifice any Gallantry to the Possession of you and I would certainly do it tho' I were not disengaged as at present I am from any Affair of that Kind But I should not be the honest Man you think me if I did not tell you that my Affections are engaged to another who is a Woman of Virtue and one that I never can leave though it is probable I shall never possess her God forbid that in Return of your Kindness to me I should do you such an Injury as to give you my Hand when I cannot give my Heart No I had much rather starve than be guilty of that Even though my Mistress were married to another I would not marry you unless my Heart had entirely effaced all Impressions of her Be assured that your Secret was not more safe in your own Breast than in that of  Your most obliged and 'Grateful Humble Servant  Tom Jones  When our Heroe had finished and sent this Letter he went to his Scrutore took out Miss  Western'  s Muff kissed it several Times and then strutted some Turns about his Room with more Satisfaction of  Mind than ever any  Irishman  felt in carrying off a Fortune of fifty Thousand Pounds  CHAP XII  A Discovery made by  Partridge  WHILE  Jones  was exulting in the Consciousness of his Integrity  Partridge  came capering into the Room as was his Custom when he brought or fancied he brought any good Tidings He had been dispatched that Morning by his Master with Orders to endeavour by the Servants of Lady  Bellaston  or by any other Means to discover whither  Sophia  had been conveyed and he now returned and with a joyful Countenance told our Heroe that he had found the lost Bird  'I have seen Sir says he black  George  the Gamekeeper who is one of the Servants whom the Squire hath brought with him to Town I knew him presently though I have not seen him these several Years but you know Sir he is a very remarkable Man or to use a purer Phrase he hath a most remarkable Beard the largest and blackest I ever saw It was some Time however before black  George  could recollect me'    'Well but what is your good News cries  Jones  what do you know of my  Sophia'    'You shall know presently Sir answered  Partridge  I am coming to it as fast as I canYou are so impatient Sir you would come to the Infinitive Mood before you can get to the Imperative As I was saying Sir it was some Time before he recollected my Face'    'Confound your Face cries  Jones  what of my  Sophia'    'Nay Sir answered  Partridge  I know nothing more of Madam  Sophia  than what I am going to tell you and I should have told you all before this if you had not interrupted me but if you look so angry at me you will frighten all of out it of my Head or to use a purer  Phrase out of my Memory I never saw you look so angry since the Day we left  Upton  which I shall remember if I was to live a thousand Years'  'Well pray go on in your own Way' said  Jones  'you are resolved to make me mad I find  'Not for the World answered  Partridge  I have suffered enough for that already which as I said I shall bear in my Remembrance the longest Day I have to live'    'Well but black  George  '  cries  Jones  'Well Sir as I was saying it was a long Time before he could recollect me for indeed I am very much altered since I saw him  Non sum qualis eram  I have had Troubles in the World and nothing alters a Man so much as Grief I have heard it will change the Colour of a Man's Hair in a Night However at last know me he did that's sure enough for we were both of an Age and were at the same Charity School  George  was a great Dunce but no Matter for that all Men do not thrive in the World according to their Learning I am sure I have Reason to say so but it will be all one a Thousand Years hence Well Sirwhere was IOwell we no sooner knew each other than after many hearty Shakes by the Hand we agreed to go to an Alehouse and take a Pot and by good Luck the Beer was some of the best I have met with since I have been in TownNow Sir I am coming to the Point for no sooner did I name you and told him that you and I came to Town together and had lived together ever since than he called for another Pot and swore he would drink to your Health and indeed he drank your Health so heartily that I was overjoyed to see there was so much Gratitude left in the World and after we had emptied that Pot I said I would be my Pot too and so we drank another to your Health and then I made haste Home to tell you the News'  'What News cries  Jones  you have not mentioned a Word of my  Sophia'    'Bless me I had like to have forgot that Indeed we mentioned a great deal about young Madam  Western  and  George  told me all that Mr  Blifil  is coming to Town in order to be married to her He had best make haste then says I or some Body will have her before he comes and indeed says I Mr  Seagrim  it is a thousand Pities some Body should not have her for he certainly loves her above all the Women in the World I would have both you and she know that it is not for her Fortune he follows her for I can assure you as to Matter of that there is another Lady of much greater Quality and Fortune than she can pretend to who is so fond of Somebody that she comes after him Day and Night  Here  Jones  fell into a Passion with  Partridge  for having as he said betray'd him but the poor Fellow answered he had mentioned no Name  'Besides Sir said he I can assure you  George  is sincerely your Friend and wished Mr  Bilfil  at the Devil more than once nay he said he would do any Thing in his Power upon Earth to serve you and so I am convinced he willBetray you indeed why I question whether you have a better Friend than  George  upon Earth except myself or one that would go farther to serve you  'Well says  Jones  a little pacified you say this Fellow who I believe indeed is enough inclined to be my Friend lives in the same House with  Sophia  '  'In the same House answered  Partridge  why Sir he is one of the Servants of the Family and very well drest I promise you he is if it was not for his black Beard you would hardly know him'  'One Service then at least he may do me says  Jones  sure he can certainly convey a Letter to my  Sophia  '  'You have hit the Nail  ad unguem  cries  Partridge  how came I not to think of it I will engage he will do it upon the very first mentioning'  'Well then said  Jones  do you leave me at present and I will write a Letter which you shall deliver to him Tomorrow Morning for I suppose you know where to find him'  'O yes Sir answered  Partridge  I shall certainly find him again there is no Fear of that The Liquor is too good for him to stay away long I make no doubt but he will be there every Day he stays in Town'  'So you don't know the Street then where my  Sophia  is lodged cries  Jones'  '  'Indeed Sir I do says  Partridge'  '  'What is the Name of the Street cries  Jones'  '  'The Name Sir why here Sir just by answered  Partridge  not above a Street or two off I don't indeed know the very Name for as he never told me if I had asked you know it might have put some Suspicion into his Head No no Sir let me alone for that I am too cunning for that I promise you'  'Thou art most wonderfully cunning indeed replied  Jones  however I will write to my Charmer since I believe you will be cunning enough to find him Tomorrow at the Alehouse'  And now having dismissed the sagacious  Partridge  Mr  Jones  sat himself down to write in which Employment we shall leave him for a Time And here  e put an End to the fifteenth Book  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK XVI  Containing the Space of five Days  CHAP I  Of Prologues  I Have heard of a Dramatic Writer who used to say he would rather write a Play than a Prologue in like manner I think I can with less Pains write one of the Books of this History than the Prefatory Chapter to each of them  To say the Truth I believe many a hearty Curse hath been devoted on the Head of that Author who first instituted the Method of prefixing to his Play that Portion of Matter which is called the Prologue and which at first was Part of the Piece itself but of latter Years hath had usually so little Connexion with the Drama before which it stands that the Prologue to one Play might as well serve for any other Those  indeed of more modern Date seem to be written  n the same three Topics  viz  an Abuse of the Taste  f the Town a Condemnation of all Cotemporary Authors and an Elogium on the Performance just  bout to be represented The Sentiments in all these  re very little varied nor is it possible they should  nd indeed I have often wondered at the great Inven  on of Authors who have been capable of finding  ch various Phrases to express the same thing  In like manner I apprehend some future His  orian if any one shall do me the Honour of imitat  g my Manner will after much scratching his Pate  estow some good Wishes on my Memory for hav  g first established these several initial Chapters most  f which like Modern Prologues may as proper  be prefixed to any other Book in this History as  that which they introduce or indeed to any other  istory as to this  But however Authors may suffer by either of these  ventions the Reader will find suffieient Emolument  the one as the Spectator hath long found in the  er  First it is well known that the Prologue serves  e Critic for an Opportunity to try his Faculty of  issing and to tune his Catcall to the best Advan  ge by which means I have known those Musi  l Instruments so well prepared that they have been  le to play in full Concert at the first rising of the  rtain  The same Advantages may be drawn from these  hapters in which the Critic will be always sure of  eeting with something that may serve as a Whet  ne to his noble Spirit so that he may fall with a  ore hungry Appetite for Censure on the History  elf And here his sagacity must make it needless observe how artfully these Chapters are calculated that excellent Purpose for in these we have always  taken Care to intersperse somewhat of the sou  or acid Kind in order to sharpen and stimulate th  said Spirit of Criticism  Again the indolent Reader as well as Spectator finds great Advantage from both these for as they are not obliged either to see the one or read the others and both the Play and the Book are thus protracted by the former they have a Quarter of a  Hour longer to sit at Dinner and by the Latter the  have the Advantage of beginning to read at the fourt  or fifth Page instead of the first a Matter by n  means of trivial Consequence to Persons who rea  Books with no other View than to say they have rea  them a more general Motive to read than is com+monly imagined and from which not only La  Books and Good Books but the Pages of  Home  and  Virgil  of  Swift  and  Cervantes  have been ofte  turned over  Many other are the Emoluments which arise from both these but they are for the most Part so obviou  that we shall not at present stay to enumerate them especially since it occurs to us that the principal Me  of both the Prologue and Preface is that they  short  CHAP II  A whimsical Adventure which befel the Squire wi  the distressed Situation of  Sophia  WE must now convey the Reader to Mr  Western  Lodgings which were in  Piccadilly  where was placed by the Recommendation of the Landlo  at the  Hercules Pillars  at  HideParkCorner  for that Inn which was the first he saw on his Arrival Town he placed his Horses and in those Lod+ings which were the first he heard of he deposit himself  Here when  Sophia  alighted from the HackneyCoach which brought her from the House of Lady  Bellaston  she desired to return to the Apartment provided for her to which her Father very readily agreed  nd whither he attended her himself A short Dialogue neither very material nor pleasant to relate minutely then passed between them in which he  ressed her vehemently to give her Consent to the Marriage with  Blifil  who as he acquainted her was  o be in Town in a few Days but instead of com  lying she gave a more peremptory and resolute Re  usal than she had ever done before This so in  ensed her Father that after many bitter Vows that  e would force her to have him whether she would or  o he departed from her with many hard Words and Curses locked the Door and put the Key into his Pocket  While  Sophia  was left with no other Company than what attended the closest State Prisoner namely Fire  nd Candle the Squire sat down to regale himself  ver a Bottle of Wine with his Parson and the Land  ord of the  Hercules Pillars  who as the Squire  aid would make an excellent third Man and could  nform them of the News of the Town and how affairs went for to be sure says he he knows a  reat deal since the Horses of a many of the Quality and at his House  In this agreeable Society Mr  Western  past that  ening and great part of the succeeding Day dur  g which Period nothing happened of sufficient Con  equence to find a Place in this History All this  me  Sophia  past by herself for her Father swore she  hould never come out of her Chamber alive unless  e first consented to marry  Blifil  nor did he ever  ffer the Door to be unlocked unless to convey her  od on which Occasions he always attended him  elf  The second Morning after his Arrival while he and the Parson were at Breakfast together on a Toast and Tankard he was informed that a Gentleman was below to wait on him  'A Gentleman quoth the Squire who the Devil can he be Do Doctor go down and see who 'tis Mr  Blifil  can hardly be come to Town yetGo down do and know what his Business is'  The Doctor returned with an Account that it was a very well drest Man and by the Ribbon in his Hat  he took him for an Officer of the Army that he said he had some particular Business which he could deliver to none but Mr  Western  himself  'An Officer' cries the Squire 'what can any such Fellow have to do with me If he wants an  Order for BaggageWaggons I am no Justice o  Peace here nor can I grant a WarrantLe+un come up then if he must speak to me'  A very genteel Man now entered the Room who having made his Compliments to the Squire and desired the Favour of being alone with him delivered himself as follows  'Sir I come to wait upon you by the Comman  of my Lord  Fellamar  but with a very differen  Message from what I suppose you expect after wha  past the other Night'  'My Lord who cries the Squire I never hear  the Name o' un'  'His Lordship' said the Gentleman is willin  to impute every thing to the Effect of Liquor an  the most trifling Acknowledgment of that Kin  will set every thing right for as he hath the mo  violent Attachment to your Daughter you Sir an  the last Person upon Earth from whom he would resent an Affront and happy is it for you both tha  he hath given such publick Demonstrations of h  Courage as to be able to put up an Affair of th  Kind without Danger of any Imputation on his Honour All he desires therefore is that you will before me make some Acknowledgment the slightest in the World will be sufficient and he intends this Afternoon to pay his Respects to you in order to obtain your Leave of Visiting the young Lady on the Footing of a Lover'  'I don't understand much of what you say Sir' said the Squire 'but I suppose by what you talk about my Daughter that this is the Lord which my Lady Cousin  Bellaston  mentioned to me and said something about his courting my Daughter If so be that how that be the Caseyou may give my Service to his Lordship and tell un the Girl is disposed of already'  'Perhaps Sir' said the Gentleman 'you are not sufficiently apprized of the Greatness of this Offer I believe such a Person Title and Fortune would be no where refused'  'Lookee Sir' answered the Squire 'to be very plain my Daughter is bespoke already but if she was not I would not marry her to a Lord upon any Account I hate all Lords they are a Parcel of Courtiers and  Hannoverians  and I will have nothing to do with them''  'Well Sir' said the Gentleman 'if that is your' Resolution the Message I am to deliver to you is that my Lord desires the Favour of your Company this Morning in  HidePark'  '  'You may tell my Lord' answered the Squire that I am busy and cannot come I have enough to look after at home and can't stir abroad on any Account'  'I am sure Sir' quoth the other 'you are too much a Gentleman to send such a Message you will not I am convinced have it said of you that after having affronted a noble Peer you refuse him Satisfaction His Lordship would have been  willing from his great Regard to the young Lady to have made up Matters in another Way but unless he is to look on you as a Father his Honour will not suffer his putting up such an Indignity as you must be sensible you offered him'  'I offered him' cries the Squire 'it is a dm'd Lie I never offered him any Thing'  Upon these Words the Gentleman returned a very short verbal Rebuke and this he accompanied at the same Time with some manual Remonstrances which no sooner reached the Ears of Mr  Western  than that worthy Squire began to caper very briskly about the Room bellowing at the same Time with all his Might as if desirous to summon a greater Number of Spectators to behold his Agility  The Parson who had left great Part of the Tankard unfinished was not retired far he immediately attended therefore on the Squire's Vociferation crying  'Bless me Sir what's the Matter'    'Matter' quoth the Squire 'here's a HighwayMan I believe who wants to rob and murder mefor he hath fallen upon me with that Stick there in his Hand when I wish I may be dn'd if I gid un the least Provocation'  'How Sir' said the Captain 'did you not tell me I ly'd'  'No as hope to be saved answered the SquireI believe I might say "'Twas a Lie that I had offered any Affront to my Lord"'bu  I never said the Word  you lie  I understand my self better and you might have understood your+self better than to fall upon a naked Man If I had had a Stick in my Hand you would not hav  dared strike me I'd have knocked they Lantho  Jaws about thy Ears Come down into Ya  this Minute and I'll take a Bout with thee at sin+gle Stick for a broken Head that I will or I wi  go into naked Room and box thee for a Belly full At unt half a Man at unt I'm sure'  The Captain with some Indignation replied  'I see Sir you are below my Notice and I shall inform his Lordship you are below hisI am sorry I dirtied my Fingers with you'  At which  he withdrew the Parson interposing to prevent  e Squire from stopping him in which he easily  evailed as the other though he made some Efforts  the Purpose did not seem very violently bent on  uccess However when the Captain was departed  e Squire sent many Curses and some Menaces after  m but as these did not set out from his Lips till  Officer was at the Bottom of the Stairs and  ew louder and louder as he was more and more re  ote they did not reach his Ears or at least did not  ard his Departure  Poor  Sophia  however who in her Prison heard  her Father's Outcries from first to last began now  t to thunder with her Foot and afterwards to scream  oudly as the old Gentleman himself had done before  ough in a much sweeter Voice These Screams  n silenced the Squire and turned all his Conside  ion towards his Daughter whom he loved so ten  ly that the least Apprehension of any Harm hap  ing to her threw him presently into Agonies For  cept in that single Instance in which the whole fu  e Happiness of her Life was concerned she was  ereign Mistress of his Inclinations  Having ended his Rage against the Captain with  earing he would take the Law of him the Squire  mounted up Stairs to  Sophia  whom as soon as  had unlocked and opened the Door he found all  e and breathless The Moment however that she  her Father she collected all her Spirits and catch  him hold by the Hand she cry'd passionately  'O my dear Sir I am almost frightned to Death I  ope to Heaven no Harm hath happened to you'    'No no cries the Squire no great Harm The Rascal hath not hurt me much but rat me i  I don't ha the Laa o'un' 'Pray dear Sir says she tell me what's the Matter who is it that hath insulted you'  'I don't know the Name o'un' answer'd  Western  'some Officer Fellow I suppose tha  we are to pay for beating us but I'll make him pay this Bout if the Rascal hath got any thing which I suppose he hath not For thof he wa  drest out so vine I question whether he hath got a Voot of Land in the World'  'But dea  r Sir' cries she 'what was the Occasion of you  Quarrel  'What should it be  Sophy'  answered the Squire 'but about you  Sophy  All my Misfor+tunes are about you you will be the Death o  your poor Father at last Here's a Varlet of Lord the Lord knows who forsooth who hath a taan a Liking to you and because I would no  gi  un my Consent he sent me a Kallenge Come  do be a good Girl  Sophy  and put an End to a  your Father's Troubles come do consent to  +un he will be in Town within this Day or two do but promise me to marry un as soon as he come and you will make me the happiest Man in th  World and I will make you the happiest Woman you shall have the finest Cloaths in  London  an  the finest Jewels and a Coach and Six at yo  Command I promised  Allworthy  already to gi  +up half my EstateOd rabbit it I should hard+stick at giving up the whole'  'Will my Papa be kind says she to hear me speak'    'Why wo  t a  Sophy'  cries he 'when dost know that I had  +ther hear thy Voice than the Music of the b  Park of Dogs in  England  Hear thee my d  little Girl I hope I shall hear thee as long as live for if I was ever to lose that Pleasure  would not gee a Brass Varden to live a Moment longer Indeed  Sophy  you do not know how I love you indeed you don't or you never could have run away and left your poor Father who hath no other Joy no other Comfort upon Earth but his little  Sophy  '  At these Words the Tears stood in his Eyes and  Sophia  with the Tears streaming from hers answered  'Indeed my dear Papa I know you have loved me tenderly and Heaven is my Witness how sincerely I have returned your Affection nor could any thing but an Apprehension of being forced into the Arms of this Man have driven me to run from a Father whom I love so passionately that I would with Pleasure sacrifice my Life to his Happiness nay I have endeavoured to reason myself into doing more and had almost worked up a Resolution to endure the most miserable of all Lives to comply with your Inclinations It was that Resolution alone to which I could not force my Mind nor can I ever'  Here the Squire began to Look wild and the Foam appeared at his Lips which  Sophia  observing begged to be heard out and then proceeded  'If my Father's Life his Health or any real Happiness of his was at Stake here stands your resolved Daughter may Heaven blast me if there is a Misery I would not suffer to preserve youNo that most detested most loathsome of all Lots would I embrace I would give my Hand to  Blifil  for your Sake'    'I tell thee it will preserve me' answers the Father 'it will gee me Health Happiness Life every thingUpon my Soul I shall die if dost refuse me I shall break my Hear I shall upon my Soul'    'Is it possible' says she 'you can have such a Desire to make me miserable'  'I tell thee noa' answered he loudly 'my whole Desire is to make thee happy me dn me if there is a Thing upon Earth I would not do to see thee happy'    'And  will not my dear Papa allow me to have the lea  Knowledge of what will make me so If it be tru  that Happiness consists in Opinion what must b  my Condition when I think myself the most mi+serable of all the Wretches upon Eearth'  'Bet+ter think yourself so said he than know it b  being married to a poor bastardly Vagabond'  'I  it will content you Sir said  Sophia  I will give yo  the most solemn Promise never to marry him no  any other one while my Papa lives without hi  Consent Let me dedicate my whole Life to you  Service let me be again your poor  Sophy  and my whole Business and Pleasure be as it hath been to please and divert you'  'Lookey  Sophy  ' answer+ed the Squire 'I am not to be choused in this Man+ner Your Aunt  Western  would then have Reason to think me the Fool she doth No no  Sophy  I'  have you to know I have a got more Wisdom and know more of the World than to take the Word of a Woman in a Matter where a Man is concern+ed'  'How Sir have I deserved this want o  Confidence said she 'have I ever broke a single Promise to you Or have I ever been found guilty of a Falshood from my Cradle'  'Lookee  Sophy  cries he that's neither here nor there I am deter+min'd upon this Match and have him you shall dn me if shat unt Dn me if shat unt though dost hang thyself the next Morning'  At repeating which Words he clinched his Fist knit his Brows bit his Lips and thundered so loud that the poor afflicted terrified  Sophia  sunk trembling into her Chair and had not a Flood of Tears come immediately to her Relief perhaps worse had followed  Western  beheld the deplorable Condition of his Daughter with no more Contrition or Remorse than the Turnkey of  Newgate  feels at viewing the Agonies of a tender Wife when taking her last Farewel of her condemned Husband or rather he looked  down on her with the same Emotions which arise in an honest fair Tradesman who sees his Debtor dragged to Prison for  l  which though a just Debt the Wretch is wickedly unable to pay Or to hit the Case still more nearly he felt the same Compunction with a Bawd when some poor Innocent whom she hath ensnared into her Hands falls into Fits at the first Proposal of what is called seeing Company Indeed this Resemblance would be exact was it not that the Bawd hath an Interest in what she doth and the Father though perhaps he may blindly think otherwise can in Reality have none in urging his Daughter to almost an equal Prostitution  In this Condition he left his poor  Sophia  and departed with a very vulgar Observation on the Effect of Tears he locked the Room and returned to the Parson who said every Thing he durst in Behalf of the young Lady which though perhaps it was not quite so much as his Duty required yet was it sufficient to throw the Squire into a violent Rage and into many indecent Reflections on the whole Body of the Clergy which we have too great an Honour for that sacred Function to commit to Paper  CHAP III  What happened to  Sophia  during her Confinement  THE Landlady of the house where the Squire lodged had begun very early to entertain a strange Opinion of her Guests However as she was informed that the Squire was a Man of a vast Fortune and as she had taken Care to exact a very extraordinary Price for her Rooms she did not think proper to give any Offence for though she was not without some Concern for the Confinement of poor  Sophia  of whose great Sweetness of Temper and Affability the Maid of the House had made so favourable a Report which was confirmed by all the Squire's Servants yet she  had much more Concern for her own Interest than to provoke one whom as she said she perceived to be a very hastish Kind of a Gentleman  Though  Sophia  eat but little yet she was regularly served with her Meals indeed I believe if she had liked any one Rarity that the Squire however angry would have spared neither Pains nor Cost to have procured it for her since however strange it may appear to some of my Readers he really doated on his Daughter and to give her any Kind of Pleasure was the highest Satisfaction of his Life  The Dinner Hour being arrived black  George  carried her up a Pullet the Squire himself for he had sworn not to part with the Key attending the Door As  George  deposited the Dish some Compliments passed between him and  Sophia  for he had not seen her since she left the Country and she treated every Servant with more Respect than some Persons shew to those who are in a very slight Degree their Inferiors  Sophia  would have had him take the Pullet back saying she could not eat but  George  begged her to try and particularly recommended her to the Eggs of which he said it was full  All this Time the Squire was waiting at the Door but  George  was a great Favourite with his Master as his Employment was in Concerns of the highest Nature namely about the Game and was accustomed to take many Liberties He had officiously carried up the Dinner being as he said very desirous to see his young Lady he made therefore no Scruple of keeping his Master standing above ten Minutes while Civilities were passing between him and  Sophia  for which he received only a goodhumoured Rebuke at the Door when he returned  The Eggs of Pullets Partridges Pheasants  c  were as  George  well knew the most favourite Dainties of  Sophia  It was therefore no Wonder that he who was a very goodnatured Fellow should take  Care to supply her with this Kind of Delicacy at a Time when all the Servants in the House were afraid she would be starved for she had scarce swallowed a single Morsel in the last forty Hours  Though Vexation hath not the same Effect on all Persons as it usually hath on a Widow whose Appetite it often renders sharper than it can be rendered by the Air on  Bansted  Downs or  Salisbury  Plain yet the sublimest Grief notwithstanding what some People may say to the contrary will eat at last And  Sophia  herself after some little Consideration began to dissect the Fowl which she found to be as full of Eggs as  George  had reported it  But if she was pleased with these it contained something which would have delighted the Royal Society much more for if a Fowl with three Legs be so invaluable a Curiosity when perhaps Time hath produced a Thousand such at what Price shall we esteem a Bird which so totally contradicts all the Laws of Animal Oeconomy as to contain a Letter in its Belly  Ovid  tells us of a Flower into which  Hyacinthus  was metamorphosed that bears Letters on its Leaves which  Virgil  recommended as a Miracle to the Royal Society of his Day but no Age nor Nation hath ever recorded a Bird with a Letter in its Maw  But though a Miracle of this Kind might have engaged all the  Academies des Sciences  in  Europe  and perhaps in a fruitless Enquiry yet the Reader by barely recollecting the last Dialogue which passed between Messieurs  Jones  and  Partridge  will be very easily satisfied from whence this Letter came and how it found its Passage into the Fowl  Sophia  notwithstanding her long Fast and notwithstanding her favourite Dish was there before her no sooner saw the Letter than she immediately snatched it up tore it open and read as follows  Madam  Was I was not sensible to whom I have the Honour of writing I should endeavour however difficult to paint the Horros of my Mind at the Account brought me by Mrs  Honour  but as Tenderness alone can have any true Idea of the Pangs which Tenderness is capable of feeling so can this most amiable Quality which my  Sophia  possesses in the most eminent Degree sufficiently inform her what her  Jones  must have suffered on this melancholy OccasionIs there a Circumstance in the World which can highten my Agonies when I hear of any Misfortune which hath befallen you Surely there is one only and with that I am accursed It is my  Sophia  the dreadful Consideration that I am myself the wretched Cause Perhaps I here do myself too much Honour but none will envy me+an Honour which costs me so extremely dear Pardon me this Presumption and pardon me the greater still if I ask you whether my Advice my Assistance my Presence my Absence my Death o  my Tortures can bring you any Relief Can the most perfect Admiration the most watchful Observance the most ardent Love the most melting Tenderness the most resigned Submission to your Will make you Amends for what you are to sacrifice to my Happiness If they can fly my lovely Angel to those Arms which are ever open to received and protect you and to which whether you bring yourself alone or the Riches of the World with you is in my Opinion an Alternative not worth regarding If on the contrary Wisdom shall predominate and on the most mature Reflection inform you that the Sacrifice is too great and i  there be no Way left to reconcile you to your Father and restore the Peace of your dear Mind bu  by abandoning me I conjure you drive me for eve  from your Thoughts exert your Resolution and  let no Compassion for my Sufferings bear the least Weight in that tender Bosom Believe me Madam I so sincerely love you better than myself that my great and principal End is your Happiness My first Wish why would not Fortune indulge me in it was and pardon me if I say still is to see you every Moment the happiest of Women my second Wish is to hear you are so but no Misery on Earth can equal mine while I think you owe an uneasy Moment to him who is  Madam  In every Sense and to every Purpose Your devoted Thomas Jones  What  Sophia  said or did or thought upon this Letter how often she read it or whether more than once shall all be left to our Reader's Imagination The Answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter but not at present for this Reason among others that she did not now write any and that for several good Causes one of which was this she had no Paper Pen nor Ink  In the Evening while  Sophia  was meditating on the Letter she had received or something else a violent Noise from below disturbed her Meditation This Noise was no other than a round Bout at Altercation between two Persons One of the Combatants by his Voice she immediately distinguished to be her Father but she did not so soon discover the shriller Pipes to belong to the Organ of her Aunt  Western  who was just arrived in Town and having by means of one of her Servants who stopt at the  Hercules Pillars  learnt where her Brother lodged she drove directly to his Lodgings  We shall therefore take our Leave at present of  Sophia  and with our usual GoodBreeding attend her Ladyship  CHAP IV  In which  Sophia  is delivered from her Confinement  THE Squire and the Parson for the Landlord was now otherwise engaged were smoaking their Pipes together when the Arrival of the Lady was first signified The Squire no sooner heard her Name than he immediately ran down to usher her up Stairs for he was a great Observer of such Ceremonials especially to his Sister of whom he stood more in awe than of any other human Creature though he never would own this nor did he perhaps know it himself  Mrs  Western  on her Arrival in the DiningRoom having flung herself into a Chair begun thus to harangue  'Well surely no one ever had such an intolerable Journey I think the Roads since so many Turnpike Acts are grown worse than ever La Brother how could you get into this odious Place No Person of Condition I dare swear ever set Foot here before In every Sense and to every Purpose Your devoted'  'I don't know cries the Squire I think they do well enough it was Landlord recommended them I thought as he knew most of the Quality he could best shew me where to get among um'  'Well and where's my Niece says the Lady have you been to wait upon Lady  Bellaston  yet'  'Ay ay cries the Squire your Neice is safe enough she is up Stairs in Chamber'  'How' answered the Lady 'is my Neice in this House and doth she not know of my being here'  'No nobody can well get to her says the Squire for she is under Lock and Key I have her safe I vetched her from my Lady Cousin the first Night I came to Town and I have taken Care o' her ever since she is as secure as a Fox in a Bag I promise you'  'Good Heaven returned Mrs  Western  what do I hear I thought what a fine Piece of Work would be the Consequence of  my Consent to your coming to Town yourself nay it was indeed your own Headstrong Will nor can I charge myself with having ever consented to it Did not you promise me Brother that you would take none of these Headstrong Measures Was it not by those Headstrong Measures that you forced my Neice to run away from you in the Country Have you Mind to oblige her to take such another Step'  'Zds and the Devil' cries the Squire dashing his Pipe on the Ground 'did ever Mortal hear the like when I expected you would have commended me for all I have done to be fallen upon in this Manner'  'How Brother said the Lady have I ever given you the least Reason to imagine I should commend you for locking up your Daughter Have I not often told you that Women in a free Country are not to be treated with such arbitrary Power We are as free as the Men and I heartily wish I could not say we deserve that Freedom better If you expect I should stay a Moment longer in this wretched House or that I should ever own you again as my Relation or that I should ever trouble myself again with the Affairs of your Family I insist upon it that my Neice be set at Liberty this Instant'  This she spoke with so commanding an Air standing with her Back to the Fire with one Hand behind her and a Pinch of Snuff in the other that I question whether  Thalestris  at the Head of her Amazons ever made a more tremendous Figure It is no Wonder therefore that the poor Squire was not Proof against the Awe which she inspired  'There he cried' throwing down the Key 'There it is do whatever you please I intended only to have kept her up till  Blifil  came to Town which can't be long and now if any Harm happens in the mean Time remember who is to be blamed for it'  'I will answer it with my Life cry'd Mrs  Western  but I shall not intermeddle at all unless upon  one Condition and that is that you will commit the whole entirely to my Care without taking any one Measure yourself unless I shall eventually appoint you to act If you ratify these Preliminaries Brother I yet will endeavour to preserve the Honour of your Family if not I shall continue in a neutral State'  'I pray you good Sir said the Parson permit yourself this once to be admonished by her Ladyship peradventure by communing with young Madam  Sophia  she will effect more than you have been able to perpetrate by more rigorous Measures'  'What dost thee open upon me' cries the Squire 'If thee dost begin to babble I shall whip thee in presently'  'Fie Brother' answered the Lady 'is this Language to a Clergyman Mr  Supple  is a Man o  Sense and gives you the best Advice and the whole World I believe will concur in his Opinion but I must tell you I expect an immediate Answer to my catagorical Proposals Either cede your Daughter to my Disposal or take her wholly to your own Surprizing Discretion and then I here before Mr  Supple  evacuate the Garrison and renounce you and your Family for ever'  'I pray you let me be a Mediator' cries the Parson 'let me supplicate you'  'Why there lies the Key on the Table' cries th  Squire 'She may take un up if she pleases who hinders her'  'No Brother' answered the Lady 'I insist on th  Formality of its being delivered me with a full Ratification of all the Concessions stipulated'  'Why then I will deliver it to youTher  'tis' cries the Squire 'I am sure Sister yo  can't accuse me of ever denying to trust my Daughter to you She hath a lived wi' you a whole Yea  and muore to a Time without my ever zeeing her'  'And it would have been happy for her' answered the Lady if she had always lived with me Nothing of this Kind would have happened under my Eye'  'Ay certainly' cries he 'I only am to blame'  'Why you are to blame Brother' answered she I have been obliged to tell you so and shall always be obliged to tell you so However I hope you will now amend and gather so much Experience from past Errors as not to defeat my wisest Machinations by your Blunders Indeed Brother you are not qualified for these Negotiations All your whole Scheme of Politics is wrong I once more therefore insist that you do not intermeddle Remember only what is past'  'Zds and Bld Sister' cries the Squire 'What would you have me say You are enough to provoke the Devil'  'There now' said she 'just according to the old Custom I see Brother there is no talking to you I will appeal to Mr  Supple  who is a Man of Sense if I said any Thing which could put any Human Creature into a Passion but you are so wrongheaded every Way'  'Let me beg you Madam' said the Parson 'not to irritate his Worship'  'Irritate him' said the Lady'Sure you are as great a Fool as himself Well Brother since you have promised not to interfere I will once more undertake the Management of my Neice Lord have Mercy upon all Affairs which are under the Directions of Men The Head of one Woman is worth a thousand of you'  And now having summoned Servant to shew her to  Sophia  she departed bearing the Key with her She was no sooner gone than the Squire having first shut the Door ejaculated twenty Bitches and as many hearty Curses against  her not sparing himself for having ever thought of her Estate but added  'Now one hath been a Slave so long it would be Pity to lose it at last for want of holding out a little longer The Bitch can't live for ever and I know I am down for it upon the Will'  The Parson greatly commended this Resolution and now the Squire having ordered in another Bottle which was his usual Method when any Thing either pleased or vexed him did by drinking plentifully of this medicinal Julap so totally wash away his Choler that his Temper was become perfectly placid and serene when Mrs  Western  returned with  Sophia  into the Room The young Lady had on her Hat and Capuchin and the Aunt acquainted Mr  Western  'that she intended to take her Neice with her to her own Lodgings for indeed Brother' says she 'these Rooms are not fit to receive a Christian Soul in'  'Very well Madam' quoth  Western  'whatever you please The Girl can never be in better Hands than yours and the Parson here can do me the Justice to say that I have said fifty Times behind your Back that you was one of the most sensible Women in the World'  'To this' cries the Parson 'I am ready to bear Testimony'  'Nay Brother' says Mrs  Western  'I have always I'm sure given you as favourable a Character You must own you have a little too much Hastiness in your Temper but when you will allow yourself Time to reflect I never knew a Man more reasonable'  'Why then Sister if you think so' said the Squire  'here's your good Health with all my Heart I am a little passionate sometimes but I scorn to bear any Malice  Sophy  do you be a good Girl and do every Thing your Aunt orders you'  'I have not the least Doubt of her' answered Mrs  Western  'She hath had already an Example before her Eyes in the Behaviour of that Wretch her Cousin  Harriet  who ruined herself by neglecting my AdviceO Brother what think you You was hardly gone out of Hearing when you set out for  London  when who should arrive but that impudent Fellow with the odious  Irish  Namethat  Fitzpatrick  He broke in abruptly upon me without Notice or I would not have seen him He ran on a long unintelligible Story about his Wife to which he forced me to give him a Hearing but I made him very little Answer and delivered him the Letter from his Wife which I bid him answer himself I suppose the Wretch will endeavour to find us out but I beg you will not see her for I am determined I will not'  'I zee her' answered the Squire 'you need not fear me I'll ge no Encouragement to such undutiful Wenches It is well for the Fellow her Husband I was not at Huome Od rabbit it he should have taken a Dance thru the Horsepond I promise un You zee  Sophy  what Undutifulness brings Volks to do You have an Example in your own Family' Brother' cries the Aunt you need not shock my Niece by such odious Repetitions Why will you not leave every Thing entirely to me'  'Well well I wull I wull' said the Squire'  And now Mrs  Western  luckily for  Sophia  put an End to the Conversation by ordering Chairs to be called I say luckily for had it continued much longer fresh Matter of Dissention would most probably have arisen between the Brother and Sister between whom Education and Sex made the only Difference for both were equally violent and equally positive they had both a vast Affection for  Sophia  and both a sovereign Contempt for each other  CHAP V  In which  Jones  receives a Letter from  Sophia  an  goes to a Play with Mrs  Miller  and  Partridge  THE Arrival of  Black George  in Town and th  good Offices which that grateful Fellow ha  promised to do for his old Benefactor greatly com+forted  Jones  in the midst of all the Anxiety and Une  +siness which he had suffered on the Account of  Sophia  from whom by the Means of the said  George  received the following Answer to his Letter whi  Sophia  to whom the Use of Pen Ink and Pape  was restored with her Liberty wrote the very Even+ing when she departed from her Confinement  Sir  As I do not doubt your Sincerity in what y  write you will be pleased to hear that some of  Afflictions are at an End by the Arrival of  Aunt  Western  with whom I am at present a  with whom I enjoy all the Liberty I can desir  One Promise my Aunt hath insisted on my makin  which is that I will not see or converse with a  Person without her Knowledge and Consent Th  Promise I have most solemnly given and shall m  inviolably keep And tho' she hath not expre  forbidden me writing yet that must be an Omiss  from Forgetfulness or this perhaps is includ  in the Word conversing However as I can  but consider this as a Breach of her generous Con+fidence in my Honour you cannot expect tha  shall after this continue to write myself or receive Letters without her Knowledge A P  +mise is with me a very sacred Thing and to be e  +tended to every Thing understood from it as w  as to what is expressed by it and this Conside  +tion may perhaps on Reflection afford you so  Comfort But why should I mention a Comf  to you of this Kind For though there is one Thing in which I can never comply with the best of Fathers yet am I firmly resolved never to act in Defiance of him or to take any Step of Consequence without his Consent A firm Perswasion of this must teach you to divert your Thoughts from what Fortune hath perhaps made impossible This your own Interest persuades you This may reconcile you I hope to Mr  Allworthy  and if it will you have my Injunctions to pursue it Accidents have laid some Obligations on me your good Intentions probably more Fortune may perhaps be sometimes kinder to us both than at present Believe this that I shall always think of you as I think you deserve and am  Sir  Your obliged Humble ServantSophia Western'  I charge you write to me no moreat present at least and accept this which is now of no Service to me which I know you must want and think you owe the Trifle only to that Fortune by which you found it  Meaning perhaps the Bankbill for  l  A Child who hath just learnt his Letters would have spelt this Letter out in less Time than  Jones  took in reading it The Sensations it occasioned were a Mixture of Joy and Grief somewhat like what divide the Mind of a good Man when he peruses the Will of his deceased Friend in which a large Legacy which his Distresses make the more welcome is bequeathed to him Upon the whole however he was more pleased than displeased and indeed the Reader may probably wonder that he was displeased at all but the Reader is not quite so much in Love as  was poor  Jones  And Love is a Disease which tho' it may in some Instances resemble a Consumption which it sometimes causes in others proceeds in direct Opposition to it and particularly in this that i  never flatters itself or sees any one Symptom in a favourable Light  One Thing gave him complete Satisfaction which was that his Mistress had regained her Liberty and was now with a Lady where she might at least assure herself of a decent Treatment Another comfortable Circumstance was the Reference which she made to her Promise of never marrying any other Man For however disinterested he might imagine his Passion and notwithstanding all the generous Overture made in his Letter I very much question whether he could have heard a more afflicting Piece of News tha  that  Sophia  was married to another tho' the Matc  had been never so great and never so likely to end in making her completely happy That refined Degre  of  Platonic  Affection which is absolutely detached from the Flesh and is indeed entirely and purely spiritual is a Gift confined to the female Part of the Creation many of whom I have heard declare and doubtless with great Truth that they would wit  the utmost Readiness resign a Lover to a Rival whe  such Resignation was proved to be necessary for th  temporal Interest of such Lover Hence therefore I conclude that this Affection is in Nature though I cannot pretend to say I have ever seen an Instan  of it  Mr  Jones  having spent three Hours in reading an  kissing the aforesaid Letter and being at last in State of good Spirits from the last mentioned Considerations he agreed to carry an Appointment which he had before made into Execution This was to attend Mrs  Miller  and her youngest Daughter into th  Gallery at the Playhouse and to admit Mr  Partridge  as one of the Company For as  Jones  had really tha  Taste for Humour which many affect he expected to enjoy much Entertainment in the Criticisms of  Partridge  from whom he expected the simple Dictates of Nature unimproved indeed but likewise unadulterated by Art  In the first Row then of the first Gallery did Mr  Jones  Mrs  Miller  her youngest Daughter and  Partridge  take their Place  Partridge  immediately declared it was the finest Place he had ever been in When the first Musick was played he said  'It was a Wonder how so many Fidlers could play at one Time without putting one another out'  While the Fellow was lighting the upper Candles he cry'd out to Mrs  Miller  'Look look Madam the very Picture of the Man in the End of the CommonPrayer Book before the GunpowderTreason Service'  Nor could he help observing with a Sigh when all the Candles were lighted  'That here were Candles enough burnt in one Night to keep an honest poor Family for a whole Twelvemonth'  As soon as the Play which was  Hamlet  Prince of  Denmark  began  Partridge  was all Attention nor did he break Silence till the Entrance of the Ghost upon which he asked  Jones  'what Man that was in the strange Dress something' said he 'like what I have seen in a Picture Sure it is not Armour is it'  Jones  answered  'That is the Ghost'  To which  Partridge  replied with a Smile  'Perswade me to that Sir if you can Though I can't say I ever actually saw a Ghost in my Life yet I am certain I should know one if I saw him better than that comes to No no Sir Ghosts don't appear in such Dresses as that neither'  In this Mistake which caused much Laughter in the Neighbourhood of  Partridge  he was suffered to continue 'till the Scene between the  Ghost  and  Hamlet  when  Partridge  gave that Credit to Mr  Garrick  which he had denied to  Jones  and fell into so violent a Trembling that his Knees  knocked against each other  Jones  asked him what was the Matter and whether he was afraid of the Warrior upon the Stage  'O la Sir' said he 'I perceive now it is what you told me I am not afraid of any Thing for I know it is but a Play And if it was really a Ghost it could do one no Harm at such a Distance and in so much Company and yet if I was frightned I am not the only Person'  'Why who' cries  Jones  'dost thou take to be such a Coward here besides thyself'  'Nay you may call me Coward if you will but if that little Man there upon the Stage is not frightned I never saw any Man frightned in my Life Ay ay  go along with you  Ay to be sure Who's Fool then Will you Lud have Mercy upon such FoolHardinessWhatever happens it is good enough for you  Follow you  I'd follow the Devil as soon Nay perhaps it is the Devilfor they say he can put on what likeness he pleasesOh here he is again  No farther  No you have gone far enough already farther than I'd have gone for all the King's Dominons'  Jones  offered to speak but  Partrisge  cried  'Hush hush dear Sir don't you hear him'  And during the whole Speech of the Ghost he sat with his Eyes fixed partly on the Ghost and partly on  Hamlet  and with his Mouth open the same Passions which succeeded each other in  Hamlet  succeeding likewise in him  When the Scene was over  Jones  said  'Why  Partridge  you exceed my Expectations You enjoy the Play more than I conceived possible'  'Nay Sir answered  Partridge  'if you are not afraid of the Devil I can't help it but to be sure it is natural to be surprized at such Things though I know there is nothing in them Not that it was the Ghost that surprized me neither for I should have known that to have been only a Man in a strange Dress But when I saw the little Man so frightned himself  it was that which took Hold of me'  'And dost thou imagine then  Partridge'  cries  Jones  that he was really frightned'  'Nay Sir' said  Partridge  'did not you yourself observe afterwards when he found out it was his own Father's Spirit and how he was murdered in the Garden how his Fear forsook him by Degrees and he was struck dumb with Sorrow as it were just as I should have been had it been my own CaseBut hush' O la What Noise is that There he is againWell to be certain though I know there is nothing at all in it I am glad I am not down yonder where those Men are' Then turning his Eyes again upon  Hamlet  'Ay you may draw your Sword what signifies a Sword against the Power of the Devil'  During the second Act  Partridge  made very few remarks He greatly admired the Fineness of the  resses nor could he help observing upon the King's  ountenance  'Well' said he 'how People may be deceived by Faces  Nulla fides fronti  is I find a true Saying Who would think by looking in the King's Face that he had ever committed a Mur  er'  He then enquired after the Ghost but  Jones  ho intended he should be surprized gave him no  ther Satisfaction than  'that he might possibly see him again soon and in a Flash of Fire'  Partridge  sat in fearful expectation of this and  ow when the Ghost made his next Appearance  Partridge  cried out  'There Sir now what say you now Is he frightned now or no As much frightned as you think me and to be sure no Body can help some Fears I would not be in so bad a Condition as what's his Name Squire  Hamlet  is there for all the World Bless me What's become of the Spirit As I am a living Soul I thought I saw him sink into the Earth'  'Indeed you saw right'  answered  Jones  'Well well' cries  Partridge  'I know it is only a Play and besides if  there was any Thing in all this Madam  Miller  would not laugh so For as to you Sir you would not be afraid I believe if the Devil was here i  PersonThere thereAy no Wonde  you are in such a Passion shake the vile wicke  Wretch to Pieces If she was my own Mother I should serve her so To be sure all Duty to Mother is forfeited by such wicked DoingsAy go about your Business I hate the Sight  you'  Our Critic was now pretty silent till the Play whic  Hamlet  introduces before the King This he did n  at first understand 'till  Jones  explained it to him but he no sooner entered into the Spirit of it than  began to bless himself that he had never committe  Murder' Then turning to Mrs  Miller  he asked he  'If she did not imagine the King looked as if he w  touched though he is' said he 'a good Acto  and doth all he can to hide it Well I would n  have so much to answer for as that wicked M  there hath to sit upon a much higher Chair than  sits uponNo wonder he run away for yo  Sake I'll never trust an innocent Face again'  The Gravedigging Scene next engaged the At+tention of  Partridge  who expressed much Surpri  at the Number of Skulls thrown upon the Stag  To which  Jones  answered  'That it was one of th  most famous BurialPlaces about Town'  'N  wonder then' cries  Partridge  'that the Place haunted But I never saw in my Life a worse Grav  digger I had a Sexton when I was Clerk th  should have dug three Graves while he is diggi  one The Fellow handles a Spade as if it was th  first Time he had ever had one in his Hand A  ay you may sing You had rather sing than wo  I believe'  Upon  Hamlet'  s taking up the Sku  he cry'd out  'Well it is strange to see how fearl  some Men are I never could bring myself to tou  any Thing belonging to a dead Man on any AccountHe seemed frightned enough too at the Ghost I thought  Nemo omnibus horis sapit  '  Little more worth remembring occurred during the  ay at the End of which  Jones  asked him  'which of the Players he had liked best'  To this he an  wered with some Appearance of Indignation at the  uestion  'The King without Doubt'  'Indeed Mr  Partridge'  says Mrs  Miller  'you are not of the same Opinion with the Town for they all agreed that  Hamlet  is acted by the best Player who was ever on the Stage'  'He the best Player'  es  Partridge  with a contemptuous Sneer 'why I could act as well as he myself I am sure if I had seen a Ghost I should have looked in the very same Manner and done just as he did And then to be sure in that Scene as you call it between him and his Mother where you told me he acted so fine why Lord help me any Man that is any good Man that had such a Mother would have done exactly the same I know you are only joking with me but indeed Madam though I was never at a Play in  London  yet I have seen acting before in the Country and the King for my Money  he speake all his Words distinctly half as loud again as the otherAny Body may see he is an Actor'  While Mrs  Miller  was thus engaged in Conversation with  Partridge  a Lady came up to Mr  Jones  hom he immediately knew to be Mrs  Fitzpatrick  e said she had seen him from the other Part of the  allery and had taken that Opportunity of speaking him as she had something to say which might be great Service to himself She then acquainted  with her Lodgings and made him an Appoint  ent the next Day in the Morning which upon  ecollection she presently changed to the Afternoon which Time  Jones  promised to attend her  Thus ended the Adventure at the Playhou  where  Partridge  had afforded great Mirth not o  to  Jones  and Mrs  Miller  but to all who sat with hearing who were more attentive to what he sa  than to any Thing that passed on the Stage  He durst not go to Bed all that Night for Fear the Ghost and for many Nights after sweat two three Hours before he went to sleep with the sa  Apprehensions and waked several Times in g  Horrors crying out  'Lord have Mercy upon  there it is'  CHAP VI  In which the History is obliged to look back  IT is almost impossible for the best Parent to obse  an exact Impartiality to his Children even thou  no superior Merit should biass his Affection but s  a Parent can hardly be blamed when that Superior determines his Preference  As I regard all the Personages of this History the Light of my Children so I must confess the sa  Inclination of Partiality to  Sophia  and for tha  hope the Reader will allow me the same Excu  from the Superiority of her Character  This extraordinary Tenderness which I have my Heroine never suffers me to quit her any lo  Time without the utmost Reluctance I could no  therefore return impatiently to enquire what h  happened to this lovely Creature since her Depart  from her Father's but that I am obliged first to p  a short Visit to Mr  Blifil  Mr  Western  in the first Confusion into which Mind was cast upon the sudden News he received his Daughter and in his first Hurry to go after h  had not once thought of sending any Account of  Discovery to  Blifil  He had not gone far however before he recollected himself and according  stopt at the very first Inn he came to and dispatched  way a Messenger to acquaint  Blifil  with his having  ound  Sophia  and with his firm Resolution to marry  er to him immediately if he would come up after  im to Town  As the Love which  Blifil  had for  Sophia  was of that  iolent Kind which nothing but the Loss of her For  une or some such Accident could lessen his In  ination to the Match was not at all altered by her  aving run away though he was obliged to lay this  o his own Account He very readily therefore em  raced this Offer Indeed he now proposed the Gra  fication of a very strong Passion besides Avarice by marrying this young Lady and this was Hatred For  e concluded that Matrimony afforded an equal Opportunity of satisfying either Hatred or Love and his Opinion is very probably verified by much Expe  ience To say the Truth if we are to judge by  e ordinary Behaviour of married Persons to each  ther we shall perhaps be apt to conclude that the Generality seek the Indulgence of the former Passion only in their Union of every Thing but of Hearts  There was one Difficulty however in his Way and this arose from Mr  Allworthy  That good Man when he found by the Departure of  Sophia  for neither that nor the Cause of it could be concealed from him the great Aversion which she had for his Nephew began to be seriously concerned that he had been deceived into carrying Matters so far He by  o Means concurred with the Opinions of those Parents who think it as immaterial to consult the Inclinations of their Children in the Affair of Marriage as to solicit the good Pleasure of their Servants when they intend to take a Journey and who are  y Law or Decency at least withheld often from  sing absolute Force On the contrary as he esteemed the Institution to be of the most sacred Kind  thought every preparatory Caution necessary to  preserve it holy and inviolate and very wisely con+cluded that the surest Way to effect this was by lay+ing the Foundation in previous Affections  Blifil  indeed soon cured his Uncle of all Anger o  the Score of Deceit by many Vows and Protestati+ons that he had been deceived himself with which th  many Declarations of  Western  very well tallied bu  now to persuade  Allworthy  to consent to the renewing his Addresses was a Matter of such apparent Difficul+ty that the very Appearance was sufficient to hav  deterred a less enterprizing Genius but this young Gentleman so well knew his own Talents that no+thing within the Province of Cunning seemed to him hard to be atchieved  Here then he represented the Violence of his own Affection and the Hopes of subduing Aversion i  the Lady by Perseverance He begged that in an Af+fair on which depended all his future Repose h  might at least be at Liberty to try all fair Means fo  Success Heaven forbid he said that he should e+ver think of prevailing by any other than the mo  gentle Methods  'Besides Sir said he if they fai  you may then which will be surely time enough  deny your Consent'  He urged the great and eage  Desire which Mr  Western  had for the Match an  lastly he made great Use of the Name of  Jones  to whom he imputed all that had happened and from whom he said to preserve so valuable a young Lady was even on Act of Charity  All these Arguments were well seconded by  Thwack+um  who dwelt a little stronger on the Authority o  Parents than Mr  Blifil  himself had done He ascrib+ed the Measures which Mr  Blifil  was desirous to take to Christian Motives  'and though' says he 'the good young Gentleman hath mentioned Charity last I am almost convinced it is his first and principal Consideration'  Square  possibly had he been present would have  ng to the same Tune though in a different Key  d would have discovered much more Moral Fitness  the Proceeding but he was now gone to  Bath  for  e Recovery of his Health  Allworthy  though not without Reluctance at last  ielded to the Desires of his Nephew He said he  ould accompany him to  London  where he might  e at Liberty to use every honest Endeavour to gain  e Lady  'But I declare' said he 'I will never give my Consent to any absolute Force being put on her Inclinations nor shall you ever have her unless she can be brought freely to Compliance'  Thus did the Affection of  Allworthy  for his Nephew betray the superior Understanding to be tri  mphed over by the inferiour and thus is the Pru  ence of the best of Heads often defeated by the Tenderness of the best of Hearts  Blifil  having obtained this unhoped for Acquiescence  n his Uncle rested not till he carried his Purpose  nto Execution And as no immediate Business re  uired Mr  Allworthy'  s Presence in the Country and  ittle Preparation is necessary to Men for a Journey  hey set out the very next Day and arrived in Town  hat Evening when Mr  Jones  as we have seen was  iverting himself with  Partridge  at the Play  The Morning after his Arrival Mr  Blifil  waited on Mr  Western  by whom he was most kindly and graciously received and from whom he had every possible Assurance perhaps more than was possible that he should very shortly be as happy as  Sophia  could make him nor would the Squire suffer the young Gentleman to return to his Uncle till he had almost against his Will carried him to his Sister  CHAP VII  In which Mr  Western  pays a Visit to his Sister i  company with Mr  Blifil  MRS  Western  was reading a Lecture on Pru+dence and Matrimonial Politics to her Niece when her Brother and  Blifil  broke in with less Ce+remony than the Laws of Visiting require  Sophia  no sooner saw  Blifil  than she turned pale and al+most lost the Use of all her Faculties but her Aun  on the contrary waxed red and having all her Facul+ties at Command began to exert her Tongue on th  Squire  'Brother' said she 'I am astonished at you  Behaviour will you never learn any Regard to De+corum Will you still look upon every Apartment as your own or as belonging to one of your Coun+try Tenants Do you think yourself at Liberty  invade the Privacies of Women of Condition with+out the least Decency or Notice'    'Why what the a Pox is the Matter now quoth th  Squire one would think I had caught you at'    'None of your Brutality Sir I beseech you'  an+swered she'You have surprized my poor Niece  'so that she can hardly I see support herselfGo my dear retire and endeavour to recruit you  Spirits for I see you have Occasion'  At which Words  Sophia  who never received a more welcom  Command hastily withdrew  'To be sure Sister' cries the Squire 'you a  mad when I have brought Mr  Blifil  here to co  her to force her away'  'Sure Brother' says she 'you are worse tha  mad when you know in what Situation Affairs ar  toI am sure I ask Mr  Blifil  pardon but h  knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a Reception For my own part I am sure I sha  always be very glad to see Mr  Blifil  but his own good Sense would not have suffered him to proceed so abruptly had you not compelled him to it'  Blifil  bowed and stammered and looked like a Fool  t  Western  without giving him time to form a Speech  r the Purpose answered  'Well well I am to blame if you will I always am certainly but come let the Girl be fetched back again or let Mr  Blifil  go to herHe's come on Purpose and there is no time to be lost'  'Brother' cries Mrs  Western  'Mr  Blifil  I am confident understands himself better than to think of seeing my Niece any more this Morning after what hath happened Women are of a nice Contexture and our Spirits when disordered are not to be recomposed in a Moment Had you suffered Mr  Blifil  to have sent his Compliments to my Niece and to have desired the Favour of waiting on her in the Afternoon I should possibly have prevailed on her to have seen him but now I despair of bringing about any such Matter'  'I am very sorry Madam' cried  Blifil  'that Mr  Western'  s extraordinary Kindness to me which I can never enough acknowledge should have occasioned'  'Inded Sir' said she interrupting  im 'you need make no Apologies we all know my Brother so well'  'I don't care what any Body knows of me' answered the Squire'but when must he come to see her for consider I tell you he is come up on purpose and so is  Allworthy'  '  'Brother' said  e 'whatever Message Mr  Blifil  thinks proper to send to my Niece shall be delivered to her and I suppose she will want no Instructions to make a proper Answer I am convinced she will not refuse to see Mr  Blifil  at a proper Time'    'The Devil she won't' answered the Squire'OdsbudDon't we knowI say nothing but some  Volk are wiser than all the WorldIf I might have had my will she had not run away before And now I expect to hear every Moment she is guone again For as great a Fool as some Volk think me I know very well she hates'    'No Matter Brother' replied Mrs  Western  'I will not hear my Niece abused It is a Reflection on my Family She is an Honour to it and she will be an Honour to it I promise you I will pawn my whole Reputation in the World on her ConductI shall be glad to see you Brother in the Afternoon for I have somewhat of Importance to mention to youAt present Mr  Blifil  as well as you must excuse me for I am in haste to dress'    'Well but' said the Squire 'do appoint a Time'    'Indeed' said she 'I can appoint no TimeI tell you I will see you in the Afternoon'    'What the Devil would you have me do' cries the Squire turning to  Blifil  'I can no muore turn her than a Beagle can turn an old Hare Perhaps she will be in a better Humour in the Afternoon'    'I am condemned I see Sir to Misfortune' answered  Blifil  'but I shall always own my Obligations to you'  He then took a ceremonious Leave of Mrs  Western  who was altogether as ceremonious on her Part and them they departed the Squire muttering to himself with an Oath that  Blifil  should see his Daughter in the Afternoon  If Mr  Western  was little pleased with this Interview  Blifil  was less As to the former he imputed the whole Behaviour of his Sister to her Humour only and to her Dissatisfaction at the omission of Ceremony in the Visit but  Blifil  saw a little deeper into Things He suspected somewhat of more Consequence from two or three Words which dropt from the Lady and to say the Truth he suspected right as will appear  when I have unfolded the several Matters which will be continued in the following Chapter  CHAP VIII  Schemes of Lady  Bellaston  for the Ruin of  Jones  LOVE had taken too deep a Root in the Mind of Lord  Fellamar  to be plucked up by the rude Hands of Mr  Western  In the Heat of Resentment he had indeed given a Commission to Captain  Egglane  which the Captain had far exceeded in the Execution  or had it been executed at all had his Lordship been  ble to find the Captain after he had seen Lady  Bellaston  which was in the Afternoon of the Day after he had received the Affront but so industrious was the Captain in the Discharge of his Duty that  aving after long Enquiry found out the Squire's Lodg  ngs very late in the Evening he sat up all Night at  Tavern that he might not miss the Squire in the Morning and by that Means missed the Revocation which my Lord had sent to his Lodgings  In the Afternoon then next after the intended Rape  f  Sophia  his Lordship as we have said made a  isit to Lady  Bellaston  who laid open so much of the  haracter of the Squire that his Lordship plainly  the Absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any  ffence at his Words especially as he had those honourable Designs on his Daughter He then unbo  med the violence of his Passion to Lady  Bellaston  readily undertook the Cause and encouraged  n with certain Assurance of a most favourable Re  ption from all the Elders of the Family and from  Father himself when he should be sober and  ould be made acquainted with the Nature of the Of  made to his Daughter The only Danger she said  in the Fellow she had formerly mentioned who  ough a Beggar and a Vagabond had by some Means other she knew not what procured himself tolerable  Cloaths and past for a Gentleman  'Now says she 'as I have for the sake of my Cousin mad  it my Business to enquire after this Fellow I have luckily found out his Lodging'  with which she then acquainted his Lordship  'I am thinking m  Lord' added she 'for this Fellow is too mea  for your personal Resentment whether it would not be posible for your Lordship to contrive some Method of having him pressed and sent on board Ship Neither Law nor Conscience forbid th  Project for the Fellow I promise you howev  well drest is but a Vagabond and as proper as an Fellow in the Streets to be pressed into the Service and as for the conscientious Part surely the Pre+servation of a young Lady from such Ruin is a m  +meritorious Act nay with regard to the Fello  himself unless he could succeed which Heaven for+bid with my Cousin it may probably be the mea  of preserving him from the Gallows and perha  may make his Fortune in an honest Way'  Lord  Fellamar  very heartily thanked her Ladyshi  for the Part which she was pleased to take in the Af+fair upon the Success of which his whole futu  Happiness entirely depended He said he saw at pre+sent no Objection to the pressing Scheme and wou  consider of putting it in Execution He then m  earnestly recommended to her Ladyship to do h  the Honour of immediately mentioning his Propo  to the Family to whom he said he offered a  Ca  Blanche  and would settle his Fortune in almost a manner they should require And after uttering  +ny Extasies and Raptures concerning  Sophia  he to his leave and departed but not before he had receiv  the strongest Charge to beware of  Jones  and to  no time in securing his Person where he should longer be in a Capacity of making any Attempts the Ruin of the young Lady  The Moment Mrs  Western  was arrived at her Lodgings a Card was dispatched with her Compliments to Lady  Bellaston  who no sooner received it  han with the Impatience of a Lover she flew to her Cousin rejoiced at this fair Opportunity which be  ond her Hopes offered itself for she was much better pleased with the Prospect of making the Proposals  a Woman of Sense and who knew the World  an to a Gentleman whom she honoured with the Appellation of  Hottentot  though indeed from him  he apprehended no Danger of a Refusal  The two Ladies being met after very short pre  ous Ceremonials fell to Business which was in  eed almost as soon concluded as begun for Mrs  Western  no sooner heard the Name of Lord  Fellamar  han her Cheeks glowed with Pleasure but when she was acquainted with the Eagerness of his Passion  he Earnestness of his Proposals and the Generosity of his Offer she declared her full Satisfaction in the most explicit Terms  In the Progress of their Conversation their Discourse turned to  Jones  and both Cousins very pathe  ically lamented the unfortunate Attachment which both agreed  Sophia  had to that young Fellow and Mrs  Western  entirely attributed it to the Folly of her Brother's Management She concluded however at  ast with declaring her Confidence in the good Understanding of her Niece who though she would not give up her Affection in Favour of  Blifil  'will I doubt not' says she 'soon be prevailed upon to sacrifice  simple Inclination to the Addresses of a fine Gentleman who brings her both a Title and a large Estate For indeed' added she 'I must do  Sophy  the Justice to confess this  Blifil  is but a hideous kind of Fellow as you know  Bellaston  all Country Gentlemen are and hath nothing but his Fortune to recommend him'  '  Nay' said Lady  Bellaston  'I don't then so much wonder at my Cousin for I promise you this  Jones  is a very agreeable Fellow and hath one Virtue which the Men say is a great Recommendation to us What do you think  Bel  I shall certainly make you laugh nay I can hardly tell you myself for laughingWill you believe that the Fellow hath had the Assurance to make Love to me But i  you be inclined to disbelieve it here is Evidence enough his own Handwriting I assure you She then delivered her Cousin the Letter with the Proposals of Marriage which if the Reader hath a Desire to see he will find already on Record in the XVth Book of this History'  'Upon my Word I am astonished' said Mrs  Western  'this is indeed a Masterpiece of Assurance With your leave I may possibly make some use of this Letter'  'You have my full Liberty' cris Lady  Bellaston'  'to apply it to what Purpose you please However I would not have it shewn to any but Miss  Western  nor to her unless you find Occasion'  'Well and how did you use the Fellow'  returned Mrs  Western  'Not as a Husband' said the Lady 'I am not married I promise you my Dear You know  Bell  I have try'd the Comforts once already and once I think enough for any reasonable Woman'  This Letter Lady  Bellaston  thought would certainly turn the Ballance against  Jones  in the Mind of  Sophia  and she was emboldened to give it up partly by her Hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the way and partly by having secured the Evidence of  Honour  who upon sounding her she saw sufficient Reason to imagine was prepared to testify whatever she pleased  But perhaps the Reader may wonder why Lady  Bellaston  who in her Heart hated  Sophia  should be  so desirous of promoting a Match which was so much to the Interest of the young Lady Now I would desire such Readers to look carefully into human Nature Page almost the last and there he will find in scarce legible Characters that Women notwithstanding the preposterous Behaviour of Mothers Aunts  c  in Matrimonial Matters do in Reality think it so great a Misfortune to have their Inclinations in Love thwarted that they imagine they ought never to carry Enmity higher than upon these Disappointments again he will find it written much about the same Place that a Woman who hath once been pleased with the Possession of a Man will go above half way to the Devil to prevent any other Woman from enjoying the same  If he will not be contented with these Reasons I freely confess I see no other Motive to the Actions of that Lady unless we will conceive she was bribed by Lord  Fellamar  which for my own Part I see no Cause to suspect  Now this was the Affair which Mrs  Western  was preparing to introduce to  Sophia  by some prefatory Discourse on the Folly of Love and on the Wisdom of legal Prostitution for Hire when her Brother and  Blifil  broke abruptly upon her and hence arose all that Coldness in her Behaviour to  Blifil  which tho' the Squire as was usual with him imputed to a wrong Cause infused into  Blifil  himself he being a much more cunning Man a Suspicion of the real Truth  CHAP IX  In which  Jones  pays a Visit to Mrs  Fitzpatrick  THE Reader may now perhaps be pleased to return with us to Mr  Jones  who at the appointed Hour attended on Mrs  Fitzpatrick  but before we relate the Conversation which now past it may be  proper according to our Method to return a little back and to account for so great an Alteration of Behaviour in this Lady that from changing her Lodging principally to avoid Mr  Jones  she had now industriously as hath been seen sought this Interview  And here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding Day when hearing from Lady  Bellaston  that Mr  Western  was arrived in Town she went to pay her Duty to him at his Lodgings a  Piccadilly  when she was received with many scurvy Compellations too coarse to be repeated and was even threatned to be kicked out of Doors From hence an old Servant of her Aunt  Western  with whom she was well acquainted conducted her to the Lodgings of that Lady who treated her not more kindly but more politely or to say the Truth with Rudeness in another Way In short she returned from both plainly convinced not only that her Scheme o  Reconciliation had proved abortive but that she must for ever give over all Thoughts of bringing it about by any Means whatever From this Moment Desire of Revenge only filled her Mind and in thi  Temper meeting  Jones  at the Play an Opportunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this Purpose  The Reader must remember that he was acquainted by Mrs  Fitzpatrick  in the Account she gave o  her own Story with the Fondness Mrs  Western  had formerly shewn for Mr  Fitzpatrick  at  Bath  from the Disappointment of which Mrs  Fitzpatrick  derived the great Bitterness her Aunt had expressed toward her She had therefore no Doubt but that the good Lady would as easily listen to the Addresses o  Mr  Jones  as she had before done to the other for the Superiority of Charms was clearly on the side of Mr  Jones  and the Advance which her Aunt had  since made in Age she concluded how justly I will not say was an Argument rather in Favour of her Project than against it  Therefore when  Jones  attended after a previous Declaration of her Desire of serving him arising as she said from a Firm Assurance how much she should by so doing oblige  Sophia  and after some Excuses for her former Disappointment and after acquainting Mr  Jones  in whose Custody his Mistress was of which she thought him ignorant she very explicitly mentioned her Scheme to him and advised him to make Sham Addresses to the older Lady in order to procure an easy Access to the Younger informing him at the same Time of the Success which Mr  Fitzpatrick  had formerly owed to the very same Stratagem  Mr  Jones  exprest great Gratitude to the Lady for the kind Intentions towards him which she had expressed and indeed testified by this Proposal but besides intimating some Diffidence of Success from the Lady's Knowledge of his Love to her Neice which had not been her Case in regard to Mr  Fitzpatrick  he said he was afraid Miss  Western  would never agree to an Imposition of this Kind as well from her utter Detestation of all Fallacy as from her avowed Duty to her Aunt  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  was a little nettled at this and indeed if it may not be called a Lapse of the Tongue it was a small Deviation from Politeness in  Jones  and into which he would scarce have fallen had not the Delight he felt in praising  Sophia  hurried him out of all Reflection for this Commendation of one Cousin was more than a tacit Rebuke on the other  'Indeed Sir' answered the Lady with some Warmth 'I cannot think there is any thing easier than to cheat an old Woman with a Profession of  Love when her Complexion is amorous and tho' she is my Aunt I must say there never was a more liquorish one than her Ladyship Can't you pretend that the Despair of possessing her Neice from her being promised to  Blifil  has made you turn your Thoughts towards her As to my Cousin  Sophia  I can't imagine her to be such a Simpleton as to have the least Scruple on such an Account or to conceive any Harm in punishing one of these Haggs for the many Mischiefs they bring upon Families by their Tragi comic Passions for which I think it is pity they were not punishable by Law I had no such Scruple myself and yet I hope my Cousin  Sophia  will not think it an Affront when I say she cannot detest every real Species of Falshood more than her Cousin  Fitzpatrick  To my Aunt indeed I pretend no Duty nor doth she deserve any However Sir I have given you my Advice and if you decline pursuing it I shall have the less Opinion of your Understanding that's all'  Jones  now clearly saw the Error he had committed and exerted his utmost Power to rectify it but he only faultered and fluttered into Nonsense and Contradiction To say the Truth it is often safer to abide by the Consequences of the first Blunder than to endeavour to rectify it for by such Endeavours we generally plunge deeper instead of extricating ourselves and few Persons will on such Occasions have the good Nature which Mrs  Fitzpatrick  display'd to  Jones  by saying with a Smile  'You need attempt no more Excuses for I can easily forgive a real Lover whatever is the Effect of Fondness for his Mistress'  She then renewed her Proposal and very fervently recommended it omitting no Argument which her Invention could suggest on the Subject for she was so violently incensed against her Aunt that scarce any Thing was capable of affording her equal Pleasure  with exposing her and like a true Woman she would see no Difficulties in the Execution of a favou  ite Scheme  Jones  however persisted in declining the Undertaking which had not indeed the least Probability of Success He easily perceived the Motives which in  uced Mrs  Fitzpatrick  to be so eager in pressing her Advice He said he would not deny the tender and  assionate Regard he had for  Sophia  but was so con  tious of the Inequality of their Situations that he  ould never flatter himself so far as to hope that so  ivine a young Lady would condescend to think on  ne so unworthy nay he protested he could scarce  ring himself to wish she should He concluded with  Profession of generous Sentiments which we have  ot at present Leisure to insert  There are some fine Women for I dare not here  peak in too general Terms with whom Self is so  redominant that they never detach it from any Sub  ect and as Vanity is with them a ruling Principle  hey are apt to lay hold of whatever Praise they meet with and though the Property of others convey  to their own Use In the Company of these La  ies it is impossible to say any thing handsome of another Woman which they will not apply to themselves nay they often improve the Praise they seize  s for Instance if her Beauty her Wit her Gentili  y her good Humour deserve so much Commenda  ion what do I deserve who possess those Qualities  so much more eminent a Degree  To these Ladies a Man often recommends himself while he is commending another Woman and while he is expressing Ardour and generous Sentiments for his Mistress they are considering what a  harming Lover this Man would make to them who  an feel all this Tenderness for an inferiour Degree of Merit Of this strange as it may seem I have  seen many Instances besides Mrs  Fitzpatrick  to whom all this really happened and who now began to feel a somewhat for Mr  Jones  the Symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor  Sophia  had formerly done  To say the Truth perfect Beauty in both Sexes is a more irresistible Object than it is generally thought for notwithstanding some of us are contented with more homely Lots and learn by Rot  as Children to repeat what gives them no Idea to despise Outside and to value more solid Charms yet I have always observed at the Approach of consummate Beauty that these more solid Charms only shine with that Kind of Lustre which the Stars have after the rising of the Sun  When  Jones  had finished his Exclamations many of which would have become the Mouth of  Oroondates  himself Mrs  Fitzpatrick  heaved a deep Sigh and taking her Eyes off from  Jones  on whom they had been some time fixed and dropping them on the Ground she cry'd  'Indeed Mr  Jones  I pity you but it is the Curse of such Tenderness to be thrown away on those who are insensible of it I know my Cousin better than you Mr  Jones  and I must say any Woman who makes no Return to such a Passion and such a Person is unworthy of both'  'Sure Madam  said  Jones  you can't mean'  'Mean cries Mrs  Fitzpatrick  I know not what  mean there is something I think in true Tenderness bewitching few Women ever meet with it in Men and fewer still know how to value it when they do I never heard such truly noble Sentiments and can't tell how it is but you force one to believe you Sure she must be the most contemptible o  Women who can overlook such Merit'  The Manner and Look with which all this wa  spoke infused a Suspicion into  Jones  which we don'  care to convey in direct Words to the Reader Instead  of making any Answer he said  'I am afraid Madam I have made too tiresome a Visit'  and offered to take his Leave  'Not at all Sir' answered Mrs  Fitzpatrick  'Indeed I pity you Mr  Jones  Indeed I do but if you are going consider of the Scheme I have mentioned I am convinced you will approve of it and let me see you again as soon as you canTomorrow Morning if you will or at least some time tomorrow I shall be at Home all Day'  Jones  then after many Expressions of Thanks very respectfully retired nor could Mrs  Fitzpatrick  forbear making a present of a Look at parting by which if he had understood nothing he must have had no Understanding in the Language of the Eyes In Reality it confirmed his Resolution of returning to her no more for faulty as he hath appeared in this History his whole Thoughts were now so confined to his  Sophia  that I believe no Woman upon Earth could have now drawn him into an Act of Inconstancy  Fortune however who was not his Friend resolved as he intended to give her no second Opportunity to make the best of this and accordingly produced the tragical Incident which we are now in sorrowful Notes to record  CHAP X  The Consequence of the preceding Visit  MR  Fitzpatrick  having received the Letter beforementioned from Mrs  Western  and being by that Means acquainted with the Place to which his Wife was retired returned directly to  Bath  and thence the Day afterwards set forward to  London  The Reader hath been already often informed of the jealous Temper of this Gentleman He may  likewise be pleased to remember the Suspicion which he had at  Upton  conceived of  Jones  upon his finding him in the Room with Mrs  Waters  and though sufficient Reasons had afterwards appeared entirely to clear that Suspicion yet now reading so handsome a Character of Mr  Jones  from his Wife caused him to reflect that she likewise was in the Inn at the same Time and jumbled together such a Confusion o  Circumstances in a Head which was naturally none o  the clearest that the whole produced that greeney'  Monster mentioned by  Shakespear  in his Tragedy o  Othello  And now as he was enquiring in the Street after his Wife and had just received Directions to the Door unfortunately Mr  Jones  was issuing from it  Fitzpatrick  did not yet recollect the Face of  Jones  however seeing a young welldressed Fellow comin  from his Wife he made directly up to him and ask+ed him what he had been doing in that House  'Fo  I am sure said he you must have been in it as saw you come out of it'  Jones  answered very modestly  'That he had been visiting a Lady there'  To which  Fitzpatrick  re+plied  'What Business have you with the Lady'  Upon which  Jones  who now perfectly remembre  the Voice Features and indeed Coat of the Gentle+man cried out  'Ha my good Friend give m  your Hand I hope there is no ill Blood remaining between us upon a small Mistake which happene  so long ago'  'Upon my Soul Sir said  Fitzpatrick  I don  know your Name nor your Face' Indeed Si  said  Jones  neither have I the Pleasure of knowing your Name but your Face I very well remember to have seen before at  Upton  where a foolish Quar+rel happened between us which if it is not mad  up yet we will now makeup over a Bottle'  'At  Upton  cried the other    'Ha upon my Soul I believe your Name is  Jones'  'Indeed' answered he 'it is'    'O upon my Soul cries  Fitzpatrick  you are the very Man I wanted to meetUpon my Soul I will drink a Bottle with you presently but first I will give you a great Knock over the Pate There is for you you Rascal Upon my Soul if you do not give me Satisfaction for that Blow I will give you another'  And then drawing his word puts himself in a Posture of Defence which as the only Science he understood  Jones  was a little staggered by the Blow which came me what unexpectedly but presently recovering himself he also drew and tho' he understood nothing  f Fencing prest on so boldly upon  Fitzpatrick  that he  at down his Guard and sheathed one half of his word in the Body of the said Gentleman who had  sooner received it than he stept backwards dropt  e Point of his Sword and leaning upon it cried  'I have Satisfaction enough I am a dead Man'  I hope not cries  Jones  but whatever be the Consequence you must be sensible you have drawn it upon yourself At this Instant a Number of Fellows rushed in and seized  Jones  who told them he should make no Resistance and begged some of them at least would take Care of the wounded Gentleman'  'Ay cries one of the Fellows the wounded Gentleman will be taken Care enough of for I suppose he hath not many Hours to live As for you Sir you have a Month at least good yet'  'Dn me  Jack  said another he hath prevented his Voyage  he's bound to another Port now'  and many other  Jests was our poor  Jones  made the Subject of by  ese Fellows who were indeed the Gang employed Lord  Fellamar  and had dogged him into the House Mrs  Fitzpatrick  waiting for him at the Corner of  e Street when this unfortunate Accident happened  The Officer who commanded this Gang very wise+ly concluded that his Business was now to deliver his Prisoner into the Hands of the Civil Magistrate H  ordered him therefore to be carried to a publick House where having sent for a Constable he delivered him to his Custody  The Constable seeing Mr  Jones  very well dres  and hearing that the Accident had happened in a Due  treated his Prisoner with great Civility and at hi  Request dispatched a Messenger to enquire after th  wounded Gentleman who was now at a Tavern un+der the Surgeon's Hands The Report brought bac  was that the Wound was certainly mortal and the  were no Hopes of Life Upon which the Constabl  informed  Jones  that he must go before a Justice▪ He answered Wherever you please I am indifferen  as to what happens to me for tho' I am convince  I am not guilty of Murder in the Eye of the Law yet the Weight of Blood I find intolerable upon m  Mind  Jones  was now conducted before the Justice when the Surgeon who drest Mr  Fitzpatrick  appeared an deposed that he believed the Wound to be mortal upon which the Prisoner was committed to the  Gat  house  It was very late at Night so that  Jones  would not send for  Partridge  till the next Morning and as he never shut his Eyes till seven so it was ne  twelve before the poor Fellow who was great frightned at not hearing from his Master so long re+ceived a Message which almost deprived him of  Being when he heard it  He went to the  Gatehouse  with trembling Kne  and a beating Heart and was no sooner arrived in t  Presence of  Jones  than he lamented the Misfortune that had befallen him with many Tears looking the while frequently about him in great Terror f  as the News now arrived that Mr  Fitzpatrick  w  dead the poor Fellow apprehended every Minute that  s Ghost would enter the Room At last he delivered him a Letter which he had like to have forgot  d which came from  Sophia  by the Hands of black  eorge  Jones  presently dispatched every one out of the  oom and having eagerly broke open the Letter  ad as follows  You owe the hearing from me again to an Accident which I own surprizes me My Aunt hath just now shewn me a Letter from you to Lady  Bellaston  which contains a Proposal of Marriage I am convinced it is your own Hand and what more surprizes me is that it is dated at the very Time when you would have me imagine you was under such Concern on my AccountI leave you to comment on this Fact All I desire is that your Name may never more be mentioned to  S W  Of the present Situation of Mr  Jones'  s Mind and the Pangs with which he was now tormented  e cannot give the Reader a better Idea than by say  g his Misery was such that even  Thwackum  would most have pitied him But bad as it is we shall at  esent leave him in it as his good genius if he really  d any seems to have done And here we put an  d to the sixteenth Book of our History  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK XVII  Containing three Days  CHAP I  Containing a Portion of introductory Writing  WHEN a Comic Writer hath made his prin+cipal Characters as happy as he can or whe  a Tragic Writer hath brought them to th  highest Pitch of human Misery they both conclud  their Business to be done and that their Work i  come to a Period  Had we been of the Tragic Complexion the Reade  must allow we were now very nearly arrived at this Pe+riod since it would be difficult for the Devil or any of his Representatives on earth to have contrived much greater Torments for poor  Jones  than those to which we left him in the last Chapter and as for  Sophia  goodnatured Woman would hardly wish more Un  asiness to a Rival than what she must at present be  pposed to feel What then remains to complete  e Tragedy but a Murder or two and a few moral  entences  But to bring our Favourites out of their present  nguish and Distress and to land them at last on the  ore of Happiness seems a much harder Task a  ask indeed so hard that we do not undertake to exe  ute it In Regard to  Sophia  it is more than proba  e that we shall somewhere or other provide a good  usband for her in the End either  Blifil  or my  ord or Somebody else but as to poor  Jones  such  e the Calamities in which he is at present involved  wing to his Imprudence by which if a Man doth  t become a Felon to the World he is at least a  h de se  so destitute is he now of Friends and so  ersecuted by Enemies that we almost despair of  inging him to any good and if our Reader de  ghts in seeing Executions I think he ought not to  e any time in taking a first Row at  Tyburn  This I faithfully promise that notwithstanding any  ffection which we may be supposed to have for this  ogue whom we have unfortunately made our He  e we will lend him none of that supernatural Assis  nce with which we are entrusted upon Condition  we use it only on very important Occasions  he doth not therefore find some natural Means of  extricating himself from all his Distresses we  ill do no Violence to the Truth and Dignity of His  y for his Sake for we had rather relate that he  as hanged at  Tyburn  which may very probably be  e Case than forfeit our Integrity or shock the Faith of our Reader  In this the Antients had a great Advantage over  Moderns Their Mythology which was at that  more firmly believed by the Vulgar than any  eligion is at present gave them always an Opportunity  of delivering a favourite Heroe Their Deitie  were always ready at the Writer's Elbow to execut  any of his Purposes and the more extraordinary th  Invention was the greater was the Surprize and Deligh  of the Credulous Reader Those Writers could with greater Ease have conveyed a Friend from one Country to another nay from one World to another and have brought him back again than a poor circumscribe  Modern can deliver him from a Goal  The  Arabians  and  Persians  had an equal Advan+tage in Writing their Tales from the  Genii  and  Fa  +ries  which the believe in as an Article of their Faith upon the Authority of  Koran  itself To natura  Means alone we are confined let us try therefor  what by these Means may be done for poor  Jones  though to confess the Truth something whispers m  in the Ear that he doth not yet know the worst of hi  Fortune and that a more shocking Piece of New than any he hath yet heard remains for him in the un opened Leaves of Fate  CHAP II  The generous and grateful Behaviour of Mrs  Miller  MR  Allworthy  and Mrs  Miller  were just sat dow  to Breakfast when  Blifil  who had gone o  very early that Morning returned to make one of th  Company  He had not been long seated before he began  follows  'Good Lord my dear Uncle what do yo  think hath happened I vow I am afraid of telling you for fear of shocking you with the Remem+brance of ever having shewn any Kindness to suc  a Villain' 'What is the Matter Child said th  Uncle I fear I have shewn Kindness in my Li  to the Unworthy more than once But Chari  doth not adopt the Vices of its Objects'  'O Si  returned  Blifil  it is not without the secret Direct  on of Providence that you mentioned the Word Adoption Your adopted Son Sir that  Jones  that Wretch whom you nourished in your Bosom hath proved one of the greatest Villains upon Earth'  'By all that's sacred 'tis false cries Mrs  Miller  Mr  Jones  is no Villain He is one of the worthiest Creatures breathing and if any other Person had called him Villain I would have thrown all this boiling water in his Face'  Mr  Allworthy  ooked very much amazed at this Behaviour But  e did not give him Leave to speak before turn  ng to him she cry'd  'I hope you will not be angry with me I would not offend you Sir for the World but indeed I could not bear to hear him called so'  'I must own Madam' said  Allworthy  very gravely 'I am a little surprized to hear you so warmly defend a Fellow you do not know'  'O I do know him Mr  Allworthy'  said she 'indeed I do I should be the most ungrateful of all Wretches if I denied it O he hath preserved me and my little Family we have all Reason to bless him and turn the Hearts of his malicious Enemies I know I find I see he hath such'  'You surprize me Madam still more' said  Allworthy  sure you must mean some other It is impossible you should have any such Obligations to the Man my Nephew mentions'  'Too surely' answered he 'I have Obligations to him of the greatest and tenderest Kind He hath been the Preserver of me and mineBelieve me Sir he hath been abused grosly abused to you I know he hath or you whom I know to be all Goodness and Honour would not after the many kind and tender Things I have heard you say of this poor helpless Child have so disdainfully called him Fellow Indeed my best of Friends he deserves a kinder Appellation from you had you heard the good the kind the grateful Things which I have heard him  utter of you he never mentions your name but with a Sort of Adoration In this very Room I have seen him on his Knees imploring all the Blessings of Heaven upon your Head I do not love that Child there better than he loves you'  'I see Sir' said  Blifil  with one of those grinning Sneers with which the Devil marks his bes  Beloved 'Mrs  Miller  really doth know him  suppose you will find she is not the only one of you  Acquaintance to whom he hath exposed you A  for my Character I perceive by some Hints she hath thrown out he hath been very free with it but I forgive him' 'And the Lord forgive you Sir' says Mrs  Miller  'we have all Sins enough to stand in Need of his Forgiveness'  'Upon my Word Mrs  Miller'  said  Allworthy  'I do not take this Behaviour of yours to my Nephew kindly and I do assure you as any Reflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest of Men they would only serve if that were possible to heighten my Resentment against him For I must tell you Mrs  Miller  the young Man who now stands before you hath ever been the warmest Advocate for the ungratefu  Wretch whose Cause you espouse This I think when you hear it from my own Mouth wil  make you wonder at so much Baseness and Ingra+titude'  'You are deceived Sir' answered Mrs  Miller  'if they were the last Words which were to issue from my Lips I would say you were deceived and I once more repeat it the Lord forgive those who have deceived you I do not pretend to say the young Man is without Faults but they are the Faults of Wildness and of Youth Faults which he may nay which I am certain he will relinquish  and if he should not they are vastly overballance  by one of the most humane tender honest Hearts that ever Man was blessed with'  'Indeed Mrs  Miller  said  Allworthy  had this been related of you I should not have believed it' Indeed Sir answered she you will believe every Thing I have said I am sure you will and when you have heard the Story which I shall tell you for I will tell you all you will be so far from being offended that you will own I know your Justice so well that I must have been the most despicable and most ungrateful of Wretches if I had acted any other Part than I have'  'Well Madam said  Allworthy  I shall be very glad to hear any good Excuse for a Behaviour which I must confess I think wants an Excuse And now Madam will you be pleased to let my Nephew proceed in his Story without Interruption He would not have introduced a Matter of slight Consequence with such a Preface Perhaps even this Story will cure you of your Mistake'  Mrs  Miller  gave Tokens of Submission and then Mr  Blifil  began thus  'I am sure Sir if you don't think proper to resent the ill Usage of Mrs  Miller  I shall easily forgive what affects me only I think your Goodness hath not deserved this Indignity at her Hands'  'Well Child said  Allworthy  but what is this new Instance What hath he done of late'  'What cries  Blifil  notwithstanding all Mrs  Miller  hath said I am very sorry to relate and what you should never have heard from me had it not been a Matter impossible to conceal from the whole World In short he hath killed a Man I will not say murderedfor perhaps it may not be so construed in Law and I hope the best for his Sake'  '  Allworthy  looked shocked and blessed himself and then turning to Mrs  Miller  he cried 'Well Madam what say you now'  'Why I say Sir answered she that I neve  was more concerned at any Thing in my Life but if the Fact be true I am convinced the Man wh  ever he is was in Fault Heaven knows there ar  many Villains in this Town who make it thei  Business to provoke young Gentlemen Nothing but the greatest Provocation could have tempte  him for of all the Geetlemen I ever had in my House I never saw one so gentle or so sweettem+pered He was beloved by every one in the House and every one who came near it'  While she was thus running on a violent Knock+ing at the Door interrupted the Conversation and pre+vented her from proceeding any further or from re+ceiving any Answer for as she concluded this wa  a Visiter to Mr  Allworthy  she hastily retired taking with her her little Girl whose Eyes were all ove  blubbered at the melancholy News she heard of  Jones  who used to call her his little Wife and not only gave her many Playthings but spent whole Hours in playing with her himself  Some Readers may perhaps be pleased with these minute Circumstances in relating of which we follow the Example of  Plutarch  one of the best of ou  Brother Historians and others to whom they may appear trivial will we hope at least pardon them as we are never prolix on such Occasions  CHAP III  The Arrival of Mr  Western  with some Matters concerning the Paternal Authority  MRS  Miller  had not long left the Room when Mr  Western  entered but not before a small wrangling Bout had pass'd between him and his Chairmen for the Fellows who had taken up their Burden at the  Hercules Pillars  had conceived no Hopes of having any future good Customer in the Squire and  they were moreover farther encouraged by his Generosity for he had given them of his own Accord Sixpence more than their Fare they therefore very boldly demanded another Shilling which so provoked the Squire that he not only bestowed many hear  y Curses on them at the Door but retained his Anger after he came into the Room swearing that all the  Londoners  were like the Court and thought of nothing but plundering Country Gentlemen  'Dn me says he if I won't walk in the Rain rather than get into one of their Handbarrows again They have jolted me more in a Mile than Brown Bess would in a long Fox Chase'  When his Wrath on this Occasion was a little appeased he resumed the same passionate Tone on another  'There says he there is fine Business forwards now The Hounds have changed at last and when we imagined we had a Fox to deal with Odratit it turns out to be a Badger at last'  'Pray my good Neighbour said  Allworthy  drop your Metaphors and speak a little plainer' 'Why then says the Squire to tell you plainly we have been all this Time afraid of a Son of a Whore of a Bastard of SomeBody's I don't know who's not IAnd now here is a confounded Son of a Whore of a Lord who may be a Bastard too for ought I know or care for he shall never have a Daughter of mine by my Consent They have beggared the Nation but they shall never beggar me My Land shall never be sent over to  Hannover  '  'You surprize me much my good Friend said  Allworthy'  'Why zounds I am surprized myself answered the Squire I went to zee Sister  Western  last Night according to her own Appointment and there I was a had into a whole Roomfull of WomenThere was my Lady Cousin  Bellaston  and my Lady  Betty  and my Lady  Catharine  and  my Lady I don't know who dn me if ever yo  catch me among such a Kennel of Hooppettico  Bs Dn me I'd rather be run by m  own Dogs as one  Acton  was that the Story Book says was turned into a Hare and his own Dogs kill'd un and eat un Odrabbetit no Morta  was ever run in such a Manner if I dodged on Way one had me if I offered to clap back ano+ther snap'd me O certainly one of the greate Matches in  England  says one Cousin here he at+tempted to mimic them A very advantagious Of+fer indeed cries another Cousin for you mu  know they be all my Cousins thof I never zee  half oum before'  'Surely says that fat a▪ B my Lady  Bellaston  Cousin you must be ou  of your Wits to think of refusing such an Offer'  'Now I begin to understand says  Allworthy  som  Person hath made Proposals to Miss  Western  which the Ladies of the Family approve but is not t  your Liking'  'My Liking said  Western  how the Devil should it I tell you it is a Lord and those are alway  Volks whom you know I always resolved to have nothing to do with Did unt I refuse a matter  +vorty Years Purchase now for a Bit of Land which one oum had a Mind to put into a Park only be+cause I would have no Dealing with Lords and do think I would marry my Daughter zu Besides ben't I engaged to you and did I ever go off an Bargain when I had promised'  'As to that Point Neighbour said  Allworthy  entirely release you from any Engagement N  Contract can be binding between Parties who have not a full Power to make it at that Time nor eve  afterwards acquire the Power of fulfilling it'  'Slud then answered  Western  I tell you I have Power and I will fulfil it Come along with m  directly to  Doctors Commons  I will get a Licence  and I will go to Sister and take away the Wench by Force and she shall ha un or I will lock her up and keep her upon Bread and Water as long as she lives'  'Mr  Western  said  Allworthy  shall I beg you will hear my full Sentiments on this Matter'  'Hear thee ay to be sure I will answered he'  'Why then Sir cries  Allworthy  I can truly say without a Compliment either to you or to the young Lady that when this Match was proposed I embraced it very readily and heartily from my Regard to you both An Alliance between two Families so nearly Neighbours and between whom there had always existed so mutual an Intercourse and good Harmony I thought a most desireable Event and with Regard to the young Lady not only the concurrent Opinion of all who knew her but my own Observation assured me that she would be an inestimable Treasure to a good Husband I shall say nothing of her personal Qualifications which certainly are admirable her Goodnature her charitable Disposition her Modesty are too well known to need any Panegyric but she hath one Quality which existed in a high Degree in that best of Women who is now one of the first Angels which as it is not of a glaring Kind more commonly escapes Observation so little indeed is it remarked that I want a Word to express it I must use Negatives on this Occasion I never heard any thing of Pertness or what is called a Repartee out of her Mouth no Pretence to Wit much less to that Kind of Wisdom which is the Result only of great Learning and Experience the Affectation of which in a Woman is as absurd as any of the Affectations of an Ape No dictatorial Sentiments no judicial Opinions no profound Criticisms Whenever I have seen her in the Company of Men she hath been all Attention with the Modesty of a Learner  not the Forwardness of a Teacher You'  pardon me for it but I once to try her only de+sired her Opinion on a Point which was controvert+ed between Mr  Thwackum  and  Square  '  To which she answered with much Sweetness  'You will pardon me good Mr  Allworthy  I am sure yo  cannot in Earnest think me capable of deciding any Point in which two such Gentlemen disagree'  Thwackum  and  Square  who both alike though themselves sure of a favourable Decision seconded my Request She answered with the same good Humour  'I must absolutely be excused for I will affront neither so much as to give my Judgment on his Side'  'Indeed she always shewed the high+est Deference to the Understanding of Men a Quality absolutely essential to the making a good Wife I shall only add that as she is most apparently void of all Affectation this Deference must be certainly real'  Here  Blifil  sighed bitterly upon which  Western  whose Eyes were full of Tears at the Praise of  So+phia  blubbered out  'Don't be Chickenhearted for shat ha her dn me shat ha her if she was twenty Times as good'  'Remember your Promise Sir cried  Allworthy  I was not to be interrupted'  'Well shat unt answered the Squire I won't speak another Word'  'Now my good Friend' continued  Allworthy  I have dwelt so long on the Merit of this young Lady partly as I really am in Love with her Character and partly that Fortune for the Match in that Light is really advantageous on my Nephew's Side might not be imagined to be my principal View in having so eagerly embraced the Proposal Indeed I heartily wished to receive so great a Jewel into my Family but tho' I may wish for many good Things I would not therefore steal them o  be guilty of any Violence or Injustice to possess  myself of them Now to force a Woman into a Marriage contrary to her consent or Approbation is an Act of such Injustice and Oppression that I wish the Laws of our Country could restrain it but a good Conscience is never lawless in the worst regulated State and will provide those Laws for itself which the Neglect of Legislators hath forgotten to supply This is surely a Case of that Kind for is it not cruel nay impious to force a Woman into that State against her Will for her Behaviour in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most dreadful Court of Judicature and to answer at the Peril of her Soul To discharge the Matrimonial Duties in an adequate Manner is no easy Task and shall we lay this Burthen upon a Woman while we at the same Time deprive her of all that Assistance which may enable her to undergo it Shall we tear her very Heart from her while we enjoin her Duties to which a whole Heart is scarce equal I must speak very plainly here I think Parents who act in this Manner are Accessaries to all the Guilt which their Children afterwards incur and of Course must before a just Judge expect to partake of their Punishment but if they could avoid this good Heaven is there a Soul who can bear the Thought of having contributed to the Damnation of his Child'  'For these Reasons my best Neighbour as I see the Inclinations of this young Lady are most unhappily averse to my Nephew I must decline any further Thoughts of the Honour you intended him tho' I assure you I shall always retain the most grateful Sense of it'  'Well Sir said  Western  the Froth bursting forth from his Lips the Moment they were uncorked you cannot say but I have heard you out and now I expect you'll hear me and if I don't answer every Word o't why then I'll consent to gee the Matter  up First then I desire you to answer me one Question Did not I beget her Did not I beget her answer me that They say indeed it is a wise Father that knows his own Child but I am sure I have the best Title to her for I bred her up But I believe you will allow me to be her Father and if I be am not I to govern my own Child I ask you that am I not to govern my own Child And if I am to govern her in other Matters surely I am to govern her in this which concerns her most And what am I desiring all this while Am I desiring her to do any Thing for me To give me any+thing'    'Zu much on t'other Side that I am only desiring her to take half my Estate now and t'other half when I die Well and what is it all vor Why is unt it to make her happy It's enough to make one mad to hear Volks talk if I was going to marry myself then she would ha Reason to cry and to blubber but on the contrary han't I offered to bind down my Land in zuch a Manner that I could not marry if I would seeing as narro' Woman upon Earth would ha me What the Devil in Hell can I do more I contribute to her DamnationZounds I'd zee all the World dd bevore her little Vinger should be hurt Indeed Mr  Allworthy  you must excuse me but I am surprized to hear you talk in zuch a Manner and I must say take it how you will that I thought you had more Sense'  Allworthy  resented this Reflection only with a Smile nor could he if he would have endeavoured it have conveyed into that Smile any Mixture of Malice or Contempt His Smiles at Folly were indeed such as we may suppose the Angels bestow on the Absurdities of Mankind  Blifil  now desired to be permitted to speak a few Words  'As to using any Violence on the young  Lady I am sure I shall never consent to it My Conscience will not permit me to use Violence on any one much less on a Lady for whom however cruel she is to me I shall always preserve the purest and sincerest Affection but yet I have read that Women are seldom Proof against Perseverance Why may I not hope then by such Perseverance at last to gain those Inclinations in which for the future I shall perhaps have no Rival for as for this Lord Mr  Western  is so kind to prefer me to him and sure Sir you will not deny but that a Parent hath at least a negative Voice in these Matters nay I have heard this very young Lady herself say so more than once and declare that she thought Children inexcusable who married in direct Opposition to the Will of their Parents Besides though the other Ladies of the Family seem to favour the Pretensions of my Lord I do not find the Lady herself is inclined to give him any Countenance alas I am too sensible that wickedest of Men remains uppermost in her Heart'  'Ay ay so he does cries  Western  '  'But surely says  Blifil  when she hears of this Murder which he hath committed if the Law should spare his Life'  'What's that cries  Western  Murder hath he committed a Murder and is there any Hopes of seeing him hangedTol de rol tol lol de rol  Here he fell a singing and capering about the Room  'Child says  Allworthy  this unhappy Passion of yours distresses me beyond Measure I heartily pity you and would do every fair Thing to promote your Success'  'I desire no more' cries  Blifil  'I am convinced my dear Uncle hath a better Opinion of me than to think that I myself wou'd accept of more'  'Lookee' says  Allworthy  'you have my Leave  to write to visit if she will permit itbut I insist on no Thoughts of Violence I will have no Confinement nothing of that Kind attempted'  'Well well cries the Squire 'nothing of that shall be attempted we will try a little longer what fair Means will effect and if this Fellow be but hanged out of theTol lol de rol I never heard better News in my Life I warrant every Thing goes to my MindDo prithee dear  Allworthy  come and dine with me at the  Hercules Pillars  I have bespoke a Shoulder of Mutton roasted and a Sparerib of Pork and a Fowl and EggSauce There will be Nobody but ourselves unless we have a Mind to have the Landlord for I have sent Parson  Supple  down to  Basingstoke  after my Tobacco Box which I left at an Inn there and I would not lose it for the World for it's an old Acquaintance of above Twenty Years standing I can tell you Landlord is a vast comical Bitch you will like un hugely'  Mr  Allworthy  at last agreed to this Invitation and soon after the Squire went off singing and capering at the Hopes of seeing the speedy tragical End of poor  Jones  When he was gone Mr  Allworthy  resumed the aforesaid Subject with much Gravity He told his Nephew  'he wished with all his Heart he would endeavour to conquer a Passion in which I cannot' says he 'flatter you with the Hopes of succeeding It is certainly a vulgar Error that Aversion in a Woman may be conquered by Perseverance Indifference may Perhaps sometimes yield to it but the usual Triumphs gained by Perseverance in a Lover are over Caprice Prudence Affectation and often an exorbitant Degree of Levity which excites Women not overwarm in their Constitutions to indulge their Vanity by prolonging the Time of Courtship even when they are well enough pleased with the Object and resolve if they  ever resolve at all to make him a very pitiful Amends in the End But a fixed Dislike as I am afraid this is will rather gather Strength than be conquered by Time Besides my dear I have another Apprehension which you must excuse I am afraid this Passion which you have for this fine young Creature hath her beautiful Person too much for its Object and is unworthy of the Name of that Love which is the only Foundation of matrimonial Felicity To admire to like and to long for the Possession of a beautiful Woman without any Regard to her Sentiments towards us is I am afraid too natural But Love I believe is the Child of Love only at least I am pretty confident that to love the Creature who we are assured hates us is not in Human Nature Examine your Heart therefore thoroughly my good Boy and if upon Examination you have but the least Suspicion of this Kind I am sure your own Virtue and Religion will impel you to drive so vicious a Passion from your Heart and your good Sense will soon enable you to do it without Pain'  The Reader may pretty well guess  Blifil'  s Answer but if he should be at a Loss we are not at present at Leisure to satisfy him as our History now hastens on to Matters of higher Importance and we cannot longer bear to be absent from  Sophia  CHAP IV  An extraordinary Scene betwen  Sophia  and her Aunt  THE lowing Heifer and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks may ramble safe and unregarded through the Pastures These are indeed hereafter doomed to be the Prey of Man yet many Years are they suffered to enjoy their Liberty undisturbed But if a plump Doe be discovered to have escaped  from the Forest and to repose herself in some Field or Grove the whole Parish is presently alarmed every Man is ready to set his Dogs after her and if she is preserved from the rest by the good Squire it is only that he may secure her for his own eating  I have considered a very fine young Woman of Fortune and Fashion when first found strayed from the Pale of her Nursery to be in pretty much the same Situation with this Doe The Town is immediately in an Uproar she is hunted from Park to Play from Court to Assembly from Assembly to her own Chamber and rarely escapes a single Season from the Jaws of some Devourer or other For if her Friends protect her from some it is only to deliver her over to one of their own chusing often more disagreeable to her than any of the rest While whole Herds on Flocks of other Women securely and scarce regarded traverse the Park the Play the Opera and the Assembly and though for the most Part at least they are at last devoured yet for a long Time do they wanton in Liberty without Disturbance or Controul  Of all these Paragons none ever tasted more of this Persecution than poor  Sophia  Her ill Stars were not contented with all that she had suffered on Account of  Blifil  they now raised her another Pursuer who seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done For though her Aunt was less violent she was no less assiduous in teazing her than her Father had been before  The Servants were no sooner departed after Dinner than Mrs  Western  who had opened the Matter to  Sophia  informed her  'That she expected his Lordship that very afternoon and intended to take the first Opportunity of leaving her alone with him'  'If you do Madam' answered  Sophia  with some Spirit 'I shall take the first Opportunity of leaving him by himself'  ' 'How Madam' cries the Aunt  is this the Return you make me for my Kindness in relieving you from your Confinement at your Father's'  'You know Madam' said  Sophia  'the Cause of that Confinement was a Refusal to comply with my Father in accepting a Man I detested and will my dear Aunt who hath relieved me from that Distress involve me in another equally bad'  'And do you think then Madam' answered Mrs  Western  'that there is no Difference between my Lord  Fellamar  and Mr  Blifil'  'Very little in my Opinion' cries  Sophia  'and if I must be condemned to one I would certainly have the Merit of sacrificing myself to my Father's Pleasure'  'Then my Pleasure I find' said the Aunt 'hath very little Weight with you but that consideration shall not move me I act from nobler Motives The View of aggrandizing my Family of ennobling yourself is what I proceed upon Have you no Sense of Ambition Are there no Charms in the Thoughts of having a Coronet on your Coach'  'None upon my Honour' said  Sophia  'A Pincushion upon my Coach would please me just as well'  'Never mention Honour' cries the Aunt 'It becomes not the Mouth of such a Wretch I am sorry Neice you force me to use these Words but I cannot bear your groveling Temper you have none of the Blood of the  Westerns  in you But however mean and base your own Ideas are you shall bring no Imputation on mine I will never suffer the World to say of me that I encouraged you in refusing one of the best Matches in  England  a Match which besides its Advantage in Fotrune would do Honour to almost any Family and hath indeed in Title the Advantage of ours'  'Surely' says  Sophia  'I am born deficient and have not the Senses with which other People are blessed There must be certainly some Sense which can relish the Delights of Sound and Show which I have not For surely Mankind  would not labour so much nor sacrifice so much for obtaining nor would they be so elate and proud with possessing what appeared to them as it doth to me the most insignificant of all Trifles'  'No no Miss' cries the Aunt 'you are born with as many Senses as other People but I assure you you are not born with a sufficient Understanding to make a Fool of me or to expose my Conduct to the World So I declare this to you upon my Word and you know I believe how fixed my Resolutions are unless you agree to see his Lordship this Afternoon I will with my own Hands deliver you Tomorrow Morning to my Brother and will never henceforth interfere with you no  see your Face again'  Sophia  stood a few Moments silent after this Speech which was uttered in a most angry and Peremptory Tone and then bursting into Tears she cry'd  'Do with me Madam whatever you please I am the most miserable undone Wretch upon Earth and if my dear Aunt forsakes me where shall I look for a ProtectorMy dear Neice' cries she 'you will have a very good Protector in his Lordship a Protector whom nothing but a Hankering after that vile Fellow  Jones  can make you decline'  'Indeed Madam' said  Sophia  'you wrong me How can you imagine after what you have shewn me if I had ever any such Thoughts that I should not banish them for+ever If it will satisfy you I will receive the Sacrament upon it never to see his Face again'    'But Child dear Child' said the Aunt 'be reasonable  Can you invent a single Objection'    'I have already I think told you a sufficient Objection answered  Sophia  '    'What' cries the Aunt 'I remember none'  'Sure Madam' said  Sophia  'I told you he had used me in the rudest and vilest Manner'  'Indeed Child' answered she 'I never heard you or did not understand youBut what do you mean by  this rude and vile Manner'  'Indeed Madam' says  Sophia  'I am almost ashamed to tell you He caught me in his Arms and pulled me down on the Settee and thrust his Hand into my Bosom and kissed it with such Violence that I have the Mark upon my left Breast at this Moment'    'Indeed'  said Mrs  Western  'Yes indeed Madam' answered  Sophia  'my Father luckily came in at that Instant or Heaven knows what Rudeness he intended to have proceeded to'  'I am astonished and confounded' cries the Aunt 'No Woman of the Name of  Western  hath been ever treated so since we were a Family I would have torn the Eyes of a Prince out if he had attempted such Freedoms with me It is impossible Sure  Sophia  you must invent this to raise my Indignation against him'  'I hope Madam' said  Sophia  'you have too good an Opinion of me to imagine me capable of telling an Untruth Upon my Soul it is true'  'I should have stabbed him to the Heart had I been present' returned the Aunt Yet surely he could have no dishonourable Design It is impossible he durst not Besides his Proposals shew he had not for they are not only honourable but generous I don't know the Age allows too great Freedoms A distant Salute is all I would have allowed before the Ceremony I have had Lovers formerly not so long ago neither several Lovers tho' I never would consent to Marriage and I never encouraged the least Freedom It is a foolish Custom and what I never would agree to No Man kissed more of me than my Cheek It is as much as one can bring one's self to give Lips up to a Husband and indeed could I ever have been persuaded to marry I believe I should not have been brought to endure so much'  'You will pardon me dear Madam' said  Sophia  'if I make one Observation You own you had many Lovers  and the World knows it even if you should deny i  You refused them all and I am convinced one Co+ronet at least among them'  'You say true dea  Sophy'  answered she 'I had once the Offer of  Title'  'Why then' said  Sophia  'will you no  suffer me to refuse this once'  'It is true Child said she 'I have refused the Offer of a Title bu  it was not so good an Offer that is not so very very good an Offer'    'Yes Madam' said  Sophia  'but you have had very great Proposal from Men of vast Fortunes It was not the first nor the second nor the third advantageous Match that offered itself'  'I own it was not'  said she  'Well Madam' continued  Sophia  'and why may not I expect to have a second perhaps better than this You are now but a young Women and I am convinced would not promise to yield to the first Lover of Fortune nay or of Title too I am  very young Woman and sure I need not despair'  'Well my dear  Sophy'  cries the Aunr 'what would you have me say'  'Why I beg that I may not be left alone this Evening Grant me that and I will submit if you think after what is past I ought to see him in your Company'  'Well I will grant it' cries the Aunt  'Sophy  you know I love you and can deny you nothing You know the Easiness of my Nature I have not always been so easy I have been formerly thought cruel by the Men I mean I was called the cruel  Parthenissa  I have broke many a Window that has had Verses to the cruel  Parthenissa  in it  Sophy  I was never so handsome as you and yet I had something of you formerly I am a little altered Kingdoms and States as  Tully Cicero  says in his Epistles undergo Alterations and so must the human Form'  Thus run she on for near half an Hour upon herself and her Conquests and Cruelty 'till the  Arrival of my Lord who after a most tedious Visit  uring which Mrs  Western  never once offered to leave  he Room retired not much more satisfied with the Aunt than with the Neice For  Sophia  had brought  er Aunt into so excellent a Temper that she con  ented to almost every Thing the Neice said and  greed that a little distant Behaviour might not be  mproper to so forward a Lover  Thus  Sophia  by a little well directed Flattery for which surely none will blame her obtained a little Ease for herself and at least put off the evil Day And now we have seen our Heroine in a better Situation than she hath been for a long Time before we will look a little after Mr  Jones  whom we left in  he most deplorable Situation that can well be imagined  CHAP V  Mrs  Miller  and Mr  Nightingale  visit  Jones  in the Prison  WHEN Mr  Allworthy  and his Nephew went to meet Mr  Western  Mrs  Miller  set fowards  o her SoninLaw's Lodgings in order to acquaint  im with the Accident which had befallen his Friend  Jones  but he had known it long before from  Par  ridge  for  Jones  when he left Mrs  Miller  had been furnished with a Room in the same House with Mr  Nightingale  The good Woman found her Daughter under great Affliction on Account of Mr  Jones  whom having comforted as well as she could she set forwards to the Gatehouse where he was and where Mr  Nightingale  was arrived before her  The Firmness and Constancy of a true Friend is Circumstance so extremely delightful to Persons in  ny Kind of Distress that the Distress itself if it be only temporary and admits of Relief is more than compensated by bringing this Comfort with it Nor  are Instances of this Kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate Observers have reported To say the Truth Want of Compassion is not to be numbered among our general Faults The black Ingredien  which fouls our Disposition is Envy Hence our Eye is seldom I am afraid turned upward to those who are manifestly greater better wiser or happie  than ourselves without some Degree of Malignity while we commonly look down on the Mean and Miserable with sufficient Benevolence and Pity In Fact I have remarked that most of the Defects which have discovered themselves within my Observation have arisen from Envy only a hellish Vice and yet one from which I have known very few absolutely exempt But enough of a Subject which if pursued would lead me too far  Whether it was that Fortune was apprehensive lest  Jones  should sink under the Weight of his Adversity and that she might thus lose the Opportunity of tormenting him or whether she really abated somewhat of her Severity towards him she seemed a little to relax her Persecution by sending him the Company of two such faithful Friends and what is perhaps more rare a faithful Servant For  Partridge  tho' he had many Imperfections wanted not Fidelity and tho' Fear would not suffer him to be hanged for his Master yet the World I believe could not have bribed him to desert his Cause  While  Jones  was expressing great Satsfaction in the Presence of his Friends  Partridge  brought an  Account that Mr  Fitzpatrick  was still alive tho' the Surgeon declared that he had very little Hopes Upon which  Jones  fetching a deep Sigh  Nightingale  said to him  'My dear  Tom  why should you afflict yourself so upon an Accident which whatever be the Consequence can be attended with no Danger to you and in which your Conscience cannot accuse you of  having been in the least to blame If the Fellow should die what have you done more than taken away the Life of a Ruffian in your own Defence So will the Coroner's Inquest find it and then you will be easily admitted to Bail And though you must undergo the Form of a Trial yet it is a Trial which many Men would stand for you for a Shilling'  'Come come Mr  Jones'  says Mrs  Miller  'cheer yourself up I knew you could not be the Aggressor and so I told Mr  Allworthy  and so he shall acknowledge too before I have done with him'  Jones  gravely answered  'That whatever might be his Fate he should always lament the having shed the Blood of one of his FellowCreatures as one the highest Misfortunes which could have befallen him But I have another Misfortune of the tenderest KindO Mrs  Miller  I have lost what I held most dear upon Earth'  'That must be a Mistress' said Mrs  Miller  'But come come I know more than you imagine' for indeed  Parridge  had blabbed all 'and I have heard more than you know Matters go better I promise you than you think and I would not give  Blifil  Sixpence for all the Chance which he hath of the Lady'  'Indeed my dear Friend indeed' answered  Jones  you are an entire Stranger to the Cause of my Grief If you was acquainted with the Story you wou'd allow my Case admitted of no Comfort I apprehend no Danger from  Blifil  I have undone myself'  'Don't Despair' replied Mrs  Milr  'you know what a Woman can do and if any Thing be in my Power I promise you I will do it to serve you It is my Duty My Son my dear Mr  Nightingale  who is so kind to tell me he hath Obligations to you on the same Account knows it is my Duty'  'Shall I go to the Lady myself  I will say any Thing to her you would have me say'  'Thou best of Women' cries  Jones  taking her by the Hand 'talk not of Obligations to mebut as you have been so kind to mention it there is a Favour which perhaps may be in your Power I see you are acquainted with the Lady how you came by your Information I know not who sits indeed very near my Heart If you could contrive to deliver this giving her a Paper from his Pocket I shall for ever acknowledge your Goodness'  'Give it me' said Mrs  Miller  'If I see it not in her own Possession before I sleep may my next Sleep be my last Comfort yourself my good young Man be wise enough to take warning from past Follies and I warrant all shall be well and I shall yet see you happy with the most charming young Lady in the World for so I hear from every one she is'  'Believe me Madam' said he 'I do not speak the common Cant of one in my unhappy Situation Before this dreadful Accident happened P  had resolved to quit a Life of which I was become sensible of the Wickedness as well as Folly I do assure you notwithstanding the Disturbances I have unfortunately occasioned in your House for which I heartily ask your Pardon I am not an abandoned Profligate Though I have been hurried into Vices I do not approve a vicious Character not will I ever from this Moment deserve it'  Mrs  Miller  expressed great Satisfaction in these Declarations in the Sincerity of which she averred she had an entire Faith and now the Remainder of the Conversation past in the joint Attempts of that good Woman and Mr  Nightingale  to cheer the dejected Spirits of Mr  Jones  in which they so well succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and satisfied than they found him to which happy Alteration  nothing so much contributed as the kind Undertaking of Mrs  Miller  to deliver his Letter to  Sophia  which he despaired of finding any Means to accomplish For when  Black George  produced the last from  Sophia  he informed  Partridge  that she had strictly charged him on pain of having it communicated to her Father not to bring her any Answer He was moreover not a little pleased to find he had so warm an Advocate to Mr  Allworthy  himself in this good Woman who was in Reality one of the worthiest Creatures in the World  After about an Hour's Visit from the Lady for  Nightingale  had been with him much longer they both took their leave promising to return to him soon during which Mrs  Miller  said she hoped to bring him some good News from his Mistress and Mr  Nightingale  promised to enquire into the State of Mr  Fitzpatrick'  s Wound and likewise to find out some of the Persons who were present at the Rencounter  The former of these went directly in quest of  Sophia  whither we likewise shall now attend her  CHAP VI  In which Mrs  Miller  pays a Visit to  Sophia  ACCESS to the young Lady was by no means difficult for as she lived now on a perfect friendly footing with her Aunt she was at full Liberty  o receive what Visitants she pleased  Sophia  was dressing when she was acquainted that here was a Gentlewoman below to wait on her As she was neither afraid nor ashamed to see any  f her own Sex Mrs  Miller  was immediately admitted  Curt'sies and the usual Ceremonials between Women who are Strangers to each other being past  Sophia  d  'I have not the Pleasure to know you Madam'  'No Madam' answered Mrs  Miller  'and I must  beg Pardon for intruding upon you But when you know what has induced me to give you this Trouble I hope'    'Pray what is your Business Madam' said  Sophia  with a little Emotion  'Madam we are not alone'  replied Mrs  Miller  in a low Voice  'Go out  Betty'  said  Sophia  When  Betty  was departed Mrs  Miller  said  'I was desired Madam by a very unhappy young Gentleman to deliver you this Letter'  Sophia  changed Colour when she saw the Direction well knowing the Hand and after some Hesitation said  'I could not conceive Madam from your Appearance that your Business had been of such a NatureWhomever you brought this Letter from I shall not open it I should be sorry to entertain an unjust Suspicion of any one but you are an utter Stranger to me'  'If you will have Patience Madam' answered Mrs  Miller  'I will acquaint you who I am and how I came by that Letter'  'I have no Curiosity Madam to know any thing cries  Sophia  but I must insist on your delivering that Letter back to the Person who gave it you'  Mrs  Miller  then fell upon her Knees and in the most passionate Terms implored her Compassion  to which  Sophia  answered  'Sure Madam it is surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the Behalf of this Person I would not think Madam''No Madam' says Mrs  Miller  you shall not think any thing but the Truth I will tell you all and you will not wonder that I am interested He is the best natured Creature tha  ever was born'  She then began and related the Story of Mr  Henderson  After this she cried  'This Madam this is his Goodness but I have much more tender Obligations to him He hath pre+served my Child'  Here after shedding some Tears she related every thing concerning that Fact  suppressing only those Circumstances which would have most reflected on her Daughter and concluded with saying  'Now Madam you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for so kind so good so generous a young Man and sure he is the best and worthiest of all Human Beings'  The Alteration in the Countenance of  Sophia  had hitherto been chiefly to her Disadvantage and had inclined her Complexion to too great Paleness but she now waxed redder if possible than Vermilion  'and cry'd I know not what to say certainly what arises from Gratitude cannot be blamedBut what Service can my reading his Letter do your Friend since I am resolved never'  Mrs  Miller  fell again to her Entreaties and begged to be forgiven but she could not she said carry it back  'Well Madam' says  Sophia  'I cannot help it if you will force it upon meCertainly you may leave it whether I will or no'  What  Sophia  meant or whether she meant any thing I will not presume to determine but Mrs  Miller  actually understood this as a Hint and presently laying the Letter down on the Table took her Leave having first begged Permission to wait again on  Sophia  which Request had neither Assent nor Denial  The Letter lay upon the Table no longer than till Mrs  Miller  was out of Sight for then  Sophia  opened and read it  This Letter did very little Service to his Cause for it consisted of little more than Confessions of his own Unworthiness and bitter Lamentations of Despair together with the most solemn Protestations of his unalterable Fideilty to  Sophia  of which he said he hoped to convince her if he had ever more the Honour of being admitted to her Presence and that he could account for the Letter to Lady  Bellaston  in such a Manner that though it would not intitle him to her Forgiveness he hoped at least to obtain it from her Mercy  And concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his Thoughts than to marry Lady  Bellaston  Though  Sophia  read the Letter twice over with great Attention his Meaning still remained a Riddle to her nor could her Invention suggest to her any Means to Excuse  Jones  She certainly remained very angry with him though indeed Lady  Bellaston  took up so much of her Resentment that her gentle Mind had but little left to bestow on any other Person  That Lady was most unluckily to dine this very Day with her Aunt  Western  and in the Afternoon they were all three by Appointment to go together to the Opera and thence to Lady  Thomas Hatchet'  s Drum  Sophia  would have gladly been excused from all but she would not disoblige her Aunt and as to the Arts of counterfeiting Illness she was so entirely a Stranger to them that it never once entered into her Head When she was drest therefore down she went resolved to encounter all the Horrours of the Day and a most disagreeable one it proved for Lady  Bellaston  took every Opportunity very civilly and slily to insult her to all which her Dejection of Spirits disabled her from making any Return and indeed to confess the Truth she was at the very best but an different Mistress of Repartee  Another Misfortune which befel  Sophia  was the Company of Lord  Fellamar  whom she met at the Opera and who attended her to the Drum And though both Places were too publick to admit of any Particularities and she was farther relieved by the Musick at the one Place and by the Cards at the other she could not however enjoy herself in his Company for there is something of Delicacy in Women which will not suffer them to be even easy in the Presence of a Man whom they know to have Pretensions to them which they are disinclined to favour  Having in this Chapter twice mentioned a Drum a Word which our Posterity it is hoped will not  understand in the Sense it is here applied we shall notwithstanding our present Haste stop a Moment to describe the Entertainment here meant and the rather as we can in a Moment describe it  A Drum then is an Assembly of well dressed Persons of both Sexes most of whom play at Cards and the rest do nothing at all while the Mistress of the House performs the Part of a Landlady at an Inn and like the Landlady of an Inn prides herself in the Number of her Guests though she doth not always like her get any thing by it  No wonder then as so much Spirits must be required to support any Vivacity in these Scenes of Dulness that we hear Persons of Fashion eternally complaining of the Want of them a Complaint confined entirely to upper Life How insupportable must we imagine this Round of Impertinence to have been to  Sophia  at this time how difficult must she have found it to force the Appearance of Gaiety into her Looks when her Mind dictated nothing but the tenderest Sorrow and when every Thought was charged with tormenting Ideas  Night however at last restored her to her Pillow where we will leave her to soothe her Melancholy at+least though incapable we are afraid of Rest and shall pursue our History which something whispers us is now arrived at the Eve of some great Event  CHAP VII  A pathetic Scene between Mr  Allworthy  and Mrs  Miller  MRS  Miller  had a long Discourse with Mr  Allworthy  at his Return from his Dinner in which she accquainted him with  Jones'  s having unfortunately lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their Separation and with the Distresses to which that Loss had subjected him of all which she had received  a full Account from the faithful Retailer  Partridge  She then explained the Obligations she had to  Jones  not that she was entirely explicite with regard to her Daughter for though she had the utmost Confidence in Mr  Allworthy  and though there could be no Hopes of keeping an Affair secret which was unhappily known to more than half a Dozen yet she could not prevail with herself to mention those Circumstances which reflected most on the Chastity of poor  Nancy  but smothered that Part of her Evidence as cautiously as if she had been before a Judge and the Girl was now on her Trial for the Murder of a Bastard  Allworthy  said there were few Characters so absolutely vicious as not to have the least Mixture of Good in them  'However' says he 'I cannot deny but that you had some Obligations to the Fellow bad as he is and I shall therefore Excuse what has past already but must insist you never mention his Name to me more for I promise you it was upon the fullest and plainest Evidence that I resolved to take the Measures I have taken'  'Well Sir says she I make not the least doubt but Time will shew all Matters in their true and natural Colours and that you will be convinced this poor young Man deserves better of you than some other Folks that shall be nameless'  'Madam' cries  Allworthy  a little ruffled 'I will not hear any Reflections on my Nephew and if you ever say a Word more of that Kind I will depart from your House that Instant He is the worthiest and best of Men and I once more repeat it to you he hath carried his Friendship to this Man to a blameable Length by too long concealing Facts of the blackest Die The Ingratitude of the Wretch to this good young Man is what I most resent for Madam I have the greatest Reason to  imagine he had laid a Plot to supplant my Nephew in my Favour and to have disinherited him'  'I am sure Sir' answered Mrs  Miller  a little frightened for though Mr  Allworthy  had the utmost Sweetness and Benevolence in his Smiles he had great Terror in his Frowns 'I shall never speak against any Gentlemen you are pleased to think well of I am sure Sir such Behaviour would very little become me especially when the Gentleman is your nearest Relation but Sir you must not be angry with me you must not indeed for my good Wishes to this poor Wretch Sure I may call him so now though once you would have been angry with me if I had spoke of him with the least Disrespect How often have I heard you call him your Son How often have you prattled to me of him with all the Fondness of a Parent Nay Sir I cannot forget the many tender Expressions the many good Things you have told me of his Beauty and his Parts and his Virtues of his Goodnature and GenerosityI am sure Sir I cannot forget them For I find them all true I have experienced them in my own Cause They have preserved my Family You must pardon my Tears Sir indeed you must when I consider the cruel Reverse of Fortune which this poor Youth to whom I am so much obliged hath suffered when I consider the Loss of your Favour which I know he valued more than his Life I must I must lament him If you had a Dagger in your Hand ready to plunge into my Heart I must lament the Misery of one whom you have loved and I shall ever love'  Allworthy  was pretty much moved with this Speech but it seemed not to be with Anger For after a short Silence taking Mrs  Miller  by the Hand he said very affectionately to her  'Come Madam let us consider a little about your Daughter I cannot blame you for rejoicing in a Match which promises  to be advantageous to her but you know this Advantage in a great Measure depends on the Father's Reconciliation I know Mr  Nightingale  very well and have formerly had Concerns with him I will make him a Visit and endeavour to serve you in this Matter I believe he is a worldly Man but as this is an only Son and the Thing is now irretrievable perhaps he may in Time be brought to Reason I promise you I will do all I can for you'  Many were the Acknowledgments which the poor Woman made to  Allworthy  for this Kind and generous Offer nor could she refrain from taking this Occasion again to express her Gratitude towards  Jones  'to whom said she I owe the Opportunity of giving you Sir this present Trouble'  Allworthy  gently stopped her but he was too good a Man to be really offended with the Effects of so noble a Principle as now actuated Mrs  Miller  and indeed had not this new Affair inflamed his former Anger against  Jones  it is possible he might have been a little softened towards him by the Report of an Action which Malice itself could not have derived from an evil Motive  Mr  Allworthy  and Mrs  Miller  had been above an Hour together when their Conversation was put an End to by the Arrival of  Blifil  and another Person which other Person was no less than Mr  Dowling  the Attorney who was now become a great Favourite with Mr  Blifil  and whom Mr  Allworthy  at the Desire of his Nephew had made his Steward and had likewise recommended him to Mr  Western  from whom the Attorney received a Promise of being promoted to the same Office upon the first Vacancy and in the mean Time was employed in transacting some Affairs which the Squire then had in  London  in Relation to a Mortgage  This was the principal Affair which then brought Mr  Dowling  to Town therefore he took the same  Opportunity to charge himself with some Money for Mr  Allworthy  and to make a Report to him of some other Business in all which as it was of much too dull a Nature to find any Place in this History we will leave the Uncle Nephew and their Lawyer concerned and resort to other Matters  CHAP VIII  Containing various Matters  BEFORE we return to Mr  Jones  we will take one more View of  Sophia  Though that young Lady had brought her Aunt into great good Humour by those soothing Methods which we have before related she had not brought her in the least to abate of her Zeal for the Match with Lord  Fellamar  this Zeal was now inflamed by Lady  Bellaston  who had told her the preceding Evening that she was well satisfied from the Conduct of  Sophia  and from her Carriage to his Lordship that all Delays would be dangerous and that the only Way to succeed was to press the Match forward with such Rapidity that the young Lady should have no Time to reflect and be obliged to consent while she searce knew what she did In which Manner she said one half of the Marriages among People of Condition were brought about A Fact very probably true and to which I suppose is owing the mutual Tenderness which afterwards exists among so many happy Couples  A Hint of the same Kind was given by the same Lady to Lord  Fellamar  and both these so readily embraced the Advice that the very next Day was at his Lordship's Request appointed by Mrs  Western  for a private Interview between the young Parties This was communicated to  Sophia  by her Aunt and asisted upon in such high Terms that after having urged every Thing she possibly could invent against it  without the least Effect she at last agreed to give the highest Instance of Complaisance which any young Lady can give and consented to see his Lordship  As Conversations of this Kind afford no great Entertainment we shall be excused from reeiting the whole that past atthis Interview in which after his Lordship had made many Declarations of the most pure and ardent Passions to the silent blushing  Sophia  she at last collected all the Spirits she could raise and with a trembling low Voice said  'My Lord you must be yourself conscious whether your former Behaviour to me hath been consistent with the Professions you now make'  'Is there answered he no Way by which I can attone for Madness What I did I am afraid must have too plainly convinced you that the Violence of Love had deprived me of my Senses'  ' 'Indeed my Lord said she it is in your Power to give me a Proof of an Affection which I much rather wish to encourage and to which I should think myself more beholden'  'Name it Madam said my Lord very warmly'    'My Lord says she looking down upon her Fan I know you must be sensible how uneasy this pretended Passion of yours hath made me'    'Can you be so cruel to call it pretended says he'  'Yes my Lord answered  Sophia  all Professions of Love to those whom we persecute are most insulting Pretences This Pursuit of yours is to me a most cruel Persecution nay it is taking a most ungenerous Advantage of my unhappy Situation'  'Most lovely most adoreable Charmer do not accuse me cries he of taking an ungenerous Advantage while I have no Thoughts but what are directed to your Honour and Interest and while I have no View no Hope no Ambition but to throw myself Honour  Fortune every Thing at your Feet  ' My Lord says she it is that Fortune and those Honours which give you the Advantage of which I complain These are the Charms which have seduced my Relations but to me they are things indifferent If your Lordship will merit my Gratitude there is but one Way'    'Pardon me divine Creature said he there can be none All I can do for you is so much your due and will give me so much Pleasure that there is no room for your Gratitude'    'Indeed my Lord answered she you may obtain my Gratitude my good Opinion every kind Thought and Wish which it is in my Power to bestow nay you may obtain them with Ease for sure to a generous Mind it must be easy to grant my Request Let me beseech you then to cease a Pursuit in which you can never have any Success For your own Sake as well as mine I entreat this Favour for sure you are too noble to have any Pleasure in tormenting an unhappy Creature What can your Lordship propose but Uneasiness to yourself by a Perseverance which upon my Honour upon my Soul cannot shall not prevail with me whatever Distresses you may drive me to'  Here my Lord fetched a deep Sigh and then said  'Is it then Madam that I am so unhappy to be the Object of your Dislike and Scorn or will you pardon me if I suspect there is some other'  Here he hesitated and  Sophia  answered with some Spirit  'My Lord I shall not be accountable to you for the Reasons of my Conduct I am obliged to your Lordship for the generous Offer you have made I own it is beyond either my Deserts or Expectations yet I hope my Lord you will not insist on my Reasons when I declare I cannot accept it'  Lord  Fellamar  returned much to this which we do not perfectly understand  and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either to Sense or Grammar but he concluded his ranting Speech with saying  'That if she has preengaged herself to any Gentleman however unhappy it would make him he should think himself bound in Honour to desist'  Perhaps my Lord laid too much Emphasis on the Word Gentleman for we cannot else well account for the Indignation with which he inspired  Sophia  who in her Answer seemed greatly to resent some Affront he had given her  While she was speaking with her Voice more raised than usual Mrs  Western  came into the Room the Fire glaring in her Cheeks and the Flames bursting from her Eyes  'I am ashamed says she my Lord of the Reception which you have met with I assure your Lordship we are all sensible of the Honour done us and I must tell you Miss  Western  the Family expect a different Behaviour from you'  Here my Lord interfered on Behalf of the young Lady but to no Purpose the Aunt proceeded till  Sophia  pulled out her Handkerchief threw herself into a Chair and burst into a violent Fit of Tears  The Remainder of the Conversation between Mrs  Western  and his Lordship till the latter withdrew consisted of bitter Lamentations on his Side and on hers of the strongest Assurances that her Neice should and would consent to all he wished  'Indeed my Lord says she the Girl hath had a foolish Education neither adapted to her Fortune nor her Family Her Father I am sorry to say it is to blame for every Thing The Girl hath silly Country Notions of Bashfulness Nothing else my Lord upon my Honour I am convinced she hath a good Understanding at the Bottom and will be brought to Reason'  This last Speech was made in the Absence of  Sophia  for she had sometime before left the Room with more  Appearance of Passion than she had ever shewn on any Occasion and now his Lordship after many Expressions of Thanks to Mrs  Western  many ardent Professions of Passion which nothing could conquer and many Assurances of Perseverance which Mrs  Western  highly encouraged took his Leave for this Time  Before we relate what now passed between Mrs  Western  and  Sophia  it may be proper to mention an unfortunate Accident which had happened and which had occasioned the Return of Mrs  Western  with so much Fury as we have seen  The Reader then must know that the Maid who at present attended on  Sophia  was recommended by Lady  Bellaston  with whom she had lived for some Time in the Capacity of a Combbrush she was a very sensible Girl and had received the strictest Instructions to watch her young Lady very carefully These Instructions we are sorry to say were communicated to her by Mrs  Honour  into whose Favour Lady  Bellaston  had now so ingratiated herself that the violent Affection which the good WaitingWoman had formerly borne to  Sophia  was entirely obliterated by that great Attachment which she had to her new Mistress  Now when Mrs  Miller  was departed  Betty  for that was the Name of the Girl returning to her young Lady found her very attentively engaged in reading a long Letter and the visible Emotions which she betrayed on that Occasion might have well accounted for some Suspicions which the Girl entertained but indeed they had yet a stronger Foundation for she had overheard the whole Scene which passed between  Sophia  and Mrs  Miller  Mrs  Western  was acquainted with all this Matter by  Betty  who after receiving many Commendations and some Rewards for her Fidelity was ordered that if the Woman who brought the Letter came  again she should introduce her to Mrs  Western  herself  Unluckily Mrs  Miller  returned at the very time when  Sophia  was engaged with his Lordship  Betty  according to Order sent her directly to the Aunt who being Mistress of so many Circumstances relating to what had past the Day before easily imposed upon the poor Woman to believe that  Sophia  had communicated the whole Affair and so pumped every+thing out of her which she knew relating to the Letter and relating to  Jones  This poor Creature might indeed be called Simplicity itself She was one of that Order of Mortals who are apt to believe every thing which is said to them to whom Nature hath neither indulged the offensive nor defensive Weapons of Deceit and who are consequently liable to be imposed upon by any one who will only be at the Expence of a little Falshood for that Purpose Mrs  Western  having drained Mrs  Miller  of all she knew which indeed was but little but which was sufficient to make the Aunt suspect a great deal dismissed her with Assurances that  Sophia  would not see her that she would send no Answer to the Letter nor ever receive another  nor did she suffer her to depart without a handsome Lecture on the Merits of an Office to which she could afford no better Name than that of Procu+ress  This discovery had greatly discomposed her Tem+per when coming into the Apartment next to tha  in which the Lovers were she overheard  Sophia  very warmly protesting against his Lordship's Addresses At which the Rage already kindled burst forth and she rushed in upon her Niece in a furious Manner as we have already described together with what past a  that time till his Lordship's Departure  No sooner was Lord  Fellamar  gone than Mrs  Western  returned to  Sophia  whom she upbraided i  the most bitter Terms for the ill Use she had made of the Confidence reposed in her and for her Treachery in Conversing with a Man with whom she had offered but the Day before to bind herself in the most solemn Oath never more to have any Conversation  Sophia  protested she had maintained no such Conversation  'How Miss  Western'  said the Aunt 'will you deny your receiving a Letter from him yesterday'  'A Letter Madam'  answered  Sophia  somewhat surprized  'It is not very well bred Miss replies the Aunt to repeat my Words I say a Letter and I insist upon your shewing it me immediately'  'I scorn a Lie Madam' said  Sophia  I did receive a Letter but it was without my Desire and indeed I may say against my Consent'  'Indeed indeed Miss' cries the Aunt 'you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at all but where is the Letter for I will see it'  To this peremptory Demand  Sophia  paused some Time before she returned an Answer and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not the Letter in her Pocket which was indeed true upon which her Aunt losing all manner of Patience asked her Neice this short Question whether she would resolve to marry Lord  Fellamar  or no to which she received the strongest Negative Mrs  Western  then replied with an Oath or something very like one that she would early the next Morning deliver her back into her Father's Hands  Sophia  then began to reason with her Aunt in the following manner  'Why Madam must I of Necessity be forced to marry at all consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own Case and how much kinder your Parents were in leaving you to your Liberty What have I done to forfeit this Liberty I will never marry contrary to my Father's Consent nor without asking yoursAnd when I ask the Consent of either improperly  it will be then time enough to force some other marriage upon me'  'Can I bear to hear this' cries Mrs  Western  'from a Girl who hath now a Letter from a Murderer in her Pocket'  'I have no such Letter I promise you' answered  Sophia  'and if he be a  Murderer  he will soon be in no Condition to give you any further Disturbance'  ' 'How Miss  Western'  said the Aunt 'have you the Assurance to speak of him in this Manner to own your Affection for such a Villain to my Face'  'Sure Madam' said  Sophia  'you put a very strange Construction on my Words'  'Indeed Miss  Western'  cries the Lady 'I shall not bear this Usage you have learnt of your Father this Manner of treating me he hath taught you to give me the Lie He hath totally ruined you by his false System of Education and please Heaven he shall have the Comfort of its Fruits For once more I declare to you that tomorrow Morning I will carry you back I will withdraw all my Forces from the Field and remain henceforth like the wise King of  Prussia  in a State of perfect Neutrality You are both too wise to be regulated by my Measures so prepare yourself for tomorrow Morning you shall evacuate this House'  Sophia  remonstrated all she could but her Aunt was deaf to all she said In this Resolution therefore we must at present leave her as there seems to be no Hopes of bringing her to change it  CHAP IX  What happened to Mr  Jones  in the Prison  MR  Jones  past above twentyfour melancholy Hours by himself unless when relieved by the Company of  Partridge  before Mr  Nightingale  returned not that this worthy young Man had deserted  or forgot his Friend for indeed he had been much the greatest part of the time employed in his Service  He had heard upon Enquiry that the only Persons who had seen the Beginning of the unfortunate Rencounter were a Crew belonging to a Man of War which then lay at  Deptford  To  Deptford  therefore he went in search of this Crew where he was informed that the Men he sought after were all gone ashore He then traced them from Place to Place till at last he found two of them drinking together with a third Person at a HedgeTavern near  Aldersgate  Nightingale  desired to speak with  Jones  by himself for  Partridge  was in the Room when he came in As soon as they were alone  Nightingale  taking  Jones  by the Hand cried  'Come my brave Friend be not too much dejected at what I am going to tell you I am sorry I am the Messenger of bad News'  'I guess already what that News is' cries  Jones  'The poor Gentleman then is dead'    'I hope not' answered  Nightingale  'He was alive this Morning though I will not flatter you I fear from the Accounts I could get that his Wound is mortal But if the Affair be exactly as you told it your own Remorse would be all you would have reason to apprehend let what would happen but forgive me my dear  Tom  if I entreat you to make the worst of your Story to your Friends If you disguise any thing to us you will only be an an Enemy to yourself'  'What Reason my dear  Jack  have I ever given you' said  Jones  'to stab me with so cruel a Suspicion'  'Have Patience' cries  Nightingale  and I will tell you all After the most diligent Enquiry I could make I at last met with two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident and I am sorry to say they do not relate the Story so much in your Favour as you yourself have told it'  'Why what do they say' cries  Jones  'Indeed  what I am sorry to repeat as I am afraid o  the Consequence of it to you They say that they were at too great a Distance to overhear any Word  that passed between you but they both agree tha  the first Blow was given by you'  'Then upon my Soul' answered  Jones  'they injure me He no  only struck me first but struck me without the leas  Provocation What should induce those Villains to accuse me falsely'  'Nay that I cannot guess' said  Nightingale  'and if you yourself and I who am so heartily your Friend cannot conceive a Reason why they should beli  you what Reason will an in different Court of Justice be able to assign why they should not believe them I repeated the Question to them several times and so did another Gentleman who was present who I believe is a seafarin  Man and who really acted a very friendly part b  you for he begged them often to consider tha  there was the Life of a Man in the Case and aske  them over and over if they were certain to which they both answered that they were and would abid  by their Evidence upon Oath For Heaven's Sake my dear Friend recollect yourself for if this should appear to be the Fact it will be your Business to think in time of making the best of your Interest  would not shock you but you know I believe the Severity of the Law whatever verbal Provocati+ons may have been given you'  'Alas my Friend cries  Jones  'what Interest hath such a Wretch as I Besides do you think I would even wish to liv  with the Reputation of a Murderer If I had an  Friends as alas I have none could I have the Confidence to solicit them to speak in the Behalf o  a Man condemned for the blackest Crime in Human Nature Believe me I have no such Hope but have some Reliance on a Throne still greatly superior which will I am certain afford me all the Pro+  tection I merit'  He then concluded with many  lemn and vehement Protestations of the Truth of what he had at first asserted  The Faith of  Nightingale  was now again staggered  nd began to incline to credit his Friend when Mrs  Miller  appeared and made a sorrowful Report of the  uccess of her Embassy which when  Jones  had heard  e cried out most heroically 'Well my Friend I am now indifferent as to what shall happen at least with Regard to my Life and if it be the Will of Heaven that I shall make an Atonement with that for the Blood I have spilt I hope the Divine Goodness will one Day suffer my Honour to be cleared and that the Words of a dying Man at least will be believed so far as to justify his Character'  A very mournful Scene now past between the Pri  ner and his Friends at which as few Readers would  ave been pleased to be present so few I believe will  esire to hear it particularly related We will there  re pass on to the Entrance of the Turnkey who ac  uainted  Jones  that there was a Lady without who  esired to speak with him when he was at Leisure  Jones  declared his Surprize at this Message He said he knew no Lady in the World whom he could possibly expect to see there However as he saw  o Reason to decline seeing any Person Mrs  Miller  and Mr  Nightingale  presently took their Leave  nd he gave Orders to have the Lady admitted  If  Jones  was surprized at the News of a Visit from Lady how greatly was he astonished when he discovered this Lady to be no other than Mrs  Waters  this Astonishment then we shall leave him awhile  order to cure the Surprize of the Reader who will  kewise probably not a little wonder at the Arrival  f this Lady  Who this Mr  Waters  was the Reader pretty well  ows what she was he must be perfectly satisfied  He will therefore be pleased to remember that thi  Lady departed from  Upton  in the same Coach with Mr  Fitzpatrick  and the other  Irish  Gentleman an  in their Company travelled to the  Bath  Now there was a certain Office in the Gift of M  Fitzpatrick  at that Time vacant namely that of Wife for the Lady who had lately filled that Offic  had resigned or at least deserted her Duty Mr  Fitz+patrick  therefore having thoroughly examined Mrs  Waters  on the Road found her extremely fit for thi  Place which on their Arrival at  Bath  he presentl  conferred upon her and she without any Scruple accepted As Husband and Wife this Gentleman and Lady continued together all the Time they stayed a  Bath  and as Husband and Wife they arrived together in Town  Whether Mr  Fitzpatrick  was so wise a Man a not to part with one good Thing till he had secure another which he had at present only a Prospect of re+gaining or whether Mrs  Waters  had so well dis+charged her Office that he intended still to retain he as Principal and to make his Wife as is often the Case only her Deputy I will not say but certain is he never mentioned his Wife to her never commu+nicated to her the Letter given him by Mrs  Western  nor ever once hinted his Purpose of repossessing h  Wife much less did he ever mention the Name o  Jones  For though he intended to fight with him wherever he met him he did not imitate those pru+dent Persons who think a Wife a Mother a Siste  or sometimes a whole Family the safest Seconds o  these Occasions The first Account therefore which she had of all this was delivered to her from his Lip  after he was brought hime from the Tavern where h  Wound had been drest  As Mr  Fitzpatrick  however had not the cleare  Way of telling a Story at any Time and was now  perhaps a little more confused than usual it was some Time before she discovered that the Gentleman who  ad given him this Wound was the very same Person from whom her Heart had received a Wound which  hough not of a mortal Kind was yet so deep that it  ad left a considerable Scar behind it But no sooner was she acquainted that Mr  Jones  himself was the Man who had been committed to the Gatehouse for  his supposed Murder than she took the first Opportunity of committing Mr  Fitzpatrick  to the Care of  is Nurse and hastened away to visit the Conqueror  She now entered the Room with an Air of Gayety which received an immediate Check from the melancholy Aspect of poor  Jones  who started and blessed himself when he saw her Upon which she said  'Nay I do not wonder at your Surprize I believe you did not expect to see me for few Gentlemen are troubled here with Visits from any Lady unless a Wife You see the Power you have over me Mr  Jones  Indeed I little thought when we parted at  Upton  that our next Meeting would have been in such a Place'  'Indeed Madam' says  Jones  'I must look upon this Visit as kind few will follow the Miserable especially to such dismal Habitations'  'I protest Mr  Jones  'says she I can hardly persuade myself you are the same agreeable Fellow I saw at  Upton  Why your Face is more miserable than any Dungeon in the Universe What can be the Matter with you'  'I thought Madam' said  Jones  as you knew of my being here you knew the unhappy Reason'  'Pugh' says she you have pinked a Man in a Duel that's all'  Jones  exprest some Indignation at this Levity and spoke with the utmost Contrition for what had happened To which she answered  'Well then Sir if you take it so much to Heart I will relieve you the Gentleman is not dead and I am pretty confident is in no Danger of dying The Surgeon indeed who  first dressed him was a young Fellow and seeme  desirous of representing his Case to be as bad as pos+sible that he might have the more Honour from curing him but the King's Surgeon hath seen him since and says unless from a Fever of which ther  are at present no Symptoms he apprehends not th  least Danger of Life'  Jones  shewed great Satisfac+tion in his Countenance at this Report upon which she affirmed the Truth of it adding  'By the mo  extraordinary Accident in the World I lodge at th  same House and have seen the Gentleman and promise you he doth you Justice and says What ever be the Consequence that he was entirely th  Aggressor and that you was not in the least t  blame'  Jones  expressed the utmost Satisfaction at the Ac+count which Mrs  Waters  brought him He the informed her of many Things which she well knew before as who Mr  Fitzpatrick  was the Occasion o  his Resentment  c  He likewise told her sever  Facts of which she was ignorant as the Adventure  the Muff and other Particulars concealing only th  Name of  Sophia  He then lamented the Follies an  Vices of which he had been guilty every one of which he said had been attended with such ill Consequence  that he should be unpardonoble if he did not take Wan  +ing and quit those vicious Courses for the future H  lastly concluded with assuring her of his Resolution  sin no more lest a worse Thing should happen to him  Mrs  Waters  with great Pleasantry ridiculed all thi  as the Effects of low Spirits and confinement Sh  repeated some Witticisms about  the Devil when  was sick  and told him  'She doubted not but shortl  to see him at Liberty and as lively a Fellow as eve  and then' says she 'I don't question but your Co  +science will be safely delivered of all these Qual  that it is now so sick in breeding'  Many more Things of this Kind she uttered some of which it would do her no great Honour in the Opinion of some Readers to remember nor are we quite certain but that the Answers made by  Jones  would be treated with Ridicule by others We shall therefore suppress the rest of this Conversation and only observe that it ended at last with perfect Innocence and much more to the Satisfaction of  Jones  than of the Lady For the former was greatly transported with the News she had brought him but the  atter was not altogether so pleased with the penitential Behaviour of a Man whom she had at first Interview conceived a very different Opinion of from what she  ow entertained of him  Thus the Melancholy occasioned by the Report of Mr  Nightingale  was pretty well effaced but the De  ection into which Mrs  Miller  had thrown him still continued The Account she gave so well tallied with the Words of  Sophia  herself in her Letter that he made not the least Doubt but that she had disclosed his Letter to her Aunt and had taken a fixed Resolution to abandon him The Torments this Thought gave  im were to be equalled only by a Piece of News which Fortune yet had in Store for him and which we shall communicate in the second Chapter of the ensuing Book  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING  BOOK XVIII  Containing about Six Days  CHAP I  A Farewel to the Reader  WE are now Reader arrived at the last Stage of our long Journey As we have therefore travelled together through so many Pages let us behave to one another like Fellow Traveller in a StageCoach who have passed several Day  in the Company of each other and who notwithstanding any Bickerings or litttle Animositie  which may have occurred on the Road generally make all up at last and mount for the last Time in to their Vehicle with Chearfulness and GoodHumour  since after this one Stage it may possibly happen to us as it commonly happens to them never to meet more  As I have here taken up this Simile give me Leave to carry it a little farther I intend then in this last Book to imitate the good Company I have mentioned in their last Journey Now it is well known that all Jokes and Raillery are at this Time laid aside whatever Characters any of the Passengers have for the lest sake personated on the Road are now thrown off and the Conversation is usually plain and serious  In the same Manner if I have now and then in the Course of this Work indulged any Pleasantry for  y entertainment I shall here lay it down The Variety of Matter indeed which I shall be obliged to  am into this Book will afford no room for any of those ludicrous Observations which I have elsewhere made and which may sometimes perhaps have prevented thee from taking a Nap when it was beginning to steal upon thee In this last Book thou wilt find  thing or at most very little of that Nature All will be plain Narrative only and indeed when thou  st perused the many great Events which this Book will produce thou wilt think the Number of Pages contained in it scarce sufficient to tell the Story  And now my Friend I take this Opportunity as I shall have no other of heartily wishing thee well If I have been an entertaining Companion to thee I promise thee it is what I have desired If in any Thing I have offended it was really without any In  ention Some Things perhaps here said may have  t thee or thy Friends but I do most solemnly declare they were not pointed at them I question not  ut thou hast been told among other Stories of me  hat thou wast to travel with a very scurrilous Fellow But whoever told thee so did me an Injury No Plan detests and despises Scurrility more than myself  or hath any Man more Reason for none has ever  been treated with more And what is a very seven Fate I have had some of the abusive Writings of those very Men fathered upon me who in other of their Works have abused me themselves with the utmost Virulence  All these Works however I am well convinced will be dead long before this Page shall offer itself to thy Perusal For however short the Period may be o  my own Performances they will most probably out live their own infirm Author and the weakly Pro+ductions of his abusive Cotemporaries  CHAP II  Containing a very tragical Incident  WHILE  Jones  was employed in these unplea+sant Meditations with which we left him tor+menting himself  Partridge  came stumbling into th  Room with his Face paler than Ashes his Eyes fixe  in his Head his Hair standing an End and ever  Limb trembling In short he looked as he would have done had he seen a Spectre or had he indeed been a Spectre himself  Jones  who was little subject to Fear could not a+void being somewhat shocked at this sudden Appear+ance He did indeed himself change Colour and h  Voice a little faultered while he asked him what w  the Matter  'I hope Sir' said  Partridge  'you will not  angry with me Indeed I did not listen but I w  obliged to stay in the outward Room I am sure wish I had been a hundred Miles off rather tha  have heard what I have heard'  'Why what is th  Matter'  said  Jones  'The Matter Sir O god Heaven' answered  Partridge  'was that Wom  who is just gone out the Woman who was wi  you at  Upton'  'She was  Partridge'  cries  Jones  'And did you really Sir go to bed with that W  man'  said he trembling  'I am afraid what past between us is no Secret'  said  Jones  'Nay but pray Sir for Heaven's Sake Sir answer me'  cries  Partridge  'You know I did'  cries  Jones  'Why then the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul and forgive you' cries  Partridge  'but as sure as I stand here alive you have been aBed with your own Mother'  Upon these Words  Jones  became in a Moment a greater Picture of Horror than  Partridge  himself He was indeed for some Time struck dumb with Amazement and both stood staring wildly at each other At last his Words found Way and in an interrupted Voice he said  'How how What's this you tell me'  'Nay Sir' cries  Partridge  'I have not Breath enough left to tell you nowbut what I have said is most certainly trueThat Woman who now went out is your own Mother How unlucky was it for you Sir that I did not happen to see her at that Time to have prevented it Sure the Devil himself must have contrived to bring about this Wickedness'  'Sure' cries  Jones  'Fortune will never have done with me 'till she hath driven me to Distraction But why do I blame Fortune I am myself the Cause of all my Misery All the dreadful Mischiefs which have befallen me are the Consequences only of my own Folly and Vice What thou hast told me  Partridge  hath almost deprived me of my Senses And was Mrs  Waters  thenBut why do I ask for thou must certainly know herIf thou hast any Affection for me nay if thou hast any Pity let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable Woman back again to me O good Heavens Incestwith a Mother To what am I reserved'  He then sell into the most violent and frantic Agonies of Grief and Despair in which  Partridge  declared he would  not leave him But at last having vented the first Torrent of Passion he came a little to himself and then having acquainted  Partridge  that he would find this wretched Woman in the same House where the wound+ed Gentleman was lodged he dispatched him in ques  of her  If the Reader will please to refresh his Memory by turning to the Scene at  Upton  in the ninth Book he will be apt to admire the many strange Accident which unfortunately prevented any Interview between  Partridge  and Mrs  Waters  when she spent a whol  Day there with Mr  Jones  Instances of this Kin  we may frequently observe in Life where the great+est Events are produced by a nice Train of little Cir+cumstances and more than one Example of this may be discovered by the accurate Eye in this our His+tory  After a fruitless Search of two or three Hours  Partridge  returned back to his Master without hav+ing seen Mrs  Waters Jones  who was in a Stat  of Desperation at his Delay was almost raving ma  when he brought him this Account He was no  long however in this Condition before he receive the following Letter  Sir  Since I left you I have seen a Gentleman from whom I have learned something concerning yo  which greatly Surprizes and affects me but as I have not at present Leisure to communicate a Matter  such high Importance you must suspend your Curio+sity 'till our next Meeting which shall be the first Mo+ment I am able to see you O Mr  Jones  litt  did I think when I past that happy Day at  Upton  the Reflection upon which is like to embitter all m  future Life who it was to whom I owed such per+fect Happiness Believe me to be ever sincere  your unfortunate  J Waters▪  P S  I would have you comfort yourself as much as possible for Mr  Fitzpatrick  is in no manner of Danger so that whatever other grievous Crimes you may have to repent of the Guilt of Blood is not among the Number  Jones  having received the Letter let it drop for he was unable to hold it and indeed had scarce the Use of any one of his Faculties  Partridge  took it up and having received Consent by Silence read it likewise nor had it upon him a less sensible Effect The Pencil and not the Pen should describe the Horrors which appeared in both their Countenances While they both remained speechless the Turnkey entered the Room and without taking any Notice of what sufficiently discovered itself in the Faces of them both acquainted  Jones  that a Man without desired to speak with him This Person was presently introduced and was no other than Black  George  As Sights of Horror were not so usual to  George  as they were to the Turnkey he instantly saw the great Disorder which appeared in the Face of  Jones  This he imputed to the Accident that happened which was reported in the very worst Light in Mr  Western'  s Family he concluded therefore that the Gentleman was dead and that Mr  Jones  was in a fair Way of coming to a shameful End A Thought which gave him much Uneasiness for  George  was of a compassionate Disposition and notwithstanding a small Breach of Friendship which he had been overtempted to commit was in the main not insensible of the Obligations he had formerly received from Mr  Jones  The poor Fellow therefore scarce refrained from a Tear at the present Sight He told  Jones  he was heartily sorry for his Misfortunes and begged him to  consider if he could be of any manner of Service  'Perhaps Sir said he you may want a little Matter of Money upon this Occasion if you do Sir what little I have is heartily at your Service'  Jones  shook him very heartily by the Hand and gave him many Thanks for the Kind Offer he had made but answered  'He had not the least Wan  of that Kind'  Upon which  George  began to press his Services more eagerly than before  Jones  again thanked him with Assurances that he wanted nothing which was in the Power of any Man living to give  'Come come my good Master answered  George  do not take the Matter so much to Heart Things may end better than you imagine to be sure you ant the first Gentleman who hath killed a Man and yet come off'  'You are wide of the Matter  George  said  Partridge  the Gentleman is not dead nor like to die Don't disturb my Master at present for he is troubled about a Matter in which it is not in your Power to do him any good'  'You don't know what I may be able to do Mr  Partridge  answered  George  if his Concern is about my young Lady I have some News to tell my Master'    'What do you say Mr  George'  cry'd  Jones  hath any thing lately happened in which my  Sophia  is concerned My  Sophia  How dares such a Wretch as I mention her so prophanely'    'I hope she will be yours yet 'answered  George  'Why yes Sir I have something to tell you about her Madam  Western  hath just brought Madam  Sophia  home and there hath been a terrible to do I could not possibly learn the very Right of it but my Master he hath been in a vast big Passion and so was Madam  Western  and I heard her say as she went out of Doors into her Chair that she would never set her Foot in Master's House again I don't know what's the Matter not I but every thing was very quiet when I came out but  Robin  who waited at  Supper said he had never seen the Squire for a long while in such good Humour with young Madam that he kissed her several Times and swore she should be her own Mistress and he never would think of confining her any more I thought this News would please you and so I slipp'd out though it was so late to inform you of it'  Mr  Jones  assured  George  that it did greatly please him for though he should never more presume to lift his Eyes towards that incomparable Creature nothing could so much relieve his Misery as the Satisfaction he should always have in hearing of her Welfare  The rest of the Conversation which passed at the Visit is not important enough to be here related The Reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off and be pleased to hear how this great good Will of the Squire towards his Daughter was brought about  Mrs  Western  on her first Arrival at her Brother's Lodging began to set forth the great Honours and Advantages which would accrue to the Family by the Match with Lord  Fellamar  which her Neice had absolutely refused in which Refusal when the Squire took the Part of his Daughter she fell immediately into the most violent Passion and so irritated and provoked the Squire that neither his Patience nor his Prudence could bear any longer upon which there ensued between them both so warm a Bout at Altercation that perhaps the Regions of  Billingsgate  never equalled it In the Heat of this Scolding Mrs  Western  departed and had consequently no Leisure to acquaint the Brother with the Letter which  Sophia  received which might have possibly produced ill Effects but to say the Truth I believe it never once occurred to her Memory at this Time  When Mrs  Western  was gone  Sophia  who had been hitherto silent as well indeed from Necessity as Inclination began to return the Compliment which  her Father had made her in taking her part against her Aunt by taking his likewise against the Lady This was the first Time of her so doing and it was in the highest Degree acceptable to the Squire Again he remembered that Mr  Allworthy  had insisted on an entire Relinquishment of all violent Means and indeed as he made no doubt but that  Jones  would be hanged he did not in the least question succeeding with his Daughter by fair Means he now therefore once more gave a Loose to his natural Fondness for her which had such an Effect on the Dutiful grateful tender and Affectionate Heart of  Sophia  that had her Honour given to  Jones  and something else perhaps in which he was concerned been removed I much doubt whether she would not have sacrificed herself to a Man she did not like to have obliged her Father She promised him she would make it the whole Business of her Life to oblige him and would never marry any Man against his Consent which brought the old Man so near to his highest Happiness that he was resolved to take the other Step and went to Bed completely drunk  CHAP III Allworthy  visits old  Nightingale  with a strange Discovery that he made on that Occasion  THE Morning after these Things had happened Mr  Allworthy  went according to his Promise to visit old  Nightingale  with whom his Authority was so great that after having sat with him three Hours he at last prevailed with him to consent to see his Son  Here an Accident happened of a very extraordinary Kind one indeed of those strange Chances whence very good and grave Men have concluded that Providence often interposes in the Discovery of  the most secret Villainy in order to caution Men from quitting the Paths of Honesty however warily they tread in those of Vice  Mr  Allworthy  at his Entrance into Mr  Nightingale'  s saw black  George  he took no Notice of him nor did Black  George  imagine he had perceived him However when their Conversation on the principal Point was over  Allworthy  asked  Nightingale  whether he knew one  George Seagrim  and upon what Business he came to his House  'Yes answered  Nightingale  I know him very well and a most extraordinary Fellow he is who in these Days hath been able to hoard up  l  from renting a very small Estate of  l  a Year'  'And is this the Story he hath told you cries  Allworthy'  'Nay it is true I promise you' said  Nightingale  'for I have the Money now in my Hands in five Bank Bills which I am to lay out either in a Mortgage or in some Purchase in the North of  England  '  The Bank Bills were no sooner produced at  Allworthy'  s Desire than he blessed himself at the Strangeness of the Discovery He presently told  Nightingale  that these Bank Bills were formerly his and then acquainted him with the whole Affair As there are no Men who complain more of the Frauds of Business than Highwaymen Gamesters and other Thieves of that Kind so there are none who so bitterly exclaim against the Frauds of Gamesters  c  as Usurers Brokers and other Thieves of this Kind whether it be that the one Way of cheating is a Discountenance or Reflection upon the other or that Money which is the common Mistress of all Cheats makes them regard each other in the Light of Rivals but  Nightingale  no sooner heard the Story than he exclaimed against the Fellow in Terms much severer than the Justice and Honesty of  Allworthy  had bestowed on him  Allworthy  desired  Nightingale  to retain both the Money and the Secret till he should hear farther from him and if he should in the mean Time see the Fellow that he would not take the least Notice to him of the Discovery which he had made He then returned to his Lodgings where he found Mrs  Miller  in a very dejected Condition on Account of the Information she had received from her Soninlaw Mr  Allworthy  with great Chearfulness told her that he had much good News to communicate and with little further Preface acquainted her that he had brought Mr  Nightingale  to consent to see his Son and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect Reconciliation between them though he found the Father more sowered by another Accident of the same Kind which had happened in his Family He then mentioned the running away of the Uncle's Daughter which he had been told by the old Gentleman and which Mrs  Miller  and her Soninlaw did not yet know  The Reader may suppose Mrs  Miller  received this Account with great Thankfulness and no less Pleasure but so uncommon was her Friendship to  Jones  that I am not certain whether the Uneasiness she suffered for his Sake did not overballance her Satisfaction at hearing a Piece of News tending so much to the Happiness of her own Family nor whether even this very News as it reminded her of the Obligations she had to  Jones  did not hurt as well as please her when her grateful Heart said to her  'While my own Family is happy how miserable is the poor Creature to whose Generosity we owe the Beginning of all this Happiness'  Allworthy  having left her a little while to chew the Cud if I may use that Expression on these first Tidings told her he had still something more to impart which he believed would give her Pleasure  'I think said he I have discovered a pretty considerable Treasure  belonging to the young Gentleman your Friend but perhaps indeed his present Situation may be such that it will be of no Service to him'  The latter Part of the Speech gave Mrs  Miller  to understand who was meant and she answered with a Sigh  'I hope not Sir'  'I hope so too' cries  Allworthy  'with all my Heart but my Nephew told me this Morning he had heard a very bad Account of the Affair'    'Good Heaven Sir' said sheWell I must not speak and yet it is certainly very hard to be obliged to hold one's Tongue when one hears'    'Madam said  Allworthy  you may say whatever you please you know me too well to think I have a Prejudice against any one and as for that young Man I assure you I should be heartily pleased to find he could acquit himself of every thing and particularly of this sad Affair You can testify the Affection I have formerly borne him The World I know censured me for loving him so much I did not withdraw that Affection from him without thinking I had the justest Cause Believe me Mrs  Miller  I should be glad to find I have been mistaken'  Mrs  Miller  was going eagerly to reply when a Servant acquainted her that a Gentleman without desired to speak with her immediately  Allworthy  then enquired for his Nephew and was told that he had been for some Time in his Room with the Gentleman who used to come to him and whom Mr  Allworthy  guessing rightly to be Mr  Dowling  he desired presently to speak with him  When  Dowling  attended  Allworthy  put the Case of the BankNotes to him without mentioning any Name and asked in what manner such a Person might be punished To which  Dowling  answered he thought he might be indicted on the Black Act but said as it was a Matter of some Nicety it would be proper to go to Council He said he was to attend Council presently upon an Affair of Mr  Western'  s and if  Mr  Allworthy  pleased he would lay the Case before them This was agreed to and then Mrs  Miller  opening the Door cry'd  'I ask pardon I did not know you had Company'  but  Allworthy  desired her to come in saying he had finished his Business Upon which Mr  Dowling  withdrew and Mrs  Miller  introduced Mr  Nightingale  the younger to return thanks for the great Kindness done him by  Allworthy  but she had scarce Patience to let the young Gentleman finish his Speech before she interrupted him saying  'O Sir Mr  Nightingale  brings great News about poor Mr  Jones  he hath been to see the wounded Gentleman who is out of all Danger of Death and what is more declares he fell upon poor Mr  Jones  himself and beat him I am sure Sir you would not have Mr  Jones  be a Coward If I was a Man myself I am sure if any Man was to strike me I should draw my Sword Do pray my Dear tell Mr  Allworthy  tell him all yourself'  Nightingale  then confirmed what Mrs  Miller  had said and concluded with many handsome Things of  Jones  who was he said one of the bestnatured Fellows in the World and not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome Here  Nightingale  was going to cease when Mrs  Miller  again begged him to related all the many dutiful Expressions he had heard him make use of towards Mr  Allworthy  'To say the utmost Good of Mr  Allworthy  cries  Nightingale  is doing no more than strict Justice and can have no Merits in it but indeed I must say no Man can be more sensible of the Obligations he hath to so good a  Man than is poor  Jones  Indeed Sir I am convinced the Weight of your Displeasure is the heaviest Burthen he lies under He hath often lamented it to me and hath as often protested in the most solemn Manner he had never been intentionally guilty of any Offence towards you nay he hath sworn he would rather die a Thousand Deaths than  he would have his Conscience upbraid him with one disrespectful ungrateful or undutiful Thought towards you But I ask pardon Sir I am afraid I presume to intermeddle too far in so tender a Point'  'You have spoke no more than what a Christian ought cries Mrs  Miller'  'Indeed Mr  Nightingale  answered  Allworthy  'I applaud your generous Friendship and I wish he may merit it of you I confess I am glad to hear the Report you bring from this unfortunate Gentleman and if that Matter should turn out to be as you represent it and indeed I doubt nothing of what you say I may perhaps in Time be brought to think better than lately I have of this young Man For this good Gentle woman here nay all who know me can witness that I loved him as dearly as if he had been my own Son Indeed I have considered him as a Child sent by Fortune to my Care I still remember the innocent the helpless Situation in which I found him I feel the tender Pressure of his little Hands at this MomentHe was my Darling indeed he was'  At which Words he ceased and the Tears stood in his Eyes  As the Answer which Mrs  Miller  made may lead us into fresh Matters we will here stop to account for the visible Alteration in Mr  Allworthy'  s Mind and the Abatement of his Anger to  Jones  Revolutions of this Kind it is true do frequently occur in Histories and dramatic Writers for no other Reason than because the History or Play draws to a Conclusion and are justified by Authority of Authors yet though we insist upon as much Authority as any Author whatever we shall use this Power very sparingly and never but when we are driven to it by Necessity which we do not at present foresee will happen in this Work  This Alteration then in the Mind of Mr  Allworthy  was occasioned by a Letter he had just received  from Mr  Square  and which we shall give the Reader in the Beginning of the next Chapter  CHAP IV  Containing two Letters in very different Stiles  My worthy Friend  I informed you in my last that I was forbidden the Use of the Waters as they were found by Experience rather to encrease than lessen the Symptoms of my Distemper I must now acquaint you with a Piece of News which I believe will afflict my Friends more than it hath afflicted me Dr  Harrington  and Dr  Brewster  have informed me that there is no Hopes of my Recovery  I have somewhere read that the great Use of Philosophy is to learn to die I will not therefore so far disgrace mine as to shew any Surprize at receiving a Lesson which I must be thought to have so long studied Yet to say the Truth one Page of the Gospel teaches this Lesson better than all the Volumes of antient or modern Philosophers The Assurance it gives us of another Life is a much stronger support to a good Mind than all the Consolations that are drawn from the Necessity of Nature the Emptiness or Satiety of our Enjoyments here or any other Topic of those Declamations which are sometimes capable of arming our Minds with a stubborn Patience in bearing the Thoughts of Death but never of raising them to a real Contempt of it and much less of making us think it a real Good I would not here be understood to throw the horrid Censure of Atheism or even the absolute Denial of Immortality on all who are called Philosophers Many of that Sect aswell antient as modern have from the Light of Reason discovered some Hopes of a future State but in Reality that Light was so faint and glimmering  and the Hopes were so incertain and precarious that it may be justly doubted on which Side their Belief turned  Plato  himself conludes his  Phaedon  with declaring that his best Arguments amount only to raise a Probability and  Cicero  himself seems rather to profess an Inclination to believe than any actual Belief in the Doctrines of Immortality As to myself to be very sincere with you I never was much in earnest in this Faith till I was in earnest a Christian  You will perhaps wonder at the latter Expression but I assure you it hath not been till very lately that I could with Truth call myself so The Pride of Philosophy had intoxicated my Reason and the sublimest of all Wisdom appeared to me as it did to the  Greeks  of old to be Foolishness God hath however been so gracious to shew me my Error in Time and to bring me into the Way of Truth before I sunk into utter Darkness for ever  I find myself beginning to grow very weak I shall therefore hasten to the main Purpose of this Letter  When I reflect on the Actions of my past Life I know of nothing which sits heavier upon my Conscience than the Injustice I have been guilty of to that poor Wretch your adopted Son I have not indeed only connived at the Villany of others but been myself active in Injustice towards him Believe me my dear Friend when I tell you on the Word of a dying Man he has been basely injured As to the principal Fact upon the Misrepresentation of which you discarded him I solemnly assure you he is innocent When you lay upon your supposed Deathbed he was the only Person in the House who testified any real Concern and what happened afterwards arose from the Wildness of his Joy on your Recovery  and I am sorry to say it from the Baseness of another Person but it is my Desire to justify the Innocent and to accuse none Believe me my Friend this young Man hath the noblest Generosity of Heart the most perfect Capacity for Friendship the highest Integrity and indeed every Virtue which can ennoble a Man He hath some Faults but among them is not to be numbred the least want of Duty or Gratitude towards you On the contrary I am satisfied when you dismissed him from your House his Heart bled for you more than for himself  Worldly Motives were the wicked and base Reasons of my concealing this from you so long to reveal it now I can have no Inducement but the Desire of serving the Cause of Truth of doing Right to the Innocent and of making all the Amends in my Power for a past Offence I hope this Declaration therefore will have the Effect desired and will restore this deserving young Man to your Favour the hearing of which while I am yet alive will afford the utmost Consolation to  Sir  Your most obliged Obedient humble Servant Thomas Square  The Reader will after this scarce wonder at the Revolution so visibly appearing in Mr  Allworthy  notwithstanding he received from  Thwackum  by the same Post another Letter of a very different Kind which we shall here add as it may possibly be the last Time we shall have occasion to mention the Name of that Gentleman  Sir  I am not at all surprized at hearing from your worthy Nephew a fresh Instance of the Villany of  Mr  Square  the Atheist's young Pupil I shall not wonder at any Murders he may commit and I heartily pray that your own Blood may not seal up his final Commitment to the Place of Wailing and gnashing of Teeth  Though you cannot want sufficient Calls to Repentance for the many unwarrantable Weaknesses exemplified in your Behaviour to this Wretch so much to the Prejudice of your own lawful Family and of your Character I say tho' these may sufficiently be supposed to prick and goad your Conscience at this Season I should yet be wanting to my Duty if I spared to give you some Admonition in order to bring you to a due Sense of your Errors I therefore pray you seriously to consider the Judgment which is likely to overtake this wicked Villain and let it serve at least as a Warning to you that you may not for the future despise the Advice of one who is indefatigable in his Prayers for your Welfare  Had not my Hand been withheld from due Correction I had scourged much of this diabolical Spirit out of a Boy of whom from his Infancy I discovered the Devil had taken such entire Possession but Reflections of this Kind now come too late  I am sorry you have given away the Living of  Westerton  so hastily I should have applied on that Occasion earlier had I thought you would not have acquainted me previous to the DispositionYour Objection to Pluralities is being righteous overmuch If there were any Crime in the Practice so many godly Men would not agree to it If the Vicar of  Aldergrove  should die as we hear he is in a declining Way I hope you will think of me since I am certain you must be convinced of my most sincere Attachment to your highest Welfare A Welfare to which all worldly Considerations are  as trifling as the small Tithes mentioned in Scripture are when compared to the weighty Matters of the Law  I am Sir Your faithful humble Servant  Roger Thwackum  This was the first Time that  Thwackum  eve  wrote in this authoritative Stile to  Allworthy  and of this he had afterwards sufficient Reason to re+pent as in the Case of those who mistake the high+est Degree of Goodness for the lowest Degree o  Weakness  Allworthy  had indeed never liked thi  Man He knew him to be proud and illnatured he also knew that his Divinity itself was tincture with his Temper and such as in many Respects h  himself did by no means approve But he was at th  same Time an excellent Scholar and most indefati+gable in teaching the two Lads Add to this th  strict Severity of his Life and Manners an unim+peached Honesty and a most devout Attachment to Religion So that upon the whole though  Allworthy  did not esteem nor love the Man yet he could never bring himself to part with a Tutor to the Boys wh  was both by Learning and Industry extremely we  qualified for his Office and he hoped that as they were bred up in his own House and under his own Eye he should be able to correct whatever was wrong in  Thwackum'  s Instructions  CHAP V  In which the History is continued  MR  Allworthy  in his last Speech had recollecte  some tender Ideas concerning  Jones  which had brought Tears into the good Man's Eyes Thi  Mrs  Miller  observing said  'Yes yes Sir your Goodness to this poor young Man is known not+withstanding all your Care to conceal it but there  is not a single Syllable of Truth in what those Villains said Mr  Nightingale  hath now discovered the whole Matter It seems these Fellows were employed by a Lord who is a Rival of poor Mr  Jones  to have pressed him on board a ShipI assure them I don't know who they will press next Mr  Nightingale  here hath seen the Officer himself who is a very pretty Gentleman and hath told him all and is very sorry for what he undertook which he would never have done had he known Mr  Jones  to have been a Gentleman but he was told that he was a common strolling Vagabond'  Allworthy  stared at all this and declared he was a Stranger to every Word she said  'Yes Sir' answered she 'I believe you areIt is a very different Story I believe from what those Fellows told the Lawyer'  'What Lawyer Madam what is it you mean'  said  Allworthy  'Nay nay' said she 'this is so like you to deny your own Goodness but Mr  Nightingale  here saw him'  'Saw whom Madam'  answered he  'Why your Lawyer Sir' said she 'that you so kindly sent to enquire into the Affair'  'I am still in the Dark upon my Honour'  said  Allworthy  'Why then do you tell him my dear Sir'  cries she  'Indeed Sir' said  Nightingale  'I did see that very Lawyer who went from you when I came into the Room at an Alehouse in  Aldersgate  in Company with two of the Fellows who were employed by Lord  Fellamar  to press Mr  Jones  and who were by that Means present at the unhappy Rencounter between him and Mr  Fitzpatrick  '  'I own Sir' said Mrs  Miller  'when I saw this Gentleman come into the Room to you I told Mr  Nightingale  that I apprehended you had sent him thither to enquire into the Affair'  Allworthy  shewed Marks of Astonishment  in his Countenance at this News and was indeed for two or three Minutes struck dumb by it At last addressing himself to Mr  Nightingale  he said  'I must confess myself Sir more surprized at what you tell me than I have ever been before at any Thing in my whole Life Are you certain this was the Gentleman'  'I am most certain'  answered  Nightingale  'At  Aldersgate'  cries  Allworthy  'And was you in Company with this Lawyer and the two Fellows'    'I was Sir' said the other 'very near half an Hour'    'Well Sir' said  Allworthy  'and in what Manner did the Lawyer behave Did you hear all that past between him and the Fellows'  'No Sir answered  Nightingale  'they had been together before I cameIn my Presence the Lawyer said little but after I had several Times examined the Fellows who persisted in a Story directly contrary to what I had heard from Mr  Jones  and what I find by Mr  Fitzpatrick  was a rank Falshood the Lawyer then desired the Fellows to say nothing but what was the Truth and seemed to speak so much in Favour of Mr  Jones  that when I saw the same Person with you I concluded your Goodness had prompted you to send him thither    'And did you not send him thither'  says Mrs  Miller'  'Indeed I did not' answered  Allworthy  'nor did I know he had gone on such an Errand 'till this Moment'    'I see it all' said Mrs  Miller  'Upon my Soul I see it all No wonder they have been closetted so close lately Son  Nightingale  let me beg you run for these Fellows immediatelyfind them out if they are above Ground I will go myself'    'Dear Madam' said  Allworthy  'be patient and do me the Favour to send a Servant up Stairs to call Mr  Dowling  hither if he be in the House or if not Mr  Blifil  '  Mrs  Miller  went out muttering  something to herself and presently returned with an Answer  'That Mr  Dowling  was gone but that the t'other as she called him was coming'  Allworthy  was of a cooler Disposition than the good Woman whose Spirits were all up in Arms in the Cause of her Friend He was not however without some Suspicions which were near akin to hers When  Blifil  came into the Room he asked him with a very serious Countenance and with a less friendly Look than he had ever before given him  'Whether he knew any Thing of Mr  Dowling'  s having seen any of the Persons who were present at the Duel between  Jones  and another Gentleman'  There is nothing so dangerous as a Question which comes by Surprize on a Man whose Business it is to conceal Truth or defend Falshood For which Reason those worthy Personages whose noble Office it is to save the Lives of their FellowCreatures at the  OldBaily  take the utmost Care by frequent previous Examination to divine every Question which may be asked their Clients on the Day of Trial that they may be supply'd with proper and ready Answers which the most fertile Invention cannot supply in an Instant Besides the sudden and violent Impulse on the Blood occasioned by these Surprizes occasions frequently such an Alteration in the Countenance that the Man is obliged to give Evidence against himself And such indeed were the Alterations which the Countenance of  Blifil  underwent from this sudden Question that we can scarce blame the Eagerness of Mrs  Miller  who immediately cry'd out  'Guilty upon my Honour Guilty upon my Soul'  Mr  Allworthy  sharply rebuked her for this Impetuosity and then turning to  Blifil  who seemed sinking into the Earth he said  'Why do you hesitate Sir at giving me an Answer You certainly must have employed him for he would not of his own  Accord I believe have undertaken such an Errand and especially without acquainting me'  Blifil  then answered  'I own Sir I have been guilty of an Offence yet may I hope your Pardon'    'My Pardon'  said  Allworthy  very angrily  'Nay Sir' answered  Blifil  'I knew you would be offended yet surely my dear Uncle will forgive the Effects of the most amiable of Human Weaknesses Compassion for those who do not deserve it I own is a Crime and yet it is a Crime from which you yourself are not entirely free I know I have been guilty of it in more than one Instance to this very Person and I will own I did send Mr  Dowling  not on a vain and fruitless Enquiry but to discover the Witnesses and to endeavour to soften their Evidence This Sir is the Truth which though I intended to conceal from you I will not deny'  'I confess' said  Nightingale  'this is the Light in which it appeared to me from the Gentleman's Behaviour'  'Now Madam' said  Allworthy  'I believe you will once in your Life own you have entertained a wrong Suspicion and are not so angry with my Nephew as you was'  Mrs  Miller  was silent for though she could not so hastily be pleased with  Blifil  whom she looked upon to have been the Ruin of  Jones  yet in this particular Instance he had imposed upon her as well as the rest so entirely had the Devil stood his Friend And indeed I look upon the vulgar Observation  That the Devil often deserts his Friends and leaves them in the Lurch  to be a great Abuse on that Gentleman's Character Perhaps he may sometimes desert those who are only his Cup Acquaintance or who at most are but half his but he generally stands by those who are thoroughly his Servants and  helps them off in all Extremities 'till their Bargain expires  As a conquered Rebellion strengthens a Government or as Health is more perfectly established by Recovery from some Diseases so Anger when removed often gives new Life to Affection This was the Case of Mr  Allworthy  for  Blifil  having wiped off the greater Suspicion the lesser which had been raised by  Square'  s Letter sunk of Course and was forgotten and  Thwackum  with whom he was greatly offended bore alone all the Reflections which  Square  had cast on the Enemies of  Jones  As for that young Man the Resentment of Mr  Allworthy  began more and more to abate towards him He told  Blifil  'he did not only forgive the extraordinary Efforts of his GoodNature but would give him the Pleasure of following his Example'  Then turning to Mrs  Miller  with a Smile which would have become an Angel he cry'd  'What say you Madam shall we take a HackneyCoach and all of us together pay a Visit to your Friend I promise you it is not the first Visit I have made in a Prison'  Every Reader I believe will be able to answer for the worthy Woman but they must have a great deal of GoodNature and be well acquainted with Friendship who can feel what she felt on this Occasion Few I hope are capable of feeling what now past in the Mind of  Blifil  but those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to raise any Objection to this Visit Fortune however or the Gentleman lately mentioned above stood his Friend and prevented his undergoing so great a Shock For at the very Instant when the Coach was sent for  Partridge  arrived and having called Mrs  Miller  from the Company acquainted her with the dreadful Accident lately come to Light and hearing Mr  Allworthy'  s  Intention begged her to find some Means of stopping him for says he  'the Matter must at all Hazards be kept a Secret from him and if he should now go he will find Mr  Jones  and his Mother who arrived just as I left him lamenting over one another the horrid Crime they have ignorantly committed'  The poor Woman who was almost deprived of her Senses at this dreadful News was never less capable of Invention than at present However as Women are much readier at this than Men she bethought herself of an Excuse and returning to  Allworthy  said  'I am sure Sir you will be surprized at hearing any Objection from me to the kind Proposal you just now made and yet I am afraid of the Consequence of it if carried immediately into Execution You must imagine Sir that all the Calamities which have lately befallen this poor young Fellow must have thrown him into the lowest Dejection of Spirits And now Sir should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent Fit of Joy as I know your Presence will occasion it may I am afraid produce some fatal Mischief especially as his Servant who is without tells me he is very far from being well'  'Is his Servant without' cries  Allworthy  'pray call him hither I will ask him some Questions concerning his Master'  Partridge  was at first afraid to appear before Mr  Allworthy  but was at length persuaded after Mrs  Miller  who had often heard his whole Story from his own Mouth had promised to introduce him  Allworthy  recollected  Partridge  the Moment he came into the Room though many Years had passed since he had seen him Mrs  Miller  therefore might have spared here a formal Oration in which indeed she was somewhat prolix For the Reader I believe  may have observed already that the good Woman among other Things had a Tongue always ready for  he Service of her Friends  'And are you' said  Allworthy  to  Partridge  'the Servant of Mr  Jones'  '  'I can't say Sir' answered he 'that I am regularly a Servant but I live with him an't please your Honour at present  Non sum qualis eram  as your Honour very well knows'  Mr  Allworthy  then asked him many Questions concerning  Jones  as to his Health and other Matters to all which  Partridge  answered without having the least Regard to what was but considered only what he would have Things appear for a strict Adherence to Truth was not among the Articles of this honest Fellow's Morality or his Religion  During this Dialogue Mr  Nightingale  took his  eave and presently after Mrs  Miller  lest the Room then  Allworthy  likewise dispatched  Blifil  for he ima  ined that  Partridge  when alone with him would be  ore explicit than before Company They were no  oner left in private together than  Allworthy  began  in the following Chapter  CHAP VI  In which the History is farther continued  'SURE Friend' said the good Man 'you are the strangest of all Human Beings Not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately persisting in a Falshood but to persist in it thus to the last and to pass thus upon the World for the Servant of your own Son What Interest can you have in all this What can be your Motive'  'I see Sir' said  Partridge  falling down upon  s Knees 'that your Honour is prepossessed against me and resolved not to believe any Thing I say  and therefore what signifies my Protestations but yet there is one above who knows that I am not the Father of this young Man'  'How' said  Allworthy  'Will you yet deny what you was formerly convicted of upon such unanswerable such manifest Evidence Nay what a Confirmation is your being now found with this very Man of all which twenty Years ago appeared against you I thought you had left the Country nay I thought you had been long since deadIn what Manner did you know any Thing of this young Man Where did you meet with him unless you had kept some Correspondence together Do not deny this for I promise you it will greatly raise your Son in my Opinion to find that he hath such a Sense of filial Duty as privately to support his Father for so many Years'  'If your Honour will have Patience to hear me' said  Partridge  'I will tell you all'Being bid go on he proceeded thus 'When your Honour conceived that Displeasure against me it ended in my Ruin soon after for I lost my little School and the Minister thinking I suppose it would be agreeable to your Honour turned me out from the Office of Clerk so that I had nothing to trust to but the Barber's Shop which in a Country Place like that is a poor Livelihood and when my Wife died for 'till that Time I received a Pension of  l  a Year from an unknown Hand which indeed I believe was your Honour's own for no Body that ever I heard of doth these Things besides but as I was saying when she died this Pension forsook me so that now as I owed two or three small Debts which began to be troublesome to me particulary one  This is a Fact which I knew happen to a poor Clergyman in  Dorsetshire  by the Villainy of an Attorney who not contented with the exorbitant Costs to which the poor Man was put by a single Action brought afterwards another Action on the Judgment as it is called A Method frequently used to oppress the poor and bring Money into the Pockets of Attornies to the great Scandal of the Law of the Nation of Christianity and even of Human Nature itself  which an Attorney brought up by  Lawcharges from  s  to near  l  and as I found all my usual Means of living had forsook me I packed up my little All as well as I could and went off'  'The first Place I came to was  Salisbury  where I got into the Service of a Gentleman belonging to the Law and one of the best Gentlemen that ever I knew for he was not only good to me but I know a thousand good and charitable Acts which he did while I staid with him and I have known him often refuse Business because it was paultry and oppressive'    'You need not be so particular' said  Allworthy  'I know this Gentleman and a very worthy Man he is and an Honour to his Profession'    'Well Sir' continued  Partridge  'from hence I removed to  Lymmington  where I was above three Years in the Service of another Lawyer who was likewise a very good Sort of a Man and to be sure one of the merriest Gentlemen in  England  Well Sir at the End of the three Years I set up a little School and was likely to do well again had it not been for a most unlucky Accident Here I kept a Pig and one Day as ill Fortune would have it this Pig broke out and did a Trespass I think they call it in a Garden belonging to one of my Neighbours who was a proud revengeful Man and employed a Lawyer oneoneI can't think of his Name but he sent for a writ against me and had me to Size When I came there Lord have Mercy upon meto hear what the  Counsellor said There was one that told my Lord a Parcel of the confoundedst Lies about me he said that I used to drive my Hogs into other Folks Gardens and a great deal more and at last he said He hoped I had at last brought my Hogs to a fair Market To be sure one wou'd have thought that instead of being Owner only of one poor little Pig I had been the greatest HogMerchant in  England  Well'    'Pray' said  Allworthy  do not be so particular I have heard nothing of your Son yet'  'O it was a great many Years' answered  Partridge  before I saw my Son as you are pleased to call himI went over to  Ireland  after this and taught School at  Cork  for that one Suit ruined me again and I lay seven Years in  Winchester  Goal'    'Well' said  Allworthy  'pass that over till your Return to  England    'Then Sir' said he 'it was about half a Year ago that I landed at  Bristol  where I stayed some Time and not finding it do there and hearing of a Place between that and  Gloucester  where the Barber was just dead I went thither and there I had been about two Months when Mr  Jones  came thither'  He then gave  Allworthy  a very particular Account of their first Meeting and of every Thing as well as he could remember which had happened from that Day to this frequently interlarding his Story with Panegyricks on  Jones  and not forgetting to insinuate the great Love and Respect which he had for  Allworthy  He concluded with saying  'Now Sir I have told your Honour the whole Truth' And then repeated a most solemn Protestation 'That he was no more the Father of  Jones  then of the Pope of  Rome  and imprecated the most birt  C  ses on his Head if he did not speak Truth  'What am I to think of this Ma  ter' cries  Allworthy  'For what Purpose should you so strongly  it would be rather your  Interest to own'    'Nay Sir' answered  Partridge  for he could hold no longer 'if your Honour will not believe me you are like soon to have satisfaction enough I wish you had mistaken the Mother of this young Man as well as you have his Father'  And now being asked what he meant with all the Symptoms of Horror both in his Voice and Countenance he told  Allworthy  the whole Story which he had a little before expressed such Desire to Mrs  Miller  to conceal from him  Allworthy  was almost as much shocked at this Discovery as  Partridge  himself had been while he related it  'Good Heavens' says he 'in what miserable Distresses do Vice and Imprudence involve Men How much beyond our Designs are the Effects of Wickedness sometimes carrried'  He had scarce uttered these Words when Mrs  Waters  came hastily and abruptly into the Room  Partridge  no sooner saw her than he cry'd  'Here Sir here is the very Woman herself This is the unfortunate Mother of Mr  Jones  I am sure she will acquit me before your HonourPray Madam'  Mrs  Waters  without paying any Regard to what  Partridge  said and almost without taking any Notice of him advanced to Mr  Allworthy  'I believe Sir It is so long since I had the Honour of seeing you that you do not recollect me'    'Indeed' answered  Allworthy  'you are so very much altered on many Accounts that had not this Man already acquainted me who you are I should not have immediately called you to my Remembrance Have you Madam any particular Business which brings you to me'  Allworthy  spoke this with great Reserve for the Reader may easily believe he was not well pleased with the Conduct of this Lady neither with what he had formerly heard nor with what  Partridge  had now delivered  Mrs  Waters  answered  'Indeed Sir I have very particular Business with you and it is such as I can only impart to yourselfI must desire therefore the Favour of a Word with you alone for I assure you what I have to tell you is of the utmost Importance'  Partridge  was then ordered to withdraw but before he went he begged the Lady to satisfy Mr  Allworthy  that he was perfectly innocent To which she answered  'You need be under no Apprehension Sir I shall satisfy Mr  Allworthy  very perfectly of that Matter'  Then  Partridge  withdrew and that past between Mr  Allworthy  and Mrs  Waters  which is written in the next Chapter  CHAP VII  Continuation of the History  MRS  Waters  remaining a few Moments silent Mr  Allworthy  could not refrain from saying  'I am sorry Madam to perceive by what I have since heard that you have made so very ill a Use'    'Mr  Allworthy'  says she interrupting him 'I know I have Faults but Ingratitude to you is not one of them I never can nor shall forget your Goodness which I own I have very little deserved but be pleased to wave all Upbraiding me at present as I have so important an Affair to communicate to you concerning this young Man to whom you have given my Maiden Name of  Jones'  'Have I then' said  Allworthy  'ignorantly punished an innocent Man in the Person of him who hath just left us was he not the Father of the Child'    'Indeed he was not' said Mrs  Waters  'You may be pleased to remember Sir I formerly told you you should one Day know and I acknowledge myself to have been guilty of a cruel Neglect  in not having discovered it to you beforeIndeed I little knew how necessary it was'    'Well Madam' said  Allworthy  'be pleased to proceed'  'You must remember Sir' said she 'a young Fellow whose Name was  Summer  '  'Very well' cries  Allworthy  'he was the Son of a Clergyman of great Learning and Virtue for whom I had the highest Friendship'  'So it appeared Sir' answered she 'for I believe you bred the young Man up and maintained him at the University where I think he had finished his Studies when he came to reside at your House a finer Man I must say the Sun never shone upon for besides the handsomest Person I ever saw he was so genteel and had so much Wit and good Breeding'  'Poor Gentleman' said  Allworthy  'he was indeed untimely snatch'd away and little did I think he had any Sins of this kind to answer for for I plainly perceive you are going to tell me he was the Father of your Child'  'Indeed Sir' answered she he was not'  'How' said  Allworthy  'to what then tends all this Preface'  'to a Story Sir' said she 'which I am concerned it falls to my Lot to unfold to youO Sir prepare to hear something which will Surprize you will grieve you'  'Speak' said  Allworthy  'I am conscious of no Crime and cannot be afraid to hear'    'Sir said she that Mr  Summer  the Son of your Friend educated at your Expence who after living a Year in the House as if he had been your own Son died there of the small Pox was tenderly lamented by you and buried as if he had been your own that  Summer  Sir was the Father of this Child'    'How' said  Allworthy  'you contradict yourself'    'That I do not' answered she 'he was indeed the father of this Child but not by me'  'Take care Madam' said  Allworthy  'do not to shun the Imputation of any Crime be guilty of Falsehood  Remember there is one from whom you can conceal nothing and before whose Tribunal Falsehood will only aggravate your Guilt'  'Indeed Sir' says she 'I am not his Mother nor would I now think myself so for the World'  'I know your Reason' said  Allworthy  'and shall rejoice as much as you to find it otherwise yet you must remember you yourself confessed it before me'    'So far what I confest' said she 'was true that these Hands coveyed the Infant to your Bed conveyed it thither at the Command of its Mother at her Commands I afterwards owned it and thought myself by her Generosity nobly rewarded both for my Secrecy and my Shame'  'Who could this Woman be'  said  Allworthy    'Indeed I tremble to Name her'  answered Mrs  Waters  'By all this Preparation I am to guess that she was a Relation of mine'  cried he  'Indeed she was a near one'  At which Words  Allworthy  started and she continued  'You had a Sister Sir'    'A Sister'  repeated he looking aghast  'As there is Truth in Heaven' cries she 'your Sister was the Mother of that Child you found between your Sheets'  'Can it be possible' cries he 'good Heavens'  'Have Patience Sir' said Mrs  Waters  'and I will unfold to you the whole Story Just after your Departure for  London  Miss  Bridget  came one Day to the House of my Mother She was pleased to say she had heard an extraordinary Character of me for my Learning and superior Understanding to all the young Women there so she was pleased to say She then bid me come to her to the great House where when I attended she employed me to read to her She expressed great Satisfaction in my reading shewed great Kindness to me and made me many Presents At last she began to catechise me on the Subject of Secrecy to which I gave her such satisfactory Answers that at last having locked the  Door of her Room she took me into her Closet and then locking that Door likewise she said she should convince me of the vast Reliance she had on my Integrity by communicating a Secret in which her Honour and consequently her Life was concerned She then stopt and after a Silence of a Minute during which she often wiped her Eyes she enquired of me if I thought my Mother might safely be confided in I answered I would stake my Life on her Fidelity She then imparted to me the great Secret which laboured in her Breast and which I believe was delivered with more Pains than she afterwards suffered in Childbirth It was then contrived that my Mother and myself only should attend at the Time and that Mrs  Wilkins  should be sent out of the Way as she accordingly was to the very furthest Part of  Dorsetshire  to enquire the Character of a Servant for the Lady had turned away her own Maid near three Months before during all which Time I officiated about her Person upon Trial as she said tho' as she afterwards declared I was not sufficiently handy for the Place This and many other such Things which she used to say of me were all thrown out to prevent any Suspicion which  Wilkins  might hereafter have when I was to own the Child for she thought it could never be believed she would venture to hurt a young Woman with whom she had intrusted such a Secret You may be assured Sir I was well paid for all these Affronts which together with being informed of the Occasion of them very well contented me Indeed the Lady had a greater Suspicion of Mrs  Wilkins  than of any other Person not that she had the least Aversion to the Gentlewoman but she thought her incapable of keeping a Secret especially from you Sir For I have often heard Miss  Bridget  say that if Mrs  Wilkins  had committed a Murder she believed  she would acquaint you with it At last the expected Day came and Mrs  Wilkins  who had been kept a Week in Readiness and put off from Time to Time upon some Pretence or other that she might not return too soon was dispatched Then the Child was born in the Presence only of myself and my Mother and was by my Mother conveyed to her own House where it was privately kept by her till the Evening of your Return when I by the Command of Miss  Bridget  conveyed it into the Bed where you found it' And all Suspicions were afterwards laid asleep by the artful Conduct of your Sister in pretending Illwill to the Boy and that any Regard she shew'd him was out of meer Complaisance to you'  Mrs  Waters  then made many Protestations of the Truth of this Story and concluded by saying  'Thus Sir you have at last discovered your Nephew for so I am sure you will hereafter think him and I question not but he will be both an Honour and a Comfort to you under that Appellation'  'I need not Madam said  Allworthy  express my Astonishment at what you have told me and yet surely you would not and could not have put together so many Circumstances to evidence an Untruth I confess I recollect some Passages relating to that  Summer  which formerly gave me a Conceit that my Sister had some Liking to him I mentioned it to her For I had such a Regard to the young Man as well on his own account as on his Father's that I should have willingly consented to a Match between them but she exprest the highest Disdain of my unkind Suspicion as she called it so that I never more spoke on the Subject Good Heaven well the Lord disposeth all ThingsYet sure it was a most unjustifiable Conduct in my Sister to carry this Secret with her out of the World'  'I promise you Sir' said Mrs  Waters  always profest a contrary Intention and frequently told me she intended one Day to communicate  it to you She said indeed she was highly rejoiced that her Plot had succeeded so well and that you had of your own accord taken such a Fancy to the Child that it was yet unnecessary to make any express Declaration Oh Sir had that Lady lived to have seen this poor young Man turned like a Vagabond from your House nay Sir could she have lived to hear that you had yourself employed a Lawyer to prosecute him for a Murder of which he was not guiltyForgive me Mr  Allworthy  I must say it was unkindIndeed you have been abused he never deserved it of you'  'Indeed Madam' said  Alworthy  'I have been abused by the Person whoever he was that told you so'  'Nay Sir' said she 'I would not be mistaken I did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong The Gentleman who came to me proposed no such Matter He only said taking me for Mr  Fitzpatrick'  s Wife that if Mr  Jones  had murdered my Husband I should be assisted with any Money I wanted to carry on the Prosecution by a very worthy Gentleman who he said was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with It was by this Man I found out who Mr  Jones  was and this Man whose Name is  Dowling  Mr  Jones  tells me is your Steward I discovered his Name by a very odd Accident for he himself refused to tell it me but  Partridge  who met him at my Lodgings the second Time he came knew him formerly at  Salisbury  '  'And did this Mr  Dowling'  says  Allworthy  with great Astonishment in his Countenance 'tell you that I would assist in the Prosecution'    'No Sir' answered she 'I will not charge him wrongfully He said I should be assisted but he mentioned no NameYet you must pardon me Sir if from Circumstances I thought it could be no other'    'Indeed Madam' says  Allworthy  'from Circumstances  I am too well convinced it was anotherGood Heaven by what wonderful Means is the blackest and deepest Villany sometimes discoveredShall I beg you Madam to stay till the Person you have mentioned comes for I expect him every Minute nay he may be perhaps already in the House'  Allworthy  then stept to the Door in order to call a Servant when in came not Mr  Dowling  but the Gentleman who will be seen in the next Chapter  CHAP VIII  Further Continuation  THE Gentleman who now arrived was no other than Mr  Western  He no sooner saw  Allworthy  than without considering in the least the Presence of Mrs  Waters  he began to vociferate in the following Manner  'Fine Doings at my House A rare Kettle of Fish I have discovered at last who the Devil would be plagued with a Daughter'  'What's the Matter Neighbour said  Allworthy'  'Matter enough answered  Western  when I thought she was a just coming to nay when she had in a Manner promised me to do as I would ha her and when I was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have a sent for the Lawyer and finished all What do you think I have found out that the little Bhath bin playing Tricks with me all the while and carrying on a Correspondence with that Bastard of yours Sister  Western  whom I have a quarrelled with upon her Account sent me Word o't and I ordered her Pockets to be searched when she was asleep and here I have got un signed with the Son of a Whore's own Name I have not had Patience to read half o't for 'tis longer than one of Parson  Supple'  s Sermons but I find plainly it is all about  Love and indeed what should it be else I have packed her up in Chamber again and Tomorrow Morning down she goes into the Country unless she confents to be married directly and there she shall live in a Garret upon Bread and Water all her Days and the sooner such a Bbreaks her Heart the better though dn her that I believe is too tough She will live long enough to plague me'  'Mr  Western  answered  Allworthy  you know I have always protested against Force and you yourself consented that none should be used'  'Ay cries he that was only upon Condition that she would consent without What the Devil and Doctor  Faustus  shan't I do what I will with my own Daughter especially when I desire nothing but her own Good'  'Well Neighbour answered  Allworthy  if you will give me Leave I will undertake once to argue with the young Lady'  'Will you said  Western  why that is kind now and neighbourly and mayhap you will do more than I have been able to do with her for I promise you she hath a very good Opinion of you'  'Well Sir said  Allworthy  if you will go Home and release the young Lady from her Captivity I will wait upon her within this half Hour'    'But suppose' said  Western  'she should run away with un in the mean Time for Lawyer  Dowling  tells me there is no Hopes of hanging the Fellow at last for that the Man is alive and like to do well and that he thinks  Jones  will be out of Prison again presently'    'How said  Allworthy  'what did you employ him then to enquire or to do any Thing in that Matter'  'Not I answered  Western  'he mentioned it to me just now of his own Accord'    'Just now' cries  Allworthy  'why where did you see him then I want much to see Mr  Dowling''  'Why you may see un an you will presently at my Lodgings  for there is to be a Meeting of Lawyers there this Morning about a MortgageIcod I shall lose two or dree Thousand Pounds I believe by that honest Gentleman Mr  Nightingale'    'Well Sir said  Allworthy  'I will be with you within the half Hour'  'And do for once cries the Squire take a Fool's Advice never think of dealing with her by gentle Methods take my Word for it those will never do I have try'd um long enough She must be frightned into it there is no other Way Tell her I'm her Father and of the horrid Sin of Disobedience and of the dreadful Punishment of it in t'other World and then tell her about being lock'd up all her Life in a Garret in this and be kept only upon Bread and Water'  'I will do all I can said  Allworthy  for I promise you there is nothing I wish more than an Alliance with this amiable Creature'  'Nay the Girl is well enough for Matter o' that cries the Squire a Man may go farther and meet with worse Meat that I may declare o' her thof she be my own Daughter And if she will but be obedient to me there is no'orow a Father within a hundred Miles o' the Place that loves a Daughter better than I do but I see you are busy with the Lady here so I will go Huome and expect you and so your humble Servant'  As soon as Mr  Western  was gone Mrs  Waters  said  'I see Sir the Squire hath not the least Remembrance of my Face I believe Mr  Allworthy  you would not have known me neither I am very considerably altered since that Day when you so kindly gave me that Advice which I had been happy had I followed'    'Indeed Madam cries  Allworthy  'it gave me great Concern when I first heard the contrary'  'Indeed Sir' says she 'I was ruined by a very deep Scheme of Villany which if you knew though I pretend not to think  it would justify me in your Opinion it would at+least mitigate my Offence and induce you to pity me you are not now at Leisure to hear my whole Story but this I assure you I was betrayed by the most solemn Promise of Marriage nay in the Eye of Heaven I was married to him for after much reading on the Subject I am convinced that particular Ceremonies are only requisite to give a legal Sanction to Marriage and have only a worldly Use in giving a Woman the Privileges of a Wife but that she who lives constant to one Man after a solemn private Affiance whatever the World may call her hath little to charge on her own Conscience'  'I am sorry Madam' said  Allworthy  'you made so ill an Use of your Learning Indeed it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more or had remained in a State of Ignorance And yet Madam I am afraid you have more than this Sin to answer for'  'During his Life answered she which was above a Dozen Years I most solemnly assure you I had not And consider Sir on my Behalf what is in the Power of a Woman stript of her Reputation and left destitute whether the goodnatured World will suffer such a stray Sheep to return to the Road of Virtue even if she was never so desirous I protest then I would have chose it had it been in my Power but Necessity drove me into the Arms of Capt  Waters  with whom though still unmarried I lived as a Wife for many Years and went by his Name I parted with this Gentleman at  Worcester  on his March against the Rebels and it was then I accidentally met with Mr  Jones  who rescued me from the Hands of a Villain Indeed he is the worthiest of Men No young Gentleman of his Age is I believe freer from Vice and few have the twentieth Part of his Virtues nay whatever Vices he hath had I am firmly persuaded he hath now taken a Resolution to  abandon them'  'I hope he hath cries  Allworthy  and I hope he will preserve that Resolution I must say I have still the same Hopes with Regard to yourself The World I do agree are apt to be too unmerciful on these Occasions yet Time and Perseverance will get the better of this their Disinclination as I may call it to Pity for though they are not like Heaven ready to receive a penitent Sinner yet a continued Repentance will at length obtain Mercy even with the World This you may be assured of Mrs  Waters  that whenever I find you are sincere in such good Intentions you shall want no Assistance in my Power to make them effectual'  Mrs  Waters  fell now upon her Knees before him and in a Flood of Tears made him many most passionate Acknowledgments of his Goodness which as she truely said savoured more of the divine than human Nature  Allworthy  raised her up and spoke in the most tender Manner making use of every Expression which his Invention could suggest to comfort her when he was interrupted by the Arrival of Mr  Dowling  who upon his first Entrance seeing Mrs  Waters  started and appeared in some Confusion from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could and then said he was in the utmost Haste to attend Council at Mr  Western'  s Lodgings but however thought it his Duty to call and acquaint him with the Opinion of Council upon the Case which he had before told him which was that the Conversion of the Moneys in that Case could not be questioned in a Criminal Cause but that an Action of Trover might be brought and if it appeared to the Jury to be the Moneys of Plaintiff that Plaintiff would recover a Verdict for the Value  Allworthy  without making any Answer to this bolted the Door and then advancing with a stern Look to  Dowling  he said  'Whatever be your  Haste Sir I must first receive an Answer to some Questions Do you know this young Lady'    'That Lady Sir'  answered  Dowling  with great Hesitation  Allworthy  then with the most solemn Voice said  'Look you Mr  Dowling  as you value my Favour or your Continuance a Moment longer in my Service do not hesitate nor prevaricate but answer faithfully and truly to every Question I askDo you know this Lady'    'Yes Sir said  Dowling  I have seen the Lady'  'Where Sir'  'At her own Lodgings'    'Upon what Business did you go thither Sir and who sent you'  'I went Sir to enquire Sir about Mr  Jones'  'And who sent you to enquire about him'  'Who Sir why Sir Mr  Blifil  sent me'  'And what did you say to the Lady concerning that Matter'  'Nay Sir it is impossible to recollect every Word'  'Will you please Madam to assist the Gentleman's Memory'  'He told me Sir said Mrs  Waters  that if Mr  Jones  had murdered my Husband I should be assisted by any Money I wanted to carry on the Prosecution by a very worthy Gentleman who was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with These I can safely swear were the very Words he spoke'    'Were these the Words Sir said  Allworthy'  'I cannot charge my Memory exactly cries  Dowling  but I believe I did speak to that Purpose'    'And did Mr  Blifil  order you to say so'  'I am sure Sir I should not have gone on my own Accord nor have willingly exceeded my Authority in Matters of this Kind If I said so I must have so understood Mr  Blifil'  s Instructions'  'Look you Mr  Dowling  said  Allworthy  I promise you before this Lady that whatever you have done in this Affair by Mr  Blifil'  s Order I will forgive provided you now tell me strictly the Truth for I believe what you  say that you would not have acted of your own Accord and without Authority in this MatterMr  Blifil  then likewise sent you to examine the two Fellows at  Aldersgate'    'He did Sir'    'Well and what Instructions did he then give you Recollect as well as you can and tell me as near as possible the very Words he used'    'Why Sir Mr  Blifil  sent me to find out the Persons who were EyeWitnesses of this Fight He said he feared they might be tampered with by Mr  Jones  or some of his Friends He said Blood required Blood and that not only all who concealed a Murderer but those who omitted any Thing in their Power to bring him to Justice were Sharers in his Guilt He said he found you was very desirous of having the Villain brought to Justice though it was not proper you should appear in it'    'Did he so  says  Allworthy  'Yes Sir cries  Dowling  I should not I am sure have proceeded such Lengths for the sake of any other Person living but your Worship'    'What Lengths Sir  said  Allworthy  'Nay Sir cries  Dowling  I would not have your Worship think I would on any Account be guilty of Subordination of Perjury but there are two Ways of delivering Evidence I told them therefore that if any Offers should be made them on the other Side they should refuse them and that they might be assured they should lose nothing by being honest Men and telling the Truth I said we were told that Mr  Jones  had assaulted the Gentleman first and that if that was the Truth they should declare it and I did give them some Hints that they should be no Losers'    'I think you went Lengths indeed'  cries  Allworthy  'Nay Sir' answered  Dowling  'I am sure I did not desire them to tell an Untruthnor should I have said what I did unless it had been to oblige you'  'You would not have thought I believe says  Allworthy  to have obliged me had you known that this Mr  Jones  was my own Nephew'  'I am sure Sir answered he it did not become me to take any Notice of what I thought you desired to conceal'  'How cries  Allworthy  and did you know it then'    'Nay Sir answered  Dowling  if your Worship bids me speak the Truth I am sure I shall do itIndeed Sir I did know it for they were almost the last Words which Madam  Blifil  ever spoke which she mentioned to me as I stood alone by her Bedside when she delivered me the Letter I brought your Worship from her'    'What Letter cries  Allworthy'  ''The Letter Sir answered  Dowling  which I brought from  Salisbury  and which I delivered into the Hands of Mr  Blifil''  'O Heavens' cries  Allworthy  'well and what were the Words What did my Sister say to you'    'She took me by the Hand answered he and as she delivered me the Letter said I scarce know what I have written Tell my Brother Mr  Jones  is his NephewHe is my SonBless him says she and then fell backward as if dying away I presently called in the People and she never spoke more to me and dy'd within a few Minutes afterwards'  Allworthy  stood a Minute silent lifting up his Eyes and then turning to  Dowling  said  'How came you Sir not to deliver me this Message'  'Your Worship answered he must remember that you was at that Time ill in Bed and being in a violent Hurry as indeed I always am I delivered the Letter and Message to Mr  Blifil  who told me he would carry them both to you which he hath since told me he did and that your Worship partly out of Friendship to Mr  Jones  and partly out of Regard to your Sister would never have it mentioned and did intend to conceal it from the World and therefore Sir if you had not mentioned it to me first I am certain I  should never have thought it belonged to me to say any Thing of the Matter either to your Worship or any other Person'  We have remarked somewhere already that it is possible for a Man to convey a Lie in the Words of Truth this was the Case at present For  Blifil  had in Fact told  Dowling  what he now related but had not imposed upon him nor indeed had imagined that he was able so to do In Reality the Promises which  Blifil  had made to  Dowling  were the Motives which had induced him to Secrecy and as he very plainly saw he should not be able to keep them he thought proper now to make this Confession which the Promises of Forgiveness joined to the Threats the Voice the Looks of  Allworthy  and the Discoveries he had made before extorted from him who was besides taken unawares and had no Time to consider of Evasions  Allworthy  appeared well satisfied with this Relation and having enjoined strict Silence as to what had past on  Dowling  conducted that Gentleman himself to the Door least he should see  Blifil  who was returned to his Chamber where he exulted in the Thoughts of his last Deceit on his Uncle and little suspected what had since passed below Stairs  As  Allworthy  was returning to his Room he met Mrs  Miller  in the Entry who with a Face all pale and full of Terror said to him  'O Sir I find this wicked Woman hath been with you and you know all yet do not on this Account abandon the poor young Man Consider Sir he was ignorant it was his own Mother and the Discovery itself will most probably break his Heart without your Unkindness'  'Madam says  Allworthy  I am under such an Astonishment at what I have heard that I am really unable to satisfy you but come with me into my Room Indeed Mrs  Miller  I have made surprising Discoveries and you shall soon know them'  The poor Woman followed him trembling and now  Allworthy  going up to Mrs  Waters  took her by the Hand and then turning to Mrs  Miller  said  'What Reward shall I bestow upon this poor Gentlewoman for the Services she hath done meO Mrs  Miller  you have a Thousand Times heard me call the young Man to whom you are so faithful a Friend my Son Little did I then think he was indeed related to me at allYour Friend Madam is my Nephew he is the Brother of that wicked Viper which I so long nourished in my BosomShe will herself tell you the whole Story and how the Youth came to pass for her Son Indeed Mrs  Miller  I am convinced that he hath been wronged and that I have been abused abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a Villain He is in Truth the worst of Villains'  The Joy which Mrs  Miller  now felt bereft her of the Power of Speech and might perhaps have deprived her of her Senses if not of Life had not a friendly Shower of Tears come seasonably to her Relief At length recovering so far from her Transport as to be able to speak she cry'd  'And is my dear Mr  Jones  then your Nephew Sir and not the Son of this Lady and are your Eyes opened to him at last and shall I live to see him as happy as he deserves'  'He certainly is my Nephew says  Allworthy  and I hope all the rest'    'And is this the dear good Woman the Person cries she to whom all this Discovery is owing'    'She is indeed says  Allworthy"    'Why then cry'd Mrs  Miller  upon her Knees may Heaven shower down its choicest Blessings upon her Head and for this one good Action forgive her all her Sins be they never so many'  Mrs  Waters  then informed them that she believed  Jones  would very shortly be released for that the  Surgeon was gone in Company with a Nobleman to the Justice who committed him in order to certify that Mr  Fitzpatrick  was out of all Manner of Danger and to procure the Prisoner his Liberty  Allworthy  said he should be glad to find his Nephew there at his Return home but that he was then obliged to go on some Business of Consequence He than called to a Servant to fetch him a Chair and presently left the two Ladies together  Mr  Blifil  hearing the Chair ordered came down Stairs to attend upon his Uncle for he never was deficient in such Acts of Duty He asked his Uncle if he was going out which is a civil Way of asking a Man where he is going to which the other making no Answer he again desired to know when he would be pleased to return  Allworthy  made no Answer to this neither till he was just getting into his Chair and then turning about he said  'Harkee Sir do you find out before my Return the Letter which your Mother sent me on her Deathbed'  Allworthy  then departed and left  Blifil  in a Situation to be envied only by a Man who is just going to be hanged  CHAP IX  A further Continuation  ALlworthy  took an Opportunity whilst he was in the Chair of reading the Letter from  Jones  to  Sophia  which  Western  delivered him and there were some Expressions in it concerning himself which drew Tears from his Eyes At length he arrived at Mr  Western'  s and was introduced to  Sophia  When the first Ceremonies were past and the Gentleman and Lady had taken their Chairs a Silence of some Minutes ensued during which the latter who had been prepared for the Visit by her Father sat playing with her Fan and had every Mark of Confusion both in her Countenance and Behaviour At length  Allworthy  who was himself a little disconcerted began  thus  'I am afraid Miss  Western  my Family hath been the Occasion of giving you some Uneasiness to which I fear I have innocently become more instrumental than I intended Be assured Madam had I at first known how disagreeable the Proposals had been I should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted I hope therefore you will not think the Design of this Visit is to trouble you with any further Sollicitations of that Kind but entirely to relieve you from them'  'Sir said  Sophia  with a little modest Hesitation this Behaviour is most kind and generous and such as I could expect only from Mr  Allworthy  But as you have been so kind to mention this Matter you will pardon me for saying it hath indeed given me great Uneasiness and hath been the Occasion of my suffering much cruel Treatment from a Father who was 'till that unhappy Affair the tenderest and fondest of all Parents I am convinced Sir you are too good and generous to resent my Refusal of your Nephew Our own Inclinations are not in our Power and whatever may be his Merit I cannot force them in his Favour'  'I assure you most amiable young Lady' said  Allworthy  'I am capable of no such Resentment had the Person been my own Son and had I entertained the highest Esteem for him For you say truly Madam we cannot force our own Inclinations much less can they be directed by another'  'Oh Sir' answered  Sophia  'every Word you speak proves you to deserve that good that great that Benevolent Character the whole World allows you I assure you Sir nothing less than the certain Prospect of future Misery could have made me resist the Commands of my Father'  'I sincerely believe you Madam' replied  Allworthy  'and I heartily congratulate you on your prudent Foresight since by so justifiable a  Resistance you have avoided Misery indeed'  'You speak now Mr  Allworthy  cries she 'with a Delicacy which few Men are capable of feeling but surely in my Opinion to lead our Lives with one to whom we are indifferent must be a State of Wretchednessperhaps that Wretchedness would be even increased by a Sense of the Merits of an Object to whom we cannot give our Affections If I had married Mr  Blifil  '  'Pardon my interrupting you Madam answered  Allworthy  'but I cannot bear the SuppositionBelieve me Miss  Western  I rejoice from my Heart I rejoice in your EscapeI have discovered the Wretch for whom you have suffered all this cruel Violence from your Father to be a Villain'  'How Sir' cries  Sophia'  you must believe this surprises me'    'It hath surprised me Madam' answered  Allworthy  and so it will the WorldBut I have acquainted you with the real Truth'  'Nothing but Truth' says  Sophia  'can I am convinced come from the Lips of Mr  Allworthy  Yet Sir such sudden such unexpected NewsDiscovered you saymay Villainy be ever so'    'You will soon enough hear the Story' cries  Allworthy'  at present let us not mention so detested a NameI have another Matter of a very serious Nature to proposeO Miss  Western  I know your vast Worth nor can I so easily part with the Ambition of being allied to itI have a near Relation Madam a young Man whose Character is I am convinced the very opposite to that of this Wretch and whose Fortune I will make equal to what his was to have beenCould I Madam hope you would admit a Visit from him'  Sophia  after a Minute's Silence answered  'I will deal with the utmost Sincerity with Mr  Allworthy  His Character and the Obligation I have just received from  him demand it I have determined at present to listen to no such Proposals from any Person My only desire is to be restor'd to the Affection of my Father and to be again the Mistress of his Family This Sir I hope to owe to your good Offices Let me beseech you let me conjure you by all the Goodness which I and all who know you have experienced do not the very Moment when you have released me from one Persecution do not engage me in another as miserable and as fruitless'  'Indeed Miss  Western'  replied  Allworthy  'I am capable of no such Conduct and if this be your Resolution he must submit to the Disappointment whatever Torments he may suffer under it'  'I must smile now Mr  Allworthy'  answered  Sophia  'when you mention the Torments of a Man whom I do not know and who can consequently have so little Acquaintance with me'  'Pardon me dear young Lady' cries  Allworthy  'I begin now to be afraid he hath had too much Acquaintance for the Repose of his future Days since if ever Man was capable of a sincere violent and noble Passion such I am convinced is my unhappy Nephew's for Miss  Western'  'A Nephew of yours Mr  Allworthy'  answered  Sophia  'It is surely strange I never heard of him before'  'Indeed Madam' cries  Allworthy  'it is only the Circumstance of his being my Nephew to which you are a Stranger and which 'till this Day was a Secret to meMr  Jones  who has long loved you he he is my Nephew'    'Mr  Jones  your Nephew Sir' cries  Sophia  'Can it be possible    'He is indeed Madam answered  Allworthy  He is my own Sister's Sonas such I shall always own him nor am I ashamed of owning him I am much more ashamed of my past Behaviour to him but I was as ignorant of his Merit as of his Birth Indeed Miss  Western  I have used him cruelly  Indeed I have'  Here the good Man wiped his Eyes and after a short Pause proceeded  'I never shall be able to reward him for his Sufferings without your AssistanceBelieve me most amiable young Lady I must have a great Esteem of that Offering which I make to your Worth I know he hath been guilty of Faults but there is great Goodness of Heart at the Bottom Believe me Madam there is'  Here he stopped seeming to expect an Answer which he presently received from  Sophia  after she had a little recovered herself from the Hurry of Spirits into which so strange and sudden Information had thrown her  'I sincerely wish you Joy Sir of a Discovery in which you seem to have such Satisfaction I Doubt not but you will have all the Comfort you can promise yourself from it The young Gentleman hath certainly a thousand good Qualities which makes it impossible he should not behave well to such an Uncle'    'I hope Madam' said  Allworthy  he hath those good Qualities which must make him a good HusbandHe must I am sure be of all Men the most abandoned if a Lady of your Merit should condescend'    'You must pardon me Mr  Allworthy'  answered  Sophia  'I cannot listen to a Proposal of this Kind Mr  Jones  I am convinced hath much Merit but I shall never receive Mr  Jones  as one who is to be my HusbandUpon my Honour I never will'    'Pardon me Madam' cries  Allworthy  'if I am a little surprized after what I have heard from Mr  Western  I hope the unhappy young Man hath done nothing to forfeit your good Opinion if he had ever the Honour to enjoy itPerhaps he may have been misrepresented to you as he was to me The same Villainy may have injured him every whereHe is no Murderer I assure you as he hath  been called'    'Mr  Allworthy  answered  Sophia  I have told you my Resolution I wonder not at what my Father hath told you but whatever his Apprehensions or Fears have been if I know my Heart I have given no Occasion for them since it hath always been a fixed Principle with me never to have marry'd without his Consent This is I think the Duty of a Child to a Parent and this I hope nothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from I do not indeed conceive that the Authority of any Parent can oblige us to marry in direct Opposition to our Inclinations To avoid a Force of this Kind which I had Reason to suspect I left my Father's House and sought Protection elsewhere This is the Truth of my Story and if the World or my Father carry my Intentions any farther my own Conscience will acquit me'  'I hear you Miss  Western'  cries  Allworthy  with Admiration 'I admire the Justness of your Sentiments but surely there is more in this I am cautious of offending you young Lady but am I to look on all which I have hitherto heard or seen as a Dream only And have you suffered so much Cruelty from your Father on the Account of a Man to whom you have been always absolutely indifferent'  'I beg Mr  Allworthy'  answered  Sophia  'you will not insist on my ReasonsYes I have suffered indeed I will not Mr  Allworthy  concealI will be very sincere with youI own I had a great Opinion of Mr  Jones  I believeI know I have suffered for my OpinionI have been treated cruelly by my Aunt as well as by my Father but that is now pastI beg I may not be farther press'd for whatever hath been my Resolution is now fixed Your Nephew Sir hath many Virtueshe hath great Virtues Mr  Allworthy  I question not but he will do you Honour in the World and  make you happy'    'I wish I could make him so Madam' replied  Allworthy  'but that I am convinced is only in your Power It is that Conviction which hath made me so earnest a Sollicitor in his Favour'  'You are deceived indeed Sir you are deceived' said  Sophia'  I hope not by himIt is sufficient to have deceived me Mr  Allworthy  I must insist on being prest no farther upon this SubjectI should be sorryNay I will not injure him in your Favour I wish Mr  Jones  very well I sincerely wish him well and I  peat again to you whatever Demerit he may have to me I am certain he hath many good Qualities I do not disown my former Thoughts but nothing can ever recal them At present there is not a Man on Earth whom I would more resolutely reject than Mr  Jones  nor would the Addresses of Mr  Blifil  himself be less agreeable to me'  Western  had been long impatient for the Event of this Conference and was just now arrived at the Door to listen when having heard the last Sentiments of his Daughter's Heart he lost all Temper and bursting open the Door in a Rage cried out  'It is a Lie It is a dn'd Lie It is all owing to that dn'd Rascal  Juones  and if she could get at un she'd ha un any Hour of the Day'  Here  Allworthy  interposed and addressing himself to the Squire with some Anger in his Look he said  'Mr  Western  you have not kept your Word with me You promised to abstain from all Violence'    'Why so I did' cries  Western  'as long as it was possible but to hear a Wench telling such confounded LiesZounds Doth she think if she can make Vools of other Volk she can make one of meNo no I know her better than thee dost'  'I am sorry to tell you Sir' answered  Allworthy  it doth not appear by your Behaviour to this young  Lady that you know her at all I ask Pardon for what I say but I think our Intimacy your own Desires and the Occasion justify me She is your Daughter Mr  Western  and I think she doth Honour to your Name If I was capable of Envy I should sooner envy you on this Account than any other Man whatever'    'Odrabbitit' cries the Squire 'I wish she was thine with all my Heartwouldst soon be glad to be rid of the Trouble o' her'    'Indeed my good Friend' answered  Allworthy  'you yourself are the Cause of all the Trouble you complain of Place that Confidence in the young Lady which she so well deserves and I am certain you will be the happiest Father on Earth'    'I Confidence in her' cries the Squire  ''Sblood' what Confidence can I place in her when she won't do as I wou'd ha her Let her gi but her Consent to marry as I would ha her and I'll place as much Confidence in her as wouldst ha me'    'You have no Right Neighbour' answered  Allworthy  'to insist on any such Consent A negative Voice your Daughter allows you and God and Nature have thought proper to allow you no more'  'A negative Voice' cries the SquireAy ay I'll shew you what a negative Voice I haGo along go into your Chamber go you Stubborn    'Indeed Mr  Western'  said  Allworthy  'Indeed you use her cruellyI cannot bear to see thisYou shall you must behave to her in a kinder Manner She deserves the best of Treatment'  'Yes yes' said the Squire I know what she deserves Now she's gone I'll shew you what she deservesSee here Sir here is a Letter from my Cousin my Lady  Bellaston  in which she is so kind to gi me to understand that the Fellow is got out of Prison again and here she advises me to take all the Care I can o' the Wench  Odzookers Neighbour  Allworthy  you don't know what it is to govern a Daughter'  The Squire ended his Speech with some Compliments to his own Sagacity and then  Allworthy  after a formal Preface acquainted him with the whole Discovery which he had made concerning  Jones  with his Anger to  Blifil  and with every Particular which hath been disclosed to the Reader in the preceding Chapters  Men overviolent in their Dispositions are for the most Part as changeable in them No sooner then was  Western  informed of Mr  Allworthy'  s Intention to make  Jones  his Heir than he joined heartily with the Uncle in every Commendation of the Nephew and became as eager for her Marriage with  Jones  as he had before been to couple her to  Blifil  Here Mr  Allworthy  was again forced to interpose and to relate what had passed between him and  Sophia  at which he testified great Surprize  The Squire was silent a Moment and looked wild with Astonishment at this AccountAt last he cried out  'Why what can be the Meaning of this Neighbour  Allworthy  Vond o un she was that I'll be sworn toOdzookers I have hit o't As sure as a Gun I have hit o the very right o't It's all long o Zister The Girl hath got a Hankering after this Son of a whore of a Lord I vound 'em together at my Cousin my Lady  Bellaston'  s He hath turned the Head o' her that's certainbut dn me if he shall ha herI'll ha no Lords nor Courtiers in my Vamily'  Allworthy  now made a long Speech in which he repeated his Resolution to avoid all violent Measures and very earnestly recommended gentle Methods to Mr  Western  as those by which he might be assured of succeeding best with his Daughter He then took his Leave and returned back to Mrs  Miller  but  was forced to comply with the earnest Entreaties of the Squire in promising to bring Mr  Jones  to visit him that Afternoon  'that he might' as he said 'make all Matters up with the young Gentleman'  At Mr  Allworthy'  s Departure  Western  promised to follow his Advice in his Behaviour to  Sophia  saying  'I don't know how 'tis but dn me  Allworthy  if you don't make me always do just as you please and yet I have as good an Esteate as you and am in the Commission of the Peace as well as yourself'  CHAP X  Wherein the History begins to draw towards a Conclusion  WHEN  Allworthy  returned to his Lodgings he heard Mr  Jones  was just arrived before him He hurried therefore instantly into an empty Chamber whither he ordered Mr  Jones  to be brought to him alone  It is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving Scene than the Meeting between the Uncle and Nephew for Mrs  Waters  as the Reader may well suppose had at her last Visit discovered to him the Secret of his Birth The first Agonies of Joy which were felt on both Sides are indeed beyond my Power to describe I shall not therefore attempt it After  Allworthy  had raised  Jones  from his Feet where he had prostrated himself and received him into his Arms  'O my Child' he cried 'how have I been to blame How have I injured you What Amends can I ever make you for those unkind those unjust Suspicions which I have entertained and for all the Sufferings they have occasioned to you'  'Am I not made Amends' cries  Jones  'Would not my Sufferings if they had been ten Times  greater have been now richly repaid O my dear Uncle this Goodness this Tenderness overpowers unmans destroys me I cannot bear the Transports which slow so fast upon me To be again restored to your Presence to your Favour to be once more thus kindly received by my great my noble my generous Benefactor    'Indeed Child' cries  Allworthy'  I have used you cruelly'  He then explained to him all the Treachery of  Blifil  and again repeated Expressions of the utmost Concern for having been induced by that Treachery to use him so ill  'O talk not so' answered  Jones'  'Indeed Sir you have used me nobly The wisest Man might be deceived as you were and under such a Deception the best must have acted just as you did Your Goodness displayed itself in the Midst of your Anger just as it then seemed I owe every thing to that Goodness of which I have been most unworthy Do not put me on Selfaccusation by carrying your generous Sentiments too far Alas Sir I have not been punished more than I have deserved and it shall be the whole Business of my furture Life to deserve that Happiness you now bestow on me for believe me my dear Uncle my Punishment hath not been thrown away upon me Though I have been a great I am not a hardened Sinner I thank Heaven I have had Time to reflect on my past Life where though I cannot charge myself with any gross Villainy yet I can discern Follies and Vices too sufficient to repent and to be ashamed of Follies which have been attended with dreadful Consequences to myself and have brought me to the Brink of Destruction'  'I am rejoiced my dear Child' answered  Allworthy  to hear you talk thus sensibly for as I am convinced Hypocrisy good Heaven how have I been imposed on by it in others was never among your Faults  so I can readily believe all you say You now see  Tom  to what Dangers Imprudence alone may subject Virtue for Virtue I am now convinced you love in a great Degree Prudence is indeed the Duty which we owe to ourselves and if we will be so much our own Enemies as to neglect it we are not to wonder if the World is deficient in discharging their Duty to us for when a Man lays the Foundation of his own Ruin others will I am afraid be too apt to build upon it You say however you have seen your Errors and will reform them I firmly believe you my dear Child and therefore from this Moment you shall never more be reminded of them by me Remember them only yourself so far as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them but still remember for your Comfort that there is this great Difference between those Faults which Candour may construe into Imprudence and those which can be deduced from Villainy only The former perhaps are even more liable to subject a Man to Ruin but if he reform his Character will at length be totally retrieved the World though not immediately will in Time be reconciled to him and he may reflect not without some Mixture of Pleasure on the Dangers he hath escaped But Villainy my Boy when once discovered is irretrievable the Stains which this leaves behind no Time will wash away The Censure of Mankind will pursue the Wretch their Scorn will abash him in Public and if Shame drives him into Retirement he will go to it with all those Terrors with which a weary Child who is afraid of Hobgoblins retreats from Company to go to Bed alone Here his murdered Conscience will haunt him Repose like a false Friend will fly from him Whereever he turns his Eyes Horror presents itself if he looks backward unavailable Repentance  treads on his Heels if forward incurable Despair stares him in the Face till like a condemned Prisoner confined in a Dungeon he detests his present Condition and yet dreads the Consequence of that Hour which is to relieve him from it Comfort yourself I say my Child that this is not your Case and rejoice with Thankfulness to him who hath suffered you to see your Errors before they have brought on you that Destruction to which a Persistance in even those Errors must have led you You have deserted them and the Prospect now before you is such that Happiness seems in your own Power'  At these Words  Jones  fetched a deep Sigh upon which when  Allworthy  remonstrated he said  'Sir I will conceal nothing from you I fear there is one Consequence of my Vices I shall never be able to retrieve O my dear Uncle I have lost a Treasure'    'You need say no more' answered  Allworthy  'I will be explicit with you I know what you lament I have seen the young Lady and have discoursed with her concerning you This I must insist on as an Earnest of your Sincerity in all you have said and of the Stedfastness of your Resolution that you obey me in one Instance To abide intirely by the Determination of the young Lady whether it shall be in your Favour or no She hath already suffered enough from Sollicitations which I hate to think of she shall owe no further Constraint to my Family I know her Father will be as ready to torment her now on your Account as he hath formerly been on another but I am determined she shall suffer no more Confinement no more Violence no more uneasy Hours'    'O my dear Uncle' answered  Jones  'lay I beseech you some Command on me in which I shall have some Merit in Obedience Believe me Sir the only Instance in which I could disobey you would be to  give an uneasy Moment to my  Sophia  No Sir if I am so miserable to have incurred her Displeasure beyond all Hope of Forgiveness that alone with the dreadful Reflection of causing her Misery will be sufficient to overpower me To call  Sophia  mine is the greatest and now the only additional Blessing which Heaven can bestow but it is a Blessing which I must owe to her alone'  'I will not flatter you Child' cries  Allworthy  I fear your Case is desperate I never saw stronger Marks of an unalterable Resolution in any Person than appeared in her vehement Declarations against receiving your Addresses for which perhaps you can account better than myself'    'Oh Sir I can account too well' answered  Jones  'I have sinned against her beyond all Hope of Pardon and guilty as I am my Guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten Times blacker than the real Colours O my dear Uncle I find my Follies are irretrievable and all your Goodness cannot save me from Perdition'  A Servant now acquainted them that Mr  Western  was below Stairs for his Eagerness to see  Jones  could not wait till the Afternoon Upon which  Jones  whose Eyes were full of Tears begged his Uncle to entertain  Western  a few Minutes till he a little recovered himself To which the good Man consented and having ordered Mr  Western  to be shewn into a Parlour went down to him  Mrs  Miller  no sooner heard that  Jones  was alone for she had not yet seen him since his Release from Prison than she came eagerly into the Room and advancing towards  Jones  wished him heartily Joy of his newfound Uncle and his happy Reconciliation adding  'I wish I could give you Joy on another Account my dear Child but any thing so inexorable I never saw'  Jones  with some Appearance of Surprize asked her what she meant  'Why then' says she 'I have been with your young Lady and  have explained all Matters to her as they were told me by my Son  Nightingale  She can have no longer any Doubt about the Letter that I am certain for I told her my Son  Nightingale  was ready to take his Oath if she pleased that it was all his own Invention and the Letter of his inditing I told her the very Reason of sending the Letter ought to recommend you to her the more as it was all upon her Account and a plain Proof that you was resolved to quit all your Profligacy for the future that you had never been guilty of a single Instance of Infidelity to her since your seeing her in Town I am afraid I went too far there but Heaven forgive me I hope your future Behaviour will be my Justification I am sure I have said all I can but all to no Purpose She remains inflexible She says she had forgiven many Faults on account of Youth but expressed such Detestation of the Character of a Libertine that she absolutely silenced me I often attempted to excuse you but the Justness of her Accusation flew in my Face Upon my Honour she is a lovely Woman and one of the sweetest and most sensible Creatures I ever saw I could have almost kissed her for one Expression she made use of It was a Sentiment worthy of  Seneca  or of a Bishop' "I once fancied Madam' said she "I had discovered great Goodness of Heart in Mr  Jones  and for that I own I had a sincere Esteem but an entire Profligacy of Manners will corrupt the best Heart in the World and all which a goodnatured Libertine can expect is that we should mix some Grains of Pity with our Contempt and Abhorrence"  'She is an angelic Creature that is the Truth on't'    'O Mrs  Miller  answered  Jones  can I bear to think I have lost such an Angel    'Lost No' cries Mrs  Miller'  'I hope you have not lost her yet Resolve to leave such vicious Courses and you may yet have  Hopes Nay if she should remain inexorable there is another young Lady a sweet pretty young Lady and a swinging Fortune who is absolutely dying for Love of you I heard of it this very Morning and I told it to Miss  Western  nay I went a little beyond the Truth again for I told her you had refused her but indeed I knew you would refuse herAnd here I must give you a little Comfort When I mentioned the young Lady's Name who is no other than the pretty Widow  Hunt  I thought she turned pale but when I said you had refused her I will be sworn her Face was all over Scarlet in an Instant and these were her very Words' "I will not deny but that I believe he has some Affection for me'  Here the Conversation was interrupted by the Arrival of  Western  who could no longer be kept out of the Room even by the Authority of  Allworthy  himself though this as we have often seen had a wonderful Power over him  Western  immediately went up to  Jones  crying out  'My old Friend  Tom  I am glad to see thee with all my Heart All past must be forgotten I could not intend any Affront to thee because as  Allworthy  here knows nay dost know it thyself I took thee for another Person and where a Body means no Harm what signifies a hasty Word or two one Christian must forget and forgive another'  'I hope Sir said  Jones  'I shall never forget the many Obligations I have had to you but as for any Offence towards me I declare I am an utter Stranger'    'A't' says  Western'  then give me thy Fist a't as hearty an honest Cock as any in the Kingdom Come along with me I'll carry thee to thy Mistress this Moment'  Here  Allworthy  interposed and the Squire being unable to prevail either with the Uncle or Nephew was after some Litigation obliged to consent to delay introducing  Jones  to  Sophia  till  the Afternoon at which Time  Allworthy  as well in Compassion to  Jones  as in Compliance with the eager Desires of  Western  was prevailed upon to promise to attend at the Teatable  The Conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough and with which had it happened earlier in our History we would have entertained our Reader but as we have now Leisure only to attend to what is very material it shall suffice to say that Matters being intirely adjusted as to the AfternoonVisit Mr  Western  again returned home  CHAP XI  This History draws nearer to a Conclusion  WHEN Mr  Western  was departed  Jones  began to inform Mr  Allworthy  and Mrs  Miller  that his Liberty had been procured by two noble Lords who together with two Surgeons and a Friend of Mr  Nightingale'  s had attended the Magistrate by whom he had been committed and by whom on the Surgeons Oaths that the wounded Person was out of all Manner of Danger from this Wound he was discharged  One only of these Lords he said he had ever seen before and that no more than once but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his Pardon for an Offence he had been guilty of towards him occasioned he said entirely by his Ignorance who he was  Now the Reality of the Case with which  Jones  was not acquainted till afterwards was this The Lieutenant whom Lord  Fellamar  had employed according to the Advice of Lady  Bellaston  to press  Jones  as a Vagabond into the Sea Service when he came to report the Event which we have before seen to his Lordship spoke very favourably of the Behaviour of Mr  Jones  on all Accounts and strongly assured  that Lord that he must have mistaken the Person for that  Jones  was certainly a Gentleman insomuch that his Lordship who was strictly a Man of Honour and would by no Means have been guilty of an Action which the World in general would have condemned began to be much concerned for the Advice which he had taken  Within a Day or two after this Lord  Fellamar  happened to dine with the  Irish  Peer who in a Conversation upon the Duel acquainted his Company with the Character of  Fitzpatrick  to which indeed he did not do strict Justice especially in what related to his Lady He said she was the most innocent and most injured Woman alive and that from Compassion alone he had undertaken her Cause He then declared an Intention of going the next Morning to  Fitzpatrick'  s Lodgings in order to prevail with him if possibly to consent to a Separation from his Wife who the Peer said was in Apprehensions for her Life if she should ever return to be under the Power of her Husband Lord  Fellamar  agreed to go with him that he might satisfy himself more concerning  Jones  and the Circumstances of the Duel for he was by no Means easy concerning the Part he had acted The Moment his Lordship gave a Hint of his Readiness to assist in the Delivery of the Lady it was eagerly embraced by the other Nobleman who depended much on the Authority of Lord  Fellamar  as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe  Fitzpatrick  into a Compliance and perhaps he was in the right for the poor  Irishman  no sooner saw these noble Peers had undertaken the Cause of his Wife than he submitted and Articles of Separation were soon drawn up and signed between the Parties  Fitzpatrick  had been so well satisfied by Mrs  Waters  concerning the Innocence of his Wife with  Jones  at  Upton  or perhaps from some other Reasons was now become so indifferent to that Matter that he  spoke highly in Favour of  Jones  to Lord  Fellamar  took all the Blame upon himself and said the other had behaved very much like a Gentleman and a Man of Honour and upon that Lord's further Enquiry concerning Mr  Jones Fitzpatrick  told him he was Nephew to a Gentleman of very great Fashion and Fortune which was the Account he had just received from Mrs  Waters  after her Interview with  Dowling  Lord  Fellamar  now thought it behoved him to do every Thing in his Power to make Satisfaction to a Gentleman whom he had so grosly injured and without any Consideration of Rivalship for he had now given over all Thoughts of  Sophia  determined to procure Mr  Jones'  s Liberty being satisfied as well from  Fitzpatrick  as his Surgeon that the Wound was not mortal He therefore prevailed with the  Irish  Peer to accompany him to the Place where  Jones  was confined to whom he behaved as we have already related  When  Allworthy  returned to his Lodgings he immediately carried  Jones  into his Room and then acquainted him with the whole Matter as well what he had heard from Mrs  Waters  as what he had discovered from Mr  Dowling  Jones  expressed great Astonishment and no less Concern at this Account but without making any Comment or Observation upon it And now a Message was brought from Mr  Blifil  desiring to know if his Uncle was at Leisure and he might wait upon him  Alworthy  started and turned pale and then in a more passionate Tone than I believe he had ever used before bid the Servant tell  Blifil  he knew him not  'Consider dear Sir'  cries  Jones  in a trembling Voice  'I have considered answered  Allworthy  and you yourself shall carry my Message to the VillainNo one can carry him the Sentence  of his own Ruin so properly as the Man whose Ruin he hath so villainously contrived'    'Pardon me dear Sir said  Jones  a Moment's Reflection will I am sure convince you of the contrary What might be perhaps but Justice from another Tongue would from mine be Insult and to whomMy own Brother and your NephewNor did he use me so barbarouslyIndeed that would have been more inexcuseable than any Thing he hath done Fortune may tempt Men of no very bad Dispositions to Injustice but Insults proceed only from black and rancorous Minds and have no Temptations to excuse themLet me beseech you Sir to do nothing by him in the present Height of your Anger Consider my dear Uncle I was not myself condemned unheard'  Allworthy  stood silent a Moment and then embracing  Jones  he said with Tears gushing from his Eyes  'O my Child to what Goodness have I been so long blind'  Mrs  Miller  entring the Room at that Moment after a gentle Rap which was not perceived and seeing  Jones  in the Arms of his Uncle the poor Woman in an Agony of Joy fell upon her Knees and burst forth into the most extatic Thanksgivings to Heaven for what had happened Then runing to  Jones  she embraced him eagerly crying  'My dearest Friend I wish you Joy a Thousand and a Thousand Times of this blest Day'  and next Mr  Allworthy  himself received the same Congratulations To which he answered  'Indeed indeed Mrs  Miller  I am beyond Expression happy'  Some few more Raptures being passed on all Sides Mrs  Miller  desired them both to walk down to Dinner in the Parlour where she said there were a very happy Set of People assembled being indeed no other than Mr  Nightingale  and his Bride and his Cousin  Harris  with her Bridegroom  Allworthy  excused himself from dining with the Company saying he had ordered some little Thing for him and his Nephew in his own Apartment for that they had much private Business to discourse of but would not resist promising the good Woman that both he and  Jones  would make Part of her Society at Supper  Mrs  Miller  then asked what was to be done with  Blifil  'for indeed says she I cannot be easy while such a Villain is in my House    Allworthy  answered  'He was as uneasy as herself on the same Account'  'O cries she if that be the Case leave the Matter to me I'll soon shew him the Outside of my Doors I warrant you Here are two or three lusty Fellows below Stairs'  'There will be no need of any Violence cries  Allworthy  if you will carry him a Message from me he will I am convinced depart of his own Accord'  'Will I said Mrs  Miller  I never did any Thing in my Life with a better Will'  Here  Jones  interfered and said  'He had considered the Matter better and would if Mr  Allworthy  pleased be himself the Messenger'  'I know says he already enough of your Pleasure Sir and I beg Leave to acquaint him with it by my own Words Let me beseech you Sir added he to reflect on the dreadful Consequences of driving him to violent and sudden Despair How unfit alas is this poor Man to die in his present Situation'  This Suggestion had not the least Effect on Mrs  Miller  She left the Room crying  'You are too good Mr  Jones  infinitely too good to live in this World'  But it made a deeper Impression on  Allworthy  'My good Child said he I am equally astonished at the Goodness of your Heart and the Quickness of your Understanding Heaven indeed forbid that this Wretch should be deprived of any Means or Time for Repentance  That would be a shocking Consideration indeed Go to him therefore and use your own Discretion yet do not flatter him with any Hopes of my Forgiveness for I shall never forgive Villainy farther than my Religion obliges me and that extends not either to our Bounty or our Conversation'  Jones  went up to  Blifil'  s Room whom he found in a Situation which moved his Pity though it would have raised a less amiable Passion in many Beholders He had cast himself on his Bed where he lay abandoning himself to Despair and drowned in Tears not in such Tears as flow from Contrition and wash away Guilt from Minds which have been seduced or surprized into it unawares against the Bent of their natural Dispositions as will sometimes happen from human Frailty even to the Good No these Tears were such as the frighted Thief sheds in his Cart and are indeed the Effects of that Concern which the most savage Natures are seldom deficient in feeling for themselves  It would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this Scene in full Length Let it suffice to say that the Behaviour of  Jones  was kind to Excess He omitted nothing which his Invention could supply to raise and comfort the drooping Spirits of  Blifil  before he communicated to him the Resolution of his Uncle that he must quit the House that Evening He offered to furnish him with any Money he wanted assured him of his hearty Forgiveness of all he had done against him that he would endeavour to live with him hereafter as a Brother and would leave nothing unattempted to effectuate a Reconciliation with his Uncle  Blifil  was at first sullen and silent balancing in his Mind whether he should yet deny all But finding at last the Evidence too strong against him he betook himself at last to confession He then asked Pardon of his Brother in the most vehement Manner prostrated  himself on the Ground and kissed his Feet In short he was now as remarkably mean as he had been before remarkably wicked  Jones  could not so far check his Disdain but that it a little discovered itself in his Countenance at this extreme Servility He raised his Brother the Moment he could from the Ground and advised him to bear his Afflictions more like a Man repeating at the same Time his Promises that he would do all in his Power to lessen them For which  Blifil  making many Professions of his Unworthiness poured forth a Profusion of Thanks And then he having declared he would immediately depart to another Lodging  Jones  returned to his Uncle  Among other Matters  Allworthy  now acquainted  Jones  with the Discovery which he made concerning the  l  BankNotes  '▪I have' said he 'already consulted a Lawyer who tells me to my great Astonishment that there is no Punishment for a Fraud of this Kind Indeed when I consider the black Ingratitude of this Fellow toward you I think a Highwayman compared to him is an innocent Person'  'Good Heaven' says  Jones  'is it possibleI am shocked beyond Measure at this News I thought there was not an honester Fellow in the WorldThe Temptation of such a Sum was too great for him to withstand for smaller Matters have come safe to me through his Hand Indeed my dear Uncle you must suffer me to call it Weakness rather than Ingratitude for I am convinced the poor Fellow loves me and hath done me some Kindness which I can never forget nay I believe he hath repented of this very Act For it is not above a Day or two ago when my Affairs seemed in the most desperate Situation that he visited me in my Confinement and offered me any Money I wanted  Consider Sir what a Temptation to a Man who had tasted such bitter Distress it must be to have a Sum in his Possession which must put him and his Family beyond any future Possibility of suffering the like'  'Child' cries  Allworthy  'you carry this forgiving Temper too far Such mistaken Mercy is not only weakness but borders on Injustice and is very pernicious to Society as it encourages Vice The Dishonesty of this Fellow I might perhaps have pardoned but never his Ingratitude And give me Leave to say when we suffer any Temptation to atone for Dishonesty itself we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be and so far I confess I have gone for I have often pitied the Fate of a Highwayman when I have been on the Grand Jury and have more than once applied to the Judge on the Behalf of such as have had any mitigating Circumstances in their Case but when Dishonesty is attended with any blacker Crime such as Cruelty Murder Ingratitude or the like Compassion and Forgiveness then become Faults I am convinced the Fellow is a Villain and he shall be punished at least as far as I can punish him'  This was spoke with so stern a Voice that  Jones  did not think proper to make any Reply Besides the Hour appointed by Mr  Western  now drew so near that he had barely Time left do dress himself Here therefore ended the present Dialogue and  Jones  retired to another Room where  Partridge  attended according to order with his Cloaths  Partridge  had scarce seen his Master since the happy Discovery The poor Fellow was unable either to contain or express his Transports He behaved like one frantic and made almost as many Mistakes while he was dressing  Jones  as I have seen made by Harlequin in dressing himself on the Stage  His Memory however was not in the least deficient He recollected now many Omens and Presages of this happy Event some of which he had remarked at the Time but many more he now remembered nor did he omit the Dreams he had dreamt the Evening before his meeting with  Jones  and concluded with saying  'I always told your Honour something boded in my Mind that you would one Time or other have it in your Power to make my Fortune'  Jones  assured him that this Boding should as certainly be verified with regard to him as all the other Omens had been to himself which did not a little add to all the Raptures which the poor Fellow had already conceived on account of his Master  CHAP XII  Approaching still nearer to the End  JONES  being now completely dressed attended his Uncle to Mr  Western'  s He was indeed one of the finest Figures ever beheld and his Person alone would have charmed the greater Part of Womankind but we hope it hath already appeared in this History that Nature when she formed him did not totally rely as she sometimes doth on this Merit only to recommend her Work  Sophia  who angry as she was was likewise set forth to the best Advantage for which I leave my female Reader to account appeared so extremely beautiful that even  Allworthy  when he saw her could not forbear whispering  Western  that he believed she was the finest Creature in the World To which  Western  answered in a Whisper overheard by all present  'So much the better for  Tom  for dn me if he shan't ha the tousling her'  Sophia  was all over Scarlet at these Words while  Tom'  s Countenance was altogether as pale and he was almost ready to sink from his Chair  The Teatable was scarce removed before  Western  lugged  Allworthy  out of the Room telling him  'He had Business of Consequence to impart and must speak to him that Instant in private before he forgot it'  The Lovers were now alone and it will I question not appear strange to many Readers that those who had so much to say to one another when Danger and Difficulty attended their Conversation and who seemed so eager to rush into each others Arms when so many Bars lay in their Way now that with Safety they were at Liberty to say or do whatever they pleased should both remain for some Time silent and motionless insomuch that a Stranger of moderate Sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent But so it was however strange it may seem both sat with their Eyes cast downwards on the Ground and for some Minutes continued in perfect Silence  Mr  Jones  during this Interval attempted once or twice to speak but was absolutely incapable muttering only or rather sighing out some broken Words when  Sophia  at length partly out of Pity to him and partly to turn the Discourse from the Subject which she knew well enough he was endeavouring to open said  'Sure Sir you are the most fortunate Man in the World in this Discovery'  ' 'And can you realy Madam think me so fortunate' said  Jones  sighing 'while I have incurred your Displeasure    'Nay Sir' says she 'as to that you best know whether you have deserved it'  'Indeed Madam' answered he 'you yourself are as well apprized of all my Demerits Mrs  Miller  has acquainted you with the whole Truth O my  Sophia  am I never to hope for Forgiveness'    'I think Mr  Jones'  said she 'I may almost depend upon your  own Justice and leave it to yourself to pass Sentence on your own Conduct'    'Alas Madam' answered he 'it is Mercy and not Justice which I implore at your Hands Justice I know must condemn meYet not for the Letter I sent to Lady  Bellaston  Of that I most solemnly declare you have had a true Account'  He then insisted much on the Security given him by  Nightingale  of a fair Pretence for breaking off if contrary to their Expectations her Ladyship should have accepted his Offer but confest that he had been guilty of a great Indiscretion to put such a Letter as that into her Power which said he  'I have dearly paid for in the Effect it has upon you'  'I do not I cannot' says she 'believe otherwise of that Letter than you would have me My Conduct I think shews you clearly I do not believe there is much in that And yet Mr  Jones  have I not enough to resent After what past at  Upton  so soon to engage in a new Amour with another Woman while I fancied and you pretended your Heart was bleeding for meIndeed you have acted strangely Can I believe the Passion you have profest to me to be sincere Or if I can what Happiness can I assure myself of with a Man capable of so much Inconstancy'  'O my  Sophia  cries he 'do not doubt the Sincerity of the purest Passion that ever inflamed a human Breast Think most adorable Creature of my unhappy Situation of my DespairCould I my  Sophia  have flatter'd myself with the most distant Hopes of being ever permitted to throw myself at your Feet in the Manner I do now it would not have been in the Power of any other Woman to have inspired a Thought which the severest Chastity could have condemned Inconstancy to you O  Sophia  if you can have Goodness enough to pardon what is past do not let any  cruel future Apprehensions shut your Mercy against meNo Repentance was ever more sincere O let it reconcile me to my Heaven in this dear Bosom'  'Sincere Repentance Mr  Jones'  answered she 'will obtain the Pardon of a Sinner but it is from one who is a perfect Judge of that Sincerity A human Mind may be imposed on nor is there any infallible Method to prevent it You must expect however that if I can be prevailed on by your Repentance to pardon you I will at least insist on the strongest Proof of its Sincerity'    'O name any Proof in my Power'  answered  Jones  eagerly  'Time' replied she 'Time Mr  Jones  can alone convince me that you are a true Penitent and have resolved to abandon these vicious Courses which I should detest you if I imagined you capable of persevering in'  'Do not imagine it' cries  Jones  'On my Knees I intreat I implore your Confidence a Confidence which it shall be the Business of my Life to deserve'  'Let it then' said she 'be the Business of some Part of your Life to shew me you deserve it I think I have been explicit enough in assuring you that when I see you merit my Confidence you will obtain it After what is past Sir can you expect I should take you upon your Word'  He replied  'Don't believe me upon my Word I have a better Security a Pledge for my Constancy which it is impossible to see and to doubt'  'What is that'  said  Sophia  a little surprised  'I will show you my charming Angel  cried  Jones  seizher Hand and carrying her to the Glass  'There behold it there in that lovely Figure in that Face that Shape those Eyes that Mind which shines through those Eyes Can the Man who shall be in Possession of these be inconstant Impossible my  Sophia  They would six a  Dorimant  a Lord  Rochester  You could not doubt it if you could  see yourself with any Eyes but your own'  Sophia  blushed and half smiled but forcing again her Brow into a Frown  'If I am to judge' said she 'of the future by the past my Image will no more remain in your Heart when I am out of your Sight than it will in this Glass when I am out of the Room'  'By Heaven by all that's sacred' said  Jones  'it never was out of my Heart The Delicacy of your Sex cannot conceive the Grossness of ours nor how little one Sort of Amour has to do with the Heart'  'I will never marry a Man' replied  Sophia  very gravely 'who shall not learn Refinement enough to be as incapable as I am myself of making such a Distinction'  'I will learn it' said  Jones  'I have learnt it already The first Moment of Hope that my  Sophia  might be my Wife taught it me at once and all the rest of her Sex from that Moment became as little the Objects of Desire to my Sense as of Passion to my Heart'  'Well' said  Sophia  the Proof of this must be from Time Your Situation Mr  Jones  is now altered and I assure you I have great Satisfaction in the Alteration You will now want no Opportunity of being near me and convincing me▪ that your Mind is altered too'  'O my Angel' cries  Jones  'how shall I thank thy Goodness And are you so good to own that you have a Satisfaction in my ProsperityBelieve me believe me Madam it is you alone have given me a relish to that Prosperity since I owe to it the dear HopeO my  Sophia  let it not be a distant oneI will be all Obedience to your Commands I will not dare to press any farther than you permit me Yet let me intreat you to appoint a short Trial O tell me when I may expect you will be convinced of what is most solemnly true'  'When I have gone voluntarily thus far Mr  Jones  said she 'I expect not to be  pressed Nay I will not'    'O don't look unkindly thus my  Sophia'  cries he 'I do not I dare not press youYet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the Period O consider the Impatience of Love''  'A Twelvemonth perhaps'  said she  'O my  Sophia'  cries he 'you have named an Eternity'    'Perhaps it may be something sooner' says she 'I will not be teazed If your Passion for me be what I would have it I think you may now be easy'    'Easy  Sophia  call not such exulting Happiness as mine by so cold a NameO transporting Thought am I not assured that the blessed Day will come when I shall call you mine when Fears shall be no more when I shall have that dear that vast that exquisite extatic Delight of making my  Sophia  happy'    'Indeed Sir' said she 'that Day is in your own Power'    'O my dear my divine Angel' cried he 'these Words have made me mad with JoyBut I must I will thank those dear Lips which have so sweetly pronounced my Bliss'  He then caught her in his Arms and kissed her with an Ardour he had never ventured before  At this Instant  Western  who had stood some Time listening burst into the Room and with his hunting Voice and Phrase cry'd out  'To her Boy to her go to herThat's it little Honeys O that's it Well what is it all over Hath she appointed the Day Boy What shall it be tomorrow or next Day It shan't be put off a Minute longer than the next Day I am resolved'  'Let me beseech you Sir' says  Jones  'don't let me be the Occasion'    'Beseech mine A' cries  Western  'I thought thou had'st been a Lad of higher Mettle than to give way to a Parcel of maidenish TricksI tell thee 'tis all Flimflam Zoodikers  she'd have the Wedding toNight with all her Heart Would'st not  Sophy  Come confess and be an honest Girl for once What art dumb Why dost not speak'  'Why should I confess Sir says  Sophia  'since it seems you are so well acquainted with my Thoughts'    'That's a good Girl' cries he 'and do'st consent then'  'No indeed Sir' says  Sophia  'I have given no such Consent'    'And wunt nut ha un then toMorrow nor next Day'  says  Western  'Indeed Sir' says she 'I have no such Intention'  'But I can tell thee' replied he 'why hast nut only because thou dost love to be disobedient and to plague and vex thy Father'    'Pray Sir'  said  Jones  interfering  'I tell thee thou at a Puppy' cries he 'When I forbid her then it was all nothing but sighing and whining and languishing and writing now I am vor thee she is against thee All the Spirit of contrary that's all She is above being guided and governed by her Father that's the whole Truth on't It is only to disoblige and contradict me'  'What would my Papa have me do'  cries  Sophia  'What would I have thee do' says he 'why gi un thy Hand this Moment'    'Well Sir' said  Sophia  'I will obey youThere is my Hand Mr  Jones'  'Well and will you consent to ha un tomorrow Morning'  says  Western  'I will be obedient to you Sir' cries she'Why then tomorrow Morning be the Day' cries heWhy then tomorrow Morning shall be the Day Papa since you will have it so'  says  Sophia Jones  then fell upon his Knees and kissed her Hand in an Agony of Joy while  Western  began to caper and dance about the Room presently crying out  'Where the Devil is  Allworthy  He is without now atalking with that dd Lawyer  Dowling  when he should be minding other Matters'  He then  sallied out in quest of him and very opportunely left the Lovers to enjoy a few tender Minutes alone  But he soon returned with  Allworthy  saying  'If you won't believe me you may ask her yourself Hast nut gin thy consent  Sophy  to be married tomorrow'  'Such are your Commands Sir' cries  Sophia  'and I dare not be guilty of Disobedience'  'I hope Madam cries  Allworthy  my Nephew will merit so much Goondess and will be always as sensible as myself of the great Honour you have done my Family An Alliance with so charming and so excellent a young Lady would indeed be an Honour to the greatest in  England  '  'Yes' cries  Western  'but if I had suffered her to stand shill I shall I dilly dally you might not have had that Honour yet awhile I was forced to use a little fatherly Authority to bring her to'  'I hope not Sir' cries  Allworthy  'I hope there is not the least Constraint'  'Why there' cries  Western  you may bid her unsay all again if you will Do'st repent heartily of thy Promise do'st not  Sophy'  Indeed Papa' cries she 'I do not repent nor do I believe I ever shall of any Promise in favour of Mr  Jones'  'Then Nephew' cries  Allworthy  'I felicitate you most heartily for I think you are the happiest of Men And Madam you will give me leave to congratulate you on this joyful Occasion indeed I am convinced you have bestowed yourself on one who will be sensible of your great Merit and who will at least use his best Endeavours to deserve it'  'His best Endeavours' cries  Western  that he will I warrant un'    'Harkee  Allworthy  'I'll bet thee five Pound to a Crown we have a Boy tomorrow nine Months but prithee tell me what wut ha wut ha Burgundy Champaigne or what for please  Jupiter  we'll make a Night on't'  'Indeed Sir' said  Allworthy  'you must excuse me  both my Nephew and I were engaged before I suspected this near Approach of his Happiness'  'Engaged' quoth the Squire 'never tell meI won't part with thee tonight upon any Occasion Shalt sup here please the Lord  Harry'  'You must pardon me my dear Neighbour' answered  Allworthy  'I have given a solemn Promise and that you know I never break'  'Why prithee who art engaged to'  cries the Squire  Allworthy  then informed him as likewise of the Company'Odzookers' answered the Squire  'I will go with thee and so shall  Sophy  for I won't part with thee tonight and it would be barbarous to part  Tom  and the Girl'  This Offer was presently embraced by  Allworthy  and  Sophia  consented having first obtained a private Promise from her Father that he would not mention a Syllable concerning her marriage  CHAP  The last In which the History is concluded  YOUNG  Nightingale  had been that Afternoon by Appointment to wait on his Father who received him much more kindly than he expected There likewise he met his Uncle who was returned to Town in quest of his new married Daughter  This Marriage was the luckiest Incident which could have happened to the young Gentleman for these Brothers lived in a constant Contention about the Goverment of their Children both heartily despising the Method which each other took Each of them therefore now endeavoured as much as he could to palliate the Offence which his own Child had committed and to aggravate the Match of the other This Desire of triumphing over his Brother added to the many Arguments which  Allworthy  had used so strongly operated on the old Gentleman that he met his Son with a smiling Countenance and actually  agreed to sup with him that Evening at Mrs  Miller'  s  As for the other who really loved his Daughter with the most immoderate Affection there was little Difficulty in inclining him to a Reconciliation He was no sooner informed by his Nephew where his Daughter and her Husband were than he declared he would instantly go to her And when he arrived there he scarce suffered her to fall upon her Knees before he took her up and embraced her with a Tenderness which affected all who saw him and in less than a Quarter of an Hour was as well reconciled to both her and her Husband as if he had himself joined their Hands  In this Situation were Affairs when Mr  Allworthy  and his Company arrived to complete the Happiness of Mrs  Miller  who no sooner saw  Sophia  than she guessed every Thing that had happened and so great was her Friendship to  Jones  that it added not a few Transports to those she felt on the Happiness of her own Daughter  There have not I believe been many Instances of a number of People met together where every one was so perfectly happy as in this Company Amongst whom the Father of young  Nightingale  enjoyed the least perfect Content for notwithstanding his Affection for his Son notwithstanding the Authority and the Arguments of  Allworthy  together with the other Motive mentiond before he could not so entirely be satisfied with his Son's Choice and perhaps the Presence of  Sophia  herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his Concern as a Thought now and then suggested itself that his Son might have had that Lady or some such other Not that any of the Charms which adorned either the Person or Mind of  Sophia  created the Uneasiness It was the Contents of her Father's Coffers which set his Heart a longing  These were the Charms which he could not bear to think his Son had sacrificed to the Daughter of Mrs  Miller  The Brides were both very pretty Women but so totally were they eclipsed by the Beauty of  Sophia  that had they not been two of the besttempered Girls in the World it would have raised some Envy in their Breasts for neither of their Husbands could long keep his Eyes from  Sophia  who sat at the Table like a Queen receiving Homage or rather like a superior Being receiving Adoration from all around her But it was an Adoration which they gave not which she exacted For she was as much distinguished by her Modesty and Affability as by all her other Perfections  The Evening was spent in much true Mirth All were happy but those the most who had been most unhappy before Their former Sufferings and Fears gave such a Relish to their Felicity as even Love and Fortune in their fullest Flow could not have given without the Advantage of such a Comparison Yet as great Joy especially after a sudden Change and Revolution of Circumstances is apt to be silent and dwells rather in the Heart than on the Tongue  Jones  and  Sophia  appeared the least merry of the whole Company Which  Western  observed with great Impatience often crying out to them  'Why do'st not talk Boy Why do'st look so grave Hast lost thy Tongue Girl Drink another Glass of Wine sha't drink another Glass  And the more to enliven her he would sometimes sing a merry Song which bore some Relation to Matrimony and the Loss of a Maidenhead Nay he would have proceeded so far on that Topic as to have driven her out of the Room if Mr  Allworthy  had not checkt him sometimes by Looks and once or twice by a  Fie Mr Western  He began indeed once to debate the Matter and assert his Right to talk to his own Daughter as he thought  fit but as no Body seconded him he was soon reduced to Order  Notwithstanding this little Restraint he was so pleased with the Chearfulness and GoodHumour of the Company that he insisted on their meeting the next Day at his Lodgings They all did so and the lovely  Sophia  who was now in private become a Bride too officiated as the Mistress of the Ceremonies or in the polite Phrase did the Honours of the Table She had that Morning given her Hand to  Jones  in the Chapel at  DoctorsCommons  where Mr  Allworthy  Mr  Western  and Mrs  Miller  were the only Persons present  Sophia  had earnestly desired her Father that no others of the Company who were that Day to dine with him should be acquainted with her Marriage The same Secrecy was enjoined to Mrs  Miller  and  Jones  undertook for  Allworthy  This some what reconciled the Delicacy of  Sophia  to the public Entertainment which in Compliance with her Father's Will she was obliged to go to greatly against her own Inclinations In Confidence of this Secrecy she went through the Day pretty well till the Squire who was now advanced into the second Bottle could contain his Joy no longer but filling out a Bumper drank a Health to the Bride The Health was immediately pledged by all present to the great Confusion of poor blushing  Sophia  and the great Concern of  Jones  upon her Account To say Truth there was not a Person present made wiser by this Discovery for Mrs  Miller  had whispered it to her Daughter her Daughter to her Husband her Husband to his Sister and she to all the rest  Sophia  now took the first Opportunity of withdraing with the Ladies and the Squire sat in to his Cups in which he was by Degrees deserted by all the Company except the Uncle of young  Nightingale  who loved his Bottle as well as  Western  himself  These two therefore sat stoutly to it during the whole Evening and long after that happy Hour which had surrendered the charming  Sophia  to the eager Arms of her enraptured  Jones  Thus Reader we have at length brought our History to a Conclusion in which to our great Pleasure tho' contrary perhaps to thy Expectation Mr  Jones  appears to be the happiest of all human Kind For what Happiness this World affords equal to the Possession of such a Woman as  Sophia  I sincerely own I have never yet discovered  As to the other Persons who have made any considerable Figure in this History as some may desire to know a little more concerning them we will proceed in as few Words as possible to satisfy their Curiosity  Allworthy  hath never yet been prevailed upon to see  Blifil  but he hath yielded to the Importunity of  Jones  backed by  Sophia  to settle  l  a Year upon him to which  Jones  hath privately added a third Upon this Income he lives in one of the northern Counties about Miles distant from  London  and lays up  l  a Year out of it in order to purchase a Seat in the next Parliament from a neighbouring Borough which he has bargained for with an Attorney there He is also lately turned Methodist in hopes of marrying a very rich Widow of that Sect whose Estate lies in that Part of the Kingdom  Square  died soon after he writ the before mentioned Letter and as to  Thwackum  he continues at his Vicarage He hath made many fruitless Attempts to regain the Confidence of  Allworthy  or to ingratiate himself with  Jones  both of whom he flatters to their Faces and abuses behind their Backs But in his stead Mr  Allworthy  hath lately taken Mr  Abraham Adams  into his House of whom  Sophia  is grown immoderately fond and declares he shall have the Tuition of her Children  Mrs  Fitzpatrick  is separated from her Husband and retains the little Remains of her Fortune She lives in Reputation at the polite End of the Town and is so good an Oeconomist that she spends three Times the Income of her Fortune without running in Debt She maintains a perfect Intimacy with the Lady of the  Irish  Peer and in Acts of Friendship to her repays all the Obligations she owes to her Husband  Mrs  Western  was soon reconciled to her Niece  Sophia  and hath spent two Months together with her in the Country Lady  Bellaston  made the latter a formal Visit at her Return to Town where she behaved to  Jones  as to a perfect Stranger and with great Civility wished him Joy on his Marriage  Mr  Nightingale  hath purchased an Estate for his Son in the Neighbourhood of  Jones  where the young Gentleman his Lady Mrs  Miller  and her little Daughter reside and the most agreeable Intercourse subsists between the two Families  As to those of lower Account Mrs  Waters  returned into the Country had a Pension of  l  a Year settled upon her by Mr  Allworthy  and is married to Parson  Supple  on whom at the Instance of  Sophia Western  hath bestowed a considerable Living  Black George  hearing the Discovery that had been made run away and was never since heard of and  Jones  bestowed the Money on his Family but not in equal Proportions for  Molly  had much the greatest Share  As for  Partridge Jones  hath settled  l  a Year on him and he hath again set up a School in which he meets with much better Encouragement than formerly and there is now a Treaty of Marriage on Foot between him and Miss  Molly Seagrim  which through the Mediation of  Sophia  is likely to take Effect  We now return to take Leave of Mr  Jones  and  Sophia  who within two Days after their Marriage attended Mr  Western  and Mr  Allworthy  into the Country  Western  hath resigned his Family Seat and the greater Part of his Estate to his Soninlaw and hath retired to a lesser House of his in another Part of the Country which is better for Hunting Indeed he is often as a Visitant with Mr  Jones  who as well as his Daughter hath an infinite Delight in doing every Thing in their Power to please him And this Desire of theirs is attended with such Success that the old Gentleman declares he was never happy in his Life till now He hath here a Parlour and Antichamber to himself where he gets drunk with whom he pleases and his Daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it for  Jones  hath assured her that as next to pleasing her one of his highest Satisfactions is to contribute to the Happiness of the old Man so the great Duty which she expresses and performs to her Father renders her almost equally dear to him with the Love which she bestows on himself  Sophia  hath already produced him two fine Children a Boy and a Girl of whom the old Gentleman is so fond that he spends much of his Time in the Nursery where he declares the tattling of his little GrandDaughter who is above a Year and half old is sweeter Music than the finest Cry of Dogs in  England  Allworthy  was likewise greatly liberal to  Jones  on the Marriage and hath omitted no Instance of shewing his Affection to him and his Lady who love him as a Father Whatever in the Nature of  Jones  had a Tendency to Vice has been corrected by continual Conversation with this good Man and by his Union with the lovely and virtuous  Sophia  He has also by Reflexion on his past Follies acquired a Discretion  and Prudence very uncommon in one of his lively Parts  To conclude as there are not to be found a worthier Man and Woman than this fond Couple so neither can any be imagined more happy They preserve the purest and tenderest Affection for each other an Affection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual Esteem Nor is their Conduct towards their Relations and Friends less amiable than towards one another And such is their Condescension their Indulgence and their Beneficence to those below them that there is not a Neighbour a Tenant or a Servant who doth not most gratefully bless the Day when Mr  Jones  was married to  Sophia  FINIS
