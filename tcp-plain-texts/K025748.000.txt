 THE LORD'S CUP OR THE Dispensations of Providence WITH REGARD TO  GOOD AND EVIL  CONSIDERED IN A SERMON  BY WILLIAM GILPIN  VICAR OF BOLDRE  LYMINGTON  PRINTED AND SOLD BY J B RUTTER▪  TO THE INHABITANTS  LYMINGTON  This discourse preached former∣ly in their church and now printed to encourage a deserving young townsman of theirs who has just set up a press is inscribed by their  affectionate and humble Servant Will Gilpin  Vicar's Hill  March    In the hand of the Lord  ere is a cup and the wine is red it is fullmixed and he poureth out of the same As for the dregs thereof the ungodly of the earth shall drink them and suck them out  Psalm lxxv  THE dispensations of God with regard to this world are represented in scripture under various similitudes not so much with a view to explain them as to give us such conceptions of them only as are necessaryAmong these several images that of a  cup  is one of the most frequent It occurs in many of the Divine Writersin David particularly He speaks of the  cup of salvation  of the  Lord's being the portion of his cup  of his  cup running over  and here in this beautiful pas∣sage he carries the illustration farther  In the hand of the Lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is fullmixed and he poureth out of the same As for the dregs thereof the ungodly of the earth shall drink them and suck them out  From these words I shall First examine the  Contents  of the Lord's cup and shall Secondly and Thirdly shew you how the  Ungodly  and how the  Godly  drink of it  First with regard to the Contents of the Lord's cup we are told  the wine is red  but  it is fullmixed  that is however fair the appearances of things may be however splendid any state of happiness or any situation of life may appear it is  fullmixed  there is always added to it a certain portion of evil By  evil  I mean only the usual misfortunes and afflictions of human life These are what temper the  cup of the Lord  and in this  mixed  state it is poured out to the inhabitants of the earth  All nature as well as man partakes of this mix∣tureWe see storms purifying the air but at the same time destroying the labours of men the seasons sometimes kind but as often inclement rains fertilizing the earth but also deluging itthe ground bearing fruits and grain but weeds also and noxious herbsthe ocean expanding its broad bosom for the benefit of commerce but the scene also of devouring tempests and overflowing tides  If we examine animal life we shall find here also as far as it regards man the same mixture of good and evil Some animals are useful for food others for labour and others for conveni∣ence but a greater number we find are mischiev∣ous The larger beasts of prey devour by their strength the inferior by their craft and the blighting infect by its multitude  If from the irrational part of nature we take a view of man and his labours we shall find the same mixture of good and evil In himself what a compound is he of virtue and vice Religion and hypocrisy honesty and deceit charity and ma∣lice compassion and unfeelingness with many other contrarieties are continually taking their turns in his mind Good suggestions often im∣press him but temptations are strong and his practice wayward  Man being thus compounded of good and evil all his labours partake of the mixture His food is turned to intemperance his dress to vanity his amusements to diffipation Let him form what schemes what plans what systems he will let him employ all his little prudence and foresight in bringing them to perfection still he will find mixed with them in some shape or other uncer∣tainty disappointment and miscarriage  Thus in the various circumstances of his life good and bad pursue each other like the lights and shadows of a stormy day The sun may break out at intervals yet it never happens but that either the morning the noon or at least the evening of his day is obscured Light and darkness are not more connected than good and evil David al∣luding to these sudden changes tells us that  heavi∣ness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning  As this is the case thereforeas the  Lord's cup  is thus mixed with bitter as well as sweet ingredi∣ents and as we all must drink it let us examine in what way we may drink it bestAnd first let us see how the  Ungodly man  drinks it which was the  Second  point I proposed to consider  The text says  he drinks the dregs  Now the dregs of any liquor are the pernicious parts It is fairly implied therefore that the Ungodly man turns both the good and evil of life to his own destruction  Let us first see him in prosperous circumstances with the cup of plenty in his hand Here he ap∣pears in a very unfavourable light Prosperity hardens him It supplies nourishment to all his bad passions  His  unfeeling heart is never touched  by the wants of others All is centered in him∣selfIf he has been by the favour of Providence successful in any trade or profession it is then his languageat least his sentimentthat he has made himself happylet others take the same means if they willIf they have been less prudent or less industrious than he has been let them suffer for their folly In short from looking up to no cause above him but thinking himself the source of all his enjoyments he begins to fancy himself superior to others and of course holds others in contempt He becomes arrogant proud and as∣suming and his features are commonly marked with what the Psalmist so expressively calls  the scornful reproof of the wealthy  In his gratifications perhaps the  Ungodly  man takes the road of pleasure Then all is riot and excess religion conscience decency are no limits to himRuin often succeeds  But perhaps he drinks the cup of prosperity more cautiously He has the foresight to provide against the ruin which destroys the thoughtless pro∣fligate and to act under the conduct of worldly wisdom Then we see him enjoying his prospe∣rity in a different way Instead of squandering his wealth he hoards it Every increase of his for∣tune increases also his desires The same hardness  of heart which the other shewed in providing for his pleasures he shews in raising an estate Con∣science and religion are equally the scorn of both  The prosperity of the  Ungodly  man takes com∣monly one or the other of these courses the  blessings  of the Lord's cup he turns to his own destruction As he is ill qualified to receive  good  from the Lord let us now see whether he is better qualified to receive  evil  for as we observ∣ed the cup of the Lord is  fullmixed  Evil in some shape will sooner or later certainly overtake him When the weight of misfortune or the dis∣tress of sickness or the infirmities of age come up∣on him then the  dregs of the Lord's cup  become a bitter potion to him Like a froward child he knows not what he wants Every thing distresses nothing can please him He never feels the joys of religionthe heartfelt satisfaction of a good con∣science and the tranquility of a peaceful mind which alone can soothe the anxiety of misfortune or ease the bed of sickness Now he  suffers  that keen distress which he never  pitied  in othersthat want of assistance himself which he never adminis∣tered to them  Thus wretched in himself you see him in a still more disagreeable light when he mixes with others  See him when you will he is always either finding fault or making complaint But follow him home and you will there find his illhumours breaking out with double force Miserable are all who are thus unhappily connected with him In∣stead of the mild sweet smile of suffering piety the softened look of tenderness with which every offer to do him service should be received he spurns the hand that soothes him The kindest offers to serve him are received like injuries The tenderness of relations the consolation of friends instead of asswaging his illhumours serve only to excite them Peevish and fretful he distributes his own sufferings in large proportions upon his ser∣vants dependants and nearer connectionsAnd yet tho you would imagine he was wholly out of love with life and wished for nothing more than to leave it with disgust you are mistaken He seems fonder of it at least more loth to leave it than the man who enjoys it most His attachment to the expiring moments of life is most happily expressed in the text he not only drinks the dregs of the cup but he keeps them to his mouth as long as he can  he sucks them out  The most horrible sight which the world can furnish is that of a wicked wretch on the edge of eternity when all hope of  life is over and he has just sensibility enough to see before him the gulf of despair Let us turn aside from a spectacle which makes the blood run cold and see as we proposed  Thirdly  how the  Godly man  drinks of the Lord's cup  In the first place the  Godly man  expects to find a portion of evil in his cup He sees the pro∣priety of it and fully acknowledges the great usefulness of this  mixture  of good and evil If the potion were perfectly palatable he fears he might drink to excess If all things went smooth and easy with himif in the current of life no rubs no stoppages no difficulties ever occurred what would be the consequence He might be secure in the midst of danger Tho mortal he might never think of mortality The difficulties of life the frequent checks he meets with are what put him continually on his guard Disappointment corrects his passions and shews him that he is not to imagine he must have things here as he pleases but must expect his portion of evil He takes the world therefore for what it is and does not fix his happiness upon it  All this in the sincerity of his heart he acknow∣ledges and approves and thus far even his reason  carries him But when he opens the word of God he finds the various dispensations of heaven placed in a still juster light He finds this world repre∣sented in the gospel as a state of trial prepara∣tory to future happiness and the good and evil of life as the  means of this trial  contributing equally to  exercise  and  prove  his religion  Many are the virtues which  prosperity  gives him room to exercise and which he could not exer∣cise amidst the  evils  of life and many are the vir∣tues which are the attendants of  affliction  and are little known in the prosperous hour He drinks the cup of the Lord therefore as the Lord intends  When it pleases heaven to bless him when his designs succeed and his hopes dilate in some view of happiness before him "Now is the time" he suggests to himself  when I must guard my heart with double care Now is the time when inso∣lence and wantonness and pride the attendants of a prosperous hour are most liable to corrupt me Let me be careful to bar all entrance against them Let prosperity soften my heart instead of hardening it Let me be humble and mild and condescending and obliging to all In the midst of my own enjoyments let my heart ex∣pand  Let me feel the misery of others and turn my plenty to the relief of their necessity  Again when it pleases heaven to mix some bitter ingredient in his cup still he has the same sense of acting under the will of God  Now he cries is the time when I am to exercise patience and resignation Now my religion is put to the test  Shall I receive good at the hand of the Lord and not receive evil  Gracious God grant that I may improve my heart under this trial of my faith and make my sufferings through Jesus Christ the means of purifying my affecti∣ons Let me for his sake bear a trifling part of what he bore for me and let me keep that great pattern of suffering resignation always be∣fore my eyes  Thus the  Godly man  drinks of the Lord's cup and his draught whether sweet or bitter is whole∣some to him This blessed resignation of his own will in all instances to the will of God regulates his affectionscorrects his thoughtsand draws him back to the sober recollection of his station here by checking each idea as it arises of worldly happiness And yet tho this pious re∣signation lessens the world in his eye it is so far from interfering with his worldly happiness that  it sheds the sunshine of chearfulness continually in his breastBut most of all when the world sinks under him he feels its blessed effects While life is extinguishing it is a cordial to pain and gives tranquility to death  Let us then after the  Godly man's  example take the Lord's cup with all its ingredients  fullmixed  in∣to our hands Let us always remember whose cup it is and who  pours it out  It is the Lord himself Whatever therefore the draught is let us consider it as mixed and tempered by the great physician of our souls It may be unpalatablebut it is our own fault if it be not beneficial  THE END
