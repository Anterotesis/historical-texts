LANDLORD and MONFORD  Land  WELCOME to town your honoura long while since I saw your honourwas saying but this very morning that it was many months since I saw my worthy master Squire Monford  Monf  Say so still Landlordfor I am come to town incog and wish to conceal my arrival here  Land  Ah a pair of fine eyes in the case you have sprung all the game about the country and now you are coming to poach on some poor fellow's manor in London  Monf  No faith there is no poaching in the case I mean to take out a licence for sporting on a certain manor call'd Matrimony  "Land  Matrimony Lord Sir 'tis well enough for your dogtrotswe must to be sure have cattle for the high road business of life but who the devil wou'd think of running a racehorse in a postchaise'tis time enough to put him in harness when he is no longer able to win a sweepstakes  "Monf  Why look'e Landlord I don't think that twenty years of dissipation will qualify me the better for a husband I look on marriage as a sort of partnership in which I mean to engage whilst I can bring youth good spirits and a good constitution as my share of the stock in trade but when a pretty girl finds herself intrapp'd into a connection with a bankrupt trader can he be angry with her for taking measures to dissolve the partnership"  Land  Well your honourand this intended fair partner of yours  Monf  She is coming to town with her father and will be in this house in the course of an hour or two  Land  The old story I supposethe father averse to the match  Monf  Yes unfortunately for mebut my charmer has consented to a private marriage I am now going in search of lodgings for us and shall be with you again presently  Exit  Land  Ah there he goesas pretty a fellow aye and as good a customer as an innkeeper wou'd wish to live bynever knew him look at  the items of a bill in my lifealways paid it the moment he saw the sum total and submitted to be cheated like a gentleman  Enter SIMON  Simon  Landlord how are you my boy Come let's have a glass  sitting down at the table  you are a jolly fellow  Land  And i'faith you seem to be the sameI think it is now three days since you came to town on the Buryfly during which time you have scarcely been sober three hours  Simon  Psha psha 'tis only my not being us'd to ride on the roof of the coach that made me giddya sudden exaltation may turn better heads than mine  Land  And pray have you no business in town  "Simon  None of my own  Land  But you have some of your master's"  Simon  Yes I have a letter from my master to his son which I was order'd to deliver directly but faith I forgot it "and it don't much signify I hate to be a messenger of ill news  "Land  You know the contents then  "Simon  Yes yes my old master is coming to town to visit his son" aye here is the letter  To Mr John Whimsey Junior at Mrs Pattypan's Pastrycook in Piccadilly  Land  Heyday why you are not going to open your master's letter  Simon  Certainly I will my master wou'd make  no ceremony in opening a letter of mine  reading the letter  Dear John I send you this by my man Simon who will deliver it to you immediately on his arrival in London  Land  And you have been here three days already  Simon  Come Landlord you don't drinkhere's t'ye  drinks  I am coming to town to compleat the purchase of my neighbour Squander's estate and shall take up my quarters at your lodgings for two or three days I shall bring your sister with me as I hear there is a rakish young dog of the name of Monford has taken it in his head to fall in love with her and I don't chuse to trust her out of my sight  Land  Zounds why did not you tell me at first who was your master  Aside  If I had but known it before Monford left the house  Simon  Why between you and me I am halfasham'd to own my masterhe is as suspicious of every body about him as if he had been bred a rogue himself"a servant has not much credit in the place I assure you"  Land  Heyday here's a postchaise come to the door  Simon  With my master and his daughter in it as I live  WHIMSEY  without  Mind the portmanteau sirrah d'ye hear and take care none of the bundles are stolen  Exit Landlord  Simon  Aye there his suspicions are beginning alreadyif he has lost but a button from his coat he'll put the postillion to his oath and have the very horses taken before a magistrate  "Land  Well I must run and prepare to receive him  Exit  "Simon  Yes so must I and with the same kind of receptiona good lye and a smiling countenance"  Enter WHIMSEY CHARLOTTE and LANDLORD  Land  This way Madamthis way SirI hope your honour has had a good journey  Whim  No I have not had a good journey I have had lame horses and drunken driversdust from the roadextortion from the innkeepers and bad halfpence from the turnpikesA blight upon honesty and good manners blows from this city of London to every point of the compassIt is a mere ocean of knavery with a continual springtide which infects all the streams of freshwater round the country and makes them brackish up to their very source  Land  'Tis very true your honour travelling is very dear now  Whim  Dear with a vengeanceI remember the time when a man cou'd be choak'd upon a dusty road for seven pence a mile but now one must pay a shilling a mile for the pleasure of being smother'd because it is one of the luxuries of life  To Charlotte  You have not lost your watch have you  Char  Oh no Sir all is safe about me  aside  except my heart  Whim  My pockets were all safe when I got out of the chaise I suppose I have hardly lost any thing since I came into

empty onesBut where is my rascal  Simon  coming forward  Here am I Sir  Whim  Well sirrah I suppose my son and you have been laying your heads together to cheat the old fellow when he came to townwhat did he say when he read my letter  Simon  He presents his dutiful respects and anxiously expects the pleasure of seeing you  Whim  Go to be buried I dare say he doesbut I'm resolv'd to live temperately out of spite to himLandlord see if the coach is come  Exit Landlord  And you  to Simon  go and see all the luggage put safely into it  Exit Simon  Come Charlotte uncloud your countenance  don't tell me of having lost your hearta young girl's heart is like a tame pigeon let her throw it away ten times in a month it will be sure to come back again  Enter SIMON  Simon  The coach is ready Sir  Whim  Very well be sure then and take the number and d'ye hear if there is any cordage from the trunks left save it Simonthough it be ever so little it may serve to tie up something or other  Simon  Certainly Sir if it is but a yard of ropeI think I should know how to apply it properly  Exeunt severally  SCENE Mrs PATTYPAN's Shop  Mrs PATTYPAN and YOUNG WHIMSEY  Mrs Patt  Upon my word Mr

subjectyou see it distresses her and you know one must consult a woman's feelings on some occasions  Whim  Certainly certainly  Monf  I am sure I shou'd be sorry to hurt Mrs Pattypan's delicacy  Whim  So shou'd Iwhen a woman has but just enough left for her immediate use it wou'd be cruel indeed to damage thatI'll change the subject Monford depend upon it  He converses with Mrs Pattypan in dumb shew  Enter FRANK  Frank  Aside to Monf  Sir it is an impossibility for you to procure an interview with Miss Charlotte  Monf  Impossible Frank  Frank  Absolutely soshe is so closely watchedbut I've engag'd one in your interest who will take any message to her for you No less a person than Mr Timothy Tartlett  "Monf  But how can he assist me  "Frank  By communicating to your mistress any message you wish he will never be suspected"  Monf  Not a bad thought i'faith  Frank  He is waiting to speak to you below stairsslip away from the old gentlemen directly  Whim  Now what the devil can they be whispering aboutI always suspect a man to be a rogue when I see him whisper  Whimsey interrupts and looks anxiously at them  Eh why you have not chang'd your mind as to matrimony have you  Exit Frank  Monf  Not in the least I promise you SirI am now going on some business which I flatter myself will hasten the match and a few hours will I hope cure all your suspicions  Exit  Whim  Egad tho' I'll ask the old woman some questions about him there can be no harm in thatPray Mrs Pattypan if I don't hurt your delicacy by the question how long may you have been acquainted with this young man whom you are going to marry  Mrs Patt  Aside  Young man whom I am going to marry how the deuce cou'd he hear of my intending to marry Tim Tartlett  Whim  You'll excuse my curiositybut pray is not he rather wild  Mrs Patt  Aside  Yes yeshe means Tim  to him  Why Sir I fear he is rather flightyhe has his little gallantries  Whim  Look ye Mrs Pattypanas to his little gallantries as you call them perhaps I know more of the matter than you do  Mrs Patt  Dear Sir you awaken my curiosity  "Whim  But really when I consider how disagreeable a task it is to interfere between man and wifefor such I consider you to be  "Mrs Patt  'Tis very true Sirin all the quarrels that I had with my poor dear soul that's dead and gone and many they were we never admitted any body to interfere but fought them out by ourselves  "Whim  However on this occasion my friendship for you overcomes every other consideration"In a word your intended husband has made love to my daughter  Mrs Patt  What do I hear I shall certainly faint  Whim  attempting to support her  For Heaven's sake don't faint yet for I can't support you upon my soul  Mrs Patt  An ungrateful fellowwho owes all he has in the world to me  "Whim  Then of course all he has in the world ought to be at your disposal but he did n't own to me that he was even acquainted with you  "Mrs Patt  I have been a mother to him  "Whim  Perhaps he thought you fitter to be his mother than his wife  "Mrs Patt"  Oh Sir it is not to be repeated what I have done for that young man  Whim  If it is not to be repeated I'm sure I don't wish to hear it Mrs PattypanBut between you and meI suspect the girl is fond of him  "Mrs Patt  Fond of him  "Whim  Indeed I don't wonder at ithe is a handsome dog"  Mrs Patt  He is to be sure a likely young fellownot that I consider his personthe mind is my choicewhat are fine eyesflowing locksbrilliant complexions  Whim  interrupting her  Mighty pretty things to look at Mrs Pattypan  Aside  Tho' you never found them in your glass  Mrs Patt  But what are they compared to the beauties of the mind  Whim  Faith I don't knowComparisons are odious and therefore I shan't attempt them  Mrs Patt  Beauty is but skin deep  Whim  Aside  Then i'faith your skin conceals it more effectually than any skin I ever saw in my life  Mrs Patt  But pray Sir how did you first discover this affairtell me all the particulars  Whim  I would if I had thought of it a little soonerbut for aught I know at this moment your scapegrace may be explaining to my daughter some particulars of which I shou'd wish her at present to
