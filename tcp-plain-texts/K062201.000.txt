 LETTERS Written TO and FOR PARTICULAR FRIENDS On the most IMPORTANT OCCASIONS Directing not only the Requisite STYLE  and  FORMS To be Observed in WRITING Familiar Letters But How to THINK and ACT  Justly  and  Prudently  IN THE COMMON CONCERNS OF HUMAN LIFE  CONTAINING One Hundred and Seventythree LETTERS None of which were ever before Published  LONDON  Printed for C RIVINGTON in  St Paul  's  Churchyard  J OSBORN in  Paternoster Row  and J LEAKE at  Bath  MDCCXLI  PREFACE  _THE following Letters are publish'd at the Solicitation of particular Friends who are of Opinion that they will answer several good Ends as they may not only direct the  Forms  requisite to be observed on the most important Occasions but what is more to the Purpose by the Rules and Instructions contained in them contribute to  mend the Heart  and  improve the Understanding  NATURE PROPRIETY of CHARACTER PLAIN SENSE and GENERAL USE have been the chief Objects of the Author's Attention in the penning of these Letters and as he everywhere aimed to write to the  Judgment  rather than to the  Imagination  he would chuse that they should generally be found more  useful  than  diverting  Tho' where the Subjects require  Strokes of Humour  and  innocent Raillery  it will be seen perhaps that the Method he has taken was the Effect of  Choice  and not merely of  Necessity  The Writer is no Friend to long Prefaces but it may be necessary however to say what he has  aimed at  in this Performance and to leave his  Merit  in the  Execution  of it to proper Judges  He has endeavour'd then in general throughout the great Variety of his Subjects to inculcate the Principles of  Virtue  and  Benevolence  to describe  properly  and recommend  strongly  the SOCIAL and RELATIVE DUTIES and to place them in such  practical  Lights that the Letters may serve for Rules to THINK and ACT by as well as Forms to WRITE after  Particularly he has endeavoured to point out the Duty of a  Servant  not a  Slave  the Duty of a  Master  not a  Tyrant  that of the  Parent  not as a Person morose and sour and hard to be pleased but mild indulgent kind and such an one as would rather govern by  Persuasion  than  Force  He has endeavour'd to direct the young Man in the Choice of his  Friends  and  Companions  to excite him to  Diligence  to discourage  Extravagance Sottishness  and  Vice  of all Kinds  He has aimed to set forth in a Variety of Cases to  both Sexes  the Inconveniencies attending  unsuitable Marriages  to expose the Folly of a  litigious Spirit  to console the  Unhappy  to comfort the  Mourner  And many of these by Arguments tho'  easy  and  familiar  yet  new  and  uncommon  With regard to the Letters of  Courtship  the Author has aimed to point out such Methods of Address to a young Man as may stand the Test of the  Parents Judgment  as well as the  Daughter's Opinion  and at the same time that they should not want the proper Warmth of Expression which Complaisance and Passion for the beloved Object inspire and is so much expected in Addresses of this Nature they should have their Foundation laid in  common Sense  and a  manly Sincerity  and in a Word be such as a  prudent Woman  need not blush to receive nor a  discreet Man  be ashamed to look  back upon when the  doubtful Courtship  is changed into the  matrimonial Certainty  With this View he has also attempted to expose the  empty Flou ishes  and  incoherent Rhapsodies  by which  shallow Heads  and  designing Hearts  endeavour to exalt their Mistresses into  Goddesses  in hopes of having it in their Power to sink them into the Characters of the  most Credulous  and  Foolish  of their Sex  Orphans  and  Ladies  of  independent Fortunes  he has particularly endeavour'd to guard against the insidious Arts of their  flattering  and  selfish  Dependents and the  clandestine  Addresses of  Fortunehunters  those Beasts of Prey as they may well be called who spread their  Snares  for the  innocent  and  thoughtless  Heart  These among other no less material Objects have been the Author's principal  Aim  How well he has  succeeded  must as has been hinted be left to the Judgment of the candid Reader  THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTERS  I TO a Father against putting a Youth of but moderate Parts to a Profession that requires more extensive Abilities  Page    II From an Uncle to a Nephew on

Abilities  Dear Sir  _YOU pay me a Compliment tho' a very obliging one when in the last Letter you favoured me with you desire my Advice with respect to the Disposition of your Son  William  whom you are inclin'd to bring up to the Bar If in complying with your Request I should say any thing you may not intirely approve you will not have so much room to  blame me as your own wrong Choice of a Counsellor  I need not now tell you I have a good Opinion of  Will  and think him a modest grave sober Youth But for this very Reason I hardly think him qualified for the Profession you would chuse for him for I doubt he has neither Talents for the Law nor ever will have the Presence of Mind necessary to make a Figure at the Bar In any smooth easy Business he will probably succeed and be a useful Member of the Commonwealth And as he is not your eldest Son I should were it to me put him to a Merchant or as we live in an Island and Trade and Navigation are both our Riches and our Glory I should not even scruple to put a  second  Son to a creditable wholesale Dealer rather than fail if he himself is not averse to such a Calling For I know not you'll excuse me I'm sure whether  Will  's Genius is equal to that of an universal Merchant For the various Springs of Commerce the Seasons for chusing proper Commodities and numberless Incidents that make a necessary Return of Gain precarious are full Imployment for the strongest Judgment as a Man by one illchosen Venture often loses more than he gains by several successful ones  But this Opinion of  Will  should you think it just will be no Obstacle to his succeeding in the World in some creditable easy Business Tho' I think him unequal to the Part you seem inclinable to allot him yet he is no Fool And Experience teaches us that in some sorts of Business ample Advantage may be made by very moderate Talents with much Reputation These are principally such Employments as merely consist in Buyng with Prudence and in Selling at a Marketprofit  Hence we see several Wholesale Dealers gain large Fortunes with Ease and Credit and without any other Secret than the plain Practice of Buying at the best Hand paying for their Goods punctually and vending them always  for what they are  In Dealings of this Kind the Fatigues are few and clear wellkept Books are sufficient to shew at any time a Man's Loss or Gain for which generally speaking less than One Forenoon in a Week is sufficient And yet by a constant Attention in this easy manner as  good  a Character and very often  more  Money is to be gained than in Professions that require an extraordinary Genius a perpetual Attention and a close and intense Study which very seldom succeeds neither For see you not of Hundreds of Lawyers how very few of them make a Figure or get genteel Bread And how many for want of Courage to appear at the Bar who yet have good Parts and Knowledge in the Laws are forced to confine themselves to Chamberpractice in which it is a long time before they grow noted enough to make a tolerable Livelihood  As to what you hint of placing him in the Physick Tribe I like this no better than the other Consider only this one Thing how long it is before he will be capable of entering into Business or Reputation as a Physician if he ever does it at all For who chuses to trust his Health to a raw and unexperienced young Man The Law requires a sprightly Impudence if I may so say the Physick Line a solemn one in the Person who would make a Figure in either And do you think tho'  Will  is grave enough of Conscience that he ever can come up to that important Deportment that unblushing Parade which is the very Essence of an  English  Physician So he may in either of the Prosessions  live over all his Days and be quite unknown for as  Practice  in both Faculties is the best Teacher and  Theory  a most uncertain Guide he may live to be Forty of Fifty Years of Age and not come into any Business that shall improve himself or benefit his Consulters  Whereas in the Way I propose no sooner is he come of Age and fit to be trusted with the Management of any Affairs at all but his Seven Years will be expired and if he has not been wanting to himself in it and if he be he would have been much more so in an abstruser Business he will be enabled with the Fortune you can bestow upon him to enter upon the Stage of the World with great Advantage and become  directly  a necessary and an useful Member of the Community And my good Friend when you and I recollect that most of the noble Families in the Kingdom as well as the genteel ones had the Foundations of their Grandeur laid in Trade I expect not in such a Country as ours especially that any Objection to my Advice will be form'd either by you or your good Lady on this Score if you have not more significant Reasons proceeding from the Boy's Turn of Mind and Inclination which I think should always be consulted on these Occasions For tho' I hope it never will be so in your Case yet nothing has been more common than that of Two Sons the Eldest brought up to the Estate the other to Trade in the Revolution of Twenty or Thirty Years the latter thro' the Extravagance of the former has made himself  Eldest  as I may say for by saving while the other has been spending he has found Means to keep the Estate in the Family tho' it has been transferr'd upon the  youngest  and as it has then proved the  worthiest  Branch  This I think deserves your Consideration and by viewing  Will  in the same Light I do that of a wellinclined Lad of moderate Passions great natural Modesty and no soaring Genius I believe you will think it best to dispose of him in such manner as may require no greater Talents than he is possessed of and may in due Time make him appear in the Face of the World fully qualified for what he undertakes I am Sir  Your very humble Servant  LETTER II From an UNCLE to a NEPHEW on his keeping bad Company bad Hours  c  in his Apprenticeship  Dear Nephew  I AM very much concerned to hear that you are of late fallen into bad Company that you keep bad Hours and give great Uneasiness to your Master and break the Rules of his Family That when he expostulates with you on this Occasion you return pert and bold Answers and instead of promising or endeavouring to amend repeat the Offence and have enter'd into Clubs and Societies of young Fellows who set at naught all good Example and make such Persons who would do their Duty the Subject of their Ridicule as Persons of narrow Minds and who want the Courage to do as they do  Let me on this Occasion expostulate with you and set before you the Evil of the Way you are in  In the first Place What can you mean by breaking the Rules of a Family you had bound your self by Contract to observe Do you think it is  honest  to break thro' Engagements into which you have so solemnly entered and which are no less the Rules of the Corporation you are to be one Day free of than those of a private FamilySeven Years several of which are elapsed are not so long a Term but that you may see it determined before you are overfit to betrusted with your own Conduct Twentyone or Twentytwo Years of Age is full early for a young Man to be his own Master whatever you may think and you may surely stay till  then  at least to chuse your own Hours and your own Company and I fear as you go on if you do not mend your Ways your Discretion will not  then  do Credit to your Choice Remember you have no Time you can call your own during the Continuance of your Contract and must you abuse your Master in a double Sense rob him of his Time especially if any of it be Hours of Business rob him of his Rest break the Peace of his Family and give a bad Example to others And all for what Why to riot in the Company of a Set of Persons who contemn as they teach you to do all Order and Discipline who in all Likelihood will lead you into into Gaming Drinking Swearing and even more dangerous Vices to the unhinging of your Mind from your Business which must be your future Support  Consider I exhort you in time to what these Courses may lead you Consider the Affiction you will give to all your Friends by your Continuance in them Lay together the Substance of the Conversation that passes in a whole Evening with your frothy Companions after you are come  from them and reflect what solid Truth what useful Lesson worthy of being inculcated in your future Life that whole Evening has afforded you and consider whether it is worth breaking thro' all Rule and Order forWhether your present Conduct is such as you would allow in a Servant of your own Whether you are so capable to pursue your Business with that Ardor and Delight next Morning as if you had not drank or kept bad Hours over Night If not whether your Master has not a double Loss and Damage from your misspent Evenings Whether the taking of small Liberties as you may think them leads you not on to greater for let me tell you you will not find it in your Power to stop when you will And then whether any Restraint at all will not in time be irksome to you  I have gone thro' the like Servitude with Pleasure and Credit I found myself my own Master full soon for my Discretion What you think of your self I know not but I wish you may do as well for your own Interest and Reputation too as I have done for mine And I'll assure you I should not have thought it either creditable or  honest  to do as you do I could have stood the Laugh of an Hundred such vain Companions as you chuse for being too narrowminded to break thro' all moral Obligations to my Master in order to shew the Bravery of a bad Heart and what an abandon'd Mind dared to perpetrate A bad Beginning seldom makes a good Ending and if you was assured that you could stop when you came for your self which is very improbable how will you answer it to Equity and good Conscience that you will not do so for your Master There is let me tell you more true Bravery of Mind in forbearing to do an Injury than in giving Offence  You are now at an Age when you should study to  improve  not  divert  your Faculties You should now lay in a Fund of Knowledge that in time when ripened by Experience may make you a worthy Member of the Commonwealth Do you think you have nothing to learn either as to your Business or as to the forming of your Mind Would it not be much better to chuse the silent the sober Conversation of BOOKS than of such Companions as never read or think An Author never commits any but his best Thoughts to Paper but what can you expect from the laughing noisy Company you keep but frothy Prate indigested Notions and Thoughts so unworthy of being remember'd that it is the greatest Kindness to forget them  Let me intreat you then my dear Kinsman for your Family's sake for your own sake before it be too late to reflect as you ought upon the Course you are enter'd into By applying yourself to Books instead of such vain Company you will be qualified in time for the best of Company and to be respected by all Ranks of Men This will keep you out of unnecessary Expences will employ all your leisure Time will exclude a world of Temptations and open and inlarge your Notions of M  n and Things and finally set you above that wretched Company which now you seem so much delighted with And one Thing let me recommend to you That you keep a List of the young Men of your Standing within the Compass of your Knowledge and for the next Seven Years observe what Fate will attend them See if those who follow  not  the Course you are so lately enter'd into will not appear in a very different Light from those who  do  and from the Industry and Prosperity of the one and the  Decay or Failure of the other if their vain Ways do not blast them before or as soon as they begin the World you'll find abundant Reason every Day to justify the Truth of the Observations I have thrown together As nothing but my Affection for you could possibly influence me to these Expostulations I hope for a proper Effect from them if you would be thought well of by or expect any Favour from  Your loving Uncle  Your Master will at my Request send me word of the Success of my Remonstrances  LETTER III A WidowMother's Letter in Answer to her Son's complaining of Hardships in his Apprenticeship  Dear  Billy  I AM very sorry to hear of the Difference between your Master and you I was always afraid you would expect the same Indulgences you had met with at home and as you know that in many Instances I have endeavoured to make any seeming Hardship as easy to you as I could if this causes you to be harder to be satisfied it would be a great Trouble to me Your Uncle tells me I am afraid with too much Truth that the Indulgences you have received from me have made your present Station more disagreeable than it would otherwise have been What I have always done for you was intended for your Good and nothing could so deeply afflict me as to see my Tenderness  have a contrary Effect Therefore dear Child to my constant Care for your Welfare do not add the Sorrow of seeing it the Cause of your behaving worse than if it had not been bestow'd upon you for as before we put you to your Master we had an extraordinary Character of him from all his Neighbours and those who dealt with him and as Mr  Joseph  who is now out of his Time gives him the best of Characters and declares your Mistress to be a Woman of great Prudence and good Conduct I know not how to think they would use you ill in any respect But consider my Dear you must not in any Woman beside myself expect to find a fond and perhaps partial Mother for the little Failings which I could not see in you will appear very plain to other Persons My Love for you would make me wish you always with me but as that is what your future Welfare will no way permit and as you must certainly be a Gainer by the Situation you are now in let a Desire to promote  my  Happiness as well as  your own  make every seeming Difficulty light which I hope will appear much lighter for being what I intreat you to dispense with who am  Your ever loving Mother  I have desir'd your Uncle to interpose in this Matter and he writes to you on this Occasion and has promised to see Justice done you in case your Complaints be reasonable  LETTER IV An Uncle's Letter to the Youth on the same Occasion  Cousin  William  I AM sorry you should have any Misunderstanding with your Master I have a good Opinion of him and am unwilling to entertain a bad one of you It is so much a Master's Interest to use his Apprentices well that I am inclinable to think that when they are badly treated it is oftener the Effect of Provocation than Choice Wherefore before I give myself the Trouble of interposing in your Behalf I desire you will strictly inquire of yourself whether you have not by some Misconduct or other provoked that Alteration in your Master's Behaviour of which you so much complain If after having diligently complied with this Request you assure me that you are not sensible of having given Cause of Disgust on your Side I will readily use my best Endeavours to reconcile you to your Master or procure you another But if you find yourself blameble it will be better for you to remove by your own Amendment the Occasion of your Master's Displeasure than to have me or any other Friend offer to plead your Excuse where you know it would be unjust to defend you If this should be your Case all your Friends together could promise your better Behaviour indeed but as the Performance must even then be your own it will add much more to your Character to pass thro' your whole Term without any Interposition between you Weigh well what I have here said and remember that your future Welfare depends greatly on your present Behaviour I am  Your Loving Kinsman  LETTER V An Apprentice to an Uncle about a Fraud committed by his FellowApprentice to their Master  Dear Uncle  I AM under greater Uneasiness than I am able to express My Fellow'prentice for whom I had a great Regard and from whom I have received many Civilities has involved me in the deepest Affliction I am unwilling to tell you and yet I must not conceal it that he has forfeited the Confidence reposed in him by a Breach of Trust to which he ungenerously gain'd my Consent by a Pretence I did not in the least suspect What must I do My Master is defrauded If I discover the Injury I am sure to ruin a young Man I wou'd fain think possessed of some Merit if I conceal the Injustice I must at present share the Guilt and hereafter be Partaker in the Punishment I am in the greatest Agony of Mind and beg your instant Advice as you value the Peace of  Your dutiful tho' unfortunate Nephew  LETTER VI The Uncle's Answer  Dear Nephew  YOUR Letter which I just now received gives me great Uneasiness And as any Delay in the Discovery may be attended with Consequences which will probably be dangerous to yourself and disagreeable to all who belong to you I  charge you if you value your own Happiness and my Peace to acquaint your Master instantly with the Injustice that has been done him which is the only Means of vindicating your own Innocence and prevent your being looked upon as an Accomplice in a Fact to which I wish you may not be found to have been too far consenting As to the unhappy young Man who has been guilty of so fatal an Indiscretion I wish if the known Clemency and Goodnature of your Master may pardon this Offence he may let his Forgiveness teach him the Ingratitude and Inhumanity of injuring a Man who is not only the proper Guardian of his Youth but whose Goodness deserves the best Behaviour tho' he be generous enough to excuse the worst Let not a Minute pass after you receive this before you reveal the Matter to your Master For I am in Hopes that your Application to me and your following my Advice will greatly plead in your Behalf I will very speedily call on your Master and am as far as an honest Regard for you can make me  Your Loving Uncle  LETTER VII Advice from a Father to a young Beginner what Company to chuse and how to behave in it  Dear  Robin  AS you are now entering into the World and will probably have considerable Dealings in your Business the frequent Occasions you will have for Advice from others will make you desirous  of singling out among your most intimate Acquaintance one or two whom you would view in the Light of Friends  In the Choice of these your utmost Care and Caution will be necessary for by a Mistake here you can scarcely conceive the fatal Effects you may hereafter experience Wherefore it will be proper for you to make a Judgment of those who are fit to be your Advisers by the Conduct they have observed in  their own  Affairs and the  Reputation  they bear in the World For he who has by his own Indiscretions undone himself is much fitter to be set up as a Landmark for a prudent Mariner to shun his Courses than an Example to follow  Old Age is generally slow and heavy Youth headstrong and precipitate but there are old Men who are full of Vivacity and young Men replenish'd with Discretion which makes me rather point out the  Conduct  than the  Age  of the Persons with whom you should chuse to associate tho' after all it is a neverfailing good Sign to me of Prudence and Virtue in a young Man when his Seniors chuse his Company and he delights in theirs  Let your Endeavour therefore be at all Adventures to consort yourself with Men of Sobriety good Sense and Virtue for the Proverb is an unerring one that says  A Man is known by the Company he keeps  If such Men you can single out while you improve by their Conversation you will benefit by their Advice and be sure remember one thing that tho' you must be frank and unreserved in delivering your Sentiments when Occasions offer yet that you be much readier to  hear  than  speak  for to this Purpose it has been significantly observed that Nature has given a Man  two  Ears  and but  one  Tongue Lay in therefore by Observation and a modest Silence such a Store of Ideas that you may at their Time of Life make no worse Figure than they do and endeavour to benefit yourself rather by other Peoples Ills than your own How must those young Men expose themselves to the Contempt and Ridicule of their Seniors who having seen little or nothing of the World are continually shutting out by  open Mouths  and  closed Ears  all Possibility of Instruction and making vain the principal End of Conversation which is Improvement A silent young Man makes generally a wise old one and never fails of being respected by the best and most prudent Men When therefore you come among Strangers hear every one speak before you deliver your own Sentiments by this means you will judge of the Merit and Capacities of your Company and avoid exposing yourself as I have known many do by shooting out hasty and inconsiderate Bolts which they would have been glad to recal when perhaps a silent Genius in Company has burst out upon them with such Observations as have struck Consciousness and Shame in the forward Speaker if he has not been quite insensible of inward Reproach  I have thrown together as they occurr'd a few Thoughts which may suffice for the present to shew my Care and Concern for your Welfare I hope you will constantly from time to time communicate to me whatever you shall think worthy of my Notice or in which my Advice may be of Use to you For I have no Pleasure in this Life equal to that which the Happiness of my Children gives me And of this you may be assured for I am and ever must be  Your affectionate Father  LETTER VIII General Rules for agreeable Conversation in a young Man From a Father to a Son  Dear  William  AS I had not an Opportunity of saying so much to you as I wished when you were last here I send this to inform you of some things in your general Conversation which I think would be proper for you to observe and amend particularly  your excessive Itch for Talking  which discovers itself alike on all Occasions I have always flatter'd myself that you do not want Sense and am willing to hope I have not been deceived But the dangerous Selfsufficiency of most young Men seems violently to have seized you which I hope a little Reflection will remove  The Art of rendering yourself agreeable in Conversation is worth your serious Study 'Tis an Advantage few can boast tho' sought after by all and nothing is so constant an Enemy to Success in those who would excel in this Art as the harbouring an Opinion of their own Proficiency before they have attained to any tolerable Degree of Knowledge in what they imagine themselves possessed of Conversation where it is rightly managed must be so conducted as to let each Member of the Company have a Share in the  Pleasure  and  Applause  it affords If you are Six in Number after you have told a Story or made any Remark which gives a general Satisfaction you must consider it the Right of another to call  your  Attention in his Turn and unless particularly requested it betrays a great Weakness to  follow yourself  No doubt but you love to be admired And have not  others the same Passion You believe your Wit more brilliant than theirs Are you sure that they are not of the same Opinion as to their own If a Man speaks little you must not from thence conclude him willing to give up every Claim to conversible Merit Perhaps he cannot sing But to be sure he is as desirous of having his  peculiar Humour  or his  dry Joke  applauded as you are to be intreated another Song If he is no Mathematician perhaps he is versed in religious Disputation if he despises Plays he may admire History tho' he understands not Geography he may yet know how to describe the Humours of Mankind And tho' he pretends not to Politicks he may have a Turn for some more useful Science When these are considered if his Modesty is great you cannot oblige him more than by throwing an Opportunity in his way to display his Capacity on the Subject he believes himself most able to handle with Advantage For in order to support a thorough good Humour a Man must be pleased with  himself  as well as with  others  When this is properly taken Care of Conversation seldom fails to prove entertaining And to the Neglect of this are owing many of the  yawning  Hours spent in Companies composed of Men not incapable of behaving agreeably  The Manner of telling a Story is also worth your Notice You have known the Pleasure of hearing a long one well told Mr  Trotter  has an admirable Talent in this way But then you must observe that half the Pleasure he gives arises from his happily avoiding any of the silly Digressions which are the great Cause of a Story's seeming tedious You never hear him mingle his Relation with  I remember very well it was the same Day that 'Squire  Trumbul's  Son came of AgeI bought  my bay Nag the very Day before at such a Fair being a  Friday  that Yearor I can scarce think of it without LaughingBut however as I was saying  And a hundred more such Deadweights to Attention Nor does he ever praise a Story before he relates it a fatal Rock to many a good Relation For when any Story wants a preparatory Recommendation it ought not to be told and even when the Relation is possible the Generality of Auditors are apt to persuade themselves  The Mountain labours and a Mouse is born  These are loose and general Hints but by a due Improvement of them you will find yourself very sensibly grow more and more agreeable whereever you converse An Ease and becoming Freedom you already have and by the Addition of Discretion in your Use of them and Complaisance to others you will probably succeed in the Desire so predominant in you of being admired by Men of Sense and Judgment Which will be no small Pleasure to  Your affectionate Father  LETTER IX An elder to a younger Brother who is in Love with a young Lady of great Gaiety  c  Dear Brother  I AM more concerned for your Welfare than you imagine You are younger than myself My Duty in some Degree requires my Care for your Good and particularly in a Point that may  be so material to your whole Life as is that of Love  Beauty has as great a Force upon my Senses as it can have upon yours I am near Thirty Years of Age you are not more than Twenty Your Passions are strong mine Brother are far from subsiding I admire I love with as much Force of Nature as you can do My Reason ought to be stronger and 'tis well if my Passion is not so likewise Miss  Rooke  is amiable on many Accounts her Features are regular her Wit sprightly her Deportment genteel and VoiceI had almost said ravishing Her Dress is easy and unaffected and her Manner of Conversation has a Freedom that captivates more Hearts than yours Yet I greatly fear with all these Endowments she will not make the Wife you ought to wish for Her airy Flights and gay Behaviour are pleasing as a Partner in Conversation but will they be equally agreeable in a Partner  for Life  What now charms  you  charms also  others  You are now content with thinking yourself  one  among  many  that admire her and are admitted to  share  the Brilliancy of her Conversation but will a  Share  of her Wit and Humour her Freedom and Gaiety please hereafter as a Wife And tho' she is delightful in Company are you satisfied she will be as agreeable when alone with you or when she has not an Opportunity of shewingaway in a Company that perhaps you may not approve She now sees nobody but whom she chuses to see If she should be a Wife it is more than probable she may dislike Restraints and can you approve of a diffuse Conversation in one you desire to yourself  Think not Brother that I have any interested Motive for this Advice I assure you I have not  I am not your Rival I desire not the Lady you seem too fond of All I mean for I say nothing at present with regard to your own Youth which ought not however to be wholly forgotten as very few prudent Matches are made by young Gentlemen at your Age is to caution you against thinking of a Gentlewoman who  may  and I am willing to believe  will  be a suitable Companion to a Gentleman whose Station and Choice leads him into much Company and gay Life but to Men whose Circumstances if not their Inclinations require a more retired way of Life it is obvious a Woman whose Talents lie principally in Conversation can never for that Reason  only  justify a young Gentleman for chusing her for a Wife  I hope this will come time enough to put you upon guarding against the Inconveniencies that threaten the Indulgence of your present Passion Shut not your Ears to Reason forget not yourself and be sure to remember that the Pleasure of an  Hour or Two  and of Twenty Thirty or Forty Years or a  whole Life  must arise from very different Sources I am  Dear Brother  Your most affectionate  c  LETTER X An elder to an extravagant younger Brother  Dear  JOHN  YOU may be certain that your Misfortunes are to me a most melancholy Subject You are my only Brother I own it And your Misfortunes  affect me next to my own But there is this Difference in what I feel for you and for myself I am sure every Misfortune I have met with has been occasioned by unavoidable Accidents This Consideration has supported me under the many Afflictions I have myself endured But for those I have shared with you I cannot boast the same Alleviation While our Father lived he was your constant and unwearied Support even after your Patrimony was squander'd away While our Mother remained she was every Week assisting your Necessities but what might more properly be called your Levity and Extravagance She is now by the Divine Will taken from us both her Jointure as well as the Estate my Father independently left has devolved upon me Of this both Nature and Providence require I should make the best Use And to serve you I readily confess is my greatest Care But my dear Brother how is this to be done The generous and bountiful Assistance of our Parents procured you no substantial Good What then am I to do to screen you from Want and MiseryThat you are not already happy is not owing to the Backwardness of your Friends to serve you but allow me to speak plainly to your own Indiscretion Your own Fortune maintained you not for three Years Were I able to give you as much more what Reason have you given me to suppose you will be a better Oeconomist than you have been My whole Estate let me tell you Brother at your Rate of Expence would scarcely maintain you for Seven Years And think you as you will I must believe it my Duty to leave enough to support my Offspring with prudent Conduct to the End of Time If I send you as you desire Fifty Guineas What good will  that Sum procure you It will but serve to lengthen your Credit and make you run deeper into Debt I have assisted you before and has not this always been the Case And have not People given you Credit because they think I will support you 'Tis Time then my dear Brother to hold my Hand But yet be assured that when I am co  +vinced you have thoroughly abandon'd your prese  Courses you shall find in me  A truly affectionate Brother  LETTER XI To a young Man too soon keeping a Horse  Dear  Tom  I Always take great Pleasure in hearing of your Welfare and of every thing that makes for your Satisfaction and Comfort But give me Leave to say That I am sorry to hear you have so early begun to keep a Horse especially as your Business is altogether in your Shop and you have no End to serve in riding out and are besides young and healthy and so cannot require it as Exercise And is it worth while think you to keep a Horse the whole Week that you may have him at hand on a  Sunday  Morning if the Day proves fair and you have nothing to keep you in Town  You must consider that tho' here in the Country many common Tradesmen keep Horses the Expence is but small to them and the Distance of one Customer from another in a manner obliges them to it But this can be no Plea for you And if you do not want a Horse  for Exercise you can only alledge the worst Reason in the World for your maintaining one that your Neighbours all round you do the same For look who they are and what their Motives and you'll soon see the Difference and that their Example will not justify you Mr  Thompson  for Instance who lives next Door to you is near Sixty Years of Age of a pretty gross Constitution and capable of no other Exercise and moreover he had acquired by Length of Time and Industry an ample Fortune before he gave himself this Diversion Mr  Jenkins  has an Estate fallen to him that sets him above the Want of Trade and his continuing in it is rather an Amusement than an Employment Mr  Jackson  Mr  West  Mr  Trozier  and Mr  Kent  are all Men of established Fortunes and when you are as old as the  youngest  of them and can as well afford it I would be far from dissuading you from keeping a Horse But at present you may depend upon it you rather incur their Contempt than gain their Esteem by offering to appear their Equal when they and you well know in what relates to Expences you ought not to be so nor have you had a Time for it The lower Part of the World may perhaps shew you more Respect for those Marks of Substance but should a Time come and who is exempt from Misfortunes when they must know they were the Effects of unthinking Levity how despicable must you then appear in their Eyes And let me tell you that the Esteem of Persons of Credit and Understanding must be gained by very different Means from Shew or Equipage for with these Modesty Prudence and good Sense only will ever prevail  Besides the Expence of the Horse is not the least thing to be considered It will in time very probably lead you into a more dangerous one that of bestowing too much of your Time in the Use of it It will unhinge your Mind as I may say from Business and give your Servants Opportunity to be remiss in your Absence And as you are a young Man it is fit that you should lay up by your Industry against a more advanced Age when the Exercise a Horse affords will seem not only more suitable but perhaps absolutely necessary to your Health whereas now it may rather pass for Wantonness and Affectation  You are not without a tolerable Share of Reason let me prevail with you to use it Sell your Horse and fear not being laugh'd at on that Account for it will be a Credit to you more Ways than one to say That your Business would not allow you Time to use it And it would argue besides great Perverseness to continue in an Error for no other Reason than to support a wrong Judgment at first setting out And your reducing an unnecessary Expence in good time will more than recover any good Opinion you may have lost by running into it  Your prudent Use of this Advice will as it must tend to your Good be a great Satisfaction to  Your tenderly affectionate Father  LETTER XII Against a sudden Intimacy or Friendship with one of a short Acquaintance  Cousin  Tom  I AM just setting out for  Windsor  and have not time to say so much as I would on the Occasion upon which I now write to you I hear that Mr  Douglas  and you have lately contracted such an Intimacy that you are hardly ever asunder and as I know his Morals are not the best nor his Circumstances the most happy I fear he will if he has not already done it let you see that he better knows what he does in seeking  your  Acquaintance than you do in cultivating  his  I am far from desiring to abridge you in any necessary or innocent Liberty or to prescribe too much to your Choice of a Friend Nor am I against your being complaisant to  Sirangers  for this Gentleman's Acquaintance is not yet a Month old with you but you must not think every Man whose Conversation is agreeable fit to be immediately treated as a Friend Of all Sorts hastilycontracted Friendships promise the least Duration or Satisfaction as they most commonly arise from Design on one Side and Weakness on the other  True Friendship  must be the Effect of long and mutual Esteem and Knowledge It ought to have for its Cement an Equality of Years a Similitude of Manners and pretty much a Parity in Circumstance and Degree But generally speaking an Openness to a Stranger carries with it strong Marks of Indiscretion and not seldom ends in Repentance  For these Reasons I would be glad you would be upon your Guard and proceed cautiously in this new Alliance Mr  Douglas  has Vivacity and Humour enough to please any Man of a light Turn but where I to give my Judgment of him I should pronounce him fitter for the Teatable than the Cabinet He is smart but very superficial and treats all serious Subjects with a Contempt too natural to bad Minds and I know more young Men than one of whose good Opinion he has taken Advantage and has made them wiser though at their own Expence than he found them  The Caution I here give you is the pure Effect of my Experience in Life some Knowledge of your new Associate and my Affection for you The Use you make of it will determine whether you merit this Concern from  Your affectionate Kinsman  LETTER XIII A young Man in Business to a Father desiring Leave to address his Daughter  SIR  I HOPE the Justness of my Intentions will excuse the Freedom of these few Lines whereby I am to acquaint you of the great Affection and Esteem I have for your Daughter I would not Sir offer at any indirect Address that should have the least Appearance of Inconsistency with her Duty to you and my honourable Views to her chusing by your Influence if I may approve myself to you worthy of that Honour to  commend myself to her Approbation You are not insensible Sir by the Credit I have hitherto preserved in the World of my Ability by God's Blessing to make her happy And this the rather imboldens me to request the Favour of an Evening's Conversation with you at your first Convenience when I will more fully explain myself as I earnestly hope to your Satisfaction and take my Encouragement or Discouragement from your own Mouth I am Sir mean time with great Respect  Your most obedient humble Servant  LETTER XIV To the Daughter on the Father's Allowance apprising her of his intended Visit  MADAM  I HAVE ventured to make known to your honoured Father the great Desire I have to be thought worthy of a Relation to him by your Means And as he has not discouraged me in the Hopes I have entertained that I may possibly be not unacceptable to him and to all your worthy Family I propose to do myself the Honour of a Visit to you next  Monday  Tho' he has been so good as to promise to introduce me and I make no doubt has acquainted you with it I give you nevertheless the Trouble of these Lines that I might not appear wanting in any outward Demonstration of that inviolable Respect with which I am dear Madam  Your most devoted humble Servant  LETTER XV From a young Lady to her Father acquainting him with a Proposal of Marriage made to her  Nottingham  April    Honoured Sir  I THINK it my Duty to acquaint you that a Gentleman of this Town by Name  Derham  and by Business a Linendraper has made some Overtures to my Cousin  Morgan  in the way of Courtship to me My Cousin has brought him once or twice into my Company which he could not well decline doing because he has Dealings with him and has an high Opinion of him and his Circumstances He has been set up Three Years and has very good Business and lives in Credit and Fashion He is about Twentyseven Years old and a likely Man enough He seems not to want Sense or Manners and is come of a good Family He has broke his Mind to me and boasts how well he can maintain me But I assure you Sir I have given him no Encouragement and told him that I had no Thoughts of changing my Condition yet a while and should never think of it but in Obedience to my Parents and I desired him to talk no more on that Subject to me Yet he resolves to persevere and pretends extraordinary Affection and Esteem I would not Sir by any means omit to acquaint you with the  Beginnings  of an Affair that would be want of Duty in me to conceal from you and shew a Guilt and Disobedience unworthy of the kind Indulgence and Affection you have always shewn to Sir  Your most dutiful Daughter  My humble Duty to my honour'd Mother Love to my Brother and Sister and Respects to all Friends Cousin  Morgan  and his Wife and Sister desire their kind Respects I cannot speak enough of their Civility to me  LETTER XVI The Father's Answer on a Supposition that he approves not of the young Man's Addresses  Northampton  Apr    Dear Polly  I HAVE received your Letter dated the th Instant wherein you acquaint me of the Proposals made to you thro' your Cousin  Morgan  's Recommendation by one Mr  Derham  I hope as you assure me that you have given no Encouragement to him For I by no means approve of him for your Husband I have inquired of one of his Townsmen who knows him and his Circumstances very well and I am neither pleased with them nor with his Character and wonder my Cousin would so inconsiderately recommend him to you Indeed I doubt not Mr  Morgan  's good Intentions but I insist upon it that you think nothing of the Matter if you would oblige  Your indulgent Father  Your Mother gives her Blessing to you and joins with me in the above Advice Your Brother and Sister and all Friends send their Love and Respects to you  LETTER XVII The Father's Answer on a Supposition that he does not disapprove of the young Man's Addresses  Northampt  Apr    My dear Daughter  IN Answer to yours of the th Instant relating to the Addresses of Mr  Derham  I would have you neither wholly encourage nor discourage his Suit for if on Inquiry into his Character and Circumstances I shall find that they are answerable to your Cousin's good Opinion of them and his own Assurances I know not but his Suit may be worthy of Attention But my Dear consider that Men are deceitful and always put the best Side outwards and it may possibly on the strict Inquiry which the Nature and Importance of the Case demands come out far otherwise than it at present appears Let me advise you therefore to act in this Matter with great Prudence and that you make not yourself too cheap for Men are apt to slight what is too easily obtained Your Cousin will give him Hope enough while you don't absolutely deny him and in the mean time he may be told that you are not at your own Disposal but intirely resolved to abide by my Determination and Direction in an Affair of this great Importance And this will put him upon applying to me who you need not doubt will in this Case as in all others study your Good as becomes  Your indulgent Father  Your Mother gives her Blessing to you and joins with me in the above Advice Your Brother and Sister and all Friends send their Love and Respects to you  LETTER XVIII The young Gentleman's Letter to the Father apprising him of his Affection for his Daughter  Northampton  April    Sir  I TAKE the Liberty tho' personally unknown to you to declare the great Value and Affection I have for your worthy Daughter whom I have had the Honour to see at my good Friend Mr  Morgan  's I should think myself intirely unworthy of  her  Favour and of  your  Approbation if I could have a Thought of influencing her Resolution but in Obedience to your Pleasure as I should on such a Supposition offer an Injury likewise to that Prudence in  herself  which I flatter myself is not the least of her amiable Perfections If I might have the Honour of your Countenance Sir on this Occasion I would open myself and Circumstances to you in that frank and honest manner which should convince you of the Sincerity of my Affection for your Daughter and at the same time of the Honourableness of my Intentions In the mean time I will in general say That I have been set up in my Business in the Linendrapery way upwards of Three Years that I have a very good Trade for the Time That I had  l  to begin with which I have improved to  l  as I am ready to make appear to your Satisfaction That I am descended of a creditable Family have done nothing to stain my Character and that my Trade is still further improveable as I shall I hope inlarge my Bottom This Sir I thought but honest and fair to acquaint you with  that you might know something of a Person who sues to you for your Countenance and that of your good Lady in an Affair that I hope may prove one Day the greatest Happiness of my Life as it  must  be if I can be blessed with that and your dear Daughter's Approbation In Hope of which and the Favour of a Line I take the Liberty to subscribe myself Good Sir  Your most obedient humble Servant  LETTER XIX From the Cousin to the Father and Mother in Commendation of the young Gentleman  Northampton  Apr    Dear Cousins  I GIVE you both Thanks for so long continuing with us the Pleasure of Cousin  Polly  's Company She has intirely captivated a worthy Friend of mine Mr  Derham  a Linendraper of this Town And I would have acquainted you with it myself but that I knew and advised Cousin  Polly  to write to you about it for I would not for the world any thing of this sort should be carried on unknown to you at my House especially Mr  Derham  has shewn me his Letter to you and I believe every Tittle of it to be true and really if you and my Cousin approve it as also Cousin  Polly  I don't know where she can do better I am sure I should think so if I had a Daughter he could love  Thus much I thought myself obliged to say and with my kind Love to your other Self and all my Cousins as also my  Wife  's and  Sister  's I remain  Your affectionate Cousin  LETTER XX From the Father in Answer to the young Gentleman  Nottingham  April    Sir  I HAVE received yours of the th and am obliged to you for the good Opinion you express of my Daughter But I think she is yet full young to alter her Condition and imbark in the Cares of a Family I cannot but say that the Account you give of yourself and your Application to  me  rather than first to try to engage the Affections of my Daughter carry a very honourable Appearance and such as must be to the Advantage of your Character As to your Beginning Sir that is not to be so much looked upon as the  Improvement  and I doubt not that you can make good Proof of what you assert on this Occasion But still I must needs say that I think and so does her Mother that it is too early to incumber her with the Cares of the World and as I am sure she will do nothing in so important an Affair without our Advice so I would not for the world in a Case so nearly concerning her and her future Welfare constrain her in the least I intend shortly to send for her home for she has been longer absent from us than we intended and then I shall consult her Inclinations and you will excuse me to say for she is my Daughter and a very good Child tho' I say it that I shall then determine myself by that and by what shall appear to offer most for her Good In the mean time Sir I thank you for the Civility and commendable Openness of yours and am  Your humble Servant  The Father in this Letter referring pretty much to the Daughter's Choice the young Gentleman cannot but construe it as an Encouragement to him to prosecute his Addresses to  her  in which he doubles his Diligence on the Hint that she will soon return to  Nottingham  in order to gain a Footing in her good Will and she finding her Father and Mother not averse to the Affair ventures to give him some room to think his Addresses not indifferent to her but still altogether on Condition of her Parents Consent and Approbation By the Time then that she is recalled home nothing disagreeable having appeared in the young Gentleman's Behaviour and his general Character being consistent with his Pretensions there may be supposed some Degree of Familiarity and Confidence to have pass'd between them and she gives him Hope that she will receive a Letter from him tho' she will not promise an Answer intirely referring to her Duty to her Parents and their good Pleasure He attends her on her Journey a good Part of the way as far as she will permit and when her Cousin his Friend informs him of her safe Arrival at  Nottingham  he sends the following Letter  LETTER XXI From the young Gentleman to his Mistress on her Arrival at her Father's  May    Dear Madam  I HAVE understood with great Pleasure your safe Arrival at your Father's House of which I take the Liberty to congratulate your good Parents as well as your dear Self I will not Madam fill this Letter with the Regret I had to part with you because I have no Reason nor Merit at present to expect that you should be concerned for me on this Score Yet Madam I am not without Hope from the Sincerity of my Affection for you and the Honesty of my Intentions to deserve in time those Regards which I cannot at present flatter myself with As your good Father in his kind Letter to me assured me that he should consult your Inclinations and determine by them and by what should offer most for your Good how happy should I be if I could find my humble Suit not quite indifferent to your dear Self and not rejected by Him If what I have already opened to him as to my Circumstances be not unacceptable I should humbly hope for Leave to pay you and him a Visit at  Nottingham  or if this be too great a Favour till he has made further Enquiry that he would be pleased to give himself that Trouble and put it in my Power as soon as possible to convince him of the Truth of my Allegations upon which I desire to stand or fall in my Hopes of your Favour and his For I think far different from many in the World that a Deception in an Affair of this weighty Nature should be less forgiven than in any other Since then dearest Madam I build  my Hopes more on the Truth of my Affection for you and the Honour of my Intentions than any other Merit or Pretensions I hope you will condescend if not to become an Advocate for me which would be too great a Presumption to expect yet to let your good Parents know that you have no Aversion to the Person or Address of dearest Madam  Your for everobliged and affectionate humble Servant  My best Respects attend your good Father and Mother and whole Family  As this puts the Matter into such a Train as may render more Writing unnecessary the next Steps to be taken being the Inquiry into the Truth of the young Man's Assertions and a Confirmation of his Character and then the Proposals on the Father's Part of what he will give with his Daughter all which may be done best by word of Mouth or Interposition of Friends so we shall have no Occasion to pursue this Instance of Courtship further  LETTER XXII From a Brother to his Sister in the Country upbraiding her for being negligent in Writing  My dear Sister  I WRITE to you to acquaint you how unkindly we all take it here that you do not write oftener to us in relation to your Health Diversions and Employment in the Country  You cannot be insensible how much you are beloved by us all judge then if you do right to omit giving us the only Satisfaction Absence affords to true Friends which is often to hear from one another My Mother is highly disobliged with you and says you are a very idle Girl my Aunt is of the same Opinion and I would fain like a loving Brother excuse you if I could Pray for the future take Care to deserve a better Character and by writing soon and often put it in my Power to say what a good Sister I have For you shall always find me  Your most affectionate Brother  Due Respects of every one here to my Aunt and all Friends in the Country  LETTER XXIII In Answer to the preceding  Dear Brother  MOST kindly and too justly do you upbraid me I own my Fault and never will be guilty of the like again I write to beg my Mother's Pardon and that she will procure for me that of my good Aunt on Promise of Amendment Continue my dear Brother to be an Advocate for me in all my unintended Imperfections and I will never err voluntarily for the future That so I may be as worthy as possible of your kind Constructions and shew myself what I truly am and ever will be  Your most affectionate and obliged Sister  LETTER XXIV From the Daughter to her Mother in Excuse for her Neglect  Honoured Madam  I AM ashamed I staid to be reminded of my Duty by my Brother's kind Letter I will offer no Excuse for myself for not writing oftener tho' I have been strangely taken up by the Kindness and Favour of your good Friends here particularly my Aunt  Windus  For well do I know that my Duty to my honoured Mother ought to take place of all other Considerations All I beg therefore is that you will be so good to forgive me on Promise of Amendment and to procure Forgiveness also of my Aunt  Talbot

humble Servant  LETTER XXXVI A Father to a Son to dissuade him from the Vice of Drinking to Excess  My dear Son  IT is with a Grief proportioned to my Love which is extreme that I understand you have of late neglected your Studies and given yourself up to the odious Vice of Drinking What shall I say what shall I do to engage you to quit this pernicious Practice before it becomes such a Habit that it will be impossible or at least very difficult for you to cast it off Let me require let me intreat you to give a suitable Attention to what I have to say on this Head which I shall offer rather as a warm Friend than an angry Father and as I address myself to your Reason I will leave it to yourself to judge of the Truth of the Observations I have to make to you  In the first place with respect to  Health  the greatest Jewel of this Life it is the most destructive of all Vices  Asthma's Vertigoes Palsies Apoplexies  Gouts Colicks Fevers Dropsies Consumptions Stone  and  Hypochondriack Diseases  are naturally introduced by excessive Drinking  All the rest of the Vices together are not so often punished with sudden Death as this one What fatal Accidents what Quarrels what Breaches between Friend and Friend are owing to it  Then in the second Place How does it deface Reason destroy all the tender Impulses of Nature make a wise Man a Fool and subject Persons of the brightest Parts to the Contempt of the weakest and even in time extinguish those shining Qualities which constitute the Difference between a Man of Sense and a Blockhead For as a certain very eminent Author well observes Fools having generally stronger Nerves and less volatile Spirits than Men of fine Understandings that which will rouse the one will make the other either stupid or frantick and tho' it sometimes whi  the Fit continues strengthens the Imagination yet it always depresses the Judgment and after the Fit is over both those Faculties languish together till in time it quenches the Imagination impairs the Memory and drowns the Judgment  Most other Vices are compatible as the same Author observes with several Virtues but Drunkenness runs counter to all the Duties of Life A great Drinker can hardly be either a good Husband a good Father a good Son a good Brother or a good Friend It lays him open to the worst Com+pany and this Company frequently subjects him to lewd Women Gaming Quarrels Riots and often Murders All other Vices even the greatest of Vices as Ambition Unchastity Bigotry Avarice Hypocrisy detest this unnatural and worse than beastly Vice for the Beasts themselves  even the uncleanest of them know nothing of it much less practise it  Other Vices indeed make Men  worse  says this judicious Author but this  alters  Men from  themselves  to that degree that they differ not more from their  present Companions  than from their  former Selves  A Habitude of it will make the Prudent inconsiderate the Ambitious indolent the Active idle and the Industrious slothful so that their Affairs are ruin'd for want of Application or by being intrusted in the Hands of those who turn them wholly to their own Advantage and in the End to the Ruin of those who employ them  I have written a long Letter already Yet have I still more to say which that I may not tire you I will leave to another Letter which the next Post shall bring you And I am mean time in hopes  this  will not lose its proper Effect  Your most indulgent Father  LETTER XXXVII The same Subject pursued  My dear Son  BY my former you will see that hard Drinking is a Vice that breaks a Man's Rest impairs the Understanding extinguishes the Memory inflames the Passions debauches the Will lays the Foundation of the worst and most dangerous Distempers incapacitates a Person from pursuing his Studies and from applying to the Duties of his Calling be it what it will begets Contempt from the World and even if a Man's Circumstances were above feeling the Expence which can hardly be alters  and changes the Practiser of it from himself and if he is  not  above feeling it often reduces him to Want and Beggary And if he has a Family his Children who by their Father's Industry and Sobriety might have made a creditable Figure in Life are left to the Mercy of the World become the Outcasts of the Earth possibly Footsoldiers Liveryservants Shoecleaners Linkboys and perhaps Pickpockets Highwaymen or Foot+pads and instead of a comfortable Livelihood and a Station above Contempt are intitled only to Shame Misery and the Gallows  And do  you  judge my Son how a Man can answer this Conduct to God to his Parents and other Relations to his Wife to his Children to himself and persist in a barbarous and an unnatural Vice which makes himself not only miserable and contemptible but transmits the Mischief to his unhappy and innocent Children if he has any  Add to all this That it is a Vice a Man cannot easily master and subdue or which like some others may be cured by  Age  but it is a Vice that feeds and nourishes itself by Practice and grows upon a Man as he lives longer in the World till at last if it cuts him not off in the Flower of his Days his Body expects and requires Liquor And so tho' a Man when he enters upon it may be single yet if he ever should marry it may he attended with all the frightful and deplorable Consequences I have mentioned and ruin besides an innocent and perhaps prudent Woman rendering her without  her own  Fault the joint unhappy Cause of adding to the Number of the miserable and profligate Children with which the World too much abounds and which is owing to nothing so much as this detestable Sin in the Parents  Consider all these things my dear Son and before it be too late get the better of a Vice that you will find difficult to subdue when it is grown to a Head and which will otherwise creep upon you every Day more and more till it shuts up your Life in Misery as to yourself and Contempt as to the World and instead of giving Cause even to your nearest and best Friends to remember you with Pleasure will make it a Kindness in them to forget they ever had in the World if a  Parent  such a  Son  if a  Tutor  such a  Pupil  if a  Brother  or  Sister  such an unhappy  near Relation  if a  Wife  such a  Husband  if a  Child  such a  Father  and if a  Friend  such a  wretched one  that cannot be thought of without Pity and Regret for having shortened his Days and ruin'd his Affairs by so pernicious a Habit  What a Joy on the contrary will that noblest of Conquests over  yourself  yield to all those dear Relations And in particular what Pleasure will you give to the aged Heart and declining Days of my dear Child  Your indulgent and most affectionate Father  LETTER XXXVIII From an Apprentice to his Master begging Forgiveness for a great Misdemeanor  Good Sir  I AM so asham'd of myself for the last Occasion I have given you to be angry with me after my repeated Promises of Amendment that I have not the Courage to speak to you I therefore take this Method of begging you to forgive what is  past and let this Letter testify against me if ever I wilfully or knowingly offend again for the future You have Children of your own They may possibly offend tho' I hope they never will as I have done Yet Sir would you not wish they might meet with Pardon if they should rather than ReprobationMy Making or my Ruin I am sensible lies in your Breast If you will not forgive me sad will be the Consequence to me I doubt If you do you may save a Soul as well as a Body from Misery and I hope Sir you will weigh this with your usual Goodness and Consideration What is past I cannot help but for what is to come I do promise if God gives me Health and Power that my Actions shall testify for me how much I am good Sir  Your repentant and obliged Servant  LETTER XXXIX The Master's Answer  John  YOUR Letter has affected me so much that I am willing once more to pass over all you have done Surely I may at last depend on these your solemn Assurances and as I hope deep Contrition If not be it as you say and let your Letter testify against you for your ingrateful Baseness and for me in my Readiness which however shall be the last time to forgive one that has been so much used to promise and so little to perform But I hope for better because I yet wish you well being as you use me  Yours or otherwise  LETTER XL From an Apprentice to his Friends in Praise of his Master and Family  Honoured Sir  I Know it will be a great Satisfaction to you and my dear Mother to hear that I go on very happily in my Business and my Master seeing my Diligence puts me forward and encourages me in such a manner that I have great Delight in it and hope I shall answer in time your good Wishes and Expectations and the Indulgence which you have always shewn me There is such good Order in the Family as well on my Mistress's Part as my Master's that every Servant as well as I knows their Duty and does it with Pleasure So much Evenness Sedateness and Regularity is observed in all they injoin and expect that it is impossible but it should be so My Master is an honest worthy Man every body speaks well of him My Mistress is a chearful sweettemper'd Woman and rather heals Breaches than widens them And the Children after such Examples behave to us all like one's own Brothers and Sisters Who can but love such a Family I wish when it shall please God to put me in such a Station that I may carry myself just as my Master does and if I should ever marry have just such a Wife as my Mistress And then by God's Blessing I shall be as happy as they are and as you Sir and my dear Mother have always been If any thing can make me still happier than I am or continue to  my present Felicity it will be the Continuance  of yours and my good Mother's Prayers for honour'd Sir and Madam  Your ever dutiful Son  LETTER XLI Another from an Apprentice where the Master is too remiss in his own Affairs  Honoured Sir and Madam  YOU desire to know how I go on in my Business I must needs say Very well in the main for my Master leaves every thing in a manner to me I wish he did not for his own sake For tho' I hope he will never suffer on the Account of any wilful Remissness or Negligence much less want of Fidelity in me yet his Affairs do not go on so well as if he was more in them and less at the Tavern But it becomes not me to reflect upon my Master especially as what I may write or say on this Head will rather expose his Failings than do him Service for as it must be his Equals that should reprove him so all a Servant can observe to others will do more Harm than Good to him One Thing is at  present  in my own Power and that is to double my Diligence that his Family suffer as little as possible by his Remissness And another I hope by God's Grace  will  be and that is to avoid in myself when my Time comes those Failings which I see so blameable in him And as this will be benefiting properly by the Example for that Bee must be worse than a Drone that cannot draw Honey from a bitter as well as a sweet Flower so it will give you the Pleasure of knowing  your good Instructions are not thrown away upon me and that I am and ever will be  Your dutiful Son  LETTER XLII To a Country Correspondent modestly requesting a Balance of Accounts between them  SIR  I Find myself constrained by a present Exigence to beg you to balance the Account between us Tho' Matters have run into some Length yet would I not have apply'd to you had I known so well how to answer my pressing Occasions any other way If it suits you not to pay the Whole I beg Sir you will remit me as much towards it as you can without Prejudice to your other Affairs and it will extremely oblige  Your most humble Servant  LETTER XLIII In Answer to the preceding  SIR  I AM very glad I have it in my Power to send you now directly One hundred Pounds on Account between us which I do by our Carrier who will pay you in Specie I will soon remit you the Balance of your whole Demand and am only sorry that I gave Occasion for this Application for what is so justly your Due When I send you the rest which will be in a few Days if I  am not greatly disappointed I will accompany it with an Order which will begin a new Debt but which I hope to be more punctual in discharging than I have been in the last I am very sincerely  Your Friend and Servant  LETTER XLIV A more pressing and angry Letter from a City Dealer on the same Account  Mr  Barret  I AM sorry your ill Usage constrains me to write to you in the most pressing manner Can you think it is possible to carry on Business after the manner you act by me You know what Promises you have made me and how from time to time you have broke them And can I depend upon any new ones you make If you use  others  as you do me how can you think of carrying on Business If you do  not  what must I think of a Man who deals worse with me than he does with any body elseIf you think you may trespass more upon  me  than you can on  others  this is a very bad Compliment to my  Prudence  or your own  Gratitude  For surely good Usage should be intitled to good Usage I know how to allow for Disappointments as well as any Man but can a Man be disappointed for ever Trade is so dependent a thing you know that it cannot be carried on without mutual Punctuality Does not the Merchant expect it from me for those very Goods I send you And can I make a Return to him without receiving it from you What End can it answer to give you Two Years Credit and then be at an Uncertainty for Goods which I sell at a small Profit and have  not Six Months Credit for myself Indeed Sir this will never do I must be more punctually used by you or else must deal as little punctually with others and what then must be the ConsequenceIn short Sir I expect a handsome Payment by the next Return and Security for the Remainder and shall be very loth to take any harsh Methods to procure this Justice to myself my Family and my own Creditors For I am if it be not your own Fault  Your faithful Friend and Servant  LETTER XLV In Answer to the preceding  SIR  I MUST acknowledge I have not used you well and can give no better Answer to your just Expostulations than to send you the inclosed Draught for  l  which you will be pleased to carry to my Credit and to assure you of more punctual Treatment for the future Your Letter is no bad Lesson to me I have conn'd it often and hope I shall improve by it I am ready to give you my Bond for the Remainder which I will keep paying every Month something till 'tis all discharged and what I write to you for in the Interim shall be paid for on Receipt of the Goods This I hope Sir will satisfy you for the present If I could do better I would but shall be streighten'd to do this But I think in Return for your Patience I cannot do less to convince you that I am now at last in Earnest I beg you'll continue to me the same good Usage and Service I have met with from you hitherto And that you'll believe me to be unfeignedly  Your obliged humble Servant  LETTER XLVI To a young Trader generally in a Hurry in Business advising  Method  as well as  Diligence  Dear Nephew  THE Affection I have always borne you as well for your own sake as for your late Father's and Mother's makes me give you the Trouble of these Lines which I hope you will receive as kindly as I intend them  I have lately call'd upon you several times and have as often found you in an extraordinary Hurry which I well know cannot be sometimes avoided but methinks need not be always the Case if your Time were disposed in regular and proper Proportions to your Business I have frequently had Reason to believe that more than half the Flutter which appears among Traders in general is rather the Effect of their  Indolence  than their  Industry  however willing they are to have it thought otherwise and I will give you one Instance in Confirmation of this Opinion in a Neighbour of mine  This Gentleman carried on for some Years a profitable Business but indulging himself every Evening in a Tavern Society or Club which the Promotion of Business as is usually the Case gave the first Pretence for he looked upon those Engagements as the natural Consequence of the Approach of Night and drove on his Business in the Day with Precipitation that he might get thither with the earliest He seldom kept very late Hours tho' he never came home soon The Night being gone and his Bottle empty'd the Morning was always wanted to dispel the Fumes of the Wine  Whoever therefore came to him before Nine was desired to call again and when he rose so many Matters waited for him as directly threw him into a Flutter so that from his Rising till Dinnertime he seem'd in one continued Forment A long Dinnertime he always allowed himself in order to recover the Fatigues he had undergone and all his Tabletalk was How heavy his Business lay upon him And what Pains he took in it The hearty Meal and the Time he indulged himself at Table begot an Inappetency for any more Business for that short Afternoon so all that  could  be deferr'd was put off to the next Morning and long'dfor Evening approaching he flies to his usual Solace Empties his Bottle by Eleven Comes home Gets to Bed and is invisible till next Morning at Nine and then rising enters upon his usual Hurry and Confusion  Thus did his Life seem to those who saw him in his Business one constant Scene of Fatigue tho' he scarce ever apply'd to it Four regular Hours in any one Day Whereas had he risen  only  at Seven in the Morning he would have got all his Business under by Noon and those Two Hours from Seven to Nine being before many People go abroad he would have met with no Interruption in his Affairs but might have improved his Servants by his own Example directed them in the Business of the Day have inspected his Books written to his Dealers and put every thing in so regular a Train for the rest of the Day that whatever had occurr'd afterwards would rather have served to divert than fatigue him  And what to cut my Story short was the Upshot of the Matter Why meeting with some Disappointments and Losses as all Traders must expect and ought to provide for and his Customers  not seeing him in his Shop so much as they expected and when there always in a disobliging petulant Hurry and moreover Mistakes frequently happening through the Flurry into which he put himself and every one about him by these means his Business dwindled away insensibly and not being able to go out of his usual Course which helped to impair both his Capacity and Ardor to Business his Creditors began to look about them and he was compelled to enter into the State of his Affairs and then had the Mortification to find the Balance of  l  against him  This was a shocking Case to himself but more to his Family for his Wife had lived and his Children had been educated in such a manner as induced them to hope their Fortunes would be sufficient to place them in a State of Independence  In short being obliged to quit a Business he had managed with so little Prudence his Friends got him upon a charitable Foundation which afforded him bare Subsistence for himself His Children were dispersed some one way and some another into low Scenes of Life and his Wife went home to her Friends to be snubb'd and reflected on by her own Family for Faults not her own  This Example will afford several good Hints to a young Tradesman which are too obvious to need expatiating upon And as I dare say your Prudence will keep you from the like Fault you will never have Reason to reproach yourself on this Score But yet as I always found you in a Hurry when I called upon you I could not but give you this Hint for fear you should not rightly proportion your Time to your Business and lest you should suspend to the  next  Hour what you could and ought to do in the  present  and so did not keep your Business properly under Method is  every thing in Business next to Diligence And you will by falling into a regular one always be calm and unruffled and have time to bestow in your Shop with your Customers the Female ones especially who always love to make a great many Words in their Bargainings and expect to be humour'd and persuaded And how can any Man find Time for this if he prefers the Tavern to his Shop and his Bed to his Business I know you will take in good Part what I have written because you are sensible how much I am  Your truly affectionate  c  LETTER XLVII From a Son reduced by his own Extravagance requesting his Father's Advice on his Intention to turn Player  Honoured Sir  AFTER the many Occasions I have given for your Displeasure permit me to ask your Advice in an Affair which may render my whole Life comfortable or miserable You know Sir to what a low Ebb my Folly and Extravagance have reduced me Your generous Indulgence has made you stretch your Power to my Shame I speak it even beyond the Bounds which Wisdom and a necessary Regard to the rest of your Family would permit therefore I cannot hope for further Assistance from you Something however I must resolve upon to gain a Maintenance And an Accident fell out Yesterday which offers me at least present Bread  Mr  Rich  Master of one of the Theatres happened to dine at my Uncle's when I was there After Dinner the Subject of Discourse was the  Art of a Comedian On which my Uncle took Occasion to mention the little Flights in that way with which I have diverted myself in my gayer Moments and partly compelled me to give an Instance of my Abilities Mr  Rich  was pleased to declare his Approbation of my Manner and Voice and on being told my Circumstances offer'd at once to take me into his Company with an Allowance sufficient for present Subsistence and additional Encouragement as I should be found to deserve it Half a Benefit he promised me the first Season which by my otherwise too numerous Acquaintaince might I believe be turned to pretty good Account I am not fond of this Life but see no other Means of supporting myself like a Gentleman Your speedy Answer will be ever gratefully acknowledged by honoured Sir  Your dutiful tho' unhappy Son  LETTER XLVIII The Father's Answer setting forth the Inconveniencies and Disgrace attending the Profession of a Player  Dear  Gilbert  I SHOULD be glad to have you in any Situation which would afford you a comfortable and reputable Subsistence But cannot think the Life of a Stageplayer proper for that End You must consider that tho' in the gay Trappings of that Employment a Man may represent a Gentleman yet none can be farther from that Character if a perpetual Dependence be the worst Kind of Servility In the first Place the Company you will be in a manner obliged to keep will be such as will tend little to the Improvement of your Mind or  Amendment of your Morals To the Master of the Company you list in you must be obsequious to a Degree of Slavery Not one of an Audience that is able to  hiss  but you must  fear  and each single Person you come to know personally you must oblige on every Occasion that offers to engage their Interest at your Benefit A Thought the most shocking to a free and generous Mind And if to this you add the little Profit that will attend making a low Figure on the Stage and besides the Qualifications necessary the incredible Fatigue attending the Support of a good Figure upon it you will easily see that more Credit more Satisfaction more Ease and more Profit may be got in many other Stations without the mortifying Knowledge of being deem'd a Vagrant by the Laws of your Country I hope this will be enough to dissuade you from farther Thoughts of the Stage And in any other Employment you may yet expect some small Assistance from  Your loving Father  LETTER XLIX To a Brother too captious to bear himself the Ridicule he practises upon others  Dear  Jack  I AM glad to find you improve both in  Thought  and  Speech  You know I am no Witch at either But so as we have some Wit in our Family no matter who is at the Trouble of carrying it for what he'll get by it I suppose you thought to give no small Pleasure to the Company last Night by your facetious Flings at all around you not  excepting the Parson himself But should you not have considered that every one in the Room had a Right to return the Freedom you took in the best manner he was able Was it therefore well in you to resent so warmly as you did a smart Remark made by Mr  Crispe  on a palpable Blunder of your own when you had taken so much Liberty with him as well as every body else just before Indeed Brother you must either lay aside Ridicule or learn to bear it better and in the present Case you should have remember'd that in the manner you began with that Gentleman it was not possible for him to say any thing it would have been your Credit to resent A Retort on these Occasions must be excused tho' fraught with Resentment for a Man is not always in a Humour to be jested with and it is the Duty of him who begins to take what follows Your failing in this known Rule whatever you may think has made you appear in so mean a Light to the whole Company that all your Acuteness will not in haste atone for it  If I judge rightly nothing is more delicate than Ridicule Where it is conducted with Prudence and Humour it is sure to please even the Man who is the Subject of it if he is not of a morose Temper But when instead of that personal Failings or private Indiscretions are exposed for the Entertainment of a Company tho' you may think to raise a Laugh by it in the Unreflecting it will bring upon you the Censure of the Considerate It is our Duty to consult what we can  bear  ourselves as well as what we can  inflict  on others For my own Part I know I cannot bear what is called a  close Rub  as many Men can and for that Reason I never jest with any body unless by way of Reprisal and that I shorten all I can lest my Temper should not hold out  No doubt but you have more Humour than I but if you do not blend in it a Quantity of Temper sufficient to carry it off you will be no Gainer by the Qualification The Philosopher says That to  Bear  and  Forbear  are the highest Points of Wisdom If so where is his Wisdom who will neither do the one or the other You may not like the Freedom I have here taken but I respect you too well to pass over your Foibles without some Observation being  Your truly affectionate Brother  LETTER L To a Friend on his Recovery from a dangerous Illness  Dear Sir  GIVE me Leave to mingle my Joy with that of all your Friends and Relations in the Recovery of your Health and to join with them to bless God for continuing to your numerous Wellwishers the Benefit of your useful and valuable Life May God Almighty long preserve you in Health and prosper all your Undertakings for the Good of your worthy Family and the Pleasure of all your Friends and Acquaintance in the hearty Prayer of Sir  Your faithful Friend and humble Servant  LETTER LI On the same Occasion  Good Sir  I HAVE received with great Delight the good News of your Recovery from the dangerous Illness with which it pleased God to afflict you I  most heartily congratulate you and your good Lady and Family upon it and make it my Prayer That your late Indisposition may be succeeded by such a Renewal of Health and Strength both of Body and Mind as may make your Life equally happy to yourself as it must be to all who have the Pleasure to know you I could not help giving you this Trouble to testify the Joy that affected my Heart on the Occasion and to assure you that I am with the greatest Affection and Respect Sir  Your faithful humble Servant  LETTER LII In Answer to the preceding  Dear Sir  I GIVE you many Thanks for your kind Congratulations My Return of Health will be the greater Pleasure to me if I can contribute in any measure to the Happiness of my many good Friends and particularly to that of you and yours for I assure you Sir that no body can be more than I am  Your obliged humble Servant  LETTER LIII To a young Lady advising her not to change her Guardians nor to encourage any clandestine Address  Dear Miss  THE Friendship which long subsisted between your prudent Mother and me has always made me attend to your Welfare with more than a common  Concern And I could not conceal my Surprize at hearing that you intend to remove the Guardianship of yourself and Fortune from the Gentlemen to whom your tender Parents committed the Direction of both I am afraid my Dear your Dissatisfaction arises more from sudden Distaste than from mature Reflection Mr  Jones  and Mr  Pitt  were long the intimate Friends and Companions of your Father for more than Thirty Years he had experienc'd their Candor and Wisdom and it was their Fitness for the Trust that  duced him to leave you to their Care and will  reflect upon his Judgment  They are not less wise now than when he made his Will and if they happen to differ from your Judgment in any thing of Moment what Room have you to suppose yourself better able to judge of the Consequences of what you desire than they I do not undervalue your good Sense and yet I must tell you that the Difference of Years consider'd and their Knowledge of the World which yet you can know little of it would he strange if they did not know better than you what was proper for you and their Honesty was never yet disputed Upon these Considerations who is most probably to blame should you happen to disagree From such Men you will never meet more Restraints than is necessary for your Happiness and Interest for nothing that can injure  you  in any respect can add to  their  Advantage or Reputation I have known several young Ladies of your Age impatient of the least Controul and think hardly of every little Contradiction but when by any unadvised Step they have released themselves as they call it from the Care of their try'd Friends how often have they had Cause to repent their Rashness How seldom do you hear  those Ladies who have subjected themselves to what some reckon the greatest Restraints while young repent the Effects of them when grown up  To mention the single Article about which generally these Differences arise that of Marriage What good Fruits can a Lady hope from the insidious Progress of a clandestine Address A Man who can be worth a Lady's Acceptance will never be ashamed or afraid to appear openly If he deserves to succeed or is conscious that he does what need of concealing his Designs from her Friends Must it not be with a View to get her in his Power and by securing a Place in her Affections make her Weakness give Strength to  his  Presumption and forward those Pretensions that he knew would otherwise be rejected with Scorn  Let me tell you my dear Miss that you neither want Sense nor Beauty and no young Gentleman can be ashamed of being  known  to love you Consider this well and despise the Man who seeks the Aid of back Doors bribed Servants and Gardenwalls to get Access to your Person If he had not a meaner Opinion of your Understanding than he ought he would not hope for Success from such  poor Methods  Let him see then how much he is mistaken if he thinks you the giddy Girl his clandestine Conduct seems to call you  In time  advise with your try'd Friends Trust no Servant with Secrets you would not have known to your Equals or Guardians and be sure ever to shun a servile Confidant who generally makes her Market of her Mistress and sells her to the highest Bidder  I hope dear Miss you will seriously reflect upon all I have said and excuse the wellmeant Zeal of  Your sincere Friend  LETTER LIV From a Mother to her Daughter jealous of her Husband  Dear  Bet  I AM sorry to find you are grown jealous of your Husband 'Tis a most uneasy Passion and will be fatal not only to your present Quiet but to your future Happiness and probably to that of y  ur Family if you indulge it  Your either  have  or have  not  Cause for it If you have Cause look into yourself and your own Conduct to see if you have not by any Change of Temper or Disagreeableness of Behaviour alienated your Husband's Affections and if so set about amending both in order to recover them for once he loved you and you was satisfy'd he did above all your Sex or you would not have had him If it be owing to his inconstant Temper that is indeed unhappy but then so long as you are clear of Blame you have nothing to reproach  yourself  with And as the Creatures wicked Men follow omit nothing to oblige them you must try to avoid such uneasy and disturbing Resentments as will make you more and more distasteful to him Shew him that no guilty Wretch's  pretended  Love can be equal to your  real  one Shew him that such Creatures shall not outdo you in an  obliging Behaviour  and  Sweetness of Temper  and that let him fly off from  his  Duty if he will you will persevere in  yours  This Conduct will if  not immediately  in  time  flash Conviction in his Face He will see what a Goodness he injures and will be softened by your Softness But if you make his Home uneasy to him he will fly both  that  and  you  And to whom will he fly but most probably to one who will allow his Pleas and aggravate every thing against you who will side with him inflame his Passions and thereby secure him to herself And would  you  contribute to such a Wretch's Power over him and furnish Opportunities for  her  to triumph over you For while you exasperate his Passions and harden his Mind against you she will by wicked Blandishments shew him how obliging  she  can be and so a Course of Life that he would follow privately and by stealth as it were he will more openly pursue he will grow shameless in it and so common is the Vice more's the Pity will find those who will extenuate it for  their own  sakes and throw the Blame on the Violence of your Temper and say you drive him into these Excesses Thus much I write supposing you have  Reason to be jealous  I will write yet another Letter on this important Subject I hope they will have the Weight intended them by  Your ever indulgent Mother  LETTER LV The same Subject continued  Dear  Bet  WHAT I wrote in my former was on a Supposition that you had too much Reason to be uneasy at your Husband's Conduct  I will now pursue the Subject and put the Case that you have no  Proof  that he is guilty but your Surmizes or perhaps the busy  Whisperings  of officious  Makedebates  In this Case take care my  Betsey  that you don't by the Violence of your Passions  precipitate him on the Course you dread and that you alienate not by unjust Suspicions his Affections from you for then perhaps he will be ready  indeed  to place them somewhere else where you may not so easily draw him off for he will may be think as to  you  if he be devoid of  superior  Considerations that he may as well  deserve  your Suspicions as be tiezed with them  without  deserving them  I know it is a most shocking thing to a sober young Woman to think herself obliged to  share  those Affections which ought to be  all her own  with a  vile Prostitute  besides the Danger which is not small of being intirely circumvented in her Husband's  Love  and perhaps have only his  Indifference  if not  Contempt  instead of it But my Dear at the worst comfort yourself that  you  are not the guilty Person for one Day he will perhaps fatally find his Error And consider besides my  Betsey  that your Case from an unfaithful  Husband  is not near so bad as his would be from an unfaithful  Wife  For Child he cannot make the Progeny of a  Bastard Race  succeed to his and your Estate or Chattels in Injury of your  lawful Children  If any such he should have the Law of the Land  brands  them Whereas a  naughty Wife  often makes the Children of  another Man  Heirs of her Husband's Estate and Fortune in Injury of his  own Children  or  Family  So tho' the Crime may be equal in  other Respects  yet this makes the Injury of the Woman to the Man greater than  his  can be to  her  These Thoughts I have thrown together as they occurred in two Letters that I might not tire you with a Length that yet the important Subject required Let me briefly sum up the Contents  If he be  guilty  try by Softness and kind Expostulations to reclaim him before the Vice be rooted in him If it be so rooted as that he cannot be drawn off you know not what God may do for you if you trust in Him and take not upon yourself by giving up your Mind to Violence to be your own Avenger A  sick Bed  a  tender Conduct  in you a  sore Disaster  and who that lives is not liable to such may give him to see the Error  his Ways and shew him the Foulness of his Crime  which your good Usage will aggravate upon  sober Reflection with the no weak Addition  Ingratitude  to so good a Wife The  Wretch  he has chosen for a Partner in his Guilt may by her sordid Ways  awake  him by her libidinous Deportment  satiate  him by her detected Commerce with  others  for such Creatures having once given themselves up to Vice know no Bounds make him abhor her And then he will see the Difference between such a one and a chaste Wife whose  Interests  are bound up in  his own  and will admire you more than ever he did and you'll have the Pleasure besides in all Probability of saving a Soul that stands in so near a Relation to your own  But if your Uneasiness be owing to  private Talebearers  and  busy Intermeddlers  take care my Dear you are not made a Property of by such mischievous People Take care that you make not your own  present Peace  and your  future Good  and that of your  Family  and of  him  your injur'd Husband the Sacrifices to such pernicious Busybodies  Consider my Dear all I have said and God bless you with a Conduct and Discretion suitable to the Occasion before you and at the worst give you Comfort and Patience in  your own  Innocence For such is this transitory Life that all the Ill or Good we receive will be  soon over with us  and  then the  Pu  shment  of the  former  and the  Reward  of the  latter  will make  all Scores even  and what is  past  appear as  nothing  Mean time I can but pray for you As my dear Child becomes  Your ever affectionate Mother  LETTER LVI From a tender Father to an ungracious Son  Son  John  I AM under no small Concern that your continued ill Courses give me Occasion to write this Letter to you I was in hopes that your solemn Promises of Amendment might have been better depended on but I see to my great Mortification that all I have done for you and all I have said to you is thrown away What can I say more than I  have said  Yet  once more  am I desirous to try what the Force of a  Letter  will do with one who has not suffer'd mere  Words  to have any Effect upon him Perhaps this remaining with you if you will now and then seriously peruse it may in some happy Moment give you  Reflection  and by God's Grace bring on your  Repentance  and  Amendment  Consider then I beseech you in time the Evil of your Ways Make  my  Case  your own  and think if  you  were to be Father of such a Son how his Actions would grieve and afflict you But if  my  Comfort has no Weight with you consider my Son how your present Courses must impair in time a good Constitution destroy your Health and most probably shorten your Life Consider that your  Reputation  is wounded I hope not mortally  as yet That you will be ranked among the Profligate and Outcasts of the World that no virtuous Man will keep you Company that every one who has a Regard for his own Credit will shun you and that you will be given up to the Society of the  worst  and  most abandon'd  of Men when you might be improved by the Examples of the  Best  That no Family which values their own Honour and the Welfare of their Child will suffer your Addresses to a Daughter worthy of being sought after for a Wife should you incline to marry and that the worst of that Sex must probably in that Case fall to your Lot which will make you miserable in  this World  when you might be happy  Then as to  another World  beyond this transitory one my Heart trembles for what most probably will be the Consequence to your poor Soul For the human Mind is seldom  at a stay  if you do not grow  better  you will most undoubtedly grow  worse  and you may run into those Sins and Evils that you  now  perhaps think yourself incapable of as  already  you are arrived at a Height of Folly and Wickedness that once you would have thought you could not have been guilty of Don't my dear Son let your poor Mother and me have the Mortification to think that we have been the unhappy Means of giving Life to a Child of Perdition instead of a Child of Glory that  our  beloved Son with all the Pains we have taken to instil good Principles into his Mind in hopes he would one day prove a Credit and Comfort to his Family should instead of answering our longing Wishes when at Age take such contrary Courses as will make us join to wish he had never been born  Consider my dear Son we don't want any thing of  you  but  your own Good  We lived before you were born You have been a great Expence to us  to bring you up to these Years You cannot now live without  us  but we can without  you  We hope God will continue your Life to be still a  further Expence  to us For all we live for is our Childrens Good Let then the  Disinterestedness  of our Plea move you Be but good to  yourself  that is all we require of you Let us but have Reason to hope that when we are  dead  and  gone  you will support our Name with Credit and be no Burden to your poor Sisters nor Disgrace to our Memories Shew us that you are of a  generous  not of a  sordid  Nature and will probably set yourself above future Misfortunes by reclaiming in time and then we shall be happy As God has done his Part by you and given you Talents that every one cannot boast let me beg you to consider only how much more noble it is to be in such a Situation as shall enable you to  confer  Benefits than such an one as shall lay you under the poor Necessity to  receive  them from others and perhaps where they ought to be least expected  I have written a long Letter The Subject is  next my Heart  and will excuse it God give a Blessing to it God give you to see the Error of your Ways before it be too late and before you get such a Habit as you cannot alter if you would Let your poor Mother and Sisters look upon you with  Pleasure  rather than  Apprehension  in case God Almighty should take me away from them  et them think of you as a  Protector  in my stead rather than as an ingrateful  Spoiler  among them and you will then give Comfort to my Life as long as God shall spare it and alleviate instead of aggravate the Pangs of my dying Hour when God shall send it  My dear dear Son I conjure you by all our past Tenderness and Affection for you by our  Hopes and our Fears from Infancy to Manhood to think of all these Things reflect upon the Transitoriness of worldly Enjoyments even when better chosen than yours are Judge of the Pleasures you expect in your  present Course  by the Vanity of the  past  of your  next  Assignations by the aching Head and undelighted Heart which followed the  last  and you will find that no Satisfaction which is not grounded on Virtue and Sobriety can be durable or worthy of a rational Creature  Your good Mother who joins her Tears so often with mine to deplore the sad Prospect your ill Courses give us joins also her Prayers to mine that this my  last Effort  may be attended with Success and that you will not let us intreat in vain  Amen Amen  says  Your indulgent and afflicted Father  LETTER LVII The Son's dutiful Answer  Honoured Sir  I AM greatly affected with the tender and moving Goodness expressed in your indulgent Letter I am exceedingly sorry that all your good Advice before has been so cast away upon me as to render this further Instance of your paternal Affection necessary I am resolved instantly to set about a Reformation and to conform myself intirely to your good Pleasure for the future and I beg Sir the Continuance of yours and my good Mother's Prayers to God to enable me to adhere to my present good Resolutions I have so often promised and so often broken my Word  rather indeed thro' the  Strength  of my  Passions  than a  Design  of Nonperformance that I think I ought now to give you some Proof that I am in earnest and what better can I give than to assure you that I will henceforth break myself from the frothy Companions I used to take too much Delight in and whose lewd Banters and Temptations have so frequently set aside my good Purposes You Sir for the future shall recommend the Company proper for me to keep and I beg you will chalk out for me the Paths in which you would have me tread and as much as possible I will walk in them and when I have convinced you of the Sincerity of my Reformation I hope Sir you and my honoured Mother will restore me to your good Opinions which it shall be my constant Study to deserve I have already broke with  George Negus  who attempted to laugh me out of my good Resolutions And I beg Leave to wait upon you for such a Space of Time as you shall think proper in order to break myself from the rest of my profligate Companions and that I may have the Benefit of your Advice and Direction for my future Conduct God continue long for the Benefit of us all your Life and Health and make me happy in contributing as much to your future Comforts as I have by my past Excesses to your Trouble of Mind is and shall always be the Prayer of Honoured Sir  Your truly penitent and dutiful Son  LETTER LVIII To a Friend on Occasion of his not answering his Letters  Dear Sir  IT is so long since I had the Favour of a Line from you that I am under great Apprehensions in relation to your Health and Welfare I beg you Sir to renew to me the Pleasure you used to give me in your Correspondence for I have written three Letters to you before this to which I have had no Answer and am not conscious of having any way disobliged you If I have I will most willingly ask your Pardon for nobody can be more than I am  Your affectionate and faithful Friend and Servant  LETTER LIX In Answer to the preceding  Dear Sir  YOU have not cannot disoblige me but I have greatly disobliged myself in my own faulty Remissness I cannot account for it as I ought To say I had Business one time Company another was distant from home a third will be but poor Excuses for not answering one of your kind Letters in four long Months I therefore ingenuously take Shame to myself and promise future Amendment And that nothing shall ever while I am able to hold a Pen make me guilty of the like Neglect to a Friend I love so well and  have so much Reason so to do Forgive me then my good my kind my generous Friend and believe me ever  Your highly obliged humble Servant  LETTER LX From a Father to a Son on his Negligence in his Affairs  Dear  Jemmy  YOU cannot imagine what a Concern your Carelessness and indifferent Management of your Affairs give me Remissness is inexcusable in all Men but in none so much as in a Man of Business the Soul of which is Industry Diligence and Punctuality  Let me beg of you to shake off the idle Habits you have contracted quit unprofitable Company and unseasonable Recreations and apply to your Comptinghouse with Diligence It may not be yet too late to retrieve your Affairs Inspect therefore your Gains and cast up what Proportion they bear to your Expences and then see which of the latter you  can  and which you  cannot  contract Consider that when once a Man suffers himself to go backward in the World it must be an uncommon Spirit of Industry that retrieves him and puts him forward again  Reflect I beseech you before it be too late upon the Inconveniencies which an impoverish'd Trader is put to for the Remainder of his Life which too may happen to be the prime Part of it the Indignities he is likely to suffer from those whose Money he has unthinkingly squander'd the  Contempt he will meet with from all not excepting the idle Companions of his Folly the Injustice he does his Family in depriving his Children not only of the Power of raising themselves but of living tolerably and how on the contrary from being born to a creditable Expectation he sinks them into the lowest Class of Mankind and exposes them to the most dangerous Temptations What has not such a Father to answer for and all this for the sake of indulging himself in an idle a careless a thoughtless Habit that cannot afford the least Satisfaction beyond the present Hour if in that and which must be attended with deep Remorse when he comes to reflect Think seriously of these Things and in time resolve on such a Course as may bring Credit to yourself Justice to all you deal with Peace and Pleasure to your own Mind Comfort to your Family and which will give at the same time the highest Satisfaction to  Your careful and loving Father  LETTER LXI The Son's grateful Answer  Honoured Sir  I Return you my sincere Thanks for your seasonable Reproof and Advice I have indeed too much indulged myself in an idle careless Habit and had already begun to feel the evil Consequences of it when I received your Letter in the Insults of a Creditor or two from whom I expected kinder Treatment But indeed they wanted but their own so I could only blame myself who had brought their rough Usage upon me Your Letter came so seasonably upon this that I hope it will  not want the desired Effect and as I thank God it is not yet too late I am resolved to take another Course with myself and my Affairs that I may avoid the ill Consequences you so judiciously forewarn me of and give to my Family and Friends the Pleasure they so well deserve at my Hands and particularly that Satisfaction to so good a Father which is owing to him by  His most dutiful Son  LETTER LXII A young Woman in Town to her Sister in the Country recounting her narrow Escape from a Snare laid for her on her first Arrival by a wicked Procuress  Dear Sister  WE have often by our good Mother been warned against the Dangers that would too probably attend us on coming to  London  tho' I must own her Admonitions had not always the Weight I am now convinced they deserved  I have had a Deliverance from such a Snare as I never could have believed would have been laid for a Person free from all Thought of Ill or been so near succeeding upon one so strongly on her Guard as I imagined myself And thus my dear Sister the Matter happened  Returning on  Tuesday  from seeing my Cousin  Atkins  in  Cheapside  I was overtaken by an elderly Gentlewoman of a sober and creditable Appearance who walked by my Side some little time before she spoke to me and then guessing by my asking the Name of the Street that I was a Stranger to  the Town she very courteously began a Discourse with me and after some other Talk and Questions about my Country and the like desired to know if I did not come to Town with a Design of going into some genteel Place I told her If I could meet with a Place to my Mind to wait upon a single Lady I should be very willing to embrace it She said I look'd like a creditable sober and modest Body and at that very time she knew one of the best Gentlewomen that ever lived who was in great Want of a Maid to attend upon her own Person and that if she liked me and I her it would be a lucky Incident for us both  I expressed myself thankfully and she was so very much in my Interest as to intreat me to go instantly to the Lady lest she should be provided and acquaint her I was recommended by Mrs  Jones  not doubting as she said but on Inquiry my Character would answer my Appearance  As that you know was partly my View in coming to Town I thought this a happy Incident and determined not to lose the Opportunity and so according to the Direction she gave me I went to inquire for Mrs  C  in  J  n  's Court  Fleetstreet  The Neighbourhood look'd genteel and I soon found the House I asked for Mrs  C  she came to me dress'd in a splendid Manner I told her what I came about she immediately desired me to walk into the Parlour which was elegantly furnished and after asking me several Questions with my Answers to which she seem'd very well pleased a Servant soon brought in a Bowl of warm Liquor which she called  Negus  consisting of Wine Water Orange  c  which she said was for a Friend or two she expected presently but as I was warm with walking she would have me drink some of it telling me it was a pleasant innocent Liquor  and she always used her waiting Maids as she did herself I thought this was very kind and condescending and being warm and thirsty and she encouraging me I took a pretty free Draught of it and thought it very pleasant as it really was She made me sit down by her saying Pride was not her Talent and that she should always indulge me in like manner if I behaved well when she had not Company and then slightly asked what I could do and the Wages I required With my Answers she seemed well satisfied and granted the Wages I asked without any Offer of Abatement  And then I rose up in order to take my Leave telling her I would any Day she pleased of the ensuing Week bring my Cloaths and wait upon her  She said that her own Maid being gone away she was in the utmost Want of another and would take it kindly if I would stay with her till next Day because she was to have some Ladies to pass the Evening with her I said this would be pretty inconvenient to me but as she was so situated I would oblige her after I had been with my Aunt and acquainted her with it To this she reply'd that there was no manner of Occasion for that because she could send the Cook for what I wanted who could at the same time tell my Aunt how Matters stood  I thought this looked a little odd but she did it with so much Civility and seemed so pleased with her new Maid that I scarcely knew how to withstand her But the Apprehension I had of my Aunt's Anger for not asking her Advice in what so nearly concerned me made me insist upon going though I could perceive Displeasure in her Countenance when she saw me resolv'd  She then ply'd me very close with the Liquor which she again said was innocent and weak but I believe it was far otherwise for my Head began to turn round and my Stomach felt a little disordered I intreated the Favour of her to permit me to go on a firm Promise of returning immediately but then my new Mistress began to raise her Voice a little assuring me I should on no Account stir out of her House She left the Room in a sort of a Pet but said she would send the Cook to take my Directions to my Aunt and I heard her take the Key out of the outward Door  This alarmed me very much and in the Instant of my Surprize a young Gentlewoman entered the Parlour dress'd in white Sattin and every way genteel she sat down in a Chair next me looked earnestly at me a while and seemed going to speak several times but did not At length she rose from her Chair bolted the Parlourdoor and breaking into a Flood of Tears express'd herself as follows  "Dear young Woman I cannot tell you the Pain I feel on your Account and from an Inclination to serve you I run a Hazard of involving myself in greater Misery than I have yet experienced if that can be But my Heart is yet too honest to draw others as I am desir'd to do into a Snare which I have fallen into myself You are now in as notorious a Brothel as is in  London  And if you escape not in a few Hours you are inevitably undone I was once as innocent as you now seem to be No Apprehension you can be under for your Virtue but I felt as much My Name was as unspotted and my Heart as unvers'd in Ill when I first entered these guilty Doors whither I was sent on an Errand much like what I understand has brought you hither I  was by Force detained the whole Night as you are designed to be was robbed of my Virtue and knowing I should hardly be forgiven by my Friends for staying out without their Knowledge and in the Morning being at a Loss all in Confusion as I was what to do before I could resolve on any thing I was obliged to repeat my Guilt and had hardly Time afforded me to reflect on its fatal Consequences My Liberty I intreated to no Purpose and my Grief served for the cruel Sport of all around me In short I have been now so long confined that I am ashamed to appear among my Friends and Acquaintance In this dreadful Situation I have been perplexed with the hateful Importunities of different Men every Day and tho' I long resisted to my utmost yet downright Force never failed to overcome Thus in a shameful Round of Guilt and Horror have I lingered out Ten Months subject to more Miseries than Tongue can express The same sad Lot is intended you nor will it be easy to shun it However as I cannot well be more miserable than I am I will assist you what I can and not as the wretched Procuress hopes contribute to make you as unhappy as myself"  You may guess at the Terror that seized my Heart on this sad Story and my own Danger I trembled in every Joint nor was I able to speak for some time at last in the best Manner I could I thanked my unhappy new Friend and begg'd she would kindly give me the Assistance she offered which she did for the first Gentleman that came to the Door she stept up herself for the Key to let him in which the wretched Procuress gave her and I took that Opportunity as she directed to run out of the House and that in so much Hurry  and Confusion as to leave my Hood Fan and Gloves behind me  I told my Aunt every Circumstance of my Danger and Escape and received a severe Reprimand for my following so inconsiderately in so wicked a Town as this the Direction of an intire Stranger  I am sure Sister you rejoice with me for my Deliverance And this Accident may serve to teach us to be upon our Guard for the future as well against the viler Part of our own Sex as that of the other I am dear Sister  Your truly affectionate Sister  N B  This shocking Story is taken from the Mouth of the young Woman herself who so narrowly escaped the Snare of the vile Procuress and is Fact in every Circumstance  LETTER LXIII To a Daughter in a Country Town who encourages the Address of a Subaltern A Case too frequent in Country Places  Dear  Betsy  I HAVE been under the deepest Affliction ever since I heard of your encouraging the Addresses of a Soldier whether Serjeant or Corporal I know not who happens to quarter next Door to your Uncle  What my dear Child can you propose by such a Match Is his Pay sufficient to maintain himself If it be will it be sufficient for the Support of a Family  Consider there will be no Opportunity for  you  to increase his poor Income but by such Means as will be very grating for you to submit to Will your Hands be capable of enduring the Fatigues of a Washtub for your Maintenance Or will following a Camp suit your Inclinations Think well of the certain Misery that must attend your making such a Choice  Look round at the Wives of all his Fellowsoldiers and mark their Appearance at their Homes and in Publick Is  their  abject Condition to be coveted Do you see any thing desirable in Poverty and Rags And as to the Man for whom you must endure all this he may possibly indeed be possessed of Honesty and a Desire to do his best for you at least you may think so but is it probable he will For if he be wise and industrious how came he to prefer a Life so mean and contemptible If he was bred to any Trade why did he desert it  Be cautious of rushing yourself into Ruin and as I am not able to maintain you and a young Family do not throw yourself upon the uncertain Charity of  welldisposed  People who are already vastly encumbered by the Miserable I hope you will not thus rashly increase the unhappy Number of such but will give due Attention to what I have said for I can have no View but that of discharging the Duty of  Your loving Father  LETTER LXIV Of Expostulation from a grave Friend to a young Man on his slighting and irreverent Behaviour to his Father  Dear Sir  I TAKE the Freedom of a brief Expostulation with you on your Behaviour to your Father and I hope you will receive it from me with the same Goodwill that I mean it  His Indulgence to you formerly certainly claims better Returns on your Part altho' it should be allow'd as you fondly imagine that his Affection to you is alienated There may be something of Petulancy in him which you ought to bear with for one time or other you may be convinced by Experience that  Age  itself has its insuperable Afflictions that require the Allowance of every one and more particularly of such who hope to live a long Life themselves and still more particularly of a  Son  whose  high Passions  require perhaps at least as  much  Allowance He may be  petulant  but are you not  fiery  and  impetuous  And I would fain know whether  you  ought to bear with  him  or  he  with  you  'Tis a very groundless Surmise to think his Affections are alienated from you A Father  must  love his Son He cannot help it And is it credible even to yourself on cool Reflexion that the same good Man who was wont to be delighted with your childish Vanities and Foibles for we have all had them more or less and even indulged and perhaps cherished those youthful Forwardnesses that might be called the Seeds of those Passions which  now being sprung up give him so much Disturbance and make you so impatient of Contradiction Can you I say believe that this same good Man without Reason without Provocation can change that Love into Hate  You are grown to Man's Estate and tho' far from the ungracious Sons that we have seen in the World yet ought not to be so partial to yourself as to believe you are wholly faultless Examine your own Conduct then and altho' you should not be able to charge your  Intention  with any Blame yet you must leave your  Behaviour  to be judg'd by others and 'twill perhaps be given against you that some Slight some Negligence some Inattention if not worse too cutting for a Father's Cares and Fondness to support has escaped you Then consider Sir what a grievous thing it must be to him to reflect that this Behaviour of yours may be but the gradual Consequence of his former Indulgence to you and that he is deservedly punished for not rooting up in your childish Days those Weeds which now spread to his Uneasiness But let me tell you Sir that it ought to be a more sad Reflection to a considerate young Gentleman that  he  is to be the Instrument to punish his fond Father's faulty Indulgence to himself  I have been a diligent Observer of the Dispensations of Providence in this respect and have always seen the Sin of Undutifulness to Parents punished in  Kind  more than any one Sin I have seen the  Son  of the undutiful Son revenging the Cause of his  Grandfather  and at the same time intail'd a Curse upon  his  Son if he has not been taken off childless who in his Turn has retorted the ungracious Behaviour and thus a Curse has been intail'd by Descent upon the Family from one Generation to another  You'll say that your Behaviour to your Father is not you hope of such an atrocious Nature as to be attended with such terrible Consequences and perhaps will add that you do not wish for a better Behaviour from your Son than you shew to your Father But if this be not Partiality to yourself pray consider that while your Father takes your present Conduct in so ill Part and you use so little Circumspection to avoid giving him Disgust and have so little Complaisance as not to set him right the thing is full as tormenting to him from the  Appearance  as if it were  real  nay 'tis  real  to him if he  believes  so  He thinks and let me tell you Sir he thinks  justly  that he ought to expect as much Deference to  his  Will and Pleasure  now  as he has heretofore shewn you Indulgence even in those things that now perhaps you are so unkind to suffer to turn severest upon him I would not recriminate But it was with very little Reverence and indeed with an  Air  as censurable as the  Words  that you told him in my Hearing that he knew not what he would have That he expected you to be more accountable at  this  Age than when you were a  Child  c Why dear Sir does your being  of Age  lessen the Duty you owe to your Father Are not his Cares for you allowably  doubled  and ought he not now to expect from your good Sense and more mature Understanding improved as it is to be hoped by the Education he has at a great Expence given you  greater  Proofs of Duty rather than  less  He may forget perhaps what he  was at your Age  as you irreverently told him but how much more laudable would it be for you at  yours  to enter into what you would naturally expect from  your Son  were you in the  Place  and at the  Age  of  your Father  A generous Mind will do its Duty  tho' it were not to meet with suitable Rewards or Returns for even should your Father not do  his  by  you  you are not absolved of  yours  to  him  much less then ought the  natural  the  consequential  Infirmities of  Age  to dissolve the Duty of a Son to an indulgent Parent  Be convinced my dear Sir of your wrong Conduct and don't think it beneath the high Spirit of a brave young Gentleman to submit to the Will of his Father By your Dutifulness and Circumspection you may in all Probability add to the Number as well as the Comfort of  his  Days to whom you owe  your  Being But whar a Woe does that young Man bring upon himself who robs his aged Parent in  both  respects It behoves all Children to reflect upon this timely and with Awe  On how many Occasions has he heretofore rejoiced to me on even the smallest Openings and Dawnings of your Mind and Genius How has he dwelt on your Praises on even  supposed  Beauties which have appeared such to his fond and partial Tenderness only How has he extenuated your Failings connived at your Faults and extolled and brought forward into strong Light even the remotest Appearance of Virtue in you Such  was  always and such notwithstanding the Intermixtures of  Age  and  Infirmity  and even of your continued  Slights  and  Impatience  always  will be  the Instances of his paternal Affection for you And I will venture to say that even this very Petulance as you think it is a Demonstration of his Regard for you however disagreeable it may be to you since he loves you too well to be insensible to those Parts of your Behaviour which he thinks are owing to Slight or Negligence  I have exceeded the Bounds I intended when I began and would rather leave to your natural good  Sense and cooler Reflection what I have  already  urged than tire you too much with what might  still farther  be added on this Occasion But the Affection and Friendship I have for all your Family and the long Intimacy I have had with your good Father who however knows nothing of my writing and the evil Consequences that may follow a wider Breach between you will answer for my Intention and I hope for my Freedom which I'll take upon me to say I  expect  from your Candor and Education being  Your sincere Friend to serve you  LETTER LXV Against too great a Love of Singing and Musick  Dear Cousin  I AM sure you have the good Sense to take kindly what I am going to mention to you in which I can have no possible View but your Benefit When you were last with me at  Hertford  you much obliged us all with the Instances you gave us of your Skill in Musick and your good Voice But as you are so young a Man and seem to be so very much pleased  yourself  with these Acquirements I must enter a Caution or two on this Score because of the Consequences that may follow from too much Delight in these Amusements which while they are pursued as Amusements  only  may be safe and innocent but when they take up too much of a Man's Time may be not a little pernicious  In the first place my dear Cousin these Pleasures of  Sound  may take you off from the more desirable ones of  Sense  and make your Delights  stop at the  Ear  which should go deeper and be placed in the  Understanding  For whenever a chearful Singer is in Company adieu to all Conversation of an improving or intellectual Nature  In the second place it may expose you to  Company  and that not the  best  and  most  eligible neither and by which your  Business  and your other  more useful  Studies may be greatly if not wholly neglected and very possibly your  Health  itself much impaired  In the third place it may tend for so it naturally does to  enervate the Mind  and make you haunt musical Societies Operas and Concerts and what Glory is it to a Gentleman if he were even a fine Performer that he can strike a String touch a Key or sing a Song with the Grace and Command of a  hired Musician  Fourthly Musick to arrive at any tolerable Proficiency in it takes up  much Time  and requires so much Application as leaves but little  Room  and what is worse when delighted in little  Inclination  for other Improvements And as Life is a  short  Stage where  longest  surely the most precious Moments of it ought to be better imploy'd than in so light and airy an Amusement The Time of  Youth  will be soon over and that is the Time of laying the Foundation of more solid Studies The  Mind  as well as the  Body  will become stiff by Years and unsusceptible of those Improvements that cannot be attained but in particular Periods of it And once an airy Delight engages the Faculties a Habit is formed and nothing but great Struggle and absolute Necessity if  that  will do it can shake it off One Part of Life is for  Improvement  that is  Youth  another Part is for turning that Improvement to solid Benefits to one's Self one's Family or Acquaintance that is the  middle Part  another  Part carries a Retrospect to a  future Estate  And shall we lose the Time of  Improvement  which can never come again forfeit all the Benefits of it in our  Middlelife  and embitter our  future Prospect  as well  mundane  as  eternal  with Reflections on our past Neglect of Opportunities that never can be recalled And all for what Why only to be deemed for eight or ten empty Years of Life  a good Companion  as the Phrase isTho' perhaps a bad  Husband  a bad  Father  a bad  Friend  and of course a bad  Man  Some there are who divide Life into four Stages or Opportunities He they say who is not handsome by Twenty strong by Thirty wise by Forty rich by Fifty will never be either  handsome strong wise  or  rich  And this generally speaking is a good and improving Observation which should teach us as we go along to make a right Use of those Periods of Life which may be proper Entrances for us into a still more important one than that behind it  I have but lightly touched on these weighty Points because I know you have good Sense enough to improve as much from Hints as others can from tedious Lectures And when I have repeated that I am far from dissuading you from these Amusements while they are restrained to due Bounds and are regarded as Amusements  only  I know you will think me what I always desire to be thought and what I truly am  Your affectionate Uncle and sincere Friend  LETTER LXVI From a Daughter to her Father pleading for her Sister who had married without his Consent  Honoured Sir  THE kind Indulgence you have always shewn to your Children makes me presume to become an Advocate for my  Sister  tho' not for her  Fault  She is very sensible of  that  and sorry she has offended you but has great hopes that Mr  Robinson  will prove such a careful and loving Husband to her as may atone for his past Wildness and engage your Forgiveness For all your Children are sensible of your paternal Kindness and that you wish their Good more for their sakes than  your own  This makes it the more wicked to offend so good a Father But dear Sir be pleased to consider that it now cannot be helped and that she may be made by your Displeasure very miserable in her own Choice and as his Faults are owing to the Inconsideration of Youth or otherwise it would not have been a very discreditable Match had it had your Approbation I could humbly hope for my poor Sister's sake that you will be pleased rather to encourage his present good Resolutions by your kind Favour than make him despair of a Reconciliation and so perhaps treat her with a Negligence which hitherto she is not apprehensive of For he is really very fond of her and I hope will continue so Yet is she dejected for her Fault to you and wishes yet dreads to have your Leave to throw herself at your Feet to beg your Forgiveness and  Blessing which would make the poor dear Offender quite happy  Pardon Sir my interposing in her Favour in which my Husband also joins She is  my  Sister She is  your  Daughter tho' she has not done so worthily as I wish to become that Character Be pleased Sir to forgive her however and also forgive me pleading for her Who am  Your everdutiful Daughter  LETTER LXVII The Father's Answer  My dear  Nanny  YOU must believe that your Sister's unadvised Marriage which she must know would be disagreeable to me gives me no small Concern and yet I will assure you that it arises more from my Affection for her than any other Consideration In her Education I took all the Pains and Care my Circumstances would admit and often flattered myself with the Hope that the happy Fruits of it would be made appear in her prudent Conduct What she has now done is not  vicious  but  indiscreet  for you must remember that I have often declared in her Hearing that the wild Assertion of a Rake making a good Husband was the most dangerous Opinion a young Woman could imbibe  I will not however in Pity to her point out the many Ills I am afraid will attend her Rashness because  it is done  and cannot be  helped  but wish she may be happier than I ever saw a Woman who leap'd so fatal a Precipice  Her Husband has this Morning been with  for her Fortune and it was with much Tempe  I told him That as all she could hope for was wholly at my Disposal I should disburse it in such a manner as I thought would most contribute to her Advantage and that as he was a Stranger to me I should chuse to know he  deserved  it before he had the Power over what I intended to do for her He bit his Lip and with a hasty Step was my humble Servant  Tell the rash Girl that I would not have her to be afflicted at this Behaviour in me for I know it will contribute to her Advantage one way or other If he married her for  her own sake  she will find no Alteration of Behaviour from this Disappointment But if he married only for her  Money  she will soon be glad to find it in my Possession rather than his  Your Interposition in her Behalf is very  sisterly  And you see I have not the Resentment she might expect But would to God she had acted with your Prudence For her own sake I wish it I am  Your loving Father  LETTER LXVIII To a Brother against making his Wife and Children the constant Subject of his Praise and Conversation  Dear Brother  THE Love I have always had for you and an Unwillingness I find in myself to say any thing that may put you to Confusion has made me take this Method of acquainting you with a small Indiscretion I have often observed in you and which I perceive gradually to gain Ground as your Family increases  What I mean is an immoderate Inclination to make your Spouse and your Children the Subject of Discourse whereever you are Imagine not that any Pique or Dislike draws this from me My Sister I think is possessed of as many valuable Qualities as most of her Sex and all your Children are very promising No wonder then that this View makes a very deep Impression upon so tender a Heart as yours and the Fondness of a Husband and of a Father is what must make you esteemed by all who consider the many Advantages arising from thence to Posterity But a Mind full of Affection for what is so dear to himself stands in need of the utmost Care to keep what concerns  only himself  from employing too much the Attention of  others  What affects  you  most sensibly upon this Subject is even by your Friends heard rather with an Ear of  Censure  than  Applause  And what the tender Bias of a Father swells in your Conception to the most  witty Repartee  by an Ear destitute of that Bias sounds neither witty nor uncommon and you cannot mortify many Men more than by dragging out an unwilling  Ay very pretty indeed Sir A charming Boy  or  Such a Saying was far above his Years truly  Which kind of  yawning Applause  is sometimes by your Attention being strongly fixed to your Story mistaken for  Approbation  and you thereupon launch out farther upon the same Subject when your Hearers are scarce able to conceal their Inattention Besides don't you consider that another Man may have as great Fondness for  his  as you have for  yours  and while your Children are the wittiest the beautifullest the hopefullest in  England  do you not tacitly reflect upon every other Man's Children in the Company  To me I grant you full Liberty to say whatever you please nay several little Tricks you tell of  Patty  and  Tommy  are agreeable enough to  me  and some I think even entertaining but to  others  have a close Guard upon yourself lest when you try to get your  Children  admired you should get  yourself  despised Let you and me as  Father  and  Uncle  keep all their little Whimsies to ourselves for as Strangers share not in the  Affection  and  Expence  attending them why should they partake in the  Entertainment  they afford  I hope my constant Behaviour has convinced you of my sincere Regard for your Interest and Reputation What I have said I mean for your Benefit And you know me too well to think otherwise of  Your tenderly affectionate Brother  LETTER LXIX From a Father to a Daughter in Dislike of her Intentions to marry at too early an Age  Dear  Sally  I WAS greatly surprised at the Letter you sent me last Week I was willing to believe I saw in you for your Years so much of your late dear Mother's Temper Prudence and virtuous Disposition that I refused several advantageous Offers of changing my own Condition purely for your sake And will you now convince me so early that I have no Return to expect from you but that the Moment a young Fellow throws himself in your way you have nothing else to do but to give me Notice to provide a Fortune for you for  that you intend to be of no further Use and Service to me This in plain  English  is the Meaning of your Notification For I suppose your young Man does not intend to marry you without a Fortune And can you then think that a Father has nothing to do but to confer Benefits on his Children without being intitled to expect any Return from them  To be sure I had proposed at a proper Time to find a Husband for you but I thought I had yet three or four Years to come For consider  Sally  you are not fully Sixteen Years of Age And a Wife believe me ought to have some better Qualifications than an agreeable Person to  preserve  a  Husband's Esteem  tho' it often is enough to  attract a Lover's Notice  Have you Experience enough think you discreetly to conduct the Affairs of a Family I thought you as yet not quite capable to manage  House and I am sure my Judgment always took a Bias in your Favour  Besides let me tell you I have great Exceptions to the Person and think him by no means the Man I would chuse for your Husband For which if it be not too late I will give good Reasons  On the whole you must expect if you marry without my  Consent  to live without my  Assistance  Think it not hard Your Disappointment cannot be greater than mine if you will proceed I have never used violent Measures to you on any Occasion and shall not on this But yet I earnestly hope you will not hurry yourself to Destruction and  perhaps to the Grave by an Action which a littl  Consideration may so easily prevent I am  Your afflicted Father  LETTER LXX From a Father to a Daughter against a frothy  French  Lover  Dear  Polly  I CANNOT say I look upon Mr  La Farriere  in the same favourable Light that you seem to do His frothy Behaviour may divert well enough as an Acquaintance but is very unanswerable I think to the Character of a Husband especially an  English  Husband which I take to be a graver Character than a  French  one There is a Difference in these gay Gentlemen while they  strive to please  and when they  expect to be obliged  In all Men this is too apparent But in those of a light Turn it is more visible than in others If after Marriage his present Temper should continue when  you  are a careful Mother  he  will look more like a Son than a Husband If entering into the World should change his Disposition expect no Medium he will be the most insipid Mortal you can imagine if his Spirits should be depressed by the Accidents of Life he is such a Stranger to Reflection the best Counsellor of the Wise that from thence he will be unable to draw Relief And Adversity to such Men is the more intolerable as their Deportment is suited only to the Smiles of Success  He  dances  well  writes  very indifferently Is an Artist at  Cards  but cannot cast  Accounts  Understands all the Laws of  Chance  but not one of the  Land  Has shewn great Skill in the Improvement of his  Person  yet none at all that I hear of his  Estate  And tho' he makes a good Figure in  Company  has never yet studied the Art of living at  Home  He  sings  well but knows nothing of  Business  He has long acted the Part of a  Lover  but may not find the same Variety and Entertainment in acting the  Husband  Is very  gallant  but may not be over  affectionate  And is so tender of  himself  that he will have little Time to indulge  any body else  These Child are my Sentiments of him you are not wholly ignorant of the World I desire to  guide  not to  force  your Inclinations and hope your calm Reason will banish all farther Thoughts of this Gentleman who however you may like him for a Partner at a  Ball  seems not so well qualified for a Journey through the various Trials from which no Station can exempt the  married State  I am  Your affectionate Father  LETTER LXXI A modest Lover desiring an Aunt's Favour to her Niece  Good Madam  I HAVE several times that I have been happy in the Company of your beloved Niece thought to have spoken my Mind and to declare to her the true Value and Affection I have for her But just as I have been about to speak my Fears have vanquish'd my Hopes and I have been obliged to suspend my Purpose I have thrown out several Hints that I thought would have led the way to a fuller disclosing of the Secret that is too big for my Breast and yet when I am near her is too important for Utterance Will you be so good Madam to break way for me if I am not wholly disapproved  of by you and prepare her dear Mind for a Declaration that I must make and yet know not how to beginMy Fortune and Expectations make me hope that I may not on those Accounts be deemed unworthy And could I by half a Line from your Hand hope that there is  no other  Bar I should be enabled to build on so desirable a Foundation and to let your Niece know how much my Happiness depends upon her Favour Excuse dear Madam I beseech you this Trouble and this presumptuous Request from  Your most obliged and obedient Servant  LETTER LXXII The Aunt's Answer supposing the Gentleman deserves Encouragement  SIR  I CANNOT say I have any Dislike as to my own part to your Proposal or your Manner of making it whatever my Niece may have because Diffidence is generally the Companion of Merit and a Token of Respect She is a Person of Prudence and all her Friends are so throughly convinced of it that her Choice will have the Weight it deserves with us all So I cannot say what will be the Event of your Declaration to her Yet so far as I may take upon myself to do I will not deny your Request but on her Return to me tomorrow will break the Ice as you desire not doubting your Honour and the Sincerity of your Professions and I shall tell her moreover what I think of the Advances you make I believe she has had the Prudence to keep her Heart intirely disengaged because she would otherwise have told me And  is not so meanspirited as to be able to return Tyranny and Insult for true Value when she is properly convinced of it Whoever has the Happiness permit me tho' her Relation to call it so to meet with her Favour will find this her Character and that it is not owing to the fond Partiality of Sir  Your Friend and Servant  LETTER LXXIII The Answer supposing the Gentleman is not approved  SIR  I HAVE intimated your Request to my Niece who thinks herself obliged to your good Opinion of her But begs that you will give over all Thoughts of applying to her on this Subject She says she can by no means encourage your Address It is better therefore to know this at first because it will save her and yourself farther Trouble I am Sir  Your humble Servant  LETTER LXXIV From a respectful Lover to his Mistress  Dear Madam  I HAVE long struggled with the most honourable and respectful Passion that ever filled the Heart of Man I have often try'd to reveal it personally as often in this way but never till now could prevail upon my Fears and Doubts But I can no longer struggle with a Secret that has given me so much Torture to keep and yet hitherto more when I have endeavoured to reveal it I never entertain the Hope to see you without Rapture  but when I have that Pleasure instead of being  animated  as I ought I am utterly confounded What can this be owing to but a Diffidence in myself and an exalted Opinion of your Worthiness And is not this one strong Token of ardent Love Yet if it be how various is the tormenting Passion in its Operations Since some it inspires with Courage while others it deprives of all necessary Confidence I can only assure you Madam that the Heart of Man never conceived a stronger or sincerer Passion than mine for you If my Reverence for you is my Crime I am sure it has been my sufficient Punishment I need not say my Designs and Motives are honourable Who dare approach so much virtuous Excellence with a Supposition that such an Assurance is necessary What my Fortune is is well known and I am ready to stand the Test of the strictest Inquiry Condescend Madam to embolden my respectful Passion by  e favourable Line that if what I here profess  hope further to have an Opportunity to assure  of be found to be unquestionable Truth then my humble Address will not quite be unacceptable to you and thus you will for ever oblige dear Madam  Your passionate Admirer and devoted Servant  LETTER LXXV The Answer  SIR  IF Modesty be the greatest Glory of  our  Sex surely it cannot be blameworthy in  yours  For my own part I must think it the most amiable Quality either Man or Woman can possess Nor can there be in my Opinion a true Respect where  there is not a Diffidence of one's own Merit and an high Opinion of the Person's we esteem  To say more on this Occasion would little become me To say less would look as if I knew not how to pay that Regard to modest Merit which modest Merit  only  deserves  You Sir best know your own Heart and if you are sincere and generous will receive as you ought this Frankness from  Your humble Servant  LETTER LXXVI A humorous Epistle of neighbourly Occurrences and News to a BottleCompanion abroad  Dear  Bob  I AM glad to hear you're in the Land of the Living still You expect from me an Account of what has happen'd among your old Acquaintance since you have been abroad I will give it you and 'bating that two or three Years always make vast Alterations in  mature  Life you would be surpris'd at the Havock and Changes that small Space of Time has made in the Circle of our Acquaintance To begin them with myself I have had the Misfortune to lose my Son  Jo  and my Daughter  Judy  is marry'd and has brought me another  Jo Jack Kid  of the  Fountain  where we kept our Club has lost his Wife who was a special Barkeeper got his Maid  Prise  with Childyou remember the Slut by her mincing Airsmarry'd her and is broke But not till he had with his horrid Stum poison'd half the Society We began to complain of his Wine you know before you left us and I told him he should let  us  have Neat who drank our  Gallons if he was honest to  himself  and if he was to regard  Conscience  as well as  Interest  must do less Harm by dispensing his Ratsbane to those who drank Pints than to those honest Fellows who swallow'd Gallons and in so handsome a Dose of the one must take a too large Quantity of the other But the Dog was incorrigible for he went on brewing and poisoning till he kill'd his best Customers and then what could he expect  Why what follow'd for truly  Bob  we began to tumble

honest Capt  Tinker  who was deep gone in a Consumption is in very little better Case And if any thing saves  him  and  me  and the rest of our once numerous Society it will be the Bankruptcy of our worthy Landlord for that has quite broke us up  So much for the  Club  Bob Now to the  Neighbourhood  about us that you and I knew next best  Jerry Jenkyns  the prim Mercer has had a Statute taken out

clumsy Parson  Dromedary  is made a Dean and has Hopes by his Sister's means who is a Favourite of a certain great Man to be a Bishop  As to News of a  publick  Nature the Papers which no doubt you see in the monthly Collections at least will inform you best of that By them however you'll find very little Judgment to be form'd of our Affairs or our Ministers as to the one being or the other doing right or wrong For while some are made as  black  as  Devils  on one Side they are made as  white  as  Angels  on the other They never did  one good thing  says the  Enemy  They never did  one

Administration will be well off if the Publick will  middle  the Matter between the two  Extremes  Mean time one Side goes on  accusing  without  Mercy  the other  acquitting  without  Shame  'Tis the Business of  one Set  of Papers to  bespatter  and  throw Dirt  and of the  other  to follow after them with a  Scrubbingbrush  and a  Dishclout  And after allthe one  bedaubs  so  plentifully  and the other  wipes  off so  slovenly  that let me be hang'd  Bob  if I'd appear on  'Change  with the Coat on my Back that a certain great Man stalks about in without Concern when these  Dawbers  and  Scowerers  have done their  worst  and their  best  upon it But 'tis a great Matter to be  used  to such a Coat And a great Happiness I'll warrant your Namesake thinks it that with all this  Rubbing  and  Scrubbing  it does not appear  threadbare  yet after twenty Years Wear and a hundred People trying to pick Holes in it  But I have done with my News and my Politicks in which I was ever but a Dabbler and having written a terrible long Letter and given you as it were the World in Miniature think it time to close it which I shall do with wishing that now our poisoning Landlord  Kidd  is broke and gone you were among us your old Friends nowandthen to enliven us with your chearful Pipe as you used to do in the Days of  Yore  when we were all alive and merry And with this hearty Wish I conclude myself dear  Bob  Your old BottleCompanion and humble Servant  LETTER LXXVII From a Nephew to his Aunt on his slow Progress in a Courtship Affair  Dear Aunt  I HAVE made my Addresses in the best manner I can to Miss  Dawley  but have not the least Room to boast of my Success The Account you gave me of her good Sense and many uncommon Qualifications will not permit me to arraign  her Conduct and the good Opinion I have long entertained of myself makes me very slow in blaming my own I would have obey'd your Orders to write to you sooner but knew not what to say and by waiting till I began to fear you would think me negligent I am in no better Condition I first declared my Regard for her in a manner I thought most suitable for that Purpose She very encouragingly made me no Answer and when I spoke again upon the Subject she ask'd how you did and was glad to hear you were well Being put out of my Play I talk'd of indifferent Things a good while and at last fell again upon the Reason of my attending her She order'd the Cloth to be laid and complaisantly hoped I would stay Supper I had no more Opportunity for that time  Two Days after I repeated my Visit She received me at first politely but when I began to resume the Subject I came upon she rung for the Maid and bad her put on the Teakettle About six Visits passed before I could obtain one Word to my Business And the first Thing she answer'd upon that Head was That Length of Time was necessary to the making of an Acquaintance that must not be either blushed at or repented of This she spoke with such an Air of Gravity as put what I would have reply'd quite out of my Head Yet next Visit I began again I told her how happy I should think myself if I could be encouraged to hope for the smallest Share of her Favour But she made me such an odd Answer as plainly demonstrated to me that I had more of her Contempt than Approbation This made me as earnest as she to wave the Subject and so we went on upon the Weather for a whole Week before and when we had done that we talk'd Politicks And Admiral  Vernon  and Lord  Cathcart's  Expedition  and the like Stuff took Place So that in short after Two Months Study how to accomplish the Happiness you pointed out for me I find myself not one single Step advanced for when I see her now we both talk with seeming Satisfaction on any Subject where Love has no Part but when that is introduced all her easy Eloquence sinks into Reserve  I would not determine to give up my Address before I had your farther Advice In hopes of which I am  Honoured Madam your dutiful Nephew  LETTER LXXVIII The Aunt's Answer encouraging him to persevere  Nephew  Robert  I Thought you had been better acquainted with the Art of Love than to be so easily out of Heart That such a Lady as Miss  Dawley  has not forbid your Visits let me tell you is Encouragement as much as you ought to expect She is a Lady of fine Sense and has had the Advantage of as fine an Education and you must not expect a Lady of her Prudence and Merit will be won by general Compliments or that her Affection will be moved by the Notion of a sudden and precipitate Passion Her Judgment must be first touch'd for she views Marriage as a serious Thing By it her Mother was made happy and her Sister undone I injoin the Continuation of your Addresses for a more deserving Lady than Miss does not live And be sure at least to be more ambitious of appearing a  Man of Sense  than a  Lover  When the latter is accepted on account of the former the Lady  does Credit to her Choice You young Fellows have such Notions of a Ninedays Courtship that if it were indulged by all Women none would in a short time be thought obliging who did not make Modesty submit to Passion and Discretion to Compliment I desire to hear from you again a Month hence and am in the mean time  Your affectionate Aunt  LETTER LXXIX A Gentleman to a Lady professing an Aversion to the tedious Forms of Courtship  Dear Madam  I Remember that one of the Ancients in describing a Youth in Love says he has neither Wisdom enough to speak nor to hold his Tongue If this be a just Description the Sincerity of my Passion will admit of no Dispute And whenever in your Company I behave like a Fool forget not that you are answerable for my Incapacity Having made bold to declare thus much I must presume to say that a favourable Reception of this will I am certain make me more worthy your Notice but your Disdain would be what I believe myself incapable ever to surmount To try by idle Fallacies and airy Compliments to prevail on your Judgment is a Folly for any Man to attempt who knows you No Madam your good Sense and Endowments have raised you far above the Necessity of practising the mean Artifices which prevail upon the less deserving of your Sex You are not to be so lightly deceived and if you were give me leave to say I should not think you  deserving of the Trouble that would attend such an Attempt  This I must own is no fashionable Letter from one who I am sure loves up to the greatest Hero of Romance But as I would hope that the Happiness I sue for should be lasting it is certainly most eligible to take no Step to procure it but what will bear Reflection for I should be happy to see you mine when we have both outlived the Taste for every thing that has not Virtue and Reason to support it I am Madam notwithstanding this unpolish'd Address  Your most respectful Admirer and obedient Servant  LETTER LXXX The Lady's Answer encouraging a farther Declaration  SIR  I AM very little in Love with the fashionable Methods of Courtship Sincerity with me is preferable to Compliments yet I see no Reason why common Decency should be discarded There is something so odd in your Style that when I know whether you are in Jest or Earnest I shall be less at a loss to answer you Mean time as there is abundant Room for rising rather than sinking in your Complaisance you may possibly have chosen wisely to begin first at the lowst End If this be the Case I know not what your succeeding Addresses may produce But I tell you fairly that your present make no great Impression yet perhaps as much as you intended on  Your humble Serv  LETTER LXXXI The Gentleman's Reply more explicitly avowing his Passion  Dearest Madam  NOW I have the Hope of being not more despised for my acknowledg'd Affection I declare to you with all the Sincerity of a Man of Honour that I have long had a most sincere Passion for you but I have seen Gentlemen led such Dances when they have given up their Affections to the lovely Tyrants of their Hearts and could not help themselves that I had no Courage to begin an Address in the usual Forms even to you of whose good Sense and Generosity I had nevertheless a great Opinion You have favoured me with a few Lines which I most humbly thank you for And I do assure you Madam if you will be pleased to encourage my humble Suit you shall have so just an Account of my Circumstances and Pretensions as I hope will intitle me to your Favour in the honourable Light in which I profess myself dear Madam  Your most obliged and faithful Admirer  Be so good as to favour me with one Line more to encourage my personal Attendance if not disagreeable  LETTER LXXXII The Lady's Answer to his Reply putting the Matter on a sudden Issue  SIR  AS we are both so well inclined to avoid unnecessary Trouble as well as unnecessary Compliments I think proper to acquaint you That Mr  Johnson  of  Pallmall  has the Management of all my Affairs and is a Man of such Probity and Honour that I do nothing in any Matters without him I have no Dislike to your Person and if you approve of what Mr  Johnson  can acquaint you with in relation to me and I approve of his Report in your Favour I shall be far from shewing any Gentleman that I have either an insolent or a sordid Spirit especially to such as do me the Honour of their good Opinion I am Sir  Your humble Servant  LETTER LXXXIII A facetious young Lady to her Aunt ridiculing her serious Lover  Dear Aunt  I AM much obliged to you for the Kindnes you intended me in recommending Mr  Leadbeater  to me for a Husband But I must be so free as to tell you he is a Man no way suited to my Inclination I despise 'tis true the idle Rants of Romance but am inclinable to think there may be an Extreme on the other Side of the Question  The first time the  honest Man  came to see me in the way you was pleased to put into his Head was one  Sunday  after Sermon time He began with telling me what I found at  my  Fingersends that it was very cold and politely blow'd upon  his  I immediately perceived that his Passion for me could not keep him warm and in Complaisance to your Recommendation conducted him to the Fireside After he had pretty well rubbed Heat into his Hands he stood up with his Back to the Fire and with his Hand behind him held up his Coat that he might be warm all over and looking about him asked with the Tranquillity of a Man a Twelvemonth married and just come off a Journey How all Friends did in the Country I said I hoped very well but would be glad to warm my Fingers Cry Mercy MadamAnd then he shuffled a little further from the Fire and after two or three Hems and a long Pause  I have heard said he a most excellent Sermon just now Dr  Thomas  is a fine Man truly Did you ever hear him Madam No Sir I generally go to my own ParishChurch That's right Madam to be sure What was your Subject today The  Pharisee  and the  Publican  Sir A very good one truly Dr  Thomas  would have made fine Work upon that Subject His Text today was  Evil Communications corrupt good Manners  A good Subject Sir I doubt not the Doctor made a fine Discourse upon it  O ay  Madam he can't make a bad one upon any Subject I rung for the Teakettle for thought I we shall have all the Heads of the Sermon immediately  At Tea he gave me an Account of all the religious Societies unask'd and how many Boys they had put out 'Prentice and Girls they had taught to  knit and sing Psalms To all which I gave a Nod of Approbation and was just able to say for I began to be horribly in the Vapours It was a very excellent Charity  O ay  Madam said he again for that's his Word I find a very excellent one truly it is snatching so many Brands out of the Fire You are a Contributor Sir I doubt not  O ay  Madam to be sure every  good Man  would contribute to such a worthy Charity to be sure No doubt Sir a Blessing attends upon all who promote so worthy a Design  O ay  Madam no doubt as you say I am sure I have sound it blessed be God And then he twang'd his Nose and lifted up his Eyes as if in an Ejaculation  O my good Aunt what a Man is here for a Husband At last came the happy Moment of his taking Leave for I would not ask him to stay Supper and moreover he talk'd of going to a Lecture at St  Helen's  and then tho' I had had an Opportunity of saying little more than Yes and No all the Time for he took the Vapours he had put me into for Devotion and Gravity at least I believe he press'd my Hand look'd frightfully kind and gave me to understand as a Mark of his Favour that if upon further Conversation and Inquiry into my Character he should happen to like me as well as he did from my Behaviour and Person why  ruly I need not fear in time being blessed with him for my Husband  This my good Aunt may be a mighty safe way of travelling toward the  Land  of  Matrimony  as far as I know but I cannot help wishing for a little more  Entertainment  on our  Journey  I am willing to believe Mr  Leadbeater  an honest Man but am at the same time afraid his religious Turn of Temper however in itself  commendable would better suit with a Woman who centres all Desert in a  solemn Appearance  than with dear Aunt  Your greatly obliged Kinswoman  LETTER LXXXIV Her Aunt's Answer reprehending her ludicrous Turn of Mind  Cousin  Jenny  IAM sorry you think Mr  Leadbeater  so unsuitable a Lover He is a serious sober good Man and surely when Seriousness and Sobriety make a necessary Part of the Duty of a  good Husband  a  good Father  and  good Master  of a Family those Characters should not be the Subjects of Ridicule in Persons of  our Sex  especially who would reap the greatest Advantage from them But he talks of the  Weather  when he first sees you it seems and would you have him directly fall upon the Subject of  Love  the Moment he beheld you  He visited you just after Sermon on a  Sunday  And was it so unsuitable for him to let you see that the Duty of the Day had made proper Impressions upon him  His Turn for promoting the Religious Societies which you speak so slightly of deserves more Regard from every good Person for that same Turn is a kind of  Security  to a Woman that he who had a benevolent and religious Heart could not make a  bad Man  or a  bad Husband  To put out poor Boys to 'Prentice to teach Girls to sing  Psalms  would be with very few a Subject for Ridicule for he that was so willing to provide for  the Children of  others  would take still greater Care of  his own  He gave you to understand that if he liked your Character on Inquiry as well as your Person and Behaviour he should think himself very happy in such a Wife for that I dare say was more like his Language than that you put in his Mouth And let me tell you it would have been a much stranger Speech had so cautious and serious a Man said without a thorough Knowledge of your Character that at the first Sight he was over Head and Ears in Love with you  I think allowing for the ridiculous Turn your airy Wit gives to this his first Visit that by your own Account he acted like a prudent a serious and a worthy Man as he is and as one that thought flashy Compliments beneath him in so serious an Affair as this  I think Cousin  Jenny  this is not only a mighty safe Way as you call it of travelling toward the  Land of Matrimony  but to the  Land of Happiness  with respect as well to the  next World  as  this  And it is to be hoped that the  better Entertainment  you so much wish for on your  Journey  may not lead you too much out of  your Way  and divert your Mind from the principal View which you ought to have to your  Journey's End  In short I could rather have wish'd that you could bring your Mind nearer to  his  Standard than that he should bring down his to your  Level  And you'd have found more Satisfaction in it than you imagine could you have brought yourself to a little more of that  solemn Appearance  which you treat so lightly and which I think in  him  is much more than  mere Appearance  Upon the whole Cousin  Jenny  I am sorry that a Woman of Virtue and Morals as you are  should treat so ludicrously a serious and pious Frame of Mind in an Age wherein good Examples are so rare and so much wanted tho' at the same time I am far from offering to prescribe to you in so arduous an Affair as a Husband and wish you and Mr  Leadbeater  too since you are so  differently  disposed matched more suitably to each other's Mind than you are likely to be together For I am  Your truly affectionate Aunt  LETTER LXXXV From a Gentleman to his Mistress resenting her supposed Coquetry  MADAM  BEAUTY has Charms which are not casily resisted but it is I presume in the Power of the finest Woman breathing to counterbalance all her Charms by a Conduct unworthy of them This Manner of speaking Madam is what I am apprehensive you have not been  enough  used to The Advantages you possess independently of any Act of your own cannot be any Warrant for a Behaviour repugnant to Honour and strict good Manners I ventured to address myself to you Madam upon Motives truly honourable and best to be defended but suffer me to say that I never proposed to glory in adding one to the Number of your publick Admirers or to be so tame as to subject myself to  any  Usage And if this be your Intention and this only I shall still admire you but must leave the flattering of your Vanity to Gentlemen who have more Leisure and less Sincerity than Madam  Your most obedient Servant  LETTER LXXXVI The Lady's angry Answer  SIR  BY the Letter I just now received from you I fansy you have been a little too hasty as well at too free in your Conjectures about my Conduct I hope it is such and will be always such as shall justify me to Persons of Honour of my own Sex as well as yours You have surely Sir a Right to act as you please and at present however so have I How long I should have this Liberty were I at your  Mercy  this Letter of yours gives me a most desirable and seasonable Intimation  For Goodness sake Sir let me do as  I  think proper I see  you  will I sent not for you nor asked you to be one of the Number you mention And if you think fit to withdraw your Name from the List can I help it if I would ever so fain But could you not do this without resolving to affront me and to reflect on my Conduct I am unworthy of your Address I grant itThen you can forbear it Perhaps I like to see the young Fellows  dying  for me but since they can do it without impairing their Health don't be so very angry at me In short Sir you are your own Master and Heaven be thank'd I am at present my own Mistress and your wellmanner'd Letter will make me resolve to be so longer than perhaps I had otherwise resolved You see my  Follies  in my  Conduct  Thank you Sir for letting me know you do I see your Sex in your  Letter  Thank you Sir for that too So being  thus much obliged to you in a double respect can I do otherwise than subscribe myself  Your thankful Servant  LETTER LXXXVII The Gentleman's submissive Reply  Dear Madam  I BEG ten thousand Pardons for my rash Letter to you I wish'd too late I could have recall'd it And when I had the Favour of yours I was under double Concern But indeed Madam you treated me I thought too lightly and Contempt is intolerable where a Mind is so sincerely devoted I never saw a Lady I could love before I saw you I never shall see another I wish to be mine and as I must love you whether I will or no I hope you'll forgive my foolish Petulance I am sure it was inspired by Motives that however culpable in their Effects are intitled to your Forgiveness as to the Cause I cannot meanly sue tho' to you Don't let me undergo too heavy a Penance for my Rashness You can mould me to any Form you please But dear Lady let not my honest Heart suffer the  more  Torture because it is so devotedly at your Service Once again I ask a thousand PardonsWhat can I say moreI own I am hasty but 'tis most when I think myself slighted or used contemptuously by those I love Such Tempers Madam are not the worst let me tell you And tho' I may be too ready to offend yet am I always as ready to repent And dear good Madam let me be receiv'd to Favour this once and I will be more cautious for the future For  I am and ever must be whether you'll allow it or not  Your most devoted Admirer and humble Servant  LETTER LXXXVIII The Lady's forgiving Return  SIR  I Cannot help answering your Letter because you seem sensible of your Fault If your Temper is so captious your Guard against it should be the stronger It is no very comfortable View let me tell you that one sees a Person who wants to recommend himself to one's Friendship so ready to take Fire What has a Woman to do in common Discretion but to avoid while she can a Prospect so unpleasing For if she knows she cannot bear disreputable Imputations as indeed she ought not and that the Gentleman is not able to contain himself whenever he is pleased to be moved from giving them why this truly affords a most comfortable Appearance of a happy Life However Sir I cannot bear Malice for a first Fault tho' yet it looks like a Temper even in a Friend that one would rather fear than love But if it be never repeated at least till I give such Reasons for it that neither Charity nor a professed Esteem can excuse I shall hope that what has happen'd may rather be of good than bad Use to us both But indeed I must say that if you cannot avoid such disagreeable Instances of your Sensibility it will be Justice to both now we are both free to think no more of  Your humble Servant  LETTER LXXXIX Ridiculing a romantick Rhapsody in Courtship  SIR  MY Niece desires me to acquaint you that she received your celestial Epistle last Night as we were all sitting down to Supper and she leaves it to me to answer it according to the Effects it has produced You must know then that as soon as she had read it there appear'd a more marvellous Metamorphosis in her Deportment than any we read of in  Ovid  She put on high Airs and talk'd in a lofty Strain to Us as well as to the Maids nor knew she how to behave all the rest of the EveningYou had so thoroughly proved her superior to all the Deities of the Antients that she could not help fansying the homely Viands that stood before her a Banquet of  Paradise  and when she put to her Lips some of our common Tabledrink it became immediately in her Fancy  Nectar  and  Ambrosia  and she affected to sip rather than drink When by your generous Aid she had thus raised herself far above Mortality she began to despise our Company and thought her Grandmother and me too highly favoured by her Presence and spoke to us in such a Tone as made us honest Mortals amaz'd at her sudden Elevation  In short Sir as she has placed such a thorough Confidence in you as to believe whatever you are pleased to tell her she begs you will never so far mortify her towering Ambition as to treat her like any thing earthly  If then you would make yourself worthy of her Favour you must in order to support the Description  you have given of her at least dart through the Clouds or rise with the MorningGoddess and attend in her airy Chariot at her Chamberwindow where you say all the Graces wait so that you will not be displeased with your Company  Indeed she is under a Concern which you must supply for what Kind of Birds you will find to draw her Chariot for Doves and Peacocks she would scorn to borrow of  Venus  and  Juno  whom you make so much her Inferiors  Here she put on a Royal Air We will conclude Our own Letter Ourself said she so taking Pen in Hand she writes as underneath  Don't let me when the Car is quite in Readiness be rudely disturbed But tell  Mercury  I would have him tap softly at my Window I will rise in all my Glory whip into my starry Calash and rush through the Regions of Light till despising Mortality we shall form some new Constellation which some happy Astrologer may perhaps in Honour of us both style  the Twinklers of Moorfields  When I have chosen my new Name I will deign to write it till when I can only style myself most obliging Sir  Your Celestial  c  LETTER XC Against a young Lady's affecting manly Airs and also censuring the modern Ridinghabits  Dear  Betsey  THE Improvement that is visible in your Person since your going to  Bury  gives me much Pleasure and the dawning of fine Sense and a  good Judgment that discovers itself in your Conversation makes me hope to see every Perfection of my Sister your late excellent Mother revived in you  Yet one thing the Duty of a tender Uncle obliges me to blame in you and that is a certain Affectation that of late obtains in your Behaviour of imitating the Manners of the other Sex and appearing more masculine than either the amiable Softness of your Person or Sex can justify  I have been particularly offended let me tell you my Dear at your  new Ridinghabit  which is made so extravagantly in the Mode that one cannot easily distinguish your Sex by it For you neither look like a  modest Girl  in it nor an  agreeable Boy  Some Conformity to the Fashion is allowable But a cock'd Hat a lac'd Jacket a Fop's Peruke what strange Metamorphoses do they make And then the  Air  assumed with them so  pert  and so  insipid  at the same time makes upon the whole such a  Boygirl  Figure that I know of nothing that would become either the  Air  or the  Dress  but a young  Italian  Singer For such an one being neither  Man  nor  Woman  would possibly be best distinguished by this Hermaphrodite Appearance  In short I would have you remember my Dear that as sure as any thing intrepid free and in a prudent Degree bold becomes a Man so whatever is soft tender and modest renders your Sex amiable In this one Instance we do not prefer our own Likeness and the less you resemble us the more you are sure to charm For a  masculine Woman  is a Character as little creditable as becoming  I am no Enemy to a proper Presence of Mind in Company but would never have you appear  bold talkative or assured Modesty in the outward Behaviour is a strong Prepossession in a Lady's Favour and without it all your Perfections will be of little Service either as to Reputation or Preferment You want not Sense and I hope will take kindly these wellintended Hints from  Your affectionate Uncle  LETTER XCI Letter of a Father to a Daughter relating to Three Persons of different Characters proposed to him each for her Husband With his Recommendation of one in Years  Dear  Polly  I HAVE three several Proposals made me on your Account and they are so particularly circumstanced that I cannot approve of one of them  The first is by Mr  Aldridge  for his Son  John  who you know is very weak in his Intellects and so apt to be misled that he wants a  Guardian  for him in a  Wife  and so does you the Reputation to think you a proper Person for that Office But I think the worst Weakness in the World in a Husband is that of  Intellect  and I should suffer much to have you linked to a Man who has no  Head  and is for that Reason highly unworthy to be yours A  foolish Wife  is much more tolerable because she can be  kept up  but a  foolish Husband  will do what he pleases and go where he pleases and tho' he knew nothing else will think he knows too much to be controuled by his Wife and will have  this  Lesson taught him by Rakes and  Libertines when he is capable of  no other  So I did not think it necessary so much as to consult you about him  The second is from Mr  Gough  for his Son  Richard  who has run thro' such a Course of Libertinism that he has hardly his Fellow and has neither a  sound Head  nor a  sound Body  and is so far from being reclaim'd that his Father proposes a Wife as the  last Hope  for him and yet knows not whether he will accept of one if one can be found that would venture upon him So I could not think of suffering my Daughter to stand either to the Courtesy or lie at the Mercy of so profligate a Rake tho' it seems he  vouchsafes  to  like  you better as his Father says than any one he ever saw which was the Reason of the old Man's Application to me  The third was from Mr  Tomkins  whose Nephew is as bad a  Sot  as the other is a  Rake  but who promises to reform if his Uncle can procure my Consent and yours But as you had refused his Overtures when made to  yourself  without consulting me and for the very Reasons  I  should have rejected him I would not trouble you about him but gave a total Denial to the Request of his Uncle who desired that the Matter might be brought on again by my Authority and Interposition  So my good Girl has had hard Fortune as one may say in the Offers of three Persons that it is impossible she should chuse out of One so very a  Fool  a second so profligate a  Rake  and the third so vile a  Sot  that there could be no Thought of any of the Three  But I have a  fourth  Affair to mention to you against which there can lie but one Objection and that is some Disparity in Years This is my good Friend Mr  Rowe  as honest a Man as ever  liv'd a Man of Prudence a Man of good Fortune and easy Circumstance Master of a genteel House and Business well respected by all the World and  most  by those who know him  best  a goodnatur'd Man humane compassionate and tho'  frugal  not a  Niggard  Now my dear Daughter What think you of Mr  Rowe  He has an high Opinion of your Prudence and Discretion but wishes  himself  that  you  were either Ten Years older or  he  Ten Years youngerYet he thinks if you can get over that Point he could make you one of the fondest of Husbands and that there is not any thing but he could and would oblige you in  I too my Dear wish there was a nearer Agreement in  Years  yet considering the Hazards a young Woman runs as the World goes from  Rakes Sots  and  Fools  of every Degree considering that in this Matter there is but  one  only thing to be wish'd for and that all the  grand Desirables  of Life will be so  well  supply'd considering too that he is a  sightly  a  neat  a  personable  Man and has good  Health  good  Spirits  and good  Humour  and is not yet got quite at the Top of the  Hill of Life  Considering all these Things I say I think that  one  Consideration might be given up for the  many  other  more  material ones which would be so well supply'd in this Match  Say my dear Daughter say freely what you think You'll much oblige me if you can get this Matter over But if you cannot and be so happy as I wish youwhy thenI don't know what to sayBut I mustI thinkacquiesce But yet I could once more wishBut I will say no more till I have your Answer but that I am  Your most indulgent Father  LETTER XCII Her Answer dutifully expostulating on the Case  Honoured Sir  I AM sensible of the Obligations which both Nature and Gratitude lay me under to obey your Commands and am willing to do so at all Events if what I have to offer be not thought sufficient to excuse my Compliance  Mr  Rowe  is I believe possessed of all the Merit you ascribe to him But be not displeased dear Sir when I say that he seems not so  proper  an Husband for me as for a Woman of more Years and Experience  His  advanced Years  give me leave to say will be far from being agreeable to  me  and will not my  Youth  or at least the  Effects  of it in some Particulars be distasteful to  him  Will not that  innocent Levity  which is almost inseparable from my Time of Life appear to him in a more despisable Light than perhaps it deserves For Sir is not a Likeness of Years attended with a Likeness of Manners a Likeness of Humours an Agreement in Diversions and Pleasures and Thinking too And can such Likenesses such Agreements be naturally expected where the Years on one Side  double  the Number of the other Besides Sir is not this Defect if I may so call it a Defect that will be far from mending by Time  Your great Goodness and the Tenderness I have always experienc'd from you have embolden'd me to speak thus freely upon a Concern that is of the highest Importance to my future Welfare  which I know you have in View from more solid Motives than I am capable of entertaining And if you still insist upon my Obedience I will only take the Liberty to observe that if I do marry Mr  Rowe  it will be  intirely  the Effect of my  Duty  to the best of Fathers and not of an  Affection  for a Gentleman that I respect in every other Light but that you propose him in And dear good Sir consider then what Misunderstandings and evil Consequences may possibly arise from hence and render unhappy the future Life of  Your most dutiful Daughter  I am greatly obliged to you Sir that you refused without consulting me the three strange Overtures you mention  LETTER XCIII His Reply urgently inforcing but not compelling her Compliance with his Desire  Dear  Polly  I AM far from taking amiss what you have written in Answer to my Recommendation of my worthy Friend Mr  Rowe  and I am sure if I was to shew him your Letter he would never permit you to be urged more on this Head But my Dear I own my Wishes and my Heart are engaged in  his  shall I say or in  your own  Favour And I would hope that notwithstanding all you have written your good Sense and that Discretion for which you have been hitherto so deservedly noted may on mature Reflection enable you to overcome the Objection that would be insuperable to lighter and airier Minds of your Sex  Such is the Profligateness of the Generality of young Fellows of the present Age that I own I look into the World with Affrightment at the Risques which a virtuous young Woman has to encounter with on a Change of Condition which makes me dwell upon the Point with the greater Earnestness And you know my Dear I can have no Motive but your Good  Then Child consider the Reputation this Match to all who know Mr  Rowe  's Worth will bring to your  Prudence  and even to your  Sex  For it is as much Credit to a  young Lady  to marry a worthy Man  older than herself  as it is  Discredit  for an  old Woman  to marry a young Man Does my  Polly  take my Meaning The Case is plain Besides nobody thinks Ten or Twelve Years Difference in a Man's Age any thing out of the way So my Dear it is not  Twenty  Years Odds it is only  Ten  at  most  Then again he is a goodnatur'd Man there's a great deal in  that  you know  To be sure my Dear it is my good Opinion of your  Prudence  that makes me endeavour to persuade you to this And I could be glad methinks to find that I have not too high a Notion of  your  Discretion in the Preference I am willing to give it to that of all the young Ladies I know  But if I am mistaken I mean if you cannot get over this  one  Difficulty I shall be apt to think so surmountable does it seem to me that you have seen somebody you like and are prepossess'd Yet I cannot believe that neither because you know I have so tender a Regard for your own Option that you would have made me acquainted with it  Yet after all far be it from me to compel your Inclinations But if you should be so happy as to  think with me that the many valuable Qualitics Mr  Rowe  is possessed of are scarcely to be hoped for in a younger Man as the World now goes you would make me very happy and I am persuaded you will never repent your Choice  One thing more let me urge my Dear for you see how my Heart's upon it How many very virtuous young Maidens have married for the sake of  Riches  only a Man much older much more disagreeable waspish humoursome diseased decrepit and yet have lived Years without Reproach and made themselves not unhappy And will not my dear Daughter do as much to  oblige her Father  and where Health Goodnature Wisdom Discretion and great Circumstances meet to  enforce  the Argument as others would do where not one of these Advantages are in the Case except the single Article of  Riches  Only then my Dear let Mr  Rowe  attend you two or three times before you absolutely set yourself against him And as I hope your Affections are intirely disengaged you will soon see whether his Conversation or Proposals will not incline you in his Favour considering all things that is to say considering the  one  thing AGAINST him and the  many  FOR him And if it cannot be I will intirely acquiesce being ever studious of your Happiness as becomes  Your indulgent Father  LETTER XCIV To a rich Widow Lady with Children dissuading her from marrying a Widower of meaner Degree who has Children also  Dear Madam  IT is with some Reluctance and great Respect that I prevail on myself to give you this Trouble The frequent Visits Mr  Clarkson  makes you and the Airs that Gentleman gives himself have given Birth to a Report that a Treaty of Marriage between you is on foot and that in all Probability it will be soon brought to Effect  To be sure Mr  Clarkson  is not to be blam'd to endeavour to procure for his Wife a Lady of your Prudence good Character and Fortune but whether you will be able to avoid the Censure of the World if you chuse  him  for a Husband is another Point which greatly concerns you to consider of and affects me and all who wish you well  His Fortune Madam is not equal to yours supposing it to be better than the World reports it He has Children So have you What Inconveniencies may not arise from hence Especially as he is not thought to be one of the best and smoothesttemper'd Men in the WorldHis Character is not equal in any respect to say the least for I would not detract from any Man's Merit to that of your late good Spouse my dear Friend who would have been much grieved if he had had but the least Apprehension that the Man he would not have accompany'd with should succeed him in his Bed  Far be it from me dear Madam if you are so disposed as to wish to hinder you from a Change  of Condition with a suitable Person But as your late Spouse left  his  and  your  Children so much in your Power methinks you should take especial Care how and to whom you communicate any Part of that Power and thereby give a  Right  to controul not only  them  but yourself Must  he  not be partial to  his own  Children And will he not expect that your Complaisance to him should make  you  so too or at least be his Childrens Behaviour what it will that it shall induce you to put them upon a  Par  with your own His Daughters will be Spies upon your Conduct and be you ever so kind to them will always suspect your Partiality to your own and treat you as their  Motherinlaw  and their Father will believe all they shall suggest for  that  very Reason and because he will  judge  tho' perhaps not  allow for  that you  ought  to prefer  your own  to  his  And this will be the Source of perpetual Uneasinesses between you Consider dear Madam whether your late affectionate Spouse deserved from you that  his  Children and  your own  should be put upon such Difficulties in Favour of those of  any other  Person whatever  No doubt but you may make your own Conditions with Mr  Clarkson  He will be glad to call you and your Fortune  his  upon any Terms But consider Madam how difficult it may be whatever Articles you make for a good Wife who has been accustom'd to think  her  Interest the  same  with that of her  Husband  to refuse to his  Importunities  and perhaps to his  Conveniency  if not  Necessities  those Communications of Fortune which you may reserve in your own Power when they will make him  easier  in Circumstance and  more complaisant  in Temper And how hard it will be to deny a Man  any thing  to whom you have given your  Person  and to whom you have vowed  Duty  and  Obedience  But if you should have the Resolution to  refuse  him what he may not be backward to  ask  do you think yourself so well able to bear that  Indifference  if not  worse  which such a Refusal may occasion And would you chuse to have Advantage taken of your  tenderest Hours  either to induce you to acquiesce with Importunities which comply'd with may hurt your  Children  or to have those tender Moments dash'd with Suspicions of  Selfishness  and  Design  for Prudence will oblige you to be on your Guard that even the  highest Acts  of  Kindness  and the  strongest Professions  of  Affection  may not be preparative Arts to obtain from you Concessions you  ought  not to make And how will the pure Joys which flow from an  unsuspected  Union of Minds and Interests the Want whereof will make  any  Matrimony unhappy be found in a State thus circumstantiated  If Madam you are bent upon a Change of Condition your Friends would wish first that you will be pleased absolutely to ascertain the Fortunes of your Children according to the  Design  and  Will  of their  dear Father  as far as may  legally  be done either by chusing Trustees for them or by such other way as shall put it out of a  new  Husband's Power to hurt them And when he shall know this  is done  you will have a better Testimony of his Affection as he will know what  is  and what  is not  yours and can hope for no more because it is not in your Power to give more But how much more is it to be wished for your own sake as well as your Childrens that if you do change it may be with a Person who has  no  Children And then what  other  Children may be the Results of your  new Marriage  they will be  your own  as well as  his  and so be  more properly  intitled to your  Care  and your  Kindness  than any Man's Children by  another Wife  can be  By this means Madam most of the Uneasinesses we every Day see in Families where are  two Sorts  of Children will be prevented or perhaps your present Children will be grown up and out of the way before the other can  interfere  essentially with them or if  not  they will be  naturalized  as one may say to  each other  and having the  same  Mother who has an  equal  Interest in them  all  will  expect  and  allow for  an  equal  Exertion of Tenderness and Favour to  all  I will trouble you with no more at present on this Head and am confident that when you consider maturely what I have written and the respectful Manner in which I have ventur'd to give my Opinion and my own Disinterestedness besides and that I might still have urged other powerful Motives which I forbear in  Honour  to you you will have the Goodness to excuse the Liberty I have taken which is so suitable to the Laws of  Friendship  by which I am bound to be dear Madam  Your zealous Wellwisher and humble Servant  Instructions to young Orphan Ladies as well as others how to judge of Proposals of Marriage made to them without their Guardians or Friends Consent by their Milaners Mantuamakers or other Gobetweens  A YOUNG Orphan Lady of an independent Fortune receivable at Age or Day of Marriage will hardly sail of several Attempts to engage her Affections And the following general Rules and Instructions will be of Use to her on these Occasions  In the first place she ought to mistrust all those who shall seek to set her against her Guardian or those Relations to whom her Fortune or Person is intrusted And next to be apprehensive of all such as privately want to be introduced to her and who avoid treating with her Guardian first for his Consent For she may be assur'd that if a young Man has Proposals to make which he himself thinks would be accepted by a Person of  Years  and  Experience  he will apply in a regular way to her Friends but if he has not he will hope to engage the young Lady's Affections by the means of her  Milaner  her  Mantuamaker  or her  Servant  and so by Bribes and Promises endeavour to make his way to her Favour in order to take Advantage of her Youth and Inexperience For this is the constant Method of  Fortunehunters  to which many a worthy young Lady of good Sense and good Fortune has owed her utter Ruin  The following are generally the Methods taken by this Set of Designers  These industrious Gobetweens who hope to make a Market of a young Lady's Affections generally by Letter or Word of Mouth if they have Opportunity set forth to the young Lady  "That there is a certain young Gentleman of  great Merit  of a  handsome Person  and  fine Expectations  or  prosperous Business  who is fallen deeply in Love with her And very probably the young Lady having no bad Opinion of herself and loving to be admired believes it very easily"  "That he has seen her at  Church  or the  Opera  the  Play  the  Assembly  c and is impatient to make known his Passion to her"  "That he is unwilling to apply to her  Guardian  till he  knows  how his Address will be received by  herself  "  "That besides it may very probably be the Case that her Guardian may form Obstacles which may not be reasonable on  her Part  to give into"  "That if he has  Daughters  of his own he would perhaps rather see them marry'd  first  "  "That he may not care to part with her  Fortune  and the  Reputation  and  Convenience  the  Management  of it may give him"  "That he may design to marry her when he  thinks proper  to some Person agreeable to his  own  Interest or Inclinations without consulting  hers  as he ought"  "That therefore it would be best that her Guardian should know  nothing  of the Matter till she saw whether she could approve the Gentleman or not"  "That even  then  she might  encourage  his Address or  disccountenance  it as she  pleased  "  "That for her the  Proposer  's part she had  no Interest  in the world one way or other and no  View  but to serve the young Lady and to oblige a young Gentleman so well qualify'd to make her happy"  And suchlike plausible Assurances ending perhaps  "with desiring to bring on an  Interview  or if that will not be admitted that she will receive a Letter from him"  This kind of Introduction ought always to be suspected by a prudent young Lady She ought with  Warmth  and  Resentment  to discourage the  officious Proposer  She ought to acquaint her  "That she is resolved never to give way to a Proposal of this Importance without the  Consent  and  Approbation  of her  Guardian  or  Friends  "  "That her good Father or Mother who had  seen the World  and had  many Years  Experience of her Guardian's  Honour  and  Qualifications  for such a Trust knew what they did when they put her under his Care"  "That he had always shewn an  honest  and  generous  Regard for her Welfare"  "That she took it very unkindly of the Proposer to offer to inspire her with  Doubts  of his  Conduct  when she had  none  herself nor  Reason  for any"  "That it was Time enough when he gave her  Reason  to be apprehensive of his sinister Designs or of his preferring his  own  Interest to  hers  "  "That it was a very strange Attempt to make her mistrust a  Friend  a  Relation  a  Gentleman  who was chosen for this Trust by her  dear Parents  on  many Years Experience  of his Honour and Probity and of whose Goodness to her  for so long time  past she herself had many Proofs And this in Favour of a Person who had a  visible Interest  to induce him to this Application whose  Person  she hardly  knew  if  at all  whose  Professions  she could not  judge  of who began by such mean such groundless such unworthy Insinuations Who  might  or  might not  be the Person he pretended and who wanted to induce her to prefer  himself  on  no  Acquaintance at all to a  Gentleman  she had so many Years  known  and whose  Honour  good  Character Reputation  and  Conscience  were all engaged to her as so many Pledges for his honourable Behaviour to her"  "That she the  Proposer  and the young Gentleman  too  must have a very indifferent Opinion of her  Gratitude  her  Prudence  her  Discretion  to make such an Attempt upon her"  "That if he could approve himself to a Man of  Years  and  Experience  who was not to be imposed upon by  blind Passion  in the Light he wanted to appear in to  her  why should he not apply to  him first  "  "That surely it was a very  ungenerous  as well as  suspicious  Method of Proceeding that he could find no  other way  to give her an Opinion of  himself  but by endeavouring to depreciate the Character of a  Gentleman  who by this Method plainly appeared to his  own Apprehension  to stand in the way of his Proceedings and  that too  before he had  try'd him  and which shewed that he himself had not hope of succeeding but by  Arts  of  Delusion Flattery  and a  clandestine Address  and had nothing but her  own Inadvertence  and  Inexperience  to build upon"  "That therefore it behoved her had she  no other  Reason to reject with  Resentment  and  Disdain  a Conduct so affrontive to her  Understanding  as well as  selfish  and  ungenerous  in the Proposer"  "That therefore she would not countenance any  Interview  with a Person  capable  of acting in such a manner nor receive any  Letter  from him"  "And lastly that she desires never to hear of this Matter again from her the  Proposer  if she would have her retain for her that good Opinion which she had hitherto had"  This prudent Reasoning and Conduct will make the Intervener quit her Design upon the young Lady if she is not wholly abandoned of all Sense of Shame and corrupted by high Bribes and Promises and in this Case the young Lady will judge how unfit such a Person is either for her  Confident  or  Acquaintance  Nor will the Lady lose an humble Servant  worthy  of being  retain'd  or  encouraged  For  if he be the Person he  pretends  he will directly apply to her  Guardian  and have a high Opinion of  her  Prudence and Discretion and if she hears no more of him she may conclude he could not make good his Pretensions to a Person of  Discernment  and will have Occasion to rejoice in escaping his designing Arts with so little Trouble to herself  If a Lady has had actually a Letter delivered her from such a Pretender and that by means of a Person who has any Share in her Confidence and wants a Form of a Letter to send to the Recommender to discourage the Proceeding the following which has been sent with good Effect on a like Occasion may be proper  LETTER XCV  Mrs  Pratt  I INCLOSE the Letter you put into my Hands and hope it will be the last I shall ever receive from you or any body else on the like Occasion I am intirely satisfied in the Care and Kindness of my Guardian and shall encourage no Proposal of this sort but what comes recommended to me by  his  Approbation He knows the World I do not and that which is not fit for  him  to  know  is not fit for  me  to  receive  and I am sorry either you or the Writer looks upon me in so weak a Light as to imagine I would wish to take myself out of the Hands of so  experienced  a  Friend  to throw myself into those of a  Stranger  Yet I would not as this is the first Attempt of the kind from you and that it may rather be the Effect of Inconsideration than Design shew it my Guardian because he would not perhaps impute it to so favourable a Motive in you as I am willing to do being  Your Friend and Servant  If there be no Gobetween but that a young Fellow takes upon himself to send Letters to teize a young Lady to encourage his Address by his romantick Professions of his Affection and Regard for her and attributing such Perfections to her as no one Woman ever had and if she is desirous but knows not how to get rid of his troublesome Importunity and that even a contemptuous Silence which it is prudent for a young Lady to shew on such an Occasion has no Effect upon him nor yet that he will desist tho' she returns his Letters  unopen'd  or in a  blank Cover  after she happens to have read them then let the Lady get some Friend to write to him looking upon him as beneath her own Notice for even a  Denial  if given in  Writing  under  her own Hand  will encourage some presumptuous Men or at least they may make some Use of it to the Lady's Disadvantage and ought not to have it to boast that they have received a Letter from her tho' ever so much to their own Discredit if it were shewn And the following may be the Form  LETTER XCVI  SIR  YOU have thought fit to write to Miss  Knollys  twice or thrice in a very troublesome manner She cannot possibly so far forget what belongs to Herself and Character as to answer you any other way than by the Contempt of Silence Yet since she cannot it seems be free from your Impertinence she wishes you may be told That you must have as mean an Opinion of  her  Judgment as all who read your Epistles must have of  yours  if you can expect Success from such inconsistent Rhapsodies  I will from myself venture to give you one Piece of Advice That the next Person you pretend to address with your bright Compositions you don't in them forget one Ingredient which is  common Sense  tho' you should be forced to borrow it I am  Yours unknown  Or if this be thought too affronting the following  LETTER XCVII  SIR  YOU are desired to send no more of your elaborate Epistles to Miss  Knollys  You are quite mistaken in the Lady She knows  herself  and by your Letter she knows  you  so well that she sends it back that you may find some other Person to send it to whose Sentiments and Understanding are better proportion'd to your own I am Sir  c  If the Letters of the young Fellow deserve less Severity and are such as have not their Foundation in Romance and Bombast but yet the Lady thinks not proper to encourage his Address this Form may serve  LETTER XCVIII  SIR  I AM desir'd to acquaint you that Miss  Knollys  thinks herself obliged to every one who has a good Opinion of her but begs that you will not  ve yourself or her the Trouble of any more  etters For Things are so circumstanced that  she has neither Inclination nor Power to encourage your Address I am Sir  Your humble Servant unknown  If the Lady has a mind to rebuke the Attempt of a clandestine Address to her and yet thinks the Proposal not absolutely unworthy of Attention did it come  regularly  to her by means of her  Father Mother Guardian  c this Form may be observed  LETTER XCIX  SIR  MISS  Knollys  desires you should be informed which she presumes you did not know That she can never think herself at her own Disposal while she has so near and so good a Friend to advise with as Mr  Archer  whose Wisdom she much prefers to her own as his Experience in the World and Kindness to her make him deserve to be consulted in all her Affairs of Moment Whatever shall appear fit to him will have great Weight with her and there is but that one possible way to engage her Attention I am Sir  Yours  c  Or if the Lady has not a Guardian or Father or Mother but some Friend in whom she can conside the following may be a proper Form  LETTER C  SIR  IT may not be amiss to acquaint you that Miss  Knollys  is so happy as to have a Friend of Experience and Probity without whose Advice she  undertakes nothing of Consequence It is Mr  Salter  of  Gracechurchstreet  And she will not care to admit of any Proposal of Moment to her that has not passed his Approbation This she hopes will save her and yourself the Trouble of any further Applications I am  Your humble Servant  Or this  LETTER CI  SIR  MR  Salter  of  Gracechurchstreet  being a Gentleman that Miss  Knollys  consults in all her Affairs she refers to him all Proposals that are or may be of Importance to her and desires to receive no more Letters or Messages from you by any other Hand I am  Your humble Servant unknown  LETTER CII From a TownTenant to his Landlord excusing Delay of Payment  Honoured Sir  I AM under a great Concern that I cannot at present answer your just Expectations I have sustained such heavy Losses and met with such great Disappointments of late that I must intrude another Quarter on your Goodness Then whatever Shifts I am put to you shall hear to more Satisfaction than at present from Sir  Your most obliged humble Servant  LETTER CIII From a Country Tenant to the same Purpose  Honoured Sir  THE Season has been so bad and I have had such unhappy Accidents to encounter with in a sick Family Loss of Cattle  c  that I am obliged to trespass upon your Patience a Month or two longer The Wheatharvest I hope will furnish me the Means to answer your just Expectations which will be a great Contentment to  Your honest Tenant and humble Servant  LETTER CIV The Landlord's Answer  Mr  Jacobs  I HAVE yours I hope you'll be as good as your Word at the Expiration of the Time you have mentioned I am unwilling to distress any  honest  Man and I hope that I shall not meet with the  worse  Usage for my Forbearance For  Lenity  abused even in generous Tempers provokes Returns that some People would call  severe  but should not be deemed such if  just  I am  Yours  c  LETTER CV A threatening Letter from a Steward on Delay of Payment  Mr  Atkins  I HAVE mentioned your Case to Sir  John  as you requested He is exceedingly provoked at your Usage and swears bloodily he'll seize and throw you into Gaol if he has not  l  at least paid him by Quarterday which is now at hand so you know what you have to trust to and I would have you avoid the Consequences at any rate for he is resolved otherwise to do as he says Of this I assure you who am  Yours  c  LETTER CVI The poor Tenant's moving Answer  Good Mr  Taverner  I AM at my Wits end almost on what you write But if I  am  to be ruined with my numerous Family and a poor industrious but  ailing  Wife how can I help it For I cannot possibly raise  l  any manner of way by the Time you mention I hope Sir  John  won't be so hardhearted For if God Almighty our  common  Landlord should be  equally  hard upon us what would become of us  all  Forgive my Boldness to talk of God Almighty to his  Honour  in this free manner  I would do it if it was to be done but you know Sir what a  Season  we have had And an honester Tenant his Honour will never have that I am sure of But if Money  won't  rise what can I  do  Should I sell my Team and my Utensils for Labour there is an End of  all  I shall have no Means left me then wherewith to pay his  Honour  or  any body  else If his Honour will not be moved but  will  seize pray good Mr  Taverner  prevail on him not to throw me into Gaol for a Prison pays no Debts but let my poor Wife and Six small Children lie in the Barn till I can get a little Daylabour for that must be all I can have to trust to if his Honour seizes I hear my Man  William  that was has just taken a Farm may be he will employ his poor ruin'd Master if I am not  prison'd  But if I be why then the Parish must do something for my poor Children tho' I hoped they would never trouble it Lay these things before his Honour good Sir and forgive this Trouble from  His Honour's honest tho' unfortunate Tenant  LETTER CVII The Steward's Reply giving more Time  Mr  Atkins  I HAVE laid your Letter and your Case before Sir  John  He is moved with it and says he will have Patience another Quarter to see what you'll do Consider Man however that Gentlemen live at a great Expence are obliged to keep up their Port and if their Tenants fail  them  why then they must fail their  Tradesmen  and suffer in their  Credit  You have good Crops of all Kinds on the Ground and surely may by next  Quarter  raise or l tho' you could not raise l in a  Fortnight  This Sir  John  will expect at least I  can tell you And you may comply with it from the Produce of so good a Farm surely I am  Yours  c  LETTER CVIII The poor Man's thankful Letter in Return  GOD bless his Honour and God bless you Mr  Taverner  that's all I can say We will now set our Hands to the Plough as the Saying is with chearful Hearts and try what can be done I am sure I and my Wife and Children too tho' three of them can but lisp their Prayers shall Morning Noon and Night pray to God for his Honour's Health and Prosperity as well as for you and yours and to enable me to be just to his Expectations I'm sure it would be the Pride of my Heart to pay every body his Honour especially I have not run behindhand for want of Industry that all my Neighbours know but Losses and Sickness I could not help and nobody could live more frugal and sparing than both my Wife and I Indeed we have hardly allowed ourselves Cloaths to our Backs nor for our Children neither tight and clean and wholsome as they may appear to those who see them And we will continue to live so low as may only keep us in Heart to do our Labour until we are got beforehand which God grant But all this I told you before Mr  Taverner  and so will say no more but I will do all I can and God give a Blessing to my Labours as I mean honestly So no more but that I am Sir  Your everobliged Servant  LETTER CIX An Offer of Assistance to a Friend who has received great Losses by a Person's Failure  Dear Sir  I AM exceedingly concerned at the great Loss which you have lately sustained by the Failure of Mr  Tranter  I hope you behave under it like the Man of Prudence you have always shewn yourself and as one who knows how liable all Men are to Misfortunes I think it incumbent on this Occasion not to console you by Words  only  but in the Spirit and with the Chearfulness of a most sincere Friend to offer my Service to answer any  present  Demand so far as  l  goes which you shall have the Use of freely for a Twelvemonth or more if your Affairs require it and will even strain a Point rather than not oblige you if  more  be necessary to your present Situation You'll do me great Pleasure in accepting this Offer as  freely  as it is  kindly  meant by dear Sir  Your's most faithfully  LETTER CX The Friend's Answer accepting the kind Offer  My dear Friend  HOW shall I find Words to express the grateful Sense I have of your Goodness This is an Instance of true Friendship indeed I accept most thankfully of some Part of your generous Offer and will give you my Bond payable in a Year for l which is at present all I have Occasion  for and if I did not know I could then if not before answer your Goodness as it deserves I would not accept of the Favour This Loss is very heavy and affecting to me as you may suppose yet your generous Friendship is no small Comfort to me in it For so good a Friend is capable of making any Calamity light I am dear Sir  Your most faithful and obliged humble Servant  LETTER CXI The Friend's Answer supposing he has no Occasion  Dear Sir  A THOUSAND Thanks to you for your generous Offer and kind Advice I have been not a little affected at the unexpected Failure of a Man all the World thought as good as the Bank But at present I have no Occasion for your friendly Assistance If I should I know no one in the World I would sooner chuse to be obliged to for I am dear kind Sir  Your most obliged humble Servant  LETTER CXII Of Consolation to a Friend in Prison for Debt  Dear Sir  I AM exceedingly concerned to hear that the Severity of your Creditors has laid you under Confinement But there is one Comfort results from it that the utmost Stretch of their Revenge cannot carry them farther and that when a Man is got to the undermost Part of Fortune's Wheel he  may  rise but  cannot  sink lower You now know the worst and have nothing to do but to support your Misfortune with that true Magnanimity which becomes a noble Mind Long very long have you been labouring under great Difficulties and so have been enured to Misfortunes and you have  looked forward  with such Anxiety and Pain to the hard Lot that has now befallen you that 'tis impossible the  bearing  of it can be equal to the  Apprehensions  you had of it You see all around you too many unhappy Objects reduced to the same Distress and you see them either extricating themselves from those Difficulties as I hope you soon will or learning to bear them with a true Christian Resignation For well does the wise Man observe that  the Race is not to the Swift nor the Battle to the Strong nor Riches to a Man of Understanding  And it will yield you some Consolation when you reflect that  this  Life is but a State of  Probation  and he that meets with Misfortunes  here  may by a  proper Use  of them and by  God's Grace  be intitled to a blessed Hope when a  prosperous State  may make a Man forgetful of his Duty and so reap no other Good but what he finds in this  transitory  Life Remember my Friend that the  School of Affliction  is the  School of Wisdom  and so behave under this  trying  Calamity as to say with the Royal Prophet  It is good for me that I was afflicted  I think myself however not a little unhappy that my Circumstances will not permit me to assist you on this grievous Occasion in the way a Friend would chuse to do if he was able but if by my personal Attendance on any of your Creditors or Friends I can do you Pleasure or Service I beg you to command me For in whatever is in my poor Power I am and shall ever be  Your faithful Friend and Servant  LETTER CXIII In Answer to the preceding  Dear Sir  I NOW experience fully the Truth of the honest  English  Phrase That  a Friend in Need is a Friend in Deed  You have filled me with such unspeakable Comfort to find that I am not abandoned by  all  my old Acquaintance that in a great measure your seasonable Kindness will enable me to pursue the Advice you give me  It is too late to look back now on the Steps that have brought me to this abject Condition No doubt were I to live my Life over again I could do much better for myself than I have done and should hardly run into some of the Failings that have help'd to bring such heavy Misfortunes upon me But my Comfort is I ever had an  honest Intention  and never was a  Sot  or a  Spendthrist  But yet who knows if I had avoided  some  Mistakes that I might not have fallen into  as bad  another way So I must acquiesce in the Dispensation and pray to God in his own good Time to deliver me from it  What is most grievous to me in this Matter is my  poor Wife  and  Children  who have deserved a happier Fate had it been in my Power to have done better for them than now I am ever likely to do  As to your kind Offer my dear Friend I will beg to see you as often as may not be detrimental to  your own  Affairs I care not how seldom I see my dear Wife Neither  her  Heart nor  mine  can bear the Grief that oppresses us when we think of our  happier  Days and Prospects and see them all  concluded  within these  Bars  and  Bolts  and  Lattices  so that we sink one another still lower every doleful Visit the dear good Woman makes me But  your  Visits my Friend will be of singular Use and Comfort to  me  as your Presence and kind Advice will be to  her  as often as you can to save us both the Mortification of seeing one another so often as my Affairs will otherwise require her to come to this dismal Place for I cannot open my Mind to any body but you and her I will also get you to go to Mr  Maddox  my principal Creditor and one or two more I will tell you about what and only fear I shall be too troublesome to you But you are so kind as to offer your Service in this way and I am reduced to the sad Necessity of pushing myself upon you without the least Hope of ever having it in my Power to shew you as I wish to do how much I am  Your grateful tho' unhappy Servant  LETTER CXIV To a Person of Note in Acknowledgment of great Benefits received  Honoured Sir  PERMIT me to approach you with the thankful Acknowledgments of a grateful Heart on the Favour and Benefit your Goodness has conferred upon me It shall be the Business of my whole Life to the utmost of my Power to deserve it and my whole Family which you have made happy by your Bounty will every Day join with me in Prayers to God to bless you with the Continuance of your valuable Health a long  Life and all worldly Honour for so it will become us to do for the unmerited Favours conferr'd upon honoured Sir  Your most dutiful Servant  LETTER CXV Another for Favours of not so high yet of a generous Nature  Worthy Sir  I SHOULD appear ungrateful if I did not add this further Trouble to those I have already given you of acknowledging your Goodness to me in this last Instance of it May God Almighty return to you Sir one hundredfold the Benefit you have conferr'd upon me and give me Opportunity by my future Services to shew my grateful Heart and how much I am worthy Sir  Your forever obliged and dutiful Servant  LETTER CXVI An Excuse to a Person who wants to borrow Money  SIR  I AM very sorry that your Request comes to me at a time when I am so press'd by my own Affairs that I cannot with any Conveniency comply with it I hope Sir you will therefore excuse  Your most humble Servant  LETTER CXVII On the same Subject  SIR  I HAVE on an urgent Occasion been obliged to borrow a Sum of Money myself within ten Days past Hence you'll judge of my Want of  Capacity  rather than  Inclination  to comply with your Request For I am  Your sincere Friend  LETTER CXVIII On the same Subject  SIR  IT is with no little Pain that I am obliged to lay open to you on occasion of the Loan you request of me my own Inability I shall make very hard Shift to answer some necessary Demands which must be comply'd with by a certain Time and so can only say I am sorry I have it not in my Power to shew you how sincerely I am  Your most humble Servant  LETTER CXIX To a Friend in Compliance with his Request to borrow a Sum of Money  SIR  YOU have highly obliged me in the Request you make me I most chearfully comply with it and inclose a Note for the requested Sum payable on Sight and am not a little glad it is in my Power to shew you how much I am  Your faithful Friend and Servant  LETTER CXX Another on the same Occasion limiting the Repayment to a certain Time  SIR  THE Intimation you give me that the Sum of Pounds will be of great Use to you and that you shall be able to repay it in Four Months makes me resolve to put myself to some Difficulty to oblige you Accordingly I inclose a Bank Note to that Amount But I must in the  Name of Friendship  beg of you to return it me  unused  if you think you cannot keep your Word in the Repayment for my accommodating you with this Sum is rather at present a greater Testimony of my  Inclination  than  Ability  to serve you For I am  Your affectionate Friend and Servant  LETTER CXXI To a Friend on a Breach of Promise in not returning Money lent in his Exigence  SIR  WHEN you apply'd to me in your Streights for Assistance and made such strong Promises of returning in Four Months what I advanced little did I think you would give me the irksome Occasion either of reminding you of your Promise or of acquainting you with the Streights in which my Friendship for you has involv'd myself I have always endeavour'd to manage my Affairs with so much Prudence as to keep  within myself  the Power  of answering Demands upon me without troubling my  Friends  and I told you I must expect you would keep your Word exactly to the Four Months or else I should be distress'd as bad as you were when you apply'd to me  Six  Months passed and you took no manner of Notice of the Matter when I was forced to remind you of it having been put to it as I told you I should You took a  Fortnight  longer under still stronger Promises of Performance And  Three Weeks  are now expired and your  second  Promises are still as much to be performed as your  first  Is this kind is this friendly is it  grateful  Sir let me ask you And ought I to be made to suffer in  my  Credit who was so ready to save  yours  When too mine had been in no Danger had I not put out of my own Power what actually was then in it I will only say That if any Consideration remains with you for one so truly your Friend let me immediately be paid and take from me the cruel Necessity of reproaching  you  for Ingratitude and  myself  for Folly Who am Sir  Your unkindly used  c  LETTER CXXII To a Friend who had promised to lend a Sum of Money to answer a critical Exigence and drove it off to the last  Dear Sir  YOU were so kind as to tell me a Fortnight ago that you would lend me One hundred Pounds on my Bond to answer a Demand that my Credit would be otherwise a Sufferer by And you were pleased to say you would have me look no  further and that I should certainly have it in time I have looked no further Sir and the Day of Payment approaching you cannot imagine how my Mind has suffered by being not  absolutely sure  of having the Money to answer the Demand I hope Sir nothing has happen'd to make you alter your Mind for at this short Notice I shall not know to whom to apply to raise it In the utmost Perturbation of Mind for fear of the worst my Credit being wholly at Stake I beg your Answer which I hope will be to the Satisfaction of Sir  Your obliged humble Servant  LETTER CXXIII The Answer excusing the Pain he had given his Friend by his Remissness  Dear Sir  I WILL attend you this Afternoon with the Money which I had always great Pleasure in the Thought of supplying you with and I am most heartily vexed with myself for giving you the Pain and Uneasiness that must have attended a Mind so punctual as yours and in a Case so critically circumstanced But I hope you'll forgive me tho' I can hardly forgive myself I am Sir as well on this as on any other Occasion in my Power  Your sincere Friend and Servant  LETTER CXXIV To one who upon a very short Acquaintance and without any visible Merit but Assurance wants to borrow a Sum of Money  SIR  YOU did me the Favour of inquiring for me two or three times while I was out of Town And among my Letters I find one from you desiring the Loan of Guineas You must certainly have mistaken  yourself  or  me  very much to think we were enough known to each other for such a Traniaction I was twice in your Company I was delighted with your Conversation You seemed as much pleased with mine And if we both acted with Honour the Obligation is mutual and there can be no room to suppose me your Debtor I have no churlish nor avaritious Heart I will venture to say but there must be Bounds to every thing and Discretion is as necessary in conferring as in receiving a Kindness To a Friend my helping Hand ought to be lent when his Necessities require it You cannot think our Intimacy enough to commence that Relation and should I answer the Demands of every  new Acquaintance  I should soon want Power to oblige my  old Friends  and even to serve  myself  Surely Sir a Gentleman of your Merit cannot be so little beloved as to be forced to seek to a new Acquaintance and to have no better Friend than one of  Yesterday  I will not do you the Injury to suppose that you have not  many  who have the  best  Reasons from long Knowledge to oblige you And by your Application to  me  I cannot think  Bashfulness  should stand in your way  to  them  Be this as it may it does not at all suit my Conveniency to comply with your Request and so I must beg you to excuse  Yours  c  LETTER CXXV A Gentleman to a Lady who humourously resents his Mistress's Fondness of a Monkey and Indifference to himself  Madam  I MUST be under the less Regret for the Contempt with which you receive my Addresses when your Favour is wholly engrossed by so wretched a Rival For ought a  rational Man  to wonder he is received with Neglect and Slight by a Lady who can be taken up with the Admiration of a  chattering  Monkey But pray be so good as to permit me to reason the Matter a little with you I would ask you then By what extraordinary Endowment this happy Creature has found Means to engross your Favour Extravagance is never commendable But while I am dying beneath your Frowns how can you be profuse in your Caresses to so mean a Competitor Condescend to view us in the same Light What valuable Qualification is Mr  Pug

I have a better Opinion of my  Dearest  than soBut Oh that I was in  his  Place  One  Kiss should not serve  my Turn  tho' I hope it  may his  Yet if he takes  two  I'll forgive him one for  me  and one for  himself  For I love  John  dearly and so you may  well  think Well what shall I say  more  Or rather what shall I say  next  For I have an hundred things crouding in upon me when I write to

Lover till Death  LETTER CXXVII Her Answer  Dear  William  FOR so I may call you now we are  sure  and so my Mother says This is to let you know that nothing shall prevail upon me to alter my Promise made to you when we parted With heavy Hearts enough that's true And yet I had a little Inkling given me that Mr  Alford  's Son the Carpenter would be glad to make Love to me But do you think I would suffer it No indeed For I doubt not your  Loyalty  to me and do you think I will not be as  loyal  to youTo be sure I will  These Sailors run such sad Chances  said one that you and I both know  They may return and they may not  Well I will trust in God for that who has returned safe to his Friends their dear  Billy  so many a time and often  They will have a Mistress in every Land they come to

Heart but  yours  God send us a happy Meeting Let who will speak against  Sailors  they are the Glory and the Safeguard of the Land And what would have become of  Old England  long ago but for  them  I am sure the lazy goodfornothing  Landlubbers  would never have protected us from our cruel Foes So Sailors are and ever shall be esteemed by me and of  all  Sailors my dear  Billy Oliver  Believe this Truth from  Your faithful  c  P S  I had this Letter writ in Readiness to send you as I had Opportunity And the Captain's Lady undertakes to send it with her's That is very kind and condescending Is it not  LETTER CXXVIII A SeaOfficer to his Wife  PortMahon  October  My dear Life  I TAKE the Opportunity afforded me by Captain  Copythorne  who is returning to  England  to let you know that I am in perfect Health at present God be praised tho' I have with many of the Crew been down of the  BloodyFlux  occasioned by being a little too free with the new Wines and Fruit of these Countries and yet I thought I was very moderate in both Our Captain continues very civil and kind and places his principal Confidence in me and I endeavour so to behave on the Occasion as to avoid incurring the Envy of every one and indeed have the good Fortune to be generally respected  Captain  Copythorne  is so kind as to carry to you a Token of my Affection which is a small Parcel of  Cyprus  Wine that I believe will be agreeable to your best Friend Mrs  Simpson  to whom therefore you may present half and keep the other for your own Use The Captain has also Fifty Dollars to present you with from me only paying out of them the  Duty for the Wine  for it is but  just  that it should be so if he cannot meet with Favour in so small a Parcel for what the Law of the Land which protects us all gives to the King is as much  his  Due however other  People act as any Part of my private Property which is secured to me by the  same Law  is  mine  And I am convinc'd that if every one acted up to this just Principle there need not be so many Taxes as there are and the fair Trader and all honest Men would be the better for it  I hope my dear  Jackey  and  Nancy  continue in good Health and dutiful and come on in their  Schooling  for that will stand them in stead perhaps when the poor Matters we are enabled to do for them may not be worth trusting to  I long to see my dear  Betty  God give us a happy Meeting if it be his blessed Will But I believe it will hardly be till we have humbled the proud  Jack Spaniard  Which God also grant For that Nation has been very vile and base to us honest  Englishmen  This concludes me at present  Your everloving Husband  Love and Service to all Friends  LETTER CXXIX A Wife to her Husband at Sea  My Dear  I Think it a long Time since I have had the Comfort and Satisfaction of hearing of your Welfare Often and often do I reflect on the Unhappiness of us poor Women who are marry'd to Seafaring Men Every  Wind  that blows every  Pirate  we hear of and now in  Time of War  every Hour of our Lives the Dread of  Enemies  alarms us God's Providence is our Reliance and so it ought for nothing else can sustain us thro' our different Apprehensions every Day we live But to be sure the Unhappiness is still greater to  such as love one another as we always did I hope when it shall please God to return you safe to my Wishes that you will take no more of these very long Voyages if you can help it The Trips to  Hotland  or  France  are so pretty that they rather add to than diminish one's Comforts But Oh these long long Voyages Yet in Time of War People cannot do as they will And I must be contented and the more when I see that the fine Ladies of Captains Commodores and Admirals are no better off than your poor  Jenny  We have had the Misfortune to lose Uncle  James  since you went He was a  Landman  out of the Dangers  you  run yet as I hope God has preserved  you  while  he  is dead and  gone  So we see there is nothing to be said for it when our Time is come They talk of my Aunt's marrying again and she has a Courtier comes to her because she is aforehand in the World and yet Uncle  James  has not yet been dead three Months Fie upon her I say tho' she is my Aunt for she had a good Husband of him As to you and I my Dear I hope God will spare us to one another for you are my  First  Love and shall be my  Last  Cousin  Barns  had the Misfortune to break his Leg but is in a good way  Jenny Adams  is to be marry'd next Week to  John Lascells  This is all the News among our Acquaintance for I am sure it is none to tell you that I am  Your faithful and loving Wife  LETTER CXXX To a Father on his Neglect of his Childrens Education  Dear Sir  I AM under a Concern to see such a Remissnes  as every body takes notice of in the Education of your Children They are brought up 'tis true to little Offices in your Business which keep them active and may make them in some degree of  present  tho'  poor  Use to  you  but I am sorry to say of  none  to  themselves  with regard to their  future Prospects  which is what a worthy Parent always has in View  There is a proper Time for every thing and Children are not early initiated into their D  and those Parts of Learning which are proper to their particular Years they must necessarily be discouraged and set behind every one of their School fellows tho' much younger than themselves and you know not Sir what a laudable Emulation you by this means destroy than which nothing is of greater Force to Children to induce them to attend to their Book nor what a Disgrace you involve them in with respect to Children among Children for the Biggest and Eldest to be so much outdone by the Least and Youngest  Nor is the Consequence of this Defect confin'd to the Schoolage as I may call it for as they grow up they will be look'd upon in an equally discouraging and disadvantageous Light by all who converse with them Which must of course throw them into the Company of the Dregs of Mankind for how will they be able to converse or correspond with those whose Acquaintance it is  most worth their while to cultivate And indeed they will probably be so conscious of their Unfitness to bear a Part in worthy Conversation that to keep themselves in Countenance they will of their own Accord shun the  better  Company and associate with the  worst  And what  may  be the Consequence of this a wise Man and a good Father would tremble to think of especially when he has to reflect upon himself as the  Cause  of it let it be what it will  Then Sir it is to be consider'd that without a tolerable Education they can be only fit for mean and sordid Employments Hear what the Wise Man says to this very Purpose  "How can he get Wisdom that holdeth the  Plough  and that glorieth in the  Goad  that driveth  Oxen  and is  occupied  in their Labours and whose Talk is of  Bullocks  He giveth his Mind to make  Furrows  and is diligent to give the  Kine Fodder  So every  Carpenter  and  Workmaster  that laboureth Night and DayThe  Smith  also sitting by the Anvil and considering the Ironwork the Vapour of the Fire wasteth his FleshThe  Noise  of the  Hammer  and the  Anvil  is ever in his EarsSo doth the  Potter  sitting at his Work and turning the Wheel about with his FeetHe fashioneth the Clay with his Arm and boweth down his Strength before his Feet"  These as he observes are useful in their Way but their Minds being  wholly  engrossed by their Labours  "they shall not be sought for in  publick Council  nor sit  high  in the  Congregation  they cannot declare  Justice  and  Judgment  and they shall not be found where  Parables  are spoken"  That is they shall be confined to the Drudgery of their own  servile Station  and will be intitled neither to  Honour  nor  Respect  as they might  have been had they had an Education to qualify them for more respectable Businesses And you will consider Sir in a closer Light as to us who live in the  present Age  and in this  great City  that there is hardly a  creditable  or  profitable  Employment in  London  where a tolerable Knowledge of  Accounts  and  Penmanship  in particular is not required Consider also what Opportunities they may lose by this Neglect of their Education in case they should fail in the Business they are put to of getting comfortable and genteel Bread in some Merchant's Comptinghouse or in some one of the several Offices about this great Metropolis as  Bookkeepers Clerks Accomptants  c  And with regard more immediately to  yourself  how can you expect when they know you could do better for them but that their Behaviour to  you  will be of a Piece with the rest for if they are not polish'd by Learning but are left to a kind of  Instinct  rather is it to be expected that they should behave to  you  and their  Mother  with that Sense of their Obligations which Learning inculcates Nor indeed will they  have  those Obligations to you which other Children have to  their  Parents who take care to give them Opportunities of Improvement which are deny'd to yours Consider dear Sir what a contemptible Character even among the sordid Vulgar that of an  illiterate Fellow  is and what Respect on the contrary a  Man of Letters  is treated with by his  Equals  as well as  Inferiors  And when you lay all these plain Reasons and Observations together I make no doubt but you will endeavour to retrieve lost Time and be advised in this material Point which I can have no Interest in by  Your sincere Friend and Servant  LETTER CXXXI From a young Maiden abandon'd by her Lover for the sake of a greater Fortune  Mr  John  I MUST take up my Pen and write tho' perhaps you will only scoff at me for so doing but when I have said what I have to say then I shall have eased my Mind and will endeavour to forget you for ever I have had so many Cautions given me against the false Hearts of Men and was so often told how they will vow and forswear themselves that I ought to have been on my Guard that's true And indeed so  I was  a great while You know it well But you courted me so long vowed so earnestly and seem'd so much in Love with me that it was first  Pity  in me that made me listen to you and Oh this  nasty Pity  how soon did it bringBut I won't say  Love  neither I thought if all the young Men in the World besides proved false yet it was impossible  you  should Ah poor silly Creature that I was to think tho' every body flatter'd me with being sightly enough I could hold a Heart so sordidly bent on  Interest  as I always saw  yours  to be but that thought I tho' 'tis a Meanness  I don't like  yet will it be a Security of his making a frugal Husband in an Age so fruitful of  Spendthrifts  But at length it has proved that you can prefer  Polly Bambridge  and leave  poor me  only because she has a greater Portion than I have  I say nothing against  Polly  I wish  her  well Indeed I do And I wish  you  no Harm neither But as you knew  Polly before  why could you not have made to yourself a Merit with  her  without  going so far with  me  What need you have so often begg'd and pray'd sigh'd and vow'd never leaving me Day nor Night till you had got me foolishly to  believe  and  pity  you And so after your Courtship to me was made a  Towntalk  then you could leave me to be laugh'd at by  every one I slighted for you  Was this just was this well done think you  Here I cannot go out of Doors but I have some one or other  simpering  and  sneering  at me and I have had two  Willowgarlands  sent me so I haveBut what poor Stuff in some of my  own Sex  too is this to laugh at and deride  me  for  your  Baseness I can call my Heart to witness to my Virtue in Thought in Word and in Deed and must I be ridicul'd for a  false one  who gives himself Airs at  my  Expence and at the Expence of his own Truth and Honour Indeed you cannot say the least Ill of me that's my Comfort I defy the World to say any thing to blast my Character Why then should I suffer in the  World's Eye  for  your  Baseness  I seek not to move you to return to the Fidelity you have vow'd for by this Time may hap you'd be as base to  Polly  as you have been to  me  if you did and I wish  her  no  Willowgarlands  I'll assure you But yet let me desire you to speak of me with Decency That is no more than I deserve well you know Don't to bravethro' the Perfidy you have been guilty of mention me with such Fleers as I hear you have done to several and pray call me none of  your poor dear Girls  And  I hope she won't take it to Heart poor Thing  with that Insolence that so little becomes you and I have so little deserved I thought to have appeal'd to your  Conscience  on what has passed between us when I began I thought to have  put the Matter  home  to you But I have run out into this Length and now don't think it  worth while  to write much more For what is  Conscience  to a Man who could  vow  as you have done and  act  as you have done  Go then Mr  John  naughty Man as you are I will try to forget you for ever Rejoice in the Smiles of your  Polly Bambridge  and glad your Heart with the Possession of an Hundred or Two of Pounds more than I have and see what you'll be the  richer  or  happier  a  few Years  hence I wish no Harm to you Your  Conscience  will be a greater Trouble to you than I wish it to be if you are capable of  reflecting  And for  your sake  I will henceforth set myself up to be an Adviser to all my Sex never to give Ear to a  Man  unless they can be sure that his  Interest  will be a  Security  for his  pretended Affection  to them I am tho' greatly  injured  and  deceived  naughty Mr  John  Your Wellwisher  LETTER CXXXII From a Gentleman to his Mistress who seeing no Hopes of Success respectfully withdraws his Suit  MADAM  I MAKE no doubt but this will be the welcomest Letter that you ever received from me for it comes to assure you that it is the last Trouble you will ever have from me Nor should I have so long withheld from you this Satisfaction had not the Hope your Brother gave me that in time I might meet with a happier Fate made me willing  to try every way to obtain your Favour But I see all the Hopes given me by his kind Consideration for me and those that my own Presumption had made me entertain are all in vain And I will therefore rid you of so troublesome an Importuner having nothing to offer now but my ardent Wishes for your Happiness and these Madam I will pursue you with to my Life's latest Date  May you whenever you shall change your Condition meet with a Heart as passionately and as sincerely devoted to you as mine And may you be happy for many very many Years in the Man you can honour with your Love For give me leave to say Madam that in  this  my End will be in part answer'd because it was most sincerely  your  Happiness I had in View as well as  my own  when I presumptuously hoped by  contributing  to the  one  to  secure  the  other  I am Madam with the highest Veneration  Your most obedient humble Servant  LETTER CXXXIII From a Lady to a Gentleman who had obtained all her Friends Consent urging him to decline his Suit to her  SIR  YOU have often importuned me to return Marks of that Consideration for  you  which you profess for  me  As my Parents to whom I owe all Duty encourage your Address I wish I could I am hardly treated by them because I cannot What shall I do Let me apply to you Sir for my  Relief who have much good Sense and I hope Generosity Yes Sir let me bespeak your  Humanity  to  me  and  Justice  to yourself in this Point and that shall be all I will ask in my Favour I own you deserve a much better Wife than I shall ever make but yet as Love is not in one's own Power if I have the Misfortune to know I cannot love you will not  Justice  to yourself if not  Pity  to me oblige you to abandon your present Purpose  But as to myself Sir Why should you make a poor Creature unhappy in the Displeasure of all her Friends at present and still more unhappy if to avoid that she gives up her  Person  where she cannot bestow her  Heart  If you love me as you profess let me ask you Sir Is it for  my sake  or is it for  your own  If for  mine  how can it be when I must be miserable if I am forced to marry where I cannot loveIf for  your own  reflect Sir on the Selfishness of your Love and judge if it deserves from me the Return you wish  How sadly does this Love  already  operate You love me so  well  that you make me miserable in the Anger of my dearest FriendsYour Love has already made them think me undutiful and instead of the Fondness and Endearment I used to be treated with by them I meet with nothing but Chidings Frowns Slights and Displeasure  And what is this Love of yours to do for me hereafterWhy hereafter Sir it will be turned to  Hatred  or  Indifference  at least For then tho' I cannot give you my  Heart  I shall have given you a  Title  to it and you will have a lawful Claim to its Allegiance May it not then nay  ought  it not to be treated on the Foot of a Rebel and expect Punishment as such instead of Tenderness Even were I to be treated with  Mercy  with  Goodness  with  Kindness  by you and could not  deserve  or  return  it what a Wretch would your  Love  make me How would it involve me in the crying Sin of  Ingratitude  How would it destroy my  Reputation  in the  World's Eye  that the  best  of Husbands had the  worst  of WivesThe  kindest  of Men the  unkindest  of Women  Cease then I beseech you this hopeless this cruel PursuitMake some  worthier  Person happy with your Addresses that  can  be happy in themBy this means you will restore me if you decline as of your  own  Motion to the Condition you found me in the Love of my Parents and the Esteem of my Friends If you  really  love me this may be a hard Task but it will be a most generous oneAnd there is some Reason to expect it for who that  truly  loves wishes to make the Object of his Love miserable This must I be if you persist in your Address and I shall know by your Conduct on Occasion of this  uncommon  Request how to consider it and in what Light to place you either as the most  generous  or the most  ungenerous  of Men Mean time I am Sir most heartily tho' I cannot be what you would have me  Your Wellwisher and humble Servant  LETTER CXXXIV The Gentleman's Answer to the Lady's uncommon Request  Dear Madam  I AM exceedingly concerned that I cannot be as acceptable to you as I have the good Fortune to find myself to your honoured Parents If  Madam I had Reason to think it was owing to your Prepossession in some happier Man's Favour I should utterly despair of it and should really think it would be unjust to  myself  and ungenerous to  you  to continue my Address As therefore you have by your  Appeal  to me in so  uncommon  a way endeavour'd to make me a  Party  against  myself  and I have shewn so much Regard to you as to be willing to oblige you as far as I  can  may I not hope the Favour of you to declare generously whether I owe my Unhappiness to such a  Prepossession  and whether your Heart is given to some  other  If this be the Case you shall find all you wish on my Part and I shall take a Pride to plead against myself let me suffer ever so much by it to your Father and Mother But if not and you have taken any other Disgusts to my Person or Behaviour that there may be Hope my utmost Affection and Assiduity or a contrary Conduct may in time get the better of let me implore you to permit me still to continue my zealous Respects to you for this I will say that there is not a Man in the World who can address you with a sincerer and more ardent Flame than dear Madam  Your affectionate Admirer and humble Servant  LETTER CXXXV The Lady's Reply in case of a Prepossession  SIR  I Thank you for your kind Assurance that you will befriend me in the manner I wish and I think I owe it to your Generosity to declare that there is a Person in the World that might I be left to my  own  Choice I should prefer to all other  Men To this Sir it is owing that your Address cannot meet with the Return it might otherwise deserve from me Yet are Things so circumstanc'd that while my Friends prefer  you  and know nothing of the  other  I should find it very difficult to obtain their Consents But your generous Discontinuance without giving them the  true  Reason for it will lay an Obligation greater than I can express on  Your most humble Servant  LETTER CXXXVI The Lady's Reply in case of no Prepossession or that she chuses not to avow it  SIR  I AM sorry to say that my Disapprobation of your Address is insuperableyet cannot I but think myself beholden to you for the Generosity of your Answer to my earnest Request I must beg you Sir to give over your Application but how can I say while I cannot help being of  this  Mind that it  is  or is  not  owing to  Prepossession  when you declare that in the one Instance and that is very generous too you  will  oblige me but in the other you  will not  If I cannot return  Love  for  Love  be the Motive what it  will  pray Sir for  your own sake  as well as  mine  discontinue your AddressIn case of  Prepossession  you say you  can  and you  will  oblige me Let my  Unworthiness  Sir have the same Effect upon you as if that  Prepossession  were to be avow'd This will inspire me with a Gratitude that will always make me  Your most obliged Servant  LETTER CXXXVII A Lady to a Gentleman of superior Fortune who after a long Address in an honourable way proposes to live with her as a Gallant  SIR  AFTER many unaccountable Hesitations and concealed Meanings that your Mind seem'd of late big with but hardly knew how to express you have at last spoken out all your Mind and I know what I am to trust to I have that Disdain of your Proposal that an honest Mind ought to have But I wish for my own sake and I will say for  yours  too because your Honour is concerned in it so deeply that I had had at my first Acquaintance with you such an Instance of your  Plaindealing  or rather  Baseness  Then I should have had no Regret in letting you know how much I scorn'd the  Proposer  and the  Proposal  Tho' I hope as it is a little Time and Reflection will make me for the sake of the  latter  abhor the  former  However Sir I must say you are very cruel to use me thus after you had by all the alluring Professions of an honourable Love inspired me with a grateful Return and brought me to the Freedom of owning itNor yet will I be an Hypocrite or deny my honest Passion for that would be to lessen your Guilt God is my Witness I loved you beyond all your Sex yet I loved you  virtuously  I loved you because I thought you  virtuous  And now tho' it may take some Time and too much Regret to get over yet do I hope your Behaviour will enable me to conquer my fond Folly  Ungenerous Man to take Advantage of your superior Fortune to insult me thus when you had gain'd my Affections What tho' I am not blessed with a worldly Circumstance equal to what you might expect in a  Wife  can you think my Mind so base as to submit to be yours on unworthy Terms Go unworthy Man and make your Court to Miss  Reynolds  as you seem to threaten She has a Fortune equal to your own and may you be happy together I should have been so had I never known you I never deceived you You knew my scanty Fortune and yet pretended to prefer me to all my Sex  On me you might have laid the highest Obligation by raising me to a Condition I was humble enough to think above me and I should have been on that account all Gratitude all Duty all Acknowledgment On Miss  Reynolds  you will confer none her Fortune will quit Scores with yours and you must both in your Union be Strangers to the inexpressible Pleasure of  receiving  or  conferring  of Benefits But this is a Pleasure which none but generous Minds can taste That yours is not so witness your detested Proposal after such solemn Professions of faithful and honourable Love And I have one Consolation tho' a Consolation I did not wish for that I am under no Obligation but the contrary to such a Man And am as much your Superior as the Person who would do no Wrong is to one that will do nothing else Send me however my Letters that I may be assured my fond Credulity will not be the Subject of fresh Insult and that perhaps to the  Person  that shall be what you made  me  expect  I  should be I will send you all yours the last only excepted Which as it may assist me to conquer my fond Folly for you I hope you'll  allow me to keep tho' it is the Abhorr'd of my SoulMay  you  be happier than you have made  me  is the last Prayer you will have from  Your too credulous Wellwisher  LETTER CXXXVIII A Father to a Daughter in Service on hearing of her Master's attempting her Virtue  My dear Daughter  I Understand with great Grief of Heart that your Master has made some Attempts on your Virtue and yet that you stay with him God grant that you have not already yielded to his base Desires For when once a Person has so far forgotten what belongs to himself or his Character as to make such an Attempt the very Continuance with him and in his Power and under the same Roof is an Encouragement to him to prosecute his Designs And if he carries it better and more civil at present it is only the more certainly to undo you when he attacks you next Consider my dear Child your Reputation is all you have to trust to And if you have not already which God forbid yielded to him leave it not to the Hazard of another Temptation but come away directly as you ought to have done on your own Motion at the Command of  Your grieved and indulgent Father  LETTER CXXXIX The Daughter's Answer  Honoured Father  I Received your Letter Yesterday and am sorry I stay'd a Moment in my Master's House after his vile Attempt But he was so full of his Promises of never offering the like again that I hoped I might believe him nor have I yet seen any thing to the contrary But am so much convinced that I ought to have done as you say that I have this Day left the House and hope to be with you soon after you will have received this Letter I am  Your dutiful Daughter  LETTER CXL To a Gentleman of Fortune who has Children dissuading him from a Second Marriage with a Lady much younger than himself  Worthy Sir  YOU are pleased to inform me of your Thoughts in relation to a Change of your Condition and to command me to give you freely my Opinion of the Conveniencies and Inconveniencies that may follow from the Inequality of Years between you and the young Lady you think of making your second Wife Indeed I am so much concerned for your Happiness that had I heard of such your Intention and had not your Commands to be free on this Head I think I should have run  the Risque of being thought impertinent and officious rather than not have expostulated with you on this Occasion My Objections Sir are not so much to the Gaiety of the Lady as to her Youth and the Children you have already by your late excellent Lady And when you remember that Miss  Fanny  your eldest Daughter is near as old as the Lady you think to make her Mother I beg Sir you will consider how your Reputation as to Prudence will suffer in the Eye of the World  without you  as well as the Look it will have to your  Children  and  Domesticks  Nature Justice Decency and every Branch of human Prudence plead strongly against the Union of lively Youth with maturer Years  Her  Temper may be very agreeable So indeed is  yours  But may they be so to  each other  when they meet together in so close an Union You are  yet  blest with a good State of  Health  but can you expect that it will be  always  soOr rather will not  every Year  take from  your  Constitution what it will add to  hers  for several Years to come Your Years make  you  serious and solemn and you are past a  Relish  for those Pleasures and Amusements which are but suitable to  hers  and which at the  same Age  you yourself delighted in Can you recall  Time past  Will it  become  you to  resume  the Part which  Judgment  has made you quit How aukwardly if you attempt it will you do this What Censure will  this  subject you to How will it embolden the gay young Fellows to make Attempts that may notwithstanding the most unexceptionable Conduct in the  Lady  give  you  great Uneasiness  If you cannot join in the  innocent Gaieties  which you have long  disused  it would be in some measure cruel to  deprive  a young Lady of her Share of them  at an Age that will naturally make her  expect  and  require  them And yet will not even  innocent  Liberties be Matter of Reproach to  her  and Uneasiness to  you  if she takes them without you And would you chuse to bear her Company and indulge a  youngold  Taste for gay Scenes long contemn'd and so appear in a Light to all that beheld you together either as her  Father  or her  jealous Keeper  and make it look to the World as if you  yourself  doubted her Virtue out of your own  Presence  Suppose the Scene at a gallant Comedy that sprightly free Joke which will make  her  smile will make  you  frown and so on in every other Scene of Life and Amusement between you For a  Defect  or  Inequality  of whatever Kind whenever a Man is  conscious  of it let him  carry it off as he may  will always be  present  with him and like another Conscience stare him in the Face  Your Fortune 'tis true is so considerable that you may amply provide for  all  your Children and yet make it worth a young Lady's while who would study her  Interest  preferably to any  other  Consideration to oblige you But Sir let me ask you Can you who lived so happily with your  late dear Lady  and had such constant Proofs of her  inviolable  Affection to your Person content yourself with a  counterfeit  Passion a mere  selfish  Affection in a  Wife  And can you think that so  young  a Lady can love you like  her  who grew on in Life in Hope in Desires  with you  and who from a reciprocal Youth passed agreeably together grew  equally  mature and had  both  but  one  View between you to wit a young Family growing up the  common  Offspring of your  mutual  Affections and who were the  binding  and so long as her Life lasted the  indissoluble  Cement of your  Loves  and your  Interests  If she  can  she will be  a Contradiction to all  Experience  and you will be happy against all reasonable  Expectation  If she  cannot  will you be content with a  selfish  an  interested Civility  instead of  true Love  and which cannot possibly so much as look  like  Love but by the Dissimulation and Hypocrisy of your  Bosom Companion    When I look back on what I have written I begin to be afraid of your Displeasure on a double Account for the  Nature  and for the  Length  of this Epistle tho' you have commanded me to speak my Mind Yet having several other material Points to touch upon and relying upon your Excuse for my good Intentions for what View can I have in the Liberty I take but your Happiness I will beg Leave to pursue the Subject in another Letter and to conclude this tho' a little abruptly with the Assurance that as your request nobody shall see what I write but yourself and that I am Sir  Your affectionate humble Servant  LETTER CXLI The same Subject pursued  SIR  I WILL now take the Liberty to continue my Subject and my humble Expostulations upon it And I will suppose two Cases very if not equally probable to wit that you  may  or may  not  have Children by your new Lady and to judge in both Cases how the Happiness of your remaining Life may be affected by either In the first place if you should have Children by her to say nothing of the Misunderstandings and Jealousies  this may create between your Lady and your present Children which may greatly affect your own Happiness are you so well able to support at  these  Years with Credit and Satisfaction that Character which so peculiarly befits a  young  Husband to a  young  Wife And will it not naturally strike you that your own Children by  that  time will make a  better  Figure in such a Circumstance than yourself Will you be so well able to go thro' the  same  Troubles the  same  Anxieties the  same  Hopes Fears and Affections both to the pregnant Mother and afterwards to the Infant Progeny that you have so  happily  got over And will not what was then called  laudable Love  be now deemed  Dotage  and  Uxoriousness  Providence seems to have design'd the  youthful  Portion of a Man's Life for mutual Endearments and Propagation of his Family the  maturer  Part for Education Counsel or Advice And will you Sir  invert  the Design of it Will you  call back  the Days of  Sense  into the Years of  Intellect  watch over the Baby in the  Cradle  when you should form the Mind of the  grown Person  How unequal will you be to this Part to what you  once  wereAs you will not have the  same  Dispositions about you you cannot have the  same  Joy at a pleasing Incident but will have possibly a  superadded  Weight of Sorrow on any sad Event as  Years  will have  added  to your  Reflection  as  Experience  will have  contracted  your  Hope  and as you will have  seen  the Vanity of all worldly Expectations  Then my dear Sir consider if you should even get over this  resumed  Province happily and have no material Uneasiness from the Lady on the Account I have intimated to you Is it not too probable that you may not live to see this young Race brought up And if you should what Animosities  what Uneasinesses may not ensue from the different Interests into which your Family will be divided And it may moreover be possible for you to have Grandchildren older than some of your own by your new Lady  But if we suppose that the  Occasion  for this may not happen will the Matter be mended by itAll young Ladies expect and wish for Children when they marry If she should not have any she will hardly be induced to think it  her  Fault but the  Difference  of Years will  tell  her and all the World will  join  in it  where  to lay the Blame  deserved  or  not  She will for want of so  necessary  an Employment look  abroad  for Amusements and Diversions which however innocent in her first Intentions may not  always  end so and if they  do  will be very unsuitable to your Disposition and Liking Childbed  matronizes  the giddiest Spirits and brings them to Reflection sooner than any other Event Its Consequences fill up the Time and introduce different Scenes of Pleasure and Amusement in the Mind of a Lady It draws her Attention to more  serious  Affairs it  domesticates  her as I may say and makes her associate with graver Persons and such as are in the same Scenes of Life But where this is  not  she  continues  her youthful and giddy Acquaintance  classes  herself as to her  Company  and  Diversions  as if in the  single  State still and looks for Amusements  out of herself  and  out of your House  And you will be obliged to connive at a good deal more than you otherwise would because the Difference of Years will give as much  Consciousness  to  you  as it will  Presumption  to  her  and if there be any Grievance between you she'll think after all you can do it is of  her  Side Nor will  Time  and  Years  mend the Matter but contrarily make it  worse  and  worse  Then another Inconvenience may arise The Lady if she has no Children by you to prevent lying at the  Mercy of yours  as she will call it will be making a  separate  Interest to herself She will grow upon your Indulgence and Fondness she will  cajole  she will  reproach  she will  tieze  you into Acts of Bounty and Profusion to her She will endeavour to build up a Fortune out of yours to the Prejudice of  your Family  And all this for what EndOnly to make her a  rich Widow  and to give her Opportunity to triumph in Conjunction perhaps with some  young Rake  or  Profligate  over  your Ashes  and to make Comparisons  grievous to Reflection  at the Expence of your Fortune and Memory in the  new  Man's Favour  Forgive me dear Sir these free Hints My full Mind which is thus ready to overflow thro' the Zeal I have for your  Honour  and  Welfare  suggests many  more  to me which your cool Reflection will not want And I have been already so prolix that I will only farther say that I am and shall ever be  Your faithful and most affectionate Friend and Servant  LETTER CXLII Against a Second Marriage where there are Children on  both  Sides  Dear Sir  YOU ask my Opinion as to the Thoughts you have entertained of making your Addresses to the Widow  Lockyer  Do you really ask it with an Intent to take it Or like the Generality of the World only in hopes that my Judgment falling in  with your own may be a kind of Justification or Excuse for what you intend to do and are perhaps already resolved upon If so what do you do but lay a Snare for me which may put an End to our Friendship For Men least of all bear Controul or Contradiction in Points of this Nature when their Hearts are actually determined and then Indifference begins and Disgust ends the bestcemented Friendships  To say the Truth I never was a Friend to Second Marriages where there are Children on one Side and a Likelihood of more but especially where there are Children on  both  I have nothing to say as to the Person or Character of the Lady You whom it most concerns are well satisfy'd of both or you would not have gone so far as to ask a Friend's Advice on this Occasion But since you do put it to me I will throw a few Reasons together which have always had Weight with me on these Occasions and I hope you'll not think the worse of your Friend if he happen to differ a little from your own Judgment  It must be confess'd in the Case you put That the Circumstances on both Sides are pretty equal That there is no great Disparity in Years That she has Three Children and you have Four a round Family however when they come together That she is very fond of her Children and you at  present  of yours That you are not an illtemper'd Man and she is a goodtemper'd Woman and was a loving Wife to her late Spouse as you were an affectionate Husband to yours Well so far is very well and you'll think perhaps very promising of a happy Union and possibly you may think right at least you have much better Grounds for it than many that do marry upon much worse and more unequal Prospects  But consider Sir what Security have you that Persons who have been always goodtemper'd when they have nothing to thwart or try their Temper will be still so when they have something that willHere at the very Threshold of this Adventure is a Cause of great Trial a Trial which neither of you had before and consequently which neither of you know how you shall behave in She loves  her  Children So she ought You love  yours  It is right so to do But see you not before I speak that this laudable  separate  Love of  either  may become matter of great Uneasiness to  both  You cannot either of you possibly expect more than common Civility and outside Kindness from the other  she  to  yours you  to  hers  And it will be happy enough if this Task do not sufficiently try the Discretion of  both  It is impossible my Friend but you must have very different Views on each otherA pretty Prospect to set out with in a matrimonial Adventure Her Praises of her own Children will be very sincere and lavish Her Praises of yours if she  ever  praises will be very suspicious and sparing And perhaps you must be as discreet as possible in the Praises of your own The very Cloaths each wear the Victuals they eat nay the very Looks of either Parent as they shall appear kind to their own or reserved to the other's will afford room for inward Heartburnings if not outward Janglings I have seen many Instances of these kinds  Their different Capacities one shall take their Learning another notTheir different Tempers one shall be mild another insulting one smooth another roughTheir different Ages which will make one dictate while the other will not be prescribed toWill all afford Cause of Difference and when they come to an Age fit for  setting them out in the World if Boys to Apprentice You put  Jackey  to a better Trade than  Tommy  and give more Money with him And yet one Trade or Master may apparently deserve or require it the other not If Girls in Matrimony Why should  Betsey  be married before  Thomasine  Let the Eldest go first Tho' perhaps the one has an humble Servant the other noneAy I see poor  Thomasine  must be contented with any body or any thing while  Betsey  must be a LadyThese are all still fresh Causes of Difference and Uneasiness to you both  Then will she actually or you will suspect it and that is as bad to your Peace be constantly  progging  as the Women call it for her Children in order to make a private Purse for them on any Occasion that may happen or in case she shall outlive you  And if there be a  third  Race of Children from this Marriage worse and worse still Then the two former Sets if they never joined together before now will make a common Cause in this single Point against the new Race and must not this double your own and your Wife's Comforts think youThen must you be glad to lessen your Family at home that you may lessen the Number of so many Spies and Enemies to your Repose The Boys must be hurry'd out to the first Thing that offers for them whether suitable or unsuitable to their Genius or Capacity and they generally thrive accordingly The Girls to the first Man that will take them whether he can provide for them or not as he ought and after a while they may come back to you tho' fitted out with a great Expence quite destitute and undone with a farther Increase to your Family the too frequent Consequences of precipitate Marriages And then  will a new Scene commence for all the unprovidedfor will join against the poor unhappy one  This you'll say is looking a great way forward It is so And what may never happen Possibly it never may as to the last Case but as it too often has happen'd and daily does happen a wise Man will think a little about it while it is in his Power to prevent it all  I have touch'd but upon a few of the Consequences that may too probably follow from a new Engagement Yet I believe these if you are  not  absolutely determin'd will make you think a little if you  are  why then all the Reasons that can be urged will signify nothing And in this Case you should not have laid a Snare for me to disoblige a Person who is to step in between your Friendship and mine and who will look upon me if she knows my Mind as very probably she will for I hardly ever knew a Secret of this kind kept as her Enemy and so create a Coolness and Indifference between us which you cannot help if you would For if ever it be so and your  Lady  receives me in a way that I have not been used to in your  House  I shall be very shy of visiting either you or her  If you require it and it will have any Effect upon you I can enter still farther into this Subject but I fansy I have said enough and perhaps more than you'll thank me for But be that as it will I have answer'd your Request and shewn you peradventure at the Expence of my Discretion that I am in all Things  Your sincere Friend and Wellwisher  LETTER CXLIII Against a second Marriage where there are Children on  one  Side and a Likelihood of  more  Dear Sir  YOU are inclined you tell me to give your  Children  a  Mother  instead of the good one they have lost or rather in plain  English  you should have said  yourself  a  Wife  to supply your  own Loss  And you ask my Opinion on the Subject without naming the Person only intimating that she is a maiden Lady no more than Seven Years younger than yourself and has a pretty middling Fortune  I am glad you have not named the Lady for now I shall stand clear of any Imputation of personal Prejudice let me say what I will I will therefore freely tell you my Mind that I am always against second Marriages where there are Children on one or both Sides and likely to be more Unless there are such worldly Reasons as make it absolutely prudent for a Person to marry to establish his Circumstances This is not your Case For you are very easy in the World and besides the Ladies of this Age are so brought up that a Man must not look for very extraordinary Assistances in a Wife with relation to her  own  Children much less the Children of  another  Woman Well but  this  Lady is highly prudent goodhumour'd an excellent Oeconomist and what not And so they are  all  my Friend or at least we are apt to persuade ourselves so before they are marry'd  But we'll suppose her all you say and all you think yet she will hardly I presume be divested  of the Passions common to human Nature Can you expect that tho' you give your Children a Mother you give them an  own  Mother She may have Prudence enough to do what  she  will think her Duty by them but must she not be her own Judge of what that isAnd are you sure that what she calls so nay and for Peacesake what you will be willing to call so too will be called so by your Children as they grow up and even by the rest of the World But Children you'll say may be unreasonable and undutifulVery well Sirwe'll suppose it so but will this make you happy let them have Reason or not for their Surmises And as she cannot plead  Nature  for the Regulator of her Conduct towards them but common Civility and Prudence only at the very best will there not be two to one on the Childrens Side that they may be right But whoever may be right or wrong if you are made unhappy by it that's the essential Point to you who by this second Marriage have been the Cause of it all  This is most certain  her  Views must be quite contrary to those of your  Children  'Tis true theirs will of Consequence be likewise contrary to hers and yet both may be very reasonable too according to the Character of each And is not this a pretty Situation for you do you think For which Side  can  you  must  you take The Children as they grow up will be jealous of ill Offices from her with you She will interpret those things which a natural Mother would think nothing of as studied Slights and will not their constant Bickerings make you uneasy in your own Family where Uneasiness is the least tolerable as it is the Place to which a Man should retire for Comfort when the World gives him Cause of Displeasure  And what pray may this probably end in Why for Quietnesssake you will possibly be obliged to separate them The Motherinlaw should  she  be in  Fault  you  cannot  part with The Children then must turn out of course You must study after reconciling and patching up a hundred Breaches to make some other Provision for  them  And thus perhaps they are precipitated into a wide World and exposed to a thousand dangerous Temptations and how can you forgive yourself if they should by this means become a Prey to the designing Attempts the  Boys  of  vicious Women  the  Girls  of  profligate Men  And how would it have grieved the Heart of their indulgent Mother could she have foreseen that her beloved Spouse instead of supplying the Loss of a  Mother  to them should take from them his own  immediate  Protection and that perhaps at a Time of Life when it was most necessary for their future Good  This may very probably be more or less the Case if there be no other Difficulties than what may arise between your Children and their Motherinlaw But if as is most likely you should have Children by this your second Wife the Case may be still worse She will then look upon yours by your first not only with a  more indifferent  but probably with a  jealous  Eye She will be continually carking and laying up for her  own  and grudge every thing you lay out upon the  others  And when they are both grown up to any Bigness what Clashings and Jarrings may not ensue between the Offspring of the  same  Father and two  different  Mothers How will you be obliged to give a Preference to the Children of the  latter  Wife against those of the  former  because the Mother of the one Set is  present  and  partial  and perhaps  clamorous  in  their  Favourthat of the other  absent silent dead forgotten  If Love hides a Multitude of Faults as no doubt it does and  Indifference  or perhaps as it may be  Hatred  is quicksighted to every little Slip how will  hers  be all Angels  Yours  the worst she can call themYet how can you  help  this You are married to the  Temper  as well as to the  Woman  and Opposition 'tis likely will but make matters worse for what the Sex cannot carry by Reason or Argument they will by Obstinacy and Teizing  Then in the Matter of making Provision respectively for their future Good how will your Solicitudes for the  one  be constantly lessened for the  other  perpetually importun'd Nor must your own Judgment in  either  Case be so much the Rule of your Conduct as the fond Partiality of your second Wife for hers And it is far from being impossible that she may use your first Children  worse  than she would do  mere Strangers  for no other Reason but because they have a better Title to your  Regard  and stand  more  in the way of her Interest and Views  These my good Friend are some of the Reasons I have to alledge against second Marriages where there are Children on one Side and a Probability of having a second Race As I hinted there may be Reasons where a Person's Circumstances stand in need of the Assistance that may be procur'd by this means to overbalance many of the Inconveniencies I have hinted at The lesser Evil in this Case is to be chosen and the Party must make the best of the rest But this is not your Case And so I refer the Whole to your mature Consideration and am Sir  Sincerely yours  LETTER CXLIV Advising a Friend against going to Law  Dear Sir  I AM sorry to hear that the Difference between you and Mr  Archer  is at last likely to be brought to a Lawsuit I wish you'd take it into your serious Consideration before you  begin  because it will hardly be in your Power to  end  it when you please For you immediately put the Matter out of your own Hands into the Hands of those whose  Interest  it is to protract the Suit from Term to Term and who will as absolutely prescribe to you in it as your Physician in a dangerous Illness  The Law my good Friend I look upon more than any one thing as the  proper  Punishment of an overhasty and perverse Spirit as it is a Punishment that follows an Act of a Man's own seeking and chusing You will not consent perhaps  now  to submit the Matter in Dispute to Reference but let me tell you that after you have expended large Sums of Money and squandered away a deal of Time in Attendance on your Lawyers and Preparations for Hearings one Term after another you will probably be of another Mind and be glad  Seven Years  hence to leave it to that Arbitration which now you refuse He is happy who is wise by other Mens Misfortunes says the common Adage And why when you have heard from all your Acquaintance who have try'd the Experiment what a grievous Thing the Law is will you notwithstanding pay for that Wisdom which you may have at the Cost of others  The Representation that was once hung up as a Sign in the  Rolls  Liberty on one Side of a Man  all in Rags wringing his Hands with a Label importing  That he had lost his Suit  and on the other a Man that had not a Rag left but stark naked capering and triumphing  That he had carry'd his Cause  'Tis said That Sir  John Tr    Master of the Rolls caused this Sign to be taken down on the Clamour it occasion'd among the Lawyers  was a fine Emblem of going to Law and the infatuating Madness of a litigious Spirit  How excellent to this Purpose is the Advice of our Blessed SAVIOUR rather than seek  this Redress  against any who would even  take one's Coat  to  give him his Cloak also  For besides the Christian Doctrine inculcated by this Precept it will be found as the Law is managed and the Uncertainty that attends it even in the  bestgrounded  Litigations that such a pacifick Spirit may be deemed the  only  way to preserve the rest of one's Garments and to prevent being stript to the Skin  Moreover what wise Man would rush upon a Proceeding where the principal Men of the Profession tho' the Oath they take if Serj  nts obliges them not to sign a sham Plea nor plead in a Cause against their own Opinion are not ashamed under the specious but scandalous Notion of doing the  best they can for their Client  to undertake for the sake of a paltry Fee to  whiten  over the  blackest  Cause and to defeat the  justest  Where your Property may depend altogether upon the Impudence of an eloquent Pleader asserting  any thing  a perjured Evidence swearing whatever will do for his Suborner's Purpose Where the Tricks and Mistakes of Practisers and want of trifling Forms may Nonsuit you Where Deaths of Persons made Parties to the Suit may cause all to begin again What wise Man I say would subject  himself to these Vexations and common Incidents in the Law if he could any way avoid it together with the intolerable Expences and Attendances consequent on a Lawsuit Besides the Fears the Cares the Anxieties that revolve with every Term and engross all a Man's Thoughts Where  legal  Proofs must be given to the  plainest  Facts that a living Man is living and identically himself and that a dead Man is dead and buried by Certificate where Evidence must be brought at a great Expence to Hands and Seals affixed to Deeds and Receipts that never were before question'd till a Cause shall be split into several Underones these try'd Term by Term and Years elapse before the main Point comes to be argued tho' originally there was but one single Point as you apprehended in the Question As to the Lawpart only observe the Process First comes the Declaration dly a Plea dly Demurrer to the Plea thly a Joinder in Demurrer thly a Rejoinder thly a Surrejoinder which sometimes is conclusive sometimes to begin all over again Then may succeed Tryals upon the  Law  Part and Tryals upon the  Equity  Part oftentimes new Tryals or Rehearings and these followed by Writs of Error  Then you may be plung'd into the bottomless Gulf of Chancery where you begin with Bills and Answers containing Hundreds of Sheets at exorbitant Prices Lines in a Sheet and Words in a Line and a Stamp to every Sheet barefacedly so contrived to pick your Pocket Then follow all the Train of Examinations Interrogatories Exceptions Bills amended References for Scandal and Impertinence new Allegations new Interrogatories new Exceptions on Pretence of insufficient Answers Replies Rejoinders Surrejoinders Butters Rebutters  and Surrebutters till at last when you have danced thro' this blessed Round of  Preparation  the  Tryal  before the Master of the Rolls comes next Appeals follow from his Honour to the Chancellor then from the Chancellor to the House of Lords and sometimes the Parties are sent down from thence for a new Tryal in the Courts belowGood Heavens What wise Man permit me to repeat would enter himself into this confounding  Circle of the Law    I hope dear Sir you will think of this Matter most deliberately before you proceed in your present angry Purpose and if you shall think proper to take my Advice and avoid a Lawsuit I am sure you will have Reason to thank me for it and for the Zeal wherewith I am  Your sincere Friend and Servant  LETTER CXLV To a young Lady cautioning her against keeping Company with a Gentleman of a bad Character  Dear Cousin  THE great Respect I have and always had for you obliges me to take this Freedom to let you know that the Neighbourhood begins to talk pretty freely of you and Mr  Lory  You have been seen with him at the Play and after that at the  R  Tavern a House of no good Repute I assure you where you have staid with him till near Twelve o' Clock at Night You have likewise been with him at  Vipont  's at  Hampstead  at  Vauxhall Cuper'sgardens Marylebon  c  I am sorry for these Things because he has none of the best of Characters having as I am well inform'd already ruin'd Two if not Three worthy Tradesmens Daughters And it is but too probable that he has no honourable Design upon you For whatever he may promise you I am credibly assur'd that he is actually engaged with Miss  Knapper  whom you know very well Indeed it is said he has  l per Ann  but if it be so he is very much involved in the World and at the Rate he lives had he three times that Estate would never be out of Debt for he is downright extravagant a Man of no Conduct a perfect Rattle whose Words are not to be rely'd on in any respect and makes a common Boast of the Favours he has received from our Sex whose faulty Fondness is the constant Subject of his Ridicule  For all these Reasons I beg of you dear Cousin to avoid his Company for tho' I am confident you will preserve your  Virtue  yet my Dear think what you will you may receive an incurable Wound in your  Reputation  I hope you'll excuse this Liberty which no other Motive but Zeal for your Credit and Welfare has occasioned And believe me to be  Your faithful Friend as well as affectionate Cousin  LETTER CXLVI From a Mother to her highspirited Daughter who lives on uneasy Terms with her Husband  Dear  Nanny  I AM sorry with all my Heart to hear of the frequent Misunderstandings between your Husband and you I hoped much better things from  your Prudence From  my  Prudence you'll say perhaps as if I thought all the Fault was yours But my Dear I don't think so I can't think so and yet I may find Fault with your want of Prudence too For Prudence will oblige a good Wife to bear a little Contradiction from her Husband tho' not always just perhaps as well as to avoid giving Offence Suppose he is peevish petulant uneasy in his Temper and on slight or no Occasions as you may think must  you  be peevish and petulant because  he  is so How do you know what things may have happened to him abroad in the way of his Business to make him soOr if it be  only  Humour why must you be as bad as he that you find Fault with Is an ill Temper in a Husband so taking a thing that the Wife who finds it intolerable to her must nevertheless imitate or assume it  The Reason why you will not allow him to be oftener in the Right and why you condemn as causeless his Petulance and Waspishness must proceed in a great measure from a slender Opinion if not Contempt of his Judgment If you think him a Man of Sense 'tis impossible but you should allow that there may be some Cause tho' you don't immediately penetrate it why he should be disturbed and it would be kind in you to suppose the best as that his Tenderness for you will not let him communicate it to you rather than to imagine he is always in the wrong and always angry without Reason But were it actually to be so are you commissioned to punish him with Provocations and Resentments  as  wrong and even  more  unbecoming in a Wife If you love him as you ought you will extenuate his Failings and draw into an advantageous Light those Actions which may be interpreted in his Favour  But if as I heard you once say  you will give him as good as he brings  that  you will not bear his unaccountable Humours  and suchlike vulgar and provoking Expressions it must come to this Point Either  you  or  he  must give way one of your Tempers must be subdued and overaw'd by the other If it be  his  Case tir'd out by your resolute and sturdy Behaviour to succumb do you think this will either be a Credit to  him  or to  you  What an abject  henpeck'd  the Vulgar call it Wretch will he be deem'd What a  Termagant  you He'll be the Jest of his Companions and you be thought to excelin what In a Quality the most infamous to a Woman next to that of an Adulteress  But this I aver that Meekness Condescension Forbearance are so far from being despisable Qualities in our Sex that they are the  Glory  of it And what is  Meekness  my Dear if you are not to be try'd by Provocations What is  Condescension  if you must always have your own way What is  Forbearance  if you are to return Injury for Injury with the hostile Spirit of a fierce Enemy rather than to act with the sweet Complacency of a tender Wife who has vow'd Obedience and Duty  But Obedience and Duty you'll say in Return for  ill Nature  and  ill Usage  Yes my Dear even were it to be so you  ought  For do you think you are never to condescend or give up your own Humour to your Husband A pretty Sort of  Obedience  that which shall be only shewn where you are  not  thwarted but never where you  are  Would not this be Obedience to your own headstrong Passions and not to himSo long as you can have your way in every thing you will be a Mirror of Condescension but when once you come to be contradicted why then you are at Liberty to contradict again If he is out of the way in his  Humour you will never be in the way in yours If he gives you  one  unkind Word he shall have  two  in Return for  you will give him as good as he brings  If he is passionate you will be so too You will return provoking Answers for reflecting Words and so make your House a constant Scene of Confusion and your Life uncomfortable And for what Why to shew how  bravely  you can return Injury for Injury how  nobly  you can contend for Victory over your Husband and how you can make him despised in his Family as well by Children as Servants and yourself discredited by the poor Victory suppose you were to win it by breaking his Spirit  Is this my Dear the Part of a tender  Wife  to a  Husband  Nay is it the Part of a  Christian  to a  Christian  where there is  not  the matrimonial Obligation For are we not commanded to return  Good for Evil  and to  pray for them that despightfully use us  And is not the Wife's  Conversation to be coupled with Fear  and do we not vow  Reverence  to a Husband as our  Head  How can all this be if you are to return Evil for Evil to make yourself your own Judge and Jury and Executioner too by acquitting yourself condemning him sentencing him and punishing him with all the Severity of licentious Speech provoking Snappishness or the still more affecting Deportment of sullen contemptuous Silence Let me on the Whole beseech you for  my  sake who would be loth to be thought to have set you any bad Example for your  Family  's sake for your  Reputation  's sake as well as  his  to resolve on a different Conduct Make the good Rule yours of never being out of Humour when he is so First soften him by good Temper then when soften'd expostulate mildly on the Unreasonableness of his Anger If you convince him  thus he will take care of the like Error or his  present  Confession will strengthen your mild Arguments against him in any thing else for the  future  He will see you advise him for his Good He will have a greater Opinion of  your  Prudence and be more doubtful of  his own  He will see you contend not for Victory or Contradictionsake but for his own sake And depend upon it you will both reap the happy Fruits of it in the Comfort of your Lives in the Love of your own Children in the Reverence of your Servants who will otherwise be listed in each Contender's Quarrel and be insolent Judges of the Conduct of both in the Respect of your Neighbours and Friends and in the Pleasure you will give to your Relations who will visit and be visited by you both with that Delight which nobody knows how to estimate so much as my dear  Nanny  Your ever affectionate Mother  LETTER CXLVII A Lady to her Friend a young Widow Lady who having bury'd a polite and excellent Husband inclines to marry a less deserving Gentleman and of unequal Fortune  Dear Madam  WERE I to lay it down for a Maxim that  Maids  often mend their Circumstances by Marriage  Widows  very rarely I believe I might be justify'd by every one's Experience To what can the Truth of this Observation be owing Is it to be supposed that Widows have stronger Passions than Maids Shall the proud lordly Sex have it to boast that they are such estimable Creatures that  when once one of them has had the Fortune to be chosen by a Lady and has been taken from her by Death she cannot live without taking another and finds herself obliged to accept of the next that offers thro' all Disadvantages and every Degree of Inequality Surely this cannot be the Case Surely a prudent a modest Lady will not say this in  so many Words  Much less then ought she to confess it by her  Actions  which are much stronger than  Words  For I believe no Woman who ever enter'd the Pale of Matrimony with sprightly Hopes about her found the Possession  Sex only  consider'd equal to her Expectations The Maid may hope may fansy much in the Commerce between the Sexes from her meditating on the heighten'd Scenes which pernicious Novels and idle Romances the Poison of Female Minds abound with But the Widow  knows  'tis all  Freemasonry  all empty Hope flashy foolish unworthy unpermanent and but for the Law of Nature despicableWhence is it then that the  wishing  expecting Maid should be more prudent than the  knowing  experienced Widow Should be better Proof with raised Imaginations against Courtship or Persuasion than one who well knows the transitory Vanity and Unsatisfactoriness of the End to which that Courtship or Persuasion tends  If it be said That  this  Point is not so much the Case as the  settled  Life of Matrimony which has been once so satisfactorily experienced let the Circumstances of a Lady who abounds in every thing answer this poor but common Excuse and let the Choice she makes of the Person and Fortune of her second Husband which is generally as I have observed above in both Cases far short of her former Choice acquit or convict her as her Conduct shall deserve  If a young Widow indeed advantages  herself  and worsts not her  Children  if she has any in her second Adventure let her proceed She is justified to worldly Prudence But this as I have said is so seldom the Case even with Widow Ladies of Modesty and  Discretion  in other respects that I must own I have been often puzzled and confounded how to account for the Motives of such an one reputably especially when she appears to me and all the World neither to have done Honour to the Memory of her late Spouse to her Family to herself nor as sometimes has been the Case paid any regard to common Decency How I say shall this be accounted for in a Lady of Prudence and Virtue Is it that as one Extreme is said to border on another  extreme Joy  treads on the Heels of  extreme Sorrow  It cannot be for as on one hand I am sure there can be no  extreme Joy  in the matrimonial Commerce so I fear where a Woman can soon forget her departed Spouse she cannot be sensible of  extreme Grief  for his Loss And if she will take upon her this latter Part of the Character and own the first was thus indifferent to her she shall have my Consent to do any thing she has a mind to do and I will exempt her willingly from the Observation of every other Rule of Prudence and Decency  But in a Case the direct Reverse of this how shall we account for such a Behaviour How in particular if the charming the blooming Miss  Bendish  who was so coy a Maiden and with so much Difficulty won by the late amiable and conversible Mr  Brookes  with a Fortune superior to her own should within a few Months after his Decease when blest with an Affluence left her by his Generosity and Affection for her be won by Mr  Fownes  a Man less accomplish'd as to Knowledge less amiable in his Person less polite in his Conversation and of a Fortune so much beneath what was even her maiden one that her Friends then would never have thought him worthy of herHow I say shall we account for this if it should be so Is there a secret Sympathy in Tempers and Dispositions that attracts each its Like by Motives imperceptible and unaccountable It cannot be in  this  Case surely For can the polite Mrs  Brookes  be  less  polite for having been marry'd to one of the bestbred and bestbehav'd Gentlemen in  England  And can she so soon get over Forms as a  Widow  for  such  a Suitor as Mr  Fownes  which as a  Maid  were so long before they could be dispensed with in Favour of  such  a Lover as Mr  Brookes  Is her soft and delicate Mind as well all think it after  all  more on a Level with that of the one Gentleman than that of the other  far more  excellent one Has she will the Licentious ask stronger Incentives to a married State as a Widow than she had as a MaidIt cannot beWhat then shall we say to all thisFor after all two Years won not Miss  Bendish  to a Gentleman of exalted Worth and two Months seem to have made a great Progress with Mrs  Brookes  And that in Favour of a Gentleman whom we all think unworthy of her at all  My dear Bosomfriend my Schoolfellow my Companion as well in the  maiden  as in the  matrimonial  tho' I bless God not in the  vidual  State resolve me these Questions answer to me for this Conduct account to me for these seeming unaccountable Motives and thereby justify yourself to your  Reputation  to the  Memory  of the  dear Departed  to your  own Sex  to the  other Sex  so attentive  as they  both  are to your Conduct in this Particular and lastly which will for ever oblige me to  Your affectionate and Faithful Friend and Servant  LETTER CXLVIII From a Gentleman strenuously expostulating with an old rich Widow about to marry a very young gay Gentleman  Madam  I AM very sorry to hear of the Encouragement you give to the Visits of young Mr  Barnes  because of the great Difference in Years between you I cannot help giving you the Trouble of this Expostulation tho' I am told and much affected I am with the News if it be true that the Matter between you is so far gone that all I can say may too probably prove ineffectual  Our Sex Madam in all your late Husband's Time has received an Advantage and a Credit from your Conduct in the marry'd State and now I wish it may not receive as great a Disparagement since the prudent Mrs  Bates  thinks fit to countenance the Addresses of one who was born after she was marry'd and a Mother and who can possibly have no other Inducement than your Fortune I believe Madam you never knew one happy Marriage of this sort in all your Life And you will reflect that you will not be intitled to Pity nor the young Man to Censure if he should prove the worst and most profligate of Husbands to you For every one will censure  you  and acquit  him  should he even treat you with personal Abuse and Barbarity  Besides it is well known that Mr  Barnes  is a young Man of no very promising Inclinations Some young Gentlemen are as grave and discreet at Twentyfive as others at Thirtyfive But he has all the Vanity the Gaiety the Affectation of any one at his Time of Life And can you expect that he will treat  you  well that was never noted for treating his  own Mother  very dutifully who by the way is  younger  than yourself Advanced Years are the constant Subject of Ridicule with such wild young Fellows to their Shame be it spoken and what can you expect when the very Motives by which you shall be supposed to be acted in such a Match will involve you in the deepest Censure will make you the Contempt of Persons of all Ages and both Sexes and expose you to the low Buffoonery even of the Man you have chosen who instead of being your Protector as a Husband ought to be will probably be the Person who will  lead the Jest  that all will join in upon you in order to excuse his own sorbid Choice  You owe it Madam give me Leave to say to the  Memory  of your late worthy  Husband  you owe it to your  Sex  you owe it to  yourself  and your  own Interest  and  future Good  nay to  Decency  I will venture to add to proceed no further in this Affair It seems to me to be next to a Degree of Incest for a Woman all hoary and greygoosed over by Time or who will be soon so to expose herself to the Embraces of a young Fellow who is not so old as her first Son would have been had he lived Forgive me Madam but I cannot help this Plaindealing on the Occasion If you proceed in giving Encouragement to the Boy's Address I expect not nor can I desire to be forgiven  or to stand upon common Terms with you If otherwise I am ready to ask your Pardon but I cannot with Patience think that Mrs  Bates  who has passed thro' every Station  hitherto  with so much Applause as well that of the prudent  Widow  and exemplary  Matron  as the affectionate  Wife  should give so great a Wound to our Sex as she will do if she makes such a Boy as Mr  Barnes  the Successor to her late worthy Husband and the Master of her Person and Fortune By which Act she will vow Obedience to one who was in a Cradle when she had Children of her own who were rising from it and who would undoubtedly despise her in this Light were it not for her Wealth all of which that he can get at by Force or fair Means if he acts by you as others generally have done in the same Circumstances will be squander'd away upon rival Objects more suitable to his Youth while you will be the Laughingstock and Scorn of such as will revel in  your  Spoils and triumph over you by the Help of your own  Fortune  Mean time you will be so far from engaging the Pity of your Sex that the more considerate of them will shun and contemn you as one who has brought a Disgrace upon it The Men will despise and flout you and you will have nothing to do but to hide in a contemn'd Obscurity that greygreen Head which has so inconsiderately involved you in so much Distress and to turn Penitent for it and pray for an End to a miserable Life which come when it will will give Cause of Joy and Triumph to your young Husband and very little Sorrow to any other Person  But I hope still for better things and I hope for Pardon for this Freedom for fain would I be thought by Mrs  Bates  Her affectionate and faithful Friend and humble Servant  The following Eleven Epistles may serve as Models for Letters to write by on the like Occasion likewise to give a brief Description of  London  and  Westminster  to such as have not seen those Cities and to point out to those who never were in Town before what is most worthy of Notice in it  LETTER CXLIX From a young Lady in Town to her Aunt in the Country  I Describing the  Tower    Monument    St Paul  's c  Honoured Madam  YOU will have me write you down Accounts of what I see remarkable in and about  London  to keep me as you say out of Idleness and to entertain my good Friends in my Absence I will obey tho' your good Opinion of me I am sensible will be no small Disadvantage to me for I shall convince you more effectually than ever of my Defects and want of that Ability to entertain my absent Friends which their Partiality had made them expect from me  To begin then my Aunt and Cousins carried me in the first Place to see the Tower of  London  which we have heard so much Talk of in the Country and which no one that visits this great Town omits seeing 'Tis situated by the  Thames  Side surrounded with an old Wall about a Mile in Compass with a broad deep Ditch which has generally more Mud in it than Water All round  the outward Wall are Guns planted which on extraordinary Occasions are fired as on more common ones they fire only Rows of others which are fixed in the Ground on the Wharf by the  Thames  At the Entrance on the Righthand we saw the Collection of wild Beasts kept there as Lions Panthers Tygers  c  also Eagles Vulturs  c  We were then carried to the Mint where we saw the manner of coining Money and striking Medals  c  From thence we went to the Jewelhouse and were shewn the Crown and the other Regalia which gave me no small Pleasure as I had never seen these things before and heard so much Talk of them  The HorseArmory is a fine Sight for here they shew Fifteen of our  English  Monarchs on Horseback all in rich Armour attended with Guards But I think this Sight not comparable to the small Armory for here Pikes Muskets Swords Halberds and Pistols enow as they told us for threescore thousand Men are all placed in such beautiful Order and such various Figures representing the Sun Star and Garter Halfmoons and suchlike that I was greatly delighted with the Sight all the Arms being bright and shining  We saw the Train of Artillery in what they call the Grand Storehouse filled with Cannon and Mortars all very fine a Divingbell and other Curiosities and I thought upon the whole that this great Magazine of Curiosities and Stores was the most worthy of the Notice of a Stranger to  London  of any thing I had been shewn  From hence they carried me to the  Monument  built in Remembrance of the Fire of  London  a very curious Pillar from the Gallery of which we had a Survey of the whole City But as it stands  low I cannot say but I liked the Prospect from  St Paul  's Cupola much better when I was carried up thither which was Yesterday for that being the highest Situation in the City and more in the Centre of  London  and  Westminster  commands a finer View over both Cities  Hampstead  and  Highgate  Hills  Surrey  the River  c  The Cathedral is a most noble Building and I admired it not a little for its Choir Chapels Dome Whisperingplace Vaults below and other Curiosities too tedious to mention  This Madam may serve for one Letter and to shew you how much I am desirous by my Obedience to your Commands to approve myself  Your dutiful Niece  LETTER CL From the same  II Describing other remarkable Places in and about  London  and  Westminster  which are generally shewn to Strangers  Honoured Madam  I HAVE seen the Customhouse a Place of Hurry and Business with a crouded and inconvenient Key compared to that of  Bristol St Thomas  's and  Guy  's Hospitals  Southwark  all most noble Charities  St Bartholomew  's a still nobler but which by its additional Buildings seems to be in a way to swallow up its own Revenues by pulling down their Tenants Houses which contributed Means to support the Charity  Smithfield  also a spacious Market for live Cattle  c  as I should have said I had  Leadenhall  Market a  Prodigy of its Kind and the Admiration of Foreigners  Sadler'swells  at  Islington  I have been at and seen there the Diversions of Ropedancing Volting Singing Musick  c  which I thought well enough for once  Islingtonwells  or the  New Tunbridge  I have been at the Walks and Rooms neat enough and good Decorum observ'd in both  The Bluecoat Hospital I have also seen another noble Charity and the pretty Sight of the Children at Church and at Supper of  Sunday  Night which much pleased me The Charterhouse too another noble Charity  Also the  Guildhall  of  London  a handsome Building adorn'd with Pictures and with the Trophies of the Duke of  Marlborough  's Victory over the  French  and the preposterous wooden Figures of the two famous Giants The Royal Exchange likewise a very fine Edifice but they say the Statues of the Kings and Queens there are ill done except that of  Charles  II in the Middle of the Area and one or two more  I have also been carried to  Westminsterhall  and the two Houses where the Lords and Commons meet They are by no means answerable to what I expected tho' the House of Commons is the neatest and very convenient for hearing and seeing too  Westminsterhall  like  Guildhall  is adorned with more of the Duke of  Marlborough  's Trophies and it has Shops on each Side for Milaners Booksellers and suchlike Trades Here the CoronationFeast is kept and here are held as you know the Courts of Chancery King'sbench Common Pleas and up Stairs the Court and Offices of the Exchequer  The Abbey we are to see another time being obliged to dine at  Westminster  with a Friend of my Cousin's  Somersethouse  in the  Strand  I have seen noted for its pleasant Garden fronting the River and it is indeed a fine Palace itself designed for the Residence of the Queens Dowager of  England  when we have such a Personage  Marlborough  House in the Park is finely furnished and adorned with Pictures of the Duke's Battles  St James  's House is a poor Palace for a King of  England  but it seems convenient on the Inside  Buckingham  House stands better than that for commanding the beautiful Park and Canal The Treasury a fine new Building  Whitehall  whose Glory is the Banquettinghouse justly admir'd for its Architecture by  Inigo Jones  and Inside Painting by  Rubens  It is a noble Situation for a Palace which were it to be built like this would be the most magnificent in the World  We took Coach another time and were carried thro' the principal Squares and new Buildings about  London  and  Westminster  which are highly worth seeing such as  Lincoln'sInn  Square  Lincoln'sInn  Fields  St James  's Square  Soho  Square  Hanover  Square  Cavendish  Square and  Grosvenor  Square with the Multitude of stately Buildings and noble Streets contiguous to the latter a Sight worthy of Admiration  This Madam may serve for a second Letter and another Instance tho' a poor one of that Obedience which will always bind me to be  Your dutiful Niece  LETTER CLI From the same  III Describing  Chelsea  Hospital and  Kensington  Palace  Honoured Madam  I HAVE been carried by my obliging Cousins to  Chelsea  College about a Mile from  St James  's Park and to  Kensington  Palace about two Miles West from  London  The College you know was founded by King  Charles  II and finished by the late King  William  for the Reception of superannuated Officers and Soldiers It is situated on the Banks of the  Thames  its Gardens extending quite down to the River It is a neat and stately Building the Front looking to the  Thames  has a fine Hall on one Side and a neat Chapel on the other with a noble Pavilion as they call it between them The two Sides are four Stories high and have two Wards in each Story containing thirtysix neat Bedrooms each for so many Soldiers Each Corner of this main Building is adorned with a fine Pavilion being the Governor's Lodging and Councilchamber Lodgings for Officers  c  In the Middle of the Square is a Brass Statue of King  Charles  II on a Marble Pedestal  There are besides four other large and uniform Wings one is the Infirmary for the Sick a second for maimed Officers a third for Officers of the College the fourth for Servants The Whole is a neat convenient and airy Building well worth a Stranger's View  Kensington  Palace is a very pretty Summer Retirement for the Court It is adorn'd with fine Pictures  rich Hangings and other Ornaments But the Gardens which have been much augmented of late Years are delightful and we diverted ourselves in walking round them which gave me great Pleasure and I could not but wish that you Madam were with me because you love walking and would have been much pleased with these charming Gardens which abound with fine Walks  c  A noble Piece of Water called the  Serpentine  River but for what Reason I know not it being a strait and not winding Piece presents itself to View and there is lately a new Road made thro'  Hydepark  to  Kensington  by the late Q  Caroline  to keep the Gardens clear from Dust in the Summer and make them more private from Horses Passengers Coaches  c  for the old Road in one Part ran almost close to the Wall A Row of Lamps from one End to the other of this Road is placed on each Side of it when the Court is there which is a Beauty as well as Convenience  Will this Madam serve for a third Letter on the Subject you have prescribed to  Your everdutiful Niece  LETTER CLII From the same  IV Describing  Greenwich  Park and the Passage to it by Water  Honoured Madam  LAST  Tuesday  being  Easter Tuesday  I went with my Uncle Aunt and Cousins down the River on what they call a  Party of Pleasure  but with Design principally to see  Greenwich  Park and Hospital  We took Water at the Tower which I described in my first Letter I was pretty much afraid of Danger from Anchors Cables and suchlike as we passed by the great Numbers of Ships that lay in our Way at first setting out But afterwards the River looked very pleasant and the Number of Boats all rowing with the Tide made the River look very agreeably  After sailing not many Miles we come within Sight of the Dockyard at  Deptford  where several large Ships upon the Stocks afforded a fine Prospect as the naval Strength of  England  is both its Glory and its Defence  Next to  Deptford  I was greatly pleased with the Prospect of the Royal Hospital at  Greenwich  for Seamen grown old in the Service of their Country When we landed we went into this fine Building and in the  Inside  every thing in my Judgment was perfectly agreeable to the Magnificence of the  Outside  allowing the one to be designed to do Honour to the Nation the other to support a Number of necessitous People who ought to be the publick Care The great Hall and the Paintings in it are admirable but I know not whether they would not better suit a  Palace  than an  Hospital  and indeed this may be said of the whole Building  From thence we went into the Park where I beheld divers odd Scenes of Holidayfolks Here appeared a rakish young Fellow with two or three Women who look'd like Servantmaids the Hero delighted the Nymphs smiling round himThere a carefullooking Father with his Children on each Side Trains of admiring Lovers readypair'd followed one another in thronging Crouds at the Gate a SeaOfficer with a Lady not overburdened with Modesty in her Behaviour A Croud of City Apprentices some with  some without their Lasses Half a dozen Beaux ogling all they met And several seemingly disconsolate Virgins walking alone The Concourse of middling Objects pressed chiefly toward a high Hill in the Middle of the Park where as they arrived their Business was to take hold of Hands and run down as fast as possible amidst the Huzza's of a Multitude of People who earnestly expected to see the Women fall in hopes that their Cloaths would not lie so conveniently when they were down as might be wished  This Madam is a Diversion you would not expect so near the polite City of  London  but I assure you such a Levity possessed almost every body assembled on this Occasion as made the Park though most beautiful in itself no way entertaining to  Your most dutiful Niece  LETTER CLIII From the same  V Describing  Bethlehem  Hospital  Honoured Madam  YOU tell me in your last that my Descriptions and Observations are very superficial and that both my Uncle and yourself expect from me much better Accounts than I have yet given you for I must deliver my  Opinion  it seems on what I see as well as tell you what I have been shewn 'Tis well I left my bettermost Subjects to the last such I mean as will best bear Reflection and I must try what I can do to regain that Reputation which your Indulgence rather than my Merit had formed for me in your kind  ThoughtsYet I doubt I shan't please you after all But 'tis my Duty to try for it and it will be yours I had almost said to forgive Imperfections which I should have concealed but for your undeserved good Opinions of me which draw them into Light  I have this Afternoon been with my Cousins to gratify the odd Curiosity most People have to see  Bethlehem  or  Bedlam  Hospital  A more affecting Scene my Eyes never beheld and surely Madam any one inclined to be proud of human Nature and to value themselves above others cannot go to a Place that will more effectually convince them of their Folly For there we see Man destitute of every Mark of Reason and Wisdom and levelled to the Brute Creation if not beneath it and all the Remains of good Sense or Education serve only to make the unhappy Person appear more deplorable  I had the Shock of seeing the late polite and ingenious Mr  in one of these woful Chambers We had heard you know of his being somewhat disordered but I did not expect to find him here No sooner did I put my Face to the Grate but he leap'd from his Bed and called me with frightful Fervency to come into his Room The Surprize affected me pretty much and my Confusion being observed by a Croud of Strangers I heard it presently whisper'd That I was his Sweetheart and the Cause of his Misfortune My Cousin assured me such Fancies were frequent upon these Occasions But this Accident drew so many Eyes upon me as obliged me soon to quit the Place  I was much at a Loss to account for the Behaviour of the Generality of People who were looking at these melancholy Objects Instead of the Concern I think unavoidable at such a Sight a  sort of Mirth appeared on their Countenances and the distemper'd Fancies of the miserable Patients most unaccountably provoked Mirth and loud Laughter in the unthinking Auditors and the many hideous Roarings and wild Motions of others seemed equally entertaining to them Nay so shamefully inhuman were some among whom I am sorry to say it were several of my own Sex as to endeavour to provoke the Patients into Rage to make them Sport  I have been told this dreadful Place is often used for the Resort of lewd Persons to meet and make Assignments But that I cannot credit since the Heart must be abandon'd indeed that could be vicious amidst so many Examples of Misery and of such Misery as being wholly involuntary may overtake the most secure  I am no great Admirer of publick Charities as they are too often managed but if we consider the Impossibility of poor Peoples bearing this Misfortune or providing suitably for the Distempered at their own Beings no Praise can surely be too great for the Founders and Supporters of an Hospital which none can visit without receiving the most melancholy  Proof  of its being needful I am with Respects where due honoured Madam  Your most dutiful Niece  LETTER CLIV From the same  VI Diversions of  Vauxhall  described  Honoured Madam  I WENT on  Monday  last to  Vauxhall  Gardens whither every body must go or appear a sort of Monster in polite Company For the Convenience  of Waterage as well as of Conversation we were a pretty large Company and the Evening proved serene and clear  The Passage from  Somerset  Stairs where we took Water was pleasant enough the  Thames  at Highwater being a most beautiful River especially above  Westminster  where the green Banks and the open Country afford a very agreeable Prospect The Place we landed at was crouded with Boats and from the Waterside to the Gardens we walked through a double Line of gaping Watermen Footmen old Beggarwomen and Children As soon as we entered the Walks I was pleased with a sort of Stage or Scaffold raised at the Entrance for the Servants of the Company to sit out of their Masters way and yet within Call of the Waiters  The Musickgallery and Organ look perfectly polite and their being raised one Story from the Ground has a good Effect upon the Musick The Walks are well enough but environ'd with paltry wooden Boards where I expected at least a good Brickwall One Part of the Whole is thrown into Walks only the other is on the Sides filled with Seats or Arbours with painted Backs on each of which is represented some Scene of our most common Plays or the youthful Representation of the Infant Games  c  I happened to have at my Back honest  Hob  come dripping wet out of the Well and the young Fellows under Colour of shewing their Taste in observing the Beauties of the Piece were so perpetually staring in our Faces that Cousin  Bet  and I had little Pleasure in our Supper Perhaps you will wonder at our Supping in so open a Place but I assure you Madam no Lady is too tender for so fashionable a Repast My Uncle treated us very chearfully but I could not help grudging the Expence he was at  for when the Reckoning was paid it amounted to no less than Ten Shillings a Head which I think too dear as the Entrancemoney must be sufficient to defray the House and Musick But as the Whole is devoted to Pleasure the Expence seems rather to create Satisfaction than Distaste as it gives an Opportunity to gallant People to oblige those they love or pretend to love in order most of them to pay themselves again with large Interest  The Figure of Mr  Handel  a great Master of Musick stands on one Side the Gardens and looks pretty enough The Musick plays from Five to Ten about three Tunes I believe I should have said Pieces in an Hour They are all reported to be the best Performers who assist here but my rough Ears cannot distinguish  About Ten o' Clock many People think of Home But the Votaries of  Cupid  I am told about that Time visit the remotest Walks and sigh out the soft Passion in Accents that may possibly be improved by the melting Sweetness of the MusickI would not have you from hence conclude any Rudeness can be offered for at the Termination of every Walk through the whole Garden is placed a Man to protect the Company from all manner of Insult But when the Place grows thin of Company the Lovers have a better Chance to escape being laugh'd at on the Appearance of any amorous Symptom  Soon after Ten we returned to our Boat and I found the Passage extremely cold notwithstanding a Covering over us I must own I wish'd to be at home long before I reached it for I was taken with such a Shivering as did not leave me for two Days  Thus Madam have I been at  Vauxhall  with the Crowd of Fashionhunters But if nobody had a greater Inclination than I have to go thither again that Amusement would soon be given upFor I see more and more that do what I will Nature never designed me to be polite and I can sincerely declare that I take more Satisfaction in an Eveningwalk with you up the  Westgrove  where I am so often benefited by your good Instructions than in the inchanting Shades of the somuch celebrated  Vauxhall  I am honoured Madam  Your most dutiful Niece  LETTER CLV From the same  VII An Account of  WestminsterAbbey  Honoured Madam  I HAVE this Afternoon been at  WestminsterAbbey  and not a little pleased with what I have seen there If there can be Majesty in the Grave here we see it And such was the solemn Effect the sacred Repository had upon me that I never found an awful Reverence equal to what I felt on that Occasion Whatever be the Intention of erecting these costly Monuments they seem to me very capable of being made an excellent Sermon to succeeding Generations for here the most sumptuous Piles serve only to shew that every one of us must submit to the same Fate that has overtaken those whom Empire itself could not save And how humble ought the Person to be who surveys the Royal Ruins of Mortality preserved as if in a vain Defiance  of Time to shew nothing more than the Certianty of our Dissolution  These Madam were my general Sentiments on this Occasion but as I know you expect more particular Descriptions from me I will tell you what most struck my Notice among the many remarkable Curiosities to be here met with  Among the Royal Monuments those of antient Date pleased me best because they look agreeable to what I read of the plain Royalty of our former Sovereigns I lamented the Loss of  Henry  the Fifth's Head which being Silver as they say was stolen during the Civil War I much wonder it has never yet been supply'd from some of his Busto's He wanted not a  Head  to speak in the metaphorical Style while living and  France  can testify that his  Heart  deserved all things of  English  Men For he was the Terror of the one and the Glory of the other  Henry  the Seventh's Chapel in every Part of it is surprisingly magnificent and beautiful and as far as I can judge of such Things far surpasses all I have seen either of antient or modern Date  In this Chapel is the Chair in which our Kings for many Ages have been crown'd 'Tis very plain and looks as if it were not worth more than the Forfeit paid for sitting in it  The Body of Queen  Catharine  Consort to  Henry  the Fifth was shewn us in an open Coffin and what remains of Skin looks like black discoloured Parchment She is said to have been very beautiful and surely to view her now is a most effectual Antidote against the Vanity rising from that dangerous Accomplishment  Two Embassadors Coffins are kept here said to be detained for want of having their Debts discharged This indeed does little Credit to the  Crown they served but I can scarce think it the Dishonour design'd them to be reposited among the Remains of our Kings tho' indeed several of  them  have their Debts unpaid too as I am told  Several Effigies are preserved in Wax particularly those of King  William  and his excellent Queen  Mary  as also very lately the truly Royal Queen  Anne  To be sure this is no bad Way for a few Years to preserve their Likeness but I know not whether such gay Representations suit the Solemnity of a Sepulchre And yet some that stand here seem not to have deserved that Distinction if it be deemed one in Favour of their Memories General  Monk  if I were to judge would be one of those for his constant Train of Hypocrisy for a long time seem'd a Contradiction to the Apostolical Precept  Not to do Evil that Good may come of it  A Duchess of  Richmond  who walked at King  Charles  the Second's Coronation never was remarkable for any thing as I can hear but that  A very costly Effigy of the late Duke of  Buckinghamshire  is in this Place who was somewhat remarkable in his Time but chiefly for doing what pleased himself whether any body else was pleased or better'd by it or not And what is odd enough the present Duchess stands by him Her Son too the last Duke who died just before he came of Age is distinguished with an Ostentation superior to all the rest tho' all I can learn of him is that he was a hopeful young Nobleman and the Darling of his Mother  General  Monk  whom I mentioned before in a Habit mourning the Power of Time stands in a Posture so very fierce as to seem rather intended to scare Children than for any other Purpose  I had almost forgot his Royal Master King  Charles  the Second who stands in his Garter  Robes and has long been admired by all Comers it seems for restoring Monarchy for I can remember no worthy Actions in his History nor were we told any more by the Person who exposed his Image to our View  Many Reasons make it necessary for the Wills of deceased Persons to be literally observed tho' some Instances of this kind do little Honour to the Deceased as a Monument erected to the Consort of a noble Lord for whom a Vacancy being left on his Tomb as for his second Wife she because she could not take the Righthand of his first Lady left strict Order to be bury'd where her Bones now lie and thereby has transmitted her Pride and Folly to succeeding Ages  Near this Tomb is the Figure of a Lady bleeding to Death by pricking her Finger She was Maid of Honour to Queen  Elizabeth  and I think of the  Russel  Family It seems she got her fatal Wound at her Needle and such has been the Care of the Ladies who have succeeded her that not one has fallen under the like Misfortune ever since  If I shall not quite tire you I will proceed with this Subject in my nextAnd am mean time honoured Madam  Your most dutiful Niece  LETTER CLVI From the same  VIII Account of  WestminsterAbbey  continued  Honoured Madam  I NOW trouble you with an Account of what most struck my Attention in the outward Ayles of  WestminsterAbbey  At entering the Northgate a Monument of prodigious Size and great Expence stood on my Lefthand It is that of  John Holles  late Duke of  Newcastle  and all that is left him out of upwards of  l  a Year as they tell me he had accumulated and the two Heirs not much the richer for their Shares of it neither I hope as we say in our Country Phrase  it was honestly got  Next to this is one consecrated to the Memory of the Duke that preceded him the last of his Name of the  Cavendish  Family as the other was of the  Holles  with the celebrated Lady his Duchess  Margaret  a great Writer and a great Chymist you know we have her Olio both lying Side by Side on a Tomb made great by their Names and distinguished by their Adventures but as to outward Grandeur wholly eclipsed by the former Behind these is a large Room or little Chapel separated from the publick Places in which are reposited the  Holles  Family One of these Gentlemen has at his Feet the Representation of a wild Boar in Token of his having killed one of those Animals when he was on a Croisade Another has a large black Patch over his Righteye having lost an Eye on the like Expedition  Not far from hence a fine Monument stands to the Memory of Dr  Chamberlen  a Manmidwife of no great Fame when living but who happened to have the Esteem of the present Duchess of  Buckingham  who erected this to his Memory  A magnificent Monument stands near this of a Lady whose Name is  Carteret  and some Reports assign an odd Cause for her Death  viz  the late  French  King's saying  A Lady one of his Nobles compared to her was the handsomest of the two  A fine Monument of Lord  Courcey  stands near this on which we are told One of his Ancestors had a Privilege granted of wearing his Hat before the KingHere are several Monuments of Gentlemen who fell in the late Wars Col  Bringfield  in particular who had his Head shot off by a Cannon Ball as he was mounting the Duke of  Marlborough  who had a Horse shot under him Those of others who were famous for different Talents as my Favourite  Purcel  and Dr  Crofts  for Musick decorate the North Isle at the Head of which stands Sir  Godfrey Kneller  Painter to his late Majesty but with a Copy of Verses on it that Judges say are not very extraordinary and yet Mr  Pope  's Name is affixed to them In a Corner that answers to it on the Southside of the Westgate stands a curious Resemblance of  James Craggs  Esq  Secretary of State in erected by a certain Duchess for what Reason is not said Mr  Pope  has been lavish of his Praises much more being engraved on this Gentleman's Monument of his Virtue  c  than I ever heard anywhere else But they say he was a companionable Man as some call it and easy of AccessA small Distance from this is a Monument erected by another Duchess Sister of the former to the Memory of Mr  Congreve  from the great Esteem she bore him So here are three Monuments erected to three Favourites by three Duchesses What a generous Sex is ours who carry their Esteem for the Merit of those they favour beyond the Grave On the same Side of the Church is a very slight Monument of the great Earl  Godolphin  who was Ld High Treasurer during the prosperous Part of Queen  Anne  's Reign and the mean Appearance this makes when compared with those of Mr  Craggs  Mr  Congreve  Dr  Chamberlen  c makes a Spectator sensible that  a Judgment of the Deceased's Merits must not be formed from their Monuments nor as is to be hoped the Gratitude and Affection of their Descendents either Sir  Cloudesly Shovel  has great Honour done him his Monument being erected at the Expence of his Royal Mistress But I thought he was a rough  honest Tar  yet his Effigies makes him a  great Beau  with a fine flowing fullbottom'd Periwig such a one but much finer and more in Buckle than that we have seen our Lawyer Mr  Kettleby  wear at our Assizes  Mr  Thynne  's Murder is prettily represented on his TombBut before I step into what is call'd the  Poets Row  I must return to the Door of the Choir on the Northside of which is placed a noble Monument of the great Sir  Isaac Newton  which I humbly apprehend to be needless for has he not built for himself a much finer Monument and a much more durable one than Marble And will it not outlast this we see here and the Abbey which contains it He lies in a contemplative Posture leaning on the Volumes that have made his Name immortal Opposite to him at the South Entrance of the same Door is a very grand Pile to the Memory of the late Earl  Stanhope  a brave Soldier tho' unfortunate in one Battle and a Man of great Probity  On one Side of the Poets are Dr  South  and Dr  Busby  the one an humorous and witty Divine the other as remarkable a Schoolmaster being famous for his Discipline and Severity  Geoffry Chaucer  has reach'd us  Spencer  is near him  Philips  not far from  Spencer Ben Johnson  is written on a poor Bust and  Butler  put up by a Printer to make his own Name famous bears him Company I would fain not name  Matt Prior  but his Monument is so beautiful and large  and his Busto so admirable being a Present to the Poet by the  French  King  Lewis  XIV that I must not pass it over tho' poor Man it serves only to proclaim his Vanity being erected at his own Desire and Expence A sad Instance of Pride beyond the Grave Behind him stands Mr  Gay  in a Place consecrated to Mortality declaring  Life is a Jest  c  Dryden  has only his Name on his Bust  Milton  has lately been put up by a Gentleman who after the Printer's Example abovementioned has a Mind to engraft his own Fame on the other's Stock but in this outdoes Mr  Barber  For after dedicating Six single  Letters  to the Poet's Name  MILTON  he bestows many Words upon his own not being content to name the little Honours he the Erector now enjoys but the lesser ones which he possessed in the former Reign and from this Example the Architect who no doubt was  paid  for his Labour has Seven Words to his Fame declaring That  Rysbrack was the Statuary who cut it  Here's fine engrafting Work for you However  Milton  's Memory is a Tree that will do Honour to the weakest Scyon that shall sprout from it or even to a Dunghill were such a thing to lie at its Root But of our Poets I'll add no more for  Shakespeare  is not among them I am Madam  Your most obedient Niece  LETTER CLVII From the same  IX On a Concert or Musical Entertainment  Honoured Madam  I WENT last Night to see or rather to hear a new Entertainment of Musick And must confess  is much disappointed of the Pleasure I  promised myself I can't say but I liked two or three of the Songs well enough and the Musick that was playing all the while I did not disapprove But pray Madam can you tell me for I have already asked twenty not one of whom will answer me What is the Reason of having every Word spoken squeaked toI cannot say a Tune but to such a  Hum  as makes me quite sick If it be the Musick that is valuable why must the Words torture it And if the Words be sought after wherefore should they be broken to Pieces by Notes that drown the Sound and quite lose their Sense What I mean is I believe called Speaking in Recitative but whence was this Mode of Speech taken In what Country is it natural And if it be natural nowhere of what is it an Imitation What are the Marks of its Excellencies and how shall we judge of its Merit Whence can arise any Pleasure from hearing it And shall we find Cause for excusing the Time lost in such an unnatural Amusement For myself I must own 'twas far from delighting me for as it was neither singing nor speaking I could not tell what to make of it for it was more like to make me cry than laugh I was so provoked when the Twang of the Harpsichord robbed me of the Word the whole preceding Line depended uponI must confess myself for downright Speaking or Singing I hate Mongrels Unless my Judgment be convinced by such Reasons as I can't for my Life hit upon at present Yet after all I begin to think I am betraying my Ignorance all this time and so I'll conclude myself Madam  Your most dutiful Niece  LETTER CLVIII From the same  X On the Diversions of the Playhouse  Honoured Madam  NOW I have by your Indulgence tarry'd in Town till the Approach of Winter you will expect that I should give you a little Account of the Diversions of the Stage To begin then My Cousin  William  and his two Sisters conducted me last Night to the Playhouse and we took Places in the Pit  You may believe I was agreeably surprised at the Magnificence of the Stage and its elegant Ornaments and I was mightily pleased to see such a prodigious Number of People seated with Ease and conveniently placed to hear the natural Pitch of a common Voice I did not expect to find the Musick so near the Audience but believe  that  the most proper Situation to convey the Sound over the whole Theatre  The Play I saw was a Comedy in which the Parts acted by Women had several Speeches that I thought not quite consistent with the Modesty of the Sex And the Freedom of their Voice and Gestures tho' perhaps suitable enough to the Characters they represented were not so pleasing to a Mind bent upon innocent Amusement if not wholly upon Instruction as Speeches that put us not to the Expence of a Blush What Hardship must it be to the Minds of these Women to enter first upon this Employment How must their Virtue and sure no Woman is without Virtue at her Entrance into the World be shock'd to offer themselves for the Entertainment of Six  hundred Men and to utter Words which convey Ideas too gross for a modest Ear and such as would be difficult to hear in private Company without Confusion How hard then must the Utterance of them be to a numerous and gay Assembly And yet I am assured several Women who get their Bread upon the Stage are strictly virtuous If such there are how great must be their Merit when compared with that of the wicked ones of our Sex who are liable to none of their certain and numerous Temptations But yet where it can be avoided why should Women expose themselves to certain Dangers if there is a Possibility of obtaining a tolerable Subsistence without it And those who can live by Performance upon the Stage certainly require Qualifications more than sufficient to subsist in safer and less dependent Stations  The Behaviour of the Men I did not so much wonder at for a becoming Assurance in them is rather pleasing than disobliging Nor did I perceive that so many Expressions which are oftener miscalled  arch  than more truly named  obscene  were put into the Mouths of the Men as of the Women tho' the Reason the Poets have for this I cannot guess  The Conduct of the Company I thought to the highest Degree commendable The utmost Decency was observed and I saw nothing disagreeable to the strictest Politeness or good Manners the Awe given by so great an Audience of Persons of Taste being too much to admit any thing but what is decent and obliging Not that I think it adviseable for Women to go alone to the Playhouse for the  Complaisance  so fashionable at present affords a sort of  Occasion  for laying them under such seeming Obligations as cannot be  returned  and ought therefore not to be accepted  These dear Madam are the rough Thoughts on this Occasion of  Your dutiful Niece  LETTER CLIX From the same  XI The Play and the low Scenes of  Harlequinery  after it described and exposed  Honoured Madam  HAving as I told you in my last seen a Comedy I was next carried by my Cousin  William  and his kind Sisters to a Tragedy which was that of  Hamlet  And I was greatly moved with the Play and pleased with the Action But the low Scenes of  Harlequinery  that were exhibited afterwards filled me with high Disgust insomuch that I could for their sake have wished I had not seen the other I will give you an Account of this dismal Piece of farcical dumb Shew  We were then presented with the most extraordinary Gentleman I ever beheld who with the ugliest Face and most apish Behaviour I ever saw had the most amazing Success in his Amours with Ladies whose Appearance deserved a more amiable Gallant  My Cousin  William  told me the Name of this Hero was MR HARLEQUIN but as you know  Billy  has no great Capacity you will be the less surprised to hear he answered not one Question I asked him to my Satisfaction  Whom does that Character represent Cousin  Harlequin  Pray of what Nation is the Gentleman  France  What is his Business on the Stage  To be admired by every Woman who sets Eyes on him  Why seem they so fond of him  Because he is  Harlequin  Why is his Face black  Harlequin  's was never of any other Colour  Who is the Lady with whom he appears to be in the strictest Engagement  Colombine  Who is she  Colombine  Whence came she pray Cousin  From  France  Is she married or single  Mostly married and at  Harlequin  's Service in spite of her Husband's Teeth  Why so  Because  Colombine  is to be at his Beck on every Occasion  For what Reason  Because they never appear without one another  Is this Nature  It is Fashion and that's as good  Why don't these worthy Persons favour us with a Song  They never speak  How must I understand them  By the Motion of their Heads Hands and Heels  Have they no Tongues  They must not use them  Why does he wear a wooden Sword  'Tis his Symbol to which whatever obstructs his Wishes must give way  Why  That he may come at  Colombine  against all Obstruction  Why must they needs be together  That the People may laugh  Wherefore should we laugh  Because they are together  Why does MR HARLEQUIN delight so much in jumping  To please his Mistress  Why does she admire him for that  Because he can reach her over other Mens Shoulders  Is that Wit  We laugh at it  So you may but it is more like to set me a crying  You're a Country Lass Cousin  You Cousin are a Town Gentleman  By this Madam you may guess at my Entertainment We had just seen  Hamlet  as I have said My Heart was full of  Ophelia  's Distress and the Prince's Fate had shook my Soul In this State of Mind to sit two Hours to see People run after one another as if they were bewitched only to cuckold a poor simplelooking Husband put me so much out of Patience that I shall not bear the Sight of the Stage for some time And indeed having now run thro' the Diversions of the Town I begin to be desirous of casting myself at your Feet as becomes  Your dutiful Niece  LETTER CLX From a Country Gentleman in Town to his Brother in the Country describing a publick Execution in London  Dear Brother  I HAVE this Day been satisfying a Curiosity I believe natural to most People by seeing an Execution at  Tyburn  The Sight has had an extraordinary Effect upon me which is more owing to the unexpected Oddness of the Scene than the affecting Concern which is unavoidable in a thinking Person at a Spectacle so awful and so interesting to all who consider themselves of the same Species with the unhappy Sufferer  That I might the better view the Prisoners and escape the Pressure of the Mob which is prodigious nay almost incredible if we consider the Frequency of these Executions in  London  which is once a Month I mounted my Horse and accompanied the melancholy Cavalcade from  Newgate  to the fatal Tree The Criminals were Five in Number I was much disappointed at the Unconcern and Carelesness that appeared in the Faces of Three of the unhappy Wretches The Countenances of the other Two were spread with that Horror and Despair which is not to be wonder'd at in Men whose Period of Life is so near with the terrible Aggravation of its being hasten'd by their own voluntary Indiscretion and Misdeeds The Exhortation spoken by the Bellman from the Wall of  St Sepulchre  's Churchyard is well intended but the Noise of the Officers and the  Mob was so great and the silly Curiosity of People climbing into the Cart to take leave of the Criminals made such a confused Noise that I could not hear the Words of the Exhortation when spoken tho' they are as follow  "All good People pray heartily to GOD for these poor Sinners who now are going to their Deaths for whom this great Bell doth toll"  "You that are condemn'd to die repent with lamentable Tears Ask Mercy of the Lord for the Salvation of your own Souls thro' the Merits Death and Passion of Jesus Christ who now sits at the Righthand of God to make Intercession for as many of you as penitently return unto him"  "  Lord have Mercy upon you Christ have Mercy upon you  "  Which last Words the Bellman repeats three times  All the way up  Holborn  the Croud was so great as at every twenty or thirty Yards to obstruct the Passage and Wine notwithstanding a late good Order against that Practice was brought the Malefactors who drank greedily of it which I thought did not suit well with their deplorable Circumstances After this the Three thoughtless young Men who at  first  seemed not enough concerned grew most shamefully daring and wanton behaving themselves in a manner that would have been ridiculous in Men in any Circumstance whatever They swore laugh'd and talk'd obscenely and wish'd their wicked Companions good Luck with as much Assurance as if their Employment had been the most lawful  At the Place of Execution the Scene grew still more shocking and the Clergyman who attended  was more the Subject of Ridicule than of their serious Attention The Psalm was sung amidst the Curses and Quarrelling of Hundreds of the most abandon'd and profligate of Mankind Upon whom so stupid are they to any Sense of Decency all the Preparation of the unhappy Wretches seems to serve only for Subject of a barbarous kind of Mirth altogether inconsistent with Humanity And as soon as the poor Creatures were half dead I was much surprised before such a Number of PeaceOfficers to see the Populace fall to halling and pulling the Carcasses with so much Earnestness as to occasion several warm Rencounters and broken Heads These I was told were the Friends of the Persons executed or such as for the sake of Tumult chose to appear so and some Persons sent by private Surgeons to obtain Bodies for Dissection The Contests between these were sierce and bloody and frightful to look at So that I made the best of my way out of the Crowd and with some Difficulty rode back among a large Number of People who had been upon the same Errand with myself The Face of every one spoke a kind of Mirth as if the Spectacle they had beheld had afforded Pleasure instead of Pain which I am wholly unable to account for  In other Nations common Criminal Exec  tions are said to be little attended by any beside the necessary Officers and the mournful Friends but here all was Hurry and Confusion Racket and Noise Praying and Oaths Swearing and Singing Psalms I am unwilling to impute this Difference in our own to the Practice of other Nations to the Cruelty of our Natures to which Foreigners however to our Dishonour ascribe it In most Instances let them say what they will we are humane beyond what other Nations can boast but  in this the Behaviour of my Countrymen is past my accounting for every Street and Lane I pasted through bearing rather the Face of a Holiday than of that Sorrow which I expected to see for the untimely Deaths of five Members of the Community  One of the Bodies was carried to the Lodging of his Wife who not being in the way to receive it they immediately hawked it about to every Surgeon they could think of and when none would buy it they rubb'd Tar all over it and left it in a Field hardly cover'd with Earth  This is the best Description I can give you of a Scene that was no way entertaining to me and which I shall not again take so much Pains to see I am dear Brother  Yours affectionately  Advice of an Aunt to a Niece in relation to her Conduct in the Addresses made her by Two Gentlemen one a gay fluttering Military Coxcomb the other a Man of Sense and Honour In Five Letters  LETTER CLXI  I The Aunt to the Niece desiring her own Opinion of her Two Lovers  Dear  Lydia  I AM given to understand that you have two new Admirers of very different Tempers and Professions the one Capt  Tomkins  of the Guards the other Mr  Rushford  As I know Mr  Rushford  to be a sensible sedate worthy Gentleman I am a little uneasy lest he should be discouraged for the other And yet as I know not the Merits or Qualifications of the Captain I would not censure you or condemn him right or wrong This makes me desire your Sentiments of both and that you'll acquaint me to which you most incline I have a very high Opinion of your Prudence and can have no View in this Request but your Good Only I must assure you that I have such an Esteem for Mr  Rushford  's Character that the other Gentleman ought to be something more extraordinary than is to be generally met with in his Profession to be preferr'd to him I hope you'll think so too but be this as it will the frank Declaration of your Mind will be very obliging to  Your truly affectionate Aunt  LETTER CLXII  II The Niece's Answer Describing the Behaviour of the sensible Lover  Honoured Aunt  I HAVE on so many Occasions as well of this as other kinds been obliged to your kind Concern for me that I should be very ingrateful if I conceal'd from you the least Byass of my Mind on so important an Occasion I think truly with you that Mr  Rushford  is a very valuable Gentleman yet he is overnice sometimes as to the Company I see and would take upon him a little too much if I did not keep him at a Distance and particularly is so uneasy about the Captain that he wants me to forbear seeing him on any Occasion Now I think this is a little too prescribing for the Time  of our Acquaintance and the small Progress I have hitherto permitted to the Intimacy between us For what is this but surrendering to him upon his own Terms and that too before I am summoned in Form Nothing but a  betrothed  Lover or a  Husband  has surely a Right to expect this Observance and if I were to oblige him it is absolutely putting myself in his Power before he convinces me how he will use it O my dear Aunt these Men I see even the worthiest of them are incroaching CreaturesAnd a Woman that would not be despis'd must not make her Will too cheap an Offering to that of her Admirer Then my dear Aunt I know not how it was with  you  formerly but there is a Pleasure in being admired that affects one very sensibly and I know not whether even Mr  Rushford  would say half the fine Things he does if he had not a Competitor that says nothing else And I think it a kind of Robbery that a Woman commits upon her Pleasures if she  too soon  confines herself to one For she can be but once courted unless such an Event happens that she must have a very bad Heart that can wish for it And why should a Woman absolutely bind herself to the Terms of  For Better or For Worse  before she goes to ChurchI hope when the Ceremony has passed I shall make a very good Wife But why should I buckle to  Honour  and  Obey  when it is all the Time I shall have to be  honoured  and  obeyed  myselfIndeed Aunt I think there is a great deal in this And Mr  Rushford  gives himself wonderful  grave Airs  already As I'll give you an InstanceBut here the Captain is come and I will give you an Account of it in my next For I will lay before you faithfully all my Proceedings with both Gentlemen and their Behaviour and you will be enabled  to judge from my Account  which  I prefer were I not to declare myself as plainly as I am sure I ought to do in every Particular demanded of me by so good an Aunt I am Madam  Your truly dutiful and affectionate Kinswoman  LETTER CLXIII From the same  III Containing the Description of the Behaviour of the same Gentleman which occasions a Lovequarrel  Honoured Aunt  I HOPE the Suspense I gave you by my abrupt breaking off in my last will be forgiven I was going to give you an Instance of Mr  Rushford  's  grave Airs  He comes last  Thursday  with great Formality and calls himself  my humble Servant  and I saw he was pleased to be displeased at something and so look'd as grave as he only bowing my Head and following my Work for I was hemming a Handkerchief  You are very busy Madam  Yes Sir  Perhaps I break in upon you  Not much Sir  I am sorry if I do at all Madam  You see I am pursuing my Work as I was before you came  I do Madam  very gravely said he  But I have known it otherwise when Somebody else has been here  Very likely SirBut then I did as I pleasedso I do nowand who shall controul me  I beg pardon Madam but 'tis my Value for you  That makes you troublesome said I interrupting him  I am sorry for it MadamYour humble Servant  Yours SirSo away he wentWell thought I if thou art to be lost for this and must  put me into bodily Fear every time thou hast a Mind to be grave Adieu to thee  In the Evening he comes again  Mrs  Betty  Is your Lady disingaged Could I be admitted to say one Word to her  I believe so Sir Madam Mr  Rushford  begs to be admitted to say one Word to you He was at the Door and heard me as I know Do you  introduce  him said I with as much Form as he to my Presence He enter'd I rose up with my Hands before me  I see you are angry with me Madam  I am sorry for it Sir said I  Sorry for your Anger I hope Madam  I should be sorry Sir said I if any body should see me angry for nothing  I am sorry Madam that you set as nothing one that has so much Value for you  Mr  Rushford  said I we have so many  Sorry's  between us that I should be pleas'd with a few  Glad's    Why  said he  with this stiff set Air do you delight to vex thus an Heart that you can make  sorry  or  glad  at your Pleasure  Why am I Sir to be treated capriciously and to have my Conduct upbraided when you think proper to be out of Humour  I out of Humour Madam  I thought soWas it in high good Humour that you insulted me with  that Somebody else    I own Madam I cannot bear to see you so gay so pleased and lively when that painted Butterfly is here and so grave so laconick so reserv'd when I pay my Respects to you  Pr'ythee pr'ythee Mr  Rushford  none of these prescribing AirsWhat Right have I given you to use me thus  Madam I hoped my Address was not quite unwelcome  Whatever your Address is your Prescriptions are  I cannot where I so much love bear such a Difference as I always see in your Temper when that Flutterer is here to what I experience  The Difference perhaps may be in the  Men  not in the  Woman As how  Madam  As how Why said I he makes me laugh and if I was to give way to't your grave Airs would make me cry  Thank you Madam said he What's Sport to you is Death to me  And so he sigh'd and took a Turn or two about the RoomI was standing all this time  He came and took my Hand and look'd so silly upon me I half pity'd him  I hope Madam I don't keep you standing  Yes you do Sir  I beg Madam you'll not torture me with this contemptuous Formality  I think I am the most complaisant Creature breathing  To ME Madam do you mean  Yes Sir  You always mean something in your Paradoxes Madam May I ask your Meaning now  When I last sat and pursued my Work you were displeased I now stand and have nothing to do but to be entertain'd in such an agreeable manner as you shall think properest for meyet you are not pleased  Madam  said he  you put me quite beside my PurposesIf I thought you would have it so I would sooner die than be so troublesome to you as I now have Reason to think myself  If you have Reason to think so I hope you are Master of your own Actions said I  Do you forbid me your Presence for ever Madam  I do if you ask it Sir Was not this Madam daring me to answer even worseI  ask it Madam Heaven is my Witness it would be the heaviest thing that could befal me  You would not thus brave it from me if you thought so said I quite nettled  In this manner we went on till we had vex'd one another to some Purpose and then he was so  good  as to give me Leave to sit down and I was so  gracious  as to permit him to sit by me and we parted with no Displeasure on either Side Thus much for Mr  Rushford  and his  grave Airs  My  next shall let you into the Qualifications of his Competitor Till when I am honoured Madam  Your dutiful Kinswoman  LETTER CLXIV  IV From the same Describing her fluttering Pretender  Honoured Madam  INOW give you some Account of the Captain He is a handsome Person of a Man of a good Family Heir to a good Estate Dresses well sings well dances wellSo much for his  good  Qualities As for his others he is insufferably vain talkative is always laughing especially at what he  says himself  and sometimes at the Conceit of what he is  going to say  before he  speaks  He has such an undaunted Assurance that there is no such thing as putting him out of Countenance One Instance I'll give youHe is always admiring himself in the Glass insomuch that while he is in the Room I cannot peep into one without staring him in the Face and one Day rallying him on this I ask'd him how the Glasses were fixed in a Camp He reply'd without Hesitation O Madam the Care our Generals take to pitch our Tents by the Banks of some transparent Stream serves very well for that Purpose And then he laugh'd most egregiously for five or six Minutes together  You may believe Madam from what I have said that I give no great Encouragement to his Visits Yet is there no such thing as getting rid of him for by all his Conduct I plainly see he has swallow'd the ridiculous Opinion that the more  averse a Woman appears to a Man's Addresses the more Ground he has to expect Success and he seems so assured of winning me that I begin to be apprehensive every time he puts his Hand in his Pocket that he will pull out a Licence and a RingIf I admit him into my Company I know not how to get rid of him If I cause myself to be deny'd he plants himself directly against my Window that the whole Neighbourhood may know his Business Thus with or without my Consent he will be either thought my reigning Admirer or he will Don  Quixote  like have me for his  Dulcinea  in spite of my Teeth  He has three or four times  shew'd away  before Mr  Rushford  and as I cannot forbear heartily laughing at the Airs he gives himself tho' for very different Reasons from those by which  his  risible Muscles are moved he thinks me pleased with him and what is more vexatious Mr  Rushford  thinks so too and grows serious and sullen as I instanc'd in my former  Now Madam what can I do I heartily despise my Soldier I greatly regard Mr  Rushford  's good Sense good Breeding and other good Qualities But to forbid this Fop is what I am sure will have no Weight with him for I have as good as done it several times and he tells me he will visit me whether I will or not as long as I am unmarried And to do it professedly in Complaisance to Mr  Rushford  unless Matters had gone further between us is putting myself absolutely in his Power and declaring myself  his  before he asks me the Question So may I not laugh on a little at the one and teize the other's causeless Jealousy do you think till I bring Mr  Rushford  to speak out so explicitly that a Woman of some Niceness as I pretend to be may be in no Danger  of mistaking him Besides I think Mr  Rushford  a little too capricious and should be glad to break him of it lest if it ever should be our Lot to come together that Temper should improve upon him and be more troublesome from an Husband than it is from an humble Servant I should be glad my Conduct might merit the Approbation of so good a Judge but if it do not I will endeavour to conform myself to your Advice For I am and ever will be honoured Madam  Your most dutiful Niece  LETTER CLXV  V From the Aunt containing solid Advice and Caution on this Occasion  Dear  Lydia  YOUR last Letter pleased me much better than your two former For your first held me in great Suspense your second gave me Concern for your rigorous Treatment of poor Mr  Rushford  who 'tis plain loves you much but your third confirms me in the Opinion I always entertain'd of your Prudence in preferring a Man of Sense to a Coxcomb  I must tell you that nothing could give me greater Pleasure than to see you Mr  Rushford  's Bride His Fortune is good his Person manly and agreeable and his Behaviour polite But in my Opinion you have need of all your Prudence and Caution to avoid giving him a lasting Disgust for I would have you always remember my Dear that nothing can give such Dislike to a Man of Wisdom and Discernment as to make him imagine a Fool is preferr'd to him  If Mr  Rushford  did not love you he would not be jealous of such a Fop as you describe and it is enough to keep his Passions awake when he sees you so grave and so severe as I may say to him and so facetious and chearful with the other For many a Woman of Sense in other respects has been caught by some of those ridiculous Airs that such empty Laughers give themselves and if you should carry your Jest too sar it might make him despise a Levity as he would be apt to construe it which he would think unworthy of his Addresses  I know it is but too natural to our Sex to love to be admired but this Humour when not properly bounded and guarded has many times cost us dear even the Happiness of all our Lives Don't be afraid of obliging Mr  Rushford  in a Point so material to his Tranquillity and your own Reputation as the forbidding the Visits of your  Man of Scarlet  For as you  intend  not to encourage him and he has so undaunted an Assurance founded on so much Folly I think if you had no  other  humble Servant it would not be reputable to receive  this  much less when you have one of so different a Cast that Light and Darkness are not more opposite And a Person must have a very indifferent Regard to a Man of Merit who would not give up such a one to his Request for the very Thought of a Competition with such a Rival in so tender and nice a Point must be disgusting to a Man of Sense  And besides you know not my Dear but Mr  Rushford  may be deterr'd from a formal putting the Question to you by the Apprehension that you see his Rival with too much Approbation For can a Man of his Sense think of giving himself up absolutely to a Person who seems to waver in her Judgment which to prefer of two such  Competitors Must not the Mind that can hesitate one Moment on such a Decision appear unworthy of the Character of his Wife  And then as to teizing him for his Jealousy and breaking him of it  aforehand  I doubt this savours a little too much of the ungenerous Tempers of some of our Sex who love to tyrannize when they can Prudence in a Lady is the best Cure of Jealousy in a Gentleman and is the Method you propose of laughing on with the Captain and teizing a worthy Man who undoubtedly loves you a Mark of that PrudenceIndeed I fear if you go on thus you will either lose Mr  Rushford  or will be obliged to keep him at the Expence of a Submission after you have provok'd him proportionable to the Insult he will receive and this my dear Kinswoman will be but little agreeable to the Pride of our  Sex  and a particular Mortification to your  own  One Rule let me give you That the more obliging you are in the Time of  your Power  the more it will move a generous Mind to indulge you in  his  and the Time you may reckon yours may not be Three Months in Proportion to Thirty Years of his or the whole Life And pray my Dear remember that young Ladies assume a Task they are very little qualify'd for when they set up  to break Tempers  and  manage Husbands  before they are  married  Your Prudence will suggest to you a very proper Conduct I am sure to secure a worthy Husband without my writing a Word more Especially as I know it will teach you to overcome the little low Pleasure which some of our Sex take at your Years in being admired and flattered and to conquer the little teizing Pride of perplexing and torturing the Heart of a worthy Admirer  when we think we have it in our Power And so hoping soon to hear that you have banish'd the Captain and are in the way to change the Name of  Fenton  for that of  Rushford  I remain my dear Niece  Your affectionate Aunt  LETTER CLXVI From a Lady to her false Lover who after having brav'd all his Friends Expostulations at last is persuaded to abandon her for another of larger Fortune  SIR  'TIS a poor a very poor Pretence that you make after what has passed between us that you must in Compliance with the Commands of your  Friends  break off Acquaintance with me How often have I advised you to this formerly How often have you vow'd the Impossibility of your doing it How have you in pursuance of this Avowal brav'd your Friends and defy'd their Resentments in such a manner that gave them no Hope of succeeding with you tho' I always blam'd your disobliging way of doing it in regard to them as  your  Relations But just as you had brought them to expect you would not be prevail'd upon and they had so far acquiesced in your Choice that I had received and returned Visits from the Principals of your Family for you poorly to plead their  Menaces  is such a Jest as is not to be received without Contempt and Indignation  Well I can  guess  at your Motivestho' you are too meanspirited to  acknowledge  them and that they are too mean  to be  acknowledged Miss  Holles  can explain them all by the Help of a larger Fortune than I have I have heard of your Uncle's Proposal and your Visit thereGo on Sir and welcome I have Spirit enough to despise the Man that  could  deceive meBut could you not for your  own  sake act this perfidious Part in a more  manly  and more  worthy  manner Could you not find a  better  Reason than one you had always rejected when it was more your  Duty  to observe it But must you when your  Vows  to me had made it your  Duty  to  dispense  with it then shew your Levity in  adhering  to it Yet why do I expostulate with a Person so little  deserving  Expostulation You may think me angry because of my Disappointment 'Tis true  it is  a Disappointment and I had a better Opinion of you than this Conduct shews you deserved or Things should never have proceeded so far as they did But 'tis a Disappointment I hope tho' no Thanks to any Part of  your  Conduct but your  Meanness  I shall soon get over And tho' I wish you no Harm let us see if Seven Years hence you will be so many hundred Pounds the richer as makes the Difference to you between Miss  Holles  and Her you have treated so unworthily And if that will make you happier I truly wish you may be so For I am not your Enemy tho' you deserve not that I should style myself  Your Friend  LETTER CLXVII From a Gentleman to his Lady whose Overniceness in her House and uneasy Temper with her Servants make their Lives uncomfortable  My Dear  YOUR kind Concern for my Absence is very obliging 'Tis true I have already outstay'd my Intention by a Week and I find the Place I am in so very engaging and Mr  Terry  and his Sister so agreeable that but to come to  you  I could willingly stay a Month longer with  them  In short my Dear Mr  Terry  lives just as  I  would wish to live and his Sister who is his Housekeeper is just what I would wish  you  to be in many Particulars tho' no one in my Opinion can equal you in others  You must know then that Mr  Terry  and I are quite happy in one another and when he has no Visitors are indulg'd in a very pretty Parlour which neither Pail nor Mop is permitted to enter for two or three Days together And when we have Company the Diningroom is at our Service and the kind Lady lets us smoak there without remarking upon the beastly Fumes that we give the Furniture Not only so but if by a sudden Turn of the Pipe any one of us chances to bestrew the Floor with burnt Tobacco we are not broken in upon either by Maid or Broom And yet no Room can be cleaner than we find that when we return to it from a Walk in the Gardens  And indeed I must acquaint you that I never saw a Lady more prudently nice than Mrs  Terry  Her Person Furniture and House are even Patterns of Neatness and good Oeconomy I never anywhere saw the one or the other outdone Yet how can this be I marvelFor I have seen her pass over the Mark of a dirty Shoeheel upon a Floor as white as a Curd and never once rank the Aggressor among the worst of Slovens Nay more than that I have seen her Brother drop a few Crums of Bread and Butter under his Feet without so much as one corrective Frown Is not this strange my Dear Have Batchelors from a Sister more Privileges than a marry'd Man from his Wife  More than this it is true upon my Honour incredible as it may seem to you t'other Day he happen'd to spill a Glass of Claret upon a fine Damask Tablecloth and broke the Glass yet met with no other Reproof than an agreeable Laugh at his Aukwardness and  It was well it was he that did it who might do as he pleased with his own  Oh what a happy Man thought I is this good old Batchelor  But my Dear prepare for more strange Things still Yesterday at Dinner he was cutting up a good fat Goose and by an unfortunate Splash most grievously bespatter'd a rich Gown his Sister had on My Heart ached upon this for truly I thought for a Moment I was at home But good Mrs  Terry  convinced me of the contrary Oh Brother said she with a Smile what a Slip was thatBut Misfortunes will happenAnd out she pulled her Pocket Hankerchief to wipe her Gown I am sorry for it Sister said he It can't be help'd return'd she with a Smile but I had a good Mind to put you to some Expence for this This was all she said and she kept her Seat and eat her Dinner in perfect good Temper nay and  look'd  as easy and as pleasant as she spoke  I must still further observe that tho' all Things here are conducted with the greatest Decorum and every Servant in the House knows their Duty and does it distinguishingly well yet I have never heard one high or angry Word pass between Mrs  Terry  and the Maids Is not this surprising my Dear What can it be owing to I thought for my Share so much have I been used to a  contrary  Management that no Servant could do their Duty unless the Mistress of the Family put herself out of Humour with all the House Either she is more fortunate than you in lighting of good Servants or perhaps as Persecution makes Schismaticks in the Church so finding Faults creates them in a Family There may be something in this my Dear for I have seen your Maid  Jane  blunder out of  Fear  and blunder a second time to find she  had  blunder'd and a third because she was put quite out and could not help itThen how has my poor Deary been discomposed How have her charming Features been even distorted with Passion not a Bit of the Lily in her Face for the crimson Rose had swallowed it all up and an Eye darting Flames of Indignation and Woe mixed together And then breaking Silence Nobody ever had such Torments of Servants as I have Alas poor Deary How hard is thy HapHow much happier this good Family For secure of an Excuse rather than Blame if a small Fault should be committed in comes each Servant as their Duty requires all serene pleased chearful as their Mistress Their Eye is fixed upon her Eye with a becoming Confidence of pleasing and a Nod or a Beck does more with them than an hundred Words  How can I my Dear think of leaving such a delightful House and Family as thisYet I long  to see my beloved Spouse and I will set out on  Monday  next for that Purpose with as great Delight as ever I knew since I had the Happiness to call you mine But pray my dear Love let what I have said without the least Design to offend or concern you a little impress you however Let me have the Satisfaction for  both  our sakes of seeing you get over some of those Foibles that make us as effectually unhappy at times as if we had substantial Evils to encounter with In short my Dear let us think the House made for  our  Use and not we for  that  And let us shew our Servants that while we would have them  less faulty  than they are we will ourselves try to be  more perfect  than we have hitherto been and not while we condemn their Failings be guilty of much greater  Justice Prudence Ease Pleasure Interest Reputation all require this of us And could I hope what I have written will be attended to as I wish and mean it you cannot conceive the Delight that will double upon me on my Return to my Dearest for it is my Pride that I can style myself  Yours ever most affectionately  LETTER CLXVIII From a Gentleman who in a small Fortune experiences the Slights of his Friends but being suddenly reputed to be rich is oppressed with the fawning Caresses and Adulation of those who had before neglected him  Dear Sir  I MUST for once postpone every thing I would say to you in order to make room for an Account you little expect  What will you say when I tell you that a current Report of my being  immensely rich  is the greatest  Misfortune  I at present labour under Nor do I find it so supportable as you may be apt to imagine The Occasion was owing to the frequent Slights I had received from the Gentlewoman with whom I lodge and from others of my Friends who believing that I lived up to my scanty Fortune as in Truth I do tho' I take care to be beholden to nobody and pay ready Money for every thing could not treat me negligently enough I complain'd of this to that arch Wag  Tony Richards  who told me he would change every one's Behaviour to me in a few Days And he has done it effectually For what does he do but as a kind of Secret acquaints my Landlady that beside my poor little Estate which you know to be my All he had lately discovered that I had Twenty thousand Pounds Stock in one of our great Companies  Such was the Force of his whimsical Delusion that the very next Morning I had a clean Towel hung over my Waterbottle tho' I never before had more than one a Week during the Twenty Years I have lodged here  About a Week after this my Cousin  Tom  who for the two Years he has been in the  Temple  has let me see him but three times came in a most complaisant manner plainer dressed than ever I had before seen him and begg'd if the Length of the Evening was in any Degree burdensome I would permit him to wait upon me with such Pieces of Wit Humour or Entertainment as the Town afforded the reading of which under  my  Ear he was sure would be a great Advantage to  him  and assured me that for a Beginning he had presumed to bring the last new Tragedy in his Pocket I thank'd my young Spark Upon which  he is so much in earnest in his Observances that three Nights in a Week he thus entertains me Which will at least be of so much Service as to keep him out of more expensive Company And you cannot think what Pains the Rogue takes to read with the Cadence he knows I admire and sits till his Teeth chatter before he offers to look towards the Fire  What you will still more wonder at Sir  John Hookhim  called upon me before  Christmas  and tho' I have not had a Visit from him these Five Years was so obliging as to run away with me in his Chariot into  Hertfordshire  to keep the Holidays in his Family where his Lady treated me with the utmost Respect and her Daughters paid me their Morning Devoirs with the same Deference as if I had been their Grand Papa No Dinner was concluded upon without consulting my Palate and the young Gentlemen his Sons are as ambitious of my hearing their Exercises as if their Fortunes depended upon my Approbation  Sir  John  acquainted me with every Improvement he had made in his Estate and assured me that his second Son  Will  my Namesake has a Genius singularly turned for managing Country Business had he not had the Misfortune of having a Brother born before him and gave me several Reasons to believe that a fine Estate which lay in the Neighbourhood and was then to be sold would be a great Pennyworth I took the Hint but said I had no Inclination to purchase He shook his Head at my Thousands and told me that in his Opinion a Land Estate was preferable to the best Stock in the Kingdom  When I came to Town the th of  January  I was no sooner out of Sir  John  's Chariot but my Landlady in Person informed me that since I  had been absent I had so many Presents sent me that she had been in an hundred Fears for their spoiling I asked her the Particulars and found Five Turkeys Three Chines Three Hampers of  Madeira  for the Gout Two Collars of Brawn Geese Chickens Hares and Wildfowl to a large Amount  At Night I was welcom'd to Town by all my  old  Acquaintance and about Twenty almost new ones I was a little tired with my Journey and had a slight Cold besides which being observed one was running for a Physician another for a Surgeon to bleed me One thought an Emetick not improper Another recommended a gentle Sweat or composing Draught and amidst the general Officiousness I could hear it whisper'd that if my Will was not made Delays might prove dangerous And in the Morning five Messengers after my Welfare arrived before Day  Thus Sir you see my Peace is gone my Tongue is of no Use for no one believes me when I declare my real Circumstances And under the Happiness of a very small Fortune I suffer all the Afflictions attending a Man immoderately rich and if  you  keep not your usual Behaviour I shall not know myself nor any Man else since all my Companions are become Flatterers and all around me are so obsequious that it is impossible for me to know when I do right or wrong I am dear Sir tho' thus whimsically situated  Your real Friend  LETTER CLXIX From one Brother to another on the rash Marriage of a beloved Daughter of one of them to a profligate young Fellow  My dear Brother  I AM exceedingly concerned for the rash Step your Daughter  Thomasin  has made I know how it must affect you and I am myself not a little troubled at it But we see how unfit we are to chuse for ourselves And oh how often are we punished by the Enjoyment of our own WishesYou say you would rather have follow'd her Corpse to the Grave than that she should have thus thrown herself away on a Rake a Prodigal a Sot and a Fool as I as well as you know to be the Character of the Person she has chosen I would not afflict you my dear Brother instead of pouring Balm on the Wounds of your Mind But you will remember that it is scarce two Years ago when you were no less anxiously disturbed on Occasion of the violent Fever which then endangered her Life What Vows did you not put up for her Recovery What Tumults of Grief then agitated your afflicted Mind And how do you know that then she was only restor'd at your incessant and importunate Prayers but that otherwise God Almighty knowing what was best for you both would have taken her away from this heavy Evil This should teach us Resignation to the Divine Will and that we are most unfit to chuse for ourselves And even this Affliction heavy as it is may be sent in order to wean you from a Delight that you had too much set your Heart upon  Mean time you must not by too violent a Resentment and Reprobation of her which I find you are resolv'd upon add to the Miseries she has chosen The poor Creature will I fear too soon find her Punishment in her Choice and already I understand she is driven to great Distress You know she has strong Passions and your too great Severity may precipitate her on her everlasting Ruin when she becomes thoroughly sensible of the Condition she has brought herself to from as happy Prospects as any young Lady could promise herself  Let this prevail upon you to allow her Necessaries for oh 'tis a sad thing for meagre Want to stare in the Face a young Creature used to the fullest Plenty especially when 'tis aggravated by the Reflection that it is all owing to her own Rashness And as it may not suit with your Liking to appear yourself to allow her any thing at least till you see what Use will be made of your Favours I will undertake as from myself and on my own Head to furnish if you please what is immediately necessary and from time to time give you a faithful Account of the Disposition in which she receives it and how her wretched Deluder is affected by it  This is a Task I should not be fond of but to prevent worse Consequences and I must intreat you Brother to weigh seriously the Matter and as you  abound  let not the unhappy Wretch who after all is your Daughter want those  Necessaries of Life  which all your  Servants  have in such Plenty  I could not bear to be a Witness of the great Griefs which must tear asunder your Heart struggling between paternal Affection and just Indignation which makes me chuse to write to you  and shall wait your Resolution on this Subject I am dear Brother  Yours most affectionately  LETTER CLXX The afflicted Father in Answer to the preceding  Dear Brother  YOU are very kind in your Intention yet very affecting in your just Reproofs of my misplaced Fondness for a Creature so unworthy Resignation to the Divine Will a noble a needful Lesson is the Doctrine you raise from it God give it me as I ought to have it Time and His Grace I hope will effect it But at presentOh Brother you know not how I set my Heart on this Wretch That was my  Crime  you'll say And 'tis but just it should be my  Punishment  Do you as you please in what you propose I desire not the ingrateful Creature should want yet let her too be pinch'd Nothing else will make her sensible of her great OffenceBut don't let her be precipitated on any worse Fate if a worse can be possible as it  may  with regard to another Life Yet let not her Seducer be the better for the Assistance He shall never riot in my Substance Let me know what you have done three Months hence that I may retrench or add to what you shall advance as I shall see her Behaviour I say in three Months for another Reason because I may by that time I hope get more Strength of Mind and Patience than at present possesses the Heart of  Your everaffectionate Brother  LETTER CLXXI To a Father on the Loss of his Son who died under Age  My dear Friend  YOUR Lot I confess is hard exceeding hard to lose so promising and so hopeful a Child as that dear Boy was who so much engrossed the Affections of yourself and Spouse and a suitable Grief on so trying an Occasion ought to be indulged But yet not so as if you were bereft of  all  Comfort and insensible to those  other  great Mercies which God has bestowed upon you This my dear Friend would be a sinful Rejection of those Blessings which remain to you as if like  froward  Children you would have  nothing  because you could not have  every thing  you wish'd  Look upon all the great Families of the Earth upon all your Neighbours round you and see if they have not almost every one shed Tears on this very Occasion and then judge of the Unreasonableness of  too great  a Grief and what Pretension you have to be exempted from those Accidents to which  Royalty  itself is liable I will not to alleviate your Grief remind you of a Topick which is however no less important than too frequently the Case that he  might not always  have been so hopeful but might as he  grew up  many ways have administered Bitterness to you But I think it surpasses all other Comforts even those you hoped for from him that he is taken away at an Age at which God's Mercy renders his eternal Happiness unquestionably certain and you and your mourning Spouse have the Pleasure to reflect that ye have been the happy Means of adding  one  to the Number of the Blest above and that he is gone before you but a little while to that Place where  all Tears shall be wiped away and whither thro' the same infinite Mercy you will in time follow him and enjoy him for ever  You have this Comfort that he dy'd a  natural  Death that the Work was God Almighty's who  gave  him to you and has but  taken  back what he  lent  you That you saw every thing done for his Recovery that  could  be done and that it pleased God  not  to grant him to your Prayers and why should you repine at the  Dispensation  when you know the  Dispenser  Let it therefore be your Duty on this trying Occasion to shew an intire Acquiescence to the Divine Will such an Acquiescence as may be exemplary to your good Spouse whose  weaker  Sex and Mind want all the Consolation your  stronger  Reason can give her And at the same time it behoves you to shew a thankful Spirit for the Mercies  yet continued  to you Mercies that Thousands have not to rejoice in lest God Almighty should as a Punishment deprive you of those you have still left  I beg you will take in good Part these few Lines which my Affection for you has drawn from my Pen and that you'll believe me to be dear Sir  Your truly sympathizing Friend and humble Servant  LETTER CLXXII To a Father on the Loss of a hopeful Son who died at Man's Estate  SIR  I AM truly sorry for your Loss So hopeful a Son just arrived at Man's Estate and who was so great a Comfort and Assistance to you to be  snatched away is what must administer to you the greatest Grief of any thing that could possibly befal you  But alas yours is no  new  Case The greatest Families have been thus afflicted and with the Aggravation to some of them that perhaps they have been deprived of their  Heirs  and have not a  Son left  to continue their Name and Honours The late Queen  Anne  when Princess of  Denmark  lost her beloved Duke of  Gloucester  not only  her  Hopes but the Hopes of the  Nation  and the Crown to which he seem'd not only  born  but  fashioned  was obliged to be settled on that Occasion upon a distant Branch of the Royal Line  The great Duke of MARLBOROUGH who by his Merit and his Victories had raised a princely Estate as well as Titles had but one Son the Marquis of  Blandford  on whom he and his Duchess built all their Hopes for the perpetuating of those new Honours in their Family and he was snatched away by Death when he was at the University training up to become the Dignities to which he was intitled  Still more recent was the unhappy Fate of a Lady of the first Quality in  England  Her Lord had a Son lent to his advanced Years This Son was the last of that noble Family and on his Life depended all his Father's and his Mother's Hopes and on his living till of Age a valuable Part of the Estate itself which otherwise was to fall to an illegitimate Offspring What Care was not used to preserve the noble Youth An eminent Physician was taken into the Family to be made a constant Watchman as it were over his Health and Exercises The young Nobleman himself was hopeful dutiful and as distinguished in the Graces of his Mind as by his Birth He travelled his indulgent Mother travelled with him He made a Campaign  under his Uncle the greatest General then surviving in an Age of Generals He again travelled to restore and confirm his Health and all the noble Mother's Hopes and Views were employ'd on the finding for her beloved Son on his Return a Wife suitable to his Quality and who might be a Means to preserve one of the first Families in the Kingdom from utter Extinction  What was the Event of all her Cares her Hopes her Vows her ProspectsWhy just as the young Nobleman had within a few Months arrived at Age and could have made those Family Settlements which were most desirable should be made and the Want of which involved his noble Mother in perplexing Lawsuits which too turn'd against her it pleased God to deprive her of him and he died in a foreign Land far distant from his fond Mother who still more grievous if true for Reasons of State as was said had been deny'd to accompany and attend him and so ended all her Hopes of above twenty Years standing and in him his Family likewise  A still more recent Calamity to a great Family I might mention in the Death of two hopeful Children the only Sons of their Father and the only Heirs Male of one of the first Families in the Kingdom both snatch'd away in the Space of a few Hours of one another from healthy Constitutions and no Ailments previous to the sudden one that carry'd them off which was only believed to be a sore Throat In vain were the Consultations of the most eminent Physicians and Surgeons who gave Attendance all Night minutely to watch every Change of the Distemper in vain prov'd the Assurance of the Skilful to the fond Parents that there was no Danger Death mocked all their Hopes and when the first dy'd in vain was he opened in order to find out if possible the  Cause of the fatal Malady in order to administer with greater Hopes of Success Remedies against it to preserve the other That other hopeful Youth followed his Brother and their Fate deeply wounded the Hearts of half a dozen noble Families whose intimate Relationship gave them a very near Interest in the awful Event  Like Instances of the Loss of hopeful Sons and of the only Male Heirs might be produced in other Families of prime Distinction in the List of the  British  Nobility but I need not enumerate more to a Mind considerate as yours which will reflect that Death is a common Lot from which no Rank or Degree is exempted And I hope these Reflections and such as you will be able to add to them by your own Reason and Piety will serve to rebuke the Overflowings of your Grief and confine it to the natural Channels into which both God and Nature will  indulge  it to flow  I mention not to your enlighten'd Mind you see the Motives that nevertheless might be insisted on with great Propriety on so grievous an Occasion such as The Uncertainty of Life The Gratitude you ought to shew for having had your Son  so long  continu'd to you as he was The great Probability of his being happy in God's Mercies by reason of his Hopefulness and Duty The  early  Release he has met with from the Troubles and Chances of a changeable and transitory Life His Escape from the Danger of the Temptations which his Virtue might have been tried with had he lived to  maturer  Years That this your Deprivation is God's Work That he dy'd not in a distant Land and by an untimely Death But that you had the Satisfaction of knowing that every thing was done for him that could be done That his Morals were still untainted and he was not cut off in the Pursuit of some capital Sin as has too  often been the Case with bold and daring Spirits in the Heat of their youthful Passions And that he escap'd the Snares usually laid for young Men by idle Companions and vicious Women which too often entangle and catch the unthinking Mind These will be all suggested to you from your own better Reason and to that  secondarily  as to a due Resignation to the Divine Will  primarily  let me reser you on this trying Occasion Who am with a sympathizing Affection dear Sir  Your sincere Friend and humble Servant  LETTER CLXXIII To a  With small Variations the same Arguments may be used to a Husband on the Death of his Wife and on other melancholy Occasions of the like Nature  Widow on the Death of her Husband  Good Madam  ALLOW me the Liberty of condoling with you on the truly great and heavy Loss you have sustain'd of an excellent Husband All we who had the Pleasure of his Friendship mourn with you the irretrievable Misfortune to  us  as well as to  you  But as there is no recalling it and as it is God's doing we must not repine at the Dispensation but acquiesce in it And yet to say that neither you nor we ought to grieve for it would be absurd and unnatural Sinful Grief however we are commanded to shun And we ought to bless God that he was graciously pleased to continue him with us  so long  instead of mourning too heavily that we had not  longer  the Pleasure of his agreeable Conversation We were not  born  together and some of us  must  have  gone first  and I have sometimes  been ready to think besides the Life of Glory that thro' God's Mercies awaits the Good that he is far happier than those he leaves behind him in this Point That he is saved from the Regret which fills the wounded Hearts of his surviving Friends of seeing them go  before him  as they have seen him go  before them  Had he not dy'd now a few Years would have determin'd his useful Life for the longest Life is but a Span and  then  the Matter had he gone before us would have been as it is  now  We may make our own Lives miserable in bewailing  his Loss  but we cannot do  him  good nor were  he  to  know  it  Pleasure  You in particular Madam who are now called upon to be both  Father  and  Mother  to the dear Pledges of your mutual Affection ought to take double Care how you suffer immoderate Grief to incapacitate you from this new and more arduous and necessary Task For by this means you would not only do yourself Hurt but double the Loss which his dear Children have already sustain'd in that of their Father And would you Madam make them  motherless  as well as  fatherless  God forbid Consider tho' this is a  heavy  Case yet it is a  common  Case And we must not repine that God Almighty thought him  ripe  for Heaven and put an End to his  probatory  State  With melancholy Pleasure have I often on the Loss of Friends contemplated the excellent Advice of the Son of  Sirach  who tells us how we ought to  mourn  on these Occasions and how we ought to govern our Mourning and reminds us most excellently that while we are grieving for our departed Friends  our own Lives  pass away and we  are not  You'll permit me to transcribe his own excellent Words as most suitable to the Subject before us  "My Son says he let Tears fall down over the Dead and begin to lament and then cover his Body according to the Custom and neglect not his Burial Weep bitterly and make great Moan and use Lamentation as he is  worthy  and then comfort thyself for thy Heaviness for of Heaviness cometh  Death  and the Heaviness of the  Heart  breaketh  Strength  In Affliction also Sorrow remaineth and the Life of the Poor or Miserable or of those who make themselves so by Mourning is the  Curse of the Heart  Take therefore no Heaviness to Heart Drive it away and remember  thy own  last End Forget it not for there is  no turning again  Thou shalt not do  him  Good but hurt  thyself  Remember MY Judgment saith the wise Man speaking as if in the Person of our late dear Friend for THINE also shall be so Yesterday for ME and Today for THEE When the Dead is at Rest let his  Remembrance  rest and be  comforted  for him when his Spirit is departed from him"  To add any thing to this excellent Advice would be in some measure to depreciate it I will therefore conclude with my Prayers that God will enable you to bear as you  ought  and as all your Friends  wish  and  expect  from you this truly heavy Dispensation and that most particularly for the sake of your dear Children by him and with assureing you of my Service to the utmost of my Ability For I am Madam as well for  theirs  and  your own  sake as for his  Memory  's sake  Your faithful Friend and humble Servant  FINIS
