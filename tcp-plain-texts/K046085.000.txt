ACT I SCENE I  The Stage darkenedrepresents a cloudy sky a very rocky coast and a ship on a tempestuous sea  ARIEL  comes upon the stage  AIR  _ARISE arise ye subterranean winds  Arise ye deadly blighting fiends  Rise you from whom devouring plagues have birth  You that i' th' vast and hollow womb of earth  Engender earthquakes make whole countries shake  Ye eager winds whose rapid force can make  All but the fix'd and solid centre shake  Come drive you ship to that part of the isle  Where nature never yet did smile  Myself will fly on board and on the beak  In the waste the deck in every cabin  I'll flame amazement Sometimes I'll divide  And burn in many places On the topmast  The yards and bowsprit will I flame distinctly  Then meet and join  Jove  's lightnings the precursors  Of dreadful thunderclaps more momentary  And sight outrunning are the the fire and cracks  Of sulph'rous roaring the most mighty  Neptune  Shall seem to siege make his bold waves tremble  Yea his dread trident shake    Exit  Repeated flashes of lightning and claps of thunder  SCENE II  A part of the island near  PROSPERO  's cell  Enter  PROSPERO  and  MIRANDA  MIRANDA  If by your art my dearest father you have  Put the wild waters in this roar allay them  O I have suffer'd with those I saw suffer  Had I been any god of pow'r I would  Have sunk the sea within the earth or e'er  It should the goodly ship have swallow'd and  The freighting souls within her  AIR  Hark how the winds rush from their caves  Hark how old ocean frets and raves  From their deep roots the rocks he tears  Whole deluges lets fly  That dash against the sky  And seem to drown the stars  PROSPERO  Tell your piteous heart there's no harm done  I have done nothing but in care of thee  My child who art ignorant of what thou art  But I will now inform theepray attend  'Tis twelve years since thy father was the duke  Of  Milan  be not amaz'd my daughter  Thou art a princess of no less issue  MIRANDA  O the heav'ns what foul play had we  PROSPERO  Mark me well  I then neglecting worldly ends all dedicated  To study and the bettering of my mind  Did cast the government on my brother  Call'd  Anthonio  He from substitution  And executing the outward face of  Royalty with all prerogative did  Believe he was indeed the duke hence his  Ambition growing he confederates  With the king of  Naples  my inveterate foe  Who for homage and certain tribute agrees  To extirpate me from my dukedom and  To confer fair  Milan  on my brother  This settled and an army levy'd one night  Fated to the purpose did  Anthonio  open  The gates of  Milan  and i' th' dead of darkness  The ministers for the purpose hurry'd thence  Me and thy crying self in fine they forc'd us  Out to sea in a rotten unrigg'd boat  Where they left us to the mercy of the winds  AIR  In pity  Neptune  smooths the liquid way  Obsequious  Tritons  on the surface play  And sportful dolphins with a nimble glance  To the bright sun their glitt'ring scales advance  In oczy bed profound the billows sleep  No clamorous winds awake the silent deep  With safety thro' the sea our boat is bore  In gentle gales we 're wafted to the shore  Here in this island we arriv'd and here  Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit  Than other princes can who have more time  For vainer hours and tutors not so careful  MIRANDA  Heav'n thank you for't  PROSPERO  Know further that fortune  Now grown bountiful to this shore hath brought  Mine enemies and by my prescience  I find my zenith doth depend upon  A most propitious star whose influence  If now I court not but omit my fortunes  Will ever after drop  Thou art inclin'd to sleep 'tis a good dulness  And give it way I know thou can'st not chuse  AIR  MIRANDA  Come O sleep my eyelids close  Lull my soul to soft repose  PROSPERO  Approach my  Ariel  SCENE III  Enter  ARIEL  ARIEL  All hail great master grave sir hail I come  To answer thy best pleasure be't to fly  To swim to dive into the fire to ride  On curled clouds to thy strong bidding task  Ariel  and all his qualities  AIR  In the bright moonshine while winds whistle loud  Tivy tivy tivy we mount and we fly  All racking along in a downy white cloud  And lest our leap from the sky should prove too far  We slide on the back of a newfalling star  Merry merry merry we sail from the east  Half tippled at a rainbow feast  PROSPERO  Spirit thou hast perform'd to point  The tempest that I bade thee and dispos'd  The ship and princes exactly to thy charge  But there's more work what is the time o' th' day  ARIEL  Past the midseason  AIR  PROSPERO  We must work we must haste  Noontide hour is long since past  Sprights that glimmer in the sun  Into shades already run  Naples  will be here anon  ARIEL  Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd  PROSPERO  What is't thou can'st demand  ARIEL  My liberty  PROSPERO  Before the time be out No more  Do'st thou forget  The foul witch  Sycorax  the dam of  Caliban  Whom I now keep in service  ARIEL  No  PROSPERO  Thou do'st and think'st it much to tread the ooze  Of the salt deep  To run against the sharp wind of the north  To do my business in the veins of the earth  When it is bak'd with frost  ARIEL  I do not sir  PROSPERO  Thou best know'st what torment I found thee in  It was my art when I arriv'd and heard thee  That made the pine within whose rift thou wast  Imprisoned to gape and let thee out  And if thou murmurest I will rend an oak  And peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou  Hast howl'd out twelve long winters  ARIEL  Pardon master  PROSPERO  Go make thyself like a nymph of the sea  Be subject to no mortal sight but mine  Hark thee in thine ear  ARIEL  My lord it shall be done    Exit  PROSPERO  Awake dear heart awake Thou hast slept well  Awake  MIRANDA  The strangeness of your story put  Heaviness in me    Exeunt  SCENE IV  Enter  FERDINAND  and  ARIEL  invisible  AIR  ARIEL  Come unto the yellow sands  And then take hands  Curt'sy'd when you have and kiss'd  The wild waves whist  Foot it featly here and there  And sweet spirits the burthen bear  FERDINAND  Where should this music be i' th' air or earth  It sounds no more and sure it waits upon  Some god of this island Sitting on a bank  Weeping against the king my father's wreck  This music hover'd on the waters  Allaying both their fury and my passion  With chearing airs thence I follow'd it  Or it has drawn me rather but 'tis gone  No it begins again  AIR  ARIEL  Full fathom five thy father lies  Of his bones are coral made  Those are pearls that were his eyes  Nothing of him that doth fade  But doth suffer a seachange  Into something rich and strange  Seanymphs hourly ring his knell  Hark now I hear them ding dong bell  FERDINAND  This is no mortal business nor no sound  That the earth owns I hear it now above me  It must mean good or ill and here I am  ARIEL  Here I am  FERDINAND  Hah art thou so The spirit's turn'd an echo  ARIEL  An echo  FERDINAND  This might seem pleasant could the burthen of  My griefs accord with any thing but sighs  ARIEL  Sighs  FERDINAND  And my last words like those of dying men  Need no reply Fain I would go to shades  Where few would wish to follow me  ARIEL  Follow me  FERDINAND  I will discourse no more with thee  Nor follow one step further  ARIEL  One step further  FERDINAND  This must have more importance than an echo  ARIEL  An echo  FERDINAND  I'll try if it will answer when I sing  My sorrows to the murmur of this brook  ARIEL  This brook  DUETT  FERDINAND  Go thy way  ARIEL  Go thy way  FERDINAND  Why should'st thou stay  ARIEL  Why should'st thou stay  FERDINAND  Where the winds whistle and where the streams creep  Under yon willowtree fain would I sleep  Then let me alone  For 'tis time to be gone  ARIEL  For 'tis time to be gone  There's yet in store for thee  Some strange felicity  Follow me follow me  And thou shalt see  Exeunt  SCENE V  Changes to the wild part of the island  Enter  STEPHANO VENTOSO  and  MUSTACHO  VENTOSO  This will be a doleful day with  Suky  She gave me a gilt nutmeg at parting  That's lost too O she's a most charming wench  MUSTACHO  Beshrew thy heart for thus reminding me  Of my wife I should ne'er have thought of her  But nature will shew itself I must melt  STEPHANO  Look look poor  Mustacho  weeps for grief  VENTOSO  In truth he sheds the brandy from his eyes  STEPHANO  Hang wives and mistresses let's drink about  AIR  Here's to thee Tom this whining love despise  Pledge me my friend and drink till thou art wife  It sparkles brighter far than she  'Tis pure and right without deceit  And such no woman e'er will be  No they are all sophisticate  Follies they have so numberless in store  That only he who loves them can have more  Neither their sighs nor tears are true  Those idly blow these idly fall  Nothing like to ours at all  But sighs and tears have sexes too  Courage my lads this island is our own  The king the prince and all their train are drown'd  VENTOSO  Then my good friends let's form a government  STEPHANO  I was the master at sea and will be  Duke at land you  Mustacho  was my mate  And now I'm prince shalt be my viceroy  MUSTACHO  Stephano  let me speak for the people  Because they are but few or rather none  Within this island to speak for themselves  Know that to prevent the shedding Christian blood  We're content  Ventoso  shall be viceroy  Provided I be viceroy over him  Good people say are ye all satisfy'd  What none answerTheir silence gives consent  SCENE VI  Enter  TRINCALO

against me  In my absence but I oppose it all  MUSTACHO  Art thou mad  Trincalo  will you disturb  A settled government where you don't know  The laws of the country  TRINCALO  I'll have no laws  MUSTACHO  Then civil war begins  DUETT  TRINCALO  Whilst blood does flow within these veins  Or any spark of life remains  My right I will maintain  MUSTACHO  Whilst I this temper'd steel can weild

Inspir'd with this let's dance and play  striking the bottle  Enjoy at least the present day  And leave to fate the rest  ACT II SCENE I  Another part of the island  FERDINAND  discovered  Enter  PROSPERO MIRANDA  and  ARIEL  PROSPERO  THE fringed curtains of thine eyes advance  And see what is yonder  MIRANDA  Is't a spirit  Believe me Sir it carries a brave form  But 'tis a spirit  PROSPERO  No it eats and sleeps  And hath such senses as we were he not  Somewhat stain'd with grief beauties worst canker  Thou might'st then call him a goodly person  MIRANDA  I might call him a thing divine  Nothing natural I ever saw so noble  AIR  FERDINAND  What sudden blaze of majesty  What awful innocence of mein  Is that which I from hence descry  Like nature's universal queen  Sure the goddess on whom these airs attend  Such beauty cannot belong to human kind  MIRANDA  I am like you a mortal if such you are  FERDINAND  My language too Oh heav'ns I am the best  Of them who speak this language were I but  In my own country O if a virgin  And your affections not gone forth I'll make you  Queen of Naples  PROSPERO  sings  In tender sighs he silence breaks  The fair his flame approves  Consenting blushes warm her cheeks  She smiles she yields she loves  Young Sir a word thou dost here usurp  The name thou ow'st not and hast put thyself  Upon this island as a spy to win it  From me

Seawater shalt thou drink thy food shall be  The freshbrook muscles wither'd roots and husks  Wherein the acorn's cradledFollow  FERDINAND  No  I will resist such entertainment till  Mine enemy has more pow'r    He draws and is charm'd from moving  MIRANDA  O dear father  Make not too rash a trial of him for  He's gentle and not fearful  AIR  Sweetness truth and ev'ry grace  Which time and use are wont to teach  The eye may in a moment reach  And read distinctly in his face  FERDINAND  My spirits as in a dream are all bound up  My father's loss the weakness which I feel  The wreck of all my friends and this man's threats  To whom I am subdu'd are but light to me  Might I but thro' my prison once a day  Behold this maid all corners else o' th' earth  Let liberty make use ofspace enough  Have I in such a prison  PROSPERO  Hang not on my garment  MIRANDA  Have pity sir  PROSPERO  Speak not for him Follow me sir  This door shews you to your lodgings    Exeunt  SCENE II  A wild part of

Another's rightthen lost we  Ferdinand  Then brought we these sore afflictions on us  SCENE III    A banquet rises  ARIEL  sings behind the scenes  AIR  Dry those eyes which are o'erflowing  All your

place  While thus we compass in  These mortals and their sin  Your vile lives you shall discover  Truly all your deeds declare  For about you spirits hover  That can tell you what they are  Spirits

AIR  Upon their broken peace of mind  Despair black son of guilt now feeds  Whilst thou brave youth in love shalt find  The full reward of virtuous deeds  No gloss our guilt can e'er remove  It taints the happiest day  But all the pangs of virtuous love  Shall virtuous love o'er pay  Exit  SCENE V  Before  PROSPERO  's cell  Enter  FERDINAND  To be a prisoner where I love  Is but a double tie a link of fortune  Join'd to the chain of love but not to see her  And yet to be so near her there's the hardship  But her fair form lives always in my mind  AIR  To what my eyes admir'd before  I add a thousand graces more  And fancy blows into a flame  The spark that from her beauty came  The object thus improv'd by thought  By my own image I am caught  Pygmalion  so with fatal art  Polish'd the form that stung his heart  SCENE VI  Enter  MIRANDAPROSPERO  at a distance unseen  MIRANDA  Sir my lord where are you  FERDINAND  Is it your voice my love or do I dream  MIRANDA  Speak softly it is I

project gather to a head  And little further use have I for charms  Ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves  And ye that on the sands with printless foot  Do chase the ebbing  Neptune  and do fly him  When he comes back you demypuppets that  By moonshine do the greensour ringlets make  Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime  Is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice  To hear the solemn curfew by whose aid  Weak masters tho' ye be I have bedimm'd  The noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds  And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault  Set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder  Have I given fire and rifted  Jove  's stout oak  With his own boltthe strongbas'd promontory  Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up  The pine and cedar graves at my command  Have wak'd their sleepers op'd and let them forth  By my so potent art But this rough magic  I here abjure  AIR  Let magick sounds affright no more  While horrors shake the main  Nor spellbred storms
