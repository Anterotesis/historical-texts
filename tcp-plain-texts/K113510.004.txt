PENNANTS OUTLINE OF THE GLOBE VOL IV  MALAYAN ISLES  THOSE who consult the map of this portion of the globe will instantly perceive the effect of the rapid discharge of the waters after the destruction of the old world by the deluge aided by volcanic fury Volcanoes or vestiges of volcanoes are to be seen in most parts to this day amazing caverns mountains piled upon mountains with all the testimonies of the mighty confusion we know not the antecedent form but it was evidently shattered by that great event From the top of the bay of  Bengal  to the very pole it swept every thing before it and left a vast expanse of ocean uninterrupted by any land except the diminutive spots of  Kerguelin  islands or the lesser speck of  Amsterdam  and  St Paulo  FROM Cape  Negrais  the southern point of  Pegu  the waters seem to have been impelled towards the vast  Pacific Ocean  The isles of  Andaman  and  Nicobar  first shew that tendency in a slight degree all the peninsula of  Malacca  was affected in a higher The island of  Sumatra  follows the curvature of that part of the continent At  Java  it begins to shew the sury of the  attracted course of the waters towards the east  Java Cumbava Timor  the  Molucca  islands and  New Guinea  were formed by their influence At  New Guinea  the torrent took a southerly direction and rent into fragments all that part of the primitive world even to the remotest of the  Society  islands which like the train of a comet shew the innumerable remnants of land most evident witnesses of its course The amazing island of  New Holland  resisted the force and continues more worthy of the name of a continent  New Zealand  remains divided from all the rest to the east is sea as far as  America  and remote as the pole itself on the south The north part of the vast  Pacific  is contracted by the approximation of  Asia  and  America  The crescent of islands from  Alaschka  to  Kamtschatka  mark the antient union of the present continents The flood formed from the south of  Kamtschatka  the  Kuril  isles  Matmay  and  Japan Liqueo  and  Formosa  the  Philippine  islands the great  Borneo  and all the groups scattered over the ocean to the northeast such as the  Pelew  the  Ladrones  and the  Carolinas  and the range named after Lord  Mulgrave  Such is the hypothetical view of this face of the globe  Sumatra  SUMATRA  the first island which strikes our eye bounds the west side of the streights of  Malacca  The equator crosses it in the middle and divides it into almost two equal parts  Acheen  head lies in Lat ° ′ north and  Hogs  point in ° ′ south The length is about eight hundred miles and the greatest breadth a hundred and thirty All the western side is very low and intersected with swamps insulating certain patches slightly elevated A range of mountains runs through the whole island much nearer to the western than the eastern coast In some  places they are double and treble with beautiful vallies between each chain but excepting where cleared both valley and mountain are clothed with shady forests These chains approximate to the coast on the whole of the western side At their foot is low and often swampy land  SOME of the mountains are of a vast height  Ophir  MOUNT OPHIR  situated immediately under the line is feet high or two miles one thousand and ninetyfour yards No snow is ever seen on it yet the inhabitants of all the chains are like those of other alpine regions subject to monstrous wens or  goitres  this malady owes its origin to the water or the thick cold and foggy vapors which universally arise from the vallies These people are not infested with any particular disease the result of the tumors they enjoy the same health as others  BAD CLIMATE  but the climate of  Sumatra  near to the sea or amidst the swamps is dreadful "Near  Indrapour  " says  Lind  Essay on Diseases p    is a place where no  European  can venture to sleep one night on shore during the rainy season without running the hazard of his life or at least of a dangerous fit of sickness and at  Podang  a  Dutch  settlement on the same island the air has been found so bad that it is commonly called the  Plague Coast  Here a thick pestilential vapor or fog arises after the rains from the marshes which destroys all the white inhabitants  IN all these chains are numbers of volcanoes  VOLCANOES  which are called by the  Malayes Goonong Appee  they generally smoke but seldom emit flames or  lava  Marsden  's  Sumatra  p  I believe no accurate observations have been yet made on their nature being at a considerable  distance inland and the approach impeded by deep and almost impenetrable forests Sulphur may be collected in any quantity about their sides  THE island abounds with minerals  MINERALS  It has been long famous for its gold  GOLD  some is dug out of the earth but by reason of the unwholesomeness of the climate no  Europeans  dare attempt to work and the natives are too lazy to go to any depth The greatest part is taken out of the rivers and washed from the sand and gravel The amount brought annually to the western parts of  Sumatra  does not exceed ten thousand ounces  Menangacabow  a central and principal kingdom has the greatest quantity the richest mines lying within its territory The  Malayes  are most skilful artists in works of fillagree in both gold and silver Mr  Marsden  Sumatra  p  gives an ample account of the manufacture which with the coarsest of instruments is carried on to the most amazing degree of elegance and perfection On mention of that gentleman let me own my obligation to his admirable history of  Sumatra  for most of the articles on the subject of that island  I FIND no mention of any silver being found here  COPPER  but it produces abundance of copper of the richest kind  TIN is met with in vast plenty  TIN  chiefly near  Palambang  on the east coast and on the isle of  Banka  it is a considerable article of trade and smelted into small pieces is exported in great quantities to  China  IRON is found in  Menangacabow  IRON  where it is fused for use  COAL is a production of  Sumatra  COAL  Naptha  or earth oil is  another and is principally used to resist the ravages of the  termes  or white ants  SALTPETRE is procured in abundance out of the vast caverns with which the island is hollowed and is extracted out of the dung of the swallows called  Layang Layang  which build by thousands in the roofs These seem to be the kind which make the esculent nests The dung extends often twenty feet in breadth and is from four to six feet in depth  Napal  or the Steatites earth forms the basis of the cliffs and often the beds of the rivers  I SHALL now pursue the other parts of the natural history begin with the zoology and treat of it on the authority of Mr  Marsden  flinging it into a systematic form  THE Horses are small and hardy  HORSES COWS SHEEP  the cows and sheep are also small the last supposed to be of the  Bengal  breed  THE  buffalo  BUFFALO  or  carbow  the most useful animal of the island is the beast of draught and supplies the inhabitants with milk and butter There are none at present in a state of nature  DOMESTIC  goats  are common and are called  Cambing  GOATS  As to the  Cambing Ootan  or goat of the woods of Mr  Marsden  his description is not sufficient for me to ascertain the  species  "One" says he  Sumatra  p    which I saw was three feet in height and four feet in the length of the body It had something of the  gazelle  in its appearance and excepting the horns which were about six inches long and turned back with an arch it did not much resemble the common goat The hinder parts were shaped like those of a bear the rump sloping round off  from the back The tail was very small and ended in a point The legs clumsy The hair along the ridge of the back rising coarse and strong almost like bristles No beard Over the shoulder was a large spreading tuft of greyish hair the rest of the hair black throughout The  Scrotum  globular Its disposition seemed wild and fierce and it is said by the natives to be remarkably swift  THE  deer  seem to be the different sort of  axis  DEER  Hist Quad i p Mr  Marsden  names it the  Hogdeer  N  o  but certainly not the  Babyrossa  as he supposes it which we shall hereafter shew to be a hog  THE  wild boar  is frequent  WILD BOAR  the domestic is of the kind we call the  Chinese  THE  onehorned Rhinoceros  is common  RHINOCEROS  Mr  Charles Miller  informed me by a friend that the  twohorned  N  o  is sometimes seen here  THE forests abound with  elephants  ELEPHANTS  few are applied to use about ten are kept for state by the king of  Acheen  and that faithful traveller Mr  Forrest  Voy p  adds that the inhabitants of the capital make use of them as horses in their journies into the country Much of the ivory is sent to  China  and to  Europe  The wild elephants collect in great herds and are very destructive in the plantations The natives contrive to poison them by inserting a fatal drug into the sugarcanes split for that purpose  OF the digitated quadrupeds are found variety of  apes  APES  the  Gibbon  or longarmed N  o  in vast multitudes generally perched by hundreds on the tops of trees and very seldom descending  The  Ourang Outang  is said to be found in  Sumatra  which is probable as it is met with in the adjacent islands The  pigtailed Baboon  N  o  is an inhabitant of this country  AMONG the  Battas  are numbers of small black dogs  DOGS  with erect ears which are fattened for food Wild dogs inhabit all parts of the island  Tigers  are numerous and very destructive  TIGERS  they annually kill in the pepper country a hundred people there are even instances of their depopulating whole villages yet the natives will not destroy them for they hold the doctrine of transmigration and fear that in the tiger they may hurt the soul of an ancestor  HERE are two or three species of lesser kind called tiger cats  THE  Bear  N  o  is small and black  BEARS  and devours the heart or pith of the cocopalms  Otters  and  civets  finish the list given us of the rapacious animals of this island  OTTER  Mr  Marsden  mentions an animal called a Stinkard I suppose one of the  mephitic  weesels  THE crested  Porcupine  N  o  and I think the  longtailed  PORCUPINE  N  o  are found in this country  Squirrels  Marsden  's  Sumatra  p  small and of a dark color  SQUIRREL  inhabit the woods  Mr  Marsden  mentions a  Sloth  the  twotoed  N  o    SLOTH  and the  Armadillo  he names it the  Tanqueeling  which is the shorttailed  Manis  N  o  As to the  Armadillo  the whole tribe is confined to  South America  THE vast  Bats  N  o  or N  o  swarm here  BATS  as they do in all the islands They fly from island to island and in their  passage are often seen dipping into the sea probably to snatch up the smaller fishes  IT is very difficult to ascertain the birds  RDS  I can readily suppose them to be the same with those of  India  or the neighboring islands I shall mention only two one the scarce species the  Argus Pheasant  spoken of before among the  Chinese  birds  Outlines of the Globe vol iii p  I here add that it is very common in the woods of  Sumatra  c  THE other bird is the  Cassowary Latham  iii p tab This curious genus is related to the Ostrich but is most local being confined to the torrid zone and only to that part which includes this island  Java Banda  and a few others of this great  Archipelago  It runs fast is very fierce when in the wild state grunts like a hog and will kick violently like the Ostrich Its food is vegetables but will swallow iron stones or any thing that is offered  I SHALL take notice of only one insect  INSECTS  which is the common bee the  Apis Mellifica  which in these hot countries is left to itself unhived Vast quantities of the wax is exported to  China Bengal  and other parts of  India  as to the honey it is far inferior to the  European  kind  I MAY mention that among the lizards is the  Crocodile  CROCODILE  which makes dreadful havock among the bathers who cannot be persuaded from the performance of that rite notwithstanding the danger besides they look upon these terrible reptiles with a degree of respect probably for the same reason as they do the tiger  Sumatra  still wants its florist I must content myself with  giving a list of such of the vegetable kingdom as contribute to commercial purposes or to the general use of the natives  Pepper  is the great staple of the island  PEPPER  It was for the sake of that spice that we defied the wretched climate Mr  Marsden  Sumatra p  gives a long and curious account of its cultivation he also informs us that the white is only black stripped of the outer coat  THE  Piper Betel  is cultivated greatly  BETEL  and sent to the coast of  Coromandel  and to  Telinga  for the purpose of chewing wrapped round the  Areca  as we have already mentioned  Outlines of the Globe vol i p    THE  Arundo Bambos  is very common  BAMBOO  and not only furnishes materials for building the houses but as I imagine produces the quantities of canes that are exported from the western side of the island  THE  Calamus Rotang Rumphius  ROTANG  vol v p tab and numbers of the following pages and plates furnishes annually great cargoes chiefly from the eastern side of the island which the  Dutch  send to  Europe  and the country traders to the western parts of  India  The specific name  Rotang  signifies in the  Malayan  language a  staff  or  walking stick  the common thick canes which serve for this purpose and the small limber canes imported from  India  are all varieties of the  Calamus Rotang  The former is  Palmi juncus Calapparius Var  A  Linn  and is accurately described by  Rumphius Amb  vol v p The texture of its wood its leaves and flowering stems bear a striking resemblance to some species of palm Hence  Rumphius  has not unaptly named it  Palmi juncus  or  Palm rush  Its natural situation is in  woody mountanous tracts there it pervades the highest trees and interlacing its branches from bough to bough forms by its innumerable ramifications and spinous stems an impenetrable thicket  IN order to fit this cane for the purpose of a walking stick a single interstice of sufficient length between two joints is made choice of this is loaded with a weight or bound tight to a board for the space of a month and also exposed to smoak to diminish somewhat of its natural pliability  Rumphius  observes  Herb Amb  vol p that no author he had seen described this cane which he imputes to its growing only in the remote parts of  India  and sequestered mountains rarely visited by  Europeans  till they acquired sovereign power over some of the regions  Laurus Casia  Outlines of the Globe vol i p    CASIA  or bastard cinnamon grows in abundance in the interior parts of the north of the island it is sometimes fifty and sixty feet high and two feet in diameter much of the bark is exported as the true cinnamon and from the root a camphor may as is said be extracted  A TREE  Linschotten p  producing camphor  CAMPHOR  abounds here and in  Borneo  it grows near to the sea and is equal in bulk to our largest oaks being sometimes fifteen feet in circumference and a hundred feet high The timber is excellent for the use of the carpenter being light and durable and resists the injury of insects This valuable drug  Camphor  Marsden's Sumatra p  is as much valued by the  Sumatrans  as by the  Europeans  and serves for medical purposes It has very  long been in use among the  Arabs  much is sent to  China  as well as  Europe  THE  Styrax Benzoin  of Mr  Jonas Dryander  Phil Trans lxxvii p tab xii    BENZOIN  grows chiefly in the  Battas  country but not to a great size The gum is procured by incision and sent down to the ports in large cakes a vast quantity is transmitted to  Europe  where in  Roman Catholic  countries it is used as incense the rest is a most valuable medicine as an expectorant and styptic and forms the basis of  Turlington  's balsam It is burnt in all the  Malaye  isles to perfume the rooms to expel the insects the unwholesome air and noxious exhalations I am doubtful whether this tree has been well ascertained for  Linschotten  P  who seems well acquainted with it speaks of it as of vast height and size  Coffee  is cultivated in  Sumatra  but for want of skill  COFFEE  the berries are not in any esteem  BOTH the  Gossypium arboreum  and  herbaceum  COTTON  may be had here in any quantities but for want of encouragement no more is cultivated than serves for the uses of the country  Bombax Ceiba  is planted near every village and strikes the eye of strangers by its singular form being in shape of the branches like a dumb waiter so regularly do they spread one above the other  EBONY  Diospyros melanoxylon  Flor Coroman tab xlvi    EBONY  that valued wood for furniture so highly esteemed by our ancestors is common here It has been known since the days of  Virgil  India  fert  ebenum  molles sua thura  Sabaei  Pliny  gives us a whole chapter on this wood  Lib xii c  he says it was  Trunco enodi materie nigri splendoris ac vel sine arte protinus jucundi  Virgil  was mistaken by confining ebony to  India  it was also produced in  Aethiopia Hexodotus  in  Thalia  tells us that the  Aethiopians  paid their tribute every three years in that article to the  Persian  kings It was esteemed the most valuable tribute after gold and ivory  Pompey  had an ebony tree carried before him in his triumph over  Mithridates  yet to this day we have not one to place in our celebrated garden at  Kew  THE  Teek  Outlines of the Globe vol i p tab iv    Tectona grandis  TEEK  Tectona grandis  the pride of the eastern forests grows in the north and east of  Sumatra  THE pines which captain  Cook  found in the different parts of the south seas are common here  PINES  and are called  Arou  they flourish in a light sandy soil and are the first trees that grow on lands deserted by the sea At page tab of the first volume of Captain  Cook  's second voyage is some account of this tree which as yet has not been classically described  Sandal  wood  Ibid vol i p    SANDAL    Pterocarpus Santolinus  both the white and the red are produced in  Sumatra  THE poisonous  Manchineel  tree  MANCHINEEL  Hippomane Mancinilla  §  Catesby vol i p  is common here as well as in the  West Indies  and furnishes a most useful timber as it resists the attacks of the  Termes  or white ants it is also valuable in works of ornament the wood being finely veined but the juice is so noxious that if any falls on the eyes it will occasion a blindness of many days and the very droppings  of the leaves after rain raise blisters on the skin standing under its shade for any length of time affects the senses  ONE of the  Sideroxylons  or iron woods is common here  IRON WOOD  and of great use on account of its extraordinary hardness it may be the  Sideroxylon inerme Hort Elth  tab  Hort Kew  i  THE pitch called  Dammer  DAMMER  mentioned in the article  Pulo condor  is extracted in abundance from certain resinous trees which go under the common  Malayan  name of  Canari  they grow in vast plenty in the spice islands but we find that some species have extended far more west  Rumphius  describes all of them but the species productive of this article are the  Dammara nigra  vol ii p tab and the  Dammara nigra legitima  tab quantities are sent to  Bengal  and other places for the same uses as pitch and tar are in  Europe  and particularly for the shipping  AMONG the trees or vegetables productive of the necessary food for the natives  ESCULENTS  is the  Coco palm  rice the  Padda  or upland the common  Mayz Sesamum  in great quantities for the oil it produces which is used only in burning  Ricinus palma Christi  for the castor oil grows wild  Costus Arabicus Amomum zerambet  and several others are raised for medicinal purposes A  Rumphius  is wanted to pervade the forests of this vast island and bring to light the numberless hidden treasures it contains important perhaps in mechanics medicine and the luxuries of life  THE  Cycas circinalis  or sago tree  Outlines of the Globe vol i p  begins to appear here but is not in such general use as a food  SAGO  as we shall find it in the  more eastern islands the plenty of rice supersedes the necessity of it in  Sumatra  I must not pass over the knowledge that our great traveller Sir  John Mandeville  Travels p  had of this valuable tree who found it in a great  Yle  he calls  Pathen  "IN that lond" says that flower of chivalry  growen trees that beren mele whereof men maken gode bred and white and of gode savour and it semethe as it were of whete but it is not allynges of suche savour And zif zou like to here how the mele comethe out of the trees I shalle seye zou Men hewen the trees with an hachet alle

than thei han it to a mylle to grynde and it becomethe fair mele and white  I SHALL conclude this subject with mentioning that on this coast  STRANGE PLANT OF PURCHAS  near  Tappanooly  Mr  Charles Miller  Phil Trans vol lxviii p  found the  strange plant  as  Purchas  Vol i p  calls it discovered by Sir  James Lancaster  on the island of  Sombrero  who speaks of it as a tree which shrunk into the ground as soon as it was touched Wonderful things were related of it by our old navigator It is named says Mr  Miller  by the  Malayes Lalanlaut  or sea grass  It is found in sandy bays or in shallow water where it appears like a slender strait stick but when you attempt to touch it immediately withdraws itself into the sand I could never observe any  tentacula  a broken piece near a foot long which after many unsuccessful attempts I drew out was perfectly  strait and uniform and resembled a worm drawn over a knitting needle when dry it is a coral  THAT  Sumatra  was known to the antients is most probable but that only partially This and two others which  Ptolemy  unites seem in the opinion of Mr  Caverhill  to have been the  Sabaddibae  of the old geographer The  Mahometan  travellers of the year called it  Ramni  They speak of its gold mines and excellent camphor and of the inhabitants being cannibals  Marco Polo  is very diffuse in his account of this island which he calls the little  Java  he actually travelled over six of its eight kingdoms and gives various particulars long since confirmed by the later travellers He mentions the custom of eating human flesh he describes the Rhinoceros under the name of  Licorne  camphor sago the cocoa palms and the tapping them for the acquisition of the liquor  Toddy  so necessary a drink to the inhabitants  AFTER a very long interval the  Portuguese  again discovered  Sumatra  PORTUGUESE  Lopez Sequeira  in by the command of his great master sailed on a voyage of discovery and arrived at the port of  Pedeer  to the east of  Acheen  at the northern end of the island  Osorio vol p  there he found ships from  Pegu Bengal  and several other countries The king a  Mahometan  treated him with much civility The great  Albuquerque  visited the island in person and entered into a treaty with the king of  Pedeer  The  Portuguese  afterwards engaged deeply in the wars between the petty monarchs of the country but I do not find that they ever made any settlement  THE  Dutch  followed them in  DUTCH  An account of that voyage may be seen in  L'Histoire de la Navigation de L'Inde orientale  printed at  Amsterdam  in In future I shall in my references to those voyages cite them by the name of  Nicolas  's collection who was the publisher At p is given an account of their first descent and a plate of the dresses of the inhabitants The  Dutch  formed several factories in  Sumatra  which flourish to this day the principal is at  Padang  in the neighborhood of the gold country Their next is at  Palanbang  for the sake of the tin which is dug by the natives and fused on the isle of  Banca  on the east side of  Sumatra  opposite to the discharge of the river of  Palambang  The city stands some miles from the mouth It once belonged to the king of  Bantam  in  Java  and is even to this day peopled by  Javans  but since the  Dutch  have rendered that monarchy in a manner dependant on themselves they most probably may be styled its masters Besides making it the magazine of the tin drawn from  Banca  they collect vast quantities of pepper from the neighboring parts In this city was attacked by a  Dutch  fleet sent from  Batavia  to revenge some most barbarous murders committed on their countrymen it was strongly fortified with trunks of trees closely put together and mounted with numbers of cannon Notwithstanding this the  Dutch  succeeded and burnt the city to the ground  THE  English  are at present in possession of the great trade of  Sumatra  ENGLISH  The reputation of its vast wealth gave rise to the first voyage ever made by our countrymen to the  East Indies Elizabeth  in the d year of her reign issued her patent which constituted  originally the  East India  company It is given at length by  Purchas  Pilgrimage vol i p    IN consequence of this that able sailor  James Lancaster  SIR JAMES LANCASTER  afterwards Sir  James  was sent there and sailed from  Torbay  on April d He commanded the  Dragon  of six hundred tons and had with him the  Hector  of three hundred the  Ascension  of two hundred and sixty and one more Her Highness furnished her general as he was called with letters to divers of the eastern potentates among others one to the king of  Acheen  the chief and first object of the voyage He did not arrive at  Sumatra  till May d The fame of  Elizabeth  's victories over the  Spaniards  had reached the king's ears and in consequence  Lancaster  was most favorably received he presented gifts of great value on the part of his mistress and received others in return The  Portuguese  did all in their power to prevent a good understanding between the  English  and the king but to no purpose  Lancaster  even made a short cruise and took a rich ship from  Saint Thome  on the  Coromandel  coast belonging to the  Portuguese  which was deemed a lawful prize that kingdom being then in possession of our great enemy  Philip  II Our general got in part of his lading of pepper in this island the rest in  Malacca  and after obtaining many valuable privileges from the king of  Acheen  returned with a most friendly letter from the  Sumatran  prince He met with a dreadful storm off  Madagascar  in the midst of the confusion he thought of the services he might render to his country by this remarkable notice  The passage to the  East Indies  lies in degrees minutes by the  northwest on the  American  side  After encountering many difficulties he anchored safe in the  Downs  on September th Sir  James  acquired great wealth and reputation by this voyage which he lived thirty years after to enjoy as he well deserved  WE followed the advantages of this enterprize The  Dutch  who had settled themselves in the island entertained the highest jealousy of our rising commerce and gave all possible opposition they even once expelled us from  Bantam  where we had a factory We then turned our thoughts towards  Acheen  and met there some of the island chieftains in the year who invited us to settle on their lands this gave rise to our establishment at  Bencoolen  BENCOOLEN  which became the supreme factory The fort called fort  Marlborough  was founded we are now the principal traders in the island and export from thence annually twelve hundred tons of pepper the greatest part to  Europe  the rest to  China  This settlement is unwholesome the air full of malignant vapors the mountains continually cloathed with thick heavy clouds which break out in lightning thunder rain and shortlived storms the fort is tolerably healthy during the sickly season and to that place the merchants should make their retreat  IN the year the  French  admiral  D'Estaign  destroyed this fort and all our other settlements on the island in order to drive us from the lucrative pepper trade but they were soon reestablished and our possessions secured to us in by the treaty of  Paris  ON the coast of the  Battas  country are two settlements  NATAL  one at  Natal  and another on a small isle in the noble bay of  Tappanoly  which penetrates deeply inland and is capable of containing all the navies of  Europe  so as to ride securely in any weather with such a multitude of harbors that a large ship could remain concealed so as to elude all search In this bay is found plenty of that enormous shell the  Keemo  or  Chama Gigas  Bonan i Argenville tab fig E  it is often three foot broad and of the weight of five hundred pounds and is taken in deep water by thrusting a long bamboo between the shells while they are gaping which close and then are drawn up the shell is quite white and worked by the natives like ivory The fish weighs often thirty pounds and is excellent when stewed  Sumatra  is divided into numerous little kingdoms  ACHEEN  but that of  Acheen  is the most powerful It once had a strong and numerous fleet with which it contested the superiority of the sea with the adjacent princes  Acheen  was the great  emporium  of the island and the resort of the  Arabs  for the gold camphor benzoin pepper and all the commercial productions of the country The government is entirely feudal being founded on the  Malayan  plan As to the genuine  Sumatrans  they are called  Orang Ooloo  or countrymen from their residence in villages The  Sultan  of the empire of  Menangecabow  EMPIRE OF MENANGECABOW  for a long time reigned lord paramount over all the other princes who owned their authority to be derived from him at present his real power is not superior to that of a common Rajah yet still a superstitious regard is paid to his person he is sovereign pontiff the opinion of his sanctity is supported by the  Mahometan  priests and an  air of mystery surrounds his court he issues out dictatorial edicts which are received with respect but attended to no farther than is consistent with the interests or pleasure of them to whom they are addressed All the  Sumatrans  are originally derived from the  Malayes  or inhabitants of the peninsula of  Malacca  when spoken of in this island the word  Malaye  implies the  Mahometans  who chiefly inhabit the coasts  Mahometanism  is the religion of all the  Malaye  governments all observe the feudal system  FEUDAL CUSTOM  and commute the punishment of crimes for money which have their price as customary among the  Germans  and  Britons  Murder as well as other crimes having its price this custom is a dreadful encouragement particularly since the  Daltoos  or magistrates receive the ransom Our factory was desirous of putting a stop to the frequent assassinations but was told by the  Daltoo  that he should be a loser as he got twenty dollars a head when the families prosecuted Some of these governments are very antient being formed soon after the first population of the island  Menangecabow  is one which received the  Mahometan  faith in later times from the  Malayes  of  Malacca  who had made a conquest of their antecedent brethren  IN p of the preceding volume I have given the general description of the persons of the  Malayes  I cannot help thinking that those of  Malacca  were a distinct people who drove the antient inhabitants of the peninsula to take refuge in  Sumatra  where they retain their language and alphabet and that the  Malayes  in future times reconquered the descendants of these refugees and each still retain their peculiar language and writing  I SHALL not attempt to give an account of the various nations into which this island is divided  NATIVES OF THE BATTAS  That of the  Battas  is too remarkable to be overlooked they are of smaller stature than the rest of the  Sumatrans  and their complexions fairer their religion is paganism yet from very antient custom they hold in respect the sultan of  Menangecabow  in all probability from the period in which both were of the same religion We have our settlement on their coast which enabled two of our factory Mr  Charles Miller  and Mr  Holloway  to undertake a journey into the interior parts of the country I refer my reader for the particular account to the lxviiith volume of the Philosophical Transactions From this expedition is verified the circumstance of the natives being  anthropophagi  and eat the flesh of prisoners of war or of offenders condemned for capital crimes As soon as the man is put to death they rush on the body cut pieces of the yet tremulous limbs dip it in lemon juice and salt and eat it with exquisite pleasure Mr  Miller  says they spake in raptures of the soles of the feet and palms of the hands as peculiar dainties  Marco Polo  Bergeron p  tells us that in the kingdom of  Dragoiam  they eat the bodies of their relations and best friends who chance to die thinking it a peculiar respect to the deceased They then bury the bones in the caverns of the mountains  Polo  mentions this horrid custom in other islands so that it certainly had spread far more extensively than is imagined The opinion was generally exploded till the voyages in our days furnished us with several examples some most dreadful in which many  Europeans  fell victims to the cannibal appetite Even the  illustrious  Cook  found in part a sepulchre in the maws of the inhabitants of the  Sandwich  islands  ON the island of  Enganho  ENGANHO ISLAND  about ninety miles south of fort  Marlborough  are inhabitants of most savage appearance and of a language unintelligible to the few who have visited the place It was scarcely known to have been inhabited as it was long deemed inaccessible by reason of the rocks and dreadful breakers Commodore  Beaulieu  calls it  L'Isle Trompeuse  and adds that the natives murder all that come on shore It appears from the  East India  pilot  Vol ii tab  to be of a triangular form Mr  Charles Miller  was hardy enough to visit it He found the men from five feet eight to five feet ten inches high of a red color with black strait hair cut short that of the women long and rolled into a neat curl on the top of the head The men went quite naked the women had no more than a plantain leaf to hide their nakedness the arms of the men were lances headed with the bone of fish their canoes made of two boards sewed together and the seam filled with pitch Their houses were circular supported on stakes of ironwood they had no sort of fowl cattle or rice they lived on cocoa nuts sugar canes and sweet potatoes or fish dried in the smoke The fish they caught with their lances or in nets very neatly manufactured by themselves Their behavior was hospitable nor did they give any sort of umbrage till some imprudent conduct on our side excited an alarm Conch shells the  Murex Tritonis  resounded in all parts of the island and our people thought fit to make a sudden retreat  A MOST furious surf rises on great part of the western and  southern side of  Sumatra  SURF  such as vexes the western coasts of  Africa  It begins says Mr  Marsden  Sumatra p  to assume its form at some distance from the place where it breaks gradually accumulating as it moves forward till it gains a height in common of fifteen to twenty feet when it overhangs at top and falls like a cascade nearly perpendicular involving itself as it descends the noise made by the fall is prodigious and during the stillness of the night may be heard many miles up the country It forms sometimes but a single range along the shore at other times there is a succession of two three four or more behind each other extending perhaps half a mile out to sea The number of ranges is generally in proportion to the height and violence of the surf  Java  is separated from the island of  Sumatra  JAVA  by the narrow streights of  Sunda  their depth is from thirty to fifty fathoms and in some places are no soundings the voyager is advised of the approach to  Java  by vast drifts of bamboos and flocks of the booby  Catesby i  or according to Mr  Asbeck  's reference the  Pelecanus piscator  of  Linnaeus  The currents are strong in the narrowest part and from  January  to  April  usually run from the westward the rest of the year from the eastward  THE streights begin with great breadth between  Sumanca  bay in  Sumatra  and  Welcome  bay in  Java Sumanca  and other peaks mark the former  PRINCE'S ISLAND  Prince  's island lies near the  Javanese  shore and is known by a small mount called  Java  head or the  Pico  The latitude of the anchoring place in  Kasuarus  bay is ° ′ ″ south This island is universally wooded and vegetation  advances so rapidly that notwithstanding what is cut for the use of the shipping it seems nothing impaired It has some inhabitants so like in figure color manners and even language to those of the south sea islands as greatly to strike Captain  Cook  who anchored here in after having been so long conversant with them The chief business of the natives is to supply the shipping with fowls small tortoises or green turtle hog deer weighing about forty pounds monkies some vegetables and above all water  THIS island is as unhealthy as the rest of these fatal coasts  ISLAND OF CRACATOA  which has induced many navigators to prefer taking water at the isle of  Cracatoa  a small spot about nine miles in circumference and some leagues to the northeast of  Prince  's island In one part is a hot spring used by the natives as a bath The island is high rising gradually from the sea and covered with trees In the coral reefs which skirt the shores are plenty of small green turtle  BETWEEN  Hog  point in  Sumatra  and  Cickorang  in  Java  the streights suddenly contract In the middle are the small isles called  Midchannel  island the  Isle de Milieu  and the rock  Le grand Toque Le Brun  Vol ii  calls the breadth a league and a half After doubling the point  BANTAM  appears the bay of  Bantam  deep round and sprinkled over with many small isles at the bottom is the city capital of the kingdom After Sir  James Lancaster  left  Acheen  he sailed to this port the king was one of the  Indian  monarchs whom  Elizabeth  honored with her correspondence her letter was graciously received  Lancaster  established here our  first factory in the  Indian  seas and after loading his ship with pepper took his departure for  England  THE  Portuguese  visited this coast in the time of the great  Albuquerque  PORTUGUESE  the commanders in that expedition were  Roderigo Brittio  and  Ferdinand Andrada  who took part with one of the princes of the country engaged in war with the king of  Bantam  and gained a great victory over his fleet Not long after  George Albuquerque  made an attempt to storm  Bantam  Osorio vol ii p  but was repulsed with great loss  Lacsemanna  the general of  Malacca  the ablest officer of his age had the most considerable share in the defeat  AT the first arrival of the  Europeans Java  according to Sir  Thomas Herbert  P  was under one supreme the emperor of  Matara  next to him was the king of  Bantam  whom Sir  Thomas  only styles a viceroy possibly at first the government might have been like that of the primaeval establishments of  Sumatra  and in after times the delegated powers assumed an independene  THE subtil  Dutch  took more efficacious methods to gain footing in the country  DUTCH  after various great events various quarrels and reconciliations by an essential service done in to one of the monarchs of  Bantam  they received from him an exclusive grant of the trade of his kingdom This they support by a slight armed force in fact they are real masters of the island notwithstanding they pay a pretended respect to the native powers Before that acquisition of privilege by the  Dutch  the  English  and  Danes  had very flourishing factories but both were expelled by the influence of their  Batavian  rival  Le Brun  Travels vol ii p  visited this court in and exhibits a fine picture of the effeminacy of the Oriental monarch illustrating it with a print All the attendants were females even his body guards One is seen with her musket on her shoulder others with lances Dancing girls and two diminutive dwarfs performing before his majesty shew the festivity of the court let me add that one of the ladies officers of state bore the sword another the golden bowl and so to the number of ten each carrying a different badge of state Near this city he also saw a miracle in this climate a lady of the age of a hundredandthirty  AFTER passing some leagues to the east through the group of the  Thousand  isles we arrive at the bay of  Batavia  amidst others equally numerous each named by the  Dutch  in memory of their own country The traveller would imagine himself in  Holland  and more so when he enters the great and magnificent city of  Batavia  BATAVIA  seated in a swamp as like as possible to their boasted capital  Amsterdam  but here overhung with pestilential vapors that would soon by their fatal effects depopulate the native country did not the teeming  Germany  annually pour down the  Rhine  its thousands to supply the loss in a place so injudiciously fixed on through national prejudice As to the troops they are picked out of the vagabonds of  Amsterdam  and sent to certain death for in the space of three years not five survive out of a battalion of an equal number of hundreds Let Doctor  Lind  Essay on Diseases p  describe the fatal effects of the injudicious selection of situation of this proud capital on some of the  British  subjects who unfortunately put in here  During the sickly season at  Batavia  a boat belonging to the  Medway  which attended on shore every night was three times successively manned not one having survived that service They were all taken ill in the night when on shore or when returning on board so that the officers were at length obliged to employ none but the natives of the country on that business  ON the arrival of the  Europeans  in this country  JACATRA  a town then called  Calappa  and about the year changed to that of  Jacatra  stood on the site of  Batavia  The  regulus  of the place had made an alliance with the  English  which gave great umbrage to the  Dutch  who had likewise their settlements here under the protection of a fort or two the rivals came to action for a time we had the superiority and in the year after a successful battle at sea compelled the  Dutch  commodore  Koen  to retreat to  Amboina  but he soon returned in such force as to oblige the  English  by capitulation totally to evacuate the place This was not a national war but carried on entirely between the two companies  Koen  utterly destroyed the town of  Jacatra  FOUNDED IN  and built in its place the present  Batavia  on a far more extensive scale The anniversary is observed in honor of the founder to this day The streets are regular each has its canal which in the dry season emit a most horrid stench from the filth flung into them and the closeness of the trees planted on the banks prevent the due circulation No place could possibly be selected more unwholesome so that what  Purchas  relates of  Bantam  may well be applied to this city  SICKLY CLIMATE  that it is not a place to recover  men that are sick but to kill men who come there in health  The  Jacatra  and other rivers which creep through the city almost stagnate A dead buffalo or hog flung into them is perhaps many days in reaching the sea These streams pass through a fenny plain rising from the  Blauenberg  or blue mountains about forty miles distant For the benefit of a quick and easy conveyance of such as are in a convalescent state an excellent road is formed for seventy miles leading from  Batavia  to the mountains equal to any turnpike road in  England  Batavia  is the seat of the viceroy of the  Indies  the  Dutch  support him with a splendor equal to that of most crowned heads nor does he go out without his guards magnificently dressed this is to instil respect into the natives The town is prodigiously populous but neither the public or the private buildings are particularly fine they possibly are in the same state as they were in the time of Mr  Nieuhoff  who in his travels  Churchill's Col vol ii  has given views of many of both kinds The whole city is surrounded with gardens for a great distance and the canals cut far into the interior of the island serve to convey all sorts of provisions to market many forts are dispersed over the country to awe the inhabitants  THE  Chinese  MASSACRE OF THE CHINESE  attracted by the sweets of gain settled here in vast numbers they are said to have had in the year two thousand four hundred houses in the city and suburbs some of which were the best in  Batavia  many of them were levelled to the ground in the infamous massacre of this nation in the year It began on occasion of the celebration of a festival in  honor of their idol the  Jootsje de Batavia  a hideous likeness of the Devil the  Dutch  only worshipped him in private the enthusiasm of the devotees created disorder they grew riotous and a guard sent to restrain their zeal executed its commission with great vigor which excited the rage of the  Chinese  so that much blood was shed The governor and council under pretence of public security ordered every  Chinese  to be put to the sword women and children excepted reduced to despair they set fire to their own houses numbers perished in the flames and those who rushed out were put to death by the soldiery above twelve thousand perished in this horrible affair The  Dutch  published their account which is left to the judgment of the reader to believe or disbelieve they would make the cause to have been a regular conspiracy yet the governor two of the counsellors of the  Indies  and the attorney general were deposed and imprisoned the  Dutch  certainly thought them guilty The wealth of the  Chinese  seems to have been the inducement to the bloody business The governor's effects which he was endeavoring to carry to  Europe  amounted to half a million sterling So little were the  Dutch  apprehensive of any harm from a new colonization of the  Chinese  that they permitted any number which pleased to settle again in  Batavia  and multitudes resorted there as if nothing had happened The governor thought proper to send an apology to the emperor of  China  which he received with unconcern considering that his empire was overcharged with inhabitants and indifferent to subjects who had deserted the tombs of their ancestors  THE  Chinese  seem to have been on the best footing with the  Dutch  In they gave a proof of their respect by having a noble medal struck in honor of the governor  James Speks  On one side is the plan of  Batavia  on the reverse a  Chinese  inscription

naked corpses will be seen hanging on the trees by their legs arms or necks all lacerated by the rapacious birds and emitting the most pestilential stench no notice is taken of the death of a slave the  Dutchman  scarcely ever suffers for any crime Sir  Thomas Herbert  is perhaps too severe on this city when he calls it "a second  Sodom"  BESIDES  Batavia  the  Dutch  have numbers of smaller settlements on the coast to collect the rich productions of the island At  Tsierobon  is one which country is governed by a dependent sultan He furnishes them with the productions of his  dominions an immense quantity of rice coffee sugar pepper cotton and  Areca  all these are bought at the price the consciences of the company fix which is certainly not at the highest rate False weights are in general use with the company's servants nor are they in any danger of being called to account as it tends to the service of their congenial masters  PEPPER  Pepper is the great commodity of the island  Bantam  furnishes the  Dutch  with three millions of pounds annually  LET us now pass on the the island of  Madura  in Lat ° south  THE  Dutch  picked a quarrel with its prince in the year  PRINCE OF MADURA HIS TRAGICAL STORY  who after seeing his country invaded his subjects massacred and his own ruin to be certain collected all his treasures and with his young son wives concubines and a few select friends fled to  Borneo  in hopes of an asylum He was closely pursued but by putting into creeks and inlets for a short time escaped the unhappy fugitives set sail in the night and retreated into their hiding places in the day At length to their great joy they saw a ship with  English  colors They flung themselves on the protection of the commander who received the prince and his treasure The  Dutch Guarda costa  came up with him as he knew force could not prevale he by treachery seized on the  English  captain put him into irons nor would he set him at liberty till the unhappy prince was delivered into the power of his enemies Grown desperate he barricaded the cabin it was forced open jealous of the honor of his women he stabbed two to the heart others equally delicate flung themselves over board Oppressed with numbers and greatly wounded the aged sultan was seized and conveyed to  Batavia  and from thence to the  wretched island of  Robben  near the cape of  Good Hope  Forster's Voy ii  where he was living in  April  dragging on a miserable being in the character of a common slave Whoever wishes to have a fuller account of this tragical and infamous event may find it pathetically told in a voyage to the  East Indies  published in the perusal will be a trial of the heart of the reader  Balimbuan  is another little kingdom  SAME OF THE PRINCE OF BALIMBUAN  at the eastern extremity of the island It seems that the  Dutch  apparently without any motives of emolument attacked also the prince of this country he defended himself vigorously for two years was overpowered himself confined for life in the castle of  Batavia  his family torn from him and sent to keep company with the  Madurian  prince at  Robben  island  Matara  MATARA  the capital of the once potent empire of that name is in about Lat ° ′ on the south side of  Java  Even this empire was after many contests rendered dependent on the  Dutch  who having deposed the usurping sovereign placed the rightful heir on the throne but they chose for him his place of residence secured his allegiance by a citadel and supplying him with every conveniency for his pleasures rendered this weak prince entirely subservient to their will In this part of the island is plenty of  Teek  and timber for the building of ships or for exportation to other parts of  India  here they have their docks besides they carry on great commerce in rice salt pepper and many other valuable productions  Java  wants its  Marsden  but with such lights as I can procure I shall attempt a brief description of this important island  Marco Polo  is very concise in his account of it which he names simply  Java  Bergeron p  In his days there was only one monarch It was greatly frequented by merchants for the sake of the pepper and other spices he mentions nutmegs which probably have been since extirpated by the political  Dutch James Bontius  BONTIUS  a physician of great eminence who flourished here very soon after the foundation of  Batavia  by  Koen  has furnished very good materials for the medical and natural history of the island It is from a variety of authors I must select accounts relative to other subjects  Java  extends from  West Point  in Lat ° ′ south  EXTENT OF JAVA  Long ° ′ from  Paris  to  East Point  in Lat ° ′ Long ° near seven hundred miles in length The course is west and east with an inclination to the south the greatest breadth is about forty leagues and nearly of equal diameter except where the bays make some small contractions  THE land on the coasts varies at the western and eastern extremities it is high but I believe in general the shores are low swampy and unhealthy A lofty chain of mountains runs from west to east through the middle with numbers of branches issuing from each side to uncertain distances from the sea Some of the mountains are very lofty and the air cool and salubrious among them are very active volcanoes  VOLCANOES  the mountain of  Parang  is the principal and said to be very productive of gold the  Dutch  spent near a million in attempting the discovery but were disappointed in their search these mountains produce besides  Rubies  and  Sapphires  Earthquakes are frequent and dreadful  I AM not qualified to give any account of the natives of these  Appennines  of  Java  NATIVES  The general description is that their faces are flat their cheeks broad their hair short and black their eyebrows large their eyes very small They boast that they are descended from the  Chinese  if true we may account for the probability of that nation migrating to this island they may have been from the beginning in the constant habit of frequenting the coasts The manners of the mountaneers are said to be fierce and barbarous and their rites idolatrous The inhabitants of the cities and coasts are  Mahometans  Representations of the persons of the  Javanese  in different characters are given by Mr  Nieuhoff  in his travels  P p  in  Linschotten  P  and in the very curious old book of voyages already cited are numbers of prints beginning at p and continued to p and at p is given the manner of a dance or rather a mimical representation exactly like the elegant one at p plate of the first volume of Captain  Cook  's last voyage  Le Brun  Vol ii tab  represents a very curious figure of one of the savage natives of the southern coast he seemed a fine made man almost black his head covered with thick frizzled hair lips large nose depressed body naked except a cloth round his waste on the right arm and left leg an ivory ring his weapons were a strong bow several lances headed with something sharp and one with a bearded bone perhaps that of some ray The painter however has certainly got hold of a native of the  Papua  islands and not of the south of  Java  IN enumerating the quadrupeds of this island  QUADRUPEDS  I shall omit all  which are in common to  Sumatra  and that I believe with very few exceptions

extracted from the celebrated  Bohon Upas  of  Java  the  Arbor Toxicaria  or  Ipo  of  Rumphius  vol ii p tab and the  Epu  of  Kaempf Amoen Exot  p I shall extract from the first what he has said respecting this dreadful tree  A DREADFUL POISON  in order to establish the truth of what has been reported of its dire effects and illustrate the relation with certain melancholy proofs after which will be given the more than apocryphal tales of the manner of procuring that infernal juice  THE tree  STRANGE ACCOUNT OF  so long famed in many of the  East India  islands for the wonderful and almost incredible effects of its poisonous juice has hitherto eluded the prying eye of the naturalist and consequently its class in the botanical system has never yet been ascertained notwithstanding the indefatigable researches of  Europeans  to obtain full information upon so interesting a subject all we know for certain of the tree itself is the figure of its leaf and fruit which the learned and accurate  Rumphius  has exhibited in the  Herbarium Amboinense  After much entreaty and persevering application to the  Dutch  governors of  Celebes  the most noted of all the islands of the  East Indies  for the production of this tree  Rumphius  was favored by  De Cops  governor of  Macassar  with a branch of it and a specimen of its poisonous juice An ensign of the army was deputed in form to be the messenger of so rare a present Of such a penetrating and malignant nature  was this found to be that the very touching with the hand the  Bamboo  in which it was inclosed occasioned a tingling and numbness like that felt in a limb that had been exposed to intense cold and suddenly brought to the fire  NATURE has wisely ordained that this baneful tree should be extremely rare and its situation the most sequestered from the busy haunts of men amidst mountains of difficult access and inhabited by the most barbarous tribes they alone are acquainted with the effects that this subtile poison has upon the circumambient air and such animals as approach its tremendous shade The atmosphere is here said to be so infected by the deleterious quality of the effluvia of this pestilential tree that birds which accidentally perch upon its boughs are seized with torpor and drop down dead No man dares approach it without his hands feet and head being well shrouded with linen cloths were this precaution neglected he would become benumbed and presently lose the use of his limbs The dripping of rain water from the tree upon the body causes it to swell and should it fall upon the bare head the loss of all the hair would ensue No other tree can exist in its vicinity and the earth beneath it is parched and withered so that Death seems eminently to have fixed his station here  IT is no wonder that the love of the marvellous natural to mankind has added somewhat to the truly astonishing scenes that the environs of this tree exhibit Hence the rude nations of this mountanous tract have made it the habitation of a serpent whose eyes glare like fire in the night and remind us of  the fabled gardens of the  Hesperides  in classic lore whose stationary centinel was a watchful dragon  THE  Dutch  call this tree  Macasserne Giftboom  or  Spattenboom  and in the  Malaye  language it is termed  CajuUpas  that is to say poisontree and the fruit simply  Upas  By the people of  Macassar  and throughout  Celebes  both the tree and its poison are called  Ipo  THE darts to which the natives apply this poison are a foot or eighteen inches in length very slender made of reed or light wood and armed with the tooth of the  Lamia  shark smeared with poison These are fixed in a tube five or six feet long and blown by the breath of the assailant with great force to the distance of pistol shot upon reaching the destined object the barbed tooth adheres and the wood only can be extracted or sometimes detaches itself and falls to the ground The effect of the poison is to produce a sensation of heat in all parts of the body and oppressive Vertigo in the head which is presently succeeded by a total debility and death within the space of half an hour is the certain consequence Nay so rapid are its effects in some instances as to prove fatal in less than a quarter of an hour And farther so instantaneously does its virus pervade the whole human frame that by experiments made upon malefactors it has been proved that if the thumb or the foot only be wounded by the poisonous dart and amputation immediately performed upon the affected member astonishing to relate death infallibly ensues  AFTER a long intercourse and many bloody contests with the  natives of  Celebes  which may be stiled the  Colchos  of  India  being an island noted for many other sorts of poison the  Dutch  acquired the knowlege of some specifics among the indigenous plants which disarmed this tremendous weapon of much of its terrors Here are said to be two species of the  Ipo  distinguished by the names of male and female and that the poison of the latter is much less efficacious than that of the former and used chiefly for the destruction of game The juice is extracted from the tree by piercing the bark of the trunk and inserting therein long bamboos sharpened at the point Four or five of these are fixed to one tree and remain three or four days that the sap may leisurely distil into them and when filled they are removed for use  Mr  N P Foersch  a  Dutch  surgeon stationed at  Batavia  in gives the following account of the situation of the tree and the manner of collecting the poison The reader is left to form a judgment of the writer's authority and how far his credulity is to be censured "It is" says he  seated about twentyseven leagues from  Soura  the seat of the emperor encircled by high hills and mountains and the country around to the distance of ten or twelve miles has neither tree nor shrub or even the least plant or grass I have made the tour all around this dangerous spot at about eighteen miles distant from the centre and I found the aspect of the country on all sides equally dreary The easiest ascent of the hills is from that part where the old ecclesiastic dwells I had procured a recommendation from an old  Malayan  priest to another priest who lives on the nearest inhabitable spot to the tree which is  about fifteen or sixteen miles distant The letter proved of great service to me in my undertaking as that priest is appointed by the emperor to reside there to prepare for eternity the souls of those who for different crimes are sentenced to approach the tree and to procure the poison From his house the criminals are sent for the poison into which the points of all warlike instruments are dipped It is of high value and produces a considerable revenue to the emperor  THE poison which is procured from this tree is a gum that issues out between the bark and the tree itself like the camphor Malefactors who for their crimes are sentenced to die are the only persons who fetch the poison and this is the only chance they have of saving their lives After sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge they are asked in court whether they will die by the hands of the executioner or whether they will go to the  Upas  tree for a box of poison They commonly prefer the latter proposal as there is not only some chance of preserving their lives but also a certainty in case of their safe return that a provision will be made for them in future by the emperor They are also permitted to ask a favor from the emperor which is generally of a trifling nature and commonly granted They are then provided with a silver or tortoiseshell box in which they are to put the poisonous gum and are properly instructed how to proceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition Among other particulars they are always told to attend to the direction of the winds as they are to go towards the tree before the wind so that the effluvia from the tree are always blown  from them They are told likewise to travel with the utmost dispatch as that is the only method of insuring a safe return They are afterwards sent to the house of the old priest to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations Here they generally remain some days in expectation of a favorable breeze During that time the ecclesiastic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and admonitions  WHEN the hour of their departure arrives the priest puts them on a long leather cap with two glasses before their eyes which comes down as far as their breast and also provides them with a pair of leather gloves They are then conducted by the priest and their friends and relations about two miles on their journey Here the priest repeats his instructions and tells them where they are to look for the tree He shews them a hill which they are told to ascend and that on the other side they will find a rivulet which they are to follow and which will conduct them directly to the  Upas  They now take leave of each other and amidst prayers for their success the delinquents hasten away  THE worthy old ecclesiastic has assured me that during his residence there for upwards of thirty years he had dismissed above seven hundred criminals in the manner which I have described and that scarcely two out of twenty have returned He shewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy sufferers with the date of their departure from his house annexed and a list of the offences for which they had been condemned to which was added a list of those who had returned in safety I afterwards  saw another list of these culprits at the jailkeeper's at  Soura Charta  and found that they perfectly corresponded with each other and with the different informations which I afterwards obtained  I WAS present at some of these melancholy ceremonies and desired different delinquents to bring with them some pieces of the wood or a small branch or some leaves of this wonderful tree I have also given them silk cords desiring them to measure its thickness I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one of them on his return and all I could learn from him concerning the tree itself was that it stood on the border of a rivulet as described by the old priest that it was of a middling size that five or six young trees of the same kind stood close by it but that no other shrub or plant could be seen near it and that the ground was of a brownish sand full of stones almost impracticable for travelling and covered with dead bodies After many conversations with the old  Malayan  priest I questioned him about the first discovery and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree upon which he gave me the following answer  WE are told in our new Alcoran that above an hundred years ago the country around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted to the sins of  Sodom  and  Gomorrha  when the great prophet  Mahomet  determined not to suffer them to lead such detestable lives any longer he applied to  God  to punish them upon which  God  caused this tree to grow  out of the earth which destroyed them all and rendered the country for ever uninhabitable  SUCH was the  Malayan  opinion I shall not attempt a comment but must observe that all the  Malayans  considered this tree as an holy instrument of the great prophet to punish the sins of mankind and therefore to die of the poison of the  Upas  is generally considered among them as an honorable death For that reason I also observed that the delinquents who were going to the tree were generally dressed in their best apparel  THIS however is certain though it may appear incredible that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree not only no human creature can exist but that in that space of ground no living animal of any kind has ever been discovered I have also been assured by several persons of veracity that there are no fish in the waters nor has any rat mouse or any other vermin been seen there and when any birds fly so near this tree that the effluvia reaches them they fall a sacrifice to the effects of the poison This circumstance has been ascertained by different delinquents who in their return have seen the birds drop down and have picked them up dead and brought them to the old ecclesiastic  Mr  Foersch  gives us an account of the fatal effects in the following melancholy narration  In the year in the month of  February  I was present at the execution of thirteen of the emperors concubines at  Soura Charta  who were convicted of infidelity to the emperor's bed It was in the forenoon about eleven o'clock when the fair criminals were led into an open space within the walls of the emperor's palace There the  judge passed sentence upon them by which they are doomed to suffer death by a lancet poisoned with  Upas  After this the Alcoran was presented to them and they were according to the law of their great prophet  Mahomet  to acknowlege and to affirm by oath that the charges brought against them together with the sentence and their punishment were fair and equitable This they did by laying their right hand upon the Alcoran their left hands upon their breasts and their eyes lifted towards heaven the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips and they kissed it  THESE ceremonies over the executioner proceeded on his business in the following mannerThirteen posts each about five feet high had been previously erected to these the delinquents were fastened and their breasts stripped naked In this situation they remained a short time in continual prayers attended by several priests until a signal was given by the judge to the executioner on which the latter produced an instrument much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding horses With this instrument it being poisoned with the gum of the  Upas  the unhappy wretches were lanced in the middle of their breasts and the operation was performed upon them all in less than two minutes  MY astonishment was raised to the highest degree when I beheld the sudden effects of that poison for in about five minutes after they were lanced they were taken with a tremor attended with a  subsultus tendinum  after which they died in the greatest agonies crying out to GOD and  Mahomet  for mercy In sixteen minutes by my watch which I held in my hand all the criminals were no more some hours after  their death I observed their bodies full of livid spots much like those of the  Petechioe  their faces swelled their color changed to a kind of blue their eyes looked yellow c c  Though the recent information obtained in the course of Lord  Macartneys  embassy to  China  vol i p totally invalidates the authority of  Foersch  yet it appears evident that trees of a most deleterious nature and productive of the most active poisons really exist in  Java  Such also was the opinion of the author of this work whose depth of judgment placed him far remote from the imputation of credulity I have therefore ventured as in other instances to publish a faithful copy of the original manuscript E    THIS tree did not escape the notice of our great Sir  John Mandeville  he makes the poison produced from it to be taken inwardly I shall give his words and also the horrible opinion held at that time against the  Hebraean  race whom he accuses of a design of poisoning all Christendom with this infernal juice After speaking of the trees of beneficent use he says  Travels p    and there ben other trees that

thanked be alle myghty God thei fayleden of hire purpos but alle weys thei maken gret mortallitee of people  IN respect to the other trees and plants of  Java  I can only say that they agree with those of  Sumatra  and other islands of the great  Archipelago  Most will be found in my  Flora Indica  Let me only remark that the earliest  Dutch  navigators have  given tolerable descriptions of several in the often cited old book published by  Nicholas  from p to p accompanied with plates as expressive as could be cut on wood  THE vast island of  Borneo  is divided from the northern coast of  Java  by a sound between two and three hundred leagues in breadth  BORNEO  According to M  D'Anville  's scale the island is in length from south to north near three hundred leagues and its greatest breadth two hundred the circumference is estimated at two thousand miles so that it may justly be considered as the greatest island in the world It is of a pyriform shape its shores rude with projecting promontories and is divided by the equator into two unequal portions The far greater part of  Borneo  next to the sea especially the northern consists of swamps covered with forests of trees of numberless species and great sizes which penetrate for scores of miles towards the centre of the island These unstable muddy flats are divided by rivers which branch into multitudes of canals and are the only roads into the interior parts Lofty mountains are said to rise in the middle of the island many are volcanic and often occasion tremendous earthquakes  THIS great island is little known except merely on the coasts and even those remain yet so imperfectly explored that less can be said of it than of many smaller tracts So unstable are the swampy outskirts that in the attempts to establish factories the  Europeans  have been obliged to build them on piles driven into the ground or after the manner of the country to erect in the rivers their houses on posts fixed to floats formed of bodies of great trees and those moored by rattans to those growing on shore to prevent their being carried away by the floods In  such a manner are many of the towns of  Borneo  constructed they rise and fall with the tide which here flows but once in the twentyfour hours and that only in the day At spring tide these towns on the  Banjar  river experience the rise and fall of twelve feet  THE whole coasts are in the hands of  Malayans Moors  INHABITANTS  Macassars  and even  Japanese  who have perhaps for centuries driven the antient inhabitants into the interior parts The aborigines are of a black complexion a middle stature with long and black hair and generally better featured than the  Guinea Negroes  feeble in their bodies and very indolent and inactive The women small handsome and of a better color than the men Their general religion is of a mongrel kind of  Mahometanism  These maintain a feudal government under chieftains miscalled by our sailors kings The seat of the principal is at  Tatas  near to  Bandar Masseen  some miles up the country on the northern side and seated on a great river which for many miles is twice as broad as the  Thames  at  Gravesend  and bounded by trees of most stupendous height It is navigable far beyond  Bandar Masseen  for the largest ships and is greatly frequented by the  Chinese  jonks the river is called  China  for that reason We are not acquainted with the length of its navigation but it rises in the very middle of the island and runs all the way due south On this river we attempted to form a settlement under the Mr  Cunningham  we have before mentioned but by some imprudencies gave offence to the inhabitants and the greater part of our people were massacred The same fate has attended other factories of different  European  nations who  have endeavored to form settlements at  Succadana Samba  and many other places  Tatas  has its sultan These sovereigns command the trade of the island and furnish the  European  ships who happen to arrive with cargoes of pepper the staple of the country that article is brought down from the interior parts and sold to the  Europeans  or to the commercial  Asiatic  nations  IT is to Captain  Daniel Beeckman  that we owe the best account of  Borneo  he visited it in the beginning of this century and published his account in the year At p he gives the following list of the productions of the country  PRODUCTIONS OF  which abounds with pepper the best dragon's blood bezoar most excellent camphor pine apples citrons oranges lemons water melons musk melons plantains banana coco nuts and all sorts of fruit that are generally found in any part of the  East Indies  the mountains yield diamonds gold tin and iron the forests honey cotton deer goats buffaloes wild oxen wild hogs small horses bears tigers elephants and a multitude of monkies  THE pepper grows far up the country  PEPPER  and is collected by the very poorest people only they have all the different sorts black white and long  Sanguis Draconis  SANGUIS DRACONIS  or dragon's blood is a gum the exudation of certain trees of a bloody color There is a conjecture that this is the  Cinnaberis  of  Dioscorides  lib v c  Pliny  lib xxxiii c says that the name is  Indian  and then fables that it is the  Sanies  of the dragon oppressed by the weight of an elephant expiring with the bite and that the  Cinnaberis  is the mixed blood of each animal The antients procured under this notion the real drug and used it in medicine It was often adulterated  with the blood of goats the genuine kind was sold at a great rate  THE trees or shrubs which we know to produce this medicine in our dispensatory are the  Dracaena Draco  of which  Vandelli  has given a good figure in his monograph on the subject According to  Kaempfer Amoen Exot  another of the vegetables it is extracted from is a  Palmapinus Rottani Dsierenang  one of the  Rotangs  described by  Rumphius  under the name of  Palmijuncus Draco  v p tab fig This grows in the thick and almost impervious forests of  Java  ANOTHER kind is the produce of the  Santalum Rubrum  SANDAL WOOD  or  Red Sanders  and again from the  Dracoena Terminalis  of  Linnaeus Rumph  iv p tab called in  Ternate Ngassi  or  Hassi  This species grows in  Borneo  and bears a fruit says  Beeckman  as red as a cherry the juice the best in the world is extracted from the tree and the color tried by rubbing it on paper The natives bring it in drops wrapped in leaves but are so apt to adulterate it that we do not chuse to purchase without previous examination  ANOTHER kind is procured from the  Gladiolus Odoratus Indicus Rumph  v p tab For further accounts I must refer to that  Pliny  of the  Indies  in the places cited to vol ii p and to  Kaempfer  to The drug from whatsoever tree or plant it be gotten maintains its place in our dispensatory  AT times a considerable quantity of gold has been brought here  GOLD  which is found in the mines in the interior parts of the country Some is melted into bars and usually adulterated by a  cover of base metal The natives have a very just notion of the lord of the  irritamenta malorum  for they say that the devil is sole master of the gold and diamond mines  DIAMONDS form another article of commerce  DIAMONDS  but they are far less valuable than those of  Golconda  BEESWAX  BEESWAX  in cakes of about thirtyfour pounds is common at  Sambas  which being the common money of that part of the island was wont to be bartered with the  Chinese  for various necessaries Pearls of considerable beauty are said to be another article of exchange in the same country  THE bezoar found in the monkies has a most superstitious value  BEZOAR  and is sold for four or five times its weight in silver  THE unrefined camphor of  Borneo  CAMPHOR  is reckoned superior to any in the world We are not acquainted with the tree which produces that valuable drug  THE edible swallows nests are found in vast abundance  EDIBLE NESTS  and the  Bambu  walking canes form two other articles of trade  IN the list of quadrupeds is the  Ourang Outang  OURANG OUTANG  there appears to be two species one that never exceeds two feet and an half in height see Mr  Vosmaer  's account p tab xiv xv and  Hist Quad  i p tab which I have taken the liberty of copying from M  Vosmaer  Mr  Beeckman  speaks of some species growing to the height of six feet he bought a young one which was stronger than any man in his ship but it died before it was a year old  Borneo  has abundance of these animals It swarms also with variety of baboons and monkies so this  Celebes  and another island may probably have been the  insulae Satyrorum  of  Ptolemy  THE  Ourang Outang  is found also in  Java Hamilton  Account of the  East Indies  ii p  saw one in that island which was four feet high and mentions a smaller species called  Oumpaes  He confirms the account of the grave or melancholy habit of the greater species of its lighting a fire and blowing it with its mouth and of its broiling a fish to eat with its boiled rice imitative of the custom of the human race  THE aborigines of  Borneo  are called  Byajos  BYAJOS  they inhabit the interior parts live under chieftains and are an independent people possessing their proper language and religion the last is called  Paganism  yet they pay no respect to idols but offer sacrifices of sweet scented wood to one supreme beneficent Deity who in other worlds rewards the just and punishes the wicked They marry only one wife are strictly faithful to their nuptial vows and have the character of general honesty Mr  Beeckman  makes a different report but fairly confesses that he received it from the  Banjareens  who will not suffer the  Europeans  to have any intercourse with the natives and tell many frightful tales of their barbarity The  Byajos  often come down the river to the port of  Masseen  in ill shaped praws with gold dust diamonds rattans bezoar and other articles of commerce of which the  Banjareens  are sole factors and consequently highly interested in keeping the pretended savages from our knowlege  THE  Byajos  are taller and stronger than the other inhabitants they go naked excepting a small wrapper about their loins  they stain their bodies with blue and by weights affixed to their ears when young stretch them till they fall on their shoulders The chieftains pull out their fore teeth and substitute others of gold and by way of ornament fling strings of tigers teeth round their necks and bodies Their arms are lances and poisoned arrows some of them lead a piratical life in the great rivers and are most formidable enemies  LET me here observe that tigers  TIGERS  those cruel animals swarm in this island beyond which they happily cease nor are they known in any of the islands to the north or to the east of  Borneo  AFTER navigating along the northern coast of the island we arrive  SAMBAAR POINT  in Lat ° ′ on the point of  Sambaar  Between this and the isle of  Billetou  to the west is a channel of a hundred and fifty miles in breadth Near to the west of that island is the small isle of  Salt  ISLAND OF SALT AND BANCA  and then the isle of  Banca  all belonging to  Java  FROM  Sambaar  point the coast turns towards the north In Lat  SUCCADANA AND SAMBAS  ° ′ south is  Succadana  and in Lat ° north is  Sambas  both at times frequented for the sake of commerce From  Tanjong  point the island trends to the northeast The city of  Borneo  stands in about Lat  CITY OF BORNEO  ° ′ north on a large river in the bottom of a bay  WHEN the famous navigator  Von Noort  was there in it consisted of three thousand houses all built on posts and floating planks in the manner we have described so that whenever the sultan chose to change his position he would move with all his city to another part of the river  Von Noort  found this port  much frequented by the  Chinese  who to this day seem to be the greatest and most constant traders to  Borneo  of all the  Asiatic  nations  FROM Lat ° north to  Tangio Sampanmangco  the most northern promontory of  Borneo  in Lat ° the coast changes its nature being skirted all the way with a lofty chain of mountains and within are appearances of others of very uncertain extent that northern headland has another correspondent called  Inorantang  facing likewise the north between both is the deep bay of  Malbordoo  penetrating far to the south opposite to the last headland is the small island of  Banguey  ISLAND OF BANGUEY  lofty and mountanous as if rent from it by some violent convulsions  A LITTLE to the west of that island in Lat ° ′  ISLAND OF BALAMBANGAM  is the isle  Balambangan  composed of sand and swamps and famous for the intention of the  East India  company in to form on it a vast  emporium  of the commodities of  China  and of all this great eastern archipelago We got the cession of this little spot then uninhabited from the king of  Soolo  we took possession of it at a vast expence according to  Raynal  Hist vol ii p  it cost us £ A company of  European  troops and a number of  Seapoys  were detained for the protection of the settlement and a colony of  Malayes  from  Bencoolen  and another of  Chinese  were induced to establish themselves there We could not have fixed on a more unwholesome situation the diseases of the climate attacked both the military and the colonists and very few survived the sickly season so that scarcely one in ten outlived the monsoon the  Abbe Raynal  asserts that we were attacked and the factory destroyed and insinuates it  to have been done by the instigation of the  Dutch  or  Spaniards  jealous of their commercial interests in that neighborhood  AT a small distance to the north  MANILLA I  AN  S  about Lat ° begins the vast group of the  Philippine  islands these are much more probably the  Maniolae  of  Ptolemy  than the lesser  Andaman  which  D'Anville  supposes it to have been These islands were known to the antients by the  Indian  name which is still retained in  Manilla Ptolemy  speaks of them as ten islands immediately beyond the  tres insulae Satyrorum  or  Borneo  c They were first discovered by the great  Magellan  who came in sight of them on  April  th and named them the  Archipelago  of  St Lazarus  He landed on one of them called  Mactan  near to  Zebu  where acording to  Pigafetta  a companion and eye witness he with eight or nine of his men was slain in an encounter with the natives  THE discovery of these islands was completed in  WHEN DISCOVERED  by a  Spaniard  of the name of  Ruy Lopez de Villalobos  who named them the  Philippine  in honor of  Philip  prince of  Spain  afterwards  Philip  II We chuse to retain the antient name the  Manillas  THE first settlement made by the  Spaniards  in these islands was not till the year when  Michael Lopez de Lagaspi  built a town in the isle of  Zebu  ZEBU  He secured it by a small garrison and then proceeded to the conquest of other islands more worthy of his arms He sailed into a fine bay in the island of  Manilla  or  Luconia  ISLAND OF LUCONIA  and was in the founder of the city of  Manilla  so celebrated for its opulence and for being the common repository and place of exchange of the productions of both the  Indies  one may also say those of the old and the new world of  Europe  of  India  and of  China  and in return it receives the silver of  Potosi  The indolence of the  Spaniards  will not suffer these islands to produce any one article of commerce  GOLD  a little gold excepted brought down the sloods into the channels of the rivers The group certainly contains rich mines of the pretious metal but as wealth flows in such abundance with very little trouble to the colonists they will not be at the pains of exploring the veins  Luconia  also produces abundance of excellent iron and copper  THE fruitfulness of soil is a perpetual reproach to the slothfulness of its lords A very few exceptions are to be found one friend to the island introduced the  Coco tree Theobroma cacao Catesby  Suppl tab which is cultivated with such success as to become almost the support of the inhabitants by giving them the favorite food of the  Spaniards  chocolate indigo  INDICO  which grows spontaneously owes of late years its use in their manufactories to the sagacity of an individual It was not till the year that the sluggish  Spaniards  ever knew the culture of  European  grains or esculents As to the native productions it possesses every tree or fruit common to the torrid zone and numbers probably peculiar to itself few only of which are brought to view and that by the industry of a  Sonnerat  THE unwise expulsion of the Jesuits will long retard possibly for ever prevent the improvement of the  Manilla  islands The domains of that intelligent order were covered with cattle innumerable their meadows stretched numbers of miles watered and fertilized by the rivers of the country  Manilla  CITY OF MANILLA  by being the mere repository of the goods of other nations grew into a most flourishing city the streets regular the churches and publick buildings superb A splendid luxury pervades every part in the appearance of dress and equipage and inside of the houses of the proud and lazy colonists  THE port of  Manilla  is at  Cavite  three leagues distant and is subject to many inconveniences being greatly infested with the worm the  teredo navalis  which in a little time would render the galleons and the vessels which trade to  Manilla  incapable of keeping the sea neither is it secure from the north and northwest winds besides ships lying there are obliged to send far for water and to employ for that purpose the flat boats of the country  THE city of  Manilla  is fortified well built and the streets very regular but the third part is occupied by convents the number of christians is computed at about twelve thousand  Gomez Peres de las Marignas  surrounded it with walls in  IT is from hence the great commerce between  Manilla  and  Acapulco  ACAPULCO SHITS  on the coast of  Mexico  is carried on in one and sometimes in two ships sent annually fitted out at the expence of the king but freighted by the merchants They are of an enormous size heavy and unwieldy as big as a first rate man of war and having a complement of twelve hundred men the lesser is above twelve hundred tons burden has from three hundred and fifty to six hundred hands passengers included and carries fifty guns but often mounts only thirtysix It leaves  Manilla  the middle of  July  but does not reach  Acapulco  till the middle of  January  One miracle of this voyage is that notwithstanding they put on  board all the water they can stow consistent with the full cargo they depend for a supply from the heavens between Lat ° and ° and hazard the most dreadful of deaths should their expectations be disappointed when they arrive in these latitudes they prepare their mats which they spread to direct the deluge of rain into various vessels and wonderful to say there is not an instance in which their hopes have failed  Manilla  is the great magazine of all the goods of  India China  and  Europe  which are laid up here annually to be conveyed across the  Pacific  ocean to supply the wants or luxuries of the new world "There are" as the editor of lord  Anson  's voyage informs us at p  spices all sorts of  Chinese  silks and manufactures particularly silk stockings of which I have heard that no less than fifty thousand pair were the usual number shipped on board the annual ship vast quantities of  Indian  stuffs as callicoes and chintz which are much worn in  America  together with minuter articles as goldsmiths work c which is principally done at the city of  Manilla  itself by the  Chinese  for it is said there are at least twenty thousand  Chinese  who constantly reside there either as servants manufacturers or brokers all these different commodities are collected at  Manilla  thence to be transported annually in one or more ships to the port of  Acapuico  in the kingdom of  Mexico  THE return from the new world is only in silver either in specie or virgin metal the author of Lord  Anson  's voyage confesses to only pieces of eight and ounces of virgin silver or £ of our money having been sound in  the  Manilla  ship out of which the family have realized their vastestate Even when the ship arrives safe the treasure is of little advantage to the  Spaniards  it is instantly dispersed over half the world to pay for the merchandize of its outward voyage  THE city of  Manilla  was besieged and taken by the  English  in  MANILLA    Our little squadron under vice admiral  Cornish  appeared before it on  September  d our land forces were under colonel  Draper  after a short resistance the city was taken by storm with as little slaughter as the nature of circumstances would admit The island of  Luconia  and every island dependent on it surrendered to our arms a large sum was accepted to save the place from plunder hostages given for the payment and bills drawn by the archbishop or viceroy which in part were never accepted and our soldiers and seamen deprived of the reward due to their valor  THIS archipelago consists of about twelve or thirteen greater islands with small ones innumerable divided from each other by narrow channels of very difficult navigation all of them mountanous and many of them volcanic  Manilla  the largest and most northern is a hundred and fifteen  French  leagues in length not reckoning the peninsula of  Camarines  which juts irregularly from the main body and extends far to the south  Raynal  represents all the islands as terribly majestic They are covered with  basaltes  with  lava  with  scoriae  with black glass with melted iron with grey and friable stones filled with the wrecks of the animal and vegetable kingdoms with sulphur kept in a state of fusion by the continual action of subterraneous fires and  with burning waters which communicate with hidden flames All these great accidents of nature are the effect of extinguished volcanoes of some that are still burning and of others that are forming in these deep cavities where combustible materials are perpetually in agitation  EARTHQUAKES are frequent and sometimes tremendous  EARTHQUAKES  Mr  Pye  in the Philosophical Transactions  Vol xlix p  gives an account of one of uncommon horror in which lasted for three months with almost continual tremblings and at last broke out in an eruption from a small island in the middle of a lake round which the bottom is unfathomable The third day after the commencement of the eruption there arose four more small islands all burning and about a mile distance from one there is a continual fire which issues from the water where there is no ground for upwards of an hundred fathoms deep  IT is generally supposed that before the arrival of the  Europeans  the  Chinese  had possessed themselves of the sea coasts of these islands The  Japanese  also boast of having been once lords of the  Philippines  and the vicinity to both those empires may make it probable  THE  Chinese  were so numerous in  Manilla  about the year  CHINESE    as to excite in the  Spaniards  the greatest fear of the danger arising from any plots they might enter into against the colonists The  Spaniards  assisted by the  Japanese  and other foreigners took the usual method of preventing them by putting no less than twentyfive thousand to the sword the massacre of these people was far greater than that of  Batavia  The  Spaniards  assert that the  Chinese  had actually begun to revolt and had murdered several of the  Europeans  The  Chinese  charge the horrible transaction on the  Europeans  and say it was excited by their avarice in order to make themselves masters of the rich effects of their countrymen The emperor sent an embassador to demand satisfaction and spoke in high terms of the revenge he would take all ended by a pacification the  Chinese  fleets resorted to  Manilla  in as great a number as ever and the suburbs were soon repeopled with inhabitants The wealth that we are told the  Chinese  brought into the islands was unspeakable The Jesuits were expelled the country in and in the year following by the bigotry of the governor every one of the  Chinese  were banished from the  Philippine  islands since which trade and the arts have declined and depopulation and distress promise to be the consequences of so imprudent a measure  IN the mountanous parts of the islands are remnants of the original inhabitants  NATIVES  a most singular race of men who through an excessive love of liberty have relapsed into a state of nature Those who inhabit the foot of a mountain are mortal enemies to those that reside at the top and both are equally hated by those who live in the middle happy picture of enthusiastic independency They are seen wandering singly amidst the woods armed with bows and arrows naked excepting the skin of a goat flung over their shoulders they lodge in hollow trees or hollows of the rocks have no notion of society and like the primaeval inhabitants of the world  Venerem incertam rapientes more serarum  THESE men are strongly made  CURLED HEADED INDIANS  of haggard countenances black  with curled hair like the negroes and called by the  Spaniards Negrillos  They certainly are of the same race as the  Papuans  or people of  New Guinea  who might originally have spread themselves over this tract These curled headed tribes are found in most of the other islands  Navarette  mentions other black  Indians  the men paint themselves with white the women with other colors These and other  Indian  people often descend on the  Spanish  settlements and commit horrible murders Some of them like the antient  Scythians  make drinking cups of the sculls of their enemies  THERE are other  Indians  that profess a sort of dependency on the  Spaniards  and have an  Alcayde  among them yet their manners are barbarous they are brave but ferocious and appear to have been descended from the  Malayans  settled here in very early times They are called  Tagalese  and the  Negrillos  pretend that they had been originally their slaves Their arms are bows and arrows they took part with the  Spaniards  during the siege of the capital and ignorant of the laws of nations slew in the most savage manner our admiral's secretary carrying a flag of truce and even the nephew of the  Spanish  Governor who attempted to rescue him from their fury The strength of their arms was satally experienced by that gallant officer major  More  who fell transfixed by an arrow in leading our troops to the storm  I SHALL now mention a few particulars respecting the natural history of the  Manillas  NATURAL HISTORY  It is not to be wondered that in one so abundant in volcanoes there should be found springs of hot water The most noted is that which appears two leagues from  Calamba  the stream which runs from it is of a boiling heat and raised the liquor in M  de Reaumur  's thermometer to the height of degrees even at the distance of a league from the source M  Sonnerat  observed five shrubs the roots of which were drenched by the stream and the top enveloped in the vapor yet grew with vigor At the same time the swallows which happened to skim the brook at the height of seven or eight feet from the surface fell down motionless  THE  Bashee  islands lie midway between  Manilla  and  Formosa  BASHEE ISLANDS  the middlemost of them is according to Lord  Anson  in Lat ° ′ north I speak of them here notwithstanding they belong to neither one or the other  Dampier  in the year being engaged in these seas in a buccaneering expedition wished for a temporary concealment He had seen in certain charts the figure V which denoted their number  Dampier's voyage i  He sailed to the spot and found them to correspond in position and number None of them had names so he bestowed on them those of  Orange Grafton Monmouth Goat  and  Bashee  the last from a sort of beer made of the boiled juice of the sugar cane and some small black berries which was put into jars to settle and was thought by our seamen an excellent liquor capable of giving the pleasure of ebriety without the bad effects The natives sold it to them in plenty for which reason they made it the general name of the islands  Monmouth  and  Grafton  isles are very lofty  SINGULAR VILLAGES  with a numerous succession of precipices one above another On these the natives build their villages which affords the singular prospect  of three or four rows of small houses erected on posts and wattled with boughs They have no other way of getting to their habitations but by a ladder which is pulled up after them if they mean to ascend to the upper villages or to secure themselves from an assault These two islands are the most populous as they have more of these precipices  Bashee  island has but one precipice and in consequence only one town  Orange  is lofty yet so plain as to furnish no spot sitted for the site of their villages and is therefore uninhabited  THE produce of these islands are a few of the tropical fruits  PRODUCE  pine apples sugar canes plantains bananas calabashes yams and potatoes These are planted in the vallies which are well watered with small streams they are also well wooded but the trees do not grow to any large size Their animals are hogs and goats in plenty their poultry sew among the wild fowl parroquets and some other small birds  THE natives are short and squat round visaged  NATIVES  with low foreheads and thick eyebrows short low noses eyes small and hazel but larger than those of the  Chinese  lips and mouth of a middle size hair black thick lank and cut short so as just to cover the ears The description of these people agrees so exactly with that of the  Japanese  given by  Kaempfer  Hist of Japan i p  that there cannot be any doubt of their origin  THEIR government is quite patriarchal  GOVERNMENT  their religion has no exterior rites but probably is mental as is common with many orientalists There is no appearance of idols on any of their islands They certainly have laws for  Dampier  saw the crime of thest punished in a young man who was buried alive in the  presence of a great multitude assembled on the occasion Their manners were innoffensive friendly and honest not only among themselves but to the new visitants who possibly were the first  Europeans  they had seen  IN general the men went naked excepting the usual wrapper about their loins some had jackets of plantain leaves the rudest says  Dampier  of all clothing The women had a strong thick short petticoat of cotton made of the lesser cotton plant the product of their own isles Both sexes wore large earrings of a yellow metal which was found in their mountains it was heavy and  GOLD  like the paler gold it faded with time but the natives restored it to its original brightness by smearing it over with a red earth and flinging it into a fire till it was red hot Our navigator had no means of proving whether it was gold  To the women was left the care of the plantations  BOATS  The men were engaged in fishing they built with much skill their small boats which resembled the  Deal  yawls formed of very narrow planks fastened with pins and nails They had also larger boats which carried forty or fifty men and were rowed by twelve or fourteen oars on a si  e It seems as if they went to the island of  Manilla  for their iron which they manufactured at home  ARMS  From thence they get their other only import pieces of buffaloes hides with which they make their defensive armor or buff coats their sole offensive weapons are lances headed with iron all this implies the fear of enemies and makes it probable that they are subject to the attacks of the piratical  Indians  AFTER this digression  MANILLAS AGAIN  let me return to the great group of the  Manillas  The island of  Mindora  lies south of that of  Manilla  and  is very lofty and mountanous many of the natives pay tribute to the  Spaniards Sonnerat  Voyage aux Indes ii  says that most voyagers assert that there is a race of men in this island which have tails the same is feigned of certain people in  Borneo  but the fact turns out that they happen to have the  Os Coccygis  a little more elongated than is usual in the human species  SOUTH of  Mindora  is the cluster of small isles called the  Calamianes  with others still smaller to the east of them  CALAMIANES  The island of  Paragua  stretches from the  Calamianes  near seventy leagues in length and at the southern end approaches the isles of  Balambangan  off the coast of  Borneo  The  Spaniards  have here some tributary  Indians  part of the island is said to be subject to a sultan in  Borneo  ALL these islands form the western boundary of a great gulph  GREAT CENTRAL BAY IN THE MIDST OF THE MANILLAS  The rest of the  Manillas  and the  Soolo Archipelago  are on the north and east sides the end of  Borneo  is on the south A few small isles are scattered over the middle To go on with the farther account of the island  Manduque Masbate  and numbers of small isles fill the part next to  Luconia  or  Manilla Samal  a large island faces the ocean on their outside to the east Its promontory  El Spirito santo  is remarkable by the capture of the rich  Manilla  ship by lord  Anson  it being the first of the islands which those vessels make in their course from  Acapulco  to their port of  Manilla  PANAYBUGLAS or isle of  Negros Zebu  and  Leyte  PANAY  with the lesser isle of  Bohol  range nearly east and west parallel to each other a little to the south of the preceding The principal settlements  of the  Spaniards  are  HoHo  and  Antigue  in the island of  Panay  but off  Antigue  is the sole anchorage and that only in the months of  November December  and  January  The inhabitants of this island are infinitely more industrious than those of  Luconia  they have a manufactory of handkerchiefs and a sort of linen composed of cotton and the fibres of a certain plant of the country they clothe themselves with the coarser kinds and dispose of the rest among the neighboring isles This island is most exuberantly fertile and very populous some authors make the numbers of inhabitants to exceed sixteen thousand and assert that there are fourteen parishes belonging to the monks of St  Augustine  three benefices of seculars and formerly a college of Jesuits Notwithstanding the happy soil of  Panay  the inhabitants are discouraged from taking advantage of that blessing by reason of the neglect of the government which leaves them unprotected against the depredations of the piratical  Malayes  who land plunder and carry away prisoners all those who cannot escape into the woods These pirates are  Mahometans  of  Borneo Mindanao  and other islands between the  Manillas  and the  Moluccas  They infest the coasts to a high degree and will carry away people almost from under the walls of the capital and sell them for slaves in  Borneo  and even in  Batavia  They not only seize the smaller fishing vessels but even ships richly laden  THE country abounds with deer  ANIMALS  wild hogs buffaloes oxen and horses the two last run at liberty and are common to the whole island  ZEBU is a small island  ZEBU  but remarkable for having been the  first which the  Spaniards  colonized It is pretended that there were at the time the  Europeans  arrived three thousand families of warlike  Indians  The  Spaniards  have had wherever they came a happy talent in reducing the redundancy of people  HERE in  Philip  erected the town built by  Logaspi  into a city and dignified it with an episcopal foundation an  Augustine Pietro de Agurto  first filled the see This island was indulged with sending ships to  Calao  in  Peru  but after the  Spaniards  had made the conquest of  Luconia  and given to its capital the privilege of the  Manilla  ships the trade of  Zebu  declined fast insomuch that its city is now sunk into a village The passage from hence to the new world was far more expeditious than that from  Manilla  having been performed in two months and the return in three and seldom without the discovery of some islands in the vast Pacific  WE have before said that on  Matta  or  Mactan  MACTAN  or possibly the  Masbate  of modern maps a small adjacent island  Magellan  like his illustrious compeer  Cook  met with a premature death from the hands of savages  THE island of  Mindanao  or  Magindanao  ISLE OF MINDANAO  is the last and most southern of the great group Many writers separate  Mindanao  from the  Manilla  or  Philippine  islands among others our judicious countryman Mr  Dalrymple  Though so very near as evidently to form one of that vast archipelago the inhabitants may differ in manners but the productions of all are nearly similar The  Spaniards  have on it some unprofitable settlements the chief is at  Sambouange  in Lat ° ′ N on the south side of the island They have fortified it with a citadel of stone and bricks  and with a wooden fort erected to check the excursion of the corsairs of  Yolo  but in vain they cannot even protect their own subjects who happen to be out of the reach of their cannon  THE island extends east and west about ninety leagues  EXTENT  is triangular and the shores greatly indented by bays the circumference is said to be about eight hundred miles It is very mountanous the vallies consist of a rich soil black fat prodigiously fruitful and finely watered with the purest rills the sides of the mountains rocky yet well clothed with trees of large growth The beauty of scenery in various parts is unspeakable we are obliged to Mr  Forrest  for giving us some idea of it in his Voyage to  New Guinea  in plate is a view of  Tetyan  harbor of  Labugan  and of the circular harbor of  Ubal  in the isle of  Bunwoot  on the east side of the bay of  Illano  near the great island  Mindanao  is inhabited by several different nations  NATIVES  speaking various languages governed by sultans or rajahs Mr  Forrest  and our faithful voyager  Dampier  give accurate accounts of the manners of the country  HARAFORAS  but particularly the first The  Haraforas  the primitive people now driven into the interior parts are highly taxed and oppressed by the  Mahometan  nations who possess the coasts  Dampier  Voyages vol i p  describes what he names the  Mindanayans  properly so called as men of mean stature small limbs strait bodies little heads oval faces flat foreheads small black eyes short low noses pretty large mouths thin red lips black teeth black strait hair tawny skins inclining more to brighter yellow than other  Indians  and adds that they are of good understanding ingenious and active when they chuse to exert themselves otherwise like all other  Indians  extremely indolent  stately in their gait but very civil to strangers vindictive and given to the crime of poisoning The dresses of the inhabitants is given in one of Mr  Forrest  's plates representing the nuptials of two young people of rank  THE capital town is on the great bay of  Illano  on the south side of the island in Lat ° ′ the houses even the palace are supported on posts from fourteen to twenty feet high to keep them clear of the water in the season of inundations Captain  Forrest  in his Voyage to  New Guinea  P  mentions the  Lano  a great lake far inland  LANO LAKE  it is about sixty miles in circumference and in one place some hundred fathoms deep in others ten twenty and thirty has four islands and abounds with fish The inhabitants of its banks are called  Illanos  and amount to thirty thousand intermixed with  Haraforas  all of whom are said to be very much civilized  IN mentioning the productions of this archipelago  PRODUCTIONS  I shall just distinguish the few that with great uncertainty are thought peculiar to  Mindanao  Gold is common to all It has its saltpetre cave from which much of that article is extracted on the roofs are infinite clusters of small bats the dung of which is supposed to be one cause of the salt a brook of a most offensive taste and smell and of a sky blue color issues from the mountain which incloses the cavern  THESE islands seem to produce all the animals common to those adjacent with the addition of an ugly hog  QUADRUPEDS  with great knobs over the eyes evidently my  Aethiopian Boar  Hist Quad i N  o  numerous in the woods and very lean but sweet  THE  Civet Weesel  i N  o  The species which

acquainted with only the head  Dampier  Voyages i p  mentions a  Manatee  which does not weigh above six hundred weight but he commends the flesh as being very sweet  THE Birds are all enumerated in the  Faunula  of my  Indian Zoology  BIRDS  and may be known by their trivial names and references to M  Sonnerat  yet I shall mention a few distinguished by beauty or any striking property  THE  White Turtle Sonnerat  Voy  N Guinea  tab is of a most glossy whiteness with a bloodred spot on the breast as if it had received a stab in that part The  Quail  of  Luconia  tab is the least of the genus being only four inches long  THE  Shrike  tab flies swiftly in the air and can balance itself like a swallow is an inveterate enemy to the raven which it never fails to attack and in the end to put to flight  THE  Antique Shrike  tab is singular for the great hook of its upper mandible hanging far over the lower  Parrots  are very numerous and of various species they enliven the woods with their brilliant colors and deafen people by their cries  THE  Jacana  tab is most remarkable not only by the vast length of toes and claws characters of the genus but by the  three slender shafts issuing from the greater feathers of each wing and extending to the tail and finished with webs like other feathers  THE bird called by M  Sonnerat  p tab  Le Paon Sauvage de l'isle de Lucon  is evidently a plover the bill is long a little thicker near the point on the head is a very long crest passing horizontal far beyond the hind part of the head and ending in a point things naked far above the knee it has only three toes and those are nearly semipalmated crest head neck and breast bright grey barred with black the top of the crest quite black belly white back wings and tail plain brown length from the tip of the tail to the end three feet M  Sonnerat  says that this species is found near the Cape of  Good Hope  but surely he mistakes the  Umbre Brown  's  Illustr  tab for this bird  Le Secretaire  tab  Latham  i p tab that singular vulture a compound of many genera is found here as well as in the Cape of  Good Hope  THE  crested Spoonbill  tab has its head ornamented with a large crest beginning a little beyond the bill and falling behind the head in a great bush the feathers have unconnected webs like the plumes of the  Egrets  IN  Panay  is a very small  Thrush  tab not bigger than our  Hedge Sparrow  of a most beautiful violet color blue and black all changeable it has a most charming note for which reason it is called the  musician  they live in flocks of thousands and make their nests in the pigeonhouses  THE  Coliou  tab and the crested  Coliou  of  Panay  tab  are distinguished by the vast length of their tails that of the first strait of the other

bill convex at the top and in front one third black the hind part white this bird is as large as a great fowl and the beak nine inches long  THE  Manilla Hornbill Latham  i  Pl Enl  has a simple bill the head neck breast and belly are white beneath the cheek is a black spot back and wings black  THE above and two species hereafter to be mentioned are natives of these islands and of the  Moluccas  their food is fruit they inhabit the highest trees and are the grotesque birds of the  Indian  archipelagos  RESPECTING the trees  PLANTS  shrubs or plants of the  Manillas  I must content myself with giving the few engraven by M  Sonnerat  or described by that most industrious naturalist  THE  Sapotte Negro  tab a species of  Achras  is a small tree with a round green fruit containing four kernels in shape of an almond much admired by the  Indians  THE  Berkias  tab is a shrub bearing a flower of an elegant form  Sonnerat  puts it under the genus of the  Pandequaqua  a barbarous name The  Chiococca Racemosa Linn Suppl  p a lesser species is a milky plant see tab the juice of which is used by the  Indians  for healing their wounds The larger bears an oval fruit full of seed tab  Le Rocou  or  Atchiote  is a shrub with a small pointed fruit covered with bristles containing numbers of seeds which give a beautiful red dye  THE  Ignatia amara Linn Suppl  p which produces the beans of St  Ignatius  of superstitious use grows in these islands  THE  Cocoa tree  tab  Theobroma cacao  COCOA TREE  I imagine that  Linnaeus  must have been a great admirer of chocolate as he names the tree which produces it  Theobroma  or the food of the  Gods  This tree is a native of the  Antilles  and hotter parts of  South America  and has been introduced into these islands by the  Spaniards  from the great fondness that nation has for its produce otherwise they would not have given themselves any trouble about a less favored tree  THE celebrated  bread fruit  Outlines of the Globe i p E

about  Bantam  and in  Malega  and finally in all the islands to the east and from thence to  Otahcite  and many others in the South Sea  Dampier  i first discovered it in  Guam  one of the  Ladrone  islands and gives a very faithful description of the fruit and its uses Lord  Anson  and his great follower  Cook  are full of its praises Of late years we caught the benevolent idea of transporting this tree of life to our own islands captain  Bligh  had the honor of being the person deputed to convey this manna to our wretched negroes A Satan counteracted under the feigned form and name of the most beneficent of sects this great benefit to our hardfated brethren like his great prototype he succeeded in the onset but the adventure is resumed under the auspices of the same faithful leader and I hope that I do not make a false prophecy if I presage success  THIS fruit is the bread of the islands on which it has been bestowed it grows on a tree of the size of a middling oak and to the bulk of a child's head and even to the diameter of twelve inches  Rumphius  distinguishes the varieties into  Granosus Lanosus  and  Soccosus  the first is the parent tree and has in it seeds  John Reinhold Forster  plate a gives us an idea of the whole fruit with the rind hexagonally reticulated the majority have no seeds as we find is often the case with the  Barberry  and a few other fruits these therefore are incapable of propagation except by suckers In the generality of the islands the seeded sort is quite lost the other kind cultivated in orchards The account of the fruit as given by  Dampier abnormis sapiens  is worthy the reader's attention  When it is ripe it is yellow and soft and the taste is sweet and pleasant the natives of this island use it for bread they gather it when full grown while it is green and hard then they bake it in an oven which scorcheth the rind and makes it black but they scrape off the outside black crust  and there remains a tender thin crust and the inside of it soft tender and white like the crumbs of a penny loaf There is neither seed nor stone in the inside but all is of a pure substance like bread it must be eaten new for if it is kept above twentyfour hours it becomes dry and eats harsh and choaky but it is very pleasant before it is too stale This fruit lasts in season eight months in the year during which time the natives eat no other sort of food of bread kind  THE fruit which M  Sonnerat  p calls  Le Rima ou fruit a pain  and which he has engaven in tab and is the perfect fruit or  soccus granosus  Just beneath the rind is a series of large almondlike kernels adhering to a central placenta and of a farinaceous substance which when roasted eat like chesnuts The fruit itself is large and spherical the natives of the  Philippines  cut it into slices dry and eat it like bread it will keep two years This is the variety Mr  Ellis  calls the  Ducdu  and seems to make it a separate species  A MINUTE orange tab  ORANGE  resembling the  Citrus trifoliata  of  Linnaeus  is found here the fruit is very small of a bright red color It has no sections but only one lodgment for the seeds The pulp is slightly acid and very agreeable It may be the  Ssi  or  Karatas Banna  of the  Japanese Kaempf Amoen Ex    Thunberg Fl Japon    IN  Mindanao  are found three fruits engraven by M  Sonnerat  the  Manssanus  or  Masson  tab resembling a  Jujube  tree the leaves are alternate the fruit a berry covering a hard kernel containing two nuts of a green color  THE next is the  Menichea rosata  tab The fruit is between  two and three inches long oval and containing a large nut  THE third is  La Houette  tab a very lofty tree  BETWEEN the south end of  Mindanao  SOOLO ISLES  and the northeast point of  Borneo  is a chain of small isles extending about two hundred miles in length called the  Soolo  from the name of the chief island The principal was about the middle of this century governed by a sultan according to M  Sonnerat  the very counterpart of  Peter  the Great endowed with the same abilities the same thirst after knowlege and the same ambition of applying it to the improvement of his subjects Like  Peter  he quitted his throne and took to travelling during several years He went afterwards to  Batavia  where he concealed his name and quality and associated himself with the common sailors to learn their business He next changed his company for that of the carpenters to be instructed in their art He bought tools of all sorts and instruments of husbandry and then returned to his throne Still he wished for more intellectual improvement sailed for  Mecca  to learn the law of  Mahomet  made himself master of the  Arabic  tongue brought home the use of letters and introduced money the first ever known in the islands  THIS monarch obtained possession by conquest of a small part of  Borneo  next to his dominions which involved him in a quarrel with some  Dutch  who pretended they were allies to the  Bornoese  Our prince found he never could be a match for these people without the use of firearms He fitted out a few ships loaded them with articles of commerce and sailed to  Manilla  in  order to supply his wants The rapacious governor seized on the monarch and all his treasure under pretence that he intended the conquest of the island The sultan remonstrated in vain he endured a long captivity his subjects enraged at the treatment their prince had met with made horrible ravages on the coasts of  Luconia  The governor did not dare to complain as he knew his court would not approve his conduct He stipulated with the prince that he would restore him to liberty provided he would consent to establish in his dominions a mission of Jesuits He refused to comply the Jesuits determined on revenge and conquest obtained an armament and taking the  Soolo  monarch sailed for  Sambouange  and from thence to  Soolo  where they landed and laid siege to the only fort on the island The warriors of  Soolo  surprised them and drove them with disgrace to their ships At  Sambouange  he found means to escape on board an  English  vessel which conveyed him to  Soolo  his subjects crowded to him and he remounted his throne to the great joy of his people he ceded a small island to the  English  and declared his ports open to all piratical adventurers to encourage them to revenge his cause on the treacherous  Spaniards  Mr  Forrest  visited this island and found there an  English  factor it was then governed by  Israel  son of the captive sultan who had received his education at  Manilla  MR  Dalrymple  visited these islands and left us some account of their natural history they are particularly rich in pearls  PEARLS  the banks on which the different shells are found containing those gems are of great extent the pearl is not confined to one species of shell Mr  Dalrymple  describes several but as he does not do it  scientifically I am at a loss to define the kinds excepting the  Mytilus Margaritiferus  every one of these shells have in them two small lobsters to which the  Indians  attribute the formation of the pearls The banks were once private property and belonged to several individuals but by the  Mahometan  law they are now common even to strangers The divers are slaves to the sultan they seem to be hired out and to receive a certain portion for their share  Pigafetta  the companion of  Magellan  in his circumnavigation visited these islands in He calls  Soolo Zolo  and says from report  Purchas i  that two pearls had been taken there the property of the king of  Borneo  which were round and as big as hens' eggs  THE swallows with edible nests swarm here they build in caves open at top but with their sides communicating with the sea beneath its surface The nests are got by divers who plunge through the entrance and rise within the vast caverns which are inaccessible from above  THE  Upas  or poison tree is found in  Soolo  MR  ANIMALS  Foorest  has given us a brief account of the animals the  Soolos  have plenty of horses which the ladies of fashion have learned to ride with much grace Here are abundance of goats and cattle but the people do not milk the cows wild hogs swarm and with the wild elephant do great mischief The elephants are not aboriginal but bred from some that had been sent as presents to the  Soolo  princes The  Spotted Deer  or  Axis  is found here  Soolo  is thirty miles long and twelve broad  LENGTH OF SOOLO  and very populous  which obliges the inhabitants to have recourse to agriculture in a far greater degree than others of the adjacent isles the whole chain is said to have sixty thousand inhabitants the soil is very fertile and productive of most of the tropical fruits  teek  trees abound here The rainy season is very uncertain for which reason the crops of rice cannot be depended on yams potatoes and other esculents are cultivated to supply the defect The natives have learned the art of engrafting from the  Chinese  settled among them Mr  Forrest  says that the cinnamon tree is found amongst these islands  THE  Soolos  are a polished people  NATIVES  probably from the examples of their two monarchs both sexes dress with elegance they are fond of music and dancing Sultan  Israel  and his niece could perform a tolerable minuet and some of the people of fashion could go down a country dance They have many slaves to whom they are said to be very cruel and besides are reckoned perfidious in their general dealings  ANOTHER chain of islands  SANGIR  of far greater length than the former runs from the western cape of  Mindanao  quite to the most eastern cape of the great island of  Celebes  the chief of which is  Sangujan  or  Sangir  between Lat ° ′ and ° ′ north most of them are inhabited and governed by their chieftains  Forrest p  The  Dutch  have now possession of  Sangir  and some others as outguards to the  spicy  isles These part of  Mindanao  the  Soolo  isles  Borneo  and  Celebes  bound a great and open gulph of clear navigation  Celebes  or  Macassar  extends north and south between Lat  CELEBES OR MACASSAR  °  ′ north and Lat ° ′ south it is of an oblong form but almost divided by two deep bays one which penetrates far west into the country near the north end and another which penetrates still most extensively from the north running above a hundred and fifty miles due south  THIS island is prodigiously mountanous  VOLCANOES  and lofty the mountains increase in height towards the central parts and are generally richly clothed with wood In  Macassar  as well as in  Mindanao  are some active volcanoes Mr  Dalrymple  in the th plate of his elegant views of land gives a fine idea of the country Mr  Loten  informed me that none of the  Indian  islands had such grand and beautiful scenery It abounds with rivers which spring high in the mountains and precipitate down vast rocks among a sylvan scene of lofty and singular trees The lakes and more still parts of the rivers give security to numberless water fowl of the larger and more clumsy kinds which retire there by fear of the crocodiles which haunt the lower and marshy parts Those are not deserted by the lesser palmated birds such as ducks and teal which being quick sighted and nimble easily evade the approach of the enemy  THIS island was discovered in by  Antonio de Britto  and  Garcias Henriguez  who at that time commanded in the  Moluccas Celebes  was reckoned one of the greatest of those islands The  Portuguese  established themselves here and whether their conduct was more moderate than in other places I know not but they gained the good opinion of the inhabitants who preserved towards them the most inviolable fidelity They kept their ground here till the year when the  Dutch  with a strong  squadron landed and defeated them and their faithful ally the king of  Macassar  a potent prince on the west side of the island and near the southern end Here the  Portuguese  had their colony The  Dutch  expelled them rased their churches to the ground and seized all the effects of the Jesuits whom they justly considered as their greatest enemies The king made one more attempt to expel these invaders but was unsuccessful and obliged to submit to the  Batavian  yoke The  English  had also for a long time great intercourse with this island for the sake of the rich productions of the  Spicy isles  till at length the subtile  Dutch  succeeded in preventing all commerce with  Macassar  The  Dutch  have now the monarch of this island and all its other princes at their command so they may more truly be said to be the governors of the country The  Chinese  are the only people who are permitted to trade here to supply the wants of the islanders The  Macassars  have a great commercial fishery around their island they go in fleets of more than a hundred sail which consist of proas from twelve to twenty tons burden and carry from sixteen to twenty men they go out with one monsoon and come in with another and send their fish to the  China  market the produce of its own seas not being equal to the demand of that overstocked empire It is remarkable that all these proas carry  Dutch  colors The island itself exports gold rice sago wax and slaves but its chief use to the  Dutch  is to keep other nations at a distance from the great repositories of spices Our old voyagers seldom failed of touching at  Celebes  to profit of the trade  I AM sorry to observe  SLAVES  in the account I meet with of all the islands even from  Sumatra  itself that the infamous slave trade  prevales in almost every one They are either brought to market by the piratical  Malayes  or  Buggesses  who make them one object of their cruizes or petty invasions or they are kidnapped by the coinhabitants of the same islands The  Mahometans  think they have the same right to hunt down and catch a  Pagan  as the gentry of  Liverpool  or  Bristol  have to encourage the trepanning of a curledpated negro and all these bring them to market with as little remorse I call as evidence Mr  Marsden  Sumatra p  Captain  Forrest  P  in his voyage to  Mergui  and old  Dampier  Voy i p  Slaves from  Celebes Mindanao  and even  Java  itself are seen at  Batavia  in numbers incredible let me do the  Batavians  the justice to say that some of their slaves are kept with great neatness and are instructed in mechanical trades The  Dutchman  fortunately for them finds it his interest to employ them in the loom rather than consume them under the pressure of labor beneath a vertical sun  OUR able officer captain  Carteret  in his return from his circumnavigation attempted to put into  Macassar  but was repulsed by the jealousy of the  Dutch  his distress passed expression most of his crew near the point of death by the hardships of his long voyage nothing could equal the unfeelingness of the  Dutchman  's heart there seemed to be little difference in its temper in the year and that of its rudest days Mr  Carteret  by amazing resolution at length got leave to anchor and procure refreshments in  Bonthain  bay about thirty miles from the capital There he suffered all kinds of extortion and observed every species of insolence and cruelty to the natives  Phlegmatic constitutions never feel for the suffering of others their callosity is incorrigible warm tempers may do wrong but they soon return to their native milkiness As to the  Dutch  they forced the refreshments from them at a small price and contented themselves with a thousand per cent profit from our commander What Captain  Carteret  tells us from p to p is worthy of perusal excepting his voyage which was most ably written by himself all the rest of the three volumes is Mr  Hawksworth  's compilation from the journals of the navigators  MR  Carteret  could observe that the city of  Macassar  CITY OF MACASSAR  in Lat ° ′ was large and most delightfully situated It is said also to be very strong About  Bonthain  bay are numerous villages and the country abounding with provisions and timber  GREAT quantities of  Sualloo  or sea slug  SUALLOO  an animal of the  Mollusca  tribe is fished up here especially about the thirteen small isles called the  Paternosters  in the streight between  Celebes  and  Borneo  it is supposed to be a species of  Actinia  and lies on the sandy bottom and often on that which is environed with coral rocks The fishers strike it with fourbearded iron prongs placed parallel to each other on the surface of two iron shot of six or nine pounds weight fastened to a strong line This  Sualloo  sometimes weighs half a pound numbers of boats with the crew and family on board subsist by this business and dry it in the smoke The black or best kind is sold to the  Chinese  who use it in their nice dishes for forty dollars a pecul whereas the worse or white only brings in four or five  THE people employed in this fishery are chiefly  Badjoos  BADJOOS PEOPLE  they inhabit many of the shores of the smaller islands around the  greater they may be called the  Tartars of the Sea  some few are stationary living in stilted houses close to the water's edge others live altogether in boats and with their families shift their quarters and change their residence along with the  Monsoons  Mr  Forrest  computes that they have about seven hundred boats and adds that they live chiefly on fish have a squealing voice and most savage appearance He supposes them to have been originally fugitives from  Macassar Java  and other places  THE  Buggesses  BUGGESSES  or native  Macassars  are the bravest people in  India  of proved fidelity if treated with confidence of the deepest revenge if insulted They spread far and wide on the ocean in character of freebooters and attack vessels with most astonishing desperation especially when inspired by opium On land their arms are lances or slender arrows pointed with the teeth of fish dipped in the fatal poison of the  Upas  tree which grows in this island These arrows they blow out of hollow trunks and hit their mark at a considerable distance So subtile is the venom that it almost instantaneously effects destruction nor do the  Macassars  themselves know any remedy  Nicuhoff  saw several  Dutch  soldiers cured by swallowing human dung by way of a vomit but others died notwithstanding the filthy remedy A certain root is spoken of growing in the island which is used as an antidote  M  Tavernier  was eyewitness to the rapid effect of this poison  EFFECT OF UPAS POISON  which I think too singular to be omitted "One day" says he  Travels p    an  Englishman  in heat of blood had killed one of the king of  Macassar  's subjects and though the king had  pardoned him yet both  English Hollanders  and  Portugals  fearing if the  Englishman  should go unpunished lest the islanders should revenge themselves upon some of them besought the king to put him to death which with much ado being consented to the king unwilling to put him to a lingering death and desirous to shew the effect of his poison resolved to shoot the criminal himself whereupon he took a long trunk and shot him exactly into the great toe of the right foot the place particularly aimed at two chirurgeons one an  Englishman  and the other a  Hollander  provided on purpose immediately cut off the member but for all that the poison had dispersed itself so speedily that the  Englishman  died at the same time  ALL the kings and princes of the east are very diligent in their enquiry after strong poisons and I remember that the chief of the  Dutch  factory and I tried several poisoned arrows with which the king of  Acheen  had presented him by shooting at squirrels who fell down dead as soon as ever they were touched  Boutan  a small isle near the southeast of  Celebes  BOUTAN  is independent and has its sultan who mimics all the state of a greater monarch Our countryman Mr  David Middleton  Purchas i  visited this island in and there passed a strong intercourse of civilities between him and the reigning prince  Middleton  sailed from  England  with a commercial view nor would he have been disappointed had not the king's rich magazine of goods been just burnt by his enemies The natives are like the  Mindanayans  in  shape and speak the  Malaye  language All are  Mahometans  as are the people of  Celebes  the story is that a certain king from the arguments he had heard on the topic of religion from some  Christians  and  Mahometans  took a great dislike to his own but being unable to determine which to chuse he convened a general assembly and after a most fervent prayer to Heaven resolved to prefer the religion of that party which should first land on his dominions possibly the  Mahometans  were in the secret their missionaries arrived and the whole island embraced the doctrine of that sect  I NOW descend towards the eastern end of  Java  and pass through the streights of  Balli  which divide  Java  from the island of that name  ISLAND OF BALLI  The streights are narrow rapid and bounded by picturesque hills many of a conoid form This is a muchfrequented passage  THE island abounds with every necessary of life both in the vegetable and animal creation When the  Dutch  touched here in their first voyage of the year they found it governed by a king who appeared in great state was attended by his guards and drawn in a chariot by milkwhite oxen The great men were carried in their bamboo palanquins and lived in the highest luxury The religion was then  Paganism  and the women as in  India  devoted themselves to the funeral pile on the decease of their husbands In  Le Promier Livre de Navigations  c are some prints  P  of the customs of the island  THIS island  SLAVES  and that of  Macassar  has the insamy of furnishing as many subjects to the slave trade as any part of the known  world excepting  Guinea  and they are sold with as little remorse as in any portion of the hardened universe  FROM  Balli  is a long chain of islands which I shall  TIMORIAN CHAIN  from  Timor Laut  call the  Timorian  chain running eastward and extends very near the coasts of  New Guinea  inclining a little towards the north as they approach that great island The names of the most considerable are  Lomboc Gumbava Ende  or  Flores  from the last they are broken into smaller isles such as  Solor Omba  and others scattered over the sea or grouped in clusters  Timor Laut  and  Arrou  are the most eastern and the largest of the latter class  VERY near to the south side of  Omba  is the great island of  Timor  which points to the southwest  TIMOR ISLAND  and with the adjacent isle of  Anamboa  forms a large triangular bason of which the isle of  Sandel Bosche  or sandal wood is the western side  Timor  was discovered in by the companions of  Magellan  who found it full of white sandal wood They report that on this archipelago the disease of  St Job  which they interpret the infamous disease reigneth more than in any other part of the world I suspect it to be the horrid disease called by  Bontius  P Nat Hist  the  Amboynse Pocken  THE  Portuguese  attempted to make themselves masters of this island but were obliged to abandon their design by a resistance of twenty years from the brave inhabitants They had settled on the bay of  Cupang  from which they were expelled by the  Dutch  in who built a fort named  Concordia  They keep this island merely for the sake of making it an outport to the  spicy islands of which they have the most extreme jealousy for there is nothing they apprehend so much as the intercourse of other nations with their usurpations in these parts  Timor  yields so little profit that except for the reason just given it would have been long since abandoned  LENGTH  The length of this island is near two hundred miles the breadth about sixty it is divided into many kingdoms such as  Cupang  and others In  Dampier  's time there were many  Portuguese  settlements or rather of the mixed breed the principal is at  Laphao  on the northern side but even there he saw but three white men the rest were coppercolored with lank black hair they spoke  Portuguese  were of the  Roman  catholick religion and would be very angry if they were not thought  Portuguese  as they value themselves greatly on their mongrel descent  THE natives are said to be the bravest of any in all this vast archipelago  NATIVES  but at the same time the most savage They conceal their nakedness by a sort of short apron made of many narrow stripes have bracelets round their arms and collars of shells round their necks and their hair stands erect Their weapons are vast sabres made of sandal wood with which it is said they can cut a man asunder at one blow Mr  Nieuhoff  Churchill vol ii p  gives the figures of the different wild soldiery of the islands  CAPTAIN  Cook  passed under a considerable part of the southern side of  Timor  in his return from his first voyage The land appeared very high mountain above mountain rising in slopes from the sea chiefly clothed with forests In some parts were swamps and mangrovetrees in others cleared land the marks  of inhabitants and in other places groves and cocopalms that reached a mile inland and close to them houses and plantations innumerable  THE domestic animals of  Timor  seem to have been introduced there by the  Europeans  except the hogs and buffaloes  ANIMALS  Monkies are numerous but I believe very few other native animals Here are infinite varieties of birds The woods abound with bees which produce quantities of honey and wax and the sea with fishes and shellfish and as to the vegetable kingdom it yields most of the tropical trees fruits and plants  NEW HOLLAND  I NOW digress to the stupendous island of  New Holland  and fairly confess that the zeal of the zoologist has laid hold of me and that a desire to investigate so fine a field has made me willingly submit to the impulse I shall close the original subject by returning to the  Molucca  islands and breathe my last words in their spicy air or their latitude Little history is to be expected of the land I now visit brief accounts of the various discoverers is all that can be given till we arrive on the eastern coast which the unfortunate acquaintance with in has peopled with the profligate outcasts of our country cruelly redeemed from the gibbet to undergo a lingering life of nakedness and famine in this most distant land  New Holland  is in length from the north point in Lat  VAST EXTENT  ° to ° ′ south about two thousand miles and its greatest breadth from its most western part in Long ° ′ to its most eastern in Long ° ′ about three thousand miles Its extent in the southern parts is unknown as much of the western side remains to be discovered This vast tract proves equal in size according  to the estimate of our later navigators to all  Europe  I see no reason why it should not be called a fifth continent  America  itself is but an insulated continent superior as it may be to that of  New Holland  IN tracing the discovery of that immense region  DISCOVERED IN  I shall begin at the very northern extremity opposite to the isles of  Arrou  The name it bears in that part is  Arnheim  's Land and the discovery sixed in the year I shall proceed to the western side and then surround the country till I arrive at the point I am now leaving  IN Lat  DAMPIER'S BAY BY DAMPIER IN  ° ′ south ° East Long from  London  is land discovered in by our great navigator  Dampier  Voyages i  Geographers have not even honored the spot with a name I will therefore style it  Dampier  's  Bay  Our countryman took his departure from  Timor  and passing by a shoal of sand and rock in Lat ° ′ in water so deep that he could not fathom it with his line on  January  th he anchored in a deep bay full of small islands about two miles from shore The land was low and even with  dunes  at the water edge skirted with rocky points  THE inhabitants were the most miserable our countrymen ever saw  NATIVES  without any cloathing except the rudest cover for their nakedness consisting of nothing more than the slip of the rind of a tree for a girdle and a little grass stuffed into it before as an apron They were tall strait and thin their limbs very small and long their heads large their foreheads round they had great bottle noses wide mouths full lips and their eyes  perpetually winking or kept shut from their being so greatly annoyed with flies that from habit they never open them like other people but are obliged to hold up their heads if they wish to see any thing above their level They have no beards and the people of both sexes universally want two of the upper fore teeth which they draw out their visages are long and their general aspect the most disagreable imaginable their skins are coal black their hair short and frizzled like the  African  negroes They had neither houses or dwellings but lay in the open air and associated in companies of twenty or thirty men women and children their arms were wooden swords and lances  Dampier  found many on one of the islands they had not the appearance even of a canoe but must have swam from place to place and as to food they could only collect the shells and animals flung up by the sea They were exceedingly timid  Dampier  attempted to make them work in carrying water to the ship but they had not strength or dexterity enough to carry as much as a boy of ten years of age  SEA tortoises and  Manatee  were found in plenty on the coast  MANATEE  and abundance of fish the tides rose here about five fathoms  THE trees were neither large nor numerous one kind exuding a red gum like the  Sanguis draconis  was frequent we shall take notice of it hereafter  G F de Witt's  Land in Lat ° south was discovered  DE WITT'S ISLAND  according to  Arrowsmith  in according to others in

From  Rosemary  islands a discovery of his in Lat  ENDRACHT'S LAND  ° ′ the land turns southerly  Endracht  's Land lies just under the tropic of  Capricorn  discovered according to  Hawkesworth  's map in  Dirk Hartog  islands and  Sharks  bay are in Lat  SHARKS BAY  ° The land so high as to be seen nine or ten leagues distant It bore neither shrubs or trees above ten feet high The prognostics of the approach of land were a sort of grey tern as big as a lapwing and like that bird flapping its wings The eyes encircled with black the bill red the tail forked  SEA snakes appeared in great abundance  SEA SNAKES  one species was four feet long yellow with a flat tail four fingers broad  THE other was smaller and round spotted with black and yellow  Dampier  saw others very long and slender others as thick as a man's leg with a red head This reminds me of the species described by  Arrian  in his  Periphus Maris Erythroei  to which he gives black skins and bloodred eyes I dare say his account is just only his informer confined the color of the head to the eyes  ON land was an  Avosetta  with the head and neck red  AVOSETTA  and a sea pie exactly resembling ours only those parts were totally black  Dampier  Voy iii p  also discovered a species of  Kangaroo  KANGAROO  an animal with very short fore legs which it went jumping on but his  Guano  was an horrible animal too disgusting even for him to eat who had been used to food of all sorts as snakes alligators and crocodiles so offensive was this in look and smell his description is so forcible that we may well give him full credit  At the  rump instead of the tail there they had a stump of a tail  HORRIBLE LIZARD  which appeared like another head but not really such being without mouth or eyes yet this creature seemed by this means to have a head at each end and which may be reckoned a fourth difference the legs also seemed all four of them to be forelegs being all alike in shape and length and seeming by the joints and bending to be made as if they were to go indifferently either head or tail foremost They were speckled black and yellow like toads and had scales or knobs on their backs like those of crocodiles plated on to the skin or stuck into it as part of the skin They are very flow in motion and when a man comes nigh them they will stand still and hiss not endeavouring to get away Their livers are also spotted black and yellow and the body when opened has a very unsavoury smell  I HAVE little doubt but that this is the horrible animal figured by  Seba  Mus Vol i tab  under the name of  Salamandra vera Seu Gekko Ceylonicus  He describes it as most dreadfully venomous even so as to infect the very waters to such a degree as to poison any person who is so unfortunate to drink of them  HE found here green turtle weighing two hundred pounds and abundance of large sharks from which he gave name to the bay In the maw of one he discovered what he calls the head of a  Hippopotamus  the hairy lips were sound and two of the teeth he pulled out were eight inches long and a little crooked the rest only four I must question whether this was the real  Hippopotamus  or the  Dugon  COMMODORE  Francis Pilstaert  PILSTAERT IN  being sent on a voyage of discovery with eleven ships was in wrecked in the  Batavia  on this coast near  Edelsland  EDELSLAND  in Lat ° He escaped returned in a skiff to  Batavia  and was obliged to leave several of his crew behind Part had conspired and cruelly murdered the rest but on his coming back to rescue from destruction those whom he had left he seized on the miscreants and gave them into the hands of the executioner  Van de Leuwins'  Land  VAN DE LEUWINS IN  in Lat ° ′ was discovered in From hence the shore runs due east for a course of some hundred miles  PETER NUYTS IN  In the famous commodore  Peter Nuyts  sailed along the coast and made many attempts to land but was always repulsed Is not this a proof that the southern shores of  New Holland  possess a superior population and superior valor in the inhabitants to all the rest of the known parts of this vast country The tract is to this day called after his name  FROM certain islands called  St Francis's  and  St Peter's  in Lat ° south Long ° east no farther discoveries have been made The land is supposed to take a southern curvature and to contract its breadth gradually The course is marked with the dotted line nor do we recover land till we reach the very southern extremity which spreads to no great breadth one side ends in  Southwest Cape  in Lat ° ′ the other in  South Cape  in Lat ° ′ and the land from each runs northward  THIS part of  New Holland  was discovered in  TASMAN IN  by  Abel Tasman  who was sent for that purpose by the states he named it  Van Diemen  's Land gave names to several islands and bays and made some remarks on the country if he was accurate  they prove a variety in the inhabitants He says they were a largemade people of a color between brown and yellow their hair long and almost as thick as that of the  Japanese  and that like them they combed it up and fixed it at the top of their heads with a pin They covered their middle with a mantle some with a kind of mat others with a sort of woollen cloth their ingenuity might reach the fabricating a mat but I doubt the possibility of the latter  IN  Tasman  after a long interval  CAPTAIN FURNEAUX IN  was followed by captain  Furneaux  who had been separated from captain  Cook  and directed his course for the purpose of pursuing the discovery of the  Dutch  navigator he fell on the very same country and found the same bays and headlands observed by  Tasman  He saw the land eight or nine leagues distant it was rather high broken and with bold shores but beaten by a most violent surf it probably having the whole weight of the Antarctic ocean from the very pole rolling on this great headland  THE soil here was black rich but thin  Cook's last voyage i    SOIL  the sides of the hills covered with trees and the view greatly beautified by the vast cataracts tumbling from immense heights and a rock with fluted pillars possibly  basaltic  Captain  Furneaux  saw none of the natives but met with their miserable wigwams and some bags and nets in which they carried their provisions and also a stone to strike fire with and some tinder  IN  January    CAPTAIN COOK IN  this country was visited in person by our great navigator who had the good fortune to meet with some of the natives who came to him with the utmost confidence and  without any sign of fear  NATIVES  They were of the common stature slender black and with hair as frizzled as any negroe but not distinguished by remarkable thick lips or flat noses and their features far from disagreeable their teeth were good but very dirty nor did they want any of the upper fore teeth as  Dampier  observed in those whom he saw The hair of these was clotted with a sort of red ointment and their faces were painted with the same they had bushy beards on their chins and upper lips which was another variation from the most northern people yet the eyes of these were by no means affected like the miserable natives of the environs of  Sharks  bay The hair of the women was cut or shaven sometimes wholly sometimes partially and some had a circle of hair left like the tonsure of the  Roman  catholick clergy The men were quite naked the women had the skin of the  Kangaroo  tied over their shoulders and round their waists the skins of both sexes were marked with scars  THEIR habitations were little wigwams made of sticks covered with bark  DRYADES  others reminded you of those of the  Dryades  of the poets they formed a hollow in the vast trees of the country to the height of six or seven feet which they effected by fire they left so much untouched that the tree grew most luxuriantly and gave the image of  Tasso  's enchanted grove this is the only forest tree of the country the bark is white the stem quite strait and clear of branches to the height of sixty feet it yielded a transparent gum or resin and the leaves of the lesser branches had an aromatic smell The wood is very long and tough fit for spars oars and even masts for which purpose could it be made ligther none would be better  No other species of quadrupeds were observed here but the  Opossum Hist Quadr  N  o  and the  Kangaroo  N  o  Captain  Cook  very humanely turned into the woods a boar and sow pig which if they escape the sight of the natives for some years may prove the stocking of the country with animals equally useful to the inhabitants and casual visitants  ABUNDANCE of fish are found on the coast as the  elephant  fish rays soles flounders and the  Atherina Hepsetus  Br Zool iii No tab lxv  which extends to our

voyage of was  Adventure Bay  in Lat ° ′  ADVENTURE BAY  between the  Fluted Cape  and Cape  Frederick Henry  He continued his voyage towards  New Zealand  The coast to the north had been explored by Captain  Furneaux  who passed in his way southward  Maria  's island  Schoutens  and other places named by  Tasman  As we advance farther north we find  Furneaux  's and the  Sisters  The last is in Lat ° ′ and Long ° the land from which he bore away for  New Zealand  IN Lat ° south Long ° we arrive off Cape  Hicks  CAPE HICKS  which may be celebrated as the first place ever discovered on the eastern coast of  New Holland  this great event took place on  April  th  under the auspices of Captain  Cook  It was in this voyage that Mr  Banks  afterwards Sir  Joseph  and doctor  Solander  were his philosophical companions  TROPIC BIRD  A tropic bird was seen in Lat ° ′ an uncommon sight as it very rarely exceeds the limits of the tropics Proceeding northward he passed by a mountain he called the  Dromedary  On the twentyseventh he observed the wondering natives collected on the rocks in admiration of the novel sight  BOTANY BAY  and on the th anchored in  Botany Bay  of later years well known as the common retreat of the unfortunate brave  THE natives of these parts differed very little from those observed in the more southern latitudes  NATIVES  There can be no doubt but our appearance was very hostile they were diffident of us to the highest degree declined all intercourse and refused all our presents our navigators certainly did not use the arts of conciliating their affections After frequently treating them with a volley of small shots on their legs or more muscular parts we are not to wonder at their dislike to the strangers who had visited their coasts Their wants by reason of the happiness of the climate did not demand cloathing and their minds were superior to the accepting of gewgaws but they were frequently pressed by hunger  IN  Endeavour  river they boldly came on board the ship and seeing plenty of turtle wished to have a share they seized on two trusting to the rites of hospitality or the justice of partaking of the provisions found in their own seas to which they had a natural title instead of that they were roughly treated and so highly irritated as to take an instant revenge by setting fire to  the grass that surrounded our tents they were brave to a degree of temerity two have been known to oppose the landing of forty of our people their offensive weapons were swords made of some hard wood and darts or lances armed at the end with fishes bones or the spine of the sting rays their defensive arms a round buckler They were painted like the people of  Van Diemen  's land and as an additional ornament had a great bone of some bird stuck through their noses and another through each car Mr  Parkinson  gives a good representation in plate xxvii of two of the natives armed for fight and in the attitude of combat as to cloathing neither sex made the least attempt to conceal their nakedness  THESE people savage as they may seem are not ignorant of the rudiments of drawing Mr  Phillip  Voy to Botany Bay p  observed on many of the rocks figures of animals shields weapons and even men and one in particular of a man beginning to dance and this in rather a superior style surely it must be admitted that people thus tinctured with a liberal art are capable of civilization under proper treatment  WHAT religious rites they have is unknown but it is evident from the same authority  Ib p  that they burn their dead  THEIR habitations are most miserable they lie under the protection of some great pieces of bark flung over a ridged frame made of boughs of trees  Ib p tab    THEIR food are fish shell fish or any thing they can collect on the shores They have a most artless species of canoe made of bark stretched on a frame and tied together at each  end two sometimes more will venture in one of them they keep along the shoals to strike the fish which appears to be their principal subsistence they also eat the fowls or the few quadrupeds they can contrive to take On many of the tall trees were cut notches in the stems to facilitate their ascent They seemed to conceal themselves on the top and by that means surprise the birds as they alight or catch them at roost or from this situation kill with their lances any beast that chances to pass beneath As to their cookery they content themselves with eating their meat raw or at best with giving it a slight broiling over their fires  THE country is hilly but not mountanous part covered with tall trees quite clear from underwood in some parts near the shores were extensive tracts hid by brushwood and in many places swamps full of the  Mangrove  or  Rhizophora mangle  Catesby ii tab  Many rills discharge themselves into  Botany  bay but it wanted depth of water to give room for ships of large size The soil in places was black and fat and gave Captain  Cook  reason to believe it would be productive of any sort of grain The trees were filled with birds of most beautiful colors particularly those of the parrot tribe The country abounded with plants and from that circumstance the harbor was called  Botany Bay  All this coast was named  New South Wales  from the extreme south to the extreme north a denomination given near two centuries ago to part of the territories adjacent to  Hudson  's bay  IN the year  OUR CONVICTS SENT THERE  when we began to be at a loss about the disposal of our criminals legislature was advised to banish into  this country all those who had been by royal mercy reprieved from death or who had been convicted of crimes liable only to the punishment of transportation to our late colonies  AN act was passed for that purpose in the same year and in consequence a fleet was prepared to convey to this distant country as many convicts as at that time fell under the penalty of the law The  Syrius  frigate was fitted out to convoy the governor The gentleman selected for the arduous charge was captain  Arthur Phillip  who had long served in our navy with great credit  GOVERNOR PHILLIP  and for some time was engaged in the service of  Portugal  during part of which he with great good conduct and humanity performed a duty similar to that his country now committed to him for he was employed once if not oftener in conveying the criminals of that nation to its colonies of the  Brazils  THE governor sailed from  Spithead  on  May  th On  June  d he and his fleet reached  Teneriff  on  August  th anchored off  Rio de Janeiro  on  October  th in  Table Bay  at the cape of  Good Hope  which he left on  November  th in the  Supply  reached  Botany Bay  on  January  d having performed in a bad sailer a voyage of seven thousand miles in fiftyone days the  Syrius  and the whole convoy anchored safely in the bay on the th and th of the same month  IT is a popular opinion that the expence of transportation of the convicts amounted to three hundred pounds a man including the provision made for their cloathing and support for some small time after their landing I was in hopes that two pamphlets published by  Debrett  in under authority of government  would have confirmed or refuted the report especially as one of them pretended to give an account of the expences but the detail is so very imperfect that I am not able to satisfy either my own or the reader's curiosity  MR  Phillip  had previously taken a most exact survey of every part of the proposed place of settlement he found it bad as a port and from the wet nature of the environs suspected that the air would affect the health of the new colonists He observed that Captain  Cook  mentioned a bay in Lat ° ′ south very little distant from the other which he had named  Port Jackson  PORT JACKSON  and where he thought there was good anchorage Mr  Phillip  lost no time but made a thorough examination of that also he found it equal at least to our celebrated harbor  Milford Haven  in old  South Wales  It opens with an ample mouth and after some space divides into two most extensive meandering branches with numbers of other small bays creeks or coves pointing again to the right and to the left so as to form the finest and most secure harbor in the world capable of containing the navies of  Europe  itself  HERE Mr  Phillip  determined to establish his colony  SYDNEY COVE  and fixing on a place which he named  Sydney Cove  began immediately to trace the outlines of the first street of his intended town The officers live in huts but houses are building of brick and stone the governor is very moderate in that designed for himself which contains only six rooms The land allotted for cultivation has been found to be very good and to return on the first trial two hundred bushels of wheat and sixty of  barley  The following state of Agriculture and the amount of Live Stock belonging to the Governor and to the settlers at the colony of New South Wales d August is extracted from a newspaper of October E     gov  settlers  total  Acres in Wheat        Acres in Barley    ½  ½  Acres in Potatoes        Acres in Maize        Acres in

very great in a short time they destroyed not less than twelve thousand pounds of flour and rice brought over with the first transportation There are also vegetables in plenty from seeds brought from  England  I cannot enter into the account of the whole proceedings by the detail given in the two pamphlets published by  J Debrett  imperfect as they are may be seen the humanity of government in providing every necessary for the use of the convicts yet I fear it has been disappointed in its hopes The immense expence we have been at in sending provisions from hence from the cape of  Good Hope  and from  China  notwithstanding the glossing over several particulars gives reason to imagine that our colony has been at the point of starving  THE  Kangaroo  and others of the Opossum tribe may be eaten but those animals which never were numerous will soon become extinct in the neighborhood of the colony and we dare  not for fear of the natives trespass beyond our bounds the  New Hollanders  still continue very hostile Fish is found in plenty but the turtle on which we seemed to have some dependence is a very precarious article  THE colony looks up for support to a little spot called  Norfolk Island  NORFOLK ISLAND  in Lat ° south Long ° east It contains from twelve to thirteen thousand acres and does not exceed in circumference sixteen miles is very mountanous and covered with a thick wood choaked up with underwood it is surrounded with cliffs forty fathoms high and quite perpendicular excepting at a few creeks dignified with the name of bays to which often a raging surf denies all approach  THE island is happy in many streams of fine water some copious enough to turn a mill The mold in places freed by our people from trees is the richest and deepest in the world abundance of pumicestones and porous red  lava  is scattered over its surface and even mixed with the soil giving strong reason to suppose it to have been of volcanic origin  A SMALL colony was detached  COLONIZED  on  February  th from  Jackson Port  to this island in hopes of its contributing in time to the support of the parent state It consisted only of a subaltern officer a surgeon two men who understood the cultivation and dressing of flax nine male and six female convicts and over them was appointed Lieutenant  King  of the navy sole governor of this seagirt reign With his little colony he passed the singular interval of above two years till he received on  March  th a mighty reinforcement of two companies of marines five men and three women from the civil department  and a hundred and sixteen male and sixtyseven female convicts This detachment sowed wheat and barley from  May  to  August  and got in their harvest in  December  which produced twentyfive fold Mayz succeeds well the sugarcane vines and oranges thrive exceedingly and potatoes produce two crops in a year All kinds of garden plants come to good perfection The rat its only quadruped was at first a pest to the colony If this isle proves the nursing mother to our establishment at  Port Jackson  as the isle of  Anglesea  or  Môn mam Cymru  is said to have been to  Wales  I shall think it the

THESE are the only plants which the sparing communications of our philosophical travellers will permit us to mention The last is of the greatest importance to the natives and may hereafter become so to every nation in  Europe  as it produces the best and most tenacious hemp in the world I shall deliver the description and history of it borrowed from vol iii p of Captain  Cook  's First Voyage "There is" says our great navigator  however a plant that serves the inhabitants instead of hemp and flax which excels all that are put to the same purposes in the world Of this plant there are two sorts the leaves of both resemble those of flags but their flowers are smaller and their clusters more numerous in one kind they are yellow and in the other a deep red Of the leaves of these plants with very little preparation they make all their common apparel and of these they also make their strings lines and cordage for every purpose which are so much stronger than any thing we can make with hemp that they will not bear a comparison  From the same plant by another preparation they draw long slender fibres which shine like silk and are as white as snow of these which are also surprisingly strong the finer cloths are made and of the leaves without any other preparation than splitting them into proper breadths and tying the strips together they make their fishing nets some of which as I have before remarked are of an enormous size  Norfolk Island  is peculiarly happy in its climate  CLIMATE  the air is pure salubrious and delicious freed from excessive heat by the constant breezes from the sea and of so mild a temperature throughout the winter that there is a perpetual vegetation crop succeeds crop and the refreshing showers maintain a constant verdure sometimes there are great droughts From  February  to  August  may be called the rainy season not that it is regular for there is sometimes fine weather for a fortnight together but when the rain does fall it is in torrents  ABOUT midway between  Norfolk Island  and  New Holland  is  Lord Howe Island  LORD HOWE ISLAND  discovered in by Lieutenant  Henry Lidgbird Ball  a son of the late  George Ball  of  Irby  in  Cheshire  Esquire This isle is small in extent in length only seven leagues and in form of a crescent In some parts it rises into lofty craggy hills that called  Ball's Pyramid  is very singular formed on one side of  Basaltic  columns and so lofty as to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues Another rock is circular at top so as to look like a spread fan the rest so low as to give these rocks the form of islands Mr  Ball  says that it abounds in cabbagepalms or  Areca Sapida  with mangrovetrees and  Manchineel  or  Hippomane Mancinella  Catesby i  which spread even to the tops of the mountains  Lord Howe Island  swarms with birds such as parrots parroquets large pigeons and several other land birds also gannets in infinite numbers rails white gallinules like those of  Norfolk Isle  and a land fowl of a dusky brown color with a bill four inches long feet like a chicken very fat and very good food  THE coast swarms with fish but what will render this island of unspeakable use to our colonists are the amazing abundance of turtle which frequent its shores during summer and may be taken in that season in any numbers but at the approach of winter they all retire northward  Norfolk Island  also abounds with fish and in the season with very fine turtle  VIEWS of this singular island is given by Mr  Phillip  Voy p    FAUNULA  I WILL now continue the subjects of natural history of

the historian  Hawksworth  iii  of the most remarkable kind about the size of a minnow and had two very strong breast fins we found it in places that were quite dry where we supposed it might have been left by the tide but it did not seem to become languid by the want of water for upon our approach it leaped away by the help of the breast fins as nimbly as a frog neither did it seem to prefer water to land for when we found it in the water it frequently leaped out and pursued its way upon dry ground we also observed that when it was in places where small stones were standing above the surface of the water at a little distance from each other it chose rather to leap from stone to stone than to pass through the water and we saw several of them pass entirely over puddles in this manner till they came to dry ground and then leap away  Two crabs are described of a new species  CRABS  and one of most exquisite beauty it had all its claws and joints of the most lovely ultramarine color and the under side of so pure a white and of so delicate a polish as to resemble the white of the finest porcellane the other was marked with blue but more sparingly and the back with three brown spots perhaps these differed only in sex  WHOSOEVER reads the following meagre  Florula  of  New Holland  PLANTS  will be amazed at the few plants which I have been able to  ascertain especially

attention that  Dampier  shewed to almost every thing which came in his way  PLANTS OBSERVED BY DAMPIER  is evident by his bringing home from  New Holland  several specimens of plants He communicated

length of the voyage They are supposed to have been brought by the trade winds which blow full on this shore and to have come from  Terra del Espirito Santo  or the  New Hebrides Islands  visited by Captain  Cook  in  LET me now resume the coast At the small distance of eight miles to the north of  Port Jackson  is  Broken Bay  BROKEN BAY  a name given by Captain  Cook  when he passed it by on his departure northwards It was examined by Mr  Phillip  in  March    Voy p  found to be extensive and to have two mouths one impeded by a bar so that the entrance is impervious except by small vessels the other capable of admitting ships of the greatest burden The land here was higher than that about  Port Jackson  more rocky  but equally covered with timber Trees of great size grow on the tops of the most inaccessible mountains The country was populous and it was observed that most of the women had the two joints of the little finger cut off most of the men wanted the right front tooth their  septum narium  was perforated and had a bone or stick thrust through it The want of language kept our voyagers ignorant of the cause of these strange customs Their skins were singularly scarred from the crown of the head to their feet the scars prominent and seemed as if filled with wind  IN another excursion Mr  Phillip  made to this bay  HAWKESBURY RIVER  he discovered a very considerable river which he named the  Hawkesbury  it was from three hundred to eight hundred feet wide and navigable for the largest merchant ships as far as a hill named  Richmond Hill  about fortyfive miles from its discharge into the bay but it is not safe for ships to go so high up because of the heavy rains the water rises thirty feet above its usual level the vessels therefore ought not to approach nearer than fifteen or twenty miles from the foot of the hill where they may lie secure in fresh water  Richmond Hill  is called the head of the river for there it divides into two branches grows shallow and was seen for some way till lost in the wooded rocks of the country  ANOTHER river was discovered  NEPEAN RIVER  which Mr  Phillip  named the  Nepean  from three to four hundred feet broad which also overflows its banks in hard rains to the same height as the former into which it is supposed to fall The soil on both these rivers is excellent the banks well wooded Wild ducks inhabit these  waters in great numbers and here were first seen the black swans A cataract at the foot of  Richmond  hill prevented the party from proceeding any further in boats That hill is the termination of a chain of mountains which runs northward and probably joins those that range nearly parallel to the coast from fifty to sixty miles inland The difficulty of reaching these hills is very great for after the first day's journey is such a succession of ravines many with sides inaccessible that our people could not proceed above fifteen miles in five days They therefore returned to await the arrival of the floods to swell the  Nepean  when they hoped they could reach these mountains by water  FROM the entrance into  Port Jackson  as far as Lat ° ′  INDIAN HEAD  the coast keeps due north from a point called  Indian Head  it begins to incline to the west  A LITTLE farther is  Bustard Bay  in Lat ° ′  BUSTARD BAY  which takes its name from a new species of bustard shot there with a black band across its breast Its weight was seventeen pounds It proved excellent eating Mr  Latham  mentions it in vol vii p  AT  Keppel's Bay  in Lat ° ′  KEPPEL'S BAY  the coast begins to be filled more or less with islands In about Lat ° ′ is the bay of  Inlets  from the various sounds that seem to penetrate deeply into the land between the islands After a long range of coast partly impeded with isles and partly free in Lat ° ′ is cape  Tribulation  Off this cape the  Endeavour  PROVIDENTIAL ESCAPE  on Sunday  June  th struck on a coral rock and remained immoveable except by that species of motion which ground away the sheathings  and by admitting a torrent of water threatened speedy destruction to the whole crew The rising tide which might remove her out of the present situation redoubled the anxiety for probably she would then instantly sink into the depth of ten or twelve fathoms A thought  suggested by Mr  Monkhouse  a young midshipman saved them from destruction he advised the dropping a sail covered with oakum and wool over the outside and hauled under the ship's bottom with ropes till it reached the leak they executed his plan and from the suction of the sail by the water into the most dangerous of the leaks the ship was enabled to keep afloat when it was released from the rock by the tide and the  redeemed  to get into a secure place to repair the damage On this critical occasion not an oath was heard among our sailors the habit of profaneness however strong being instantly subdued by the dread of incurring guilt when death seemed to be so near A gentleman then aboard mentioned to me one effect of fear that of being seized with a most intolerable thirst but as soon as their safety was ensured their minds and their bodies returned to their wonted tones No cape or river was distinguished by the title of Providence or any grateful memorial Mr  Hawksworth  in his own mind seems to have been conscious that something ought to have been said his wondrous apology in his wondrous preface is certainly the greatest wonder that the world ever wondered at In the preface in the pages xix xx xxi may be seen the strange embarrassments that a good man labors under when he compliments his patrons with his conscience and servilely gives up the cause of truth  A NEIGHBORING river in Lat ° ′  ENDEAVOUR RIVER  with a fine beach fit for heaving down and completing the repairs of the battered ship for the pursuit of the voyage might have received an epithet suitable to the occasion instead of that we find it only under the cool title of the  Endeavour  river  THE natives appeared in this place their canoes were made of a tree hollowed like those of  Guinea  and other artless parts of the world These were capable of holding four people  THE  Kangaroo  is found here possibly it extends over every part The  Quolla Hist Quad  ii N  o  was seen here The common  English  crow was observed near this river and a great variety of other birds On the shores were numbers of the fine green turtles of vast sizes and the  Gigantic Chamae  which I have before mentioned Our  English Mullet Br Zool  iii N  o  is met with here In the rivers and salt creeks were alligators or crocodiles  THE  Termes destructor  makes its curious nest in the trees of this country  TERMES  A black species which artfully works out the pith of the branches of a tree and finds secure shelter in the hollow were common  Rumphius  ii found the same species in the branches of the  Arbor regis  in  Amboina  ANOTHER kind is like the white ant of the  East Indies  it forms two sorts of retreats one of the size of a man's head suspended in clusters from the boughs of a tree made of agglutinated fragments of vegetables containing innumerable cells These are most fully inhabited and have communications with each other and the nests themselves with all the rest which are suspended on the same tree These again have another  avenue along the stem leading to a retreat formed at the root of some tree but not the same with that which holds their pendulous nests This is made of earth and is about six feet high  A LITTLE to the north of  Endeavour  river are cape  Bedford  and cape  Flattery  CAPE BEDFORD AND CAPE FLATTERY  off them is a cluster of small isles and most numerous reefs Let me here acquaint the reader of the very perilous situation of our illustrious seaman during his three months navigation He sailed all that time in a channel bounded by the land on one side and to the seaward by a reef of rocks or coral banks not less tremendous extending the length of three hundred and sixty leagues Within this reef he was obliged to anchor at night with the thunder of the surge foaming over it expecting inevitable destruction from the breaking of the cables or from the driving of the ship which she often did to a certain degree The man at the chains was perpetually heaving out the lead without omitting it a moment and under such circumstances did our navigator escape It was natural for him to wish to enjoy the open sea soon after he left  Endeavour  river by ascending a lofty isle he saw the opening in the reef in Lat ° ′ which with consummate abilities and courage he attempted and with success The instant he got beyond the breakers he met with a rolling sea and no ground with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line a certainty he had obtained his wish The island from which he had made his observation was one of the three called the islands of  Direction  that strangers in future might find the passage  NEW dangers now awaited him a vast sea came rolling from the east and brought him nearer and nearer the perils he sought to shun The same billow which had washed the side of the ship broke to a tremendous height upon the adjacent rocks leaving beneath an unfathomable watery valley no broader than the base of that single wave Two light breezes saved them from the jaws of death After the most arduous efforts they got through another favorable opening in the reef through which the ship was carried by a current of amazing rapidity They now exulted in recovering that very situation they had so long labored to extricate themselves from The opening was not more than a quarter of a mile wide yet the force of the torrent carried the ship exactly in the midway Here it was impossible not to be grateful to Heaven Captain  Cook  called this salutary gap  Providential Inlet  PROVIDENTIAL INLET  and this proof of piety remains both in the book and in the chart The impiety of expunging it would have been too glaring  THESE coral reefs are most surprising operations of nature  CORAL REEFS  they rise like a wall almost perpendicularly out of the unfathomable deep and at low water are dry in many places here the enormous waves of the vast southern ocean meeting with so abrupt a resistance break with inconceivable violence in a surf which no rocks or storms in the northern hemisphere can produce  To form these stupendous works nature makes use of no other instruments than a little worm contemptible to vulgar eyes Well may we join in the fine apostrophe of  Pliny  in his  tam parvis atque tam nullis quae ratio quanta vis quam inextricabilis perfectio  THESE reefs are composed of various kinds of coral The  Tubipora musica  is mentioned among them and they give shelter to numbers of beautiful shells and  Mollusca  among the former are the  Chamae  some so large that two men can scarcely move them  WITHIN the reef from the inlet to  York Cape  the whole channel is filled with small isles rocks or coral rocks  York Cape  is in Lat ° ′ south the land trends from it fast to the west the sea to the northeast is full of islands one beyond the other These captain  Cook  called  Prince of Wales's Islands  and supposes they reach quite to  New Guinea  The passage between  New Holland  he called  Endeavour  Streights  ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS  exulting in having been the first who proved the entire insulation of this vast land The length of the streights was ten leagues the breadth about five except at the northeast end where they were contracted by the isles to two leagues the depth from four to nine fathoms and the tide rose twelve feet He now hoisted  British  colours took possession of the country in the name of his Majesty and called the isle on which the ceremony was performed  Possession Island  most of the islands were well clothed with herbage and wood apparently well inhabited and the natives of both sexes quite naked  CAPTAIN COOK now pursued his voyage to  New Guinea  The distance between the opposite point of  New Guinea  and the most northern of  New Holland  is only two hundred and  ten miles We here nearly rejoin the place we left to perform our circuit of the country The land on the western extremity of  Endeavour  streight and the eastern point of  Arnheim  Land forms the entrance into the great gulph of  Carpentaria  CARPENTARIA  which runs due south far into the land It received its name from the  Dutch  general  Carpenter  the zealous promoter of discoveries in these parts about the beginning of the last century  SPICY ISLANDS  WE now proceed to the  Molucca  islands  ARROU ISLES  and taking a course due north pass between those of  Timorlaut  and  Arrou  The last is the most eastern of the  Timorian  chain and forms a group consisting of three or four larger isles and a multitude of little rocks and reefs closely clustered adjoining the east end of  Arrou  proper We are now arrived within reach of the perfumed air of the  Molucca  or famous spicy islands a land of romance where nature assumes a new shape in picturesque scenery and in the beautiful and singular form of numbers of the animal and vegetable creation whether inhabitants of land or water  THE long celebrated  Manucodialae  BIRDS OF PARADISE  or birds of paradise first begin to appear in these islands These birds so singular in the structure and disposition of their feathers so elegant in their form and so romantic in their history gave occasion soon after their discovery to the supposition of their having been the celebrated Phoenix of the antients The learned  Forster  with his usual depth of judgment hath collected every thing relating to that ideal bird  in his  Latin  and  German  translation of the  Indian Zoology  and effectually disproved that the invention originated from any one of this  genus  I refer the reader to his disseration and barely mention that the antient describers of the  Phoenix  give it the form and size of an eagle with an exquisite richness of coloring they say that it lived Dclx years and at the completion of that period formed its nest with the twigs of the most odoriferous trees and died upon them A young one sprung from its remains and conveyed them to  Panchaia  the city of the sun performed the funeral rites and placed them on the altar  Pliny  from whom this relation was taken adds that it was reported one had been brought to  Rome  but with his usual good sense stamps on it the charge of fiction  NOTWITHSTANDING the remoteness of the native country of this whole genus I cannot absolutely affirm the impossibility of the antients being acquainted with some of the species They had from distant times a regular trade with  India  Before the days of  Ptolemy  they pushed their navigation beyond the peninsula of  Malacca  to  Cattigara  the modern  Ponteamas  and the  Metropolis Sina  the present  Cambodia  Notwithstanding the antients might have penetrated no farther yet as the  Indians  were extremely commercial the  Romans  might receive from them accounts of the most distant isles their commodities and even their curiosities The birds of  India  were known to the  Romans  it is possible that they might have seen or at least heard of those of  Paradise  no words could better suit these most singular species than  discolores maxime et inenarrabiles  Plin Lib cap  birds of  different colors and not to be described and few are more difficult to be represented in words than those of this genus  THE time in which they were brought to  Europe  was very early and I suspect long before they were observed by any naturalists There is reason to believe that the  Turks  received them by means of the  Arabians  who procured them from  India  by their commerce on the  Red sea  or  Persian gulph  and sold them for ornaments to the turbans of the great officers of the  Janissaries Belon  first took notice of them and credulously believed them to have been the  Phoenix  in one place he supposes them to have been the  Rhyntaces  he justly describes them as forming a vast mass of feathers issuing from a small body out of which the  Arabians  had extricated the flesh which agrees with the usual method of preparation  Nicholas de Nicholai  actually gives the figure of a captain of  Janissaries  ornamented with its plumes  Gesner  is the first who caused this bird to be engraven and his figure and that of  Clusius  was long copied by succeeding naturalists  FEW birds are more circumscribed in their limits than the Birds of Paradise They are confined within the  Papua  islands and that of  New Guinea  and are found only from Latitude ° south to Lat ° north of the equator and between Longitude and  SUCH is the general view of these wonderful birds  COMMON  The  Paradisea Apoda  Lin Syst Pl Enl  of which there are two varieties called the greater and lesser birds of Paradise chiefly inhabit the  Arrou  isles  Edw Latham ii  They are natives of both  New Guinea  as well as of these islands are supposed to breed in the first  and to reside there during the wet monsoon but retire to the  Arrou  isles about a hundred and forty miles to the east during the dry or western monsoons In the east monsoon they moult their long feathers but recover them in the west They always migrate in flocks of thirty or forty and have a leader which the inhabitanss of  Arrou  call the  King  he is said to be black to have red spots and to fly far above the flock which never desert him but settle where he settles They constantly avoid flying with the wind which ruffles and blows their loose plumage over their heads and often forces them down to the ground from which they are unable to rise without some advantage hard showers of rain are equally destructive to them When they are surprised with a strong gale they instantly soar to a higher region beyond the reach of the tempest there they float at ease in the serene sky on their light flowing feathers or pursue their journey in security during their flight they cry like starlings but in the distress of a storm blowing in their rear they express it by a note resembling the croaking of ravens  WHEN they alight it is on the highest trees the  king  taking the lead they prefer the  varinga parvifolia  Rumph iii tab  on the berries of which these birds and various sorts of parrots feed some say that they feed on nutmegs on butterflies and even small birds the strength of their claws favors that opinion yet that circumstance may also be requisite to birds which are always to live perched The natives of  Arrou  watch their arrival and either shoot them with blunt arrows or catch them with birdlime or  nooses when taken they will make a vigorous resistance and defend themselves stoutly with their bills they are instantly killed exenterated and the breast bone taken out then dried with smoke and sulphur and exported to  Banda  where they are sold for half a rixdollar but on the spot for a spike nail or a bit of old iron They are exported to all parts of  India  and to  Persia  to adorn the turbans of people of rank and even the trappings of the horses as I have before mentioned they even reach  Turkey  In the spring of they formed an additional ornament to the elegant head dress of the British fair E    No birds have ever had so much fable mixed with their history it was believed that they remained always floating on the spicy  Indian  air and of course not to be in want of legs or feet of which they were supposed to be destitute that when they wanted to sleep they hung themselves by their two long feathers to the boughs of a tree that they performed the act of love during their flight and that even ovation and exclusion of the young was discharged in that element the male receiving the egg in an orifice nature had given it for that purpose that they lived on the dew of Heaven and had no evacuation like other mortal birds From their being so much conversant in the higher regions the  Portuguese  styled them  Passaros da sol  or  Sparrows  of the  Sun  the islanders  Manucodewata  or the birds of  God  and most of the  Europeans  name them the  birds of Paradise  So happily did the opinion work on the little kings of the isles that seeing them descend as it often happened dead from the heavenly regions they became converts to the truth of the immortality of the soul  THE next that may be supposed to belong to this genus  KING  is chiefly brought from  Arrou  and  Sopeloo  It is called the  King  of the  Birds of Paradise  and by the people of  Arrou Wowi Wowi  Our classical ornithologists style it after  Linnaeus Paradisea regia Le roi des oiseaux de paradis  Sonnerat tab Pl Enl Edw tab iii  I do not know what title it has to  King  for it never associates with any other species never aspires to lofty trees but flits solitary from bush to bush to feed on berries It is supposed to migrate to  Arrou  in the dry monsoon and to make its nest in  New Guinea  It is taken in snares of  Gumatty  or with birdlime prepared from the juice of  Sukkom  bread fruit or  artocarpus communis  NOTWITHSTANDING voyagers give an exact locality to the different species of these birds I cannot readily assent to the opinion as the whole extent of the residence of the genus is so small that it is improbable but that each of them must at times trespass beyond their pretended bounds  THE  Arrou  islands have been under the jurisdiction of  Banda  since the year they are low flat and well peopled with blacks It was reckoned that in there were about two hundred and forty christians Off one of the islands is a fishery of small pearl but the chief trade is  Sago  and slaves which they kidnap in  New Guinea  and sell to the  Dutch  at  Banda  I AM so deficient in materials that I must hasten to the next isles or those of  Banda  let me premise that the intervening expanse of water has sparingly scattered over it several small islands distant from each other one of them called by  Dampier  the  Burning Isle  and was when he passed by it in  Voyages iii p  a most fierce volcano  THE  Banda  islands lie in about Lat ° ′  BANDA ISLANDS  south and are included under the general name of the  Spicy Islands  Their names are  Gonnipo Banda  which gives name to the whole group  Lontare Poolaway  and  Pooloroon  These and the neighboring  Moluccas  were discovered at the same time in by  Francis Serrano  and  Antonio D'Abreau  who were sent on that service by the great  Albuquerque  they spent some years in the discovery The  Portuguese  to deter other nations from paying attention to these sources of wealth and luxury gave out that they were scarcely approachable by reason of the shallowness of the seas  Pigafetta  disproved the report by sounding the coasts and finding a depth of a hundred and two hundred fathoms  THE  Chinese  were the first who had made themselves masters of these islands  CHINESE  The  Javans  and the  Malayan  Moors next succeeded and with them were introduced the religion and language of  Mahomet  which in these and the  Moluccas  found their most remote but wonderful extent  PORTUGUESE  The  Portuguese  arrived after them at the period just mentioned  Argensola  represents some of the kings of these little islands as incredibly powerful and asserts that they could collectively raise above a hundred and twenty thousand fighting men The prince of  Ternate  was the most potent he was lord of seventytwo isles  THE  Portuguese  by violence or treachery established themselves in these valuable possessions The  Spaniards  indeed laid  clame to them under the false pretence that they were first discovered by  Magellan  the  Spanish  fleet in the reign of  Charles  V sailed to the  Moluccas  the  Portuguese  were engaged in war with the king of  Ternate  and the monarchs of  Tidor  and  Gilolo  who sided with the  Spaniards  but about that time  John  III thought proper to make his brotherinlaw  Charles  a present of three hundred and fifty thousand ducats on condition the  Portuguese  should remain in quiet possession till the sum was repaid Notwithstanding this  Charles  offered them to sale to  Henry  VII but the bargain never took place  IT is ridiculous to consider that  Charles  V clamed these islands by virtue of the famous line of  demarcation  by which Pope  Alexander  VI in divided by his infallible power between the  Spaniards  and  Portuguese  all countries which should be discovered on the side of a certain meridian drawn by his holiness from pole to pole allotting one part to  Ferdinand  and  Isabel  of  Spain  the other to  John  II of  Portugal  and their successors  Osorio ii  This  Alexander  did in hopes of preserving peace in the world but the effect proved the reverse I must refer to  Osorio  and others who have treated on the subject  THE  Dutch  DUTCH  after some unsuccesful attempts for the discovery of a northeast passage to the  East Indies  determined to follow the course of the enterprizing  Portuguese  In they resolved to share in the rich adventure four ships with no more than two hundred and fortynine men sailed from the  Texel  on  April  d they saw the Cape of  Good Hope  on  August  th touched at  Madagascar  and on  January  st reached the streights  of  Sunda  Near  Bantam  they met with their antient enemies the  Portuguese  who had long been master of these seas they instantly attacked some of their merchant ships one of which burnt by the  Portuguese  themselves had fifty tons of cloves on board another which they took had twenty this foretaste of the riches of the islands whetted their resolution of pursuing their plan and of supplanting the tyrants in this invaluable branch of commerce The second voyage was performed under the conduct of the great  Heemskirk  in From  Bantam  he sailed with four ships to the very  Moluccas  found the most cordial reception from the monarchs of  Amboina  and  Ternate  and returned laden with cloves nutmegs mace pepper and cinnamon fleet followed fleet the  Dutch  attacked the  Portuguese  in all parts of the islands and never desisted till they had in completed the conquests of both the  Banda  and  Molucca  islands At this period  Portugal  was subject to the crown of  Spain  In  Philip  III determined to recover these distant territories he sent his orders to  Don Pedro D'Acunha  a gallant officer governor of the  Philippines  to take the command of the expedition He sailed with a numerous fleet attacked  Ternate  took that island and in a short space reduced the whole to his master This conquest was but short lived the  Dutch  returned in great force and favoured by the  reguli  of the islands repossessed themselves of the whole and to this day remain entire masters of what is justly styled the  gold mines of Holland  they immediately destroyed every nutmegtree they could find on the adjacent islands built small forts on every one that lay to the south and to the west as out posts to prevent the access of other  European  nations  executed with the most cruel rigour all smugglers and to this day became sole masters of the trade in nutmegs mace cloves and cinnamon  THE  English  visited the  Spice Islands  in the year  ENGLISH  in their first voyage to the  East Indies  Sir  James Lancaster  during his stay at  Bantam  Purchas vol i p  fitted out a small pinnace and furnishing it with such articles as he thought would be acceptable to the natives dispatched it to the  Moluccas  under the command of Mr  William Starky  The pinnace returned after the departure of  Lancaster  and forwarded to  England  the first cargo of nutmegs and cloves it ever received in a bottom of its own  IN our second voyage the fleet was commanded by Sir  Henry Middleton  knight who in after a month's stay at  Bantam  sailed directly for  Amboina  leaving two ships to take in a cargo of pepper From  Amboina  the admiral went to the  Moluccas  and dispatched the other ship commanded by Mr  Colthurst  to  Banda  we are not told the circumstance of this voyage any more than that Sir  Henry  returned to  England  and that the  Dragon  his principal ship lost by sickness fortythree out of fiftythree men between  Bantam  and the Cape  William Keeling  commander of the expedition which was made in was the first who began a regular commerce with the  Spicy Islands  He reached  Banda  on  February  th delivered his monarch's  James  the First's letter and presents at  Nera  the capital town and obtained leave to establish a factory at  Puloway  he actually built a house but the jealous  Hollanders  pulled it down when  Keeling  returned to  England  with a rich  cargo of spices We persisted in our lucrative voyages and notwithstanding the numberless obstructions we met with from the  Dutch  formed a settlement in these islands The natives of  Banda  on a quarrel with the  Dutch  by a formal instrument made a resignation of their island to us and those of  Lantore  did the same In  Puloroon  and  Puloway  were also added to the  British  dominions and our peaceful monarch assumed the title of king of those islands he also received the most friendly epistles from his brother kings of  Ternate Tidor  and  Bantam  The accounts given by old  Purchas  vol i from p to are well worth the reader's perusal These cessions were confirmed by treaty between  James  I and the  Dutch  in notwithstanding which at the very conclusion of a treaty they determined on our expulsion They attacked with a strong force  Lantore  and  Poleroon  they ravaged the islands seized our factories and magazines and after stripping the factors naked first whipped them loaded them with irons and after all massacred them by flinging them over the walls and in the most savage manner dragged their remains in chains through the streets The quantity of spices seized by these barbarians will serve to give an idea of the extent of our commerce they found in our magazines twentythree thousand pounds of mace and a hundred and fifty thousand pounds of nutmegs The narrative of these proceedings are preserved in the eighth volume of  Churchhill  's Collection but it is too horrible to be repeated and the apology of the  Dutch  so futile and so false as not to merit the recital  Cromwell  in had the glory of compelling the  Dutch  to restore to us the island of  Poleroon  and to make ample  satisfaction for their barbarities at  Amboina  As to  Poleroon  it was kept but a very short time for in in the inglorious reign of his profligate successor it was taken from us by a single ship  THE Abbé  Raynal  gives the following description of these islands "They seem" says he  Vol i p    to have been thrown up by the sea and may with reason be supposed to be the effect of some subterraneous fire Lofty mountains the summits of which are lost in the clouds enormous rocks heaped one upon another horrid and deep caverns torrents which precipitate themselves with extreme violence volcanoes perpetually announcing impending destruction such are the phaenomena that give rise to this idea or assist in confirming it  By the sequel of my account it will appear that the Abbé's description and inference seem to have been very well founded  THIS is the general view of them I collect the following particulars of those of  Banda  the  Moluccas  I reserve till my arrival on their coasts the first called  Gonnapo  or  Goenongapi  GOENONGAPI  in emitted fire smoke and cinder and had perhaps long before left neither woods fruits or water The eruptions have been at times so violent as to carry desolation to part of the neighboring island of  Banda  overwhelming the woods and greatest trees and to fling stones of three or four tons weight from one island to the other Even in the last year we are informed that it made a very considerable cruption In the Phil Trans Abridg  Vol ii p  is an account of a most horrible eruption of this mountain in  November  attended with noises like the discharge of artillery It cast up such a quantity of stones as  entirely to fill a noted fishing place in the neighboring sea of the depth of forty fathoms so as to leave it entirely dry The same volume fully accounts for the appearance of these islands and the  Banda  so graphically described by the  French  Abbé In the year and several other islands as if by consent raged with volcanic fury The mountains of  Celebes Sorea Ternate Banda  and  Neyra  at one time cast up fire lava ashes cinders and boiling water There was no approaching the water by reason of the excessive heat In  Sorea  the ground sunk in and discovered a great lake  A fiery deluge fed  With everburning sulphur unconsum'd  Which spreading farther and farther threatening the whole island terrified the inhabitants so much that they unanimously transported themselves to  Banda  leaving their moveables behind for want of vessels All these islands are subject to terrible earthquakes which affect the sea so greatly as particularly to endanger the ships lying at anchor in the fine harbor between this island and  Banda  I am not certain that  Goenong  is inhabited since the dreadful eruption  Banda  is defended by a strong castle The name of the capital is  Nera  A powerful garrison is kept in this island it being the seat of government notwithstanding it is not above twelve leagues in circumference  Lontoir  LONTOIR  the largest of all the group is inaccessible on most parts by reason of its lofty precipitous shores yet the  Dutch  have given it the additional defence of a castle It has not a tree on it but which bears fruit and is particularly productive of nutmegs  Pulo aya  or  Puloway  says my old informant  Humphrey Fitzherbert  Purchas i    is the Paradise of all the rest entermitting pleasure with profit There is not a tree on that island but the nutmeg and other delicate fruits of superfluitie and withall full of pleasant walkes so that the whole countrey seemes a contriued orchard with varieties They haue none but raine water which the keep in jarres and cisternes or fetch it frome the abovenamed islands which is their only defect The sea shore is so steepe that it seemeth Nature meant to reserue this island particularly to herselfe There is but one place about the whole island for a ship to anchor in and that so dangerous that he that letteth fall his anchor seldome seeth the weighing of it again besides hee incurreth the imminent dangers of his ship  Poloroon  or more properly  Poeloron  is the last  POLOROON  These islands are the antient seats of the nutmegs  NUTMEGS  as the  Moluccas  were of the cloves At first they grew spontaneously on most of the neighboring isles and possibly we shall have occasion to shew that they spread much farther than is generally known  Marco Polo  Bergeron  speaks of the  Noix d'Inde  and the  des clous de Girosle  or cloves as being found on the island of  Necuram  but where that island stood I am not certain Originally the  Arabs  engrossed this rich trade and conveyed the spices up the  Red Sea  and from thence to  Alexandria  from whence they were  dispersed to all parts of southern  Europe  The general original name of the nutmegtree is  Pata  The  Arabs  called the fruit  Giauzhant  and  Gjeuzottibi  or the  aromatic nut  it was never mentioned but by the later  Greek  writers who named it  and the  Latins nux moschata  so that it was not known till long after the clove We retain the use of them in our dispensatory they are an agreeable aromatic and used as astringents in diarrhaeas and dysenteries even in  India  they are prescribed in the same disorders  Gerard  informs us that in his days they were chewed to correct a bad breath  that it is good against freckles in the face quickeneth the sight strengthens the belly and feeble liver it taketh away the swelling in the spleene stayeth the laske breaketh winde and is good against all cold diseases in the body  IT is often used as an  aphrodisiac  especially among the  Negroes  The  Europeans  in  India  apply it as a philtre in cases of love The eating the raw fruit is often attended with most dangerous consequences idiotcy and even phrenzy ensues and sometimes death This boasted perfumed air which salutes the voyager at great distances from land is pregnant with the most fatal diseases Few countries are so very unwholesome as the  Spicy Islands  As soon as the  Dutch  made themselves masters of the  Banda Islands  they began with extirpating the nutmegtrees and cloves on all those adjacent in some by force in others by employing the natives for hire Some of the princes of the  Moluccas  reduced by wars consented to receive pensions for that purpose the king of  Ternate  had about six thousand pounds a year and the  monarch of  Tidor  about five hundred This treaty has been twice renewed  WHEN the  Dutch  first took possession of the islands they met with some difficulties The natives were impatient of the yoke and killed the Governor  William Verhoeven  as they could not see the justice of having their nutmegwoods robbed by strangers they thought themselves justified in putting to death any thieves they met within their limits but the Captain General the great  Koen  came in force in the year and put a stop to the evil by the radical cure of a general massacre  THE white inhabitants or rather  Creoles  and chiefly the outcasts of the world or refugees of the most abandoned principles often sent here by their relations so that  Banda  itself is called the house of correction These are the colonists who repeopled the island and who get slaves from the neighboring places to cultivate the land Happily the climate is so unhealthy that very few of these exiles we may call them ever return to be a pest to their country or their relations  IN the  Banda  group the nutmeg trees are permitted to grow only on that island  Lontoir  and  Pulo aya  the best are those of  Lontoir  among the lofty and rocky mountains and on the edges of the precipices which makes the gathering of the fruit a work of great danger  Pulo aya  is only two miles long quite flat and so destitute of water either rain or spring that they are obliged to get it from the neighboring isles and preserve it in cisterns yet here grow the loftiest trees and so productive are they that the whole  world might be supplied from hence  GARDENS OF NUTMEGS  The island seems one beautiful garden of nutmeg trees  THE trees are loaden with fruit the whole year either mature or ripening but it is gathered only at certain times The principal harvest is in the middle of the rainy season or in part of  July  and  August  there is another in  November  and a third in  March  and  April  The nuts are carried home and cleansed and the mace carefully taken off with a knife and exposed to the sun to be dried The exterior coat is thick like that of a walnut the mace is the immediate covering of the nutmeg and possesses the same virtues The oil is a wellknown article in our shops  AFTER some time the nutmegs are divided into three heaps the first consists of the finest and largest which are sent to the  European  markets The next is reserved for that of  India  and the third which is composed of the damaged nuts is never sent abroad but reserved for the oil which is expressed from them  THE green or unripe nuts are frequently preserved with sugar and disposed of in all parts of  India  and  China  and even some are sent to  Europe  THERE are besides the genuine species six others of the wild kind called  Palae  with some distinguishing epithet and also  Palalae  After saying that these trees are of little or no use but for the wood I refer to  Rumphius  who  Vol ii p  has given descriptions and plates of the several sorts  THE references to this plant among the best botanical writers are as follows  Nux myristica femina Clus Exot    Nux  Moschata Gerard    Bauhin Pinax    Nux Myristica Rumph Amb  ii p tab  Myristica officinalis Linn Supp    Le Muscadier Sonnerat N Guinée  p tab and nutmeg tree  Woodville Medic Bot  ii tab  NUTMEGS are the food of a variety of birds  FOOD OF BIRDS  such as Cockatoos different sorts of pigeons  Jaar vogels  or the wreathed  Hornbills Latham  i The pigeons are generally supposed to be the disseminators of these valuable spices and have been absurdly imagined as the only instruments of their propagation but the nuts grow equally well by the common method of sowing The pigeons pull off the external coat before they devour the nut the mace is digested but the kernel passes through them entire such as falls among the thick grass is sure to succeed By this accident the trees are spread over all the islands and some which are very distant so as to elude the utmost diligence of the  Dutch  to effect the total extirpation of the nutmeg  THE  Columba aenea  of  Linnaeus Pl Enl    NUTMEG PIGEON  or the  Nutmeg Pigeon  of  Latham  iv and  var A    Sonnerat  tab is the first species The whole upper part of the body is green glossed with gold and copper A bird of this kind perhaps a variety or perhaps of a different sex was shot by  John Reinhold Forster  on the island of  Rotterdam  with two undigested nutmegs in its craw a proof how remotely this spice may be disseminated what folly it is therefore in the  Dutch  to endeavour to consine it to the narrow bounds of the  Mollucca  or  Banda  groups when the very fowls of the air are able to baffle so unjust a monopoly  THE next the  White Latham    Sonnerat N Guinée  tab is wholly of a pure white except the greater feathers of the wings and the tail which are black  LET me question whether from its name the  Aromatic Pigeon Latham  iv  Pl Enl  does not feed on these pretious fruits and contribute likewise to their dispersion  Amboina  is about leagues to the northwest of the  Banda  isles  AMBOINA  This is in respect to cloves what those are in respect to nutmegs The  Dutch  have made it the great and sole plantation of that valuable spice They destroy with the same zeal all that they can find on the islands within their reach or bribe or compel the natives to do it for them The governor of  Amboina  makes annually in great state the tour of the islands with a fleet of perhaps fifty sail of  Corocoros  the vessels of the country to enforce obedience and to shew his power to the people and the inhabitants of the ten islands dependent on it  SOME gold dust several years ago was observed to be washed down by the mountain torrents  GOLD  it was traced to the source and the mine discovered I am not able to give my readers the consequences nor the present state of the produce This island has also its volcano The  Brimstone  mountain called  Wawani  in made a dreadful eruption  Amboina  lies in Lat ° ′ south and is divided very nearly in two by a long bay which with the sea contracts it into two peninsulas joined at the eastern end by so very narrow and sandy an isthmus that small vessels may easily be dragged over The larger or more northern portion is called  Hitoe  the other  Ley Timor  The whole island is full of mountains covered not only with woods of clove trees but with the richest productions of  Flora  for variety and singularity of vegetation no part of the torrid zone can in even far greater space vie with it in numbers and elegancy The whole length of the greater portion of this double island I may call it is seventy miles The intervening space of water is a most secure and beautiful meandering bay with numberless streams falling from the hills a blessing enjoyed by every side of the island  Dampier  Voyages iv p  tells us that the sea surrounding it is a hundred fathom deep the bottom sandy and unfit for anchoring except at the  Ley  at the west end where it may be done in twenty fathoms  Amboina  was discovered by  Antonio d'Abreu  Lonquêtes des Portugais vol iii p    WHEN DISCOVERED  about the year It is said to have been even then peopled with  Malayans  and possibly some of the  Aborigines  represented as a most barbarous race Their present religion is  Mahometanism  mixed with  Paganism  By the wooden print given at p of the old edition of  Heemskirk  's Voyage some of the people had no more than a wrapper round their middle others were cloathed in long garments and the military in a shirt and sort of short breeches Their weapons were spears scymetars poisoned darts blown out of tubes and even matchlocks as early as the year which last they probably got from the  Portuguese  their first masters their defensive arms were shields very long and narrow  Nieuhoff  gives a print of an  Amboinese  soldier in the  Dutch  service at  Batavia  many  Amboinese  are settled there and are represented as a most dangerous and turbulent people  THE conquest of  Amboina  by the  Portuguese  arose from this circumstance  CONQUERED BY THE PORTUGUESE  In  Galoun  governor of  Ternate  had observed great numbers of small vessels resorting from  Java Macassar  Banda  and even this island to the  Moluccas  for the sake of the cloves This trade he resolved to suppress sitted out his fleet and by his admiral defeated that of the  Indians  landed and forced the natives to submit to his will and in the year the sovereignty of  Amboina  was vested in the  Portuguese  by the king of the island  Stephen de Sa  built a fort there in the same year and his countrymen kept possession till about when the  Dutch  made themselves masters of  Amboina  and of all the  Spicy Islands  The  English  laid in their clame for a share of the commerce and after many disputes in a treaty was signed between the two nations stipulating that the  Moluccas Amboina  and the  Banda  isles should be common to both that the  English  should have one third of the produce and the  Dutch  two at a fixed price and that each should contribute to the defence of the islands in proportion to the benefit received The inquisitive reader may find the whole of this curious treaty in  Rymer  's  Foedera  Vol xvii p  It has often been remarked that after a treaty so well calculated to establish lasting peace and harmony between the two companies nothing could interrupt those blessings The reverse took place The  Dutch  actuated by their insatiable avarice determined by the most diabolical means to free themselves from all competitors  MASSACRE OF THE ENGLISH  They forged a plot of the  English  against their lives and liberties but such a plot that none but idiots could have been supposed to have projected The charge was that ten factors and eleven foreign soldiers were to seize on the castle garrisoned by two hundred men A foolish question asked by an  Indian  soldier as to the strength of the place  was the foundation of the tragedy He was seized and put to the most exquisite tortures that hell itself could invent and in his agonies answered the artful interrogatories in the manner the Fiscal could wish Our countrymen and the eleven foreign soldiers underwent the same horrid torments which were continued at intervals during eight days The means are too dreadful for the humane pen to recite or the humane ear to bear The constancy of the poor sufferers was often overcome they made such answers as they thought would soonest free them from the rack and which they recanted as soon as the torture ceased They were then recalled to their torments At length the record of examination was read and the greater part were relieved by a speedy execution those who were reprieved could drag but a miserable life with mangled bodies or dislocated limbs The sufferers before death were confronted with each other  English  with  Indians  both bewailed their infirmity for accusing the other under the pressure of torture and mutually exchanged forgiveness A full account is given of this horrid transaction by the ingenious  Campbel  Vol i p  in his collection of travels we could well excuse his speaking to our eyes by a most horrible print The foreign soldiers  Vol ii p    from good authority he supposes to have been  Koreans  an adventurous naval people even in that early time  THE name of the castle after this cruel deed  VICTORIA CASTLE  was changed to  Victoria Dampier  was shewn the place into which the bodies of our unhappy countrymen were thrown for the savage  Dutch  did not think them worthy of the rites of burial The natives who  live in the mountains are a brave race of men disdain a dependent life and never fail to sacrifice the  Dutch  to their fury whenever they make their descent from their heights  BY means of the  Arabs  CLOVES  the clove was introduced into  Europe  by the common passage over the  Isthmus  of  Suez  but before their conquests towards the  Indian Archipelago  it was carried to the ports of western  Hindoostan  and from thence by  Roman  merchant ships to  Myoshormus  the great  emporium  on the  Red Sea  I cannot but think that the clove was early known and that the  Garyophyllon  of  Pliny  Lib xii c  was the spice which he might truly say  "tradunt in Indico luco id gigni Advehitur odoris gratia"  The  Romans  were particularly fond of aromatic perfumes  Pliny  may not be over accurate in his description but he is exact in place and property and the name except in one letter agrees entirely with the  Latin  retained to this day  THE native place of the clove is said by  Rumphius  to have been  Machian  one of the  Molucca  islands which we shall have occasion soon to mention The  Dutch  thought proper to confine the growth of them to  Amboina  and to extirpate them in every other island in the manner we have related There are none here growing wild but all are raised from the seed and disposed of in plantations They are also disseminated and propagated by the pigeons  Hornbills  and  Casuary  in the same manner as the nutmegs Of quadrupeds hogs and deer are found in this island  No country was ever so happy in a Florist as  Amboina  OF RUMPHIUS  The celebrated  George Everard Rumphius  made it his residence a  great number of years He was born in and became doctor of physic in the university of  Hanover  He went over to this island in character of con  l and merchant and applied his leisure moments to the study of botany but by the vast fruits of his labors he must be supposed to have dedicated his whole time to that pursuit Buy his continual researches after plants and other objects of natural history on this burning soil he had at the age of fortythree the misfortune of losing his sight Notwithstanding this he persevered in his pursuits and being deprived of his visual faculties acquired that of distinguishing plants by the senses of feeling and smell He formed a  Hortus Siccus  in ten folio volumes and in dedicated them to the governor and council of the  East India  Company who deposited it in the  India  house of  Amsterdam  with them he probably deposited his description of fishes and other animals of the island His botanical labors were not printed during his life they had the good fortune to fall into the hands of that able naturalist Doctor  John Burman  who published the first volume of the celebrated  Herbarium Amboinense  in and completed the whole by the year It consists of six folio volumes and an  Auctuarium  which are illustrated with seven hundred plates relative to the subject besides two portraits one of  Rumphius  in the sixtyeighth year of his age in a state of blindness He is represented feeling the plants and shells placed before him on a table the other portrait is of his publisher Doctor  Burman  I do not know for certain the time of his death it probably was at  Amboina  for he dates the dedication of his  Hortus Siccus  from the castle of  Victoria  in the d year of his age  GOVERNOR  Loten  gave a curious anecdote in respect to the fate of his drawings and description of the fishes of the island There is reason to suppose that they were sent into the world in in a work published by  Francis Valentyn  a  Dutch  clergyman who had resided in the  Molucca  and  Bonda  islands Baron  Imhoff  governor general of the  Indies  communicated to Mr  Loten  his suspicions that  Valentyn  got the materials out of the  India  house by means of his soninlaw who was first clerk to the secretary of the company these  Valentyn  basely applied to his own use not daring to make the acknowlegement certain it is they never could be found notwithstanding the most diligent search has been made after them  Valentyn  's work was published under the title of  India Orientalis antiqua et nova  in five volumes folio The figures of the fishes lie under the imputation of being fictitious from the extravagancy of their forms but I am told it is far from being the case nature having sported wonderfully in the construction of those of the  Amboinese  seas  THE other works of the great  Rumphius  were the  imagines piscium testaceorum  first printed at  Leyden  in and reprinted in The figures are finely executed He might have added  crustaceorum  for there are besides in that work numbers of the lobster and crab kind No sort of letterpress attends this work except a catalogue of the subjects with the names in different languages especially the  Indian  From the immensity of his labors he justly left behind him the title of the  Pliny  of the  Indies  THE west end of  Ceram  is at a very small distance from  Amboina  CERAM  That island stretches across the channel from east to  west a length of about eighty leagues  Ceram  and  Buero  divide nearly in two equal parts the  Spicy sea  this the geographers will find to be a new name but I think fit to distinguish by that epithet all the space which comprehends the  Banda  isles the  Molucca  the  Papuan  with  Ceram  and  Buero  the central isles bounded on the south by the  Timorian  chain on the west by  Celebes  and on the east by  New Guinea  The inhabitants of its water of the air and the vegetation of the islands are all most singular which make it merit a title of distinction from all the rest of the  Indian  ocean The breadth of  Ceram  is inconsiderable the land near the sea is low swampy and wooded within it rises into mountains of great height It is wonderful how little I can collect concerning this great island Mr  Forrest  says that it produced clove trees possibly in places inaccessible to the  Dutch  On the authority of  Rumphius  Herb Amb i p  we may say that there are vast forests of the  Sago tree  on this island the pith is prepared there into bread and is exported to other places in great quantities let me add from  Dampier  Voy i  that it is much used in  Mindanao  and our honest traveller gives us the process of preparing that useful viand  Manipa  and  Keylan  are two small islands but very lofty  MANIPA AND KEYLAN  seated a little to the west of the western end of  Ceram  In the time of  Dampier  they were well inhabited by  Malayes  on the first was a  Dutch  corporal and six soldiers employed to cut down the clove trees On  Manipa  grew abundance of those valuable trees and also of rice both which were sent in quantities by the little  Dutch  garrison to  Amboina  THE island of  Buero  is a few leagues to the west of  Manipa  and  Keylan  BUERO  the sea round it is of a vast depth from whence the shore rises gradually and surrounds the whole island like a steep wall The mountains seemingly rise to the very sky and in some parts are so lofty as to aspire above the clouds and may sometimes be seen at the distance of twentyeight leagues The circumference of  Buero  is about sixty leagues near the coasts it is extremely well wooded and productive of most of the tropical trees a green ebony and an iron wood is mentioned among them The ground in general is very fertile but like the other islands much subject to earthquakes  THE inhabitants are almost black and both sexes go naked excepting when a wrapper covers their waists they were nominally subject to the king of  Ternate  but in the  Dutch  built a fort and compelled all the natives to live about the bay of  Keyel  in fourteen villages neatly built of cane they also compelled them to cut down and burn the woods and turn them into fields gardens and orchards before that time they lived in the most wretched hovels They bemoan their dead relations with great lamentations but after the corpse is buried they make great rejoicings they line the graves with brick and cover them with clay and stones  IN the mountains

mistake for it the  Aethiopian  which is found in the last  Lib viii c    Pliny  had certainly heard of it for he describes some hogs found in  India  with four horns  In India Cubitales dentium flexus gemini ex rostro totidem a fronte seu vituli cornua exeunt Pilus Aereo similis agrestibus caeteris niger  As to the  of  Aelian de Nat Anim  lib xvii c it certainly is the  Aethiopian  The species appears to me to be limited to this island and perhaps is the most local of any of the greater quadrupeds I am decidedly of opinion that it is found wild in  Buero  only It may possibly be domesticated on some adjacent isles As to those of  New Guinea  the  Papuan  isles and the  Moluccas  I cannot find sufficient authority for their existence in those places Mr  Forrest  never speaks of this singular animal he gives figures of those of the  Papuan  isles but not the least intimation of their differing from other hogs They are made in their bodies like our common hog and have not the elegant deerlike form given it by  Nieuhoff  They are sometimes kept tame in the  Indian  isles live in herds have a very quick scent feed on herbs and leaves of trees never range gardens like other swine their flesh well tasted When pursued and driven to extremities rush into the sea swim very well and even dive and pass thus from isle to isle in the forest often rest their head by hooking  their upper tusks on some boughs Their tusks from their form useless in fight  OVER the upper portion of the  Spicy sea  are scattered several islands  UPPER PART OF THE SPICY SEA  which extend rather irregularly from the isle of  Celebes  to the coast of  New Guinea  I have now before me M  D'Anville  's map and that of our countryman captain  Forrest  who with infinite hazard examined or past by most of the islands of this part of the sea for the patriotic design of procuring the nutmeg tree for the benefit of our country I shall add his names to those of the  French  geographer as more familiar to us The most westerly on the coast of  Celebes  is  Bangy  then appears grouped  Xulla Xulla bessy  and a larger the  Xulla Mangoli  of  D'Anville  and two or three lesser isles Farther to the east in Lat ° ′ south is the long island of  Ouby  with the little ones of  Tappa Mya Lyong  and  Gomman  near its coasts To the east is  Mixoal  or  Mysol  a triangular isle of some extent To the northwest is the small isle of  Kanari  and north of that are the very small isles of  Polo Pisang Bo  and  Popo  Ouby  is one of the larger isles  OUBY  The  Datch  have a small fort on the west side the inhabitants of this island are fugitive slaves from  Ternate  and other places who have no communication with any people except some  Buggesses  who come in their prows to buy the

east of  Ouby  MIXAOL  is the triangular island of  Mixaol  of a moderate height even at top  Ib tab  and the shore bold On the south side is the secure harbor of  Efbe  EFBE HARBOR  in Lat ° ′ south with several picturesque islands off the entrance one in particular named  Crown  island topt with wood  Mysol  is well wooded and water is got there without any difficulty The village of  Linty  consists of about thirteen houses  VILLAGE OF LINTY  built in the water upon posts The island is but very thinly inhabited the natives reported that the  birds of Paradise  came there in flocks from the eastward settled on the trees and were caught with birdlime  THE  Kanari  islands are a little to the northwest of the western end of  Mysol  KANARI ISLANDS  they also are of a moderate height and tolerably even  Ib tab  covered with wood and the sides in some places clifty They take their name from the timber being chiefly of that turpentine kind called by  Rumphius  Vol ii p tab  Kanari  He

little isles  BO AND POPO  lying in the clear  expanse of water north of the  Kanari  isles in Lat ° ′ south They are well inhabited and produce plenty of fish salt and coco nuts and the  Kima Chama  Almost contiguous to  Popo  are nine or ten small low isles said to be well inhabited and the residence of a  Rajah  DUE north of  Oubi  are the celebrated  Molucca  islands  MOLUCCA ISLANDS  which form a chain from the little isle of  Seland  in Lat ° ′ south to  Ternate  in about Lat ° ′ north Within that space are contained the immense treasures of cloves in possession of the  Dutch  Their history and fate are so nearly similar to those of  Banda  and so intermixed that we have included them in our account of those islands The names of the  Molucca  group are  Ternate Tidor Motir Matchian  and  Batchian  M  D'Anville  makes these rich islands comprehend the whole from  Moratay  or  Morty  at the north of  Gilolo  quite to the  Timorian  chain but the above is the true definition of the  Molucca  isles  THE small isle of  Selang  may be spoken of as an appurtenance to  Batchian  ISLE OF SELANG  it is nearly united to its southern end by a coral reef which has in the middle a gap of a hundred fathoms in width and twelve in depth with a muddy bottom on each side of the reef is a safe harbor The island is moderately high affords good water and produces nutmeg trees of a great height Mr  Forrest  saw the fruit lying on the ground and in a state of vegetation He gives in plate a plan of the harbor and a view of part of the island and of the high wooded hills of  Labukat  on the isle of  Batchian  Batchian  is the largest of the  Moluccas  BATCHIAN  It is governed by a sultan the least dependent on the  Dutch  of any of these  Reguli  He is sovereign of  Ouby Ceram  and  Goram  an isle in Lat ° ′ to the southeast of  Ceram  So prevalent is the  Mahometan  religion that there are on this little spot thirteen mosques this is the most castern extent of the religion of the arch impostor The inhabitants of all the sultan's dominions are  Mahometans  they paid the highest respect to  Tuan Hadjee  pilot of Mr  Forrest  's vessels because he was a descendant from an  Arabian Scherif  So zealous are they in their religion that they always go to sea with the  Alcoran  and have a place set apart for their devotions called the  Koran  as was the case in Mr  Forrest  's vessel  Lasitau  Vol iv p  says that there was a total conversion of this island  MOLUCCAS CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY  and the rest of the  Moluccas  to Christianity by the labors of  St Francis de Xavier  the sultan himself was baptized but these changes produced civil wars for whole villages soon abjured the new faith the  Portuguese  as may be imagined took an active part in behalf of the believers It is said that as late as the year the king of  Ternate  was a Christian but those of  Tidor  and  Batchian  had relapsed into  Mahometanism  These three monarchs firmly believe that their ancestors were the wise men of the East who visited our Savior at  Bethlehem  and who are so well known by the name of the three kings of  Cologne  THE  Portuguese  for a time remained in favor with the natives but unable to bear their habitual tyranny especially what they suffered in united in a general league of all the islands against their oppressors  WE find in  Purchas  Pilgrim i  that the  Dutch  had a castle on this  island in and that the cloves lay three or four inches thick on the ground for want of people to gather them  Batchian  rises to a considerable height swells into waved eminences and in some parts into hills terminating in points and well wooded On the greater part of its coasts as of all the  Moluccas  and other islands in the various  Indian  archipelago are prodigious rocks or coral reefs of infinite variety and beauty  THE  Sooloo  and other fleets which sail annually to cruise among the  Philippines  depend solely for their subsistence on the fish and shell fish which the reefs afford and only lay in some rice and sago bread Mr  Forrest  gives a view in plate of a coral rock off  Batchian  and a man gathering the  Gigantic Chama  Among other shells there represented is a figure of a turbinated one of a great size  I AM uncertain of the number of parts into which this island is divided In the map on the western side is streight  Labuhat  I do not know whether it penetrates quite through On this is fort  Barnevelt  the fortress that awes the  Batchians  A little farther to the north is a great bay  ISLE OF BALLY  with the isle of  Bally  in the middle in Lat ° ′ south it is about two miles round and well supplied with wood and water At the bottom of the bay is a very narrow passage that divides  Batchian  in two the northern division is called the isle of  Mandioly  the residence of the sultan The passage widens considerably towards the west and opens in the streights of  Patientia  which divide this island from the great one of  Gilolo  I think  Mandioly  to be the island  Fitzherbert  in  Purchas  calls old  Bachan  The  Portuguese  and  Spaniards  established garrisons here and formed leagues with the natives but the  Dutch  in expelled them and became successors to their advantages and oppressions  IN  Bissory  harbor in Lat ° ′ south  BISSORY HARBOR  on the western side of the island is excellent anchorage in twelve or fifteen fathoms water The entrance is marked by some elegant little isles with rocky precipitous bases and beautiful rounded wooded heads  Forrest tab  This island gave shelter to Mr  Forrest  for some time when the pilot went on a visit to his relation the sultan  Tuan Hadjee  OFF the northwestern end of  Mandioly  is  Tappa  ISLAND OF TAPPA  a small isle with three large rocks hollowed into caves harboring the swallows which make the delicious edible nests it lies only a few minutes to the north of the equinoctial line Between  Tappa  and the isle  Lalaletta  are the streights of that name  LALALETTA  about a mile and a half long and scarcely forty yards wide with deep water A fragrant smell is wafted from the shores  Tappa  has also that comfort to mariners a delicious pond of fresh water Mr  Forrest  Plate  gives us a view of these islands and rocks On the northwest part is the little snug harbor or cove of  Malaleo  where a ship may lie safe in four fathoms water  HARBOR OF MALALEO  with the cable fastened to trees  DUE north of  Mandioly  in Lat ° ′ north are the  Giaritchas  GIARITCHAS  a cluster of small isles consisting of rocks of a moderate height mixed with trees and about six leagues more to the north is the island of  Matchian  ISLAND OF MATCHIAN  one of the little kingdoms of the  Moluccas  subject to the king of  Ternate  it is of a conic form soars above the clouds and has not in its whole extent a level  place In before the  Dutch  had determined to fix the seat of cloves at  Amboina  they had here three factories and a castle very difficult of access by sea placed on one of the rude cliffs which bound the island and built after they had dispossessed the  Spaniards  in  Motir  is the next  MOTIR  in form but not in size resembling the former  Fitzherbert  says  That  Venus  and voluptuousness had here their habitation  Tidor  is a fine and fertile island  TIDOR  and the seat of a monarch There were violent wars waged between that prince and the king of  Ternate  which the  Europeans  took advantage of In the time of  Charles  V the  Portuguese  and  Spaniards  fought against each other for the possession of these rich spots and with great animosity the people of  Ternate  sided with the first and those of  Tidor  and  Gilolo  with the latter By the cession of the  Moluccas  to the  Portuguese  by  Charles  these seas were for a time left in peace The  Dutch  next arrived in and made a fruitless attack on the  Spaniards  they even suffered a signal defeat in off this very island their admiral  Willert  was defeated and slain and three capital ships taken by the gallant  Spaniard Don Juan de Sylva  but at length by the assistance of the king of  Ternate  the  Hollanders  made themselves masters of the fort and were received by the monarch of  Tidor  in the most friendly manner The island had been four times most barbarously ravaged by the  Portuguese  and  Castilians  The  Tidorians  naturally considered these new  Europeans  as their deliverers from most inveterate enemies Here are twentyfive mosques the chief of which belongs to the sultan As to his temporalities  he possesses besides  Tidor  great part of the south and east of  Gilolo  and clames the  Papuan  isles of  Waygiou Mysol  and  Patenta  Ternate  is the most northern and most important of all the  Moluccas  TERNATE  yet it is not more than eight leagues in circumference Dependent on its monarch are the greatest part of the north of  Gilolo  and of the northeast of  Celebes  the isle of  Morti  that of  Batchian  and  Motir  and several other distant isles such as  Xula Bucro Sanguir  and  Veranulla  near  Amboina  he had even part of  New Guinea  and received a tribute of gold amber and  birds of Paradise  All these  New Guinea  excepted contribute their quota of militia Mr  Forrest  gives  P  a regular list of the number formerly furnished exactly proportioned to their size or population as we do at present in the regulation of the militia to be raised in each  British  county the sum total amounted to The naval power was also very considerable and they and the  Tidorians  have had some wellcontested battles with the  Europeans  Soon after the arrival of the  Portuguese  they burnt at once all the forests of cloves but they speedily revived with as much vigor as ever The  Portuguese  rendered themselves masters of the island and built a strong fort The natives thrice abandoned their country till at length desperate with the oppressions of strangers in they returned in the night and burnt and destroyed even their own habitations  THE  Dutch  on their arrival were received as deliverers but the natives soon discovering that the object of every  European  was the same they took to arms and had a long and severe contest for independency At length the invaders effected by fraud what might have cost too dear to obtain by violence In they wisely entered into a league with the king of  Ternate  and the lesser princes as we have before mentioned This treaty has been twice renewed but in order to enforce the observance three strong forts with suitable garrisons are established in  Ternate  and others in the neighboring isles  THE sultan resides at  Ternate  in great state  SULTAN  but neither he nor the prince of  Tidor  are better than fettered monarchs The  Dutch  pay to him all external respect but at the same time curb him in every commercial attempt If he fits out a  proa  of any size the  Dutch  must know the place of its destination if bound to any distant parts for cloth or other species of merchandize they immediately say they are happy that they can supply him with better from their own magazines and all is at his service if his Majesty continues obstinate they send him a present of the finest callicoes such as they know will be acceptable to his ladies and add bribes to his favorite females who generally divert him from his design if that fails they always obtain leave to send a trusty officer with the vessel for the  Dutch  are studious to avoid an open rupture  Myo  and  Tyfory  are two small isles to the northeast of  Ternate  MYO AND TYFORY  and subject to its sultan the first is in Lat ° ′  Myo  was once inhabited when the  Spaniards  were possessed of the  Moluccas  but the  Dutch  to prevent the smuggling of spices removed the inhabitants It has on it many goats is productive of cloves and possesses a good harbor In old times these isles furnished  their quota of four hundred militia men to the sultan of  Ternate  THE shipping of the  Molucca  isles consists of a sort of vessels called  Corocoro  SHIPPING  with a high arched stem and stern like the point of a half moon the largest are of about ten tons burden On each side of the vessel are outriggers or frames made of timber intersecting each other and extending like wings far over the water of different dimensions according to the size of the  corocoro  The rowers or rather paddlers sit in a most singular manner on the intersections of the suspended frames over the water In a smooth sea they move with vast swiftness Mr  Forrest  gives figures of several of these singular vessels  Plates  but the most magnificent is a  corocoro  of  Banda  represented at p of the old  Dutch  voyages Some have banks of rowers like the  Roman triremes  M  de Pages  Voy vol i p  gives a curious description and figure of one he saw in the  Manilla  isles  No  Chinese  vessel is allowed to come farther than  Macassar  The  Sooloos  vessels trade to  Ternate  but nobody dare send one to  Sooloo  in a word the most jealous attention is paid to the prevention of smuggling any of the pretious products of the isles The  Sooloos  may possibly be the carriers for the  Chinese  their lading consists chiefly of articles from  China  and they bring back rice  suallo  shark fins tortoise shells some small pearls and abundance of  Loeri  parrots  THE religion of the island is that of  Mahomet  here are some mosques one  Dutch  church and the ruins of several once belonging to the  Portuguese  but none are permitted to be used  and the people who call themselves  Portuguese  are now as black as the very natives  IN respect to the nature of the island it consists of very high land abounding with good water which streams from the clouded peaks  Ternate  and every other of the  Moluccas  have their volcanoes in that of  Ternate  burnt in a dreadful manner stones and other matters are frequently cast out of the craters and noises by the force of fancy compared to the crying of many people are almost constantly heard within the bowels of the mountains I think it was at the same time that the mountains  Kemas  or the  two brothers  in the district of  Manado  in the isle of  Celebes  a part correspondent with  Ternate  were blown up with a dreadful noise the sound like that of thunder reached  Ternate  attended with great darkness and the tremendous convulsions of an earthquake Through all these chains of islands even to  Banda  are possibly chambered galleries which convey the train from isle to isle whenever the great Author of Nature directs those awful

extremely numerous  FISHES  the first very singular in their forms the last of great beauty  THE large island of  Gilolo  or  Halamahera  is not classed among the  Moluccas  but lies nearly contiguous to them  GILOLO  and extends north and south from Lat ° ′ north to Lat ° ′ south The equator passes over the lower part The western side is straight and runs parallel with those islands and at the southern end finishes opposite to  Batchian  but at the northern extends very far beyond  Ternate  On the east side is a branch that points due east and from the base of that another due north leaving between it and the western extent of the island a bay extremely narrow but of a vast length penetrating above half of the length of the whole  Dampier  Voy i  reckons this among the low islands of the  Indian  seas yet in the interior parts it rises into very lofty horns or peaks  IT is said to have been once governed by one sovereign a  Scherif  from  Mecca  We have mentioned that the Sultans of  Ternate  and  Tidor  now are masters of a considerable part of  Gilolo  the chief towns are  Maba Weda  and  Patanay  The last is at the extremity of the eastern branch it stands on what is called  Patany Hook  a point in Lat ° ′ north  PATANY HOOK  three miles in circumference  of great strength faced with precipices flat at top containing many houses and gardens and inaccessible unless by ladders  THIS island abounds with oxen buffaloes goats deer and wild hogs but scarcely any sheep  THE natives have a turn to manufactures but it is checked by the  Dutch  notwithstanding this they import a great deal of cotton yarn from  Balli  and the  Buggess  country which they fabricate into cloth  IN  Gilolo  SAGO TREE  in all the  Moluccas  and other islands of that district and even in  New Guinea  grows the  Rima  or  Bread Fruit  I have before mentioned that useful tree the  Cycas circinalis Sago  or  Libby tree  which appears first in  Siam  grows in  Sumatra Borneo Johor Java  and  Mindanao  is continued through all the islands and becomes in these countries a vegetable of the first importance for the subsistence of the inhabitants It is as wheat to the  Europeans  mayz to the  Americans  dates to the  Arabs  and rice to the  Hindoos  The use of rice the great food of  India  ceases either the ground is unfit for the cultivation or the natives are too lazy to sow it when nature offers them a more ready food The sago trees grow in great numbers in every one of these islands It sometimes attains the height of thirty feet and the branches extend twenty the circumference of the stem is as much as a man can embrace the head spreads into leaves like a palm to which genus it bears a great resemblance but  Linnaeus  chooses to fling it among the ferns  Rumphius  who is very diffuse in his account of it places it among the palms under the name of  Sagu  and  Palma farinaria  Rumphius i to tab  Mr  Forrest  gives  the best account of this most necessary article I shall therefore borrow from him what is to be said on the subject  THE sago or libby tree has like the cocoanut tree no distinct bark that peels off and may be defined a long tube of hard wood about two inches thick containing a pulp or pith mixed with many longitudinal fibres The tree being felled it is cut into lengths of about five or six feet a part of the hard wood is then sliced off and the workman coming to the pith cuts across generally with an adze made of hard wood called a neebong the longitudinal fibres and the pith together leaving a part at each end uncut so that when it is excavated there remains a trough into which the pulp is again put mixed with water and beat with a piece of wood then the fibres separated from the pulp float at top and the flour subsides After being cleared in this manner by several waters the pulp is put into cylindrical baskets made of the leaves of the tree and if it is to be kept some time those baskets are generally sunk in fresh water  ONE tree will produce from two to four hundred weight of flour no wonder then if agriculture be neglected in a country where the labour of five men in felling sago trees beating the flour and instantly baking the bread will maintain a hundred I have often found large species of the sago tree on the seashore drifts from other countries The sago thus steeped in the salt water had always a four disagreeable smell and in this state I dare say the wild hogs would not taste it The leaf of the sago tree makes the best covering for houses of all the palm kind it will last seven years  Coverings of the  Nipa  or common  Attop  such as they use on the southwest coast of  Sumatra  will not last half the time When sago trees are cut down fresh ones sprout up from the roots the wild hogs frequent the places where sago trees have lately been cut down and the flour or pith has been taken out they there feast and fatten on the remains  WE seldom or never see sago in  Europe  but in a granulated state To bring it into this state from the flour it must be first moistened and passed through a sieve into an iron pot very shallow held over a fire which enables it to assume a globular form  THUS all our grained sago is half baked and will keep long The pulp or powder of which this is made will also keep long if preserved from the air but if exposed it presently turns sour  THE  Papua  oven for this flour is made of earthen ware  SAGO OVEN  it is generally nine inches square and about four deep it is divided into two equal parts by a partition parallel to its sides each of those parts is subdivided into eight or nine about an inch broad tab so the whole contains two rows of cells about eight or nine in a row The sago bread fresh from the oven eats just like hot rolls Bread thus baked will keep I am told several years I have kept it twelve months nor did vermin destroy it in that time  OTHER writers who have treated of this useful tree are  Kaempfer Amoen Exot    Thunberg Fl Jap    Raii Hist  pl  Seb Mus  i tab  Dampier  i and  G Forster Flor Austr ins  p who says it is found in the  Friendly Isles  and  New Hebrides Rumphius  describes some other species of this tree or of the palm which contains the sago To that most admirable writer I must refer the reader for a copious history of the valuable nutriment  ON this tree perhaps more frequent than any palm

the sea it is particularly noted for the sago trees is thinly inhabited but much frequented by parties from  Gilolo  for the sake of cutting the trees for the pith the  Dutch  therefore to prevent the smuggling of the spices constantly keep some of the country vessels cruizing between the two islands  Morty  belongs to  Ternate  WE now arrive at the  Papuan Islands  PAPUAN ISLANDS  the group which lies between  Patany Point  and  New Guinea  they take their name from the land of  Papua  or  New Guinea  and as low as the island of  Ceram  The names of the principal are  Waggiou Gammon Patanta Salwatty  and  Myxoal  surrounded by others small and of little note unless by being the places where the adventurous  Forrest  touched in his voyage in search of the nutmeg trees  He had the double hazard of falling into the hands of the  Dutch  or perishing by the fury of the wild natives but the first he fortunately escaped and by his own prudent and conciliating behavior added to his having a

southeast of  Patany Hook  and about six leagues distant Its length is four or five leagues its breadth small and its appearance like two hills divided by a low isthmus and full of inhabitants  VISITED BY THE FRENCH  The  French  actuated by the laudable spirit of improving their colonies by the introduction of nutmeg trees made more than one voyage for the procuring that valuable spice The first was in the year in which the celebrated naturalist M  Sonnerat  and the more celebrated philosopher M  Le Poivre  embarked and sailed from the isle of  France  They studiously concealed the names of the islands they visited and the means they used to accomplish the ends of their mission M  Sonnerat  went a second time in has published the account of his voyage but has given us only a description of the more curious birds and of the  Papuans  the natives of the isles and of  New Guinea  The  French  touched at the island of  Gibby  which they call  Gweby  During their stay there they were visited by the rajah or prince of  Patany  the sultan of  Tidor  and even received an embassy from one whom they stiled the emperor of  Salwatty  They were most respectfully treated by these potentates and by the friendship of the prince of  Patany  obtained the object of the voyage They carried forty thousand nutmeg  trees to the island of  Bourbon  and others were sent to the isle of  France  another cargo was sent to the isles of  Sechelles  If I recollect right we found on the  Grenades  nutmeg trees when we took those islands which had been planted by the  French  Those which had been transported to the isle of  France  bore fruit but I believe not to that perfection as they do in their native soil  Gag  is a small uninhabited island in Lat ° ′ south  GAG  but has the advantage of a safe bay of fresh water and of timber which induces people to touch there  Syang  SYANG  another little isle north of the line in Lat ° ′ has also both wood and water Captain  Forrest  procured the last by observing that on cutting a tree he calls the  Arrow Plant  that water distilled from it he then dug and found a spring On a little sandy isle called  Pulo eye  he met with the eggs of the turtle directed to them by the marks of the sins on the sand  OTHER small isles that lie a little to the north and to the south of the line in about Long ° east from  Greenwich  may be mentioned to shew the indefatigable industry of our countrymen such are  Ruib  and  Een  or fish isle to the north  RUIB  and to the south is  Waglol  a small flat isle the residence of a  synagee  WAGLOL  or chieftain of the country distinguished by having half his coat and long drawers clouded with red white and yellow the other half with blue white and green the turband was of white calico pinked the clouded part of the dress was  Hindoostan  calico dyed by the natives of the  Moluccas  Some of these chieftains are men of most polished manners  Tomoguy  and the two islands of  Patang  and  Pally  TOMOGUY  form between them the safe harbor of  Manafuin  a streight four  miles long with a mud bottom  Piamis  and  Tamuay  are isles of no note  SALWATTY  still more south but  Salwatty  the most remote of the  Papuas  and of a considerable size is divided from the coast of  New Guinea  by the narrow streight of  Galoway  It is of a lozenge shape very populous and governed by a rajah In the rajah with more than a hundred of the  Papuan  boats from that island  Arrou  and  Myxoal  made the tour of the isles and sailed up the streights which divide  Gilolo  from  Batchian  The  Dutch  apprehensive of some mischief made their chieftains presents of cloth c Their stay was short for after fishing and hunting a few days they dispersed and went home the rajah excepted who with a few of his people remained behind without offering the least offence The  Dutch  treacherously inveigled him to  Ternate  and even made him a present of a bag of dollars to be laid out in any of the  European  articles he chose out of their magazines He entered the fort with a few of his men and was immediately informed that he was a prisoner His people instantly gave signs of  running a muck  to save their master or to sell their own lives dearly The generous rajah whispered to them an order of forbearance and to endeavor their own escape which they effected The prince gave up his  cris  and was soon transported to the Cape to join the miserable exiles on  Robben Island  THE  Dutch  might have some cause for their fears it being customary for the  Papuans  of  New Guinea  and  Salwatty  to assemble in great numbers in the months of  March  and  April  when the seas are generally smooth and make war on  Gilolo Ceram Amboina  and as far as  Aulla Bessi  In they plundered  the isle of  Amblou  near  Buero  and carried away many of the inhabitants  THE  Papuans  the inhabitants of these isles  PAPUAN PEOPLE  and of the land of  Papuas  or  New Guinea  and according to Mr  Forrest  p the internal parts of the  Moluccas  are a most singular race of men of a horrible appearance and great ferocity brave says M  Sonnerat  lovers of war cruel suspicious and treacherous Mr  Forrest  saw them frequently but his account of them is brief they behaved to him easy and familiar and even furnished him with fish or such provisions their islands afforded  Forrest  conciliated their affection It is highly probable that  Sonnerat  received his accounts from some  Europeans  who had provoked them by their insults They live chiefly on fish or turtle of which they have abundance and neglect every species of agriculture When they want bread they carry live turtle and sausages made of their eggs dried fish c to the island of  Waggiou  where they exchange them for  sago  baked or fresh Their own isles furnish the trees in quantity but so lazy are they that they very seldom will give themselves the trouble of cutting them down They also bring with them tortoiseshell and  suallo  which they sell to the  Chinese  whom they find trading in the different islands Their wives and children accompany them in these voyages which are performed in boats like those we call punts square at each end and furnished with an outrigger of a single frame they row with very broad oars They take with them their bows arrows and lances and for fishing are provided with a small round net distended at the end of a pole of the same kind as our  English  landing net Add to this two or three  foxlooking dogs for the purpose of pursuit by sea or land for the  Papuans  have a most singular water chase which is that of hogs  WATER CHASE OF HOGS  they follow those animals as they are swimming among the small islands and shoot them with their arrows or transfix them with spears The swine swim in a line and the hindmost hogs rest their snouts on the backs of the preceding Mr  Forrest  Tab xi  gives us a representation of this kind of hunting and also of the persons boats and the naval apparatus of these sportsmen They are excellent archers their arrows are often six feet long the bow is generally of slit  bamboo  and the string of split  rattans  THE aspect of these people is frightful and hideous  FORM OF THE PAPUANS  the men are stout in body their skin of a shining black rough and often disfigured with marks like those occasioned by the leprosy their eyes are very large their noses flat mouth from ear to ear their lips amazingly thick especially the upper lip their hair woolly either a shining black or fiery red M  Sonnerat  imagines the last to be owing to some powder It is dressed in a vast bush so as to resemble a mop some are three feet in circumference the least two and a half in this they stick their comb consisting of four or five diverging teeth with which they occasionally dress their frizzled locks to give them a greater bulk they sometimes ornament them with feathers of the birds of  Paradise  others add to their deformity by boring their noses and passing through them rings pieces of bone or sticks and many by way of ornament hang round their necks the tusks of boars The heads of the women are of less size than those of the men and in their left ear they wear small brass rings  The men go naked excepting a small wrapper round their waists made of the fibres of the coco The women use a covering in general of the coarse  Surat baftas  tucked up behind so as to leave their bodies and thighs exposed to view The children have no sort of cloathing  ON an isle in Lat ° ′  WOMEN  Schouten  observed that the women were more hideous than the men their face resembled that of a monkey their breasts hung down to their middle their stomachs enormously large and their limbs most disproportionally slender one squinted a second had an arm monstrously swelled a third a leg in short there was not one but had some defect that indicated an unwholesome climate Such is the account given in  Vol i p  Les Navigations aux Terres australes  OFF the northwest part of  Salwatty  is the long isle of  Patanta  PATANTA  divided from the former by a narrow but long passage called  Pitt  's streights Mr  Dalrymple  gives views of both of the islands The land is high on each side but that of  Patanta  remarkably so the mountains are double and treble and rise above each other into most exalted summits ending in points or in rounded forms and quite cloathed with fine woods  Dampier  in sailed between the north side of  Patanta  and the adjacent island through a streight seen in the maps under the name of the new  Passage Dampier  mistook the isle of  Patanta  for the extreme northwest part of the  Papuas  land or  New Guinea  and passed under cape  Monkaite  the most westerly point of  Patanta  which he supposes to have been the cape  Maho  of the  Dutch  Immediately afterwards he fell in with some small islands  which he named  Cockle  isle  ISLE OF KING WILLIAM  Pigeon  isle and king  William  's isles Mr  Dalrymple  in his view of headlands gives a point on the last the title of cape  Maho  that judicious writer makes king  William  's island the northern boundary of the new streight or as he names it  Dampier  's streight king  William  's island is very mountanous and woody and greatly resembling that of  Patanta Dampier  visited a small low island off the western part of king  William  's which he called  Pigeon  isle from its swarming with a species of those birds  THE third he named  Cockle  isle  COCKLE ISLE  from the number of the  Chama Gigas  of  Linnaeus  which he found on the coral rocks This

that the pair must have weighed five hundred and sixteen pounds exclusive of the fish which in some weighs thirty pounds This is esteemed very good stewed and with the  Sago  bread of these islands may at any time be a sure relief to navigators By reason of the size of these shells it is unsafe to attempt taking them into a small canoe the method of managing them in such circumstances is to put a pole into the gaping shell which instantly closes and holds so fast that it may be drawn up to the surface of the water the fish on being stabbed with a cutlass dies immediately and may be taken out and the shells dropped into the sea M  Da Costa  says that sometimes a pair of shells weigh six and even seven hundred pounds Mr  Gmelin  Lin Syst  relates that the fish is large enough to feed a hundred and twenty men and that the shells are able to snap a cable in two or to cut off a man's hand the last I can credit possibly the first is an exaggerated proof of their strength  MR  Born  p from  Davila  informs us that from the ligament of the hinge is made a gem called  Pavonium  by lithologists  NORTH of  Patanta  is a narrow anonymous isle lying midway and at but a small distance from it that of  Gammon  situated near to  Waygiou  one of the greatest of the  Papuan  isles  WAYGIOU  On the south this is divided by two great bays which penetrate deeply into the country the northern side is gently incurvated and bends at each end towards the south the equator passes over the middle of the island The land is very lofty and the mountains divide frequently into peaks the loftiest of which is distinguished by the name of the  Buffalo's Horn  The island is faid to be forty leagues in circumference to be governed by chieftains and to contain a hundred thousand inhabitants who are perpetually at war with each other On the south side are two very good harbors  Piapis  and  Offak  Mr  Forrest  gives plans of them in his ninth plate and of the picturesque harbor of  Rawak  in plate In the same and also in tab are views of the island itself  BESIDES the little isles such as  Ruib Een  and others to the north and northwest of the harbor of  Piapis  are

saying that Mr  Forrest  met with the utmost hospitality from the natives and from the  Moodoos  LAND OF PAPUAS  or chieftains even a species of politeness These islands command a view of the lofty mountains of the land of  Papuas  or  New Guinea  HERE the reader may be told that this country was discovered  in  WHEN DISCOVERED  on the day of the  Epiphany  by  Don Alvar de Saavedra  who sailed from a port in  Mexico  by order of the great  Ferdinando Cortez  who was instigated to it by an ecclesiastic of the name of  Juan d'Arragzaga  in order to promote a farther knowlege of the spicy isles He reached the  Moluccas  where he found some remains of the fleet of  Magellan  from  Tidor  he took his departure on his return to  Mexico  and fell in with the  Papuan  isles and the land of  Papua  itself which he called  New Guinea  on the mistaken opinion that it lay in the same meridian circle as the  African Guinea  THE first remarkable place on this part of that vast island is the cape of  Good Hope  Forrest p and plate at p    CAPE OF GOOD HOPE  lying very nearly under the equator it is to be seen at the distance of thirtysix miles sloping down to the very water Abundance of drift wood was observed not only here but about  New Britain  and all the islands to the north  THE whole coast continues very lofty and the land a vast succession of mountain above mountain richly cloathed with woods The little isle of  Yowry  in Lat ° ′ south Long ° ′ east  ISLE OF YOWRY  has behind it a safe harbor and on it the nutmeg tree farther is the land of  Dory  with a small hooked promontory of the same name and within that in Lat ° ′ south Long ° east is the harbor of an appearance most uncommonly beautiful and picturesque bounded by ranges of mountains rising above each other to amazing heights and finely wooded  MOUNTAINS OF ARFACK  Those of  Arfack  are the most distant from the coast and appear to soar above  the rest Numbers of fires were seen possibly made by the mountaneers  THE shores were planted with coco palms  PAPUAN HOUSES  and varied with the grotesque inhabitants and their singular habitations built over the water on stages erected on posts far projecting into the bay and constructed exactly like some of the stairs on the river  Thames  A few yards from this is another stage in deeper water on which stands a small more elevated hut the first tenement is the largest and contains fourteen cabins some are lesser seven on a side besides a common hall In the last the women sit some making mats others pots out of the ductile clay which they afterwards burn with dry grass or brush wood the women do most of the work they often are seen with an axe preparing the timber for the stages while the men indulge in indolence or preparation for the chase of wild hogs The married people with their families live apart from the batchelors in the greater houses the batchelors in those on the end of the stage such is said to be the case with the  Battas  on  Sumatra  and the  Moroots  on  Borneo  The frontispiece to Mr  Forrest  's book gives a full idea of these tenements and the surrounding scenery and in tab is a beautiful view of the entrance with one of those little roundheaded buttonshaped islands covered with wood to the water edge and which characterise the archipelagos of these parts of the  Indian  seas  IN the inland part of the country is a race of men called  Haraforas  HARAFORAS  who are a sort of gardeners and cultivate the plantanes and some other esculents these they supply the  Papuas  with by a certain tenure for if a  Papuan  presents a  Harafora  with an axe or chopping knife his lands and labor are subject to a tax for ever to the donor If the  Harafora  loses his axe he is still subject to the tax if he breaks or wears it out the  Papuan  must supply him with another or the tax ceases The  Haraforas  wear long hair but are  Pagans  like the  Papuans  They live in trees which they ascend by a long notched pole which they draw after them to prevent surprise  I CAN give no account of the religious rites of either of these people  TOMBS  The  Papuans  form tombs of the rude coral rock Mr  Forrest  saw one with the wooden figure of a child about eight years old completely dressed a real scull with a wooden head was placed in the upper part  THEIR commerce is chiefly with the  Chinese  COMMERCE  from them they purchase their iron tools chopping knives and axes blue and red  baftas China  beads plates basons c The  Chinese  carry back  Misory  bark which they get to the eastward of  Dory  at a place called  Warmasine  or  Warapine  it is worth thirty dollars a  pecul  on  Java  They trade also in slaves ambergris  Suallo  or sea slug tortoiseshell small pearls black  Loeries  large red  Loeries  birds of Paradise and many kinds of dead birds which the  Papuans  have a particular way of drying As to the  Misory  bark the  Chinese  carry it to the island of  Java  and sell it to the natives who reduce it to powder and rub their bodies with it as the  Gentoos  on the  Coromandel  coast do with the sandal wood  AFTER this extract let me observe how very prevalent is the infamous trassic in our fellow creatures for it reaches possibly to the remotest part of  New Guinea  The man I mention at p of  this volume engraven by  Le Brun  was one of six seized on the coast of  New Guinea  in by the commander of the  Vink  a  Dutch  ship who brought them to  Batavia  where they were treated with great humanity it having been the design of the  Dutch  to send them back to their own country in order to conciliate the affections of the natives The  Papuans  trade in their brother  Papuans  and carry them to any chance customers they may meet with Captain  Forrest  met with a boat with only four men two of which were slaves for sale each had round his neck a rattan collar with a log of wood cut into the form of a sugar loaf and of five or six pound weight pendant behind These were offered very cheap to the captain but he declined the purchase He seems to have been before provided for he tells us  P  he bought a linguist at  Yowl  I AM reminded of the ornithology of  New Guinea  and the  Papuan  islands by the curious birds which make another article of commerce nature here grows voluptuously rich in the forms of various of the feathered tribe which wanton in its

most eminent and refer to p for the preface to the genus and history of the first species I shall resume the subject with the  Shague  SHAGUE  a smaller bird of Paradise  Forrest's Voy Latham ii

a chain which extends from the south end of  Gilolo  to the west extremity of  New Guinea  They never migrate but roost on the loftiest trees of the most mountanous parts of the country and are likewise said to have their king or leader They are shot with blunt arrows by the natives of  Mixoal  others say that when the natives observe where they come to drink they poison the water with the  Cocculi Indici  which so stupifies them that they are caught readily They love to feed on the fruit of the  Tshampedeh  which they pierce with their bills and extract the kernel The natives preserve them by drawing the entrails and searing the inside with a hot iron after which they put them in the hollow of a bamboo for their security The  Papuans  call them  Shag  or  Shague  They differ from the former in being residentiary birds otherwise I might have been tempted to have joined this and the former as varieties They likewise might clame the title of  Manuco Dewata  for like the preceding they aspire to the heavenly regions A fable not unlike part of that of the  Phoenix  is related of this species that when it finds its end approaching it soars directly up to the sun till exhausted

I WILL conclude this incomplete list by saying that the circumambient seas of  New Guinea  as well as the  Spicy Sea  have all the pelagic birds of the tropical regions  PELAGIC BIRDS TROPIC BIRDS  besides those which wander within them from the north and from the south Tropic birds are here seen hovering at amazing heights or darting on the flying fishes driven out of their element by the pursuit of the  Bonito Albicore  and other of their congenial enemies sometimes resting on the water or on the backs of the sleeping tortoises stupidly suffering themselves to be taken by the navigators who happen to pass by They breed in several places within the  Tropics  in the  Atlantic  and  Pacific Oceans  both on the ground and in trees along with the  frigates  and in such numbers that the  trees are loaden with these picturesque birds in a most singular manner  THE  frigate  birds appear gliding in the air at times at stupendous heights  FRIGATE  and often making the clouds their place of rest sustaining themselves long motionless on their vast expanse of wing Then from a situation so lofty as to render them scarcely visible will by virtue of their penetrating eyes see and dart down on a fish with astonishing rapidity and with their prey as suddenly regain their former aerial situation Gulls are often their attendants and dispute the booty with them  Petrels  of different kinds are seen skimming the surface  PETRELS  some are accustomed to snatch the fishes as they pass along others collected in multitudes suddenly dart in concert beneath the water for their food rise again and repeat their exercises in long succession  Pelecans  PELECANS  and the duller  Corvorants  keep near to the shores The  Pelecans  are often seen in the air shifting from place to place their snowy color and vast bulk of body and expanse of wing render them astonishing objects they fly like wild geese in wedgeshaped phalanxes and afford a most amusing variety in the animated atmosphere  THE finwinged  Pinguins  keep erect on the shore  PINGUINS  till compelled by hunger they are driven in search of food into the sea Their rapid diving is among the wonders they are seen beneath the transparent waves darting after their prey with all the swiftness of the  Albicore  or  Bonito  WATER spouts are phaenomena most frequent in these seas  WATER SPOUTS  they appear hanging out of the clouds in a funnel shape the base uppermost but at times assume different forms Let me speak to the eyes by referring to  Phil Trans Abridg  ii tab p vol iv part d p tab vol viii tab to  Gentil  's Voy ii tab but above all to  Thevenot Engl Trans  folio p in which their shapes and progress are variously represented either rising in a thick column from the sea or falling from the clouds to the terror of the mariners who expect to be overwhelmed by the quantity and weight of water an accident that never has been well proved to have happened  Dampier  who was most conversant in maritime phaenomena of any man in his or perhaps any other time confesses he never knew of any damage done by a water spout except once  Vol i p  and that appears to have been by the cause and not by the spout itself which fell into the sea near the ship with a vast noise and agitation of the water the mizen mast fore mast and boltsprit were snapped short off but this injury arose entirely from the rage of the whirlwind which formed the spout its first blast blew the ship all along on one side and almost overset her then suddenly whirling round with the same fury very nearly overset her on the contrary side Sailors are always full of terrors at the appearance of spouts they discharge cannon into them in order to break and make them fall at a distance but never with effect The experienced  Dampier  concludes with saying "that the fright was always the greatest harm"  I NOW resume the element of earth Off the harbor of  Dory  extends the island of  Manaswary  it is about five miles in compass  and full of trees Here Captain  Forrest  accomplished the end of his mission he found on it abundance of nutmeg trees  P  and paid five pieces of  baftas  his promised reward to any person who discovered them The fruit was pendent on the old trees and the young plants growing under their shade He took up above a hundred put them into baskets with earth round them and then hastened on his return to  Balambangan  CAPTAIN FORREST finished his voyage at port  Mansingham  PORT OF MANSINGHAM  at a very small distance from  Dory  harbor The land from that port recedes deeply to the south and forms a large bay gradually narrowing to the bottom In Mr  Arrowsmith  's map the lower part is under the suspicion of being an island it is marked on each side with double dotted lines expressive of streights which opens southerly towards the  Arrou  isles The promontory of  Dory  and  Geetvinks Point  are the two horns of this bay  Long Island  lies at a small distance to the north of  Geetvinks Point  LONG ISLAND  SCHOUTENS'  and in Lat ° ′ S is  Schouten  's named in honor of the great circumnavigator who discovered it in It is about twenty leagues in length high and fertile populous and the inhabitants an active race The coast extends far to the east Off it is a succession of small isles several of them volcanic and called by  Schouten Vulcans  and by  Dampier  burning isles  Jamna  and  Moa  are other small islands  JAMNA AND MOA  well inhabited and abounding with cocoa nuts and various fruits Captain  Forrest  gives us two prints representing the natives and their canoes their hair is flatted on the top of the head some decorate it with a feather and others bind a wreath round their temples  and head They wear great earrings and bones stuck through their ears and nostrils Men women and children go armed with bows and arrows  AFTER proceeding along the coast farther eastward the discoveries of our famous navigator  Dampier  thicken on us an archipelago appears with the  Crown Island  that of Sir  Robert Rich  another long island Sir  George Rooke  's and several others  SIR G  ROOKE  many of which were active volcanoes  IN Lat ° ′ S  Dampier  discovered a new land to the north divided from  New Guinea  by a streight from six to seven leagues wide each side marked by a lofty cape to one he gave the name of  King William  's to that on the north side Cape  Anne  and within each was a very high mountain sloping gradually to the sea the mountains and lower lands finely cloathed with trees intermixed with beautiful  Savannas  of the most flourishing verdure  NEW BRITAIN  This northern land he named  New Britain  WE will follow his track as far as will prove it to be an island or possibly more than one Let me observe that  Dampier  's approach was the reverse from that which we now take In Lat ° ′ south he put into a bay named by him  Port Montagu  PORT MONTAGU  The country was mountanous wooded full of rich vallies and pleasant streams of fresh water The trees were of various kinds some in flower others bore berries and others large fruits and cocoa palms in abundance but the nuts were small here were also yams and other good esculent roots and ginger The quadrupeds were hogs and dogs possibly it was from hence that the South Sea isles were stocked with those animals  being the nearest place they could be supplied from Among the birds were parrots cockatoos pigeons crows and abundance of other species There was also fish in plenty How unfortunate were our convicts that this rich island was not thought of as the place of their involuntary retreat  A VERY little to the north of  Montagu Bay  was discovered in another streight of small breadth but which severs  New Britain  into two islands leaving the northern the largest It was not  Dampier  's fortune to discover it he passed it by and in Lat ° ′ south  CAPE ORFORD  saw a headland he named Cape  Orford  The country continued very mountanous full of people the men armed with lances their head gay with feathers the women had no sort of ornaments and nothing to hide their nakedness except a bunch of green leaves behind and before There were tame hogs in great abundance which ran about near the hovels of the natives  WITHIN cape  Orford  was an inlet which  Dampier  supposing to be a great bay named by him that of  St George  and a cape on the northern side in Lat ° south Long ° ′ east correspondent to cape  Orford  CAPE ST GEORGE  he called cape  St George  These two headlands proved the distinguishing mark of the entrance into a streight which divided  New Britain  into a second island This discovery was made by that able officer Captain  Carteret September  th on his disastrous return from the South Seas When he got into  St George  's bay he found so strong a current to the northwest that he could not return to pursue  Dampier  's track Captain  Carteret  soon after he doubled cape  St George  met with several islands in the southern side of the streights  the nearest about three leagues from the cape he named  Wallis  's which lay before an harbor he called  Gower  's  WALLIS'S ISLE  The island was lofty well wooded and inhabited farther on were two coves with fresh water rivers falling into their bottom About four leagues from  Wallis  's isle still to the west was a good harbor on which was bestowed the respectable name of the discoverer across it lay  Cocoanut  isle On this coast were trees of enormous growth all the kinds of palms the betel tree aloes bamboos rattans a fruit the sailors call a  Jamaica  plumb and probably many of the tropical fruits and plants he also found the nutmeg tree in plenty possibly this place is its most remote situation to the north  THE country abounded with land birds seemingly the same with those of  New Britain  among them was a large black bird that made a noise like the barking of a dog which I suppose to have been a  Buceros  MR  Carteret  pursued his own discovery and sailed directly westward  NEW IRELAND  He gave the name of  New Ireland  to the island on the northern side and distinguished three capes on the southern by the names of  Buller Palliser  and  Stephens  CAPE STEPHENS  Between cape  Palliser  and cape  Stephens  is an island to which Mr  Carteret  gave the name of the Duke of  York  's quite level deliciously cloathed with lofty woods in the inland parts and near the shore planted with cocoa groves intermixed with the houses of the islanders  TO the east of cape  Stephens  is in midchannel an isle he called the isle of  Man  Cape  Stephens  is the supposed most extreme western point of  New Britain  all that side as far as cape  Gloucester  still remains undiscovered A little to the south of cape  Stephens  are three singular hills the  Mother  and  Daughters  and behind them a vast volume of smoke arose out of one of the numerous volcanic hills of the country The land like the rest of  New Britain  was very lofty and wooded with many clear spots the signs of plantations and frequent fires the marks of inhabitants The general breadth of these streights are about fifteen leagues  Hawksworth iii  no bottom was found with a line of a hundred and forty fathoms Captain  Carteret  modestly declined giving his own name to this important discovery but called it  St George  's channel  ST GEORGE'S CHANNEL  the streights properly end at cape  Stephens  As soon as that promontory is passed there is one expanse of sea probably quite to  New Guinea  but the name of  St George  's channel is continued along the shores of  New Ireland  to its western extremity where it is broken into a smaller isle named by our navigator  Hanover  and the extreme point in Lat ° ′ south Long ° ′ east queen  Charlotte  's foreland the approach to it is through a narrow passage between an isle called  Sandwich  and  New Ireland  The land of  Hanover  isle is high finely covered with trees mixed with plantations exhibiting a most beautiful landscape  THE whole length of  St George  's channel  LENGTH OF  from cape  St George  to queen  Charlotte  's foreland is three hundred miles that of  New Ireland  from cape  St George  to cape  Biron  the western extremity is two hundred and forty miles cape  Biron  is possibly the same with that we see in  Dampier  's map under the name of cape  Solomaswar  As to the form of  New Ireland  it is extremely narrow the whole way the greatest part runs northwest but towards the east end reverts and bends like a hook to the south terminating in cape  St George  BEYOND these was a group of small isles Mr  Carteret  named the  Admiralty  in Lat ° ′ south Long ° ′ east By the views of them they appear less elevated than  Hanover  isle and we may collect from the multitudes of canoes that sallied out to attack our commander that they must be very populous they were manned with people nearly black with woolly heads The natives were very hostile  NATIVES  and flung with great force lances headed with flint they chewed betel went quite naked but their bodies were ornamented with shells their faces streaked with white and their heads as finely powdered with white powder as an  English  beau ready for a  Bal parè  One of their canoes apparently the least was taken yet it measured full fifty feet in length In it were specimens of their arts such as earthen pots in which they dressed their victuals and a quantity of matting which served for sails and awnings there were besides cocoa nuts and other fruits unknown to our people  SOME of the canoes of  New Ireland  were ninety feet long  CANOES  formed out of a single tree a proof of the vigorous growth of timber in this country they were manned by three and thirty men black and woolly headed but they had not the thick lip or flat nose in ornaments and powdering they resembled the former some had cock's feathers in their heads a proof that they did not want poultry They had lances by way of arms and cordage and fishing nets very skilfully manufactured all this country  is probably well inhabited and very fertile in trees and fruits the sea abounding in turtle and fish The very distressed state of Captain  Carteret  and his crew is the sad but true apology for our wanting from his able pen a fuller account of this interesting island  ON  July  th M  Bougainville  anchored in the same bay as Captain  Carteret  did and named it  Port Praslin  He observed here the pepper plant and found wild hogs numbers of birds and among others the great crowned pigeon variety of snakes scorpions and the singular insect the walking leaf  AMONG the serpents was the sea snake of that species which at p is suspected to have been poisonous this was verified here A sailor was bitten as he was hawling the  Seine  he was very soon affected with violent pains all over his body his side the part on which he received the wound became livid and swelled greatly the blood taken from him appeared dissolved he suffered much for five or six hours at length by the assistance of the  Venice  treacle or  Theriaca Andromachi  with  flower de luce  water he fell into a violent perspiration and was quite cured  Bougainville's Voyage translation p  The natives of  Otaheite  assert that the bite is mortal  Dampier  coasted the whole northern side Captain  Carteret  in his approach to the eastern end fell in with a group of little isles to which he gave the name of the  nine isles  He passed between two larger the more southern he called Lord  Anson  's the more northern Sir  Charles Hardy  's in Lat ° ′ south was flat verdant and appeared well inhabited He soon after saw St  John  's isle  ST JOHN's ISLAND c  discovered by  Schouten  and seen by  Dampier  It is nine or ten leagues round rises into high hummocks full of lofty trees with plantations and groves near the shores and seemingly very populous We now fall in with  Dampier  with cape St  Mary's  in Lat ° ′ south The country was mountanous high and wooded with many points of land running into the sea forming between them as many fine bays Here a man of large size approached the ship and spoke a language different from those  Dampier  had before seen Proceeding northwestward the whole extent of  New Ireland  or the coast opposite to St  George  's channel afterwards traced by Captain  Carteret  appears before us At some distance from it is a chain of isles of which St  John  's may be deemed one They had been all named by the  Dutch Antony Cave  's is lofty  GERARD DENNIS's  Gerard Dennis  's is the next fourteen or fifteen leagues in circumference high wooded and mountanous thick set with plantations and full of cocoa trees The shape was irregular full of points forming sandy bays the ground cleared for plantations and the soil of a brownish red color The next island named  Wishart  's  WISHART'S  resembled the preceding  Dampier  also discovered two other islands somewhat farther to the west One ten leagues long he named  Mathias  like many others mountanous and woody mixed with  Savannas  and cleared land and near that a low and plain island cloathed with tall and large trees as close to each other as they could stand This he called the  squally  from the violent gales he met with off the coast  IN respect to the north shore of  New Ireland  I find that our navigator attempted to touch at only one place which he named  Slinger  's bay This country seems prodigiously populous  SLINGER'S BAY  his  ship was surrounded with prows filled with men who assaulted him with stones flung out of engines and the shores were lined with the natives from end to end  NATIVES  All the inhabitants of this and the adjacent isles were a warlike race hostile to strangers and very suspicious They were tall even above the size of the common race of men strong and well made had curled short hair often shaved in different forms and stained with white red and yellow their heads were round faces broad they had great bottle noses and substances stuck through the gristle passing from cheek to cheek Their weapons were lances swords slings and bows and arrows their speech clear and distinct All these are the same kind of people from the remotest of the  Papuan  isles to this island varying a little in the dressing of their hair and other trifling matters  THEIR prows were very neatly built  PROWS  with outriggers on one side the head and stern elevated and most ingeniously carved with figures of fish fowl and on one was a man's head done most surprisingly well considering the rude instruments of stone they had to work with for they seemed ignorant of the uses of iron their paddles were very neat and they made their way with amazing swiftness through the water  A VERY legendary tale is told in  L'Histoire de Navigations aux Terres Australes  P  respecting the origin of the  Negro  race in these  Asiatic  isles which is first met with in some of the  Manillas  continued through the  Papuan  isles and  New Guinea  and even through  New Holland  I have mentioned them before in my  account of the  Manillas  and if I recollect right one of these islands is called the isle of  Negroes  from its being inhabited by a curled headed people  I NOW return from cape  Biron  or  Solomaswar  taking a course due south along the western coasts of the isles of  New Britain  Near the extreme western part of the farthest is an headland called by  Dampier Cape Gloucester  At a small distance to the west is a little island which at the time our navigator passed it was a raging volcano It flung up columns of flame twenty or thirty yards high attended with a noise like thunder followed by an overflowing of redhot lava which ran down the sides of the mountain till it reached the sea This continued two days and nights or as long as this tremendous phaenomenon continued in sight  I NOW repass  Dampier  's streights eastward and turn to the south In Mr  Arrowsmith  's excellent map of the world  New Guinea  is continued by dotted lines farther to the east and on the south side near the extremity of that line the uncertainty is taken away by a tract of land discovered by M  de Bougainville  in which he named  La Louisiade  and the extreme eastern point  Le Cap de la Deliverance  in memory of his narrow escape from a violent tempest The great bay which he calls  Le Golfe de la Louisiade  is just to the south of the cape Such a confusion occasioned by the fears and distresses of the great  French  navigator is so apparent in this part of his voyage that nothing more can be collected respecting this portion of  New Guinea  WE must therefore steer along another dotted line till we arrive at  Prince of Wales  's islands  PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLES  Lat ° ′ south Long ° east The largest is long and narrow and lies parallel with the coast This part of the sea between  New Guinea  and  New Holland  is called  Torres  's streights  TORRES'S STREIGHTS  for having been passed in by  Don Baes de Torres  admiral under  Fernandez Quiros  correspondent to them beyond another set of islands named also the  Prince of Wales  's is the  Endeavour  streight passed as I have before mentioned by our boasted  Cook  IN proceeding along the coasts I find names of places but nothing more Captain  Cook  on his quitting the coast of  New Holland  crossed the intervening water and touched in Lat ° ′ at a place on this side of  New Guinea  to which he has neither left a name nor yet even the mark of landing in his chart We are told that it lay sixtyfive leagues to the northeast of  Waelche  cape The country was low but covered with such a luxuriancy of wood and herbage as scarcely can be conceived and among them such numbers of aromatic trees as perfumed the air even at a distance from shore The natives were hostile went quite naked and had much the appearance of the  New Hollanders  They shouted defiance and from a short stick or hollow cane they swung in their hands  FIREARMS  was emitted flashes of fire exactly like the effect of gunpowder these explosions were innocent nor could our navigators ever learn the cause After each explosion which was done by a single man his companions flung their bearded darts All that we learn farther of this country is that it produced sine cocoanuts plantanes and bread fruit  CAPE  Waelche  or  Walsh  the most western point of this coast  CAPE WAELCHE  lies in Lat ° ′ south Long ° east From hence the land runs strait inclining to the northeast when it takes another turn towards the northwest The space between the trendings is occupied by the tract marked in Mr  Arrowsmith  's map as pervious by two streights The  Arrou  isles lie transverse at some distance from this part of  New Guinea  FARTHER to the northwest nearly parallel to the end of  Ceram  is  Freshwater  bay in Lat ° ′ south This was visited by  Dampier  in The country was wooded and mountanous like the other parts of  New Guinea  and the trees of great size here his people killed one of those magnificent pigeons called the  crowned  The bay received its name from the plenty of fresh water and another a little farther north was called  Mackerel  bay from the great quantity of that fish  MACKEREL BAY  or one resembling it which was taken there  OPPOSITE to this bay in Lat ° ′ south is  Pulo Sabuda  PULO SABUDA  a lofty island about three leagues long and two broad not far from the coast of  New Guinea  it is in general rocky but so mixed with rich yellow and black soil as to be productive of many of the tropical fruits and trees The sago tree and the  Jacca  are found there The natives gave  Dampier  two or three nutmegs seemingly fresh gathered but he could not tell whether they were the produce of the isle or of  New Guinea  The inhabitants do not seem to be aboriginal They are tawny have long black hair and differ little from the  Mindanayans  and the people of the other eastern isles the women wear a callico covering  the men go almost naked and are very skilful in striking fish they have great boats in which they often visit  New Guinea  where they procure slaves beautiful parrots c which they carry to  Goram  and exchange for callicoes They keep many of the poor  Papuans  for their own use to do the laborious work This island has the same birds as the main land and bats of an enormous size  I CANNOT quit this part of the coast without mentioning a singular communication made to Captain  Forrest  p by the natives of  Essbe  in the island of  Mixoal  that on the coast of  New Guinca  not far from a gulph about a day's sail from  Wanim  or  Onin  a place about twenty leagues from the northeast of the isle of  Goram  was a set of people who wore large turbans He imagines them to have been the posterity of a colony of  Arabs  ARABS  If this is true their discovery will be just as important to the world as that of the race of  Owen Gwynedd  long lost to the  Britons  till it has been lately credited that they still exist in  America  under the title of  Padoucas  or  Welsh Indians  THAT the western side of  New Guinea  probably all parts  PLENTY OF NUTMEGS  if properly examined abound with nutmeg trees is very certain A  Portuguese  ship which was forced by a storm from its anchorage at  Timor  was driven to this coast and there anchored in order to repair the damage she had received The captain during the interval procured a sufficient loading of nutmegs with which he sailed directly to  Macao  and sold them without ever returning to his former place of destination  FROM  Mackerel  bay the coast trends to the northwest as far as the streights of  Galowa  and  Salwatty  island From thence it turns to the northeast terminating at the Cape of  Good Hope  Thus have I performed the circuit of the great island and concluded this the last great labor of my life  DOWNING  OCTOBER  FLORA INDICA  MONANDRIA MONOGYNIA

the Rev Samuel Dickinson's remarks on this article are worthy the reader's attention  This species grows in the warmer parts of  Europe  and also in  India  and  China  and is much used for walking sticks and fishing rods This is a fragile staff and the only cane in use that has that property Upon an accidental bruise it will break in shivers It is the Kaneh of the Hebrews and from its brittle quality we see the propriety of Rabshakah's allusion Kings xviii  Now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed kaneh even upon Egypt on which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him  The Hebrew word having been introduced not only into the Greek and Latin but most of the modern languages of Europe The Spaniards call it Cannas and the Italians Canna It gave the name of Cane to all the sticks which resembled it when they were first imported by the Dutch c from the East Indies  ARUNDO  phragmites  Common reed
